1409988,1,B000059XTQ,"Having viewed eight different productions of KING LEAR in this past month, I must say this version is the worst! Unfortunatelly, this version is quite often promoted as a production that English or Shakespeare students can easily understand (apparently because the actors perform the roles without an English accent). To quote from the back cover: ""Unfamiliar English accents, so prevalent in most Shakespearean productions, are absent from this series. English and drama teachers, as well as the typical playgoer, will find this feature of tremendous value."" In my opinion, english and drama students, as well as the typical playgoer will be completely bored with this feature!  The major falt must be placed on the actors who seem to simply walk through thier roles without any passion whatever. The director must also take most of the blame for not getting better performances from his actors. In short, this production looks like a ""made for television"" item that lacks great acting or direction. Mediocre all around! I feel sorry for the student who has to sit through this! For those others who can...avoid it!!!",1045267200,13,1118,5.142857142857143

7934598,5,B000059XTQ,"I completely agree with the highest estimation, and in fact believe it falls short. Michael Kellen's performance of Lear is riveting, and the whole company presents a view of Lear which places it beautifully both in Shakespeare's language and ancient Britain. I particularly liked the way Lear's dress was used to augment the power of madness, and the excellence choices Kellen and director made in presenting those scenes, the reconciliation with Cordelia, and terrible, awesome epiphany. This is arguably the best Lear ever filmed and that is saying a very great deal.",1477612800,,570,5.206521739130435
7934599,4,B000059XTQ,"For me, here's the thing about Lear - Lear's original decision makes no sense. It's just stupid. So when I'm supposed to feel for Lear, pity him, I end of felling, well, you asked for it, dummy, and the lack of sympathy makes me enjoy any performance much less. I've seen Olivier, McKellan, in fact most of the ""greats"", and none have done it for me.

Blessed has, and yeah I was surprised. He directed this - very well - but what makes this performance for me is that Blessed brings to Lear a hell of a sense of humor. And he applies just right and just at the correct time. It's as if you see that, immediately after is major decision, he realizes he's made a mistake, but he's King and egotistical, so it's going to stick. Then, he grows increasingly amazed at how badly events twist.

I enjoyed this more than any other Lear performance, and it's a pity that, since he's not Olivier, or Sir Ian or whatever, more wont' see this dvd. It's worth it. And of course, you have Blessed's magnificent booming voice, and huge presence.

The video quality is very watchable but certainly not the sharpest - I'm sure his budget was very tight. I paid $17 - it was worth it.",1440892800,3,1167,4.344036697247707

the script, but it is still a good movie and excellently acted.",1436140800,2,153,3.935483870967742
7934601,5,B000059XTQ,"Brian Blessed does an superb job of making the viewer pity him even though he is acting AS  his fool. Unlike Laurence Oliver's version this is a complete uncut version so that lines not in Oliver allows the viewer to see that he is apparently struggling with early dementia not just BEING the fool. Although Closed Caption would have been nice, I could hear every word including Lear in the storm. The other cast members are all better than good but Blessed is the one that I found truly stunning.",1427932800,4,497,4.522222222222222
7934602,1,B000059XTQ,This edition does not have a menu so to get to the actual play you have to fast forward through a lot of lectures. Whoever thought that this was a good idea should be forced to learn King Lear by heart.,1357516800,2,202,3.951219512195122
7934603,4,B000059XTQ,"Brian Blessed is amazing, as always, with his big booming voice and his exaggerated mannerisms. I've been a fan of his work for many years. He usually plays supporting roles. Consider these:  Flash Gordon. Blackadder. I, Claudius (his best performance). Hamlet. The Phantom Menace. Nice to see him in the lead for a change.

I bought this to use while teaching the play to seniors in high school. The kids didn't like the female Fool and they said Brian Blessed was like a giant Dumbledore. They preferred this version, though, to Patrick McGoohan, which I had from school already.

The eye-gouging scene is resequenced and especially shocking. We watched it twice in class to tease some squeamish kids.

Overall, acting is good. The costumes and sets suited me, as appropriate to Lear's pre-Christian setting. The sound quality is only just okay.

Marginally recommended. I think Lear is due for a big-budget movie in the 21st century. Anthony Hopkins was supposedly attached at one point. That's one of the better choices. Max von Sydow, Sean Connery, and Christopher Plummer would be three others, if their health allowed.",1330128000,5,1125,5.026881720430108
7934604,1,B000059XTQ,"Terrible production values, including a distracting ""raindrop"" effect during the storm scenes, added to some of the most uninspired Shakespearean acting ever captured on video make this production of ""King Lear"" one of the all-time worst.  Kellin himself cannot be blamed, since his Lear may have, with a better company, shone brighter, but with the laughably ridiculous interpretations of Edgar, the Fool and Edmund, Mr. K did not have a chance.  Only recommended for people who love the play so much that they don't mind spending a couple of boozy, altered hours on the floor in hysterics.  Also, aspiring performers of the Bard's works must see this to know what to avoid.",1259971200,3,675,5.008928571428571
7934605,4,B000059XTQ,"William Shakespeare's play King Lear concerning the vagaries of aging, mental breakdown, daughterly duplicity, and other acts of skullduggery gets a workout in this performance headlined by Brian Blessed in the title role. The plot line here centers on the problem of royal inheritance in the female line and finial devotion, or assumed lack of it. After the division of the spoils all hell breaks loose as various parties, including those damn greedy daughters Goneril and Regan, work through their agendas for power.

As is the usually the case with medieval settings we are treated to battles, pledges and disavowal of loyalty and honor and a little off-hand romantic intrigue. The key to the play is the role of Lear, however, and his real or assumed madness, dotage or childishness. I confess that unlike other Shakespeare roles like Othello, Falstaff, Prince Hal and Richard the Third where I have seen several interpretations of the roles this is the first time I have seen this play so it is hard to evaluate Blessed's performance. Off a reading of the play I would say that his is just a little too calculatingly teddy bearish. Notwithstanding that slight criticism, as always with Shakespeare, get this film for the language, all three hours and twenty minutes of it. That is almost always worth the price of admission.",1197590400,,1329,4.959641255605381
7934606,4,B000059XTQ,"In reacting to the other review posted for this DVD version of ""King Lear"", I must take considerable exception.

Apparently, the goal of the production was to convey the tone and style of a VINTAGE, authentic performance of Lear, and in that regard, I feel that it is very valuable and, in its own way, fascinating.

It is a simple production, shot with 2 or 3 cameras in fairly straightforward fashion.  Nevertheless, it moves well and the various camera angles and the director's use of the limited space makes for a very interesting and involving experience--although one that it is admittedly rather low-key, even, dare I say, SUBTLE.

This is the all the more surprising, considering the actor who portrays LEAR---and this was my sole reason for purchasing the DVD.  I have never seen a performance on film by Mike Kellin that was not in some way RIVETING.  He was a most distinctive actor, usually cast as heavies in Westerns, military officers, criminal thugs, etc.

His onscreen persona was really something--a glowering, brutish intensity coupled with an almost tortured and pitiful vulnerability.  Who could forget his performance as Brad Davis' angst-ridden father in ""Midnight Express""?

Mr. Kellin's (and his name is constantly mispelled on the DVD as
""KellEn""), portrayals often walked the edge of nervous, almost neurotic intensity and pathos.  Yes, he could chew the scenery with the best of them, but was also capable of a remarkable, touching subtlety.

And it's the subtlety and sensitivity of his LEAR that makes this performance so commanding.  It was taped in December of 1982, so Kellin had only 8 months to live, before succumbing to lung cancer at age 61. What a summation of a life's work as an actor!  And don't you feel, from my description of Kellin's persona, that he would indeed make a fascinating and compelling Lear?

And, whereas the other reviewer blasts the cast, I must point out that the actor who portrays the doomed Duke of Gloucester, Charles Aidman, was one of early TV's finest stage-trained performers.  He was (and in the present case IS) first-rate!
Again, intense, subtle and commanding as an actor, and masterful in his performance in this production. (Go to IMDB and check his credentials--you have probably seen and heard him dozens of times
in older TV performances---he's one of those expert actors who
never dominated--never called attention to himself----because he didn't have to--he was too GOOD!)Anyone who can honestly watch the scene with Mr. Aidman having his eyes ripped out by Cornwall and still say that the actors are emotionally dull---must not have made it through to this scene.

My advice would be to check out this restrained and very unadorned production, which relies, as Shakespeare should, upon the eloquence and conviction of the actors.  True, the cast IS variable (with some pretty funky accents at times), there are numerous small nips and tucks in the text, plus there's a really cheesy, early 80's synthesizer score (minimal, though)--- but it's still very well done, especially since it gives us a last look at the unique Mr. Mike Kellin in all of his distinctive glory.",1124582400,15,3151,5.005747126436781
