8318968,4,B001LNON12,"I've always been a fan of Jock Mahoney. I was knocked out by being able to
meet him at a Golden Boot awards in the late '80's in Sherman Oaks Ca.
In this film Jock plays an insurance investigator. It's a low budget film.
Ahh, but don't let that fool ya matey!
The dialouge & direction is very snappy & Jocko's sly smile wins over the ladies in this who done it caper. Mister Mahoney's acting is spot on.

This isn't the Range Rider TV show. It's adult fun & nobody outside of Aussie Rod Taylor throws a better punch. What can I say? I liked it!",1238284800,6,544,4.08411214953271
