8147885,5,B000IZJQXO,"Old black and white Hindi movie with excellent songs and a soap opera story. Great quality acting by all actors and actresses. Dilip Kumar has done a very good job. The dances are low to mediocre quality.

Like many of the old stories, the alcoholic's determination alone stopped his drinking for good. The settings provide a good portrait of rural India in the mid 20th century. The movie is valuable for those who are curious about the society, family life, and village life in India in those times. Lack of Westernization is a soothing aspect here for those who want a diversion from the many modern Indian movies of Western costumes and usage of English. 'Daag' is truly Indian.",1261785600,3,682,4.73109243697479
