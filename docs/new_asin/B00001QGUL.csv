1246009,1,B00001QGUL,"This movie...well it was a WONDERFUL idea.  I mean that, it has SO much potential.  BUT, it fell terribly short of being tolerable.  I mean scary is The Exorcist, or Rosemary's Baby.  New horror just throws in blood,  guts, screaming, CURSING and that just does not cut it.  I thought that the  Sixth Sense was TEN times scarier than this movie.  Sad....I wish someone  could take this and make it what it should be",936748800,,415,4.5
1246010,5,B00001QGUL,"When I first heard about the movie, I thought ""this movie, I've have just got to see!""  I did, and I was not disappointed at all.  It seemed so real, you could almost imagine being there.  I'm going to  pre-order the movie as soon as I get done with this review.  Thanks guys  for such an awesome movie!!",936144000,,304,4.155172413793103
1246011,2,B00001QGUL,"This movie's success all hinges on schtick. Here's what needs to happen for you to like this flik. If you can ignore the glaring faults of this film as a film, and simply enjoy the ""When animals attack!"" sort  of voyeuristic aspect of it, and not get sick from the terrible camera  work, then you'll probably like it.
However, personally I didn't like it  because: it was obvious to me when the actors were ""acting"".  Mostly the movie is them running around arguing, then getting freaked out.  Most of it was unscripted, though there were certain things that needed to  be discussed, divulged, spoken, etc., at certain points in the movie. To me  it was painfully obvious when this sort of thing was happening. Check out  the long-haired guy's line about ""why was my stuff covered in that  blue stuff?"" It's so forced.
That's the main problem with this  movie is the same thing that everyone says is so unique and great about it:  there's no script. So, what you got is some kids screwing off in the woods.  It all seems ultra-natural because, well, it actually is a bunch of footage  of these three people screwing around. But, when it comes time to make an  interesting and compelling movie, the efforts to do so just didn't work for  me. The forced plot points, the planted creepy things, the background  story, and especially the shaky premise.
They're supposed to be film  students, yet none of the footage is good enough for an actual documentary,  rather it's only good enough for a mock-documentary horror flik that's  relying on schtick for it's appeal.
If I would have found it scary at  all I could have forgiven everything else, but it didn't even scare me.",941760000,,1669,4.6506849315068495
1246012,2,B00001QGUL,"I'm sorry I fall in the category of ""dont know what all the hype was about"". I gave it two stars for its originality - but it was  overrated.

1246013,2,B00001QGUL,"If you enjoy seeing snot running down the nose of an obnoxious college student as she whimpers in fear, buy this video. If you want to see  hyped-up, trumped-up nonsense, with no basis in fact, but this video. If  you want two goosebumps on a scale of five, buy this video. The companion  piece is a total sham and a waste of time, money and viewer's neuronal  connections...it's all bull, with not enough gore.",941241600,,411,4.513513513513513

It's aimed at the imaginative child in all of us....remember when you were  scared of the dark and all that was hidden?  Watch the movie closely,  immerse yourself into their world.  Only then will you truly appreciate the  absolute horror this movie is about. Do not bother seeing this movie if  you're idea of horror is ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"".  Only intelligent, imaginative minds will appreciate Blair Witch.",940809600,,563,4.78125

1246016,4,B00001QGUL,"I had heard very little about this movie before I rented it, only that it was pretty scary. I didn't know what to expect, maybe a Friday the 13th kind of scary, but this is totally different.

1246019,1,B00001QGUL,"If you know anything about taste in movies you will not waste your time or money on this movie. It painted a pretty good picture of today's youth. Every other word was ""F**K YOU "". They wasted the first half of  the movie with a bunch of arguing nonsense and the rest was for the very  unmotivated!! I know one thing...if I were lost in the woods I wouldn't  spend half of the day taking cigarette breaks and arguing! I would be more  motivated to get the heck out of there!",940636800,,474,4.175824175824176
1246020,5,B00001QGUL,"First of all, to the millions of people who saw the film in theaters WITHOUT first visiting the web-site, I don't expect you to ""get it"" or ""be down wit dat"" or however the hell you say it  these days.
The beauty of this film is that it was meant to be enjoyed  as a ""package deal.""  First, there was the website, which was  posted almost a full year before the film was released.  The website was  pure genius, set up to present facts about the story you saw on the screen.  For example, there was a history of the Blair Witch, as well as forensics  and police reports, local accounts of the Witch and of the three students.  All of these elements provided a great background from which to begin  enjoying this film.
Second, there was the oft-aired ""The Curse of  the Blair Witch"" on the Sci-Fi Channel.  Presented in documentary  form, ""Curse"" provided even more clues and history about the  events surrounding the film.  The interviews with ""townspeople""  and ""experts"" was genious.  I dare anyone defy the fact that, had  you not known the background of this film, you could definitely have  believed most of what was being said.  Of course, as with any documentary,  some of the ""expert evidence"" sounds like made-up crap...but  overall, this production was very well done.
Finally, there was the film.  Did I know the film was fiction when I walked into the theater?  YES.  Did  I care?  NOT A WHIT!  You see, it was wonderfully refreshing to watch a  film WITHOUT beautiful stars emoting for all they're worth (and some are  worth less than these three fine actors).
Being a person who enjoys  live theater as well as film, I was immediately caught up in the immediacy  of the film's subject and story.  I was able to suspend any of my  preconceptions and watch the film for what it was supposed to be...a  ""documentary"" (albeit a FICTIONAL one) about the final days of  three young peoples' lives, and the horrible fear they felt as the terror  of their situation closed in around them.
For the few people like me  who have ever hiked and camped in the woods (and gotten lost, or lost the  bulk of their food supply abruptly days before a scheduled pick-up), the  slow, easy crawl to anger, fear, and paranoia was very easy to believe.  And for those who don't ""do"" camping, try it, and do it without  the boom boxes and walkmans.  Then sleep through the night while listening  to the sounds of creatures unknown cracking twigs and moving in around  you....I dare ya!  (sorry about the sidebar)
To conclude, try watching  less MTV and sit yourself down to a good book.  Using your imagination to  enjoy the book will help you the next time another superb film comes along  that makes you actually THINK about what's going on (without blowing stuff  up and splattering blood all over the screen).  ""The Blair Witch  Project"" is for THINKERS and DOERS, not for those who need their  entertainment packaged into 5-minute, music-video paced segments (and  speaking of music-videos...you're telling me ""Blair Witch's""  camera movements were more nauseating than 18 jump cuts a second on a music  video??????)",940550400,,3111,4.678438661710037
1246021,5,B00001QGUL,"I took my 14 year old son to see this movie upon his request expecting the typical blood,guts and gore and was very surprised at what I saw. I have seen many horror flicks but this one took the cake. We walked out of the  theater wondering if this was real! It took us a few days to process that  this was only a movie like the rest. I thought it was very clever to make  it in this form. Never seen anything like it. It grabs you and won't let  go. You get really scared as if you are there or are watching someone you  know, Then it lets you down easy. Then before you know it you are terrified  again. This is a must see for anyone who likes to get spooked!",940464000,,660,3.888059701492537
1246022,1,B00001QGUL,The best part of this movie was when the lights came back on in the theater.  I have never seen a worse move.  It wasn't scary and it wasn't interesting.  It was about three idiots screaming at each other.  Probably  the worst ending of all time.  Everyone in the theater said is that all  there is?  A waste of money!  The only reason it made money was because of  the hype!,940464000,,375,4.154929577464789
1246023,5,B00001QGUL,Even though it dose drag on at some parts of the movie the night scenes are very diffrent.  The movie was not the scariest movie i've ever seen but it definitly messes with your head.  The end alone just leaves you thinking  as soon as the credits hit.  Definitly one of the best movies of the year.  I can definitly agree with this one getting some awards at the oscars next  year.  Dont miss this one.  And to all you dumbys that just didn't get it i  don't know what planet your living on but you just don't know good original  entertainment when you see it!!!!,940377600,,564,4.235849056603773
1246024,5,B00001QGUL,"This is a movie I can and will watch an unlimited number of times without ever losing my initial impression of it. I must be one of the most jaded and hard to scare individuals around, as evidenced by my tendency to be the  only guy on the floor laughing during EVERY horror movie I've seen; Every  one that is, except the Exorcist, The Shining, and The Blair Witch  Project.
This is for the dim-witted; my last statement does not invite  comparision between the movies mentioned. Why? Because they can't be  compared. Three different eras, three different premises, three different  styles. Stop trying to post this movie on somebody's all-time list.
There  are a few other things you should probably stop doing. Stop whining about  the jerky video. Most of us aren't rock solid when running with cameras; I  guess you'd be the exception, right? Try taking off your foot thick glasses  and then watching the movie. Also, stop whining about not seeing the ghost.  This pathetic need of yours to locate everthing visually is a direct result  of your equally pathetic ID4 worshipping MTV idolizing, 17-hour per day TV  watching brain dead personna. You don't even realize what an imagination is  thanks to CG, you don't realize you used to have one, and you probably  can't spell it either.
If you truly understood what the hell you were  looking at when you saw the Shining (if you were old enough to get in),  you'd realize that Kubrick wasn't going for cheap shock value. It was the  clarity of sound, or lack of it. It was what you saw out of the corner of  your eye that your mind tells you shouldn't have been there. It was KNOWING  that the Torrances were the only people in the hotel, and then watching  Wendy come around a corner to see two costumed party goers engaged in  curious activity in one of the bedrooms. No Alien-style poppycock. Just  masterful construction of profound unease.
Additionally, you can shut up about Heather Donahue screaming. You see,  Heather had an imagination (there's that damned word again), and when she  used it during the film both as an actor and as the character, what she  came up with made her scream. That's what fear tends to do, especially when  you can't pinpoint it's cause. Of course, you wouldn't know about that  would you? In those situations, you just call a cop or tell the teacher,  right? Figures...
By the way. Are you still pissed because the website  said this was a true story? What a clown you are. But then I expect that,  because TV has trained you to believe everything you see and  hear, and it never occurs to you to research anything, does it? If you had,  you could have found out on the Artisan website the first week this  previewed that the so-called missing students were all in attendance at at  least one of the pre-release viewings. Why is your whole world shattered by  the fictional nature of this film? Oh I know...""They lied to us man!  They f**kin lied to us!""
To sum up, my dense target readers, the  next time you want to tell the world that a group of Marketing staff,  actors, and TRUE admirers of cinema are all idiots worshipping a poorly  made production, impress us all first by reading a book cover to cover and  then summing it up without seeing the music video. Or by seeing and walking  at the same time. Or by not spending $300-$5000 on a Tickle-Me-Elmo type  toy just because your spoiled kid demands it, everyone's doing it, and  the MEGA-HYPE coming out of the TV says you have to get it. Or perhaps you  could make your own movie on 16mm film running through woods with your  rock-steady camera, and dynamically ad-libbing an hour and a half of dialog  and raw reactions to stuff you didn't even know about.
Probably not,  huh. If it was a hit, you wouldn't be able to IMAGINE what could be done  with all that money.",940377600,,3817,4.558997050147493

1246026,4,B00001QGUL,"I would like to know more about the documentary that was NOT made in conjunction with the movie. The two young men that made the film were interviewed on Good Morning America and were asked about it. They agreed  that they thought on first viewing, that it was a lot like their movie, but  said after taking a long look at it, there were a lot of differences and  then gave the year of their copyright, which I believe was 1992. So there  is one documentary that is a companion to the movie; and one that was made  completely separate from the movie and by totally different people that  seems to have disappeared into thin air. Does anyone know anthing at all  about it?",939772800,,671,4.362903225806452
1246027,5,B00001QGUL,"I think this is going to be one of the best films for the year, if not the best.  To fully understand the end, you have to pay close attention to parts of the beginning.  However the thing that made me stop breathing was  the climax. I believe the last portion of the film was one of the most well  thought up endings I've ever seen.",938476800,,333,4.0
1246028,1,B00001QGUL,"Just as I was getting into being scared, there came them old credits and the whole audience sat there, looking at each other, saying ""What happened?""

1246029,5,B00001QGUL,"First fo all I would like to say that I have a lot of respect for the actors and actress. The had to put up with a lot during the making of this movie. I'd like to point out that improv isn''t easy to do. After I saw The  Blair Witch Project I rented The Exorcist. That isn't scary after I have  seen The Blair Witch Project. Now everyone should know that a truly scary  movie isn't based on just what's in the movie but what happens after it. If  the veiwer is not scared of what ever situation the horror movie was placed  in, then the director has not done his job well. The Blair Witch Project  makes me sscared of what I don't see and it also scare sme when I'm in the  woods.",937872000,,681,3.963235294117647
1246030,5,B00001QGUL,This movie is one that will leave a lasting impact if you have some imagination. No other movie has scared me psychologicaly like this since Lost Highway. The Blair Witch is one that is hard to sit through because it  makes you curl into your seat or just freeze until the chilling end. If it  doesn't scare you twenty minutes after it's over then you must not be a  thinker.,937440000,,375,4.328571428571428
1246031,5,B00001QGUL,"Many people expected to see another high tech movie thriller.  This wasn't meant to be a big time hit, that is why the camera work wasn't outstanding.  The point is, is that the people who made this movie dared to break the  mold of your traditional ""scary"" movie.  In that respect, it is  outstanding.  I found the plot captivating because I didn't find out it  wasn't real until after the movie.  This movie plays off of your own fears  better than any movie I have ever seen, for that reason it is an instant  classic, much in the same respect as Citizen Kane, Psyco, and so on.",937180800,,581,4.345794392523365

Anybody with 400$ to put down for  a video camera and perhaps 500$ for 16mm rental can do as good as those  guys... Great marketing, however...",937180800,,335,4.459016393442623
1246033,5,B00001QGUL,"The previews scared me to death. When I walked to the mall along one night to see this I was ready to be chilled to death and got more than that as I sat there anxiously awaiting for the next scare. The photography made it  all the more frightening and eerie, especially that final shot in the house  which made me afraid to go to the bathroom once I got back to my dorm room  about 11:30 the night I saw it. My heart pounded when Heather dashed in the  woods, screaming at something she heard over and over in the dark. Josh's  disappearance gave me the willies as night came upon Heather and Mike.  Their stumbling onto the crumbling house set the stage for more thrills and  fright as I've never seen or felt before. I can hardly wait to go see it  again and see what I missed the first time, as the audience was so immature  and couldn't keep their mouths shut while the movie played. They were too  busy necking and mimicking what was going on  and kept others from enjoying  it. My hometown in North Carolina has similar goings-on in the woods around  the town and I wonder if some scenes were even filmed there. But they  weren't. I was more affected personally than psychologically by this film  and have not seen anything so creepy or terrifying since  ""Scream."" I'm surprised freak-master Wes Craven couldn't come up  with something this horrifying and extremely realistic to a point. The  photography, sound, and editing are among the best I've seen and heard in  years in scary flicks. Sometimes you don't need a script to make a  blockbuster film such as this. The music, kept to a strong minimum, is  severely haunting and stalks the human conscience, but this film lingers in  the heart and mind long after the final fatal frame of film flashes across  the screen and Heather's demise becomes imminent. I was so scared to even  walk back to campus that late. Atlanta Highway isn't the prettiest road in  the nation. But I jumped and flinched at every sound I heard clear into the  night and could not go to sleep without seeing that final shot of one of  the boys standing in the house and Heather screaming her lungs out of  whack. I was still shaking when I woke up the next morning and saw that it  was close to time to go to church. Very few films have such a powerful  effect on me and I doubt that another film of this nature or ultimate shock  power can ever do it again. I can't wait until my own copy arrives on video  in time for Halloween. Until then I'm gonna go to the mall and see it again  so I can see what I missed the first time.",937094400,,2562,4.326315789473684

When I saw this movie, my friend told me it was an absolute true story and  these were the actual videos found.  I was so scared and amazed that I was  scared because you really never see anything bad happen.  The ending left  me not knowing whether I liked it or not, but I absolutely loved the  originality of it.  A definite movie to see -- only once.",936921600,,504,4.02020202020202

They're both in working order and its so good to finally have the docu that made my experience with this movie even better. As a kid, I watched the Curse of the Blair Witch a few days before going to see the movie. You have to understand that MTV was portraying all this as a true story and not just entertainment. This docu made me believe in more, what with the news reels and family reaction interviews, that the blair witch was real and these woods we're the most frightening thing I had ever even heard of.  I won't ever forget how terrifying the movie was, going into it, believing it 100%. Kids today just don't know, and won't ever know.

Problem?  Credibility of their actions--they are supposedly intelligent young people.  On the 2nd (or 3rd?) day someone has the bright and practical idea of following the sizable stream they are by DOWNSTREAM!  Why not! Of course that would have led them to nearby civilization.

7914698,5,B00001QGUL,"I must say that this movie was undoubtedly one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen. Why?
Simple, it allowed me to use the full power of my imagination by employing the least amount of inspiration to do so. In short, if you don't have a good imagination then this movie will do little to scare you. But, if you do have a good imagination watch out, this movie will really conjure up them age old emotions that tells us to fear the 'thing that goes bump in the night'. The film didn't have a large budget to work with so the special effects are nearly non-exsistent. However, I believe this is just another reaon why it was so good.  You never really see a witch, or other ungodly creature, yet you KNOW bad things are happening.  Many horror movies rely on good special effects (i.e., digitally created monsters and demons) to make them appealing, but, in my opinion, many fail removing credibility, hence The Blair Witch's most effective scare tactic is more the experience of what you DON'T see instead of what you do see.
One of the other reasons why I loved this movie so much was its untraditional format. Its documentary style adds real credence, and gives the movie a distinct form of realism that I have yet to see in many other movies. The acting is REALLY superb, and the imagery of the movie I could identify with. I spent much time in my life camping deep in the woods. And living in the Midwest, the scenes were pages right out of my own life.
This movie is destined to be an all time Halloween classic in my family, one of which I will watch every year when the leaves turn color, and the days run short. If you do get this movie, be sure to watch it at night with all the lights off in your house. Many of the scenes are shot in the darkness, and this will help the movie have greater impact on the viewing experience.  Also, for maximum affect you want to have a hi-fidelity sound system (DVD is best) and listen to the audio track very carefully. Much of the movie's best scare tactics are experienced more by what you hear then by what you see...and this is precisely what sets it apart from any other horror movie ever made.
The entire movie is experienced through the viewfinder of a video camera, all in which puts you right there with the three doomed travelers, dragging you into the fray.  The film's real horror grips you when you actually stop and think about what these three people are going through, and the hopelessness you would feel if you were in the same predicament.
Lastly, the dialog, although profane at times, is very realistic, and furthermore makes the movie just that much more believable.
A totally cool Halloween experience!

7914699,1,B00001QGUL,"I love the idea of creating a mytholgy or urban legen with the Blair Witch character. I loved the whole idea behind in the beginning. I believe that was the best part of this BWP phenomenon.
The film itself started off all well and good, but soon became repititious arguing and swearing. I agree with another person who posted here who said that the movie lacked scenes that were scary to the viewer. This is very true. I believe a movie has to give visual clues as to what's happening in order to for the ""horror"" element to work. I also believed this has to occur to suffiently get ones imagination to take part in the film. Many have posted here saying that the film allows a person to use their imagination in the film, but that's just very problem..there is too much left for the imagination. It IS a movie after all. Half the time I didn't know what the hell was going on.  I watched this on my vcr instead of going to see this in the theaters, and I had to constantly rewind back to certain parts, especially towards the end to figure out what just happened.
I just don't get why people claim this movie was ""Scary as Hell"" as it says on the box which the video came in. Ok, perhaps if you and a couple of friends were really walking in the woods and came across some rocks and sticks formed weirdly it would scare you. But, you aren't in the woods with them, you are merely a spectator in an event that's really dumb to be honest. I mean, if you were lost in the woods (because a one guy got mad and threw the map away..smart move) Would you keep rolling the tape even though you don't know where you are going? And further more would you keep it going after you are chased by some psycho? I think if the makers could strech the idea of people filming while they are running in terror, it wouldn't have been too much for us to see a little bit of an indication of what it was that was after them.
I aplaud the efforts of trying to do something different with movie making, and enjoyed the concept of the film though. Let's hope the next installment is better than the first.",969667200,3,2082,4.231155778894473
7914700,4,B00001QGUL,"I'm getting tired of people complaining about camera bouncing, amateurish shots, etc.  That was the whole point of the movie!  Unedited shots made by  the documentary filmakers (students) themselves.
I thought this film  was wonderful!  Too many films now adays rely too much on blood and gore.  This film made you think, use your imagination, much as you would in the  old horror films of the past.  No special FX, no big names, just an  interesting premise and good acting.
I think that because the ending left  so many unanswered questions, that is the reason that so many people  disliked it.  There was no closure.  But, hey, not many movies (not since  the empire strikes back <is Darth Vader Luke's father, etc>) have a  movie left the watcher hanging the way this one did.  And, love it or hate  it, how many will go see the sequel?  I know I will  :).

7914701,4,B00001QGUL,"The Blair Witch Project is disquieting because of the video footage that  comes from the disappeared students. Disquieting too because of all the   antecedents . The original witch was Irish and catholic in a totally  protestant and probably WASP community. She was destined to be rejected.  She was accused of being a witch but she was not banned, she was taken to  the woods and tied up to a tree in the middle of the winter, for her to die  of exposure. The stake might have been an easier and less cruel method.  Then the fifty or sixty year cycle seems to be surprising. But apart from  some tombstones, or the man who was hanged in 1941, the whole case revolves  on hear-say and rumors, hence on superstitions. But it is true there are a  lot of those in America. Stephen King regularly uses such cases to sustain  his books, for example, The Storm of the Century. Disquieting too because  of the authoritative voices that are provided in the accompanying  documentary : documents, sheriff, specialists on the subject, historians,  and even a male witch of today. It is a film we must see and watch and  study to maybe understand two essential human procedures : how a  superstition is built and how the supernatural is always called in when man  does not understand something. We may come to the conclusion that the  supernatural does exist. And this conclusion might be right. We do not know  much about the world and our traditional scientific and pragmatist approach  of life has made us very narrow-minded as for anything that is not kosher  scientifically. But in many cases, like this one our empiricist approach  traps us into having to accept the  facts  and yet not knowing what to do  with them. Hence, among many simple people, we find a lot of interest,  fascination and fear in front of such disquieting  facts . There remains  one element : this Blair witch case started with a clear and horrifying  human injustice : a woman, Irish, catholic and hence different, was accused  by children and the whole community accepted those children's testimonies  and put the woman to death. That can only create a deeply-rooted collective  guilt that then produces the sequels. The only really attested sequel is  the serial killer of 1940 hanged in 1941. In his case, the collective guilt  became a haunting voice : he projected himself into the  witch . Humanity  often creates its own problems by acts of injustice and by  narrow-mindedness as for natural phenomena reduced to their explainable  parts. Then the rest is phantasizing, at times criminal, on the basis of  the unexplainable parts of these natural phenomena.
