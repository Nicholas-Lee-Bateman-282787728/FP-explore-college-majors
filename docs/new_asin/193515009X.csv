If you believe that no greater glory exists than the process of overcoming the ""self"" through sheer Will! To break through the Judeo-christian birth sack and stand up in the cold lonely chasm of reality! To undo one ""self"" and be one of the few to ever breath FREE! What bobbles are footsteps on the moon when you can walk the earth as one of the first real HUMAN beings. To laugh in the face of strife as it is nothing but morter for battlements of your psychological spires! To overcome yourself is to overcome EVERYTHING because it is an illusion!

  If you can sense a ""you"" that deserves more than spitting out nonsense and killing time AKA your life then choose the following! Undoing DVDs and book, Hyatt Black Books, Psychopath's Bible and To Lie is Human.  ""Become a work of Art"" or be left behind!",1264809600,5,936,4.482352941176471
7901771,5,193515009X,"This product introduced me to the wide world of Dr. Hyatt and Radical Undoing. After doing the exercises within, I understood all of the material in Dr. Hyatt's other books in far greater detail. This DVD series turned the information in Hyatt's books into knowledge and wisdom.

Of course, it only works if you DO IT! So, most people who buy this product will NEVER actually do the exercises in it consistently enough to make any difference. If you think you have the fortitude and discipline required to tread this path, buy at your own risk.

It takes time and practice and effort to really do it. And it takes a long time.

Through buying this DVD, I ended up meeting Dr. Hyatt, appearing in the later releases of this and the Energized Hypnosis system, and attending his last two workshops before he died, earlier this year.

Get it while you can.

Enjoy.",1223251200,8,860,4.594771241830065
