8190279,4,6303542182,"This was one of Bardot's last films, shot in the early 70's.

She is full of life and throws her energy and spirit into this

lightweight film. Claudia Cardinale is also in high spirits. Both have a charisma that carries the film, though the supporting cast give uneven performances. Bardot has a mature beauty in the film, with riveting eyes. The plot revolves around an Outlaw (Bardot)hiding out in a town, pretending to be a Doctor. Later, both women find out that there is oil on a property and fight over the land. The film is poorly dubbed, but much of the humor still translates into English. Bardot made two more films in '73, and then walked away from the silver screen forever. Most actresses hang on to their fame long after it has passed them by. Bardot is a class act, and used the rest of her life to help animal rights causes. She had a flair for comedy, and Frenchy King is a fun western.",1096070400,4,904,4.407185628742515
