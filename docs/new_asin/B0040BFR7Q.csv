I understand why other may have posted negative reviews, but if one looks at this as a BASIC introduction to guitar it will be helpful. It is NOT a comprehensive lesson. No matter what home lesson system you use, you'll pretty much need to try more than one. I love 80's hair metal humor and its got that. You won't be able to shred on a guitar after this video, but I think you'll learn a lot of concepts in a short period of time.",1513555200,,476,4.129032258064516
8496749,1,B0040BFR7Q,"At no point during this video that I actually learn anything about guitars or playing. I watch this video I could not play guitar at all, but now I'm somehow worse at guitar. This video includes puppets talking guitars and a man who just nothing but Shout. But nothing tells you how to play guitar. If you buy this, God have mercy on your soul.",1510272000,,344,4.3076923076923075
