3546804,2,B001E75PJ4,"Having just watched ""The Spirit of the Marathon,"" I was hoping for something similar.

This is not it.

Slow, boring, tedious. It's about the creator, but not about the process of running. As a lay person, for me, the NYC Marathon to me is much more famous than the Boston Marathon, I'll give them that. Getting more into running, I realize now why Boston is so much more elite and special, however, if I were to run a marathon, I'd want to run New York, and going through the boroughs sounds amazing and an incredible way to see the city. I would have loved to have seen a group of people preparing for that, with blurbs about how it came to be and the history.

I finally turned this off when we got to the video footage of the guy partying it up in the club. What does that have to do with running, running lifestyle, the NYC Marathon or it's history?

Disappointing to say the least. This was clearly supposed to be a biography of the guy, but it wasn't a strong subject to hold people's attention. If you had done a few blurbs about him, and focused more on what he ACCOMPLISHED, it would have been so much better.",1369526400,,1119,4.289099526066351
3546805,4,B001E75PJ4,It was fast paced and linked me in to the history of a sister sport to my passion: triathlon! A well-told fantastic story.,1364515200,2,122,4.3478260869565215
3546806,5,B001E75PJ4,"If you are a runner, take two hours (or so) and get to know the history a little. The history of modern road racing for the millions of people of all abilities, around the world who run marathons (especially inner-city marathons) is looked at here. I think an ""intelligent"" runner is better off knowing more of the whole game. This may not be about training, or world records per se, but while touching both of these areas it describes the higgen game of marathoning. It describes how the NYC Marathon evolved and had influenced other BIG marathons: Moscow, London, Tokyo, et cetera.

As well as going over the history and looking at the life of Fred Lebow, the man that has probably changed your life if you are an inner-city runner now, it is (for me) very motivational as some of the worlds top runners are shown and talk to us, the viewers, about how the marathon had evolved.

Brilliant !!!!! More than a 5 star from this runner. But an academically inclined runner? Perhaps . . . Just enjoy getting to know the sport a bit better  :)",1321574400,7,1039,4.4867724867724865
3546807,2,B001E75PJ4,We did not care too much for this one.  In fact we never even finished watching the entire movie.,1299196800,,97,4.105263157894737

3546809,4,B001E75PJ4,"I find it fascinating to read or watch documentaries on running in the early days, seeing what they went through and where the sport eventually got to.  In Run For Your Life you not only get a biography of Fred Lebow, but you also get a bio of the NYC Marathon.  I would dare say also that the big city marathon owes a lot of thanks to the pioneer trail blazed by Lebow and the NYC Marathon, allowing more runners to accomplish something as sweet as running 26.2 miles and making it accessible to all.

What I liked about this documentary were the first hand accounts from all those who were there in the beginning.  Those hard core running fanatics who were considered nuts for what they were doing.  We got to hear what they did before, during and after the NYC Marathon was started which adds a lot to the history of the sport.  Additionally I enjoyed the video footage that helped visualize through the years where the marathon was and what the runners were doing.  Arguably you could say that the beginning days of the marathon did a lot in furthering the sport as big name runners such as Rodgers, Salazar and Waitz brought the press in to the mix and in to the public eye.

Some downsides to the documentary, and I didn't find many, were there were some inconsistencies that made you wonder.  Would you really tolerate a vendor charging you twice and not only not get upset but think that that made them smart and thus wanted to do business with them?  Boston is arguably the more famous marathon in the world and yet they would say that the NYC Marathon is.  Why would you go in to a meeting after hearing you lost money and say that you hoped you lost twice as much?

Overall I thought this was a great documentary for the sport and for Lebow and the NYC Marathon.  Despite some character flaws you can't help but like Lebow and by the end of the documentary I felt I understood who the man was.  Additionally, and this is often how I rate a running book or documentary, I felt like not only running but I wanted to sign up for a marathon and feel the sense of accomplishment all over again.  A definite recommend for runners and history buffs alike.

4 stars.",1256947200,4,2169,4.371571072319202
3546810,2,B001E75PJ4,"""Running for Your Life"" is a somewhat tedious documentary about Freed Lebow and his pivotal role in starting and growing the New York City Marathon.  The film aims to mythologize and lionize Lebow and aggrandize the NYC Marathon.  For example, near the beginning of the movie, one commentator says that the NYC Marathon is the most famous marathon in the world.

Certain folks in Boston might rightly take issue with that.

Lebow to me comes off as a rather pitiable character.  No wife.  No kids.  Married to his job.  He pursues serial relationships with young honeys but confesses that, once the thrill of the chase is gone, he gets bored with women.  He tolerated selected vendors double-billing and ripping off the Road Runners Club.  What a guy!

An undercurrent of this self-absorbed film is the notion that, since the event relates to The Big Apple, it must by definition be hot $%&*.  From this movie, you'd think that designing a footrace to run through all five NYC boroughs is up there with the Seven Wonders of the World.

Please!!

After about an hour, the documentary is up to the 1978 NYC Marathon and you may be stealing glances at your watch.

IF you are a hard core historian of distance running lore or of the NYC Marathon, you may enjoy this movie, which only lasts 95 minutes but which, to me, seemed much longer.",1230249600,7,1335,4.645299145299146
3546811,5,B001E75PJ4,"We owe the big-city marathon as it exists today to Fred Lebow, the subject of this documentary.  His vision of what he wanted the NYC Marathon to be changed the way marathons are organized around the world.

This film looks at Fred and his life, specifically looking at the period from 1969 (the last year of the Cherry Tree Marathon in the Bronx, the precursor to the NYC Marathon) through the time of Fred's untimely death from brain cancer in 1994.  There is amazing archival footage in the film and wonderful interview with those heavily involved in the marathon in the early years.

As a runner and NYC Marathon finisher, I found this film fascinating, though anyone who has an interest in history, New York City, and biographies of interesting individuals would greatly enjoy this movie.",1227916800,15,793,4.8088235294117645
