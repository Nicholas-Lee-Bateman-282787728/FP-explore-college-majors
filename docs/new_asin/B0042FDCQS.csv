With that said, I found this movie entertaining, historically accurate, the acting was believable (key to a good movie) and a GREAT movie for both men and women, all around solid 5 stars.  I would watch it again.",1511308800,,374,4.391304347826087

8413565,1,B0042FDCQS,"I ordered the bluray and the copy I received stuttered and froze about three minutes in.  The seller was terrific and replaced the disc with a new one without hassle. Unfortunately, the second disk did the same thing.  I think I'll just purchase the regular DVD next time and see if it works.  I really do want to see this movie.",1394323200,,329,4.360655737704918
8413566,2,B0042FDCQS,"Being a huge fan of vintage stock car racing, I gave this a try despite all of the poor reviews.  I figured I would be happy to see some vintage cars and maybe some good race scenes, even if the movie itself was mediocre.  It really is a bad movie.  The acting is terrible, the plot is non-existent.  It isn't really even interesting from a historical standpoint.",1357603200,,363,4.373134328358209
8413567,4,B0042FDCQS,"Great service, and I would order from this vendor again. The disc became loose during shipping and arrived with two small scratches on the recorded side. That has not seemed to bother the playability. I did not call and complain to the vendor, I wanted to see if it would play first. It did, and I am happy.",1316563200,,307,4.310344827586207
8413568,5,B0042FDCQS,"If you are not familiar with NASCAR history and where it came from after WWII, this film is good. Nothing else in film is available to my knowledge. Only in a few books...",1300406400,2,171,4.212121212121212
8413569,5,B0042FDCQS,"Not only is this a wholesome, fun, family movie, but it also has some great early racing action in it.  I enjoyed watching it at the premiere in Thomasville, NC and at home with the DVD.  You see as someone who helped in the production and along with her two boys was an extra in the last racing scenes of the movie, this movie is just dear to my heart.  As for Amazon's performance, I would highly recommend them to anyone.  I was pleased to find the item in stock and was appreciative of how smooth the transaction was and how quick my product arrived.",1299456000,3,554,4.247619047619048
