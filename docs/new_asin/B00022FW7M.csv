2056244,5,B00022FW7M,This was a gift for my husband who loves old television programs. It was just in time for Christmas and was really enjoyed by everyone. Thank you.,1232496000,,146,4.444444444444445
2056245,5,B00022FW7M,It was the best of times for television. If ever life seems unfair this collection will keep you laughing for a long time. Give this collection to anyone young or old and they will thank you forever.,1181174400,,199,4.405405405405405
2056246,4,B00022FW7M,"Not as uproariously funny as the 1st collection of 18 legendary episodes, but still far above most anything seen that is called comedy on television today. Here is a real master in the mold of Chaplain, Keating and, yes, the Marx Brothers.",1127001600,,239,4.714285714285714
2056247,3,B00022FW7M,"Your Show Of Shows was a ground-breaking series, although what's left of it is admittedly in kinescope-type quality rather than good I Love Lucy film quality. But still, unless you can get these current releases at a great discount, I'll recommend that everyone wait until YSOS finally comes out on Complete Seasons DVDs.

That is because when it comes to a giant of comedy like the mighty Caesar, verily it shall be worth thy wait!",1102982400,,432,4.76
2056248,5,B00022FW7M,This has to be what must have inspired Saturday Night Live.  Only with this one the episodes are funnier.  Even if you eliminate the time factor here...this show was produced in the fifties..it's still holds up as a great show that's actually funny to watch the second time around.  That was the great thing about Sid Ceasar...if you notice his samurai skits were stolen from none other than John Belusi of Saturday Night Live.  If you get the chance to see any of these classics watch Sid's impression of the japanese samuri and Belusi's...this is where he got his inspiration....,1093392000,,581,4.78
8020547,5,B00022FW7M,Way fun-- but most of these shows were lost-- SAD!,1482624000,,50,4.1
8020548,5,B00022FW7M,"Just watched the first disc and found it hysterically funny. Particularly the sketches La Bicycletta, Pantomime Cocktail Party, and The Bellini Cup.
The genius of Mel Brooks, Neil Simon and company are all over these sketches as well as the talents of Sid Caesar, Carl Reiner and Imogene Coca.
Can't wait to watch the rest!",1479686400,,323,4.890909090909091
8020549,4,B00022FW7M,Sid was a genius at comedy.  I don't know if today's viewers can appreciate how great unless they watch carefully how he designs each skit.  Imogene Coca was right up there with him in intelligent humor.  I love how funny a comedian can be without spewing filth to get a cheap laugh.,1411430400,,283,4.403846153846154
8020550,5,B00022FW7M,Sid Caesar's buried collection is outrageously funny.,1410220800,,53,6.714285714285714
8020551,1,B00022FW7M,Not what I expected. Should have read more about the package,1408233600,,60,4.545454545454546
8020552,5,B00022FW7M,classic footage you won't find anywhere else.  historic.  vintage.  the roots of comedy.  this truly is buried treasure.  laughs galore.,1403913600,,136,5.6
8020553,5,B00022FW7M,Enjoyed seeing Sid Caesar at his all time best! He is timeless and will watch again and again. Great for the whole family.,1395273600,,122,4.3478260869565215
8020554,3,B00022FW7M,"Good overview of the shows I saw as a kid. I would have preferred the whole shows, and not just the skits and then commentary. A separate disc for commentary would have sufficed.",1382745600,,178,4.424242424242424
8020555,5,B00022FW7M,"For people who like really well written comedy sketches and want to see a comic genius at work with remarkable players then this is a collection you should have on your shelf. These shows essentially are the roots of TV variety show comedy, maybe even beyond that. The writers for these shows are like a who's who of comedy writers including the likes of Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Danny Simon, Woody Allen and the list goes on. The ability of Sid to become almost anyone in any sketch is worth the price of admission alone. And if I start to name the individual players in his cast I fear I'm sure to leave someone out, due to my faulty memory.
  So ... by all means buy this jewel because make no mistake it is that. Sad to say, we'll not ever see the like of this kind of great sketch comedy again. It ended with Carol and Harvey and Tim. But Sid and his pals started it all and now you can bear witness to just how great it was when you watch this collection. Enjoy.",1368057600,,967,4.193548387096774
8020556,5,B00022FW7M,"When I was a kid, The whole family watched Your Show Of Shows with Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca. And By Golly, it was the funniest show on TV. And it was Live. Not like today where everything is taped ahead and all vocals are lip synced, because none of these new so called singers of today can sing live. And the reason is...THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE CHOPS TO SING LIVE! AND THAT'S THE TRUTH. And also, I bet 99% of them don't even know what keys they sing in. I totally recommend anything to watch of these very talented people. Frank",1365033600,,534,4.194174757281553
