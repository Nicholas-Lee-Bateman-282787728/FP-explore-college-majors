7801673,1,1933233168,"I repeat:  I love Lady Bird.  I also love documentaries.  And this DVD is almost unwatchable.  Did the filmmaker think that the subject - or her husband LBJ - were so interesting that he could cobble together random footage, which seems wholly unedited (i.e., average, too long, without focus) and have a good documentary?  I was sadly disappointed in this film.

If anyone is interested in Lady Bird, I recommend a television biography of this prescient woman, who had a tremendous impact on maintaining the natural beauty of the U.S.  It was broadcast on PBS many years ago, as part of a series on First Ladies (it included shows on Eleanor Roosevelt and Jacqueline Kennedy, as well).  It was excellent.",1391558400,2,705,4.816666666666666
