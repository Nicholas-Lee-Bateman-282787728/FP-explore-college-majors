3135695,5,B0014VPFKY,"What a relief when found out this Second Season to be release this Jun,
Thanks",1206921600,2,78,4.266666666666667
3135696,5,B0014VPFKY,I REALLY LOVE THIS SHOW I DON'T SEE WHY ALL OF THE FANS HAVE TO WAIT A WHOLE YEAR TO BY CHIPS 2ND SEASON.  WHY WHY,1206576000,2,114,3.3846153846153846
3135697,5,B0014VPFKY,"I sincerely can't wait for season 2. I really enjoyed the trip down memory lane with season 1 last year. The only thing was most of the episodes in Season 1 I didn't really recognize, or remember seeing, except for the episode where they do a job in I think it's Malibu for a week or so. Another thing was the theme song in season 1, it wasn't the theme song I remember. I remember a pulsating bassline, and only the main part of the song being played. I guess they remixed the song after the first season and really made it sound a lot better. What I wanna know is when does Ponch get his awesome car? I remember him having this gold camaro during the show, and not driving a motorhome as his main vehicle.

I am really looking forward to season 2, and I would definitely recommend season 2 to anyone who enjoyed season 1 as much as I did. It's gonna be great. Can't wait for June.",1204848000,3,882,4.157894736842105
3135698,4,B0014VPFKY,"It's about time they finally got the 1978-79 Season of this police drama on DVD along with the fact that this was the season when Ponch(Erik Estrada) & Jon(Larry Wilcox)really hit their stride & when I started watching CHiPs a lot more often, especially when this season kicked off in the Fall of 1978 which was only a year later from when this police drama made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1977.

In fact this season takes me all the way back to memory lane to my childhood days when CHiPs was on NBC every Saturday night & when this show became even more popular, especially since this season is even better, more upgraded, and quite a bit more sophisticated than the First Season was with more action, more co-stars, more accidents, and had major improvement on both the CHiPs music scoring and improvement on the CHiPs theme song from it's 1977-78 Season along with the fact that this season had even more viewers than the 1st Season did.

This 1978-1979 Season is also the season when CHiPs was moved to Saturdays & when Brianne Leary joins the cast & crew as Jon & Ponch's spunky fellow CHP Officer Sindy Cahill which was eventually replaced by Randi Oakes as Officer Bonnie Clark as the new 7-Charles in the 3rd Season since this was the only season with Sindy, plus this was the season when Lou Wagner joined the cast & crew as CHP mechanic(Harlan Arliss)making this the first year that this show had a female co-star and a special CHP technician.

Therefore; Sindy & Harlan made each episode in this season more sophisticated, especially episodes like ""Family Crisis"", ""Trick Or Trick"", ""High Flyer"", ""The Sheik"", ""Return Of The Turks"", ""Supercycle"", ""High Explosive"", ""Down Time"", ""Repo Man"", ""Pressure Point"", ""Bio-Rhythms"", ""Rally 'Round The Bank"", ""The Matchmakers"", ""Ride The Whirlwind"", ""The Greatest Adventures Of CHiPs"", etc.

The 2nd Season of this police drama is also the season when Ponch gets his first car, which was his bronze Pontiac Firebird & when Ponch gets his very first apartment at the Marina when he sells his RV trailer that Ponch was living at in the 1st Season along with the fact that this is also the season when Jon gets his brand new 4-wheel drive GMC stepside pick-up which was a major upgrade from the tiny white sports car that he had in the First Season.

Therefore, it was kind of like seeing Randi Oakes going from a bad guy to a good guy, since she was a criminal working against Ponch and Jon in the ""Down Time"" episode and then she was a cop and fellow CHP officer working with Ponch and Jon in the following season, starting with the ""Roller Disco"" episode with the exception of the ""High Octane"" episode, since Sindy was in that episode instead of Bonnie for some reason.

The Second Season of CHiPs is also the last season with California Highway Patrol Officer Gene Fritz(Lew Saunders), which got replaced by CHP Officer(Jeb Turner)as the new 7-David in the Third Season.

The truth is, I actually preferred Bonnie to her predecessor(Sindy)and thought Bonnie was better looking and more sophisticated than Sindy was, but I really missed Sindy when she left this show and got replaced by Bonnie in the 1979-80 Season of CHiPs and I wish that Bonnie and Sindy could've co-starred together on CHiPs as fellow officers of one another, kind of like Deputy Enos Strate(Sonny Shroyer)and Deputy Cletus Hogg(Rick Hurst)did temporarily in the first few episodes of THE DUKES OF HAZZARD's 5th Season and kind of like Officers Vince Romano(Adrian Zmed) and Jim Corrigan(James Darren) did at one time on TJ HOOKER before Romano departed from that show, but Sindy wasn't bad looking either and made the 2nd Season episodes more interesting with her smile, her perkiness, her sweet personality, her participation in cases with Jon and Ponch, etc., which gave me something to look back on and compare to to look back on the days when Sindy was on the show before Bonnie even came along, which helped us see how much a lot of things had changed between Jon's first 2 years on the show and Jon's last 2 years on this police drama throughout its whole 1977-83 run on NBC.

I also liked seeing guest stars like
*Randi Oakes playing a crook in the ""Down Time"" episode as a guest star before her co-starring days on CHiPs as Ponch & Jon's foxy fellow officer(Bonnie Clark)in the following season.

*Mills Watson in the ""Repo Man"" episode before his co-starring days as Deputy Perkins on SHERIFF LOBO who also previously guest starred in the ""Rustling"" episode in the 1st Season.

*Michael Conrad in the ""Biorhythms"" episode before his co-starring days as Sgt. Phil Esterhaus on the police drama HILL STREET BLUES

*Mary Crosby in the ""Pressure Point"" episode before her co-starring days on DALLAS

*Charles Brill in the ""Neighborhood Watch"" episode before his co-starring days as Capt. Lipschitz on the police drama SILK STALKINGS and before his co-starring days on the short-lived TV series SUPERTRAIN

*Markie Post in the ""Rally Round The Bank"" episode before her co-starring days on NIGHT COURT and THE FALL GUY

*Chris Knight in the ""Family Crisis"" episode after his co-starring days as Peter Brady on THE BRADY BUNCH

*Laurie Hendler in the ""Neighborhhod Watch"" episode before her co-starring days on GIMME A BREAK

*Eric Braeden in the ""Mait Team"" episode before his co-starring days as the often bitter(Victor Newman) on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Danny Bonaduce in the ""Family Crisis"" episode after his co-starring days as Danny Patridge on THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY

*Ken Kercheval in the ""High Explosive"" episode during his co-starring days on DALLAS

*Jim Houghton in the ""Return of the Turks"" episode during his co-starring days on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Beatrice Colen in the ""Trick Or Trick"" episode after her co-starring days as Diana's spunky colleague(Etta)on WONDER WOMAN

*Robbie Rist in the ""Neighborhood Watch"" episode after his BRADY BUNCH days, etc.

*Jonathan Goldsmith in the ""High Explosive"" episode before his co-starring days on DALLAS

In addition to that, this 1978-79 Season of CHiPs DVD is quite a bit more upgraded with better subtitles than CHiPs-Season 1 DVD on top of that.

So if you liked the First Season of this police drama, you'll definetly like the Second Season, especially since the 1978-79 Season is a serious upgrade from the 1977-78 Season along with the fact that CHiPs Second Season is a lot better than CHiPs First Season hands down, which most CHiPs fans would agree with me on.

Hopefully, we won't have to wait this long for them to put the 3rd Season of CHiPs on DVD, not to mention the 1979-80 Season was even more upgraded than the first 2 Seasons of CHiPs and hopefully it won't take as long to get CHiPs Third Season released on DVD as it did to get CHiPs First and Second Seasons released on DVD, especially since CHiPs 2nd Season didn't even get put on DVD until a year after CHiPs 1st Season was.

In fact, it would be a perfect holiday or X-Mas gift if they were to release CHiPs-Season 3 on DVD by the end of November in order to be here just in time for X-Mas this year, so hopefully we'll get lucky enough to get the 1979-80 Season of CHiPs on DVD by the end of 2008, since me and most other CHiPs fans would like to see the remaining 4 seasons of CHiPs released on DVD in the near future, starting with CHiPs 3rd Season, since CHiPs 1st and 2nd Seasons are already on DVD.

Something else that baffled me about this season was, they goofed in the ""High Flyer"" episode Ponch was afraid to fly and kept trying to find ways to avoid being selected for air patrol with CHP pilot Officer Bob Patterson(John Ericson), but in the previous season, in the ""Career Day"" episode Ponch jumped right up and volunteered to go on air patrol in a CHP chopper after he got in trouble with Getraer for breaking his motorcycle at the High School where Ponch was asked to do a presentation for the students on career day, which made absolutley no sense.

Something else that I couldn't help finding odd was in the ""High Flyer"" episode when Ponch finally goes on air patrol in the CHP chopper with Patterson towards the end of the episode, Ponch spots the tan Ford van that Ponch and Jon were pursuing the first 2 times towards the beginning of that episode, but when Ponch spots that tan Ford van from the chopper, Ponch tells Jon that it was a brown Chevy van that the car stripping thieves used when they tried to kill Ponch & Jon while trying to get away from them during Jon & Ponch's 2nd hot pursuit in the ""High Flyer"" episode.

In addition to why I couldn't help being baffled about Ponch telling Jon it was the same brown Chevy van instead of the same Ford van that the car strippers used to get away from Ponch & Jon, a Ford van looks nothing at all like a Chevy van, especially since Ford & Chevy are competitors, so why would Ponch say it's a Chevy van if it was obviously a Ford van that they'd been pursuing, especially after they chased it twice in the ""High Flyer"" episode.

CHiPs 2nd Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""NBSee Us"", since that was the slogan for NBC from the Autumn of 1978 thru the Summer of 1979.

It's just too bad that this CHiPs-Season 2 DVD didn't have a bonus episode from the 3rd Season kind of like Universal does with a lot of their TV DVD box sets like Universal did with KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 3, MAGNUM, PI-SEASON 6, THE A-TEAM-SEASON 4, THE ROCKFORD FILES-SEASON 3, THE ROCKFORD FILES-SEASON 4, MAGNUM-SEASON 3; etc.

Fortunately, I can now add this Sophomore year season of CHiPs to my DVD collection of ADAM-12, DRAGNET, HUNTER, and Freshman year season of CHiPS on top of that, plus you can see all these episodes of CHiPs complete & uncut & commercial-free without all those deleted scenes you'd get when CHiPs was shown in reruns on TBS, TNT, and now MeTV.",1204502400,16,9824,4.6476355247981544

3135762,4,B0014VPFKY,"CHiPs is a dramatic, often funny, and very entertaining TV series to watch. I enjoy viewing it very much. I don't like every episode but I have many favorites here. The show basically zeroes in on 2 motorcycle police officers as they zip along the state highway, zig zagging through traffic often at very high speeds,  catching speeders, the bad guys, and helping people in need. Sometimes very very serious plots take place (The Sheik is a good example) and often many humorous situations occur. For a  70's show it is very dramatic and fast paced. The two officers are played by Larry Wilcox and Erik Estrada and they often have to report to their superior officer Sgt. Getraer who is played by Robert Pine. Other unique characters also make it to be a very interesting  and fun cast.",1412985600,,786,4.640287769784172
3135763,4,B0014VPFKY,"We just finished watching Season Two episode ""The Sheik"" on MeTV and it created quite a heated discussion in our house. At the end of the episode when the Sheik tries to give Ponch and Jon new Mercedes and they cannot accept them because they are gifts...but they ALREADY egregiously disregarded the rules about accepting gifts and gratuities when they attended the champagne and caviar yacht party the reckless driving above-the-law Sheik gave!  Several episodes earlier they wouldn't even accept invitations to a disco party given by a car dealership.

It came up because it was only last week in the nail salon almost everyone present was just sickened by these two gals that worked for the Dallas D.A.'s office bragging loudly (to impress everyone) about all the gratuities they received just by saying they were from the DA's office, like hotel discounts, bump-ups to first class on airlines, free meals; imagine how pissed off they were that the manicurist wouldn't give them a discount...but as members of the DA's office, they are  law enforcement officials.  Of course no one expects much else from our hopelessly corrupt DA's office, I guess CHP wasn't much different back then, or perhaps just no one reviewed the scripts for accuracy. I hated seeing Ponch and Jon put in such an unethical position by writers who didn't know any better.

3135771,5,B0014VPFKY,"What's not to love?  I'm having fun introducing my 9 yr old son to CHIPS as I was 8 when it premiered back in 1978.  He loves the show, its super clean cut by today's standards and in 5 seasons, they only had to pull their gun 3 times! What's even more interesting is to see that CA traffic on the highways was always terrible...even back then.  Also, as they go by a part of the expressway, you can use Google Earth or maps in satellite view and see what they have built up around that freeway since then.  I know... a little too techie..... but my son had fun actually seeing their HQ (police station) on the show and finding it on Google Earth.  Just gives a different dimension to watching the show.  As a call goes out, my son sees how far away it is from them and sees the surrounding areas.

Ok..I've gotten a little off track...... if you want to see 4 wheeled roller skates, feathered hair, leisure suits opened with big gold chains on hairy chests, AMC Pacers, early running shorts with tube socks pulled up over the shins and of course disco music intertwined with the action...its great.",1409788800,2,1099,4.357843137254902

3135776,5,B0014VPFKY,"As  a  kid  I  never  really  watched  the  show  that  much.  Up  until  the  year  2000,  &  I  started  getting  curious  about  the  show.  Erik  Estrada  never  does  loose  his  sense  of  humor.  Knows  how  to  keep  on  smiling.  I  like  the  show.
They  do  manage  to  fix  every  accident.  Frank  &  John  are  not  only  partners  but  the  best  of  friends.  It  is  an  interesting  show.  Perfect  kind  of  show  for  some  of  the  episodes  to  use  in  defensive  driving!  Thats  the  right  way  to  point  stuff  out  to  some  people  out  there  on  the  highway!  Theirs  not  much  violence  like  some  of  todays  shows.
They  never  have  to  use  their  guns.  I've  never  really  understood  why.
But  a  lot  of  the  episodes  are  funny.  &  they  make  me  laugh. The  only  thing  that  bothers  me  a  little  bit, is  that  only  seasons  one  &  two  On  DVD seem  to  be  available.  What  about  the  rest  of  the  seasons?  In  case  anyone  asks  me,  Yes  I  think  its  worth  it!!  I'd  like  to  see  seasons  3,4,5,6!!  Please  put  them  on  display.  I'd  sure  like  to  have  them!!!!!!! I  got  a  lot  of  fond  memories.  &  episodes  I  miss.  They  kept  the  show  running  a  long  time  before  they  got  rid  of  it,  I  mean  before  it  stopped  coming  on  TV.  They're  doing  that  with  a  lot  of  shows  today,  more  &  more  of  them  keep  dissappearing.  &  I  don't  know  why!
I  thought  seasons  1 &  2  were  definitely  worth  watching.  But  no  one  wants  to  watch  them  over  &  over  again  while  we  wait  for  the  other  seasons  to  come  out.  If  I  had  all  seasons  I'd  watch  each  one,  one  at  a  time.  I  prefer  to  go  through  any  show  that  way.  I  like  the  theme  song  the  best.
My  only  complaint  about  both  seasons  one  &  two  is  the  discs  are  hard  to  get  to.  Them  being  on  top  of  each  other  like  they  are.  They  should  of  thought  of  something  different.  Good  luck  reorganizing  them!",1405987200,2,2040,4.035294117647059

CHIPS is one of those series that the whole family can enjoy and is up there with all the great series with a wonderful cast and plots this is a great addition for anyone who likes action and want to expand the views of those who are sceptical of the older shows.

3135810,4,B0014VPFKY,"I like the CHiPs series and its stars. The first season disks were fun to watch. Jon's (Larry Wilcox) arms were still a little pale but a few episodes on the bikes and the tan kicked in. Ponch's (Erik Estrada) blinding smile and swaggering walk were a glimmer. The Second Season is also good and better if all episodes played but.

Tried on different DVD players Magnavox MDR513H/F7, Sony BDP-S185, Liteon eHAU424-08 A, and Asus DVD Ram GH92N. The Liteon and ASUS players are on my desktop computer. All Dvd players are post 2009 manufactured.

Side A- Family Crisis episode has freeze and skips;  Disaster Squad episode has freeze and skips and artifacts.  Double-sided retro series DVDs I have ordered 5 out of six have at least one episode with defects unreadable parts.  Usually Warner Bros., but sometimes Universal produced disks have these defects but always double-sided. Here is a partial list of series I have had trouble with: The Waltons, Kung Fu, CHiPs, on Warner Bros. and Quantum Leap and Buck Rogers on Universal.  I am too lazy to return this series season Dvd and too impatient to wait for an exchange. The question is whether to review the series or the quality of the disks and disk creation processes. Where do you review these - at ""official"" warner bros. dvd websites?

Thing is even if you call Warner Bros. , your dvd replacements could still be defective. It is like fighting an invisible giant - if I knew where I could stab its toe it would notice me but still squash me.",1372032000,,1499,4.65530303030303

Officer Jon Baker is one of those ""knight in shining armor"" cops and Ponch is one of those cocky guys you always like to see put in his place, which is a reoccurring theme throughout the show.  I enjoy the camaraderie among the officers and good wholesome stories.  It's also interesting to see what southern california was like in the 70's.",1362355200,,452,4.421686746987952

3135823,5,B0014VPFKY,"Like I stated great show and showed a great Law Enforcement Dept. I have 2 cousins who are CHP Motor officers and myself in a motor officer in city dept is southern California. Its a show that we love so much it turned us on to motorcycles and made us decide what to do with our lives. LE and we love street motorbikes since we were of legal age. Ive owned a Ninja 600, Yamaha FZR 600 and sadly the Kawasaki was totaled my one and only serious accident and sold the Yamaha but I still own in storage a  1994 de-restricted Honda NSR 250 my pride and joy. But to rare to ride anymore. Especially with all the blind drivers out there. So now just the work BMW bike.

Sorry Im ranting just with the production company would bring out the rest of the seasons. I mean no offense to the Friends show but to me its lame and along with that so many ho hum shows in complete sets have been released. But our loved chips to this day still the same old 2 seasons and now thankfully the 1999 tv movie. So I urge everyone to write to the production and or owners of the show and tell em we want our complete set. Unlike the the rest of the shows at least this, Adam 12 or Emergency give homage to our real  LEO's, Paramedics and Firefighters.

Mine were 6 one sided discs stacked together(which is annoying but that's another issue).  So for anyone like me who hates double sided dvds and refuses to buy them, look on the back of the cover and see if it was made in 2012 and is in a double thick DVD case, not the slim cases that the double sided version has.  The same goes for Gilligan's Island.  They also have been re-released in one-sided versions.  I think it's cheap, lazy & stupid to manufacture double sided disc and I personally have had issues with playback when buying those types of dvds.

It is a shame that shows these days all look dark, gritty, and borderline evil and that's just the setting. You will notice first thing that the picture looks ""brighter"" and more ""clear"" despite being made in the 70's. Space Academy was also made then and has been copied by modern day shows as well. They clearly displayed a more ""California"" feel to this show. It was not all about violence although there was some. This was more about the lighter side of police work. Everything looks ""warmer"" and ""sunnier"", including the people, an overall attitude that just seems to be long gone. Chips is a cop show that will actually cheer you up, not make you angry or sad.

I love Season 1, but the plots and music in Season 2 are even better.  Ponch was just a novice in Season 1, but his character has matured a lot by Season 2.  The supporting characters are also stronger this season.  Finally, I really enjoy the many important messages embedded in this series, particularly those aimed at kids and youth (e.g. Family Crisis, Disaster Squad, Neighborhood Watch, High Explosive, and CHP BMX).  This makes CHiPs a great family show while also appealing to audiences who love motorcycles, California, or who simply want to re-live the late 1970s.",1217376000,2,689,4.756302521008403

3135855,5,B0014VPFKY,"I have to say that the amazon product review sums it up perfectly. This is a great retro gift to yourself or a friend. You feel good watching chips, even if you never saw it the first time. The same zanny antics from season one continue, with the blend of action and comedy going at 70 mph. Estrada's little special feature, where he interviews actual Chippies, is cute and shows how much he was influenced by the show. An odd episode, which I chalk up to being made in the 70s in a more innocent time, is where John befriends a 15 year-old girl who obviously has fallen in love with him, to the point of making him dinners, getting his slippers and hanging out at his place instead of with her mom. John never says she can't or shouldn't do any of these things, only says to tell her mom where she is at. It is very weird! What adult, much less a male cop, would hang out by himself with a 15 year-old in his apartment and tell her to stay there whenever she wanted? Weird! I may expect that sort of thing from Ponch, but John? Come on.

My only real complaint is that the sound is often terrible. At many points you have to turn it up all the way to hear the dialogue, then the music comes blaring in and you fall out of your seat.  Also, it would have been nice to have other cast members make some sort of commentary or appearance, but along with nearly all of WB's other dvd sets, they refuse to pay anyone for their time, travel or comments, so once again their cheapness only hurts the fans who supported the show in the first place. But they know we will buy it anyway.

 Still very much worth it, if for nothing else, Ponch's extended disco, freeze frame scenes at the end of one of the episodes. Man, this stuff gets funky!",1216598400,16,1733,4.195195195195195

I was so thrilled to finally see it on DVD.  I bought both seasons and am anxiously awaiting for the remaining seasons.  I started watching the dvds as soon as they arrived with my 7 year old twins.  They (and I) couldn't get enough.  What a treat to watch this show with my children and not have to worry about violence, sex or profanity.  Great clean family entertainment.  Highly recommended.

3135859,5,B0014VPFKY,"Another great season of a great series, at least so far. The stories really moved (and I mean that very literally)--that is, there were plenty of chases, and also, there was plenty of other great action from our heroes Ponch and Jon. The chases gave this second season's worth of ""CHiPs,"" like the first, sort of a ""travelogue"" feel; in essence, I got the sense that I was being led on a guided tour of L.A. and its environs, right from my own home. This second season's worth of ""CHiPs"" represents part of the time period in which the series aired on NBC Saturdays from 8 P.M. to 9 P.M. In total, I have truly enjoyed this second season's worth of ""CHiPs,"" and I heartily recommend it. Warning: this season is presented on three double-sided discs (at least for the episodes).

The extras include a documentary presented by Erik Estrada, entitled ""The Real CHiPs"", and a feature-length special called ""The Greatest Adventures of CHiPs"" that recounts (according to the package) ""the coolest cases from Seasons One and Two."" The extras are presented on a fourth disc, which is single-sided.

This season (unlike the first) also includes English, Spanish, and Portuguese audio, and English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French subtitles.

Overall, an excellent release from Warner Bros. of an excellent NBC series from MGM, and like I said, I heartily recommend it.",1215043200,12,1359,4.9

Unfortunately, they could have done a lot better of a production job on these DVDs. One episode on Disk 1 was unplayable due to freezing issues. On disk 2 another episode was also unplayable because the video simply refused to show. The audio played, the video would not.

The DVD also doesn't look as good on today's HDTV's because all of the artifacts from the original negatives. They very easily could have taken the time to re-master the video, I would have been happy to pay a little bit more for the season series if they'd done this.",1214784000,5,798,4.2781456953642385

3135863,5,B0014VPFKY,"To acknowledge the most recent reviewer. Yes, they still have the season 1 theme music in the ""choose episode"" screen. As for the episodes. Obviously the best known disco styled theme score began in earnest on the season 2 opening credits and stayed throughout until it ended in 1983 when that wannabe Bobby Nelson ""attempted"" to recreate John/Larry Wilcox's role. I remember seeing a lot of the episodes as a kid, but in the last 30 years I forgot which ones were in what seasons. I definitely agree with some of the reviewers that the episodes were better rounded than season 1. As with most tv shows, it's a crawl walk run process. Season 1 was their ""crawl"" and season two is when they really ""start to walk.""  I never realized Randi Oakes with the short hair in the ""Down Time"" episode grew her hair long after her appearance and came aboard the next season at the time 30 years ago. Atleast for youngsters like me at the time, I never noticed she played a villian in season 2 with the short hair. There were other repeat villians. The guy who was the ""Repo Man"" with the bald head and stache' also played a drunk driver who swindled his way out of tickets through a good attorney to frustrate Ponch and John in another episode. I remember the BMX craze as a kid and the episode here I remember made me want to do it myself on the same tracks sprouting up with the moguls,etc at the time. Highlights are the ""Downtime Episode"", The ""Turks"" episode with mid 30's guys like myself today still looking for thrills,etc. The Halloween episode was definitely better than anything from season 1's catalog as well. I am really looking forward to season 3 because I believe that's the one with Jim Brown as a roller skate robber and the one with the hypocritical preachers counterfitting dough. Not to generalize, but some of the preachers today are the biggest hypocrites. Handling delinguent loan issues with banks for a living, some of the most obstinate debtors are preachers and pastors who try to live tax free, yet have the audacity to take out personal and church loans and immediately default and go into hiding. I think of that season 3 episode everytime I'm on the phone calling one of them. LOL.",1212796800,4,2203,4.577215189873418
3135864,4,B0014VPFKY,"As some of the music score for season 2 is available re-mixed in stereo from the original masters it is a shame a stereo re-mix sound track was not added to make the program even more enjoyable.

Shame also the picture could not have been re-mastered and last negative is the DVD's are flippers which I really hate.

However it is still great to see Jon & Ponch in action again.

I may also be wrong on this point but the menus seem to use the season 1 theme and the episodes are in Dolby Digital 1/0",1212796800,8,500,4.134020618556701

3135866,5,B0014VPFKY,"Long ago, before the ""reality TV plague"" laid waste to most of the television landscape, there was a time when viewers could choose from a whole host of entertaining, fun, uplifting programs. If you're looking for escapist entertainment, likable characters, fun plots, and a few nifty stunts.... then you'll love Chips!

Although this series is over thirty years old, Chips has aged quite gracefully. This is due in part to great chemistry between the actors (all perfectly cast) and mostly lighthearted, fun scripts. If you're a dedicated fan seeking to feed your ""nostalgia monster"", you'll find yourself in the middle of a retro buffet! It just doesn't get any better than this!

With the recent trend being to release DVD ""half seasons"" at full season prices (Love Boat, Cannon, etc.), it's nice to see that fans of Chips have been treated fairly. An entire season of Chips is well worth the reasonable list price, and Amazon currently has a wonderful pre-order price to make this an irresistible purchase!

Let's hope that future seasons arrive in a timely manner! I just can't get enough!

Another thing was the theme song in season 1, it wasn't the theme song I remember. I remember a pulsating bassline, and only the main part of the song being played. I guess they remixed the song after the first season and really made it sound a lot better. What I wanna know is when does Ponch get his awesome car? I remember him having this gold camaro during the show, and not driving a motorhome as his main vehicle.

I am really looking forward to season 2, and I would definitely recommend season 2 to anyone who enjoyed season 1 as much as I did. It's gonna be great. Can't wait for June.",1204848000,3,882,4.157894736842105
3370195,4,B0014VPFKY,"It's about time they finally got the 1978-79 Season of this police drama on DVD along with the fact that this was the season when Ponch(Erik Estrada) & Jon(Larry Wilcox)really hit their stride & when I started watching CHiPs a lot more often, especially when this season kicked off in the Fall of 1978 which was only a year later from when this police drama made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1977.

In fact this season takes me all the way back to memory lane to my childhood days when CHiPs was on NBC every Saturday night & when this show became even more popular, especially since this season is even better, more upgraded, and quite a bit more sophisticated than the First Season was with more action, more co-stars, more accidents, and had major improvement on both the CHiPs music scoring and improvement on the CHiPs theme song from it's 1977-78 Season along with the fact that this season had even more viewers than the 1st Season did.

This 1978-1979 Season is also the season when CHiPs was moved to Saturdays & when Brianne Leary joins the cast & crew as Jon & Ponch's spunky fellow CHP Officer Sindy Cahill which was eventually replaced by Randi Oakes as Officer Bonnie Clark as the new 7-Charles in the 3rd Season since this was the only season with Sindy, plus this was the season when Lou Wagner joined the cast & crew as CHP mechanic(Harlan Arliss)making this the first year that this show had a female co-star and a special CHP technician.

Therefore; Sindy & Harlan made each episode in this season more sophisticated, especially episodes like ""Family Crisis"", ""Trick Or Trick"", ""High Flyer"", ""The Sheik"", ""Return Of The Turks"", ""Supercycle"", ""High Explosive"", ""Down Time"", ""Repo Man"", ""Pressure Point"", ""Bio-Rhythms"", ""Rally 'Round The Bank"", ""The Matchmakers"", ""Ride The Whirlwind"", ""The Greatest Adventures Of CHiPs"", etc.

The 2nd Season of this police drama is also the season when Ponch gets his first car, which was his bronze Pontiac Firebird & when Ponch gets his very first apartment at the Marina when he sells his RV trailer that Ponch was living at in the 1st Season along with the fact that this is also the season when Jon gets his brand new 4-wheel drive GMC stepside pick-up which was a major upgrade from the tiny white sports car that he had in the First Season.

Therefore, it was kind of like seeing Randi Oakes going from a bad guy to a good guy, since she was a criminal working against Ponch and Jon in the ""Down Time"" episode and then she was a cop and fellow CHP officer working with Ponch and Jon in the following season, starting with the ""Roller Disco"" episode with the exception of the ""High Octane"" episode, since Sindy was in that episode instead of Bonnie for some reason.

The Second Season of CHiPs is also the last season with California Highway Patrol Officer Gene Fritz(Lew Saunders), which got replaced by CHP Officer(Jeb Turner)as the new 7-David in the Third Season.

The truth is, I actually preferred Bonnie to her predecessor(Sindy)and thought Bonnie was better looking and more sophisticated than Sindy was, but I really missed Sindy when she left this show and got replaced by Bonnie in the 1979-80 Season of CHiPs and I wish that Bonnie and Sindy could've co-starred together on CHiPs as fellow officers of one another, kind of like Deputy Enos Strate(Sonny Shroyer)and Deputy Cletus Hogg(Rick Hurst)did temporarily in the first few episodes of THE DUKES OF HAZZARD's 5th Season and kind of like Officers Vince Romano(Adrian Zmed) and Jim Corrigan(James Darren) did at one time on TJ HOOKER before Romano departed from that show, but Sindy wasn't bad looking either and made the 2nd Season episodes more interesting with her smile, her perkiness, her sweet personality, her participation in cases with Jon and Ponch, etc., which gave me something to look back on and compare to to look back on the days when Sindy was on the show before Bonnie even came along, which helped us see how much a lot of things had changed between Jon's first 2 years on the show and Jon's last 2 years on this police drama throughout its whole 1977-83 run on NBC.

I also liked seeing guest stars like
*Randi Oakes playing a crook in the ""Down Time"" episode as a guest star before her co-starring days on CHiPs as Ponch & Jon's foxy fellow officer(Bonnie Clark)in the following season.

*Mills Watson in the ""Repo Man"" episode before his co-starring days as Deputy Perkins on SHERIFF LOBO who also previously guest starred in the ""Rustling"" episode in the 1st Season.

*Michael Conrad in the ""Biorhythms"" episode before his co-starring days as Sgt. Phil Esterhaus on the police drama HILL STREET BLUES

*Mary Crosby in the ""Pressure Point"" episode before her co-starring days on DALLAS

*Charles Brill in the ""Neighborhood Watch"" episode before his co-starring days as Capt. Lipschitz on the police drama SILK STALKINGS and before his co-starring days on the short-lived TV series SUPERTRAIN

*Markie Post in the ""Rally Round The Bank"" episode before her co-starring days on NIGHT COURT and THE FALL GUY

*Chris Knight in the ""Family Crisis"" episode after his co-starring days as Peter Brady on THE BRADY BUNCH

*Laurie Hendler in the ""Neighborhhod Watch"" episode before her co-starring days on GIMME A BREAK

*Eric Braeden in the ""Mait Team"" episode before his co-starring days as the often bitter(Victor Newman) on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Danny Bonaduce in the ""Family Crisis"" episode after his co-starring days as Danny Patridge on THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY

*Ken Kercheval in the ""High Explosive"" episode during his co-starring days on DALLAS

In addition to that, this 1978-79 Season of CHiPs DVD is quite a bit more upgraded with better subtitles than CHiPs-Season 1 DVD on top of that.

So if you liked the First Season of this police drama, you'll definetly like the Second Season, especially since the 1978-79 Season is a serious upgrade from the 1977-78 Season along with the fact that CHiPs Second Season is a lot better than CHiPs First Season hands down, which most CHiPs fans would agree with me on.

Hopefully, we won't have to wait this long for them to put the 3rd Season of CHiPs on DVD, not to mention the 1979-80 Season was even more upgraded than the first 2 Seasons of CHiPs and hopefully it won't take as long to get CHiPs Third Season released on DVD as it did to get CHiPs First and Second Seasons released on DVD, especially since CHiPs 2nd Season didn't even get put on DVD until a year after CHiPs 1st Season was.

In fact, it would be a perfect holiday or X-Mas gift if they were to release CHiPs-Season 3 on DVD by the end of November in order to be here just in time for X-Mas this year, so hopefully we'll get lucky enough to get the 1979-80 Season of CHiPs on DVD by the end of 2008, since me and most other CHiPs fans would like to see the remaining 4 seasons of CHiPs released on DVD in the near future, starting with CHiPs 3rd Season, since CHiPs 1st and 2nd Seasons are already on DVD.

Something else that baffled me about this season was, they goofed in the ""High Flyer"" episode Ponch was afraid to fly and kept trying to find ways to avoid being selected for air patrol with CHP pilot Officer Bob Patterson(John Ericson), but in the previous season, in the ""Career Day"" episode Ponch jumped right up and volunteered to go on air patrol in a CHP chopper after he got in trouble with Getraer for breaking his motorcycle at the High School where Ponch was asked to do a presentation for the students on career day, which made absolutley no sense.

Something else that I couldn't help finding odd was in the ""High Flyer"" episode when Ponch finally goes on air patrol in the CHP chopper with Patterson towards the end of the episode, Ponch spots the tan Ford van that Ponch and Jon were pursuing the first 2 times towards the beginning of that episode, but when Ponch spots that tan Ford van from the chopper, Ponch tells Jon that it was a brown Chevy van that the car stripping thieves used when they tried to kill Ponch & Jon while trying to get away from them during Jon & Ponch's 2nd hot pursuit in the ""High Flyer"" episode.

In addition to why I couldn't help being baffled about Ponch telling Jon it was the same brown Chevy van instead of the same Ford van that the car strippers used to get away from Ponch & Jon, a Ford van looks nothing at all like a Chevy van, especially since Ford & Chevy are competitors, so why would Ponch say it's a Chevy van if it was obviously a Ford van that they'd been pursuing, especially after they chased it twice in the ""High Flyer"" episode.

CHiPs 2nd Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""NBSee Us"", since that was the slogan for NBC from the Autumn of 1978 thru the Summer of 1979.

It's just too bad that this CHiPs-Season 2 DVD didn't have a bonus episode from the 3rd Season kind of like Universal does with a lot of their TV DVD box sets like Universal did with KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 3, MAGNUM, PI-SEASON 6, THE A-TEAM-SEASON 4, THE ROCKFORD FILES-SEASON 3, THE ROCKFORD FILES-SEASON 4, MAGNUM-SEASON 3; etc.

Fortunately, I can now add this Sophomore year season of CHiPs to my DVD collection of ADAM-12, DRAGNET, HUNTER, and Freshman year season of CHiPS on top of that, plus you can see all these episodes of CHiPs complete & uncut & commercial-free without all those deleted scenes you'd get when CHiPs was shown in reruns on TBS, TNT, and now MeTV.",1204502400,16,9824,4.6476355247981544

3370259,4,B0014VPFKY,"CHiPs is a dramatic, often funny, and very entertaining TV series to watch. I enjoy viewing it very much. I don't like every episode but I have many favorites here. The show basically zeroes in on 2 motorcycle police officers as they zip along the state highway, zig zagging through traffic often at very high speeds,  catching speeders, the bad guys, and helping people in need. Sometimes very very serious plots take place (The Sheik is a good example) and often many humorous situations occur. For a  70's show it is very dramatic and fast paced. The two officers are played by Larry Wilcox and Erik Estrada and they often have to report to their superior officer Sgt. Getraer who is played by Robert Pine. Other unique characters also make it to be a very interesting  and fun cast.",1412985600,,786,4.640287769784172
3370260,4,B0014VPFKY,"We just finished watching Season Two episode ""The Sheik"" on MeTV and it created quite a heated discussion in our house. At the end of the episode when the Sheik tries to give Ponch and Jon new Mercedes and they cannot accept them because they are gifts...but they ALREADY egregiously disregarded the rules about accepting gifts and gratuities when they attended the champagne and caviar yacht party the reckless driving above-the-law Sheik gave!  Several episodes earlier they wouldn't even accept invitations to a disco party given by a car dealership.

It came up because it was only last week in the nail salon almost everyone present was just sickened by these two gals that worked for the Dallas D.A.'s office bragging loudly (to impress everyone) about all the gratuities they received just by saying they were from the DA's office, like hotel discounts, bump-ups to first class on airlines, free meals; imagine how pissed off they were that the manicurist wouldn't give them a discount...but as members of the DA's office, they are  law enforcement officials.  Of course no one expects much else from our hopelessly corrupt DA's office, I guess CHP wasn't much different back then, or perhaps just no one reviewed the scripts for accuracy. I hated seeing Ponch and Jon put in such an unethical position by writers who didn't know any better.

I still highly recommend this very entertaining series.",1412899200,,1405,4.987179487179487

3370268,5,B0014VPFKY,"What's not to love?  I'm having fun introducing my 9 yr old son to CHIPS as I was 8 when it premiered back in 1978.  He loves the show, its super clean cut by today's standards and in 5 seasons, they only had to pull their gun 3 times! What's even more interesting is to see that CA traffic on the highways was always terrible...even back then.  Also, as they go by a part of the expressway, you can use Google Earth or maps in satellite view and see what they have built up around that freeway since then.  I know... a little too techie..... but my son had fun actually seeing their HQ (police station) on the show and finding it on Google Earth.  Just gives a different dimension to watching the show.  As a call goes out, my son sees how far away it is from them and sees the surrounding areas.

Ok..I've gotten a little off track...... if you want to see 4 wheeled roller skates, feathered hair, leisure suits opened with big gold chains on hairy chests, AMC Pacers, early running shorts with tube socks pulled up over the shins and of course disco music intertwined with the action...its great.",1409788800,2,1099,4.357843137254902

3370273,5,B0014VPFKY,"As  a  kid  I  never  really  watched  the  show  that  much.  Up  until  the  year  2000,  &  I  started  getting  curious  about  the  show.  Erik  Estrada  never  does  loose  his  sense  of  humor.  Knows  how  to  keep  on  smiling.  I  like  the  show.
They  do  manage  to  fix  every  accident.  Frank  &  John  are  not  only  partners  but  the  best  of  friends.  It  is  an  interesting  show.  Perfect  kind  of  show  for  some  of  the  episodes  to  use  in  defensive  driving!  Thats  the  right  way  to  point  stuff  out  to  some  people  out  there  on  the  highway!  Theirs  not  much  violence  like  some  of  todays  shows.
They  never  have  to  use  their  guns.  I've  never  really  understood  why.
But  a  lot  of  the  episodes  are  funny.  &  they  make  me  laugh. The  only  thing  that  bothers  me  a  little  bit, is  that  only  seasons  one  &  two  On  DVD seem  to  be  available.  What  about  the  rest  of  the  seasons?  In  case  anyone  asks  me,  Yes  I  think  its  worth  it!!  I'd  like  to  see  seasons  3,4,5,6!!  Please  put  them  on  display.  I'd  sure  like  to  have  them!!!!!!! I  got  a  lot  of  fond  memories.  &  episodes  I  miss.  They  kept  the  show  running  a  long  time  before  they  got  rid  of  it,  I  mean  before  it  stopped  coming  on  TV.  They're  doing  that  with  a  lot  of  shows  today,  more  &  more  of  them  keep  dissappearing.  &  I  don't  know  why!
I  thought  seasons  1 &  2  were  definitely  worth  watching.  But  no  one  wants  to  watch  them  over  &  over  again  while  we  wait  for  the  other  seasons  to  come  out.  If  I  had  all  seasons  I'd  watch  each  one,  one  at  a  time.  I  prefer  to  go  through  any  show  that  way.  I  like  the  theme  song  the  best.
My  only  complaint  about  both  seasons  one  &  two  is  the  discs  are  hard  to  get  to.  Them  being  on  top  of  each  other  like  they  are.  They  should  of  thought  of  something  different.  Good  luck  reorganizing  them!",1405987200,2,2040,4.035294117647059

CHIPS is one of those series that the whole family can enjoy and is up there with all the great series with a wonderful cast and plots this is a great addition for anyone who likes action and want to expand the views of those who are sceptical of the older shows. A perfect show for the whole family to enjoy with the high speed chases and wrecks that the chips have to take care of on a daily basis.,1376265600,,486,4.020618556701031

3370307,4,B0014VPFKY,"I like the CHiPs series and its stars. The first season disks were fun to watch. Jon's (Larry Wilcox) arms were still a little pale but a few episodes on the bikes and the tan kicked in. Ponch's (Erik Estrada) blinding smile and swaggering walk were a glimmer. The Second Season is also good and better if all episodes played but.

Tried on different DVD players Magnavox MDR513H/F7, Sony BDP-S185, Liteon eHAU424-08 A, and Asus DVD Ram GH92N. The Liteon and ASUS players are on my desktop computer. All Dvd players are post 2009 manufactured.

Side A- Family Crisis episode has freeze and skips;  Disaster Squad episode has freeze and skips and artifacts.  Double-sided retro series DVDs I have ordered 5 out of six have at least one episode with defects unreadable parts.  Usually Warner Bros., but sometimes Universal produced disks have these defects but always double-sided. Here is a partial list of series I have had trouble with: The Waltons, Kung Fu, CHiPs, on Warner Bros. and Quantum Leap and Buck Rogers on Universal.  I am too lazy to return this series season Dvd and too impatient to wait for an exchange. The question is whether to review the series or the quality of the disks and disk creation processes. Where do you review these - at ""official"" warner bros. dvd websites?

Thing is even if you call Warner Bros. , your dvd replacements could still be defective. It is like fighting an invisible giant - if I knew where I could stab its toe it would notice me but still squash me.",1372032000,,1499,4.65530303030303

3370316,5,B0014VPFKY,"I can't tell you exactly why I like this show so much, perhaps it's because it takes me back to my childhood.  Officer Jon Baker is one of those ""knight in shining armor"" cops and Ponch is one of those cocky guys you always like to see put in his place, which is a reoccurring theme throughout the show.  I enjoy the camaraderie among the officers and good wholesome stories.  It's also interesting to see what southern california was like in the 70's.",1362355200,,452,4.421686746987952

3370320,5,B0014VPFKY,"Like I stated great show and showed a great Law Enforcement Dept. I have 2 cousins who are CHP Motor officers and myself in a motor officer in city dept is southern California. Its a show that we love so much it turned us on to motorcycles and made us decide what to do with our lives. LE and we love street motorbikes since we were of legal age. Ive owned a Ninja 600, Yamaha FZR 600 and sadly the Kawasaki was totaled my one and only serious accident and sold the Yamaha but I still own in storage a  1994 de-restricted Honda NSR 250 my pride and joy. But to rare to ride anymore. Especially with all the blind drivers out there. So now just the work BMW bike.

Sorry Im ranting just with the production company would bring out the rest of the seasons. I mean no offense to the Friends show but to me its lame and along with that so many ho hum shows in complete sets have been released. But our loved chips to this day still the same old 2 seasons and now thankfully the 1999 tv movie. So I urge everyone to write to the production and or owners of the show and tell em we want our complete set. Unlike the the rest of the shows at least this, Adam 12 or Emergency give homage to our real  LEO's, Paramedics and Firefighters.

Lets hope they hear our plea folks.",1361059200,4,1265,4.109311740890688

Mine were 6 one sided discs stacked together(which is annoying but that's another issue).  So for anyone like me who hates double sided dvds and refuses to buy them, look on the back of the cover and see if it was made in 2012 and is in a double thick DVD case, not the slim cases that the double sided version has.  The same goes for Gilligan's Island.  They also have been re-released in one-sided versions.  I think it's cheap, lazy & stupid to manufacture double sided disc and I personally have had issues with playback when buying those types of dvds.

My favorite episode is in this season:  Mait Team.  This is an absolutely excellent episode.  These two sexy men help everyone from infants to the oldest of citizens!  Each episode is action packed and holds just the right amount of comedy.  I love these guys!!!",1350691200,,482,4.588235294117647

It is a shame that shows these days all look dark, gritty, and borderline evil and that's just the setting. You will notice first thing that the picture looks ""brighter"" and more ""clear"" despite being made in the 70's. Space Academy was also made then and has been copied by modern day shows as well. They clearly displayed a more ""California"" feel to this show. It was not all about violence although there was some. This was more about the lighter side of police work. Everything looks ""warmer"" and ""sunnier"", including the people, an overall attitude that just seems to be long gone. Chips is a cop show that will actually cheer you up, not make you angry or sad.

3370348,5,B0014VPFKY,"Watching the old TV shows that I grew up with brings back alot of memories of growing up.  That is why watching them is so much fun.  Not only are they clean, wholesome shows, but it takes you back to those days growing up, laying on the floor in front of the TV watching the shows as a kid.  Shows like this influence our lives more than we know too.  Watching Adam 12 and CHiPs influenced me to get into law enforcement, and I am now a motor officer with our department, and it goes back to these shows and how they hit me growing up.  Thanks for the great shows and thanks for the memories.",1218585600,4,593,4.077586206896552

3370350,5,B0014VPFKY,"Now that I have both Season 1 and 2 of CHiPs on DVD, I find myself re-watching the second season more frequently.  I love Season 1, but the plots and music in Season 2 are even better.  Ponch was just a novice in Season 1, but his character has matured a lot by Season 2.  The supporting characters are also stronger this season.  Finally, I really enjoy the many important messages embedded in this series, particularly those aimed at kids and youth (e.g. Family Crisis, Disaster Squad, Neighborhood Watch, High Explosive, and CHP BMX).  This makes CHiPs a great family show while also appealing to audiences who love motorcycles, California, or who simply want to re-live the late 1970s.",1217376000,2,689,4.756302521008403

Watching these old episodes of Chips takes us back to our childhood when we watched all of these for the first time. Good buy for any Chips fan.",1217203200,3,315,4.064516129032258
3370352,5,B0014VPFKY,"I have to say that the amazon product review sums it up perfectly. This is a great retro gift to yourself or a friend. You feel good watching chips, even if you never saw it the first time. The same zanny antics from season one continue, with the blend of action and comedy going at 70 mph. Estrada's little special feature, where he interviews actual Chippies, is cute and shows how much he was influenced by the show. An odd episode, which I chalk up to being made in the 70s in a more innocent time, is where John befriends a 15 year-old girl who obviously has fallen in love with him, to the point of making him dinners, getting his slippers and hanging out at his place instead of with her mom. John never says she can't or shouldn't do any of these things, only says to tell her mom where she is at. It is very weird! What adult, much less a male cop, would hang out by himself with a 15 year-old in his apartment and tell her to stay there whenever she wanted? Weird! I may expect that sort of thing from Ponch, but John? Come on.

My only real complaint is that the sound is often terrible. At many points you have to turn it up all the way to hear the dialogue, then the music comes blaring in and you fall out of your seat.  Also, it would have been nice to have other cast members make some sort of commentary or appearance, but along with nearly all of WB's other dvd sets, they refuse to pay anyone for their time, travel or comments, so once again their cheapness only hurts the fans who supported the show in the first place. But they know we will buy it anyway.

 Still very much worth it, if for nothing else, Ponch's extended disco, freeze frame scenes at the end of one of the episodes. Man, this stuff gets funky!",1216598400,16,1733,4.195195195195195

3370355,5,B0014VPFKY,"CHiPs was my favorite show when I was a kid (loved Jon and Ponch!!!).  My siblings and I would be mesmerized for an hour.  I continued to watch it on cable when it was on.  I was so thrilled to finally see it on DVD.  I bought both seasons and am anxiously awaiting for the remaining seasons.  I started watching the dvds as soon as they arrived with my 7 year old twins.  They (and I) couldn't get enough.  What a treat to watch this show with my children and not have to worry about violence, sex or profanity.  Great clean family entertainment.  Highly recommended.  I am addicted all over again.  They don't make shows like they used to.",1215388800,2,641,4.302521008403361
3370356,5,B0014VPFKY,"Another great season of a great series, at least so far. The stories really moved (and I mean that very literally)--that is, there were plenty of chases, and also, there was plenty of other great action from our heroes Ponch and Jon. The chases gave this second season's worth of ""CHiPs,"" like the first, sort of a ""travelogue"" feel; in essence, I got the sense that I was being led on a guided tour of L.A. and its environs, right from my own home. This second season's worth of ""CHiPs"" represents part of the time period in which the series aired on NBC Saturdays from 8 P.M. to 9 P.M. In total, I have truly enjoyed this second season's worth of ""CHiPs,"" and I heartily recommend it. Warning: this season is presented on three double-sided discs (at least for the episodes).

The extras include a documentary presented by Erik Estrada, entitled ""The Real CHiPs"", and a feature-length special called ""The Greatest Adventures of CHiPs"" that recounts (according to the package) ""the coolest cases from Seasons One and Two."" The extras are presented on a fourth disc, which is single-sided.

This season (unlike the first) also includes English, Spanish, and Portuguese audio, and English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French subtitles.

Overall, an excellent release from Warner Bros. of an excellent NBC series from MGM, and like I said, I heartily recommend it.",1215043200,12,1359,4.9
3370357,3,B0014VPFKY,"It's great to see Ponch and Jon make a return to DVD with Season 2. This is one of my favorite programs from when I was a child and it's really fun to watch not just the action but the background in the chase scenes and see how much the world has changed.

Unfortunately, they could have done a lot better of a production job on these DVDs. One episode on Disk 1 was unplayable due to freezing issues. On disk 2 another episode was also unplayable because the video simply refused to show. The audio played, the video would not.

The DVD also doesn't look as good on today's HDTV's because all of the artifacts from the original negatives. They very easily could have taken the time to re-master the video, I would have been happy to pay a little bit more for the season series if they'd done this.",1214784000,5,798,4.2781456953642385

3370360,5,B0014VPFKY,"To acknowledge the most recent reviewer. Yes, they still have the season 1 theme music in the ""choose episode"" screen. As for the episodes. Obviously the best known disco styled theme score began in earnest on the season 2 opening credits and stayed throughout until it ended in 1983 when that wannabe Bobby Nelson ""attempted"" to recreate John/Larry Wilcox's role. I remember seeing a lot of the episodes as a kid, but in the last 30 years I forgot which ones were in what seasons. I definitely agree with some of the reviewers that the episodes were better rounded than season 1. As with most tv shows, it's a crawl walk run process. Season 1 was their ""crawl"" and season two is when they really ""start to walk.""  I never realized Randi Oakes with the short hair in the ""Down Time"" episode grew her hair long after her appearance and came aboard the next season at the time 30 years ago. Atleast for youngsters like me at the time, I never noticed she played a villian in season 2 with the short hair. There were other repeat villians. The guy who was the ""Repo Man"" with the bald head and stache' also played a drunk driver who swindled his way out of tickets through a good attorney to frustrate Ponch and John in another episode. I remember the BMX craze as a kid and the episode here I remember made me want to do it myself on the same tracks sprouting up with the moguls,etc at the time. Highlights are the ""Downtime Episode"", The ""Turks"" episode with mid 30's guys like myself today still looking for thrills,etc. The Halloween episode was definitely better than anything from season 1's catalog as well. I am really looking forward to season 3 because I believe that's the one with Jim Brown as a roller skate robber and the one with the hypocritical preachers counterfitting dough. Not to generalize, but some of the preachers today are the biggest hypocrites. Handling delinguent loan issues with banks for a living, some of the most obstinate debtors are preachers and pastors who try to live tax free, yet have the audacity to take out personal and church loans and immediately default and go into hiding. I think of that season 3 episode everytime I'm on the phone calling one of them. LOL.",1212796800,4,2203,4.577215189873418
3370361,4,B0014VPFKY,"As some of the music score for season 2 is available re-mixed in stereo from the original masters it is a shame a stereo re-mix sound track was not added to make the program even more enjoyable.

Shame also the picture could not have been re-mastered and last negative is the DVD's are flippers which I really hate.

However it is still great to see Jon & Ponch in action again.

I may also be wrong on this point but the menus seem to use the season 1 theme and the episodes are in Dolby Digital 1/0",1212796800,8,500,4.134020618556701

3370363,5,B0014VPFKY,"Long ago, before the ""reality TV plague"" laid waste to most of the television landscape, there was a time when viewers could choose from a whole host of entertaining, fun, uplifting programs. If you're looking for escapist entertainment, likable characters, fun plots, and a few nifty stunts.... then you'll love Chips!

Although this series is over thirty years old, Chips has aged quite gracefully. This is due in part to great chemistry between the actors (all perfectly cast) and mostly lighthearted, fun scripts. If you're a dedicated fan seeking to feed your ""nostalgia monster"", you'll find yourself in the middle of a retro buffet! It just doesn't get any better than this!

With the recent trend being to release DVD ""half seasons"" at full season prices (Love Boat, Cannon, etc.), it's nice to see that fans of Chips have been treated fairly. An entire season of Chips is well worth the reasonable list price, and Amazon currently has a wonderful pre-order price to make this an irresistible purchase!

Let's hope that future seasons arrive in a timely manner! I just can't get enough!

Season one was released on SINGLE SIDED discs. This set is DOUBLE SIDED.

The Freeze Frame laughing  at the end of every episode, the season Of ""Sindy"" (before Bonnie"") and of course, the over exaggerated multi car collisions on the (not yet opened) I-210 fwy in LA scenes. And let us not forget about Harlen and his dog who growls at Getrear (did I spell that right?) or when Ponch drinks out of his cup. Yet this will defintly reminds of  those childhood days when my buddies and I would ride our bicycles and fight over who was going to be Ponch or Jon (Whoever wrecked their Motorcycle on the episode that night).

Great music with Alan Silvestri to thank (who does most of the music in the episodes,I noticed) No surprise...he did the awesome theme song to the movie ""Shattered"". Our two heroes are back in action for more wonderful episodes.

Lots of laugh out loud bloopers and stunts (especially the Sgt's son on a bike,LOL!) but hey, that's part of the fun of the show. It's all about the chemistry though between Wilcox and Estrada. Perhaps they weren't ""buddies"" in real life but none of that shows through here. I can't think of anyone else who could portray Jon and Ponch better than these two.
