7831893,5,6302799074,"This TV movie is the best look at how easy it is for pedophiles to get to our children. I just watched this flick for the first time in over 20 years. Still has great impact on the subject matter. Richard Mauser portrays the pedophile perfectly where you just feel creepy. Dana Hill (RIP) pulls off one of the best child performances. This movie has been out of print for far too long. If you EVER get the chance to see this movie, do it.",1362873600,3,438,4.1647058823529415
7831894,5,6302799074,"I first caught this movie when it was rerun back in 94...though I missed the first half (and it took me another 6 mos or so before I got to see the movie in its entirety, LOL), what I saw had a powerful impact, to say nothing of the fine acting jobs by Dana Hill as Jennifer, the confused pre-teen looking for an adult she can trust during the difficult times she's going through, and Richard Masur as Howard, the softball coach/pedophile who slowly lures Jennifer into his child pornography ring with the kindness and understanding she needs (he dubs her ""Angel"", the same pet name he gave his last victim, hence the film's title), then gradually turning to manipulation and further alienation of Jennifer from her mother (Melinda Dillon) and soon-to-be stepfather (Ronny Cox).

Why hasn't this film been rerun on cable (to the best of my knowledge) during the past 10 years? Although somewhat dated by today's standards, time has not silenced its powerful message, and it does a fine job of showing how the Jennifers of the world are most vulnerable to this kind of sick exploitation and abuse...indeed, VHS copies are equally hard to come by, but worth the often high prices they command just to see a TV movie that doesn't fall into the usual ""cookie-cutter"" subject formula and addresses such a controversial topic in a manner that really gets its point across. Def worth viewing, if you can find it!",1137283200,11,1405,4.711382113821138
7831895,5,6302799074,"I first saw this movie when it first came out in the early 80's at age 11 or 12 years old.  I am now 29 years old and had began a internet search for this movie. I collect movies and am now focusing on some of the more  favorable movies of my childhood to add to my collection.  Without a doubt  Fallin Angel was at the very top of the list. The movie was absolutely  wonderful! Obviously to rank among my favorite movies a good 19 years  later! This movie is one that many can relate to their own childhoods as  far as problems and unhappiness goes. THis is the incredible story of one  girl...and her life within a messed up home and childhood who got the  attention she needed and desperately wanted at home from a softball coach.  A coach that fed her need for attention and self confidence and led her  directly into child pornography! ANY adult,mother,father, or child this age  should definitely see this movie! As old as it is....it is still a very  good story of the dangers that young girls face in the real world. Please  get this movie! You will enjoy it and please let your young daughters see  it to let her be aware of the dangers out there! Through this search I  found that the star of this movie is now dead. Dana Hill...how sad. She had  such a great future ahead of her and was so wonderful! Dana Hill will be  greatly missed!",954028800,27,1346,4.273809523809524
