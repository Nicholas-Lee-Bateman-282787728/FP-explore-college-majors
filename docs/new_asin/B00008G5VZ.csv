7982684,3,B00008G5VZ,"There are several Roy Rogers movies that are listed as color when they are not.  This is one of those.  They are made by Alpha Omega Publications and dated Oct. 19th, 2004.  This movie is in B&W and not in color.  The film quality of this movie in general is not very good regardless of who makes it.  The orginal film must not be in very good condition.",1105747200,,354,4.147058823529412
