Is this supposed to be part of the joke? It's not funny, just stupid. Also, the worst thing is they make really gross problematic jokes such as ripping off a girl's hijab. This is meant to be a laugh line in the show. How disgusting. I regret giving my money",1517961600,,420,4.072289156626506
8611232,3,B00F0WVHMI,"Bad Education is watchable but as the other reviewer stated, it's not up there with the best British comedies, the cover markets this show to fans of The Inbetweeners but other than being set in a school, it's got nothing really in common with that.  All up Series 1 only goes for a couple of hours so compared to other complete season one TV shows on DVD, its not very good value.  A lot of British shows don't have many episodes each season, which is fine when they are using the theory or quality over quantity, but since this one isn't that great, it doesn't have enough episodes for any of the characters to grow on you or anything.

Bad Education's storylines revolve around one teacher who is a real slacker.  The show would maybe have worked better if his character (Alfie) somehow had to come up with ways to survive a more real world education system as a slacker, sort of like the 80's movie Summer School.  But instead in Bad Education that other faculty aren't realistic either.  The headmaster is even more a slacker than Alfie is, I think they've based the principal on Dean Pelton from the US show Community but he's even more unrealistic than that guy. The vice principal starts of realistic but quickly turns into a joke.  The only other teacher other than an old lady you see from time to time is the hot teacher of the school who both Alfie and the principal want to get into the pants of.  She takes her job and the welfare of the children seriously. It's also a bit odd that this is a high school based show yet the one teacher has the same students all day, every day.

The students are your typical TV school show characters, the smart Asian girl who doesn't like the slackness of her teacher, the overweight kid who is the brunt of jokes and bullying, the smart mouthed slackers, the gay kid who Alfie doesn't think could play soccer, the girl who has a crush on her teacher and so on.  They don't have their own story lines and are just really props for Alfie's storylines.

Bad Education is watchable, it has a few funny moments but those are few and far between and don't even occur every episode.  Overall Bad Education is disappointing for a comedy.  If you've somehow come across a copy and have nothing else to watch but it's not good enough that you'd bother with the second season.  If you're after a good school set comedy there's a lot better options out there, likewise British TV shows.",1453939200,,2424,4.45475113122172
8611233,3,B00F0WVHMI,"I am a big fan of British comedy; i..e, little Britain, the IT crown, the Inbetweeners, Come fly with me, etcunfortunately this did not measure up. I never finished the series, watched a few episodes and thought that it isn't going to get any better. It doesn not measure up to some of the other excellent comedy series that are available",1435190400,,338,4.557377049180328
