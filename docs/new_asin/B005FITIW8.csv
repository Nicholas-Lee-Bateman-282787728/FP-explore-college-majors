4674823,5,B005FITIW8,"I absolutely love classical music and Mozart ranks among the top on my favorite list. To have a movie made in regards to the story people do not generally know or care about, that of Mozart's sister, is such a thrill. I was enthralled by the beauty of this movie and I hope that subtitles do not throw anyone off the fact that this movie, in regards to the screenwriting and filming, is very beautiful. As a disclaimer, I do speak French marginally well and thus the subtitles did not bother me. Give this movie a chance and see for yourself whether I speak truthfully or not. :)",1337385600,14,579,4.37037037037037
4674824,3,B005FITIW8,"I wanted to like this movie.  I really did.  I found the trailer worrisome but hoped the tim would be better.  Alas, I stopped watching about 30 minutes.  Why?  I'll limit myself to three reasons.  First, the plot consists of randomly related episodes about poor Mozart's sister sad fate as.  Poor little royal rich girls fare just as badly.  I could see the director was perhaps trying to construct a biography of WAM's sister by adapt one of Mozart's own operas.  But it doesn't work.  The pacing is incredibly slow.  Second, the cinematography is poor.  Most shots are hand held, a cheap way of providing a kind of cinema verite reality effect, I suppose. But is both needless and artlessly done. Third, the dialogue is insipid.  The acting is fine, the roles are well cast, and I enjoyed seeing the children play the violin and the harpsichord.  I also like French.  But the film's pluses were not enough to fold me.  Amadeus this film is not.  I was very happy I did not buy the film and waited instead to see in HD on netflix.",1334880000,4,1032,4.491891891891892

4674826,3,B005FITIW8,"Beautifuly filmed but slow and a bit boreing, Mozart's Sister is a low key drama about a girls talent being the wall that isolates her from a meaningful life.

4674827,5,B005FITIW8,"This is a quote from the film in which Maria Anna Mozart - the sister of the child prodigy Wolfgang - laments that her father has opened her personal diaries and scribbled comments about the genius of his young son but her own achievements, hard work, and devotion to music are ignored.

The movie transported me...to the eighteenth century in a way that ""Amadeus"" did not. Whereas ""Amadeus"" is spectacle, this gentle film takes place in the drawing rooms or homes of the nobility. It is the time when Mozart's father, Leopold, is dragging his two amazing children throughout Europe to show them off, to improve his son's musical education, and to advance his own thwarted ambitions. Needless to say, the photography, the costumes, and the music are a delight. I adored the film, yet was saddened by its theme. Bottom line, this is the most underrated film of 2011.

Marie Feret - who plays the 16 year old sister of Wolfgang - is a wonder. How does she do it? Understatement. She conveys emotions all through her eyes - shyness, laughter, intelligence, joy, anxiety, and alas...disappointment. [The director actually used both of his young daughters as actresses in ""his film"" - and gets terrific performances from them]

As for the principal character in the movie, the truth is that Mozart's sister was brilliant and talented but, as a woman, she was forced to take second place to her brother. This is not to say she was the better genius. That is impossible. But her opportunities - as a violinist or as a composer - were walled in by her domineering father. That she might have been an extraordinary genius - at least as a musician - is a serious possibility.  Let anyone listen to Ginette Neveu's artistry as a violinist on a CD recording and compare her mastery of the instrument to any living violinist...and you will see what I mean.

Important scenes are the interaction of Mozart's sister with one of the princesses of France. The princess is locked away in a convent and befriends the talented young girl. The princess learns to accept her role as a bride of Christ and to find joy and contentment as an obedient nun. But Nannerl, the sister of Mozart, is different from other girls. Her heart and mind beg her to create; her society and father simply won't allow it.

When I saw this wonderful film in the movie theater, I noted that two older women in the audience were crying.  I asked them how they felt about the experience of seeing ""Mozart's Sister."" One of the ladies said ""I weep for all the women throughout the centuries whose imaginations were suffocated unfairly."" A tender person would feel the same way.

There is a moment, just about the end of the film, that summarized everything the filmmaker wanted to convey. Unforgettable.",1326499200,68,2757,4.717255717255718

4674829,4,B005FITIW8,"If it's the magic name Mozart that attracts you to this film, you will be mildly disappointed. The 11-year-old poppet who plays Wolfi is hardly more than a well-costumed prop, and there are scant snatches of any music in the film. [I suppose one should be thankful that there isn't a pseudo-classical soundtrack slurping sweetly in the background.] Yes, it's really about Nannerl, Mozart's older sister, and it has a 'message' to expound, about the frustration of a young woman's genius in a paternalistic society.

With Nannerl as protagonist, Leopold Mozart, the composer's notoriously domineering and ambitious father, is the chief antagonist in the script of this film; essentially, Father Leopold precludes his daughter's aspirations to compose for two reasons, first that it's not imaginable to him that a Woman could indeed compose worthily, and second that he aspires to see his daughter married well, above his own rank in society. That's historically accurate; Leopold Mozart did prohibit his daughter even from performing publicly at age 18, and refused to let her accompany him and Wolfgang to Italy. Nannerl (Maria Anna Mozart (1761-1829) stayed with her parents in Salzburg until her arranged marriage in 1783 to a wealthy widower with five children already. Nannerl returned to Salzburg, with four of her step-children and two of her own children, after her husband's death in 1801. Her parents and her famous brother were already dead by then, and Nannerl lived quietly. Wolfgang's widow Constanze and her nephew Franz Xavier had no contact with her until the 1820s, when she had become feeble and blind. There's lingering myth that she died in poverty, but in fact she left quite a substantial estate of money. The only solid indication ""we"" have that Nannerl ever attempted to compose comes from encouragements in letters from her brother; not a single bar of any such composition is known to exist.

There's a second parallel script, however, in the film, a 'libretto' complete with the cross-dressing so popular in 18th C opera. While traveling by coach toward Paris, the Mozarts -- father, mother, Nannerl, and little Wolfi -- are forced to spend several nights at an abbey of nuns. There Nannerl meets the three daughters of King Louis XV, who have been committed to the care of the Abbess; Nannerl 'bonds' in friendship with the youngest daughter, who will eventually find a 'spiritual vocation' as a nun herself. In the short term, however, the little Princess commissions Nannerl to deliver a secret letter to a young man, a commoner, in the entourage of Louis le Dauphin (1729-1765; son of Louis XV, father of Louis XVI). In order to approach the Dauphin, who is in mourning for his wife who died in childbirth, Nannerl is disguised as a young man. The Dauphin, a tormented introvert, is charmed by the ""male"" Nannerl and demands ""his"" friendship, challenging ""him"" to compose a concerto for violin for the Court. Nannerl indeed composes such a work, concealing her efforts from her father, but eventually she is compelled to reveal her true gender, whereupon the Dauphin transforms his imperious friendship into even more imperious, and impossible, love. This is obviously a libretto for an 'opera seria', a tragedy, as the Dauphin is forced to renounce Nannerl for a royal alliance with a Saxon princess.

Before you ask, let me say that none of this plot is historically accurate or plausible in the least. The dates don't align, the ages of the historical figures don't match those of the characters in the film, etc. The behavior of the two operatic lovers, Nannerl and Louis, is extremely improbable. In short, it has all the elements of an 18th C opera! All it needs is music, preferably by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart though Salieri would do. One would need to scrap the historical script of conflict between father and daughter, to keep the opera focused on the love affair. But think of the impassioned arias such an opera would feature!

The French do atmospheric costume period films well. It's the atmosphere that makes this film successful -- the visual splendor of dress and decor in the 'ancien regime' of pre-Revolutionary France. ""Mozart's Sister"" isn't as poignantly moody as ""Tous les Matins du Monde"" or as colorfully lusty as ""The Return of Martin Guerre"", but it's in that grand tradition. The acting is convincing enough, with Louis le Dauphin 'stealing' every scene in which he appears. Little Wolfi, the boy actor that is, seems stiffly constrained in his gorgeous braided jacket and tricorne, but that could well be a touch of historical verisimilitude.",1317772800,21,4602,5.019633507853404

4674865,3,B005FITIW8,"This review contains Spoilers. I recently wrote a review of Queen Margot in which I noted that changes made that were not true to the actual history helped the film greatly. One should allow films to change things a bit. If you want history, by all means read history and don't look for it in films. I'm saying this lest I seem like one of these pedantic characters who want to tear a film apart over every historical detail. However in this case the divergence from actuality is so gigantic and overwhelming that it makes the film a total fantasy. I wish to note some of these differences simply to set the record straight for those who are curious.

But first, the film itself. It's nicely staged in beautiful locations with great costumes and looks very handsome. The budget does not allow for huge scenes of the Court of Louis XV, but is satisfactory without them. Overall the acting is good, particularly Marc Barbe as the stern but loving Leopold Mozart and David Moreau, a lively fourteen year old Wolfgang Amadeus. However, the director, Rene Feret, chose to use his three daughters in important female roles including that of Mozart's Sister, Nannerl, and this does not work so well as she is not very expressive. The film moves along slowly and though it seems endless at times, it is still somewhat satisfactory, thus my ""It's OK"" Three Stars.

It would seem that the director wanted to make a film about how historically the talents of women were often shunted aside simply because they were women, a worthy topic. In that case,however, he should have made a film about Clara Schumann, a notable and worthy historical example and not the negligible Anna-Marie (Nannerl) Mozart. But few know or care about Robert Schumann anymore whereas Wolfgang Amadeus is a superstar, so I think the director chose to concoct this Mozart fantasy to ride on Wolfgang's coattails.

THE HISTORY. The movie turns on a broken carriage wheel leading the Mozart family to stay at the Abbey of Fontevraud where the three youngest daughters of Louis XV are living because he had ten children by the Queen, too many to keep at Versailles. Nannerl befriends them, especially Princess Louise, who eventually became famous as a princess who gave up Versailles to become a Carmelite nun. The basics are all true, but the Mozart's could not have met them as the Princesses left the Abbey and returned to Versailles six years before Wolfgang was born, and when Nannerl was one year old. When she joined the Carmelites she was 33, not a child as shown in the film.

Later on the director, who also wrote the script, has Nannerl have a romantic flirtation that starts to become rather serious. This would have been acceptable if he had her fall for an army captain (as she actually did in Salzburg, though Leopold would not let them marry), or even a count or marquis. But no, he has to have her become involved with the Dauphin Louis of France no less (the Crown Prince who died before his father, Louis XV and whose son became Louis XVI). This is really too much, and sends the film into Romance Novel territory rather than any possible reality.

The relationship between Wolfgang and Nannerl was warm and they even made up their own language in which to converse. They corresponded for many years and Wolfgang sent her copies of his Piano Concertos as he wrote them, all the way through number 21 in C (K.467). There was never any evidence of jealousy on Nannerl's part and, dutiful daughter that she was, she stopped playing publicly at age 17, because it would have been scandalous to continue in those days. She was highly praised for her keyboard technique as long as she did play in public.

There is not much evidence that she ever wrote any music. The only reference is in a letter from Wolfgang where he says he liked the pieces she sent him. These may have been short keyboard pieces but Wolfgang would have said more had they been the fully orchestrated works she composed in the film. There is no other evidence at all, and no way to judge what they might have been. But the film goes so far as not only to suggest that she was writing keyboard concertos, but that some of Wolfgang's early works were actually composed by her. This is way out of line and uncalled for. Perhaps if she was Wagenseil's sister, but Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart didn't need to steal music from anyone.

There are other things, but this is enough. The film is a total fantasy, so enjoy it or not according to your taste but do not confuse it with actual events.",1437696000,3,4527,4.63013698630137

4674886,4,B005FITIW8,"This movie has inspired me to do some serious research about Anna Maria Mozart since I adore Wolfgang, the French 18th century and the French language - but the *movie* (described here as a re-imagining of her life) has the general stilted remoteness of some period movies that keeps us (intentionally or not) at arms' length; we want to relate but the script is often so passionless it functions as a distancing echo rather than an invitation to fully enter the era; appropriate costumes and lavish real interiors notwithstanding. It also has production flaws (my main beef!). Music was central to the Mozarts' life and wanderings through European capitals yet the sound quality of the children's performances at their respective instruments and Anna Maria's singing - was poor. Child Mozart plays on his violin, in one scene, but I could hardly hear it, while the footsteps of others moving about the room were loud and clear. Did others have this problem? More attention should have been paid to this technical detail. Or I got a faulty DVD.

Nevertheless, Maria F&eacute;ret's portrayal of Anna Maria as a very talented young musician who ultimately sacrifices everything to filial duty is good. Her beauty is androgynous enough for her disguise as a young man to be plausible in the re-imagined parts of the movie linking her with the Dauphin. Her sadness at being gradually pushed aside, well reflected in her face. Child Wolfgang comes across as a normal and playful boy, the well-known effortless quality of his musical genius quietly present but never center stage. This is, after all, about his sister and I rejoice at the fact that, along with this effort, there have been several attempts to bring her back to life and give her the recognition she deserves.

A touching note in the film, perhaps the saddest, has her reading from the Nannerl Notenbuch (Nannerl's Music Book). It reminds us that Leopold initially thought of HER  as worthy of all his attention. The *actual* book is full of his compositions and harpsichord exercises for her instruction. That he eventually decided to exploit the more lucrative phenomenon of a boy child musician by eliminating the competitive presence of his sister and insisting she step aside, is the underlying tragic theme of this movie.",1407628800,,2287,4.981675392670157

There is a rich depth of subtlety that can easily go unnoticed; possibly due to the strength of focus for each scene or perhaps from the casual yet sensual undulations that connect each person.  Although the more famous sibling, Amadeus Mozart features prominently (and that genius is well-framed throughout) there is no doubt that, in the end, this is the story of a woman, perhaps of equal or superior ability, that must eventually sacrifice and transform her passion in order to survive within the context of the times in which she lives.

If you are moved by music, if you are sensitive to the dichotomies imposed by society upon man and woman alike or if you simply desire to better understand a small portion of the life and family of Mozart then do not hesitate to set aside an evening to view this film.  Alone if necessary, with like-minded friends or (mature) family if possible.  Expect little... receive much.

The music in the movie was delightful and the young lady who portrayed Nannerl was so perfect for the part.  I recommend this film for anyone who enjoys classical music and is interested in Mozart's music.",1390953600,,645,4.68141592920354

I also liked how this contained moments that were fat from dull. The film flowed nicely and the storyline engaging. I loves the characters; namely the young princess  turned nun that befriends nannerl. I also loved how the Mozart became a family name, like Jones or Smith, not just the title of one of the greatest geniuses of all time. All in all, riveting.",1388880000,,474,4.710843373493976

The movie takes a more balanced approach to the father - no snarling abuser, he is neither any kind of supportive father. Mozart's sister, named Nannerl, lives a gypsy life with her Mother and father carting her and her brother all over Europe scraping together a living. But the father puts all of his affection, belief, and energy into his son - perhaps because he knows his son is the only one who can gain acceptance in the field of music because of the conventions against women being able to have skills beyond the domestic for that time and many hundreds of years forward. There's an interesting romance thrown in - and don't worry about the odd scenes in the first 15 minutes. Stick with it, the story is good, interesting, if depressing .",1378252800,,936,4.544378698224852

4675045,3,B005FITIW8,I don't like subtitles.  The portrail of the father was rather soft.  He was a very stern man.  The facts at the end of the movie was factual but rather surprised it didn't continue to include the mother's death while on tour with Wolfgang.,1376870400,,240,4.409090909090909
4675046,2,B005FITIW8,"Oh my... the role of Mozart's sister is played by the directors daughter. The movie starts out well, with emotion-- laughter and tears.  But after @15 minutes the lead actress turns to stone. She has an almost blank expression for the rest of the movie. The only actress with less emotion was the lead princess--I had to laugh when she said (in a drab monotone) something about how everyone thought she was reckless and spirited. Although I understand that one's expression during that time needed to be guarded, this is taking it too far!  The girls weren't even whining. They just drifted limply through the movie, held up by their dresses and the music. My daughter's hermit crabs show more emotion.

The other actors, the costumers, etc all try valiantly to carry the movie, but the two emotionless teenagers drag the movie down. It is a shame, because the movie takes an intriguing view of a talented girl.

And please, people, don't believe that this is necessarily a completely accurate portrayal or the girl or her life.  Just like in Amadeus, dramatic liberties were taken.",1376438400,2,1082,4.827027027027027

4675059,5,B005FITIW8,"This foreign film (French) was a wonderful surprise I stumbled onto last week.  It is beautifully shot, magnificently acted, and the sound track (at least for any fan of classical music) is exquisite.  The subtitles are always easy to read.  As with many historically-based films, no doubt this is not a completely factual tale, but many of the essential elements are.  It's also very interesting to get the story from the perspective of a female sibling of Mozart in a time when women were greatly restricted artistically.

4675066,4,B005FITIW8,"Visually striking and beautiful, the movie faithfully creates an intense, highly plausible, conception of a successful, but physically demanding, touring musician's lot in life.  The theme of insuperable limitation because of her gender generates a sense of profound loss of the musical potential a sibling of Wolfgang Mozart's might have expected.  Her [relatively] long life makes one yearn for the music she might have composed.  Her treatment as a young woman limited and penalized because of her being a woman generates the profoundest sympathy - the actress who plays Nannerl makes her a most attractive and vulnerable victim of the social rigidity of her time.  I'd rate the movie five stars except that would indicate perfection.  A ten star system would have generated 9.5 stars.",1374105600,,788,5.272
4675067,4,B005FITIW8,"I enjoyed it enough to do more reading about Anna Maria Mozart - and was disappointed to discover that much of the movie story could not have occurred as portrayed (discrepancies in characters' ages, etc.) - especially interactions with specific members of Bourbon royal family.  I think fiction has more power when it tries to portray history as accurately as the evidence allows.  (Since there is much that is unknown, there is still a great deal of room for imagination.

4675094,5,B005FITIW8,"It's a rare person who hasn't heard of the Child prodigy Wolfgang Mozart. An even smaller number of people have not heard at least one piece of Mozart's music. His fine musical compositions are considered to be timeless treasures of the world. Yet, it's even  harder to find anyone who knew about Anna (Nannai) Mozart,  Wolfgang's sister or his parents. The family lived and breathed through the  European Aristocratic approval of their small musical family. The children were known for possessing fine Musical skills yet, due to the era, Women could not be taken seriously in any form of professional level talent. Anna isn't taught the fine skills of composition, Yet,it is her skills that are appreciated by a welcoming audience.  Father Mozart is a man of his time and behaves as such. He shares the all too common view, that to teach a woman anything serious ""would be a mockery"" since Anna is a woman and will never use the skills.  This is a unique telling of the Mozart story, one we are lucky to see unfold on the screen. Anna did her very best to be hidden from appreciation of her skills and to have the glory of her brother be the family legacy.  The fine details, the re-creation of the Mozart world, the glorious rooms of the Aristocracy and the poverty of life on the muddy, snow covered roads across Europe, All are re-created to share this small historical voice with you.

It also does a good job showing how much they had to sacrifice for their music; not just in luxuries, but in their daily lives, in constant travel, and in relationships.

I like Nannerl's friend's conversation with her near the end... that God had wanted them to be girls for a reason, and had they been boys, their lives would have been drastically different.

I think what I like most about this movie is the pace and the meaning behind every gesture.  It didn't seem slow to me at all, but it wasn't a fast pace either.  Each moment was significant.",1369872000,,703,4.384615384615385

4675143,2,B005FITIW8,I was surprised by the lack of a solid story here but the lead character is beautiful and easy on the eyes.with that being said those of us that love classical music will enjoy this because it combines humour and music quite well with the struggle of being a female composer in this English contemparary backdrop which is quite lovely.

This movie brought her to life for me, whether or not the characterization is accurate.  This movie is visually beautiful; of course, the music is beautiful.  The sub-titles did not distract from the movie.  I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the Mozart family, period movies, or just loves beauty.",1364515200,,483,4.841463414634147

4675193,5,B005FITIW8,This movie is a very close depiction of life in that time. It's so sad that women were underestimated and confined to the limitations imposed by men.

I ended up buying it, because I know that I'll watch it again.",1362441600,,385,4.579710144927536

Felt a part of Mozart's Sister's life and knew how she felt when her father and the rest of society refused to admit her talent. It showed how society was dictated by custom, such as the custom of woman's place to listen to men tell her what was acceptable, and the custom of marrying into an arranged marriage.",1361836800,,385,4.514285714285714

The costuming was wonderful and the atmosphere gave you the idea of what it was like to live during those years (e.g. creaky wooden floors, candle light and lanterns.)

We get it, Nanerl is overlooked by everyone in favor of her younger brother...annnnd? What else? Perhaps if maybe one of these characters were likable to the point of being able to connect with them, I would have enjoyed this movie at least a little bit. The dialogue was not only boring, but delivered in such a monotone, emotionless way that it seemed as if everyone in this movie were on horse tranquilizers while filing.

I had very high hopes for this, I love period film, but come on. At least TRY.",1358467200,,617,4.460176991150442

Don't waste your money on it--They skipped much of the story -- this could have been a really great movie but for some reason the producers and directors missed the chance to do a good job.
What were they thinking??????",1354752000,,343,4.34375
4675219,5,B005FITIW8,I enjoyed the movie.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys classical music.  What a shame she could not enjoy having her music heard by the multitudes.,1354320000,,156,4.535714285714286
4675230,5,B005FITIW8,"This movie was recommended to us by a friend.  It tells a story of Mozart's sister.  Who knew he had a sister!

4675232,4,B005FITIW8,I loved being educated about yet another missing in history and brilliant woman. To follow her story is tragic and to know what she wanted to contribute is hard to let go of. The movie follows this story passionately. Apparently it is a family affair with many of the same family name listed in production and acting credits. Clearly it is a labor of love. Beautifully done.,1348185600,4,374,4.597014925373134
4675233,5,B005FITIW8,"This was a perfect film to watch on a rainy evening. The fact that it was subtitled melted into insignificance after about 15 minutes, and I really felt that the period was not only well-portrayed through the costumes and settings, but also in the restrained acting. I will try to watch it again on a higher quality screen, because I know I missed a lot of the texture and detail on my non-HD computer screen.",1347926400,7,409,4.466666666666667
4675234,5,B005FITIW8,It was very well done. You really got to see how Mozart's sister found it hard to showcase her own talents. The costumes and sets were true to the period.,1347235200,4,154,4.166666666666667
4675235,3,B005FITIW8,"At first, when I realized that the characters in the movie all speak only French, I was disappointed. However the acting is so good and the emotions and feelings so well portrayed that the closed-captioning sufficiently makes up for the language barrier. Immediately I felt drawn in to the story. There were a couple of scenes thouggh that were perhaps prolonged a little more than necessary, and other scenes should have been omitted altogether because they were irrelevant and unnecessary (such as the scene where Nannerl discovers what her parents do in bed at night, or the scene where her male friend makes her come to his bed and kiss him, only to throw her out of his room later). Overall, the story builds up to make the viewer pity poor Nannerl and her unfulfilling life. In the end, just when I was hoping to see some resolution, instead I was disappointed to see that although she lived a long life it was not necessarily a happy one. So the movie basically just builds up anticipation only to crush the viewer's hopes, again and again.

I gave it three stars because there were some cute moments in the movie. I especially enjoyed watching Wolfgang's interactions with Nannerl. All of the acting was excellent, and the costumes and imagery made me feel as if I truly had gone back in time. I even forgot that I was reading closed-captioning to understand. My main complaint is just that the resolution of the story was rather dis-satisfactory.",1344038400,4,1455,4.728346456692913
4675236,1,B005FITIW8,"The idea of presenting Mozart's sister certainly has merit, but was done in the most boring way with a mediocre acting and script.  The costumes and life style of the period, however, were accurate.",1343779200,3,198,4.823529411764706
4675237,3,B005FITIW8,"I love period pieces because the acting is usually superb. However, I felt as if the young actress playing Nannerl was a robot! She hardly showed any emotion - when she wiped away tears as she was burning her music, I didn't even know she was crying. There seemed to be no emotional inflection in her speech. This, however, could be because I don't speak French and might be part of the language barrier. Despite this, I think this film was good. I really liked the idea of it - the oppression of a young girl's talent. Some parts were a bit choppy. For example, when Nannerl stayed in Paris on her own, it took me a while to get that she was by herself and I was a bit confused at first. Overall, I'm not upset that I watched this film, but I'm not going to remember it in two days.",1339113600,,783,4.157894736842105

4675239,5,B005FITIW8,"This film took me completely by surprise. As a period piece, it satisfies to the greatest possible detail in visual and cultural accuracy, pulling us right into the lives and times so vividly that we can breathe it... or struggle to breathe as we so keenly feel the struggles. But to label this simply as a period piece would be a great injustice.

Superbly written and directed, this deep and lavish story of the lives within a family and the society it moved in, and especially that of a young woman so blessed with talent and yet thrust into such stifling conformity that manages to destroy the minds of some and the lives of others.

Every role -- every single role -- was impeccably performed by these amazing actors. But shining above them all was Marie Fret whose intensity of withheld emotions felt all the more powerful by her subtlety and restraint. I want to see her again and again.

I can't remember another film that gripped me so completely that I sat riveted to the screen until the final credits had disappeared, wishing I could pull it back for more.",1337904000,45,1068,4.5811518324607325

8469987,5,B005FITIW8,"This is an absolutely fabulous movie.  The music alone (it comes with a music-only CD included) is well worth the ""price of admission""!  The life of the travelling ""virtuoso"" in the time of The Sun King is fascinatingly depicted with great accuracy.  The real heart of this movie is the sister's gradual relinquishing of the lead role in the Mozart family's duo of musical wonders to take the backseat, supporting role for her younger brother that was imposed upon her by the cultural requirements of the time due to her gender.  Her reluctant surrender is so compassionately portrayed in this film it is likely to make one weep.  If that doesn't do it, then the lush backgrounds, exquisite wardrobe, and courtly grandeur that fills almost every frame very well might.  Then there's the music...  This is a movie you don't want to miss.  You really don't!

This film is in French, however, so you will have to ride the ""Pause"" button on your remote in order to read all of the dialog.  This is very well worth doing, especially the first couple of times you watch this historically-based dramatic masterpiece, so you can take in all of the immensely fascinating details provided, along with the lofty refinements and very subtle nuances of conversation used in the very pinnacle of European society.",1507766400,,1299,4.83710407239819
8469988,4,B005FITIW8,"There may not be a lot of history in this script, but when all in said and done, it' offers an imaginative response to the question of what it was to be sitting around the Mozart table.  Sure, one wants to see what Wolfgang is up to, but it's always in the background . Instead the film focuses on Nannerl and gives response to the question of what might she have faced as a talent woman of the day. There are quibbles about the pace of the film and some of the coincidental meetings and Shakespearean cross dressing, but, hey, if one could accept the plot of any opera, Mozart's Sister is a good way to spend two hours.",1505174400,,620,4.2100840336134455
