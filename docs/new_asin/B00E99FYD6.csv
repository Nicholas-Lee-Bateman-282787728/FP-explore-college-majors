I should have expected it, William Devane was awesome though. Blood and guts involved",1383264000,,132,4.782608695652174
5897900,4,B00E99FYD6,"Irish immigrants move to the new world and bring along a leprechaun.  Generations later, their decedents pay the price for their foolishness.  The movie could have gone in so many directions.  It chose to be silly.  I blame Billy Zane.  His idea of acting involves stuttering incessantly and wearing a silly hat.  I'm not sure what mood he was trying for but it just didn't work for me.  The story he tells to explain how he lost his wife will have you scratching your head in wonder and confusion.  He is the only reason the movie got four stars instead of 5.  The special effects, the story, the production value (given the budget they had to work with) are all top notch for a low budget movie.  Courtney Halverson was perfect in her role but once again, her interaction with Dad Billy Zane REALLY pulled down the scene.  The other characters in the movie ranged from acceptable to down-right talented.  All in all, a good way to waste an evening.  Possibly the best part of the movie is the sound track.  Johnny Jump Up by Ice Cream Fire is a winner.  I would definitely recommend this movie to fans of the horror comedy genera, people who enjoy Irish Mythology, and those out there who just like to hear Billy Zane stutter poignantly.",1382659200,,1239,4.518018018018018
5897901,5,B00E99FYD6,"Just watched this fantastic little horror film, and i must say that it is one of the top 10 horror films that i have watch recently. It has all the great ingredients of a perfect film... Excellent storyline.. fantastic scenery... nice soundtrack...Awesome acting by Billy Zane.. William Devane... and Courney Halverson..(such a talented and cute actress). I found this film to be very suspenseful.. sat on the edge of my seat most of the movie... not a dull moment. At first i was thinking that this was another remake of the Leprechaun series... but it is completely different... and a whole lot scarier. The Leprechaun was really a awesomely creepy, and totally freaky. The film had numerous bloody and gory scenes, and made me a little bit squeamish. Very good special effects along with great lighting and music score. Just wish that the movie could have had a little more romance and more of some love scenes between the main actress and her boyfriend. Was kind of thinking that the sheriff was going to get to know his very attractive female deputy more too. Overall, i give this film 5 stars, it kept my interest and found every minute of it very enjoyable. This film i am sure would be liked by both guys and gals.... careful that you don't spill drinks or popcorn on your partner.. alot of make you jump scenes. Again this film i definitely plan on adding to my DVD collection.",1382400000,2,1386,4.661224489795918
5897902,2,B00E99FYD6,"THIS IS Leprechaun's Revenge WAS it really that serious changing the name and cover i'm just glad i rented it in advance,..well good luck people",1382054400,2,144,4.8
5897903,2,B00E99FYD6,"*I received an advance review copy of this movie from the distribution company.

Have you ever seen a company do something so out of character that you wondered what the true motives behind the action were?  I am wondering that very thing in regard to why Lionsgate picked up RED CLOVER to distribute.  I have seen some really bad movies in my time, but RED CLOVER ranks way up towards the top of the list.

The first glaring error to me about this film is that the plot synopsis pretty much has nothing to do with the movie.  The town in which the film is set is not Irish Channel, nor is it in Louisiana.  It's actually a town called Kenning in Massachusetts.  There's never a mention of a massacre or a storm, nor is there any talk about St. Patrick's Day festivities being banned.  So, pretty much omit the synopsis above.  The film is about an evil leprechaun that curses a girl and then kills all of her friends.

Yup, that's pretty much it.  Why is she cursed?  I don't know...the film never says.  But she has a clover burned into her palm and the leprechaun hunts her for unknown reasons, although he doesn't kill her when he catches her and instead decides to hunt down other townsfolk.  Make sense?  Nope, not to me, either.

RED CLOVER is shot well, although that is one of only two positive points about the film.  The second is the gore; while not excellent, it is still well done and looks good onscreen.  But those two positives certainly cannot save this masterpiece of a mess.

One aspect that bugged me the most is the dialogue.  It is atrocious.  At one point, one of the characters talks about ""pimp-slapping that leprechaun"" until it's dead.  I don't know if it was a serious comment or an attempt to inject humor into the scene, but it did not work either way.  It actually made me angry.

Another big negative for me is when the leprechaun actually gets into a guy's car and runs him over with it to kill him.  Keep in mind the creature looks like Pumpkinhead, so imagine it behind the wheel of a car.  Driving.  To run over someone.  Then it puts the car in reverse and backs up.

REALLY??  Are you serious?  A hideous creature with fangs and claws that has been disemboweling and dismembering people decides to drive a car to kill someone?  I almost shut the movie off at this point but instead I drudged on.

For the past decade, Lionsgate has pumped out a massive list of hit titles, and they still continue to do so.  But I seriously cannot believe they put their name on this one; RED CLOVER is not worth watching, even when it was on the Syfy Channel.  As much as I wanted to like it, I cannot recommend it at all.  It's not even so-bad-it's-good.

The movie hits shelves next week if you want to give it a look.",1381708800,10,2743,4.360396039603961
5897907,5,B00E99FYD6,this a great dvd and i love the different versions on ancient myths on lephracans and it was fun to watch,1406160000,,105,4.0476190476190474
5897908,3,B00E99FYD6,This actually turned out to be a pretty entertaining horror film for me. If you take it for what it is (B-grade horror movie about an ancient Leprechaun) and just enjoy it then you won't be let down! What more can you ask for than Sheriff Billy Zane on patrol while a murderous Leprechaun is on a killing spree! Definitely worth a watch in my book.,1400284800,2,348,4.287878787878788
5897909,1,B00E99FYD6,At no point was this film any good.. Worst lead ever holes all in the plot. Poorly written to say the least. Save your money,1397865600,,124,4.0
5897910,1,B00E99FYD6,"Yeah, I saw this on SyFy channel (albeit with a different name). Couldn't even finish watching it for free on TV. Forget about paying for rental. If you like SyFy's brand of cheesy & campy movies, then, well, maybe. But for the grown-ups, ore even mature kids: No. Just No.",1390608000,,273,4.48
5897911,5,B00E99FYD6,"Very good ""B"" flick here !! Good cast of actors and the creature is awesome. Every neighborhood should have at least one.",1388102400,2,121,4.545454545454546
5897912,2,B00E99FYD6,"A young woman hunting with her grandpa picks a red clover, unwittingly releasing a very nasty leprechaun and putting a death curse on herself unless she can trap the monster and return it to where it was buried.  This actually has a lot going for it--it's not a vampire movie or a zombie movie or a paranormal activity rip-off;  it has an extremely likable cast; it's from After Dark Films which generally has pretty good quality control.  Unfortunately this horror comedy is never particularly suspenseful or amusing and for a movie that is generally light-hearted it shows a badly misjudged callousness towards the killing of its major characters.  This is worth sitting through once but it could have been so much better.",1387584000,,724,4.909836065573771
5897913,5,B00E99FYD6,"What did you expect from a leprechaun horror film. It is very campy and the gore satisfies. Originally aired on Syfy as Leprechaun's revenge.  It stars the beautiful Courtney Halverson as Karen O'Hara who is cursed from picking a red clover and unleashes a bloodthirsty Leprechaun.  There is the wacky Billy Zane as the town sheriff O'Hara (her father)  who tells a strange story of how her mother died shopping on black friday,  The Leprechaun can drive and runs over somebody with their own car after honking at them (funny scene),  When the protagonists have enough of the Leprechaun's shenanigans they band together for a good ole'  ""Pimp slapping"" of the Leprechaun.  It's super campy and one of those movies you watch with the aid of a few pints or drams.  Oh and It is still better than the Warrick Davis series.",1386374400,2,819,4.71830985915493
5897914,2,B00E99FYD6,"Evil Leprechaun brutally kills town folk, no one believes the leading actress, but people still get killed. I didn't see all of this terrible movie. Didn't know Leprechauns could drive a car. I guess it was going to make its big appearance at the town's St. Patrick's Day celebration, but I couldn't wait for it.",1384992000,,312,4.6909090909090905
5897915,1,B00E99FYD6,"Reviewed by Amanda Jane Volovik ""Chava"": A Perfunctory red-headed, green-eyed Irish-American girl heroine pitted against the not-so-Lucky Charms Leprechaun, more like a Leprechaun/Grinch half-breed that cross-bred with the Alien. That's about it. Instead watch the VERY funny (and sometimes scary) Leprechaun series with Warwick Davis, this one is so dullll....",1383523200,7,361,6.24
5897916,2,B00E99FYD6,"This is a made for TV film original titled ""Leprechaun's Revenge.""  In the small American-Irish town of Keening, Mass. (filmed in Louisiana) Karen (Courtney Halverson) picks a red clover and gets cursed by a fairy creature known as the Lu-chor-pain, the Gaelic word for Leprechaun, perhaps the reason why they changed the name of the film.

Billy Zane plays Sheriff Conor O'Hara, her dad. Karen realizes she is cursed between the wild stories from her drunken grandfather (William Devane) and the Internet. She has 4 days to confront the Luchorpain or die.

This is not the best film for Zane fans. The story had me bored. While there is some blood and guts, much of the killing is hidden and the creature looks rubbery.

8602896,5,B00E99FYD6,"This is a fun, B-grade movie that is littered with American-ized pseudo Celtic history, a few Celtic knots and unfortunately a few stereotypes.  It has a great female lead, and a few good one-liners. This is a good film to watch if one needs to unwind after a long day at work.",1524441600,,277,4.326923076923077
8602897,5,B00E99FYD6,"Have always liked this movie....only shown around St. Patrick's Day.  Strange,  gory, even somewhat comical at times, includes some well known great actors.....you either like it or don't like it.",1492473600,,196,5.5
8602898,3,B00E99FYD6,"Not by far. Especially if you have a houseful of tipsy people to entertain. Red Clover, as the blurb promises, does indeed have an excellent cast, as B movies go. Billy Zane plays the doubting sheriff (you know there always is one in these movies, but he isn't always played by Billy Zane). William Devane is hilarious as his father the town ne'er-do-well, who keeps the old ways and likes his whiskey. Courtney Halverson as the sheriff's daughter is an excellent and appropriately red-haired Final Girl. The premise is pretty engaging: a small Massachusetts town settled by Irish immigrants has a legend that they brought a leprechaun over from the old world and angered it, resulting in a supernatural vendetta in the new world. Karen O'Hara and her grandfather are hunting in the woods when they find the eponymous red clover, and awaken the curse. Monster shenanigans ensue. On that note, the monster design is pretty good too, and the music is not distracting. What doesn't work: substituting Louisiana for Massachusetts. Come on. We can tell. Also: the cinematography. Shaky cam doesn't add anything interesting to the proceedings here. Neither does desaturating the color scheme. The transitions are sloppy too. There are so many lines that are laugh out loud funny (which are not supposed to be) that is almost makes up for it, though. Here are a couple free ones: ""You want my gold tooth?"" (said to a monster pointing at its teeth). ""Lily? Are you eating something?"" (said when the speaker hears voracious slurping noises coming out of the break-room). And my favorite, ""What's a leprechaun doing in my town, Dad?"" Leprechaun it ain't but if you're binging goofy movies on St. Patrick's Day you could do a lot worse than this one.",1489708800,,1739,4.898305084745763
8602899,5,B00E99FYD6,I only wanted to see this movie because William Devane was in it. Who played on Knots Landing for years as Greg Summner. I enjoyed the movie very much.,1485648000,,151,4.241379310344827
8602900,5,B00E99FYD6,"Awesome leprechaun movie !!! I think this one is a good movie , decent plot to the movie and great story to it , I do recommend it to everyone that is into Gory stuff and Leprechaun fans.",1469145600,,187,3.9473684210526314
8602901,3,B00E99FYD6,"This film has a lot of discrepancies between the blurb and the actual plot. It was filmed in Louisiana but the fictional setting is in Massachusetts. Supposedly years before something killed many of the townspeople during a St Patrick's Day celebration and since then they haven't observed that day. There's no mention of that at all in the movie. The people are preparing for a St Pat's parade and that's that.  Their back story is that the original immigrants captured a leprechaun, smuggled it to America, forced it to give up its gold, then buried it in the woods, and that's how the town got its start...from a supposedly gold mine in a state which has no gold...and no one got suspicious?

Anyway, our heroine discovers the remains of the leprechaun's grave and a mass of clover in the midst of which grows a red 4-leafed one. Not good luck. She picked it, it burns a 4-leafed symbol into her palm and the leprechaun crawls out of his grave. Seems someone removed the protective iron horseshoes from around it...though why they did is anyone's guess, also the fact that there are dozens of horseshoes nailed on trees surrounding the grave don't seem to work.  Another fact not adding up.  Researching the Internet (what would we do without it in horror movies?) and with the help of a would-be boyfriend, she discovers the burn mark means she has to face the leprechaun and defeat it or die in four days.  It seems that curse also includes the entire town since a good many of them are killed off before she and the creature have their final showdown.

This leprechaun is more like the fabled Green Man or Hern the Hunter (minus the antlers) than the cute little guy with the red whiskers and green hat we're so accustomed to. Even Warwick Davis was closer to the mark on that one.  He also eats gold instead of merely hoarding it. One shudders to think how the original settlers made him ""give up"" his gold.  Now all he wants is to get more gold to consume--from gold teeth to jewelry--and woe be to whoever is the possessor of what he wants.

No one's spared in this movie so don't expect much of a happy ending.  Billy Zane and William DeVane carry it off well, though the costume department's choice of a hat for Sheriff Zane was a silly short-brimmed thing for a lawman to be wearing. It was a distraction whenever he was onscreen. A cowboy hat or even a trooper's would've been much more appropriate. Was there a low budget for costumes?

It's well-acted and fast-moving. They don't waste time with a big build-up or voice-overs explaining anything, but there was still something lacking. Perhaps a short prologue might've helped.

This movie was viewed via a rental DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1463097600,,2746,4.616016427104722
8602902,2,B00E99FYD6,"This movie oddly had all of the previews and lead up indicating it to be part of the After Dark collection, but it's not marketed that way. I didn't realize it was a SyFy movie, but that makes sense now that I know. It was pretty much on par with what they tend to put together. Teenage girl picks a red clover while hunting with her grandfather. Apparently this makes her a target for the (least leprechaun looking) leprechaun that the townsfolk had previously sucked all the luck out of. Meh at best.",1428537600,,502,4.408602150537634
