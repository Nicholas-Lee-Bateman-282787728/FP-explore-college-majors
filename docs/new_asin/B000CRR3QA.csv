8101395,2,B000CRR3QA,"This movie is NOT based on Zane Grey's novel ""Under The Tonto Rim"", formerly known as ""The Bee Keeper.""  The leading lady is Lucy in both the book and the DVD, but that is where the similarity ends.  In the DVD Lucy is the villain's sister and the hero owns a stagecoach line.  Edd Denmeade in the book is the beekeeper, a backwoods giant of a man who is Lucy's protector and champion.

I was very disappointed in this movie.  As a story, it is okay, but it is NOT ""Under the Tonto Rim"".  It's only fair to alert Zane Grey fans that this is not his story.",1331424000,4,555,4.092592592592593
