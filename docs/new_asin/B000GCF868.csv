2604763,5,B000GCF868,Totally loved this DVD series.  I remember it playing on television years ago and have often tried getting but failed to find it.  I was thrilled when I was able to purchase this.,1358380800,2,179,4.393939393939394
2604764,5,B000GCF868,"I have been yearning to watch this series again after having seen the original run so many years ago.  I was in boarding school in Denmark, and every Sunday evening just about every single person in the dorm, including headmistress and tutors, gathered in the formal parlor for tea and to watch the show.  Hippie, preppie, whatever, we were all united by this wonderful series.  It was fantastic and I've been searching for it high and low.  Does anyone know if/when there will be a complete set done in the US DVD format?  Thanks!!!!",1320105600,,534,4.638297872340425
2604765,5,B000GCF868,"Created by (and mostly written by) John Finch, this is a terrific series of 52 episodes, following the Ashton family of Liverpool through the war years, 1938-1945. Writing and acting are superb, and you will be hooked from the first episode until the end. The entire series of ""A Family at War"" is now available on DVD. However, be sure your DVD player supports Region 2 (PAL) discs, as Region 1 (NTSC) machines will not be able to play them. Why, oh why, has this fantastic series never been released in the Region 1 (NTSC) format, so North American viewers can enjoy it?",1316563200,,572,4.563106796116505

2604767,5,B000GCF868,"I have finally bought a multisystem and can now watch this excellent series on a Region 2 DVD! It is a shame it is not available in Region 1, the US is missing out on something truly great. I remember this series from the 70's when I watched it back home in Sweden and I loved it then and it is still as good. For all other fortunate Americans that have multisystems, I can recommend ""Secret Army"", a British series also from the 70's. Do NOT confuse it with the silly ""Allo, Allo"". These two TV-series is British TV at its very best!",1240358400,9,534,4.194174757281553
2604768,5,B000GCF868,"This excellent reproduction by Acorn Media of the entire suite of episodes of this classic British television series, recorded in 1970, is an item to savour. Recognized by many as the best television series ever produced it features an outstanding cast including a very young John Nettles (Bergerac; Midsomer  Murders) and is all the more remarkable considering that the highest quality of production, script writing (John Finch) and performance were achieved on a shoe string budget. Excellent restoration work was undertaken on the master tapes by Acorn to ensure an almost faultless product in spite of the age of the recordings.  Prospective purchasers are invited to visit the website [...] to relive snippets of the series and to experience a small sample of the pleasures in store for those who purchase this 22 DVD set at what is a bargain price for such quality.

Be aware that the series is recorded in the PAL colour system and in the Region 2/4 configuration, appropriate to the UK and Australia. In the USA, players able to cope with PAL rather than NTSC and region 2 rather than region 1 need to be used. The item arrived at my household in Australia in perfect condition in an amazingly short time frame. Not only is the product outstanding but the supplier is highly professional and recommended without hesitation.",1236556800,7,1331,4.933035714285714

8130589,5,B000GCF868,"I was stationed in England in the early 70s, and watched this series then. We have since purchased this series, but it requires a DVD player for that region, which I have. I didn't remember most of it, but a good series about how an English family was affected by WWII. A great series. Highly recommend.",1490054400,,303,4.428571428571429

8130592,4,B000GCF868,"Fascinating times told through the lives of an extended family.  This looks very realistic even though it was done on a small budget.  Does an excellent job of showing how the war changed every one's life, not just the enlisted.",1475884800,,228,4.675
8130593,4,B000GCF868,I loved seeing it again but unfortunately the final disc is faulty and I was unable to see the last episode properly.,1426464000,,117,4.363636363636363
8130594,5,B000GCF868,"This is a brilliant BBC series from the 1970s. It was my favourite then and reliving the experience was a joy. Amazon's delivery was amazingly swift. It has hours of wonderful. heart-warming viewing.
Excellent value for your investment.",1392249600,5,236,5.2368421052631575
8130595,4,B000GCF868,"Very interesting WWII story line, and different from many others because it's set in Liverpool, not London.  The Germans bombed Liverpool to destroy the docks and its importance to shipping, and that is woven into the story.  This was made about 45 years ago, so we have to forgive the way some episodes drift slightly into soap-opera style.  Overall, a good look at how hard the war hit the middle class family.  One strange thing about my set, though, was one of the disks was a terrible mash-up of mixed parts of episodes, titles, and it jumped around and froze.  It surely is a manufacturing mistake, and nobody else offering a review mentioned this about their collection, but it happened with mine, which was very disappointing since I couldn't view those episodes.  Setting that complaint aside, this is amazingly good to watch after so many years, and the low production values actually enhance it, in my opinion.  It makes it more believable, having it not be so polished and perfect.  If you are well-read about the war years in England, you'll notice a lot of tidbits in the story that have significance, but the writers didn't explain them at all, which is too bad.  For example, at the end of the war when Germany is aiming the V1 and later V2 rocket bombs at England from across the channel, one of the characters says he never heard anything so loud, but what it was isn't explained.  FYI, those bombs hit the ground at about 3000 mph, so the sound and damage were tremendous.  It's curious that a brief family discussion around the newspaper, or radio, wasn't woven into the story about this last main threat from Germany, not too long before the war ended.",1386115200,9,1673,4.656462585034014
