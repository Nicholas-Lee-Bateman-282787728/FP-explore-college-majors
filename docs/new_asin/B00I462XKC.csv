The animation itself is beautiful.  A number of the characters are a bit puzzling.  But I enjoyed it.  This is a successor to a number of anime on the same theme of the relationship of these eight and how they search for each other and find each other.  Lots of swords.",1396051200,4,435,4.3625

8639083,5,B00I462XKC,"Love this anime. The main character is just so cute and slightly brat like, but very charming. His interactions with his friends is great and the story behind why he's a kid when he should be 17 is interesting. A great anime i own both seasons. I hope they do another season.",1420070400,,275,4.3076923076923075

8639085,5,B00I462XKC,"This is such a beautiful and great anime. The characters and story are interesting while the animation is beautiful and even the english dubbing is great. Now I can only hope they dub and release the second half because this is only the first 13 eps.
There's so many themes here - hot guys, fantasy, history, drama, some horror, friendship and action. There's even a bit of boy love in there. Overall a fantastic series that kept me hooked to the point that I watched all 13 eps in one sitting!",1402012800,,494,4.43956043956044
8639086,5,B00I462XKC,"Shino and Sosuke were one the brink of death when a strange man offered them a choice... Did they want to survive so badly that they were willing to give up their humanity and live as freaks? Or would they rather let their lives snuff out? Both decided at that moment to cast aside all shame and live! Now Shino shares his body with Murasame and Sosuke shares his body with the family dog, Yoshiro. The two try to live humble lives with their foster sister, Hamaji, but the Church won't stand for it. It desperately wants the secret to eternal youth, so the three must seek shelter in the Imperial Capital under one of the Four Houses of the Sacred Beasts. But the master of the house won't offer help without a fee. He wants Shino to find six men with special gems, just like his and Sosuke's. Will he be up to the task?

How far would you be willing to go to live? What would you be willing to do for the sake of your friends? These are questions that Hakkenden: Eight Dogs of the East poses. It is truly a touching show about life and friendship, with plenty of excitement thrown in to keep things from getting too heavy. The voice actors do a lovely job and the music fits in every scene. The last few episodes are especially breathtaking.

This contains both Japanese and English audio tracks, so fans of either should be happy. This is one of the few dubs where the voice actress actually sings! >.< It's definitely worth checking out. There are also some Japanese audio commentaries, filled with neat info on the show.

Personally, I think this is a great buy for anyone interested in fantasy stories about boys going on a journey to become men.",1400284800,,1652,4.409836065573771
