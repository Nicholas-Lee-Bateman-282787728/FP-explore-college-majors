Our league reviews almost every baseball resource to see if it is worthwhile to share with our coaches. A manager in our minor division brought this video to my attention. The content is relevant for players 7-12 years old though upper level teams should take notice of the wonderful fundamentals this program offers. Coaches should integrate about 2-4 drills per week and build from there reinforcing previous drills. We have followed this model and our players not only loved the drills but have improved as the season went on. This video should be required viewing for all youth coaches and Little Leagues.

some exceptional drills, skills, techniques and more.
Teams that are fortunate enough to practice during the season
will be able to utilize the content which will
translate into improvement on the field during games.
This program worked better than expected with our team.

us in most games. I can't wait for next year when my
10 and 11 year old players will have a solid foundation thanks
to this program.",1256601600,,512,4.7

As is the case with young players, practice and repetition are the keys to success and FIELDING DRILLS & TECHNIQUES point you in the right direction.",1246060800,,477,4.975
