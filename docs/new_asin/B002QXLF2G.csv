8583642,4,B002QXLF2G,Billy Robinson gives a great amount of detail for the basics of Catch as Catch Can Wrestling from the footwork to take-downs. The only reason I would not give the full 5 stars is because the audio is not the greatest and it can be difficult at times to understand what Billy is saying. Other than the audio issue this is a must buy for those who want to know the basics of catch wrestling.,1338768000,,389,4.2
