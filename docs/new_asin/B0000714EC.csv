Ms. Knight.....where we find Ms. Patti OUTDO-ING 'HERSELF'. What a treat to have in my memory.....just want to see it again.

This lady is unmatched....untouched....unbelievable. Even her latest venture into TV commercials make me stop and watch.

Go ahead and divorce Ms. Patti....I will wait to marry YOU!!",1147132800,,556,5.224719101123595
7973689,5,B0000714EC,"This extremely talented ""down-to-earth"" lady is tops.  You can't help but enjoy not only her talent but the essence of her as a person.  That is what draws people to Patti but the ""voice"" is in a class by itself.  She is a treasure and with this dvd you get to know Patti as she is honest, open, and upfront about everything.",1125964800,3,325,4.209677419354839
7973690,4,B0000714EC,"For all those who love Patti LaBelle's singing and hairstyles, you will be pleased here.  Patti admits that she had a nose job; I guess Michael Jackson isn't the only black singer with nose issues.  Patti hints that she and Diana Ross have a huge rivalry.  Who knew?  For real, Patti could sing Diana into the ground, so why compare them?  This disc is full of cool guests such as Bill Clinton, Jasmine Guy, and others.  Lutha is here slim and obviously years before his tragic health problems emerged.  Patti is wearing a fierce, red leather jacket in this interview.

Patti's ex-husband makes it sound like he loves her with all his heart and will carry a torch for her forever.  So Patti does not make sense when she explains why she divorced him.  Black women, such as Terri MacMillan, Missy Elliott, and others, have said good black men are hard to find, so why did Patti leave one?  It doesn't make sense; it hurts my heart a little to see this cute, couple fall apart.  They could have been Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee if they kept at it.

Though this film includes a lot, it misses a lot as well.  They discuss ""Lady Marmalade,"" but they don't mention ""New Attitude"" and ""On My Own"" which I think really brought her back into the spotlight.  They speak of her skyscraper hairdos and kicking off her shoes, but they do not talk about her activist work around diabetes.  Lately Patti has been a mother hen to Mariah Carey, Fantasia Barrino, and many other young singers.  I wish they would have featured that aspect of this generous and powerful sister.

I think Patti is the only woman featured in the ""Journeys in Black"" series.  BET needs to do something to change that.  As far as I know, their viewership is equally gendered or female-dominated, so they should rethink their androcentrism.",1113523200,5,1797,4.5736677115987465
