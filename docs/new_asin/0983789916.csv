7795222,5,0983789916,"I use this curriculum set and DVD with middle school students (grade 5-8). They love the cheesy humor and can really identify with the real-life case. It has a great balance of light-and-heavy themes, so that students understand it is serious, but do not tune it out because it is upsetting/depressing. This is a great DVD to remind students to be thoughtful and kind in online postings. The company is very helpful as well - the DVD was lost/thrown out during summer months shortly after ordering, and they sent a replacement!  Great service, wonderful DVD, great classroom tools...A+!",1349827200,,586,4.979591836734694
7795223,5,0983789916,"The Wild Wild Web is a fast paced, totally entertaining presentation that tackles the very serious topic of cyber bulling. As an elementary school librarian, I have shown the DVD to hundreds of 11 and 12 year olds who have enjoyed watching it while learning how to recognize cyber bullying, hearing true life cases of the damage it can do, and most importantly, how to stop it from happening to them and others.
Dr. Phil makes a cameo appearance as he is testifying before congress on the seriousness of cyber bullying. This is contrasted by the wacky antics of the narrator. Many scenes are filmed in schools and classrooms with students appearing as themselves.
The length of 26 minutes is perfect for the classroom. The DVD comes with a helpful discussion guide, including an alignment with academic standards. I highly recommend using The Wild, Wild Web as a way to educate students about cyber bullying.",1319760000,,908,4.864516129032258

Luckily the folks at Twisted Scholar Productions have written a fun and educational video for all ages to tackle this subject. My kids and I have really benefitted from this video which concentrates on cyber bullying - which brought up lots of topics and conversation at the dinner table - and it makes me want to check out other videos in the series including Gum in My Hair.
