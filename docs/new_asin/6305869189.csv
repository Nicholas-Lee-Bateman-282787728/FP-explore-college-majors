1085437,5,6305869189,"I was fortunate enough to be included in the audience at this very taping.  I've always been a Jeffrey Osborne fan and was eagerly anticipating the performance.  I was amazed and delighted that this soul singer's voice aged as well as the singer himself.  Admittedly, I'm not that fond of the new material (save ""That's For Sure""), but I'm old school to my core and I loved the performances of his old songs.  Particularly impressive was the ""unplugged"" version of ""On The Wings of Love.""  True Jeffrey Osborne fans will absolutely revel in this wonderful performance.  That performance alone justifies the cost of this DVD.  Enjoy!",989452800,3,632,4.90566037735849
1085438,5,6305869189,"It may not ever be fair to review jeffrey's work I AM IN LOVE WITH HIM!  He has extraordinary vocals and he never ceases to amaze me. And just for good measure he is nicely buffed up. Buy this DVD It has great vocals, all the way round.",981763200,3,236,3.9166666666666665
1085439,4,6305869189,"Jeffrey still has the power and the charisma and other reviewers have already given praise to the high quality of both the picture and sound of this DVD, it is DTS at it's best.
His audience is rightly enthralled by his performance and they know his material word for word.
Why then does he feel the need to mess with his classic songs be breaking into tricks with an echo chamber and a channel fader?
It may please the `woopers' and `whistlers' but in my view it breaks the flow of his well-loved material and degrades the performance. I had wanted to listen to a techno record, I would have bought one.
Buy the DVD, you will love it, but be pepared to fast forward through the techno-highjinks.",980121600,,696,4.4453125
1085440,5,6305869189,"If You Love Soul music you cannot be helped to be physically moved by this concert,Jeffrey puts in a superb performance singing all his greatest hits and really rocks the house,The audience are all really enjoying themselves and Jeffrey gets them all involved in the show. I highly recommend this concert and I can't wait for the other shows due for release in this BET FOR JAZZ collection, Sound and Picture quality is excellant. The only thing I would have improved was the interview on the special features,the audio was drowned out and I wish we could have had this full screen In the U.K we do not see enough of these artists. Multiple camara angles would have also been nice to add an extra realism to the concert on DVD.",972864000,5,727,4.557251908396947
1085484,5,6305869189,"I love the sound quality of the BET Jazz DVDs.  They make me feel as though I am actually at the concert.  So far I've bought Jeffrey, Bobby Womack, and Lou Rawls.  Jeffrey's performance was great and I was up and dancing on the first song.  It made me want to party.  Jeffrey sounded great.  He sung most of his hits with the exception of Stranger.  I am very glad that I purchased this DVD.  You won't be disappointed.",1262995200,,420,4.227848101265823
1085485,3,6305869189,"This is another of the BET series DVDs with something missing. While picture quality, sound and performance are all excellent I do not receive sound in the center speaker when I select the DTS option. BET studios should look into this engineering mishap in their future releases.",1232928000,,279,4.957446808510638
1085486,4,6305869189,I like this one ok...too many fast songs.....I enjoy Jeffery slow songs. Not enough slow music. But it was ok,1203379200,,109,4.5
1085487,4,6305869189,Jeffrey Osborne gives a pretty good performance. I'm just a bit prejudiced because I saw him with LTD years ago and that was magic. By himself it just feels like something is missing. Can we say 'REUNION',1202342400,,204,4.54054054054054
1085488,5,6305869189,This is a great DVD to add to your collection if you're a fan of Jeffrey Osburne.,1152835200,3,81,3.823529411764706
1085489,5,6305869189,"I got this for getting good grades in the first semester of my 9th Grade Year (Shows My Age!)  This was something I just had to have, my mom said get good grades and I'll get for you, and I did, and she was so proud we came on Amazon and preordered it straight away.  I don't frequent this release as much as I previously did, of course, concert DVDs lose their value quite quickly.  I do fondly remember it alot and come back to it and watch it front to back of course.  Great performance, great artist, and don't forget a rather long and interesting interview.  Good stuff...Get it before it's gone...",1150070400,4,603,4.300884955752212
1085490,5,6305869189,"I have all the BET on Jazz series....Jeffrey Osborne is the best and gtreatest of all.
This is worth buying. He is pouring all of his efforts that he cannot show in Recording CD.",1068249600,14,178,4.264705882352941
1085491,5,6305869189,Jeffrey Osborne still brings the Musical Pain to the stage.while the new songs are so-so in spots His Older Material just sounds even more better with time.the Brother still has soem Serious Chops on Him. His voice has Soul&Warmth&even more when you hear Him Live.this is a Show that showcases how a Pro should sound like. JO has Pressence&solid Musicianship behind Him&alot of fun felt by fans.,1065225600,9,395,4.91044776119403
1085492,5,6305869189,"OUTSTANDING!!!  This is the perfect concert to sit back with a good bottle of wine, good company, and just chill to.  Jeffrey takes you on a fantastic voyage, from some of his trademark 80's jams, to a few songs from his newest release (That's for sure), right on through his magical days with LTD.  You may ask yourself, (after all of those years we didn't hear from him) ""does Jeffrey still have it""?  The answer is, ABSOLUTELY!!!!  If you like to enjoy concerts in the comfort of your home, this one is a MUST for your collection..",1048896000,18,534,4.463917525773196

7897080,5,6305869189,This concert was one in a million. Jeffrey is one of the best singers ever. Trust me you would never regret buying this dvd. The only thing that i was a lil disappointed is that it came in the card board dvd holder.
