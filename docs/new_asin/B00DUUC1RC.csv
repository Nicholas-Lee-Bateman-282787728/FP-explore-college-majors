When the economic reports come out saying no pay increases in 50 years for working classes, you will see exactly what they mean in this study.  I would like to play it for Congress!!!",1530489600,,342,4.590163934426229

8598030,5,B00DUUC1RC,"This documentary drives home that the American dream that most of us were raised on is no longer within reach of most Americans. Two families working class families are followed for 20 years: the Neumann and the Stanley families.  At the beginning, both Stanley's and Tony Neumann have lost their high paying manufacturing jobs in Milwaukee in the late 80's.  They all loose health benefits, lifestyles and for the Neumann's eventually their marriage and the house to foreclosure.

The Stanley family pursues entrepreneurial pursuits based on their talents and limited education but the economy and sometimes their race (African American) creates barriers they can't get around. Mr. Stanley takes a menial labor job that pays him about one third his salary and due to job hazards, he gets sick and is hospitalized.  This means huge medical bills (no health benefits) which prevents the rest of the children from going to college.  The first son attends college full-time and survives by working two jobs and credit card advances to pay his way.

Mrs. Neumann takes a variety of hard jobs to supplement the lost income that results when Tony can't find a job and continues working once he finds a job paying less than 60% of his prior employment.  Due to schedules, they rarely see each other, Tony experiences depression and self-esteem issues that cause him to isolate.  The children suffer as well with the instability of the home life.

What I found interesting from a sociological perspective is that while both started as church going families.  The Stanley's modeled a faith and persistent that they would survive no matter what adversities they had to face.  The male children started a lawn care service and worked hard to pitch in financially each summer.  Both spouses demonstrated a strong emotional support to the other and their commitment to their joint goals really made them stronger individually.  It was never explored with the Neumann family how their faith or if their faith helped them through the dark times.

Twenty years later, the Caucasian family appears to be far worse off, Debbie Neumann is living with a friend after she looses her house after more than 20 years of paying a mortgage - J.P. Morgan-Chase refuses to allow her to refinance and due to the high accrual of late fees (around $120,000) which they demand as lump sum all within a few weeks, she can't make this payment.  Thus they put the house in foreclosure.  They sold her house at auction for $38,000.  She is working as a home healthcare worker for several years only being paid slightly above minimum wage and only being given a little over 24 hours of work per week via Medicaid. The postscript informs us, she has gotten full-time work at a nursing home. Her oldest boys are living on welfare, one dropped out of high school while in 10th grade and has one child, the other works lawn care has multiple children with different mother's as well as another on the way with his present girlfriend (he is around 30 y.o.).  Tony, the father refuses to talk on camera.  Their one daughter is married and they are living with her husband's relative, while they save toward a house down payment and he locates employment.

The Neumann's lost the connection of family particularly the marriage.  Though they had gotten marriage and family counseling, it seemed that no one really talked about their feelings, nor were they able to offer mutual encouragement.  Only the daughter seemed to have a happy outlook on the future.  The boys were so beaten down, they came across as believing that this was their fate and seemed surrendered to this.

The one thing the both Stanleys and Debbie Neumann, when asked about retirement, none saw that as an option.  That they would work until their last breath.  That the future was a big question mark and they would cross that bridge when they came to it.

I really admired the Stanley's, after they lost their businesses, they decide to help those less fortunate.  They reached out to the community and did one thing after another to encourage others to fight.  This family is the kind you would want in your community and as next door neighbors.  They understand the secret to life is being their for others and encouraging one another.  They hold on to their believe in a God that will not forsake them and they choose to refuse their struggles to destroy their family relationships.

I felt sorry for the Neumann's. They allowed the harsh realities destroy their relationship (they had played together since they were two y.o. and had been high school sweet-hearts).  Ultimately, this poverty destroyed two sons as well.  My heart broke for them.

There are many other insights this movie offers and it is well-worth the time to watch. In fact, it might be worth a second look, as there are many hidden gems of insight within this production.

Another title might be ""American Dream - Lost Forever?""",1394841600,,4931,4.835518474374255
8598031,5,B00DUUC1RC,"In 1992 TV journalist Bill Moyer and his team chose two then-middle-class couples in Milwaukee - one white and the other black - and decided to follow their lives for ten years, much in the style of the British ""UP"" series (7UP, 14,UP, 21UP, etc.). Shortly after they began filming each of the couples lost their well-paying (well $15/hour, anyway) jobs and their families grew (children), just as the US economy started to sink. Moyers returned to film updates ever two to three years until 2000 and then returned in 2012 to complete the film.

Well-paced and edited (the 90 minutes for this film, shown on PBS' Frontline series this summer passes quickly), this film had me choking up in my throat a few times - especially when Jackie Stanley (the mother in the black family) tells of trying to stay afloat when their financial ship keeps taking on water. Her husband, Claude, was just as riveting to watch and hear, with a work ethic that very few have (one that he taught his children). The Neumann's - the white family - is in the same boat, but the finances make it tough on their home life. I won't say any more about the families - you need to experience this film for yourself - except that, except for one moment,  the race of the two couples has little bearing on how they are affected, nor how they try to survive the economy and at least stay above the poverty line.

This was a 20 year project and it definitely captures real life. I can't recommend this film high enough. I think you too will find that you get a lump in your throat as you watch the Stanleys and the Neumanns  try to keep afloat.

The DVD has no special features except ""Scene Selection""

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
