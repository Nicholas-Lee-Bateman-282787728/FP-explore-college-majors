8430606,4,B004ICDLCU,"This is a wonderful multi-view video of Taiji (Tai Chi) Sword technique.  White there is no explanation of the various postures since they are shot from two angles words generally are not needed.  The video includes:

1. The whole 32 postures in order
2. Each posture from the front
3. Each posture from the back
and my favorite
4: a dual frame of both the front and back simultaneously.

If you already know Taiji these postures will be relatively easy to pick up.  Still, a verbal explanation of each move would have been helpful.  Thus I only rate this 4 stars.  (I would have gone 4.5, were that possible.)",1347148800,3,610,4.541284403669724
