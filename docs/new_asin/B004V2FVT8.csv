8442692,4,B004V2FVT8,"This movie is a straight remake of southie techno whiz Mani Ratnam's potboiler 'Agni Nakshatram'.

The plot is unbelievably contrived - A CBI official has 2 wives. The 2 sons from the respective wives, a police officer and a petty vandal give each other the dirty eye whenever they're not involved in cavorting with their respective beaus, again produced with a convenience that mocks traditional Indian melodramas. Finally the two-timing daddy is attacked by a criminal type and the step-bruddas must align forces to bash up all the baddies and save their daddy.

The plot or lack thereof mainly provides an excuse for staging lots of elaborate songs and fights, done in a reasonably stylish way. For those that can understand Tamil, the original release is any day better.",1306281600,,774,4.992248062015504
