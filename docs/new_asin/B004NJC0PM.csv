8436687,4,B004NJC0PM,A very informative dvd on brain plasticity.,1525392000,,43,5.285714285714286
8436688,5,B004NJC0PM,"Some overlapping material in each episode which are done one year apart for four years, from '06-'10.  That is okay because it is a lot to absorb, watch one a day or week.

Each episode has special features which speak about specific issues and some newer underdeveloped technologies. Very informative and each special feature is unique information specifying in depth over the main theme of the episode.

Also get Brain Fitness for Children and
Younger Next Year: the new science of aging;)!
Both worth having.

A must have for people with TBI's (Traumatic Brain Injuries.)

Love it so much, thank you...",1431648000,,605,4.9504950495049505
8436689,5,B004NJC0PM,"Watched this on prime, liked it so much watched it with my mom, and then ordered the set for a friend.  It was very insightful and informative in instruction on how to stay sharp and mentally healthy throughout life.",1423440000,3,216,4.538461538461538
8436690,5,B004NJC0PM,"First of all, this set of four, one hour videos is also available in amazon instant videos.  If you are an amazon prime member all four are free to watch.  Besides watching them on various devices, you can just click on the ""Watch Now"" label and you can watch them on your PC.

As to the content, it is great;  however, there is a lot of talk, by scientists, to justify the theory as scientific and not just philosophical. Each one hour talk is organized like a lecture: an explanation of concepts, followed by scientific analysis, and then summed up by practical applications.  Not to surprisingly the last hour has the most practical applications on how to implement neural plasticity to make a positive difference in your life.

In case you feel pressed for time and want to wait until sometime in the future to learn about neural plasticity, you should be aware that the mind always  practices methods to change itself. So the options are not neural plasticity versus your mind not changing.  The real options from cradle to grave is either positive neural plasticity or negative neural plasticity. There is a line from the old Star Trek episode with Khan in it. Khan says something to the effect: small advances in technology make some difference but increase people's capabilities even a little  and you make an enormous difference in their lives and society.

And the best thing is you can do it yourself with no equipment needed.",1400112000,8,1437,4.734939759036145
8436691,5,B004NJC0PM,I really enjoyed watching the Brain Fitness video. I never knew our brain had this amazing capacity to absorbe what we see and how it works.,1362355200,2,140,4.423076923076923
8436692,4,B004NJC0PM,"This is a four episode DVD pack - volume 1 suggests a possible sequel - not sure if there is one. I have just finished watching parts 1 & 2 and thought someone else looking at this at Costco might benefit from this! Once I am done with all 4 parts I will update this with a more thoughtful review, if I can remember to do it!!

What this is NOT:
A series of instructions/ procedures to fix an ailment! Neither is this a substitute for Eric Kandel's neural science nor is it even close to being the the cliff notes version.

What this is:
A fascinating but very general discussion of the brain, its ability to adapt throughout our lives - for better or worse! The power of positive thinking and willing ourselves to get better. The importance of social interactions and the physiological relevance of doing this. The importance of even marginal cardiovascular activity to improve brain functioning. A few interesting case studies are discussed, again very generally, by neuroscientists of varying fame! Peter Coyote is the presenter of the series.

Technical Quality:
The DVDs (at least the first two) are not in HiDef - the visual quality leaves one wanting. The audio is also decidedly poor - the volume fluctuates. Michael Merzenich an eminent NAS member and neuroscientist has horrible diction, needs to avoid being used in any sort of educational video. The diction coupled with the poor audio recording and mixing makes listening to him, enlarges the primary auditory. This is very annoying and they should have and could have, easily, improved upon the audio. Despite the issues with the audio track it is still nineteen bucks well spent and something I would buy again. If you find the life sciences fascinating this is definitely worth watching - despite the dated production quality.",1337731200,12,1792,4.830618892508143
