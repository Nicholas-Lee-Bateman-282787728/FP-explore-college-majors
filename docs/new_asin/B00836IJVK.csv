Film = two (2) stars; restoration = 4.5 stars; cinematography = three (3) stars; subtitles = three (3) stars choreography = barely three (3) stars; frame painting / color filtering = two (2) stars; ""music"" = one (1) star.  Director Keisuke Kinoshita's feudal-period drama wherein farmers are given the choice of a slow death as the numbing life of a peasant or a quick one in battle.  Four generations (more or less) are shown to prefer the latter (both males and females).  That's the movie.  Kinoshita employs a boatload of technical tricks to disguise this threadbare, simplistic pacifist plot.  Most are not particularly successful.  Cinematography ( 2.35:1, black and white) is marred with frames of what look like hand-painted color swatches and objects (in static scenes) that resemble a five-year-old's coloring book.  (Very distracting.)  Some scenes are shot with color filters (seemingly at random) and an occasional set of freeze frames are tossed into the pot.  Script typically has characters providing expository text (by commenting on what they are seeing and the viewer is not) rather than exchanging lines of dialog.  Actors are rarely given a chance to reach out to and engage the audience, since the Director persists in using long shots to fill the wide-screen format.  Acting (when you can see it in medium shots and close-ups) is not particularly well done.  Talented actress Hideko Takamine is pretty much wasted even though she ages about 40 years during the film (her character has a limp which is about the only way the viewer can identify her in all those long shots!).  A solitary noh singer (usually filmed with a blue filter) is used as a Greek Chorus which adds not much to the proceedings.  ""Music"" mainly consists of a temple gong and small hand-held temple bell (no temples are shown in the film).  Sound of the latter seems ever present to the point that some viewers may be driven to turn off the audio!  The same battle scenes are reused, but given different battle names.  Battle deaths are poorly choreographed and far from convincing.  Sloppy editing shows ropes employed to keep tourist at bay in one interior set (used for a feudal lord's residence).  Subtitle flash rates are occasionally excessive.  An insomnia countermeasure!  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1498867200,,2441,5.101010101010101
