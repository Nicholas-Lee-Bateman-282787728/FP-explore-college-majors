7389273,5,B014E1TJRA,"For those who know mystery writer Agatha Christie only from her detective novels featuring Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot, this DVD set  containing two full stories  (each presented as three 55-minute chapters)  will be something different. There is a bit of humor at the beginning  the Beresfords (Tommy and his wife Tuppence) are always looking for a new way to make money  but then gets a lot darker (and more violent than most Christie mysteries. The novels were the first from Christie and were written in the 1920s. This adaptation brings the story up to 1952  after WWII and at the beginning of the Cold War.

Im not going to go into the plots here  after all these are mysteries and I don't like spoilers. There are longer reviews here that will give the plot (and, in some cases, IMHO  too much information).

The mini-series (just the two movie-length stories) was produced by the non-commercial BBC network and aired in the UK in 2015. The DVD does have English subtitles  though I had no problem with the accents.

For so short a series (total about five hours), the DVD contains a treasure trove of bunuses. There are four bonus features totally almost 2 hours! (One of them is the photo gallery and that is just two minutes). There is a 25-muinute Q&A with black American actor Clarke Peters (best known for the HBO series The Wire and Treme). It really concentrates, less on PIC than on his TV and stage work in the US. But its still interesting. The remaining two bonuses are about the period design and the making of the show.

This is  as I said  a different kind of Christie story. Its more about politics and szpys and espionage than a whodunit. But the quality is high and it will keep your attention.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7389274,5,B014E1TJRA,"David Walliams is fast becoming an icon in the United Kingdom.  Not only is he as actor and producer (in evidence here with this wonderful Agatha Christie offering) he's a successful children's author; a judge on the phenomenally successful BRITAIN'S GOT TALENT where he holds his own with/against Simon Cowell; a well-known comedian; a tireless fundraiser for charities (he actually SWAM the entire length of the Thames River--140 miles, during which he apparently saved a drowning dog!); and the list goes on.  How he found time to do these two three-part adaptations of Agatha Christie's Tommy & Tuppence Beresford novels is beyond me, but he did it and credibly, too.

While Walliams likely wouldn't be anyone's first choice as a romantic lead in a rich period piece like these adaptations, he pulls it off extremely well.  Of course it doesn't hurt that his co-star is the wonderful Jessica Raine, best-known in North America for her central role on CALL THE MIDWIFE (which she recently left, to pursue other opportunities).  Together, Walliams and Raine have excellent chemistry and are entirely believable as the typically English couple who find themselves involved in chasing criminals and saving the day, as the saying goes.

These fresh, new adaptations place the Beresfords in early 1952, just prior to the crowning of Queen Elizabeth II.  The period detail is lush and authentic, from the seediness of Soho (a run-down district in London) to a visit to the opera.

What this author found particularly appealing about these two mysteries (adapted from two of Christie's Tommy & Tuppence novels) is that they are suitable for family viewing.  Yes, there is some violence, including some fairly startling bloody bits, but what a relief from the onslaught of contemporary police procedurals that pour on the grittiness ad nauseum.  Such shows have their place and many are compelling to watch, but Christie mysteries are always entertaining in an old-fashioned way (in the best sense of that term).

Those who especially relish POIROT and MISS MARPLE will appreciate these lesser-known Christie heroes.  Nonetheless, one might approach these adaptations a Christie novice and still find immense enjoyment.

The English are masters of mysteries and their period pieces are exemplary.  Shows like FOYLE'S WAR and GEORGE GENTLY come to mind as arguably the best of the genre.  And while PARTNERS IN CRIME may not be at the very top of this list, they are still fun to watch.

Hopefully Walliams and Raine will re-team for more Tommy & Tuppence adventures!",1450915200,,2561,5.1201923076923075
7389275,5,B014E1TJRA,"A delightful reinterpretation of Agatha Christies Tommy & Tuppence sleuth duo. 2 character driven complex spy mysteries. Christies Tom&Tupp novels were spread over half a century (1922-1973). Earlier adaptations staged the stories in the twenties, the date of the first book release. This series opts for a median time era, 1950s, a fresh idea that works equally well. Costumes & sets are spot on [I know, I lived then]. Kudos to casting for acquiring Jessica Raine, the queen of the 50s era hit series beginnings of Call the Midwife to play the 1950s Tuppence. David Walliams plays Tommy and had a hand in the early days of this series conception. A dynamic screen chemistry. Tom&Tupp are a typical era couple in love with each other. Refreshing. PG rated family viewing caper series infiltrated with spies and humor.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 6 episodes; 2 adapted books each with 3 episodes. Subtitles for the bonus too.
The Secret Adversary
1===It is 1952 in a Paris train where Tommy and Tuppence (already wed with a school age son and a woody station wagon) learn a young lady they met has disappeared and a man shot. Tommys Uncle (James Fleet) of MI-5 or 3rd Floor gets them involved. But the pair begin searching for the lady, a recording and a Soviet man. Its a cold war were fighting now, Uncle points out. Old war buddy Albert (Matthew Steer) assists the duo. J Fleet and M Steer appear in all episodes for both stories.
2===Tommy mistaken as an accomplice of an assassination team while Tuppence is undercover as a typist/maid. They get in deeper and danger rises in their adventure. Clarke Peters plays the missing girls uncle.
3===Tommys cover is blown and he gets an ultimatum theft assignment with his sons life dependent on success. Tuppence helps him, then together set out to negate the Soviet plan. Conflicting intrigue to the endunless you read the book or watched the earlier adaptation.

N or M?
1===Tommy becomes Uncle/Maj Carters right hand man when an MI-5 mole is believed operating. Mission is locating a scientist, his bomb, and a Soviet spy named N or perhaps it was M. Tuppence will not allow her hubby to go solo. This storys stars playing some of the many spy suspects include Christina Cole, Roy Marsden, Robert Hands (House of Eliott), and Ed Speleers (Downton Abbey).
2===At the Sans Souci coastal guesthouse one suspect is eliminated by suspicious death. Tommy focuses on the suspect flirting with Tuppence. Tuppence focuses on the suspect flirting with Tommy. The edge of trouble. Many Agatha Christie red herrings.
3===Tommy gets captured alongside the missing scientist. Tuppence to the rescue, but can the reunited duo end the stolen bomb threat?
Tommy and Tuppence proves to be more FUN as a 1950s era story than the previously adapted 1920s era. The Christie humor comes through, even between the dark intrigue suspense moments.",1449878400,2,2868,4.899176954732511
7389276,4,B014E1TJRA,"I really enjoyed the first story. The acting is excellent and the post-war period settings are superb. However, in the second story there is just a touch too much incredulity in some of the plot, which did rather spoil the well-worn, ""look out he's got a bomb"" disaster scenario. It did remind me more of a ""Five go mad in Dorset"" type story, crossed with a game of Cluedo (Clue) using secret passages and unbelievably naive supporting characters.
Having said that, it was definitely worth watching for a few hours to relax.",1447804800,3,524,4.706521739130435
7389277,5,B014E1TJRA,"Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, in 1952, are middle class and still adjusting to the post-war years. Fortunately, Tommy's Uncle Carter is paying the school fees for their 8 year-old son, George. But, to put it bluntly, it looks like Tommy is going to have to get a job. Or better yet, how about a little business venture? Tommy's entrepreneurial  schemes are a bit of a running joke throughout this series.

I love the characterizations. Tommy and Tuppence (nickname for Prudence) have been married long enough that they know each other well, respect and love each other well, and don't take guff from each other, either. Tommy is cautious, Tuppence is impulsive. Tuppence is more likely to get them into trouble, but Tommy is willing when the game is afoot.  Espionage is the name of the game.

This duo is one of Agatha Christie's first creations. The novel ""The Secret Adversary"" (1922) was the first Tommy & Tuppence novel and Christie's 2nd book overall. I personally think Christie was not as good at spy stories as straight-up mysteries, but there is a lot to like in this series.  She is the master of plots, and here we get many twists and suspects.

The best part of this TV series is that there's 2 stories of 3 parts each. Each part is 50 minutes, so each story is 2  hours, or movie length. Lots of time explore characters and confuse the audience with red herrings. Tommy and Tuppence make it to London, but their base of operations is the (real) town of Cromer, on the coast of County Norfolk, NE of London. I give the 1st story 4 stars and 5 stars to the 2nd. That evens out to 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5.

""Partners in Crime"" first aired in July/August 2015. The Bluray/DVD set has 2 discs. You get 335 minutes of very good TV show, presented in 16:9 widescreen. Sound is 5.1 Dolby Digital, though Bonus Extras are in stereo only. Both the episodes and the Bonus Extras have English SDH subtitles available.

I liked the four Bonus Extras, which I've detailed below my episode synopses. They added to my enjoyment of the series itself and total another 117 minutes, which is quite the treat.

""The Secret Adversary"" (in 3 parts)
Tommy and Tuppence are in France, taking a train back to England. This wasn't a vacation  they were there to buy a prize queen bee. Tommy's big plan for supplementing their income is to become a beekeeper. A young woman joins their table and it's evident she's scared and nervous. Tommy shows off his bee and unbeknownst to our heroes, she sneaks a little package into its box.

And then she disappears. Well, we see she's chased off the train by a murderous man. She left a book on the table, and Tuppence notices, ""At least we know her name. Jane Finn."" This is fortuitous, because Tommy goes to visit his Uncle Carter, now in the secret service, to ask for a job. But Carter doesn't think Tommy is right for the dangerous work, and they have this funny exchange: ""Just about every endeavor you embark upon ends in disaster.... The war  most men at least made it as far as the barracks. My nephew gets off the train and is run over by a catering van.""
Tommy: ""It was going fast.""

So the secret service doesn't want Tommy. But they don't reckon with Tuppence. She is determined to plumb the mystery of Jane Finn, and it just so happens that the affairs of the Lady Finn intersect with Uncle Carter's affair.

""N or M?"" (in 3 parts)
Tommy and Tuppence visit London again. For fun, the opera. For work, Uncle Carter. Tommy is hoping for funding for his latest venture, Beresford's Barnets = wigs. Tommy tells his dear wife, ""I wish you'd get behind me on this, Tuppence. We're sitting on a gold mine.""
Tuppence: ""I am behind you.""
Tommy: ""Well, you sound bored to death...""
Tuppence: ""It's just - we've been stung before."" (And she can't help smiling.)
Tommy, indignantly: ""Disappearing bee disease is no laughing matter.""

But Uncle isn't interested in wig investments. He has a simple job for Tommy. Meet an undercover agent at their box at the opera, and bring back his message for Carter.  The problem is that the agent is poisoned before Tommy can get the message. Or was he? This is what I call a rollicking good tale. Nothing simple about it.

Trivia:  At one point, Tommy and Tuppence become separated in the London smog so thick that police use flares to see where they're going. This happened in real life. Wikipedia even has an entry for The Great Smog of 52, also called The Great Smoke. Have you heard of the 2004-5 BBC mystery series, ""Jericho""? The Great Smoke also features in one of its episodes:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jericho-of-Scotland-Yard--Set-2/dp/B000RPCJQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jericho of Scotland Yard  Set 2</a>

Bonus Extras:
A.  ""Time Out With Clarke Peters"" (25 minutes) Peters plays Julius Hersheimmer in ""The Secret Adversary"". He has a deep calm voice and this in-depth interview is very interesting. One thing he talks about is the difference between the theater and TV: ""What I found with the camera is that, what you think goes across your face, and that's what the camera finds.... So if you're thinking about your telephone bills, your telephone bills will be going across your face.""
B.  ""The Styling of 'Partners in Crime': Fashioning the 1950s"" (32 minutes) This is a great featurette. Commentators include Ed Hall (director), Aoife McMahon (plays Sheila Perenna), Amy Roberts (costume designer), Camilla Beeput (plays Jane Finn), Jessica Raine (plays Tuppence), David Walliams (plays Tommy), Konnie Daniel (hair & makeup designer) and Stevie Herbert (production designer). Herbert describes the period: ""It's not luxurious. There's still rationing.... Until 1954, people didn't have meat.... You research the reality of the period. And then, because it's a drama and because it's poetic license... we select which bits we want.""
C.  ""Partners in Crime: Behind the Scenes"" (58 minutes)  Also loads of interesting detail. Commentators include Hilary Strong (CEO Agatha Christie Ltd), Jessica Raine, David Walliams, Hilary Bevan Jones (producer), Mathew Prichard (grandson of Agatha Christie), Ed Hall, Camilla Beeput, George Taylor (plays Dominic Villiers), Sian Milne (stunt performer), Ed Spoloors (plays Carl Denim), Clarke Peters, Aoife McMahon, Christina Cole (plays Mrs. Sprot) and Danny Lee Wynter (plays Gilbert Worthing).
Bevan Jones says that when they were developing the idea, ""we decided to think of it as Indiana Jones Meets Agatha Christie.""
The series is set in the 1950s Cold War era. But, as Hilary Strong says, ""Christie wrote the [Tommy and Tuppence] books between the 1920s and the 1970s. And so, we could have placed it anywhere we wanted in that period.""
D.  ""Photo Gallery"" (2 minutes)

BBC has produced a ""Partners in Crime"" TV series before. Francesca Annis starred as Tuppence in 1983. It has 11 episodes of 50 minutes each. ""The Secret Adversary"" was also its 1st episode, but it was condensed into just one part. Overall, I thought this 1st series was forgettable  Francesca Annis can be great in some roles, but she just couldn't do young, intrepid and perky for me. But opinions differ.

Beresford spy advice: ""Be charming but anonymous. Friendly but forgettable.""

Happy Reader",1446768000,35,7413,5.003252032520325
7389278,2,B014E1TJRA,"In 2015, Agatha Christie's detective duo Tommy and Tuppence Beresford came to the BBC in two mysteries shown in three parts each for a total of six 55-minute episodes: ""The Secrete Adversary"", based on Christie's 1922 novel, and ""N or M?"", based on her 1941 novel. Action has been moved to the Cold War in the 2015 series, whereas the novels took place after WWI and during WWII. The Beresfords have been given a young son George (Miles Roughley) and a house with improbable round windows. Where these mysteries are supposed to be comic and lighthearted, this adaptation makes them ponderous and dark. Tommy (David Walliams) should be good-natured and practical, but he is a hen-pecked dullard. He appears either to be in mental or physical distress at all times. Tuppence (Jessica Raine) should be chatty and vivacious; instead she is nagging, domineering, and an insufferable busy-body. The couple don't seem to like each other or enjoy one another's company. They are among the most distasteful detectives I've seen onscreen. The 1983 ""Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime"" series that starred Francesca Annis and James Warwick was completely charming. If you want to see ""The Secret Adversary,"" see that one. The plots are silly, of course, but the way the characters interact with the silly situations is the entertainment. Not here.

The mysteries are:

Tommy and Tuppence Beresford are returning to England from Paris by train, in possession of a prized queen honey bee on whom Tommy's new business venture depends, in ""The Secret Adversary."" The Beresfords are seated opposite a young woman named Jane Finn (Camilla Beeput), who leaves the carriage at one point, forgetting her book on the table, and never returns. Back in England, Tuppence is keen to find out what happened to Jane Finn. She follows a lead from Jane's book to an underground betting parlor and barely escapes in one piece. So they try a more sensible course: They invite Tommy's uncle Maj. William Carter (James Fleet) over for dinner. Carter is an MI6 spook immersed in Cold War intrigue. Carter asks Tommy and Tuppence to work for him on the case of Jane Finn, apparently unaware of Tuppence's independent streak. A newspaper ad turns up a wealthy American man, Julius Hersheimmer (Clarke Peters), claiming to be Finn's uncle, and pretty soon Tommy and Tuppence are in deeper than Carter intended.

""N or M?"" That is the question. Britain's leading atomic physicist Gilbert Worthing (Danny Lee Wynter), who was working on a top secret bomb project, has gone missing and feared to be in the hands of the Soviets. Maj. Carter of MI5 asks Tommy and Tuppence to meet an agent named Harrison at the opera. Though a series of mistaken identities and misadventures, that doesn't work out. When the Beresford's finally find their man, he can only whisper: ""Tell Carter there's a spy in the house. They've taken Gilbert. It's"" He said ""N"". Or ""M"". The Beresford's aren't' sure. But Carter sends Tommy undercover as a birdwatcher to a seaside town. Feeling left out, Tuppence naturally follows, posing as a novelist. Their hotel is populated with an assortment of characters, one of which might be N. Or M: an Indian Major Khan (Alyy Khan), flirtatious divorcee Mrs. Sprot (Christina Cole), handsome young Carl Denim (Ed Speelers), psychologists Frederick (Robert Hands) and Elizabeth Minton (Issy Van Randwyck), and Cmd. Haydock (Roy Marsden), also a birdwatcher.",1506211200,,3432,5.028119507908611

Male, playing Tommy, had a wooden, bemused expression throughout, whether being threatened to be killed with a hammer or quietly at home with his family.  Perhaps the producers intended to save some money by using non-actor off the streets.  However, if he is an actor, this was a career ending role.  Probably equally at fault was the director, whose direction of one of the main characters, was reminiscent of Army training films I viewed years ago.

In fact it's one of the worst UK crime or suspense dramas I've ever seen.  These two bird brains, Tommy and Tuppence, are so bumbling and so utterly inept, they make the inquisitive young women of The Bletchley Circle look like a group of elite double agents, dual-trained by the KGB and CIA!  By the mid-point of the 2nd story, I was just hate watching it.  Waiting to see what stupid thing they would do next.  Seeing it as unintentionally hilarious was the only avenue left.  And David Williams, dear man though he may be, seems hopelessly miscast.  It would be an understatement to say he is wooden.  He is leaden.

As I mentioned in a comment, it was as if the director was completely stoned and loved to watch water boil, and decided to drag the audience along for the ride. Situations arose filled w/dead air where nothing happened and for a moment one could confuse the characters in the scene w/manikins. And decisions sometimes were agonizingly not appropriate to the situation, leaving this audience confused and shouting at the screen.
The male lead playing Tommy had one, and only one expression to cover the gamut of his character. He was in scenes w/other characters who were playing unsavory chaps who in real life would have seen Tommy for the rube he was, yet somehow they actually thought he was clever! More confusion, more shouting at the screen.
It was truly painful and agonizing to slog through the first story. And I don't recommend you attempt it. If it is available at your library, my advice is to check it out there.
Jessica Raine, who plays Tuppence, was the only bright spot in the effort, and near the end of the first story, even her character was becoming annoyed at Tommy's behavior (which was so nonsensical and cast Tommy as a moronic bumbling statue).",1479772800,3,1265,4.754545454545455

7389315,5,B014E1TJRA,"As a child, my first exposure Agatha Christies mysteries was the 1974 movie, Murder on the Orient Express.  The movie featured Albert Finney as the Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. In this particular Christie mystery, Poirot is asked  to investigate the murder of an American business tycoon aboard the Orient Express train. My ten year old self was captivated by the movies plot from start to finish. In fact, this particular movie turned me into a life long Agatha Christie fan.
Although, Hercule Poirot is my favorite Agatha Christie character, my second favorite characters are the husband and wife team, Tommy and Tuppence Beresford.
Tommy and Tuppence were first introduced to the public via Christies 1922 novel, The Secret Adversary.  The husband and wife detective duo also appear in four other Christie novels,  Partners in Crime, N or M?, By the Pricking of My Thumbs, and Postern of Fate.
In 2015, the BBC aired a six part series, Partners in Crime based on the Tommy and Tuppence series to celebrate the 125th anniversary of Agatha Christies birth.
The series is set during the Cold War era of the 1950s. Tommy, played by David Williams,  is clever entrepreneur, but lacks the Midas touch in his business ventures.  His wife, Tuppence, played by Jessica Raine, is an intelligent, perceptive woman, who loves to read mystery novels by Dorothy Sayers. Major Anthony Carter portrayed by James Fleet gives the couple their first opportunity to try their hand as detectives in order to solve the mysterious disappearance of Jane Finn. The Beresfords are assisted by Tommys former World War I comrade turned chemistry teacher and part time spy, Albert Pemberton portrayed by Matthew Steer.
The series episodes are based on Agatha Christies novels The Secret Adversary and N or M?",1475971200,,1788,5.04406779661017

7389326,2,B014E1TJRA,"I was initially inclined to give this series 3 stars because of good production values, interesting sets and locations and a reasonable attempt to recreate early 1950s Britain (although ""The Bletchley Circle"" was much better done in that regard (and I massively resent its premature demise)).  However, this series barely rates two stars for two reasons.

First, the stories are TERRIBLE.  The 1950s updating of the classic Tuppence and Tommy characters is nice, but the screenwriters have no clue about Cold War espionage.  I will admit a slight bias here as when I watched this series I had just finished watching the classic BBC TV miniseries of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" and ""Smiley's People"" for the umpteenth time (I love both of them - they are amazing).  The screenwriters for ""Partners in Crime"" have no clue about game theory, which Cold War spy activities brought to a new height.  Obviously the screenwriters for this series not only have no clue about John Le Carr in his classic years, they have never read Sun Tzu either.

The second problem with this series is that a basic requirement for being a detective is a reasonable level of intelligence.

What works: Sherlock Holmes (IQ 200) vs. Dr. Watson (IQ 120)  It works because Watson is Everyman, and is just enough smarter than most of us for us to buy into his almost always erroneous analyses.

What does not work: Tuppence Beresford (IQ 115) vs. Tommy Beresford (IQ 90), and I am being generous here - I was tempted to make Tommy's an 80.  Any person, especially a detective, cannot expect to simply blunder their way through a situation.  The Keystone Cops went out with the end of WWI but watching Tommy Beresford in this series makes you feel their presence.

The lack of intelligence of characters insults the audience, who expect intelligence from a detective.  Would you hire Forrest Gump?  After all, how is a detective supposed to solve difficult cases without the ability and experience to approach problems from odd angles, ""thinking outside the box"" so to speak.  A case in point is the failure of the James Garner detective medium ""Nichols' in the early 1970s (for those old enough to remember it) compared with the success of the James Garner detective medium ""The Rockford Files"".  Nichols is a dullard, and the audience rejected the character, where as Rockford was accepted because of his general level of intelligence and ability to think outside the box in tough situations.  Tommy Beresford in this series cannot think his way out of a paper bag.

If the producers expect to salvage this fiasco for any additional seasons, they need to fire the screenwriters and come up with a non-obvious way to increase the intelligence of both lead characters by at least 30 IQ points.  I actually hope they do, because the concept is very well conceived, but is undone by terrible execution.",1465344000,,2870,4.854209445585216
7389327,1,B014E1TJRA,What a disappointment! They turned Tommy into a bumbling fool and Tuppence into a willful busybody. The love and respect of them as a married couple has been totally destroyed. Get the videos starring Francesca Annis and James Warwick.,1464825600,4,235,5.051282051282051

7389330,1,B014E1TJRA,"I had the library get these so I could decide if I wanted to buy them myself. I won't bother now--these are nowhere near Agatha Christie's stories. I enjoyed reading the stories many times over, and the first series done in the 70's was passable, but these are so far off it's a totally different story! They just give a passing glance at the Christie works and then drive right on over them. The actress was fairly good, but the actor playing Tommy was so wrong it was painful. He played him like the typical bumbling male you see, with the female lead running rings around him until it comes to brute strength time. Really people, the original stories are very good, and the time period is not that far off for being portrayed. Why did they have to set the story in the 50's and then get the costuming wrong (women didn't go about in slacks in public very often) and the characters worse. The actors were good and that was it.",1464220800,4,928,4.369942196531792

7389335,5,B014E1TJRA,"Partners in Crime serves up a delicious treat for Agatha Christie's many followers. Forget Poirot and the often annoying Miss Marple. Tommy and Tuppence may be Dame Christie's most endearing sleuths, an everyday married couple whose collective sense of detection rivals that of the fabled Nick and Nora Charles (and their little dog Asta too). Acorn DVD brings mystery fans two absorbing episodes inspired by Christie novels, showing how Tommy (played by David Walliams) and Tuppence (Jessica Raine) Beresford seem to live an ordinary 1950s life in Britain. But this is the time of the Cold War, meaning spies and intrigue are never far from the surface. In ""The Secret Adversary, "" a brief exchange on the train in Paris results in a desperate hunt for a woman who's gone missing, plus the two seek details that could expose a hitman from the Soviet Union. ""N or M?"" places the couple in more immediate danger as they scurry to learn which guest at a seaside hotel has swiped a nuclear bomb.

Clever dialogue and fast-paced storytelling make ""Partners in Crime"" a must for mystery and suspense fans, whether you're familiar with these characters or not. These two showed up in several Christie stories and novels, some of which were adapted for TV in the 1980s and early 2000s. But Raine and Walliams bring sparkling new energy to their roles, making ""Partners in Crime"" a sleuthing duo for right now. Love the 'making of'' featurette as well as the superb spotlight on the series' costume design, which adds charming detail to this updated adaptation.

Having read and re-read the novels for years, and watched the earlier 1983 television adaptations with pleasure many times, I was anxious to see this new incarnation of beloved characters.  I liked that it was set in the 1950's rather than the novel setting of  post World War I.  I wondered if Jessica Raine would be ""Jenny"" her CALL THE MIDWIFE character, also a 1950's woman, but she is entirely different.  Excellent in both roles, her Tuppence is feisty and adventurous as a detective fiction fan who has the opportunity to investigate a real crime mystery.  Her companion in this is her husband Tommy (David Walliams) who is not so keen on sleuthing, but is dragged into it first by Tuppence's insistence, and then by events.  He is steady and normal, but there is something in his reactions that makes the viewer think perhaps since the War is so recently over, he knows more about grim reality than he ever divulges to his wife.  Neither character feels like a stereotype, and there is a freshness and interest to every episode.  Sadly there are only two novels adapted, and there are only six episodes.  For those who love correctness in historical representation, the wardrobe and the set dressings are perfect.  This is entertaining, fun, the mysteries are well played and the characters well cast.  It belongs in any Christie collection for the fun and insights of a new adaptation.",1458691200,,1495,4.865612648221344

Almost not believable. Its not the fault of David Walliams - he's good. His character becomes much more believable in the second story, ""N or M"", and that makes the set worth getting.

7389358,1,B014E1TJRA,"Two things can be said in this show's favor: The period detail -- cars, clothing, interior decoration etc. -- is well done, and Jessica Raine is quite convincing as Tuppence.

Everything else is a huge disappointment. The plots of both movies in this set are disasters; they are so implausible it makes one want to grab the TV and shake it real hard. Now granted, the original Tommy and Tuppence novels and stories are not examples of Christie's most ingenious plotting, but the writers for this series have actually managed to make it worse. At almost every turn the characters, whether major or minor, act in ways that are so obviously un- or ill-motivated that even the best-intentioned viewer will find it difficult to engage with the story.

What Christie's T&T novels and stories lacked in plots they made up for in characters. Her Tommy and Tuppence are a lovable if unlikely couple, and readers get to see them at various stages of their lives, from their early twenties or so through middle age to old age. Tuppence is feisty and clever; Tommy is courageous and physical, if need be (he is a WWI veteran). As mentioned above, Tuppence is captured reasonably well in the DVD series, but Tommy is depicted as a timid, clumsy moron who never saw action in the Great War because he managed to get run over by a catering truck. And don't even get me started on Carter, who has been turned into a fussy, senile nincompoop.

A final complaint: David Walliams, who plays Tommy, is so wooden in his acting one wonders whether he's Pinocchio's brother. He basically has one facial expression available that he uses to display a wide range of emotions: incomprehension, indecision and disapproval (not that his character calls for much more than that, see above).

Not because the actors aren't excellent in their roles and not because Tommy and Tuppence Beresford aren't two of my favorite Agatha Christie characters. No, I had to give ""Partners in Crime"" 4 stars because the writers have made them a little too - well, for lack of a better word - bumbling.
In these two episodes the storylines have been updated to the early 1950s when Soviet spies were running rampant throughout the UK. I have no problem with that - after all, updating a classic works wonderfully with ""Sherlock."" What doesn't work for me is the decision to make the Beresfords inept, shaky in their confidence, and almost completely lacking in common sense. To be sure they are not trained agents but they are not rash and certainly not stupid although there are times in these two episodes in which they come off as, well, rash, inept, lacking confidence and occasionally stupid.
Through a series of unlikely events - including the disappearance of a beautiful young woman on a train - the Beresfords get dragged into a spy thriller in the first episode. In the second Tommy is asked to do a little investigating because there's a mole in MI5 but is supposed to keep Tuppence away from the action. Of course that doesn't happen.
David Walliams and Jessica Raine have good chemistry when working together and the guest stars, especially Roy Marsden as a retired Naval officer, are very good in their respective roles.

The two books spanned a good deal of time, and Tommy and Tuppence changed a good deal from one book to the other.

7389370,1,B014E1TJRA,"I do not understand when screenwriters decide to alter the original story so much that it is unrecognizeable from the source material. In the novel by Agatha Christie the main characters have youth and excitement and great respect for each other. In this adaptation they are bickering, middle aged people bored with each other. In addition the plot twists make no sense, the way the mystery is solved makes no sense, and the characters are put into increasingly unrealistic scenarios. One of the most upsetting changes is the downgrading of the character of Jane Finn from an intelligent girl who uses her wits to survive a very dangerous situation to a completely helpless nobody who just sits in a locked room for the whole movie. I am so very disappointed with this version.  Watch the version with Francesca Anna as tuppence or read the original Agatha Christie ( or both) but do not waste your time or money with this version",1454112000,35,930,4.77639751552795
7389371,2,B014E1TJRA,"Agatha Christie characterized Tommy & Tuppence as amateur sleuths who's minor crime solving capabilities complement each other sufficiently to make the partnership quite effective. Unfortunately, in this incarnation, the couple seem quite incompetent, downright dumb in fact, more than simply amateurish. They seem to survive on dumb luck alone. Despite ample opportunity for humor, little, if any, can be found. The stories are fairly good, despite large deviations from the originals, while the sets and technical aspects of these films are very good. Disappointing, but possibly worthwhile for Christie fans.",1453680000,12,611,5.8
7389372,2,B014E1TJRA,"For an excellent Agatha Christie story, this remake film version was very disappointing.  The characters were muddled, missed the book version by miles, and underwhelming.  The script and directing were mediocre to say the least.  Having read and enjoyed the books, seen the previous film versions (several times), this remake is underwhelming.",1453680000,8,344,5.576923076923077
7389373,2,B014E1TJRA,"Disappointing. David Walliams is endearing and could grow into the role, but Jessica Raine is grating. I really don't like her rendition of Tuppence. Whoever adapted the books for this series is way off base. Sorry to say I really didn't like it at all.",1452988800,5,253,4.644444444444445

7389375,1,B014E1TJRA,My wife and I agree that this has to be one of our worst DVD purchases of all time.  We will not even give this away to anyone because it is so poorly done.  An absolute waste of time and money.  The 1983 version with James Warwick and Francesca Annis would be suggested as an alternative.,1451606400,11,289,4.125

I'm shocked that though it was filmed and produced in 2015, it does not have captions for the hard of hearing. Was a complete waste of money for me, a deaf viewer. I'd gladly purchase the dvd, but it doesn't appear to have captions either. So I'm writing this review as a warning to other deaf people who like historical/period dramas. Acorn needs to start adding captions before we can enjoy them.",1451520000,11,481,4.540229885057471
7389377,5,B014E1TJRA,"Agatha Christie's Partners In Crime. In this new light-hearted six-part BBC TV series of British mysteries, Agatha Christies charming crime-solvers Tommy and Prudence (Tuppence) Beresford appear to be an ordinary married  couple.  They  live in 1950s Britain, at the start of the Cold War, in the leafy suburbs of London, but feel in need of some adventure in their lives, as Tommy undertakes a variety of unsuccessful business opportunities while Tuppence tries to dissuade him. Suddenly,  the pair find themselves in the wrong place at the right time to solve a mystery, perhaps save someones life.

These new adaptations of two classic Christie novels see David Walliams (LITTLE BRITAIN, BRITAINS GOT TALENT), and Jessica Raine (CALL THE MIDWIFE) portray the pair whose quiet lives are upended by a chance encounter on a Paris train. In THE SECRET ADVERSARY, they search for a missing woman and a recording that could unmask a Soviet hit man who goes by the name of Brown. In N OR M?  they must discover which person, a guest at a seaside boarding house in Cromer, Norfolk, has stolen a nuclear bomb; is, or is working with, a Soviet mole at the couples organization, apparently MI5. Co-starring James Fleet (FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL) as Tommys enigmatic Uncle Major Carter, their entr&eacute;e into espionage.  Guest stars include Clarke Peters (THE WIRE), Alice Krige (THOR, THE DARK WORLD, TYRANT), Ed Speleers (DOWNTON ABBEY), and Roy Marsden (P.D. James mysteries).

Agatha Christie, of course, is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime: she is the most widely published author of all time, outsold by only the Bible and Shakespeare.  Her books have sold over a billion copies in English with another billion in foreign languages. In this current series, Walliams hits the right notes as Tommy, stolid but befuddled husband: best line, I am a man. Raine has the chops to carry a dated nickname, referring to an earlier unit of money that may be opaque to some viewers.  She also sports red lipstick, makes a 1950s character called Tuppence both strong and independent minded.  Each espionage adventure offers a certain amount of bumbling, as the inexperienced-in-the-spy-world couple mixes marriage and mystery with  playful banter, humor, lush period atmosphere and chic period fashion.  The series has been syndicated directly to American PBS stations which will begin airing it in March 2016.  The box set, which I received as a review copy, consists of six episodes on two disks, totaling approximately 355 minutes.  It includes two behind the scenes featurettes about the making of the show and the costume design (89 minutes), an interview with Clarke Peters (25 minutes) and a photo gallery. Plus, thank goodness, subtitles, for whod want to miss the sparkling dialog that keeps the production chuckling along?",1451347200,10,2838,5.0993520518358535

8730430,4,B014E1TJRA,I liked this series. As a fan of the books definitely noticed some glaring differences in characters/stories but it didn't subtract from the entertainment of the program.

8730436,3,B014E1TJRA,"The dvd is in excellent condition. The production quality of the film, sets, and costuming is beautiful. However, Tommy is a whiny, stupid wimp and Tuppence is a shrew much of the time. Disappointed at the change in the character of the couple. What made this such an enjoyable, comforting book series is missing in this adaptation. The couple have little respect for each other and aren't nearly as clever as Christie depicted them.",1516320000,,433,4.864864864864865
