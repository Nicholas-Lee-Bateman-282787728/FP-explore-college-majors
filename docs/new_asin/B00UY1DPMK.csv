7071917,5,B00UY1DPMK,This is a really fun movie with a great cast of characters! Brings back memories of older summer camp slasher films but with just the right amount of comedy sprinkled in. I'm really looking forward to the sequel!,1482278400,5,212,4.605263157894737
7071918,5,B00UY1DPMK,"I picked up the graphic novel of Bee Sting from the author at a convention and upon finishing the book, all I could think is how much of a fun film it would be, how it should have been a film, what a great throwback it was to too-much-fun, splattery camp slashers of the '80s. I think the film was in post production when I saw the Facebook page and realized that indeed my wish had come true. It was a great thing to finally pick up the DVD (again I got it from the author, Matthew Smith) and sit down and watch it. It's everything you could hope for in its abundance of obnoxious camp counselors, with the nice guy and jackass party guy combo which never fails, psychotic, cannibalistic rednecks and shenanigans all thrown together deep in the woods where all manner of bloody mayhem ensues. The acting and production are definitely proper for a B film but for an independent film I was pretty impressed with the lengths the creators went to to make this happen. The actor portraying Harvey made the character utterly hilarious. His lines are so odd and over-the-top, watching him exuberantly bumble about was great. The illustrator, Jeremy Massie, of the original graphic novel makes a hilarious and black-humored appearance as a psychotic cannibal who shares a deranged and breathy speech about a particular culinary penchant. Both the film and the book are well worth your time if you want a new addition to the camp slasher flick that made growing up in the '80s so awesome. Keep in mind this is an indie film and if you can dig that you'll dig the film and maybe you can see why I enjoy a film like this far more than another generic big budget affair. I'd like to add that it left me wanting more, to explore more camper/counselor shenanigans and more cannibal horror. Understanding what an undertaking it is to make a film independently I know it's a lot to ask but it further evidences the enjoyment derived from a film when you're left hoping a sequel happens.",1434499200,6,1971,4.53932584269663

Amazing movie put together on a shoestring budget, like all B-Movies should be!
Over the top, cheesy acting and old school FX.
Garnered enough praise to produce a sequel Bee Sting 2: Bear Sting!!",1531612800,,272,4.808510638297872

8708738,5,B00UY1DPMK,"""Bee Sting"", and it's sequel ""Bee Sting 2: Bear Sting"", are based on the graphic novels by Matthew D, Smith and Jeremy Massie.  The first movie is roughly 45 minutes long, but ""Bear Sting"" runs a little over an hour.  Both movies are cheesy and campy--but they are supposed to be--and they are exactly what you want out of a cheesy, campy horror-comedy.

In ""Bee Sting"" four teenage Camp August counselors find themselves fighting off cannibal rednecks when they decide to take a fellow counselor to the hospital when she is stung by a bee.

""Bear Sting"" starts off hours after the first movie ends, which is something I love in movies.  John Carpenter's Halloween and Halloween 2 movies also does this.  Then, the timeline skips ahead to a year later when the new wave of teenagers decide to get a little payback for Camp Augustus.

There are several things I love about these movies, but one of them is the epic one-liners that I know I will be quoting for a long time.
In the first movie, when the counselor is stung by a bee the camp director says bee glad it was a bee sting and not a bear sting.  Inane.  Idiotic.  Nonsense.  Sure, but it sets the movie up for a sequel and in the 2nd movie we find out what a Bear Sting isand you won't be disappointed.  The 1st movie also ends with an epic one-liner that I will not divulge ehre, but I know I will use anytime someone asks me what happened.
Bear Sting definitely outdoes its sequel with adding cheese, more epic lines, and fourth wall breaking.  My favorite fourth wall break is when Harvey gives his motivational speech and acknowledges a horror movie rule:  if you haven't heard your name or I haven't said your name you will die.
So, for a good time hit up Amazon Prime and watch Bee Sting and the sequel Bear Sting.  Bee prepared (see what I did there?) to be amused, to laugh, and to maybe even shed a tear if a beloved character becomes a rednecks lunch.",1523404800,,1918,4.393767705382436
8708739,1,B00UY1DPMK,"Don't bother.

For an independent film, they spend effort on special effects - which were better than most productions.  Quick advice though, even though it took a bunch of effort, don't slow down the motion of the CGI--make sure it plays a full (i.e. realistic) speed.

That was the good.  Otherwise, they need to work on acting, editing, writing, camerawork, etc. etc.",1519776000,,370,4.919354838709677
