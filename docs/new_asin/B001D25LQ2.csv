8291025,4,B001D25LQ2,The last season of GA  is really great just like all the other GA seasons and has a unexpected ending. If you like the show and don't mind subtitles (since this season wasn't fully dubbed) you should have no problem with this season.,1408752000,,233,4.4186046511627906
8291026,5,B001D25LQ2,"I have been looking for this collection for some time. Everywhere I looked, the price was far beyond what I could afford or I simply couldn't find it. The package was shipped in fairly good condition. This might be nitpicking, but a piece of the plastic jewel case along the bottom was cracked. But as cracks go, I've seen far worse and was able to repair it on my own.

Beyond that, all three discs were full of fun episodes. I only wish there had been a English dub on discs 2 and 3. While I've found Galaxy Angel is mostly slapstick and silliness; every now and then the creators do a serious episode that really holds your attention.

I especially want to complement each and every person involved in the shipping of this collection. I had moved in 2012 and my address on file was my old house. I contacted Amazon and let them know. I figured on having to reorder, so what a surprise it was to find this package in my mailbox. I will definitely remember the efforts of Amazon to assist me.",1372636800,,993,4.333333333333333
8291027,3,B001D25LQ2,"Well this is not a bad series if you been sticking around for this long with it like I have.  It contains the final 13 episodes, I think the series has a weird way of numbering episodes like it having one normal episode and two mini episodes of the series. The only problem that I had was that my friend is not a sub fan and prefers the dub of most anime series and that was fine for the first disk but the rest is not dubbed over so he could not enjoy it as much.  I say by this as part of your collection if you have keeping up with this series but if you are new get the first one and see if you like it.  Well this is everything that i have to say about it.",1354406400,,661,3.741007194244604
8291028,5,B001D25LQ2,This collection is viewed with ambivalence simply because the second and third discs were in japanese audio with english subtitles. Anyone who has watched anything with subtitles knows that a lot is lost in the translation and lets face it as a culture we are way to lazy and spoiled to want to read during our relaxation time (That is unless we want to finish that awesome novel). Anyway that being said after I got past the fact that I had to read a bit to enjoy most of this collection it turned out to be a pretty good buy after all. It had all the silliness and madcap antics that we know and love the girls for. The animation is still top of the line and other than a bit of reading I have to say before I had finished watching this collection I was ready to view it again. Good job guys now I'm on to Galaxy Angel Z,1268870400,,822,4.111801242236025
8291029,5,B001D25LQ2,"Okay, First let me say that Galaxy Angel X is a great addition to the series.  I loved every minute of it.  This series introduces a new angel that goes by the name of Chitose.  She's a cute, somewhat selfish individual who always seems to get sick when something doesn't go her way.  She's actually quite difficult to describe unless you actually see her in action.
Secondly, only disc one of the three discs is in english.  Discs two and three are japanese only with english sub-titles.  If you don't mind your anime in their true japanese dialog then Galaxy Angel X will be a welcome addition to your collection.",1229299200,10,615,4.545454545454546
8291030,3,B001D25LQ2,"Galaxy Angel X is not quite as good as the earlier series, getting more chaotic and having even less to do with the series theme (military girls) then ever.  Some of the stories are borderline unintelligible. But what is truly annoying is that after three sets (Galaxy Angel, GA A, and GA Z) this set only has the same actresses in English for the first third of the series.  Suddenly for the other two disks there is only English subtitles.  After you have gotten used to the English actresses, it is hard to tell which one is speaking at times since the Japanese voices often sound too similar to easily tell apart, and are often so radically different from the sound, speech pattern and vocal personality of  the English speakers.",1226966400,6,733,4.615384615384615
8291031,3,B001D25LQ2,"Only the first DVD of 3 has English voices.  What a pity - the show is so ridiculous and the actors and actresses generally so good I love listening to it when busy.  Ranpha's voice actress has been changed out as well for the first disc.

This series is so sick.  It's quite good for an anime comedy.  Twisted.  The animation could be better, but the fun of the characters and stories beats most all other anime series.  It's one of those few series that realizes it is a big joke and just has fun with all the crazy scenarios using loser-girls as the focus of female personalities and vice.

Angel X might be a weaker series than the others, but not much.  I definitely see why GA was a success in Japan.  Pity about this DVD set being incomplete.",1225843200,,749,4.285714285714286
8291032,2,B001D25LQ2,"Was glad to finally get the last series of the great Galaxy Angel anime in one box set. Unlike Galaxy Angel A which was first split up into a box set, then as AA for the second half, all of ""X"" is in a single 3-disc set. However, for some reason, only the first 8 episodes are actually dubbed. Each ""episode"" of Galaxy Angel X is 1 long episode with 2 mini-sodes which count as 2 seperate episodes. This makes for 4 on the first 2 discs & 5 on the last one. The first disc has both English & Japanese tracks, featuring most of the original voice actors from the previous GA dubs except for a new actress playing Rampha. The other two are in Japanese only, with no dub. I don't know why it was put out like this, or why they only bothered to do it with only 1/3 of it dubbed, but it seems profoundly lazy, like it was taken up by Bandai Visual for the last 2/3 of the show. There's no explanation given other than Bandai maybe just ran out of money for it.",1223596800,6,955,4.031578947368421
