8703695,5,B00U0NJLG6,"The cover shows Judy Loe and I was hoping that the DVD contained the original series, but sadly no; those video tapes were wiped by Thames TV in the 1970's/1980's. However, the second/third series is there and it's a hoot to see them again. Michael Mackenzie is great as the magician Tarot and his sidekicks are suitably friendly. The acting is not as hokey as I remember.",1433980800,,372,4.567164179104478
