2799430,4,B000OT6V14,"FURY AT FURNACE CREEK is a quality Western, with all sorts of engrossing plot twists, and fine, sharp B&W photography. Victor Mature, an actor I've not always warmed to, turns in a solid performance, seeking justice for his defamed father. Like other 20th C./Fox products of the period, production values are high, and the result is an enjoyable oater that any old cowpoke-lover will like. Recommended.",1199059200,3,402,5.106060606060606
2799431,4,B000OT6V14,"I had never heard of this Western before and bought it simply because I liked the idea of the story and because I like any type of movie from the late 40's. It was a  little gem of a film with great production values
and an aimiable leading man in the shape of Victor Mature. It was nicely photographed in desert locations and the almost silent shoot-out at the end was excellent. Being a long time Western fan I have no hesitation in recommending this as a good example of the genre and it will certainly reward not omly one but repeated viewing,seeing different things to enjoy each time, particularly Mature and Albert Dekker.",1185667200,22,629,4.517543859649122
2799432,3,B000OT6V14,"Average, fairly low budget western.  Trite story line.  Saved by a young and dynamic Victor Mature.  Easy to see why he went on to bigger things.  Good for the western movie buff.",1182816000,8,179,4.5
2799433,4,B000OT6V14,"Not a bad western for the late 40's.  Mature made this around the same time as ""My Darling"", which, obvioulsy is much better than this.  Still Mature does well with westerns.  The brother/brother conflict plays up well, but, kinda ends with a thud.  That could have been tied up better.  Considering the ""age"" of the movie, the quality was very nice.  I

bought it and don't regret it, as I will watch it again.  Some may prefer to just rent it.",1181260800,19,445,4.407407407407407

8186562,5,B000OT6V14,"Wow what a western I didn't know about. It is full of action but has some John Ford mood. I read about it and found out it actually is a remake of a John Ford non western, Four sons and a prayer. Had to have that one too but was disapointed there is not much Ford in it. But back to Fury at Furnace Creek. Great story, you are much entertained, great landscapes and Vitor Mature is in top form. You can see he really enjoys playnig his part!",1437091200,2,441,3.966292134831461

8186565,5,B000OT6V14,"Captivating movie with an excellent plot. This is the third western in my collection in which Mature gives a great performance.  This movie should be in any serious western collection.  Younger generation might overlook this as it is B&W, but it is a movie that i will defintely watch again & again.",1394064000,,299,4.730769230769231
8186566,3,B000OT6V14,"""Fury at Furnace Creek"" is a B western theme on an A-budget from 20th Century-Fox in the 1950s. Though in black & white, the production value on screen is in light and shadow, rugged western scenery, shot composition and well-directed acting. The plot is about betrayal allowing Indians, led by Jay Silverheels in a pre-Tonto TV role, to wipe out a frontier fort, the staining of a career officer's reputation and the scism between sons of the officer. Victor Mature is the older son, the black sheep of the family but a good-bad man who puts his life on the line to prove his estranged father was innocent. Glen Langen is the younger sibling - a stiff-necked ex-Army officer after the same goal but ill-equipped in experience like his brother to pull it off. Albert Dekker, one of the better character actors back in the day, is the bad guy. Coleen Gray is the romantic interest who's father was one of the soldiers killed at the fort. Censorship in movies back then prevented any of the blood and gore that became prevelant a mere decade later, so death and destruction is mainly off-screen so the running time is long on dialogue.",1349049600,,1133,4.641791044776119
8186567,4,B000OT6V14,"FURY AT FURNACE CREEK (1948) is a very entertaining black-and-white western with plenty of action.

Directed by Bruce Humberstone, it stars Victor Mature as a gambler and wayward son of an Army general (Robert Warwick) who has been accused of criminal behavior that led to an Indian massacre at a military fort.

After the general dies of a stroke during his court-martial, Mature, using an assumed name, travels to the nefarious town of Furnace Creek in an effort to prove his father's innocence and clear his name.  He goes to work for the town boss (Albert Dekker), who he believes to be responsible for the massacre.

Problems occur with Mature's estranged brother (Glenn Langan) shows up and the two men find they are working a cross purposes.

Coleen Gray, Reginald Gardiner, Fred Clark and Jay Silverheels co-star in this minor gem.

8186568,5,B000OT6V14,"I have seen just about every western that has ever been made, but I had never had the pleasure of viewing ""Fury at Furnace Creek"". Victor Mature has always been one of my favorite actors and he really delivers in this outing. If you enjoy a bit of mystery set in a truly enjoyable oater, you won't be disappointed in this gem of a B western.",1233273600,6,341,4.181818181818182
