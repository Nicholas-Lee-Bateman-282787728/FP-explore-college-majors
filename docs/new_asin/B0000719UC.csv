7973850,5,B0000719UC,My daughter is so open to trying fruits & veggy's bc of this video.  She learned all their names & LOVES going into the fruit & veggys section when we go grocery shopping.  I feel like I've already instilled a good foundation in eating & she's not even 3 yet! Super cute for 3 years and younger =),1306800000,,297,4.103448275862069
7973851,1,B0000719UC,"This DVD was a total disappointment. First of all, this video was a rip off of Baby Genius series, but without the production value. Second, this video promises to introduce your child to fruits and vegetables and healthy eating habits. To be fair, there are fruits and vegetables, but not so cleverly disguised in this video you will find dead and burned animals (grilled turkeys etc.) and rotten milk (in other term cheese), chicken period (eggs), ice cream ( I think it's a child abuse to feed your 6 month old ice cream!) and other non-fruit and non-vegetable foods. This video shows a toddler chewing on a hunk of parmasan cheese that's bigger than baby's head! I believe it is morally right to properly advertise your product and not misrepresent what your product has to offer, especially when it comes to offering children first look at health and nutrition. I would NOT recommend this video for vegetarians, vegans, or other parents looking to teach their children proper health and eating habits.",1116806400,2,1006,4.888888888888889
