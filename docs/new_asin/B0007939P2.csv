8045946,5,B0007939P2,I considered this rating because of the joy my grandson experienced with this dvd.  He told me that this dvd was awesome!!!!,1396656000,,124,4.636363636363637
8045947,4,B0007939P2,"I originally bought this for my 1 1/2 year old son because he really enjoyed the monster trucks he saw on tv, but when we tried to take him to see them live, they were too loud for him.  (Yes, we are first time parents... and not very good!)  Anyway, for this purpose it was perfect.  There are a ton of different trucks in both the racing and the freestyle ""smash everything in sight"" competition.  The announcers are annoying, but the trucks are very cool.  I found myself getting as excited as my son at some of the crazy stuff they do (For example: Grave Digger drives through a RV, and has an amazing crash somehow landing on all fours again).  Maybe for the hardcore fan, it would be stupid, but for what I paid, it was a great value.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I was really hoping for some cool special features, and there were none.",1170720000,3,864,4.2317073170731705
8045948,1,B0007939P2,"I also received a copy that had WF2 Racing and WF3 Freestyle.  Requested replacement and had the same problem.  Called Warner Bros. and they didn't understand, but sent me a DHL slip to send it back to them so they can send me another one.  I think I'll just return both of these to Amazon and let them figure it out.  Very disappointing, as my son was going to have some friends over to watch World Finals II.  He already has World Finals III on DVD.  Hey, Amazon, you need to tell Warner Bros to stop production until they fix the master copy!!",1140480000,,546,4.252427184466019

this looks like it was a cut and paste job.",1137715200,,105,4.0
8045950,2,B0007939P2,"The DVD has World Finals 3 Freestyle, not World Finals 2 Freestyle. Improperly manufactured!",1114300800,,92,5.642857142857143
8045951,1,B0007939P2,You said it reviewer #1 - this is freestyle 3 not 2 and I called Warner Video and they basically said return it where you bought it???? It is an error in production - HELLO very disappointing as my son waited for this release date and he already has the freestyle 3 - DONT BUY UNLESS YOU DON'T HAVE FREESTYLE 3!!!!!,1113350400,,315,4.180327868852459
8045952,3,B0007939P2,"*Monster Jam World Finals II: Racing and Freestyle*

It should read..

Monster Jam World Finals II: Racing

Monster Jam World Finals 3: Freestyle

===

The racing on this dvd is from the World Finals 2 (as it says), BUT the Freestyle on this dvd is from the World Finals 3. Looks like someone messed up when they made this DVD.",1112832000,,327,4.383333333333334
