8742163,1,B018ELUDNK,"That description is completely misleading. Saw the film a while ago at Seattle Crypticon. I don't think any of the people on the cover are even in the film. Not worth the $15. The only selling point they have is the actress from the exorcist,  and she's in it like a minute. One star because I can't take away stars.",1457049600,2,316,4.266666666666667
