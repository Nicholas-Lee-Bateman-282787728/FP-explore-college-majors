5567022,1,B00BAXTY9O,For the first time I may not buy the next available season of Gunsmoke ( Season 8)that will be released on May 7th. What is the justification for increasing the price? I have enjoyed buying the previous seasons but I will not continue buying at the present prices.,1364515200,21,264,4.520833333333333
5567023,1,B00BAXTY9O,"First of all, I am sure that noone appreciates the fact that these are being split up into half-season sets! The studios are milking the fans for money that they really don't have. If you want my advice, write to paramount, and tell them if they don't lower their prices, and release full seasons, that you will NOT Purchase them! What a complete Rip-off! Law & Order ran for 20 years also, and you can get the Entire series of that for 400 bucks. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS UNTIL THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES!

5567025,5,B00BAXTY9O,"This is a revised review.  I am generally happy with all of the ""Gunsmoke"" and ""Have Gun, Will Travel"" DVDs.  This is due to the high quality of the audio and video and to the fact that both were among a handful of the very best TV westerns ever produced.  However, I have been having chronic problems playing these discs on my Panasonic DVD Recorder, which functions both as a DVD player and recorder.  Almost every set has at least one disc that will not even start and is rejected by the machine as ""incompatible.""  Sometimes I am able to get them to play by repeatedly opening and closing the disc drawer.  I do not have this problem with any other discs that I've purchased or burned myself.  Oddly, the discs play perfectly on my older, standard DVD player.

I wondered if anyone else has experienced this problem with the CBS programs DVDs.",1360886400,33,847,4.490196078431373

5567097,5,B00BAXTY9O,"Gunsmoke provides western-lovers with a family-friendly great show that emphasizes character, law & order, and good plain common sense. This half-season, as well as all previous episodes, provide a breath of fresh air in an age when many of the most entertaining movies have drifted from such character-building values. It is amazing to me that the writers were successful in making the plot and storyline consistently excellent and among the best of the classic Westerns from season to season for so many consecutive seasons. I cannot think of one episode to date that felt weak or that let me down.

Definitely a great addition for the video library of anyone who likes the Western genre, or who likes solid character and good role models in the primary characters, and a strengthening of the ideas of justice, fair play, the rule of law, and even compassion and wisdom throughout.",1471564800,,883,4.966216216216216

5567227,5,B00BAXTY9O,"For Western buffs like myself, Gunsmoke has to be the best. The greatest characters.  Marshal Matt Dillon, who stands  alone as the undefeated gun law in the whole of Kansas, let alone Dodge City. The attractive red head Miss Kitty, who would relinquish the sparklers from her earrings for Matt to whisper sweet nothings. Lovable Doc Adams, the patcher-up of bullet wounds. Comedic Festus  Hagen (I love this guy) whose jangling spurs can be heard for miles. Each story is a magical trip into the world of old silver mines, loose limbed gunslingers, and feisty women who help to work their land  equally as well as their menfolk. Masked  outlaws holding up stage coaches, who turn out to be the sons of respected citizens. Sad stories. Funny stories. But all wellwritten, impeccably acted stories. There's nothing to compare with the magic of the Old West. And nothing compares to the great collection of stories that is 'Gunsmoke.'",1430352000,,932,4.910828025477707

Some of my fondest memories are of those times with my dad, eating popcorn that had been popped in a big cast-iron skillet on the stove.  So, it was great to be able to buy the first eight seasons in a multi-pack set.  Clearly, technology has improved since the series began filming.

5567256,5,B00BAXTY9O,"Season eight and the second year of one hour episodes.  Nineteen marvellous episodes and it should be noted that while most westerns  very much depicted the man's vision of the west, ""Gunsmoke"" was one the few which presented strong female roles with actresses scoring top billing in half of the shows in this collection.
Old reliables John Meston and Kathleen Hite wrote fourteen of the episodes and Harry Harris Jr. and Andrew V. McLaglen  directed seventeen between them giving the series a continuing high standard which was to remain throughout its entire longevity.
The role of Quint Asper, played by Burt Reynolds, joined the cast in episode three to bolster the already strong ensemble of James Arness, Dennis Weaver, Amanda Blake and Milburn Stone.  Another interesting character also appeared: it was the first entrance of Festus Haggen played by Ken Curtis.  The latter, one of the Sons of the Pioneers and a regular in John Ford movies, had appeared in quite a number of previous episodes but never as Festus. As we all know Festus would be a permanent staple in years to come and fill the gap of quirkiness when Weaver's Chester departed the series.
A great bunch of guests appeared in this selection of shows including  Kathy Nolan, Virginia Gregg, John Dehner, Joanne Linville, Robert Middleton, Ruta Lee, Strother Martin, Chill Wills, Claude Akins, William Windom, Audrey Dalton, Joyce Bulifant, J. Pat O'Malley, Denver Pyle, Sherry Jackson and Mariette Hartley.
One highlight episode: ""Root Down"" where Chester is kidnapped, bound and gagged and destined to be a reluctant bridegroom!

Ive been waiting for a good sale on Gunsmoke and here it is. I liked the earlier Gunsmoke with Dennis Weaver as Chester. I didn't know that he was in the  first 9 and a half seasons. Most of the Gunsmoke episodes on tv are the colorized ones. I think the better episodes were in black and white, and these are rarely shown except on the western channel. As other reviewers have stated that the original prices on these are outrageous but when you get a sale like this. You get 15 sets, 56 disc, 2 sets for each season 2 thru 8 and 1 set for season 1 when the shows were 30 minutes each before changing to the 1 hr format with season 2. At $149.99 that equals $ 10 dollars a set. I went ahead and ordered season 9 volume 1 and 2 so id have all episodes with  Dennis Weaver. I believe hes not in any of the volume 2 of the 9th season.",1386460800,16,941,4.092391304347826
5567286,4,B00BAXTY9O,"I only rate this on price alone. I have yet to purchase it, and may not. I have way too many box sets now, plus all the individuals, to watch em all. My 2 kids will have plenty to watch.
Considering $150 for 8 seasons, boils down to $18.75 a season or 49 cents an episode. Have Gun Will Travel is $16.66 a season or 44 cents an episode.
A far cry from today's $30 to $40 a season with 22 episodes each and a 21 minute run time.  I bought Wanted Dead or Alive several years ago in individual seasons by Canal, and have yet to watch em all. Same with Laredo, Guns of Will Sonnett, The Texan, 1st 4 seasons of Rawhide, and several others with the cellophane unbroken. I sure hope they play when I get to them, if I get to them. I just loved all those old westerns. But I like em uncut and in the 25 minute runtime. Gunsmoke was in the 52 minute area.
  And food for thought for those scratched discs. A fine modern day auto polish like
Race Glaze (which I use) and a soft cotton cloth folded into a small ball,  with a little of the polish and rubbed briskly back and forth, (not in a circular motion,) much like polishing a scratch out of your cars finish, and topped with the same motion with a clean cloth will allow most scratches to disappear and allow the disc to play.
The same can be used for CD's.",1386460800,12,1303,4.058365758754864

Arness should know a little about this as he was wounded in the invasion of Salerno in Italy.  We especially enjoy the early films with Dennis Weaver and his limp.  Most fans wanted Matt and Miss Kitty to marry but that was not to be.  Ken Curtis was alright as Festus but the show was not the same.
When Arness passed away there was almost a national wake by those who grew up with those characters.",1374192000,16,575,4.287037037037037

5567298,1,B00BAXTY9O,"I have several issues with the latter GUNSMOKE SEASON dvd collections, two issues in particular.
Number one is the increase in price for these seasons.  STUDIO GREED is the reason here, pure and simple.
  My second gripe concerns the number of repeat episodes included.  'Quint Asper Comes Home' is listed, yet again,
on the eighth season, volume one.
  Yes, GUNSMOKE, has become the gold standard among mega-successful TV westerns, no question about it.
  However, this fact does NOT warrant repeat episodes or exorbitant prices.
  Consumers are NOT paying for either of these.
  I haven't purchased The Eighth Season, and not planning to until these negative issues are addressed and remedied.
