7908188,4,B00000FDY1,"If you are a fan of Paula Poundstone, especially her way of audience interaction, I would recomend this tape.  I personally think that she is hilarious, and one of my favorite things is to listen to her talk to the audience.  This tape has plenty of Paula Poundstone talking to normal people, and her own great style of humor.
I wish the show would have survived.  I think had there been celebrity guests, instead of common people, it would have been better received.  I could have done without the musical guests, but overall I think this is a highly enjoyable tape.",1025913600,3,567,4.584158415841584
7908189,3,B00000FDY1,"The video was a lot longer than i expected. It says only an hour but the tape I got was an hour and a half. Even though it says it has 2 episodes, they either make it seem, or there are actually 5 small episodes w/credits  to separate them. What I like most about the video is her interaction with  different people -- guests and the audience. Sure there wasn't too much  stand-up, but she still cracked me up with her spontaneous reactions to her  many guests and audience members. Hey, it didn't cost much, how can you  really go wrong?",962323200,9,538,4.287128712871287
7908190,1,B00000FDY1,I purchased this tape anticipating more of Paula Poundstones great stand up material and was disappointed. This is a tape of two shows with a brief monologe at the beginning followed by alot of lame  guests and skits. Not  worth the money even though it was cheap. Wait for her stand-up routines on  TV if you are a true fan.,931910400,35,325,4.383333333333334
