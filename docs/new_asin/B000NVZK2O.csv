8182148,5,B000NVZK2O,This is a great documentary. Craft beer is an ever-evolving thing. It's nice to see a trip made by good friends across the country to meet the brewers of good beer. I really like the interviews. Even the Yuengling interviews were phenomenal.,1402963200,,241,4.761904761904762
8182149,4,B000NVZK2O,"This flick was, first of all (and most importantly) a fun look at what looked like a fun trip.  Some of the interviews with various brewers were insightful and fascinating, while others (due to inevitable time constraints) were one-off blurbs or barely-mentioned.  I can only assume that the tour of the Abita Brewery that serves as the end-cap of their trip was a boring day (being from Louisiana, I was really looking forward to that one) since it got pretty much no coverage at all, including in the additional footage on the DVD.

The human drama was edited just right--not so much focus on the guys that you lose sight of the beer and breweries, not so much documentary that it feels cold and journalistic.  Beer's meant to be fun, and they showed it in a great, positive light.  And while we all love to hate the macrobreweries, they didn't get overly preachy here, avoiding the pitfall of turning into some kind of activist propaganda.  Like a rare good politician, they kept the focus on the positives of the craft brewing movement.

Fun.  Too short.",1303430400,,1058,4.681081081081081
8182150,5,B000NVZK2O,"What a great concept, to travel the nation visiting great microbreweries and talking about the process. I really appreciated the information and pictures of all the breweries. I enjoyed the way that the documentary went through the process of making beer and how each brewer was able to talk about these steps. Great documentary worth watching many times.",1275696000,2,355,5.137931034482759
8182151,5,B000NVZK2O,Im proud to call myself a beer snob. I CANNOT stand Bud. If Im going to drink beer it better have flavor. I loved this documentary. They did a really awesome job on this. I would have liked to have seen a little more behind the scenes in some of the bigger microbrews but It was very interesting. I think they packed a little to much into one documentary and 38 breweries in 40 days is a little too fast to enjoy it. I would like to see a second documentary with some of the other microbrews or maybe someone can do one with more west coast breweries.  I would love to see Speakeasy Brewery in SF featured and maybe they could visit Jacks Cannery Bar in SF (best pub ever!). But they did an awesome job and beware what comment on the back says about you wanting to crack open a celebratory beer is true!!!,1236384000,2,805,4.160256410256411
8182152,5,B000NVZK2O,"A group of beer lovers tour about 28 breweries in 30 days -- they talk to owners and brewers about the business philosophy, advice and thoughts about brewing better beer from some of the best microbrewers in America.  These guys tour breweries ranging from basement-type setups to state of the art facilities ... if you like beer, you'll like this movie, if you're a home brewer, you'll love it.",1193270400,4,395,4.72463768115942
8182153,4,B000NVZK2O,"This documentary was a great watch for the aspiring homebrewer/microbrewer.  It is not a how-to video, nor a complete tour video, but it is a nice view of some of the small American breweries.

We all know the big boys of brewing, now watch this to see the faces and stories behind the little guys who are out to have fun!  Overall a good documentary.  It does jump around a bit, but overall it left me wanting to see the entire footage they shot.

I would recommend this video!!",1175558400,4,479,4.337078651685394
