629023,4,6303265812,"Rutger Hauer stars as Nick Randall, a former CIA man turned bounty hunter.  He's a steely nerved, icy professional who rounds up the scum of society for very high prices.  But now, Randall finds himself as bait in a tug of war between the CIA, FBI, and LAPD.  Once the hunter, Randall has become the target of international terrorist Malak Al Rahim, played by Gene Simmons of the rock group KISS.  What once was a job for Randall has become a mission; get Al Rahim at all costs!
The action in this movie is well done.  Simmons does an excellent job as Al Rahim, and the pace is fast.  The special effects are dazzling, and Rutger Hauer has some good one-liners along the way.  If you're a fan of good action and shoot 'em up movies, then this movie should be included.",1043107200,13,768,4.366197183098592
629024,5,6303265812,"Bounty hunter Nick Randall (Rutger) is alleged great-grand son of famous TV bounty hunter Josh Randall (played successfully
by Steve McQueen back in the 50's). Rutger may not be a
psycho (The Hitcher-'86), a space con (Blade runner-'82) or
a blind white Samurai (Blind Fury-'90) but no problemo!
Gene (I was the masked bass player of KISS) Simmons takes
over. After the absurd hermaphrodite creature he featured in a John Stamos movie (Never too young to die-'86), this is
trully brilliant casting (though not very politically correct,
I mean him being a Jew and meanwhile portaying an Arab
terrorist in this movie). If you're a fan of action movies you have already seen this one. If you're not, hey, let me tell
you this: The end scene with the grenade stuffed in Gene's
mouth is one of World Cinema's all time classic scenes and it
makes this movie a must-see just to hear Rutger say his

In Deadlock, he plays a diamond thief who gets betrayed by his fiance, which lands him in a prison where the prisoners are the guards. Prisoners wear an exploding necklace that is linked to another prisoner. Go outside the 100 yard limit and BOOM!!
In Wanted Dead Or Alive, Rutger Hauer plays a bounty hunter who is seeking a terrorist played by Gene Simmons of KISS.

629029,3,6303265812,"The most interesting thing to do with this film is to watch the first few minutes and then try to predict who will be left alive at the end.
I'm  sorry to say that I got this right, it's so easy to predict what will  happen.
The plot breaks no new ground. An Arab terrorist, Malik Al Rahim  (Gene Simmons) enters the US with the intention of blowing up a Los Angeles  chemical plant in revenge for the accident at Bhopal. The authorities  persuade  Nick Randall (Rutger Hauer) to come out of retirement to help  hunt down his old nemesis. It's a kind of reversal of Blade Runner where  Harison Ford is the cop dragged out of retirement to hunt down and kill  Rutger Hauer.
The film deals up lots of action, it is fast paced and  Rutger Hauer's sardonic wit helps to keep things moving along. Sadly, at no  point does the film ever really create any sort of tension or suspense. Nor  does the film really add any depth to the characters.
It's the sort of  film that you will enjoy watching with a small group of friends a takeaway  pizza and a six pack but the Lethal Weapon series do this kind of thing  much better.",965779200,4,1116,4.2727272727272725

I watch this again and again for the last scene and particularly the last line. Interestingly, this movie could not be made today, I think, because the antagonists are Muslim.

629312,4,6303265812,"Action movies are a joy to watch. The bad guy cowers at the end of the film and the good guy always knows what to say, in any situation. These action movies are no different, in fact they are mostly formulaic. But they follow the formula so well, that they succeed at being good. My exposure to Rutger Hauer had been limited to a few roles and most of them were bit parts. With the exception of his portrayal of Roy Batty in Blade Runner, I had never seen Rutger Hauer on the screen for more than 15-20 minutes. So it was a pleasant surprise to see him carry his own action film. Let me tell ya, he could've been a bigger action star if he had decided to keep making action flicks. Wanted: Dead o Alive is a really good movie. The story can be slightly confusing sometimes, but the climax and the action scenes are very well made. Special mention goes to Gene Simmons of ""KISS"" fame for portraying the bad guy. And this guy was BAD. He was a hateful villain.
Death before dishonor was an unexpected gem of an action movie. I had never heard of Fred Dryer before this movie, and now I'm left to wonder why he didn't continue acting in these types of roles. This movie is just cool. It's super patriotic, and there are a couple of scenes in the movie that are actually quite impacting. All in all this set is very good. Definitely worth 10 bucks.",1296259200,9,1344,4.25390625

Yes it's not quite the front to back action packed style film you might have grown used to but it still has a good story and plenty of hero filled action.  Rutger plays the part of a bounty hunter most of us middle age men would like to experience for just a week or two.  Although it was a bit slower than I recall I still would recommend it to any 40 something year old man who enjoyed action movies from the 80's.,1263254400,,593,4.130434782608695
629318,4,6303265812,"It's time again for that really popular pastime: Rutger Hauer Classic Cinema. Tonight's film of choice is WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE, and it features our favorite Dutch dude Rutger Hauer once more throwing his hat into that cinematic genre of 1980s action cheese. And just because I mention ""cheese"" doesn't necessarily mean that this movie's a skunker. WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE has its share of cool moments, and I remember it in a good way, and especially that so very memorable ending.

This movie will resonate more for those who've caught the original WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE, which was a television western series back in the late '50s. It starred an up-and-coming Steve McQueen, who was and still is just about the epitome of cool. McQueen's character was Josh Randall, a bounty hunter of few words who let ""Mare's Laig"" - his nifty 1892 44/40 center fire Winchester carbine - do the talking for him. And I guess this paragraph turned out to be a pimpfest for Steve McQueen's western show. Eh, so be it. It's certainly worth checking out.

But back to Rutger Hauer Classic Cinema. Rutger Hauer plays Nick Randall, the great-grandson of Josh Randall and also a bounty hunter in Los Angeles, and, yeah, it's a bummer that there weren't enough connections or references made to tie in with Steve McQueen's character. Nick Randall is a loner, and he's looking to make a big enough score so that he can fix up his grungy boat. But then his past comes back to bite him.

Gene Simmons, from the band KISS, back then was trying to branch out from white make-up and from sticking out his tongue, and, in the '80s he took on a few villainous roles. Here, Gene brings understated menace to the screen as Middle Eastern terrorist Malak Al Rahim, although Gene never does end up sounding Middle Eastern. Malak Al Rahim arrives in L.A. and soon blows up a movie theater, and then vows to unleash even more terror on the city. Which is when the CIA gets involved, maybe because someone again forgot that the CIA friggin' isn't a domestic agency. Maybe the FBI guys were all attending Thumb Twiddling 101? Anyway, this happens to be one of those flicks which doesn't show the Company in a good light.

Nick Randall gets roped in because he's ex-CIA, and it turns out Malak Al Rahim is his responsibility since Rahim is a subject Randall failed to terminate on a past mission. Anyway, the CIA offers Randall a huge reward for bringing Rahim in, and Randall is initially skeptical but, then again, there's that grungy boat which isn't gonna get pretty by itself.

Rutger Hauer easily demonstrates his action hero chops, and even has a few good one-liners and manages to hold on enough to a passable American accent that not once did I think ""Ah, Ikea."" Hauer's strength has always been this weird intensity he's got, and he brings that here, although it disappointingly isn't as palpable as in BLADE RUNNER, NIGHTHAWKS, or THE HITCHER. But he flaunts enough of that ""Don't you eff with me"" vibe that when his boat got blown up real good (and also the folks on it), well, I started relishing and anticipating the crapstorm about to be unleashed on the bad guys. Sure 'nuff, Hauer, looking even more unhinged than usual, is soon wearing those ominous black leather threads, and the smackdowns rapidly ensue.

I like the little touches: the cache of weaponry hidden behind the baby seat in the car, the vast warehouse armory, the fact that Randall is shaky on the harmonica, that the exploded movie theater was showing RAMBO... WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE, in its action set pieces, is firmly entrenched in how they did things back in the 1980s. Explosions, gunfire, car chases, big hair waving, not a lot of martial arts stuff like everyone and their mamas seem to be able to do nowadays. But Rutger Hauer is different enough and has enough presence that, even with that hint of a beer gut, he makes it work. But he gets good help by the always classy Robert Guillaume (who, okay, does let it rip with a few eff bombs here).

WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE offers an awesome ending, that one scene alone worth one bonus star in my rating. My only regret is that that one truly scummy, vile CIA guy never does get his just desserts. Anyway, Rutger Hauer had a few years in which he hovered sort of near the box office summit. This movie falls within that window, along with BLADERUNNER, LADYHAWKE and THE HITCHER. Although, to be honest, this is probably the least of the four.

This has been Rutger Hauer Classic Cinema. ""F--- the bonus.""",1253836800,2,4500,4.6373902132998746

629321,5,6303265812,"Where to begin? GREAT movie!  Highly watchable. Rutger Hauer is one of my favorite actors of all time. Loved him in Blade Runner, this film, the Hitcher, too many to list.

Hauer's a bounty hunter who is very rough around the edges. Gene Simmons is the ultimate a-hole terrorist, a type of pre-Bin Ladin. This movie would NEVER get made nowdays with emotions running high from 9-11, understadably. It's a brutal situation.  Simmons plays Malek Al-Rahim, a super terrorist from Randall's (Hauer's) past who has come to Los Angeles to bring the city to its knees.  Hauer becomes entangled in a CIA backstabbing chess game where he's the pawn and he doesn't put up with it.

This is a movie from the days when men were men:  Selleck, Hauer, Kurt Russell, Fred Dryer, Clint Eastwood. Nowdays Justin Timerlake is a leading man (shrug!).  Hauer is a bad@$$ in this movie and a mean muthah. He takes no prisoners but is exceptionally likeable in the process...

A few twists and turns, GREAT dialogue, unique soundtrack, Gene Simmons earns an ""A+"" for villainy, and the action is fun. Great movie overall and highly worth owning on DVD! They don't make 'em like this anymore!

Just once I'd like to answer the phone like Rutgar Hauer does in this....lets it ring maybe 40 times before steadily picking up the phone and saying in a low voice......'yeahhhhhhhh'

He plays Nick Randall, the descendant of the character Josh Randall, played by Steve McQueen in the 1958-61 television series of the same name.
The movie plot is clear, to the point & only slows for a brief period then something happens.
Dated to some degree (it is a 1987 film after all), but not so much that it makes it bad.
Gene Simmons is superb as Malak Al Rahim, the terrorist who Nick had a run in with in the past. His dead pan delivery of sinister lines & action makes him a very believeable charachter.
Corky Siegel does a fine job on the harmonica giving the soundtrack ""two thumbs up"" for how it fits in this film.

Nick Randall, bounty hunter - the hunted deserved everything they got.
Don't mess with his friend or his girl.  Or there will be hell to pay.

Malak Al Rahim - made one huge mistake - he messed with both.

Randall was smart enough to make the stake-out and his FBI friend made him.  The stake-out was stupid enough to walk into his end.

Really like the loft living area that Randall had and kept his friend's bike there.  Ah well, the blonde wig done him in.

Rutger Hauer can not top ""Ladyhawk""'s Navarre for a romantic image but his Randall character [and others] ""Blind Fury"" and ""Split Secong"" - just prove his acting ability - oh yes, ""Bladerunner"" [gross] to mention a few.

629340,4,6303265812,"Wanted Dead Or Alive was one of those out-of-control  lone wolf cop movies that came out in droves in the mid-to-late 80s.  All these movies (Cobra, Runaway, Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, etc....) aspired to be Dirty Harry.  Some succeeded, most did not.  Wanted Dead or Alive was Rutger Hauer's turn at playing the vigilante cop living on the edge.  Watching it now, this movie is hilarious.  Since his role as the terrorist in Night Hawks (Sylvester Stallone & Bily Dee Willams) and his role as the psycho in The Hitcher, Hauer seemed to be lapsing in the tough-as nails roles.  Wanted Dead Or Alve does nothing to bring him back.  Rutger Hauer is one of those actors that just play a better villian.  As a villian, Hauer is creepy, vile, ruthless and cold.  As the good guy, just not as believable.  The saving grace of this predictable action cop movie is Gene Simmons (KISS) as the evil terrorist.  He must have taken notes from Hauer, because he is ruthless and cold.  He shoots without flinching.  Great role for him.  Overall, Wanted Dead or Alive is a fun watch mostly for the nostalgic 80s feel and for Gene Simmons'turn as a psycho killer.

629405,5,6303265812,"I was a grad student at Tulane when this film came out in the late-1980s. One of my classmates (his name was Scott) kept raving about the film but I waited about seventeen years before seeing it.  After seeing it, I would have to agree with Scott.

Rutger Hauer gives a great performance as a former CIA agent who is called back from retirement to help defeat a group of Muslim terrorists who have blown up a Los Angeles movie theatre, killing hundreds.  Gene Simmons (of the rock group KISS) is even better as the Arab terrorists' leader.

When this film was made, Muslim terrorists had already launched attacks in Europe but had yet to do so in the United States.  Within a few years of the release of this film, on February 26, 1993, they would set off car bombs at the World Trade Center in New York City, killing six and wounding hundreds, launching a Holy War against a United States that would not fight back until their second attack on the World Trade Center, more than eight years later.

[Note that, due to a glitch at Amazon, the reviews of the Rutger Hauer film are being jumbled together with the reviews of Steve McQueens TV show with the same title. The reviews for both items appear on the webpages for both products!]",1151107200,,1235,4.466666666666667
629406,3,6303265812,"Where to begin?  Age and the DVD have made films like this almost required purchases for bad-movie addicts who remember the glory days of the 1980s where violent, idiotic films were perfected to science.

Wanted Dead or Alive is supposed to follow the 50s TV show that starred Steve McQueen, but it doesn't really matter much, since McQueen didn't live to see this classic and make a cameo, and since they could have made the same film without the connection.  But we all know that having some kind of brand-name recognition might get one or two more people into theaters, which is why every single, two-bit TV show will be made into a film by rich movie producers who still don't understand what they're doing.

The film is highly recommended for bad-movie addicts.  Perhaps more valuable than Hauer, who eventually got lost making too many bad movies in the years following this one, we have Gene Simmons brilliantly portraying an evil Arab terrorist, making the film plenty relevant today as the world has been reduced to an action movie of sorts.  Simmons, who is Jewish, looks to be having fun, as he was in the Tom Selleck flick, Runaway, where he played that bad guy who used to write the names of his victims on his bullets, or something like that.  Why wasn't he cast in more films as a bad guy?  (Simmons, not Selleck).  He has the mannerisms down, he has the lines, and we all know he is one of the most shameless dollar hounds in entertainment history.  I liked the touch of him blowing up a movie theater showing a Rambo matinee, you know, in case we didn't get it.

Anyway, perhaps what folks remember most is the famous grenade-in-the-mouth ending, which upheld an iron-clad 80s rule: the badder the bad guys, the more violent and ridiculous the deaths.  This coup-de-grace was delivered the same year that Stallone hung a guy on a giant hook in Cobra, and a year after Bronson blew up a gang leader with a rocket launcher in his apartment in the unmatchable Death Wish III.

One of those cheap DVD pick-ups, the availability of such revered crap ensures you'll never be bored, and that you can always, on demand, deduct a few IQ points after slaving away for a few bucks.  In the 80s, and well into the 90s, crap like this could make it to the theater.  But they don't make 'em like this anymore.  No, instead they make worse, more expensive crap.",1133654400,2,2363,4.563981042654029

After my career in overseas black ops I went into the field bounty hunting, training both with the U.S. Marshal's Fugitive Recovery Unit and the Israeli Mossad. I can tell you that more than once I had to use my Remington 870 shotgun with laser sighting and sniper grips to ""calm down"" a fugitive. I also used my supercharged all wheel drive 1986 Dodge Diplomat with built in navigation system in many a high speed chase including one with Pablo Escobar. I admit that I am partial to this movie because I was a technical advisor. In fact Rutger Hauer's character is based largely on me and my real life exploits.

Is it 2:35 a.m. and the info-mercials are killing you? Need someting in the background while doing your needlepoint or cleaning your firearms? Then this is the movie for you ! The same kind of...charm...that makes ""Jake Speed"" work ,is in abundance in ""Wanted"".Its pace is quick,No Pulp Fiction,but still it works. Of course the action is way over the top. But its always fun to watch your hero doing things that would have him arrested.whether it's firing off warning shots in a convenience store with a shotgun,or decapitating a handcuffed terrorist with expolsives, Hauers character,Nick Randall,is immune from the repercussions of his actions. Hauer even manages to evade being partially responsible for getting a dectective killed. Yep, as far as your basic ""leather-clad-teflon-coated-hero"" goes,Hauer does all those things we wish the good guys could get away with,but of course dont... due to severe crimminal charges(Watch the news,even Marines under fire are expected to obey certain rules of war.)
Nonetheless, Hauer does a great job and Simmons is, (to say the least) surprisingly good at his role. In fact this movie is packed with great actors doing a super job.
Good action,Strong performances, mixed with the 80's era Rambo
mentality towards justice and internatonal relations, combine to make this an excellent choice for those times when looking for a ""different"" cinematic experience.",1107648000,,1537,5.329218106995885
629409,5,6303265812,"This is a 1980's no holds barred action flick at its best. Ex CIA agent Nick Randall (Rutger Hauer) turned bounty hunter, will stop at nothing to get the terrorist Malak Al Rahim (Gene Simmons) of the rock band KISS. This movie doesn't get much TV time if any because of the events from 9/11. Who would have thought Gene Simmons AKA the Demon could act. When it comes to playing a bad guy he's great, Simmons is very convincing in the role of the villain Malak Al Rahim.

In this movie where the hunter has become the hunted, the fast pace and non stop action will keep you on the edge of your seat. If that's not enough to reel you in, then stick around just for the ending. This movie has one of the best endings in an action flick of all time. This movie shows you there's only one brand of justice for the bad guy. I agree completely with another reviewer who stated Gene Simmons was great in ""Runaway"" opposite Tom Selleck. With Gene's menacing look, he could have had a long Hollywood career as a villain. Action fans won't want to miss this one, so do yourself a favor and treat yourself to ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" today. If you're looking for a movie where Rutger Hauer is the terrorist pick up a copy of Night Hawks with Sylvester Stallone and Billy Dee Williams you won't be disappointed.

However this is a great low key action film for it's time, the violence is still very graphic. Rutger Hauer was great in the 1980s, before he discovered Burger King! As well as The Hitcher (which was released around the same time) he really had a presence.

7844141,5,6303265812,"From what I remember, this film kind of came and went with little attention. It rarely stands out as one of Rutger Hauers more iconic film roles, and thats a shame really because having revisited this some 3 decades later, its really a pretty great little film. I don't know why it took me so long to come back to it, or why it never stuck with me the way other action films from the same era did. But alas, Im here now with some great news. Wanted: Dead or Alive rules.

If theres anything its known for, it will more than likely be the fact that Gene Simmons plays the villain, here as a Middle Eastern terrorist who has a vendetta against Nick Randall (Rutger Hauer)., a bounty hunter. But really, Simmons barely appears on screen, resulting in more of a glorified cameo until the very end. Its really Hauers show and man does he deliver the goods.

W:DoA surprised me for a number of reasons. First, its more of a thriller rather than an action film. There is action, and it actually starts off like a great one, but there really isn't a lot in here, or at least not as much as youd expect. But that doesnt take away from the enjoyment factor because regardless, its a great piece of Cult Cinema anyway. One of its other surprising aspects was just how well it was made. Writer/Director Gary Sherman (Vice Squad, Poltergeist III) displays a fine hand and a sharp eye for directing action. Well, not just the action, but the entire film. The film just looks fantastic, and clearly delivers the goods on a visual level. Its yet another reminder of how these little films were made at one point, 30 years ago, where directors actually put effort into setting cameras shots up, in giving the film an overall aesthetic. They don't do that anymore, and if they do, its becoming exceedingly rare. Lastly, the whole Middle Eastern ( Delta Force) terrorist angle obviously wouldnt play today, but its interesting to see how often this idea was used ( in films back in the 80s, and how easy they made it look.

Gene Simmons never really broke out into acting the way he really could have, more often than not playing himself in television show guest stints, but he did score a few memorable roles as a villain (all in the 80s) in cult classics like Runaway, Never Too Young To Die and this one. He does so well in fact that its a shame he never stretched his acting chops further into other areas or projects. Or hell, it would have been just as cool if he just kept playing villains for the rest of his acting career because hes so good at it, even when he doesnt utter a single line. His menacing gaze alone says enough, and comes off as way too easy and natural for him.

Rutger Hauer is a revelation in this. Much in the same way he made Split Second as enjoyable as it was, hes the main reason why this film is as great as it is, the glue that keeps it all together. Its his show, and he steals and chews every scene and every second he appears on screen. The film looks fantastic, and Simmons is a great villain, but its Hauer who elevates this film to far beyond your average 80s action/thriller. He makes it fun, whether hes playing it as a straight up tough guy, or in the moments when hes vulnerable  Hauer gives the role a healthy dose of bravado, even when hes being a jerk.

If there was one thing I would have changed, its that I probably would have liked just a bit more action, but thats not in any way a complaint, because as it stands, W:DoA is a fantastic film, with enough thriller and action elements to keep you entertained, on top of everything else you get such as a sharp script and memorable performances. If its been a while, its definitely time to revisit this little gem. You won't regret it.",1491264000,,3715,4.361271676300578
