8337214,5,B001R2B0XG,"Gokor is the man. A great DVD set for anyone interested in learning more about the leg lock game. A fair amount of it is irrelevant to jiu jitsu competition but it is still goof information to have if you want to be a well rounded grappler. Clear, straight forward explanations of techniques. Logical progression of skills.",1465257600,,323,4.684210526315789
8337215,4,B001R2B0XG,"Aside from Gokor's horrible English (he is this way in person, too), the leg locks in this series is awesome. It is extremely viable and I would recommend it to anyone who is in search of improving their ground game playing footies. Bear in mind, however, that I believe the best bang for your buck is Erik Paulson's Killer Leg Logs. Erik tends to be a little more detailed when describing and you can actually understand the majority of his dialogue. Other than that, this is a nice collection to add to your library.",1372118400,3,518,4.5212765957446805
8337216,4,B001R2B0XG,"Goker's DVD is good.  I like the counter leglock disk the best.  The DVD covers the basics, open guard (top and bottom), counters and other positions.",1365638400,2,150,4.730769230769231

8337218,5,B001R2B0XG,"Gokor is an extremely experienced grappler. Gokor's system is extremely intelligent. All of his DVDs will blow your mind. In my 10 plus years of doing practical martial arts, I've never come across more enlightening information on grappling, and I've trained with some pretty big names ranging from schools in San Diego and LA, Vegas, Miami,to Thailand and more. Anyway, if you have experience with grappling, you will be amazed by how much this DVD will improve your game, being that it is a leg lock DVD and very few, if any, schools in the world can teach leg locks like Gokor can. I guarantee two things will happen after you purchase and study this DVD: 1) Your game will improve tremendously and consequently you will be tapping a lot of people out; 2) Your BJJ school will tell you that those kinds of moves are not allowed unless you have at least a purple belt because the moves are far too dangerous. I use these moves all the time, and they're no more dangerous than a neck crack or armbar. Just train these moves with the right attitude. Cheers and good luck in your training.",1347926400,,1088,4.5561224489795915
8337219,5,B001R2B0XG,"The instructor, gokor c. Is obviously very knowledgeable on the subject of leg locks and is able to convey the information very well on this 5 DVD set.  He explains not just techniques but concepts that can be applied outside of the techniques demonstrated,",1341705600,4,257,4.840909090909091
8337220,5,B001R2B0XG,"Great video. Very user friendly. The best teaching I have seen on video yet - he is very precise in his teaching.
The video is a little pricey but well worth it.",1281916800,4,161,4.0625
