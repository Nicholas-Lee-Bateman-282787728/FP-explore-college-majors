1892969,4,B00009W8JZ,"As a person who has, in her whole life never had cable, the rare instances of my actually seeing a cable show is something that I treasure (except that one time when I suffered through Sex and the City and the Anna Nicole Show).
Never having seen Mr. Show before the first and second season came out on DVD or VHS, I watched it and was slightly impressed. A lot of the skits in the episodes seemed rushed and forced. There were a few shining moments when I laughed out loud. So, when the third season came out I was more or less apathetic.
Then, I actually watched it. And now I see why everyone says that this show is brilliant. And it is! Full of classic moments like, Thrill World ""Two whole minutes underwater!"", Druggachusettes (sp?), Pit Pat and ""Got a Good Thing Going"" and the collaboration between the Catholic church and the Church of Satan (who actually don't worship Satan, but we'll let that slide because it's funny) to have people take the Devil seriously.
Season three made me a fan! I give it a 4 for the lack of a play all option.",1062547200,4,1048,4.3520408163265305
1892970,5,B00009W8JZ,"unbelievable ! i live overseas and don't get back to america often. when i do, i like to record some favorite TV shows, 'cause i can't get them over here. during a visit a few years ago, i was recording the simpsons, saturday nite live, etc., when this weird little show came on that i just thought was outrageously funny. never caught the name of it, but i recorded this one episode that i watch from time to time. reminds me of python actually, jumping from skit to skit. very clever stuff. today, thanks to an amazon message, i now know the name of this show and will have no choice but to buy this dvd. i'll take a chance on it without hesitation.",1062460800,,651,4.258064516129032
1892971,5,B00009W8JZ,"There are two types of people in this world: people who have never heard of Mr. Show, and Mr. Show fanatics.  There seems to be little middle ground, and for good reason: Mr. Show is hands-down one of the most clever (and most underappreciated) sketch comedy shows in TV history.  Season three is finally here, and though it's Bob and David's most uneven season, it's also got some of the all-time best episodes (""Return of the Curse of the Creature's Ghost"" and ""Peanut Butter, Eggs, and Dice"" come to mind).  For fans of the series, this is a must-have.  The transfer is crisp, and the audio commentaries, while not as informative as on the previous set, are still very entertaining.  Special features include some promotional materials, and yet another focus on Drugachusetts, which is a bit of overkill on a just so-so sketch if you ask me.
For the unitiated, Mr. Show is a clever and topical sketch comedy show with sketches that seamlessly blend into one another.  Bob Odenkirk and David Cross, along with a great cast of supporting actors, bring a wide variety of characters to life with performances a step above your usual comedy fare.  Even when Mr. Show is not laugh-out-loud funny, it's still incredibly clever.  HBO never gave it a fair shot, which is a shame, but it appears that Mr. Show was just too hip for the room.  If you're new to the series, start with the first set of DVDs, as the episodes are a bit stronger, and there is a subtle amount of self-referencing humor, which can only be appreciated by seeing them in order.",1062288000,,1544,4.626373626373627
1892972,5,B00009W8JZ,"Okay, so I stole the above line from Jeneane Garafalo.  But it is true, nonetheless.
Fans of Mr. Show who were ecstatic upon the release of Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD are now reaching a climax with the release of Season 3.  Bob and David hit their stride even more smoothly in Season 3, and delighted us with some truly inspired and ingenious comedy.  The part I was looking forward to most was the ""Pre-Taped Call-In Show"", which even the cast reveals on the commentary track to be their favorite sketch of the series.  The fact that the sketch is inordinantly complex for a comedy bit makes David's flawless execution of it more than funny - it is masterful!  And he performed it without the aid of cue cards, which I would have REQUIRED if I were doing it.
I don't care where you buy this or how much you have to pay for it.  Just get it!  Bob and David have set the bar so high with this series (Season 3 in particular) that nearly every other comedy sketch series seems just that much paler in comparison.  This series, Bob, and David belong in the Comedy Hall of Fame.
Mr. Show -- a Famous Mortimer production.",1061510400,19,1112,4.3125
1892973,5,B00009W8JZ,"In the late 90s, the pioneering sketch comedy of Monty Python's Flying Circus was seen through to its logical conclusion via the work of David Cross and Bob Odenkirk.  Offering both blistering social commentary (David's fellow castmembers criticize his lifestyle choice when he reveals that he is, in fact, bald) and extreme flights of absurdity that, remarkably, retain coherence (In one sketch, a group of ""Sopranos""-style mafioso argue over what the highest number in existence is), five years after the end of its run, the world of comedy has yet to catch up to ""Mr. Show"".
The third season of Mr. Show improves on the first two by a considerable margin.  The ideas are more focused and the execution is more precise.  As such, these episodes are more consistently funny.  For the uninitiated and curious, I definitely recommend the third season (rather than the first/second) an introduction to Mr. Show (not that there aren't quite a few moments of brilliance in the first two seasons, they're just spaced further apart).
Fans of Monty Python, the Kids in the Hall, the Upright Citizens Brigade, Tenacious D, and/or the State won't be disappointed by this DVD.  Actually, I'm of the opinion that the ""Pre-Taped Call-In Show"" constitutes the most inspired bit of lunacy aired on TV since the ""Ministry of Silly Walks"".  Fans of Curb Your Enthusiasm, ""This Is Spinal Tap"", Bill Hicks, and David Sedaris will probably dig Mr. Show too; not due to similarities, but rather, because Mr. Show also falls into the category of ""brainy"" comedy.  People who enjoy Yo La Tengo, McDonald's New McGriddle (TM) and four-foot ""incense burners"" should also check out Mr. Show.
WARNING: If you're typically offended by ""edgy"" (lack of a better word) comedy (South Park, etc.), you may want to steer clear.  Also, if you're more into physical comedy (Adam Sandler, Jackass, etc.), Mr. Show may not be for you.  I'm not trying to be condescending or judgmental or anything, I think Jackass is hilarious, I'm just sayin' is all...
Oh, when the fourth season comes out, disregard everything I've said here and buy it.  The fourth season of Mr. Show constitutes the funniest ten episodes of any television show, ever.  And it's not just me talking here, either; it's in Guinness.  Look it up.  Swear.",1059523200,58,2284,4.932114882506528

1893101,5,B00009W8JZ,"Mr. Show, season Three, is quite possibly one of the funniest things you will ever see. Unless you're blind, then you're SOL.

The mad minds behind the first two brilliant seasons, Bob Odenkirk and David Cross, return to reprise their roles as ""Bob"" and ""David"" (apart from understudy Kedzie Matthews, who takes over for Bob when he has to go shopping). They bring the funny, they make you laugh, they make you wonder how such a glorious creation could exist in the absence of a just and caring God.

Quite simply, this is the finest American sketch comedy I've ever seen (and yes, I have seen Mad TV). If you want smart, savvy, hip and hilarious comedy...this will have to do. No, it's better than that. It will change your life.

The commentary tracks are excellent. They don't resort to the ""Guest Commentator"" thing (where a cast member pretends to be one of their characters from the show) as much, and when they do, it's not as cheesy. There's the usual portion of worthless onscreen trivia (""It was really hot that day.""), but there's also a lot about bits they loved, bits they hated, bits that didn't quite work, and why.
The bonus features are short and almost worthless. There are two lame joke biographies, apparently extracted from Bob & David like a homework assignment, a ""Best of Mr. Show"" feature that collects clips from seasons 1 & 2 (which you've probably already seen, if you bought season 3), and a few funny clips from an HBO-sponsored comedy festival.

There is absolutely no reason that you should not own and enjoy it unless you are a prude who is easily offended by swearing or a simpleton who cannot understand the beautiful gifts of satire and sarcasm. So many people still fail to understand irony and satire because their definiton of it was derived from an Alanis Morisette song or the treacle that is a Friends episode. If you don't find this funny there is probably something wrong with you.
The only wrong turn was the BioDome sketch. There's nothing wrong with using beastiality for humor (witness the Hail Satan Network sketch) but this sketch is just unfunny.
Otherwise, pure comic brilliance and I willingly ""shake the crime stick"" (see Seasons 1&2) at a society that doesn't worship Bob and David and the rest of the cast (especailly Tom Kenny) over the banality of network TV and supposed brillant works like the lame Sex in the City.",1077408000,2,963,4.738095238095238
1893116,5,B00009W8JZ,"and that, if for no other reason, justifies purchasing this set.
The show really picks up steam with this season. The writers were on a roll and most of the show's classic moments are on this set.
America Blows up the Moon, Return of the Curse of the Creature's Ghost are among my favorites.
If you liked Seasons one and two, you won't be diappointed.",1076889600,,351,4.415384615384616
1893117,3,B00009W8JZ,"Mr. Show had it's moments. Blowing up the moon and the introducton of Mr. Wiggles(a monkey who will play ball) had me on the floor as did the guys protesting to get the girls to sleep with them(hehey, hoho, the girls we slept with have got to go!)
  Moments like these were not par for the course, though. For every one of these there's a sketch about animal love or a codependent landlord. It's worth it nonetheless for the stream of conciousness links between skits.",1075075200,3,468,4.4941176470588236
1893118,5,B00009W8JZ,"This DVD makes me pickle-red.  This is why it's like Christmas, daily.  Some of these sketches float, others sink -- but liquid's like that.  And sometimes belly-flops are best?  Jump!",1073865600,2,184,5.033333333333333
1893119,5,B00009W8JZ,"Mr. Show...what can I say?  This is probably one of the funniest sketch comedy shows I've ever seen.  I do not get the HBO, but I did manage to see a couple of shows back when this aired in the mid to late 90's, and so, when I saw the series was being released on DVD, I knew it would be something worth getting.
The show, which stars Bob Odenkirk and David Cross, is a blend of sketch, live action, and pre-recorded comedy.  The humor, while not for most, tends to really cut deep at times, dealing with a wide variety of social issues and beliefs.  Smart, funny, witty...things we don't often see so this is definitely worth looking into if you are looking for something a little edgier than SNL.
Probably one of my favorite bits that I can remember is the one where David Cross is playing the host of a television program called 'The Pre-Taped Call In Show'.  Only problem is the viewers calling in can't seem to understand the concept that the show that is currently airing was the one recorded the week before, and the topic is different...sounds confusing, and even had me going, but that is what was so funny about it.  As more viewers call in and ask about the wrong topics, the host gets increasingly agitated.  Finally, he shows a series of his previous shows to try and illustrate a point, and we see the first show with him being very optimistic and having a full head of hair and the subtle loss of said hair and growing temper as the show progresses.  This really must be seen to be properly enjoyed, as I know I am unable to convey the humor properly.
This two-disc set contains a number of special features, including a commentary on each episode and some promotional spots, but the real gold is in the episodes. If you are easily offended then I would say skip this, as it will probably upset you...if so, just go enjoy a nice peanut butter and egg sandwich...with dice.",1073606400,2,1887,4.417867435158501
1893120,5,B00009W8JZ,"The power of laughter is awsome to behold when it's done to perfection by people that really know what thier doing. Bob and David yeild this power like a blade of divine honesty, slicing through our force-feed conseptions of America and all of the consumer- crazy, believe anything, inpractical and ass-backward
mentality that we've slid into over the years.
  I'm not a new discoverer of Mr. Show, I used to watch it when it origonally aired on HBO. Back then it just seemed like my friends and I were the only ones that saw it or gave a rat's ass about it. It was always like our own little inside joke, you could say a line from any episode and your buddy would finish it.
Sorry, the point is that I'm glad that now everybody gets to witness the brilliant satire of Mr. Show without having to biuld a time machine to go back and see it when it origonally aired ( because it would be worth the trip) TURA-DELOO! the Viewer.",1072742400,,925,4.372093023255814
1893121,2,B00009W8JZ,"I'd never seen Mr. Show before but recently borrowed the third season DVD from a friend because I'd heard good things and wanted to check it out. Well, I watched the first three episodes here and I scarcely cracked a smile. I think David Cross is a very funny dude but I just didn't think much of the sketch comedy going on here. None of it seemed all that clever, well-written, or well-acted. I was at least expecting something more edgy and better written than SNL but what I saw here completely fell flat. This seemed to me like amateurs trying to emulate SNL and doing a very mediocre job of it. Maybe this is one of those things you have to watch a lot of before you start to ""get it"" because it certainly didn't work for me.",1069632000,6,730,4.258992805755396

1893134,2,B00009W8JZ,"I'm a big fan of sketch comedy like Python, KITH, UCB, Exit 57, & SNL.  I loved Seasons 1 & 2 of Mr. Show.  The sketches were fresh, witty, and edgy, but most of all, they were fun -- fun to watch, and you could tell Bob & David & the cast had fun performing them.
Season 3, however, seemed like work.  It certainly felt like work to me, sitting through heavy-handed, indulgent, and overly-long sketches like the Satanic Evangelists and Hunger Strike.  There were some bright spots, to be sure, but they were all sketches included as extras on the Season 1 & 2 DVD in the ""Best of Mr. Show"" newscast.  Aside from those previously-viewed sketches, episodes 1-8 made me laugh about 3 times total, with ""Sleepy Devil Breakfast Soup"" accounting for 2 of those.  Episodes 9 & 10 were much better, but by then I had already soured on this season.
The extras from the Aspen Comedy Festival were funny, but short.  The ""Best of"" compilation ""Fantastic Newness"" wasn't nearly as clever as the newscast from Season 1-2.
I guess true Mr. Show fans have to own this DVD to complete the library.  Anyone else is better off saving their money, or investing in a second copy of Seasons 1-2.",1064361600,4,1175,4.483568075117371
1893135,5,B00009W8JZ,"If you desire sketch comedy that is more than the same three lame re-occuring characters wrapping themselves in layers of refried concepts, then feast your eyes, ears and most importantly cerebral cortex on this Show of Shows, Mr. Show.  Discovering this television series in the bowels of the largest pay cable distributor HBO years ago made me and my college roomates feel like part of a comedy cult that had truly been blessed to watch two ""unconventional"" looking comedy geeks surgically destroy any logical conventions of traditional sketch comedy without making anything that unfolded in each episode feel the slightest bit forced or funny at the sake of being cheap.  Comedy shows had been abstract to the point of absurdity before Mr. Show, rolled one scene into the next before Mr. Show and tackled deep societal issues before Mr. Show, but none in my opinion have acheived such hilarity simultaneosly working on as many comedic levels as this show is constantly juggling, never letting any of these concepts override the others.
  The greatest thing about this show is watching its evolution from aspiring greatness in the first two seasons to disgustingly brilliant by the time the third season's sizeable budget lift occured, finally letting the props and sets shine as much as the comedy always did.  The genius of a sketch such as ""Druggachusettes"" would have always been funny, but the adult 70's cartoon lunacy of the elaborate prop and costume creations this season afforded turned the sketch's wordplay into neon-colored wackiness.  Quite simply, this show is for anyone who likes to laugh hard both as an outward display as well as having inward cranial explosions, marveling at the amount of satirical information a piece of media can throw at you at once while just being plain ol' DAMN HEE-LARIOUS.  This collection will prepare you nicely for the fourth season, of which is an even inconceviably more incredible final season in its perfection of the Mr. Show ""formula"" we have grown to be astonished by!

1893136,5,B00009W8JZ,"This is the funniest show of all time, hands down.  An argument could be made for Monty Python, but aside from that, nothing comes close.  This BLOWS Kids in the Hall, SCTV, and SNL out of the water.  Not all the sketches work, but there is a lot of heart and soul in even the weak sketches.  Even those weak sketches are better than anything created by the aforementioned shows. This season is their weakest season, in my opinion, with season 4 being their best.  Even that, however, should not dissuade you; it's not a slight on this season so much as extreme praise for the fourth.
That being said, I would give this 4.5 stars if it were possible.  The commentary is hard to follow with so many people talking at once.  There are some funny comments from the cast, though, and I enjoy hearing what they have to say, no matter how inane.
On a final note (not about the DVD), I met David Cross in Milwaukee and he gave my friends and me free tickets to his comedy show when it was sold out (this was two years ago on the tour for Shut Up you F-cking Baby).  We had driven from St. Louis, and just happened to run into him outside the theatre immediatly after finding out there were no tickets left.  He was cool as hell, super friendly to us ... college kids, and I do not mind making him rich off my money.  Buy this now.",1063670400,5,1323,4.214285714285714

This DVD definitely does not disappoint. I have to disagree with what one reviewer commented on though. I feel as though this season is a lot more polished than the first and second...they seem to have hit their stride during the third season and it really shows.
If you're a fan of groups/shows like Kids in the Hall, Upright Citizens Brigade, or Monty Python, you definitely must see this, as well as the first and second season DVD.",1063584000,3,555,4.56

There are too many great moments to mention, but just watch ""Peanut Butter, Eggs, and Dice"" or ""Please Don't Kill Me"" and I'll send you a jar of Mundee's ""Mustmayostardayonnaise"" if you don't laugh until you nearly keel over.
