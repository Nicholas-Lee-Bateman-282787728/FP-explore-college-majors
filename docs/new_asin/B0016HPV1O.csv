8262610,4,B0016HPV1O,"This is a highly-effective Meditation DVD, based on Buddhist principles.  The one and only drawback is that it was obviously taped on VHS first and transferred to DVD, so the media quality is poor.  Still, the messages are the same and the length is just right for a half hour-plus full Meditation, or less if you just want to do one principle.  Venerable Thubten Lhundrup has a soothing voice and is easy to follow.  Recommended!",1485129600,,430,4.693333333333333

8262612,5,B0016HPV1O,"This DVD was given to me several years ago.  I watched a few minutes of it and put it aside.  I only recently dug it out and sincerely tried it.  I am now at a place where I need quiet in my life and within myself.  I've tried many relaxation methods, but none have worked as well for me as this DVD.  I find his voice very soothing and the principles he discusses bring peace.

I don't believe it will suit everyone; peace and relaxation are very personal things.  But I love it!",1423180800,,480,4.096774193548387
8262613,5,B0016HPV1O,I order this for a friend and for myself.....the smplified explanation is what the general public needs to understand the spiritual outside of their own religious belief.,1396310400,,170,5.333333333333333
8262614,3,B0016HPV1O,"A short DVD that teaches the fundamentals of Buddhist meditations. Does not provide a step-wise method for meditating, but rather Buddhist teachings on which you should reflect upon during meditation. Useful and will prove to be helpful, but was not quite what I had expected. It was inexpensive, however, so well worth the price.",1232409600,6,330,5.12962962962963
