7989528,3,B000095J0S,"This mystery surrounding the legend of ""Angel Enmascarado"" is a surprisingly good quality melodrama. Obviously based on the Santo legacy, a tabloid reporter named Olmo Robles tries to uncover the true identity of Angel Enmascarado following the wrestler's death. Bit by bit, Robles uncovers scandals and questions surrounding the wrestler's life, and gets involved a little deeper than he intended.

I found it interesting that while this movie itself is pretty good, the few wrestling scenes are some of the worst ever caught on film. Ironic because there have been many lucha libre movies in which the film was abysmal, but the wrestling scenes were excellent.

The story is very well paced, and has that vintage lucha libre/comic book hero aura. The mystery builds to a pretty good climax, but then fizzles with a weak ""To Be Continued"" ending. Considering that this film was made nearly fifteen years ago, I doubt the sequel will happen, so I guess we'll have to make up our own conclusions about ""Angel Enmascarado.""",1102204800,,1021,5.035502958579881
