8721554,5,B01088HF2O,"If you remember Electric Light Orchestra from the 1970's and 1980's, this is the LIVE, ON-STAGE reunion in Hyde Park, England. This is a live concert, with full orchestra on stage. No special effects, no 64 track mixing boards and over dubs. This is ELO playing all the songs that made them famous (and a few others). THEY SOUND GREAT!  GREAT LIVE PERFORMANCE YOU CAN'T MISS IF YOU LIKED ELO! Show this to your kids so that they know what a REAL musical performance looks and sounds like.",1532217600,,488,4.545454545454546

8721557,5,B01088HF2O,"If you could only listen to one classic rock concert, this is the one to watch and listen. Jeff Lynne, of course, is the maestro of rock and just listening to this, even though it's live, is like listening to an ELO album. I had most of this stuff on vinyl back in the day and it's a great  trip down memory lane.",1466726400,2,313,3.9682539682539684
