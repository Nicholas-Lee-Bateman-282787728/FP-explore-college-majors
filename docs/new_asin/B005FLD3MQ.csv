8470179,4,B005FLD3MQ,"First of all, the quality of the DVD did not meet the same staandard of excellence as the Shekinah Glory Live & Jesus DVDs.  This one was dark at times as strobe lights were used.  The sound was also not as good. Some of the soloists sounded a little flat at times, but it was still good.
Even with its short comings, this DVD was highly enjoyable. Each CD/DVD is very different. There were a lot of different instrumental solos with dancers which were beautiful.  The viewer did get to see the dancers all throughout this DVD.  I also did get to see the audience's interaction which made me feel as if I were there.  It was a very worshipful experience, & I came away feeling peaceful & relaxed.  Everyone worked very hard to put this together. The combination of the production leaves it at a 4 overall rating. I was glad that I bought this DVD. This is 1 DVD that lasts 2 hours & 11 minutes so you get your money's worth. I do not know how the CD compares.",1376179200,,959,4.241758241758242
8470180,4,B005FLD3MQ,"This dvd was awsome. I hope they come to Houston,Tx. I surely will attend. Very inspirational and it ministered to my family. I love this ministry of music. They truly usher in the Holy Spirit.",1338595200,,193,4.542857142857143
8470181,2,B005FLD3MQ,"Anyone who knows or have seen other dvds from Shekinah Glory knows that this one was very different. It seems like they were trying to put all types of things on the dvd just for the dvd sake.  The artist was good but...it took away from there more established dance ministry, which I think are the best Ive ever seen.  Also I love love love when the minstrels play and like I said before I love the dancing but the solo was awkward to watch with the dancer. I would have just focused on the minstrel or one or the other maybe. It was edited terrible and some parts were pictures and not even a video.  This dvd had much more prophetic words which I love but wasn't shown on the dvd. The dvd just jumps from one part to another not at all smoothly like past dvds. Their past dvds made you want to be there but not this one.",1335139200,,823,4.099378881987578
8470182,4,B005FLD3MQ,"I anticipated the launching of this DVD ever since I heard the Refreshed by Fire cd.  Although the songs on this DVD are great, the video quality was not up to SGM's ususal standard.  It was (visually) too dark, and looked like a second generation copy instead of an original copy. Had I known that I would've just bought the CD instead.",1331510400,2,337,4.419354838709677
