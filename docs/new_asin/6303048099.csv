541522,2,6303048099,"I first saw this made-for-TV production over 20 years ago, when it was bright, shiny, new, and sported a dream cast of British pros, many of whom are no longer with us.  Unfortunately, there are only two DVD releases of this production and BOTH are equally wretched, whichever you choose.  The DVD has extremely poor color and looks as if it were taken from an old, faded video print, with lots of serious color bleeds and other problems you'd find in a video that's ready to be discarded.  Any night shots, many indoor shots, and anything in which the color red is dominant will cause your eyes to positively ache.  For example, the scene where Steerforth's drowned body is discovered originally had some emotional impact, but on the DVD, the body is so unrecognizable that ones only reaction is annoyance.  And the sound quality is so tinny and horrible you'll miss a great deal of the dialogue.  If this production is ever released on a decent DVD, one will be able to relish some incredible performances, especially those of Ron Moody as Uriah, Laurence Olivier as Creakle, Ralph Richardson and Wendy Hiller as the Micawbers, Edith Evans as Betsy Trotwood, Pamela Franklin as Dora, and Susan Hampshire as Agnes, to name just a few.  Even so, there are those who might find the non-linear approach to this story confusing, since it is told in flashbacks, but I think the real confusion here rests with the viewer's inability to see and the listener's inability to hear. When you add a non-linear structure to THAT mix, you're done for.  In short, don't buy this DVD -- it's cheap but no bargain.  Hope instead that some day a decent copy will be available, because this version is an insult to all the talent who originally contributed to this production.",1070323200,28,1758,4.718954248366013
541523,2,6303048099,"This DVD  seemed a bargain, as it was a period piece with a most illustrious cast. Being a lover of period pieces and a fan of Charles Dickens, I immediately snapped it up. Well, you get what you pay for. Despite the illustrious cast, this body of work is dead on arrival.
Robin Phillips gamely plays the part of David Copperfield. He is, however, a rather colorless chap and is not strong enough to hold this film together, which is unfortunate, as he is the linchpin around which this drama revolves. Told in a series of flashbacks, this contrivance is one of the weaknesses in the film, as it tends to be confusing and adds nothing to the film, but rather, detracts a great deal. This retropsective of David Copperfield's life shows him losing his mother at an early age and being left in the hands of an unloving stepfather. Pulled out of school to toil in a factory as a young child, he runs away and makes it to the home of his loving aunt who raises him. The viewer watches him grow up in Victorian England and sees how he fairs against the vicissitudes of life. The cast of characters with whom he interacts is vibrant, and it is they who manage to keep this two hour film somewhat afloat. Ultimately, however, it tanks.
The all star ensemble is a plethora of riches, with screen greats Richard Attenborough, Ron Moody, Lawrence Olivier, Ralph Richardson, Michael Redgrave, Dame Edith Evans, Wendy Hiller, Susan Hampshire, and Pamela Franklin lighting up the screen at different moments. Even their individual, luminous  performances, however, are not enough to make this turkey work, so poorly put together and choppy is the film.
The DVD is offers some special features, such as a classic cartoon, a movie trivia game, and a DVD dictionary. The picture quality is sometimes grainy, though the sound quality is good.",1022198400,33,1825,4.7
541524,1,6303048099,"I intend to return this video as the sound quality as well as picture quality are very, very poor.  I was extremely disappointed as I have been trying to find the old BBC presentation of this story and thought this was it!!",1011312000,5,223,4.309523809523809

541526,4,6303048099,"This DVD of Dickens ""David Copperfield"" is a well made version of the book with a wonderful cast of British superstars. Lawrence Olivier in what is basically a cameo is Mr. Creakle, the school master, Ralph Richardson is a wonderful McCawber, Dame Edith Evans shines as Aunt Betsy, Ron Moody is creepy as Uriah Heep - all contribute wonderful performances to this modestly priced DVD. With a cast like this, it is a real bargin. But, it does have some flaws. It is very slow paced. It seems like it is being stretched at some points to fill a 2 hour running time. Robin Phillips is a rather passionless title character.
The color is subdued as fits the period. The direction by Delbert Mann is also subdued, but fitting in a number of scenes. Even with the all star cast, there is no upstaging or scene stealing. Each star contributes a finely drawn character.
The disk does not contain any extras for the film itself, but does have a movie trivia game and a vintage Warner Brothers cartoon.
All in all it is a nice addition to a DVD collection of a Dickens masterpiece.",995760000,17,1070,4.520618556701031

Of all the movie versions of the book that I've seen this comes the closest to enacting the Major Theme: the maturation of love as one of the purposes of human existence. And, of course, Dickens' favorite theme: the importance that one human being can make either for the good of us all or the downfall.  The style of the film may seem a bit dated as those things go but if you are familiar with the book, it hits all the ugly discomforts, the being pulled in by old admirations, the acceptence of the people that we love the most and find most attractive being both flawed and leading us away from ourselves for their benefit... It is a powerful book; close to 1000 pages. It has lots of subplots going on as one follows the main story. Dickens pulls it all together and that is where this film hangs - where Dickens pulled it all together. It seems it would be impossible to make a 2 hour film from such a long complicated book. I liked it because it followed the book, uses the voice one hears while reading the book, yet the film makers didn't bog themselvs down by using the book like a script.  Films are films, books are books.  I like this version.",1273622400,6,1263,4.320675105485232
542246,4,6303048099,"This is a made for TV movie version that is pretty good. Great British cast, and they bring the book to life. There are some slow moving spots, but it is true to the original story. If you are a high school literature teacher, it would be useful for class discussion after reading the book. The cinematography is not as good as it would be with modern technology. Some of the poor lighting is intentional as to replicate the lighting of the time period.

542247,5,6303048099,I disagree with the above review.  This is a wonderful film with outstanding actors.  Robin Phillips does an outstanding job considering the emotional starvation of the youth whom he was playing.  Robin was perfect for the part.  I don't see how it could have been done better.  I am a psychologist and I understand the delicate emotional balance needed to play Copperfield in this film.  I found this movie so fascinating that I have viewed it several times and I will buy another just to be certain I aways have a copy.,1263254400,4,521,4.608695652173913
542248,4,6303048099,"I had been searching for a copy of this movie for years. I scanned late night TV in case I might happen upon a showing, but no luck. I have never spied a video or DVD copy in any store but now, thanks to Amazon, I finally found it! I saw the original TV movie back in 1969 and was completely enchanted by it. Full scenes and dialogue from this film have remained in my mind for forty years! The atmosphere evoking 1850's England, the sweeping dramatic score, and excellent acting have always seemed, to me, to be superior to any of the multitude of other film and miniseries versions I've seen over the years. Although there are always limitations in adapting a novel to a two hour film format, I think Delbert Mann did an exceptional job.(Nevertheless, do yourself the favour of reading this unforgettable novel first.) Robin Phillips is  well-cast as the handsome, romantic and troubled, David Copperfield, the ""hero of his own life"". With an unparalleled supporting cast filled with the elite of British theatre and film (Ralph Richardson, Edith Evans, Laurence Olivier, Michael Redgrave, Wendy Hiller) portraying the varied and fascinating Dickens characters, this is a little-known gem! I highly recommend this version of ""David Copperfield"" to all lovers of Dickens, literature, and British film. (I removed one star in my rating as the film copy is a bit worse for wear, but the bargain price more than compensates for that.)",1258761600,2,1432,4.844897959183673
542249,1,6303048099,"I found Delbert Mann's David Copperfield available for online viewing after a random search, and sat down to watch it with little expectations, as most of the reviews I had heard were quite negative.  As I watched it I was thinking, ""Hey, this is pretty good, why does everyone dislike it?""  As I continued watching, I though, ""That was a strange choice in screenwriting, I wonder why they did that?""  By the end I turned it off.  Fox's David Copperfield is sketchily edited, with poor performances from main characters, inaccurate editing, and costumes and settings more fit for a Sherlock Holmes film than a Dickensian adaptation.

  The writers opted for the flashback style used in some other versions, memories coming to David as he walks mournfully along the seashore immediately at his return to England from Switzerland.  But when David did flashback, he did so disjointedly, making it difficult for people to follow unless you are thoroughly informed on what is happening.  And if you ARE informed, then you'll have a problem with the content of the flashbacks - the scenes that were kept (which were few) were switched up and blended together (a.k.a Steerforth meets Uriah Heep), and so short there was no character development.  The whole film was like watching a bunch of things happen to people you don't care for.  I don't mind it when a director adapts the story - it's to be expected in a film of two hours that must encompass a novel of 700+ pages.  Naturally scenes will be spliced or combined or deleted entirely.  But this film focuses SO MUCH on David walking across the Yarmouth beach and the voices in his head.  We see David brooding, ignoring fans of his books, saying rude things to an agonizingly air-headed Agnes.  We see him hanging out with Steerforth who seems to be as much a main character as David himself.  We don't see much of Betsey Trotwood, scarcely any Murdstones or Peggotty, no childhood interaction with David at the Wickfields.  Uriah Heep is even more horrible than Agnes: spastic and irritating, and spitting out the word ""umble"" at intervals.  It got to the point that it was hard to watch.

This film actually had some nice acting with the Peggottys and Mr. Micawber and especially young David and Steerforth at all ages. But the choices in storyline effectively negated the brighter aspects of this movie.  Unless you are simply trying to see all the versions of David Copperfield, I see no reason to watch this film when there are so many better choices.",1240876800,8,2504,4.77906976744186
542250,5,6303048099,"Those reviewers who criticize this DVD are absolutely correct. It is a terrible transfer. The picture is awful and the sound is worse. That said, it is still the only copy we have of this wonderful film.
Those reviewers who criticise the film itself simply don't know what their talking about. This is, by far, the best version of David Copperfield ever filmed. Later versions are longer, more lavish, with better DVD transfers; but none has ever surpassed this gem of a movie. Director Delbert Mann captures the spirit of Dickens' classic novel better than any other version ever produced. Its all here: the sheer evil of the Murdstones, Mr. Creakle, Steerforth & Uriah Heep, the mad humour of Micawber, Barkis & Mr. Dick, the generosity, kindness and loyalty of Aunt Betsy, Peggotty, the Micawbers & Mr. Wickfield, the foolish innocence of Little Emily & Dora, the self sacrificing love of Dan Peggotty, Ham & Agnes.
And the cast is magnificent (including Robin Phillips as David Copperfield). How can you beat a cast that includes Edith Evans, Ralph Richardson, Lawrence Olivier, Anna Massey, Richard Attenborough, James Donald, Cyril Cusack, Sinead Cusack, Michael Redgrave, Susan Hampshire, Emlyn Williams, Wendy Hiller, Pamela Franklin & Ron Moody (who is superlative as Uriah Heep)?

542328,4,6303048099,"I think this works for me because I have read David Copperfield several times and have seen several screen versions.  True, because it is not a mini-series and is setup as reflections on the past from a present author confronted by his old friend on a visit by the seaside of Yarmouth and scene of much sadness and regret as well as joy, the story is broken, and the great stars of English cinema have only limited time to shine.  But, the style and the acting and the filming locations and even the rather old fashioned music drew me into a well remembered world and reminded me that chosing life in the here and now and taking the good from the past and going on is always an option.  This needs a restoration badly (the print has much ""snow"" specs) but somehow, I do not mind too much.  The chosen scenes from the Novel and the speeches are amoung the best.  So, if you already know the book well, this little series of scenes from it with great actors from the past is rather moving (just be ready to ignore the poor transfer).",1204675200,9,1031,4.321243523316062

He is, however, a rather colorless chap and is not strong enough to hold this film together, which is unfortunate, as he is the linchpin around which this drama revolves. Told in a series of flashbacks, this contrivance is one of the weaknesses in the film, as it tends to be confusing and adds nothing to the film, but rather, detracts a great deal.

The viewer watches him grow up in Victorian England and sees how he fairs against the vicissitudes of life.

542331,1,6303048099,"If the BBC can devote 26 episodes to the Forsyte Saga (an excellent movie), surely they can devote 12 episodes to the greatest novel in the English language.  Or to put it another way, if the BBC can devote five hours to an inferior novel like ""The Buccaneers"", surely they can devote twice that number to David Copperfield.

The 1974 version of the book is 5 hours long, the longest version so far.  It includes all the important events of the novel, but only touches on these events and the many characters and does not have time to make the events as effective as they could be.  The script is creditable except a few times where they ducked a dramatic scene, breaking before and coming in afterward, including the scene which Tolstoy called the greatest in all of world literature--the storm at sea.  It is also a low budget film.

The casting is inferior with weak performances of almost all the actors (the exceptions being Anthony Andrews as Steerforth, the actress who played Aunt Betsy and the actor who played Heap, who gave us the best Uriah of any of the movie versions).  Outstanding examples of bad casting were (1) David's mother, who should have been young and dainty instead of 40 and rugged, and (2) Dora, who should have been 16 and petite instead of late 30s and tall and sturdy.  Also, the actor played Macawber too seriously without the touch of comic absurdity which the book has and which the part required.  The actor who played the grown-up David did not look half so bad as the picture on the cover and played his part adequately.

The 1935 version with its stark black and white resembles the Cruikshank drawings in the book, and many of the performances are definitive: Freddy Bartholomew as young David, Edna Mae Oliver as Aunt Betsy, Basil Rathbone as Murdstone, Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Peggoty, as well as the people who played David's mother, little Emily, and most of the minor characters.  It is an effective and indelible movie, marred only by having to leave so much out (2 hours 10 minutes) and by the horrendously inappropriate casting of W.C. Fields as Macawber (the most laconic actor in the movies to play the most loquacious character in all literature?!)  His laboring to get the words out is painful to watch.  The director, George Cukor, wanted Charles Laughton.  Louis B. Mayer overruled him.  But the filmmaker knew how to make movies, and the screenwriter knew how to write screenplays.  The same cannot be said for the other film versions.

The 1970 version is a joke.  Some smart-aleck screenwriter thought it would be clever to chop the story up into bits, toss them in the air, pick them up randomly and show them to the audience.  All the moving events are thus rendered totally ineffective.  This version is useful only as a lesson in how to ruin a great story.

The 1999 version is only three hours long and has more elaborate sets, some location shooting, and background music, but suffers from poor or inappropriate casting.  Maggie Smith chose to play Aunt Betsy as a straight serious role, depriving the character of the comic touches which make Aunt Betsy such a cherished character.  Bob Hoskins' performance bears no relation to Macawber, thus depriving us of one of the most colorful characters in all literature.  Incredibly, the actor chosen to play Murdstone looks almost identical to Hoskins!  Imelda Staunton portrays Mrs. Macawber very well, and the boy does well enough as young David, but the rest of the cast is lamentable.  And the omission of Traddles is a loss.  The script is hit and miss.  But the most serious problems are the introduction of a narrator who is constantly narrating and keeping the audience at one remove from the events, and the actor who played the grown-up David, who constantly smiled and smirked, sometimes even in the tragic scenes.  He seemed to have no other facial expression.

Bottom line: If you can only afford one version, the 1974 version is your best bet.  Alas.",1158278400,3,3972,4.737991266375546

But with this film, to my surprise, the first time I looked at the time expired, it was already over an hour, and I was happy to stay with it longer.  The film is two hours, and it held my interest from start to finish.

It concisely gave us the story, with all its memorable characters.  There's the mean stepfather Murdstone, loquacious Micawber, the willing Barkis and the Peggoty family, kind Aunt Betsey and her dimwitted Mr. Dick, Steerforth and Traddles, Copperfield's sweethearts silly Dora and wise Agnes, eely Uriah Heep, sweet Emily, and the rest of the wonderful Dickens characters.

It seems odd to me that Australia is seen as the great escape, the land to start fresh, and that all your problems are solved once you board that boat to Down Under.  It seems like a condemnation of Britain, and I don't see why you can assume that things will work out well in Australia.  It seems that you have a whole new movie about the emigrants trying to make a new life there.

When I was a child I read this book and it seemed very heavy, very oppressive.  In the movie, the nastiness involved with Murdstone and Heep went by quickly enough, which I was glad of.

There is a life lesson at the end, an answer to the eternal question ""why are we here?"".  The answer is that it is not good enough to be happy and loving.  We must pass through the fire and become strong.  I suppose there's something to that, though the intensity and type of fire we must pass through varies from one person to another.

This version of David Copperfield gets a thumbs up from me, and is well worth the dollar you have to pay for it at the supermarket.

542336,4,6303048099,"Delbert Mann's TV movie of David Copperfield is unique among film adaptations in that it tells the entire story from a series of flashbacks rather than an ongoing narrative. It works extremely well, adds to the emotional punch of the entire story, further illuminates Dickens' wonderful characters and is aided by a haunting musical score by composer Malcolm Arnold.

It also boasts a pretty fabulous cast including Dame Edith Evans, Susan Hampshire, Richard Attenborough, Ron Moody, Wendy Hiller, Lawrence Olivier and Sir Ralph Richardson; a veritable who's who of the finest British actors of the 20th century! Some have commented that Robin Phillips is bland as the title character. I couldm't disagree more. He is certainly the most cerebral, tortured David in any of the adaptations and also cuts a handsome figure in the movie. In short, he's splendid.

Now to the DVD quality. I certainly agree that it is not good. The colors are a bit washed out, there is some clipped editing and a few moments of nasty film print. That being said, it is far from being unwatchable as some others have suggested. The musical soundtrack comes through fine and the dialogue is clear. And as much as I would welcome a digital restoration of the film, it's TV origins suggest that this would be unlikely.
