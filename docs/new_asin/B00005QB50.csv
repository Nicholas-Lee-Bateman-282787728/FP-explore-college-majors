1648598,5,B00005QB50,"I Loved this video. It has alot of Jackass stunts and things like that. It does have tiny scenes of slight nudity(for both sexes). If you like JACKASS on Mtv you will absolutely love CKY 3.
Also check out CKY, and CKY2K.",1004745600,,220,4.261904761904762

1648600,5,B00005QB50,"Ok, first let me start off with saying that this is definately for the weak of heart. [....]As I was saying this is the raunchiest and nastiest cky to date. You know what, they should of called this the RAAB HIMSELF SHOW. Because he is all over this video, and I'm not going to spoil anything if you haven't already seen it, but he does some NASTY BUT HILARIOUS things in this video. Bam is crazy as usual. Phil Margera is in the video, which is a bonus cause Phil is a cool dad. Brandon is in it, Rake yohn, and all the other Westchester, Pa fools...The only thing I'm dissapointed about is that it is a little short. Its like 45 minutes or something. [....]But anyways, BUY THIS NOW!!! I'M NOT GIVING AWAY ANY SPOILERS. Buy it!!! Buy it now!!!!!!peace...",1000944000,,756,4.368794326241135
1648613,4,B00005QB50,"but still funny, I have Viva La Bam season 1 Uncensored,Haggard, Cky, & then I have the gay cky2k/3 remix, which sucks, because they cut a bunch of stuff out, I bought th first one that wasn't the stupid remix, so I didn't see all of cky3, but in my oppinion its the worst of them all, get them in this order

1. Cky2k

2. Cky4

3. Cky<landspeed>

4. Cky3 ... and beware of the stupid remix of the first 3, buy the real ones while there still avalible.",1107388800,3,452,4.044943820224719
1648614,5,B00005QB50,"I liked this cky better than the second one. There's this hilarious 1-800 collect ""commercial"", more skateboarding, mike vallely beating people up, chris pontius walking around town nude from the waist down, and the ""right here in my arms"" music video from HIM. 5 stars. if you haven't seen this one yet you are missing out.",1078012800,,324,4.803571428571429
1648615,5,B00005QB50,this is the best cky on the box set. i can't say its the best cky movie yet because i havn't seen cky4 yet. this dvd definetly has the best stunts. if u like the shopping cart stunts on jackass u will love this. it has way more and they are way better! it has loads of stunts and some classic mcdonalds drive thrus. if u don't wanna pay all that money for the box set i urge u to buy this dvd. don't get me wrong..cky:landspeed and cky2k are amazing but this one is easily the best.,1053820800,,482,3.9285714285714284
1648616,5,B00005QB50,"Cky3 is awesome and it lives up to cky2k. It is full of pranks and stunts and loads of fun. At the end, Rabb Himself does something that involves 12 laxetives, him wearing nothing but a jock strap and running at full speed while, well.......you can just watch it and see.",1051401600,,271,4.333333333333333
1648617,5,B00005QB50,"Many people seemingly enjoy CKY2K the most out of all the CKY DVDs (as of the time I made this there are 3 (not including the documentary, but 4's coming next week). I, however, don't. Yes, all the CKY DVDs are great, but this is my favorite. I've watched it the most, and it has the best skits and pranks. Some very good music is on this DVD (but there was on previous movies as well, but this probably has the best). Some skits aren't the most entertaining, such as the 1-800-ATT (or Collect, whatever they're making fun of) skit and a few other things. But there are on most, aren't there? Even so, they're not enough to make you turn away from this DVD.
Many people buy this because they're fans of Jackass (like I did), and they find that it is very much like Jackass, and very much not. This is the only CKY video that has Johnny Knoxville in it (and he doesn't even do anything), and while Jackass revolves around insane pranks, this is kind of like a documentary of Bam Margera, Brandon DiCamillo, Rake Yohn, etc., as well as a video with lots of pranks (some less insane than Jackass, some way more) and skits. And skateboarding. I always skip the skateboarding. No, I have nothing aganist skateboarding, but I don't do it myself, so I find my entertainment in other people watching it. But I wouldn't mind watching people falling on while skateboarding...
This DVD features a few of the people from Jackass, as well as others. When I bought this DVD (or the box set, actually, from Amazon.com), I didn't know excactly how many people made up CKY (the movies), or how many, but here's a few:
Bam Margera, Brandon DiCamillo (who I now like to see a lot more in Jackass than before watching CKY), Ryan Dunn, Chris Raab aka Raab Himself, Rake Yohn, The Gill, Art Webb 1986, as well as more.
I highly suggest you but at least one of these DVDs as long as you're a fan of Bam Margera or Brandon DiCamillo or any of the other people from West Chester, PA in Jackass, or if you like the music. If you see this first, then definetly check out CKY, the band. They have one of the most original sounds I've heard, and they're new album (""Infiltrate-Destroy'Rebuild"") hasn't one bad track. So...is this better than Jackass? Why,...",1048118400,2,2229,4.452322738386308
1648618,4,B00005QB50,"Bam and crew are the stars of jackass. Cky 3 has lots of crazy stunts that are hilarious,but just a tad to short. The poop dollar was way to funny. Bam went way over the edge with Phil by peeing on him. He should stick to holes in the lawn. If you own one and two,cky three is a must. Can't wait till four is released!",1045180800,,318,3.8333333333333335
1648619,4,B00005QB50,"It opens up amazingly with a shopping cart scene, but then too much is staged and not enough real pranks. Way too much skateboarding takes up a lot of time we could be laughing at. But beware of the final stunt because it is litteraly sickening, it happens right before the end credits and is pretty funny. Since the label on the laxative bottle says to take 2, Raab Himself takes 12 and RUNS with it if you know what I mean. Well, all of the CkY videos are better than Landspeed, CkY3 isn't as great as the almighty CkY2k! Don-Della-can-noonch!",1038528000,4,545,4.405940594059406
1648620,5,B00005QB50,"...Bam's excellent and if ur a fan of his definitly get it. I don't think anyone should buy the video's seperatly buy he box set its cheaper than buying all four video's seperatly you get CKY1,2,3and the documentary ...Bam is so cute and everyone should buy his movies so he grows richer and richer. Watch out for CKY 4 and Haggard movies and buy them too. Aswell go and look for Ckys albums too. ...The films are brilliant though so buy them!!",1036454400,,444,4.426829268292683
1648621,4,B00005QB50,"CKY3 did have a lot to live up to with the greatness of CKy2K.  I think that it is a good watch and does have its good moments.  However, it is too short and too much is staged.  There are some classic moments like Bam peeing on Phil and general stupid stunts.  I would say buy it, but only if you are sure that you like CKY and you don't want anything 10 times greater than CKy2K coz this isn't it...sorry Bam!",1030838400,5,411,3.975609756097561
1648622,3,B00005QB50,Im a skater so I saw this video prior to the prevous two which Ive seen already in the past. The skate scenes are amazing in this video some Ive seen in other videos but there still good. Some of the skits feel drained and unwelcome like the ending skit with chris raab (that really wasn't needed) but some of the other stuff was good not as good as landspeed but better then 2k. Bam is getting repetitive with his work and needs to stick with skateboarding (I still don't know why hes pro) the jackass movie is gonna be good (trust me I know it will be good). If you want skateboarding stick with baker2g (a simallar video but with ALOT more skateboarding in it) but if you want a mix stay with this. The band cky is ok. But dinosaur jr is better.,1029369600,,748,4.165517241379311
1648623,5,B00005QB50,"Bam, Brandon, Raab, and the rest of the guys are back in the newest movie in the CKY series, CKY3.  In my opinion this one is the best one yet, the jokes are raunchier, crazier and a helluva lot funnier.  Bam and Brandon did a better job at editing this film, yet luckily not enough so that it looses the raw flavor in the first two.  There is also a lot more skating in this one, and from a lot more skaters like Mike Moldonado, Kerry Getz, Arto Saari, Tosh Towsend, Diego Bucchieri, and, of course, Bam.  The film opens up with a great shopping cart section, the best I've seen yet, and then goes into such jokes as throwing dummies in front of moving cars, putting poop on a 100 dollor bill and leaving it for someone to pick up, roller skating through a park naked, peeing on Phil (Bams dad) while he's sleeping, and ending with Raab himself ""taking a [poop] while running at full speed.""  All in all this a great and very hilarious addition to the already great series. I strongly reccomend to anyone that loves that first two entries to pick this one up too.",1028332800,,1064,4.3
1648624,5,B00005QB50,"this is great! this has to be the second best cky (cky2k being the best) but this one is still amazin! its packed with the funniest stuff you'll ever see! bam, bran, ryan, raab, and the other westchester guys are in it and are messin things up for the better! great pranks such as shopping carts, running while pooping, good amount of skating, and an awesome fight scene with mike valley! BUY this video or you'll be missin out! also look for the HAGGARD movie coming soon from bam and the guys!",1024790400,2,495,4.391304347826087
1648625,4,B00005QB50,"CKY 3 is no where near as funny as the second edition to the series.  The first one (in my opinion) was no where near as funny as this one.  This one felt like it was leaning too much towards ""I just wanna gross you out just to gross you out"" and not towards ""I wanna make you laugh so hard you pass out"".  CKY2K is most-definetely the funniest one.  So if you want to see a video that makes you laugh so hard you pass out buy CKY2K if you wanna a video thats more adult and grosser buy CKY 3.",1021248000,,493,3.803921568627451
1648626,1,B00005QB50,"THIS VIDEO [stunk]!!!!! the other 2 CKY videos are amazing and the second one is the best but this 3rd one is terrible compared to them! It's all short and scripted and it's nowhere near as funny as the other 2! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME! Hope this helped, peace.",1017619200,,258,4.285714285714286
1648627,5,B00005QB50,"This video is really really funny! Raab Himself gets a little bit crazy, but it is halarious. It seems to me like, Raab Himself tried acting like Bam a little more than he should have. I don't like the length of the video it is like, half of CKY2K, which is my personal favorite movie. It seems like the guys used actual movie film, which i didn't like. All around, this movie is halarious. But if you want a movie like the show JACK..., you need to get CKY2K. But CKY 3 is really funny. I have all three of the CKY's. 2K is the best. But you should get number three first. If you think that is funny, you will be blown away by CKY, and CKY2K. Thanx BAM ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1017100800,,679,4.190839694656488
1648628,3,B00005QB50,"First off, all three video's are extremely hilarious.  But I have to say I was a little disappointed by this one.  cKy 1 is full of raw, unedited, FUNNY stuff.  Cky2k is also hilarious, they go to Iceland and some funny stuff goes down over there.  In Cky 3 there is a lot more scripted, edited stuff.  Chris Raab seems so desperate to be like Bam that he literally will do anything for the film.  Which gets a little out of hand...  So I would say if you are a first time cKy viewer, stick to cky 1 or 2, but if you are a fan looking for more fun times with the cKy boys then no worries, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",1010102400,,614,3.9430894308943087
1648629,4,B00005QB50,"I have been a fan of CKY since Landspeed (#1) came out.  I also skateboard so i enjoy the film more than some.  This one for the most part, is funny and disturbing like the Landspeed and 2K, But I felt like it was a little different than the others.  Yes it was filmed in actual movie film but that's not it.  I think the movie was just too short (about 48 minutes) and was just a little more made for the poser type.  (...) I think Bam has gone a little poser himself.  I think he sold out and made a stupid show to make money.  CKY 3 isn't a waste of time, but it lacks that certain edge that the other two had.  It seems as though he just made it to get more money and do the almost the same thing over again.  I'm not saying it's not funny, i mean it's very funny, but it just seemed strange to me.

1648630,4,B00005QB50,"Hey, IF You Love MTV JACKASS, then you are way to unoriginal to even wiatch this movie. It's got lots of stunts and Bam antics but it's beginning to loose it's rebelious appeal.
