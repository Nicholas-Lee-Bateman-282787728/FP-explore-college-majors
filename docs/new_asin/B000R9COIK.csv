2862856,5,B000R9COIK,"Long before the advent of the 24 hour news cycle and the endless barrage of talking heads and ""breaking news"", American television in the 1950's and the early 1960's was not usually a major source of news.  The main news business was in newspapers in 1963 at the time of the Kennedy Assassination.  But television became a major player in the unfolding tragedy of the ""Four Days"" that began Nov. 22, 1963.

This hour-long disc offers highlights of videotaped ABC News coverage on Friday, Nov. 22 (this disc only covers Friday) including interviews with eyewitnesses Abraham Zapruder and Bill Newman.  It is possible to catch the mood and tone of the moment in viewing this material as the ABC network scrambles to provide full coverage.

CBS network coverage from Nov. 22, 1963 and NBC network coverage was also preserved on tape.  The CBS coverage taped actually starts at 12:30 p.m. at the start of ""As the World Turns"" (aired live), several minutes before the first voice-over flash from Walter Cronkite.  The CBS and NBC material is not commercially available.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JFK-Breaking-the-News/dp/0963910361/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JFK: Breaking the News</a>",1182988800,14,1229,5.610810810810811
8199744,5,B000R9COIK,"This is a virtual moment by moment account of President Kennedy's fatal visit to Dallas through the medium of television from the  ABC Network as 'Father Knows Best' was interrupted with a news bulletin of the shooting. From there is another bulletin and untrue rumors of what has happened and what is going on.

Soon reporters appear repeating information from the telephone and then they have access to video footage at the hospital. Eyewitnesses are brought into the news studio including Abe Zapruder.

Then reports from NYC and Washington. People's opinions are asked and even Eisenhower's thoughts are mentioned.

Shows Air Force One returning to Washington to D.C. and Johnson speaks. Insights into the events of the actual day, as close to the original source as possible.",1493942400,,780,5.118110236220472
8199745,5,B000R9COIK,"Has some different info from other videos, like all Kennedy assassination videos not long enough..some things are always left out and some things are different on all the tapes, I have most of them and this is pretty good.  Would recommned for anyones collections.",1491264000,,264,5.0
8199746,5,B000R9COIK,Good first account viewing of the moments right after the events in Dealey Plaza took place and a murder of a beloved president took our country's innocence away forever! Well done!,1417132800,,181,4.870967741935484
8199747,4,B000R9COIK,ABC seemed to have the best coverage of any of the networks at the time. Too bad the DVD was only slightly more than one hour.,1403222400,,126,3.8846153846153846
8199748,5,B000R9COIK,In my opinion this is an excellent collection of the footage and reporting of this earth-shaking event. I had just been accepted into the Peace Corps in November 1963 so I was in South America when JFK was buried and could not see any of this TV news reporting in 1963 as it happened but was so pleased to be able to see it all now.  It is historic and well presented.,1385510400,,368,4.111111111111111
8199749,5,B000R9COIK,"I got this at Amazon and I'm really, really shocked at people complaining about the ""tape"" quality. How old are you? What do you think taped film was like in those days? I still remember rabbit ears and having to change the channel with a pair of pliers. There were no digital recordings on hard drives in those days. Films rolled when you went from one scene to another. Satellite feed was not as instantaneous as it is today. Sometimes during telecast it would lose tracking...this is how your grandparents watched television.

With today's technology, would it have been nice if some of the audio quality were cleaned up a bit? Yes. But even occaional poor audio quality is a lesson of the time period.

Watching the ABC Network coverage was fascinating, but even more fascinating was the coverage at WFAA in Dallas, where news of the assasination first broke. Especially notable is WFFA's Jay Watson interviewing Abraham Zapruder who recorded the now famous Zapruder film of Kennedy being fatally shot.

The Majority of the DVD has audio that is just fine...including a very shocked expression of either ""Oh God"" or ""Oh no"" in the background as Ron Cochran announced the death of President Kennedy. It's only two on the street interviews that are not very clear and difficult to understand. I would have no problem showing this to a classroom of kids and explaining to them what television was like in those days. If you have a problem with it, I would recommend the History Channel's JFK: 3 Shots that Changed America, also sold by Amazon. It has cleaned up audio and video and patches together the different network feeds from that point in history.",1328572800,6,1655,4.77972027972028
8199750,2,B000R9COIK,"I tried to use this video for a high school government class. The quality was poor, grainy. The video was all over the place, could not keep a student's atention.",1260921600,,162,4.433333333333334
8199751,4,B000R9COIK,i  thought  this  was  a  very  good  fascinating  dvd  on  president  kennedys murder.i  didn t  give it  a  5  star  rating  because  i  felt the  dvd  was  to  short. i  felt  there  should  have  been  another hour  on  the  dvd. there  isn't any  footage  of  oswald  on the  dvd. there  is plenty  of  oswald  footage available.  especialy  the  oswald  midnight  news  conferance  footage.  which  was  taken  from several  directions. other  than  that  a  very  good  dvd.,1225324800,,481,4.5394736842105265
8199752,5,B000R9COIK,ABC News should be commended for producing this DVD on one of the most tragic days in American history. It begins with a few seconds of a Father Knows Best episode and then a bulletin of the shooting of President Kennedy. For the next hour viewers will relive the terrible news of the death of the President to the arrival of the body and the brief statement by the new President Lyndon B. Johnson. During this DVD be sure and look for Jules Bergman who was one of the best correspondents that covered the space liftoffs. If you have seen the Apollo XIII movie you may have seen his reports on the crisis in space in 1970. The ABC News DVD is a five star production but only one thing...I really wish an extra hour was extended to cover more of this story.,1194048000,7,756,4.293706293706293
8199753,4,B000R9COIK,"Thanks to ABC News, we now have an opportunity to see portions of the network's original live coverage during the afternoon of President John F. Kennedy's assassination. This of course, is the same footage offered on I-Tunes' ""ABC NEWS - THE DAY IT HAPPENED"" series for viewing on one's I-Pod. The coverage, taken from the videotapes of WABC-TV in New York, begins with a few seconds of the sitcom ""Father Knows Best"" when sudenly the ABC Bulletin slide appears with Ed Silverman reading wire copy as a voice-over. Later, as Ron Cochran begins his on-camera reporting, you can see staffers quickly assembling some kind of background set even as Cochran continues talking. We hear from Bob Clark on the phone from Parkland Hospital in Dallas, and also see live pictures from the Trade Mart (courtesy of CBS Affiliate KRLD-TV which was providing a pool feed.
ABC in fact, through its own affiliate WFAA-TV, had the first eyewitness descriptions of the assassination within minutes of the shooting. You also see the only television interview given at the time by Abraham Zapruder, whose film of the assassination would not be broadcast nationally for another twelve years. This, plus on the scene Dallas films shot by WFAA cameramen, make this a precious piece of history to own.
For those interested in the history of the 1960s, or of broadcasting in general, I highly recommend this DVD.",1187136000,23,1386,4.952789699570816
