8413055,5,B0041MXULE,"This documentary (almost 2 hours long) was produced by DW (Deutsche Welle) and provides much insight into the Die Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen, Paavo Jrvi as well as the symphonies by Beethoven.  In-depth interviews with Jrvi as well as several members of the orchestra.  Cities of Bremen and Talinn are heavily featured.  The documentary can be played in German or English.  Highly recommended.

There is also a 4-DVD set that pairs this documentary with the complete performances of the Beethoven symphonies, by the same conductor and orchestra:
