255954,5,6300209830,"What a trully fantastic little movie this is, a real SPFX shocker in its day, and a great story with some fantastic character acting. TV in the UK used to show this a lot in the 1980's but it has been missing for a few years, and it is one of my faves, so now thanks to the team at Criterion I can own this peice of trully bizarre sci-fi cinema history.  The extras are great and the commentary is very informative, also there is an essay a sort of potted history of UK sci-fi movies from this era.  The transfer is crisp apart from a few scratches on the stock film used, particularly the old plane shots and the radar base, but this is mere trifle compared to the overall mastery involved in the plot and effects, which are for the time pretty incredible to say the least.  If you want any more proof of sci-fi from the golden age being intelligent, thought provoking and damn right scary then go and buy this movie, and be very very impressed....",988070400,18,949,4.261111111111111
255955,2,6300209830,"I had never heard of this film and seeing it as an adult mayhave taken away some of the fun of it but I fail to see the fuss orthe reason that Criterion spent their time on this. It is a standard50's B film with good acting but the story moves very slow and issilly without any fun or campiness. As for the ""specialeffects"", they consist of what looks like plastic brains onspinal cords photographed in stop motion. On the plus side, thetransfer is crisp and the sound is great. Extra features include aninteresting commentary from the executive producer and a gallery oflobby cards and ads. Criterion does their standard quality jobhere....  Only for die hard fans only, I'm afraid.  END",986428800,7,688,4.677685950413223
255956,4,6300209830,"What really gets me about Fiend without a Face is the sound.  The sound of the titular fiends sucking out the brains and spinal cords of their victims is delightfully disgusting.  The picture quality is not quite up to the standard of The Blob, but you know Criterion did the best they could. Someone else mentioned The Haunting.  I'd like to add to my Criterion Wish List another seminal, overlooked, and long out-of-print on VHS classic, I Married a Monster from Outer Space.",985996800,,477,4.72289156626506
255957,5,6300209830,This movie caused severe damage to me as a child. I had nightmares for days afterwards; I still have some residual terror because of it. Thanks to Criterion Collection I'm able to relive all that trauma. The film is fast paced and well made. The fiends are brains with attached spinal cords. They leap onto people and choke them within a few seconds. They are fast and many. There seems to be no escaping them and no way to stop them. And of course they mutiply and grow oh so fast. The black and white picture is crisp and clear; sound quality is excellent. There are many extras including some campy movie trailers from the same era/genre; there is commentary from from film' producer and genre film historian Bruce Eder. Thanks Criterion. You've done it again.,985478400,6,763,4.617647058823529
255958,5,6300209830,"This starts as a solid little b-movie programmer, with crisp direction, plotting and acting (especially by the fine Marshall Thompson), and ends with one of the most shocking special FX sequences in horror-film history. This stop-motion animation sequence, involving a gruesome fight between crawling brains and humans must be seen to be believed. Anyone who ever saw this film as a child may be permanently scarred, and all adults interested in horror sci-fi cinema should see it as well. Essential!",983836800,5,500,5.2625
255959,4,6300209830,"Is there ANY fan of science fiction or horror movies who grew up in the 60's and *doesn't* remember this midnight snack? The odd thing to me is that someone at Criterion seems to have the same taste in odd genre movies from the 50's as I do - and anyone ensuring that movies like this, and even more especially ""Carnival of Souls"", deserves a round of applause. (Let's face it, this movie used to be found in the ""Drive In Flicks"" section of the rental places if they even HAD it.)
The video quality is as good as we can expect. It is certainly sharper and brighter than other recent presentations of the film, but unfortunately, there ARE sequences where the scratches and wear obviously could not be spirited away digitally. I sincerely doubt that any fan of the movie will mind; this isn't Bergman or Fellini we're talking about! (In the opening scene, an Air Force office is suggesting to his fellow officer that perhaps ""sleep would be better than all the benzedrine you're taking."" The other fellow proceeds to slam down another few bennies....only in the movies, folks!)
The extras include trailers from several other movies produced by Gordon, stills, production notes, and a full-length commentary by  Gordon (executive producer) with Bruce Eder. There's a LOT of discussion about American actors in England, aiming for the American market, working with the German special effects duo, and even some very interesting background on the original ""Weird Tales"" story that was the basis for the film. Unfortunately, this is less a ""commentary"" than an interview - the discussion between the two is interesting, but almost NEVER has anything to do with what is happening in the movie, and frankly I can't recommend trying to watch the flick while listening to this track. This is quite a bit different from ANY other ""commentary"" I've come across, and I thought it really needed to be mentioned.
Once again, Criterion has set a gold standard for quality and value in a release. Oh, HOW I wish they could release Wise's ""The  Haunting""....",983836800,45,2042,4.831428571428572
255960,4,6300209830,"Director Arthur Crabtree's FIEND WITHOUT A FACE is a real cult movie that has just entered the Criterion collection. As to THE CARNIVAL OF SOULS, a few weeks ago, Criterion does justice once again to a cinema that, for most of us, was the only interesting cinema in our teen days. How many of us have been introduced to movies thanks to such films as Terence Fisher's HORROR OF DRACULA, Fred Mc Leod Wilcox's FORBIDDEN PLANET or precisely FIEND WITHOUT A FACE ? Of course, a few years later, we discovered that cinema was also a thinking person's occupation and enjoyed Fellini, Godard and John Ford. But I still keep in my heart a guilty predilection for this B cinema often produced with peanuts but always hiding unvaluable pearls for the movie lover.
The actors playing in FIEND WITHOUT A FACE are excellent considering the text they have to tell and the tremendous resemblance between the leading character Marshall Thompson and Glenn Ford adds to our pleasure. Furthermore , cinematography, editing and special effects are really above-average for this kind of production.
The copy is gorgeous and the commentary of the producer of THE FIEND WITHOUT A FACE a source of countless accurate informations for someone interested in movie production. An essay about science-fiction in movies, dozens of posters and five trailers of very rare B-movies (at least, for an european viewer) complete this Criterion DVD presentation.

255961,4,6300209830,"This is an excellent movie for anyone who's a fan of movies such as ""Night of the Living Dead"".  Released about 10 years earlier and a product of the British sci-fi/horror period of the late 50's, the special effects are excellent for its time.  Kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and had a very interesting (albeit rather unrealistic) plot.  The ending was perhaps one of the best parts of the film, so it's definitely not a letdown, and at 74 minutes of length, the movie definitely does not drag.  Some nice death scenes in this one too, and the acting is actually decent.  If you're a fan of this genre, this is DEFINITELY worth owning.  Criterion really packs in the special features too, as usual.  Digitally remastered - picture and sound quality are outstanding given the age of the film.",981331200,11,814,4.496598639455782

It's fun to watch the brains get shot, bleed, and make the farting noises as they die. Think of the sound you hear when a bottle of ketchup reaches the end. Sorry if these were spoilers, but i have  hunch the people who most want this movie aren't those who are new to it, but people who saw it on TV years ago, and have dying to see it again ever since, like me.",1486339200,,664,4.1875

Not only did the movie have a decent story and script, (decent, but not great), which in itself, was unusual for a B horror movie, it had terrific stop-motion special effects that brought the ""fiends"" to life.  from Wikipedia: ""...the film an ""X"" certificate, but newspaper critics were still aghast at its horrifying special effects.""

But what makes this movie (are you paying attention The Asylum and Syfy channel?) is the earnestness with which the production company and cast brings this movie to life. We never see the monsters until near the end, but the sound effects used in bringing them to life, the crawling and slurping when they feed on their victims, is absolutely great. This is one of what I call the Marshall Thompson 50's trilogy of SF Films. He was also in It! The Terror From Beyond Space (great) and First Man Into Space (also tremendous!). They simply don't make films with heart like this today. The leads, Marshall Thompson as a USAF officer attempting to use atomic energy to increase radar so that the US and Canada can keep an eye on those nasty commies, is great. Kim Parker, who I never saw again, is excellent as the beautiful woman he becomes involved with and finally, Kynaston Reeves as the scientist whose experiment goes horribly wrong (don't they all?) is great as the reason behind the fiends. Finally we have the brought to life by stop motion animation, fiends. Literally brains with spines and antennae, they leap and crawl and murder humans for their brains, slurping them out like someone having an ice cream soda and wanting every drop.

The first two acts can be a little dry, but those seasoned in these films can enjoy the very cheap sets, the blaring overwrought music, and the radar room where said radar is somehow broadcasting from the middle of the Atlantic ocean when the building itself is in Canada.

But then you get to the climax (spoilers ahead, if you indeed *can* spoil a 60yr old movie...), and holy cow do you see why people remember this movie.  Its dozens of stop motion brains, with little antenna and spinal cord tails cheesily LEAPING at people and trying to strangle them.  Then they get shot or hacked to death with an axe and go ""Fuhpuhpuhpuhpuhpuhpuhpup"" while spurting blood that looks like jelly.  And unlike most one-minute-or-less climaxes for these types of films, this keeps on happening over and over again for minutes at a time til the hero blows up a nuclear power plant with dynamite (always a good idea) to stop the brains.

As I said before, its not the most awesome bad movie ever made, nor even the most awesome brain movie, but ""Fiend Without A Face"" is tons of fun for any genre lover or drive in fan.

Certainly, there was no other film like it. I really wonder what sort of attitude the filmmakers had when this was being made. Were they giggling fiendishly, thinking of all the people they would scare with these images? (Scaring people was obviously their plan.) Did they think the movie they were making was ""cool""?

The action-packed climax is pretty much the last fifteen minutes of the film. The brain creatures attack the people in the house, and pretty soon, bullets are flying, axes are being swung, and brains are being sucked. In my mind, this completely, mind-blowingly over-the-top ending scene seemed to go on forever, like a seriously bad nightmare. It was so repellently real. The creatures have no eyes, and they sort of ""sense"" your presence electrically to zero in on you, before flying up at you and clamping themselves onto the back of your neck. The depiction of this was pretty effective, and it still surprises me how well thought-out the creature imagery was here. Surprisingly realistic.

OK, that's really, really the hokiest ""read science"" thing to come out of the 1950's.  But once the critters become visible - wow. The coolest stop animation.

Well, The Blob was made in the same year, and it surpasses this film in every way. (It really does deserve a Criterion release.) Forbidden Planet was made 2 years earlier, based on a similar idea, and Fiend hardly deserves to show in the same theater as that great film.

256320,4,6300209830,"Not many horror films of the 1950s could credibly combine as many disparate elements of the macabre as did FIEND WITHOUT A FACE.  Director Arthur Crabtree took a fear of the atom, and liberally mixed it with monsters from the ID, stop action filming, decent acting and scripting, and even included romance between the well-known B actor Marshal Thompson and the less well known Kim Parker.  The result is a smooth meshing film that grabs your attention from the start.  For most of the film, we do not see the monster, though we can hear its breathing and slithering on the floor.  The black and white graininess of the film adds to the spookiness.  A telikenetic researcher allies the power of his brain to the nearly unlimited power of the atom to create a race of vicious crawling brain suckers that depend on a non stop delivery of atomic radiation for their survival.  Now if this sounds a little like a later version of FORBIDDEN PLANET, then director Crabtree still manages to invest his FIEND with its own original flavor.  These fiends crawl about on spindly tentacles, usually invisible, then launch themselves at their hapless victims.  There is a ghastly scene toward the end where Thompson, Parker and others barricade themselves within a room in a manner that reminds one of a combined NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and THE BIRDS.

256383,4,6300209830,"I gotta figure doing PR for the gooberment's atomic energy program in the 1950s must have been one hell of an uphill battle as it seemed every other horror or science fiction thriller released in the day involved something either getting embiggened, shrunken, or just plain mutated and messed up in general, as depicted in this classic British made feature Fiend without a Face (1958), due to radiation derived from our relatively new found ability to smash them atoms.  Directed by Arthur Crabtree (Horrors of the Black Museum), the film stars Marshall Thompson (It! The Terror from Beyond Space, First Man Into Space, ""Daktari""), Kynaston Reeves (RX for Murder), and Kim Parker (Fire Maidens from Outer Space).  Also appearing is Terry Kilburn (Swiss Family Robinson), Peter Madden (Dr. Terror's House of Horrors), and Stanley Maxted (Strange Awakening).

As the film begins we're at a U.S. Air Force base in Canada and we see a lone guard at night on the perimeter.  After hearing some strange noises from the nearby woods followed by a blood curdling scream, the guard investigates and finds a corpse of a local man with a terror-stricken expression on his face.  Major Jeff Cummings (Thompson) wants an autopsy performed on the deceased, but the man's sister, Barbara Griselle (Parker), is unwilling which causes problems as the local population isn't too keen on having an atomic powered military instillation in the area (there's quite a bit of fear about radiation).  If that wasn't enough, there's also an issue with the experiments being performed at the base, those involving boosting radar capacity (to spy on those evil Reds) through the use of atomic energy in that every time they juice things up, there's a mysterious power drain...hmmm...anyway, after a couple more deaths, the rubes get even more antsy, and an autopsy reveals the victims perished as a result of being de-brained, i.e. having their brains sucked out of their heads.  Eventually Jeff's investigation leads him to a reclusive, eccentric scientist in the area, one Barbara works for named Professor Walgate (Reeves), who's an authority on psychic phenomena with his current research involving thought materialization.  Turns out the professor is involved with not only the bizarre deaths but also the mysterious power fades at the base's reactor, eventually spilling the beans and warning those in charge they must shut down the atomic plant immediately, as he's accidentally unleashed an invisible menace straight from a nightmare, one that feeds on atomic energy and apparently gray matter, and also has the ability to multiply and become more intelligent...crikey!  Soon the town and the base are under siege, threatening not only the lives of everyone in the area, but also Jeff's chances to pitch woo at Barbara...

I enjoyed this film a lot as it has a tight story and wastes little time on extraneous material (the film runs about 74 minutes).  One aspect of the story I really liked was how the creatures weren't actually a direct result of radiation, but more so a nasty by product of someone using atomic energy within his own fantastic experiments...it might sound like I'm splitting hairs here, but to better understand what I mean you really need to see the movie.  We don't actually get to see the creatures until about an hour in, but when we do, it's worth the wait.  I won't go too much into what they actually were or look like, but they're pretty hideous along with being very agile.  The characters are fairly cut and dry, as are the performances.  I thought most all the actors did well, and Marshall Thompson, who's got about the biggest forehead I've ever seen, seemed a suitable choice for the lead along with the beautiful Kim Parker, who left the biz not too long after the release of this film.  I was kind of annoyed with the character of Professor Walgate, the guy ultimately responsible for the `ghastly business'...first off he steals power from the atomic reactor and subsequently screws up their experiments, then he creates something which escapes his control, ends up killing a whole mess of people and allows the blame to be directed elsewhere, and finally he himself nearly kills someone (inadvertently, so he later claims) who gets too close to his secret...once the beans are spilt, through an extensive expository sequence, he does seem to show remorse for his actions, but it seems like the remorse of someone who's only remorseful after being caught.  Nice guy, huh?  I suppose one could argue he eventually paid the price for his folly into the unknown, but for me his penalty was hardly equal to that which he wrought...my favorite scene in the film comes near the end, as a small group fortify themselves in the professor's home against an onslaught of creatures, one of those among the group the deputy mayor, who has a most excellent freak out one the creatures manage to get in...there was one aspect of the story that felt really screwy...near the end it's decided the only way to stop the horror is to shut down the atomic reactor.  The problem I had was the method in which they decided to do so, which involved using high explosives.  Now I'm no expert in atomic sciences, but it seemed to me they were taking a mighty big chance in doing what they did...if something like that was tried in real life I'd expect catastrophic results (does anyone remember a little thing called Chernobyl?).  Ah well, the 1950s were a much simpler time in that things were generally more cut and dry, or so I'm assuming since I wasn't even alive back then.  All in all this is a fun, better than average 1950s sci-fi horror flick, one that I'm glad I own and watch on a fairly regular basis.

This fully restored and remastered Criterion Collection DVD release of Fiend Without a Face features a very clean and sharp widescreen (1.66:1) transfer, one that exhibits the occasional minor flaw.  The Dolby Digital mono audio comes through very well, with no complaints.  There's a slew of extras including an audio commentary track with an informative interview between executive producer Richard Gordon and writer Tom Weaver, along with an illustrated essay on British science fiction and horror by film historian Bruce Eder, still photographs w/commentary, vintage advertisements and lobby cards, liner notes by Bruce Kerwin, and English subtitles.  Also included are theatrical trailers for this film, along with others for The Haunted Strangler (1958), Corridors of Blood (1958), First Man into Space (1959), and The Atomic Submarine (1959).

256385,4,6300209830,"Although it has been decades since I first saw ""Fiend Without A Face"",some of the film`s grotesque imagry still remains with me. This film is your typical ""B"" movie(sci-fi/horror genre) of the 50`s/60`s...complete with stilted dialog and generic characters. Actually a fairly well-made ""B"" movie that puts a nice twist on the tired ""man-made or mutated nuclear moster"" theme. ""Fiend"" has an interesting story and some very graphic effects,that can still hold their own. NOTE:See the other reviews for the plot/story outline,please. :) The stop motion photography of the animated brain/spinal cord creatures ambulating like inch worms and leaping onto the necks and heads of their victims is way over the top! The use of a hideous slurpping/sucking sound effect for the feeding Fiends is downright nasty! Adding to the surrealism of the Brain & Spine munching Fiends(they`re little more than mobile human brains themselves),are the TERRIBLE screams and moans of sheer agony that come from the victims while they are fed upon.  One scene,especially,is haunting. One fellow trys to outrun the things and is overrun  by 4-6 hungry brains,all of them greedily jostling for position on his head,neck,and shoulders. Quite vivid. In summary: Not the best ""B"" film made,but certainly one of the most unusual and most haunting. I`d like to see John Carpenter or maybe David Cronenberg remake this film sometime. Anyone else and it would become another cheesy moster gore-fest. Thanks for reading my review.",1139616000,4,1496,5.281512605042017
256386,4,6300209830,"How fondly I remember that movie. Badmovies.org has a wonderful synopsis of it, along with some rather humorous dialog audio files (my favorite being ""Where has the brain and spinal cord gone?""), and a must-read Stuff to Watch For section. Yes, the special effects are primitive, and continuity errors abound, but the macabre, stop motion animation brain and spinal cord monsters, going around sucking out the brains and spinal cords of their victims, are definitely the stuff nightmares are made of. The sucking sounds alone are quite unsettling, and also pay particular attention to the 1950's approach to nuclear power, especially how to turn it off when not needed anymore. My, I never knew it was that easy and safe. The movie also displays a sense of gore (the brainy monsters getting shot up into raspberry jam) that is unusual for a 1950's horror film.

The Criterion Collection disk also has a good ephemera section, and the commentary is a welcome addition to the film.",1133827200,,979,4.933333333333334

This one, which is rather low budget, is really scary and mysterious.  It starts out with an invisible creature, which is attacking people and seems impossible to understand - at one point, it cuts a tiny hole in a screen to enter a home.  What could it be, one wonders?  But all one can do is hear the sound of its movement, then witness the destruction of those attacked.  THere some genuinely frightening scenes, like one I remember scared us so bad we shut it off:  a guy is attacked and survives, but wanders into a meeting disfigured and moaning.

While I found the explanation a bit disappointing, it is well done nonetheless, adding to our early mythology about radioaction-powered devices.

The brass is taking heat for the murders and puts dashing Major Cummings in charge of the investigation, ultimately leading him straight into the arms of Barbara, an attractive research assistant. It turns out that Barbara's boss, the semi-maniacal Professor Walgate was involved in ""thought materialization"" experiments designed to free thought completely from consciousness (gives freedom of thought a whole new meaning!). In order to accomplish this task, large amounts of power are needed, alas the tie-in to the military airbase. With this power, Professor Walgate began to ""devise a being into which the thought once realized could enter and preserve itself for all humanity"" - or at least in order to kill all humanity! Unfortunately, Walgate's success unwittingly unleashes a ""fiend"" or ""mental vampire"" that feeds off the nervous centers of those it kills.

So what happens? Invisible fiends attack citizens of a small town. The bodies are found missing their brain and spinal cord. What creatures could do such a thing! Whos responsible, dammit!

256431,4,6300209830,"Forget the title, ""Fiend Without a Face"" is the one with the brain monsters.  That is all you have to tell people for them to go, ""Oh, yes!  That movie!  I remember that movie!""  This 1958 British horror film might not be beloved, but is certainly memorable because of the stop-motion animation that is used to have the monster, which look like big brains with horns and a spinal chord tail that they use to move around and strangle their victims (these must have been partially responsible for inspiring the face-huggers from the ""Alien"" series).  This is also one of the goriest films of that decade, which was probably a way of covering up for the fact that you had actors screaming and writhing in pain with a big fake brain monster taped to their heads sucking out their brains.
Our tale is set at an American military base in Canada (interesting to see a British film play about American-Canadian tensions like this).  The locals start dropping dead, screaming in horror, and the thinking is that it has to have something to do with the base, maybe that ""atomic radar"" thing they are working on, but probably just some sort of psychotic American G.I. (and this years before Vietnam, please note).  But Major Jeff Cummings (Marshall Thompson), second in command at the base, has his suspicions about Professor Walgate (Kynaston Reeves), a retired expert in psychic phenomenon.  But a visit to the Professor's house reveals one of those great experiments gone horribly wrong that we so often find at the heart of films like this one.
The title ""Fiend Without a Face"" comes because for most of the movie the monsters are invisible (Steven Spielberg used this same approach with more success in ""Jaws"" and in both cases the rationale was more special effects problems that artistic sensibilities).  I am not arguing this is a great horror film, but for a B-movie it does try to deliver for the final act.  Yes, the killer mutant brains being invisible is problematic (a polite way of saying stupid, boys and girls), but there is something inherently appealing about the little killers once they pop up and starting hopping around in their cute little feeding frenzy.  You can also have fun trying to figure out what there are more of in this film: horror movie clichs or killer brains (okay, clichs is the correct answer, but have fun counting both anyhow).",1036108800,16,2359,4.757352941176471
256432,3,6300209830,"Fiend Without a Face was made in the 50s when the threat of nuclear war was high and the fear of radio activity peaked.  This 50s B-movie played on these fears as pseudo-science and CNS-vampires could strike fear in an audience.  Presently, Fiend Without a Face can be seen as a feeble attempt to give the audience a shaky yawn.

256433,3,6300209830,"Fun little 1958 shocker, whose greatest virtue is memorable special effects and a mercifully short running time.
A U.S. air base in Canada is suffering power shortages and radar malfunctions, and commander Marshall Thompson wants to know why.  The local populace are getting testy, since some of their number are suddenly losing their lives in an especially gruesome and inexplicable manner  -  their brains appear to have been sucked right out of their bodies.  A bit of skulking detective work reveals the cause to be a local scientist, whose experiments in thought-projection have unexpectedly created an invisible monster  -  one that propagates itself by devouring human brains and spinal columns.
The special effects for the monsters are great fun, once they're made visible  -  they're brains with antennae, attached to spinal columns whose nerve endings serve as legs, moving them along in a humping motion like inchworms.  The little beasties wrap themselves around their victims' throats, puncture the base of their skulls, and...well, it's pretty nasty.
The finale is terrific, with a besieged houseful of people fighting the horrible things off, and there's a creepy scene with a surviving victim whose I.Q. has drastically dropped and whose face has partly caved-in.  It's a fairly dull plod getting to the great climactic battle, but worth the wait.",1020816000,6,1363,5.268518518518518
256434,2,6300209830,"I really wanted to like this movie more than I did. I mean,how could a film about vampire brains not be good?Heh Heh.
Seriously though,I usually like movies like this but there just isn't enough here to recommend it. You don't get to see the creatures until the last ten minutes of the movie and even then they are very poorly animated. Theres just no excuse for that when you consider that they are nothing more than a brain with the spinal-cord attached. I suspect thats why the film makers choose to make the monsters invisible for the first hour of the movie.
As far as the acting is concerned,Marshall Thompson is his usual likable self and Kim Parker does a fine job playing the part of his love interest. The Professor though(I won't embarass him by mentioning his name)wallows in ineptitude like a pig in mud. I sat there half expecting him to wander off the set in confusion.
There are a few things to like about this movie. For one,the romance between the two stars of the picture is well developed and didn't feel thrown in at the last minute like it usually does in 50's sci-fi films. The ending isn't too bad either. It just isn't enough of a pay-off to justify sitting through the rest of the movie.

This film, which I first saw when I was about 8 (back when they actually had things like triple-features in theatres), is just about the creepiest thing I've seen TO DATE. I'm not talking gore here (which it has in abundance and works great in B&W): I'm talking 'nightmare quality' story and cinematography. I saw this available in Criterion format and knew it was time to buy.
Now you might think I'm squemish, going all sissy over a 50's B&W British horror film - almost a misnomer in and of itself!
But I'm here to tell you I found and continue to find this film more chilling than 'Dawn of the Dead', 'Maniac', 'The Thing' (both versions) or any Lucio Fulci gorefest. Why?
Everything was just right, from the stop-motion of the brains slithering across the lab floor to the diharettic sounds of blood burping from thier perforated corpses. Eeeeesh. I get chills just thinking about it.

256436,5,6300209830,"Here's a 50's creature feature that still packs an effective punch. It's one of my favorite creature features of the era and holds up surprisingly well.  This independently produced British film , picked up by MGM in 1958,  follows a now overly familiar formula but is more consistently paced than most films of its genre and era, and delivers a once extremely (and still pretty) gory ending-an ending which surely was part of the inspiration for scenes in George Romero's Night of the Living Dead a full decade later.
This was a film that gave me childhood nightmares after I first watched it one Saturday night on Chiller Theater in the early 60's. I didn't realize then, that this little low-budget film from the 50's was considered one of the best of the 50's british sci-fi's and compares to the best of the Quartermas films and easily out gores them.  The Quartermas films (which were re-makes of the British t.v. series)  starred Brian Donleavy and gave the fledgling Hammer Films its first taste of success.  Hammer would later abandon science fiction for gothic horror and even greater success.  Other independent British film-makers meanwhile were producing science fiction and horror films.  Several were copy-cats of American films.  The American, 'Beast from 20,000 Fathoms' was turned into the British film, 'The Giant Behemoth' a few years later.  Giant Ants thrilled Americans in the classic  THEM !, so why not use that idea in a low budget British film called 'The Cosmic Monsters' (with F. Troops Forest Tucker).  Just as a flood of low budget horror films produced by AIP, Corman, Bert I Gordon (no relation) and others were being made, producer Richard Gordon was able to make a few films with Boris Karloff.  First he made The Haunted Strangler and later he would make Corridors of Blood.  He would then make a couple films with another American actor named Marshall Thompson.  Thompson had appeared in several films including IT! The Terror from Beyond Space a low budget sci-fi creature feature which wound up being a major inspiration for Alien.  Producer Gordon would make Fiend Without A Face and later First Man Into Space with Thompson.
The script for Fiend .... is by Herbert J. Leder and is based on Amelia Reynolds Long's story The Thought Monster, published in the famed pulp horror magazine WEIRD TALES way back in 1930.
Fiend Without A Face was produced by the British Richard Gordon, filmed mostly in England,  set in Canada (close to the American Border), starred an American actor (Marshal Thompson), and wound up being distributed by MGM .
I won't spoil the film except to tell you the finale is a rather gory, gross-out which still packs a bit of a punch after all these years.  The romantic aspects of the film are down-played and there is a wonderful subtext throughout the film for those who need a little more substance to savor.
There is a very familiar scene  in the film where windows are boarded up against an onslaught of the crawling, leaping, flying creatures.  You'll know exactly where George Romero got the idea for several of his most effective shots in Night of the Living Dead.
The finale' remains an impressive blend of effective camera work and revolting sound effects. Obviously the stop motion animation effects are quite primitive next to what is possible with CGI (Computers) today, but I still enjoy the other-worldly feel these type of Willis O'Brien/ Ray Harryhausen school of effects bring to the film.  The special effects were the combined work of three people. Peter Neilson directed some second unit special effects set-ups in Canada , while Baron Von Nordhoff and K.L. Ruppell executed the stop motion animation work. For it's day it was state of the art and I'm sure grossed out the audiences of its day every bit as much (perhaps even more) then something like Hannibal grosses out audiences today.  Critics in the late 50's in fact complained that the film was too gruesome and unpleasant!
The film is much better than your average 50's creature feature for several reasons.  First, none of the acting is wooden or overly phony.  Second, the brief romantic sub-plot does not side-track the film at all. It's handled in a far less corny and cliche'd manner than usual.  The script is also better than you'd expect and has a minimum of corn-ball lines.  Even the explanations of how these creatures came into existence is handled quite well.  Oh there are dated elements to the film to be sure.  The low budget of the film is also obvious in several ways.  The military base security isn't very impressive for instance.  The final solution is also amusingly naive but forgiveable when you take into the account the film was made in 1958-a time when the space age had barely begun and the real dangers of atomic radiation were still being discovered.
The film is a very economical 74 minutes long.  It adheres to a well known formula but it remains a very effective film bereft of most of the flaws that plague low budget creature features of the 1950's.  It's dated, but the script, acting, direction and effects are effective enough to entertain modern audiences. The director was Arthur Crabtree who began his career as a cinematographer and made films such as The Madonna of the Seven Moons (1944) and Horrors of the Black Museum (1959).  Fiend with a Face isn't a film you watch and enjoy because of its high camp value but because it's still a suspenseful well done film.
It might seem rather remarkable that a low budget creature feature would get the full Criterion red carpet treatment--but it shouldn't.  This is one of the finest examples of an effective and for its day quite controversial film that was imported from England.  Suspend your disbelief, don't expect 1990's effects and have a wonderful time.  You might even find the film is effective enough to give you a few chills.  Really !!
