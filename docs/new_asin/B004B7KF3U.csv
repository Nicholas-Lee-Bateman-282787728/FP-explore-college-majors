8421581,5,B004B7KF3U,"My family really enjoyed watching this DVD! It was so much fun to see Disneyland as it was when the park opened. My dad was there for the opening week, and many times in the years after that. He even met Walt a couple times. Can't wait to watch this again with him! The movie shipped and was delivered very quickly and included a nice personalized note! Thank you very much!!",1397001600,3,375,4.295774647887324
8421582,4,B004B7KF3U,Good video but moved too fast through most of the scenes and cold have been clearer. Would have liked to have seen more of this time frame.  All in all not bad .,1358640000,,161,3.878787878787879
