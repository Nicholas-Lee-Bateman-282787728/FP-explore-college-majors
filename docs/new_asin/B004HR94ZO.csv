8429682,5,B004HR94ZO,One of the best movies ever. I have been searching and searching for this movie. I really hope it comes back in stock because I would love to own it. The story line is sure to bring out tears in you if you know how hard life is as a kid who has had or is in the correction system.,1455840000,,280,3.683333333333333
8429683,5,B004HR94ZO,This movie was an excellent portrayal of how two officers help students learn how to overcome physical and sexual abuse.,1351209600,,120,5.05
8429684,5,B004HR94ZO,After watching this movie about a dozen times on Lifetime (I have it on DVR also) I had the opportunity to meet Marilyn. The movie did not embellish her passion; this woman is so passionate about her kids she inspires me to continue doing what I was put on this earth to do and that is inspiring the at-risk youth I work with like she inspires me.,1333238400,,347,4.1940298507462686
8429685,4,B004HR94ZO,"I have been researching information on Reformative Justice Principles when I came across a documentary on Marilyn Gabrell.
She has helped change the direction of many youth who have parents in prison so that they did not follow in the same steps as their parents. She believed in them and gave them hope. Fighting the odds is her story of bringing change to a particular set of students in an American High School and the effects her love and care for them had on their lives is amazing. Her initiative to bring reformed behaviour and a changed outlook on life is amazing.
I love her story though the woman who plays her role in the movie did grate on me at times.
Well worth the watch.
What can we do to help make a change???",1326153600,,726,4.385185185185185
