Was searching for quite awhile before I found it. It's not
available for American region dvds, however.
I have an all region player, so am able to watch it!",1522454400,,212,4.170731707317073

8025613,5,B0002B96JI,"A 1935 classic, in French no less (with English subtitles)!  Has got to be among the most hilariously funny movies We have ever seen.  Saw it on late-night TV earlier this summer then found it here on Amazon.  Could not believe such luck!  I purchased this as a gift for my wife who is a high school French teacher.  Would easily pass a PG rating, probably even a G rating so it's perfect for high school French club viewing.  This DVD is coded for Region 2, Europe, not the US.  However, we had no problem locating a universal DVD player for viewing.",1468800000,,551,4.3431372549019605

This memorable bittersweet comedy adresses all what you want to see and like from a movie. A first rate script, a top of the line cast, a superb cinematography, a luxurious photography, acidic humor as well an incisive vision about those intimate sins the power hides.

A film made in heaven and one of the fifty films of my desert island collection. As I say my dear reviewer : I can't live without it. It's a feast for your intelligence and good taste. Unmissable....",1462147200,,635,4.4655172413793105
8025615,5,B0002B96JI,Guess who's coming to dinner? Carnival in Flanders was directed by Jacques Feyder in 1935. This film is essentially a major time warp to a time period when people wore big over sized pants and shouted at each all the time. It is a detailed documentary like film about the way people entertained themselves before the television age. Its 1616 and the French town of Flanders is supposedly going to be raided by Spanish raiders.  The city government officials get real worried and start to act crazy. The heroic Mayor thinks it would a good idea to try and play dead. The women come up with a better idea. They decide to throw a carnival and party down with the Spaniards. The plan works extremely well. It is never really totally clear what the women do to swing the vote. I think it is clear that they did a little bit more then play dead. In the end the Spanish end up rewarding the town and excusing them from paying taxes. This must have been one awesome carnival. The sets and costumes are all very detailed. Carnival in Flanders is an old school hit that will truly transport you to a different time and place.  This is also a historical relevant film. It attracted controversy for being banned in Germany in 1939 due to its occupational parallels in connection to World War II.,1334361600,2,1283,4.502145922746781
8025616,5,B0002B96JI,Saw part of this movie on TCM about 6 years ago and have been looking to buy it for a long time. Invested in a all region DVD player just so I could watch it and order more DVDs from other regions.,1319500800,2,197,3.7142857142857144
