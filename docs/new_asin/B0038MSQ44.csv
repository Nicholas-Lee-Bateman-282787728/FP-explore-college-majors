8391547,1,B0038MSQ44,"Very disappointed with the DVD.  Didn't have scenes of the trailers hooches or squadron huts for the F-105 guys.  Focused on Kc-135's, B-66 guys and support personnel.  The primary mission was to support the F-105's.  I 2as there from Oct '67 until Sep '68 and did not recognize very much in the video.",1365638400,,302,4.6415094339622645

would be about, but a good one.
Vendor was prompt and I'm very
satisfied with everything.",1278460800,,126,4.25
