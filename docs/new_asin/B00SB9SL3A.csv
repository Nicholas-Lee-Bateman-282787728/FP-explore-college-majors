6969309,1,B00SB9SL3A,"Biased, anti-Catholicism runs throughout this BBC TV series.  It's bad history with outrageously 'invented' conversations in the script that put down any Catholic perspective on the Reformation. It's mostly fiction purposely crafted to suit the author's [Hilary Mantel] own agenda and openly admitted anti-Catholicism and bias against Saint Thomas More without any historic legitimacy.

Mantel has openly stated  her hatred of the Catholic Chruch and her agenda to denigrate it.  The attack on More's actual historic record is egregious and in the place of the actual historic record the author has placed pure fiction with a purposeful vitriolic twist against Saint Thomas More. The phony dialogue is crafted to give an impression of More as an ignorant selfish man who cares little for anyone.  The false depiction of More as a misogynist  is laughable if it weren't so tragically a misrepresentation of the man who educated his own daughters - a highly usual practice for the period.

It's the old Whig, English Protestant view of history which denigrated and misrepresented the Catholic experience .  Scripted in this series is an entirely contrived and fabricated conversation between Chapuys the Holy Roman Ambassador  and Cromwell where Cromwell gives a lurid description of a lewd monastic life and young  monks and nuns 'begging' to be free from  their convents and monasteries.  A contrived, biased script where nothing is said about the real historic destruction to local community life that the dissolution of the monasteries actually brought with it.  Not a mention of how in the real world the monasteries selflessly served the poor and sick.

As The Telegraph reviewer so well describes what is going on with Wolf Hall  "" historians such as Eamon Duffy with his masterwork The Stripping of the Altars have now conclusively exposed the Reformation for what it was  a cultural and religious calamity that ordinary people never asked for. And yet what Wolf Hall shows is that even in our age of indifference to religion, the old Protestant version of history  in which the Reformation supposedly liberated a backward people from the grip of murky superstition and greedy Popish priests  has not lost its power over our imaginations.""

Duffy also is highly critical of how More is misrepresented in Wolf Hall:  ""More was neither blood-soaked nor a hypocrite [as Wolf Hall suggests]... In an age when all but one of the bishops had perjured themselves by signing up to the Royal Supremacy, More died rather than swear an oath he did not believe. We can therefore trust his solemn insistence that no one in his custody for heresy had ever suffered ""so much as a flip on the forehead"" much less been tortured. ""

And the British historian Simon Schama says of the anti-Catholic bias and false 'history' in this series : ""It grates a bit to accept that millions now think of Thomas Cromwell as a much-maligned, misunderstood pragmatist from the school of hard knocks who got precious little thanks for doing Henry VIII's dirty work.""

Schama goes on to say ""When I was doing research for A History of Britain, the documents shouted to high heaven that Thomas Cromwell was, in fact, a detestably self-serving, bullying monster who perfected state terror in England, cooked the evidence, and extracted confessions by torture. He also unleashed small-minded bureaucratic 'visitors' to humiliate, evict and dispossess thousands of monks and nuns.""

So if you enjoy biased fiction and bad history, this is for you. If you want actual, validly sourced history go elsewhere.",1426204800,72,3574,5.0926243567753
6969310,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Having been infuriated by the much lauded novel upon which this series is based but still being interested in the life of Cromwell I was anxious to see if the adaptation had transcribed all those irritations along with the basic story. Happily that hasn't been the case: the adaptation being mesmerizing not least because of the mesmerizing performance at its core. Mark Rylance is compulsively watchable as the upwardly mobile courtier who, although worldly wise and cunning, still manages to persuade us his heart is in the `right place'.

However, Cromwell was a physical as well as political bruiser: Rylance convinces as the latter but perhaps, less so as the former. In his youth Cromwell was said to have been a mercenary fighting with the French; the scenes in which Cromwell attempts physical intimidation of his opponents might therefore be said to be the only weaknesses in an otherwise stunning actualization of the essence of the man. Frequent references are made to Cromwell's 'low birth', not least by Wolsey whose CV is similar in that respect, and ironically, by the Duke of Norfolk (Bernard Hill), whose vulgarity is singularly at odds with Cromwell's 'noble' forbearance in the face of such provocation.

The other performances are also, largely, first rate, not least that of the brilliant Jonathan Pryce as the aforementioned arch schemer, Wolsey, Cromwell's sponsor, to whom the latter appears genuinely fond; and Anton Lesser as More; even though he comes across in this little more than a vindictive and sanctimonious prig rather than the `man for all seasons' whose `silence deafens all Europe'!

The production not only looks superb: it's literally very dark; but is not afraid, also, to be one of silence and pauses. Ultimately, the impression is of a man of humble origin whose finer qualities of loyalty, courage, iron will and ambition got him promoted to the highest offices of the land but whose real job was as a kind of `nanny' to a spoilt brat for whom he fixed successive toys following their unceremonious dumping from his royal pram.",1425600000,124,2071,5.0145348837209305
6969311,5,B00SB9SL3A,"I have watched a lot of dramas concerning Henry VIII and his court, and I enjoyed this one the most.  I don't know if it is more or less accurate historically than others we have seen, but let's face it - we are familiar with the story of his wives and quest to produce an heir.  And history is written by the victors, so even if a story strictly adheres to written history, it doesn't mean it is 100% accurate.

The writing and the acting is consistently superb, and that is a great start for any series.  Cromwell is usually presented as a two-dimensional (usually evil) character, so if you want to present a fresh look at this story, you can't do better than to revamp his image and run the series from his perspective. Much easier than trying to present Henry or Anne Boleyn in a fresh new way.  Cromwell is complex and quite human here.  He loves his family, shows compassion for others, such as his boss Cardinal Wolsey, and sometimes even gives serious advice to his enemies. He also has a wry sense of humor.

The behind the scenes efforts to get ahead at Henry's court are presented from many angles and many characters.  It can almost be hard to follow at times, but it was worth the effort to figure it out.  I also liked the relationship between Cromwell and Anne Boleyn's sister, Mary.  She is a lively lady - witty and savvy.  I think this fictional rendition of her would have been much better for Henry than Anne ever was, but of course, we don't know how fictional this version is, and he only saw her as a mistress anyway as she apparently didn't hold out on him..

I already know that I will be watching this series at least one more time. Partly because I think I will get catch a bit more of the subtleties the second time around, but mostly for pleasure.  I write novels in my spare time, and a movie or series with intelligent, well-written dialogue inspires me even more than a good book does.  This series falls into that category.",1425427200,234,1957,4.3850415512465375
6969312,4,B00SB9SL3A,"So here are the three most important things you need to know about ""Wolf Hall"":

1. It's based on the novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wolf-Hall/dp/0312429983/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wolf Hall</a>&nbsp;by Hilary Mantel - as opposed to anything by Philippa Gregory. This means a greater attempt at historical accuracy and less interest in romance and melodrama.

2. It is NOT&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tudors/dp/B0042RJWTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tudors</a>. Despite covering the same events and featuring the same characters, ""The Tudors"" was more of a costume drama with an emphasis on Henry's six wives and all the subsequent sex, intrigue and betrayal. ""Wolf Hall"" concentrates more on the intricate politics of the time and the historical ramifications they had.

3. The main character is Thomas Cromwell - not King Henry or Anne Boleyn (who have surprisingly minor roles). As such, most of the events are depicted through Cromwell's point-of-view, focusing on the politics of a single man and his personal relationships.

In short, people who come to ""Wolf Hall"" expecting something like ""The Tudors"" or a Philippa Gregory novel may well be disappointed. This is a very carefully and methodically paced show, one where actors are given plenty of time and space to inhabit their characters and deliver their lines. Most of the ""action"" is simply two people or more talking in a room, and there's very little pageantry or overt drama.

But there are rewards to this subtlety. For instance, one memorable scene is Cromwell and Jane Seymour's brothers calmly telling Jane what to do if the King tries to assault her - that screaming might do no good, so her best bet is to learn a prayer off by heart which she can use to appeal to the King's sense of honour. The casual manner in which they discuss this potential threat to a young woman (one who seems utterly resigned to her fate) is just chilling.

Mark Rylance plays Cromwell as entirely stoic and inscrutable; a somewhat divisive performance that some may find one-note and others deeply nuanced. Since it's up to him to carry the proceedings, your opinion on his Cromwell may well determine what you think of ""Wolf Hall"" in its entirety.

Claire Foy is a wonderful Anne Boleyn - capricious and passionate, but with growing panic behind her eyes as she feels her power waning. Damian Lewis is King Henry, and though it's a surprisingly limited role in terms of how much screen-time he gets, it's a role perfectly suited for him (they didn't even need to dye his natural hair colour!). He captures the famous king's intelligence, generosity, callousness, tempestuousness, and terrifying power.

There are plenty of other familiar faces: Bernard Hill, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Mark Gatkiss, Jonathan Pryce, Harry Lloyd - and even those like Joanne Whalley, who get only a couple of scenes, give it their all.

Fans of the book will be pleased to know that much of Hilary Mantel's witty dialogue remains intact (honestly, why bother otherwise?) but you must be a patient viewer to appreciate what the show is trying to achieve: a careful and honest portrayal of Thomas Cromwell and the part he played in these pivotal years of English history.",1425168000,818,3307,5.319923371647509
6969313,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Masterful performance from Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell. Damien Lewis as Henry VIII is also magnificent, as is Claire Foy is Anne Boleyn.

One of the richest and most intelligent pieces of TV for years. It might not suit pedants who demand 100% historical accuracy (not that such a thing is ever achievable) - and is notably lacking in car chases or their Tudor equivalent - but as totally compelling, wonderfully scripted and sumptuously engaging historical drama, it is right up there with the best the BBC has ever produced.

""And the eyes of the King's Servants turned terribly every way
And the gold of the King's Servants rose higher every day
They burnt the homes of the shaven men  that had been quaint and kind,
Till there was no bed in a monk's house, nor food a man could find
The inns of God where no man paid, that were the wall of the weak,
The King's Servants ate them all. And still we did not speak.
And the face of the King's Servants grew greater than the King's.
He tricked them, and they trapped him, and stood round him in a ring
The new grave lords closed round him, that had eaten of the abbey's fruits
And the men of the new religion, with their bibles in their hands
We saw their shoulders moving, to menace or discuss
And some were pure and some were vile; but none took heed of us.
We saw the King as they killed him, and his face was proud and pale;
And a few men talked of freedom, while England talked of ale.""

6969350,5,B00SB9SL3A,Mark Rylance is extraordinary and is the rest of the cast. Amazing series. Costuming stunning,1521158400,,93,5.266666666666667
6969351,5,B00SB9SL3A,"I think I enjoyed this series more than any other historical period piece I've seen.  There's an aura of quiet maturity about the entire production which is much to my liking.  The pace is quiet and stately and even, like a processional.  Some might call this a fault, the steady consistency maintained throughout the series; but I am long past the age where jagged action, wide contrasts and sudden fits and starts are required to hold my attention. I appreciate more an interesting story, excellently written and superbly acted, which this production certainly is.

I am not put off by the defections from perhaps actual historical accuracy--though this series is arguably less culpable than most others I've seen--and I don't care that Cromwell comes across as a nicer guy than most people seem willing to acknowledge.  I find Rylance's portrayal of this character absolutely fascinating.  That he managed to hold me enthralled by a performance utilizing such minimal variation in facial expression, tone of voice and movement astounds me.  It's like he somehow enables you to read his mind.  The subtle looks which cross his face when listening to another--you can sense what he is inwardly thinking, whether it be contempt for the speaker, regret at a decision conveyed, or merely a mild bemusement at a person's naivete.  All while maintaining a convincing expression of detachment.  I have rarely seen such a marvelous performance.  It only adds to the excellence of the series that all the principal actors perform superbly. I must mention Anton Lesser as one of the highlights as well.

I skimmed over the reviews written here and find that things others complain of, I find most appealing, such as the costumes looking somewhat ill-fitting, or less than immaculate.  I loved that aspect of this series, as one of the things I invariably find perturbing about other period films is how clean, tailored and perfectly tidy all the characters clothes are.  A lot of people complained it was slow, but I addressed that above, and personally found the pacing fine and absolutely befitting the overall tone.  I would call it leisurely rather than slow, a profound difference.  Several complained about the music soundtrack.  I can honestly say I never even noticed the music, which to me only means it was well integrated and non-obtrusive, just as it should be.  Someone said the lighting was frequently too dark; I remember admiring while watching scenes in candle-lit or dungeon-like rooms, that they managed to achieve what is no doubt very difficult technically: to give the effect of an ill-lit room without making the viewer strain or feel like he is missing some action.  It's like every point that needed to be seen was indeed easily seen.

I believe people's preconceptions are what determine their reaction to this series: those looking for precise adherence to written history were disappointed (though one can scarce find any two historians with complete agreement on all points of historical ""fact""), and as I said before, this program was considerably less wayward in that regard than almost every other I've seen.  If one was hoping for wild, war-like action, copious bloodletting and gallant challenges, this movie will disappoint.  Same for those expecting sensuality or even romance; not here.  In fact, when I write it all down like that, it makes me even more amazed that this series was able to gain, not just mine obviously, but thousands of viewers' admiration and appreciation.  It gratifies me to see that, not only can a series such as this still be produced, but that there are yet people out there that can appreciate it.",1521158400,2,3653,5.0

6969353,5,B00SB9SL3A,"A very interesting series and I wish it would have continued but history interferes with mortality. Mark Rylance plays the role of Thomas Cromwell exceptionally well.  As a well read man, Thomas seeks a grander version of himself and he does so by being studious in his reading and becomes well respected as an adviser of the king. A discipline for personal development appears when he sees a younger peer reading from a thick book.

This shapes his idea to become better and as words shape the mind, his mind shaped his reality to be able to prepare himself for the important decisions and responsibilities he would have to make for years to come.  Ultimately, when you go too far and too quickly in your reformations, the country may have another alternative for you.  This met with his demise, but the plot of the series is very well done and highly recommended.  His experiences and reactions to the king are exceptional on how he was able to handle his mercurial behaviors.",1520899200,,978,4.695906432748538

6969367,5,B00SB9SL3A,"It is 1529. Henry VIII has been trying to get the Pope to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon for two years. His chief emissary to the Pope is Cardinal Wolsey, Lord Chancellor, who has a faithful employee, the lawyer Thomas Cromwell. When Wolsey falls from grace, Cromwell is so useful that he stays on, taking orders directly from the King. This is terribly irksome to the new Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas More.

Cromwell is there to see Henry besotted with Anne Boleyn, then married to her, and lastly helping frame her for execution. It is a tale of egos and politics and revenge.

""Wolf Hall"" ends with a jubilant Henry enveloping Cromwell in an embrace, grateful for his help in ridding him of Anne Boleyn. The camera swivels around the two, until we can see Cromwell's face over his lord's shoulder. The look on Cromwell's face  study it. This is a man who knows that Henry's regard can turn on a dime. And if you know your history, you know that is just what will happen.

""Wolf Hall"" originally aired in January/February 2015. It is almost 6 hours total over the 6 episodes. If you buy it on disc, English subtitles are available on all the episodes, but NOT on the Special Features.

Special Features. There is some minor repetition among the features:
...A... ""The People & the Politics"" (10 minutes) Commentators include Peter Kosminsky (director), Claire Foy (plays Anne Boleyn), Colin Callender (producer), Mark Rylance (plays Cromwell), Damian Lewis (plays Henry VIII), Jonathan Pryce (plays Wolsey), Mark Gatiss (plays Gardiner), Tom Holland (plays Gregory Cromwell), Thomas Brodie-Sangster (plays Rafe).
The point of the books and the series is that you see the court and events through Cromwell's eyes; you do not know something until Cromwell knows it. And, as Foy says, ""Our Anne is Hilary's Anne, not not just Henry's bit of stuff.... It's all seen through his eyes. The Anne that you see is Cromwell's Anne.""
...B... ""Bringing it to the Screen"" (5 minutes) New commentators include Mark Pybus (producer) and Peter Straughan (screenplay). Colin Callender says that Mantel ""took a traditionally two-dimensional character, traditionally portrayed as the villain, the man Thomas Cromwell, and turned him into a very complex, moral, fascinating character.""
...C... ""Wolf Hall  History and Design"" (10 minutes) New commentators include Pat Campbell (production designer), Joanna Eatwell (costume designer), Roseann Samuel (hair & makeup design), Gavin Finney (director photography) and David Johnson (locations manager).  Twenty-eight locations were used in the filming, including Gloucester Cathedral, Chastleton House, Sherborne School and Bristol Cathedral (standing in for Westminster Abbey).
...D... ""Cast & Crew Interviews"" (18 minutes total) Interviewees are Peter Kosminsky, Mark Rylance, Mark Gatiss, Damian Lewis, Jonathan Pryce and Claire Foy.

I haven't read either of the Hilary Mantel books on which the series is based, ""Wolf Hall"" (2009) and ""Bring Up the Bodies"" (2012). The 3rd and last in the series, ""The Mirror and the Light"" will cover the last 4 years of Cromwell's life and, as of now, has no publication date.

Back to the ending of my first paragraph. Have you seen or listened to the musical ""Alexander Hamilton""?  It has a song, ""It Must Be Nice"", sung by Hamilton's enemies: ""It must be nice, it must be nice, to have Washington on your side."" The sly malice of the song makes it clear, Hamilton is nothing without Washington. To Cromwell's enemies, he is the King's dog, and if they can just separate him from the King....

Great acting, great historical context and great script.

I don't like the characterization of Cromwell here--he is portrayed as very somber, stoic, and methodical.  I think the real Cromwell was probably more charismatic and fun-loving; historically he was known to love a good party.  I don't like the characterization of Henry the VIII either.  Henry was horribly injured and got extremely fat during the last years of his marriage to Anne Bolynn, and was extremely temperamental and would have fits of anger.  I don't like how he was portrayed as being kind and loving and beloved by the court--clearly he could be a psycho at times.

6969390,1,B00SB9SL3A,"This is a completely slanted view of history which depicts Anne Boleyn as an evil villainess for refusing to be Henry VIII's mistress, while her sister Mary is a heroine for complying with Henry's lust. It's not the first attempt I've seen by PBS to cast women as guilty for men's lasciviousness, but it's a completely misogynistic view that should offend modern sensibilities.

Wolf Hall is another attempt to gloss over Henry VIII's murder-by-jury approach to getting rid of wives by painting the women as promiscuous and conniving (instead of Henry). Surely facts are so completely against Henry that it should disgust anyone to be subjected to this misogynistic approach. (I figured out right away that a man had to have written the script, and, as a matter of fact, when I investigated, I found Peter Straughan is responsible.)

Henry had six wives and numerous mistresses, and he did not bother to live by any moral code that would make him a figure of admiration. About the only thing you can say in Henry's favor is that he used his authority and power to manipulate women into accepting his sexual advances rather than actually physically raping them, but that's hardly redemptive, any more than murdering his wives by execution instead of with his own hands sets him up as a pillar of morality.

Henry had a taste for chaste women who were genuinely religious. But lest you think this is all about Henry VIII and his sexual indulgences, be assured the story is about Cromwell, and quite plodding and dull, while being intermittently offensive.

6969404,5,B00SB9SL3A,"if one can find a spot of compassion in his, or her heart for Thomas Cromwell, it would have to be for having an understanding in such an increasingly HIGHLY, so conflicted a man. His station depended throughout his career under Henry VIII, existing, not living as other men may have had the freedom to do so - between a very sharp sword and a most hardened of walls. Therefore considering that there was no other direction to go, if one believes in the soul's integrity than to lose IT, little by little through committing sinister deeds demanded of him - until he became nearly or more so, do I believe: a conscienceless puppet.

The music in itself is fine and seemingly of the period to this inexpert ear. What is appallingly awful is the production value of the recurring main theme -- an apparently intentional audio distortion of some stringed instrument which sounds much like an electric piano played overly loud through a bad amplifier and speaker. I guess it is supposed to create a dark and ominous mood, but it completely ruins the experience.

3. Atmospheric lighting. The nighttime trials of the Boleyns was particularly well done.
What I didn't like:
1. The apparent rehabilitation of the reputation of the shifty and avaricious Cromwell.
2. Unattractive and ill-fitting costumes.

6969446,3,B00SB9SL3A,"First of all, don't presume from the title that this series in any way focuses on the Seymour clan-- like the book of the same name, this is Thomas Cromwell's series, through and through. For better or for worse; for rich or for...well, snore. You'll definitely have a few of those throughout the series. The pace can be a bit uneven and seems to lag around certain sections of Cromwell's life. As though the writers didn't have enough historical information, and just decided to ""wing it.""

This is most evident in parts relating to his personal life and his relationship with his wife and father, which both feel pretty unsubstantial. The political intrigue can be exciting, but is tempered...or perhaps even stilted...by Rylance's portrayal of Cromwell as stoic to the point of nearing lethargy. A bit of a departure from the conniving, manipulative nature I typically associate with the figure-- traits referenced in Wolf Hall, but never fully displayed.

Anne Boleyn is a wholly unsympathetic, bratty character in this dramatization and her infidelity is given (possibly) a bit too much credence for the comfort of most historians. That said, it makes for juicy viewing. I actually appreciated seeing a little more depth in Damian Lewis' Henry VIII-- he's eye candy, but with a sharp mind and an unpredictable temper. Which is probably a closer likeness to Henry in his youth than the idle, overweight lothario often portayed on screen.

My last complaint is that this wasn't the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell that I was expecting. It showed him grow in the king's favor, but we missed the part where he falls out. Anne of Cleves is never even seen on screen and the show ends abruptly after Anne Boleyn's execution. It seemed like a pretty big missing piece to the puzzle, but perhaps they were setting us up for future episodes? I can't say I'm holding my breath. If you're a die-hard fan of the era (like me) you'll enjoy this for the atmosphere, but it's not going to blow your hair back. It's essentially a PR piece for Cromwell...maybe he wasn't such a selfish S.O.B after all! That could be the byline for the next season. You're welcome, PBS.",1505865600,2,2158,4.795698924731183

An execution that is not directly shown yet is one of the most disturbing things you've seen, it left me very thoughtful long after it finished - could you be so composed under such circumstances? I was only left disappointed by the failure to follow up, although I wouldn't have missed it, plus they're waiting for book two to be written (apparently) and we end up with an unfortunate 'Sherlock' scenario, waiting two to three years for a follow up.

Another review mentioned that this show is not The Tudors or a Phillipa Gregory novel and I whole-heartedly agree. This is a show for people who love the nuances and back-door political dealings behind historical events.

I felt the show was incredibly well cast and acted. Even minor characters were intriguing and there were only a few moments when a minor character's lines were delivered in a way which I, personally, found to be a bit comically distracting.

There are a few scenes that could be disturbing to younger viewers (one non-descript torture scene, a pretty intense examination, miscarriages, Boyeln's beheading, comments filled with innuendo, and a few uses of the F word) so I wouldn't recommend this to viewers under the age of 16.",1497571200,,829,4.914285714285715

Mark Rylance plays Cromwell and shows us what it's like to be the smartest guy in the room. Damien Lewis plays Henry as a young man, girl crazy and obsessed with his legacy. Claire Foy plays Anne Boleyn as beautiful, insecure and flirtatious. She's every bit Cromwell's equal as a manipulator, but she forgets that being born on third base doesn't mean you hit a triple.

6969522,5,B00SB9SL3A,"""Wolf Hall"" is a highly-acclaimed six-part miniseries from PBS, which is a television adaptation of two novels by Hilary Mantel, ""Wolf Hall"" and ""Bring Up The Bodies."" It is a fictionalized account of the rapid rise to power of Thomas Cromwell during the reign of King Henry VIII, up until the death of Sir Thomas More, and a depiction of the abundant drama surrounding the relationship of the King and Anne Boleyn. The stellar cast is led by such luminaries as Mark Rylance, Damian Lewis, Jonathan Pryce, and Claire Foy, along with numerous other highly talented and accomplished actors. The writing is excellent, the wardrobe and set design are superb, and the plot and character development are outstanding. In addition, ""Wolf Hall"" is very intelligent and thought-provoking, in that it motivates its viewers to ponder and contemplate a highly momentous period in the history of England. ""Wolf Hall"" is decidedly interesting and engaging, and I found it to be very entertaining and enjoyable. ""Wolf Hall"" is an outstanding PBS historical drama, and it merits a five-star rating, along with a very enthusiastic recommendation.",1495411200,4,1128,5.169398907103825

It's a commitment to watch, because it is long, slow, and subtle.  There are fascinating ideas here, about the world and power, both official and personal and about morals. How far are you willing to go to do what you are ordered to, to do what you believe in, and what happens when duties conflict?

6969543,5,B00SB9SL3A,"From here on in, whenever you think of Thomas Cromwell and Wolf Hall, it will be impossible not to see Mark Rylance's serious, craggy face as the protagonist. Like Al Pacino's Michael Corleone, Cromwell as portrayed is the master of holding his temperament, of giving nothing away, one who rarely utters a verbal threat. All of which, of course, makes him all the more dangerous. Those who underestimate him, do so at their peril and England in the 1520-30s is a perilous place.

Although all actors involved carry the drama, Rylance's performance is a masterpiece. The story centers on him. The PBS series borrows liberally from the book both in terms of scene and dialogue. It is a faithful recreation of Mantel's brilliant novel which brings Tudor England to life in ways ""The Tudors"" failed (Damien Lewis is more physically and emotionally believable as Henry VIII than Jonathan Rhys Meyers.)

A old hand on the English and American theatrical stages, Rylance is a relative newcomer to the screen. No matter. He is a master of projecting a commanding presence which makes ""Wolf Hall"" impossible to envision without him.

6969586,5,B00SB9SL3A,"""First thing we do is kill all the lawyers"".  This famous line from Shakespeare's play Henry VI I always thought pertained to Cromwell.  Cromwell was totally Henry the VIII's creature.  Henry said what he wanted and Cromwell found a calculated cold way to achieve it.  This series did a lot to humanize Cromwell and made it clear that the moral failing was not his alone.  A King is absolute, to argue with Henry who was known to rationalize his vindictive streak was to court death.  Wolsey had lost his life by trying to steer the King to a sensible path,""I see the matter against me how it is framed. But if I had served God as diligently as I have done the King, he would not have given me over in my grey hairs"" he is reported to have said at his demise.  The series ends with Anne's death but Cromwell continued through two more Queens.  Jane Seymour gave Henry his son and then had the rather good sense to die before palace intrigue and fickle King could do her in like Anne.  Cromwell finely convinced Henry to make a dynastic marriage and get himself some allies in Europe against the threat of a French and Holy Roman Empire alliance.  Here, Cromwell made his mistake, the rivalry between the French and the German were already pretty well sealed and the chances of a lasting peace between them was simply not possible as the Holy Roman Emperor Charles the V pretty much had France encircled.  He controlled Austria, Germany, Spain, Burgundy, most of Italy, the Netherlands, and don't forget the New World.  Cromwell got his marriage, Henry said Anne turned him off and she had the very good sense to go quietly, the Duke of Norfolk (remember Anne's Uncle?) saw a chance for revenge on Cromwell by bringing on the young Katherine Howard who apparently captured Henry's heart.  On the day Henry married Katherine, Cromwell was executed.  But fortune turned again and within two years Henry was regretting Cromwell's loss. Katherine was found to have been rather indiscreet before she married the King and was being blackmailed.  She wasn't a bad woman, just very young 16 or 17 at her marriage and not as smart and worldly as her cousin Anne.  Needless to say her end was like her cousin and Cromwell's.",1491436800,2,2213,4.621483375959079

6969654,4,B00SB9SL3A,"The following summary is far from being sufficient or satisfying:

Mark Rylance and Damian Lewis star in this miniseries adapted from Hilary Mantel's novels ""Wolf Hall"" and ""Bring Up the Bodies."" The story focuses on Thomas Cromwell, consigliere to King Henry VIII, as he maneuvers his way through Tudor court. Filmed on location in England, the story is told from Cromwell's perspective, and sheds light on the Tudor middle class and the internal struggles England faces amid the Protestant Reformation. Claire Foy, Bernard Hill, Anton Lesser and Mark Gatiss also star. (http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tv/x/EP02123009, accessed December 23, 2016)

In fact we could even consider it is slightly warped about the Protestant Reformation in England. We are in what the film shows far from such a change. So we better get into more details to really assess the value of this mini-series which is definitely crucial in our understanding of Henry VIII but also the tremendous turning point England is being at the time for the whole Christian world and in fact what is to become the West. A new concept of monarchy is being born then.

The very first element is the crucial background that is clearly alluded to but not explained. Henry VII in 1485 defeated Richard III and established the new dynasty based on the coming to terms of the two main noble families, the Lancaster to which Henry VII was connected and the York that provided the support of the church through the Cardinal of York. This coming to terms is fragile and brittle and Henry VIII is supposed to use it and reinforce it. His first marriage is of course seen as a denial of this competitive consensus since his first wife is related to the German Emperor and the Crown of Spain since the German Emperor is also the King of Spain. Whats more she is a fundamentalist Catholic in a country where Protestantism and Reformation are spreading both from Germany and from France, both the Lutherans and the Calvinists. It is alluded to with the burning of Tyndale. Note the film cheats slightly since Tyndale was strangled first and then burnt at the stake. At this moment the Catholics were dominant and Cromwell is practically the only person who airs strong criticism of monastic orders in England with sharp arguments like living in luxury, doing nothing productive and practicing a luscious life full of lust, the older members of the communities satisfying their erotic desires on the younger ones, particularly the novices. There is nothing gay in that practice which is nothing but pedophile violation. But in the whole series there must be three maybe four short instances of such criticism which is far from being developed and emphasized.

In the same way the series alludes and slightly states the change introduced by Henry VIII on the advice from Thomas Cromwell to declare himself the supreme head of the English Church. And yet that is only connected to the first wife Henry VIII who was divorced on very light grounds considering that the marriage was not legal and thus did not have to be broken since it never existed, an argument refused by her uncle the German Emperor and by the Pope, and under that argument she only was a concubine and her daughter, the infamous Mary I to be known as Bloody Mary, had no right to the throne. To be able to divorce her and to remarry Henry VIII had to be the head of the Church. Note this argument was so light that after his death his son was king first, then his first daughter Mary was queen, and then and only then the second daughter Elizabeth was queen.

This daughter Elizabeth is the center of this series in a way though she is hardly seen since she was an infant at the time. The second wife, her mother, Anne Boleyn was young and beautiful but she was also a great power hungry woman. She got rid of many people by intrigue and she more or less supported the appointment of Thomas Cromwell as the secretary to the King because  and there she was mistaken  he defended the interests of the king though she thought he defended her interests. Thats the most interesting side of the series. Henry VIII is an impulsive and angry man and he needs Thomas Cromwell to cool him down, to provide him with information he gets from his boys who are like spies eavesdropping all the time and letting him know about what they saw and heard. The main one is Rafe. This production makes him young, which he is, but lean and unattractive with a general stance that makes him look like a corpse hungry raven or buzzard. And thats the power of Thomas Cromwell who is not an aristocrat by birth and as such is looked down upon by all aristocrats but he holds them by their private parts because he knows things they don't exactly like him knowing.

The next interest is that Henry VIII had a real court with the nobility, the aristocracy being present there and enjoying the easy life of doing nothing and being entertained and taken care of by the king. Anne Boleyn follows in that line and has her own beaus and suiters and her own musicians and ladies in attendance. The point that is levelled at her later on is that she has a promiscuous relationship with these young men, a lute player who is not noble by birth and several young nobles? The lute player will be easy to break and he will confess under duress though under no physical torture all the names Thomas Cromwell wants including her own brother and she will easily be accused of incest and philandering which is supposed to be permitted only to men. In other words she took advantage of the philandering of the young nobles and that is probably true. The point is how far and there is no real proof it was what was asserted against her. The series as for that shows how justice is not the search for anything true, but only the devising of tricks that can corner the accused in doing just what could be interpreted as the crime he is accused of like Read this and tell us if you said it. The dumb man reads The king is in no way satisfying the queen because he has neither the endowment nor the skill to do it. And then says I never said that. And Thomas Cromwell has it easy when the House of Lords stops laughing to say: You just did. Daniel would be ashamed of such justice, and Solomon too.

We are in other words far from just justice, true justice or the like. We are still in some kind of clownish fake ersatz of justice. Thats why Henry VIII likes Thomas Cromwell though he is not a noble by birth: he can more or less feel what the kings desires are going to be, i.e. the kings desires that are not yet expressed but that are going to emerge, and this requires a high level of intimacy with the king and psychology.

But what is shown or insinuated is that the king has to maneuver all the time to satisfy the hunger for power of the various noble families, marrying the daughters of these families being the tool to pacify the families and then getting rid of the daughters is the best way to push the families one after the other out of favor. It is all a power game, some game of thrones that never ends. In other words, Thomas Cromwell did not make kings but he sure made the legitimate king strong. And his first duty is to see the lust the king feels for this or that daughter of this or that noble family and then to make it possible for the girl to get the king on the proper ground, on the proper footing, i.e. to titillate the king and yet never yield and never appear as if she was trying to capture him; he must be the one who captures the girl though it has to happen within the etiquette and protocol limits of a new monarchy emerging. In the old days the king could take all the women he wanted who were from his vassals but that has been changing for a while and Henry VIII represents that change: the liege lord does not have this power any more: he has to go through etiquette, protocol and decent procedures. Kings are no longer what they used to be. But to be able to marry six wives he had to go through a lot of effort and pain: divorced, executed, natural death, divorced, executed and the last one survived. Catherine of Aragon was divorced. Anne Boleyn was executed. Jane Seymour died after childbirth. Anne of Cleves was divorced. Kathryn Howard was executed and Katherine Parr survived and was widowed. Just note the pattern of the first names: Catherine  Anne  Jane  Anne  Kathryn  Katherine. There is something obsessional in Henry VIII. The series shows a man who follows his fancies, at times his crazes though he is shown as afraid of death or of dying.

It is thus a realistic series about Henry VIII the man as well as the king but it is visibly realistic as for the society that is depicted but it is not exactly fair or faithful because it is centered on the nobles that are arrogant and superior with anyone who is not from their elite group, and the worst among them is Anne Boleyn. The way she treats her lute player is absolutely gross and it deserves the execution she got, though she dragged into her own death the lute player and three more young nobles. Concerning the execution, it should have been fair to say that she was not burnt at the stake because Henry VIII refused the accusation of witchcraft though he alludes to it once when he pretends he has been charmed or bewitched in some way. She was thus executed like a noble person, certainly not as a traitor. It would have been nice if the executioner had been presented as a skilled executioner called for the occasion from Calais so that the show could be clean and she was beheaded upright on her knees with one single stroke of a sword. It was not the case for Thomas Cromwell four years later in 1540 who was beheaded with an axe and it took several strokes to finally do the job.

A very good production though slightly light on some facets of that period and this king. But it was sure that people who got too close to him did not last very long.

I am come hither to die, and not to purge myself, as may happen, some think that I will, for if I should do so, I were a very wretch and miser: I am by the Law condemned to die, and thank my Lord God that hath appointed me this death, for mine offence: For sithence the time that I have had years of discretion, I have lived a sinner, and offended my Lord God, for the which I ask him heartily forgiveness. And it is not unknown to many of you, that I have been a great traveler in this world, and being but of a base degree, was called to high estate, and sithes the time I came thereunto, I have offended my prince, for the which I ask him heartily forgiveness, and beseech you all to pray to God with me, that he will forgive me.
O father forgive me. O son forgive me, O holy Ghost forgive me: O three persons in one God forgive me. And now I pray you that be here, to bear me record, I die in the Catholic faith, not doubting in any article of my faith, no nor doubting in any Sacrament of the Church. Many hath slandered me, and reported that I have been a bearer, of such as hath maintained evil opinions, which is untrue, but I confess that like as God by his holy spirit, doth instruct us in the truth, so the devil is ready to seduce us, and I have been seduced: but bear me witness that I die in the Catholic faith of the holy Church. And I heartily desire you to pray for the Kings grace, that he may long live with you, may long reign over you. And once again I desire you to pray for me, that so long as life remains in this flesh, I waver nothing in my faith.

Was Thomas Cromwell a Protestant as it has been asserted or then he referred to the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, the Nicene creed existing at the time of Constantine, but to argue on a capital C or a small c in an oral speech before dying and with no real record of it, except memory, is maybe slightly contrived or fanciful.

6969656,5,B00SB9SL3A,"I recently watched this entire series in a sort of binge fashion. What a terrific series and A+ acting by Mark Rylance and Damien Lewis in the lead roles.
It is somewhat refreshing to see Damien Lewis perform in his native accent. Rylance is a superb theater actor and he certainly doesn't disappoint here.
You can notice he is not entirely happy with the outcome of his plotting and the demise of the Queen, which almost universally now has been accepted to be false charges.
Very good series and strongly recommend.
It would have been nice to his rise and fall in the second season as he too meets a similar end, but it appears there won't be a 2nd series.",1482019200,,658,4.446280991735537

6969694,5,B00SB9SL3A,"This title is on my list as one of the best screenplay adaptations of a series novel I've had a pleasure of watching. I have lost count, the number of times I have viewed this DVD. Sometimes I play it as background simply because the speech cadence and soundtrack are so enjoyable.

If your are a person who is well versed in Tudor history, The War of the Roses but have not yet read Hilary Mantel's novels, this is an exceedingly interesting and unique point of view of the events and of Thomas Cromwell. The screenplay is absolutely true to Mantel's novels and the novels, in my opinion, are spectacular.  This miniseries did the books some serious justice. I only wish this cast would be brought back together again after the final novel in the series is published.

The subtleties and depth the actors bring to the characters is world class. Each one is absolutely believable in their role and the ensemble together is nothing short of magnificent. Casting could not have done a better job.
Mark Rylance for example. My goodness. He notes in the bonus material that he did not read the novels before filming. This is insane because he nails Cromwell to a tee and is fantastic in the role. I suppose, again, it speaks somewhat to casting.  Bernard Hill as the Duke of Norfolk is a favorite. I cannot help myself at times yelling ""I'll do slaughter!"" if I'm miffed at some major annoyance. Mark Gatiss as Stephen Gardiner (!!), his timing and delivery are beautiful. Damien Lewis makes an eerily perfect sociopath that is Henry Tudor. Claire Foy's control of her facial expressions and command of the character's tightly-held, just-under-the-surface rage, mental exhaustion and breakdown is impeccable. Anton Lesser's take on More as an entitled, self-righteous zealot is scarily believable.

The detail of set design is impeccable. For example, as Cromwell rises in Henry's court, if you are paying attention you will see small, significant changes in his daily household living such as the slow change of moving from pewter cups, to silver and finally to ornate wine glasses. The table settings, the sideboard accessories and for a man who wears mostly black, the small and increasingly expensive, subtle changes to his wardrobe. Even the change in his household windows. It's all done so well, so thoughtfully and so subtly that if you weren't paying attention you would miss how completely these subtleties tie in to the character and your assessment of him.

It is often said that a film or miniseries cannot compete in depth with a novel. And so it is. But this miniseries did great honor to the works.",1477699200,12,2610,4.827740492170022

6969711,4,B00SB9SL3A,"For those who love history and are willing to put the necessary time and effort into its understanding, this will be a treat, as it was for me. And while I'm no historian and have no place in judging the efforts of others, this series has some difficulties. The darkness, the limited speeches, and the lingering stares can make this tedious in parts.

I strongly recommend reading the books, WOLF HALL and BRING UP THE BODIES, by Hilary Mantel upon which this series is based. This permits the viewer to understand the many subtleties and textures of this production. I expect that's like having a cheat code but it was such a help for me. I read and watched almost literally at the same time. I then understood what the silence and the staring were meant to convey. And they did a good job on being faithful to the works they draw from. By cutting and pasting the smaller scenes plus squeezing some of the others into one, it manages to put a flattering more marketable face to a refined and poetic work.

It is also invaluable for figuring out the Thomas's in this bit of history. Cromwell, Cranmer, More, Seymour, Wriothesley (""just call me Rizley"") et al. And I think the costuming is more accurate than The Tudors series although I like the latter more... some of the garments are quite unflattering (I pity Mark Rylance on this score). Not only does it fail to convince the viewer that Cromwell is much younger in the flashbacks, it gives him a bit of a goofy look (the ""helmet"" type cap that appears like a WWI pilot's headgear).

The books are a challenge to read as well. The use of present tense and constant pronouns make it very confusing about who is acting and talking in each paragraph. I realize that this is poetic license but without the DVD's I would have missed a lot.

I was unaware that I was buying a TV series rather than a movie so I was surprised and displeased at the abrupt ending. Happily, there will be
more to see and soon. I hope.",1476057600,,1962,4.456824512534819

Rather he is presented as someone disgusted by the abuses and corruption within the leadership of the Roman Catholic Church.  I had to agree when he noted that the whip was repugnant and stated ""people's labors ought be put to better use...""  or ""...he must have had 3000 fingers"".

6969781,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Well I see people comparing Wolf Hall with the tudors and giving the former more credit and I say this as an observer:

Both are fictions. The Tudors had come by the imagination of a screenwriter and Wolf Hall is based on a novel. A NOVEL.
So while shaming The Tudors for all those courtly fantasies and  for being a soap, to which you have every right to do, considering awful historical inaccuricies, you should also make the same impartial judgement for Wolf Hall. Since Anne Boleyn was portrayed, unfairly, as a shameful figure in both series' and many others, I don't want to drudge up all those documental facts and make a grumbling comparison between these imaginations and real life; since I believe the audience, including myself, is really tired of that bulls***, and  although The Tudors tried to give her credit back and sympathize with her,in some cases, I think it was considerably late and insufficient.

Just because Wolf Hall wasn't a huge display of rich and elaborate costumes and show off of some sexy actors and had a small budget, that doesn't make it nearest to the truth. When I see people commenting about how bad The Tudors was and how great Wolf Hall is, I can only think they're being unfair. David Starkey once said  'BBC ought to be ashamed of The Tudors', a comment which I cannot but endorse, but if that is the case, it should be ashamed of Wolf Hall too. Since both are inaccurate, both of their makers or such like thought of nothing but filling their pockets, and BBC is unbelievably persistent on bringing the fiction 'back to life' and not the real history. Well done.

Thomas Cromwell was not 'the greatest' man. He was shrewd, very intelligent, wise, I respect him in so many views, and consider him as a huge politician and yet his career was all about being the henchman of the man who was so timid, fickle,  a man who lacked courage, and integrity to resolve his own filthy matters with the same -and those matters which, as KING and the head of the jurisdiction in the country, he should had had the skills to work out, but after all, how much  Henry VIII was of  a king in its real meaning is obviously debatable-, and he luckily found that particular man who was in many ways like himself to do the 'errands' on his behalf, and this was Cromwell.

In addition, those who are praising Wolf Hall for its supposed accuracy(!) are not representing a jot of difference for me than those who are awed by Phillippa Gregory's s***... or books shall I say?

Other than that I'm not against a bit of fictionalizing since it makes people interested about history(irrefutably), but if you don't onwards or afterwards spend money on producing educative series' like this with documentary evidence, and not of some 'people's' point of view, you're making a huge mistake BBC, since it seems to me that all you're efforts are focusing on making money by twisting the facts, and playing your 'no comment' part when it comes to accuracy, because you shouldn't be all about picking up the name of some popular characters and twisting them, this is not what BBC should be about. Facts are not just for documentaries, you can really teach people history, you can really do it, just try once! Because some people really persistent on believing what they see on tv and what they read in fiction novels or such,without bothering to simply learn the facts; but to people who are not prejudicial and not willing to be unfair to those who are makers of history such as characters of this series, and simply like to enjoy a  good period drama it is still not a big deal, of course.

So, apart from this accuracy thing, I liked the series, very much so. Although I'm tired of cliche's about Anne Boleyn -very tired, indeed-, I found the cast professional, acting: perfect. Costumes: beautiful. They catched the clothing style of the era without making them look like they're made with cheap fabric, which seems to me to be a very unprofessional act made by many other productions, making even the audience feel sweaty and uncomfotable. Damien Lewis is a great actor, and he played the role considerably well, looking a bit of real Henry VIII, with his hair, and posture. Claire Foy I think, did a great job, and she really looks alike the portraits of Anne Boleyn, with which I am happy,her acting is incredibly beautiful, she really brought Anne Boleyn back to life, save that evil manner (argh!) which so many times attributed to her falsely. But her boldness, the way, she stands, her overbearing attitude, has really made me fall in  love her portrayal. Great job indeed.

Beyond that, the story is wonderful. Wolf Hall (like the book it is based on) takes Thomas Cromwell and charts his unlikely path to power, from son of a blacksmith to chancellor of England. He does this through a series of careful alliances (often with people others might not ally with - such as Anne Boleyn. I loved the line, ""In a world where Anne can be king, Cromwell can be...."" giving the possibility that perhaps those not nobly born can amount to something in this changing universe), politics, and his own clever mind.

Wolf Hall in particular humanizes Cromwell (helped by Rylance's amazing acting).  We see  him grieve for his beloved wife and daughters, see him suffer with the decisions he has to make (i.e. trying to convince a friend to renounce his ""heresy"" to avoid being burned at the stake, decide to what extent to support the varied politicians around him) and how agonizing many of these decisions are.

6969815,5,B00SB9SL3A,"This BBC six-episode series based on Hilary Mantels novels is my style of drama.  Mark Rylance, as Thomas Cromwell, is mesmerizing.  I couldn't keep my eyes off him.  He does more with less than any actor Ive seen.  (Britisher Rylance recently won an Academy Award for his supporting role in Bridge of Spies.)  The story begins in Henry VIIIs 1529 and gives a new view of Cromwell as Henrys right hand man.  Instead of villain to Thomas Mores saint, he is more heroic and Thomas More less so.  Well, maybe heroic is the wrong word.  He is the perfect example of a person in totally ambiguous situations who never blames anyone or anything, but merely plays his cards with calm finesse, aware of everyone at the table and all that is at risk.  He is quietly breathtaking, good cop/bad cop at the same moment.  If you like explicit sex, horrific violence, and cliff hangers, see Outlander.

6969819,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Absolutely brilliant. If you despair of the illiteracy and shallowness of the modern age, this will renew your faith. It easily ranks with the TV version of Brideshead Revisited. The source books are also brilliant. Well-realized characters are depicted with a few clever strokes. I first listened to the audio book, then watched this.  Cromwell was a pivotal figure in the history of Anne Boleyn's rise and fall which brought about events of major and lasting importance, that is, Britain's separation from the Roman Catholic Church. We see the age through the life of Cromwell and see him as a complex. clever, and feeling man who must tread the minefields of the changing attitudes and wishes of Henry VIII and his court, the Boleyn and other families, and Ann Boleyn. As well he has family tragedies and what is depicted as his own tragedy of binging down Thomas More. These are all recognizable and complex human beings, and the show will take all your attention. The sets and clothing are well chosen and the palace rooms look comfortable and authentic, with tapestries and carpets and often dark coloured capes and hats. By comparison, the ""Tudors"" is  of course utter nonsense where only the names are accurate, Not much is known of Cromwell but this is an excellent protrayal of a complex man gaining power, abiding insults, taking subtle steps, doing his best to reconcile his conscience, his amibtiion, and his job.",1468108800,2,1426,4.912863070539419
6969820,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Tudors was a show a while ago that was a fairly interesting period drama with heavy emphasis on the playboy life of the king. IMO it was far greater than the Spartacus, Black Sails variety. Anyway I probably avoided this for a while because of the Tudors, or because it now gets grouped in with those other shows that have no point but spilled guts, and sex. This is entirely different, and I have to say I think entirely better. It was (for me anyway) truly addicting, which few shows actually are. It does follow the level headed, crafty perspective of Cromwell, but the way the whole show fits together that perspective works well overall in the universe. From the snitbits of other worlds you don't need to see deeper into them than Cromwell's vantage point.

Different than Downtown Abbey, but every bit as good.",1468108800,5,817,4.63448275862069

6969888,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Wolf Hall is a masterpiece. But it moves slowly and its easy to get lost. Most characters are introduced by name, (not all though!), but you have to be watching closely. And if you don't know the Tudor story the names often have little meaning. Moreover, its also hard to know where you are geographically at times, and even more so, WHEN you are. There are four, count em FOUR, leaps through time. The following breakdown of the 20 scenes in episode one  Three Card Trick attempts to guide you past these hurdles to make for a more enjoyable viewing experience.

Scene 1  October 1529  The kings men attempt to relieve Cardinal Wolsey of The Great Seal
The location is Cardinal Wolseys extravagant residence, York Place. The first character seen is Thomas Cromwell, standing in an upstairs window, his silhouetted back to the camera. He is watching the approach of riders Norfolk (the Duke of Norfolk) and Suffolk (the Duke of Suffolk). Norfolk is the one who speaks first once inside, and is on camera left when standing in front of Cardinal Wolseys desk. Cromwell is seen coming down an interior stairway. His face is finally revealed when he extinguishes the lantern and whispers into Wolseys ear.

[Cardinal Wolsey is a close advisor to King Henry VIII, and currently in charge of getting the Pope to sanction an annulment of the kings marriage to Queen Katherine of Aragon. Cromwell is a pivotal character in that he is destined to become prominent in the Kings court, picking up where Wolsey will leave off. The men bearing the titles of Duke of Norfolk and Duke of Suffolk are referred to by their titles rather than their personal names. Norfolk is the Uncle of Anne Boleyn, the woman who ultimately will replace Henrys present wife. Norfolk is happy to see Wolsey go because the cardinal has failed to secure the annulment in order that the king can remarry and hopefully beget a son. Norfolk also resents Wolsey for being a common man, a butchers son, not an aristocrat.]

Scene 2  October 1529  Exiting York Place
Cromwell and the cardinal confer inside. When departing by boat a new character appears whom Cromwell refers to as George. It is writer George Cavendish, the biographer of the Cardinal Wolsey.

[Clearly Norfolk and Suffolk got their paperwork together because Cardinal Wolsey is evacuating his residence at York Place.]

Scene 3  TIME JUMP  Flashback to 8 years earlier in 1521  Cromwell meets Cardinal Wolsey
A masquerade ball at Windsor Castle. Anne Boleyn is showcased dancing with her ill-advised suitor Harry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland. Annes father, Sir Thomas Boleyn, is shown lower right at the start of the scene. A conversation between Wolsey and Boleyn overrides the music.

The scene jumps to Wolseys office where the conversation is actually taking place, presumably sometime after the ball. A man standing in the shadows is identified as Secretary Stephen Gardiner. Then a man standing further into the shadows is identified as Thomas Cromwell.

[Harry Percy and Anne Boleyn were each already promised in marriage to others when they met and fell in love. This scene is about getting the two separated and back on path. After the meeting with Sir Boleyn, Thomas Cromwell is meeting Cardinal Wolsey for the first time. Cromwell states he is from Putney, which is in Surrey country south of London. It is shown that Cromwell is already resented by Stephen Gardiner, who is a Bishop. This may be because Cromwell too is a commoner, but historically the two men were at odds due to Cromwell supporting the Reformation and Gardiner set against it.]

Scene 4  Cromwell goes home
Austin Friars, London. Cromwell returns home from his meeting with Wolsey and greets his wife Liz (Elizabeth). The following morning we meet their daughters, Anne (older) and Grace (younger). A letter from their son Gregory is read. We aren't told where Greg writes from. We then meet Cromwells ward Rafe Sadler, as well as Cromwell's nephew Richard.

[An important event in this scene is the delivery of Tyndales New Testament, which is one of the first English language versions of the Bible. This event informs us that Cromwell is in the Reformation camp, a movement which Cromwell and King Henry will later use to leverage the goal of getting the King a new wife.

Scene 5  Cromwell returns to York Place
No new characters

[Cromwell is now in the employ of Cardinal Wolsey and the two men get to know each other by sharing stories. The current strategy to obtain the annulment is revealed.]

Scene 6  TIME JUMP  Fast forward back to 1529
We rejoin the cardinals exodus from York Place. The boat ride up river has terminated and at nightfall we find the entourage approaching Esher Place, where Wolsey will reside in exile for four months. Esher Place is also in Surrey county. Musician Mark Smeaton is introduced when Cromwell asks him to go play for Wolsey. We see biographer George Cavendish again. In daylight Cromwell comes upon Smeaton once more, who is sitting at a table with his instrument laid upon it.

[We see that Mark Smeaton, who is a nobody, is slow to obey Cromwells order to play for the Cardinal, and later shows disrespect for Cromwell in an overheard conversation. This is all a setup for a pivotal role Smeaton will play later.]

Scene 7  Thomas Cromwell dines with Thomas More
Sometime after leaving the cardinal, Cromwell attends dinner at the house of a merchant friend named Antonio Bonvisi. Here we meet Thomas More, who is seated at the opposite end of the table. We also meet the Roman emperors new ambassador to England, Monsieur Chapuys, sitting camera right.

[Chapuys face is worth memorizing as he will have a role to play further on. Of note here is Cromwells assertion that Thomas More is behaving in a hypocritical manner by accepting the powerful office of Lord Chancellor. This is painting a very different picture of the Thomas Cromwell portrayed in A Man For All Seasons (1966), with Paul Scofield in the role of a very saintly Thomas More.

Scene 8  TIME JUMP  Flashback 18 months earlier to 1527
This is well after Cromwell meets Wolsey, but a year and a half before the fall of Wolsey. Cromwell visits York Place, still occupied by the Cardinal. No new characters.

[The news that Roman troops have captured the Pope distresses everyone in Cardinal Wolseys camp because the chance of an annulment has evaporated, given that the Roman Emperor is related to Queen Katherine. Of note too is Wolseys comment to Cromwell as he takes him into another room; In every emergency look to see if there is some advantage for your Prince, Thomas. The suggested tactic is somewhat reminiscent of the modern expression Never let a good crisis go to waste. By the end of the conversation the audience is getting a sense of the real life chess game that is playing out.]

Scene 9  Evening at the Cromwells
Cromwell returns to his Austin Friars residence that evening. A reference is made to two off-screen characters, Cromwells sister (mother of his live-in nephew, Richard) and Cromwells father.

[Daughter Grace appears with angel wings and looks so angelic herself she might just exit the room in flight when beckoned. Cromwell then interacts with his other daughter Anne upstairs. The real point of the scene is that Thomas Cromwells deeply loved children have never seen his father, and he wants to keep it that way. So far we don't know why].

Scene 10  Next morning Cromwell prepares to depart the house
No new characters

[The conversation between Cromwell and his wife remind us that Cardinal Wolsey is headed for France to try and drum up support among the other Cardinals to approve the annulment of the Kings marriage while the Pope is removed from play. There is an inkling that something is not right with Liz, but weve not been briefed further. A strange moment occurs on the stairs when Cromwell thinks he sees Liz atop the staircase. Upon second look shes not there. Again, we the audience know nothing further.]

Scene 11- A Clandestine Meeting
Cromwell departs Austin Friars, bound for Grays Inn to meet in secret with other reformation-minded Christians who support the Tyndale English translation of the Bible. The man speaking when Cromwell entered the room is a lawyer and priest by the name of Thomas Bilney (yes, another Thomas). Fortunately he went by his nickname, Little Bilney. When Little Bilney ignorantly reveals the whereabouts of William Tyndale (who is in hiding to avoid prosecution) it is James Bainham, another lawyer and member of the Protestant reformer that Cromwell turns to.

[An interesting scene because we are seeing one angle of a famous turning point in history; the Protestant (as in protest) reformation of the Roman Catholic Church, led by Martin Luther.]

Scene 12  Cromwell discovers the death of his family
Cromwell returns home to find his wife and children dead from the sweating sickness, an infectious disease that kills within hours, and to date remains a mystery. Thomas is greeted by his wifes sister, Johane Williamson, who breaks the news off-camera. There is a short flashback in this scene when Thomas recalls his daughter Grace outlining the colored images in the Bible, but I don think that qualifies as an outright time shift. :>

Scene 13  Soon after the death of Cromwells family
York Place. Cardinal Wolsey has returned from his mission to France and briefs Cromwell.

Scene 14  Cromwell visits his father
Putney. Cromwell visits his father, Walter.

[we find out why Cromwell has been sheltering his family from his father]

Scene 15  Cromwell returns home
Cromwell receives Rafe and Richard in his office. No new characters.

[Apparently Richards father (the husband of Cromwells sister) has died, presumably from the sweating sickness, but we are not told. From hence forward he is treated as the son of Oliver Cromwell.]

Scene 16  Testimony regarding the annulment of King Henrys marriage
Legatine court in Blackfriars London. Queen Katherine of Aragon is testifying. She turns her gaze to the King while declaring her virginity when they were married, and we get our first look at King Henry VIII. Not sure who the character is that then testifies against Katherine, but it is unimportant as we never see him again. Outside the room we again see Bishop Stephen Gardiner.

[what unfolds between Gardiner and Cromwell is a veiled threat that once Wolsey is dismissed upon failing to get the annulment granted, Cromwell will have no protection from the enemies hes made while in the service of the Cardinal. Gardiner gloats over this and we know why.]

Scene 17  TIME JUMP  fast forward 18 months back into October 1529 after Cardinal Wolsey is sent into exile.
After two time travels back in time we rejoin the story at Esher Place. Short scene. Cromwell and Cavendish confer. No new characters.

Scene 18  Cromwell visits Anne Boleyn
York Place. Now Anne Boleyns residence. Musician Mark Smeatons face is shown again. As Cromwell approaches the women at the end of the hall, Annes dog in tow, we see Anne Boleyn center stage. On camera left and front is her sister Mary Boleyn. Behind Mary is Jane Seymour. Continuing clockwise there is Annes cousin Mary Shelton, and finally Annes sister-in-law Jane Rochford (Jane Boleyn), who is married to Annes brother George Boleyn.

[Mary Boleyn has already been revealed as the now former lover of the King. She has been set aside in favor of Anne. Diminutive Jane Seymour is of course destined to be the kings third wife. Mary Shelton has no real part in this series beyond being a lady-in-waiting. And Jane Rochford is generally an all-round nuisance. It is interesting to note that when Cromwell bows in greeting to Lady Anne he does not lower his eyes. Anne in return calls Cromwell Master Cremuel, a pronunciation that if not somewhat disrespectful in this moment, certainly will be in the future.

You really have to hand it to Mark Rylances Cromwell here his character never shows a glimmer of fear, even in front of the intimidating queen-to-be. Cromwell is also showing unflagging loyalty to his master, Cardinal Wolsey, which is a dangerous gambit. Still, Cromwell is guided by a force other than fear.]

Scene 19  Cromwell meets with Norfolk
Takes place in what appears to be Norfolks office in the court. No new characters, but we get a good whiff of Norfolk.

[Another opportunity for Cromwell to show his mettle to the aristocracy, this time in front of an angry soldier who, although aging, is a much larger man, and prone to violence. Its interesting to see Norfolk try and hate Cromwell for being an uppity person, yet at the very moment Norfolk, upon learning that Cromwell was a soldier, remarks I knew there was something I didn't like about you, you can almost see a hidden respect arising for Cromwell (at least thats the way I took how Bernard Hill emoted his Norfolk).

Scene 20  Cromwell meets with the king
Presumably In the gardens outside the court. The king approaches Cromwell, flanked by Norfolk and Suffolk. Behind them the only discernible characters are The Earl of Shrewsbury and Sir Harry Norris.

[The Earl of Shrewsbury is never seen again. Historically his daughter is married off to Harry Percy (the guy trying to get with Anne Boleyn earlier). Harry Norris is Chief of the King's Privy Chamber and a close friend of Henry. We will definitely see Norris again.

This is the audiences first real look at the king, and it happens moments before the episode ends. Henry attacks Cromwell verbally, and again Cromwell holds his ground, even sassing the king a bit. Here too you get a sense that in spite of the kings list of grievances against Cromwell (let alone the Cardinal), the king is impressed with the man. Its a wonderful exchange, and marks the beginning of Thomass work with the king.]",1463011200,2,13799,4.853793691389599

6969895,5,B00SB9SL3A,"I rewatch this series over and over and over and over - I am infatuated with the Tudor period in England. Between this, the Tudors, and the White Queen - I think those are the only shows I ever watch anymore. (matter of fact, now I'll likely turn it on and watch it again).

I find it interesting how many different takes on the story there are. Even if you throw the story of ""The other Boleyn Girl"" in there, this retelling is completely different - it's so hard to know what the real truth is - and I don't know that the historians really know a lot either. I do know that they try to keep as much as they can historically accurate, clothing was well suited, etc. I'm not sure Jane was represented to correctly, being name ""Wolf Hall"" one would think that it would be more along the lines of Jane Seymour's life and existence vs Anne Boleyns.

6969907,3,B00SB9SL3A,"The camera is mounted on Cromwell's shoulder and the series of even unfolds as he sees it.  So far so good.
I didn't like the actor's portrayal which makes this series very-very SLOW or slow-mo like in dialogue delivery and reactions, almost as though he was retarded.  I would have like a smart, foxy, cold, calculating Cromwell.  Instead what we get is slow, always thinking and not reacitng, very human cromwell whose reactions are so regressed and subdued that they almost are not present.  Unfortunately the actor's eyebrow do not do him any justice; it gives an impression of a dog who is perpectually looking for love and to slow to do anything, any scheming that the real Cromwell (who was queen maker for sure) would have done.
I love Damien Lewis's portrayal of the King.  He was awesome compared to the King portrayed by the Irish actor in Tudor (who was very capable but very young looking to span the entire life time of Henry the 8th).  Anne Boylen (actress who played) was very good as well...both the characters were well developed and had superb execution.",1460246400,2,1073,4.711229946524064

6969954,5,B00SB9SL3A,"This is one of the gems that you are lucky to see come on the screen during your lifetime.

I would not suggest this show to person whom are not familiar to the goings on in the period. Such as I would not suggest Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead as a movie to those who are not well versed in Hamlet.

This is an excellent adaptation to the every day life of the royal court. It starts with the costuming, which is filled by a cast that feels completely natural. I didn't realize how much it annoyed me that the Showtimes Tudors got wrong, until I saw Damien Lewis present himself as Great Harry himself. I cannot nor will I ever see anyone else in the role more fitting. I feel as passionately about Glenda Jackson's portrayal along with the most beloved Cate Blanchette and Helen Mirren. You are truly getting to witness something (excuse the phrase) majestic when you watch all the players on screen.

And I officially have a crush on Cromwell. The character is so powerful and well played by the subtle yet lethal Mark Rylance. I was first introduced to him in ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and I paid little mind to the man who played Anne's Father. I was a bit surprised to see him pop up again in this. Well that little man who played Anne's father now has my full and wrapped attention. I cannot get enough of his acting style. Its an absolutely joy to watch a stage actor make such a success across the screen. Bravo Mr. Rylance!

It is so gratifying to see a company actually get certain items correct for costuming from the period. They didn't go for SEXY they went for what was historically correct.

To those that argue about the riding boots being used at court, or the french hoods being transparent and mis-shapen, please understand that the costume department lost HALF of their work to fire just weeks prior to filming. There is no way to recover that kind of loss. (Please see link here to History Extra for an interview with one of the actors - [...] )

All I can say is that aside from the last Harry Potter Book coming out, I have not been so excited to see the 3 book from Miss Hilary Mantel's ever creative mind. Well done!",1456012800,3,2147,4.381909547738694

6969970,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Delved into the heart and soul of Thomas Cromwell. Was he a self-serving, heartless bastard or a man conflicted with the actions he had to do to survive in the court of King Henry VIII? This series shows a man of low birth who struggled to succeed and prosper in a world where your position in society determined everything in live. Conflicted in his heart but forced to maintain a bland and quiet exterior, Cromwell maneuvered a treacherous path and was a man who did what he had to do, as he was commanded by his king. This was a time when showing strong emotions or opinions could send you to your death. A dark, brooding production that more accurately shows the cruelty of life and the powerlessness of women some 500 years ago.",1455580800,5,733,4.477611940298507

6969972,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Really loved this series.  Nothing is black and white, nothing is simple, and everyone has layers and complexities that you'll never get to the end of if you had years to try.  Damian Lewis, who plays Henry the 8th, said during an interview that the most tragic thing about his character is that he killed the ones he loved.  By extension, Cromwell, played by Mark Rylance is doing the same thing for good or ill.  In this version Anne Boylen is no innocent heroinne, Thomas More no martyred saint, and Cromwell no sniveling villian.  This is not A Man for All Season or Anne of A Thousand Days.  I imagine that it is more true to life than those more romantic stories.  But it is in no way inferior.  The only thing I'll say is that the first episode is a little slow, but it only gets better from the second episode on.  This is not something for the Transformers and Ninja Turtles crowd.  More along the lines of Downton Abbey.",1455408000,2,930,4.385964912280702

This is not The Tudors.
What you do see is a show with great dialogue, wonderful acting, and fabulous costumes.  The locations used feel authentic and unlike other shows set in this period, the locations are dark and cluttered and actually feel lived in.  Great effort had to have been spent in making or finding the props and preparing the interiors.  Normally I am not a wardrobe guy, but the clothes were so elaborate and intricate, and a fortune must have been spent on costumes. I have never watched a show prior to this one where I felt the locations and the wardrobes added so much to the experience.  For me it really made the show come to life.

The acting is superb across the board, but Rylance (Cromwell) and Foy (Ann Boleyn) were particularly good.  The dialogue can be difficult to follow at times, and it can be difficult to know which character is being referred to, so it does help to be at least somewhat familiar with the story before watching.  The first episode may move slowly for some, but this does pick up so be sure to watch at least through the second show before you judge the series.

Lest anyone think otherwise, the focus of this series of Cromwell, his rise from the ghetto to become King Henry's most powerful adviser and manager. But with a King like Henry, one should always take care of becoming too important and necessary in his life; his ego rejects anyone who dares share or eclipse his light. Episode 3 is an important turning point in the series, when we see Cromwell turn into the King's pit bull who brings to heel those who damn the King's marriage to Anne Boleyn and his self-appointment as head of the Church of England.

It captures the unique role Cromwell plays in history; ambitious, even ruthless, to a fault;  a devoted father and loyal friend; and the commoner who manipulated the vanity of Henry VIII to advance freedom of thought and conscience in the West perhaps more than  anyone before or since.  Rylance's Cromwell bears the weight of the sacrifices made in service to such a horrible man as Henry and a noble a cause as religious liberty without melodrama.

6970080,5,B00SB9SL3A,"One friend of mine said that the scenes in this series are framed like Vermeer paintings, but more than that: both Mantel's novels and the series based upon it show a complex man worthy of Greek tragedy. His character leads him to put his own ""neck into the strap of fate"" as the chorus in Agamemnon would phrase it. Setting off Cromwell and More as foils for each other heightens both the conditional (but compassionate, as Mantel sees it) morality of Cromwell and the more courageous but crueler, rigid certainty of Thomas More. This makes both More and Cromwell tragic figures but rescues More from the hagiography of popular opinion and makes him a much more complex and interesting character. Lovely book.

Always interested in English history, I found this series much different compared to the Tudors and the portrayal of Cromwell. In each, they are vastly different in character, as well as other well-known characters such as Thomas More. (Albeit Jeremy Northam was much more handsome in The Tudors.) Like anything else about this era, heads roll and religious differences are the topics of the day. Thomas Cromwell in this version is more of a philosopher, of sorts, to Henry. The main problem for me was that I couldn't wrap my head around the characters who were rather dull.  In the end, poor Ann is beheaded, and the series comes to an end. As history will recall, next in line is Thomas Cromwell himself after his failed attempt to fix up Henry with wife #4 after Jane Seymour dies.",1448841600,,862,4.597402597402597

He and Henry are the only two Actors that fit their roles. All the other main characters were not nearly as convincing. The series is very slow moving and if you did not read the books or know that era's history it could be confusing. The costumes and the settings are historically accurate.

I would put this production ahead of anything else that's been done previously about this era.

The acting is entirely excellent, especially Mark Rylance whose deadly quiet, performance steals every scene, and the script is tight and itelligent. But it's deliberately lacking in fireworks. There are no big actorish moments, mercifully very little violence, a minimal score, and the colour palette is extremely muted, but beautiful. But although this story has been seen many times it's the way this is done which sets it apart. I took a while to warm to it, and the first episide is so dark it's hard to see what's going on, but by the second episode I was totally hooked. A couple of the female performances seen a little modern, and there are some very average CGI backgrounds, but that's a minor quibble.

The thing is, these days we are spoiled with so much good material, riveting suspense, above average acting and writing etc., so my guess is if you are not familiar with the story and some of the surrounding characters and context, it might not grip you, which would be a pity. It starts a little slow and some actors don't have much screen time in order to establish their stake in the story. Thomas More resigns before we even know what he is about.

Impossible to imagine anyone other than Mark Rylance in the lead role; perfect supporting cast, notably Damian Lewis as Henry and Claire Foy as Anne Boleyn.  The political backdrop, the theological wrangles and the courtly intrigues can get a little murky from time to time, but it all comes clear in the end.  Forget about The Tudors!

I felt like I knew this story backwards and forwards and had even read the book and wasn't wowed by it. Ho hum. I happened upon the DVD at the library and decided to give it a try. I was completely amazed by this series. At first, Mr Rylance's soft spoken monotone puzzled me, but then I got it. From what little I know about Cromwell the man, I wouldn't describe myself as a fan, but truly felt empathy for him by the end. Clare Foy's overly petulant Queen in the first episodes also irritated me, but by the end I was in awe of her. What a performance! I applaud Masterpiece for bringing us such a well written, expertly directed and wonderfully acted series. Between this and ""Poldark"" they really outdid themselves this season.

6970299,5,B00SB9SL3A,"The well known story of Henry and Anne is given here with context. The role of Anne's family, the Boleyns, adds meaning to her desire to become queen. They are players in the aristocracy. Her uncle wants more power.

Another clarification is the role of Tyndale and his Bible. Thomas Cromwell, the main character, acquires Tyndale's Bible. He attends secret meetings with other readers. He appeals to his wife to read it. He defends friends who are arrested and burned for heresy. Cromwell becomes an enemy of Thomas More who is burning heretics. The subplot of the conflict of More and Cromwell adds depth.

Cromwell rebukes one who wants to get rid of Wolsey for More: ""Wolsey burned Bibles - More will burn men!"" Cromwell's investigations of the monasteries and their dissolution is justified by their corruption. Anne is a known supporter of Tyndale.

This background of religious change reveals a facet to these events that is often overlooked. The presentation of Elizabeth Barton, a catholic mystic, who prophesies against Anne, shows the opposite feeling compared to Cromwell. Religion was a driving force at that time. The idea of a nation state had not even been invented.

This drama presents the outlook of such a time with more integrity than usual. Cromwell rebukes an aristocrat who thinks he can ignore Cromwell. Cromwell's threat is that he can instruct his lenders to call in all his loans and destroy his life. This was the change from a society based on privilege to one based on money. Cromwell understood this sooner than others.

 Cromwell wanted to break the Catholic Church in England. He persuaded others to support the breakup of the monastery, not for religious reasons (Cromwell's reason) but to get the money. These religious motives are not forced, but presented simply as part of the thinking that leads to the final dramatic conclusion.

Another key theme is the focus on the Emperor. He is Katherine's uncle and has captured the pope. Will he invade England? What should Henry say and do? Ally with France? Marry into French royalty? This preoccupation with the emperor gives insight that creates interest.

I enjoyed it and will rewatch in years to come.",1441843200,2,2189,4.94550408719346

6970484,5,B00SB9SL3A,"After the historical disappointment that was The Tudors, I'm guessing anything else would seem like a godsend. However, even without the comparison, Wolf Hall would still be worthy of 5 stars.

The most retold story in the history of the monarchy told from the perspective of arguably the most despised man in British history. Compared to The Tudors or The Other Boleyn Girl, there was very little literary license taking place, which I'm grateful for. The series centered around great storytelling, anchored by marvelous acting that didn't need cheap theatrics and redundant sex scenes to keep the audience engaged.

I will say that there is a very good chance that I am biased because I've long since suspected that our views of Cromwell and More weren't accurate in that More wasn't as saintly as Robert Bolt (A Man for All Seasons) would have us believe, nor was Cromwell as demonic as has been held. The fact that Wolf Hall portrays Cromwell as highly loyal (if not more than a tad amoral) and More as an overly pious, misguided soft spoken heretic did play well for me. History has always sided with More because he has been seen as the man who was willing to die for religious conviction, but oftentimes his dogged pursuit (read that as hounding) and torture of anything and anyone he deemed anti-Catholic has been swept under the rug. Instead, Wolf Hall shined a spotlight on the shockingly anti-Christian things he did in the name of faith. I liked that.

If there was one issue I had, it was how few and far between we saw Anne and Henry. I totally get why, as we are meant to see events unfolding through Cromwell's eyes, but Henry and Anne were portrayed so well, I longed to see more.

A well known history told through the eyes of man most often simply villainized and otherwise overlooked, but a man who started very humbly, and through perseverance, self-motivation and indeed a good deal of self interested double dealing, rose to become one of the most powerful men in one of the most legendary English Royal courts. Thomas Cromwell has rarely (if ever) been portrayed as more than a one-dimensional Machiavellian sort whose spectacular downfall was nothing more or less than his just deserts. While i cannot say i ever found Cromwell likable, I gained a bit more sympathy for this historic personage, a commoner who had a profound impact in English politics and history.

DON'T bother spending 50% more for HD because it just isn't going to happen!  Amazon won't tell you this, they will just pocket the $.

I watched this in the UK and I'm back for another visit.  I've learned that some of the sites where this was filmed are open to the public so I wanted to watch the series again before I investigated the actual buildings.

6970658,5,B00SB9SL3A,"I read Hilary Mantels two novels about Thomas Cromwell soon after they were published: ""Wolf Hall"" in 2009 and ""Bring Up the Bodies"" in 2012. I watched the TV series on PBS/USA in Spring 2015. In conspiracy scenes, I had trouble hearing the whispered dialogue so I re-read both novels. Much of the witty dialogue from the novels was transferred verbatim into the dramatization.
I watched the DVD in July 2015, three disks in three days!  I especially liked the Special Features: interviews with on-screen and off-screen participants. First of all, I clicked on Claire Foy, but her intonation (not the volume) so often went from low to high to low that I scarcely caught what she said. I had no trouble understanding the male speakers. The comment that the mini-series is a revenge tragedy unified the action for me. Cromwell takes revenge on those who caused Cardinal Wolseys downfall. By the laws of the genre, Cromwell must be punishedas he will be in the last novel of the trilogy. Other illuminating comments: Wolsey was a surrogate father to Cromwell; Cromwell was a surrogate older-brother to King Henry.
I enjoyed the interview with Mark Gatiss (Stephen Gardiner), but regret that no interview was shown of Anton Lesser (Thomas More). Both actors appear in a table scene (1530) at Mores home. In the novel (""Wolf Hall,"" pp. 188-92), More does not speak of Luther, but in the dramatizations More gives his opinion in Latin with a subtitle: Luther is the anus of the world. I could not find this phrase in Mores ""Responsio ad Lutherum"" (1523), but I found quite a few references to stercus (s***). In the TV version, the camera focuses on Mores daughter Margaret, who had received a Latin education but who now studiously ignores her fathers impropriety. In the DVD version the camera focuses on Gardiner, who as a cleric knows Latin and cant hide his shock at the gross metaphor. Every scene in the series would repay such close analysis.",1437004800,,1944,4.820359281437126

In the series, this theme and tone are effectively woven into a more straightforward, linear narrative than the novel while maintaining Mantel's story and interpretation of the times-- no easy task.",1436832000,,491,5.4605263157894735

The characters are so vaguely drawn I could hardly tell one from the next, the plot unfolds so slowly  I quickly  stopped caring what might happen next. Making such a high-stakes piece of history terminally boring is an real accomplishment. It is everything people hate about historical dramas and must have turned off millions to ever watching another one. Makes you realize over and over just how good the Tudors is, driven by human emotion, life and death decisions, and the terrific acting of Meyers as the  high-energy and deadly king Henry. Give it to that crew. This could hardly be worse than it is-whatever was the director thinking ? Perhaps he too is one hundred years old and snoozing his way through the last days of his life.

The series follows the books very closely, telling the story of Thomas Cromwell, King Henry VIII's advisor.  A very interesting story that I was totally unaware of.  I knew of Cromwell, but not his part in the course of British history.  Unfortunately, I knew the ending of many of the characters (Anne Boleyn, Wolsey, Cromwell), but it didn't ruin the story.  Especially liked the details of the setting and costumes which I presume was authentic.  Who knew they ate with their hands back then??",1435363200,,577,4.72
6970790,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Why even write the 463rd review for Wolf Hall? To encourage the makers and producers, Masterpiece, and PBS to make more of this type historical drama. I bought it because the story is so complicated between characters personalities and the history so intriguing that it is a series that must be viewed multiple times. Being historical drama, it will never go out of style.

I'm not a Brit history specialist, to be honest; I've learned most of my Brit political history from shows like Wolf Hall. This takes a new look at Henry VIII, but from the perspective of the greedy scheming life of Cromwell (Mark Rylance- `The Other Boleyn Girl'). This story brings the life and times of the early 16th century to life, realistically. The realistic period candle-lit picture is reminiscent of Rembrandt oils (although the artist was a century later, and Dutch.)

6970804,4,B00SB9SL3A,This series pretty much faithfully follows the trajectory of Hillary Mantel's Wolf Hall.

6970806,3,B00SB9SL3A,"Loved both books but the series left much to be desired.  Of course, it's impossible to accurately represent two complete novels in a few hours of television.  And I think if one had not read the books and/or knew the Tudor history very well, it would have been very difficult to follow the plot and differentiate the characters.  Also, so much of the novels is centered on Cromwell's internal life and interior monologues, which just don't translate well to a visual medium.

6970833,1,B00SB9SL3A,"A real snooze fest.  I tried, I really really tried, to sit through one complete episode (my hubby lasted all of ten minutes before he walked out of the room).  I realize that historical series made for television often contain many errors and play with the truth quite a bit.  This is fine as long as one does not take his/her history lessons from these made for entertainment productions.  As a historian, I found it unwatchable;  it just did not catch my attention at all.  The decision to film this in basically muted colors was not quite the best decision.  Add to this an inaccurate depiction of Cromwell in particular, and it becomes a boring mess.

I will give credit to the actor who portrayed Henry and a successful attempt to show him as he changed through time.  It looks like his portraits were given quite a bit of scrutiny and the result shows.

All in all, one must not expect a historical series based on a novel to be the most accurate study available.  But they could have at least spiced this one up visually in order to keep one's eye on the screen.  Cannot recommend.",1435276800,,1089,4.472081218274112

I enjoyed it even more the second time, catching a lot of things I had missed the first time around. Being able to turn on the subtitles helps, too, for parts where people mumble with foreign accents.

Have not yet read the second book but have re-watched the DVDs -- it has all made more sense to me having read those portions.

Still if you haven't read the book you would still enjoy the DVDs.  The acting by all was superb.  Henry the 8th didn't quite seem to be the tyrant that history has written so much about but by the end... his true colors were definitely showing and he really is a tyrant!  In this day and age he would've been strung up by his toes and castrated by his wives as these young actresses do come across as strong women. :)  Mark Rylance did an excellent job of portraying Thomas Cromwell.",1434585600,,876,4.57051282051282

Mark Rylance's Cromwell is a tornado held inside a pressure cooker - intense internal emotion and struggle with only the subtlest of outward signs.

This is an intelligent production with wonderful subtledty. I was a bit surprised by the nastiness of Anne Boleyn portrayed here, as well by the serenity of Thomas Cromwell. All very thought-provoking.
I was unaware of the severity of the king's accident, and had to look that up. Wonderful to have this collection. I purchased the first episode on Amazon and watched the rest on PBS but plan to complete the set for watching again later.
History and Period Drama fans will really love this. It was based on a novel, even though it is presented like a biography.
The only criticism is the way the flashbacks are ordered. I generally don't mind one or two in a long production, but they are a little confusing when no context is given.

6971001,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Hilary Mantel's original novels are the brilliant foundation for this engrossing and revisionist portrayal of the ever-popular Tudor era. The television series succeeds in doing what television can do best  stripping away much of the complexity and nuance in order to foreground certain concerns and ideas, thus complementing the reading of the original texts.

This is not to say that the series is simplistic. We are aware that it is a particular interpretation of history and of those characters. What is necessarily lost by the adaptation to a different medium encourages us to consider the constructedness of our historical knowledge and the incompleteness and provisional nature of knowledge.

And it is wonderful viewing. To watch the episodes one after the other in quick succession shows how the series builds tension and momentum. The acting is superb, each character comes to life brilliantly and succintly. The themes are sharply delineated. My favourite was the consistent critique of the nobility and the portrayal of conflict between those with a born to rule attitude and those like Cromwell who have humble beginnings and risen through their own worth. Another aspect which particularly appealed to me was the depiction of Thomas More, the 'blood-soaked hypocrite', so antithetical to the sentimental hagiography of A Man For All Seasons.

This series gives us a vivid historical picture of Henry Vlll who is served by Thomas Cromwell, a man of humble beginnings, who became King Henry's chief advisor. Brilliantly played by Mark Rylance, Cromwell is shown to be a practical, shrewd, and highly intelligent aid to Henry Vlll, a man who is guided and moved by lust and power rather than common sense and morality. The lighting of the interiors is realistically portrayed----we see many of the interior scenes played and filmed in almost total darkness, giving us a true sense of how people managed their daily lives in accordance with sunlight, moonlight, and candle light.",1433721600,,653,5.0

6971074,3,B00SB9SL3A,"An otherwise excellent production reduced to a 3 star rating.  The fist few minutes were ruined by erratic and meaningless cutting.  Why did the director make  Thomas Cromwell  a mono-faceted individual?  Cromwell was the original 'Mr Fixit,'  the energy  required to be everywhere at once, and his chequered career, bespeak a man of enormous energy.

The prolonged silences became too self-indulgent, almost to the point of humour. Good actors deserve better tan this.
Henry V111 was superb, as was Anne Boylen.

One final squawk from the peanut gallery....Why, oh why all the ill-fitting boots???  King Henry V111 in droopy boots. Never
! In those days they had good bootmakers.

The actors were brilliant, except where the director interfered",1433635200,3,745,5.228813559322034
6971075,5,B00SB9SL3A,"As an American, I am a little envious of the British for producing such a work of art for the screen.  The story, characters, dialogue were all very well done.  Special bow to Ms Hilary Mantel, who wrote on the novels on which ""Wolf Hall"" is based.  Because of the usually low quality of entertainment, I avoid it often.  But this six-episode series is truly worth watching closely, several times.  I am glad that I bought a series to enjoy.

Addendum:  The acting is truly brilliant.  Watching Henry VIII gradually become a tyrant, and draw evil out of those around him, is a highly important lesson in politics.  The character who begins as so sympathetic, and one sees darknesses arise, is the highly gifted Thomas Cromwell, played so convincingly by Mark Rylance.  Some lines spoken in this series--always audible, even for an elderly American with poor hearing--are especially profound and memorable.  Very highly recommended.

Told from King Henry's right hand man Thomas Cromwell (Mark Rylance), the story reveals the political maneuvering and back-stabbings that lead to the rise of the Church of England as well as the rise and sudden free-fall of Anne Boleyn (Claire Foy). The supporting cast is just as good and each episode keeps your attention without missing a beat.

When I first viewed the BBC/PBS versions, my mind went back to 1981 when Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy showed on PBS.  The day of the first episode, a reviewer for the local newspaper praised the series to the heavens but cautioned viewers that it was not James Bond; that the plot was intricate, slow moving, and at times difficult to follow; and that they would need to pay attention.  Substitute The Tudors for James Bond, and that portion of 1981 review would apply to Wolf Hall. Don't prepare for the familiar and you shouldn't be disappointed.",1433376000,,642,4.8090909090909095
6971098,5,B00SB9SL3A,"One of the best television productions I have ever seen. As a history buff, I rarely ever become so engrossed in a program due to all of the cheap sets and ridiculous costumes.

The costumes were top-notch as well.",1433376000,2,378,4.338028169014085
6971099,4,B00SB9SL3A,"The Tudor period has always been one of my favorite ones for the drama (without any changes or additions from those who feel that it wasn't all enough) and the changes that it produced in the world.  I honestly was not sure I liked this way of looking at it because I'm so used to the hyper dramatic and super ""sexy"" versions that we usually get.  But it's grown on me and I honestly can say I like it.  It's a slow and quiet way of giving us a close look at a man who was a pivotal part of all that was going on.  If you watch this and then go back and watch all the other versions of the Tudor story, you will definitely have a different perspective on Cromwell",1433376000,,663,4.0
6971100,5,B00SB9SL3A,"In recent years I've found myself often disappointed by the great institution of British drama, and more specifically in this case, historical drama.  However, with Wolf Hall they have single handedly won back my respect and admiration.  This a beautiful, elegant and delicately made 6 part mini series.  Absent of shallow plot and characters that are beefed up with pointless drivel to keep the attention of our ADD minds.  This oozes depth in both the writing and performances that are handed to us with a gentle sense of respect.  Mark Rylance delivers a stunning lead performance as Thomas Cromwell (Adviser to Henry VIII).  I don't recommend looking away for a second as it is in his silent moments that he offers a deeply layered performance, with a truly brilliant supporting cast that keeps pace with the impressive lead.
If you are looking for a testosterone driven, bodice popping, ""Can we fit a car chase in here?"" sort of program then this is not for you.  If you're looking for intelligent, subtle, engaging historic drama, then this will surely please and exceed your expectations.

I had to wait about 2 weeks for the episode to show up on Prime, but once it did, it was my first-ever order of a Prime program. I was impressed the video only had to buffer twice during the entire hour-long presentation. Once at the 29-minute mark and again at the 47-minute mark. Buffering only caused about a 5-second pause in the action. I actually figured out how to connect my laptop via its serial port to a serial port on our HDTV so I was able to watch ""Wolf Hall"" on our large TV. The image was just as good as watching previous episodes through my DVR, but I did use a HD connector at the end of the serial wire that went into the TV. Somehow I had an extra one lying around, so lucky me. I found ""Wolf Hall"" to be a historically accurate depiction of the social mores of Tudor times & the acting was sublime on the part of all the lead actors. I may have to also order it on DVD. I normally do not purchase DVDs, but this show I'd like to see again in the future. 5-stars to Amazon Prime and 5-Stars for ""Wolf Hall.""",1432598400,2,1200,4.046218487394958

Perhaps that is only because, except for Keith Michell and Richard Burton, the king has always been portrayed by unattractive actors. The history here is rich, and the feeling that nobody in that kingdom is safe is with you throughout the story. The Anne Boleyn here is almost completely unsympathetic, except at the end, when you know she is being railroaded to her death with lies and false accusations. She is so haughty and unkind for so much of the story that you almost have no pity for her, but then, you do. The actress playing her is excellent. What treachery!

6971380,3,B00SB9SL3A,"This story is so false.

First of all, there is no record of Anne ever seeing Mary after she started her relationship with Henry. Why? Because Anne had to distance herself from her sister Mary. All documentation shows that she never saw Mary after she returned to England from France.
Second, Anne was an extremely religious woman. She was never seen without her Book of Hours. The fact was, this English version of the bible was against the law at that time in England and she could have been put to death for having it in her possession.
Henry's and Anne had a seven years relationship before they married. I always find it strange in films when they make it appear short. The fact was, Henry madly in love with Anne. There's a book of his love letters he wrote her.

As for Cromwell's relationship with Mary, that never existed.  Cromwell was interested in marring Jane Seymour.

But I watched. For me it's hard to get excited about ANOTHER Henry the VIIIth show.  Tudors' actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers, will always reign supreme in my mind as Henry VIII, but the whole tale is old in the telling.... it's gotten like Camelot & King Arthur.  Enough already can't they move on to something NEW!?!?!
If you watch it, I guess watch for the spin on Cromwell.  As Cromwell in Tudors, James Frain was very evil and hated.  In Wolf Hall, it spins a whole new dimension on Cromwell.  I found Wolf Hall's Cromwell played by Mark Rylance the only interesting thing in the tv series.  The women were horribly boring.",1431561600,,760,4.4963503649635035
6971469,2,B00SB9SL3A,"If you believe  that every British drama on Masterpiece Theater is, well, a masterpiece; that British actors are all great; and  that the fifth season of DOWNTON ABBEY was as compelling as the first three; then you may love WOLF HALL, and cannot wait for season two.  I found  this drama dreary, boring and technically almost unwatchable because of the poor lighting. The story of Henry VIII, his marital  problems and the Crown's need for a male heir has been told many times on stage, film and TV.  Most memorable is Robert Bolt's play A MAN FOR ALL SEASON,  successfully brought to film in 1966 with Paul Scofield as Sir Thomas More siding with the Papacy over the Crown and Leo McKern as a dynamic, ferocious Thomas Cromwell  willing to condemn More to the executioner  so Henry VIII (played by Robert Shaw) can marry his mistress Anne Bolyen. While too stagey and intellectual for some, what carried the film  was the superb acting by all and a highly literate script.

As written WOLF HALL centers around Thomas Cromwell, who appears in almost all the scenes and so both the character and the actor playing him--Mark Rylance--must carry the drama.  And this is where it fails. In WOLF HALL  Thomas Cromwell is an ambitious, manipulative but cautious lawyer displaying little emotion as he goes about his evil business. Evil and manipulative characters can carry a drama, but not here. Too often Cromwell sounds like a lawyer talking to a client or potential defendant: not much interesting talk worth hearing from episode to episode.  A good deal of the shortcomings in this drama also rests with the actor.playing Cromwell.  Mark Rylance delivers his dialog in a raspy, monotone voice. I found the acting stiff, but perhaps commensurate with the requirements of the character as written. Nevertheless, I could not develop much empathy or interest in Cromwell, his difficulties or the manipulations he uses to achieve his goals. Finally, the scenic lighting was murky and not enhancing the viewing experience. Masterpiece Theater dramas are known for their historically accurate sets, but the lighting  director may have gone too far. The scenes here are so poorly lighted, as if only by candles, that the characters are barely recognizable. All in all, for this viewer WOLF HALL is not worth a second watch or a second season.",1431475200,4,2333,4.913265306122449

6971540,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Five stars for WOLF HALL's production, script, and performances.  Damian Lewis's indomitable Henry VIII is smashing.  Mark Rylance's mesmeric Cromwell is riveting.  A few quibbles:  People who knew Cromwell claimed he was charming as well as shrewd; he's portrayed in WOLF HALL as a grim, if resourceful, Machiavel.  Regarding WOLF HALL's attention to history:  Cromwell is credited with devising the legal framework for Establishment of the English Church and Henry's Supremacy over it, which achievement is downplayed by WOLF HALL, which, in turn, invites dismissal of Anne Boleyn as an ambitious shrew.  There is another theory of Anne:  It posits that she supported the Reformation, but not Anglicanism, that she was executed for religious incorrectness as much as for failure to produce a son.  As long as the Church of England remains the Church of England, it seems likely that Cromwell, one of the Church's founding fathers, will be regarded by British writers as a towering figure, a la WOLF HALL, while Anne is dismissed as a pitiable interloper.",1431043200,2,1056,5.201183431952662

6971564,5,B00SB9SL3A,"This superb dramatization based on Hillary Mantel's award winning books WOLF HALL and BRING UP THE BODIES finally lends accurate depiction the often dramatized battles for power within the court of Henry VIII.  Until now, the character of Cromwell has emerged as a servile ""tattle tale"" and torturing monster entirely without scruple and values.  Finally, he is given just assessment.  It was, after all, Cromwell's relentless fights to save and give comfort to his fallen, dying master -- Cardinal Wolsey -- during 1530 that demonstrated his integrity, courage and ability.  Wolf Hall shows how a capable administrator experienced in fiscal affairs and power politics was able to manage and maneuver an entire court full of puffed up aristocrats before they knew what hit them.  Spies, covert operations and manipulation of Parliament in order to bend others to the King's will show how modern states have come to create and mask of normalcy that can make and break the unwary and arrogant.  ---  Cromwell and Sir Thomas More are both treated fairly in this depiction and at last, More is not allowed to escape responsibility for the cruelties inflicted on ""heretics"" in his name and by him over many years.  A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS painted More as a saintly person, without guile while all of the cruelty and torture were  ascribed to a villainous, one dimensional Cromwell character.  Fairness has finally been restored.  Cromwell and Cranmer were, definitely, indispensable architects of the English Reformation and also of England's emergence as a modern power escaping from the clutches of the larger continental powers (France and Spain) and Rome.",1430956800,13,1652,5.149812734082397

I feel I'm being given a sense of how real people might have thought and struggled in that period. It's also a pivotal moment when the power of the Church was being challenged. I find the usual Royal dramas to be off putting but in this one the perspective is that of a blacksmith's son. It is more realistic, less grandiose. Nonetheless, fantastic clothes. Such hats! And plenty of erotic undercurrents. Sometimes the characters seem to mumble. It could be the accents. That is the only flaw in my view.",1430956800,,592,4.59433962264151
6971585,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Wolf Hall is a highly intelligent, superbly nuanced adaptation of Hilary Mantel's stunning book. The film is not a study in extremes such as black and white, good and evil, but a subtle study in shades of grey. It embraces the underbelly of the Tudor Court where the mechanics of  governing the country grind.

The atmosphere of England in sixteenth century of Wolf Hall is wonderfully embracing,  The ambiance will take you right in. The dark, gloomy nights lit only by candlelight almost make you want to watch your back, in the gloom an enemy could be lurking right there, behind the drape. In the daytime no sunshine enters the small windows and outside the sun does not sparkle, the shadows are misty. Wolf Hall is never exuberant. The camera often follows a person from the rear-in a dark cape he may like a crow. It is interesting that the back of an individual speaks as much as the front- the position of the hands, the tilt of the neck,  a rapid or slow gait, even the mood...I have never seen a camera perform this trick so often. In one scene it follows Cromwell and a crony, both dressed in black riding on dark brown horses. Sort of a sea in darkness on a bleak day. I know there is a metaphor here and I ponder it.

Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell brings a great deal of nuance into the role, his dark eyes always watchful. He is not inscrutable, the thin mouth often hovering in the ghost of a smile as he goes about performing his tasks as principal minister to Henry VIII. He is immensely likable and if the real Thomas Cromwell was not likable it matters not.  Who are we to say? The plot revolves around him and you see him tete a tete with many famous sixteenth century characters. I read that there are 102 characters in the series- they fit seamlessly into the story because a master hand, is directing them.

Claire Foy is perfect as Anne Boleyn, capturing her brittleness, her bravado. She is obliged to walk a tight rope controlled by Henry and she is fully aware that if she doesn't produce a son her life as Queen is over. Her distress is palpable but she takes great pains to conceal it, often acting haughty.

Thomas Wolsey like Thomas Cromwell hasn't been treated kindly by history and usually appears greedy and self-serving and yet he earned his accumulation of wealth including a palace,  as rewards for his services to Henry. Jonathan Pryce as the Cardinal, like the film portrayal of Thomas Cromwell, is a well rounded personality, sensitive and loyal to the King. But he cannot convince the Pope to declare the marriage between Henry and Katherine of Aragon  annulled.  And so Henry VIII pulls the plug and the Cardinal is stripped of earthly glory. You see him at the end of his life shuffling slowly along, his red robe no longer a symbol of power. You feel for him.

Damian Lewis makes a fine King Henry with his (genuine) red beard, his aristocratic mien, his arrogance, his mercurial temper, his power. He often has a diabolic grin on his face that is close to snarling. When Henry is on stage, metaphorically speaking, nobody else is. He is the magnet that draws all attention. However, in one amusing scene Henry falls asleep at the dinner table. There is an immediate hush as none of the diners dares to wake him for fear of a reprisal. Finally a girl taps his arm and Henry comes to, remarking he has just been resting his eyes, and all is well, but the relief around the table is palpable. When Henry is present the air seems electric, wired, almost turbulent.

Although a small role, that of Mary Boleyn, Anne's sister, gives  the story piquancy and charm. And as Mary actress Charity Wakefield with her snub nose and mischievous smile often banters with Cromwell. She has been dumped by Henry VIII who saw a better catch in Anne Boleyn, but Mary is relieved to be off the royal hook, she laughs at Anne and she likes Cromwell. Plenty of chemistry between the two even if it comes to naught.

One very important aspect of Wolf Hall is the character and portrayal of Thomas More, who was made a saint by the Catholic Church in 1940. Hilary Mantel is an outspoken anti-Catholic and More (played ably by Anton Lesser) becomes in the film adaptation of the book a cruel, hypocritical prig who actually enjoys attending burnings at the stake of Protestant heretics. While historically More has been regarded as somewhat of a hero in his courageous stand against Henry's divorce and Cromwell has the reputation of a villain, both men were creatures of their time and behaved as such and neither could be called scrupulous. Whatever the reader's feelings are on this subject, it is best to let sleeping dogs lie and enjoy this splendid series for what it is: a very fine drama",1430870400,19,4717,4.565680473372781

So I will go deeper, only because I love Damien Lewis.",1430438400,,424,4.794520547945205
6971636,4,B00SB9SL3A,"Impressive depiction of the Hilary Mantel novels about Thomas Cromwell, right-hand man to Henry VIII during the turmoil surrounding the monarch's desire for a son, and the lengths he's willing to go to in order to ensure the succession. Thomas, who is often mocked by courtiers for being a commoner, manages to navigate the treacherous waters of the Tudor court with unswerving ambition and loyalty to the needs of the king. He eventually brings down the powerful Boleyn family; we learn early on that he's had a grudge against them for years, which makes his ultimate vindication a quiet triumph. In fact, Thomas is a subdued character, keeping his face deliberately still to hide the thoughts and feelings that could endanger him if known. The sainted Thomas More does not come off well in this version of events, especially in his brutal treatment of suspected heretics. The acting is superb, not just Mark Rylance as Cromwell, but also Damian Lewis, who gives a bravura performance as the accomplished but mercurial Henry VIII. Special mention must be made of Philippe Spall's cameo as the French executioner brought in especially for Anne Boleyn's beheading. He and Claire Foy, as Anne, made this one of the most powerful and moving portrayals of this tragic event I've seen in many filmed interpretations of this scene. This series is not to be missed by those who appreciate well-presented historical fiction.",1430438400,6,1416,5.029787234042553
6971637,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Rarely do we find excellence in historical video fiction. ""Wolf Hall"" is outstanding in every way. As a fan of ""A Man for All Seasons,"" ""Wolf Hall"" takes a more realistic approach in showing the weaknesses of all the parties involved in the church crisis of Henry VIII. Thomas More is shown as he was, a zealot willing to torture and execute those who disagreed with him. Yet as More is imprisoned, we have sympathy for him as we certainly do for the main focus, Thomas Cromwell. The production values are excellent, acting is flawless and the story is riveting. While ""Wolf Hall"" will not do for the Marvels movie crowd, it is a treasure for those who want to understand this period of history or just watch a brilliant tale of intrigue and suspense.

UPDATE: I made a mistake in writing this review before I viewed the final episode. I stand by my review and the five stars, but the last episode maybe disturbing to those who are more sensitive. There are no holds barred as Cromwell has to face the consequences of his desire for power and influence. This gives ""off with her head"" a sobering reality.",1430438400,10,1104,4.547738693467337

6971687,2,B00SB9SL3A,"A great disappointment that is nobody's fault except for the person who decided two books by Hillary Mantel - ""Wolf Hall"" and ""Bringing Up the Bodies"" - would translate well into a scripted version for television.  (Or for the stage.  I saw the Royal Shakespeare Company's two part ""Wolf Hall in NYC recently and was equally disappointed.)  The books are fascinating and exciting reading because they have the time to explore the history of the history, and the complexities and convolutions of that period of British history during which Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, Cardinal Wolsey and hundreds of others played out their lives.  The books have time for everything - the backgrounds, the scenery, the manners and modes, the costumes, the religious beliefs, the weather, the wars.  Without all of that, the television version is nothing but stilted and boring conversation.  Damian Lewis (as Henry) and Mark Rylance (as Cromwell) are two of my favorite actors in theater, film and television.  But - I hate to say it, but I know you want the truth - they are both so wrong in this.  Mark Rylance, a brilliant actor who has won theater awards galore, is too old and elegant to be Cromwell.  And poor Damian misses the mixture in Henry of royalty and rogue.  Lewis's Henry struts the ""stage"" as if he's modeling Coco Chanel on a runway.

Henry VIII built a chain of coastal artillery forts to protect against invasion. Deal Castle is a good example of one of these forts. He also had the idea of placing cannon aboard warships. A strong navy was a counter-move to the larger armies that could be fielded by geographically larger more populous nations such as Spain and France. Making cannon, gunpowder, and warships is very expensive. At first cannon were made of brass. The cannon were ruinously expensive. Later, a way was found of making cannon of iron. A Tudor iron foundry was located at Ashdown Forest. Wish they had included a scene showing Cromwell talking to Henry VIII as he viewed his new cannon.

Nevertheless, I decided to watch the series. I was rather bored with the first episode, but chose to watch ensuing episodes. I found Mr. Raylance's portrayal of Cromwell growing on me, and, indeed, so too the series as a whole. I must say, though, that I continue to find Damian Lewis' portrayal of Henry VIII rather low key for such a notoriously flamboyant character. Whether this is a product of the writing, directing or acting...or a combination, is a matter of conjecture, but it is a bit strange. I would remind other viewers to keep in mind that the oft, formerly seen obese, near-cartoon-like portrayal of Henry is very misleading. Holbein's portrait, which would seem to be the basis for such  portrayals, was painted rather late in Henry's life. In his youth, he was slender, athletic and handsome, and didn't become heavy until his late forties. At the time of his marriage to Anne Boleyn (1533), he was still, at 42, in relatively decent physical condition.

6971787,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Am savoring every minute of this journey through the most terrifying part of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn's infamous story; a story that, this time, unfolds as we sit on the shoulder of Thomas Cromwell and watch in gobsmacked amazement.  Have heard a few complaints that the tempo is too slow, but I am thoroughly enjoying this slower pace as compared to The Tudors (a great series, too) where everyone was running about and shrieking and sexing and chopping off heads at breakneck speed.

What I find most fascinating about kings and queens is not the royalty themselves per se, but rather the machinations and chicanery by everyone swirling about these all-powerful, egomaniacal heads of states.  If I had to ask for anything more from Wolf Hall, it would have been to start a bit earlier in history, letting us see more of Cardinal Wolsey's master manipulations for himself and King Henry.

The wit is dry to the point of crackling, appears when I least expected it and more than twice I've laughed out loud at verbal slings and arrows.  The best insults are not the direct ones; it's the subtle knives in the back one must watch out for to survive in 16th-century England.

Wolf-Hall is well-directed with sparkling, efficient dialogue and, most of all, it is patient...just as Tudor England was forced to be.  More episodes, please!",1429401600,18,1340,4.8

Rylance plays Cromwell very well as a master of political intrigue whose affect is nearly always relaxed, pleasant and thoughtful but whose plans (though yet obscure) and actions are Machiavellian. Then there is Henry VIII played by Damian Lewis. Though he has only been seen a few times so far, Lewis has quickly dispelled the notion (born of his role as 'Brody' in Homeland) that he cannot act. He can and does in Wolf Hall.

The plot has yet to thicken much but of course history tells the tale. This is shaping up to be a Greek tragedy.

We see his life changing direction when his wife and daughters die from the sweating sickness, an event that is kissed off with a few lines on stage.

6971851,1,B00SB9SL3A,"Anyone familiar with ""A Man for All Seasons"" will be scratching their heads, left to wonder how Thomas Cromwell and Cardinal Wolsey have suddenly become heroes!
Dr. Travis Curtright has written a very able critique: ""Wolf Hall: Tudor History through an Anti-Historical, Anti-Catholic Lens"" (Public Discourse, 4/9/15), particularly noting Wolf Hall's mistreatment of Sir Thomas More.

 In the 1/24/15 Guardian, noted Tudor historian Alison Weir is quoted as saying: ""If you want to write fiction, write fiction, but if you want to write around authentic events, it should be credible.""",1428969600,27,584,5.477777777777778
6971852,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Having been infuriated by the much lauded novel upon which this series is based but still being interested in the life of Cromwell I was anxious to see if the adaptation had transcribed all those irritations along with the basic story. Happily that hasn't been the case: the adaptation being mesmerizing not least because of the mesmerizing performance at its core. Mark Rylance is compulsively watchable as the upwardly mobile courtier who, although worldly wise and cunning, still manages to persuade us his heart is in the `right place'.

However, Cromwell was a physical as well as political bruiser: Rylance convinces as the latter but perhaps, less so as the former. In his youth Cromwell was said to have been a mercenary fighting with the French; the scenes in which Cromwell attempts physical intimidation of his opponents might therefore be said to be the only weaknesses in an otherwise stunning actualization of the essence of the man. Frequent references are made to Cromwell's 'low birth', not least by Wolsey whose CV is similar in that respect, and ironically, by the Duke of Norfolk (Bernard Hill), whose vulgarity is singularly at odds with Cromwell's 'noble' forbearance in the face of such provocation.

The other performances are also, largely, first rate, not least that of the brilliant Jonathan Pryce as the aforementioned arch schemer, Wolsey, Cromwell's sponsor, to whom the latter appears genuinely fond; and Anton Lesser as More; even though he comes across in this little more than a vindictive and sanctimonious prig rather than the `man for all seasons' whose `silence deafens all Europe'!

The production not only looks superb: it's literally very dark; but is not afraid, also, to be one of silence and pauses. Ultimately, the impression is of a man of humble origin whose finer qualities of loyalty, courage, iron will and ambition got him promoted to the highest offices of the land but whose real job was as a kind of `nanny' to a spoilt brat for whom he fixed successive toys following their unceremonious dumping from his royal pram.",1428969600,7,2071,5.0145348837209305

It is the one instance I can recommend the series as being far superior to the book from which it is taken. Mark Rylance gives viewers a chance to see the reason those in the know will travel vast distances to see his stage work. Jonathan Pryce is, as usual, top notch. Anton Lesser is held in check, giving him the opportunity to do some of his best work to date. Damian Lewis does his best work since the Forsyte Saga. Saskia Reeves finally finds the part tailor-made for her. All this MUST be down to the director...and he must have been in total sympathy with his editor to have achieved this result. Heretical though it may be to say so, I can only think Mr. Kubrick would be envious of the result at this attempt to film in period-perfect locations with period-available lighting.

AFAIK, both versions are historically accurate, but tell radically different stories. I was not familiar with Mark Rylance before seeing him in this drama; he is, IMHO, incredible.

6971922,3,B00SB9SL3A,"I have not read the novel this is based on, only seen episode one.  My wife and I both found it to be confusing, as it jumps around in time and tosses in flashbacks that are not distinguished visually from the main line of the story. The sets, props and costumes are well done, but are badly photographed. Night scenes are impenetrable blackness with a few candle flames here and there. Lighting technicians who don't know any better or don't care (or are ridiculous enough to prefer it) light daylight scenes with dark corners of the room and deep shadows on people's faces. The main character, Cromwell, is underplayed by Mark Rylance to such an extent that they might as well have placed a costumed mannequin on set and had the lines dubbed in later by an amateur. I realize that I'm being sarcastic and harsh, but how can a talented cast and crew who have everything they need to produce a quality show produce this instead and seemingly not realize how far short they've fallen?",1428364800,8,983,4.5852272727272725
6971923,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Wolf Hall is unadorned, understated storytelling. It is a subtle tale. Even the lighting in this film is natural and understated, so there is an abundance of shadows. What is whispered in the shadows, or not said, is as important as what is said. Thomas Cromwell (Mark Rylance) is a bureaucrat, a lawyer, and a former aide to Cardinal Wolsey (Jonathan Pryce). This is Cromwell's story in his rise to power from a blacksmith's son to become the right hand man, or private secretary, to Henry VIII (Damien Hirst). Rylance plays him brilliantly, with a gravelly voice, and an inscrutable facade. As we all know Henry needs a male heir. How will Cromwell help him to overcome the obstacles to get one?

It is a compelling tale accented with the finesse and wit of Cromwell. He knows himself, and is willing to be himself, which is dangerous in Tudor times. Will he survive? Will he seduce Henry VIII to align with his point of view? His strategy is born from an original perspective tempered from surviving a cruel youth, years abroad in wily Italy, and a background in the field of law. He is the most astute man in the room. What keeps us watching is wanting to solve the mystery of Cromwell, and see how he maneuvers around Henry VIII and the machinations of his court. What motivates him? Although Wolf Hall (Wulfhall) is the name of the family home of the Seymours, the Tudor Court it is said is one in which 'man is wolf to man'. Who is the wolf?

In addition to the inspired acting (Claire Foy as Anne Boleyn brings out Anne's mix of French and English strains with a brittle coquettishness), there is much to enjoy in the intelligent and surprising dialogue from Hilary Mantel's novels, the richly patinaed settings - all of which are real rooms from the Tudor era in which Henry may have walked - and the historically accurate costumes. It may beguile you to watch it again and again to catch all of the textured nuances. Love Cromwell's voice. And the simple strains of music are sublime.  This series captures the allure of Hilary Mantel's hypnotic storytelling from her novels WOLF HALL and BRING UP THE BODIES. It really is spectacular and sustains its quality each episode. Mantel once said in an interview she reads Shakespeare to get back into the rhythm of the language of that time period.

6971926,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Wolf Hall and it's sequel, Bring Up the Bodies are two quintessential English novels of English history written by a quintessential English author, Hilary Mantel. Who better to bring them to the screen than the BBC and Masterpiece? And a better cast of esteemed British actors, including Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell and the incredible Damian Lewis as Henry the VIII, can't be imagined. Thomas Cromwell begins his meteoric rise to power as lawyer and advisor to the King's Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Wolsey. The only problem is that the Cardinal has failed to deliver what the King wants most, an annulment of his twenty year marriage that hasn't produced a male heir. Cromwell manages to win the king's favor because they both want the same thing a break from the Catholic Church. They want this for different reasons. The King wants to be able to marry Anne Boleyn and Cromwell for reasons of faith. Like most British historical pieces, Wolf Hall is beautifully filmed. But it rises above the typical costume drama in it's authenticity. Interior shots after dark are not well lit. The actors are often in shadow because this is the way an interior lit by candle and fire light would actually look. I love both of these Booker Prize winning books and so far, have not been disappointed one bit by this wonderful adaptation. Especially touching and superbly acted are the tragic moments of Cromwell's personal losses. Yes, this is high drama but it is also a sensitive portrayal of real people in English history.",1428278400,27,1515,4.875968992248062

8697986,5,B00SB9SL3A,"Wolf Hall, through the eyes of Thomas Cromwell, portrays the rising business-class entrepreneur in Tudor England. Cromwell escaped his brutal laboring-class upbringing to become a teenaged mercenary archer in France, and later a banking apprentice in Italy. His photographic memory and gift for languages, combined with street smarts and physical courage, allowed him to climb the newly opening  ladder of financial success, aligning himself with powerful arisocrats in church and government.

His aristocratic ""betters"" call him a dog, but they rightly fear his knowledge and manipulation of English law and his rising power as King Henry's lawyer and banker. Yet even a wealthy Cromwell cannot escape the terrifying frailty of life in a pre-scientific world, losing his wife and two young daughters in a single day to ""sweating sickness.""
