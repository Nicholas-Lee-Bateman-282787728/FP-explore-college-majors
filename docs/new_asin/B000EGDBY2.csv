2518547,1,B000EGDBY2,"This review is of Great Women Artists: Geogia O'Keefe.
In viewing this DVD I was incredibly frustrated with the presenters decision to rarely let you see the whole painting but instead constantly focus on a portion of a Georgia O'Keefe painting. Later if he deemed it necessary he would let us see the whole painting (but mostly not). My husband and I become increasingly aggitated and finally really mad. What was good about the video were the photos of her and scenes of the mountains and Ghost Ranch. Also some of the paintings were ones I don't remember ever seeing. If you have a great book of her paintings this may not irritate you but I don't recommend this particular video.",1245369600,8,683,4.652892561983471
2518548,3,B000EGDBY2,"I enjoyed the selection of paintings and photographs.  However, I would say this was a rather sanitized version of Georgia's life.  The narrator stated her happy marriage--yet it was a marriage where there were lots of difficulties.  Interesting pieces of information regarding why she painted what she painted or regarding her character were ignored---I read the book; Full Bloom: The Art and Life of Georgia O'Keeffe [Hardcover] by Hunter...and I was quite impressed by all the personal information about Georgia.  Georgia's life was not as sweet and blissful as the narrator's text seems to portray.

I found the visual quite effective and turned the audio portion off.",1172793600,19,672,5.242990654205608
2518549,4,B000EGDBY2,"I have no idea how to rate this documentary.  I'll give you the good the bad and the ugly.

  The good is great.  Incomparable.  5  The work of artist Georgia O'Keefe, seems like it must be every piece of her work shown in this clear DVD in loving and respectful presentation with plenty of time to look at each one fully.  I have seen another biography of Georgia O'Keefe that was extremely well done, but that did not even show 1/3 of these works.  This is like a fantastic museum tour shown just for you.

 The bad is the information on Georgia herself. 3 This seems to be intentional, as they incorporate quotes of hers that ""who she is and where she came from is not nearly as important as what her paintings have to say,""  and that words can not capture what she expresses in her art.  In taking up pottery at a late age, she refers to it as learning to speak another language.  Not only is there very little personal history, but there are only about 4 photos of this -highly photographed - woman, replayed throughout - most from the same few years before the death of her husband. I've other docs on her that really focus on her life and are fantastic.

The ugly: the narrator.  2, no, 3 He has a rich, resonant voice that is mellifluous and pleasant enough to put you gently to sleep.  That is not helpful with a long display of paintings.  What is horrible is that he frequently mispronounces words like ""oeuvre"" and ""ephemeral."" EE-FEEM-er-AL? he had to work hard to mispronounce it so badly!  Yeesh, they must have given him only one recording session with no re-takes or supervision.  Cheap.

This should have been titled ""The Works of Georgia O'Keefe"".  Since the good in this DVD is her work, and it is shown fully and clearly... how can I rate it lower than 4?",1161561600,32,1776,4.4
2518550,3,B000EGDBY2,"Perhaps A&E's ""Biography"" series has me spoiled.  I'm used to documentaries having interviews with biographers and descendants.  If the person lived into the 20th Century, they show them speaking and moving.  Things are in motion and fast-paced.  This work, however, was like listening to an art historian give a lecture.  And by the way, the (male) narrator's voice is low and I think those not paying attention or those who understand English as a second language may miss a lot.  The work was focused on her art, which it showed chronologically.  They show about a dozen photos of her and you never see her moving.  Facts from her life come in a haphazard order.  For example, they mentioned that she was married to Stieglitz before they mentioned when and where she was born.

After a few minutes, I was tempted to turn it off, but her art is so beautiful, I couldn't help but decide to keep going.  I knew of her flowers and bones, but I didn't know she painted so many cityscapes.  The work says she didn't identify as feminist, yet she championed the Equal Rights Amendment decades before Second Wave feminism began.

The narrator mentioned critics speaking of ""Freudian repression"" twice.  However, in speaking of the sexual, he brings up masculine and feminine symbolism.  He never brings up explicitly the woman-centeredness or lesboeroticism of her work.  Though Wikipedia, Notable Names Base, and many others say O'Keeffe was bisexual, the topic is avoided here.  At most, we see a photograph of her speaking with Eleanor Roosevelt, another famous bisexual woman married to a famous man.  They never mention whether O'Keefe had a romantic relationship with Frida Kahlo as Out magazine once stated.  Too, they never explain why O'Keeffe never drew humans.

It turns out that O'Keefe lived to be 98, so I must add her to my list of the famous who have longevity, such as Harry Hay, W.E.B. DuBois, and many others.",1160784000,5,1923,4.858461538461539

8109463,1,B000EGDBY2,I thought this was going to be a biography. It is about the artistic style and technique of O'Keefe. That's it. I quit watching after 15 minutes. What a waste of money. I don't even think it would appeal to art students since the delivery is so dull. Very boring.,1504051200,,263,4.28

8109468,3,B000EGDBY2,I had rented a documentary about Georgia O'Keeffe and I thought this was it.  I like it but it wasn't the one I wanted.  I'll keep it anyway and share it with my family.,1359504000,,169,3.9411764705882355
8109469,2,B000EGDBY2,"The video is basically a slide show with a nice assortment of Georgia O'Keeffe's works and a sparse handful of photographs from Georgia's life.
The photographs seem to be arranged chronologically, and needless to say they are beautiful, colorful, and works of genius.

The accompanying script is insipid and disjointed. My assumption is the author gathered his information in single sentences on index cards.  The statements were assigned to any relevant photo/slide.  Then, his left over cards with random information that did not relate to a photo were inserted randomly throughout the presentation.
In the background is a looped track of classical music, yes.. it repeated.
The narrator's voice sounds professional, but mispronunciations were obvious.
Audience? This is not a scholarly piece. It suffices in familiarizing the viewer with the body of O'Keeffe's work. It is whitewashed of controversy in her life, no mention of her affair, just a glancing mention of sensual interpretations of her art.  It is sufficient for an elementary/middle school class, perhaps even an academic high school art history class. ( I'd love to assign it to an English class for revision...)
Advanced audiences require more enriched and in depth information about her contributions and life.",1342569600,3,1278,5.375
8109470,5,B000EGDBY2,What a wonderful study of an artist's work.  I have long been fascinated with the work of Georgia OKeefe and this video presentation provides much of the beauty and enough of the history and background to begin to understand her and her works.,1268352000,8,243,4.651162790697675
8109471,5,B000EGDBY2,"I really enjoyed this presentation.  It have good insight into Ms. O'Keefe as a women and an artist.  I have looked at it several times and it remains interesting because each time I see something new on her canvasses - the subject matter, the lighting and the extreme care she brings to each canvass.

A remarkable women and artist.",1256601600,2,333,4.610169491525424
