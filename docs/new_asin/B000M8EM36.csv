8167107,5,B000M8EM36,"This is the only remake I ever liked more than the original movie, and I loved that movie! The first was fascinating and so well done. And the stunning Gene Tierney was incredibly good. So I was amazed when I saw Loni Anderson's Ellen be even more diabolical. I hope one day this will be available on DVD. Excellent movie.",1518825600,,322,4.383333333333334
8167108,4,B000M8EM36,"This is a remake of the original ""Leave Her to Heavan"" with Jeanne Crain, Gene Tierney and Cornel Wilde.  While good, that film was tame compared to ""Devil or Angel"".  Also called, I believe, ""Too Good to be True"".
  Loni Anderson is far more vicious and coniving than Gene Tierney ever could hope to be.  Of course, in 1946, films were tamer, and one had to rely on the actors - and the plot.  The '46 film was not too well written, although it was filmed in beautiful technicolor.
  In Devil or Angel, little doubt is left in the viewer's mind as to what is going on in Loni Anderson's mind.  The jealosy, anger and evil are brought out so clearly by her.  The plot is much clearer in that it explains carefully about the ""sugar"".
  Vincent Price and Julie Harris are excellent, with Harris playing the wronged person, and the one Duffy really loves.
  It is an excellent suspense picture, and should be put on DVD.",1339977600,6,917,4.413173652694611
