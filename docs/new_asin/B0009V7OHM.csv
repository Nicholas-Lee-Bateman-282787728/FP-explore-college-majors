8067236,1,B0009V7OHM,"This video is pretty much worthless if you intend to use it to learn anything. There is no instruction, at all. It is just a filming of the form being performed. The form is not even broken down into manageable parts to allow you to try, as best you can, to emulate the actions of the performer. The camera is static. There are no close ups to emphasize details of the form. It is an old filming and appears to have been filmed to compliment a book written by Mr. Eng. So, I presume you are expected to read the book to understand what you need to do in the form and then use this video as a visual aid to get a sense of how the form should look once you have practiced out of the book. Since I do not have the book, the video serves no purpose to me.

The Chi Kung section is just as bad. It is actually a fragmented piece, giving a little bit of ""kung fu"" history, ""shaolin"" history and tiger claw history, into which are interspersed short films showing Mr. Eng doing ""shaolin breathing"" and a few shaolin moves, which are confusing, since each starts with a montage of static pictures from old text showing the various positions then Mr. Eng is briefly filmed string the positions together. But, as mentioned before, there is no instruction nor repeat of the form with details. It is just a demonstration and not particularly meant to teach you. Finally, there is a short form called ""Tiger Claw"" which is again demonstrated without instruction, closeups, or breakdown. I can only guess this was the ""chi kung"" part of the filming since nothing is particularly labeled as such anywhere in the actual film.

This video is a GREAT disappointment and I feel I wasted all of the approximately $25 I paid for it. It serves no functional purposes unless you have the Herculean patience to repeatedly play the demonstration of the form, write down observations to guide you, and then repeatedly stop and start it over and over again to make sure you understand what is going on. Even at that, you have to guess when to breath and the intentions of the motions.",1510099200,,2057,4.453580901856764

me  through my daily patrols. I learned  the  basics of  the tiger strikes and form. I also trained with him on the ''tiger crane video' 'his
teachings help  mold  me into the practioner I am today. I invented  a  tiger  form on my own off the basics of this tiger claw video.
