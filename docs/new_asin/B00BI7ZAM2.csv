5622692,3,B00BI7ZAM2,"Ok the gang are back...but this series, which was great in the beginning, then turned worse and improved again has again gone downhill. However like every season it contains a few great passages that are worth it but overall it gets tiring.",1392076800,,240,4.738095238095238

5622712,4,B00BI7ZAM2,"I liked this season, but then again i've dug every season. I also dug how in this season Charlie made some relatively insightful points in the commentary (usually i find the commentary to be kind of lame). If you dug the previous seven seasons, you'll probably like this one as well.",1388448000,,283,4.568627450980392
5622713,5,B00BI7ZAM2,"It's hard to displease me when it comes to these guys.  They've once again made me laugh this season.  I have every season that they've put out.  I absolutely love them.  This was not as far reaching as their previous seasons, but I hear they're making a huge comeback in season 9.  I love these guys so I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who had this kind of sense of humor and needed a good laugh!",1388275200,,408,4.246753246753247
5622714,5,B00BI7ZAM2,Always Funny!  Look Forward to next Season.  I've loved the show since it aired. One of the best shows on TV,1388016000,,108,4.095238095238095

5622716,1,B00BI7ZAM2,"After watching the first 5 episodes of season 8, my wife and I finally gave up on the show. We found ourselves often glancing over at each other with a grimace on our face; they certainly lost their groove on this season. It has been, so far, extremely sophomoric in an elementary way--just AWFUL! It's lost the rich cultural metaphoric humor and comedic timing of the past seven seasons. We have watched all seven prior seasons three times already and they were hilarious! Although I get really tired of seeing Danny Devito eating with his mouth open, he really should retire. The exchanges between the characters has lost its humorous serendipity; they are just ""phoning it in."" And NOW we have close ups of Danny eating away with his mouth open! If you have a mature palate for good comedy--DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON SEASON 8!!!",1384300800,2,839,4.675675675675675
5622717,4,B00BI7ZAM2,"Have follwed the series from its infancy.  Season 8 has entertainment value, however, material and originality is slipping a bit.",1383868800,,129,5.45
5622718,3,B00BI7ZAM2,"i just think they're running out of material. don't get me wrong, theres plenty of funny moments, but not like the first 4 seasons.  plus im starting to hate that they are so over the top with every situation, and in real life, no one would ever put up with them or the things they do.  but i have been a fan of the show from the beginning, and there's plenty of laughs still, just wish it were more like the beginning of the series",1383177600,,432,4.070588235294117

5622731,5,B00BI7ZAM2,"Sunny is the funniest show on TV right now, and this is one of the funnier seasons they've done. The Wedding Massacre and Frank's Back in Business are classics, and all the other episodes hold up. I thought Seasons 6 and 7 were slightly less brilliant than Seasons 1-5, but Season 8 raises the bar back to where it was previously.",1381968000,,330,4.426229508196721
5622732,5,B00BI7ZAM2,"Since it is a new release the price is higher than typical used prices, but that is to be expected.  Clean case for dvd's with no defects.",1381708800,,138,4.111111111111111
5622733,5,B00BI7ZAM2,"Eight years in and The Gang is, if anything, funnier than ever. I can count on one hand the number of shows that have been consistently good past their fifth season, let alone making it all the way to eight and beyond.

Of course this show isn't for everyone. Dennis, Dee, Mac, Charlie and Frank are truly awful people, making the cast of Seinfeld look like saintly altruists by comparison. And the humor on the show is often crude, offensive and even disturbing. But if you liked prior seasons of Sunny you can be sure that you'll enjoy this one (and as I write this season nine is off to a great start as well).",1380844800,,613,4.3304347826086955

5622735,5,B00BI7ZAM2,"the gang are at it again season 8 of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia is 10 episodes of fun dennis and dee have to decide whether they are going to pull life support of their Pop-Pop, The Gang think zombies have taken over a wedding, Charlie and Dee Find Love, the gang see a shrink, the gang take advantage of cancer and religion (again), and all out video game war consumes the gang. and  few more surprises worth a buy people.",1380672000,,430,4.308641975308642

5622737,5,B00BI7ZAM2,It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia Season 8...what's not to like?! It's more of the same type of antics that the gang is always up to. Either you like the show or you don't. I do.,1380067200,3,178,4.114285714285714

Keep making me laugh, gang!",1379376000,3,348,4.34375

5622751,1,B00BI7ZAM2,"I'm a longtime Sunny fan and am actually surprised they even released this on DVD.  To date I've bought every season, usually the day it came out, but I'm passing on this one.  You can watch reruns on Comedy Central, Netflix etc.  This season has only 10 episodes versus the standard 13 and only 3 stand out as good.  I really enjoyed The Gang Gets Analyzed and Maureen Ponderosa Gets Married.  The others are decent to misses.  The worst one is The Gang Dines Out.  It's only 19 minutes long versus 22-23 and is just mailed-in TV, something the gang started doing the last few seasons with a couple episodes each year that are just poor.  Season 7's How Mac Got Fat was just garbage.  It was obvious that the cast had other things they were working on.  Charlie Day was working on Pacific Rim and the other guys all had side projects that impacted the quality and quantity of this season.  Pity.",1378944000,8,896,4.435582822085889
5622752,3,B00BI7ZAM2,"Don't get me wrong - I'm a die hard fan and supporter of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. I just found the 8th season of Paddy's Pub to be a little... lacking. It had a couple of good episodes like the zombie wedding (featuring the always hilariously creepy McPoyle brothers), ""The Gang Gets Analyzed"", and ""Pop Pop: The Final Solution"", but overall it wasn't nearly up to par with some of the other seasons. If you want to see It's Always Sunny at it's best, watch classic episodes like ""Who Pooped The Bed"", ""The Gang Gives Frank An Intervention"", ""The Gang Goes Jihad"", ""Chardee MacDennis: The Game Of Games"" or ""The Gang Gets Held Hostage"". If you're new to the show, definitely start with the episodes I mentioned if you want to see It's Always Sunny at its' best (or worst depending on which way you look at it). If you're a seasoned veteran of the show, either you'll like this season or hate it.

5622753,5,B00BI7ZAM2,"I've been a die hard fan of this show since episode 1 and I'm glad to say that Season 8 is yet another batch of hilarious hijinks that continue to make this show one the most funny and brilliant programs on television today. A lot of people may find this shows' humour to be too raunchy and over the top and like many other shows after it runs a few seasons it begins to spawn it's own ""hater fans"" (think Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons) that continue to watch the show only to complain about ""how it's not as good as the earlier seasons"" or ""how they are recycling their own ideas.""  I've read numerous reviews on this season and even the few previous seasons stating these exact words and I couldn't disagree more. I have never seen a demise in this shows' quality as I have found every episode to be flawless except one (""Franks Brother"" from Season 7 fell flat for me but it did have a few good jokes). This season even pokes fun at itself for recycling its own ideas in one episode and has cameos from nearly every secondary character this show has ever had so far in its 8 year run. The Waitress, Rickety Cricket, The Mcpoyles, The Lawyer, Dennis' Ex, and even Dennis and Dee's Nazi Grandfather make a return for the opening episode which is a great throwback to Season 1. To me this show is the new Seinfeld as it has never been more fun to watch a group of self involved people try to better themselves and outdo one another all while not caring at all about the people's lives that they destroy along the way. If you've been a fan of this show and its first 7 seasons then this season will not disappoint.",1378166400,8,1616,4.281045751633987
5622754,4,B00BI7ZAM2,"The series as a whole is not everyone's cup of tea, but for millions of viewers like myself, we've been hooked since it first hit the scene (personally, I think the second season sealed the deal). The Gang's absurd schemes--and the behavior that follows--are a huge part of the show's success, but what I love most about Always Sunny is the acting and chemistry between the characters.

Before I jump in, I must say that the series hit its peak with seasons 4 through 6; Season 7 isn't great on the surface, but the more you watch it, the funnier it becomes. This will most likely be the case with season 8. Some of the episodes don't leap out at you the way previous seasons did; there are a ton of references to previous seasons and feature some characters we haven't seen in a while, like Pop Pop, The Lawyer, Maureen Ponderosa, and the McPoyle twins. The Gang still get themselves into strange and dark situations, and even though people have become jaded to the kind of outrageousness that brought the show so much notoriety in the past, the chemistry is still there. I'm eagerly awaiting season 9, and while this is definitely not for beginners, it is worth adding to your collection if you love the show as much as I do.",1378080000,3,1227,4.502242152466367
5622755,4,B00BI7ZAM2,"I feel like giving it three is an accurate score concerning my feelings since a handful of episodes did not click with me.  Some of the special features are really fun stuff.  See the featurette with the replacement cast.  They've usually got great special features for their DVDs.

But what every season so far shows is that these guys love the stuff they're doing and try hard to make it work.  That's why these past two seasons seem to try a lot more in terms of sets.  Either they'll have multiple sets (eg jersey shore ep) or they'll minimize it down to two rooms like the bar (or the therapist's office).  This whole season is a big celebration run.  I mean, the Gang recycles their trash  (episode name too) and references past episodes.  I think that they do that for two reasons:  1) it shows these fools will never change, will never ""peak""; and 2) they became well aware during season 6 and 7 that they were bringing some old plots back.

This is good or crap depending on you.  I enjoyed those particular episodes.  I was not overly fond of the tired MMORPG topic and the over-abundance of ""is Mac gay?"" jokes.  I think these latter jokes are the most common of all jokes next to Dennis becoming more and more comfortable with the sociopath identity.  The jokes are not horrible, but some are a little too obvious and lazy.

To me this DVD is worth the penultimate and Halloween episodes alone.  I thought those were very funny and well done.  I was thrilled to see the McPoyles in a concentrated dose of weird too.  If you're a fan, it's worth a watch.  I bet it will pop on Netflix soon though.",1377734400,2,1608,4.419795221843003
5622756,1,B00BI7ZAM2,"Since they're switching ""Sunny"" and ""the League"" to the new FXX channel, chances are I won't get to see the new season. So because of this switch I cancelled both my pre-orders of the newest sunny and league seasons. If I can't see the new season I'm going to stop buying their DVDs new. I'll start buying them used from now on.",1376352000,3,328,4.306451612903226

The running gag of Gugino's is hilarious (hope that's the right name, I went to imdb to find that).",1366070400,26,309,4.344827586206897
