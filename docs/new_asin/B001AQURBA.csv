3465886,3,B001AQURBA,"Ok, The Best Damn Tour was like the best damn tour she had so far, but this DVD is somewhat disappointing. Her voices are way too much produced and sounds really unnatural and different from her live performances. I know everybody does that when they release DVD but this one could've been much much better if they just kept her voice LIVE a little (like her first DVD). Some people may like it because it sounds almost perfect, but come on, what's the point of buying LIVE conert DVD? I don't think she sounded so terrible in the actual concert that they had to edit her voice for the entire concert.",1221177600,8,601,4.423423423423423
3465887,5,B001AQURBA,"I personally saw this concert in Virginia, and then again when she was with the Jonas Brothers. I have loved Avril Lavigne for about 6 years, ever since she came out. This concert is sure to please many with its upbeat songs and stage layout. She has a lot of audience involvement, and her live recordings make a great addition to any music fan. With a mix of songs from her first three CDs, from Sk8er Boi to the Best Damn Thing, Avril fans of all ages will be happy with this product.",1218067200,7,486,4.236559139784946
3465907,5,B001AQURBA,"The sound was clear, and crisp. The video was well shot. Finally, Avril Lavigne was her usual outstanding performer. If you have never seen her in concert you need to own this DVD.",1390521600,,180,4.484848484848484
3465908,5,B001AQURBA,"This is a great DVD from Avril, way more entertaining than My World. If you're expecting a show like she did in the Let Go or Under My Skin eras, you won't find that here. It's a very big, over the top pop production with dancers, costumes, and lots of pink and sparkles. It's a very different show from Avril, but equally good, if not better. It has a little something for everyone to enjoy. There is dancing on some songs and then there is a section of the show that is more stripped down where she plays the guitar and piano.

Some people have said they think her vocals have been heavily edited in post production. I think her vocals sound fine, maybe there was some tweaking here and there in post production. The vocals on this DVD are way better than the ones on My World.

My only thing maybe about the DVD is that there are no bonus features. Otherwise, it's a very enjoyable 75 minute concert and one of my favorites from Avril. I watch it quite often and still enjoy it every time. If you are a hardcore fan and love big production-type shows, I definitely recommend getting this DVD. There is also a clean version of the DVD available.",1386288000,,1147,4.330232558139535
3465909,5,B001AQURBA,i have several of avril's cds and watched her other concert but this was the best of anything out there on her!,1360281600,,111,4.090909090909091
3465910,5,B001AQURBA,"Not really sure where the critics are getting their info from.  I've been playing/recording music for over 20 years and there's no overdubbing on this DVD.  IT IS HER VOICE.  IT IS LIVE MUSIC.  A tweak here and there?  Really?  Unless you're watching the DVD (*FROM HER OR ANY GROUP*) through a spectrum equalizer you're not going to find too much to gripe about.  And then - for the purists amongst us - do you really want 240 volt hum coming through your speakers?  There's housecleaning on every recording for that matter.  Does that make it fake?  More fake than anyone elses?  Tough call.  The energy of her performance is there.  The attitude is there.  The love of performing is there.  She's on her game in her home town.  You can't get better than that.  She's original, she writes her own stuff and she plays a real guitar through a real amp.  Hell...there's guys that can't/don't do that.  All the hits are there and the delivery is spot on.  This isn't her first gig, kids.  Yeah, the ""Avril plays drums"" bit was cheesy and time wasting, but hey...everyone gets to play rock star every now and then.  On a scale of one to ten I give this DVD a thirty five.",1345507200,,1168,4.436018957345971
3465911,5,B001AQURBA,"This DVD rocks! The sounds quality is amazing! The camera work was excellent! As you watch, you feel like you're actually at the concert! I love watching this DVD! GREAT WORK AVRIL! A previous review said that the DVD had been entirely dubbed after filming. This statement would be incorrect. Avril's crew REALLY cared about the sound quality of this DVD because the sound was recorded straight from the mic (which is quite an expensive process). All the little black stars (Avril fans) should own this EXCELLENT concert DVD!",1339459200,,525,4.910112359550562
3465912,4,B001AQURBA,when i watched the concert it was pretty good and i thought it was very well put together and she performed the songs in the concert very well.i would recommend the clean concert to anyone who would want to buy it.sincerly chrisfan.,1333497600,,232,4.5476190476190474
3465913,5,B001AQURBA,"This DVD of Avril in concert is Awsome. The sound,picture quality,and of course Avril herself is all great. And Avril has a amazing voice. You know how some singers don't sound as good live,well Avrils voice sounds so amazing. You will enjoy every minute of this DVD.",1310947200,,267,4.702127659574468
3465914,1,B001AQURBA,"Never been much of a fan... find her a bit fake as she claims she's ""punk"" but is quite pop if you ask me... And it doesn't help in the argument that she's not overly produced when her arm is missing in the photoshop fail that is the cover of this DVD. ^_^",1289952000,,256,3.849056603773585
3465915,5,B001AQURBA,"For fans who cannot attend a live show, this is real good, and for fans who love her records, her songs, her band, this is great because you just want to see and know more. She generates excitement without the cheap sexual gesturing that some of the other female singers in her age range perform on stage.",1277596800,,305,4.368421052631579
3465916,5,B001AQURBA,"This is an AWESOME DVD , Music sounds real good, clear sound. Turn on your surround sounds speakers, play the dvd in a blueray player and you feel like you are really there at Avrils concert. As Avril says, ""if you don't like me for who I am, then you don't like me for who I am, and all your going to get, is who I am"".",1264032000,,320,3.791044776119403
3465927,5,B001AQURBA,"Is a great dvd. If you are an Avril's fan you must own it. Very cool acoustic performances for old songs, and very good on stage performances. The edition is awesome, you see Avril on camera almost every second of the concert.",1249689600,,226,4.404761904761905
3465928,5,B001AQURBA,"Avril Lavigne's performance in the ""Best Damn Tour: Live in Toronto"" DVD is fabulous. It sounds exactly as her live performances usually do. I was especially impressed by how strong her voice and vocal range is!

The sound quality is excellent, so I'm not sure why some people commented on bad sound quality... Maybe it's their TV's (although I watched this both on my TV and on my computer)

A great DVD for any true Avril fan, with all of the old favorites and also the newer hits.

Again, any true Avril fan should own this fantastic tour dvd, especially those who were unable to attend the actual shows.",1245196800,,1529,4.366197183098592
3465929,5,B001AQURBA,"hello to everyone ...this DVD is very good condition and its like a new,they shipped on time , and now ill shipped it to my daughter too, she love the songs of avril.

thanks  amazon.",1244332800,,183,4.2
3465930,3,B001AQURBA,"This was a great concert & the video is fun.  So many great songs...However the sound quality is terrible.  You can barely hear her over the music.

My daughter loves it though and she plays it over & over!

I'd recommend this only to a real fan who can see past the flaws & enjoy the show.",1239667200,3,290,4.035087719298246
3465931,4,B001AQURBA,"THE GOOD

- Video and sound quality are great.

- Avril is attractive

- Some of the songs are entertaining. I love 4 of them. They are ""Girlfriend"", ""Complicated"", ""My Happy Ending"", and ""I Can Do Better"".

THE BAD

 - There's NO SUBTITLES. Consequently, I can't sing along! This is what I hate the most.

 - The dubbing is INCOMPLETE! They dubbed only Avril's voice. They did not dub her backup singers's voices. As a result, you can see they move their mouths but they make no sound. Not only it looks  silly but it also reduces the quality of the performance.

It's still worth buying.",1234742400,2,589,4.471698113207547
3465932,4,B001AQURBA,"It is just a DVD of Avril's latest live in Toronto.
I personally wanted them to add something more, like the scenes at the backstage. But it was great to see her live even though it was on DVD.

If you were a fan of her, you'd enjoy this product.",1233964800,,246,3.92
3465933,5,B001AQURBA,Great transaction and a great product. Product was delivered as described and in very fast time. The product itself is very entertaining and a must have for any Avril fan!,1231718400,,171,4.733333333333333

3465935,5,B001AQURBA,"This is one of the best concert dvds I've ever seen. The quality is awesome and there's a lot of energy in the air. If you're an Avril fan you will find yourself watching this over and over again. If you're not an Avril fan I still think you will like this DVD, that's how good it is.",1226188800,6,284,3.913793103448276
3465936,5,B001AQURBA,"From the start to end, this live DVD is just amazing! It brought back the good memories of seeing her as a VIP in Houston. (I know this was taken live in Toronto, though.)

Her performances are just like I remembered them being. The break dance had a different song though. It was Linkin Park when I saw her. It might have changed every show though, I'm not too sure. I loved when she played drums on Runaway! (Even though she cut the song short!) Her video for Bad Reputation (Originally by Joan Jett) was pretty cool.

The only thing I have to complain about it is the sound quality. It sounds a bit too perfect. Don't get me wrong, she did sound VERY good live, but some of the sound in this DVD seems to be studio recorded. If you notice in a few songs, including Complicated, her mouth is moving and the song is not matched up right. I don't know what happened there...

Overall, this DVD is worth every penny! Go buy it [:

3465958,1,B001AQURBA,"I was there, when Avril was being INVENTED! She does not write her songs, an entire team does. This is not music. We destroyed Milli Vanilli because they were fakes but spare all these young pretty girls and guys. The last REAL music came in the early 80's. That is why there are no Legends under 43 years old. I have been in the Music Industry since 1975 and I can say with assurance, ""Rock is Dead"". Buy Elvis or Annie Lennox, Robert Plant or Cheap Trick....at least you will get real talent who deserve our money and attention. If you think this is Avril's only fake, just go to any of her concerts. She can barely sing on key or remember lyrics. Avril is a special effect like K.Reeves in ""The Matrix"", not real like Bruce Lee (look ma, no wires!). Sad, Sad, Sad!",1224892800,5,767,4.296551724137931
3465959,4,B001AQURBA,This DVD is packed with Avril Lavinge's best songs and any fan of hers would love it!,1223942400,,85,4.0588235294117645
3465960,5,B001AQURBA,one of the best dvd's.  Avril puts on the best shows.  I have all her live recordings.,1223683200,,86,4.0
3465961,3,B001AQURBA,"I was really expecting this to be great. Unlike the fake avril fans who turned away from the best damn thing album, I turned towards her and loved her for once again making a standout Cd, not just from the other artists out there but from her own as well.

However, something is lost on this DVD. First of all, there are no extras. I don't know why all artists don't release the music video's on these live dvd's; the two go together like peas in a pod.

Then there's the actual preformance. When I saw she preformed for nearly two hours. How did we get down to 1 hour and 15 minutes (which isn't true; it's about an hour and twenty minutes)? So many songs are shortened (Hot and Runaway), and other hits we look foward to despite this being a support for Best damn thing are shortened and made acoustic.

This is supposed to be a live rock concert (or pop, whatever), not avril lavigne live acoustic. Boring, snooze through those songs.

Then we look foward to see her sing Joan Jetts's Bad Reputation and instead we see video footage over it, no actual live preformance here.
And all the dance interludes were pointless. It's cute during ""Girlfriend,"" ""I Can Do Better,"" ""I Don't Have To Try,"" and ""The Best Damn Thing,"" but otherwise it's pretty pointless and doesn't fit.

This could've been great; instead it looks like Avril Lavigne is either too tired to preform good anymore or is just a lazy sell-out.
As I must repeat, I saw her on her support tour for Under My Skin and she was beyond excellent. She did almost all of her songs from both albums. There's no reason why we couldn't have done 1/3 of each album here, or at least 1/2 BDT and 1/2 the other two.

Overall, this will only dissapoint. But if you don't mind skipping through all the songs that aren't on best damn thing, it's a decent watch.",1223683200,3,1810,4.404191616766467
3465962,5,B001AQURBA,I love this dvd. Avril performs all her hits including oldies but goodies. Must get for Avril fans.,1223596800,,99,4.555555555555555
3465963,5,B001AQURBA,"I bought this DVD since Avril is one of the greatest artists nowadays!
I like the DVD since it has all you are looking for! Great show and a great performance by Avril! So far my favorite Avril presentation is the one from Budokkan but I would recommend this one for any Avril fan",1223596800,,280,4.203703703703703
3465964,4,B001AQURBA,"It's pretty amazing to see how much Avril's changed in the past 6 years, and let me say, even though I was her fan from day 1, I'm digging this new Avril. She grew up, she's having more fun and she still doesn't give a damn about what other people say. I'm glad that revolted teen phase was really just a phase, true to her self, reflecting on her songs. Now she feels different and her songs also reflect that.
The DVD is fun from the intro to the end, I just wish it had extras, it's such a shame.",1223337600,,499,4.0
3465965,1,B001AQURBA,"I was looking forward to seeing this DVD but was disappointed right from the start.  The audio is completely overdubbed, which means that after the recording of the show they went and re-recorded almost all of Avril's vocals, and some of the guitars too.  You're not really hearing the live recording of the show; you're hearing a studio recording made after the show.  This means that the producers or label were very unhappy with the quality of the actual live recording and re-did it to make it as perfect as possible.  There's nothing new about overdubbing a live performance, in fact it's quite common, but it's usually done to get rid of blatant mistakes.  In this case it's been used to mask the entire actual performance.  It was hard to find an example, with the exception of some of the dialog between songs, where the actual vocals were being used.  How bad could her performance have been?  When we buy a live DVD or CD, we don't expect perfection.  We expect a few bumps along the way.  What we lose in imperfection, we make up for in the drama, spontaneity, passion, and reality of a real person performing live, and singing live.  The idea that Avril had to go back into a studio and sync re-recorded voacals to what appears to be EVERY song in the concert is appalling and a slap in the face to her fans.  Is The Best Damn Tour (Live In Toronto) really the best that Avril has to offer her fans?

In some places the new audio has overdubbed parts of the song where the backing vocals from the other members of her band have been removed and were never put back in.  You have people singing on stage with nothing coming out of their mouths.  It's pathetic.  If you just want to look at Avril (she does look great) and don't really care what you hear, then you might like this.  But I say forget it.  Maybe her next concert CD or DVD will really be live and not a fake, which is what this is.  Avril, you should be ashamed of yourself for releasing this as it is.  You should show a little more respect for your fans.",1223164800,16,2031,4.365333333333333
3465966,3,B001AQURBA,"Well this DVD is quite good, but there's couple dissappointments, I was at one of her concerts but she didn't sound like in this DVD, I mean this DVD has to many audio modifications, and I know it's live DVD, but it almost doesn't sound like live. At some places there's a little desynchronization.
Video is great, but audio not so much.",1221609600,6,337,4.451612903225806

I was super excited when I got this in the mail. I own a music school and we use this to teach our students about stage movement and interacting with the audience. It's a great teaching tool.  I will say that as a music teacher, her voice is definitely been patched up with some autotune. I was disappointed in that but that's kinda the standard these days.",1484179200,,508,4.291666666666667

But I admit it, I enjoyed this DVD!  Avril is an excellent singer with a crystal clear voice, and her songs are generally pretty good too (my favorite is 'Losing Grip').  No, she's no deity like Joni Mitchell, but she's still a legit artist and deservedly successful.  So there you go - even if you don't think you're an Avril Lavigne fan, give this DVD a try and you might discover that you become a fan.",1467936000,,648,4.560344827586207
