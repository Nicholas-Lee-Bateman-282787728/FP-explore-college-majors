of interviews or talking on this dvd..THE SECOND REVIEW said something about
performances not being complete. I want music and not a whole bunch of talking.",1375574400,,233,4.571428571428571
8154882,2,B000K7VL42,"This video is NOT 60 minutes, as stated, but ""approx. 45 minutes"" the same as the ""A Life In Music"" DVD also listed with Amazon.

It is truly a problem when Amazon does not have accurate information for the products it lists for sale.

Now I have two copies of this identical documentary with the same people praising Chet Atkins, who truly was a master at the guitar.",1312243200,,368,4.397058823529412

I was amazed to find that Chet influenced such a wide array of people in the music world. I was familiar with most of the artists, but one of the coolest things for me was discovering Tommy Emmanuel, another great guitarist!",1295395200,,342,4.532258064516129
