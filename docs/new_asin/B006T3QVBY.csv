5015508,1,B006T3QVBY,"This is, frankly, a bizarre workout. First of all, it's very clear that Bob is trying to toughen up his nice-guy image and be more like Tony from P90X. Evidence: He's sporting a goatee and he's groping the two yoga ladies in his routine -- and I really mean groping -- constantly. (He does not grope, or even touch, the man.) Secondly, he's borrowed P90X's count-down timer. Thirdly, some parts of the routine are very similar to the P90X yoga.

The thing is, none of that would bother me if this was a good workout. It's not. Actually, Bob's biggest loser Yoga DVD is much harder. And he's still acting like a nice guy -- not like a yoga molester.

Do not waste your money on this. It's not hard and it's totally annoying watch this new Bob, whoever he is. He's not Tony, that's for sure.",1291852800,18,789,4.360544217687075
5015509,5,B006T3QVBY,Bob is such an amazing instructor and he did not fall short with this new yoga dvd. I have recently gotten in to classes but have a lot going on in the next few weeks. I wanted something fresh to use at home. Bob's yoga dvd is just as challenging as my intermediate yoga class. I feel confident that when I miss a day of yoga at the gym I can get my full yoga workout with Bob. Excellent!,1289260800,3,388,3.9240506329113924
5015510,1,B006T3QVBY,As the video starts Bob says get ready for a yoga workout like you've never done before. Well I did the whole dvd and found this was a very basic yoga dvd nothing innovative or different like he promised. Nothing special I would not waste my money on this. There are many more quality intermediate level yoga dvds that are way better such as radiant flow which is an excellent dvd or Sadie Nardini much more quality yoga without the hype.,1289088000,13,438,4.419753086419753
5015511,3,B006T3QVBY,"If you are new to yoga, this is not a good DVD to start with. You may end up only hurting yourself more than anything else.

This DVD has a run time of 75 minutes, broken down as follows:

- 15 minute workout (more of an Abs workout than a yoga workout)
- 60 minute workout

These are intense workouts, and you may end up cheating a bit unless you are really flexible. Most of the traditional poses are included as well as some more exotic ones. Once you are familiar with yoga terminology you will find Bob's instructions to be adequate. However he does not personally do all of the poses in the DVD.",1289001600,44,601,4.208695652173913
5015512,3,B006T3QVBY,"I bought this as part of the 4 box set from Bob's website. This is a power yoga workout which is an athletic yoga workout based on Ashtanga.  This is not a bad workout, its just that there are so many power yoga workouts that are so very similar to this and many have better instruction (for example, Bryan Kest's 3 workout DVD series is a better bargain and has better instructions and a better price).  If you already some good power yoga workouts, this workout will not really add anything new to your collection.

The level of this workout is pitched towards the intermediate/advanced exerciser.  The demonstration of proper form is pretty minimal so this is best for someone who knows how to properly execute the moves.  The workout also has some fairly advanced moves such as binds (moves in which one part of the body holds onto another part of the body or when two parts of the body are intertwined.  These are great but you can injure yourself if you do not have good form).

There are three people going through this workout.  Like the other workouts in this series, there is a timer counting down how much of the workout is left.  The workout starts with basic stretching and then works into the sun salutation series (flat back stretch with palms to ground, downward dog, plank, chatkuranga, upward dog).

The workout coves all the basic power yoga poses: tree, triangle, reversed triangle, warrior 1,2, and 3, half moon, triangle, reversed triangle, chair pose, lunges, wheel, seated twists, bridge.
The first portion of the workout is standing poses, the last workout is seated work.

All in all, this is a solid power yoga workout that will work the entire body.  However, there is nothing in this workout that really differentiates it from other power yoga workouts.  If you already have a good power yoga dvd (Bryan Kest, Baron Baptiste, Beryl Bender Birch, Kristen McGee, etc) then this workout will not offer anything substantially different.",1284422400,292,1961,4.783382789317508

5015516,5,B006T3QVBY,"I have never done a day of yoga in my life until I tried this DVD and I actually found it to be quite fun!  It is long--of course, all of Bob's work out tend to be pretty lengthy--but I found that it went by pretty fast!  The three helpers that he has in this DVD are three of the best I've ever seen him have.  No screaming, no phoning it in--only the best effort possible!  Bob is constantly picking on poor Robert in the back, but I appreciate that Robert still gives a hundred percent unlike some other male Bob helpers (looking at you, Zack and Joe!)  The girls are absolutely ferocious and enviable in this DVD!  Some of the moves were too advanced and actually ended up giving me some tension--I was really determined to get that ""Bird of Paradise"" move, but all I got was 100 knots in my neck--and some moves were unbalanced (the standing splits are held for WAY different times), but it is a really fun start to yoga.  And HOLY CRAP that is one intense ab work out.  It might be worth getting the DVD just for the killer ab work out he provides!  It was a lot of fun, especially for someone as ""un-yoga'd"" as me--and the extended cool down at the end is extra fun :)  If you like Bob and aren't a yoga extraordinaire, give it a go!",1465084800,,1240,4.1722689075630255
5015517,5,B006T3QVBY,"Good burn and plenty of room left for challenging levels of flexibility and endurance. The way Bob has scripted this, it's so easy to just listen to his verbal queues and not even have to look at the tv screen.",1464825600,2,210,4.275

He is unbelievably motivating and I am dripping with sweat every single time I do it, which is like 3 times a week now!! It doesn't matter if you are a beginner or advanced, this will work for you.  The 15 minute yoga ab routine will kick your butt but I love it!!  My flexibility and my strength have improved tremendously.  Money well spent!! Don't wait...getcha some of this!!",1462579200,3,500,4.472527472527473
5015520,1,B006T3QVBY,"If you want to waste an hour of your day with a chauvinistic douche bag, this is the perfect video fro you. Not only was he really handsy with the women in the video, he was quite disrespectful to the token black man in the back row (at one point he put his foot on the back of the man's neck). While I expected that this video would be more of a workout style yoga video, I was still disappointed with how far from a true yoga practice this exercise really was. I would love to warn everyone I can against buying this video.",1461888000,5,525,4.0576923076923075
5015521,3,B006T3QVBY,"Decent workout but Bob is not designed to instruct yoga. Feels more like some coach yelling at you to work harder. Zero breath instruction, which is fundamental in yoga.",1461283200,,169,4.862068965517241

5015523,2,B006T3QVBY,Didn't make me sweat... Usually Bob is more intense than this. I was disappointed.,1460937600,,82,4.928571428571429

5015525,1,B006T3QVBY,"Not what I was wanting at all. First, bob is annoying. Second, I do not enjoy push-ups with yoga. I wanted a more intense yoga workout where I actually break a sweat. I did break a sweat but I also felt pain the next day which in my opinion isn't yoga.",1457395200,,252,3.9607843137254903

5015527,5,B006T3QVBY,Love it!,1456531200,,8,3.5
5015528,5,B006T3QVBY,"I love this DVD! It includes two workouts: one 1-hour yoga workout and one 15-minute ab workout. I like them both, but I mostly do the longer yoga workout. It's much more like real yoga than some ""yoga"" workout DVDs (like Jillian Michaels's Yoga Inferno), so if you're a traditionalist yogi looking for a tougher workout, this is perfect. It's not as fast-paced as, say, Yoga Inferno, but it's still a kick-ass workout! You do a lot of different poses, including a few more advanced ones like bird-of-paradise, as well as some faster-paced flow. It doesn't feel as exhausting while I'm doing it as some of the faster-paced yoga workouts (i.e., I'm not panting the whole time) but I definitely feel it the next day all over my body. Highly recommend if you want to get stronger and more flexible.",1453766400,5,795,4.685714285714286
5015529,5,B006T3QVBY,I LOVE this workout!,1453161600,,20,4.25
5015530,5,B006T3QVBY,"I have practiced yoga on and off for several years, and recently started a home yoga practice. I got several yoga DVDs, and this was one of them. I love it! It's power yoga, so know that going in. It moves quickly and has you doing a lot of poses. It challenged both my balance and my flexibility, and I was sore for about 48 hours. Again, I loved it. Bob is a great instructor, and provides constant tips (pull your belly to your spine, tighten up your back leg, etc.) which I find incredibly helpful. He also gives basic instruction as to what you should be thinking of in each pose (front leg at a 90 degree angle, back leg straight, belly pulled in, etc.) -- again, very helpful. It's not a beginners DVD but if you have some background in yoga you'll be able to keep up.",1453161600,2,775,4.208053691275167

5015532,5,B006T3QVBY,"I hate yoga--well, I thought I hated yoga.  Just way too slow for me (note I am the trainer's least favorite person saying ""can you rev this up a bit"").
However, I love this DVD. AT two minutes into it, I thought ""well, if I turn the downward dogs into mountain climbers and do jumping jacks during some of the stretches, I might get something out of this.  At 4 minutes, I thought- this is one I will give to Donna, a friend who likes yoga.  At 30 minutes, I thought- HECK, THIS IS A WORKOUT AND SOME OF THE BEST BALANCE TRAINING I HAVE DONE.  I am, true confessions, a Bob Harper fan and in my 60's can pretty much keep up with the 20 somethings in his other workout DVDs -and LOVE them.  This is a surprisingly good addition to an exercise program.  As a physician, I KNOW that for those of us over 50, balance is something we really MUST work on and this is one fun way to do it while adding good stretches and strength training to your workout in a different way.  Thanks, Bob Harper, for another winner!",1451692800,7,1009,4.170103092783505
5015533,5,B006T3QVBY,Ordered a few years ago. Still use it! It will kick your butt!!! Amazing workout! Made me love yoga!,1451347200,,100,4.315789473684211
5015534,5,B006T3QVBY,"I love the idea of yoga for balance and core strength, but do not subscribe to the ""spiritual"" aspects of it. This is a GREAT video mixed with light low impact cardio with yoga strength, core, and balance movements. You will sweat, you will squirm, and struggle to hold the poses, but you will also great a fantastic hour workout. Since running 1/2 marathons and blowing out both knees, this is a perfect alternative and great to stay fit and healthy. Leaned up my core unlike even my training days with running. With proper diet, and doing this workout 3-4 times a week, you will get that lean yoga body with your arms, core, and legs!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",1449792000,,656,4.567796610169491
5015535,5,B006T3QVBY,I love this yoga DVDs. I've yet to complete it because it is so challenging in a good way. I get such a good stretch and workout regardless if I do half or 3/4s of it. Great vinyasa/power yoga pace and great instruction.  It is great at all levels because you can easily do what you can.,1447372800,,287,4.035087719298246
5015536,5,B006T3QVBY,"This is one of my favorite workouts. It is not traditional yoga; it is power yoga. I personally don't enjoy traditional yoga. It is too slow for my taste, but I still want to work on my balance and flexibility. This workout is great because it combines the stretching and flexibility/balance aspect of yoga and also adds in some strength training. It is a good, challenging workout that will leave you sweating, and you will feel it the next day. There is also a modifier if you're not too flexible.

5015543,5,B006T3QVBY,"YOGA FOR THE WARRIOR is a fantastic workout. Bob Harper is an excellent teacher. What I like most (as with all Bob's DVDs) is that I can actually workout without having to look at the television because Bob tells you step-by-step what to do and how to do it. I also like that there is a 15-minute yoga abs routine, which is perfect once per week. Although the workout is nothing new - it is the sequence and duration of poses that makes this workout so effective. The only complaint I have is the music, which is awful. Overall I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend.",1438041600,,584,4.36697247706422

My favorite yoga videos were either Rodney Yee or Brian Kest. I liked the idea of power yoga for strength and flexibility. I just did Bob Harper's ""Yoga for the warrior"", for the first time today. I really enjoyed the way he instructed the class. He had good flow to the different movements and great instruction. A couple of things about his video I also liked was that he used good yoga students, but they were normal people. The girls would lose their balance and have to regain their poses. The video also had a big strong looking guy that had the typical flexibility of most average men. It was nice to see a regular guy doing yoga and not having all the flexibility of a ragdoll. This video had the male student sweating up a storm. For myself, I also like to see the countdown clock that is shown throughout the video. I want to know where I am time-wise in my workout. When you move to each pose, the name of the pose pops up on the screen temporarily. I like this feature also.",1427500800,17,1107,4.276190476190476

I have never been able to complete every single position that the experienced yoga girls are able to do, but that is kind of what I like about it. I get a good sweat everytime and it is still challenging.
Bob can be a bit annoying with his "" all I want you to do is"" mantra. Plus, I usually end it early and do my final stretches on my own because I like to hold my stretches a little longer and I don' need to hear all of that blabbing.

I like a yoga workout where I sweat, that way I am burning calories and getting the relaxing at the end.  I also like the extra 15 minute AB workout on the DVD. The AB workout is just enough.

5015595,5,B006T3QVBY,I really love doing this Yoga workout. I love how great my body feels afterward and how I am completely drenched in sweat. I love doing a variety of workouts and this one compliments my other workouts perfectly.,1411430400,,211,4.578947368421052
5015596,5,B006T3QVBY,"First, a little background about me since I find it helpful when I read reviews for exercise DVDs: 40 year old man who's in good shape and would be considered intermediate to advanced. I workout and run (a little) six to seven times a week. I can keep up with the performers in the video.

Like others my introduction to Yoga was through P90X.  I found I really enjoyed the increased flexibility that I got from it and the sense of accomplishment from completing it.  The hour and a half to finish it never really bothered me while doing the 90 days of P90X, but I think that had to do with the fact that most of the other days were an hour and fifteen minutes (workout plus ab ripper).  However, since moving on to making my own workout rotations I have not once completed Yoga X.

I tried some Rodney Yee, since that was labeled as power yoga, but I just couldn't get into it.  It just seemed too detached from the viewer (and a little weird) .

So, I tried this DVD.  I'd never heard of Bob Harper before, but it was cheap and got good reviews so I took a shot.  I'm glad I did as this is my go to yoga workout.  At 58 minutes it is a little more manageable.  Bob does a good job of starting out slow and then working up to some very challenging moves.  If you've done Yoga X you've seen most of the moves before, or at least somehting close to it.  I'm far from great at yoga, but I can do all the moves except the bird of paradise - I still don't understand how that's possible.  The final 15 minutes of the routine isn't so much yoga as it is ab work and stretching.

There is a second routine called Yoga Abs, which while not really yoga is a really challenging workout in about 17 minutes.

As others have mentioned there's some artsy stuff done with the camera a few times (freeze frames, fade outs, etc), but I'm usually not looking at the TV for that long so it's not really a distraction for me.  Also, he gives a monologue at the beginning about this being the toughest yoga workout ever, which is annoying, but since I convert my DVDs to mp4s to play on my Roku, I just edited that out.

If you are looking for an hour long, tough yoga workout give this one a try.",1411084800,3,2178,4.145238095238096
5015597,5,B006T3QVBY,Great workout! I love Bob in this.  He is motivating and does a great job of coaching you through the workout.,1409875200,,110,4.238095238095238
5015598,5,B006T3QVBY,"I was actually a little scared to buy this. I have other Bob DVDs, and he is tough! I have never done yoga before, but I get bored easily by my workouts and wanted something new. I actually enjoy this DVD- Bob acts like it's going to be the hardest workout you'll ever do, but it's not; and I didn't find it overly complicated for a newbie. I couldn't get into all the breathing and spiritual stuff, so I like that Bob doesn't focus a lot on that. The best part is at the end when you lie on your mat with your eyes closed, and Bob talks to you. If you're looking for something new to try and like Bob Harper, I'd recommend this DVD. I feel like even people who are experienced in yoga would enjoy this workout to do at home.",1409529600,,725,4.041666666666667

I do yoga fairly regularly and tried this DVD today because my regular classes didn't fit my schedule. I would call this a medium challenging flow class, not a power flow. It was a good, well balanced practice, but nearly the butt kicking I was expecting. That said, if you are looking for some strength mad stretch, this is great. I would also not recommend for complete yoga novices -- not enough attention to how to do poses properly, so high potential for injury if you don't know what you're doing.",1402099200,,599,4.504587155963303

Unfortunately, someone in my family skipped out with my Ulimate Yogi progam and I needed another yoga program that was intense and could get my body dripping with sweat and push me to my limits.  Yoga Warrior is amazing as well, but it is a bit slower and while I love that too, some days I just want to be pushed to my limits and sweat it out.  This DID IT!!

5015623,5,B006T3QVBY,"Thus is an excellent yoga DVD for someone who already has a good level of fitness and would be comfortable in a level-2 Yoga class.
Bob offers some modifications for less advanced students, but some of the moves, like chaturanga pushup and full side plank are high-risk for beginners, and he does not say that in the DVD.
If you are already familiar with Yoga, this is a very challenging, fast-moving workout. He keeps the flow moving--there are not a lot of 2-minute holds here. The pace keeps the workout interesting and also increases your heart rate.
I like Bob's mannerisms in the DVD. His voice is peaceful enough to be appropriate for Yoga, while still challenging the kids on the video and the people at home.
I also appreciate that there is no ""ohhm"" ing, ujjayi breathing or chanting. I respect these aspects of Yoga, and when I take a live class, the instructors include these elements and I do participate. I'll admit feel a little odd chanting in a live class, but there's just no way I'm going to do it at home in my living room, and I am glad that Bob skips that part.
I have been taking Yoga for several years, practicing at home and in live classes. I tried this DVD out the first day I got it just because I wanted to see it. It was supposed to be a rest day for me, so I didn't do it full-out. I was still sore the next day! I do have a lot of room to grow with this DVD, as I used some of the modifications and it would take a while to move into the full expression of some of the poses, but I could participate in some way with all of the poses. The poses were not so completely impossible that all I could do was sit and watch.
I also like that a very big, muscular, extremely fit-looking guy is the one doing the simpler modifications, and the women are doing the full-out expressions of the poses. So when I have to adjust downward, I am still following a very strong, athletic man, which is way better than when a DVD choses, say, a sort of out-of-shape-looking person for their modification model.
Bob does a good job of giving instructions that you can mostly follow when you are upside-down or turned away from the TV. I appreciate that he counts down how much longer you have in a pose, and that the timer at the bottom of the screen tells you how much of the workout remains.
All in all, a great DVD for days I can't make it to the studio!",1394236800,5,2369,4.243362831858407

5015625,5,B006T3QVBY,"I have been doing yoga for a few years now at the gym, but I wanted something to do at home. Bought a few other videos but all had something annoying (the voice, the music, the routine)--just not something I could stick to. After reading the reviews, I bought Bob Harper - Inside Out Method. The music was nice (not distracting or sleepy), he taught at different levels (though I modified some even further with blocks), was a medium level intensity and gentle enough to do first thing in the morning, and Bob was right on point with his direction. Knowing a little about yoga ahead of time definitely helped me keep pace, but I think even a beginner could keep up. Already recommended it to my friends. This is also something my husband would like. So for all you guys out there just getting into yoga, this is a great start. Love this DVD!

No chanting or meditating, I prefer fast paced Power / Vinyasa yoga & it's really tough to find a dvd without all that. So if you prefer the more spiritual yoga, this is not the one for you.

But you should definitely be at least an intermediate yoga because this is a serious, power yoga workout! And the 15 minute abs workout is a killer also.",1393200000,,450,4.232558139534884

5015633,5,B006T3QVBY,"This was one of my first yoga dvds, with no prior experience in it.  Most of the moves are doable for first timers.  For some of the poses they show both the basic and more advanced versions which is great as you get more flexible.  The buff dude does the beginners version and the two attractive yoga girls show the more advanced version of the poses.  The 60 minute workout does get you sweating and is great for keeping limber or even as a post workout stretch.  I didn't know any yoga prior to this and now that I have a couple other dvds I think this is my favorite.  Bob does talk you thru the pose, telling you how your positioning should be, where you should be feeling the stretch etc, which is good for beginners.  I've taken the stretches that I've learned here and use them in the gym after my workouts and I have far more strength in the stretch than I did before.  All in all it's a good workout you can do anywhere you have a tv and dvd player, Bob's innuendos with the girls are hilarious, you'll learn a lot of new stretches if you haven't done yoga before, the workout is fun, effective and will get you stronger in the stretch.",1391558400,,1146,4.224770642201835

I have balance issues due to meds that I'm on, I'm hoping doing this yoga will help.  I used to have extremely good balance.  Not sure I'll get to the point of the woman who did the Bird of Paradise move, but maybe that's something I will aspire to :-)  The best part was the relaxation at the end, Bob did a great job with that part, my heart rate went down super fast and lower than it usually does which was a nice surprise.

My mom liked it so much that she went and bought it for herself.

I just finished this workout and I have to say, I am amazed and feel fantastic!
I've been a yoga lover for a long time but always wanted something a bit more challenging that would burn more calories and help build lean muscle.
This is it!
The workout stayed true to the art of yoga, unlike some other videos I've tried  (Like Jillian Michaels Yoga Meltdown) and Bob talks you through the entire workout in a calm, encouraging manner.
The people in his video and his communication with them aren't distracting like in some videos.
I felt the burn in the first ten minutes and it just grew from there. By the time the hour was over, I was covered in sweat, my body was burning, and I felt fantastic.
I highly recommend this video. :)",1383696000,,787,4.346938775510204

5015650,5,B006T3QVBY,One of the best yoga videos that I have. The most important feature is the strength building and the stamina. The additional video is great for your core.,1382140800,,154,4.535714285714286
5015651,4,B006T3QVBY,"So Yoga X, which is part of P90X, is dreadful. 90 minutes of Tony talking to you while you're trying to do all these Yoga poses and clear your mind.  When you also have the flexibility of a 2x4, it becomes the day of the week you detest.

Enter this DVD -- touted by some as a good alternative for P90X, and I'm inclined to agree.  They do have some modifiers in here for those of us who lack flexibility, but we could use some more.

The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is that there are some moves that simply are too advanced for me due to the flexibility required, and there appears to be no way to modify, so I just have to sit there...also, there are things like pushups and shoulder presses added in there, that just don't seem to be in place -- I end up skipping those as well.

Still, if you can deal with 60 minutes of Yoga, this is a reasonably good subsitute for Yoga X -- especially for the price.",1381795200,,916,4.066666666666666

I'm a runner who, after too many injuries, needed to find something to replace running a couple days a week, and I needed to increase my flexibility. So, I thought I'd try yoga. I absolutely love, love, love this workout. I love The Biggest Loser and trusted Bob as a trainer. Since I was trying something new, I wanted to start off with someone I knew and trusted, so I ordered this routine. It kicked my butt the first several times I tried it. It took months before I could do some of the poses, and some of them I still can't do (and will never be able to do them due to knee and hip running injuries). That's ok. I appreciate being able to see others excel at it. I love Bob as an instructor, and I love the rock music. It just seems to fit and I find it very motivating. I love that the routine goes back and forth focusing on lower body strength and then upper body strength moves. This keeps me from getting too tired and overwhelmed, and it keeps the routine fun. I've been doing yoga about 8 months now - 1-2 times per week. I am definitely stronger and more flexible than when I started. I am in love with yoga. I wish I had started it years ago. I think I could have prevented my running injuries if I had been doing yoga along the way. If you're new to yoga, I think this DVD provides a great but fun workout. If you're advanced, then I'm not sure if you will find it challenging. It's hard for me to imagine a time that I won't find this routine challenging though. I love how Bob pushes you to be better and yet is encouraging and supportive at the same time. You can tell he wants you to succeed.",1368316800,4,1652,4.101851851851852

5015687,4,B006T3QVBY,"he states in the beginning, this is like nothing ever done before, and I have a DVD that is almost exactly the same choreography and moves as this one.

It's nice because he has various levels who are actually using correct form (which I do not find in the other DVD's of his)... it's presented in a very ""un yoga"" like ""western"" (rough) way, to satisfy the people who just like to ""pump iron"", ""move fast"", etc... so it's that type of energy...

It is a great workout, but definitely not the best yoga I've done, or the most unusual.  It's yoga.  It's a good DVD. It's a good workout.

Unfortunately when people not certified in yoga, ""teach"" yoga there is lots to be desired, like the constant breath cues, and other important mind/ body/ emotion connections of yoga, rather than just the ""western"" mentality of ""more & faster & more difficult  is better"" . . .  that's the main thing missing from this DVD.  I

I wouldn't suggest it to a beginner in yoga, since breath, correct posture is much more important  than trying to ""do what they are doing, and keep up""...

This yoga dvd is also a great workout, but he says ""It's not like any other yoga workout you've done"", which is kind of false.  If anyone has ever done Denise Austin, Power Yoga Plus, this is very similar...and that's an old dvd. Still...a great workout.  You will sweat and you should feel great when you are done. A lot of down dog, chaturanga, up-dog...feels great!  There are a couple moves the girls do that are without a doubt very advanced yoga poses.  I think you're in Warrior 2 and then you bend lower, one hand behind your back, the other hand under your leg, clasp both hands together, oh yeah, then you stand up in that position!  It's nuts!

He does not focus on breathing or on correcting poses. I recommend this for late beginners/intermediate level yoga student, who want a work out and not necessarily the meditative part of practicing yoga. For beginners, I would recommend taking a series of beginner classes at a local studio where you learn how to correctly hold poses. The teacher will take their time, and make sure you will not hurt yourself - where/how to breathe, keeping shoulders down, where your hips should be, where your head and neck should be in floor poses. That is missing from this video, which makes it ok for those who have a solid foundation. Also, in response to those who say ""it's strange how much he touches them"" - it is standard that teachers help correct poses using touch. Teachers should always ask at the beginning of a class if it is ok for them to touch you, and if you're not comfortable feel free to talk to them before hand - which is the part of the relationship you did not see at the beginning of the video.",1360972800,,1137,4.444976076555024

I chose this video based on the reviews.  While I loved the workout, and Bob's instruction was not irritating or overly ""yogi"" (a few I have tried were way too 'earthy' and cheesy for me to get through... and I am all about the meditation and soul-mind-body connection of yoga, so they were BAD!) I didn't find it was ""unlike any other yoga workout"" I have ever seen or done.  Maybe because I do the yoga fit class weekly for the last 8 months or so?

I also read reviews saying it was harder than P90X yoga X, and that it had people really sweating.  I had tried P90X yoga in the beginning months of my yoga journey, and I couldn't get through the first 15 minutes.  This video, I didn't sweat (literally or figuratively).

That being said - it is still an intense flow, and I did find there were 3 poses I could not fully get into, because I am still working on flexibility.  They are super advanced poses (standing split/half moon and bird of paradise) so maybe if I had gotten into the bird of paradise I would have worked up more of a sweat?

Overall, this is a great addition to my yoga practice, and I will keep it in the rotation for sure.",1360368000,,1401,4.113970588235294

I also have Jillian's yoga DVD, (yoga moves and a good workout but not yoga). This DVD is an advanced continuing yoga workout. Even modifiers are still difficult moves. Bob has a good knowledge of poses alignment and breathing into poses. As others have stated should not be attempted by beginners you may injure yourself in some of these poses.

5015710,5,B006T3QVBY,"When I first started getting healthier and working out I didn't know too much about the proper techniques and methods.  And that included not knowing that it's a good idea to do some stretching before some of the stuff that I was doing.

Without it I was risking injuries and in fact in sometimes I did feel the occasional twinge or tweak that I probably hadn't needed to have went through.

I also didn't realize how much being more flexible in general can help in all aspects of my life, not only in exercising and fitness but also in doing all of the regular day-to-day things.

And with Yoga I knew very little about when I started out.  Sure, I knew as much as anyone who had seen references to it on TV or in books might know and I remember having a girlfriend way back when I was young who did Yoga from time to time.

But I wasn't really introduced to it nor did I try it until we started doing Wii Fit Plus and then P90X.

Wii Fit Plus has some light fairly easy Yoga but it was a good start.  But P90X has an hour and a half of Yoga for one session.  Fairly hard, especially for someone who wasn't used to it, and quite long.

After trying a few other Yoga DVD's like some of Rodney Yee's stuff, as well as doing the P90X Yoga, P90X Stretch-X, and strengthening my core with other core and ab exercises - I found that I really enjoyed and was getting some great benefits from all of this particular area.  I was getting much, much more flexible and found that bicycling was easier, swinging my leg high to step over an obstacle was no big deal, and while I was certainly no where near the level of flexibility others might be - I still was many times more so than a short year before.

And Yoga is a great way to increase flexibility.

Sure, you can consider the relaxation aspect of it and what-have-you, but for me I like it for the stretching and flexibility it is giving me.  And I find almost all of the fitness and exercise I do to be a form of relaxation (even if I'm not relaxing physically) and de-stressor.

So while perusing Amazon and some other websites I came across mentions of Bob Harper's Yoga for the Warrior, part of his Inside Out Method series.  Looked good so we decided to try it.

First of all; this is NOT part of the Biggest Loser franchise.  I think you'll find this harder and in fact it's probably meant more for someone with intermediate/advanced abilities when it comes to fitness and Yoga then someone starting out.

Not that I'm very experienced with Yoga, but I am familiar with common Yoga moves now, and Bob doesn't give you instructions in proper form nor explain how to get into them.  He also doesn't pause and give you time if you're not real familiar with the proper form.  So it's probably best if you know something about Yoga and have done it before enough to A) know how to get into proper form as needed in a timely manner B) be flexible enough to get into the various poses and stretches in the first place.

Bob doesn't even do a lot of the moves but the three others who are doing the Yoga on the DVD with him do.

That's not to say that if you are a beginner you can't do this at all.  I have seen a number of reviews from those who have never done Yoga or are new to exercise and have no problem doing this Yoga workout DVD.  They can modify, take breaks, or whatever.

Robert, a large muscular gentleman, is the modifier on this DVD and those who are less experienced or less flexible perhaps, can follow him.  So you definitely don't need to do the positions exactly perfectly if you are not up to it, and you can still get a good yoga session anyway.  Yet you probably want to start out with another perhaps easier Yoga DVD if you haven't' done it before.

The two women on the DVD go through the moves in proper form and as instructed.  And they indeed are very flexible.  Like with the ""bird of paradise"" pose - very hard and the two women are in pretzelized form for this one.  My wife can't even do this one and she's very flexible.

As I said above - I'm much more flexible than I used to be but by no means real flexible, but I am proud to say that there are only two poses I can not do (including the ""bird of paradise"").  I may not be able to do them terribly well, but I can certainly do them and get a good stretch that I can feel.

So as mentioned previously; this is somewhat intermediate or advanced.  There are many very challenging moves (at least for me) and this isn't a laid-back, meditative Yoga like you may see on other DVD's.  There's really not much in the way of new-agey Yoga philosophy thrown into this.

Not that I have anything against that aspect but I'm doing it for the stretching and exercise and this DVD fits me perfectly.  You'll find that it's pretty much straight yoga and exercises, more a power Yoga, with some body weight exercises and modifications and some stuff that will work your abs and core.  And will make you sweat, as long as you're not phoning it in of course.

This is typical of some exercise DVD's in that there's a timer across the bottom of the screen, and it begins with lighter stretching and works on up to more advanced positions.

There's also no harps and melodic string instructions here either.  There's a range of instrumental music from generic hard rock to generic poppy rock, and some mellower stuff at the end.

You know right off the bat that Bob means business here, both because of the music as well as how he gets you right into it.

Bob really motivates you on this, rather than teaching you or wasting time showing you the techniques and proper positions - which I like.  I don't need needless instruction in how to do the moves - I can get that on other DVD's.  Besides, you can look at the tv screen right?

He's not quite as intense in this, as you would expect, as in something like ""Bob Harper's Inside Out Method Pure Burn Super Strength"" (see my review of it in this blog posting).  But he's all business-like and will keep you on track.

Well, I shouldn't say ""all business-like"" as he does joke with his people a bit.  Like during a taxing move where you hold one leg up for a period of time - he rests his head on the leg of one of the women, putting enough weight on her leg to make her scrunch her face up.  Bob's laugh, as always, would probably be silly and annoying in other people - but you know the guy is serious about what he's doing and it ends up endearing.  Besides, you don't want to make fun of a dude `s laugh who can probably kick your ass around the room.

So...I give this one some nice thumbs up.  Good exercise in general, interesting and fun and will make you sweat, as well as feel well-stretched when finished, and Bob's always motivational and will get you to where you want to go.

Also, on the DVD is a 15 minute Yoga Ab workout (well, it says 15 minutes but it's slightly more).  Not really a lot of Yoga in it but some nice core and ab strengthening exercise for sure.  You definitely want to try this part too.",1358726400,,6988,4.254738438210766
5015711,5,B006T3QVBY,"I just had to comment that this DVD was AMAZING! The moves were interesting and different than other yoga DVD's I have done, and they really can make you sweat. Great quality workout if you want a day off of cardio.

The workout is pretty basic for those who have practiced yoga with a couple of awesome, advanced poses.",1357776000,,320,4.5964912280701755
5015713,5,B006T3QVBY,"There are many yoga DVDs out there that are simply not challenging enough for me and this one did.  Although the poses themselves are not difficult (many basic postures), Bob has put together a very nice advanced yoga flow.

With that being said, my main concern with this DVD is alignment.  If you do not have a proper background of yoga, then this is not a good place to start.  Alignment is super important and he only touched on it a few times.  I noticed a few of the poses where the people in the DVD were out of alignment and no explaination was given to fix it.

But, overall, if you are looking for a more challenging/advanced/power yoga type of DVD and understand proper form, then this is a good buy.  I am looking forward to using this one again and growing stronger from it.",1357689600,,787,4.3493150684931505

I also love the 15-minute ab workout. You should be warned that 15 minutes with Bob Harper is NOT phoning in a workout for the day. You work harder for him than in 15 minutes than you would during much longer workouts videos.",1357171200,,580,4.321100917431193

5015717,4,B006T3QVBY,I like Bob Harper workouts and this one is no exception.  I cant believe how fast this 1 hour long workout seems to fly by.  I use this dvd midweek and typically workout five times per week.  I am now more flexible than i have ever been and my balance has improved greatly.  I typically will do the yoga workout until around there is around 10 minutes left in the workout.  At the 10 minute mark he goes into a lot of long stretches that I do not feel are that worthwhile.  I then switch to the 15 minute yoga abs workout that is part of this dvd which really isolates your abdominal region.,1356652800,,591,4.140350877192983

5015720,4,B006T3QVBY,"I really loved this workout. I usually don't do yoga DVDs. I've done workout DVDs like Chalean Extreme and p90x. However, Chalean's yoga segment kind of bored me, and I could never really get all the way through p90x's Extreme Yoga. Recently I started doing hot yoga which helps to loosen you up more to try out new moves. It's expensive though, so I decided to try out my mom's Yoga for the Warrior DVD. I did the one hour session and I loved it. It was hard, but I was still able to make it through it even after being sore from doing my Chalean DVD with heavy weights the day before. I really enjoyed the fact that I could stick in the beginner position and still get a good stretch even if I couldn't segway into the harder poses yet. Bob does a good job at warming up your body. There wasn't a pose I went into where I felt I was going into it cold. I would like an intermediate pose. Bob only offers a beginner and advance. If you're a beginner, I might watch the DVD through once, so you can get a feel for the poses since a good amount of the time you will be looking down while he instructs you how to move into your next pose. If anything I would familiarize myself with vinyasa. I didn't do the 15 minute abs because he does a bit of an ab workout before the cool down, and a lot of this hour WAS core if you're holding your abs in like you're supposed to. Overall, I loved it and I can't wait to implement this into my weekly routine and try the abs segment.",1353974400,,1470,4.072413793103448

This may be good for beginner's. And I don't consider myself advanced at all anymore now that I am back in school full time and work out maybe 3x per week. Now,  am intermediate at best. I really like Bob, but this one was a little disappointing. I give it two stars because I don't like it and was not challenged.

5015723,2,B006T3QVBY,"Bob Harper is very annoying in this video, that's the bottom line. He's always touching the girls which is inappropriate and unnecessary, and not only that, he keeps saying how hardcore this workout is when it's not that hard. He seems to think he's really hardcore and acts like he knows what he's doing in this video but he doesn't. Without his vague instruction the video might be a little better but I still think it would be annoying. It's like he thinks saying it's hardcore will make it more hardcore.

I usually like Bob Harper, this was my first of his DVDs and I found it a struggle to get through because of him.

The yoga workout itself is decent, but I feel Yogalosophy is a lot better and more effective.
The additional ab workout was disappointing, because  it was just variations of crunches and basic moves. I expected something more effective and challenging from a trainer like Bob Harper.
I'm not sold on his method, I don't know if I'll buy another one of his workouts but it seems like he probably has the same annoying attitude in all of his DVDs. I was very disappointed, I did this one about 4 times thinking it would get better but every time I just finished the workout in an annoyed mood. Isn't yoga supposed to make you feel the complete opposite way? Not cool, Bob, not cool.",1346112000,2,1305,4.474789915966387
5015724,5,B006T3QVBY,"Borrowed this from the library along with 12 other DVDs on yoga. I was a new beginner have never tried yoga or taken a class.  All the other DVDs were either far too slow (if I had 2 hours...I would be at a class!) or too ""cardio"" based to be effective. After 3 renewals at the library, I had to have.

Best part is that you can start basic by following along with Robert in the back, a football player sized athlete who clearly hasn't done yoga before either! As you get stronger and used to the moves, you can step it up harder and harder each time with the yoga master ladies.

Smooth transitions keep a good enough rhythm that you work up a major sweat, yet have enough time to do what yoga does best - breath deep and hold that pose a little longer, a little higher to get that extra burn.

5015726,4,B006T3QVBY,"I waited until the 2nd time doing this yoga practice until writing my review. I liked it MUCH better the 2nd time. I am an intermediate practioner and do yoga once or twice a week to keep my flexibility up. (Other DVDs I do are: Jillian Michaels' Yoga Meltdown, MTV Power Yoga w/ Kristen McGee, Yoga Zone Power Yoga--still one of my faves--and sometimes Brian Kest Power Yoga level 3.) I find this workout to be comparable if not SLIGHTLY more challenging than a few. The key is to do this with no air conditioning or fan going...that way you'll really sweat.

The poses are not really explained with a lot of detail so if you are new to yoga I would probably not recommend this DVD. Once you are familiar with the poses, this would be a great addition to your yoga DVD library.

Poses done include: vinyasas (several), tree, warriors 1 and 2, half moon, reverse triangle (twisting), triangle, reverse warrior, crescent, chair with twist, extended side angle, a nice ab section, and great twisting/compensatory poses.

Also my husband does obstacle course races like the Spartan Race series and wanted to add yoga to his training routine but couldn't get into any of the yoga dvds until I brought this one home. Beginners may find this a little too intense but it's great for those who are already very athletic and want to add yoga to their workout routine or for those who already do yoga and want to take it to the next level.

The hour went by too quickly doing this workout. I really liked it. There was not a single boring moment.
This is one of my favourite workouts. I was apprehensive that it might be too difficult as my heart was beating all the way up to my mouth when I first did Harper's Cardio Rev. Yoga for the Warrior was challenging, a focussed workout, but manageable. Due to a wrist injury, I can't do too many plank push ups, so I drop to my knees when the wrist starts to protest. That wrist also can't get into position for the wheel, so I don't push it. I either to a lower wheel, or stay with the bridge. Besides those, I could pretty much do everything else. There was a heart-stopping moment when he had the ladies transition from triangle pose to bird of paradise, however the guy was doing a less advanced pose which was a relief. To my surprise, I was also able to go from triangle to bird of paradise. I think by the time we got there in the DVD, the body was warmed up and limber enough. The fit and well-built guy doing the less advanced versions is also perspiring; it makes a point to me that we get a workout doing the level which suits us, not necessarily the advanced version.

5015744,4,B006T3QVBY,"When the dvd first started, I wasn't sure how I was going to like it. Having taken yoga classes for years, this was very different as far as the atmosphere goes. The backround music is hard rock and Bob is more like a physical trainer talking and motivating you to hold the pose just a little longer, you can do it, etc. After a few minutes into it, I have to say, I started to enjoy the practice. The poses were tough and if you know the names of the poses you can follow along without much looking at the screen. Many of the familiar poses were tweaked to make them more challenging than I have experienced before and two days later, I am still sore in my legs and deeper muscular areas like back and abs. My teenage son did the practice with me and he was dripping with sweat and struggling to keep the pace and he's pretty fit! Keep an open mind about this one. If you really hate hard rock, don't get it, but if you think it could motivate you it's worth giving it a shot. I am sure I will use it again and again.",1325462400,,1018,4.069651741293533
5015745,5,B006T3QVBY,"I absolutely LOVE this workout. I started yoga workouts with Bob's The Biggest Loser Weight Loss Yoga DVD when it first came out 2 years ago. But when I saw this one come out, I knew I was ready for a challenge. So I bought it and let it sit on the shelf for a long time, because I was frankly intimidated by an hour-long yoga ""for the warrior"" workout. I was right to be cautious!
But once I did the 60-minute workout, I was addicted. It has moves I could do when I started, some I have been able to do as I continued the workout and positions I have yet to be able to accomplish (which gives me a challenge to work towards).
As for the 15 minutes abs session, I have tried it once, but only made it through half of the extremely challenging workout!",1325116800,,751,4.081081081081081
5015746,5,B006T3QVBY,"This DVD is a workout that manages to stay true to yoga.  Unlike Jillian Michael's Yoga Meltdown, Bob Harper's yoga warrior is actually a yoga practice and it's a darn tough one.  Bob includes strengthening positions like Warriors 1, 2, and 3, balancing positions like Tree and Half Moon poses, core positions like Bridge, Plank, and Crunches.  I have tried Mimi Solaire (too gentle), Rodney Yee (too advanced), and other yoga dvds.  This one is my favorite.  I have even gotten my husband into it.

The workout is 1 hour long, about 45 minutes of which is intense.  The last quarter of the work out includes floor stretching and 3 minutes of savasana.  There is an unobtrusive clock at the bottom of the screen that tells you how much time you have left and what pose you are doing.  I personally think Bob's instruction is excellent.  I spend very little time looking at the screen.",1325116800,7,884,4.645161290322581
5015747,3,B006T3QVBY,"This is a pretty intense yoga-based fitness workout, and definitely will make you sweat.  However, the transitions between the poses seems disjointed and illogical.  Finally, the instruction is not so great, and even a little creepy at times.  If you're looking for an intense, yoga-based workout, I would go with Jillian Michael's Yoga Meltdown or Tony Horton's Yoga-X.",1323475200,,370,5.344827586206897
5015748,4,B006T3QVBY,"To start off, I'm a fitness + yoga instructor and an advanced exerciser who's kind of on the fence about Bob Harper. I have a couple of his other dvds and I like that he does challenging workouts; however, I'm not a fan of his queuing in terms of form/safety/modifications.

Being an instructor I have taught/taken my share of yoga classes and have tried several dvds in the past and am pretty picky about which ones I use, though I definitely try to be open about different yoga styles. I'm definitely not a purist about yoga! Still, I was hesitant to get Bob Harper's dvd mainly because that's not his area of expertise (at least to my knowledge)...I generally like to get yoga dvds with reputable yoga instructors, not from instructors/trainers who are perhaps experts of other areas in the fitness industry. That's just me.

Still, I heard a lot of good buzz about this, and the other dvds I have by him are pretty rough, so I figured I'd give this one a shot. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by some of the moves done in this dvd (wheel, binding poses...very advanced) and it was generally a nice mix and a nice flow to the whole thing. I was also interested in the background music -- it was kind of rock, which I've never experienced in a yoga class/dvd, but it was surprisingly not distracting, and I thought it worked.

As for the cons, I had expected this dvd to be a lot tougher, but I think I've actually sweated more during my own classes, so that was a little disappointing. Also, I think he could have done a bit more queuing in terms of proper form and alignment, as well as shown more modifications for those who are absolute beginners. Finally, this might not be an issue for some people, but I have a thing about dvds/classes where the instructor doesn't do any of the moves with you, and they have a sort of trainer approach to teaching. (or at least with my experience with trainers, they don't do the exercises with their clients) and for some reason that irks me a bit. I can't help but wonder if they'd be all cocky and self-assured if they were dripping in sweat like everyone else. But it's a small thing, I can overlook it. :P

So, on the whole, I think this dvd is alright. I'd give it a 3.5 if I could, but instead I'm just rounding it up to a 4, mainly because I could see myself doing this dvd once in a while. It's a bit different and makes for a nice variation to throw into your workout routine.",1322006400,7,2433,4.364238410596027
5015749,4,B006T3QVBY,"I bought this at BJ's for $10, because I like Bob on Biggest Loser but I've never tried any of his DVD's.  I figured $10 was a good price to try one out and since I've done yoga, on and off, for years, this was a good fit for me.  I have feet problems, so I can't do a lot of the jumping around videos that he (and others) make.

One of the reasons I enjoy yoga so much is the spiritual side of it, which this video has none of...but I don't seem to miss it here.  Bob's no-nonsense approach works, and the workout is pretty thorough. You will get a full body burn on this DVD.

If you are a beginner, there is a ""modifier"" you can watch (a person that does the moves at a lower level of intensity).  For those that are more advanced, there are two others to watch.  But, like others have said, it would be best if you already know how to do most of the moves properly, because his attention to form is a bit lacking.  If you don't already know the moves, please just go slowly and don't try to push too hard or you may end up with a pulled muscle or ten.

All in all, though...after over two months, I still enjoy doing this DVD every few days.",1319760000,,1145,3.965065502183406

5015751,4,B006T3QVBY,"I do yoga at home a couple times a week and was interested in seeing what Bob Harper's take on it would be.  I have tried his Inside Out Cardio Series, and it was tough (I mean, seriously, when the exercisers look like they are going to cry you know you are in for it).  I would say I am an intermediate practicer of yoga and this dvd would fall in the intermediate to more advanced category.  Here are my pros and cons:

Pros: good form and good cuing on the moves, also there is one person who is not Gumby's cousin doing the moves, so for those less flexible you can watch the guy in the back.  You are still getting a good workout but the modifications will help you if you are not quite up to the moves. Bob does have a good warm-up and also a nice cool down with my favorite...Shavasana...or corpse pose.  I was born to lay on the floor like that....man, after sweating up a storm it felt incredible.  I liked the length of the dvd, 1 hour for the full yoga program and a bonus yoga abs workout for 15 minutes.  The moves are classics that you've done before, up dog, down-dog, triangle, warrior one & two, half moon pose, chair pose, bridge, etc.  Nothing really new there, but there is one called ""bird of paradise"" that was quite challenging.  In yoga though challenging is good.  Just don't push, let your body go to where it feels good.  Yoga is about breathing and working through a difficult position while still keeping yourself calm and keeping your breath even. I felt he was bringing me a challenging program but it was a little more toned down than the instruction for the cardio, which was fitting.

Cons: The music was ok....a bit of a driving rock beat, which I would normally love, but not necessarily when I am doing yoga. As far as being completely different, I don't really think so.  I have lots of yoga dvds, Bryan Kest, Yoga Zone, Sara Ivanhoe, Shiva Rea, and Rodney Yee.  I felt he did make some of the poses more like doing reps which did tend to exhaust my muscles a little more, kind of in the same vein as Jillian Michaels's Yoga dvd, but new?  Eh, not so much.

Overall, surprisingly good yoga dvd. I definitely got a workout and also did the abs workout, which is focused and tough (in a good way).  If you like Bob's teaching style and are already familiar with yoga this might be a nice addition to your collection.  If you are looking for a more basic dvd to start out with I would choose something else until you have mastered the poses and want to expand your practice.",1316822400,2,2509,4.311300639658849
5015752,5,B006T3QVBY,"I have other Bob Harper ""Inside Out"" training DVD's and have enjoyed them.  They challenge me and I have achieved some very satisfying results.  I always felt that something was missing from my workout routine and had decided that it was stretching.  So my natural choice is to continue on with the ""Inside Out"" DVD training series so I purchased Yoga for Warriors.  I was very please with this DVD in that, at my fitness level ( I have been working out religiously for over a year) that I could do about 95% of the poses.  Of course, there are some poses that I will never be able to do, but the ""modified"" poses in the video seem to have the same impact as the more difficult poses.  Overall I had to give this video 5 stars because it did exactly what I intended it to do, which was stretch my body after two days of heavy aerobics or sculpting, which is my current training routine over a 5-6 day training schedule.",1316217600,,919,4.313953488372093

Bob does move very quickly through the poses, but I didn't find any problems with the flow or order of the poses. All in all I think this is going to be a great addition to my collection, and I can't wait to see how much I improve!",1315785600,,529,3.953271028037383

This is great for a lighter, all inclusive yoga day, stretching, strengthen, great ab work, and difficult balance poses.  Bob moves the positions along fairly quickly, not allowing much time to dig in and hold the position for muscle fatique or get a nice long stretch, but the pace certainly doesn't allow you to get bored either.  The seperate ab workout alone is a killer and worth the price of the video.  In comparison, Biggest Loser video does not contain the balance poses but does have a lot more planks, push ups, and T stands which I like to have for a greater upper body workout, plus a light hand weight section.  Bob's Biggest Loser weightloss yoga is a more strengthening and sweat producing workout.

5015760,3,B006T3QVBY,"I have done Bob Harper's other workout DVDs and I love them.  He does a great job of combining strength and cardio for a truly hard workout.  I was expecting the same with this DVD.  However, it did not live up to my expectations.  I was anticipating a workout similar to Jillian Michael's Yoga Meltdown.  This is much mellower and with less instruction.  He does a lot of downward dog, which I don't feel is a challenging position.  Also, you can't watch the screen to see what the next move is.  I would have liked more movement to get my heart rate up.
I did appreciate that he shows different levels of each position, because I am not very flexible.  The first 10 and last 10 minutes were basically just stretches, which was relaxing, but not the intensity I would expect from Bob.  If you want a better cardio yoga workout, try Jillian Michaels instead.",1308182400,,858,4.47741935483871

5015763,4,B006T3QVBY,"This is one of THE greatest ab workouts I've ever done.

This is a 2 part DVD - ""Yoga For The Warrior"" and a 15 minute Yoga ab workout - so this review will address both parts:

15 MINUTE YOGA AB WORKOUT

Amazing. Simply amazing. One of the hardest ab workouts I've ever done. Buy this dvd for that alone - it's SO worth it!

I'm a Bob Harper fan so I thought it would be just great fun having him take me through a 15 minute ab workout ... boy was I wrong! Bob is great! - the 15 minutes are pure hell on earth. The morning that this portion of the dvd are in my workout rotation are the scariest mornings of the week! - Just like Jaws has forever changed how we think of swimming in the ocean - these 15 minutes will forever change the way you look at your DVD player!

Best ab workout ever! - again, buy this DVD just for that - you won't regret it! - you may never be able to look at Bob or you DVD player the same way, but you'll LOVE the workout and more importantly - the results!

YOGA FOR THE WARRIOR

""Yoga For The Warrior"" - is ""good"", it's not great, but it's good - and if you're a Bob Harper fan (like myself) you'll love having him in your living room putting you through a workout.

I wouldn't recommend it for someone who has never done Yoga, but if you've been to like 3 classes and are somewhat familiar with posses and concepts, then you're good to go.

This DVD is not a ""purist"" Yoga practice - so if you're looking for that, that spiritual, flowing, life-energy vibe type of practice then this is not for you - this is more about the 'work out' aspect of Yoga - the muscles flexing, sweat inducing, fun yet tough work out

Side note - a bridge between that traditional practice (as best as it can be on a DVD) and a workout for the sake of working out would be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crunch-The-Perfect-Yoga-Workout-The-Joy-of-Yoga-Fat-Burning-Yoga/dp/B00005NQGR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crunch - The Perfect Yoga Workout: The Joy of Yoga & Fat-Burning Yoga</a>&nbsp;(taught by Sara Ivanhoe) - that's a great Yoga dvd/workout (one of the best out there) and makes this dvd ""Yoga For The Warrior"" a great dvd to add into rotation as a compliment or switching up 2nd tier type of practice.

In the end - the ""Yoga For The Warrior"" section I give 3 stars - the 15 minute ab part - I give 5 stars ... and a reminder ... buy this DVD! ... but you've been warned ... (insert Jaws theme song here)",1307059200,,2467,4.423841059602649
5015764,5,B006T3QVBY,This is a great workout! I could tell the next day that I had worked every muscle. The poses are challenging but not too hard for the beginner.

They are usually generic and don't offer greaqt instruction if you don't already know what you're doing which can be extremely dangerous. This dvd is the great exception! Bob's workout was very challenging even for me and i've been doing yoga for 10+ years. His routine was innovative and unique. He gives AMAZING instruction of form and gives all levels of each pose. This video would be wonderful for someone who has never tried yoga before. I normally think yoga should be taught in person but Bob does it right.,1306108800,,577,4.666666666666667

At home, I have tried many yoga dvd's, hoping to find one that best imitates a true vinyasa class.
This is by far my favorite yoga dvd that I have found. Jillian Michael's Yoga Meltdown is a close second.

I also own Bob's Biggest Loser Yoga dvd, which is a great workout, however it is not in the traditional vinyasa style.

It looked like a great workout, so the next day, I opened up the video and popped it in the DVD player. It was one of the best workouts I've ever had. I don't know what I was really expecting since I had never done Yoga before, but I was very pleased. The entire routine works to strengthen the entire body and greatly improve balance and coordination. I am using it as part of my weight loss program, and it is really working for me. I also do P90X.

My abs have strengthened faster and better using his routines instead of wandering from machine to machine. I now have a disciplined workout that flows and improves with ease and confidence! I preview the dvd a few times on the MP3 while doing a 30 min cardio on the elliptical etc (to save my aging knees).

I'm looking for more of DVDs to load and use at the gym and balance out my workouts.

PRO:
A great well delivered workout with enthusiastic delivery - much better than hit and miss with instructors at $10+/lession!

Even more impressive, the 2 women in this video make the Yoga X girls look like beginners!  I actually purchased this DVD at Sam's wholesale for $8.99 and it's worth every penny.

I agree with another review: Bob starts by saying that ""this is yoga like you've never done before"" --- I do not know to whom he is talking, then. I did not find this routine to be a revelation, but I still think it is a very good yoga workout. Some poses do challenge balance, but they are not the majority of the workout. It is very good to see 2 of the 3 participants do the full poses and one participant do what he can, but correctly --and Bob makes sure to point out that this person is doing exactly what he should be doing: be in the pose and feel the pose to the best of his ability. It is also true that this workout is reminiscent of the BL Yoga for weight loss (clearly), but is not paced the same, nor are the poses all the same and in the same order. There are  new poses here and the ambiance is also quite different. I like this routine very much and enjoy the one-hour length of yoga routine I can get with it. At the end of it, I do feel challenged (I am not a pro at yoga, nor am I very flexible, but I'm not a broom stick either!), but also relaxed and calmed.

There were moments when I thought my legs/arms would collapse because they just couldn't do it anymore. However, I trusted Bob and the one thing I've learned throughout my health journey and that is that my body is stronger and more capable than I realize! I love yoga and I love that someone has finally created a DVD workout that so strongly mirrors the fast-paced yoga classes I used to take at RDV Sportsplex.

Oh, and I'm not sure what all those people are talking about when they say it isn't yoga. He does legit yoga poses throughout- downward/upward facing dog, warrior 1 & 2, triangle, etc. A big plus was also that the timing and pace combined with the intensity of the poses themselves provided a meditative benefit on their own as I was so focused in the present moment the stress of everyday life melted away. :)

ENJOY!",1299542400,39,1432,5.085106382978723
5015778,2,B006T3QVBY,"The music for this DVD seems mismatched, maybe it was a mistake?  The workout itself is okay, could be more challenging and have better flow but the music really takes away even more from the pace and flow.",1299196800,,206,4.421052631578948
5015779,4,B006T3QVBY,"I really liked this video; it was a great workout and I felt wonderful afterwards. I would rate it 5 stars but I thought it actually could have been a bit harder, with at least some more advanced moves, but perhaps that was not its intention. In any case, it was an excellent Power Yoga workout, not boring or repetitive like some other yoga videos, and you really feel it, especially in the thigh muscles (quads). Good instruction from Bob, so even when you are not looking at the screen, you know what to be doing and how to position your body. I have a lot of the ""soothing"" type yoga videos so I liked that this one was different!",1298332800,,634,4.291666666666667
5015780,5,B006T3QVBY,"The Yoga for the Warrior DVD is very worthwhile.  It is challenging but doable--it gives you some goals to work towards.  I've done yoga for 40 years, and I wanted something challenging, but still real yoga.  This is power yoga, and intense.  You must be familiar with yoga before doing this DVD, but if you are, then go for it!",1297987200,2,328,4.416666666666667
5015781,5,B006T3QVBY,"People, please stick to assessing the merits and quality of the actual yoga DVD itself, rather than subtracting stars merely because ""it is similar to others out there.""  That level of feedback helps no one who is here to learn more about THIS particular DVD, and whether it offers good value for the money.

Yoga for the Warrior features a good mix of challenging poses, with reasonable modifications so folks can work their way up, and it is great for those who want a solid, sweat-inducing yoga practice without all the spiritual-speak present in other market offerings. Not that there's anything wrong with that, if that's what feeds your soul.  But not everybody's looking for new age salvation and path enlightenment from their yoga practice. Some are just looking to increase range of motion, reduce stress and improve their overall mobility and health profile.  And that's OK.  (If they discover more along the journey, good for them, but that's not for you or any of us to prescribe, project or otherwise concern ourselves with.  Let each one take from yoga that which serves them, and discard the rest.)

Anyone who's done yoga for awhile now has already gotten the memo to focus on breath, work poses to your own degree, modify when and where necessary, etc. (There are plenty of beginner-style DVDs that offer more of the same, for those who want or need it.)  THIS is for people oriented towards the style of power yoga, who are looking for a more physical practice to complement a weight-loss and strengthening/conditioning program, which they can do from the comfort of their home. Period.

Bottom line:  If you are a yoga purist seeking a more traditional practice, or a total beginner, simply look elsewhere or stick to the studio instruction of your choice.  People who love Bob, and who appreciate his training philosophy and penchant for getting results - and making yoga accessible to the masses - get exactly what they want and need from this DVD.  (The additional 15-minute yoga abs routine is a nice bonus, for days when you need to supplement another cardio or strength training workout with isolated core work, but don't have time to layer on a full yoga class.)",1297814400,165,2188,4.836461126005362
5015782,4,B006T3QVBY,"I really love this yoga workout.  I have always enjoyed Bob and Jillian's workouts and recently discovered this one.  It is very challenging and very effective.  I also love, love, love the separate Ab routine.  If you have had instruction in yoga before then this workout is great.  My only comment is that he really doesn't instruct on proper yoga positioning and that is very important to not injure yourself.  Since I am experienced with yoga then this workout was really fun and challenging.  I would recommend it as long as you learn the positioning beforehand.  This DVD is now part of my daily exercise variety and I use the Ab routine on days with my other DVDs.  Variety is key for my fitness goals and it keeps it fun.",1297728000,,729,4.546153846153846
5015783,5,B006T3QVBY,Have used this a few times and I love this DVD.  I am very into power yoga and does this deliver exactly what I wanted.  Perfect on the days I'm just not in the mood to drive to the gym but still want to get a work out.,1297468800,,219,3.5416666666666665
5015784,3,B006T3QVBY,"This video seems to be suffering from some identity confusion.  I actually enjoyed the first thirty minutes of the main workout.  It consists of yoga that, although not necessarily innovative or radically different from many other yoga videos, was well composed and choreographed in order to give your muscles a nice burn.  Then the yoga part seems to come to a screeching halt as the workout, less than 2/3 complete, turns into a few crunches and then a whole lot of traditional stretching.  I get that stretching is good, but the amount of time devoted to stretching seems excessive given the low-impact (and naturally stretch-intensive) nature of the workout.  The ab workout is powerful, but has little to nothing to do with yoga.

I'm not a die-hard yogi by any means, so I don't object to this video not being yoga simply because it isn't ""traditional"" yoga (I'm a huge fan of Jillian Micheal's yoga video, for example).  It just seems slightly...confused.  I actually would have given the video 4 stars simply because it really does provide a decent, body weight-based workout, but I hate, hate, hated the music.  Yoga certaintly does not require new age-y music, of course, but I found the heavy metal-esque instrumental playing in the background to be unpleasant and distracting.",1297209600,2,1288,4.953488372093023
5015785,3,B006T3QVBY,"I have seen the Biggest Loser and Bob Harper does a lot of yoga on the show, leading me to expect this to be a good yoga workout.  Unfortunately I did not enjoy Bob's yoga.  I do not think it has a good form or flow.  It does not give you the stretch and alignment it should.  I would caution against doing this workout if you are unfamiliar with yoga as Bob does not do enough to explain good form or positioning, and also throws in a couple of advanced moves that could lead to injury in beginners.  I would class this more as a strength workout using what look like yoga moves.  That being said, it does give you a strength workout, and strengthen muscles you would use doing a real yoga workout!",1296604800,,699,4.17910447761194
5015786,5,B006T3QVBY,Although this isn't the most challenging yoga DVD I've ever done it's still a solid hour of yoga that covers the bases and flows rather well.  I agree with the other reviewers that Bob's Weight Loss Yoga DVD is harder but this one is nice to do on those days when I don't feel like I can handle a Mark Blanchard DVD (that guy doesn't mess around) but still want a good yoga workout.  I really like Bob's teaching style and find him very motivating.  If you want to lose weight I'd recommend Bob's other DVD but if you want to add a moderately challenging and enjoyable yoga workout to your rotation I think this one would fit the bill.,1295654400,4,635,4.275
5015787,2,B006T3QVBY,"First let me say that I have been practicing for a year and I have become a yoga snob.  That said, I don't think Bob Harper is a total waste of time when it comes to yoga.  For one thing, he is kinda yummy to look at; for another he has that kinda cute slight southern twang.

But Bob, I have a couple of questions.  One is can you please just let me root in and feel my poses for a while before you make me move on?  Second, why did you have to ruin a yoga practice with, of all things, crunches?  And three, did you really think that moving into triangle pose from extended side angle was the most pleasant choreography?  I mean, really?  It wasn't.  Sometimes your directions are just bad, Bob.  And that ""Awkward airplane"" thing you seem so fond of?  It's just that.  Awkward.

Admittedly it is a good workout and it is fun to see otherwise ""athletic"" people struggling to hold poses (although sometimes poorly, see conspicuously muscular black guy in the background), and it's humorous to see them nearly fall over when they think they are so buff and tough, but if REAL yoga--the kind that makes you root in, tune out the world, and feel physically, spiritually, and emotionally rejuvenated--is what you crave, Bob isn't going to give that to you.

At any rate, it was worth the $9 at Target to give it a whirl.  It is, after all, cheaper than attending a yoga session at a studio so if you want to give delicious Bob a try, consider it eye candy and a decent workout.",1295568000,6,1474,4.3090909090909095
5015788,5,B006T3QVBY,"I was tired of getting on the treadmill everyday, so I bought a couple of DVD's and the EA Sports Active 2.  I think this is a really good workout.

I had never done yoga before, but I was able to follow along by watching and listening to Bob.",1295568000,,335,3.757142857142857
5015789,5,B006T3QVBY,"I was first introduced to doing yoga while I was doing the P90X program. I really enjoyed the yoga workout in P90X, but the biggest problem was that it was a 2 hour long workout. Its hard enough to find 1 hour most of the time to commit to a workout like this for me. So I decided to look for something with the same intensity, but not as long. I researched on a lot of different videos and didn't really find one I thought would be similar. Then I came across this one. I have a lot of respect for bob, but I didn't want a Biggest Loser workout. This is not that. I lucked out , because this was the 1st one I actually purchased. And it was exactly what I was looking for. Just as intense as P90X  but in half the time.",1294272000,147,720,3.9315068493150687
5015790,3,B006T3QVBY,"I like to do yoga for the workout, but I don't enjoy the mind-body aspect where you lie very still at the end and focus on breathing and clearing your mind. This is definitely not that kind of video. Bob talks and yells through the entire workout and plays rock music in the background. This is a good intermediate yoga video for someone who wants to do the yoga moves but not have the traditional yoga experience.",1294185600,5,414,4.3896103896103895
5015791,3,B006T3QVBY,"I have Bob's first Yoga dvd, Weight Loss Yoga and am extremely challenged and pleased with it.  I have been doing that workout for over a year, mixed with other workouts and it's still a great workout.  So I thought I'd try his new dvd hoping for even more of a challenge and longer yoga workout.  I just got the dvd and so have only done it once through, but I could tell during and after the workout that I thought his first weight loss yoga was much harder and felt like more of a workout than this one.  There are more balance poses in this one and you do much of the same poses, but he doesn't make you hold them as long in this workout. The yoga workout is one hour.  There is a 15 minute workout option which is really just for your abs, now this was hard!  I would probably do the Weight Loss Yoga dvd and then finish with this 15 minute abs workout.  The music is not relaxing at all, where his weight loss yoga is still more of a workout with the added benefit of a more relaxing tone and music with great instruction.
Overall,  it's an ok workout, and I may alternate it with the Weight Loss yoga, but if you're looking for more of a challenge, I highly recommend you try Bob's Weight Loss Yoga instead.  Since I currently do that yoga dvd 2-3x's a week,  I was expecting much more from this.  My Husband also does the workouts and agrees the other one is more of a workout all in one hour.",1294012800,14,1401,4.113970588235294

8503887,4,B006T3QVBY,"I've been practicing yoga for almost 17 years and teaching for just over two.  I teach mainly beginners, focusing on a gentle practice connecting body and mind (I'm also a psychologist).  Although my own practice has developed over the years, I still tend to prefer slower, more thoughtful styles of yoga.  Given this, a yoga routine labelled a ""workout"" is NOT usually my thing!  Still, I was curious about instructor Bob Harper, as I had never tried any of his DVDs.  (I am a primarily home exerciser and own over 100 videos.)

This DVD offers two routines:  an almost hour-longer ""Yoga Workout"" and a 17-minute ""Yoga Abs.""  In both, Harper is teaching live with three background exercisers, Leah and Kristen, who is more intermediate-to-advanced, and Robert, who modifies many of the poses.  Most of the time, Harper is walking around the room while teaching, although he does pause to briefly join in at times.  The music for both routines is loud and rock-like, but instrumental only.  Both workouts have an on-screen timer as well as the names of all of the poses printed on-screen.  I have listed the poses as they appear, adding parenthetical comments; I will also add my impressions at the end of each section.

YOGA WORKOUT (58m)
Forward Bend (held/hang)
Mountain Pose
Downward Dog
Shoulder Press (from dog pose)
Plank
Cobra (baby version)
Crescent Pose
Plank to Chaturanga (moving up/down several times)

Chair Pose
Warrior 1 - Warrior 2 (this transition is repeated MANY times)
Warrior 1 - Warrior 2 (2nd side)
Chair Pose - Twisting Chair Pose
Tree Pose
Push Ups (5 total)
Table Top - Awkward Airplane (1 arm/1 leg out to side)
Table Top - Awkward Airplane (2nd side)

Triangle Pose - Twisting Triangle
Triangle Pose - Twisting Triangle (2nd side)
Shoulder Press (from dog)
Hand to Big Toe Pose (standing)
Standing Splits - Half Moon Pose - Forward Fold - Mountain
Standing Splits - Half Moon Pose - Forward Fold - Mountain (2nd side)

Twisting Glute Stretch (half-fish pose)
Seated Forward Fold
Reclined Twist
Fish Pose
Shivasana/Final Rest (aka Shavasana/Savasana; <2 minutes)
(finish seated)

Harper calls this practice ""tough"" and notes that he will be ""coloring outside the lines.""  I actually found this to be a pretty standard vinyasa flow routine, similar to the all-levels flow classes that I sometimes attend.  As with my in-person classes, I sometimes choose to skip the vinyasa transitions in this workout, and there were also a few things I couldn't do, like Bird of Paradise.  For an experienced yogi, I think this might be a tiring but very doable practice.

YOGA ABS (17m)
Warm Up (reclined rocking, alternating knees in)
Crunches (add twisting version)
Center Crunches
Scissors
Extended Leg Crunches
Core Rotations (reclined)
(at 6m, come to seated for boat series)
Half Boat Twists
Half Boat Crunches (boat to half boat)
Half Boat Arm Pulses
Boat Extensions (legs in and out)
Crunches
Bicycle
Pulses
Leg Extension Crunches
Mountain Climbers (knee to elbow from plank)
Plank
Mountain Climbers (round 2)
Stretch and Cool Down (seated butterfly, seated single leg extension, seated double leg extension, neck stretches, breathe)

As with the full routine, I found the abs workout to be tough but doable, especially when I modified the moves that didn't work for me (e.g., mountain climbers).  Some other reviewers have suggested that this section is NOT yoga, but these are typical moves that you WILL seen in a live vinyasa flow class, which can include anything from crunches to boat to plank work.

In general, I liked these routines for what they were, namely more ""workout""-oriented yoga.  I had more mixed feelings about Harper himself.  He seemed somewhat belittling of Robert, constantly pushing him to go deeper rather than praising his ability to modify at his own level.  Furthermore, his physical adjustments of the women seemed on the verge of being inappropriate--while I love getting physical assists in live classes, I would definitely NOT be happy if a male instructor (or female, for that matter) touched me in that way!  Finally, Harper is constantly repeating himself, particularly the phrase ""all I want you to do now is...""
