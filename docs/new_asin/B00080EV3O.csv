8182220,3,B00080EV3O,"I bought this film in a budget bin hoping to see a REAL quality horror film with veteran scream queen Brinke Stevens. What I got was a almost endless parade of nude women pretending to be actresses, who belong on late night cable TV. There almost is no plot , very fake halloween store blood, and knives, and little dialog, which is good because most of the females in the film look like they just came out of a strip club, and can't act at all. When they talk you feel like laughing, they are so incredibly bad. If you want a real serious horror film pass this one by fast. I would give it five stars or more for the actresses, or aren't by any means real actresses, [still it is NOT a REAL horror film, in fact it is barely a film]. It held my interest alot more than some of the other movies made on a shoe string budget which are filmed in the dark, go nowhere, are boring, with droning heavy metal music, and very poor camera work. I am astounded at times watching low budget films, that the people making them don't spend more time on the plot. WHY?",1309046400,,1055,4.176470588235294
8182221,1,B00080EV3O,same crap as demon seduction and they both suck its main hook is that these chicks are horny as hell and blood is the only thing that gets them off (sounds good I know but its isn't) so the best part of the movie is  this shot of a brunet chick dancing nakie while buckets of blood are thrown on her and she rubs it in kinda hot but only last for few seconds and not really worth sitting through the stupid alien story  line,1208131200,7,424,3.976470588235294
