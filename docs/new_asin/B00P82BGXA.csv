6788966,4,B00P82BGXA,"Zack Lawrence of IndyChristianReview reviewed my movie, Gramps Goes to College this week. I thought I'd return the favor. Last night I watched Zack's movie In His Steps. Most Christians will pick up on the fact that this is not an original story, although Zack made some adjustments to the story line in his adapting it to a movie script. It's also not an original movie. A few others have been made based on this novel that coined the phrase and the craze, ""What Would Jesus Do"" (WWJD). That means that people will compare this version of the movie with previous movies and with the book. It's hard to stack up against that kind of competition. I think I've seen them all and have read the book probably three times. I love the story and it, along with Not Peace but a Sword by Vance Havner are my perfect illustrations for how sermons can be delivered succinctly through the media of fiction, whether film or book. I had a bit of a personal stake in this one. Rich Swingle, one of the actors, is a dear friend. I know several of the other cast members from Facebook, including Zack. The one cast member I don't know at all, Laura Seabrook was a shining star in this one. The rest of the cast held up their end responsibilities adequately. Camera work was certainly not a distraction and some of the scenes were downright cinematically beautiful. I have to admit that I prefer the book version. In all truthfulness, it is very hard for a movie to compete with an excellent book. So I can't in all fairness condemn this movie because it doesn't equal or better the original source material. I can compare it against the other flicks that attempted to meet the same challenge. I think this version of In His Steps holds its own against the other candidates. As Zack would ponder in his reviews: is this one worth watching? I say definitely it is. The salient point made by this movie is that following Jesus involves radical living which will alienate even people in the church. I can say a hearty ""amen"" to that.",1429920000,10,2012,4.5

6788970,5,B00P82BGXA,Great Movie.  Makes you really think.  Convicting!  Imagine really doing what Jesus would do in every situation.  I noticed how many people were against it.  That's real life.  I didn't like the ending.  Wanted to rewrite that part.  Maybe that's where you and I come in.  I want to be one of the few who take this challenge.  What about you?,1519084800,,342,4.459016393442623
6788971,4,B00P82BGXA,"As with many of the Christian movies out there (you know, everyone is in the business of making God movies right now), the acting is a bit wooden, and the production a bit amateurish, but my thinking is the story was worth the watch because it makes you think about your own true commitment to your Christianity.  I would think this film would make a good discussion starter for a youth group.  I'd recommend watching it.",1517011200,,421,4.526315789473684
6788972,5,B00P82BGXA,"This is excellent. I think its a great depiction of how in the church if you actually follow the words and steps of Christ, you will suffer persecution. You may lose your family, your friends and your loved ones, but this is the price that you pay in a lukewarm church or lukewarm followers. Its worse with your unbelieving family that won't understand when you go to the bad neighborhood to serve. There is a lot of evil in this world, the radicalization of Christians is the only way to overcome. If you lose your life for My sake, you will find it. Walking with Christ is about serving others, and so much of the church doesn't realize this. That's what this movie is all about. I really liked some of the character twists in this movie. I think this will be a classic.",1514073600,,772,4.368055555555555

6788975,4,B00P82BGXA,"The two young ladies that played the roles of Rachel and Virginia were good actresses. The others...hmmm.
In spite of subpar acting, it was a good take on the book and I watched it from beginning to end. Most likely, it was a real reflection on how people would respond when we follow Jesus wholeheartedly.",1504483200,3,306,4.581818181818182
6788976,1,B00P82BGXA,"Although the story is touching and thoughtful, this rendition is pretty pathetic.

6788979,5,B00P82BGXA,"The writer did an amazing jog depicting real christian problems.  Low budget acting - I've come to like low budget acting.  Have you seen what kind of filth blockbuster actors are playing?  Just a great film in terms of getting a christian message across.  the story is 4 stars, maybe 3.5, but some of the scenes were very real issues and well done and therefore deserves a 4.5.  I'm giving it a 5 to get more people to watch. WWJD!!!",1499817600,4,434,4.375
6788980,5,B00P82BGXA,"I think it may have started off a little sluggish, but as for all the comments about the acting, it wasn't that bad or it got a whole lot better. I honestly don't remember. I got involved in the movie and with the characters and it didn't cross my mind. So, they either got a whole lot better or I got a whole lot better at relating to them.
Anyway, it has a few different points being made. They main point pretty much summed up to, ' are you right with God? '. I'm not asking, ' what would Jesus do ', like they are in the movie, but rather, are you personally where you need to be in your life at this moment and time. This movie brings this point across pretty strongly.
I thought the movie as a whole played out really well. I don't know what anyone is talking about when they say it was slow. I'm not getting how they mean slow. Yeh, it's not an action adventure shoot 'em up, get it done, type movie. But, it was good, for what it is.
I enjoyed it, bottom line. Like I said, it made a few strong points throughout the movie.",1498521600,4,1031,4.034146341463415
6788981,2,B00P82BGXA,"Drama, while the director has good intentions its so slow moving and predictable. Either you are Christian or not, obviously this entire congregation consists of babies that know little about our Lord Jesus Christ. They had an opportunity with a visiting Angel, ie the deceased homeless guy. They all failed, the Pastor came close, and he could have saved the day, had he just invited the guy in fed him then talked about options. The same thing with many others, yes its good to look at what Jesus would do. Just looking at the New Testiment ACTS, Romans and such would be a wake up call for all these fake Christians. Its not saying you are something, its being something. God is LOVE, if you want to show your following in his foot steps. Then go out and find someone to help if the opportunity is not present. Volunteer your time doing something for someone in need, spend a few moments sharing your faith. This show is all about baby steps, what you have to go through if you actually start acting like a real Christian. Ok some of you may need this baby food.",1498435200,2,1065,4.466666666666667
6788982,4,B00P82BGXA,"The good:  great message and reminder about not becoming complacent in our lives but about actually living the Christian message about actions being the proof of faith. The not so good:  low budget, poor filming quality, poor casting (many characters looked alike), and generally not awe-inspiring quality.  A small home town film.

This being said, I found many of the characters believable and sincere, as though they truly believed what they were portraying on screen.  I have read the book In His Steps years ago, and I found this to be a modern times, nice nod to the original story.",1497139200,4,588,4.84

6788990,5,B00P82BGXA,"First off let me say this is not a video remake of the book. If it where it would have to be so much more. I love the book and have read and reread it time and again. I read the second book and it just didn't have the power that the first did. I ask myself and God why and the answer came, sacrifice. If your not willing to give, I mean give till you loose something then are you even giving at all. Who so ever shall loose his life for my sake shall find it. I think that's what it takes loosing the life you live for the life he wants you to live. Anything less and your just  playing church and a lukewarm follower.
Now the movie it was quite well made. the acting and  music was entertaining and spiritually engaging. The story was quite insightful and spiritually sound. It provoked one to question ones own walk, which of course it was intended to do so thumbs up. It's not aa  happy ever after movie or a feel good movie. It's a watch listen and grow movie and if your not ready for that then think twice before you play it.",1482796800,3,1031,4.019512195121951

6789021,1,B00P82BGXA,I really wanted to like this.  I love the original book and I like many of the Christian movies made today even if they are not made with lots of money.  But this was really bad.  The acting and sets were more of what you would find in a high school performance.  But the most disappointing was the fact it missed the whole point and beautiful story of the book.,1440633600,,362,4.128571428571429
6789022,3,B00P82BGXA,"In His Steps is about a little town with a prominent Christian populace who've grown apathetic about the sin and despair growing all around them, but specifically one part of town that had become mired down in drinking, gambling and other social ills, called The Rectangle. These Christians got ""comfortable"" socializing with their own, and forgot that part of the command of being a Christian is spreading the Good News and being charitable. The turning point is when a man comes to town in search of work so he can rebuild his life. The written story is a good reminder to us Christians about not becoming complacent and blind to what's going on around us.

As part of our homeschool curriculum my son read the story In His Steps. I wanted to reinforce that study with something visual which seems to work really well with him. So I did a search online to see if there had been any film adaptation of the story; lo and behold, I found this.

You can tell right away that this is a church production and that they've ""modernized"" the story. The acting is a bit over-the-top, the situations are rather unrealistic, but it's a noble attempt to capture the heart of the original story. The sluggish pace and awkward interactions might make you want to shut it off, but it has its moments where they've portrayed the mindsets and struggles well. Even though the theme itself is something we can all benefit from remembering, we were able to make sport of the movie when it really got cheesy and long-winded.

I wouldn't recommend nor dissuade someone from seeing it. I'm not likely to add this to my library. I highly recommend the original written story, though.",1440374400,10,1660,4.658703071672355

8686796,3,B00P82BGXA,"In His Steps is a decent movie with a positive message about faith.  The Church in a small town has become complacent in their faith, they go to worship every week- but don't really live authentically as the Christians they proclaim to be.  When a homeless man comes to town looking for work and is repeatedly turned away and mistreated, he speaks up during church and really asks the congregation what it means to be a Christian.  This interaction sparks the pastor to make some dramatic changes in his life and to make an invitation to the congregation to do the same by making a promise to ask What Jesus Would Do before making life decisions.  We follow the lives of the various characters as they implement these changes.
  I liked that the movie had a positive ending and that many of the characters made real changes.  Ron was my favorite- he was an absolute creep in the beginning, but through inspiration of watching his sister and Rachel deal with various events- he makes a genuine change and starts to live life as a Christian.  It's great that he gets the girl in the end because of his faith and the real changes he made to become an authentic person as opposed to Jasper, who from the start was only showing any interest in church and God to get the attention of Rachel, who is a friend, but obviously did not share his intense feelings.  He was dishonest in his motives and honestly just a big wuss!
  What I didn't like is that the story was somewhat unrealistic.  Turning down a singing career, that she had been wanting her entire life, just because she thought it wasn't what Jesus would do?  That seems a little overboard- why not use the newfound fame to promote worship and sing Christian songs?.  The pastor losing his job due to his new program  and the outright negativity from some of the church elders also seemed a little far fetched.  The movie made a good point and will make you think about yourself and your faith- so it is successful in what the writers intend to accomplish.  I only gave it 3 stars for the somewhat unrealistic nature of the interactions and the slow moving pace early on in the film.  Give it a try, it is free on prime, and wasn't bad for a quiet night.  Family appropriate for most ages.",1531353600,,2242,4.464373464373464
