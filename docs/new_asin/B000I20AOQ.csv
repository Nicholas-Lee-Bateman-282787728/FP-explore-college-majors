8143157,3,B000I20AOQ,My family really enjoys the living scriptures animated series - but it is absolutely INSANE how expensive this products are. I've taken to checking the local DI every once in a while to find the VHS copies for a dollar - and sometimes less.,1363305600,,240,4.4772727272727275

8143160,5,B000I20AOQ,"""Nephi and the Brass Plates"" is just THE FIRST DVD in the Book of Mormon set.
It's an incredible learning tool!  If you buy them from Living Scriptures you must buy the set at a set payment plan, recieving a chosen number of DVD's per month, so being able to buy them a la carte is nice.  I haven't purchased from this vendor, but already knowing the system, the title indicated to me that it was just the first DVD, and the price indicated that too.
They're not cheap, but so worth it!  My 2 and 4 year olds have a familiarity and understanding of the stories in the Book of Mormon that I don't know how else they would have at their ages.  My sybs and I did too, back in the VHS days.
I HIGHLY rec. the series, but don't know anything about this seller.",1309132800,2,755,4.115646258503402
