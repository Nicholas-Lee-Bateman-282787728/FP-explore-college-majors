8466805,5,B005DHBRES,"I'm not a big Joey Menegatti fan, and he narrates between each chapter on this DVD.  That being said, I have done lots of hunting videos (amateur), and I know how hard it is to shoot and make good videos, so I will cut him a little slack...  The videos and hunts were very good, some very unique.  I do wish they would show the scores of the bucks that were harvested using Pope & Young.  I watched some Monster Bucks videos, and they use Boone & Crocket.  I think B & C is more generous with their rating system.  This Muzzy video, and maybe others, does not show any scores.  Overall, very good, and worth the $10 or so I paid for this video.  I just ordered BTTBB 7 DVD for about $8, and I will review that after I watch it.",1387324800,,727,4.034965034965035
