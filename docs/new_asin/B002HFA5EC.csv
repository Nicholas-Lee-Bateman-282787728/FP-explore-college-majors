It really isn't fair to make such a comparison, as for many, that would make this new film fail to deliver, when it is a great, powerful, film in its own right. Yes, both films set out to tell the truth of childhood in their time, but where The 400 Hundred Blows tells you about what could happen and does happen to one child, Moi, Cesar depicts a broader range of the variables of childhood, and is less claustrophobic for doing so. It also has lighter moments that make you remember your own childhood with a wry grin. The central trio of actors are first rate, and Jules Sitruk captures perfectly the awkwardness of growing up the fat kid in school.",1462579200,,776,4.433566433566433

8370267,4,B002HFA5EC,"French film producers are very good at delivering nice coming-of-age films and this one featuring 10 year old boy named Cesar is no exception. It is a great family-tie movie with little taste of road movie and adventure. Richard Berry excellently takes care of the family ties of three main characters Cesar,the protagonist, Sarah, the girl Cesar has a crush on, and Morgan, Cesar's best friend and also a love rival. What's interesting in this movie is the way adults who tried to be nice to Cesar fail vividly showing that children have different viewpoints from adults. When three children decided to search for Morgan's father who presumably live in London, the movie begins to kick off.

Maria de Medeiros well-known Portuguese actress, best known by her role in ""Pulp Fiction"", appears as Cesar's mother. When the film was shot Medeiros  was expecting a baby and she played the role of pregnant mother in the film. Also Anna Karina (Victoria) appears as Gloria who helps three children while in London. Jules Sitruk who played the part of Cesar Peti is best known by Monsieu Batignole. Josephine Berry who played the part of Sarah is Richard Berry's daughter.

Verdict: Nice movie themed in family ties between parents and children.
Rating: 83 out of 100
Note: Could be OK with PG-13 category. Some vulgar language and nudity(such as a scene when Cesar watches his teenage cousins in underwear).",1332460800,,1401,4.927966101694915
