8325880,2,B000X5LFQ0,Subtitles fine for the first 4 disc but terrible from the fifth disc on.  I completely lost interest due to the terrible English translation.,1412985600,,141,4.875
8325881,2,B000X5LFQ0,"English speaking fans of Korean Drama should avoid this edition of Air City.  The English subtitles are fine until after the fourth disc.  After that it turns into incomprehensible gibberish.  I may have to get a copy of the MCB American edition to finish watching the show.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Air-City/dp/B000XULOP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Air City</a>

Air City concetrates on the securty and ground crew of Icheon Airport. It is OK but not as good as the Hong Kong show Triumph In The Sky which focused more on the pilots and staff of a fictious airline.",1239494400,,610,5.670329670329671
8325882,4,B000X5LFQ0,my mother and i really enjoyed this drama.  it had some interesting twists and turns in the story.  something different than your usual korean drama.,1206316800,,149,4.92
8325883,2,B000X5LFQ0,"This is an excellent action series, the characters are very enjoyable. This is of course a love story as well between Section Director Han, and a N.I.S. agent. My only knock against this is that half way though they change translators, and the English subtitles cease to make sense for one episode, then it gets slightly better each episode.",1204848000,,341,4.796610169491525
