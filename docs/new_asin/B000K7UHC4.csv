8154768,2,B000K7UHC4,"These yoga DVDs are terrible. It reminded me of the birthing classes that you may see on some old sitcom. I was hoping for more relaxation and less instruction. (I admit to never watching the full set. I watched part of the first and second DVD.) The instructor gives you different positions to use and gives your coach instruction in how to prevent massage fatigue (use his elbow instead of his hand), but the class is so boring that it is hard to get through. Also, when you are actually in labor, you tell your husband to do what makes you feel better. You don't think to yourself, ""Gee I saw in a video once that rubbing my lower back will help the ache in my back."" Save your money. You can find better, more relaxing videos out there.",1230422400,,740,4.330935251798561
