8238152,5,B0010P5UOU,A+++++++++++++++ I cannot say enough good things about this seller.  Speedy service and a brand new video that was half the price of Amazon.  Who could ask for anything more?  Highly recommended.,1240185600,,195,5.03125
8238153,5,B0010P5UOU,"A lot of times, work with male leads comes out before work with female leads.  ""The Bachelor"" came out before ""The Bachelorette.""  ""Flavor of Love"" came out before ""I Love New York.""  Rick James made albums before the Mary Jane Girls did.  This work is different.  ""Laughing Matters: (The Women)"" was so good that I guess someone said, ""Hey, let's do one with men.""  This is like VH-1's ""The Men Strike Back.""

This work is quite diverse in that it has bears, men of color, and Jewish guys.  In fact, each first joke told usually dealt with the comic's identity outside of his sexuality.  If you watch closely though, some guys get more air time than others.  This differed from ""Laughing Matters: (The Women)"", if I remember correctly.

It takes so much guts to do stand-up.  A whole bunch of folk can sing or model clothes and you can just assume the audience will be receptive.  However, comedy is so subjective.  I can watch a comedy and like it, but still not laugh out loud.  You really how to applaud these entertainers for being so risk-assuming.

There are jokes and this work is mostly feel-good.  However, some of the comics speak of losing loved ones to HIV.  They detail the homophobia they've faced, in funny ways, of course.  This work really touches upon important gay rights matters, and not just yack-yack.

I'm a pessimistic person, by nature and life experience.  I didn't press play thinking this would be great and it turned out to be awesome.  I recommend it to all viewers and wish all the comis the best with their careers.",1221004800,,1548,4.613970588235294
8238154,4,B0010P5UOU,"With a huge selection of DVDs featuring lesbian comedians, it was about time that ""the men"" got a chance.  Gay comics Bruce Vilanch, Alec Mapa, Bob Smith, Scott Kennedy, Andre Kelley and Eddy Sarfaty are captured doing their stand up acts during the 2007 Palm Springs Gay Pride festival.

I hadn't seen Bruce Vilanch's standup routine before, and wasn't surprised it is largely just a series of memoirs from his impressive career as a comedy writer for various stars and shows.  Alec Mapa was his usually bubbly and hysterical self, and Eddy Sarfaty did his usual dead-pan but creative schtick.  I especially enjoyed Andre Kelley's and Scott Kennedy's acts, which largely talked about their non-typically boyhoods, how they dealt with the realization that they were gay, and how their non-stereotypical appearance throws off straight crowds a bit, when they reveal that to them.  Bob Smith is an author of several books as well as one of the more recognizable faces on the gay comic circuit, and he thankfully has some new material here, along with an explanation (on the Extras included on the DVD) that he didn't realize until the playback that he was slurring his words quite a bit.  Sadly, he wasn't drunk; subsequent tests showed it to be a neurological problem, which he is working on with his physician.)

It's tough to rate a collection of stand-up acts, since it obviously doesn't carry the same weight as a single-themed film, or even a one-man show.  Likely you'll love some of them, and think others are just so-so.  Overall, I give this collection four stars out of five.",1209600000,2,1584,4.858736059479554
