Other ""old movie"" DVDs I own are very good.
This DVD is very hard to watch.",1369094400,,105,4.3
8383015,4,B002WG8TZS,"It came on time and had all the movies on the disc except one. The one that I really was ordering these mystery classics in the first place. When I looked to see what movies were on the disc; it stated that ""The Bat"" with Vincent Price was on the disc. But when I received it, it had put 4 episodes of Mr and Mrs North on it instead of three and that knocked out ""The Bat"". Other than that, I guess it is okay. I really was looking forward to watching the movie ""The Bat"". So, it should be updated as to exactly what is on the disc; before someone else orders them expecting to watch ""The Bat"" as I was.

Update:
When I played the first disc, which turned out to be disc 2; it played very well. but, when I put disc one in; it started and froze a couple of times. I wiped it clean and tried it again. The same thing happened with the first movie on disc 1. I  then went to one of the other movies on the disc and the rest played good. Then I went back to the first movie on disc 1 and then it played. So, if your disc does that then try a few things first before giving up. I also raise my rating up one; because once the movies play, they are actually very good. Some of them I had never seen before and I really enjoyed them.",1363996800,3,1227,3.8844621513944224
