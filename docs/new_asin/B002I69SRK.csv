8370747,5,B002I69SRK,"Two years ago I adopted a 1 1/2 year old shelter dog, Charlie (my first dog). He was a timid dog with people and I thought normal socialization techniques would help him overcome his fear of people. Four months into owning Charlie he went from being timid to fearful aggression and began biting people. I took him to positive reinforcement training classes, which did not help. I read Cesar Milan and used his techniques, which helped somewhat, but still the fear aggression was there. After reading a review on Amazon about Kevin Behan's techniques, I stumbled on Neil's DVD and website.

Back in Dec 2010, I purchased Neil's DVD and contacted him for a consultation. Neil was very very helpful in helping me to understand how natural dog training could help Charlie overcome his fear by transferring his focus (and trust) to me, and how this training could help him move forward and move through his fear. Due to winter weather and an injury, I had not been able to practice the feeding/pushing exercises outside until the past week or so, but already I see a difference in him. I have been using the Neil's recommended tug play and ball play since December and just that was helpful in getting him to give me his attention more readily.

I can't say enough about Neil's kind attitude during the consultation. I felt very much at a loss as to what I needed to do for this dog and Neil helped me to understand a great deal.

Also, I got a copy of Turgid Rugaas's ""Calming Signals"" book and DVD. which was also very helpful for me to be able to better read Charlie's body language.

At last I feel I'm on the right track and will not have to return Charlie to the shelter.",1301356800,8,1672,4.508250825082508
8370748,3,B002I69SRK,"This dvd set felt a little homemade to me to begin with. The scenery was pretty but the video felt like a DIY video you would find on YouTube.

Everything from the dvds can be found on his website. As I was listening to it, I felt a wave of deja vu, only to realize- it was verbatim from the blog! I've heard it all before! So I felt pretty gypped having spent $60 on it.

As far as the content... don't be misled. This is about basic training and getting your dog to focus his attention on you. It is not for highly energetic, aggressive dogs who have trouble socializing (i.e.- my dog). The entire first dvd is about what he calls ""Pushing"". In theory, it's a great idea. The reason the dog lunges at other dogs is because he has excess energy and doesn't know what to do with it. Understandably, the response is to redirect his attention by getting him to focus on you. But the same can be done by running in the opposition direction, distracting him with a toy or (as Victoria Stilwell recommends)- throwing a fit and falling on the ground (absolutely works, by the way! My Great Dane was once completely intent on lunging for another dog, I made a ridiculously high pitched silly sound and collapsed onto the grass. He totally ignored the dog because, in that moment, I was 1,000 times more fun than that Golden Retriever! He ran over, tail wagging, as if to say ""What the hell's going on here?? I wanna play too!"")

Like I said, my high strung (aka aggressive) dog is a handful and we've tried everything training him- some worked, some didn't. I'm writing this one off as a ""didn't work"", but could have if he was a near-perfect dog to begin with.

The most efficient way, for us, has been the Victoria Stilwell Positively approach. For example, when approaching a stranger (child/bike/dog/lizard on a leash), I pay close attention to his body language. If he starts to tense up, we turn around and walk the other way. I make him sit and don't say a word, just let him get bored. Wait for that moment when he breaks focus (you can recognize it when he looks away from the object, looks at you, etc.) and try walking by them again. The minute he gets tense, oops, we turn back around (no yelling- just a simple, happy, ""Ah Ah, Try again buddy!"". I don't care if it takes 12 times, eventually he gets the idea that he cannot meet and greet until he's calm and well mannered.

I truly hope this method works for others- it just didn't work for us.",1288828800,22,2451,4.366228070175438
8370749,2,B002I69SRK,"These are NO new techniques, the ""pushing"" is a waste of time, these are Positive Reinforcement(+R)techniques, but guess what?, these take a lot longer than the so know +R avialable in any +R based book. I spend a lot of money in this DVD becase I brought it to mexico, and it was a shame, I feel so dissapointed.

In the description of this DVD says:

""The DVDs cover introductory techniques as well as address more challenging situations like dog aggression, anxiety, fearfulness, and hyperactivity. You will learn how to honor the true inner workings of their dog's nature in the process of training, which makes it easy to channel your dog's energy into the behaviors that you want.""

Well, that's a LIE, non of the two DVDs says -anything- about agression, anxiety, fearfulness and hyperactivity. As any +R only based book or DVD, they teach you how to train with food, and they claims that any problem your dog has, will be fixed with food, that's a big LIE, in most cases the problems gets worse, traying to give your dog a cookie when he wants to kill other dog it's insane, and for the dog eyes, you seem so weak, so he doesn't need to respect you, why?, just because he is controling the situation and you are just his cook, that's why.

Any +R only book or trainer teach you how to sit a dog with food, but..., do they tell you what to do when your dog decide to ignore you?, well that's exactly what you will get when you buy this DVD, you will spend 30 minutes watching how to feed your dog with your hand (pushing), and then the same +R techniques you can find for way less money.

But don't get me wrong, I train with food and some times even with clicker, but only to teach new behaviors, but... your dog needs to know what happend when he decides not to obey, because outdoors if he decides to obey, that's going to save his life. As humans we learn that way, we need to know what happend if we obey, and what happend if we doesn't, and then we make our decitions, it is exactly the same with dogs.

I'm not saying you have to beat your dog, NO WAY, I don't do it, you don't need to, you don't need any choke collar also, just the rigth atitude, and know how to physically sit him if he decides not to sit, that's all. The same, for the recalls, the same for stop barking, etc.

I'm giving him 2 stars because the DVD, is well made, well printed, good music, great shots, everyting else is not very good.

Pros: He teach you how to play with your dog, many people doesn't know how to do it, and it is very important for the bond with your dog. For new behaviors or new trainers, some of these techniques are good.

Cons: Pushing is a waste of time, give food with your hand on a chair, it's the same. The DVD shows only a controlled enviroment, you don't know what you have to do in real life situations, and with a high energy dog, it's dangerous if you don't know how to control him using these techniques.",1288137600,12,2925,4.274864376130199
8370750,5,B002I69SRK,"This is an excellent video tutorial on the techniques pioneered and described by Kevin Behan in his book Natural Dog Training.  I struggled with my aggressive dog for a long time, using both dominance techniques as well as positive reinforcement techniques, neither of which had an effect on her.  Well, the dominance stuff did have an effect on her, though it was all negative.  It wasn't until I found Natural Dog Training that I began to see positive results as my dog started becoming calmer and more relaxed in all situations.

If you're interested in the Natural Dog Training techniques, this DVD set is a must have.  Neil does a great job of explaining the basics of the philosophy, methodology and techniques of NDT in a simple, easy to understand manner.  Whether you're looking to develop a better relationship with your dog, working on some basic obedience work, or wanting to help your dog with behavior issues, this is the DVD for you.  This DVD in combination with Kevin Behan's book Natural Dog Training will change the way you see your dog, and the relationship you have with him or her.  All for the better.",1262476800,13,1124,4.728205128205128
8370751,5,B002I69SRK,"As a person that's BIG on researching before he buys, I did my homework when it comes to choosing a dog-training methodology and eventually settled on the Natural Dog Training method by Kevin Behan. This book opened my eyes to a whole new perspective of seeing the world from the dog's eyes and away from the junk-tv style Cesar Milan philosophy. While the book is invaluable, I thought it would be very helpful to be able to actually see the methods in action. This is where Neil Sattin's Natural Dog Training DVDs come in, and having just received them a week ago I have to say that he perfectly demonstrates Kevin Behan's techniques and most definitely helped clarify the visual images I had in my head as I was reading the book. Neil takes you through the lessons step-by-step as he coaches you through simple techniques that anyone can do.

If you are looking for a dog-training philosophy that not only works but is very natural, healthy, stimulating and fun for your dog, look no further than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Natural-Dog-Training/dp/0578013630/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Natural Dog Training</a>&nbsp;as well as Neil's Natural Dog Training DVDs.

p.s. I don't normally write reviews, but as a dog lover I know how confusing it can be when there's so many different competing training methodologies out there. If you're reading this then it's most likely because you're shopping around for training information and you're still trying to make up your mind. For those of you that are serious about your training and interested in an additional resource, I would also recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schutzhund-Theory-and-Training-Methods-Howell-reference-books/dp/0876057318/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schutzhund: Theory and Training Methods (Howell reference books)</a>. Even though I am not sure yet whether I will one day enter my dog into an official Schutzhund event for either certification or competition (though I am considering it), the methods they use are a perfect compliment when using the Natural Dog Training techniques. Just going through the exercises demonstrated in Neil's DVD and the Schtuzhund book is fun for both you and your dog. Who knows, if your dog gets really good at them one day then they can get certified or even compete! Good luck to all of you in your training!

p.p.s. Neil, if I ever come to Maine (I live in NYC) I would love to meet you and your dog! Excellent work on the DVDs! :)",1261094400,13,2623,5.434889434889435
