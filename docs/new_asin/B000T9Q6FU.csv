2895196,5,B000T9Q6FU,Awesome! LOVE IT!  Great workouts.  Many to choose from.  And many different levels of intensity.  Billy keeps you motivated.  Great way to have fun while you get fit.  Fast paced and upbeat helps the time go by fast while you challenge yourself.,1297728000,,246,4.738095238095238
2895197,5,B000T9Q6FU,"love it, i like being able to rotate dvds so i don't have to do the same one
over and over, lots of moves",1237680000,,105,3.4166666666666665
2895198,4,B000T9Q6FU,"These workouts are different from Billy's other series.  To me, they focus mainly on the upper body.  Each workout (except for the Live in LA) has half of the class using the 3 pound Amplifier and the other half of the class without the Amplifier.  The warm-up and cool-down sections of each workout are very short and each workout has you using the Amplifier the entire time (except for a 3 minute break in Jump Start Cardio where Billy has you put the Amplifier down).
If you like to kick, and you're looking for a lower-body workout, this set is not for you---there is very little kicking in any of the 5 workouts.
I do not recommend buying this set without the Amplifier---the workout will be awkward and ineffective.
Billy leads you through the moves at a slow pace (usually 4-5 sets of 8) then ""amps it up"" with anywhere from 4-8 sets of 8.  The ""amped"" pace is extremely fast and I found some of the exercises to be a little jerky at the faster pace.
For anyone looking for a total-body workout, I recommend TaeBo Cardio, TaeBo Flex, or the Elite series.  These are a great change of pace when you are wanting to focus on the upper body.",1200700800,17,1144,4.402843601895735

2895202,5,B000T9Q6FU,I have some of the early Tae Bo tapes and decided to give these a try. Was very happy I did. Billy Blanks is a much improved instructor from his earlier tapes. He is much better at cueing and more consistent with his reps. I was very pleasantly surprised and the price was great.,1411689600,2,279,4.185185185185185
2895203,5,B000T9Q6FU,Out of word. It's excellent love it,1408406400,,35,4.142857142857143

2895205,1,B000T9Q6FU,"The actual workouts looked great on reviews that I watched, but I just got out my Jump Start DVD and it was actually cracked!!!!!! That sucks. I am not happy!",1373846400,,158,4.3
2895206,5,B000T9Q6FU,I've always loved Tae Bo and has always got me fit fast and had fun and felt great. I have enjoyed all of this set of work outs as well. I definitely recommend it to anyone willing to challenge yourself.,1370390400,3,203,4.1
2895207,5,B000T9Q6FU,I love Billy Blank and this is an amazing video workout . I lost 3 pounds in a week and I'm feeling great doing this workout I'm so happy. Love you Billy Blank,1366675200,,159,3.8484848484848486
2895208,3,B000T9Q6FU,"I purchased the set as a way to work out at home and avoid going to the gym.  My experience with Tae Bo was limited, I'll admit, but I have attended many fitness classes and have a feel for what they should include.  Billy's fitness video was like watching a work out class...and like a work out class I only did it a few times.  The Amped Bar that was included as a bonus was a joke and doesn't stay together.  Additionally, the videos are all different lengths and the ""workout plan"" that comes with the videos was disappointing at best.  I won't be wasting my money on Billy again.",1322179200,3,584,4.2727272727272725
2895209,5,B000T9Q6FU,All good.  Billy Blanks workouts are what you make of them and he try to encourage you as you go.  You have to do the work.  It won't work unless you do it.  Simple as that.,1314835200,,173,3.7222222222222223
8208278,5,B000T9Q6FU,"Got this set when it first came out and it sparked my now obsession with at home workout DVDs and my love of Tae Bo! Have rediscovered this set after many years and at age 50 I love the way it Challenges me but without the craziness of Insanity or the sheer boredom of P90X.I also use the amplifying bar for other workout DVDs and the only thing I don't like is that my bar won't stay in the lock position so sometimes have to fix it during the workout. There are also a few excercises here and there that they speed up too fast,making me feel clumsy and uncoordinated. Also,a few excercises Billy forgets to repeat on the opposite side. On the whole,I highly recommend these workouts and actually look forward to them,other then other DVDs in my extensive collection that I just dread. When I use these DVDs I feel empowered and joyful!!My only complaint really is I get tired of hearing him yell Get Amped and his daughter Shelly gets annoying the way she screams.",1512345600,,966,4.432584269662922
8208279,4,B000T9Q6FU,It was a very good workout.,1502064000,,27,3.6666666666666665
8208280,4,B000T9Q6FU,"I love Billy Blanks Taebo workouts but at age 54, I could do without the kids screaming WOOO! and YEAH!!! GET AMPED!!!. But still it's a great workout, but maybe next time with the sound turned down. ",1499644800,,200,4.405405405405405
8208281,3,B000T9Q6FU,"I bought this used on Amazon for a really low price.  Most of the workouts are pretty good and worth doing.  What you can't tell from the cover of the dvd is that Billy is busy selling his equipment (as usual).  The workouts are done with an ""amped bar.""  What a joke!  Just use two dumbbells - they'll work better, and you can adjust the weight as needed with larger or smaller dumbbells.  I got tired of further commercialization when after most routines Shelley (the skinny blonde one) screams out ""Get Amped!.""  Really.  Still, for the price this was a decent addition to my dvd collection.",1492646400,,594,4.537735849056604
