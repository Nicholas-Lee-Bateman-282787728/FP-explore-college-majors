8296112,5,B001E1Z6DU,I saw this a few years ago on HBO. It's very well done. I wish I would've seen it as a teenager because I probably would have enlisted. Every military recruiter should watch this and learn from the best. I also like how it follows the lives of the new recruits and their families. Very moving.,1297468800,3,293,4.25
