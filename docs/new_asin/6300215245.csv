253125,5,6300215245,"Just for the record, this is a video recording of the performance of January 16, 1982 at the Met, which features Teresa Stratas as Mimi, Jose Carreras as Rodolfo, Renata Scotto as Musetta, Richard Stilwell as  Marcello, James Morris as Colline, Alan Monk as Schaunard, Italo Tajo as  Benoit and Alcindoro, and Dale Caldwell as Parpignol. James Levine  conducts.
The performance as a whole is very enjoyable; the two  principals look very credible on stage, and their voices blend  successfully.  Scotto does not overdo the coquettish nature of her role.  All 4 Acts are well paced, sung, and presented.  The costumes are  distinguished, and Franco Zeffirelli attends to minor details in the  production - as discussed in the excellent 20 minute interview which  follows the opera - that often get overlooked. The sound quality for this  medium is excellent.  The total playing time is 141 minutes.  At medium  price, less than many CD recordings, this can be recommended with  enthusiasm.",955152000,7,988,5.08125
253126,5,6300215245,"This is an absolute opera to have...i have the laser disc version and i have been watching it numerous times since I bought it in 1993.  At least few times a month and now plan to buy the DVD.  Stratas and Carreras and  Scotto were in perfect form...Stratas interpretation of Mimi in my opinion  is amongst the top Mimi on CD and DVD.  Her aria melts my heart everytime  and Carreras sensitive Rodolfo....so caring and so extraordinarily sung.  I  am now speechless, this video is definitely one of the BEST opera on  screen.",945129600,12,525,4.559139784946237
253127,5,6300215245,"Zeffirelli has struck again with a wonderful version of La Boheme.  Beautiful voices are sharply contrasted with the tragic storyline.  Zeffirelli's magic rules costumes and sets, creating an unbelieveable  experience.  Lovers and non-lovers of opera can appreciate this one!",944179200,10,275,5.9743589743589745
253128,4,6300215245,"Not having seen the VHS version, I can't say if it's the DVD transfer that is at fault. But of the two camera angles used, the main one shot from the rear is the only one that to me, exhibits this motion phenomena.  Whereas,  from the other camera angle, shots of the conductor and orchestra pit  appear just fine. Maybe the low light and distance to the stage have  something to do with it? Overall a wonderful production.",943833600,2,423,4.384615384615385
253129,4,6300215245,Carreras is at his vocal best and Stratas as usual does a great job of acting and an adequate job of singing.,917568000,3,109,4.0
253200,5,6300215245,"I'm relatively new to opera, but still an ardent Carreras-fan who thinks his singing is heavenly and I think he makes a more than convincing Rodolfo here. And his looks at the time is certainly no drawback for him. His acting skills are in my opinion very good; his facial expressions projecting his feelings perfectly. (I prefer a subtle actor instead of someone overacting to compensate for poor voice.)It's heartbreaking watching and listening to him singing in the final scene where Mimi is dying. I can't help but being almost as crushed as him when he realizes that she's actually dead.

Since I'm not an ""educated"" opera-listener I can't say it bothered me that he had transposed down ""che gelida manina"". His singing in act III is outstanding; the break-up between Mimi and Rodolfo is heart wrenching. I can feel Rodolfo's despair because he knows Mimi is dying. One of the things that bothered me somewhat in this Boheme is actually Mimi. Teresa Stratas' voice is not something I would call beautiful, by no means. And it disturbed me that she was rotating her tongue in her mouth whenever singing. But apart from that she's actually a sweet Mimi. In my opinion she's a much better actress than singer. And she certainly lookes ill enough for this part. In act IV the duet (O Mimi, tu piu non torni) between Rodolfo and Marcello is outstanding. The duets between Mimi and Rodolfo are also very moving.

Renata Scotto was probably the biggest disappointment. I haven't seen her on stage before. To me she seems affected and I think she is just too much; especially in the second act. Her singing is not what I expected. She sounds shrill and squeaky, although I have to admit she sounds better towards the end of the opera.

Richard Stilwell as Marcello is a gem. His singing as well as his acting is superb and he makes a very amiable painter. He is someone you would like being your friend. The two other Bohemians portrayed by Allan Monk and James Morris are superb. The ""coat song"" is beautifully sung by James Morris.

I have watched this film a few times and each time I discover something new. I have to say I love just watching the facial expressions of the singers, especially the four bohemians'. Sometimes you just get a brief glimpse of it, but it's still hilarious. (Like the look on Carreras' face when the land-owner Benoit knocks on the door in the first act.) I'm sure I will discover a lot of other things about this Boheme the next time I watch it, which probably will be very soon. The more I watch, the more addicted to it I get.

So my overall feeling here must be that this Boheme has a very good male cast, but the same thing can't be said about the sopranos. Where were Katia Ricciarelli and Agnes Baltsa at that time? Imagine them as Mimi and Musetta, respectively. Well, one can always dream......

Still, I give this Boheme 5 stars. Earned by Jos Carreras and James Stilwell, mainly. And I can easily put up with the flaws of this Boheme just to be able to watch and listen to Carreras singing the part of Rodolfo.",1126569600,6,3050,4.56672760511883
253201,5,6300215245,"I've listened to this opera for years, but only seen it twice, both this production, first on VHS, now on DVD.  Stratas was perfection as always, with her beautiful voice, and her acting, not that it matters that much, was touching too.  The first time I saw this I cried.  Carreras and Scotto also were wonderful, especially Scotto with her acting (as well as her voice).  I felt that the other singers were adequate, they did good jobs, but were not in a class with the three I already mentioned.  I do not like James Levine, I wish he'd stick to Wagner, they were meant for each other.  The sets were colorful and beautiful.  I read somewhere that this is considered the most loveable of all Italian operas.  I can well believe it, especially with this production.",1105228800,3,767,4.547445255474453
253202,4,6300215245,"I was so excited to watch this opera years ago. It was the first one I had ever seen, and had only heard highlights on a CD (with Pavarotti as Rodolfo). I was overwhelmed at first, because there is so much emotion in this opera: Act 1 is charming, Act 2 is exciting, Act 3 is depressing, and Act 4 is crushing...
Probably my favorite part of this production is Act 2, in which there is an elaborate 2-story set (characteristic of Zefirelli), a gigantic crowd, and Musetta is brought in by horse and carriage (which I missed the first two times I watched it... see, lots of detail). The costumes were great, Mimi's make-up was too extreme in Acts 1 and 2, and I was absolutely pissed when I discovered that Carerras had transposed ""Che gelida manina""!!! I had always thought Carerras was terrible, but this performance was the straw that broke the camel's back. I loved the snow in Act 3!!!
I highly reccommend it as a grand introduction to opera and it's staging, but must insist that you purchase the Angela Georghiu and Roberto Alagna CD version of this opera. The music is absoltely perfect!",1079740800,8,1094,4.53030303030303
253203,3,6300215245,"It puzzles me that words like ""standard"" or ""bench mark"" were used in praise of this La Boh'me. Just exactly what is the ""standard"" for this probably most popular opera? The originality of art is anything but to be constrained by some sort of standard. If the good words were for the singing, it still would be too lavish of a saying for this production, at least for ""Che gelida manina"", which was transposed down half a key, and even the replacing B is very short and not so exciting. There are indeed some really good singings, like Stilwell's Mercello. The singing of the two leading roles, however, leaves something to be desired. While Carreras' singing is quite dramatic, it feels that something was missing, not just the top C, but the lyrical sheen and exuberance that otherwise would flow through Rodolfo's vocal lines. Stratas has crafted a convincingly consumptive Mimi. But you'd hope she could bring a bit glow of liveliness to the character in the first two acts when Mimi was not yet too ill, after all Mimi should be a luminous figure. Stratas' lips are shaking noticeably (on DVD) when she sings, which makes you worry. Scotto played an impressive Musetta, and her great acting brought some enjoyable moments on stage.

It is very interesting to compare this Zeffirelli's traditional and lavish production with other productions. Although it'll much depend on your taste to decide their effectiveness, among the numerous recordings and stage productions of La Boh'me, you wouldn't want to miss the 1972 studio recording with Pavarotti/Freni, conducted by Karajan, especially if singing is solely what you are looking for. If besides singing, you also want to experience some vigorous Bohemianism on stage and dramatic details revealed by great acting, you definitely want to check out Baz Luhrmann's production for Australian Opera, in which the sets are simple but visually stunning, the characters are sung by new generation singing actors/actresses in fabulous voices.",1057795200,17,1989,5.08256880733945
253204,4,6300215245,"I have all the Bohemes availabe on VHS and Laser and still come back to this one to show anyone new to opera as it's the best video available.  The version spoken of from the UK I have only been able to find on VHS and it is truly excellent.  Not seen it on DVD but would buy it the minute it is released.  Until then this production and cast can't be beat. Scotto is getting by on her acting ability, not her voice as Musetta.  That high note is not unlike a cat getting its tail trod upon.  I agree with all the comments about Stratas and enjoyed Carreras' performance very much.  James Morris as Colline is a surprise.  If you collect opera on video this is a must buy.  The production is glorious and the overall atmosphere created is the standard for Boheme.",1056672000,4,763,4.213793103448276
253205,3,6300215245,"There are two problems with this DVD that buyers,(especially singers)should know.
Number one, subtitles, or more accurately, the lack thereof.  The only subtitles available are in English and they cannot be turned off.
Number two, I agree with other reviewers that Carreras does a marvelous job of acting and of singing.  But on this DVD, one thing he does not have that Pavaratti most certainly would is a high C!  Che Gelida Manina is marked down a half-step and only goes to a B natural.
I realize these things might not matter to the casual viewer, but as an opera singer I bought the DVD not only to watch but to learn as well.  In order to do this I would have certainly appreciated subtitles available in the original Italian as well as all the music sung in the original key!",1049760000,13,783,4.531914893617022
253206,5,6300215245,"I am in disbelief that sommeone rated carreras badly in this la boheme!  Any of you who are used to the Carreras of the three tenors, will be  extremely surprized.  He sings with vivacity and dramatic timbre.  As for his vocals being suspect; 1982 was riddled with Carreras's wobbly performances.  This is the season following his taking on Trovatore, a much heavier role which took a toll on his voice. His singing here is, however, spectacular.  Che Gelida manina is transposed a half step down,  but this iis not unusual.  Domingo has always done it and Pavarotti does it on occasion as well.  Pavarotti mentions in his autobiography that the transposition down is standard.
As for a comparison between pav and Carreras; there is no comparision.  The unconvincing acting of pavarotti can ruin a boheme on a Dvd with such focus.  Carreras is triumphant and portays his character brilliantly.  It is true, however that after 1981's romp through heroic tenor reperitiore Carreras was never the same.  His eyebrow began to warble and his high notes were no longer as free and glorious.  Nevertheless this Dvd is magnifisant.
Even  if Carreras's dramatic timber isn't your cup of tea, he is supported by the fabulous voice of Stratas.  Occasionally her facial expressions bother you but the voice is in glorious condition.
SEE THIS DVD,  It is entertainment at it's finest!",1047859200,13,1371,4.942982456140351
253207,2,6300215245,"I agree that Zeffirelli's production and voices of leading roles are wonderful.  However, I believe that La Boheme is the story about young women and men - who have no money but a lot of energy to find a small joy every day and enjoy their life.  Unfotunately, this DVD tells a sad story only, and I was not able to find any youth and sense of humor, which should be prominetly existent in every great La Boheme.",1043971200,6,412,4.269230769230769
253208,4,6300215245,"This is a great La Boheme. However, the soprano that sings Mimi is a *not so good soprano* (if you will) Stratas, (the soprano that sings Mimi) shakes her tounge and jaw which means that she is using a poor vocal tequnie. (sorry, I cant spell!) That is the reason that I took off one star, cause of Stratas.
But, on the other hand, Scotto's ""Quadro men vo"" is one of the cutest I have ever seen. And  in this video, Carreras is a hottie! (hey hey, I am a teenager, what can I say?)",1010016000,5,481,4.063157894736842
253209,5,6300215245,"stupendous,awesome,and spectacular are only a few adjectives i can think of to describe this performance of La Boheme. the sets are fantastic,the acting and singing i feel were superb.the only dissapointment i had was that the ending was not as profound as the covent garden production with Neil Shicoff as Rodolfo. however in lieu of this minor dissapointment,i feel this dvd is definitely a must have.",1009670400,3,403,5.121212121212121
253251,4,6300215245,"I thoroughly enjoyed this 1982 Zeffirelli production from the Met. It has much to recommend it: passionate singing from the underrated Jose Carreras, terrific acting from Teresa Stratas, an excellent supporting cast, great sets and direction, and first-rate conducting from James Levine.

I bought this DVD primarily because of Carreras, and it's a treat to hear him before the onset of his illness and vocal problems. True, he is pushing a little here at times, but his ravishing timbre more than compensates. Pavarotti may have the freer high notes, but Carreras' performance has a passion that most other interpreters lack. By his own admission not the world's greatest actor, he is nevertheless convincing as a young, idealistic poet, and this (along with Stiffelio, Don Jose and Andrea Chenier) ranks as one of his best roles. My only quibble is that he is a little hammy during Mimi's death scene (though few tenors can probably resist such a temptation!)

Teresa Statas is the consummate actress, and there is not one moment when her portrayal of Mimi does not ring entirely true. I was unable to hold back the tears during her aria in Act Three, so heartbreaking was her farewell to Rodolfo. Interestingly, she makes her impression without the benefit of a magnificent voice. This is a singing actress rather than a vocal great. Her voice strikes me as somewhat plain of timbre, lacking the beauty of, say, a Mirella Freni, but in this performance, at least, it simply doesn't matter. Her Mimi will stay with you for a long time. (I do, however, agree with one amazon reviewer who thought she looked too ill from the outset. The over-zealous make-up artist should have shown some restraint!)

Renata Scotto, in the role of Musetta, has a larger vocal presence, despite a wobbly vibrato when she's under pressure. Hers is a good overall performance, and her comic skills in Act Two add much to the liveliness of the Cafe Scene.

The rest of the cast was uniformly good, and the amusing horseplay between the four young Bohemians in Acts 1 and 4 was a real delight. Richard Stilwell as Marcello is outstanding in the reconciliation scene with Musetta in Act 2, and later in his duet (O Mimi, piu non torni) in Act 4 with Carreras.

The sound quality is fine, and I had no problem with the slightly dark (but highly atmospheric) visuals.

Overall, an excellent Boheme with much to recommend it. (And while you're about it, do check out the 1982 Covent Garden performance with Neil Shicoff and Ileana Cotrubas for an equally well-acted Boheme.)",1005264000,49,2548,4.845977011494253
253252,5,6300215245,"Having witnessed several versions of this beautiful, heartbreaking opera, no one, but no one comes close to the exquisite performance of Teresa Stratas as Mimi. Her voice is thrilling, her acting is superb...she IS Mimi! Jose Carrares is magnificent as her Rudolfo. Not only a perfect visual match, their voices also compliment one another as the viewer is swept away into a bohemian world of 19th century Paris. The only disappointment in this production is the voice of Renata Scotto who portrays Musetta. A fabulous actress, but her stage performance is sometimes overshadowed by a darker, wobbling voice that no longer produces the ease and beauty that used to thrill opera lovers. Still, her acting is believeable which makes her vocal failings forgiveable as she throws everything she has into bringing her character to life...and does she ever! Ah, but her counterpart, Richard Stilwell as Marcello, is top notch, as is the remaining cast. Directed by Franco Zeffirelli (who really knows his stuff!), he turns what could have been stiff singing manequins into convincing, feeling characters. His choice of costumes are not only authentic to the period, but reveal the hard times of these young bohemians.  Also bringing reality to his brilliant and beautiful stage designs, he even showers the performers with falling snow in the third act. Finally, James Levine as Conductor...the opera king himself!  This ""La Boheme,"" performed live at the Metropolitan Opera on January 16, 1982, is a dazzling production of near perfection.  It would be a shame to pass this one up.",996105600,5,1576,5.1484375
253253,3,6300215245,"As far as performances in large opera houses of La Boheme go this must surely be up there with the best, however, I can't get past the fact that something just doesn't click in this performance for me.  All of the singers sing well and act well, Miss Stratas in particular, but there seems to be no real relationships built up during the course of the opera, so that in the final scene the only thing that made me cry was the emotional soaring of Puccini's music, not that Rodolfo had finally lost his beloved Mimi.  Now if you can find the Covent Garden performance directed by John Copley with Ileana Cotrubas and Neil Shicoff you get the full deal; the music, the singing and the relationships...and a truly believable and outstandingly sung Marcello in Sir Thomas Allen.",992131200,3,774,4.601449275362318
253254,3,6300215245,"While I agree with most of what other reviewers say about this DVD, I have to disagree with both Amazon's editorial review on one point - about this being ""the best visual treatment of this opera that anyone's ever likely to see."" I highly doubt that: Not only is the lighting very dark throughout and the picture not widescreen, one would think that, for a DVD, the producers would film without an audience as has been done for several other opera DVDs in my collection.
Aside from the so-so presentation, the music is wonderful and the performances are excellent. I just wish the audience wasn't clapping over all my favorite parts.",984441600,6,634,4.7207207207207205
253255,3,6300215245,"I love the aria Che Gelida Manina, and Carreras gave the worst performance of this aria that I have ever heard (most notable in its transposition down from the high C).

253257,5,6300215245,"This version of La Boheme has never been available in England, at least I  have never been able to track down a copy.  I actually bought the DVD  directly from the Met opera shop, ask for Jack and he will give you all the  advice you need, although I should warn you that it is much cheaper to buy  it from amazon.com.  Even more so if you live in Europe, because the  shipping is much less from amazon. I have always loved San Francisco's  Boheme, probably because I am obsessed with Pavarotti and Freni, and I do  believe that this is the most beautifully sung Boheme available on DVD.  However, if you are after an emotive and perfectly executed Boheme in which  the performers and production get right under the skin, of what can be very  ""card board cut out characters"", then look no further than this  Met production.  Teresa Stratus has by no stretch of the imagination a  beautiful voice, but her acting and total commitment and understanding of  the role of Mimi counteract this.  She delivers her line at the end of her  Act I aria "" Altro dime non le saprei narrare."" absolutely  perfectly.  I have never seen anyone equal it; and her intense portrayal of  Mimi is full of moments like this.  Hers is a truly wonderful performance  and interpretation.  As is Carreras' Rodolfo.  I have always considered  Carreras to be the better actor of the three tenors, and although he can't  match their vocal splendour, he here gives the performance of a life time.  Mind you, try and get a copy of a VHS of him at La Scala in La Forza del  Destino - and you will see it again.  The rest of the cast, with the  exception of Scotto's Musetta, pale into insignificance against these two -  my only major critisism is ""why does James Morris look so absurd as  Colline""?  The production by Zeffirelli is excellent.  So in  conclusion, if you want exemplary singing throughout - then go for San  Francisco's production with Pavarotti.  If you want a Boheme from the  heart, then the Met production is for you.  In an ideal world, have both!",965952000,52,2036,4.5013774104683195
