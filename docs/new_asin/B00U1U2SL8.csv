7027415,5,B00U1U2SL8,"This is an excellent documentary on the entire career of Merrill Ashley, one of the great American ballerinas. While focusing especially on her retirement from the stage, it also deals with her current teaching career and her rise in the ballet world from her earliest days in ballet class. Still photos and video clips from all stages in her career are shown along with the documentary footage that was shot from 1998 to 2010. There are also numerous interviews with those in the ballet world who worked with her and know her. The overall format and editing are excellent and should appeal to every balletomane. The only drawback is that this is entirely in the older aspect ratio of 4:3, so you get black bands on each side of the image. There are some special features consisting of a behind-the-scenes photo gallery, which is quite nice, and some biographies of Merrill Ashley and the producers(in print boards, not video). This should appeal to the serious ballet student, dancer, or enthusiast.",1435795200,13,1000,4.8882352941176475

8703897,1,B00U1U2SL8,"My wife is a ballet dancer and knew all about Merrill Ashley's hip replacement and other health problems brought on by years of the hard physical work required of a professional dancer. We were both also interested in this video because we saw her dance many times in the 1970s and 1980s. We also own the complete ""Video Dictionary of Ballet"" which features her instruction and demonstration on many of the classical ballet elements.

So why did we dislike this video so much? For the simple reason that the woman is a simpering mess of self-pity, anger, and ego, and that distasteful combination permeates every second of the entire video. You may think my assessment is rather harsh, given that the woman has obviously had to suffer through a lot of physical trauma. However, I am exactly the same age as she is, and while I was never a professional athlete (which is an accurate description of a dancer of her stature), I can tell you this: growing old is not for sissies. Yes, that's an old joke, but it is unfortunately very true. The fact is, I know dozens of people our age who have health problems far more profound and painful than those she has had to endure. What's more, they never got to enjoy all the perks associated with her difficult, but very rewarding years in the spotlight.

I am certainly sorry that she can no longer dance the way she hoped she might in her later years, but except for Alicia Alonso, very few dancers do much past their late 30s, the same as other professional athletes.

If you want to read a great story about a ballerina who suffered far more than Ashley, and did so for her entire career, read about Alonso who was legally blind from the beginning of her career (in her teens). Now THAT was someone who knew how to handle physical handicaps with grace and aplomb.",1493424000,2,1807,4.53680981595092

8703899,5,B00U1U2SL8,"Loved this biography of a beautiful dancer.  I could really identify with her abject loss at retirement.  I suffered as acutely even though I was nowhere near the dancer she was.  Dance is in the soul, and to have age and infirmity separate you from your soul is very painful.  Loved seeing excerpts of her performances, and glad she found teaching and coaching to be something she could become interested in.",1484092800,,409,4.71830985915493

8703902,5,B00U1U2SL8,"Love ballet, but when Ms. Ashley was dancing I was not a total ballet freak, so I was unaware of her NYC career. This documentary enlightens the viewer on the joy and pain associated with becoming a classical dancer.",1448755200,,216,4.564102564102564
8703903,5,B00U1U2SL8,"This exciting and energetic ballerina  is also known to be articulate which makes her
presentation of this documentary interesting, enlightening and entertaining.  For lovers
of the Balanchine contribution to ballet this DVD is a must-have.  For anyone else it
is a sobering reminder to active dancers of the body's limitations and the brevity of any
profession involving  physical activity.  Highly recommended as  one of the few revelations
of the basic realities everyone faces in this field.",1448064000,4,495,5.447368421052632
8703904,5,B00U1U2SL8,"Having grown up at the time Ms. Ashley was up and coming in the NYC Ballet, I found this very enjoyable.  It is in some ways the sad tale of most highly placed ballerinas, showing the rise to stardom, the injuries and recoveries and what they do when they can no longer perform.  This has the added view of a ""Balanchine"" dancer.  Recommend to anyone who wants to get the real picture of the ballet world.",1446595200,6,405,4.302631578947368
8703905,5,B00U1U2SL8,Love Merrill Ashley!  This is a wonderful look into the life of a ballerina.  Merrill Ashley is eloquent and honest.  One of the most beautiful dancers ever.  A must for anyone who wants to make ballet a profession.  A fabulous video!,1444089600,,234,4.609756097560975
