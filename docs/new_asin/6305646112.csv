1056906,5,6305646112,"This has got to be one of the best ""DBZ"" videos I've seen so far. When I was watching this video, I kind of really felt for Vegeta (and this is a cartoon).  One thing I like is to see some sad parts on shows  that usually have a lot of action in them. I also like when some parts from  the past are shown because it's easier to get into the overall story.  ""Xena:Warrior Princess"", ""X-Men"", and  ""Gargoyles"" are other examples ofthose type of shows. This  ""DBZ""video is a must have. The only question I have is, 'Where  exactly was Radditz when Frieza destroyed the saiya-jins in the past?'One  more thing: When I first started to watch ""DBZ"", I used to get  pretty frustrated with the show (even though I still liked it) because it  seemed like they wasted too much time and it took too long to get things  over with but, I've gotten used to it. Now, I consider ""DBZ"" one  of my favorite cartoons.",939340800,,898,4.279761904761905
1057150,5,6305646112,"I don't usually cry but this made me tear up a little. Waa how sad. Vegeta is the best character and really cool. He shouldn't die. Freeza should die. Oh wait, he does. Oh yeah...",973900800,,179,4.142857142857143
1057151,5,6305646112,"ACK! Vegeta is so cool and I love him so much! Freeza needs to die a horrible death! Oh wait...he already did... Okay fine! But it was so sad. I almost cried but I didn't cause I never cry but he was so cute okay I'm rambling I'll stop. Heh heh heh...but anyways this was the best and everyone who reads this, GET IT RIGHT NOW or suffer the wrath of the GOd of Death, mwa ha ha ha haaaa.",970963200,,387,3.85
1057152,5,6305646112,I just bought the tape the other day and when I watched it I was in shock.  It was not at all what I expected!  Vegita happens to be one of my favorite characters and for the first time in this video you see him just break down into tears while dying.  You learn why Vegita is so cold hearted and it's so sweet to see Goku bury him after he dies.  I was seriously about to cry as pathetic as that is.  If you don't like Vegita you might after seeing this...,967852800,,457,3.870967741935484
1057153,5,6305646112,"I think some of the series' best and most moving scenes arise in this one volume, mostly surrounding Vegeta's failure to reach the Super Sayain level and his death at the hands of Frieza.
 I love this series, no doubt the  greatest animated epic to ever be concieved, but at times it can lack in  character depth during crucial and critical situations. However, I think  Vegeta's stirring words as his life fled from him, Goku's reaction to his  relative's death, and Frieza's contempt for the pair are crafted superbly.  No doubt, in my mind, this volume contains some of the most astounding  moments in the series and really gives us insight to the characters.",956707200,2,662,4.754385964912281
1057154,5,6305646112,"I think this video was good for a different reason than most people - I agree that the Vegeta death scene was excellent, but what the scene really succeeded in doing was making the viewer despise Frieza. Frieza had just  demolished Vegeta, and when the prince was pouring out his sad tale, and  began to cry, Frieza smiled and fired a blast through his heart. At that  point, most everyone should think of Frieza as being pure evil, and the  inevitable fight between Goku and Frieza looks that much better.",951177600,5,506,4.588888888888889
1057155,5,6305646112,"Vegeta, the most interesting character in Dragon Ball Z, as you may have guessed, dies in this increadible tape.  Vegeta was always my favorite character and he still is.  Before the video, Vegeta is seen as a careless  monster, killing anyone who opposses him.  Vegeta realizes he is going to  lose, and does not fight back as Frieza ruthlessly beats him.  Vegeta is  eventually killed by Frieza, but with his dying breath, Vegeta confesses  his past.  The most emotional scene I have seen in a long time, even in  american film, was when Vegeta is crying while he tells Gokou about how  Frieza has abused and humiliated him.  Tears came to my eyes as the Saiyne  prince used his last strength to confess his actions.  THis is a truely  magnificent video and a must own.  THe most beatiful and meaningful episode  of Dragon Ball Z to date is in this video. This video shows how death  scenes are to be done.  If you hate Vegeta or love Vegeta, you need to see  this video.  One of the last things Vegeta says is ""He made me what I  am today!"" as he is weeping and cluching the sand of Namek's soil.  This tape, was authenticly, a masterpiece.",949536000,15,1143,4.441747572815534
1057290,4,6305646112,"After watching the three episodes in this video, I thought it was one of the best Dragon Ball Z episodes ever.  In the first episode, no matter what Vegeta tries to stop Frieza, he can't hit Frieza. Even using this really  powerful attack which Frieza blocks with one measley kick. In the second  episode, Vegeta is givin a chance to join Frieza but he refuses. Because of  that, Vegeta gets a serious beating. Also, Goku arrives on the scene fully  healed just in time to hear about Vegeta's past life and why he grew up to  be a violent person. Sadly, Goku also sees Vegeta die and does a proper  burial for him. In the third episode, Goku fights Frieza  but not without  the consequences. Frieza aims a puple eye blast towards Namek turning it  onto a lava land. Goku avoids almost every move Frieza throws at him and  Goku even hits Frieza in the first part of the battle. I thought this was a  great video but it had its boring scenes.",949190400,7,940,4.369942196531792
1057291,5,6305646112,"This is one of the best set of episodes in the whole dbz series. After watching this video you will understand the saiyan prince vegeta a lot more. From the title on the box it is obvious who's gonna die. While  watching this I was amazed. I said, ""wait, this is a simple 10  year-old cartoon!"" but it was one of the most dramatic sequences in  any television show ever. After wacthing the only thing that will be  bobbing around in your head will be why Vegeta didn't realize that he  wasn't a super saiyan. His hair wasn't gold and his eyes weren't blue yet!  if you have a tv and like dragonballz, you should own this video.",949104000,2,627,4.271186440677966
1057292,5,6305646112,"When I saw Vegeta lieing there hanging on by a thread,I cried =( .And when he told Goku about his past,I cried a heck of a lot more than he did! These episodes tell you just how rotton Freiza is. Not to mention that you learn  more about Bardock,Goku's brave but crazy father. For all the Vegeta lovers  out there,this movie is an absolute must! Maybe you won't laugh or fall in  love all over again,but you'll definetly cry your brains out. Yep,it's that  sad.""sniff sniff""",944697600,10,474,4.476744186046512
1057293,5,6305646112,"One of the most dramatic videos of the dragonball saga this one is a must buy! Vegeta the saiyan prince is beaten to death by Frieza and with his last breaths of life tells Goku about his horrible past and that this war  was fought without honor..it was only a game...win or die,  and obviously,  Vegeta struck out,  but don't worry,  he returns later with a vengence :>  This movie is for any Vegeta fan,  like me!",944438400,2,415,4.311688311688312
1057294,5,6305646112,"When I first found out that Vegeta was going to die,I knew Ihad to see this movie. Vegeta is one of my favorite characters. It was one of the sadest deaths on the series. When Vegeta started to tell Goku his story of abuse  and humiliation,especially when Vegeta began to cry,I cried. This was one of  the best DBZ movies that I have ever seen. If you are a true DBZ fan,then  you don't want to miss out on this one! THE BEST!",944265600,,426,4.108433734939759

1057296,5,6305646112,This is one of my favorites because Vegeta tells Goku how he feels about Frieza and what Frieza turned him into.  He even sheds tear's.  And there are some flashbacks that clear things up so don't forget to watch it.,940464000,,216,4.375
7892647,5,6305646112,This is a great episode....since i am the biggest dbz fan to ever live.....seriously ^_^...and my favorite character is vegeta i have every episode and can remember anything......so i can remember this episode as clear as day!! Vegeta is being beaten by freeza after vegeta fights a remarkable and brave battle...finally goku comes just in time and freeza puts vegeta down...it is then when vegeta spilled his thoughts and told goku about everything about himself and all the things he had suffered growing up...yes vegeta cries which is unbelievable to many...this episode made me sad even though i thought it was a great episode!! plz get this......it is worth every penny,1022544000,2,674,5.081081081081081
7892648,5,6305646112,"I enjoy watching all the Dragonball Z volumes.  This particular volume (Frieza:Death Of A Prince) is a mini climax to the series, as it reveals Vegeta's past.  Buy the DBZ DVD's.  It's well worth the money....  In fact, I believe the first few sagas might also be available as boxed sets.
****SIDE NOTE****
Volumes 1-17 are edited (But they are still good)
Volumes 18 on up are uncut :)",1017705600,,386,4.550724637681159

7892650,4,6305646112,"This is a great DVD and you'd be missing out on some huge storyline if you didn't see this.  Goku is rejuvinated and Frieza kills Vegeta.  First it starts off with Vegeta trying to blast Frieza but Frieza is way too fast for Vegeta and Vegeta realizes he can't do anything to Frieza and stops fighting.  Frieza then beats Vegeta up almost to death.  Goku comes into the scene, but Frieza fires a finishing blast through Vegeta.  This part is very exciting.  Goku then begins to fight Frieza and that got a little boring.  This is definitely worth getting.",1011916800,,555,4.545454545454546
7892651,5,6305646112,"The frieza series remains one of the most important sagas in the Dragonball Z series.
Up until only a few weeks ago, I had the misfortune of having to watch the edited American versions of the show. While they weren't terrible, they certainly lacked the intensity of the original Japenese versions. This DVD in particular shows a lot more torture being inflicted upon Vegeta by Frieza. It was very violent, and reminded the viewer that this really isn't a kids show as the cartoon network would have you believe.
Though the disc has no features that merit any mentioning, this DVD delivers none the less. The audio and video quality is exellent, and unlike VHS, you also get the original Japanese versions of these classic episodes fitted in as well. I recommend the uncut version of this disc. It's a lot more intense, and really adds to the quality.  I just wish that funimation would make better use of the DVD format.  These aren't vhs tapes.  DVDs can hold a lot more than a mere three episodes.  Its not as if a Japanese audio track and subtitle option takes up much disc space.  Most movies have those as a standard feature, and can still hold well over four hours of movie footage.  It doesn't really make me want to go out and buy a dvd (...) for only three episodes.  Imagine how much it would cost to get the whole series on DVD.  I guess that's where Ebay comes in, because collecting these dvds would be way too expensive.  There should at least be a boxed set available for each season.  I know there's one for the saiyan and Namek saga, but what about the Frieza saga, or the Android, Cell, Trunks, and World Tournament sagas.  I also think Funimation should re-release the saiyan and Namek saga on DVD, uncut, and with subtitles.",1000166400,,1745,4.543130990415335
