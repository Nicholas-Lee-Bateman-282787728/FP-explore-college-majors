The restoration is simply breathtaking and the histories given for each cartoon is a great addition. My favorite films on this disc were ""Popeye Meets Sindbad"" a two-reel special from 1936, ""The Mechanical Monsters"" a 1940's Max Fleischer ""Superman"" short, and the obscure John and Faith Hubley film ""The Hole"". really great stuff, these cartoons are the best of the best, and you simply won't find a better collection of award winners elsewhere. Good show, Audio Galaxy!!!",1413244800,,578,5.225806451612903
7913404,2,B00000JS6U,"Purchasing this DVD was a big mistake.
I expected to find some hidden animation treasures (like those found in The International Tournee of  Animation tapes).  No such luck.  Many cartoons in this DVD are quite  familiar and can be seen (even more clearly) on the Cartoon Network.
This Cartoon Crazys DVD projects a rather blurry image.  For instance,  the Max Fleischer Superman cartoons included suffer in comparison to the  much superior visual quality found in ""The Superman Cartoons of Max &  Dave Fleischer"".
Sound enhancements are actually annoying and  unnecessary.  They don't seem to meld seamlessly within the original  soundtrack.  In my opinion, those extra sound effects, with Dolby and what  not, are reminiscent of Ted Turner's infamous obsession of colorizing every  black-and-white movie classic.
Except for some interesting historical  facts and trivia provided, I think there's little to recommend here.",956707200,9,923,5.446808510638298

Frankly, the collection of cartoons on this DVD is excellent,  but I can't recommend the disk.  While the visual quality ranges from fair  to very good, the audio is atrocious.  Instead of simply cleaning up the  old mono tracks for the toons, the company that released this DVD went  ahead and ""remastered"" the soundtracks to the cartoons ==>  ERGO, witness sound effects that NEVER existed in the original toons and  horribly imbalanced soundtracks!
Save your money...
Hopefully,  someone WILL release better versions of these toons in the near future.",949968000,11,704,5.052173913043478
