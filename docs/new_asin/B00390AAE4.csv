8391868,3,B00390AAE4,"Having purchased the author's book ""Kettlebell Rx"" which I thoroughly enjoy I expected more from this DVD.  The production quality is alright, but it is lacking in content.",1338508800,2,172,5.142857142857143
8391869,1,B00390AAE4,I purchased this DVD expecting a structured timed workout such as P90x that I could follow. Instead you have a few guys demonstrating how to do the excercise but with no plan to follow or workout structure or timing. You might as well be buying a DVD with a guy showing you how a press up or sit up is done. With no plan or structure to follow this not worth the money. Consider other options,1338422400,3,392,4.171052631578948
