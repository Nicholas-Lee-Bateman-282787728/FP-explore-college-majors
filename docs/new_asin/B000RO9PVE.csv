8201775,5,B000RO9PVE,not as simple as the blurb would have you believe but all the tricks you will need to be the big kahuna on guitar are here.,1375920000,2,123,3.769230769230769
8201776,1,B000RO9PVE,"This is a lot of money to watch a guitarist demonstrate how well he plays.  He demonstrates different people and styles but never offers any instruction as to how to play the selection.  Very, very, disapointing....",1363132800,4,215,4.944444444444445
8201777,2,B000RO9PVE,"He does more playing than teaching you what he's doing.
He doesn't do a whole lot of verbally breaking down what makes him sound good.
Sure he breaks down a few things but nothing like the title lead me to believe.
None the less, if you're a guitar player that is balls to the wall, bent on being a great musician,
go ahead and add it to your collection. There's still good stuff to be learned by watching.",1362441600,2,406,4.217948717948718
8201778,5,B000RO9PVE,"The advice given on this dvd is awesome!! Arlen Roth's style is a combo of country and rock. So get ready for a lot of Country/Rock licks. It's almost to much country for me! But thats me. The details on soloing are what matters! You better have some music theory training in your back pocket before trying this!! Some of the advice given is so deep in theory I had to stop the dvd and think for a few minutes before continuing. I've been playing 40 yrs. with adv. music theory in my back pocket. So beware!! You could probably grow into this in time, but it would be an adventure! This is not beginner friendly!!",1286150400,4,613,4.293103448275862
8201779,5,B000RO9PVE,Arlen Roth is one of the greatest guitar players around. He can break everything down when he is teaching so you can understand what he is playing. If you want to solo at any level this is the DVD for you.,1235088000,6,205,4.024390243902439
