3067736,3,B0011QC9E2,"Ok, so lets take this into account before I evaluate the value of ""Davie & Golimyr"": I am a twenty-two year old male, and this movie was not made with me in mind.  For goodness sakes, this is a stop-motion retelling of the Biblical tale of David and Goliath that has gone straight to video.  The biggest star in it is John Schneider of ""Dukes of Hazard"" fame (and for younger fans, of ""Smallville"" fame).  The movie comes in a single disk, cardboard sleeved DVD that includes a set of free stickers from a Nick Jr. show called ""Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!""  I am not the person who is meant to watch this movie.  Chances are if can read this, then you are not the target audience either.  No, this movie is squarely aimed at the toddler crowd.

The little tots are not going to make note of many of the things I did.  They are not going to muse over the fact that this re-telling of the famous Bible story is so close to the original, that the makers might as well have just made another David and Goliath.  They aren't going to note that this kind of stop-motion comes off as fairly unsophisticated compared to recent releases of ""Corpse Bride"" and ""Wallice and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit.""  Chances are, they won't even pay attention to any of that.  Trying to bring my own childhood back into play, I believe that kids will enjoy this because the colors are bright, the characters cute, and the story still speaks to the underestimated personality in most young tots.

Young ones who are already familiar with the story may get excited that, unlike Goliath, it takes two stones before the mighty Golimyr is taken down.  Otherwise though, they won't care about the production values at all.  This is not the best adaption of the story I've seen.  For me, the ""Superbook"" episode did the story more justice...ah, but I'm nitpicking now.  The movie is clean, colorful, and it will keep your kids busy for forty-five minutes.  So really, what's not to recommend?",1207180800,4,1957,4.545714285714285
3067737,4,B0011QC9E2,"This ""Davie and Golimyr"" DVD contains a cute, but faithful cartoon adaptation of the classic Bible story of David and Goliath.  The animation is stop motion, aned obviously not quite on the level with the latest barrage of pixar and Dreamworks cartoon features.  That said, it is entertaining and engaging, if not such a dazzling visual feast for chronically over-stimulated young eyes and minds.

John Schneider, known to many parents my age from ""Dukes of Hazzard,"" does a good job with the voice narration.  My 7 year old daughter enjoyed it and laughed through it, although even she said it was not quite on par with the Veggie Tales or Shrek.  Still good, clean family entertainment, and clocking in at about 45 minutes- it is just the right length for many younger children who get squirmy trying to sit through feature length movies.

""Davie and Golymir"" is definitely worth checking out if you have toddler or young elementary age kids and are looking for something fun and relatively short that has a good message.",1211414400,,1023,4.850574712643678
3067738,3,B0011QC9E2,"I have four girls (ages 3, 5, 6, and 7). We all watched the video together and enjoyed it. The charicatures are ""larger"" than life and so were very appealing to the little ones. It was an unsual mix of cartoon like sensibilities, but with mroe realistic facial expressions. It's all done in computer graphics. It's obviously a play on the idea of ""David and Golliath."" I don't quite understand why they didn't just come out and do the David and Golliath story. As best I can figure, the creaters wanted to create a story for children (and parents) that didn't necessarily want a bible story.

Interestingly my oldest picked up and this and asked why it wasn't David and Golliath!",1210896000,,679,4.6115702479338845
3067739,4,B0011QC9E2,"The David and Goliath aspect of this movie not overt and it can be taken on it own merits as a off-beat stop motion film.  The story was okay if not overly engaging, but the creative use of stop motion and surreal world depicted kept my kids and I watching all of the way through.  We even played it again later!  I guess it you could say it had a Terry Gilliam feel to it that I liked...I was reminded vaguely of the movie Time Bandits.

Obviously this is not a movie for everyone as the reviews attest.  I certainly am glad I did not buy it, but would have been please with it if found as a family rental.  That said, the kids have watched it 3 times in the past couple of months, not too shabby.  If you are a fan of offbeat animation, then you might enjoy this 45 minute feature.",1210636800,,783,4.045454545454546
3067740,4,B0011QC9E2,"OK, here in a nutshell is why I enjoyed this animated ""half movie"" (it's about 45 minutes long).

1.  Original look with the almost-sort-of-human mythical characters inhabiting a familiar yet surreal world, all shot in stop action.

2.  Very detailed characters and sets.

3.  At times, very intense up-close action photography using stop action animation.  I found it rather amazing.

4.  Some humor, but not continually forced goofiness like some animated Christian features for kids (you know, the guys from the salad bar).

5.  Inspired by the story of David and Goliath, but ends in a different way.

6.  Loved the flying sheep!

Criticisms for which I deducted a star:

1.  Weird sound level.  I had to turn the sound up way high on two separate systems just to listen to it.  So, it's not my equipment buy something strange about how the sound was recored for this DVD.

2.  No special features at all.  No ""making of"" shorts or anything.  I really would have like to learn more about the people who made this and how it was made.

Still, a great animated film with a great message.",1209945600,,1089,4.645502645502646
3067741,2,B0011QC9E2,"Poor ""Davie & Golimyr""; this stop-motion animated video wants so badly to be an installment of Veggie-Tales, but never quite gets there.  The animation itself is pretty impressive, with lots of detail and fluidity, and the voicing of the characters is also top-notch, even though the characters themselves are a bit off-center.  It's the script that causes everything to go off track.  As other reviewers have noted, the entire story is told in rhyme, (with some questionable rhyme schemes, if you want to be picky about it....and I do), and the novelty wears off pretty quick.  My biggest qualm is regarding the writer's choice to tell a slightly-skewed verision of David and Goliath with this video. As other reviewers have asked, why not just re-tell the original story instead of rewriting the Biblical account?  There is such a thing as too much poetic license.

*SPOILER ALERT*

I was rather aggravated that they chose to have the Davie character actually MISS the first time he throws a stone at the giant, and then finally make a successful shot by hitting the giant with a PEAR instead. (huh??) And while I suppose I can understand the producer's choice of not wanting to show Davie actually killing the giant in a kid's video, the decision to have the giant turn NICE after being hit in the head, was a little ridiculous.

*END SPOILER*

In short, I'd have a hard time reccomending this video.  Too much poetic license in the re-telling of a Bible story is not a good thing.",1209168000,,1484,4.76171875
3067742,5,B0011QC9E2,"Do you like to learn that a happy ending can also have a moral? I do! That is why I enjoyed watching this inventively animated with my son who was enthralled.
The moral was simple: Be kind and you will all learn to live happily together. This is actually the Golden Rule, I suppose.

I love the clever animation, and the narration by John Schneider. I am sure that we will watch this DVD time and again, as it has the quality of a moving fairy tale which is remarkably fun to watch. I don't think I have ever seen anything so fabulously created.  The main characters were very appealing as well; Davey and his lamb, ""Chops"" who has a lot of  jewelry on (I am a designer--I can't help liking sheep with jewelry!) are really loveable. They are brave and strong, too, when others keel over in the face of the fearful Giant. They don't give up...! The Giant learns his lesson, and we ALL have a great time!",1208476800,2,902,4.294117647058823
3067743,3,B0011QC9E2,"When I first saw this DVD I was not sure what to think.  It seems that every time someone tries to make over a traditional story, they tend to do a substandard job and I end up disappointed.

With Davie and Golimyr I am still not sure what to think.  The story just left me asking one question- ""Why?""

Why did they go to all this effort to take a really good story and chop it, dice it, slice it, and add all kinds of other stuff to it, when it was really a great story to begin with?  Why not just start fresh?

What this ended up being was like a merging of THE NEVERHOOD, KRYANDIA, GUMBY, WALLACE AND GROMMIT, with a splash of the biblical story of David facing the giant Goliath to add a bit of flavor.

This story takes place in a totally fanciful background.  It is about a king of a bizarre fantasy land of Zites.  There is a giant threatening the peaceful land (his name, of course, is Golimyr) and the only one who comes forward to defeat this giant is Davie- who grows pears and has a flying sheep named Chops.

The movie is filled with total fantasty characters who are half strange looking robots, combinations of bits and pieces of things- like a guy with a castle on his head, odd combinations of rocks made into a ship, and a windmill that is powered by sneezes, a flying sheep......

Davie learns through a pear that his faith can grow from being small and he can live a fruitful life, and he vanquishes the giant.

I am having a hard time reviewing this movie, because on one hand, it is very colorful and the animation is really beautiful and bright and detailed.  However, on the other hand, this movie annoyed me.

When I played this for my entire family, the reactions were varied.  The story is told in rhyme, and the tale is supposed to be entertaining with all kinds of crazy odd things and bizarre characters.

The film has such good potential- and they spent so much time with it, that I feel sad that I did not enjoy this movie.  My family ranges in age from 9 to adult and none of us really was jumping up and down with glee at this movie.

I think what bothers me is that they attempted to jump on the back of a really good solid story with fabulous potential to keep the attention of an audience and they altered it SO much that they ruined it.

If they had taken this story and started fresh with a similar theme but called it a title completely unrelated to the biblical story, perhaps it might not have been so annoying.

Each character was so strange and such a mish mash of oddities that they distracted from the story.  We all spent so much time trying to figure out the point of why so many things in this movie were strange that we really did not enjoy it as much as we could have.

The flying sheep was rather stupid, Golimyr had to be hit twice with a stone before he was conquered- the characters were all so intricate and unrelated to the story that I found that we spent so much time trying to figure out how it all fit together, that we missed what was being said by the narrator.

The story being told in rhyme was a good idea, but it was overshadowed by the overstimulation of the characters- so much was going on with each character that it seemed like a mass of confusion. Being talked at in rhyme, being stimulated by gorgeous color and 3D animation, seeing characters that were so ""out there"" that they did not make any sense, trying to figure out how this related to the original biblical story, and trying to see how this all fit together, was like sensory overload and it tended to make us all burn out and not even care by the end.

Honestly, I feel that if they started fresh and used their creativity to introduce the same concepts WITHOUT depending upon the biblical story which is familiar to many, I think that this might have been a bigger success.

I was irritated by the many changes that they made in the original story which is far more interesting and fun to explore, yet tried to keep close to the same title.

In the real story, David is not even remembered or revered by his family- so much so that when Samuel comes to anoint a king, no one even remembers that he is there- all the other brothers are brought forward first.  His world of living almost estranged from his family with the sheep gives the impression that he had a lonely life- and time to develop character.  Then the mockery when he comes forward to go after the giant of his brothers who are still jealous of him.  The sheer miraculous way that he stands on the faith of his God who taught him to survive impossible odds while being in the fields is what kills the giant- not the stone......

This story on the DVD has very little of this flavor to it.  It is so focused on fantasy that is loses the beauty of the underdog conquering and the poignancy of being disliked/undervalued by your own family and yet living to triumph.

The effect was like trying to make a 12 oz glass of milk less fattening by adding a gallon of water to it and still calling it milk.

I am rating this 3 stars because it does have beautiful colors, some discussion of faith in it, and a slight resemblance to the story it claims to be inspired by.

It is not a terrible movie, but it just did not thrill any of us very much either.  Too much crowded into on small span of time, they seemed to lose and powerful focus.

Perhaps in the future they can make another movie that might turn out better.  This was a good try anyway.  Hats off to their efforts.",1208476800,,5467,4.261627906976744
3067744,4,B0011QC9E2,Davie and Golimyr was a refreshing film to watch with my youngsters who giggled the entire time.  I'm not quite sure they understood the message but they really enjoyed the 'different' look of it.  It's reminiscent of the old 'Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer' movie.,1208390400,,264,4.844444444444444
3067745,4,B0011QC9E2,"I enjoyed this retelling of the David anf Goliath story.  It was fun and quirky.  The characters were odd, but interesting.  How often do you see a sheep that flies, or people who live on other people.  The stop motion was definitely a throw back to the 70's stop motion Christmas stories.

Just as a stand alone story I think most kids (aged 3 - 9) would enjoy this DVD. It will keep their attention for the 45 mins. of the show.

I would caution parents whose children might get confused with this re-telling of David and Goliath compared to the Biblical story.  Be prepared for questions.",1208390400,,591,4.4672897196261685
3067746,3,B0011QC9E2,"Davie & Golimyr is a DVD release from Anchor Bay/Starz productions.  The story is a new take on the old biblical tale of David and Goliath.  Instead of boring old computer animation, the filmmakers used claymation and some very nifty camerawork.  This new version breathes life into the often told story of good triumphing over evil.  Davie is young and idealistic kid who tries to topple the giant Golimyr.  But his first attempt ends in utter failure and embarrassment.  So, he works hard to try and best the goliath with the help of Chops his faithful sidekick and belief in himself to save the day.  But will it be enough?

The DVD is real bare bones, except for some previews for other kid friendly programs.  Davie & Golimyr is presented in full-frame and in 2.0 English soundtrack.  If you're a fan of family friendly entertainment or if you love claymation, then this DVD is just for you!",1208304000,,896,4.649681528662421
3067747,4,B0011QC9E2,"The stop-motion animation in this tale for kids of all ages is spectacular, and as the adults marvel at the technical skill of the artists who labored on ""Davie & Golimyr,"" kids will love the sheer fun of it. Younger folks may have trouble understanding the rhymed dialogue, but they will certainly enjoy the action, and there is plenty of it. Davie and his lamb Chops, who sports little butterfly wings and flies with ease, first try out their strength against a mechanical monster, and as the Storyteller philosophizes, ""Sometimes it takes failing a test, in order to prepare for a much longer one."" Later they get to battle with the mean giant Golimyr, whose ""appetite grows for a destruction buffet,"" and here the story takes on the biblical ""David and Goliath"" comparison, as Davie, a peaceful pear grower, has not much else but faith, a sling and a pear to go on.

I like the way the ""Isles of the Sea"" are pictured (it reminds me a little of ""Waterworld""!), and especially like the impish fellow who is in the company of the Storyteller. The faces are expressive, and the colors bright. And also, there is a lovely twist to the tale, adding God's infinite mercy and the ability in all of us, no matter how dark and grumpy, to change. Family approved by The Dove Foundation, this award-winning DVD will delight children and their parents alike.",1208304000,,1350,4.6722689075630255
3067748,4,B0011QC9E2,"Davie and Golimyr is a stop action animation film that appears to be trying to bring together Veggie Tales with Wallace and Grommit.  It is a Biblically based retelling of David and Goliath but focuses more upon that as a theme than being Scripturally accurate.  If your kids can handle slushies being launched from the walls of Jericho (A Veggie Tales classic), then you'll probably find nothing objectionable in this retelling of the Scriptural tale which ends in the Giant being reformed rather than killed.

As an adult I found the tale to be creative and engaging, but I was taxed to pay attention for the full 45 minutes of the feature.  Thankfully, my co-reviewer, a 6 year old rumored to live at home with my wife and me, was able to lend his expertise to the experience and for the most part he found it interesting and funny.  He still asks to view it occassionally in between his other repeat favorites and that really is the ultimate test for him.  When questioned on what he liked about the feature, he responded that it was funny and he liked the flying sheep especially.

All in all, for a home feature video, there is nothing to object to in terms of content or pace.  It's aimed for a younger audience.  Adults will likely have to settle more for the response of that audience than to try and hold it to a higher standard.

4 Stars.

3067749,4,B0011QC9E2,"I got this video for my two grandsons, ages 3 and 8, so I think that I'll just pass on to you what they said about the movie.

My 8 year old grandson said that he like the movie, especially because ""it was weird."" He said the animation was different and that the characters ""spoke in poetry.""

My 3 year old grandson simply loved it. The movie kept him entertained the entire time and he occasionally voiced his approval by laughing or yelling at the screen. He like the movie so much that literally as soon as the video ended he was begging to watch it again.

It's a good story, suitable for kids of all ages.",1207872000,2,611,4.205128205128205
3067750,3,B0011QC9E2,"I first saw this on display behind a store window in Park City Utah during the Sundance Film Festival -- the look intrigued me, which is why I decided to pick this up and show my kids.  The design is by James Christensen, the fantasy artist, and as with all of his work there is a whimsical and ingenious feel to the characters (little homunculi in some of the characters heads, wings on sheep, etc.).  The animation itself is fairly crude, but in a good way -- it resembles all of those old Christmas specials like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.  In the end, the style and story felt a bit kitchy to me but my kids were amused, and laughed fairly often.  They had fun with this and I guess they are the target audience.  I can't see myself ever sitting down to watch it again but I bet they will.",1207785600,4,798,4.223684210526316
3067751,4,B0011QC9E2,"My children (4 & 6) really enjoyed this.  The claymation is extremely creative and offer lots of funny images.  While some adults may find the rhyme a bit tiresome, my kids got really into it and laughed a lot.  It was also a wonderful chance to discuss with my kids notions of confidence, responsibility, and faith.  I should also note that for those who are wondering if this is suited only for Christians, as a Jew I can assure you there were no issues.  My only caveat (and I hate to spoil this for anyone)--

SPOILER ALERT

3067752,3,B0011QC9E2,"""Davie and Golimyr"" is a charming religiously-themed storybook tale, if you don't mind the message, which should come as no surprise as it's based on the story of David and Goliath.  It's about an aspiring young warrior named Davie, who is the only resident of the land of the Zites to stand up to the terrible giant Golimyr, with the help of his flying sheep Chops. Golimyr hears of the ""faith"" that the Zites possess, and he decides to take it as though it were a treasure, then force the Zites to bow to him as their new king.  So Davie becomes, quite literally, ""defender of the faith"".  It's told in rhyming couplets reminiscent of Dr. Seuss' verse, though not as clever.  But the strength of this video is the amusing and inventive stop-motion animation and design, based on the work of illustrator James Christensen, which makes it enjoyable to watch and makes the message that much more palatable.  It's, needless to say, appropriate for family viewing, at least school-age children and above.",1207699200,2,1001,4.763005780346821
3067753,4,B0011QC9E2,"I am a regular viewer of faith channels on Saturday mornings, and I am fascinated by the imagination and creativity of so many directors and churches in producing so many wonderful shows for children. These days we need more of it, and not less. The story of David and Goliath is retold so many times and in so many ways that it has become part of our lives irrespective of faiths. One of the highlights of this DVD is hearing the voice of John Schneider who entertained so many fans as Bo Duke in Dukes of Hazard, and later in the WB drama Smallville. The story is told with the same moral theme; through faith in God you can conquer anything in life no matter how small or weak you are.

When a giant named Golimyr threatens the village of Zites, their King Sullic calls for a hero to fight the enemy. Davie, a peaceful pear grower with a sling, a sheep named Chop, and strong faith in God volunteers to save the village. At the end of the show the giant Golimyr repents for his meanness and he is forgiven by Zites; this ending is appropriate for children.  This animated show is 45 minutes long and it is very entertaining for both young and old; highly recommended.

3067754,3,B0011QC9E2,"as someone who actively stays away from most mainstream ""Christian"" media, as the majority of it seems way too preachy and ""we're better than everyone else"", I was hesitant to review this film.  But the Fantasy element of the boxes artwork intrigued me enough to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.

My husband, eleven year old son and myself watched this last night. We all agreed that it was a adorable film-in fact, we would have given it a five star review, except for one thing-the story is told entirely in RHYME-which was slightly annoying by films end.

As a mom who has had to peripherally listen to multiple replayings of preschool film in the past, I'd imagine the rhyming would be psychosis inducing after several days.  But if you can stand that-this quirky little film has many good points.  Tops on the list is visually the stop animation is stunning, highly detailed, and very imaginative.  Fantastical inventions abound, the costuming of the characters, and funny facial expressions remined this film buff family of some of our favorites like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Labyrinth-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B000R8YC1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Labyrinth (Anniversary Edition)</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wallace-Gromit-The-Curse-of-the-Were-Rabbit-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000CZ0PT4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wallace & Gromit - The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (Widescreen Edition)</a>.

Finally-the faith aspect of the film was well done-gently told for the age group, not ""preachy"" at all, and told with a positive end message:  Forgiveness.  True believers as well as those  open minded ""on the fence"" believers or  even non faith based viewers would enjoy this sweet childrens film that's a great visual change of pace from most modern, CGI based animation.

So finally:
Art: 5 stars

3067755,4,B0011QC9E2,"This adaptation of David and Goliath is both fun and educational. ""Davie & Golimyr"" sticks close to premise of the small faithful hero overtaking a big giant.  However, it adds its own twist to the biblical tale, without losing the moral lesson that faith is more important than size when facing large obstacles. The visual style is a mix of claymation and digital animation. Upon seeing it, I was not sure my son (my co-critic) would like it, but he really LOVED it.  Upon concluding our viewing, he said that was really good.

Notable characteristics of the movie are a comedic styling and poetic, rhyming dialogue.

I was pleased with this adaptation and loved the visuals. It's one I would highly recommend.",1207526400,,711,4.80327868852459
3067756,3,B0011QC9E2,"I watched this DVD on my own one afternoon, and other than being a version of the biblical story and a tale of faith, it really wasn't all that interesting.  The stop-motion animation was unusual and imaginative, but the strangeness of some of the characters detracted from the telling of the story, which, by the way, was done in rhyme.

Deciding that I was perhaps a bit older than the target audience, I ran it for my son, and his very first comment was that it wasn't drawn properly.  I spent the next fifteen minutes fielding questions about why some of the people had other people living on their heads, and others didn't, and why they didn't have legs, and why did a sheep have wings, and why the people were so ugly.  The narrator and his minstrel were considered b-o-ring, and he lost interest in everything except the final battle. (He didn't make it all the way to the end of the DVD)

PROS:
1. Slightly different retelling of the story of David & Goliath, where the young hero proves his faith in God using a sling, some stones and a spiritually-enhanced pear.
2. Not your standard animation
3. Only 45 minutes long

CONS:
1. The characters, while quirky and unusual, don't fit in very well with the flow of story, causing unnecessary distractions
2. Many unlikeable characters
3. Golimyr has a teddy bear????
4. The rhyme gets lost in the muddle

Recommended for fans of the art of James C. Christensen, and children who don't ask too many questions.  I'd prefer to stick with more traditional interpretations of the story.

3302234,4,B0011QC9E2,"This ""Davie and Golimyr"" DVD contains a cute, but faithful cartoon adaptation of the classic Bible story of David and Goliath.  The animation is stop motion, aned obviously not quite on the level with the latest barrage of pixar and Dreamworks cartoon features.  That said, it is entertaining and engaging, if not such a dazzling visual feast for chronically over-stimulated young eyes and minds.

John Schneider, known to many parents my age from ""Dukes of Hazzard,"" does a good job with the voice narration.  My 7 year old daughter enjoyed it and laughed through it, although even she said it was not quite on par with the Veggie Tales or Shrek.  Still good, clean family entertainment, and clocking in at about 45 minutes- it is just the right length for many younger children who get squirmy trying to sit through feature length movies.

""Davie and Golymir"" is definitely worth checking out if you have toddler or young elementary age kids and are looking for something fun and relatively short that has a good message.",1211414400,,1023,4.850574712643678

The charicatures are ""larger"" than life and so were very appealing to the little ones. It was an unsual mix of cartoon like sensibilities, but with mroe realistic facial expressions. It's all done in computer graphics. It's obviously a play on the idea of ""David and Golliath."" I don't quite understand why they didn't just come out and do the David and Golliath story. As best I can figure, the creaters wanted to create a story for children (and parents) that didn't necessarily want a bible story.

Interestingly my oldest picked up and this and asked why it wasn't David and Golliath!",1210896000,,679,4.6115702479338845

The story was okay if not overly engaging, but the creative use of stop motion and surreal world depicted kept my kids and I watching all of the way through.  We even played it again later!  I guess it you could say it had a Terry Gilliam feel to it that I liked...I was reminded vaguely of the movie Time Bandits.

Obviously this is not a movie for everyone as the reviews attest.  I certainly am glad I did not buy it, but would have been please with it if found as a family rental.  That said, the kids have watched it 3 times in the past couple of months, not too shabby.

3302237,4,B0011QC9E2,"OK, here in a nutshell is why I enjoyed this animated ""half movie"" (it's about 45 minutes long).

1.  Original look with the almost-sort-of-human mythical characters inhabiting a familiar yet surreal world, all shot in stop action.

2.  Very detailed characters and sets.

3.  At times, very intense up-close action photography using stop action animation.  I found it rather amazing.

4.  Some humor, but not continually forced goofiness like some animated Christian features for kids (you know, the guys from the salad bar).

5.  Inspired by the story of David and Goliath, but ends in a different way.

6.  Loved the flying sheep!

Criticisms for which I deducted a star:

1.  Weird sound level.  I had to turn the sound up way high on two separate systems just to listen to it.  So, it's not my equipment buy something strange about how the sound was recored for this DVD.

2.  No special features at all.  No ""making of"" shorts or anything.  I really would have like to learn more about the people who made this and how it was made.

Still, a great animated film with a great message.",1209945600,,1089,4.645502645502646
3302238,2,B0011QC9E2,"Poor ""Davie & Golimyr""; this stop-motion animated video wants so badly to be an installment of Veggie-Tales, but never quite gets there.  The animation itself is pretty impressive, with lots of detail and fluidity, and the voicing of the characters is also top-notch, even though the characters themselves are a bit off-center.  It's the script that causes everything to go off track.  As other reviewers have noted, the entire story is told in rhyme, (with some questionable rhyme schemes, if you want to be picky about it....and I do), and the novelty wears off pretty quick.  My biggest qualm is regarding the writer's choice to tell a slightly-skewed verision of David and Goliath with this video. As other reviewers have asked, why not just re-tell the original story instead of rewriting the Biblical account?  There is such a thing as too much poetic license.

*SPOILER ALERT*

I was rather aggravated that they chose to have the Davie character actually MISS the first time he throws a stone at the giant, and then finally make a successful shot by hitting the giant with a PEAR instead. (huh??) And while I suppose I can understand the producer's choice of not wanting to show Davie actually killing the giant in a kid's video, the decision to have the giant turn NICE after being hit in the head, was a little ridiculous.

*END SPOILER*

In short, I'd have a hard time reccomending this video.  Too much poetic license in the re-telling of a Bible story is not a good thing.",1209168000,,1484,4.76171875
3302239,5,B0011QC9E2,"Do you like to learn that a happy ending can also have a moral? I do! That is why I enjoyed watching this inventively animated with my son who was enthralled.
The moral was simple: Be kind and you will all learn to live happily together. This is actually the Golden Rule, I suppose.

I love the clever animation, and the narration by John Schneider. I am sure that we will watch this DVD time and again, as it has the quality of a moving fairy tale which is remarkably fun to watch. I don't think I have ever seen anything so fabulously created.  The main characters were very appealing as well; Davey and his lamb, ""Chops"" who has a lot of  jewelry on (I am a designer--I can't help liking sheep with jewelry!) are really loveable. They are brave and strong, too, when others keel over in the face of the fearful Giant. They don't give up...! The Giant learns his lesson, and we ALL have a great time!",1208476800,2,902,4.294117647058823
3302240,3,B0011QC9E2,"When I first saw this DVD I was not sure what to think.  It seems that every time someone tries to make over a traditional story, they tend to do a substandard job and I end up disappointed.

With Davie and Golimyr I am still not sure what to think.  The story just left me asking one question- ""Why?""

Why did they go to all this effort to take a really good story and chop it, dice it, slice it, and add all kinds of other stuff to it, when it was really a great story to begin with?  Why not just start fresh?

What this ended up being was like a merging of THE NEVERHOOD, KRYANDIA, GUMBY, WALLACE AND GROMMIT, with a splash of the biblical story of David facing the giant Goliath to add a bit of flavor.

This story takes place in a totally fanciful background.  It is about a king of a bizarre fantasy land of Zites.  There is a giant threatening the peaceful land (his name, of course, is Golimyr) and the only one who comes forward to defeat this giant is Davie- who grows pears and has a flying sheep named Chops.

The movie is filled with total fantasty characters who are half strange looking robots, combinations of bits and pieces of things- like a guy with a castle on his head, odd combinations of rocks made into a ship, and a windmill that is powered by sneezes, a flying sheep......

Davie learns through a pear that his faith can grow from being small and he can live a fruitful life, and he vanquishes the giant.

I am having a hard time reviewing this movie, because on one hand, it is very colorful and the animation is really beautiful and bright and detailed.  However, on the other hand, this movie annoyed me.

When I played this for my entire family, the reactions were varied.  The story is told in rhyme, and the tale is supposed to be entertaining with all kinds of crazy odd things and bizarre characters.

The film has such good potential- and they spent so much time with it, that I feel sad that I did not enjoy this movie.  My family ranges in age from 9 to adult and none of us really was jumping up and down with glee at this movie.

I think what bothers me is that they attempted to jump on the back of a really good solid story with fabulous potential to keep the attention of an audience and they altered it SO much that they ruined it.

If they had taken this story and started fresh with a similar theme but called it a title completely unrelated to the biblical story, perhaps it might not have been so annoying.

Each character was so strange and such a mish mash of oddities that they distracted from the story.  We all spent so much time trying to figure out the point of why so many things in this movie were strange that we really did not enjoy it as much as we could have.

The flying sheep was rather stupid, Golimyr had to be hit twice with a stone before he was conquered- the characters were all so intricate and unrelated to the story that I found that we spent so much time trying to figure out how it all fit together, that we missed what was being said by the narrator.

The story being told in rhyme was a good idea, but it was overshadowed by the overstimulation of the characters- so much was going on with each character that it seemed like a mass of confusion. Being talked at in rhyme, being stimulated by gorgeous color and 3D animation, seeing characters that were so ""out there"" that they did not make any sense, trying to figure out how this related to the original biblical story, and trying to see how this all fit together, was like sensory overload and it tended to make us all burn out and not even care by the end.

Honestly, I feel that if they started fresh and used their creativity to introduce the same concepts WITHOUT depending upon the biblical story which is familiar to many, I think that this might have been a bigger success.

I was irritated by the many changes that they made in the original story which is far more interesting and fun to explore, yet tried to keep close to the same title.

In the real story, David is not even remembered or revered by his family- so much so that when Samuel comes to anoint a king, no one even remembers that he is there- all the other brothers are brought forward first.  His world of living almost estranged from his family with the sheep gives the impression that he had a lonely life- and time to develop character.  Then the mockery when he comes forward to go after the giant of his brothers who are still jealous of him.  The sheer miraculous way that he stands on the faith of his God who taught him to survive impossible odds while being in the fields is what kills the giant- not the stone......

This story on the DVD has very little of this flavor to it.  It is so focused on fantasy that is loses the beauty of the underdog conquering and the poignancy of being disliked/undervalued by your own family and yet living to triumph.

The effect was like trying to make a 12 oz glass of milk less fattening by adding a gallon of water to it and still calling it milk.

I am rating this 3 stars because it does have beautiful colors, some discussion of faith in it, and a slight resemblance to the story it claims to be inspired by.

It is not a terrible movie, but it just did not thrill any of us very much either.  Too much crowded into on small span of time, they seemed to lose and powerful focus.

Perhaps in the future they can make another movie that might turn out better.  This was a good try anyway.  Hats off to their efforts.",1208476800,,5467,4.261627906976744

How often do you see a sheep that flies, or people who live on other people.  The stop motion was definitely a throw back to the 70's stop motion Christmas stories.

Just as a stand alone story I think most kids (aged 3 - 9) would enjoy this DVD. It will keep their attention for the 45 mins. of the show.

3302243,3,B0011QC9E2,"Davie & Golimyr is a DVD release from Anchor Bay/Starz productions.  The story is a new take on the old biblical tale of David and Goliath.  Instead of boring old computer animation, the filmmakers used claymation and some very nifty camerawork.  This new version breathes life into the often told story of good triumphing over evil.  Davie is young and idealistic kid who tries to topple the giant Golimyr.  But his first attempt ends in utter failure and embarrassment.  So, he works hard to try and best the goliath with the help of Chops his faithful sidekick and belief in himself to save the day.  But will it be enough?

The DVD is real bare bones, except for some previews for other kid friendly programs.  Davie & Golimyr is presented in full-frame and in 2.0 English soundtrack.

Younger folks may have trouble understanding the rhymed dialogue, but they will certainly enjoy the action, and there is plenty of it. Davie and his lamb Chops, who sports little butterfly wings and flies with ease, first try out their strength against a mechanical monster, and as the Storyteller philosophizes, ""Sometimes it takes failing a test, in order to prepare for a much longer one."" Later they get to battle with the mean giant Golimyr, whose ""appetite grows for a destruction buffet,"" and here the story takes on the biblical ""David and Goliath"" comparison, as Davie, a peaceful pear grower, has not much else but faith, a sling and a pear to go on.

I like the way the ""Isles of the Sea"" are pictured (it reminds me a little of ""Waterworld""!), and especially like the impish fellow who is in the company of the Storyteller. The faces are expressive, and the colors bright. And also, there is a lovely twist to the tale, adding God's infinite mercy and the ability in all of us, no matter how dark and grumpy, to change.

3302245,4,B0011QC9E2,"Davie and Golimyr is a stop action animation film that appears to be trying to bring together Veggie Tales with Wallace and Grommit.  It is a Biblically based retelling of David and Goliath but focuses more upon that as a theme than being Scripturally accurate.  If your kids can handle slushies being launched from the walls of Jericho (A Veggie Tales classic), then you'll probably find nothing objectionable in this retelling of the Scriptural tale which ends in the Giant being reformed rather than killed.

As an adult I found the tale to be creative and engaging, but I was taxed to pay attention for the full 45 minutes of the feature.  Thankfully, my co-reviewer, a 6 year old rumored to live at home with my wife and me, was able to lend his expertise to the experience and for the most part he found it interesting and funny.  He still asks to view it occassionally in between his other repeat favorites and that really is the ultimate test for him.  When questioned on what he liked about the feature, he responded that it was funny and he liked the flying sheep especially.

All in all, for a home feature video, there is nothing to object to in terms of content or pace.  It's aimed for a younger audience.  Adults will likely have to settle more for the response of that audience than to try and hold it to a higher standard.

4 Stars.

The animation itself is fairly crude, but in a good way -- it resembles all of those old Christmas specials like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.

3302249,3,B0011QC9E2,"""Davie and Golimyr"" is a charming religiously-themed storybook tale, if you don't mind the message, which should come as no surprise as it's based on the story of David and Goliath.  It's about an aspiring young warrior named Davie, who is the only resident of the land of the Zites to stand up to the terrible giant Golimyr, with the help of his flying sheep Chops. Golimyr hears of the ""faith"" that the Zites possess, and he decides to take it as though it were a treasure, then force the Zites to bow to him as their new king.  So Davie becomes, quite literally, ""defender of the faith"".  It's told in rhyming couplets reminiscent of Dr. Seuss' verse, though not as clever.  But the strength of this video is the amusing and inventive stop-motion animation and design, based on the work of illustrator James Christensen, which makes it enjoyable to watch and makes the message that much more palatable.  It's, needless to say, appropriate for family viewing, at least school-age children and above.",1207699200,2,1001,4.763005780346821
3302250,4,B0011QC9E2,"I am a regular viewer of faith channels on Saturday mornings, and I am fascinated by the imagination and creativity of so many directors and churches in producing so many wonderful shows for children. These days we need more of it, and not less. The story of David and Goliath is retold so many times and in so many ways that it has become part of our lives irrespective of faiths. One of the highlights of this DVD is hearing the voice of John Schneider who entertained so many fans as Bo Duke in Dukes of Hazard, and later in the WB drama Smallville. The story is told with the same moral theme; through faith in God you can conquer anything in life no matter how small or weak you are.

When a giant named Golimyr threatens the village of Zites, their King Sullic calls for a hero to fight the enemy. Davie, a peaceful pear grower with a sling, a sheep named Chop, and strong faith in God volunteers to save the village. At the end of the show the giant Golimyr repents for his meanness and he is forgiven by Zites; this ending is appropriate for children.  This animated show is 45 minutes long and it is very entertaining for both young and old; highly recommended.

My husband, eleven year old son and myself watched this last night. We all agreed that it was a adorable film-in fact, we would have given it a five star review, except for one thing-the story is told entirely in RHYME-which was slightly annoying by films end.

As a mom who has had to peripherally listen to multiple replayings of preschool film in the past, I'd imagine the rhyming would be psychosis inducing after several days.  But if you can stand that-this quirky little film has many good points.  Tops on the list is visually the stop animation is stunning, highly detailed, and very imaginative.  Fantastical inventions abound, the costuming of the characters, and funny facial expressions remined this film buff family of some of our favorites like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Labyrinth-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B000R8YC1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Labyrinth (Anniversary Edition)</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wallace-Gromit-The-Curse-of-the-Were-Rabbit-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000CZ0PT4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wallace & Gromit - The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (Widescreen Edition)</a>.

However, it adds its own twist to the biblical tale, without losing the moral lesson that faith is more important than size when facing large obstacles. The visual style is a mix of claymation and digital animation. Upon seeing it, I was not sure my son (my co-critic) would like it, but he really LOVED it.  Upon concluding our viewing, he said that was really good.

Notable characteristics of the movie are a comedic styling and poetic, rhyming dialogue.

3302253,3,B0011QC9E2,"I watched this DVD on my own one afternoon, and other than being a version of the biblical story and a tale of faith, it really wasn't all that interesting.  The stop-motion animation was unusual and imaginative, but the strangeness of some of the characters detracted from the telling of the story, which, by the way, was done in rhyme.

Deciding that I was perhaps a bit older than the target audience, I ran it for my son, and his very first comment was that it wasn't drawn properly.  I spent the next fifteen minutes fielding questions about why some of the people had other people living on their heads, and others didn't, and why they didn't have legs, and why did a sheep have wings, and why the people were so ugly.  The narrator and his minstrel were considered b-o-ring, and he lost interest in everything except the final battle. (He didn't make it all the way to the end of the DVD)

PROS:
1. Slightly different retelling of the story of David & Goliath, where the young hero proves his faith in God using a sling, some stones and a spiritually-enhanced pear.
2. Not your standard animation
3. Only 45 minutes long

CONS:
1. The characters, while quirky and unusual, don't fit in very well with the flow of story, causing unnecessary distractions
2. Many unlikeable characters
3. Golimyr has a teddy bear????
4. The rhyme gets lost in the muddle

Recommended for fans of the art of James C. Christensen, and children who don't ask too many questions.  I'd prefer to stick with more traditional interpretations of the story.

When we finally did watch it, they were interested and watched it all the way through, but were also not interested in seeing it again.  While it was cute and different from what they are used to, it just can't hold a candle to the animation and computer effects of today's movies.

The story is a good, wholesome one.  I definitely recommend it for families with younger children - a wonderful opportunity for dialogue between parents and kids!

8242158,3,B0011QC9E2,"DAVIE & GOLIMYR is a re-telling of the story of David and Goliath from the Bible.  The story told using stop-motion animation and is set within the fantasy world of James Christensen.  The tale begins with a storyteller telling the story to one of his helpers.  The island kingdom of the Zites is preparing for an attack by a terrible giant named Golimyr.  Golimyr has already destroyed several other kingdoms and King Sullic knows the Golimyr will soon come to Zite.  A proclamation is sent throughout the land seeking a champion to fight the giant, but the only person to answer the challenge is the boy pear grower Davie and his sidekick flying sheep, Chops.  Davie is sent home several times, but when Golimyr finally arrives, there is no one to meet his challenge.  Then Davie appears and on faith answers the call.

The tale of David and Goliath has been retold in countless ways and the filmmakers take certain liberties with the story, e.g. Davie doesn't kill Golimyr at the end.  Therefore, those who are stickler's for Biblical-inspired or based stories will be disappointed by certain elements of DAVIE & GOLIMYR.

The animation isn't the quality of a WALLACE AND GROMIT short, but isn't all that bad and is reminiscent of the stuff done for the Rudolph television Christmas specials.  I was really impressed with the visual images of the story.  The characters, landscapes, and even props are all imaginatively stunning.  I was reminded of the worlds in Jim Henson's LABYRINTH and THE DARK CRYSTAL.

The one problem I did have with the story is that everyone speaks in rhyming couplets.  The narrator does, his helper does, and the characters in the story do.  I love Dr. Suess and I actually enjoy reading poetry, but listening to the characters in the story speak in rhyme for forty-five minutes was quite irritating.

Overall, DAVIE & GOLIMYR may not be great short film, but with it's imaginative characters its not too bad.  With all the bright colors and rhymed speech, it's a great DVD for kids six and under.",1215820800,,2028,4.778735632183908
8242159,4,B0011QC9E2,"I certainly can't fault the reach of the makers of Davie and Golimyr.  The fun tongue in cheek jokes abound and are good fun for the kids and a quick laugh for the adults.  Sneeze powered windmills, pear growing hero, a sheep as a companion, the list goes on.

Overall the animation was good.  The plot ok and the production pretty good again.  The plot should not come as a surprise as it is based on the Biblical David and Goliath story.  The only problem is by adding all the silly name changes and distractions I thought it was less interesting and impactful then just doing an animated light version of the original tale.  Again I could be a bit different then most.

Pros:
1. Nice animation.
2. Very light hearted.  Nothing to be scared of here.
3. Manages to keep the Biblical lesson in the story.
4. Good production values.
5. Calling a sheep ""Chops"" is really funny.

Cons:
1. Humor sometimes overpowers the story.
2. Changes to the original story and twists make the tale a bit confusing and distracting.
3. 45 minutes seems a bit short for a full DVD.

Overall not a bad little video.  I would give it three stars except my 3 children (ages 2, 5 and 6) seem to like it better then that.  So take my opinion with a grain of salt as my kids are closer to the target audience.  4 stars.",1214438400,,1294,4.3153526970954355
8242160,4,B0011QC9E2,"This is a fun little DVD that is propelled by delightful stop motion animation. It's whimsical and at times just plain silly, but it carries a simple message that is perfect for kids of all ages: that faith really can make miracles happen. The characters are winsome and attractive, and the sets look like something that would be cooked up if Nick Parks were to create a clay-mation sequel to ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" The story is obviously a retelling of David and Goliath, but inventively revisioned and complete with a thoroughly feel-good surprise ending. I'm not sure that this will become the kind of classic that you'll want to watch every year (hence only the four stars), but it's got enough juice to entertain even the grown-ups more than once.",1212192000,,764,4.7518796992481205
8242161,4,B0011QC9E2,"When you retell a Bible story of David and Goliath, you may want to entertain as well as recant the ideals of the story.  This DVD presentation seem like an episode of a set of Bible stories

This stop motion animation seems very well made in regards to animation. It is cute in spots, but the 30 minutes seems to take forever to tell.

John (Pa Kent from Smallville) Schneider tries to do the voice of Golimyr (Goliath), but it comes across as its weakest link with a few vocal grunts.

The storytelling is sharp. I would have enjoyed seeing if therer were any others in this Bible collection if it was available

Other than that the movie was great!",1211500800,,270,3.925925925925926
