Synopsis: While on a religious pilgrimage from Tehran to Masad a married couple turn off onto a deserted road to take some photographs. Their car breaks down leaving them stranded until they come across a small village carved into a rocky hillside nearby. While the husband travels into the city with the local mechanic/school teacher to purchase spare parts for the car, his wife (Leila Hatami) stays behind to take care of the local children. As the tale unfolds she discovers that the helpful mechanic and an elderly, senile man are the only adult males in the village. No clear explanation is ever given to account for the absence of men and soon other questions also arise during her stay but they all remain unanswered as well.

Critique: A holy pilgrimage, an unplanned detour, a freak accident and a prophetic utterance, these are the basic elements in an enigmatic plot further complicated by minimal dialogue and explanation. 'Deserted Station' is an odd, surreal '02 Iranian film directed by Alireza Raisian starring the alluring Leila Hatami. It doesn't take long for the viewer to come to the realization that the storyline unfolding on the screen is merely a vehicle devised to point to something deeper and more intangible go on. The real tale is taking place within the mind and soul of the beautiful female pilgrim. We are told early in the film that she was at one time a school teacher and that she is unable to conceive. Quite possibly this journey off the main highway symbolizes her personal inner struggle to come to grips with her lost opportunity for motherhood and family? Maybe the reason for this spiritual trek is to gain God's favor and have her wishes granted, or maybe it is to learn to accept and appreciate what God has given?

The illusory nature of this obscure habitation in the desert is initially revealed to the viewer when the enchanting Leila passes through a stone archway leading into the village main square, the heart of the community. Like some ritualistic ""rite of passage"" her entrance is slow, hypnotic and subtle, creating an atomosphere of revential timelessness. As she crosses through moving from profane to sacred space one becomes aware that the events now about to unfold will have a sense of ambiquity and mystery about them. Ultimately your enjoyment of this film, or lack there of, will be determined not by what is seen but by what is implied. As for me, I'm still trying to figure it out.

2423064,4,B000BKVROC,"This film is paced as European films are: no car wrecks or shoot-outs. An Iranian couple sets out seeking a blessing of pregnancy-- a painful ""failing"" women feel in the Middle East, as they did in biblical times. The find themselves stranded in a nearly deserted village, empty of men who leave to work elsewhere each day. The wife, a teacher, takes over the cave-like  classroom while the husband seeks help with the multitalented teacher. The action pivots on human relationships, on poverty and a hunger for knowledge. The city couple finds the country; they join in the common, often heroic struggle during their short time together, learning, coming to know each other, helping, sharing. These are not the Iranians we see in the news; these are real fellow humans, struggling with the  bare essentials in a wild, deserted land.",1424390400,4,833,4.942857142857143
2423065,5,B000BKVROC,"How ""good"" this film is, depends on the viewer.
 One thing certain is that the composition of each individual frame  is a masterpiece in photography. Just look at the trees through the archways,  You could frame each as a still. It's an incredibly satisfying feast for the eyes
The husband is a photographer searching for the elusive award winning picture, a reflection of reality; and the wife, a fragile, unfulfilled, misunderstood soul, searching for that more elusive thing, reality itself. Amazing how Iranian artists produce such amazing work in a suffocating cultural environment. If you want to be entertained, try Oceans 11.12 or thirteen. If you want to savor a deeply satisfying experience without laughing,crying, getting scared or excited, watch this. It's a five star quality film.",1414886400,5,795,5.244094488188976

2423067,2,B000BKVROC,I have seen better Iranian films and cannot recommend this one. The picture is washed out and nothing very interesting happens. The one film in Farsi that stands out for me is A Separation on Blu-ray (2011 Best Foreign Language Film). I will continue to watch Iranian films in the future because they raise issues that are not often found in American films. I watch a lot of European films and am finding a lot of interesting Chinese films.,1369008000,,440,4.582278481012659
2423068,5,B000BKVROC,"While it is true that the average [American] viewer will not appreciate this film, the reason is not because there isn't much to think about (as one reviewer complains).  On the contrary, this film doesn't provide cheap entertainment but rather tasks the viewer with having to think more than the usual mindless cinema that Westerners are accustomed to; the real problem is that this film doesn't entertain Americans in the way that they expect to be entertained by films: by easy, mindless, and gratuitous themes such as sex, violence, melodrama, comedy, etc.

Contrary to what one reviewer has said about the film having no emotional scenes, this film has some of the most emotionally intense and poignant scenes I've ever witnessed in a film, and like a majestic lake whose surface is placid, there exists beneath the surface of this film depths far greater than what the senses can penetrate.  There is more to this story than what the film depicts, and that helplessness that you feel as a viewer also helps you to relate to the emotions of the main character, which are the highlight of this film.

Anyone who can't appreciate this film needs to come to terms with their own humanity.  Humanity is the only thing that makes this film worth watching, and if this film doesn't show anything that you can relate to, turn off the computer, turn off your cell phone, step outside, and go for a walk.  Get lost somewhere and find yourself.",1243296000,13,1439,4.759036144578313
2423069,5,B000BKVROC,"A haunting and mysterious film that begs to be watched more than once. The movie deals with a childless couple on a pilgrimage to a saint's shrine, who spend some time  in a remote village devoid of adult males after their car breaks down. The woman ends up taking over the village's one room school while the teacher ( the only resident adult male in the village )goes off to help her husband repair the car, and the interaction between her and the children is priceless.

The first time I watched this, I would have rated it 3 stars like the other reviewer. But every time I watch it I like it more. ( It has the same subtle power as The Band's Visit). The location is almost otherworldly, and the events hover between the real and the absurd in a way very specific to Iranian cinema (Blackboards, Secret Ballot, Marooned in Iraq, Turtles Can Fly, Iron Island et al.)

In the end, I find the film magical and compelling. I lent it to several friends, all of whom watched it more than once for the same reasons...",1231632000,23,1014,4.382978723404255

8088172,5,B000BKVROC,"Last night my wife and I had the pleasure of watching this gem of a movie. Please trust the editorial reviews and the 5-star reviews.  The negative reviews are by people who didn't get it at all; these poor naysayers have my sympathy for missing out on the richness that the film offers, and because of what they probably perceive as an ""inconclusive"" ending, but they are doing a disservice by lowering the film's overall rating.

The three main characters are (1) a photographer who is ion a quest to take a prize winning, highly marketable photograph, (2) his depressed ex-school teacher wife who feels like a failure because she hasn't been able to have children, (3) a village school teacher and local mechanic who is gradually revealed to be a delightfully charismatic character.  The photographer and his wife have become lost on a country road while driving to a pilgrimage site when their car breaks down. They seek out the local schoolteacher/mechanic who has to abandon his class for a day while he goes to town to buy a replacement part for the couple's car.  The ex-school teacher wife offers to take over the one-room school for the day.  The children's reaction is WHAT?  A WOMAN FOR A SCHOOL TEACHER?

The birth of a lamb lets the local women recognize that the photographer's wife has not been able to bear a child, and they warmly accept and support her (in stark contrast to the constant humiliation that her city neighbor subjects her to).  The next day the photographer and the teacher return with the replacement car part and the car gets repaired.  The photographer and his wife begin to leave the village, but the local children (who have already grown to love the woman)  run after the car.  The final scene has the woman trying to decide whether to continue the trip with her husband and eventually go back to the city, or stay in this desolate village where in a single day she has become accepted, valured, and loved by the whole community.

The director presents the viewer a wonderful gift by not revealing the moan's choice. Rather, the viewer is required to think about which option the woman will choose, and why. The cinematographer, in one of the most eloquent shots that I have ever seen, has already revealed what the ending will be (although the viewer doesn't yet have all the details). The village is located in the ruins of an ancient fortress.  When the woman first enters the village/fortress she walks through an arched passageway,  While I was appreciating the visual aspect of this shot, I was overcome by a powerful sense that she was being born into a new life.  What a beautiful, powerful shot!",1457740800,,2643,4.702819956616052
