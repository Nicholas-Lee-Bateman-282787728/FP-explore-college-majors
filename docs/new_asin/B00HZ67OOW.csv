6243865,5,B00HZ67OOW,"Excellent Rockumentary of a true star that shined in the other sex. True talent that shined like no other drag artist in history & weight didn't even matter, how cool is that.",1397174400,,175,4.5

6243867,5,B00HZ67OOW,"I'll caveat this review with a quick story - back in the stone age when I was attending  college in Boston I would work during the summer in Province Town MA. One lucky break back in 1978 I got a job working stage crew for Divine. Of course at this time I was unaware of her soon to be iconic status - it was the time right before her music went platinum in Europe and soon to follow was Divines off Broadway show Neon Woman.

Over the years I've collected much memorabilia relating to Divine and all the Dream Landers. Although the two books about Divine ""Not Simply Divine"" and the one by her now late Mom ""My Son divine""' are wonderful - nothing pays the long over due tribute to this amazing talent and gentle soul as the documentary ""I am Divine""

Full of fabulous footage from when John Waters and Glen were kids in high school. Their ever growing notorious band of eclectic cast outs who found support and true friends under the watchful eye and constantly rolling camera of John Waters.

What makes the film work so well, is seeing the progression of Glenn from the obese and bullied young kid to her early drag personas and finally to her embrace of the never to be repeated, one of a kind super star ~ Divine.

What director Jeffrey Shwarz does is take on us a journey of self discovery and personal growth. He weaves a tapestry of deep connections forged over decades and he does it with grace and style. Some highlights of the film are seeing so many of the old crew, Mink Stole, Tab Hunter, Ricki Lake, The wonderful Holly Woodlawn and so any others who worked with and loved Divine. Although I was surprised and disappointed that Jean Hill was nowhere to be seen.

This is an important film - more than just a story of a fierce, over the top entertainer this is a story about surviving abuse and coming into your own. At the time ""bullying"" was ignored and I think Jeffrey Shwarz summed it up beautifully.

""Like the John Waters protagonists he portrayed in numerous films, Divine was the ultimate outsider. Spitting in the face of the status quos of body image, gender identity, sexuality, and preconceived notions of beauty, Divine still succeeded in becoming an internationally recognized recording artist and screen icon. He gives courage to anyone who's ever been mocked, ridiculed, and ostracized, and gives us all hope that anything's possible.""

Or as John Waters said in a recent interview ""Everyone messed with Glenn - no one hassled Divine""

A must for any Divine fan or even those who may not be familiar with this gone to soon cult legend.",1396828800,28,2566,4.54880694143167
6243868,2,B00HZ67OOW,"I rented this film after reading good reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.  It was interesting to me but basically felt like a boring bio pic.  There are a series of interviews from many of Divine's old friends which was interesting.  It was fun to see pictures of a young John Waters and Divine but the film is more of a retrospect of his work than anything else. The movie felt like a let down from an outrageous performer it was about.  Nothing about this movie was outrageous or innovative.  It was just okay.
If you are interested in Divine you might enjoy it but don't expect anything edgy or shocking.",1396742400,4,599,4.458715596330276

It was great the interviews were not limited to the Dreamlanders, but also included Cockettes, and Frances Milstead, Glenn's mom. Another interesting aspect was the amount of information on David Lochary, a fascinating character and a close friend. Overall it's a great tribute to the fine actor and outrageous performer. It made me think once again how unfortunate and premature was his death, especially after he finally made it into the mainstream and was given a part in Married... with Children.",1458604800,,637,5.134615384615385

6243897,4,B00HZ67OOW,"I have been a fan of John Waters's for a long time, and when you say his name you automatically think of his Dreamland star of stars, Divine.  Born Glen Milsted in Baltimore, Glen was a kid who wasn't like other boys growing up, and then one day he met a neighborhood friend by name of John Waters who would launch him into stardom.  Living a life of craziness and exotic twists that would stretch across many continents and filled with heady glam, Glen became Divine and starred in all of John's early movies before he and the Dreamlanders were launched into mainstream recognition with Hairspray.  In some ways, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to any of them, but also the worst.

What this documentary tells us that many seem to oversee is the personal struggle of many gay people.  Divine himself did not speak to his family for many years, went to and forth between many relationships, and seemed to be always on the edge of bankruptcy thanks to his free wheeling lifestyle.  He starred in John Waters's early films, recorded disco albums, and did the drag circuit all across America.  Yet, he was unhappy that he had become a prisoner of the pink sequined tube dress.  He was very unhappy since he was a kid and took out his sadness in food, and his weight ballooned.  He made it work for him, but he couldn't have been happy deep within.  And then just when he was about to break into mainstream acting, it all came to a screeching halt.  He was so excited to have been cast in a male role in an episode of Married ... With Children and wouldn't have to be confined to doing the drag scene anymore.  The night before they were to tape the show, Divine would die in his sleep of a heart attack.  His story lives on as the one who ALMOST made it when fate intervened and took it from him.  Still, this was a fun look at Divine and his legacy of what he left us in the John Waters movies.",1418083200,,1907,4.335211267605634

This is one documentary in which the lead character came alive for me.  After Divine was gone, Kathleen Turner was chosen for a role DYING for Divine -as good as Turner is - and she is very good - Divine would have played that part into the stratosphere.

6243919,5,B00HZ67OOW,"Had heard of this documentary when it was first released and hoped to see it in local theaters, but it never arrived.  Decided to stream it today, and the friend I watched it with and I enjoyed it thoroughly--although it would've also been fun to see it with a big audience of Divine and John Waters fans in a movie theater.  Tons of footage and photos I'd never seen before--and I've been around a long time, and been a Divine and John Waters fan since first seeing Waters' films all those years ago.  Interviews with everyone from Waters to Mink Stole to Divine's Mom and personal assistant make you feel like you're getting a thorough and varied perspective of Divine's life.  It's got all the hilarious raunch you'd expect intact, but also has a sweet heart at its core, just as Divine seemed to have.  Entertaining, touching, funny, heartbreaking--just like Divine's life, which was cut short way too soon.  Highly recommended for Divine and John Waters fans, but also for anyone interested in singular personalities who live their lives their own way.",1406073600,,1057,4.78021978021978
6243920,5,B00HZ67OOW,"I have always loved the oversized look and personality of Divine.  This documentary is such a wonderful tribute to Divine, his life and work.  There are great interviews with John Waters and many of the early Dreamland Pictures gang including Mary Vivian Pearce, Susan Lowe, and the late Van Smith (the phenomenal costume and makeup designer for Waters' early films and the creator of Divine's signature looks), as well as other pop culture luminaries including Warhol pal Holly Woodlawn.  There are also extensive interviews with Divine's mother, Frances Milstead.  This documentary is definitely a positive homage and strays away from any deep discussion of the relationship between Divine and his manager Bernard Jay, whose book Not Simply Divine is somewhat controversial for its portrayal of the star.  Although one could argue that this film views the star with fairly rose-colored glasses, it is still a multifaceted look at Divine, the early films that made him a star, his career as a disco singer, and his early death just as he was set to report to work on the set of Married With Children.  Very Highly recommended; for those who would like more coverage of Waters' films, I also recommend the documentary Divine Filth (there is even a clip or two from that documentary in this film!).",1405814400,,1297,4.981481481481482

I was in my teens when I first saw some of John Water's movies starring Divine and I remember how many of my fellow teenagers were shocked but also amazed and drawn in by his character.
Moving past Pink Flamingos Divine went onto better roles and began to move away from drag characters and everyone supported him in doing so. He had too much talent to need to hide behind a costume that masked his true character from his fans and admirers.
I feel fortunate to have been alive when he and John Waters were, their movies were bizarre, shocking but one hell of a lot of fun!

6243938,4,B00HZ67OOW,"I've bought every book and film ever released by or about John Waters and Divine, so I wasn't expecting much in the way of unseen vintage material. Some of the vintage interviews presented here were made available in 2005 on the bonus disc included in the ""Very Crudely Yours"" box set. The ""Hairspray"" era footage from ""The Larry King Show"" was new to me.

There is some never-before-seen, behind-the-scenes footage in this film from ""Female Trouble"", ""Multiple Maniacs"", ""Lust In The Dust"" and ""Hairspray"" as well as unpublished photos of John and Divine in their younger days.

The film chronicles the transformation of young Harris Glenn Milstead from chubby, friendless schoolboy to the outrageous, overweight foul-mouthed underground superstar Divine with interviews from his mother Frances, fellow Dreamlanders Mink Stole, Mary Vivian Pierce, Susan Lowe, George Figgs, Pat Moran and Vince Peranio. We also hear from Glenn's high-school ""sweetheart"", Ricki Lake, Holly Woodlawn, Tab Hunter, Mary Garlington (!) (""Lulu"" from ""Polyester""), members of The Cockettes, co-stars from ""Women Behind Bars"" and ""The Neon Woman"". It is the comments from the non-Dreamlanders here that give the most new insight into Divine the person.

There are many performance clips from Divine's recording-star days in the '80s (albeit very short clips) that are interesting to see. (In one performance of ""I'm So Beautiful"" he seems particularly lethargic).

If you're a super-fan, there isn't a whole lot here you won't already know, but those less-seasoned fans who are seeking an intimate portrait that covers all the important bases, you can't go wrong.

6243942,4,B00HZ67OOW,"I've been a John Waters/ Divine fan for almost 40 years now. I went to see this film at the Huntington art cinema during the Gay film festival. When the film was over i left the theater a little depressed. Divines career was just about to take off when he died of a heart attack at the age of 42. He was cast in the T.V show Married with children and would have, most likely, become a household word. Divines music career was so-so but i enjoyed his outrageous stage performances. Even though Divines (Glenn Milstead) life was a hard and difficult one, his life story is an inspirational one. His dream of stardom was about to come true when he suddenly died. This is another story of how show business people kill themselves off too early because of their lifestyle. I met John Waters(director who discovered Divine) at a book signing in Manhattan and told him that Female Trouble was my favorite comedy of all time. His response to me was that,"" i should practice the script in front of the mirror"". He may have thought i was an actor looking for a break. Since meeting John Waters i have to say his current movies are so LAME compared to Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble and Polyester. Without Divine, John Waters is all washed up. If Hairspray was his biggest hit, then i wouldn't be a fan at all. The play, ""hairspray"" stunk in my opinion and the movie with John Travolta stunk as well. John Waters days of filming a movie with an 8mm camera are over and so is rest of his career in my opinion. I read some of his books and they are funny in some spots but John Waters comes off as a typical ugly bitter queen. An intelligent, creative director who made groundbreaking independent movies in the early 70's and that's where it ends. When John Waters went mainstream he lost me as a big fan, but i will always love him for bringing Pink Flamingos and Female Trouble to the screen.",1401321600,,1881,4.408045977011494

6243949,5,B00HZ67OOW,"This provided me with so much insight into a legend who was taken from us far too soon. Wonder what he would think of how he is so fondly remembered now? From his humble beginnings in Baltimore to the height of his career in Hollywood, Divine crossed boundaries not only as a man performing as a woman, but as someone who was not a rail-thin wisp. He broke all the rules and we love him for it!",1399766400,,394,4.12987012987013

6243953,4,B00HZ67OOW,"I thought the documentary was very good, taking us from Divine's early days with John Waters into famous period, years later. My only criticism is that the film could have used a lot more clips from his movies. The viewer really didn't get a sense of how outrageous Divine's acting was except for the narration about it.",1399334400,3,320,4.631578947368421

6243956,3,B00HZ67OOW,"Maybe I need to give it a 2nd viewing because I just wasn't too impressed with my initial screening. It was a little somber as some have mention. But it. Could be that I wasn't completely present, so it deserves one more try. If not, its a rather expensive investment on something that may soon be offered as a Prime Instant Video catalog piece.",1398124800,,345,4.40625
6243957,5,B00HZ67OOW,"I Am Divine is a documentary about Glenn Milstead, known professionally as Divine. The film traces his humble beginnings as an overweight, teased Baltimore kid, to his fame as an internationally recognized drag superstar. Included are interviews with several key figures in his life, including filmmaker John Waters (Pink Flamingos, Hairspray), co-stars Ricki Lake (Hairspray), Tab Hunter (Polyester), and Mink Stole (Female Trouble), and his mother.

Milsteads collaborations with Waters anti-establishment form of indie filmmaking attacked head-on Hollywoods long-held tradition of body image, gender identity, sexuality and notions of beauty. Divine was the ultimate outsider turned underground royalty, blurring the line between performer and personality. The film is a warm, affectionate look at this unique performer, showing us the humanity behind the bizarre public persona.

The only bonus feature is commentary by director Jeffrey Schwarz.",1397865600,3,949,6.022222222222222

6243960,5,B00HZ67OOW,"SPOILERS! I wrote this in response to a post on my Facebook, which was a reply to my original FB post about this bittersweet film:
Because biographies and autobiographies are not simple entertainment. This is the story of a man that morphed into an uber-counter culture phenomenon almost full circle back into the mainstream without mimicking the staid, puritanical format of mainstream,typical American entertainment. And the fact that he died the night before he was to begin playing a regular character on the not so ""above-board"" sit-com ""Married With Children"", one of the first American TV comedies that dared challenge the concept of comedy in a publicly accessible format (meaning not on cable) and the journey he took to get to that point, would have been a significant achievement. But more than the ironic timing of his death was his transformation, one that connected all the sub- and counter-culture movements starting with the beatniks and hippies to feminist and radical queer cultures-and to imagine that it almost invaded the mainstream is to witness this fascinating progression that could have been the jolt that cracked open the American sub-conscience to the great diversity that was thriving just below the surface of the mainstream. Glenn ""Divine"" Milstead on ""Married With Children"" would have injected this concept directly into the vein of the mainstream. He would have paved the way for the likes of ""Will & Grace"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"". He lived a once in a lifetime life. ""I Am Divine"" is required viewing.",1397260800,8,1538,5.131474103585657

You really get a 360 degree view of Glenn Milstead with moving and honest interviews and insights from his friends and colleagues and, not least, his devoted mum. It is a tribute, but it is more than a tribute because you get a feeling for a broad swathe of American youth culture, especially in the underground scene of New York, from the 1970s onwards. It's a good feeling and this is a lovely movie that adds so much to his films of which Polyester, Lust in the Dust and Hairspray stand proudly on my shelf.",1493769600,,580,4.429906542056075
