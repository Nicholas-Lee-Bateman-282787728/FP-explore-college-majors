6824709,5,B00PV3FVUA,"Classical music's larger-than-life Rebel composed the ultimate Protest song.
In 1824.
Who knew???

Chilean protests under Pinochets dictatorship, the Tiananmen Square student protest, Japan rebuilding after WW2 and again after the Fukushima earthquake, and the fall of the Berlin Wall - all were played out with the music of Beethovens Ninth symphony in a central role.

This movie reveals the Ninth as a catalyst - arising spontaneously at those dark moments in history when souls need uplifting, and in their voices expressing its music, peoples across the world become united in their dreams of Freedom.

Surprising and inspiring, Director Kerry Candaele has crafted a beautiful film presenting evidence that supports Beethoven's message in the Ninth; that All Men are Brothers.

See the film, and feel yourself become a Citizen of the World.

6824711,5,B00PV3FVUA,"Beethovens Ninth is literally a character in this film.  It graciously and violently guides us through some of the most tumultuous and heart-wrenching episodes of recent human history.

6824712,5,B00PV3FVUA,"I count myself as one of the lucky ones who saw this film on the big screen.  Not oncetwice.

Having listened to The Ninth' in the comfort of my home did not prepare me for what I saw :  the power it gave to the oppressed, and the respect it receives from a country that begins teaching it to its children and performs it nationwide in choirs of over 5,000.

The first time I saw the film I had little idea of what I would be witnessing. I love Beethoven and it would have been enough to hear it performed.
But what I experienced left me stunned in my seat long after the film ended.

Across continents, this masterpiece was present in huge historic eventsand in cases helped some survive unbearable circumstances.
My awareness of important details in world events has expandedmy admiration for peoples strength and courage can not even be described and my love for this magnificent gift from a deaf composer has quadrupled.

Our children here do not receive the appreciation for music in their education. This film will be my gift to every teenager and adult in my family.  My THANKS to  Kerry Candaele for bringing this to us.",1416528000,16,1128,4.522167487684729

I am a composer and naturally thought about the Ninth symphony of Beethoven in a musical context. Kerry's discoveries are much more encompassing which makes the film as large and exciting as the genius of Beethoven deserves.

6824723,5,B00PV3FVUA,"I was fortunate to see Following the Ninth in a theater in New York City. But it is well worth seeing any way that you are able to. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is an amazing piece of music. Every year the classical music station in NYC, WQXR, does a New Years Eve countdown of the top 100 requests from listeners, and for the past couple of years Beethoven's Ninth has been No. 1 every time. In the film musicians talk about the music and people talk about what the music means to them. It is wonderful to see how people from all over the world have embraced the Ninth. There are segments on Tienanmen Square, Pinochet's Chile, the Berlin Wall, and a Japanese tradition of having choral groups sing the ""Ode to Joy"" portion every December. I had a couple of teary moments watching the film; no surprise, really, as I cry whenever I hear the ""Ode to Joy,"" because it is so beautiful and so powerful. I always think of Beethoven, and wonder if he ""heard"" the music in his head while he was writing it, and if he did, if it was anything like the reality of the performance of it. Seeing ""Following the Ninth"" made me appreciate the music even more.",1433289600,,1144,4.375586854460094

Whether student protesters in China, political dissidents in Chile, children in London, or tsunami survivors in Japan, this moving and lyrical film follows the many ways that Beethoven's Ninth Symphony has brought hope, comfort and solidarity to people around the world.

6824727,5,B00PV3FVUA,"This documentary lays out the history of the Ninth Symphony providing strength and inspiration for peace and justice struggles in many locations, often difficult, dangerous ones. There is no other music that so embodies unity and integrity, and is so anti-thetical to war, killing, hatred, and destruction of all kinds. Moreover, the Ode to Joy uplifting and accessible for everyone (including anyone with a harmonica).

Based on this film, the Ninth and it's Ode to Joy could help universalize and vitalize anti-war and environmental movements all over the globe.",1428883200,,564,5.337078651685394
6824728,5,B00PV3FVUA,"This is a must-see film for dedicated Beethoven fans as well as those to who are aware of the need for socio-political change around the globe.  It follows Beethoven's Ninth Symphony as it becomes the voice of the downtrodden in Chile, China, Germany and elsewhere.  It is an inspiring symphony and this is an inspiring film. Few people know that Beethoven actually experienced the violence of war and the tyranny of a police state for virtually his entire life.  He knew about human suffering, as well as the experience of transcendence through such suffering.  This film beautifully demonstrates that  Beethoven's symphonic call for ""brotherhood and freedom"" remains loud and clear almost 200 years after his death, just as he intended.

This is a magical, marvelous, overwhelming moving documentary on the power of music and how it can move one person and a society to do powerful, wonderful things. My husband and I watched it with our 10YO daughter and 12YO son, and while they already knew how much this piece of music meant to me, the history and power it has on people was so powerfully told by this film. What a great documentary - and the accompanying book is equally well done. Bravo to all who worked on getting this done and getting these stories told!",1428537600,3,588,4.3545454545454545

6824732,4,B00PV3FVUA,"This is more -- or perhaps less -- than an homage to Beethoven's Ninth.  It is a documentary made up of intertwining threads, all with the common factor that in some way Beethoven's Ninth Symphony was part of each thread.  From a South American revolution to one in China, from a girl growing up in a still walled-in Berlin to Beethoven himself, the Ninth is a moment of great import.

Sometimes, the stretch is a bit too thinly drawn, too artificial -- but I admit the connection is there.  It is because of this contestable tenuousness that I gave this movie a 4 instead of a 5.  It just doesn't make the ""great"" category.  But it is still moving and engrossing -- I recommend it strongly.",1425168000,,691,4.444444444444445
6824733,5,B00PV3FVUA,"The Civil Rights Movement in America had ""We Shall Overcome"" and other great songs that fifty years later still evoke and sustain our emotional commitment to that historical struggle for justice.

6824734,5,B00PV3FVUA,"Its kinda rare, I think, when a movie exceeds incredibly high expectations. Ive been wanting to see Following the Ninth since I first heard about it over a year ago. I finally got to see it last night and its remarkable. Thats not only because it has the greatest soundtrack of any movie ever, periodBeethovens Ninthbut because it highlights the symphonys place as an inspiration for revolution (its what the students at Tiananmen Square played on loudspeakers), a balm for many cultures (current-day Japan, jailed Chilean protestors under Pinochet) and, my favorite part, what it meant to residents when the Berlin Wall fell. I wept copiously through the filmfor which I blame Kerry Candaele, who made the damn thing. Now go see this. And listen to the Ninth. Then listen to it again.",1423612800,,785,4.909774436090226

6824736,5,B00PV3FVUA,Superb film!,1423094400,,12,5.5
6824737,5,B00PV3FVUA,"Sometimes, being blindsided is a wonderful thing. Having cut my teeth on the music of Doors and the Beatles 50 years ago, I was not terribly interested in ""classical"" music. Yet when the Ninth came on the car radio late one night, I damn near drove off the road during the final movement, and frankly wouldn't have cared much if I had. The music had completely overwhelmed me, knocked me right out of my smug disdain of anything that required a man waving a baton to play, and sent me reeling with a rush of something akin to complete bliss.  To call this first encounter a ""spiritual"" or ""revelatory"" experience would be to shortchange it.  The door had been kicked open by this one encounter with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, and the light had come pouring in.

Without abandoning my love of rock (and most other forms of popular contemporary music), I immersed myself in Beethoven, always returning to the Ninth and the handful of quartets he produced during his final years, when he was completely deaf.  Yet studying this sublime music -- even taking music classes to try and learn the magic behind the harmonies -- didn't provide the same peak experience as that initial encounter.

Now, thanks to Kerry Candaele's wonderful film, I think I know why: what was missing from such studies was the much-needed ""human factor.""  This is what gives this symphony such power -- the music lives in each of us, in much the same way that we speak of the ""human spirit"" or ""the brotherhood of man.""  And that's where ""Following the Ninth"" really excels -- it takes this music, which most people probably consider a musty old museum piece, and reminds us that it still has the power to connect with our deepest yearnings and transform us in new and radically exciting ways.

Just one of the remarkable things about this film, though, is that it achieves this feat in such a seemingly simple way.  We are not bombarded with high-minded analyses by esteemed musicologists.  (OK, there are a couple, but Benjamin Zander is one, and he's always great fun.)  Instead, the film focuses on real people, folks who have struggled against great forces of darkness, or who are searching for some sort of meaningful re-connection with those around them.  They've been imprisoned and tortured for political dissent. They've risen up against repressive governments in soul-stirring efforts to break down walls and enjoy freedom.  Or, they've collectively realized a sense of abandonment in our modern world, abandonment of the noble aspirations for brotherhood or personal liberation that the animates the Ninth.

And in the end, thanks in part to this music, they've been deeply rewarded by Beethoven's still-relevant symphony.  For some, the Ninth has been nothing less than a means to salvation, while for others participating in this music has ennobled them by its timeless -- and timely -- message of hope.

Kerry Candaele's ""Following the Ninth"" reminds us of all of this, and more. For in our own small ways we, too, are much like the people we meet in the film. We yearn for the same freedoms, the same connectedness, and the same ability to transcend our dark hours and flood ourselves with the light of pure joy.  As Candaele demonstrates, if we're lucky enough to really listen to Beethoven's Ninth with fresh ears, we can find what we're looking for.

This is one of those very rare films that you just have to see to believe.",1422489600,6,3416,4.81025641025641
6824738,5,B00PV3FVUA,There are no words to describe the effect Beethoven's music in my soul and mind! I remember coming across a preview of this documentary back in 2008 in YouTube and I was so excited that ever since I was occasionally checking on the release date. It was only until the April of 2014 (!!) I accidentally heard that not only it was finally out but also a (unique) performance was scheduled in a theater nearby the day after! The documentary is superb!!! Kerry Candaele has done an excellent job!,1422489600,,492,4.53932584269663
6824739,5,B00PV3FVUA,"If this collection of rag-tag warring tribes we laughingly call a civilisation ever manages to escape its self-created conflicts we might recognise Beethoven's Ninth as a significant milestone in our spiritual development and as a work - a masterpiece - that transcended all barriers. If we don't make it and we wipe ourselves off the planet then this symphony may well have been the pinnacle of human achievement.

Kerry Candaele encapsulates why this is so. The film shows how and why this magnificent music has been adopted and harnessed for good all over the world. It shows that great music has the power to inspire and give solace and help us hold on to the belief that we can overcome anything that oppresses us or threatens our spirit. It unites us in a common awareness of the best of humanity and reminds us that all men truly are brothers.",1422144000,,850,4.704697986577181
6824740,5,B00PV3FVUA,"I cannot say enough about how wonderful this DVD is---inspirational, transformational.  Whenever you are down and need something to lift your spirit, here it is.  From the little girl putting a coin in the recipient next to the bass player in Catalua in a solo that swells to an unbelievable performance in front of the backdrop of the wondrous faces of the locals, to the hundreds even thousands of voices in Japan to the group from Hart Music school in Hartford, the experience is incredible.  The music that is so ethereal grounded in those who perform it and those who watch with awe--all are transformed.  This is truly the greatest homage to Beethoven ever.  A wonderful concept and excellent rendering.",1421452800,,709,4.875

Having a good sound system and large screen really gave the film greater impact,  although with a good sound system and decent size screen this film plays well at home. If you don't get teary eyed at some point during the film,,,something is wrong with your tear ducts!! I found the segments on Chile's revolution and repression especially moving. Beethoven would be happy to know his work has inspired freedom seekers around the world and still does today.

However, I came across this film hoping to find an effective way to teach my Humanities students about Beethoven, his final symphony, and the humanity of music. The stories told in the film allow for a wonderful discussion about the structure and music of the Ninth Symphony. But it does so while keeping the human story of hope, struggle, fear, triumph, ... front and center. It is a ""gem"" of a film to treasure.",1419984000,2,531,4.541666666666667

6824748,5,B00PV3FVUA,"Kerry Candele's Following the Ninth is an amazing film. I respond strongly and positively to Beethoven, so when I heard about it I was eager to see it. It played at one of the small art theaters in Santa Fe. Joan and I went to the first performance on a Friday evening, enjoyed it so much that we went again to the second performance the following evening. There were not many people there on either occasion, and I assumed that like many documentaries it would be gone in a week or two. I was wrong. The film started to attract more and more people. Word of mouth led to its unexpected popularity. When it closed five or six weeks later, it had had full houses for the last week or two. I have spoken to no one who did not enjoy it.

The chief reason for its success is, I think, that its message of freedom and hope spoke to many of the people who attended. Setting different sections dealing with the huge popularity of Beethoven's  Ninth in Chile during the Pinochet dictatorship, in Tiannamen Square in China, and in East Germany before the Wall came down made its message appeal to people in other countries as well. In Japan participating in a performance of the Ninth around the new year has become a Japanese ritual, preparations for which go on throughout the year. The Ninth's theme of freedom makes its appeal virtually universal.

Also, Following the Ninth had a particular focus: the symphony's theme of freedom makes its appeal virtually universal.  The impact of the choral last movement of the symphony, with its message of hope and its rousing music, heightened the urge to freedom in the countries mentioned and gave courage to those who were fighting for freedom.. It's a magnificent story, and Kerry Candaele tells it well. He went to all the countries he chose and filmed the people there on the spot. His choice of individuals was brilliantly effective, and the film left all who watched it very much moved.",1419120000,,1930,4.601744186046512

First and foremost the wonder of what Beethoven has left humanity.  Followed closely by the mans potential  for such inhumanity to fellow citizens.  I am sure Beethoven would be pleased with some of the progress the world has made in 200 years but equally disappointed with some of the missteps. You need not be a close follower of Beethoven's music or classical music to appreciate the film.  By all means check it out.,1418601600,,579,4.509615384615385

6824755,5,B00PV3FVUA,"Tienanmen Square, the Berlin Wall, Pinochet's Chile and thousands of Japanese people singing in German every Christmas.  Not your average inspiration for a documentary.

But when Kerry Candaele discovered his obsession with Beethoven's 9th Symphony, he found out he wasn't alone.  ""Following the Ninth: In The Footsteps of Beethoven's Final Symphony"" artfully demonstrates the celebratory power of Beethoven's ode to best in our humanity - especially when it's being brutally suppressed - but also when it needs to be joyfully expressed.

The individual stories of struggle and fear, hopelessness and bravery, the darkest hours and the sweetness of life are told here with Beethoven lighting the way.  Kerry and his production team have brilliantly illustrated why Ludwig Van's epic is a landmark work of art and how it became a touchstone for those who would have lost hope without it.

Along with egg nog, listening to the Chieftains ""The Bells of Dublin"" and wondering where all my money went, watching ""Following the Ninth"" is going to be a Christmas holiday tradition - at least at my house ...

Beethoven's ninth Symphony is probably the most effective piece of music at changing the hearts and minds of humanity, and the film could not be more effective in capturing its message, and how this message has been appropriated to influence political forces.",1417132800,,476,5.611111111111111
6824762,5,B00PV3FVUA,"What an inspiring, uplifting and beautiful film!  Kerry Candaele has managed to take what is already perhaps the worlds most beloved musical work and show its power and universality to us again in an entirely new way.  I already had the highest regard for the Ninth  for forty years Ive kept an unopened vinyl LP of Karajans 1962 recording to be played either when the world is finally at peace or is coming to an end (assuming I can find a turntable).  But Following the Ninth gave me an entirely new perspective on it.  The film weaves together half a dozen gripping and moving stories showing how the Ninth has energized, consoled, invigorated, and inspired victims of tyranny and oppression around the world, how it animates ordinary people to do truly extraordinary things in the name of beauty, and how it continues to thrill and ennoble us all two centuries after it was composed.  I was lucky enough to see it in the theater, and am betting my Christmas money itll be just as amazing on DVD.  If you're on my Santas list therell be one in your stocking.",1416960000,,1061,4.582010582010582
6824763,5,B00PV3FVUA,"Rarely do documentaries come along with the potential to inspire the whole world, despite language and cultural barriers.  This film, along with Beethoven's epic work, have the capacity to accomplish that vision.  One of the best and most interesting documentaries ever made about such an iconic, inspirational, historic, and deeply moving piece of music.",1416787200,,355,5.555555555555555
6824764,5,B00PV3FVUA,"I've seen this film multiple times and am still daunted by the intricacy of its weave among information, motivation, unity in diversity, and artistic composition for its own sake. The quest of our times lies in reconciling the individual and collective, personal and universal, the divine and the vulnerably human. Transcending religious systems altogether, Kerry touches the heart of universal spirituality through art, and names/frames/claims it as sustainable energy that fuels our inner and outer courage to evolve civilizations.",1416787200,2,533,5.7594936708860756
6824765,5,B00PV3FVUA,"This film is a reminder of why music is important in our society, not just as an entertainment mechanism, but as a meaningful pillar in our global fight against injustice. I had the pleasure of seeing it screened in Wichita, and it captivated a full house. Bravo!",1416787200,,263,4.617021276595745
6824766,5,B00PV3FVUA,"Following the Ninth i s a fantastic narrative, auditory and visual experience.  It is finally about the passion of the revolutionary all over the world and I was moved and enlivened by watching it.

Aside from everything else, it tells great stories!",1416700800,,250,4.928571428571429
6824767,5,B00PV3FVUA,"This film provides wonderful personal narratives from the inside of large historical events of the 20th century: the fall of the Berlin Wall, Tiananmen Square, and the overthrow of Salvador Allende in Chile. And the film weaves in the ways in which the beauty and power of Beethoven's 9th played a galvanizing supporting role in each of these events.

World-changing events have a way of distilling the best in human nature. This film does a remarkable job of capturing the force and feeling of the people who worked to lift that weight and the soundtrack that helped inspire them.

Maybe that sounds kind of dry and academic, but it's not. You'll be moved and enlightened. See it!",1416700800,,681,4.811965811965812

6824769,5,B00PV3FVUA,"If by chance you have gone about your daily business on this planet and have not yet had the pleasure of discovering a great piece of music like Ludvig Von Beethoven's  Ninth Symphony. this perhaps might be a good place to start.
If, as well you keep your musical appreciation in the back round, as some sound instead of no sound, without delving deeper into what  might be back there; those odd sounds that your fellow human beings have struggled to express into a mix of many emotions or to tell miriad stories, this film could be an ear/eye/heart opener.
Kerry Candaele's Following the Ninth is a gorgeous montage that attests to the unifying power that music can offer not only to those in truly dire and un-livable situations; as a tortured prisoner in Pinochet's Chile, or a student staring down the barrel of a tank in Tiananmen Square, but to all humanity on this raging orb we can only call home.  Music is ground out from the personal, as words are, or as any art is, and streams into the world to create it's beautiful havoc; to say the things that could not be said, to show the fleeting moments that were missed, to be witness to a strange and wondrous experience that it is to be here shared by all of us.  Director Kerry Candaele has captured this moment , the personal and the grandiose, truly a visionary documentary film.",1416614400,,1339,4.520661157024794
6824770,5,B00PV3FVUA,"""Following the Ninth"" is a beautifully conceived and magnificently realized documentary showing how music unites us world-wide. It is emotionally moving and very powerful. From Chilean demonstrators to a Chinese student organizer who broadcast it at Tiananmen Square, to an East Berliner who heard the concert conducted by Leonard Bernstein after the Wall was dismantled. Played by major world city symphonies to small African village orchestras, they all embrace the power and the message of the music.",1416614400,,503,5.545454545454546
6824771,5,B00PV3FVUA,"Among the most luminous and moving films I've seen in years.  Reminiscent of Godfrey Reggio's KOYAANISQATSI, Kerry Candaele's FOLLOWING THE NINTH is a dreamlike meditation on the power of great music, and indeed great art to transcend boundaries - political, cultural, emotional.  As Beethoven's resplendent creation continues to amaze and transform, Candaele's bravura vision is a stirring evocation of the composer's final wish that all humankind be united.",1416614400,5,459,5.735294117647059
6824772,5,B00PV3FVUA,This is a fantastic film.  The focus on Beethoven's 9th as a a universally revered piece is moving and entertaining.  Kids whose music of choice is usually i-heart radio are engaged by the force of the mudic and drama of Beethoven's reach.,1416528000,2,239,4.666666666666667
8689450,5,B00PV3FVUA,"'Following the Ninth' succeeds because it intertwines worlds that would normally be considered separate, and demonstrates to us the true universal nature of human dignity and the expression of that through art.",1484956800,,210,5.59375
8689451,5,B00PV3FVUA,"What a great movie. Been wanting to see this since I'd seen a preview a couple years back, and so glad I finally did.

My kids weren't sure if they wanted to go to an upcoming production of the 9th this April. After this eye-opening, uplifting, life-affirming view into how much this ultimate musical expression has meant to humanity across time, geographies, cultures and politics, they're as excited now as I am to be able to offer them the opportunity.

Highly recommended.",1483747200,,476,4.7926829268292686

8689455,5,B00PV3FVUA,"Like Kerry Candaele and collaborator Greg Mitchell, I was struck by the power of Beethoven later in life. The piece that first grabbed me was Paul Robesons rendition of The Ode to Joy,  ""All Men Are Brothers,"" performed at his return to Carnegie Hall after having been blacklisted for many years. Seeking to learn more, I happened upon this film and the companion book, Journeys with Beethoven. (Both are excellent and present somewhat complementary views.) The film portrays the power of the Ninth, across cultures, to somehow give solace, hope, and inspiration. It portrays the human capacity to protest affronts to human rights and dignity with an insistent celebration of our highest ideals and the universal truth that all men are brothers. Ive donated a copy of the film to my local library system, which already owns several of Kerrys other excellent films.",1464825600,,864,5.041958041958042
