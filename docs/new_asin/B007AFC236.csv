8513350,4,B007AFC236,"I really only wanted phantoms (which was very hard to find at stores around town), but for the price, I would have paid that for 1 movie, so having 3 is a deal....",1390867200,3,163,3.9696969696969697
8513351,4,B007AFC236,"I loved the movie Phantoms and was sure I saw Darkness, but never watched Venom before.

The movies are on a single disc which means there are no special features. This did not take away from my enjoyment of watching a few supernatural thrillers.",1388880000,,246,4.590909090909091
8513352,4,B007AFC236,"All three are a cut above 'B' movies, some more than others.  Phantoms is an adaptation of a very good Dean Koontz novel with an 'A' cast including Ben Affleck and the legendary Peter O'toole.  If you've read the book then it will mean much more to you than having to stand on it's own two legs. The screenplay relies heavily upon the reader knowing the novel and that works against it as a stand alone film.  If you haven't read it you will have the impression that something is slightly askew and you're not being told everything and that Peter O'toole is slumming...but still you'll find excellent production values with a bang up ending and more than competent turns by every actor involved.  For the price it's worth the collection by itself to get the blu-ray transfer of this film(which looks and sounds very good indeed).  If by chance you have read the book then this movie is kick ass!!!

Venom is an atmospheric little teen horror flick with the likes of Jonathan Jackson and Agnes Bruckner involved in Voodoo curses in the Lousiana bayous.  It's tight and nerve wracking and the kids milk all the poison out of the plot they can.  It works and actually of the three films is the most coherent by itself.  If you're a fan of Voodoo flicks and teen slasher horror flicks in general and not, I repeat, NOT a member of AAA, then you'll love this foray into deep dark goings on. (you'll have to see to get that little attempt at humor).

Finally there is Darkness starring a great cast in a Spanish international production of a ultimately muddled yet eerily disturbing mash up of current horror trends. Having the cast really saves this film but the Director is to be commended for an attempt that just falls a hair short. Not because it isn't totally tense and frightening but because there isn't anything new here you haven't seen before.  However it held my interest until the very end.  Anna Paquin  (True Blood's Sookie Stackhouse) plays the teen thrust into the new surroundings who begins to suspect evil is afoot but it is her brother Paul (Stephan Enquist in his very first role with no previous experience at age 9) who sets the tone for the first half of this family returning to its rotten roots tale of demonic something or other (literally since I could never quite figure out what the spell being cast is to accomplish) and he does an absolutely outstanding job of acting.  The great Italian actor Giancarlo Giannini plays the Grandfather to great effect and the parents (Lena Olin and Iain Glen) give concise acting lessons in cause and effect of evil's influence along with Fele Martinez as Anna's boyfriend and Fermi Reixach as the Architect.  Wonderfully filmed and truly frightening at times (especially when the children are just standing around in the darkness)still it loses it's focus at the end and takes the easy way out.  Up til then it's modern Gothic at its best.

Gore is mostly absent from these horror films (well perhaps a teeny tiny bit in Phantoms and  quite a bit in Venom now that I think about it) and Darkness and Phantoms rely more on monsters and mayhem for their thrills.  So as I said...none of these movies is a 'B' film and only fall a hair short of being outstanding 'A' horror films.  The blu-ray transfers are clean and crisp in picture and audio (albiet no frills included) and at this price for all three that's a bargain even the Devil couldn't pass up!",1367452800,7,3412,4.599009900990099

8513354,4,B007AFC236,I have to admit I got the dvd version of Venom and Darkness on some movie horror collections...  and the Blu Ray versions are way better to behold.  Making this a darn good buy since it has 3 of them on it.  Worth getting for the price.,1364256000,2,236,3.978723404255319
8513355,5,B007AFC236,"I mainly ordered this blu-ray for the movie, ""Phantoms"", an excellent movie based on a novel by Dean Koontz, which was the book that got me hooked on the author.  ""Venom"" was also very good, but ""Darkness"" was not quite as good as I expected, though not bad enough to make me wish I had not bought the blu-ray.  I would have paid this price for just ""Phantoms"", but was lucky enough to get a total of 3 movies for the price of one.
I'd recommend this one to anyone who likes Dean Koontz, even if you don't care of the other two, this one's definitely worth the price.",1363046400,3,567,4.192660550458716
8513356,1,B007AFC236,"Three movies on 1 blu ray disc. That means no caption, nothing besides the movies. Also the blu ray quality is BELOW average, at most the regular DVD grade. Big Disappointment. 3 BAD MOVIES all failed on 1 disc.",1361145600,4,211,4.435897435897436
