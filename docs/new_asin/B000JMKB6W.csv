2678334,4,B000JMKB6W,"Four years after President Nixon's resignation, Sir David Frost interviewed him about his term in office.  The original interview  was five hours, aired over five nights. Although the Amazon. Com product description doesn't state it as so, this DVD is only highlights of the interview, focusing exclusively on the Watergate scandal.

The interview makes for compelling television. Sir David Frost's questions hit hard, President Nixon did not have the right to edit the interview,  nor did he know the questions in advance.

As such, emotions are raw, as President Nixon attempts to answer the questions as honestly as he is able. He quibbles with the legal language a bit, in the same way that President Clinton ""did not have sex with that woman"". But, otherwise, he tries to be understood and give his perspective.

At times, President Nixon's eyes nervously shift from side to side when asked difficult questions.  At other times, he looks down from the camera,  as his eyes fill with tears. President Nixon may not confess  guilt, but there is a peek deep into his mind and heart.

Because of my disappointment that the full interview is not available on DVD, it loses a star in my rating.  What can I tell you? I'm harsh.  But to not have the full interview available is frustrating.  By showing only selections, viewers' perspectives are slanted by the choice of footage, rather than seeing the full interview and arriving at their own conclusion. Admittedly, five hours may be too long for some,  but it should be offered as an alternative to only the highlights.

As an aside, the interview alone is insufficient to give a history of the Watergate scandal.  Without some background, it may also be a bit difficult to follow and, at least, not as compelling.

However, since this is the best we got, it's worth a viewing to better understand President Nixon and for a study of the human character in those honest moments captured during the interview.",1216684800,5,1958,4.867069486404834
2678335,4,B000JMKB6W,"Thirty years on and Frost's interview of Nixon is even more compelling.

It is as if every shot and every word had been scripted and directed. Nixon seems ill prepared for the depth of research and preparation evident in Frost questioning. This is drama at its best and its real. And Frost despite the affected, feined and sometimes breathy interview style actually pulls it off like no other.

What is it about Nixon's reflections on Watergate that now resonates so much with the style and nature of the political leadership that lead the shamefully described ""coalition of the willing""? Still they are blinded by power, still they are without integrity, still truth doesnt matter.

For political nutters, this is a must have DVD. It will sit alongside my autographed copy of Nixon's memoirs. I still wonder whether the signature is genuine. Doesnt that say it all.",1214179200,5,866,4.917808219178082
2678336,5,B000JMKB6W,"The recent success of the play ""Frost/Nixon"" on Broadway, with its Tony-winning performance by Frank Langella, has revived interest in its dramatic source: the exclusive interviews that a talk-show host then widely regarded as a lightweight scored with the former President of the United States, three years after his exit from office under a cloud of political scandal.

David Frost's interviews with ex-President of the United States Richard M. Nixon caused great excitement at the time of their first airing in 1977. This DVD makes available the most interesting of the segments, in which Frost confronts Nixon about his involvement in the Watergate scandal which had forced his resignation from the Presidency. Alternately ingratiating and truculent, Nixon vehemently denies that he committed any illegal act, even in the face of Frost's verbatim readings from the transcripts of the White House tapes that certainly suggest that the President condoned obstruction of justice, and payments of hush money to the perpetrators of the break-in to the Democratic Party's national headquarters.

Though the haggling over legalistic issues and exact meaning of words and phrases gets a bit tiresome early on, the later payoff is more than ample compensation, as Frost draws wrenching accounts from Nixon about firing his trusted aides, Haldeman and Ehrlichman, and, in the climactic last portion, elicits from the former President the admission that he ""let the American people down."" Seen in the light of the continued hubris of the present administration in the face of what to many are much greater transgressions, Nixon's contrition, veiled as it is, is extraordinary. This DVD brings back a fascinating chapter in American history. Framing interviews with Sir David Frost, reminiscing about the circumstances under which the interviews were arranged and executed, are a worthy bonus.",1186099200,20,1885,5.4300341296928325

Of course this was not actually the final chapter, as the years went by, a new perspective, a different moral was applied to the Watergate and to President Nixon's involvement in the matter, largely downplaying his wrongdoing to a much more innocent and candid level if compared to the standard that today apply to american and international politics.",1170720000,10,576,5.073684210526316

2678346,4,B000JMKB6W,"I am thrilled that this came out and I even pre-ordered it at the time.

But unless you are a history nerd, like I am, or just have a perverse sense of humor, like I do, this probably isn't your bag.

Also, do not expect the movie Frost/ Nixon. The reality is a little more dull and also a bit more interesting and a little less earth-shattering and certainly not of the historical import James Reston makes it out to be.

Frost knocks the hell out of him in the first interview. It is odd to see Nixon on the ropes and then using his ""Checkers voice"" to dig his way out of it. However, there are some interesting legal points Nixon makes about Watergate having to do with intent, presidential culpability in re lawbreaking, national security, and the difference of being in the middle of things v. making legal assumptions based upon the result or an historical timeline.

Where Nixon shines is in discussing history, world leaders, and foreign affairs. This interview, I believe, is from c. 1976. His lectures on India and Pakistan are quite relevant and almost prescient. Dialectics on the USSR and China should also be studied now.

You won't be seeing his likes ever again in politics. Some will say good. Some will say bad. But the man was a pro. And smarter than any president until, perhaps Clinton, whose intelligence was of a different sort.",1264032000,,1351,4.589211618257261
2678347,5,B000JMKB6W,"While I was watching the recent Frost/Nixon movie, based on the stage play, it only made me yearn to see, once again, the original 1977 interviews. So I googled ""frost nixon amazon"" and found this 2 DVD set. I ordered it immediately and when it arrived I stayed up most of two nights watching it.
The first Watergate interview is simply riveting. Although many of us despised Nixon in the early 1970s now, in comparison with George Bush, he looks more like JFK. Frost's hand and finger movements during the interview are almost astonishing in their ability to allow him to ask very threatening questions while his body language is warm and serene. Watching Nixon, with his wonderful deep and originally confident voice, gradually disintegrate is nothing short of spellbinding.
A book ""The Conviction of Richard Nixon"" by James Reston Jr describes how he (Reston) did most of the research that allowed Frost to spring questions that really took Nixon by surprise and I would recommend that book to anyone who has an interest in what went on in that Nixon-Watergate-tapes era. For me, the fact that I had read that book before watching these DVDs, helped me to appreciate the brilliance of Reston's research and the also the brilliant way that Frost put his questions across. Real life is more thrilling than a movie.",1262822400,,1315,4.848888888888889
2678348,4,B000JMKB6W,"400 minutes divided into 5 interviews on 2 disks packaged in a slip case, the product photo here is bluer than the actual product - which appears much darker, more of a dark gray than blue. Each interview is approx 1 hour and 15 minutes.

I would give 5 stars except for the bad video quality, which looks more like a copy-of-a-copy VHS transfer than a DVD.

What surprises me, and impresses, is how candid and fearless Frost is in his questions. He holds nothing back and has no problem asking pointed, difficult questions.

It's also quite impressive how well the Ron Howard film, Frost/Nixon, stuck to the facts by using almost exclusively dialog straight out of these interviews.

Product description from the back of the DVD:

This program, culled from the over 28 hours of interview footage between Sir David Frost and U.S. President Richard M. Nixon, was originally broadcast in May of 1977. Never before, nor since, has a U.S. President been so candid on camera. Even more intriguing is the fact that Nixon agreed to appear on camera with no pre-interview preparation or screening of questions.
Now the subject of a Major Motion Picture directed by Ron Howard, Frost/Nixon: The Complete Interviews is a riveting historic time capsule. Topics include the following:
Watergate,
Nixon And The World (Soviet Union, China)
War At Home And Abroad (Vietnam, Nixon s War at Home)
The Final Days (Resignation of Agnew, Personal Taxes, Nixon s Pardon)
The Last Roundup (18  minute gap, Supreme Court, Kissinger, John Mitchell).

This program also contains new footage with Sir David Frost shot in 2007 discussing the historic impact of the interviews along with his reactions of their famous encounter. Frost also discusses his views on Peter Morgan s interpretation and screenplay adaptation of this historical event.",1261353600,5,1816,5.01328903654485
2678349,5,B000JMKB6W,"I LOVE history and after watching the film ""Frost/Nixon"", I was disappointed in Richard Nixon. I was like, ""Is he really that wimpy?"" I realize that Hollywood puts their little 'spin' on things, so I actually researched for better information. Watching a few YouTube videos, I saw the Nixon that I knew and respected. Yes, respected. He was a brilliant man, despite the flaw and error on judgement. But that goes deeper than the public was allowed to know - check out his connection to Howard Hughes...but I digress LOL. So, I came to Amazon to see if I could find the REAL video of the Frost/Nixon interviews for both myself and my dad. I did! And at a great price!!!!

I watched it all and LOVED it! You saw the real Nixon in his articulate genius and you saw his raw, real, human emotion. You did not see a wimp (like the movie portrayed). You saw a man trying to show honesty, but still keep his character. To have ALL of the interviews at this price, was fantastic!!! I totally recommend anyone to get it!

And I also urge you to research real life events that Hollywood recreates. You'd be surprised to know the REAL facts and not the 'glorified' images that they sell us to make a hit-flick or control our emotions like some robot. ""300"" was NOT fought by just 300 men. They had a whole marine fleet, along with a HUGE army of men + their best 300 men on the front line. But the movie would make you think that those lone 300 men did all of that battling until the very end. LOL, not true! They were the best trained and were on the front line, but they had several thousand men behind them to assist. Just like ""Frost/Nixon"". They made him mooshy and act like a wuss. Nixon was nothing like that.

I am glad that I purchased this DVD and got to see history in the making. I was too young to appreciate it at the time. And my dad never saw the actual interviews, despite his immense interest in history and current events also. So he was very pleased, as was I.

Get it! It's great!!!!!!

2678354,5,B000JMKB6W,"I lived through the Nixon administrations and Watergate and as a young man worked for McGovern and rooted for the demise of Richard M Nixon. Funny, but the more I learn about this troubled man the more I actually respect him. Maybe its just that with time the some of the transgressions he was involved with often seem overblown in comparison to his achievements or maybe compared to more recent political graft and corruption we are dealing with on both sides of the aisle they seem small in comparison, but that said he did steal our virginity...which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Not  being able to even question authority ..something  we may be re-visiting is never a good thing in my humble opinion.

The bottom line is I enjoy hearing from the people themselves when it comes to history , whether it is musical icons discussing their careers or songwriting , soldiers discussing their time in WW2 (the brilliant BBC World at War is still the most compelling collection due to all the participant interviewees in my opinion) or politicians/Presidents.

Its fascinating viewing to say the least and a fabulous companion watch to Ron Howards' brilliant ""Frost/Nixon"" film.

I also highly recommend the Frost DVD with George H W Bush discussing his life, again because President Bush (1) does the talking its far more interesting than the talking head pbs programs.

If you are curious , I recommend this DVD set and because it has far more footage than the single disc which primarily features the Watergate interview I  feel its the better value....however I was recently informed by a friend who has the single disc set and I viewed it to confirm it has FOOTAGE not on the 2 disc set of a current day David Frost discussing the interviews and detailing his last visit with President Nixon....so completists could stand to (gasp) own both to get all  available from this epic event.",1246752000,5,1888,4.805555555555555

2678356,5,B000JMKB6W,"The last non-telegenic President has more closeups than Paul Newman in Hud.
This is a treat for Nixonphiles and for historians. And for those who really want to get into mix extra deep, there's plently here to impress: Nixon, the President, the man who was such an easy target for comics, for writers, for artists, speaks man to man and eyeball to eyebll to David Frost, who at times, has to go back over his notes with nervous hands.
I learned more about Watergate, Chile, Haldemann, Ehrlichmann, and the rest, right here, than in all the History made simple books I've scanned.
Particularly affecting is Nixon's sincerity as he expresses disappointment and depair over the lack of understanding and appreciation of his efforts to bring Peace in Vietnam and elsewhere; yes, his ""Vietnamization"" plan did work - but the bombing continued...and we invaded Cambodia, and this eventually brought war to that country!
On that point Frost will not back down, also on the 18.5 minute tape gap: as it occurred at the very beginning (as I recall) of the ""cover-up"" era, it's very hard to believe that some serious orchestrations weren't contained there.
I was troubled by his apparent taking and giving too much power: seems that he and Kissinger executed plans without full participation of his staff and Congress. (Not my area of expertise). Also troubling was his over-sympathy for John Mitchell - a big admission by Nixon, with regard to that working relationship, is contained here - statements strong enough to make a movie bigger than Ron Howard's!
Another tricky (sorry...) area is where Nixon says that a President in a time of War can do extraordinary things domestically and outside the country; yet another is his saying that a cover-up is not corrupt if the person/official acts in a non-corrupt way.
In the end, he acknowledges the fact that he acted in an non-*Presidential* way, and whether or not his actions were impeachable, he did wrong to the Country...and to himself.",1243728000,7,1981,4.934131736526946

I had heard that Nixon is somewhat mumbling and paranoid.  This is not the case.  Perhaps those who said this did not know what a thoughtful man looks, or behaves like.  Nixon comes across as considered, intelligent, and according to his own code quite honourable.  On a number of points, especially details about Watergate it is difficult to know whether on certain details his account holds up.

One thing is for sure.  Compared to at least two of the presidents who have followed him he is a paragon of coherence and transparency.  Any crimes he committed pale into insignificance compared to those of Reagan and Bush.

Nixon is an articulate and persuasive spokesman for a particular world view.  Whether you buy his line depends ultimately on whether you think the US was right to pursue the Cold War with the ruthlessness it did, especially in Vietnam.

Another thing worth remembering is that I am sure I read somewhere that the number of US troops in Vietnam decreased every single month Nixon was in power.  Having said that he dropped a huge number of bombs and did not mind killing millions of Asians to achieve his goal, which he says was to quit the war with honour.  But he was working toward quitting the war which could not be said of Johnson.

This is a window into a different time, where there was some relationship between what politicians said and the truth, even if you sometimes had to guess about it.",1406764800,,1524,4.5962962962962965

8152515,3,B000JMKB6W,"Watching the complete series of the Frost/Nixon interviews from 1977, one is struck by the confrontational nature of the entire process, with David Frost relentlessly posing question after question, and Nixon doing his best to respond to them as fully as he believed he could.  Granted, Nixon had a highly competent team behind him, providing him with the relevant information, but he nonetheless gives a highly polished performance - that is, until the questioning becomes too intense, and he makes his famous revelations.  One might say that at this point Frost gained the victory he was looking for, proving beyond all doubt his position as one of the most proficient interviewers on either side of the Atlantic Ocean.  This kind of program simply would not be broadcast today: I cannot imagine any US President, either past or present, being willing to subject himself to such an intense grilling,  On the other hand, many of the conversations might be of limited interest to those unacquainted with American history of the Sixties and Seventies: there is perhaps too much name-dropping in the conversations (of Nixon's closest advisers and other staff).
