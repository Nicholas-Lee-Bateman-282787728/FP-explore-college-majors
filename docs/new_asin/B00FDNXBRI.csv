5978234,5,B00FDNXBRI,"Ultra violent, ultra-raunchy (R-rated) dialogue, and ultra-wonderful.  Sensational and witty escapist adventure pitting youthful urban superheroes against sinister nihilistic supervillains.  Great cast (with Jim Carrey unrecognizable in #2) and sensational action, but really, NOT for kids under 14.",1412035200,,299,6.842105263157895

8614492,5,B00FDNXBRI,A good way to get both movies cheaper than buying them separately.,1519689600,,66,4.583333333333333

8614494,5,B00FDNXBRI,Movie was great! The beginning was a startling eye-catcher!,1512691200,,59,5.666666666666667
8614495,1,B00FDNXBRI,"Cool silly movies but i am not happy. As it was listed this product, for the bluray and digital ultraviolet versions of both movies, indicated it was region-free. Watch anywhere is advertised on the package. While the bluray dics may be region-free the digital versions are not. Since i do not reside in the united kingdom or ireland i am unable to redeem the digital versions of each film. I contacted ultraviolet asking for redemption codes valid in the united states, since the ones sold to me will not work, and they indicated they cannot assist me, noting that some third-pary vendors sell products imported from other countries. So advertising the product as region-free is false as the digital versions i wanted are in fact not region-free. Plus the cases for the bluray discs were busted up and broken as seen in the enclosed photo. I wanted digital versions of both movies and belived i would receive them, reasurred by the region-free portion of the product listing. I would not have puchased them had i known the digital versions were not redeemable outside of the united kingdom. So if you live in the united states do not buy anything with a digital version from Megahit Records out of the UK. But at least, now i know better, and to look for the PEGI british content ratings as a means to discern between products intended for distributin in the UK vrsus the US.  It is slightly different from the US MPAA ratings. Hopefully someone finds this information useful in the future.",1512172800,2,1491,4.734615384615385
