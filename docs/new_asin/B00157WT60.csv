3140572,5,B00157WT60,"I love all Ann Pringle Burnell's DVDs.  She is so soft spoken and I immediately feel so calm during my workout.  People don't realize, as I didn't realize before purchasing her series of DVDs, how much of a workout can be gotten by exercising from a chair.  I just want her to put out more DVDs!!",1300147200,41,296,4.25
3140573,5,B00157WT60,"Doable by just about anyone.  Even though the program is easy, I have found it to be effective.  Will look for other DVD's in her series.",1298764800,10,137,4.230769230769231
3140574,5,B00157WT60,"I purchased a number of DVDs offering chair exercises.  I found this series offered the most comprehensive set of exercises that were still within my ability - in fact the best all-round workout of any of them. I am a fit 80-year-old with some knee and hip issues, and by the time I finished I knew I had worked hard without doing myself any damage.",1297555200,86,349,4.369230769230769
3140575,5,B00157WT60,"I am not yet a full-fledged ""senior"" but I am getting there.  I wanted something to work my core without exhausting myself or being too difficult for me to complete.
This is the answer for all of us, not only seniors, with flexibility issues or other body wear and tear which requires care when exercising.  I would say this would be suitable for anyone 55 or older who is reasonably active.  Its aim is to keep you active and able to do everyday activities easier.  I can do the entire routine and the instructor is wonderful.  She explains things well and goes at just the right pace.  The routine takes a bit over a half hour so it is not too long for those of us with time issues.  There is a warm-up, then the core routine and ends with some standing exercises to strengthen your legs and feet (which Anne says to omit for those having trouble standing).  Other than this, the rest of the routine is done sitting.
I do feel like my core is working and I find that for a time after I finish, I do stand taller with better posture.  This is a routine which I will find helpful for many years to come.",1297209600,132,1103,4.239234449760765
3140576,5,B00157WT60,"I am using these DVDS for a senior program and I first reviewed it at home and then brought it to the group that does arm chair exercises.

3140578,5,B00157WT60,"My wife and I have gone to pilates classes for seniors using machines.  But the classes are on the expensive side.  So we tried a few pilates DVD's and most all are for younger, more flexible people.  Since we are in our mid 60's and in pretty good shape, we wanted a program that challenged our ability.  Most of the DVD's we tried mostly catered to seniors with some sort of physical quality that limited their abilities.  Stonger Seniors has been the perfect program for our age group.  The program is professionaly produced and Anne Pringle is the prefect instructor and moderator.  She explains every step and clarfies why its being done.  We have been using it for 4 months and do the program 3 days a week and still enjoy it.  It has made us more flexible and I don't feel like a big heap of muscle pain when I do outdoor activities such as snow removal.  We have also purchased her Stonger Seniors Yoga and Stretch and Strenthening DVD's and we love then",1266278400,289,962,4.445714285714286
3140579,5,B00157WT60,"I bought this DVD along with the Stronger Seniors Yoga for my mother, who is neither a senior or immobile, but healing from a major surgery to her abdomen due to a cancerous tumor. Seeing a once very active women sitting on the couch killed me. These DVD's have got her active again and has allowed her to heal at the same time. There is accommodations for all levels of ability, and you can choose a long workout or a basic one. It also seems she has more energy and is happier, which is very important to the healing process. I found that I got a good workout as well. These DVD's are great and I recommend them for anyone.",1254873600,121,625,4.216666666666667
3140580,5,B00157WT60,"This program is super.  I have met Anne Burnell personally at one of her classes, and she is as real in the DVDs as she is in person.  She helps so many people and takes a real interest in their well- being.

These chair exercises are a step up from the Stretch & Strength program.  I feel stronger not only in body but in spirit. The bands have toned my arms and legs and I am no longer sore from everyday activities.",1227398400,46,418,4.060975609756097

3140754,5,B00157WT60,"I got this for my mother who is an older adult and could benefit from something like this. She's not motivated to do it and I ended up getting it back from her because I realized that I needed it.
I broke my foot several months ago. Between that and increased commuting to work, plus having a couple of new grandbabies that I spend time with, I have gotten way too weak for my ""normal"" fitness routines. I'm still restricted from most of it because of the broken foot that is not healing. So I've been doing the routine on this DVD for a couple of weeks now and I think it's fantastic. If followed, it's doing what I want...increasing my strength and flexibility.
I think this is a great place for anyone to start who wants to get exercising but is quite out of shape. Having a stronger core makes all your motions safer, including getting started on a more rigorous exercise program. They always say to be careful when you're starting up an exercise program because hurting yourself will only set you back farther than where you're starting from. Starting with truly gentle core strengthening is a good strategy for kick starting any fitness program. I'm so glad that I happened to have this DVD available. I don't have to stand on my broken foot or modify some other program to avoid getting any weaker than I already have become. This awesome nurse does a great job leading the way for me to stay strong starting from where I am right now.
Total program time is 30min. Just long enough to get some real work-out done, but short enough to not be overwhelmed time-wise.",1398297600,9,1570,4.493006993006993

She has been struggling with other illness that has set her back to the point of giving up.  But these exercises seem to lift her spirits as well as motivate her without anxiety about what she cannot do.  I know with this ""I'll sue you mentality"" that is out there, that exercise programs avoid targeting seniors confined to walkers.  But it would be excellent if they catered to this group of seniors as well.  The doctor told her 30 years ago she would be in a wheelchair for most of her life, and that is yet to happen at 88 years.  That said, it is clear that there are more seniors using walkers that would use reasonable chair exercising to enable them to continue to be upright and walking.",1398211200,6,814,4.422818791946309

Until such time I find I can weight train on Universal machines and then incorporate this dvd at home.  Anne Pringle Burnell uses basic Pilates exercises adapted to a chair, similar to what Peggy Cappy has developed for yoga.  My surgeon was amazed at what movement I still had in the hip joint considering the level of ""decay"" that had occurred.

As in any exercise program a person has to make adjustments for their personal level of ability.

The instructor is quite pleasant, but she goes too fast..especially when you're just learning the movements and breathing. It's a bit of an adjustment for those who have done yoga, since the breathing and abdominal contractions are different. I could have used a little more explanation and some slower walk-throughs in the beginning. But the movements aren't hard, and one catches on fairly quickly.

The only thing I'd like to have is more detailed instruction & practice of the tucking/tightening of the core muscles and more instruction on breathing before starting the exercises.  I couldn't figure out a pattern in the breaths (Inhale up, exhale down?!?) while doing the exercises.  I also wasn't sure if I had the right pelvic muscles tightened for each exercise & was concerned that I might be injuring something.

This might not be a problem for some people who are more fit than I am at the start.  But,  as I am starting 'from scratch' in recovery from a car accident, I need extra assurance that I'm not going to strain something in my neck because I""m holding my stomach wrong when I turn my  head with my hand up!

The instructor is very encouraging, and if you really are a beginner to Pilates, not just to exercise in general, I think this is a very good starting point.  I plan to buy the other DVD's in the series.",1358899200,38,1158,4.497607655502392

The routine works every muscle of the body and does so from a sitting position in a chair.  There is also a standing segment, but it is not near as long.  Not yet being a senior citizen, I also believe the 35 minute routine has great value for everybody.  We all should start the day with this kind of routine where we stretch and strengthen our muscles to maintain balance and open our lungs for more energy.

This is the answer for all of us, not only seniors, with flexibility issues or other body wear and tear which requires care when exercising.  I would say this would be suitable for anyone 55 or older who is reasonably active.  Its aim is to keep you active and able to do everyday activities easier.  I can do the entire routine and the instructor is wonderful.  She explains things well and goes at just the right pace.  The routine takes a bit over a half hour so it is not too long for those of us with time issues.  There is a warm-up, then the core routine and ends with some standing exercises to strengthen your legs and feet (which Anne says to omit for those having trouble standing).  Other than this, the rest of the routine is done sitting.
I do feel like my core is working and I find that for a time after I finish, I do stand taller with better posture.  This is a routine which I will find helpful for many years to come.",1297209600,132,1103,4.239234449760765

Most of the DVD's we tried mostly catered to seniors with some sort of physical quality that limited their abilities.  Stonger Seniors has been the perfect program for our age group.  The program is professionaly produced and Anne Pringle is the prefect instructor and moderator.  She explains every step and clarfies why its being done.  We have been using it for 4 months and do the program 3 days a week and still enjoy it.

I am 66 and retired, became too sedate and this has loosened me up and strengthened me along with her others. A great line of videos for those of us who need strength but hate exercise.

3375251,5,B00157WT60,"I got this for my mother who is an older adult and could benefit from something like this. She's not motivated to do it and I ended up getting it back from her because I realized that I needed it.
I broke my foot several months ago. Between that and increased commuting to work, plus having a couple of new grandbabies that I spend time with, I have gotten way too weak for my ""normal"" fitness routines. I'm still restricted from most of it because of the broken foot that is not healing. So I've been doing the routine on this DVD for a couple of weeks now and I think it's fantastic. If followed, it's doing what I want...increasing my strength and flexibility.
I think this is a great place for anyone to start who wants to get exercising but is quite out of shape. Having a stronger core makes all your motions safer, including getting started on a more rigorous exercise program. They always say to be careful when you're starting up an exercise program because hurting yourself will only set you back farther than where you're starting from. Starting with truly gentle core strengthening is a good strategy for kick starting any fitness program. I'm so glad that I happened to have this DVD available. I don't have to stand on my broken foot or modify some other program to avoid getting any weaker than I already have become. This awesome nurse does a great job leading the way for me to stay strong starting from where I am right now.
Total program time is 30min. Just long enough to get some real work-out done, but short enough to not be overwhelmed time-wise.",1398297600,9,1570,4.493006993006993

She has been struggling with other illness that has set her back to the point of giving up.  But these exercises seem to lift her spirits as well as motivate her without anxiety about what she cannot do.  I know with this ""I'll sue you mentality"" that is out there, that exercise programs avoid targeting seniors confined to walkers.  But it would be excellent if they catered to this group of seniors as well.  The doctor told her 30 years ago she would be in a wheelchair for most of her life, and that is yet to happen at 88 years.  That said, it is clear that there are more seniors using walkers that would use reasonable chair exercising to enable them to continue to be upright and walking.",1398211200,6,814,4.422818791946309

Until such time I find I can weight train on Universal machines and then incorporate this dvd at home.  Anne Pringle Burnell uses basic Pilates exercises adapted to a chair, similar to what Peggy Cappy has developed for yoga.

The instructor is quite pleasant, but she goes too fast..especially when you're just learning the movements and breathing. It's a bit of an adjustment for those who have done yoga, since the breathing and abdominal contractions are different.

I bought a traditional yoga dvd targeted for runners but many of the poses are difficult so I was so happy to discover this Chair Yoga dvd. The video is just over 30 minutes so it gives me a perfect post-run stretch session after a long run. I found the stretches effective but gentle for a yoga novice like me and I love that it stretches everything from my neck to the arches of my feet.

3375311,4,B00157WT60,"I enjoy this workout & like that the people demonstrating the moves with the instructor are definitely seniors.  It feels much more realistic than so many of the videos with the oiled & tanned (and young & skinny) instructors.

The only thing I'd like to have is more detailed instruction & practice of the tucking/tightening of the core muscles and more instruction on breathing before starting the exercises.  I couldn't figure out a pattern in the breaths (Inhale up, exhale down?!?) while doing the exercises.  I also wasn't sure if I had the right pelvic muscles tightened for each exercise & was concerned that I might be injuring something.

This might not be a problem for some people who are more fit than I am at the start.  But,  as I am starting 'from scratch' in recovery from a car accident, I need extra assurance that I'm not going to strain something in my neck because I""m holding my stomach wrong when I turn my  head with my hand up!

The instructor is very encouraging, and if you really are a beginner to Pilates, not just to exercise in general, I think this is a very good starting point.  I plan to buy the other DVD's in the series.",1358899200,38,1158,4.497607655502392

The routine works every muscle of the body and does so from a sitting position in a chair.  There is also a standing segment, but it is not near as long.  Not yet being a senior citizen, I also believe the 35 minute routine has great value for everybody.  We all should start the day with this kind of routine where we stretch and strengthen our muscles to maintain balance and open our lungs for more energy.
