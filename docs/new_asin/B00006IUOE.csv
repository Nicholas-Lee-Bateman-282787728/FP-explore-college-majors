7969624,1,B00006IUOE,"Possibly the worst DVD or rockumentary I have ever seen. And in Bangkok it cost me 25$! Basically a bunch of teens claimiing they planned the bat things and trying to capitalize on it. 75% is footage that has nothing to do with Ozzy: beer cans on a table, some garage band playing, some girls showing their breasts (not at an Ozzy concert...). It's ridiculous.
Do not buy this!",1035676800,4,377,4.478260869565218
7969625,1,B00006IUOE,"I am the biggest Ozzy fan in the world.  I have 5 autographs,  I have collectibles, every cd, rare stuff... you get the point.  I know the facts and I have seen every Ozzy piece there is.  This is the worst piece ... I have ever seen.  This looks like someone made it in their basement with a cam-corder.  It has no concert footage, no ozzy music and no new information to offer.  I am not joking.  This stinks.  Knowing Ozzy, don't be surprised if he speaks out against this unauthorized piece of junk and tells you not to buy it.  He always deals with quality.  He will be very angry to see this-  so was I and you will be too.  Words cannot express how angry I was at this ""thing"".  ...",1032912000,6,689,4.082706766917293
7969626,1,B00006IUOE,If you are an Ozzy fan or a music fan of any type then DO NOT buy this trash!!!!!  This is one of the poorest quality videos that I have ever seen.  The information is wrong half of the time and most of the footage is not even of Ozzy. The portion of the tape that is actually an interview with the Ozzman is over 10 years old and badly edited.,1031875200,9,344,3.8309859154929575
