8572594,5,B00BQJSA24,I really enjoyed watching the 2 seasons but I feel cheated by not knowing what happens to the characters.  I despise series that cause you to feel investment in the characters and then leave you hanging at the end!  I will just have to make up my own ending to each character...,1519516800,,278,4.326923076923077
8572595,4,B00BQJSA24,"I enjoyed both seasons of this series overall. I thought the period detail was fascinating, the performances and direction were excellent, and the characters were interesting. My complaint is that the series starts out as a glimpse into the inner workings of a 19th century brothel but quickly turns into a power struggle between various rivals for control of the house. The sex is replaced by violence, and the plots follow what is a predictable narrative convention. I would have preferred less power plays by outsiders and more interplay or rivalry or plotting among the girls. And more sex.
  Despite my complaints about the violence, it's hard to believe this is a French film. French films are typically boring and arty, with way too much navel-gazing and agonizing over the meaning of life. This change to films that you can actually watch all the way through is a change I hope to see the entire French film industry embrace. Maybe they'll even make films that turn a profit instead of relying on government subsidies to survive.",1471219200,,1037,4.886363636363637

8572597,5,B00BQJSA24,"Season 2 flashes forward a bit to 1873, still in the early days of the French Third Republic, when many were glad to be rid of the monarchy, yet others pined for its reestablishment. Much to the chagrin of Hortense, Le Paradis is now run by its proletariat residents, but it doesn't take long before the bordello is caught between the vice squad and a small band of hoodlums, leading to such scenarios as a picnic becoming a bloodbath.

Season 2 features a magnificent reprisal of Rose by Jemima West, who now ranges from feisty newly literate Marxist to withdrawn lovestruck drug addict. In reviewing Season 1, I stated that somehow Maison Close ""doesn't leave you in a pool of misery""; the same cannot be said for Season 2. Yet despite the emphatic tragedy of it all, Maison Close is well worth watching in its entirety, rivaling the best of dramas about the disenfranchised.

There was industry chatter in 2012 about HBO picking up Maison Close for a remake; I can only hope that it didn't happen and that such a series doesn't come to fruition. This show about a sliver of French history was meant to be produced by the French, and it was done so here without room for improvement.",1440892800,,1185,4.584905660377358
