5540283,1,B00B0FQ8NC,"I bought this ""DVD"" thinking I would get a great gift for x-mas. What a stupid mistake!!!! I received my ""DVD"" and what a surprise!!!! it was a miserable copy recorded by someone who is making money illegaly. That DVD was not original, it seems to be a VCD or a simple cd. I can not believe that Amazon supports this!!!. And when I placed my order on 12/17/2005, I paid an extra charge to get such ""DVD"" faster. I selected ""expedited shipping"" and just got it on 12/24/05 afternoon. Before I received my ""DVD"" I sent an e-mail to ""total-music"" the vendor, telling them that it was a fraud that they were charging for expedited shipping and it took so long. Such bastards responded in a way only gangsters could do it. And they are @#$@$%%@ bastards gangsters!!! here is a copy of what they ""kindly"" responded:

5540284,4,B00B0FQ8NC,"This concert is ok, but the thing that makes it really good is the fact thatthe band plays so many songs that you might never hear a live version of otherwise (unless you're lucky enough to have Eddie's Archive). This show is great because, not only does it contain 6 out of the 8 songs from Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, but it also has gems such as The Prisoner, Wasted Years and Die With Your Boots On!",1125446400,2,405,4.139240506329114
5540285,4,B00B0FQ8NC,"Do not read to much into the other review on here. This is a fantastic DVD. Maiden England captures Iron Maiden on their Seventh Son of a Seventh Son tour. Bruce Dickinson is one of the best metal singers EVER. Sure now a days, he may have to ""strain"" a little. But he can still blow away most competition live. And for the reviewer ahead of me to say Nicko McBrain is a ""liability"" is just a complete farce. Nicko is the man. Nicko is always so energetic behind his massive set up of thundering drums, and is no less of that here. Very good song list...I will watch it many more times....Iron Maiden is one of the best live bands to ever grace my ears. Their elaborate stage setup is just an extra bonus..Live after Death will remain a staple in history as one of the biggest, baddest live shows ever. This show is definately worth a watch. Cant wait till their next live dvd for Dance of Death tour comes out.",1121817600,3,911,4.271676300578035
5540286,4,B00B0FQ8NC,"I do really like this video, it has a great feel of 1988 and most of the songs are superb. My only complaint is the bass throughout, it sounds really clangy and you even hear Bruce complaining about it (I think he asks the engineer to turn it down a bit). Maybe that's how they liked the bass back in the day, or maybe if you play this video through a good quality sound system it won't sound so naff (I have a crappy TV set) but anyway it's not the end of the world, and apart from this, the video rocks. Recommended.",1066176000,,518,4.038834951456311
5540287,5,B00B0FQ8NC,"This video was filmed on November 27th and 28th 1988 at the two sold-out concerts of Iron Maiden at Birmingham's N.E.C.,England. The concerts were part of the extensive worldwide tour,'Seventh Tour Of A Seventh Tour',which also included Maiden's headliling at the 'Monsters Of Rock' festival in Donington park,England. The video was Dirested and Edited by Maiden's bassist Steve Harris and came out in 1989,but also in 1994 in Double Pack-CD & Video. The whole tour had great succses with their second UK number one album,'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son'.The set-list included some classics that Maiden hadn't play live the recent tours,like Still Life,THE PRISONER and, oh yes, KILLERS with Bruce's magnificent vocals. This was the last perfect Maiden gig in the 80s. Many people think that Bruce hadn't sang that well on a Maiden gig since 'Maiden England',but the new live album 'Rock In Rio' is just a proof  that Bruce can sing better than on 'Maiden England' and even 'Live After Death'.",1022457600,3,991,5.0426829268292686
5540288,1,B00B0FQ8NC,"The rating is not for the ""Maiden England"" DVD set's fine content -it's a great concert/documentary 2 disc combo, - but for it's widely available Argentinian pressing.

A large number of the Maiden England NTSC DVDs are manufactured in Argentina: in fact, the NTSC versions available online seem to be almost exclusively those. If you reside in North America, be sure to contact the dealer/merchant and inquire of the disc's origin of manufacture: based on several versions of this pressing, the Argentinian DVDs do not work at all, in N.

This is an interesting historical document. Unfortunately, Bruce did not really learn to handle the rigors of singing Maiden night after night until he left the band and came back for Brave New World. If you want to hear good singing, pick up Rock in Rio through En Vivo. If you want to experience Maiden at their Zenith, and don't mind very strained, often flat vocals, you'll enjoy this ok.
Flight 666 has a very similar set and sounds better to these ears - plus the documentary is very well done.",1415491200,,553,4.485148514851486

And Bruce Dickenson has one of the great voices of this genre of music.. I first owned this show on VHS Tape.. The quality of this remastered show is impressive.. I am sure the people who bought tickets for this outing were very satisfied.. Great set list as well.. If you are, or even claim, to be a fan.. Then this is for you.. And the packaging is light years better than the Live in Rio double DVD set.. Who ever is in charge of merchandising should be ashamed for how they chose to release that to us fans..

5540310,5,B00B0FQ8NC,"This is easily one of Iron Maiden's two best live DVDs ever.  Most people would consider Live After Death to be their best recorded live show, but I would consider Maiden England to be even better.  Both live recordings follow each of their best albums (imo) and offer material from each album, but the sound quality is clearly better in Maiden England.

I like how Steve had control over the filming of this one, and gave the user a view as if they were in the crowd, the setlist was top notch with the exclusion of songs from Powerslave (which we get from Live After Death). The main downside is I hear Bruce was sick when this was recorded; some of the time you can't even tell, but a few times he was a little off.  I thought he absolutely nailed Moonchild and Infinite Dreams as well as humanly possible, but on some tracks (like The Prisoner) he was a little bit off at times.  But he's not terribly off as well, and considering the tracks he nails, the occasional blip can easily be overlooked.

I own the original VHS, which I bought still sealed around 10 years ago (might have been the last still-sealed copy on the planet?) and the newly released remastered version titled ""Maiden England '88"".  The remaster does the recording justice -- the sound quality is very good and even after being remastered, it remains true to the production quality of the day as opposed to today's rather weak over production where incompetent producers get off by compressing everything to 100% (I guarantee albums like Powerslave or Seventh Son of a Seventh Son would not be the same album with a modern producer).",1380326400,,1607,4.578397212543554
5540311,4,B00B0FQ8NC,"A great concert from Iron Maiden, I must admit that the first 5 minutes the image suffer because of the red lighting of the stage nevertheless after that the restoration of the film is neat and spotless. The audio is near perfect.",1379980800,,230,4.5
5540312,4,B00B0FQ8NC,"I'm tore between a 3 and a 4, so we'll say 3.5 and round up (according to my Breaking Bad chemistry teacher) to 4.

The good:  For the age of this the surround isn't bad.  Of course play it on DTS not Dolby Digital.  It's pretty dang good for the age, but I'll give them some slack since it's a 25 freaking year old recording.  Saw the tour this last summer where they basically performed this concert. Blew my mind.

The not so good:  OK, I'm not an idiot.  I understand that in '88 they didn't know we'd all have 16:9 TVs.  The latest Dio release on Blu-ray is in 16:9 from '86 and is very nice in the video department.  But DON'T JUST STRETCH THE PICTURE OUT to fit our new TVs. I'd rather have normal looking people and have black bars on the edge than see freaking looking stretched out crap. I have the capability to stretch out the video myself if I don't like the black bars. I don't think it's my blu-ray automatically stretching it, but I could be wrong.

""Even in my wildest dreams""... God I love that song.  Sorry got distracted.

For a historical piece, it rocks.  But don't expect it to compare to recent concert or even to other bands from the period.  Just be glad they recorded it and get your head out your you know what and rock out!  Up the Irons!

""I'd like to think when I die I get another chance"".  Man that song (and album), has to be one of Maiden's best.",1379894400,,1381,4.166666666666667

5540315,5,B00B0FQ8NC,I saw the Powerslave tour back in 1985.  It has turned out to be the only time that I've seen them live.  Maiden England keeps those memories alive and well.  Up the Irons!  Highly recommended.,1374364800,,193,4.428571428571429
5540316,5,B00B0FQ8NC,"It's not that surprising Iron Maiden has another new dvd seeing as they put one out every couple of years. That's more often than when they put out a new studio album. The question that I think people ask is ""is it worth it?"" Yes and no. It all depends on you. Do you like your Maiden classic or more modern? Do you like watching Maiden perform on stage? Do you like seeing them on tour? How about watching vintage footage from the 80's? There's many variables and many questions that you have to ask yourself. In the case of Maiden England '88, a re-release of the VHS from 1989, these questions apply. The dvd coincides with the band's current Maiden England World Tour. It features remastered audio along with three unreleased encores. The original Martin Burch stereo mix is accompanied by new 5.1 mixes and stereo mixes for the encores from Kevin ""Caveman"" Shirley, just like on the Live After Death dvd. This is one of the best sounding live releases they have. It warrants buying the cd version as well. One of the best features is The History Of Iron Maiden - Part 3 which continues from where part 2 left off, and focuses on Somewhere In Time and Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, and the tours that followed each album. Also included is the previously out-of-printed 12 Wasted Years, and the music videos from Somewhere In Time and Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. Having recently made a full transition into Blu-Ray, this was my first dvd in a year. Since Maiden's last two videos Flight 666 and En Vivo! were both released on Blu-Ray, I had imagined they'd have one for this. Sadly, no. That didn't stop me from picking this up, but I hope the next one is a Blu-Ray.",1372982400,,1671,4.4640522875816995

Is this process very hard as pertains to new modern technology being used on old film in being that the Film Producer remastered each shot digitally, I think the same thing needs to be done with that Steve Harris shot Rock In Rio Show because there are way too many camera changes.

5540334,4,B00B0FQ8NC,"Maiden England is a great live show and an incredible setlist. The History of Iron Maiden documentaries that have been on some of the previous releases, though, are the biggest draws for me. Incredibly informative, often funny, and always entertaining. I have to say I felt a little let down by the History documentary for the Somewhere In Time/Seventh Son era. We got an entire standalone documentary for the Powerslave/Live After Death stuff, but here it feels as though they were really trying to rush through a time period that encompasses nearly 4 years of history, all condensed into a measly 40 minutes.

Maybe I'm biased because Somewhere In Time is one of my all-time favorite records, but it just feels like this set got particularly short changed. I hope this trend doesn't continue when we get into the 90's stuff, because I'm sure that's where a LOT of the juiciest stuff will be.",1368316800,,893,4.798701298701299

5540338,3,B00B0FQ8NC,"Yes, people wanted to have the Seventh Son concert, but the other main reason, and for some people THE MAIN REASON for buying this is to have part 3 of the History of the Band. The first two were quite good, with part 1 being stellar. They are both of feature film length, but this one isn't even an hour long. What gives Steve? Didn't quite up the irons, now did ya?

Also, the people who are going to buy this are die-hard fans. They want Somewhere in Time concert footage, and if you explain why there is little professional quality footage, but that there is a fair amount of bootleg quality, then they'll curse Rod for nixing the concert film in 86, and then thank the lord for what is available. So don't leave it out because it's not up to snuff. Hell, the fifteen-year old target audience frame around the documentary isn't up to snuff but we still watch it.

Also, just to clarify, putting 12 Wasted Years in the package in no way makes for a shortened documentary. Also, it does not create a space problem because The Early Years and Live After Death are both packed with extras, especially the Early Years.

So here's incentive for ya, Steve.

5540344,5,B00B0FQ8NC,"The Maiden England concert is Maiden at their prime when it comes to energy. They are at their fastest, and as Nicko says in the disc two documentary they'e so fast, ""Bruce can barely sing the song!"") Though I would argue their songs have matured well and slower versions of their hits allow a richer sound (exactly what Adrian Smith was looking for before he left the band- of course they found their way back). My highlights here are the songs from Seventh Son: Moonchild, Infinite Dreams, and Seventh Son in particular are excellent. The version of Hallowed is also among the best I've ever heard. Bruce is great as always, though I could argue he's only gotten better with time. Steve's bass stands out on this concert as the foundation for the songs. Steve and Adrian go back and forth as two of the best guitarists in metal. The drums steal this show and Nicko really stands out as the leader of the songs and take you into some primal zone.

Disc two gives you a bonus selection of documentaries. History Part 3 is great and 12 Wasted Years has some great old footage from the earlier years (if you never seen them this is worth the price alone). The videos are good too if you've never seen them, but they're quite silly. I'm really waiting for a CD box set with bonus unreleased material, but that's another story. Maiden England was an important part of this band's history and I'm glad they rereleased it, since my old VHS copy was given away at a garage sale years ago.",1367020800,,1481,4.485185185185185

5540353,4,B00B0FQ8NC,"Iron Maiden has always been good about putting out concert videos to please their fans, and this DVD release of ""Maiden England"" has been highly anticipated.  I remember this video not being a favorite of mine, after being a huge fan of the ""Live After Death"" concert video, the style of this video had bothered me with its editing and the band playing against a white background.  Plus, I was not a huge ""Seventh Son"" fan compared to previous albums; after watching the ""history"" documentary and learning that they could have made a concert video for the ""Somewhere in Time"" tour with its spectacular stage set-up and solid setlist was another kick in the pants.  They really missed out on that one and they know it, but it's too late.  Ok, so after many years of not seeing this video and being in the pit for last year's ""Maiden England"" tour which I really enjoyed, I still feel the same about most of the video.  Editing - I don't know why you would ever break away from a guitarist while he is in the middle of a solo to flash to Steve, Nicko, or Bruce messing around.  It's their moment - so give it to them.  I've always been a believer that the singer should exit the stage and/or fall into the background while the solos are going on; Bruce does not always like to do that.  While the picture has supposedly been improved, watching an old concert, which was probably filmed on video tape, and now put on a DVD, still looks pretty bad on an HD television, especially the faraway shots.  I enjoyed seeing live versions of ""Still Life"" and ""Infinite Dreams"" again, the latter being strangely absent during the modern ""Maiden England"" tour.  The oddballs in the setlist are ""Die with your boots on"" and ""Killers"", two songs that should have stayed within the tour for that respective album only.  Seeing the recent tour helped me enjoy the song ""Seventh Son"" more, so watching this video reminded me how cool it is to see performed live.  I appreciate the encores being added and this version of ""Running Free"" is the most intense one I have seen or heard.  Overall, it was good to see this performance again, flaws and all, especially with the classic line-up.

The second disc is full of some pretty cool extras.  I have enjoyed the ""History of Iron Maiden"" segments, but this one added a lot of distracting and quite frankly annoying visual effects that were completely unnecessary for a documentary and took away from the content of the interviews.  Then they leave you hanging with Adrian Smith beginning to explain why he had decided to leave the band after the tour.  As I mentioned earlier, it sucks to know that they could have made a ""Somewhere in Time"" concert video and the manager ruled against it; I think that would have been a true classic.  I agree with other reviewers that they should have included what they did shoot on the disc.

I enjoyed watching ""12 Wasted Years"" again.  I bought that on VHS when it first came out and watched and enjoyed it many times back in the day.  Although a lot of the concert footage has been included in the ""Early Days"" DVD,  that was all fans had to go on back in the day.  The documentary looked like I was watching a VHS tape on an HD TV, but it was still cool to see again.  I still want to know who Bruce is yelling at when they show the footage from Dortmund while playing ""Iron Maiden"".  I'm glad Maiden included this classic on this release.

Overall, highly recommended for the true fan.  For the price you pay, there is a lot of stuff included and they even turned the insert into a poster.",1365033600,,3559,4.477519379844961
5540354,5,B00B0FQ8NC,"I've never owned this concert, so I was excited by the new release having always heard that it was great.  The sound and picture quality are excellent for a 1988 recording, and the set list is incredible.  I've never heard anything live from Iron Maiden that didn't sound fantastic, so it's not much of a surprise, but I'm glad they decided to re-release it in CD and DVD formats.  If you're a Maiden fanatic, you couldn't be disappointed with the quality, and if you're a casual fan, it's a near-perfect documentation of their music up through Seventh Son, with songs from almost every album (sadly, nothing from Powerslave).  The songs are performed in typically entrancing fashion, and the ecstatic crowd provides a compelling backdrop to Maiden's world-class music.

Advantages to the DVD include seeing the massive, vintage stage set; watching the intensity and antics of live Maiden (i.e., Bruce running around singing with Dave Murray hoisted on his shoulders playing guitar); and the two documentaries and five music videos on the second disc.  As an added bonus for people who already owned the older version, this includes three encore songs that have never been released; Run to the Hills, Running Free, and Sanctuary.  Also cool is that the inlay booklet folds out into a large poster, with the new artwork covering one entire side. The other side is a giant collage of various Maiden live shots and artwork.

Performed nearly 25 years ago, this show displays Maiden at the height of their prowess, though I honestly don't think they've lost a step in all those years.  Their last live release, En Vivo!, which focused on their most recent album, was stunning it its own right, but if you love classic Maiden (and who doesn't?), this DVD provides 18 tracks of pure bliss.  Any fan of legendary heavy metal should not be disappointed.",1364947200,,1845,4.884615384615385
5540355,4,B00B0FQ8NC,"FINALLY they officially released this on DVD. 1988's ""Maiden England"" show captures Iron Maiden hitting another peak, seeing as how the corresponding album, ""Seventh Son of a Seventh Son"" did really well for the most part, and the shows they played were massive. The show itself is of good quality in terms of video and audio quality, especially considering how old the video really is. And the editing, allthough done by Steve Harris (bless him), DOESN'T show you a full show worth of rapidly changing 1-second clips, which is a huge plus. As a bonus, I dare say the setlist is killer. 6 out of the 8 songs found on ""Seventh Son"" are featured, and in addition to the old hits and live staples, you get a few rarities as well, namely ""Still Life"", ""Die With Your Boots On"" and ""Killers"". NO Powerslave songs were featured, though, but with ""Live After Death"" in your arsenal (where it should be), it's allright. Oh, for the record, some people have commented on Dickinson's vocal performance - the guy had recently had the flu as far as I remember! He still sounds pretty good to me, though (if you wanna hear what he's like when he's REALLY got a bad case of the flu, there are a few 1986 bootlegs available on youtube).

As for the 2nd disc, I must say I'm a bit disappointed, but before I explain why, I wanna stress that it's still good, and DEFINITELY worth having. Now, onto the whining:

1 - The documentary, part 3 of the ""History"" series, is only 40 minutes long despite covering 2 excellent studio albums and their corresponding tours. This is a popular, yet also rarely discussed era of the band, and while you get interesting anecdotes and details from the guys, the whole story seems a whole lot more rushed than in the previous 2 parts, which I think is a shame. Speaking of ""rushed"", good LORD, the editing and putting it all together seems rushed. It's clearly a different person behind this one, and he/she seems to be on a mission to make your eyes explode. The whole ""let's surround the main object with a messy collage of old photos and live footage"" approached may have worked well for the video for ""The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg"", but for a 40 minute documentary it drives you crazy. There's a TON of things going on at once. Also, between these shots, there are other photos, often shown at rapid speeds, with distracting backgrounds and fancy effects put on for NO obvious reason. Plus, they only interview the 5 bandmembers who were involved, as well as manager Rod Smallwood. The earlier installments have featured input from other people involved with the band at the time, so that you get to see more sides of the story. In short, I definitely feel this installment is inferior to the other 2 in both quality and content, but like I mentioned above, it's still worth having, there's no doubt about that.

2 - Is it just me or are the promo videos featured on here of lower quality than at least those on the ""Live After Death"" bonus disc?

3 - Okay, so they do a brand new 40 minute documentary, but still include the 90 minute 1987 documentary ""12 Wasted Years"", a retrospective that mostly overlaps the ""History"" releases? Now, to be fair, you do get to see a few things that are left out of the ""History"" installments, namely a few rare live clips and Paul Di'Anno with a mullet. But I'd gladly replace this outdated documentary with a longer, more complete ""History"" documentary and.. well, see point 4.

4 - Since they included the awesome - albeit very rough - footage of the Ruskin Arms show on the first ""History""-dvd... Why not include WHATEVER decently shot material available from the ""Somewhere in Time"" tours, which many fans are dying to see, even though it may not be of the best quality? In the documentary, Rod Smallwood says they've ""got bits of"" the show, and they  agree it was a good show! I mean, the 1987 Philadelphia concert was filmed by multiple cameras, and some of the songs are of decent quality, maybe that could've been used?

To sum up, the first disc alone makes this purchase worth the money, because it's brilliant, and the 2nd disc is allright, I just feel it could be better. It looks like it's been put together rather quickly, to be honest. But others may disagree, and in any case, my humble subjective opinions still won't prevent me from recommending this purchase to fans and Maiden rookies. Don't hesitate to buy it!",1364774400,30,4395,4.591082802547771
5540356,5,B00B0FQ8NC,"I guess I don't understand all the complaining about this DVD. The editing is great, the sound is great & the 40 minute History of Iron Maiden Part 3 is great.

5540357,3,B00B0FQ8NC,"Sadly, he lost that skill some time within the last 20 years.

""Maiden England"" (which is now called ""Maiden England '88"") has been through some strange iterations through the years. Originally released on VHS tape, there was a rare collector's version that was accompanied with a 2 CD set of the concert as well. I was an original owner of the VHS tape, and longed for a DVD conversion since the mid 1990s, or at least a re-release of the CDs. While not my favorite Iron Maiden concert (reasons stated below), the setlist was near perfect (except for a glaring lack of Powerslave songs...), the live stage was entertaining, and for me, this was Iron Maiden's last great tour before excellent songwriting took a back seat to simplistic styles, and the engaging concerts were replaced with on-stage gratuitous shenanigans in the form of Janick Gers. Iron Maiden today is a shallow reflection of what it was from '82 - '88, and this video captures the zenith of that ""golden era.""

I can't help but compare this concert to its official predecessor, ""Live After Death."" Every lover of heavy metal ought to own ""Live After Death,"" as it is in my opinion not only Iron Maiden's greatest live concert in terms of setlist, and also the most polished, well-produced live recording the band has ever released (yes, I've heard and own them them all in glistening lossless audio), but also one of the best live heavy metal albums in existence, from any metal band. (And for me, live metal albums nearly always sound horrible compared to their well-produced, studio counterparts). Upon comparing this concert to ""Live After Death,"" it falls short in a few, minor places. First, the overall sound of the concert isn't quite up to snuff. For me, the guitar overdrive has always sounded ""softer"" than those on Live After Death, or perhaps somewhat less distinguished. Moreover, Steve Harris' bass guitar has an overbearing ""tinny"" sound to it, which is his trademark in some respect, but not to this extent. Still, it doesn't entirely distract from the sound of the concert, unlike Geddy Lee's bass did for ""Rush in Rio,"" which was a bass guitar production disaster. Next, Bruce Dickinson's vocals were off on some of these songs. Honest fans of the band have written elsewhere that this is due to the heavy touring the band had endured up to this point, so perhaps that's what I'm hearing. But he sings out of key in a few places (parts of ""Moonchild"" and ""The Prisoner"" especially), where his voice slips here and there. He also seems to have lost some of his screech, which was more prominent on the studio versions, and more heavily utilized on Live After Death (cf. the ending of ""Flight of Icarus""). I will admit, however, that it is especially cool to see and hear the encore songs that were trimmed from the original release due to the time constraints of the VHS format. (Until now, outside of the original collector's edition, lossless audio of some of these songs were only available as rare b-sides to the various singles from the ""Seventh Son of of a Seventh Son"" album, or as the bonus disc from the now out-of-print Castle Records 2-disc version of the studio album. By the way, if you can find any of the Castle Records releases of the band's studio albums, buy them. The sound quality is vastly superior to today's overly clipped/compressed ""remasters,"" which in my opinion sound absolutely terrible).

Lastly, my final comment is deserving of its own paragraph. Steve Harris, the band's bassist (and founder, and ""front-man""), has taken it upon himself to edit most of the band's official concert videos. While the audio of these concerts stands on its own, the video editing has gradually degraded over time. Currently, Steve's style is to give the viewer about 1 to 1.5 seconds of footage before switching to the next 1 to 1.5 seconds of footage, never really giving the viewer a chance to see what is going on. There are also fewer wide shots, which is odd given that Iron Maiden is probably the only mainstream heavy metal band that has FOUR active guitarists (3 rhythm/lead guitarists, and 1 bassist), and therefore A LOT of stage presence. Maiden England '88 represents the last decent editing job Steve Harris produced before his seizure-inducing hack-and-slice editing jobs of the last 20 years' worth of concert releases. What I'm saying is that this concert is enjoyable from the standpoint of video editing, but keep in mind that Steve Harris' video editing quality stops here and hasn't returned.",1364601600,12,4511,4.825581395348837
5540358,5,B00B0FQ8NC,"This is a fixed review. in my previous review I said that the concert dvd is a 4:3 ratio, therefore it's a square screen with black bars on both sides. but now I'm watching it on my dvd player instead of my pc, and it's a wide screen picture (dont know why, maybe the windows media player shrinks it??). great concert, a must have for any Maiden fan. the documentary dvd is 40 min, short but interesting, ""12 wasted years"" is a classic documentary from 87', promo videos were already released on the visions of the beast dvd.",1364515200,,525,4.36734693877551
5540359,4,B00B0FQ8NC,"From what I understand Steve Harris directed and edited Maiden England.  To people who don't have the DVD yet, try to guess how many times this is mentioned in print and/or content with this set.  Okay, with my little, good humored jab out of the way (probably humorous only to myself), I can move on.

First off, why, oh why didn't they use the original Derek Riggs artwork for this set?  I plan to look for some custom DVD covers as I'm sure there will be a few.  Rest assured I didn't count that against the product in my rating, just find it annoying we got hamburger instead of steak when it comes to Maiden artwork.  Sadly, this isn't the only place where Riggs gets the shaft as you will see.

Disc 1

Nice motion menu of the cover artwork with music and transitions as with the previous ""History"" releases.

Maiden England - The concert itself looks amazing!  The picture is unbelievably clear, especially for a video of it's time.  They did a great job cleaning up the video, and the sound is spectacular (at least for the LPCM, I don't do 5.1 audio, sorry).  I'm sure people will complain about the often blurry picture, but that is a result of video filming a very dark stage, and not shabby remastering.  It's also nice to finally have the complete show with the three songs that have been added, as well as a bit more banter from Bruce.  It always felt like a short set to me, glad to see I was right.  Disc 1 is perfect.

Disc 2

The same menu screen as Disc 1.  I was hoping it would get the Live After Death treatment of two different backgrounds for both discs, but no biggie.

""The History of Iron Maiden..."" is a bit of a letdown for me, though what is included is appreciated.  The history doc is short (and actually feels cut off right when it starts to get good), but has some nice tidbits.  I'm okay with that, but the way Part 3 was produced is pretty bad.  Where the first two were done with class, this one feels like it was produced for kids with ADD, with constant movement and goofy effects disrupting the flow of the interviews, which take place in a small box in the corner of the screen.  (There is a warning for those with epilepsy at the beginning of the disc).  My eyes were fatigued by the end.  Maybe I'm weird, but I like to be able to see the interviewee during the interview in full screen-size format.  All future viewings will probably be listenings only from me.  The other thing that makes this latest installment feel on the cheap is that only the 5 members of the band at the time and manager Rod Smallwood are interviewed.  It would have been nice to hear from Martin Birch, and others' reflections of the time.  I'd say bring back Matthew Amos who did the first two and ditch this Andy Matthews fellow, but from the ending it looks like Andy will be producing the next one as well.  Ugh!

12 Wasted Years - I haven't seen this since I loaned my VHS copy to somebody, who then proceeded to loan it to someone else (don't you hate that?).  I'm surprised at how much I forgot.  This documentary may seem a little redundant with the other History DVDs available, but if you skipped out on the Early Days DVD 12 Wasted Years will fill you in.  It's a good doc with many funny moments and a lot of songs seen on the other sets.  We have two special performances not completely seen on previous DVDs.  ""Sanctuary"" from the Hammersmith '82 show and the (in)famous 1985 Dortmund on-stage slaying of Eddie during ""Iron Maiden.""  I'm really happy to have these again.  There are chapter breaks, but no chapter selections menu.  It's better done here then on History with only 2 or 3 breaks.

And, of course, promo videos from both ""Somewhere In Time"" and ""Seventh Son of A Seventh Son,"" which for some reason look worse quality-wise than the older promos we have seen thus far.

Now for the sad part - no galleries!  No pics, no memorabilia, no tour programs - and probably the worst omission, no artwork from Derek Riggs!  WTFill in the blank?  Maybe it was a space concern because of 12 Wasted Years, but, boy does it feel like the bonuses are lacking.  There was so much cool artwork other than the albums and singles from this era that I can't help feeling like this set isn't complete.  Also, no easter eggs like the first set in case anyone was wondering.  Too bad there wasn't much live footage from the ""Somewhere In Time"" tour legitimately filmed, as that might have warranted 2 separate releases which could have included more morsels for us hungry enthusiasts.  Thank goodness for bootlegs!

The DVD does include a good sized poster (again with the cover art) with liner notes from the original VHS releases, and other info, such as Steve Harris directed and edited Maiden England - I had no idea!

On a side note, this DVD set will mark the final appearance of Clive Burr (footage only) who, sadly, succumbed to MS exactly 2 weeks before it's release here in the States.  In memory of Clive, I've enjoyed what he has done for music, and I can only imagine what his impact was on those around him.

All in a all, another very good release that only seems to fall short of the mark because the standards were so high for the previous entries in the series.  Hopefully, the next release isn't delayed as long as this one was.  I look forward to Part 4.  Just get a different producer for the history doc, and include all the artwork missing from this set for crying out loud!",1364342400,17,5421,4.410282258064516
5540360,4,B00B0FQ8NC,"For anyone like me who saw this tour in 1988, it's nice to finally be able to revisit Maiden at the height of their fame and musicianship.

The second is that the new documentry seemed to be hurried. They seemed to have lost focus on this package. The 2 prior packages were AMAZING. I think they could have spent a little more time and made it better.

Remember I am a fan and hate writing this. The concert is great and I've been waiting for this to be released for year I just wanted it to be perfect like EVERYTHING else the Maiden has released. Hopefully thet release the 2012 version of the Maiden England Tour on Blu-ray.

5540362,5,B00B0FQ8NC,"Call me sad, but I currently have flights booked and eight tickets for shows on the European leg of the Maiden England 2013 tour. I saw the show when it came to my city and being first to the barrier was nothing short of amazing. But considering one of the shows in particular I have a ticket to- Donington in particular- is an extra special occasion as it's a 25th anniversary show, it'd be a sin to miss it. The 1988 show at Donington Park in Derbyshire, UK was a massive event- the band played to a sold crowd of an estimated 100, 000. Of course, there was a tragedy early in the afternoon- two kids died from an incident in the crowd, and that shook the people up. Yet even still, the sheer response from the crowd was a big event for Maiden, as Maiden they'd headline that park four more times. And it was all thanks to the support tour for Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, aptly titled Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour.

The tour was the band's biggest in a long time- since the World Slavery Tour that ran for 11 months and 193 shows, the band's tours became more bombastic and theatrical. This tour would represent the iceberg artwork that decked Seventh Son, meant to look like a frozen lake with icebergs and a mountain in the background. Of course, it's no secret that Bruce Dickinson was critical of the post Powerslave tour sets and even Steve Harris was critical of the STOAST set:

""We thought the Seventh Son stage show just got a bit out of hand. I mean, the actual Eddie and the backdrops I thought looked amazing, but the giant icebergs and stuff were a bit naff, I think [...]""

In addition, the road crew hated the icebergs and all the white that covered the stage, as they were nigh-impossible to keep clean. Yet even these stated facts didn't stop the band from going on to document the 1988 tour. On November 27th and 28th, the band played two massive, sold out shows to the Birmingham NEC, which were filmed and recorded for a DVD/CD release. Whereas Rod Smallwood had complete control over Live After Death, Steve had control over Maiden England- his aim was to depict the show through the eyes of the crowd. And boy, does it work well here. There's very few drum kit shots or from the stage shots- the 90% of the show can be seen from the barrier, the balconies, the stands, etc. It's very effective, and at times has a bit of a bootleg vibe, as if it was pieced together from a number of camcorders- this was all Steve's idea, and it worked brilliantly here.

THE SHOW
The band's performance is on fire here, as they usually are. Bruce had the flu and it's very obvious in his singing, but he still puts on a hell of a show. He still runs and jumps about, messes with the crowd and even plays with a Sooty puppet at one point in a Welsh accent! The key performer on this package is Dave Murray- I've always been biased as his more classical style of guitar was what drew me to Maiden's guitar playing in article, but here, he's must insane. His solos, particularly ""The Prisoner"" are just killer. He also runs and jumps about the stage, just like Janick too! Nicko is playful as he always is, and Steve is just bundles of energy personified. This may not be the best performance of theirs, but it's proof that the band has what it takes to never disappoint.

The band storm through a 110 minute set that begins with ""Moonchild""- a burst of pyro goes off and the band are in full-on mode. The usual theatricality is there- tons of pyro (gerbs, fireballs, even an Eddie's head on fire), and lighting that sets moods that range from ominous to mystical. There's the usual two eddies- the first makes an appearance during ""Seventh Son of a Seventh Son"" that looks like a scribe, and the second being the usual big Eddie in the style of the SSOASS artwork.

Special attention must be drawn to the added encores- in the original release, they weren't featured as of people already had the songs, but here they're back and in full form. The encore begins with ""Run to the Hills"", which takes care of itself as it always does. Next is ""Running Free"", which is always fierce and fiery, and the band does the usual ""slowing things down near the end and letting the audience sing along"" thing they usually do. Last up is ""Sanctuary"", and let's just say, this easily justifies the purchase of the DVD. It's as fast and fierce and fiery as it usually is, but one particular part that raises hairs and sends chills is when the lights flash red and blue (emulating police lights) and has the crowd mock the police sirens. Just goes to show you his true showmanship!

AS FOR THE REST OF THE DVD...

The 5.1 DTS track is the reason to buy the DVD. Mixed by Kevin Shirley, it sums up why I always prefer DTS tracks to Dolby and the sound is just loud, grand and epic. Excellent use of the back speakers with tons of dynamics you can practically breathe in- it'd be a crime not to watch it with the DTS track. As for the special features, the 40 minute documentary does pale compared to the 60 minute one on Live After Death and the 90 minute one on The History of Iron Maiden Part 1: The Early Days. But it's nonetheless entertaining and covers the synth era in 40 minutes- but the most compelling part is when it ends on a chilling cliffhanger where Adrian says bluntly into the camera, ""I wasn't happy with it at all... and then a year later, I wasn't in the band"". Bring on the Donington Live 92! The 12 Wasted Years documentary is featured, which is fun to watch, and the promo videos for the hits from both Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son albums, which you most likely already have on Visions of the Beast.

In closing, Maiden England '88 is the perfect way to revisit a beloved era for all Maiden fans, and for a number of reasons too. For one, the complete show is available for the first time ever, and it also is just nice to have the show on DVD, PERIOD. Yeah, it does kind of suck there's no blu-ray release, but considering it was shot on video, chances are it wouldn't translate. Either way, this is money well spent! For old fans, it'll be a lovely trip down memory lane, and for the new fans, it's the perfect way to open the door to an era that's considered to be a staggeringly interesting one by even the outsiders.

Now, the only thing left I have to say?

UP THE IRONS!!!!",1364256000,7,6316,4.348600508905853
5540363,4,B00B0FQ8NC,"Maybe I'm old school, but I miss the Maiden classic line-up. This show is the Mighty Maiden during the tail-end of their extended musical peak. As many of you all know, a few short years later, we'd lose Adrian, then Bruce, and by the time these guys returned, Iron Maiden were a band of 6. Still rocking and going strong, they're simply not the same as they were.

But the best reason to buy this DVD release, is the concert editing of years past. How I miss the days when camera angles were limited and shots lingered enough for my eyes to actually focus on the image. Steve Harris, notorious for hyperkinetic editing, apparently took the reigns on this one, but it may have been one of his first projects and he certainly didn't go nuts (like he has in videos of late). For example, its refreshing to actually see Dave and Adrian strut their stuff during their solos instead of seeing an unnecessary split-screen close-up of Nicko's bare feet during that time. Watch this video in comparison to En Vivo, and you'll understand, what I'm referring to. It's such a pleasant change. Yeah, it's in lack-luster ""standard def"", and presented in 4:3 aspect ratio, which to me is the worst part, but I'll take these shortcoming over the ADD editing anyday!

As for sound quality, the concert audio itself is a little disappointing, particularly the 5.1 surrounds of both the Dolby Digital and the DTS. I honestly expected better. Not knowing what they had to work with as a source, all I can tell you is that it certainly doesn't impress like modern day recordings. No speaker work-out here. If anything, I actually found the PCM stereo mode to be the most enjoyable and a step-up from my VHS version.

Lastly as for the extras, I always enjoy the ""History of Maiden"" installments, as they give us a nice if not nostaglic look at the days long past and a peek into what the band was feeling and thinking back then. I don't think this one was done as well as Part 2, (This one has an over-abundance of slide-show style pictures of the era) but it was still fun to watch. Oh, and you get a nifty folded poster too, great for your bedroom wall if your like...uh..twelve!!

Overall, a fantastic effort. Not quite full stars due to the lackluster audio, but still worth every penny. Cheers!

UPDATE: I've since been able to significantly improve the DOLBY DIGITAL audio quality by changing the settings on my PS3 to output in ""bitstream"" rather than PCM, thereby allowing my receiver to do the decoding. Big improvement. But DTS and Stereo options were not affected by this change. (Since I watch Blu-ray 99% of the time, I have my PS3 outputting in PCM since it's the only way to obtain lossless HD audio. Bitstream output from PS3 will give you truncated data from an HD source such as blu-ray's DTS-Master Audio. However, you'll get the full bandwith of anything (DD or DTS) encoded onto just standard DVD).

MAIDEN ENGLAND '88 Complete Fan DVD
Now available for the very first time on double DVD, this live show was filmed across two sold-out nights at Birmingham N.E.C Arena, UK in November 1988 during the band's ""Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son World Tour"". Disc one contains the concert which has been specially upgraded and extended from the existing 1989 longform VHS release and now includes three previously unreleased encores: Running Free, Run To The Hills and Sanctuary thereby completing the full concert with a total running time of 110 minutes .

Maiden's own Film Producer and Director Andy Matthews went back to the 1988 edit and painstakingly remastered each shot digitally; colour correcting and grading to give the image the best possible look from that time. As well as the VHS stereo sound track by Martin Birch, the band's producer between 1981 and 1993, the DVD also includes a brand new 5.1 audio surround mix by Maiden's current producer Kevin Shirley.

The concert was meticulously directed and edited by bass player and founder member Steve Harris, so as to capture the performance from a fans-eye view of the stage, focusing fully on the music, the elaborate stage production and the lighting. Add into the mix an electrifying set list and of course Eddie, and Maiden England now offers a snapshot of a bygone era in which the band, as they continue to do today, devote their all in delivering the ultimate live experience for their fans.

Disc two is an extensive bonus disc featuring an exclusive documentary charting Part 3 in the History of Iron Maiden. This 40-minute film comprises recent interviews with the five band members and manager, Rod Smallwood. Picking up the story in the aftermath of the '84/85 World Slavery tour, this interesting and insightful documentary sees the band speak candidly about their memories of an exciting and occasionally turbulent period from which would emerge the albums Somewhere In Time and Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. As the Eighties began to draw to a close, so did another chapter in Maiden's compelling history.

Other special extras on the bonus disc include Twelve Wasted Years. First released as a longform VHS in 1987 and available for the first time on DVD, this documentary runs for 90 minutes and includes archive interviews and dynamic live footage from the band's beginnings in the now legendary Ruskin Arms pub, via London's Marquee club and three World Tours. Five promo videos for the singles from the aforementioned albums are also featured and have been carefully restored and improved upon from the original films using the very latest software with the audio remastered in digital stereo.

5540375,1,B00B0FQ8NC,"I am sorry but I have to confirm that this release is very poor, both where audio and video are concerned. I have three different releases of Maiden England including this particular one, which is the worst by far. I am talking about the 2003 ROOM 101 Entertainment release.

Let's be quite clear for all you guys who don't know the product :
Maiden England is arguably (IMHO) the best pro-shot Maiden gig ever. 'Arry spent many hours producing and choosing the best scenes from those 2 days at the NEC. (I remember him saying that he spent hours synchronizing images from Nov. 27th with the soundtrack of the 28th, because the solo bit in Killers wasn't shot exactly the way he expected on the first night)

The problem is : Maiden England was offically released in VHS in 1994, along with an audio CD. The quality of the CD is stunning (LPCM for sure), but it's audio only and 2 tracks are missing (ie Can I Play with Madness and Hallowed Be Thy Name).
Maiden England was unofficially released on DVD ; this is the present product : Image is mediocre and sound is terrible (compared to the official release)

The third release is THE one so far and by far: it is an obsolete format called CDV or LD (compact disc video or Laser Disc) which was released in 1989. A CDV was a 2-sized disc, the size of a vinyl LP with the colour of gold. If by chance you ever get a multi-disc player from the late 1980's, try to get this Maiden England CDV. Image is absolutely perfect and sound is AC3... not LPCM but so much better than the sound on this crappy DVD.

But most probably the best is yet to come : I'm sure Steve Harris is gonna release a Blu-Ray for that one pretty soon. Be patient enough to eventually get a quality product and not to get screwed with this one.",1306108800,,1764,4.3202416918429005
5540376,5,B00B0FQ8NC,"This is gonna be a short and sweet review, so...

Maiden England is Iron Maiden's England gig duirng ""Seventh Son of a Seventh Tour"" in 1989. I downloaded Maiden England via Ares.

ME is their best, IMO. It starts with Moonchild, and ends with Iron Maiden. I'm even surprised they performed ""Killers""! The stage theme is an Iceberg. You gotta love the slideshow at the beginning, and Bruce's ""Teddy Bear"" thing on stage before ""Infinite Dreams""!

This is a must-have for any maiden fan. Up the irons!",1196726400,,500,4.724137931034483

Product Description

British metal meisters Iron Maiden are filmed before an audience of over 100,000 in their native England now presented in DVD NTSC/ALL REGION format in slimline case. Performing in Donington on their ""Seventh Son of a Seventh Son"" tour, Maiden perform a set that last over an hour and a half, impressing their loyal and enthusiastic fans. Tracks include classics like ""The Evil That Men Do,"" ""Prisoner,"" and ""Moonchild.""

=====

While it is true that Iron Maiden did play the Monsters of Rock Festival at Castle Donington on August 20th, 1988, and there a film (long since out of print) of their performance at the Monsters of Rock Festival on August 22nd, 1992, called ""Donington Live 1992"", this isn't a film of either of those shows. This DVD is a mediocre recording of the original VHS tape named ""Maiden England"" released in 1989. It was filmed at the Birmingham National Exhibition Centre (NEC) in Birmingham, England on November 27th and 28th, 1988.

You guys really should watch these DVD's before you review them. It makes you look rather unprofessional to write a review for something you obviously have not seen. And incidentally, I gave this DVD a 4 Star rating not for the quality of the DVD, but for the performance of the band. I actually am not that impressed with this DVD. My original 1989 VHS tape has better sound quality, so what does that tell you?",1145404800,4,1522,4.724528301886792

This is a great concert filmed in Burmingham November 27-28, 1988 during their ""Seventh Tour Of A Seventh Tour"". My first Maiden concert was ""Somewhere On Tour"", and this concert was during the subsequent world tour. The band, and Bruce in particular, were firing on all cylinders. Bruce runs around the stage like a man possessed, but very much with purpose and all the grace of an avid fencer. The song selections are great, with six songs from the Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son album. Iron Maiden were at the top of their game during this performance, and you can tell how much they were enjoying themselves as they kept the crowd enthralled the entire time. Buy this, you won't regret it!

8560271,4,B00B0FQ8NC,Iron maiden videos are routinely some of the best video and audio quality you're likely to find anywhere in the music industry. The sound is great and the videos they release are nearly always clean without the haziness or distorted  views you'll find in lots of other bands videos. Usually only the long standing headline bands have the right people  who know how to record good quality concert footage.these guys have obviously been well trained in their fields  of work and years of experience doing high quality work that's lacking in more recent band videos on a regular basis.sadly even my main man Ozzy had some  videos released that were so bad in overall audio  and video that left me stunned  at the poor quality of them even compared to some he released back in the Sabbath years. Iron maiden is totally dedicated to being the absolute best they can be at every single show  they do..They don't get that old go through the motions just another show out of a hundred assigned to their tour. When they step out on stage you're gonna get the best show they can possibly  give  they live to get the crowds rockin and singing and dancing from start to finish and they hold nothing back all night long no matter where it is. So If you love the Maiden you need to add this one to your collection. You'll hate yourself if you don't,1485993600,3,1334,4.5020746887966805
