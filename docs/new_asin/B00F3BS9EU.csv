5966047,5,B00F3BS9EU,"I missed the miniseries on TV and wanted something to watch with the family during Christmas break. My 14 and 17 year old sons and my husband all enjoyed this, much to my surprise. It is action-packed and fairly accurate. I'm sure a Bible scholar could find some errors but we didn't. Anyway, we looked forward to watching them each night.",1389139200,14,339,4.573770491803279

5966054,5,B00F3BS9EU,"I started reading my Bible, and I've been doing it pretty often. I started, from the Old Testament and sometimes as I read, I'm just like ""What??!"" I do realize the English is from centuries ago, but honestly some words just click and it's like ""Okay, I know what they are saying...other times No!"" I do attend church, but the Pastor's pick and choose what they'll speak on for the service of that Sunday. I want to understand the Bible completely and this DVD is very helpful. I encourage you all to get it.",1502841600,,508,4.414893617021277

5966068,3,B00F3BS9EU,Every person that reads scriptures will see things in their own way.  I for one don't whole heartedly  agree with some of the scenes in each episode as it is not true to form as it was written.  Overall it is a good storyline and worth watching.,1446076800,10,245,4.170212765957447

5966072,3,B00F3BS9EU,"It's okay for the person that just wants to see a movie about the Bible, but for the serious christian person is not good. The writers, editors, producers put, change, erase things at their will. They doesn't follow the lines or the times from the Holy Scriptures and this a major drawback.
The discs have exactly the same format as for the TV miniseries and at the beginning of each chapter there is a review of the previous chapter, a nuisance. The Spanish translator made a major flaw, the name for apostle James in Spanish is ""Santiago"" not Jacobo.",1428883200,21,552,4.585858585858586

5966078,5,B00F3BS9EU,"The message is not in the details of the story of Christ, but in the actions of Jesus. Yes, this version is not really faithful to the scriptures, but the message is still loud and clear. Jesus died for us and He saved us from eternal damnation through His love and His sacrifice. I used to think that this was one of the worst adaptations, but after deciding to watch it with my heart and not with my brain, I can now say that I saw His message loud and clear in my heart and soul.
A must have for all who want to know more about Christ, the history of the bible and the message of His love and salvation.",1404950400,2,606,4.016528925619835

5966088,3,B00F3BS9EU,"Okay, I saw the show on history channel and heard the history channel is longer and on the dvd set that there are scenes cropped from the 44o minute version, so I bought this thinking it is more, advertised at 480 minutes, but the christmas sleeve comes off and the same dvd set at 440 minutes, it says on the back, is what this is.  Okay, no big deal, I wanted some sort of copy on dvd and was impressed with the series,

I haven't watched this yet, but I am very sure it is not 480 minutes, I mean, why did they even claim that?  If I see something different I will post, but it doesn't look anything different, at least I paid a sale price and a few dollars cheaper than if I had bought it at a department store like wal mart.  I had recorded the show on christmas day on my computer dvr put on by history channel cause I was busy alot of the day helping make christmas dinner, they say the history channel version is longer, oh well, I'll have to review it later to see before I ever free up space during a deletion.",1389312000,6,1020,4.059701492537314

8611891,3,B00F3BS9EU,"After seeing all the interviews Roma D. and Mark B. had this sounded like a god series.  Don't buy  this  series if you are a Bible student purist.
