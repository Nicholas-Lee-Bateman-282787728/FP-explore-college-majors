8100556,5,B000CQQFLK,"I loved this movie the first time I saw it (sometime in the 1990s!).  I love the relationship between the brothers and how they manage to survive a relationship dynamic that generally tears people apart.  Matt's aimlessness as he searches for answers, Michael's initial inability to really understand where Matt is coming from, and Natalie's early acceptance of who Matt is blend together beautifully to create an emotionally satisfying tale where somehow, though bittersweet, everything turns out alright.",1405468800,2,506,5.4743589743589745
8100557,4,B000CQQFLK,"I have been waiting for some years for thisovie to come to DVD. I've had it save on my DVR for years and I finally could delete it.
This is a quirky drama from the 90's. I was a sucker for Brian McNamara, therefore instantly fell for this movie. There's also Elizabeth Shue and Dylan Walsh rounding out the cast. This is an easy watch with funny and tender moments.",1402963200,,365,4.228571428571429
8100558,5,B000CQQFLK,"Well written and performed, this film also explores the protagonist's relationship with Jesus.  His dialogs with Jesus - and the casting of the actor who plays Jesus - are brilliant.",1343606400,,182,5.066666666666666
8100559,5,B000CQQFLK,"This is the best movie ever not released on DVD. I don't need to rehash the plot because its all covered in the description here. Its just a fantastic movie that I no longer get watch because I don't have VHS anymore. Oh well, maybe it'll come out on DVD when the New Age does. What? You've never seen the New Age? Oh yeah, thats another great movie not on DVD.",1264809600,,361,4.098591549295775

8100561,5,B000CQQFLK,"After a long time, I saw the movie and cried.  It was crying, when I had noticed it said whether it is negligent.  My favorite movie increased by one again.  If such a great movie can be encountered, continues seeing a movie from now on, and it will go.  Music was able to make me cry intolerably.  Since I wanted to buy a sound track, although I searched in Tokyo and New York, I was not found.",986860800,2,395,4.077922077922078
