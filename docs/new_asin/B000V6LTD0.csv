Having said that, and there is no excuse for it whatsoever, the movie itself is not bad.  The next-to-last scene was too much for me, which probably means that you will love it.  But one of the reasons that I love watching old movies is that they exist as an objective and undeniable witness to the fact that the population were not once delusional, as they have been since the 1990s.  Today, feminism has proposed the utterly ridiculous notion that women who engage in sex work are ""victims.""  This movie presents them as predators, which may or may not be true (the answer may well lie in the middle), and at least testifies to a time when Americans were not as stupid as they are today.",1519516800,3,771,4.478571428571429
8216853,5,B000V6LTD0,If you skip ahead during some boring parts it's a really cool movie. Lynn is stunning...she could have been a real movie star.,1505692800,2,126,4.521739130434782
8216854,4,B000V6LTD0,"For 50+ years ago this film was hitting some touchy subjects. The first of it is narrated in a sinister tone. Not a sex worker positive swing. The mid and end are showing fetish and lesbian with a lighter tone. The twist is the ending....
This film strikes me as a advanced film school project. [Final exam, Theseus] sort of thing.... Mid 60's and all.",1505174400,6,352,4.430769230769231
8216855,1,B000V6LTD0,"For the life of me, I can not understand why Amazon is paying money for these movies.  The company buying up the rights to these old movies are editing them to a PG rating.  In 1965 these are risky films, but in 2017, there is no excuse to edit the movies like this.",1504051200,11,266,4.0
8216856,2,B000V6LTD0,I didn't realise it would be in black and white.  I thought it would be a little more light hearted.,1423526400,3,100,4.0
8216857,2,B000V6LTD0,"This one looks good, read the synopsis and it sounds like a fine addition to your exploitation collection, so you invest some hard-earned bucks on it and guess what? It sucks, from beginning to end - boring plot (not like we buy these things for their plots,but...), not enough nudity, and the babes aren`t much to look at either. I watched the entire flick w/ the fast-forward button activated after the first ten minutes. Do yourself a favor, and skip this one - the box is the only thing it`s got going for it. And maybe the booklet, if you want to know about more bad movies...",1251244800,11,581,4.4392523364485985
