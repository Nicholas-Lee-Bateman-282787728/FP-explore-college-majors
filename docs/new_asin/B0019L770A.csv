3437904,5,B0019L770A,"The mafia is a subject that has captivated the imaginations of both Hollywood and moviegoers alike for years and years. Generally, when the mob is chosen as the topic for another movie, assuming the film is done with the proper attention and care, it's pretty much a guarantee that there will be the potential for plenty of money flowing in at the box office. Many of the most successful mafia-themed movies rank amongst some of the best films Hollywood has ever offered to the public. With entries into this particular film grouping including some of Martin Scorcese's classics, such as ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", to Sam Mendes' ""Road to Perdition"", and even on TV with HBO's ""The Sopranos"", it's no wonder this is a sub-genre that has lasted for so many decades; however, as great as all of those titles are, there is one trilogy of films that truly set the bar for what all others would be compared to. I'm referring to none other than the best of the best of the mafia film sub-genre...The Godfather trilogy. To kick things off lets talk about the one that started it all, the original classic film in director and co-writer Francis Ford Coppola's gangland magnum opus, ""The Godfather"".

""The Godfather"" focuses on the fictional Corleone crime family. The family, as led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), vies for money and power amidst the dark world of organized crime. Set in the years following the Second World War, Don Vito Corleone is offered a chance for his family to further expand their empire via the fledgling, yet profitable drug trade. However, the Don is not convinced that this is the way their organization should take for more profits, a school of thought that the other rival families aren't too comfortable with. As tensions mount and battle lines are being drawn, Don Vito along with his sons, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo, and consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), prepare to do what must be done to preserve the power they have fought so long and hard to attain. As an all-out mafia war begins to claim casualties on all sides, it seems some new blood may be needed to turn the tide. Enter Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), the youngest of the Corleone children, and the one who had vowed to steer clear of the dark world that has consumed the rest of his family. However, certain events are unfolding that will force Michael to choose whether his destiny lies by his father's side or on his own path separate from a life of crime.

Based upon the novel by Mario Puzo, who also served as co-writer alongside director Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" is one of the most faithful adaptations of a book that I have ever seen. Having read the book and seen the movie, I find both to be perfect companion pieces to one another. Even though it is cemented within the dark underworld of organized crime, the story is one that can resonate with virtually every person on some level, thanks in no small part to the many themes inherent within the screenplay and the novel.

The biggest theme that this film deals with throughout its nearly three-hour running time is the concept of family, displayed in both a literal and metaphorical sense (as shown in the numerous references to a person's mafia affiliation and/or organization as a family). For me this was the most intriguing aspect of the film's richly layered story. Seeing how the various Corleone children grappled with the weight of eventually taking the reins of the family's various affairs, both personal and business related, was truly interesting and provided the strongest dramatic firepower for the script to draw from. For me, making the primary driving force of the screenplay focus upon the family aspect, made ""The Godfather"" stand apart from all other mafia themed movies that had come before it, and many that arrived after it, for that matter. Many times in these types of films we get a very violent story, full of intense drama and plenty of colorful language, and even some allusions to the themes found in this film, but it seems to be a bit of a rarity to find a mafia movie outside of this series that takes the time to delve deeply into the personal relationships these people establish over the course of their lives and nefarious careers as criminal figures. We all know that the mafia is all about loyalty, respect and living by certain codes of honor, but what we rarely get to see is where those attributes come from, which can only be found in the personal relationships these characters share with each other over the course of the film. To me, it is the personal touches found in this movie and its sequels that make the story all the more accessible, and elevate it from being just another mafia movie to something far greater.

The casting choices made for ""The Godfather"" seem to perfectly embody every single character from Mario Puzo's classic novel, as if they could have walked right off of the page and onto the screen. Marlon Brando (""Superman: The Movie"") as the Corleone family's patriarch and Don of the Corleone crime family is simply iconic in his portrayal. He brings a warmth and magnetism to the character that instantly draws you in, essentially erasing all thoughts of the evil acts this man has committed either personally or via his organization. Yet behind the almost grandfatherly quality Brando gives the character, lies an extremely dangerous man, who possesses a quiet and powerful inner-strength, along with a worldly power that is unparalleled by any other member of the underworld.

Portraying the other primary members of the story are veteran actors (although at the time they were still rising stars in Hollywood) James Caan (""Misery""), Robert Duvall (""Secondhand Lions""), and Al Pacino (""Heat""). James Caan plays the hot-headed eldest son of Vito Corleone named Sonny, who is first in line to take over the family business whenever the Don steps down or passes on. Caan perfectly portrays the character with a dangerous volatility that is electrifying and borderline insane at times, yet he also brings to the table an unyielding devotion to his family that is both his greatest strength and biggest weakness. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen the surrogate son and consigliere to the Corleone family, seems an ideal choice lending the character plenty of gravitas, while at the same time giving a sense that he is constantly seeking approval from the other members of the family due to him being of German/Irish descent, and therefore an outsider to the otherwise Italian family. Lastly, we have Al Pacino, giving his most restrained performance of his career, long before he became the iconic actor he is today, as the youngest Corleone sibling and the one member of the family that tries his hardest to remain at a safe distance from the crime and corruption that has consumed the other family members. So, in a sense, even though Tom is an outsider due to his heritage, it is Michael who is the one that is truly the outsider, a position that he finds harder and harder to retain the more the story unfolds.

Other cast members worthy of note would include Talia Shire (""Rocky""), Diane Keaton (""Because I Said So""), and John Cazale (""The Deer Hunter""). To be fair there are so many more actors and actresses that deserve attention, I just don't have the time to devote to them. Talia Shire played Connie Corleone, the lone girl amongst the Corleone children. Talia does a very good job with her character, even though she isn't given a very large amount of screen time. Nevertheless, if it weren't for her character's involvement many of the major events within the story never would have come to fruition. So, even though she possibly has the least amount of time in front of the camera, out of the entire family, her character's story arc is one of the most pivotal ones of all. The always terrific Diane Keaton is Kay Adams, the young woman who finds herself inadvertently dragged into this dark world through her romantic relationship with Michael. Diane gives Kay an innocence that balances the otherwise corrupt nature of essentially every other character within the film; however, it's fascinating to see her character's temptation by the power and money that accompanies such a dangerous world. To see how Kay grapples with the person she is and the person she may become via her romance is interesting, and provides some very small, yet important moments within the film. Rounding out this particular grouping we have Fredo Corleone played by rarely seen actor John Cazale (""The Deer Hunter""). Fredo is the middle child of the three Corleone boys, and is generally perceived as weak and relatively simple-minded in the grand scheme of things. Even though Fredo is given very little to do in this film, John is spot-on with his interpretation of the character, and it's a shame that an actor as talented as John clearly is, has for some reason chosen to shy away from movie roles ever since ""The Godfather Part II"".

It seems somewhat strange to me that a film such as ""The Godfather"" has become such a globally recognizable film and essentially a major brand name for games, toys, etc. I feel this is strange partly because of these films' subject matter (which could be perceived as a reflection on our dwindling morality), but also because this film almost didn't see the light of day, at least not in the way we all have come to know and love. Prior to anyone really being attached to this film, the head of troubled film studio Paramount Pictures, Robert Evans, was having a difficult time convincing anyone to direct this gangland epic after acquiring the rights to the novel. It wasn't until director Francis Ford Coppola (""Dracula"") took the gig, in an effort to save his fledgling production company, that the film truly began to take shape. Even so, if it hadn't been for Francis' stubbornness, Italian heritage, and cinematic vision, who knows what this film would have ended up as, most likely it would not have been the masterpiece it wound up being, that is if the attempted studio tampering had prevailed. So, thank God for directors who know what they want, and have the courage to see their vision through.

With a gripping story rife with powerful thematic elements, intense drama, and some of the best acting you will ever find in any film throughout history, ""The Godfather"" is a film that truly defines what it is to be a definitive tour de force of American cinema. If you have yet to see this film or its sequels, do yourself a gigantic favor and rent a copy today.

I have seen all three separate films and I cannot praise them highly enough.  But I am most interested in the Godfather Saga, with its combination of both films in chronological order and the inclusion of many deleted scenes that add a great deal of understanding to the plot and the characters.  I've only ever seen the Saga on AMC (i.e., A Million Commercials), and the constant interruptions stretch the running time out to 8 hours and detract significantly from the enjoyment of this landmark film.  To be honest, after reading so many confusing reviews and product descriptions, I am at a complete loss to know if the Saga is available in either DVD or Blu-Ray format ( I'm not interested in streaming it, because I want a permanent copy for my collection).

3437920,5,B0019L770A,"RELEASED IN 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" stars Marlon Brando as the aging don of an Italian mafia dynasty in the 1940s who decides to transfer control of his clandestine empire to his hesitant but formidable son, Michael (Al Pacino); meanwhile a gangster war breaks out between the five Mob families in the New York City area.

MAIN CAST: James Caan plays the tough son, Sonny; Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom; and John Cazale plays the weakest Corleone son, Fredo, whos basically exiled to Vegas. Diane Keaton & Simonetta Stefanelli play Michaels American and Sicilian babes respectively. Talia Shire appears as the hysterical sister of the Corleone family, Connie, and Gianni Russo her duplicitous, abusive husband. Al Martino plays Johnny Fontane, the singer of dubious talents inspired by Frank Sinatra.

Im not big on gangster flicks because its hard to work up compassion for protagonists who are criminal scum. I usually cant wait for them to be wiped off the face of the earth (or sent to prison for life, sharing a cell with Bubba). But, if you can handle this element, The Godfather is a great Mobster movie and one of the greatest gangster flicks ever. This is basically a drama with flashes of brutal, shocking hoodlum-oriented violence.

Highlights abound, starting with Brandos great performance, well displayed in the opening scene, and the awesome mid-40s ambiance. The restaurant sequence is suspense at finest. Other great scenes include the Beverly Hills horse bit; a rugged henchman unexpectedly garroted; Michaels rescue of his father at a deserted hospital (which is reminiscent of a similar sequence in 1968s Bullitt); the assassination in the reeds; the brief-but-potent love at first sight moment in Sicily; Sonnys beating the snot out of a deserving POS; the sudden explosive death of a loved one; the unexpected tollbooth sequence; Vito playing with his grandson in the garden with an orange peel in his mouth; and the baptism sequence juxtaposed with Michaels men carrying out their wicked deeds.

Whats the moral of the story? The ending tells all: Choosing a life in league with organized crime will turn you into a hypocritical, lying, murderous fool.

THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 55 minutes and was shot in the New York City area; Sicily; Las Vegas; and Beverly Hills, California. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo from Puzos book.

3437922,1,B0019L770A,"Warning: If The Godfather is one of your favorite films then what on earth are you doing reading one star reviews about it? Unless you are truly interested in hearing a dissenting voice and want to understand the psychology of my stance, I would suggest you pass me by. Don't say I didn't warn you.

First things first. Yes, technically, The Godfather is one of the finest masterpieces in the world of cinema. Yes, the editing is fluent and leaves you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Yes, the script is filled with clever lines and each character has his or her own distinct personality to add shading and color to the narrative (hot headed Santino, dim witted Fredo, level-headed Michael, mentally unstable Connie, stoic and diplomatic Tom Hagen, American-as-Apple-Pie Kay, etc.) Yes, the cinematography is beautiful in its shades of earthy tones--brown, green, gray, sepia, etc.) Yes, the music is filled with sweeping romantic melodies. In short, the film deserves every bit of its iconic status from an artistic perspective.

And yetthe STORY IN ITSELF never fails to give me an elephantine case of TEETH GNASHING because of the absence of a SINGLE ADMIRABLE CHARACTER!!!

If you look beyond its technical brilliance what you get is a couple of three hour epics (Im speaking for the first two movies as I have no desire to see the third) centered around a group of thoroughly depraved people doing thoroughly depraved things and little or no depictions of good to contrast the evil and in the end you're left with a feeling of pointlessness and waste. Why should I root for the Corleones? Why should I desire to be a fly on the wall in their homes? Why should I want to hear all the conversations of Vito and Michael? Why should I want to see Santino and his mistress getting down to the nitty gritty just a few feet away from the wedding party where his wife is enjoying herself? Why should I want to see all the various operations of the family business? How does this help me gain a deeper understanding of the complexity of human nature or profound moral truths? How does this help me become a better person?

No. No. Im not one of these ignorant millenials who watches Transformers and plays Minecraft. Just look at some of the classic movies Ive given five stars to. (Its a Wonderful Life, Sunset Boulevard, Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia, etc.)

The sole purpose of any form of art should be the refreshment of the soul. It should add something to your life. It should affect you in a positive way. It should leave you feeling awed and inspired. It should give you something to take on your journey.

What makes To Kill a Mockingbird a great film was the strength of character Atticus Finch showed when he defended Tom Robinson in court. He knew he wasn't going to win the case from the get-go because he was defending a black man against a jury in the po-dunk deep South, but he still got out there and did his best because he knew it was the right thing to do. In other words, it was a lost cause but he met his foes in battle nonetheless as King Theoden in The Lord of the Rings would have put it.

What makes Casablanca a great film was how Rick chose to lay aside his disappointed romance for Ilsa and risk his life to save her husband.

What makes Its a Wonderful Life a great film was how Clarence didn't show up to make things perfect for George Bailey. Instead he encouraged him to adopt a better perspective on life by showing him all the good things he did for his family and friends and how it would be a great sin to throw it all away simply because of the dire straits of his circumstances.

What makes Citizen Kane a great film was how Charles compromised his moral fiber to become the richest man in America and when his dreams finally came true he looked back and realized it wasn't worth it--he was still the same restless, unhappy man because he didn't have his heart in the right place and all his accomplishments were a passing of the wind.

When there are so many uplifting and life changing films out there that encourage us to live better lives, that the American Institute of Films always puts The Godfather up in the top ten, simply defies the senses.
Yes, there should be some very sad and dark movies (like Citizen Kane) and they have their purpose but there are so many out there that are way more intellectually stimulating and worth your time than The Godfather.

The only reason I can think of as to why such an empty and worthless film continues to be praised by our media is because most film critics are afraid to go against the flow of popular consensus at the risk of seeming to lack good taste. I say, stop being so blinded by expectations and conformity and actually judge a movie for what it really is.",1504224000,,4771,4.497690531177829

I have already gone through one DVD and the one I have now is so scratched I'm afraid I'll need another copy soon. This is one of the most masterfully crafted and perfectly acted movies of all time. At almost 3 hours long, I enjoy every second of it and feel like every time I watch something new shows itself whether it be dialogue, scenes or something else. Such an amazing movie, it will always be my favorite and I can't recommend it enough. My mom scratches her head as to why I watch it so much, I scratch my head as to why she doesn't want to watch it.

3438021,5,B0019L770A,"The opening title and scene of ""The Godfather"" is one of the most striking in cinematic history. The lone trumpet invoking the tragic melody which has become so synonymous with this film is the equivalent of the tenor voice from an Italian opera, lamenting the loss of a loved-one in song, similar in style to a theme by Puccini or Verdi. Strangely, this sort of aria would have occurred towards the end of a traditional opera, usually at the death of the leading lady. But here the grieving music begins the story, as if tragic moments have already occurred, although they will continue to occur, a fundamental part of the story which is to follow. The beginning of the film is in actuality the middle of the larger epic of the Corleone family in America.

The first spoken words are neither from the Godfather himself nor from one of those in his inner circle. The voice is an outsider. He is not only an outsider of the inner Corleone family but someone not originally from America. The first voice we hear is an Italian immigrant, ""I believe in America."" This is a story about American immigrants, and how they have attained great financial and political power in the United States which might not be possible elsewhere in the world.

Based on the original book by Mario Puzo (who also co-wrote the screenplay), ""the Godfather"" lives up to its name as both a title referring to a specific character and simultaneously a position of someone wielding great power within a particular social context. When the film begins with Signore Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto who will be ever-remembered as the first voice and face of ""the Godfather""), the Italian immigrant requesting a favor from the Don on his daughter's wedding day, we assume the Godfather is Don Corleone (Marlon Brando), which is correct by and large. But as the film progresses, we see the rise of his younger son Michael Corleone who at first disassociates himself from the crime activities of his family. But even he cannot help but be dragged into the dealings of his family. By film's end it is ambiguous to which the titles refers, an individual person or a high-power position, not unlike a nobleman from the time of the Italian Renaissance.

Strangely, traditions are portrayed in this film which have their roots centuries before the incarnation of the United States. All the main characters, with the possible exception of Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), are Catholic-Italian. The church, presumably on the outskirts of New York City, is in an architectural style similar to the medieval Gothic cathedrals of France and Italy. At the wedding at the beginning of the film, Italian songs are sung with traditional instruments. Only when a Frank Sinatra-like character, Johnny Fontane (Al Martino), appears at the wedding, do we remember we're in America in the 1940's and not a little town in Italy in the 19th century.

""The Godfather"" chronicles several intertwined stories which was certainly highly innovative when it was produced. The very beginning of a plot concerns Sollozzo ""the Turk"" (Al Lettieri) who is a high-stakes heroin peddler who wants to use the Mafia families to sell his goods. He has already convinced the other Mafia families that drugs are the future but needs the Corleone family because of their political and law-enforcement connections. Don Corleone declines his offers at a meeting. But Satino ""Sonny"" Corleone (James Caan) makes a fatal slip, letting Sollozzo know there is slight ambivalence in the family about getting into the narcotics racket. Don Corleone becomes a target, and Sollozzo hopes by getting him out of the way, the Corleone family will reconsider their position on the illegal drug markets. Eventually this leads to an inter-Mafia war among the five New York families.

The other story concerns Michael Corleone, his relationship with Kay Adams, presumably a WASP, and his initially tenuous relationship with his own family. Although Marlon Brando was top-billed for the film and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone has much more screen time. The film is really Michael's story, about his gradual involvement in the family business. Several of the most memorable scenes involve Michael Corleone rather than Don Corleone, not the least of which occur in the home country of Sicily when Michael is in exile.

Maybe a dozen films in existence could be characterized as perfect, nearly flawless, from beginning-to-end: Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Gandhi, Schindler's List, and Malcolm X, are a few which come to mind. ""The Godfather"" not only deserves a spot, it may be at the top of the heap. Every scene, even every line, furthers story, character, and even the world of the Corleones. Each of the other actors aside from Brando and Pacino could have won an Academy Award for their efforts, including James Caan, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall. In fact, Pacino, Caan, and Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor, maybe the only time in film history three nominees from the same film were in the same category. ""The Godfather"" is one of the bona fide epic masterpieces of cinematic history, an opera without the singing.",1433808000,,5218,4.971363115693013
3438022,5,B0019L770A,"Writing a review on The Godfather is like walking down the tracks after the train's left the station. There's nothing I can say that anyone not living under a rock doesn't already know about this top 10 movies of all time (in my humble opinion). Actually, top FIVE. But that's another story. Very few Directors of modern times (being the last 40 years of the Film industry's 90 year existence) can be called prodigies. Most of the great directors we have, who have carved their own style and name in history were the product of evolution, hard work and lots of experience. The good old formulas for success (usually). But then there are a few, of a very, very short list, who were BORN with all the tools of pioneering cinematography innately in their soul, which oozes out through their pores as naturally as sweat on the beach. Coppola is one such being. Godfather 1 and 2, along with Apocalypse Now are eternal milestones that will be a gold standard for film study for many generations. Unfortunately, Godfather 3 left the planet with a complete reversal of all the natural laws of film making physics, natural and supernatural. Even more surprising, was Pacino's going along with the morphed aberration his character grew into for Godfather 3, which Michael Corleone would NEVER have done, while a great opportunity for Michael's character to atone for the murder of his brother was miss. But I digress. THIS film, and its successor are MUST HAVE, for any reason worth watching films for.",1433289600,,1493,4.790697674418604

I think that Goodfellas is a fine film (and i also own it) but The Godfather in my opinion is on a totally different level. I also feel that the cast in this film is better than the cast in Goodfellas (No disrespect intended) but seriously Marlon Brando,James Caan,Robert Duvall and Al Pacino how can you top that? Also this film did something that Goodfellas didn't they actually filmed part of it in Italy! ...I also feel that this film is much more complex than Goodfellas,things are planned out there aren't very many hasty actions being made (besides sonny's) people aren't getting whacked for any little thing instead there is strategizing and when people (who conspired or went against the family) get what they deserve it is done swiftly and efficiently. In ending i will say that although this film has many fine performances by Marlon Brando,James Cann & Robert Duvall...Al Pacino steals the show due to the transformation he makes as Michael Corleone.",1430956800,,1124,4.859375

3438031,4,B0019L770A,"What a great movie this is. It never gets old. The Corleone family's struggle for respect and recognition in modern America, and their attempts to hold on to their family values in the land of dog-eat-dog free enterprise, carries a universal message for all Americans. We all come from somewhere ethnically speaking, and we all need to question how much we have sacrificed our family heritage and origin in exchange for material comfort and upward mobility.

That said, the Blu-ray revision has lots and lots of grain in spots. For about 60 percent of the movie's running time, the grain creates a soft look that mixes well with the dark, saturated colors and dark tones. But at times you could probably watch the Blu-ray and DVD side by side and not be able to notice a difference. However, those dark and saturated colors pop like never before. Those dark tones, furthermore, are better balanced. Instead of a dark murk with medium tones, you can usually make out lots of details in shadow areas. When DP Gordon Willis intends large areas of his images to go completely black, the blacks are dark, rich, and even--as they should be.

If you love this movie--as so many of us do--you owe it to yourself to buy the Blu-ray version. My worry is that many consumers under the age of 30 will buy this cinema classic expecting bright, saturated color and razor-sharp detail and feel disappointed.",1430611200,5,1392,4.74793388429752

Seriously though, this is a wonderful movie. The cast of characters has been perfectly matched for this movie.

The story of how Michael tries to stay out of the family business yet is slowly drawn in is so poignant and touching.

You have Brando as the title character and a great cast of others who reveal the honor as well as the brutality of this lifestyle. However this film is not just about the violence. It is complex and fascinating in many other ways. Starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall, with director Francis Ford Coppola, this is possibly one of the greatest films ever. It begins at a wedding in the 1940s as Don Vito Corrleone takes care of some ""business"" as head of the family. All too soon it becomes evident that the Don is loyal to his friends and ruthless to those in his way. His youngest son Michael returns from the war and wants nothing to do with the business but at the same time conflict blows up when the family does not back a heroin dealer. When the Don comes close to death Michael finally gets involved. After a series of events he becomes head of the family and soon proves how powerful he can be.

3438144,1,B0019L770A,"""The Godfather"" contains more preposterous moments than any film I have ever seen.

Let us start with the central episode that determines the entire course of the story. It is the attempted killing of Don Corleone by the drug dealer, Sollozzo. Because of that, because Michael is the only one who can get close enough to Sollozzo to kill him, which is necessary to protect his father from further attempts, Michael, the son who was supposed to be a senator or governor, has to go into the Mafia. But from Sollozzo's standpoint, killing the don would have made no sense. He needs the Corleone Family's political influence to protect his drug racket and figures he can make a deal with Sonny after the don is dead. (After all, it's only business.) But while the don is in the hospital, wounded, Sonny and Tom Hagen discuss what they'll do if he dies. Hagen says that if he dies the family will lose its political contacts and influence. In other words, by killing the don, Sollozzo would have destroyed exactly what he hoped to get from the Corleone Family.

In the forty years since the film came out, am I the only one who has noticed that?

I don't want to make this review as long as the original novel. I will confine myself to two other examples. How come Fredo didn't go to his father's funeral? Because he was in Las Vegas? But Johnny Fontane was at the funeral. Fredo couldn't
have come back with him? The idea of a son missing his Sicilian father's funeral in that era is almost as preposterous as.....

.....How were they supposed to have gotten the horse's head in the bed without getting a drop of blood anywhere else in the room? If this was supposed to have been a movie like ""Airplane,"" that wouldn't have mattered. But this wasn't supposed to have been a movie like ""Airplane,"" was it?",1356480000,4,1800,4.529230769230769

3438163,2,B0019L770A,"I just bought and watched the individual Blu-Ray version of The Godfather (not the version in 'the collection').  I was shocked when the movie started to play. For all the hoopla over the 'meticulous restoration,' the movie is NOT presented in it's original aspect ratio!  In other words the movie is not as widescreen as originally presented.

Something seemed wrong early on, but it wasn't until some of the real wide shots - including the massacre of Sonny Corleone.  In the theatrical release and earlier DVD releases, these panaramas were breathtaking.  In this version they looked like a version you'd see on AMC.

What is even more offensive is that the movie included in 'The Collection' IS presented in the original aspect ratio!  Why would one blu-ray version be so botched in the individual disc than in a box set.  I'm amazed.  Shame on me for not reading the specs closely on all the discs before I bought the disc.

Having said that, the picture quality IS amazing and I was really happy with the overall restoration.  I just don't understand why Coppola would approve this altered version of his masterpiece on a Blu-ray release!

I may seem a little anal about this, but I buy DVDs and Blu-rays so that I have the closest possible version to the original.  This is one reason I hated pan and scan in the early days of DVDs.

Luckily the disc only cost about $13, so I can afford to give it away.  If you don't care about things like this, I totally recommend the individual disc. If are a purest, spend the extra $20 and get the collection so that you can see the film the way it was intended.",1332547200,2,1609,4.538194444444445

  If you're debating between the DVD and Blu-Ray Version of the film go for the BLURAY!. Reason is because I've read other reviews of certain scenes being kinda dark and I was worried it might be difficult to understand the film.

3438165,5,B0019L770A,"This is the chilling saga of the Corleone family's rise and fall from Sicilian crime roots to powerful criminal ties in the United States. Representing one of the leading crime families, two generations of Corleones struggle to maintain their grip. 'The Godfather', Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), is portrayed as an older man with sons Sonny (James Caan) and Michael (Al Pacino) taking an equal family position to non-Italian adopted son Hagen (Robert Duval).

Part I is a prequel to The Godfather Part II, yet stands as a completely independent story.

3438166,5,B0019L770A,"To say the Godfather is the Best movie ever is hard to disprove. The acting, music,costumes, and direction are flawless! Coppola went thru Hell to get the cast he wanted and the vision he wanted. Marlon Brando is at his Best giving a performance that verges on comedic without ever becoming laughable. Pacino, Duvall and Jimmy Cann are off the chain as three very different sons who are none as qualified as their father to take over the ""Business"".

My only criticism is why did they not put in English subtitles for whenever Italian is being spoken. For example, the scene in the restaurant where Michael Corleone shoots and kills the police captain and ""The Turk"" who wanted the Corleones in on the drug business has a considerable amount of Italian being spoken.

Francis Ford Coppola should have that done: English subtitles whenever Italian is spoken.

Otherwise, ""The Godfather"" is as remarkable and even more beautiful than it was in 1972 when it was first released and I saw it new in the theaters.

Additionally, though the screenplay has been written by Mario Puzo and Francis Coppolla even then the movie does not really fit the bill.

The acting is superb, from the major stars down to the bit parts, the dialogue is fantastically adapted from the book, and the cinematography is stunning.

3438187,5,B0019L770A,"I'm not going to review every aspect of this movie, or every member of the brilliant cast, just thought you might want to know that.

The Godfather is a masterpiece of film making, and was the end product of the skills, dedication and passion of many people, not just Francis Ford Coppola. I, unlike many die-hard fans, don't consider this cultural classic to be the greatest production ever to be crafted by human beings, but that doesn't mean i don't appreciate the sophistication of this pioneering American movie. The Godfather is more than just a mafia flick: it is an epic depiction of the American underworld and how that underworld straddles right beneath (or behind, depends on how you look at it) mainstream American society.

Members of the Corleone family - one of the most powerful and feared crime families in America - are basically living in a circle of lies and denial. The patriarch of this Italian-American family, Vito Andolini Corleone (played by the memorable Marlon Brando), brought wealth and power to the Corleone family and, therefore, achieved the American Dream - but only through intimidation, calculated greed and through shedding a lot of blood. As a result of accumulating an enormous amount of money and power, Don Corleone has successfully ""purchased"" many politicians and journalists; this tactic is still being implemented all over the world today by powerful individuals who obviously have no qualms about getting their hands dirty (or soaked in the blood of innocent people). As expected when a ruthlessly ambitious man involves himself deep into the blood-soaked and corruption stained pits of the criminal underworld, he will forever be chained to a world characterised by heartless, treacherous people that constantly conspire with each other - and against each other!

The Godfather has actually inserted some interesting questions into my inquisitive mind, questions like: How many Italian-Americans were/are involved in organised crime? Do the wives of the mafia dons know what their criminal-minded husbands get up to? And How would have Vito Corleone's father felt if he knew that his offspring had become one of America's most ""efficient"" crime bosses?

Vito Corleone didn't have to enter a life of crime to help him and his growing family escape the poverty-stricken ghettos of New York; he could have achieved the American Dream through honest, hard work, but, then again, The Godfather wouldn't have been The Godfather if he had chosen to lead a morally elevated life. I really do wonder how many of today's privileged and secure Americans lead prosperous lives as a direct result of their ancestors securing great wealth and power through bad deeds - including hurting innocent people.

Anyway, going back to the movie after slightly digressing, there is no one defining or spectacular scene or dialogue that places this movie into Hollywood's Hall of Fame; the whole movie has great scenes and dialogue that have shaped the way mafia movies are made - even to this day. It was comforting to know that Vito Corleone wanted his son, Michael Corleone (played by the hugely talented Al Pacino), to make a legitimate living...but fate would not allow it. Ironically, it would be Michael who would bring more wealth, more power, more connections and, yes, more fear to the Corleone family, but only by digging a deep - and darker - hole for the family in America's criminal underworld; sadly, maybe that's the easiest way for a rich and powerful family - that is already tainted by corruption - to get access to bigger vaults that house untold riches. The Godfather can indeed teach many people about how somethings really work and how believing that absolute power doesn't corrupt is as stupid as believing that a morbidly obese person shouldn't go on a diet.

There are so many shining factors that make this piece of historic and cinematic film making truly remarkable and special. And i really hope future generations of people (our descendents) also understand the different layers of this movie and appreciate the passion that went into bringing this movie into the world...and into our constantly active imaginations.

Oh, if anybody is interested to know, my ultimate favourite movie from this genre is Road to Perdition which, along with Cast Away, Tom Hanks gave one of his best performances in.",1294531200,,4351,5.05997210599721

It is a shame that this great movie got such a poor Blu-ray conversion so this rating goes to the Blu-ray conversion only.
I had the VHS set way back then, I still have the Godfather trilogy DVD set which called ""Godfather DVD Collection"" and it is excellent and very enjoyable. So I purchased the Blu-ray version of the Godfather and Godfather Part II and I am VERY DISAPPOINTED(Godfather Part III is an afterthought anyway and does not measure up to the first two).
I agree with every negative remarks on this conversion, although the bad film grain only noticeable on a few short cuts and it does not bother me too much but I do not like the excessive contrast throughout the film where all the sunlit outside takes are just plain terrible. All the highlights are completely washed out so this disk for me is a piece of junk. Unfortunately I took the seal and wrapping off from Part II and I cannot send it back to Amazon, so they just will sit on the shelf and collecting dust.
If you have the DVD version and purchased the Blu-ray like I did, do yourself a favor and put the DVD in a good upscaling DVD player and the Blu-ray version in the other one, play them at the same time the go back and forth and compare the two like I did. You will not believe how much the DVD version is better. They improved the sound output on the Blu-ray version so not only the front 3 speakers are on most of the time but all five+1, however you have to crank up the volume substantially to hear the voice parts while the other part become way too loud, so I do not like the ""enhanced"" sound output either.
If you have the DVD set and are thinking about to buy the Blu-ray versions just hang onto the DVD set which is just as sharp on my Onkyo upscaling DVD player as the Blu-ray with a lot better image quality, contrast and colors.

Blu-Ray has been out for years, but I've been slow to adopt it. Even once we got our Blu-Ray player (a Samsung for which I'll write a glowing recommendation another day), it took us several more months to get around to renting any Blu-Ray discs to view on it. The one Blu-Ray product that really motivated me was the Coppola Restoration. The idea of an *even better* version of two of the finest cinematic achievements of all time was a major selling point. However, now that I've finally seen the Blu-Ray version, I'm left to wonder if there's someone out there who sees any improvement in visual or auditory quality. What I see is the same image, possibly a little lightened up. It's no clearer. It's no deeper. It's no more saturated or nuanced. It is the same movie I already had on standard DVD, so nearly as I can tell.

If you're thinking it's my other equipment falling short, think again. We have a recent Samsung HD TV and Samsung BLP, and both are proven and highly rated. Neither is it a question of not being able to appreciate subtle enhancements; others in the household recently rented other Blu-Rays and were lavish in their praise of the improvements.

3438206,5,B0019L770A,"This is an incredible movie of great depth and artistry which always is entertaining and compelling. The themes of family loyalty, revenge, and the machinations of American business are developed within the framework o0f a great story. Francis Coppolla found his life masterpiece in this movie and it shows his brilliance from the opening scene.

Imagine yourself a movie critic about to get your first look at the movie. You would probably expect a fast paced violent opening consistent with traditional mob movies. Instead we get a dark frame gradually illuminated to see the face of the undertaker uttering his famous line: ""I believe in America."" What an audacious way to open the film, as he goes on to explain his need for revenge on the men who tried to rape his daughter. The response of the Godfather sets the tone of the film as he requires recognition of his authority before agreeing to dispense justice. (He refuses to kill the men, because ""We are not animals."") The Godfather's character is immediately established.

There are dozens of memorable scenes in this movie. The opening sequences, which run over 30 minutes, take place at the wedding reception for the Godfather's daughter, and serve as a brilliant framework to introduce all of the main characters. Within them are memorable scenes such as Luca Brasi practicing his talk to the Godfather, or Sonny confronting the police at the gates to the property, or a gangster with the snap of a finger having his henchman relieve a photographer of his camera and removing the film after taking the gangster's picture.

Memorable scene after scene follows, such as the famous horse head in bed scene, the shooting of the Godfather, and Michael's killing of a crooked policeman and rival mobster, among many others.

Few people comment on the interlude in Sicily, when Michael courts and weds a local girl. These scenes are both amusing and deeply romantic, and filmed with both simplicity and great subtlety where a simple gesture of a hand conveys deep meaning. Filmed with warm colors and great music, this part of the film is one of my favorites.

Also memorable is the scene of the Godfather playing with his grandson in the garden where he unintentionally scares the boy by pretending to be a monster, and then collapsing from a heart attack.

 Another favorite of mine is when Michael goads Carmine, his brother in law, into confessing that he had betrayed the family, then sending him unknowingly off to his execution. No other scene so clearly establishes Michael as the new head of the family business.

As surprising as the beginning, so is the ending with Michael's wife Kay looking through a closing door as Clemenza bows to kiss Michael's hand and address him as ""Godfather."" The look of resignation on Diane Keaton's face is unmistakable. (The closing door as an ending shot is lifted from the great John Ford classic ""The Searchers."")

No movie has had as many famous lines as this film. Just a few are:

""He made him an offer he couldn't refuse.""

""It's not personal...it's just business.""

""Leave the gun, take the cannolis.""

Even Kubrick, whose films I love, thought so.  I expected to be offended by a celebration of mafia violence and the underworld, but I was wrong.  It was serious, boring, and utterly pretentious.

Yes, the actors are good, but who can take this story seriously?  One commenter discusses the great drama of Michael Corleone's transformation from the 'good son' to the head of the family.  From where I sat, it seemed to happen instantaneously and without conflict.  Also puzzling was why his New England girlfriend, Kay, is so faithful to him through his desertion, despite being troubled by his activities.  Just WHO is she??  Then there's the Irish Tom Higgins - we are supposed to just accept that a non-Sicilian, non-ITALIAN is the chief advisor to a Don who puts family and community above all.  How multi-cultural!  Of course, we don't get a clue about what his odd position might mean to Tom.  He's a one-dimensional character like Kay.

I found the idyll during Michael's exile in Sicily laughable.  (Was the mistaken car-bombing of his wife a allusion to The Big Heat, in which Marlon Brando's sister plays a character who meets the same fate?) Apparently the pull of blood and soil is too much for a Corleone to resist.

I gave this three stars because if you like watching incredible melodramas with some well crafted rub out scenes, this if for you.  That is, if you entranced by the Mob, and can't get enough of it, this film will entertain as promised.  It's not incompetent or truly bad, but just vastly overrated by a public that for some reason gets a vicarious thrill out of watching savages live outside the rules (how tiresome) of society.",1255910400,4,1822,4.640625
3438221,5,B0019L770A,"I must admit I was a little scared to write this review because no matter what I write, no words can do this film justice. So, where to start? I believe in this film. Let's be clear, this in not a gangster movie. The Godfather is about family ('a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man'), it's about post-war America, and it's about a war hero, a good man's descent into darkness and solitary. Yet, it's so much more. The screenplay is amazing and the entire film is a huge quotable. An epic poem, a three hour masterpiece.
From the iconic opening scene to the scenes in Sicily to the gruesome murders, the audience is always in awe. Coppola put it perfectly when he said that it was the best home movie ever made. You feel like you are a Corleone. No matter what they do you feel they are justified and you agree with what they do. They are never the bad guys. Even Brando as The Godfather is always likeable. This man has killed so many and still you feel for this man. That's great writing.
The title of this film is The Godfather yet the movie is about the rise and the loss of innocence of Michael Corleone. Pacino shines and is always chilling. He's always thinking. He has distanced himself from his family yet when his father is targeted he's drawn into the center of the drama. The key scene of his transformation is always chilling. He stands outside of the hospital with Enzo the baker and is attempting to prevent his father from being assassinated. He succeeds and as Enzo attempts to light a cigarette, he cannot because his hand is shaking so much. Michael reaches over and lights it for him, he stares at his hand and sees that it is steady as a rock. The transformation was complete. Following his return from Italy, a conversation takes place between him and his father. We feel right at home. Vito tells his son that there wasn't enough time and that Michael was supposed to be more: A Senator or a Governor, the one pulling the strings. As Michael becomes Don and head of the family, we are almost disappointed for Michael yet we support him one hundred percent.
The acting is amazing and it always feels natural. I could literally talk about this film for days. In any time period, any country, this film is relevant. It is life changing and it is amazing. The film starts with the iconic words, ""I believe in America."" Well, this film represents everything America is about and I truly mean it when I say that I believe in this film.",1243728000,3,2483,4.411764705882353
3438222,5,B0019L770A,"Oh, so that's what they meant about swimming with the fishies. This movie is so embedded in our culture that you find references and allusions to it every where. It's a must see, or go through life not knowing what going to the mattresses mean or the importance of ""keep your friends close and your enemies closer,"" Marlon Brando's talent, Coppola's, Al Paccino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, James Caan, etc.

Also, I liked the DVD, looked clear and finely remastered to me. But sure, if they can do better, why not :)",1237939200,,518,4.630434782608695
3438223,5,B0019L770A,"The epic saga of a Mafia family, focusing on the youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), an honest war hero who is progressively drawn into the family business.

The mark of a great movie is that, even if you have no interest in the subject matter, the film is so well made that you are forced to like it, or at the very least appreciate it. ""The Godfather"" is one of those movies. In general, I do not like Mafia movies, and as a result, I felt certain that I would hate this movie, and yet, within the first 15 minutes of starting this film, I found myself drawn into the saga of the Corleone family.

It is virtually impossible to find fault with ""The Godfather"". Everything about it is perfect, from the script, to the acting, to the directing. Some negative reviewers have called this film boring, and I will admit that this film is slow moving, but slow moving does not translate into boredom. The pacing of this film is perfect for what it is and it allows the viewer to become fully acquainted with each and every member of the Corleone clan. The only factor that I would say could possibly prevent someone from watching and enjoying this film is the violence. Back in 1972, ""The Godfather"" was considered to be extremely violent, and even by 21st century standards, the violence is still intense and likely to distress some viewers.

The only bad thing I can think of about ""The Godfather"" is the unfortunate timing of its release. ""The Godfather"" was released in the same year as ""Cabaret"", another great film, resulting in the Academy Awards for that year being split between the two films (""The Godfather"" got Best Picture and Best Actor, while ""Cabaret"" got Best Director, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor). Both of these films are so good that they deserve all of the above mentioned Oscars (well, with the possible exception of Best Actress, since there was no lead actress in ""The Godfather""), and I just wish that they could have been released in separate years so that they could have achieved just that.",1237334400,2,2023,4.613888888888889
3438224,5,B0019L770A,"Countless critics believe that Citizen Kane is the greatest film of all time. While I do admire Orson Welles, I don't necessarily count Citizen Kane as my top favorite classic. Not even Lawrence of Arabia or Schindler's List or It's a Wonderful Life (despite being spectacular masterpieces in their own right) are at the top of my own list. So which film IS at the top? Well, take a look at the DVD cover on this Amazon page, and it should be very obvious . . .

This is Francis Ford Coppola's greatest work of art, and without a doubt one of the finest motion pictures to ever be released. It may be overrated by some, but to me, this is the one that will last a lifetime. I won't go into full detail of the plot, but I will tell you that the concept of mobsters being psychologically complex is particulary stunning (not only because it was highly unusual at the time, but because it makes everything in the film so unique). Scarface and Goodfellas had it good also, but this is the original that you ""can't refuse"".

However, those who have not yet seen this film and are expecting some typical Hollywood action and adventure will be highly disappointed. This is a drama film, but a brilliant drama film. The tension between characters, the atmosphere in every interior settings, the dialogue, the music, and the heavily brutal violence are almost perfect from beginning to end. The acting in this film is also extraordinary. Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Keaton, Vigoda, Lettieri, and Castellano give flawless performances. They're believable in their roles, and they never overact.

It's almost hard to believe that this was filmed with a low budget, but Coppola and his crew were able to pull it all off. Alongside The Godfather Part II, these extraordinarily iconic films will never accept extinction, and we fans will make sure that it never does.
