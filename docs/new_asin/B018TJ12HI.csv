7554494,5,B018TJ12HI,"this is another gut wrenching story of the horrors inflicted on a people simply because they were Jews.
To witness the hate from a medical doctor towards this young boy is unbelievable yet this is balanced by
the compassion from some of the Polish people which was truly heart warming.
I cannot call this enjoyable but it is most definitely necessary to remember.
I was very gladdened at the end - to see he was reunited with his sister and that he was a real success - professionally and family wise.
Just another proof that one can overcome just about anything if he so chooses.

7554530,3,B018TJ12HI,"Now there have been many movies and tv mini series in regards to the Holocaust. This is one that focuses on just one survivor. The movie is well written and well acted. I can not find any fault in that. If this had been the very first movie that I have seen in regards to the subject matter, I would have been impressed. But after a long line of movies from the Holocaust to Schindlers List, to Life Is Beautiful to the Boy in the Striped Pajamas, I found nothing new in this narrative that would make this movie unique.  It's redeeming value is that it is based on an actual account. I was totally impressed with both the boy's perseverance and luck. What really disappointed me is the ending. We get to see the adult survivor in Israel. We see his wife, his children and we hear about his success. Many Christians risked their lives ( one whose house was burned down in the effort to hide and save the boy.) But at the end he gave no thanks, no recognition to the literally hundreds of Christians who for those three to four years he was on the run protected him, fed him, clothed him, and saved him. I am sure that he was grateful but it would have been nice to hear it from him.",1463443200,6,1182,4.20704845814978

7554534,5,B018TJ12HI,"Based on the life story of Yoram Fridman I guess we are to assume this is his story when he was an eight-year old Jewish child in Poland during WW2 with Nazism all about trying to eliminate the Jewish people from their society. The director did an excellent job in portraying this child filled with very gripping and suspenseful scenes necessary to show the sick mentality of the Nazis. Through all this we see the child constantly struggling--surviving the harsh winter while sleeping in the woods; going from farm to farm to work for food and must go on to avoid capture; nearly died from a farm accident simply because the doctor had an hatred toward Jews and refused to give the boy the necessary medical aid; being betrayed by his own kind because of an agreement they had with the Nazis for cash which they didn't get.

The director also showed the intensity of this hatred they had toward the Jews. Here we have this young and fragile boy being chased all over by dozens of Nazis with dogs and with guns. Seeing this you would imagine they are hunting down a mass murderer instead of a little boy. It's unbelievable but reading from other sources on the Nazism atrocities clearly showed what I had read was clearly and accurately depicted in this film.

A great film! I applaud the director for an outstanding job..",1462579200,4,1322,4.5974576271186445

7554540,5,B018TJ12HI,"This is the most superb film on the Holocaust since Schindler's List because of the true story it provides about Jews who ran into the countryside instead of remaining in the Ghetto.  It was not a myth that some of those Jews were polish youth.
Indeed, some of them were very young like the polish boy Srulik.  The true story is superb in presentation due to the magnificent acting of two twin young boys - Andrzej and Kamil Tkacz - who are Poles.  Some heartbreaking truths are revealed how adult Poles ""sold"" Jewish youngsters to the Gestapo for bounty, betrayals of the Resistance, and cruelties of Nazi Occupation.  The film included absurd myths such as any person circumcised was a Jew?!  As a Polish Boy, Srulik begged for the kindness of other Poles in the countryside.  His faith kept him alive through some very harrowing incidents, surviving the winter, and living through the injury that resulted in the loss of his arm.  After the War ended, The Jewish Orphanage Society found him; before the war there were millions of Polish Jews, but at the end only a few thousand.  Now, Srulik was challenged to participate in the rebuilding of the Jewish Community in Poland.  This is an extraordinary true story of a Polish boy who endured - and worthy of compassion and praise for his courage.  In pursuit of my MA in Political Science, one of my major pursuits was the Nuremberg Code of 1947 which involved the review of several movies and documentaries about the survival of Jewish Youth.  The Producer Pepe Danquart has provided a film that is unique and the best I have ever seen about the countryside survival of a Jewish Youth named Srulik; a superb addition to any DVD collection.",1460937600,19,1691,4.698305084745763

7554561,5,B018TJ12HI,"Based on Uri Orlev's book, ""Run Boy Run"", this 2015 Polish-French-German production is a searing account of the wartime experiences of a young Jewish boy, who against all odds, survives the Holocaust during WW II. Srulik, the young boy in question, is compelled by his father to escape the Warsaw Ghetto, where Srulik and his family are held prisoner by the Nazis. Srulik's father's last words are to hide his Jewish identity but to never forget who he really is, a Jew. The young boy then embarks on a long adventure full of peril and hidden menace, all the while trying to survive.

The story unfolds against the backdrop of the bucolic Polish countryside, bucolic that is, until the Nazis turn up, looking for partisans and hidden Jews. The film portrays the Poles in an objective manner - some are kind and willing to risk their lives to keep the Jews safe (as evidenced by the Polish woman who hides Srulik and helps him to not only come up with a Polish identity, but also teaches him Catholic prayers so that he will pass as a Pole); a few others are shown to be opportunists who do not think twice about giving up a young child to the Gestapo all for a measly reward.

The young actors who portray Srulik (played by twin actors, Andrzej and Kamil Tkacz) do an incredible job of conveying the fear, horror, and uncertainty of living such a dangerous life on the run, while also displaying tremendous courage in the face of the evil Nazis. There are tense scenes throughout this film: Srulik or Jurek Taniak as he calls himself has to be constantly on the alert as a little carelessness could give him up as a Jew. Along his journey of survival, Jurek discovers the kindness of strangers and the evil in men, even men who are supposed to be life-saving doctors.

I have watched so many Holocaust films throughout the years, and this film stands out among a few as a compelling and memorable account of survival during a time of darkness. The film I cannot help comparing RUN, BOY, RUN to is FATELESS, a Hungarian film based on the novel by Imre Kertesz. Both films are recounted through the eyes of young boys struggling to stay alive against the unrelenting evil of the Nazis. The main difference here is that in FATELESS, the young boy is a prisoner in a Nazi camp, whereas in RUN, BOY, RUN, Jurek is ""free"", yet always fearful of being discovered and turned in. Both deal with young boys coming of age during the Holocaust, and both films are testaments to the human will to endure great pain and suffering, and to triumph against evil. I heartily recommend this film for those who are keen on viewing a well-made, thoughtful, and compelling Holocaust-themed film.",1457222400,29,2673,4.59958071278826

While ""Run Boy Run"" owes a great deal to ""Pelle the Conqueror"" (1987) and ""Europa Europa"" (1990), it independently astonishes with its own historical account of war-torn Europe and its upper-echelon acting and cinematography.

8742964,5,B018TJ12HI,"Watched this on Netflix the other day. This is a story about a Jewish boy incredible perseverance to survive the German occupation of Poland during world war 2. The movie accurately portrays the mentality of the Polish people during World War 2. Some went out of their way to save Jews. Some went out of their way to persecute the Jews. The rest didn't care, and were indifferent.
For those that love movies about survival against all odds. Then Run Boy Run is the perfect movie you.
Highly recommend it.",1494633600,,504,4.611111111111111
8742965,5,B018TJ12HI,"Being a Holocaust movie, Run Boy Run is another heartbreaking expose of mankind's capability for cruelty and depravity. It is based on a true story, which, in my view, always makes stories like these even more disturbing. However, the sheer determination of young Srulik to survive, the few hearts-of-gold adults who help him along his way, and a better ending propel me to say, watch and consider.",1493942400,,398,4.955223880597015
