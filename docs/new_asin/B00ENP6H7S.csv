8607126,5,B00ENP6H7S,"I cannot imagine anyone ever giving anything produced by The Collingsworth Family 1 star! If there were 100 stars, I would give every one of their projects 100! They are THE best southern gospel group ever. They've won numerous awards for Group of the Year, Kim for Musician of the Year, etc. If I had the money, I would travel the world and see everyone of their concerts! I promise, if you know good music, you will definitely not be disappointed in any music by them.",1483228800,,470,4.476744186046512
