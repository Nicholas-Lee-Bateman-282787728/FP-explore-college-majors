7912819,5,B00000JMQ1,"Love the Pythons you have to be able to understand British humor and I almost have the whole set and I just love Monty Python. Better than Saturday Night Live, Kids In the Hall, or any kind of troupe or show like another show, SCTV. Love the silly six!!",1066608000,,253,4.183673469387755
7912820,5,B00000JMQ1,"This volume in the entire Flying Circus collection has some of the best sketches ever conceived by the troupe.  The North Minehead Bielections with ""Mr. Hilter"" is a personal favorite.  Other favs include the Upper Class Twit-of-the-Year Show, People Falling Out of Buildings, Fairy Police, ""Albatross!"", and the Weird Voices Policeman Sketch.  Any Python lover would be wise to make this part of their collection and enjoy watching it over and over.",1025136000,,450,5.222222222222222
7912821,5,B00000JMQ1,"To this day, Monty Python remains THE idol and source of inspiration to humourists all around. Monty Python's Flying Circus made the group famous, and it is the best ever to come out, not only from Monty Python, not only from Britain... but humour in general!
Highlights on this tape: Agatha Christie Sketch, 'Spectrum' - Talking Abouth Things and Ken Shabby.
