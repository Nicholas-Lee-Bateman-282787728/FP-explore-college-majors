Never judge the book by its cover are the morals to draw from this movie. and sadly very many learn the hard way  even in real life. Raj Kapoor as if just passed away yesterday and I was not even aware of the death. I have known him since my childhood as one of the greatest artists the Film and Entertainment Industry has ever created. This movie was also his creation and his loved ones also added a lot of flavours to make the best out of every RK Production. Excellent  story, music, photography and songs. Special thanks also to the seller for bringing some of the best entertainment from India to the very many who now call America their home as well.",1476662400,,733,4.266187050359712
8315813,5,B001KQFA08,"Sad but a great movie with great songs. A line in one of the songs is like this ""Daya karo prabho"", which means Lord have mercy, I guess! That line makes that song far greater than Adele's ""Hello"" or Don McLean's ""Crying"". Now, the missing part, no subtitles to most songs.

Thanks",1454112000,,281,4.403846153846154
