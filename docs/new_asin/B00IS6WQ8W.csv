6290595,5,B00IS6WQ8W,"Wow... Really great movie. Story, writing, acting were all top notch. Very good surprise. The sister who was the cop really surprised me, because she played in Friday after next and I assumed that she couldn't act. But she really proved me wrong. Her performance was really true to life(in my eyes).",1404604800,,299,4.769230769230769

6290604,5,B00IS6WQ8W,Loved this movie!! It's about forgiving yourself when making mistakes at a young age but able to recognize and accept the decisions made whether good or bad. Also able to ask others for forgiven as well!  Recommend movie!!,1444176000,,222,4.842105263157895
6290605,3,B00IS6WQ8W,"The movie has a good message, that is, trying to hid the past will ensure that it shows up in the future; however, the acting was a bit stoic resulting in no on-screen connection - there just wasn't any on-screen chemistry, and that's what makes a movie believable.",1441238400,,265,4.541666666666667

6290608,5,B00IS6WQ8W,Wow! Who knew? I was shocked at how great this movie is. I found this quite by accident and it shocks and saddens me that I could have never seen this movie and not known I was missing such a gold nugget. SUCH a didactic film! Kudos to the director and cast. You should be proud. Excellent!,1435795200,,290,4.105263157894737
6290609,5,B00IS6WQ8W,"Awesome movie.  Whether you are a sista or sister, this movie is a fun flick.  It's an great example of how a family of women, choose to let go of the past and begin anew.  Through various heartaches, pain and shame at the end they find happiness. Grab your box of tissue, popcorn and sister/girlfriend. Enjoy :-).",1434758400,,314,4.473684210526316

6290615,5,B00IS6WQ8W,"""Between Sisters"" is a must see and a collector's item to watch with the family.  It touches upon a woman that has made some mistakes in her past that she's not proud of , tries to bury everyone and anything that happened in her past as if her past never existed and have been erased in her mind.  She doesn't realize that because she have erased the past in her mind that eventually the past, the lies, and secrets will come back to haunt her that she will be forced to deal with it and make amends to those lives she affected dramatically by her past decisions of abandonment and neglect.  It also shows that you are never too old to learn and that the person teaching you maybe way younger than you.  A great illustration that every Christian has a past and that every sinner has a future if we can just accept responsibility, accountability of our actions, and repent and ask for forgiveness.  I wouldn't necessarily call this a movie but rather a play without the typical singing your normal play has but this by far doesn't affect the real message and good acting in ""Between Sisters"".  Definitely not a mistake in purchasing this diamond in the rough.  Go out and get your copy today.",1424649600,,1191,4.460829493087558
6290616,3,B00IS6WQ8W,"Between Sisters was okay... good cast, a little predictable, a little slow at times... The movie started out about a wedding and it should have ended with a wedding....since the search was to be a part of ""the wedding""..... A good story of love, forgiveness and family",1423612800,,268,4.723404255319149

6290625,4,B00IS6WQ8W,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I liked it because the choices in actresses, actors was really decent and the acting was really good. I am a movie lover and a lot of my favorites have been low budget films. I think this is good because it is so true to life... possible to happen to anyone. I love anything that is realistic. It wasn't overdone and it was really well written. I think the only thing I wish was different would be it seeming more like a play than a movie. I know it may seem cliche' but movies about tested faith and forgiveness are needed for those suffering through these very issues, and those that don't have anyone in their lives to teach them to pray, forgive and that making mistakes isn't the end of your life.",1413676800,4,744,4.321428571428571
6290626,4,B00IS6WQ8W,Good story line. I wish they went more into some scenes but overall good movie.,1408406400,,79,4.333333333333333

6290628,5,B00IS6WQ8W,"I really enjoyed this movie. It gives a message on even though we make mistakes we can pick ourselves up and start over again. It also teaches forgiveness for not only for others, but ourselves. The acting was great.",1406419200,8,216,4.564102564102564

8644922,4,B00IS6WQ8W,I really liked this movie. The storyline was good and it had some of my favorite actress in this movie. I love the reunion of the sisters. The acting was great and some parts were sad and very emotional. It makes a good family movie. The downside was the laughing track. It was totally not needed. The laugh track was used when things wasn't funny at all. It was just awkward and a waste. Other than that I do recommend this girly movie.,1505692800,,437,4.27710843373494
8644923,1,B00IS6WQ8W,This movie is so lame. Looks like it was made in a basement,1493942400,,59,3.6153846153846154
8644924,5,B00IS6WQ8W,"There's an old saying:  ""ART mirrors life,"" and I add: ""so our living can mirror ART.""

Well.  That old saying is old and older but I heard of it in the 50s.  When the 60s came in the ART changed and the nation changed....and the living changed to those opinions in ART.  We are living the results.  The kind of ART in this play-movie died-out as a form to teach: HOW TO LIVE LIFE, and how to interject Real Life with The Dream of Betterment  to actualized '''The Divine''''.  And this movie brings it all back to where it """"""""should""""""""""be to benefit greatly.
THIS FILM IS ACTUALLY ''''''AN AMERICAN CLASSIC''''''.  JUST WHAT THE '''DOCTOR''''. therapist, ORDERED.
CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL OF THE PRODUCTION STAFF AND EXTRA CUJOES TO THE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES.... DIRECTOR, AND WRITERS.  TRULY A POWERFUL EXCELLENT PRODUCTION WITH A TOTAL POSITIVE MESSAGE OF UNDERSTANDING.AND HEALING.

8644925,1,B00IS6WQ8W,I started watching this and immediately noticed a laugh track.....IN A MOVIE?  It's bad enough on tv.  I closed it.  Don't waste your money.,1485302400,2,140,4.75

8644928,2,B00IS6WQ8W,"I wish Amazon would warn us when a movie is extremely low budget with a canned audience!! Life is too short and too busy
to waste my time on such low-budget work. I appreciate it if that is your line of work and you have the time to view such things.
I do not and I don't appreciate being suckered out of my money for canned productions.  The cheap set and canned audience
""laughter"" grossed me out right away and I turned it off.  If you are going to offer such things Amazon, you should only charge
us 75 cents to rent this! It is not a real movie in my opinion, but a play of sorts on a cheap set.",1465603200,,600,3.950413223140496
