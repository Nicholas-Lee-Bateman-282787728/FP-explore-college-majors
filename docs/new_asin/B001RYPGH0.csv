8339267,5,B001RYPGH0,"The ""workout"" is wonderful, George Mera does an excellent job walking you through each move.  Very relaxing and feel great after each session.  However, the quality of the DVD sucks...lots of skipping and just recently, my DVD player rejected the disk.  Will be returning the DVD for replacement.",1368057600,,296,5.125
