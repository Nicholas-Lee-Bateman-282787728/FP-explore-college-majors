7669632,5,B01BUQKEBC,The greatest live metal band of all-time. Period.,1459123200,,49,5.25
7669633,5,B01BUQKEBC,Classic PRIEST. Great video. Also available as a CD.,1458950400,,52,4.888888888888889
7669634,4,B01BUQKEBC,"This is a quick review for those wondering how Battle Cry compares to the Epitaph blu-ray that was release a few years ago.

Picture quality: This is my reason for only 4/5. Battle Cry is craptastic 1080i/60. This means that it looks more like a DVD. Very disappointing for those who have high end displays. I'd rather have full resolution with a film-like appearance (Rush's R40 blu-ray is 1080p/24 and looks fantastic) than sacrifice resolution for the smooth, smeary 'live' look. Epitaph is 1080i/60 as well, but looks better to my eyes. It doesn't suffer from the sudden quality drops that Battle Cry does.

Sound quality: I listened to the entire show in uncompressed stereo and it sounded great to me. Very powerful, dynamic and clear. The bass could have been a bit more audible, but at least it's not too boomy. It's great to hear the tracks from Redeemer of Souls in proper production. The CD sounded miserable.

Performances: Battle Cry has the better perfomances, easily. Rob doesn't struggle with high notes as much, Glenn stays in time better and Scott's drumming... incredible. Even the more simple songs from British Steel and Point of Entry sound fantastic with his added flare. Ritchie is fantastic as always.

Song selection: This is the one that comes down to personal preference. I found this set to be a bit better because of Jawbreaker, Dragonaut and Halls of Valhalla. Too bad they didn't break out Tyrant, Exciter and Deal with the Devil, though.

And there you have it. Sub-par picture quality aside, this is Judas Priest excellence.",1458950400,15,1558,4.886363636363637
7669635,5,B01BUQKEBC,"I just finished watching, and the boy crying at the end full of joy sums up how great this concert was.
I was expecting a better light show than Epitath, and I can say I enjoyed this light show more, and feel Rob's voice was more rested, as he did a much better job with Painkiller. This Blu-Ray also includes Devil's Child, as well as three tracks from their latest album which are Redeemer of Souls, Dragonaut, and Halls of Valhalla. It's different enough IMO to purchase, even if you own the Blu-Ray Epitath. The quality of the music as well as the video is top-notch.",1458864000,24,571,4.39622641509434
7669636,5,B01BUQKEBC,"Does it really get better than this? I saw Priest three times on this tour and it sounded exactly like this. Simply phenomenal. Awesome set list, performances, sound, and video. The music is ripping thru my speakers....WOW. Highly Recommended.",1458864000,11,243,5.256410256410256
7669637,5,B01BUQKEBC,"Amazing. This is one my favorite Priest videos now.
Ritchie Faukner does an amazing solo in ""You got another thing coming"" . If you're a Priest fan get this.",1458864000,13,157,4.448275862068965
7669638,5,B01BUQKEBC,This has to be the best DVD of the priest out there. The music is flawless and Rob Halford can still sing like no other. The home theater was rocking 3 minutes after it was delivered and boy was it good! Buy it if your a fan of the metal gods!,1458864000,3,243,3.784313725490196
7669639,5,B01BUQKEBC,This is the best live show I've seen to date. The picture and audio are superb! Crystal clear picture. I have a 5.2.2 audio set up  and let me tell you...it's like being there live a few rows in. Blown away by this disc. The crying kid nearly made my wife nearly pee her pants lol,1491609600,6,280,4.0

7669644,5,B01BUQKEBC,"The video production is one of the better concert captures I've seen. The music production is top-notch. The show itself? Amazing! JP killed it in this performance and the bonus songs are a great treat. Hearing JP in true 5.1 is something I've been longing for, and this certainly delivers.",1481328000,,290,4.82
7669645,4,B01BUQKEBC,"One the best HD Priest concerts with new guitar player Richie Faulkner! Awesome guitar player, great riffs! but...I still wish KK would come back...it's just not the same...it's like Ferrari using a modified GM LT1 engine in there cars...",1478736000,,238,5.128205128205129
7669646,5,B01BUQKEBC,"This is superb on a large TV with Surround sound. The concert is pretty much all you get. I would like to see some extras, but I am not griping about the Blu-ray for that. Given Rob's amazing costume changes, I would love to see a close up tour of the wardrobe. Also, the guitars are superb and now would be a great time to see the guys show their guitars off in detail ( even Ian's bass, or collection of Bass guitars, since I assume he must have some backups), and not to forget the Drum kit, what a tour of the instruments that would be.",1476662400,2,540,4.05607476635514
7669647,4,B01BUQKEBC,"The only thing keeping this from earning 5 stars is Rob Halford. While he can still sing well in his mid range register, his high register is shot and he really needs to stop trying. I don't think anyone would think poorly of him for not trying and would surely reduce those cringe worthy moments. Also, I'm a huge fan of Painkiller, but they need to drop it from the setlist as Rob is completely incapable of doing it right. That being said, the band is extremely tight, most of the time Rob sounds pretty good and the video was shot properly. The stereo sound is excellent (I'm not much of a fan for surround sound tracks on concerts because very few bands get it right!).",1476057600,2,674,4.357142857142857
7669648,5,B01BUQKEBC,This concert was awesome.  The stage was huge and impressive.  The sound was awesome.  Great band still putting on a great show.,1474329600,,128,4.7272727272727275

Even though I still miss KK DOWNING, but this is a brilliant show. They kick ass. I'd give a hundred stars instead of 5.",1470787200,,143,4.142857142857143

7669661,5,B01BUQKEBC,I don't care how old they are.  They still put on one hell of a show.  The addition of Faulkner gave the band a shot in the ass.  Great to watch this and remember the show I saw in Atlanta on this tour.,1464220800,,202,3.6511627906976742

7669664,5,B01BUQKEBC,This is the best Rob has sounded in years. His range is so much cleaner since he stopped smoking and Richie's leads are amazing. A very worth-while DVD and I am very glad Priest are still going strong after the Epitaph tour!,1464134400,2,224,4.357142857142857
7669665,4,B01BUQKEBC,"Nice concert release from the mighty Priest, picture and audio just fine too, set a little short compared to head lining slot but for a festival show they Deliver the Goods!!!

7669670,5,B01BUQKEBC,"Wow. What a gig. Rob still is the metal god with the pipes of the devil. Faulkner is immense, like watching Randy Rhoades, his double, and he shreds just as well, amazing. If your a Priest fan then this show reaffirms their status. New tracks pummel alongside the classics. Bonus tracks Screaming for Vengeance and Desert Plains are true beauties. At the end of Youve got another thing coming theres a few shots of a teenage lad at the front barrier in tears crying...says it all I think. Long live the Priest...",1463356800,,512,4.576086956521739

7669683,5,B01BUQKEBC,"Amazing performance by the band with an incredible sound quality! The sound seems to be captured directly from the mixing table, you can hear every nuance like a studio performance, it really sounds amazing. Tom Allom mixed the sound, he captures the raw Priest essence from the 80's recordings. Complementing the experience we have an overall good image quality, not as good as the other blu-ray from the band, and a solid setlist. The Epitaph tour Blu-Ray has a much more varied setlist covering the entire band's career, but the performance here is much, much better, specially from Halford who delivers an unforgettable experience! I absolutely recommend this to any Priest fan!",1461715200,3,682,5.098214285714286
7669684,5,B01BUQKEBC,"Great show, the crowd is a bit tame, but those all day festivals and drinking in the sun will do that to you. Richie Faulkner is an incredible addition to Priest, perfect replacement for KK. Tipton is on fire, Halford sounds fantastic, Hill and Travis are tight as hell.",1461628800,,270,4.530612244897959
7669685,5,B01BUQKEBC,you can't go wrong with Judas Priest!  I saw this tour live (not this exact show) and they sound just as good.  It's amazing a band this far into it still sounds hungry and excited to play.  Im looking forward to the new album (hopefully soon) but this will keep me busy until that comes out.  Don't wait and get the Blu-Ray ASAP.  Great picture and sound make this a must have.,1461369600,2,378,4.194444444444445

7669687,5,B01BUQKEBC,"Although the previous concert videos had a stellar setlist, we can cast those aside in favor of this one that still emplores an out of this world song list but without the dizzying camera edits!
It's about time.  I finally get to enjoy a modern concert without the editor switching angles 5 times per second.  The camera work is great with nice steady shots so you can actually enjoy the performance without some imbecile editor trying to make a name for their self by dazzling me with their bs. Tip of the hat to this director/editor! You have actually made the first modern concert video not only watchable but memorable.

More to that point. ....the bonus tracks.  I timed some shots at nearly 6 or 7 seconds before they switched camera angles. ..making the bonus tracks even more worthy than the rest of the disc.
In sum.... a new favorite. Thank you Judas Priest for getting it right this time!",1460678400,28,899,4.6

It is listed as track #13.  It goes from 12 to 14!  If I select it directly from the tracklist, it goes to ""Electric Eye"" (track #14)  I purchased the DVD new, wonder if it is an issue with the pressing?  It is a shame since the show is great, the sound is very good, no other complaints, feel jipped!",1460505600,,446,4.188235294117647
7669690,5,B01BUQKEBC,"I was able to see Priest 3 times on this tour (Denver, Stockholm, and Vilnius).  There is nothing like a Priest show, whether it was my first in 1982 or my latest ones in December, 2015.  The dvd captures the power of Priest and the great vocals of Rob Halford.  It is amazing that after 40 years these guys are still putting out great music and can put together a concert with such energy.  Battle Cry captures the Waken festival plus a few extra songs from their Gdansk show in December.  The dvd looks and sounds great.  Any Priest fan should pick this up and enjoy the music and show.  Not many more years for bands like Priest, so I do my very best to see them whenever I can.  Long live the Priest.",1460246400,4,704,4.201492537313433

I didn't think it was a great vocal night from Rob. His mid-range is good, but he struggled on the high notes. He also blurts out the lyrics too fast. The band sounds really good, but a little too processed sounding. Glenn appears frail.
