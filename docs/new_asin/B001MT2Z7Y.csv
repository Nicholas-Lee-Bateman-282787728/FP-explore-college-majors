The company I work for had been taking advantage of the workforce for a long long time and this film helped me understand what it takes to make a change. Harry Bridges learned to communicate with both workers and the bosses and find a common ground. He listened, was fair and incorruptible. I wish I'd met him. This film made me feel like I had. He went through so much in his incredible life. I can't wait to get a copy of the actual version I saw on PBS and the 2 hours of extra features.
