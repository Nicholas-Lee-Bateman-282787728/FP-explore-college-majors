But when the two worlds unexpectedly collide, Angela struggles to reconcile her situation and ultimately has to make a choice about what really defines her perfect Christmas""

I stumbled upon this movie by channel-flipping, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it sweet, unique, genuine, and hilarious.  I absolutely love it!  I'd give it ten stars if I could.  =)",1258070400,9,588,5.279569892473118
3487588,5,B001BAWKR4,I have been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD as well as replay on television. This has to be an instant classic. I just loved Christina Milian in this and thought this was a unique and wonderful story. I hope to make this movie a Christmas tradition.,1251331200,12,259,4.2
3487589,5,B001BAWKR4,"I first watched this ABC Family Christmas movie this past Christmas and was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it! The story centers around Angela (Christina Milian), a New Yorker who longs for an old-fashioned Christmas like the ones in the movies. This is often difficult due to her loud, crazy, and meddling family that always seems to be in her way. They don't enjoy Christmas as much as Angela, and this frustrates her to no end. One evening Angela  receives a snowglobe, which to her contains the perfect Christmas setting, and wishes she could be there. Well, her wish is granted and what ensues is definitely not what she expected. Angela eventually learns that Christmas is what you make of it and that you should appreciate what you have, crazy family and all. :)

I would highly recommend this movie during the holiday season or anytime you want to get into the Christmas spirit! You won't be disappointed!",1237939200,22,923,4.7625

3487591,5,B001BAWKR4,"An excellent modern Christmas movie.  Cristina Milian performance was refresh, different and  stylish.  The village, the other actors like Lorraine Bracco make this movie ideal for all ages.  Remember that it's an ABC Family Movie",1232323200,13,230,5.485714285714286

3487594,2,B001BAWKR4,I bought this movie after reading the other reviews here.  I am always searching for decent Christmas movies to buy.  This one was on the unbelievable side.  Main subject of movie gets transformed into the antique snow globe to find a perfect world where the inhabitants live perfect lives.  I guess I lean more to the Christmas feel good movies that are more beleivable.,1227657600,5,371,4.75
3487615,5,B001BAWKR4,A beautifully heartwarming movie. I bought this as a birthday gift for my sister (who happens to have a birthday around Christmas) and she loved it.

3487616,4,B001BAWKR4,"This story is about a young woman who more than anything wants a traditional Christmas with snow and turkey instead of what she's used to, year after year. One day she gets a package delivery, which ends up being a snow globe, and it transforms her life. The acting, by all characters, is horrendous but if you can withstand the whining voices and focus on the story line, it's a must see. Overall, I'd say it's mostly family friendly although there is a part where drinking is involved. If you're looking for a cute Christmas movie, give this a try!",1494460800,,550,4.51

3487679,5,B001BAWKR4,"This movie starts off in the opening credits with Angie who works in her family deli/Italian take-out business expertly and elaborately gift-wrapping two pounds of salami for a customer. Haha, that's how much she loves Christmas. Her family though is rambunctious and unrefined - eating green-lasagna and watching sports on a portable TV is their holiday tradition. Angie dreams of an old-fashioned, ""perfect"" Christmas and through a magic snowglobe is able to enter another place where she can live out this fantasy. Snowglobe is a well-casted, well-acted, cute and clever story of family relationships, love and discovering it may not be perfect, but a just-right Christmas takes many forms. I couldn't find it on ABS Family this year so spent the 9.95 for DVD. Perfect movie to have playing while wrapping gifts and making Christmas treats.

PS - I just noticed you can get this movie bundled with other ABC Family movies for a cheaper price than this alone.",1450224000,,961,5.044025157232705

I ended up watching this movie & ""Christmas Cupid"" (another awesome film starring Christina Milian) the entire 2014 holiday season. This movie is very family oriented & ""cutesy"". I love how they show the normalcy of a multicultural family. This movie was so New York & it was such a perfect storyline.",1449964800,,507,4.183673469387755

3487748,5,B001BAWKR4,"The eternal perkiness of the characters and downright corny storyline should be irritating, but it works. I identified with the frustration Angela feels when dealing with her overbearing family, and appreciate the message that perfect isn't always what it's cracked up to be. While I believe the movie intends to depict a Cuban American family, the characters look a lot like members of our family (African, African American, Italian). As a multiracial family, we enjoy seeing movies that feature families that look something like ours, where the racial makeup of the family is not central to the conflict of the movie. While race is something we deal with regularly, in positive and negative ways, it's certainly not the only part of our lives. Too often, children's books, shows, or family movies are still monoracial, and those that are multiracial often focus on race to the exclusion of all else. Multiracial children don't see themselves and their families portrayed in any other context nearly often enough.",1418947200,,1014,5.151515151515151

3487753,4,B001BAWKR4,"Another one of the Christmas movies I try to watch every holiday season.  This one is a romantic comedy, very much in the holiday mood as young Angela is a big fan of Christmas.  She even wraps an order of meat in Christmas wrapping.  The problem is that she works in her family's shop, lives in the same building as them, and is unmarried.  And they're trying to help her get married.  They've even rented the room down the hall from hers to a nice, young, very eligible bachelor.  She doesn't like that.  She wants something different.
  Well, she gets to see something very different -- the perfect Christmas with the perfect guy.  The question is is this what she really wants?
  It's a very nice film, family-friendly and with a good deal of humor throughout.  If you like Christmas movies, if you like a nice romantic comedy, you may well like this one.",1417219200,,859,4.5

I was also shocked that in a supposedly family movie, she appears in a seductive outfit with chest practically bared, hoping to seduce the innocent boy.

The cover art for the DVD made the film seem too ""young"", as though it was more for young children. But then I read the description and thought, ""What the heck, lets give it a try."" And I'm glad I did!

It's such a cute family film!

Angela is a New Yorker with a very overbearing, in-your-face Italian family who doesn't understand the meaning of ""boundaries"". Tired of not having any personal space, and dying for a ""traditional"" picture perfect Christmas, she finds herself getting really irritated with her family.

One day, while returning home she receives a mysterious Christmas gift; a magical snow globe that allows her to enter a dream world where everything is perfect and simple. Soon, she finds herself escaping more and more into this dream world, even to the point of missing her sister's baby shower.

Then one day, while hosting a family dinner in her apartment, a male character from her dream world (a.k.a. the snow globe) appears in her bedroom and asks to see Angela's world. Angela leaves and takes the guy to explore New York, then asks her new neighbor to keep an eye on him while she works.

When she returns home from work, another person from the snow globe enters her world and as she tries to return them both to their own world, via the snow globe, she gets whisked back into the snow globe instead.

It's then that she realizes that ""perfection is over-rated"" and what she really wants is to spend the holiday with her imperfect family, and their imperfect Christmas. And it's that realization that frees her from the snow globe.

I loved the message behind this holiday special... you can have a wonderful holiday with those you love if you just let go of perfectionism and embrace their idiosyncrasies.",1363824000,4,1831,4.667701863354037

3487806,1,B001BAWKR4,"This movie had a nice idea but either the writer didn't carry the plot all the way through or the director held everyone back. Ever watch someone try to dance and you just know they're counting out their footsteps? Well, that's what this movie felt like. The characters never really clicked and the plot just fell apart. Anyone over the age of 6 will probably not want to see it.",1357689600,2,379,4.428571428571429

3487810,4,B001BAWKR4,I bought this for my daughter because she said it was her favorite Christmas movie. She let her 8 year old daughter watch it and she loved it too! I was not as impressed with it as they were but it was cute.,1356998400,,207,3.8372093023255816
3487811,5,B001BAWKR4,The main character discovers she can visit the seemingly perfect world inside her snow globe. That world is endearing and enchanting at times and maddeningly two-dimensional at others. She is torn between that world and the crazy world of her real life with her family over-shadowing everything in mostly obnoxious ways. To say more would take away from the fun of watching the film. Definitely recommend. Enjoy.,1356307200,2,412,5.164179104477612

Last year Christmas morning we woke up early to rip open presents and this movie was on the family channel and we cuddled together and watched it.
Wanted to buy it for hubby this year for Christmas.......wonderful way to spend Christmas morning.",1353801600,3,286,4.74
3487815,5,B001BAWKR4,"Snowglobe is a really entertaining Christmas fantasy film about a cute young woman and her slightly off-kilter family. All she really wants is an ideal Christmas, just like the kind you see in department store windows and snowglobes! When she gets an unexpected delivery of a snowglobe, she is magically transported to a little Christmas world, where everyone seems to be as ideal as she hopes!

I love the Brooklyn setting in contrast to the little Christmas world of escapism -- it makes it all the more special and real to me. This is a delightful fairy-tale film for kids and adults. Lots of fun and romance!",1353283200,,612,4.719626168224299

3487817,5,B001BAWKR4,This is an excellent Christmas movie and different than other ones. The closest I can get when you consider that the family is disfuntional is Holiday in Handcuffs but the family in that movie wasn't this bad. The main characters favorite holiday is Christmas. Its mine too but nevermind. Anyway she dreams of the perfect Christmas and this snowglobe she recieves litterly takes her there. Later she has to choose between her true love who is her neighbor and a guy from her Christmas fantasy. And she has to learn that sometimes Christmas isn't perfect. Thats a lesson Im still trying to learn.,1335225600,4,595,4.786407766990291

3487822,5,B001BAWKR4,"I love this holiday comedy.  It has humor, romance, and sesonal fun.  It starts off with the start loving the Christmas season and wanting all that is involved during the holidays from a traditional holiday/Christmas dinner and the joy of giving and receiving gifts.  Well, her family is a ""little"" on the dysfunctional side - who's aren't?  She receives a ""Special Delivery"" Snowglobe which magically transports her to the PERFECT Christmas/holiday town complete with traditional dinners, snow, ice skating, and the perfect holiday enjoying people that she has always wanted.  She realizes after a while that ""Home"" is where the heart is and learns to appreciate her family and count her blessings.  Along the way, we have a little romance with both a ""Snowglobe"" town man (whom she thinks is perfect - obviously) and the cute neighbor whom she meets along the way to the discovery of this joyous season and the importance of family.",1291852800,5,934,4.993548387096774
3487823,4,B001BAWKR4,"I <3 Snowglobe!!! This is a wonderful abc family film for Xmas (& the rest of the year!!!). Christina Milian is so adorable and beautiful in this movie!!! The film takes place in Brooklyn,NY. The story is about a magic snowglobe and how Angela transports back & forth there. Inside the snowglobe it is the perfect Christmas! At first Angela loves the snowglobe village, but be careful what you wish for! Eventually, Angela comes to realize that nothing is perfect & she accepts her family just the way they are. At the end of the day, family is the most important thing in life. Who eats goose anyway? I'd take Lasagna anyday! lol

The interview with the cast was a nice feature because we get to see more of Christina Milian!!! The thing that made this movie cute was Xtina Milian!!! She is adorable talking with a Brooklyn accent (she was channeling Rosie Perez!) lol. If I had to be trapped in a snowglobe, I wouldn't mind it if Christina Milian was there as well!!! There are some cool Christmas songs in the movie too!!! There's a Britney Spears Xmas song and a Spice Girls Xmas song!! I recommend this movie to everyone who loves Christmas!!!

Britney Spears ""My Only Wish (This Year)""

Spice Girls ""Sleigh Ride""

Christina Milian won the 2008 Imagen Award for Snowglobe in the TV Actress category.",1261612800,6,1304,4.632034632034632
