The Parole Officer lays onscreen like some low-budget TV movie. There are some chuckles, but this film falls way short of the best of British comedy.

Coogan plays an inept parole officer, who witnesses a murder committed by a corrupt Police Inspector. The Inspector then tries to kill Coogan, fails, and so he settles on instead threatening Coogan. If Coogan squeals, the Police Inspector will pin the murder on Coogan with false evidence (the victim's head).

But there's a security cam videotape of the murder, which one of the Inspector's crime partners has placed in a bank safe deposit box, so as to blackmail the Inspector if need be.

The bulk of the plot is Coogan trying to break into the bank and steal the tape, so he can prove that the Inspector is the killer. To do this, Coogan enlists the aid of his ""clients"" -- former criminals who are now on parole, trying to go straight.

The film (co-written by Coogan) tries to be zany and hilarious, but the jokes are mostly flat and predictable. Some scenes bring a smile, but no laugh-out-loud moments.

Lena Headey plays a police constable who falls in love with Coogan and eventually helps him. Her character makes no sense.

* Headey immediately falls for the nerdy, stumbling, bumbling Coogan -- why? -- while turning down the alpha male Inspector.

* Headey learns of Coogan's plot to rob the bank to get the incriminating tape. So she investigates on her own and discovers additional incriminating evidence against the Inspector (his phone number on the victim's cell phone). But instead, Headey believes the Inspector's innocence, reports on Coogan, and joins a police raid of Coogan's home, seeking evidence against Coogan. WHY? Why does Heady doubt Coogan RIGHT AFTER finding evidence that he's right?

* One of Coogan's ""clients"" frees Coogan from jail, and they commence with their plot to rob the bank. The police enter after the alarm goes on -- and Headey HELPS Coogan. Suddenly, she believes him again, and helps him escape from the bank. WHY?

There are other things in this film that makes no sense. Yes, I know we should give comedies some slack, but that's in terms of plot coincidences. Character motivation should still make sense.

This is a pleasantly diverting film, but not hilarious or memorable. It's worth the few pennies I paid for a used copy (plus postage), so I'm pleased with my purchase. But I don't recommend paying too much for this film.",1448496000,,2894,5.408888888888889

7939714,5,B00005JL89,"I saw bits of this on TV, liked it a lot and bought the DVD (ignoring the format warning). I could force it to play on my ""multi-region"" DVD player, but, I guess because of PAL, it did not play in color.

In spite of all that, I loved the movie because of its odd sense of humor. I am sorry, but I don't know any way to describe Coogan's comic sense; neither ""dry"" nor ""quirky"" quite fit.

If you realize that a parole officer persuading his ex-con clients to rob a bank to prevent a corrupt police officer from getting an undeserved award for bravery is a comic plot, then you should enjoy this movie.",1139011200,5,602,4.181034482758621

7939716,4,B00005JL89,"Steve Coogan, a British star known for his fake chat show host character Alan Partridge, makes the leap to the big-screen with his debut feature ""The Parole Officer"".
Coogan witnesses a murder in a nightclub, hidden from view from the murderers. They, however, have been caught on camera, and Coogan must get the tape back to prove his innocence and bring justice to the real culprits.
The laughs come thick and fast, and the film did brisk business in the UK. It's laugh-out-loud funny due to its situations, and although the characters may seem like stock-comedy-creations, Amercian audiences might like this if you're into the Monty Python films, or enjoyed ""High Heels and Low Lifes"" recently.
All in all, ""The Parole Officer"" raises many smiles, a couple of genuine gross-out gaffaws, and even the odd surprise - check it out!",1016928000,4,831,4.942857142857143
