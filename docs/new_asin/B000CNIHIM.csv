8537523,4,B000CNIHIM,"This video truly has excellent cinematography and shows all three match sets in their entirety.  No highlights only here.  The only downfall (reason why I gave the video a 4 instead of a 5) is that only the semi-final and finals matches are shown.  That means you only get to see the top four teams play.  Eight are advertised.  Not to ruin it, but no Navy and no Drexel here.",1254441600,,376,4.314285714285714
