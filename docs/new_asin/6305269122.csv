7886355,4,6305269122,"Like Barbet Schroeder did with ""Barfly"" director Marco Ferreri takes the work of renowned poet laureate of the derelicts, Charles Bukowski, and adapts it to a European sensibility.  Call it Spaghetti Bukowski if you will.  Ferreri trains his camera lens on the filth and decadence of L.A. and reimagines a world we thought we already knew.  The squalor of his chosen surroundings inspire the creative juices of Bukowski surrogate Charles Serking(Ben Gazzara) along with the liquor he consumes like mothers milk and the women he beds of all shapes and sizes.  I don't think this film would work if Gazzara treated his character with pathos because Serking consciously made his choices and is content to live with the consequences.  The focus of the film is a relationship Serking has with a masochistic prostitute, Cass(Ornella Muti) that is touching and poignant and Muti makes her a most compelling figure. The great Susan Tyrell has a good bit as a floozy who turns the tables on Serking.  Not a great film but an interesting example of independent filmmaking.",1412467200,,1062,5.005681818181818
7886356,4,6305269122,"I love this movie! I happen to think it's very funny , if , perversely so. Ben Gazzara as the Bukowski figure is wonderful. He surpasses Mickey Rourke or Mat Dillon to a degree that puts them to shame. I have no idea why the enjoyable but comparatively schlocky  BARFLY is better known. While genuinely funny,the movie has a poignancy to it that makes it oddly moving. You also get a knowing view of low life LA that is quite interesting. I should admit this movie is a bit rough at the edges and might not appeal to those with overly delicate sensibilities.",1392681600,,558,4.41747572815534
7886357,4,6305269122,"Gazara shows his range in this LA montage of bars, whores, and more bars. I liked the story and its wandering plot. The NY job scene alone is a riot. The ending, though, does not feel very Buk-like.",1351296000,,198,4.2368421052631575
7886358,4,6305269122,"""Style is the answer to everything...To do a dangerous thing with style is what I call art."" ~ Charles Bukowski

Bukowski had style. Ferreri has style. This film is an achingly human, drunken odessey inspired by the writings of Bukowski. This is not an adaptation, but captures the essence and complements his works. It shares carnality, a gritty realism, the pain and desperation of being human. It's provocative. It's uncomfortable. It's the underbelly and grimness of life that too often goes unrecognized. Or if acknowledged, you numb it with alcohol; you engage in self-destructive behaviours; you mask it with eroticism; you become a whore of an angel; you write. Whether these actions are to escape yourself or to regain feeling, it is human ~ it is pain ~ it's art if done with style ~ and, it's got soul.",1280793600,,813,4.848920863309353
7886359,5,6305269122,"Marco Ferreri made a devastatingly lyrical, sinister and cruel portrait about the existence of Charles Bukowski, the poet of hopeless, the excesses, the alcohol; the legitimate sex' sybarite into a crude environment of loneliness and disillusion. Ben Gazzara is fabulous in this role as well the divine: Ornella Muti as Cass.

The final sequence in the beach embracing an unknown young girl in a visible childish attitude, dedicating her a free poetry is still haunting even the years, becoming a classic.

The poetry is a God that it doesn't go in the body; and that's why it scatter outside from it, and assumes multiple aspects.",1167091200,2,631,5.0
7886360,3,6305269122,"I just first saw 'Tales Of Ordinary Madness' yesterday. I like this film. At times living through the eyes of Charlie seems gluemy and useless, but I'm constantly fascinated and wondering the outcome. I only brought this film because I'm a hugh fan and LOVE Ornella Muti, but I'm glad I've had the chance to see this film. I recommend this film. And not just because Ornella is in it. Although it does't hurt because Ornella is really good in this film. Ornella is just beautiful as always but her acting always leaves me wanting/craving for more. If your a Ornella Muti fan this should definitely be in your collection. But other than that this film is fascinating but if you havn't seen this film don't expect a uplifting, happy film. This film may not be for every one.

7886361,3,6305269122,"""Tales..."" actually makes Bukowski sympathetic as he tries to find love and sex in the L.A. underground.  His harrowing adventures are interesting because he brings them all on himself.  Some of the scenes get too dark and go too long, but Gazzara is great.  ""Barfly"" was tedious and dull, this is much better.",983491200,3,310,4.811320754716981
7886362,3,6305269122,Actually it's not as good as the other ornella muti's films. But if you like ornella you should check this one. The film includes a little erotism with the amazing beautiy of ornella muti.,960681600,3,188,4.5588235294117645
