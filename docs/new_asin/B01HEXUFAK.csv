7786450,5,B01HEXUFAK,Great product.,1476489600,,14,6.5
7786451,5,B01HEXUFAK,"I borrowed this series from a friend and thoroughly enjoyed watching.
In summary, Kyon is a normal Japanese high schooler that gets dragged into his classmate Haruhi's attempts to find significance in life. Unfortunately, Haruhi only seems to think the discovery of time travelers, aliens, espers, and other oddities are of any importance, so she spends most of her time in hairbrained plots to carry this out. To further this goal she founds a club and aggressively recuits members, all of whom are actually members of different secret socities sent to monitor Haruhi. Why? They believe she has the ability to alter reality when she gets bored. Now it is up to Kyon and the other members of the club to keep Haruhi busy but under control.
Aside from the overall premise, the series is rather weird in its nonlinear plotline, skipping around like a Tarantino film. It may take awhile, but the show does make sense, and it entertaining to watch the entire time.
*Spoiler Alert*
About the third quarter of the series gets frustrating with a Groundhog Day style time loop for several episodes. I won't blame anyone for fast forwarding through some of those episodes.",1476316800,,1163,4.878787878787879

7786453,5,B01HEXUFAK,"I bought this at Fry's Electronics and I am absolutely happy with this product. Since Bandai's rights to the series expired a while back, finding complete sets of seasons 1 and season 2 and the movie were difficult! You wouldn't believe the crazy prices people and scalpers have been selling these for online! I own the Bandai set but I did not own season 2 until now. I'm glad Funimation decided to release all 28 episodes at once instead of dividing the seasons into two separate sets (really...would Endless Eight sell separately??).

The DVD cover art uses the Anime Legends art from Bandai's season 2 set and the reversible cover is the Regular Edition of Volume 0 released in Japan. The disc art also takes the artwork from the Limited Edition DVDs from Japan for seasons 1 and 2.

I watched the Sigh Arc already and I don't notice any frame issues. Everything looks great even for DVD quality. Funimation has the on screen text and Japanese subtitles at the top and bottom if the screen in a way that it does not obscure the image like Bandai's release. I notice the next episode previews are gone but I think they are included in the Extras disc.

Speaking of Extras, I did not have the time to look through all of em yet. I'm assuming they're the same extras seen on Bandai's releases. I know the regular Bluray and the Limited Bluray sets come with 5 hours worth of bonus content though as opposed to this one's being 4 hours less.

Anyways, I got this just to be able to own Season 2 and I couldn't be happier with this product. This is one of a rare select of anime titles where I watch the English dub. I love the English dubs to this and LuckyStar! Crispin Freeman's voice as Kyons, Wendee Lee playing Haruhi, Stephanie Sheh as Mikuru, Michelle Ruff as Yuki and Johnny Yong Bosch as Koizumi. They're all great voice actors who play voices in multiple anime and video games and they really bring the characters to life.

One small gripe I have is the simple cover art. I know the title name-drops the central character, I thought a little more creativity could've been used besides using Season 2's art and throwing it over a plain red background. But I gueas this is okay because there are too many group photos of cover art featuring many characters. What makes up for this is what I mentioned earlier: Funimation using Volume 0 of the Japanese Regular Edition as the reversible cover art. I flipped it around to that on my DVD because that just happens to be one of my favorite cover artworks, featuring Waitress Mikuru Asahina agaibst Witch Yuki Nagato.

This is unmistakably a must-have for any hardcore anime collector. I totally reccommend it. However, if you don't have $35 to spare for the DVD version (Bluray is $55 and the Limited Edition Bluray is $139!!) wait for Funimation to release a S.A.V.E. version of this...if they're still doing that. But if you're an anime fan this show is one not to be missed. It was extremely popular with its original light novel series in Japan and is beautifully animated by Kyoto Animation, the studio responsible for shows like AIR, Kanon, CLANNAD, Free! and Full Metal Panic. It blends a bit of every genre into one and its funny and has a nice, casual feel, taking place in a high school setting yet being totally sci-fi at the same time. Haruhi Suzumiya has been an iconic character in the world of anime and in my opinion, her popularity continues to grow! Buy this set! You won't be disappointed and it's worth every penny spent!",1475971200,,3495,4.566188197767145
7786454,4,B01HEXUFAK,"Review-Around 1999 to 2000, I grew so tired of anime. I felt that each one I was watching, was derivative of the ones I watched previous. The weird thing is after I watched a film called  Battle Royale (which is not an anime film). I noticed that anime started getting less recycled and more personal. Not only can I make that case, but Funimation studios have put out both inspiring animes and very addictive films based off animes and manga. When that one anime film comes around, as a fan you are always stoked and ready to embrace it again. The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya does to all kinds of shojo fantasy subgenres. This was released in Japan around 2006 and directed by a veteran of Fushigi Yugi and other series named Tatsuya Ishihara. I admit, until I got the blu ray in the mail, I was not too sure about this title. I was so out of the loop in the last few years, and the rate we get anime, it was lost on me. That is on my fault, because this blu ray covering the first two seasons is incredible. I am now stoked to see, what else I have been missing out on. Our main character is named Haruhi. The story is told though in the point of view from Kyon, a kid in her class who is a freshman in high school. Kyon is trying to grow beyond childish things and has every intention of leaving his preoccupations with fantasy behind when he enters high school. This school we learn is in a different district than his other school. Meaning a whole new environment and students. Like most of us, he is shy and awkward, and he is trying to find a way to fit in. This all changes when by fate he ends up sitting right in front of Jauchi. A girl who is very known for her oddness.

She is everything, that Kyon is trying not to be. She actively wants to find aliens. She starts an SOS Brigade in a club at school to be like the X Files. She is also seeking psychics and time travelers as well The clubs first member is Kyon, the second is the bookish Yuki Nagato, the last remaining member of the literature club, whose meeting room Haruhi commandeers. We watch in these two seasons the Brigade being established and recruitment. When the club is established, is when the true beauty of this anime is showcased. We start to see that maybe Hauchi is not as crazy as we think. I really enjoyed this anime for the simple fact that it reminded me so much of FLCL. Where that used giant robots to illustrate the young boys youth to teen and above. This one centers on a young girl as she is trying to cope with this world that bores her, and tries to change it into a world that she is the center of her own universe. Kyon is one part sidekick and in some way becomes a hero as well. He also lends comic to his story plays out. The story of the first two seasons is so vivid in its depiction, and deep in its storytelling. You often forget you are watching an anime, as the acting does come across more realistic than you would assume. I found myself deeply captivated and plunged head first into this world that I did not want to leave. To nitpick to find a negative, at times the story does seem very reminiscent to other animes but I feel the similarities work in this shows favor.

I found this story very rich and deep in the way it came across. Very well executed and beautifully written. With a cast of characters that we can relate to, and feel a certain emotion towards. If you think anime is no longer daring and inspiring, I would say, you may want to see this first to make that decision after. This one is very easy to follow and very rich in the way it comes across. Very highly recommended and it is that season, to start planning on the gift giving. This could be the perfect stocking stuffer for that fan young or old.",1475193600,2,3733,4.232819074333801

7786460,4,B01HEXUFAK,"Let's assume you know whether you like the series, and talk about the quality of the Blu-ray transfer itself. It's of mixed quality.

The video clearly had some rather aggressive denoising filter applied to it, which results in a kind of blurriness in the lines and it makes the video look much poorer than the medium is capable of. The denoising is fairly bad in flashbacks, which use simulated film grain for creative reasons, because the denoising turns the film grain into a bunch of moving ""squiggles"" on top of the screen. Fortunately, this is only a small percentage of the scenes, and those of us sitting farther from the TV or who don't have good eyesight won't notice, and it's not distracting if you're paying attention to the story. These squiggles, however, are the first thing you see when you start episode 1. So the video is a bit botched. It's hard to comment on the actual compression quality since any compression artifacts would be hidden under the heavy filtering.

For some unknown reason, the Blu-ray disables the ""audio"" and ""subtitle"" buttons on your remote. I cannot imagine what kind of satanic witchcraft must have compelled the encoder to disable these features on an imported video. You can change the settings through the main menu or pop-up menu only, and certain combinations are prohibited. For example, you can't enable subtitles for English audio. I guess the concepts of hearing loss and hearing disability are completely foreign to whoever made the video. You also can't disable subtitles for Japanese audio, which is bizarre.

Speaking of subtitles, the translation is usually reasonable and flows well, but there are some phrases which aren't fluent English, and some specialist terms which are translated incorrectly. To pick on episode 5, in the conversation between Koizumi and Kyon,  is translated as ""human principle"", which is meaningless in English. The term should be ""anthropic principle"", which is a well-known term from philosophy and science fiction. Koizumi also says something translated as, ""An interesting fact floats up from here."" We can figure out what he's saying, but ""floats up"" is a literal translation of  which should have been translated idiomatically. No English speaker would speak that way. This scene is a bad example, other scenes were much better.

Audio is good, levels are fine, no excessive compression or anything.

The episodes are presented in chronological order, which is also the 2009 re-airing broadcast order. This is a good thing, I remember being fairly confused by the original 2006 broadcast order. ""Someday in the Rain"" is a good send-off to the series.",1496275200,10,2641,5.071428571428571
7786461,5,B01HEXUFAK,"This is the smartest high school anime there is, and I am so immensely happy not only that they brought it in its entirety to American Blu Ray, but that they included an episode order guide for the essential original broadcast, a-chronological ordering on the flip side of the slip over.",1495584000,,287,4.647058823529412
7786462,5,B01HEXUFAK,"This DVD set is NOT like the previous releases of the series. The original series broadcast on television and sold on DVD had an awkward and inaccurate order of events. This DVD set has the events in the proper order, which also means the introductory and ending sequences for the different release periods can seem a little shuffled at times.

The subtitles are a little wonky, too, but most people don't have a great appreciation for grammatical accuracy, so it's unlikely to bother many buyers.

Seriously, though. Buy this, even if you have the original DVD sets.",1491782400,6,567,4.835051546391752
7786463,5,B01HEXUFAK,"If you are a big fan of this series, you should buy it. Although 2nd season in this item is very repetitive, finally this is in my collection.

7786465,4,B01HEXUFAK,"This is a really good series  and is definitely worth getting,  but I feel that it really doesn't have a real ending and the movie The disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya doesn't really tie up any lose ends. The endless 8 arc gets repetitive and could have been resolved in less episodes. They could have used that time to give this series a proper end. I  feel they should have given it a proper end even if they planned to continue it further in the future. Still I would recommend getting this series. For both seasons it is a good price. Just skip the endless 8 arc.",1485129600,,567,4.330188679245283
7786466,4,B01HEXUFAK,"Great visual quality, but the fact that each disc has an unskippable advertisment before the menu really irks me.

7786467,5,B01HEXUFAK,"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya: Seasons 1 and 2 (Fantastic Series)

One of my friends introduced me to this series online and I feel in love with the characters. I had Season 2 on DVD but I could never grab Season 1 for a reasonable price. I'm glad amazon had the series on Holiday sale for $29.99.

7786471,4,B01HEXUFAK,"I enjoyed this series very much except, like most people, for the infinite 8 arc. It was excruciating. A strong word of caution *SPOILERS*

DO NOT watch all 8 episodes of the infinite 8 arc. It totally sapped my interest in the series for a good while. I recommend watching 1, 2, and 8. Maybe 3, but you are not missing anything significant between 2 and 8. It's just a groundhog day loop with very few differences. 1, 2, and 8 is plenty to get the idea they wanted. The rest is a huge waste of time, and infuriating.

*end spoilers*
The rest of the series is very well written and deceptively upbeat and light-hearted. Certainly worth a watch, truly a classic.",1478908800,7,661,4.409836065573771
7786472,2,B01HEXUFAK,"I wanted to like this series, but in the middle of the 28 or so episodes you get a chain of *8* episodes that retell the same story from the same perspective over and over and over with very slight differences ((like people wear different color of clothing, or catch a different bug, or the like)).  After slogging through this arc, the pay off was... underwhelming.  Honestly I can't imagine how horrible it would have been having to watch this live where for 8 weeks a show you are following plays the same episode with only slight differences.  In general time-loop/ground hog day plot lines are not my favorite thing to watch in shows ((despite them being super popular along with the stuck in an asylum and what if the main story line is just you being crazy)) but most shows have the good sense to make them only last 1 episode not *8*.  That means that 25% of this series is the same story with VERY minor differences.

If you are fans of this show already this is probably worth getting if you were waiting to own a copy or need to replace the one you already have.

I don't know if they were running out of money or had trouble finishing the script so felt this was a way to save on both, but it made me feel that whoever put the entire thing together had no respect for the audience.",1477612800,6,1293,4.300411522633745

8765300,4,B01HEXUFAK,"Its a show that doesnt know what it wants to be when it grows up. There are multiple ways to watch with episode orders for each version listed. The least confusing is to just watch them in chronological order, however some peolpe don't like it because the ""end"" is in the middle of the series and character development stops entirely, however to me that is better than random flashbacks and referencing events that haven't yet happened like in the first tv broadcast order. It randomly switches between being a comedy, a drama, and a love story, with no long term commitment. The best way to enjoy it is to not take it seriously, and come to terms with the fact that Haruhi herself is nothing more than a controlling b****. Also the endless eight was just a publicity stunt, watch the first and the last, and skip the middle six episodes, they are all exactly the same with some minor changes to character wardrobe. If you want to appreciate the work that was put in, each scene was redrawn and each line rerecorded for each of the endless eight, but minus those minor changes they are exactly the same episode.",1508716800,,1111,4.56
