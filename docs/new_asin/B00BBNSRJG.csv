5570510,5,B00BBNSRJG,Lady Morrighan is an amazing instructor and very generous with her knowledge. I had originally bought this particular DVD and I loved it so much that I purchased every instructional video she has to offer. I have purchased other instructional DVDs for striptease and they do not compare to her videos. I highly recommend her series of DVDs! She is simply the best!,1437264000,2,364,4.7936507936507935
5570511,5,B00BBNSRJG,Well worth the money. Lady M described and demonstrated everything in detail and really gives alot of moves and material to work with.,1419552000,,134,4.869565217391305
5570512,5,B00BBNSRJG,Lady M is definitely a trained dancer and her graceful seductive dance moves are fantastic. Her warm up and exercise routine are great toning exercise. I start with the fabulous Michelle L'Amour's Tease and Tone ($25-ouch! but worth it) then do the exercises in this DVD. She's is so great. I can't seem to resist having all her performance DVD's. She makes me feel sexy and graceful.,1415577600,3,384,4.746268656716418
5570513,1,B00BBNSRJG,"I have yet to find a dvd from this company that I like.  I officially give up.  They always seem so great when you watch the trailers, but they bore me ever so much.",1410739200,2,165,3.823529411764706
5570514,4,B00BBNSRJG,her series on exotic dance is wonderful. i have all four. While this one seems to have the most $ invested. i like more moves from her other dvds and tend to reach for those more. this is more of what to expect at a club and how to get around the stage. i felt the content was on the light side. however the back round was very classy. i do still like this dvd and it did have some very nice moves i was happy to learn. but if you only buy one of her dvds...private dancer is probably the most bang for the buck. i love them all and am happy with them all. i do them at night and rotate through them. shes very talented and knows her stuff.,1409356800,7,640,3.856060606060606
5570515,3,B00BBNSRJG,"It was informative and I certainly learned something new, but was hoping for an actual routine to follow. It was okay.",1398211200,,118,4.666666666666667
5570516,5,B00BBNSRJG,"Stripper Dance is another fabulous program from World Dance New York featuring Lady M, who has designed this program complete as advanced level dance instruction.
Perhaps you are looking to add a little spice to your life, or serious about dancing on stage, this program is challenging, fun, and full of sexy moves that are captivating and definitely enticing.
To begin, after a nice welcome, the program features a warm up that comprises movement from the movement catalogue, so I suppose the technique should be learned prior. Some of these are sexy stretches and hip rotations which she calls out by name. I used the muscle and conditioning workout before the warm up, to prepare for some of the intense movement.
Following the warm up, Lady M demonstrates fabulous standing moves, floor work, and walking. Some examples are:
Sexy walks: cat walk, stutter step, a horizontal grapevine.
 Standing moves: wiggles and sexy level changes, hip rotations and twerking moves.
On the floor: the butterfly, a butterfly peep show, and a very sensual wiggle on the floor.
Aside from all these sexy moves, the technique section is abundant with more tips for converting heels to match every outfit, tying and untying knots quickly, slipping out of a bra,  and much more.
7 stripping demos are fun to learn, with much variety in movement to choose from and create your own style.  The outfits Lady M wears in this section are adorable.
To finalize, Lady M devotes an entire section to club etiquette, such as club restrictions, and answers to common questions for anyone curious or venturing into this work.
From my experience of several decades, this is one of the best instructional videos I would want to learn from. The movement/technique is not totally broken down, however the visual presentation is vivid and this makes it very clear to determine the execution of the movement.",1384387200,4,1874,4.961783439490445
5570517,4,B00BBNSRJG,"I bought this to spice up our love life a little, and it did just that. She teaches well and if you have any experience club dancing then the moves are not hard to do. But if you are rhythmically challenged then maybe start off with one of her earlier dvd's where she breaks down the dance moves more. But if you already know how to ""salt shake it"" etc., then you should be pleased with the video. I'm bad about dancing for a few seconds and then not knowing what to do next, this video helped me find a routine to go by and fun moves to use. Definitely recommend it.",1369180800,7,567,4.071428571428571

8565475,1,B00BBNSRJG,"This video prepares you to be a professional stripper so if you are looking to get a job at a local club this will give you a quick start rather than going to school. My wife and I did not enjoy this one, she was looking for basic moves and pointers but not for advanced stripping degree.",1469836800,,288,4.0701754385964914
8565476,5,B00BBNSRJG,"Easy step-by-step instruction, sexy moves, and an overall fun DVD.  You can use it as a workout or as practice if you'll be dancing in a show.  This is a good DVD for those who already know a lot of dance moves, but have issues putting them together with good transitions.  The transitions are all sexy~ how to walk, how to get down on the floor, how to get back up from the floor.  Also a great DVD to show you how you can undress without looking like you're just taking stuff off after a long day at work.  It shows you how to do it in a very sensual, visually appealing way!
