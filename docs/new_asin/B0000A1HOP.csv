7995293,5,B0000A1HOP,"Chobits was one of the first animes I bought. I fell in love with it. The characters are very lovable. Chobits may be one of the cutest anime series ever. Chi is adorable. The animation is very good and the music fits the mood of the story beautifully. It's fun and very sweet, but it also gets extremely emotional at times. Every CLAMP title is great and Chobits is no exception. If you like Chobits check out these other CLAMP titles: X, Tsubasa, xxxHolic, and Angelic Layer. You would really be missing out if you don't watch Chobits.",1354147200,,537,4.489795918367347
7995294,5,B0000A1HOP,"In episode 14 ""Chi Entertains"" on the Chobits - Love Defined (Vol. 4) DVD, the beautiful but sad second ending theme song for Chobits, ""Ningyo Hime"" (""Mermaid Princess""), is heard for the first time in the series, sung superbly by the Japanese voice actor (seiyuu) for Chii (Chi), Rie Tanaka. Rie Tanaka's Chii from Chobits won Newtype Japan's annual favorite female anime character poll for 2002. Rie Tanaka's Lacus Clyne from Gundam Seed and Gundam Seed Destiny won Newtype Japan's annual favorite female character poll for 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006...",1163894400,,551,5.133333333333334
7995295,5,B0000A1HOP,"This part of the series is almost a lesson on pure love.  The good times and the bad.  Everybody starts to show their own conflicts over how to handle the technology of the time.  Some have been shown to empty their lives into a world of technology and have difficulty with humanity.  Others have suffered the loss of loved ones to a fantasy world brought on by that same technology.
Chi starts realizing such things as happiness and begins to act upon a desire to see Hideki happy.  Hideki's conflict deepens and he winds up terribly distracted by the apparent moral and philosophical issues with human-machine relations.  The comedy makes a bit of a comeback and adds to the story, but the story could hold up on it's own.  I would actually give the seris 6 stars from this volume on if I could.",1071964800,5,797,4.493055555555555
7995296,5,B0000A1HOP,"This dvd is so cool. First, Hideki was studing then somehow he was on the beach and have fun. Then he's teacher stay at Hideki's apartment, something is bothing Ms. Shimizu, Hideki's teacher. Shimizu and Shinbo, what are the relationship with them? And finally, can Chii cook, since Hideki drop his wallet and haven't ate for a few days? And plus, a free board!!!!",1068768000,,364,4.703125
7995297,4,B0000A1HOP,"""Love Defined"" provides a well-needed break from the emotionally high-strung previous volume, ""Darkness Descends."" The disc opens with a ho-hum episode with everyone (and I mean everyone, from Shinbo and Hideki's cram school teacher, to co-worker Yumi, to Minoru and several Persocons to Hideki's landlady) going for the summer's last outing at boy genius Minoru's beach house.
To recap, ""Chobits"" follows 18-year-old farm boy Hideki Motosuwa, who happens to find a uniquely powerful Persocon (human-like robots that have achieved cellphone-like status and popularity) in the trash; she can only say ""Chi"" at first (thus her name) but begins to learn new words and ideas at a tremendous rate. Hideki and his various friends spend their time working, studying and trying to find out who and where Chi is from; and if she is indeed from the legendary class of Persocons called Chobits.
The beach episode provides a little bit of drama at the end, perhaps needed to further amplify the mysteries surrounding Chi, but most of it is spent on beach fun and tame humor. But that is exactly what hooks ""Chobits"" viewers. Absolutely nothing revelatory can happen in a Chobits episode--just normal goings on, everyday life on film--but Chi's mystery, along with everyone else's skeleton-filled closets, carry the series on sheer tension and wondering: what are everyone's motives? Who is Chi? Etc. Viewers sit through the calmer moments of ""Chobits"" waiting edge-of-their-seat for something to happen: another outbreak of Chi's powers, some mysterious group from her past to show up, or something of the sort. It's the same reason we work through the weekdays--it makes the weekend that much more rewarding.
The next two episodes pair up. With Hideki's grades and bankroll headed south, life becomes that much more stressful. Until one eventful night when Hideki's hottie teacher Shizumi shows up at his door to stay the night (more of a statement by her than a request). These two episodes will reveal plenty about Shizumi and her own Persocon experiences. The dynamics of the show will also change, in terms of relationships, with Shizumi, Shinbo and Hideki all involved in a surprising plot twist.
""Love Defined"" closes with Hideki even more broke after losing his wallet. No food means a lack of brainpower, which is all the more critical since one of his bigger entrance exam prep tests lies just ahead. Chi, who has now been working at the local pastry shop, decides to help out and use her money to buy groceries, then learn how to cook.
Vol. 4 by no means exceeds the level of excitement in ""Darkness Descends,"" but manages to maintain the ""Chobits"" storyline without making severe plot and character changes.
One of the more solid overall anime series, ""Chobits"" has an intriguing story, very modern art, and a soundtrack that at times can rival any music in any series. Again, feminists and those with young children may not want to take on this series, unless you're prepared to focus more strongly on the issues of identity and relationships. Not a robots, powerups and swordfights series, but a thoroughly entertaining one.",1059609600,,3126,5.060077519379845
7995298,5,B0000A1HOP,"I am a huge fan of Clamp's anime. I read the Chobits comic, and I'll have to say the show lived up to my expectations. If you haven't seen it yet, here's the story.
Hideki, an 18 year old who grew up on the countryside, moves to the Tokyo area and discovers Persocoms. He can't even come close to having enough money to buy one. While walking home, he saw what he thought to be a dead person, but was actually a Persocom thrown out. He looks everywhere to find the swich, and finally finds it in a very bad spot. She ""wakes up"" and all she can say is ""Chii"", getting her name. With the help of his neighbors Shinbo, Minoru, and the Landlady, Hideki teaches Chii common sense among other things, and she even gets a job.
This volume is as good as the others, including an episode where Hideki and the gang go to the beach, which I found very funny.
Cute, funny, and even sentimental at times, Chobits is everything and more you would want in an anime. It is HIGHLY recommended and I plan on watching it again soon!",1058140800,6,1013,4.22680412371134
