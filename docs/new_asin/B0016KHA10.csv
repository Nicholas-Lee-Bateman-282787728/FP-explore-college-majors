3157523,5,B0016KHA10,"Catherine Bell does an outstanding job as Cassie, a mysterious young woman who has just moved to town.  Her compassion for others, both children and adults is her dominating characteristic.  The movie is romantic, humorous and serious all at the same time.  I have seen this movie several times on television and loved it each time.  I would highly recommend it to families or students for the life lessons in concern for others that it teaches!",1216944000,4,445,4.815789473684211
3157524,5,B0016KHA10,"Catherine Bell (JAG, Army Wives) shines again on another project. CB just shows that she can do it all-first action -adventure, drama, and now romantic comedy! This time she plays Cassie, a sweet and mysterious young woman who moves into a town run by a stuffy wife of the mayor. Cassie teaches about tolerance and looking at yourself in a postive way. Very strong message for kids. My niece and nephew loved it and ask when will there be a sequel! As does their aunt! Buy it- won't be disappointed!!",1209254400,110,500,4.566666666666666

3157553,5,B0016KHA10,"I've been a fan of Catherine Bell since she was on Army Wives. After following her on Instagram I learned about her acting and producing roles in Good Witch. When I discovered Season 1 on Netflix I was elated and fell in love with the show. I love the pure simplicity of it, particularly in this day and age of teenage reality shows, outrageous cursing and bloody violence. Don't get me wrong: I appreciate a good movie just like anyone else and am not opposed to blood and violence; it's just that sometimes it's nice to just sit back with a glass of wine and immerse myself in a show that, for whatever reason I can't quite pinpoint, makes me feel happy and relaxed. I watched Seasons 2 (on Neflix) and 3 (iTunes) before ordering this movie and I realize I'm going a little backward. Since then I have watched three more and plan on finishing it all! I love the characters, the persnickety Mrs. Tinsdale, the handsome Jake (movies) and Dr. Sam (television series). I truly enjoy watching these....perfect for the entire family.",1513209600,,1029,4.5978260869565215

3157564,5,B0016KHA10,"*Some spoilers if you're new to the Good Witch series.*

If you're new to the Good Witch series, watching the first movie is a no-brainer. Don't do what I did and start watching the TV series and wonder where the ""magic"" is. I was expecting something along the lines of Bewitched, but the ""witch"" here is more a mystery. Is she a real ""witch"" with actual powers, or just a New-Agey woman who has a high sense of intuition? You won't see magic wands, spells, or nose-twitching, but you will see a woman who always seems to know what people need and gently ""manipulates"" them through ""witchy"" mind tricks to follow the right direction.

As a Good Witch veteran, I love rewatching the original. Middleton was a little more rough around the edges then. While the TV series makes the town look like a planned community where everyone makes $100,000 or more a year, the original wasn't afraid to show a homeless guy, a young boy living in a run-down trailer in the woods and being abused by his father, and a guy with an aggressive doberman. Even the mayor's wife, Martha, insinuates that Grey House may be housing a drug lab. Speaking of whom, I also kind of miss the days when Martha was a real adversary and not just the annoying town busybody.",1507507200,6,1241,4.511111111111111

I asked her if she saw any of the movies made and she hadn't, so, I gave her the boxed set as one of her gifts at Christmas. She is waiting till I come home for the summer to watch them with her. I know she will love them as much as I do. The only problem I found with this set was the very first one isn't there. I had to order that one separately. And the last two aren't there either.

3157787,5,B0016KHA10,"Not what I was expecting. I normally don't watch witchcraft anything, but there is more witchcraft that went on in ""Bewitched"" than there is in this series of movies. Nothing witch like going on, other than herbal remedies and a highly perceptive woman's intuition. I really liked how Cassie  is creative about solving problems with relationships with family members and others. People solve their own problems by taking her suggestions, but do it through their own strength, not by magic. No special magical brews or spells, even though it's highly suggested with looks and back ground music. There is also a value system that is put into place on how to talk, respect others, consequences of lying and dressing appropriately. Highly recommend.",1465948800,,745,5.10655737704918

Very cute and wholesome movies with no particularly religious slant and no agenda-- good for pagan families or Christians or atheists.

Catherine Bell has a lot to do with my enjoyment of this little gem. It's a simple story, but it's told very well and shot rather well. The pacing is good and Catherine Bell is beautiful and charming. It feels like mostly fluff, as these movies tend to be, but there were a couple of unexpected moments of depth and solid acting. Things not usually called for in these types of movies. A couple of technical notes, however: it is in 4:3 ration, as this was a time before many widescreen TV's. Also, the DVD transfer I have seems to suffer from random, momentary skips, like a couple of frames were cut out. Most people may not notice, but I did. Also, story wise, it set up for a great finale that didn't really happen. Perhaps that gets fleshed out in the next film, which I have yet to see, but it felt like a very abrupt ending, and the main story line seemed to be left unresolved. Otherwise, it's a lot of fun and I look forward to catching up with the rest of the series!",1452556800,2,1103,4.232227488151659

However, I don't understand the packaging decision. Why would you not include the first movie; one that you need to fully appreciate the series? I also wish the latest movies would be released.",1433030400,,377,4.544117647058823

3158032,5,B0016KHA10,One of my new guilty pleasures discovered on the Hallmark channel.  It is romantic comedy/fantasy grounded in enough reality to willingly suspend disbelief.  The first season sent me look for the movies to understand the background to how Cassie and her family came to be.  This movie is the first in giving her arrival story to town.  Others I hope to find and watch will fill in other details.,1432857600,,395,4.681159420289855

It's nice to see something with so much warmth and charm, with endearing and sometimes comedic characters, a lovely small town as a backdrop, and a sense of taking you out of the stress of everyday life into a special place with special people.  Thank you, Hallmark Channel for producing this.  I intend to see the whole franchise of movies, as well as the current TV series.

We can be critical and judgmental of people and situations or we can work with what is offered. The lead actress has a smile that is so loving,i always want more. While watching,i am always reminded that we have a mind set,and I  may have a different mind set. I guess this why they call it the Good  Which. It can also compare favorably with the best motivational seminars,in my humble opinion. After watching this collection,i will buy all new sets when they are released.

3158154,4,B0016KHA10,I enjoyed the whole series. It's very Rewatchable. The actors are marvelous and the story lines are good. My only complaint is it's pace is so quick it sometimes takes away from being engrossed in the movie. Its as if the writers had so many good ideas they crammed it all in at once.

3158170,2,B0016KHA10,"I was so happy to get these, as I have long owned the first movie.  Why, then, do none of these four movies have closed caption (or subtitles in English) OR scene selection?  I assume any DVD will have both of those options, and the first at least had CC.  With these, the only option you have is to play the entire movie.  If you stop or pause, it will pick back up where you left.  Love this series, but what DVDs come out with no subtitles or scene selections nowadays?  Selecting the root menu just takes me back to ""Play Movie"".  If someone has any suggestions to correct this, please let me know!",1425686400,,602,4.228070175438597

A young couple's romance, family friendly. Our mystery woman arrives unseen in a small town where everyone knows everyone and mainstreet is still open. We learn she has inhereted the large, abandoned mansion. Catherine Bell is at once mysterious, spunky, a rebel, sweet, moral, kind-hearted, intimidating, cute, wise, vulnerable, tough, and all-around absolutely adorable and lovable. She produces the series, and I don't grow tired of the story. See why this is a much beloved modern tv-movie series for years.",1421020800,,882,5.1678321678321675

3158329,5,B0016KHA10,"This series is just plain wonderful, every single episode. I was hooked from the very first one I saw on Hallmark (""The Good Witch"") and was thrilled to see them extend it into a series. It's a combination of reality and fantasy. Reality: There's no such thing as ""real"" witches. Fantasy: But then again...!?! I intend to have all of them in my collection as soon as they come out on DVD. Catherine Bell is wonderful in her role as Cassandra Nightengale, the ""witch."" She dispenses warmth and wisdom, understanding, and love. One of the things about this series that really impresses me is the segue from one episode to the next - it all makes sense, it all ties together, and the skill of the supporting cast - the ensemble - makes it all the more delightful. You watch the children grow up, a family grow stronger, friendships blossom, a community pull together... In case you haven't figured it out by now, I highly recommend this collection and if you don't already have the first one I recommend that you get it, too.",1418256000,11,1022,4.559782608695652

The movies themselves, are predictable but enjoyable nevertheless, and they can be viewed by the whole family.",1418169600,,385,4.7164179104477615

3158339,3,B0016KHA10,"My daughter asked for this video set for Christmas, and upon first looking at this one on Amazon, found that it did not contain all of the movies that she had mentioned, but I bought it anyway. After some further looking on the internet, I did find the full collection, which contains two movies that Amazon's set does not, these being the first and last movies in the series. Also, the price for the 6 movie set was significantly cheaper than Amazon's 4 movie set. Both are produced by the same studio, and packaged and sold wholesale by the same company, as well. So, naturally, I sent the Amazon set back and purchased the complete set for less money, $30 as opposed to $35. Sometimes you have to watch the prices of what you buy from Amazon, many people think that they are always the lowest price on the internet, but shopping around sometimes finds this to not be true. Watch my other reviews for another example of a popular childs toy.",1417996800,66,943,4.488372093023256

Pleasant distraction for very old people, or people home sick and on medications. (The plot is extraordinarily simple.) Three stars for a kind-hearted film, celebrating open-mindedness, honest community members, helping one another, and happy endings in an era where the opposites of those values are widely prevalent. Especially liked the positive portrayal of the ""witch"", and an amazingly positive portrayal of the male lead, a policeman. It's a child's fantasy of what police should be like. If only.
You can see the producers were hoping to launch a ""Bewitched""- inspired series, and there are sequels...apparently.",1415664000,4,757,5.707964601769912

3158450,5,B0016KHA10,"The collection of 4 movies in this DVD is an excellent value and very good entertainment. The four movies from the Good Witch Series in this DVD are: The Good Witch's Garden, TheGood Witch's Gift, The Good Witch's family, and The Good Witch's Charm.

In each movie you will follow Cassie, the Good Witch, as she becomes settled in the town of Middleton and makes her home in Grey House. You will see her marry Chief Jake Russell and become part of his family. They will have a child of their own. There are challenges that need to be overcome in each movie, but Cassie always seems to know it will turn out OK. She uses some of her witch intuition and charm often and seems to know people well. I enjoyed each movie and would recommend the DVD.

3158451,5,B0016KHA10,"The Good Witch was an instant hit with my wife and I - we caught this one and the second one before hard times hit and we gave up cable and stuff. I noticed a couple of weeks ago they finally are releasing a set of the second through the fifth Good Witch movies. I pre-ordered that and decided to go ahead and get this one (the first movie.) And yes, I, too, find it odd that they wouldn't put the first movie in with the set but what the hey!

Catherine Bell, starred for nine seasons on Jag. While she did a good job as Sarah I never really think that role fitted all of her in that character. She did fit in nicely with the exceptional ensemble cast and guest actors during her Jag stint. I did not think her time on Army wives was really an exceptional event though she filled her role well, again, with a very good fellow cast.

With the Good Witch movies, however, the long hair (missing on Jag) and a very sincere and charming smile and grace - I believe she has finally found her best role as Cassie - The Good Witch. One that she clearly is the star and commands the screen. She is terrific and most of the cast works well together in a rather simple plotted movie series that is fairly wholesome and good family entertainment.

And I have read that a limited ten episodes season tv show will air as well this fall or next year - that's just fantastic.

You can't go wrong here folks - a good movie that won't win any Emmy's or probably any awards but you'll find it slowly warming your hearts. With a pre made family - the towns sheriff and his two kids - Cassie will continue to win fans and new viewers for years to come!",1412640000,,1633,4.141955835962145

3158475,5,B0016KHA10,"Me, I'll take what I can get. When I look back at the desolation that was a lack of available Good Witch movies on DVD, this collection suits me fine. And now I can take some strain off my DVR. In 2008 Hallmark caught lightning in a bottle when it aired&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-Witch-Hallmark/dp/B002SAMMEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good Witch (Hallmark)</a>, it was so good. Every year since, we've been treated to a Good Witch sequel, each one stoked with whimsy and humor and gentle reminders about the value of charity and tolerance and of second chances. How often can an actor claim two iconic recurring roles in their rsum? Catherine Bell - so unforgettable as Lt. Col. Sarah 'Mac' MacKenzie in JAG - has endeared herself further as Cassandra Nightingale, the enchanting stranger who inherited the infamous Grey House in sleepy Middleton, USA. She quickly makes herself to home, and soon Grey House is producing these odd smells. She cows a ferocious attack dog and fixes a bully. She dispenses casual wisdom to traumatized children. Her mysterious presence generates rampant rumors that she's the Grey Lady, ghost of Grey House. Yeah, funny things seem to happen around Cassie.

Oh, you can tell that Cassie isn't what she once was. As we go deeper into these films, we only ever learn a smidge of her past. What Cassie has is big imagination and an unconventional streak that allows her to live life on her own terms. The series maintains a persistent flirtation with its audience. Is Cassie a witch? Or does she instead simply possess keen powers of perception and observation? Maybe her enigmatic smile is conjured deliberately. Maybe she practices saying those cryptic remarks in front of a mirror. You won't catch her ruffled. You won't catch her being unkind or close minded. Cassie is the eternal optimist. And sometimes she's theatrical. A woman cultivates an air of mystery about her.

From jump we sense that Cassie Nightingale is a very lonely person. The Good Witch and onwards chart Cassie's putting down roots in Middleton, safe and done at last from her travels. We also see how capable she is at overcoming obstacles, most of which are erected by the mayor's snoopy, small-minded wife. By dint of six - soon to be seven - movies, Cassie has come to feel like an old and trusted friend. Out of the ether Catherine Bell has snatched allure and enigma and also gentleness and impeccable insight, and bottled all that up in Cassie. Bell is pitch perfect. And I love the Russell family - the widower who happens to be Middleton's Chief of Police (Chris Potter) and his two children just starving for a loving mom. They ground Cassie. It's so endearing, the absolute faith the Russell kids have in her. I love how kind and generous Cassie is, and how intuitive she is, and how wise, and how she always sees the good in people. Who wouldn't want a problem-solving good witch living in their neighborhood? I've got two in mine. Or I think they're witches. They both of them have odd smells coming from their houses.

This DVD set has four of The Good Witch movies. No, the original Good Witch is absent, as are the sixth and seventh installments, The Good Witch's Destiny (2013) and The Good Witch's Wonder (2014). But I'll take what's here, and happily.

Oh, but I am fiendishly jonesing for the recently announced The Good Witch ongoing series, set to broadcast in February 2015, a date that cannot come fast enough.

I'm not sure - maybe plot SPOILERS now?

- The Good Witch's Garden (2009) - Middleton is prepping for its 200th year anniversary garden gala, this time to be held at Grey House. Except, to supplement her income, ""the most untraditional woman in town"" converts Grey House into a bed & breakfast inn. Wouldn't you know it, that her first tenant is a stranger who means to claim Grey House for his own on strength of a more direct bloodline and an ironclad chain of title naming him as sole heir.

- The Good Witch's Gift (2010) - It's silver bells and wedding bells for a good witch. In an unexpected swerve - because Cassie is THE spontaneous one - her down-to-earth fianc, the Chief of Police, suggests they get hitched on Christmas Eve. That's seven days away, yo! Also, Chief Russell frets about the return of an ex-con whom he had arrested more than ten years ago for a bank robbery. Is he in Middleton to see his estranged family or to exact revenge on the Chief?

- The Good Witch's Family (2011) - Three challenging years in Middleton - during which time she'd been shunned as an outsider and accused of witchcraft - but Cassie is finally accepted enough in the community that she's nominated to run for mayor. But I doubt she'll catch a vote from her vindictive long-lost cousin who's shown up on Cassie's doorstep for an extended visit and proceeds to try to shred her new family apart.

- The Good Witch's Charm (2012) - Middleton is judged as one of the ten most charming towns in North America. So imagine the furor and the townwide harrumphing when a baffling glitch caught on video during an interview with new mayor Cassie raises unwholesome gossip that she's a witch - and this time the rumor's gone viral. It's SO not a good time for a crime wave - a rash of shoplifting incidents - to hit Middleton. Or for Cassie's controlling foster mother to come a-visiting out of the blue.

Now if they would only release the DVDs for the sixth and seventh movies, The Good Witch's Destiny (2013) and The Good Witch's Wonder (2014). Man, that sweet someday.",1408924800,58,5563,4.755440414507772

She has a way about her that you get the feeling that she couldn't do what she does without supernatural powers.  However, as the movie progresses, you understand that she has great intuition about people and probably understands them better than they understand themselves.  She very subtly introduces hints about themselves to them..... and it's as if a light bulb goes off and they finally get it, so to speak.

Old movie fans will catch that Cassie's store is named the Bell Book and Candle, 1958 Kim Novak and Jimmy Stewart movie with witchcraft.
Cassie's 'witchcraft' is more about positive thinking (Lori's dreams), confidence (bullying). I think it would be a good movie for kids.
My one COMPLAINT is the DVD had the abrupt stops for commercials......",1396483200,,451,4.934210526315789

Catherine Bell delivers as a beautiful and knowledgeable women who uses herbal remedies and an understanding of-how human beings and nature-cycle together- to transform a small fearful and backward town into a loving and charitable one.

It is nice to see that those "" chicken soup remedies"" that grandma spoke of are still alive and able to deliver!  Good for the whole family",1392595200,,744,4.796875

3158537,3,B0016KHA10,"An odd movie, I was amazed to learn that its quite popular and has sprouted many sequels.  For a so-called romance though, its really quite tepid and routine, not to mention chaste.
The writing was less than inspired; the scenes were abrupt with awkward time changes (days fluttered by, highlighting an event or two).  In the end it just felt like a few bits and pieces strung together, there was no natural flow to the story.
As for the plot, a strange woman (Catherine Bell as Cassandra Nightingale) shows up in a quiet town ruled by a domineering woman/chairperson Martha Tinsdale (Catherine Disher).  Instantly accused of witchcraft (the dark arts), Cassandra becomes the target of the comically evil Martha who wants Cassandras house and business ruined to suit a nefarious scheme of her own.  Heres where things get a little skewed.  Throughout this film, the law is broken multiple times with no repercussions to anyone.  The town sheriff (Chris Potter) is entirely ineffectual in upholding the law, which is either poor writing or an intentional message that if youve got a good enough excuse for breaking the law, your transgressions will be overlooked in this slap-happy town in the middle of nowhere ruled by a cruel and crazy woman, who under normal circumstances, would be considered the resident witch.

Nothing about this movie warrants a second viewing, nor did it charm me enough to want to seek out the rest of the series.  Eh.",1383955200,2,1445,4.89344262295082

3158557,5,B0016KHA10,"We LOVE the Good Witch series.  The only one that has been put on DVD & sold is the very first one.  Why can you release the remainder movies on DVD?  I thought once I was going to get the set from a ""sub distributor"" but that didn't materialize. They wanted my bank account # & routing # to purchase it, wouldn't accept credit cards, which I refused to do.  They even said they would send me a bill and I could mail them a check.  That was 1 1/2 months ago and I am still waiting for the bill.  I guess that was a hoax.  We have all the other movies taped from our DVR, but if the DVR has a problem then we loose them.  I know that if you put the rest of the series out for sale A LOT of people will buy them.  Thanks for listening.",1374537600,,733,3.801324503311258

3158559,5,B0016KHA10,"Love this first in a series of Good Witch episodes produced by Hallmark.  The only downside to the series is that Hallmark has not made all of the episodes available on DVD.

3158562,5,B0016KHA10,I have watched this movie so much that I think I might need to buy a new DVD. The Good Witch is about a small town that is set in their ways. Then a woman moves to town and she is different than everyone else. She is met with prejudice behavior and no matter how kind she tries to be everyone is afraid of her. Great movie and great lesson.,1373760000,,340,3.8714285714285714
3158563,5,B0016KHA10,"First off, I love the movie. Seen it many times on Hallmark channel, so thought I should buy it. So I'll skip the usual blurb about what the movie is about and such. Suffice it to say, I love how it treats the Craft and witches in general in a good light.

This movie was due for delivery on the tenth, lucky for me, it arrived yesterday, on the 8th. So again, super fast delivery. Thank you folks at Amazon!

Now, if Hallmark would just start disc-ing the lot, as far as the rest of the movies go, I would buy the set. COME ON HALLMARK get with the program! You have niche buyers out here!",1373328000,,590,4.077586206896552
3158564,4,B0016KHA10,"This movie has a good mixture of sweetness, humor, and a bit of social commentary. When someone a little bit different moves to a small town, it takes awhile for the locals to appreciate her, but her good heart wins out. Definitely a feel good movie... especially for those who identify themselves as good witches!",1372118400,,314,4.7272727272727275

3158567,5,B0016KHA10,this is a beautiful series.  a little bit of mystery to it .  delightful for family to watch.  we have watched it many times and never get tired of watching it.  would highly recommend this whole series for family viewing.  it is hard to find good clean entertainment these days.,1370476800,,279,4.5
3158568,5,B0016KHA10,"I ordered it on a Friday and it was here on a Monday. It was how the seller said it was to be. I have been looking for this movie since the first time i watched it. Thank You very much, i Love it.",1370304000,,196,3.477272727272727
3158569,5,B0016KHA10,"I first saw ""The Good Witch"" through Hulu and found it a wonderful and creative movie. Once I had seen this movie I was convinced I had to own it for my DVD collection. Since I found ""The Good Witch"" through Amazon I am not sorry for my purchase.",1370217600,,246,4.040816326530612
3158570,5,B0016KHA10,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Good Witch was really quite clean. There was low cut shirts and dresses; a couple has wine over dinner; and a tasteful scene where a woman buys some aromatherapy oils to improve the intimacy between herself and her husband. It is not rated and the Dove Foundation gave it a four star and approved it for 12+.

I love this movie and have watched it multiple times.  It is the only ""Good Witch"" movie out on DVD.  I originally saw this movie on Hallmark Channel and bought the DVD immediately.  Most people might skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".

I love all the characters: Cassie (the good witch), Jake (the widowed Sheriff), Brandon and Lori (the sheriff's two children), George (their mother's father who lives with them), Derek (sheriff's deputy), Kyle (school bully then Brandon's friend), Nancy (town's travel agent/member of the citizen's league/friend and customer of Cassie), Martha (mayor's wife and person responsible for wanting ""The Witch"" out of town).

She wins the approval of the Sheriff almost immediately and Cassie helps Lori with her bad dreams and Brandon with the school bully.  She even helps Grandfather George.  But before she can truly become part of Middleton, she will need to win over some of the more skeptical neighbors who don't approve of her unique ways.  Especially the mayor's wife, Martha.  She tries to get Cassie's shop closed and hopefully push her out of town.

The rest of this six part series are all worth watching and buying.  They are clean, uplifting and teach great lessons about trust, love and family.

""THE GOOD WITCH'S GARDEN"": Cassie has settled into Middleton and is busy making a home of Grey House. Her boyfriend, Sheriff Jake Russell, and his kids are happy to have Cassie in the neighborhood, but she has yet to gain the trust of some people in town.  Before long, a stranger rolls into town with papers entitling him to legal ownership of Grey House. Before she knows it, Cassie is left without a home and is convinced Middleton isn't where she belongs. Ultimately, everyone will learn holding on too tightly to something can make it more likely that thing will slip through your fingers.

""THE GOOD WITCH'S GIFT"":  Cassandra Nightingale always has a few tricks up her sleeve, but is surprised when her handsome sweetheart, Police Chief Jake Russell, proposes. Getting into the spirit of the season, they set their wedding date for Christmas Eve--only six days away!  As the two hurry to plan the wedding, trouble clouds their happiness when a mysterious man from Jake's past returns to town.

""THE GOOD WITCH'S FAMILY"":  Life is going well for Cassie as she settles into marriage with Middleton Police Chief Jake Russell and as stepmom to Brandon and Lori. But evil soon blows into town in the form of Cassie's long-lost cousin Abigail, who whips up wickedness like a tornado. The once peaceful Russell family bickers night and day; Jake is fired after an argument with the Mayor over a bridge expansion; and Martha, the Mayor's wife and town busy body, walks out on her long marriage. As the town divides further over neighborhood expansion, Cassie is drafted to run for Mayor. With in her once-happy marriage, her family is unraveling, and Abigail's diabolical ""double, double, toil and trouble"" is the apex of Cassie's misery. What's a good witch to do?

""THE GOOD WITCH'S CHARM"":  Good Witch Cassie Nightingale is back to her bewitching ways, but this time shes also juggling a newborn daughter and her job as town Mayor. With such a busy schedule she and her husband, town sheriff Jake Russell, aren't getting much sleep. Hoping for a break, Cassie plans a much needed vacation with her new family. But things go awry when a crime wave sweeps through town and an investigative reporter tries to ruin Cassies image after a video of her magically disappearing turns up on the internet. Supported by her loyal family and friends, Cassie must rely on her signature charm to put a stop to the troubles before they completely destroy the town, and a Good Witchs reputation!

""THE GOOD WITCH'S DESTINY"": (which is still in production): ""There's something definitely magical about Cassie Nightingale. But when even her loved ones start to wonder how Cassie seems to know everything and be everywhere, the good witch senses that she's in for a rough ride... It begins with stepdaughter Lori's writing project, the story of the Grey Lady who once lived in their house many years ago  and who shared more than the same birthday and an amazing physical likeness with Cassie. Then Drew arrives in Middleton, a boastful young man prone to investing fortunes into hopeless scams and blaming others when his projects fail. The person responsible  in his eyes  for his current fiasco and his fiance's break-up with him is Cassie. And the vibes he is sending out in her direction are definitely laced with danger. Lori then discovers the Grey Lady's journal which suddenly breaks off on her birthday, which is also Cassie's. As her family fears for her safety, Cassie resolves to clear up the hocus-pocus concerning Drew and the Grey Lady with a tried-and-true method: humor, openness and the acceptance of one's destiny.""

Overall, I love this movie and the 4 (soon to be 5) others in this series and will definitely watch it/them over and over again.  I can't wait for all of them to be out on DVD.  I will definitely be purchasing the whole series.",1369785600,2,5616,4.8097713097713095

3158587,5,B0016KHA10,"Catherine Bell is wonderful as Cassie, the ""good witch"". There are ""good guys"" and ""bad guys""- very well played by the different characters. There is a storyline, but the interaction of the good and bad and the little magical touches are even more important than the plot. This is a delightful family film, more about family and honesty than witchcraft, which is really a small but fun part of the story. This is the first in a series, can't wait for the rest of the series to come out on DVD.

I wonder if ""The Good Witch"" was made in 16x9.  Besides being portrayed by a beautiful & charming actress, Catharine Bell, the character of Cassie Nightingale has a subtle magic (subtler than ""Bewitched"" or ""Harry Potter) based on strong intuition, sensitivity to others's needs & a psychological gift for ministering to the needs of the other.

3158620,4,B0016KHA10,"This is a pleasant, easy-going fantasy movie that will probably not rustle the feathers of most viewers. When an old abandoned house with a scary reputation suddenly becomes occupied by a beautiful and mysterious young woman the town's curiosity is aroused and tongues start wagging. Who is this strange young woman, where did she come from and why is she there? The mayor's wife develops an instant dislike for her and quickly begins to plan on steps to get her out of town.

When the young woman opens a shop in town the people are both alarmed and curious by the unusual nature of the shop; is this woman more than she appears, does her presence in town present a potential danger to the town? Here is a situation which requires attention and action and that is what this movie is about.

Catherine Bell plays the part of Cassie Nightingale, the mysterious young woman with grace and charm and quickly becomes a compelling character with whom the viewer can sympathize. Chris Potter plays the part of Jake Russell, a level headed-police chief who has to keep a lid on the town's overreaction to the mysterious young woman.

This made for TV movie is rated TV PG and is good for all ages.",1351296000,2,1190,4.60377358490566

However there is some HORRIFIC acting in it which kinda puts a damper on the whole thing. The kids acting is mediocre at times (which is understandable and can be overlooked), but the acting of the character or Martha (the mayor's wife) is beyond awful. She is ridiculously bad (almost laughable in her portrayal of a small minded housewife on a power trip) and I have no idea how this actress landed any kind of role in a televised production. The scenes without here are decent and the basic story is good. But the bad acting of Martha ruines the rest of the movie. I'm tempted to see the sequels, but not without first seeing if the actress who plays the mayor's wife is not in them. If so I think I'll pass.",1345161600,2,810,4.370860927152318

Yes, the story has been told many times and in many ways, but this is a refreshing and charming film based on a good witch and a widower sheriff who fall in love.

Cassie was much more like most witches I have met.  This movie helps witches to come out of the closet and reminds us that there is nothing necessarily scary or demonic about witchcraft.

The story was a bit trite, but it advertised itself as a ""feel good"" movie and that is what it is.  My only wonder is why didn't Cassie wear a pentacle or something, like most witches? Indeed, there was not even a pentacle on display in her shop.  It seems the makers of the film wanted to tone down her witchiness by avoiding most symbols of witchcraft (with the exception of the broom); I think they went overboard in an effort to present her as a benign, all-American woman.  This I think was a mistake.

But all in all, a good movie.",1318636800,2,960,4.6117647058823525

3158657,5,B0016KHA10,"""The Good Witch"" is a great upbeat film starring Catherine Bell as emotionally resilient and benevolent witch Cassandra Nightingale.  The character of Cassandra Nightingale moves to the town of Middleton because she inherited a mansion, and is hoping that the long-time residents welcome her.  She soon bonds with a widowed policeman father Jake Russell (played by Chris Potter) and his two children.  She opens up her own business of magical items and soon encounters resistance from those who have a challenging time accepting her and figuring her out due to her unique personality.  The character of Cassandra Nightingale has a big heart, but it matters little to the Mayors wife Martha (played by Catherine Disher).  Martha instantly treats Cassandra coldly upon first meeting her.  Martha eventually petitions to try to drive Cassandra to leave town again.  Cassandra at first considers and wonders whether she made the right decision in moving to Middleton.  This is only because she longs to find a place where she can feel like she belongs and is accepted. Cassandra Nightingale yearns for the sense of acceptance and belonging. Jake Russell sees the good and potential in her and urges Cassandra to reconsider her decision in moving.  He persuasively reasons with her by mentioning how she has ran away from so much in her life that she needs to stop running away.  Hearing this statement resonated with me, and I am glad that I followed the prompting of my spirit to watch this movie.  I only say this because I appreciate where I live, and I now intend to permanently settle in the D.C. area.  However, less than three months ago (May 2011), I admit that I at first wondered if I made the right decision in choosing to stay in the D.C. area. In addition, I also know what its like to desire the feeling of a sense of belonging and acceptance. Luckily, I received a series of personal confirmations that choosing to stay in the D.C. area is the most joyful decision.  For me to watch a movie that featured a character going through a similar situation with this was very healing for me.  I intend to watch the other movie sequels to ""Good Witch"".  ""Good Witch"" is best for anyone that enjoys a feel good and uplifting film to watch.",1315699200,4,2242,4.772020725388601

This film is the first of ""Good Witch"" movies. The Second is ""The Good Witch Garden"", and the third is ""The Good Witch Gift"". This is the 3 films I know with the actress Catherine Bell playing as Cassie.

I can't wait for the time of the official release of the next two movies. When Released, I will buy also the other two [Although I have the 3rd because the Television Showed it Last Christmas (2010) and I Recorded it with my DVD Recorder on a DVD-R]

3158669,5,B0016KHA10,"Catherine Bell's Cassie Nightingale is the coolest good witch on the planet.  She's a cross between Samantha Stevens and a cool earth mother type of new age shrink in great clothes.  She has this cool familiar, a black cat named Isis, lots of magical remedies and potions in her home and shop, bakes killer cookies, and has a messy run-down home of which she is obviously the heir.

This movie won me over the first time I saw it on Hallmark, and I love how she doesn't solve the problems, but tricks people into solving their own.  Magic?  Depends on how you look at it!  I think it all boils down to possessing a bewitching charm.  She strikes up a friendship with Lori and Brandon, kids of the local cop Jake Russell, then later a low-burn steamy romance with him.  She seems to charm everyone except for the local uptight priss, Martha Tinsdale, who will do anything to make trouble for Cassie because, like too many people, she fears what she doesn't understand.

Best of all, we also have The Good Witch's Garden, in which some guy pretends to be an heir of Gray House and is encouraged to make trouble by Marth Tinsdale--of course.  We also now have The Good Witch's Gift, in which Brandon takes a shine to a girl whose dad is a convict and has a tough row to hoe.  Miracle of Miracles?  Martha does an about face and finally accepts Cassie in the community!

Pleasant surprises await you with each addition of this wonderful Hallmark family trilogy, and you are never either too young or too old to enjoy fantasy with a touch of subtle reality in the guise of gently taught morals on treating others as you would like them to treat you.  This is what I'd like to know:  when can we get all three movies in one package?  You don't want to miss a single one!",1301702400,3,1764,4.398148148148148

There is just something about her; she seems to cast a ""spell"" over almost everyone in town (except for the mayor's wife), and I couldn't help falling in love with her along with them!  Catherine Bell is wonderful in this role, and I also loved Chris Potter as the sheriff.  I would love to own the next two movies on DVD, ""The Good Witch's Garden"" and ""The Good Witch's Gift"".

3158674,5,B0016KHA10,"The community has plans for the old haunted house, when a mysterious woman Cassandra Nightingale (Catherine Bell) shows up with the deed. Right off we look at her sneaky charming small and think witch.  Witch or not the local busybody and snot Martha Tinsdale (Catherine Disher) hates visitors that suggest change. Now all Cassie wants is a loving family, so she says. She starts out making friends with the local police chief (Chris Potter) and the chiefs family. He uses her wiles and obvious psychology to right many wrongs committed by locals.

Even though this was written to make you wander if Cassie really is witchy or not. The production is too superficial and pushes ""in your face"" clues as locks that won't unlock and dialog as ""I will not dream of bunnies."" Yet it is still fun to watch and see how the different characters handle their situation. This is typical Hallmark. You may remember Catherine Bell from 'The Triangle' (2005 TV movie).",1298419200,,954,4.810975609756097

3158678,5,B0016KHA10,"This is a story about a woman who moves into a scary old house in a well-to-do neighborhood where some neighbors decide she is a menance because she appears to have special, undesireable witch-like talents, despite her never having done anything to them; she is simply seeking a place to call home, where people care about others.

As the story progresses, you learn that her most special talent is that she is a gentle, loving person, and through her good will, gains the acceptance of the neighbors and finally has a place to call home.

As with most Hallmark films, this story is very wholesome and great for the whole family. The story emphasizes tolerance and accepting of people who may be different than ourselves.",1293667200,,721,4.76

It shows a woman of intuition and insight using her wits.  Though there is a nod to witchcraft, it's not really overt or overstated.

That said, this movie is fun, lighthearted, and yes, even typical....boy meets girl....trouble ensues....etc.

It's so nice to see a movie that everyone in the family can enjoy, and also one that doesn't portray witches in such a negative light.  Hollywood has done much damage in that regard over the years and this was just so refreshing.

I wanted to purchase the other movie I heard of, The Good Witches Garden, but I don't see that is available.  I'm hoping that Hallmark runs these two movies in October again, so I can see the second one also.

3158695,5,B0016KHA10,"What I enjoy the most about ""The Good Witch"" is that it's not the typical Hallmark cookie cutter TV movie that they're famous for. This movie is special because it has a lot of great standout performances, centering on a great plot. OK some of the acting is ""Murder, She Wrote"" worthy, but overall it's a heartwarming picture that your entire family will appreciate.

Catherine Bell plays Cassie, in the title role and she is just amazing. This is the first time I have ever seen her in anything and she comes off as believable and relatable. Watching Ms. Bell was like watching an old friend that I had known for years. It's a rare actress that can capture that type of sentiment and emotion for her viewers within the first few minutes like Ms. Bell has done.

The character of Cassie is my very favorite. She's a little mysterious and a little esoteric and always knows how to solve other people's problems. Chris Potter was also really great as the local sheriff and the two made a lovely couple in the movie because she was the ying for his yang.

One of the main messages that I got from ""The Good Witch"" is the importance of compassion. Even though some of the people in her town were less than hospitable (such as the mayor's gossipy wife), Cassie was able to keep a cheerful disposition. And in the end there's a shocking outcome, I don't want to give it away but I will say that Cassie was able to forgive which I'm sure is a lot more than most people could do if presented with the same situation of circumstances.

If you're looking for an extraordinary movie about just an ordinary lady, watch ""The Good Witch."" Remember, only bad witches are ugly.",1283385600,2,1661,4.490066225165563
3158696,5,B0016KHA10,Love this great family movie from Hallmark. Is a very good Halloween holiday movie. Can't wait until I can buy The Good Witch's Garden.,1282521600,,135,4.666666666666667
3158697,5,B0016KHA10,"Every small town has its legends, and often one of them will involve a haunted house. In this case the local haunted house even has a ghost with a long standing identity, ""The Grey Lady"".

When Casandra Nightingale moves in, there is initially some confusion as to whether she is the heir she claims to be, or possibly the ghost herself! As it turns out, Casandra is not a ghost, just a witch. LOL But a good one. She opens an apothecary downtown, and dispenses sage advice and confidence building charms where and when they will do the most good. In the process she helps out the children of the town's police chief.

However, all is not friendly and quiet in this little town. The mayor's wife is an enemy for several reasons, and someone is trying to make her feel decidedly unwelcome ...

""The Good Witch"" will remind you of any number of the charming books you may have read as a youngster, and does a great job of developing a feeling of being in and belonging in a fictional small town setting. Catherine Bell is excellent as the good witch who doesn't get too flustered no matter what she is up against, doing her best to win over her detractors through open friendliness rather than matching their antagonism. That in itself is a good lesson learned.",1282003200,,1259,4.5131578947368425

3158699,5,B0016KHA10,"This is a movie favorite in our home. We only wish that those who produce movies and tv would get the hint-the majority of viewers are fed up with the constant diet of movies and television shows with the same, tired old subject-drugs, profanity, and all of the other sad subjects of life that go along with it. This is a real ""feel good"" movie that allows the viewer to walk away at the end with a smile. Even though some would call it corny, we will take a thousand of the same kind of shows, because after all, wasn't the original concept of movies supposed to take us away from our day-to-day problems and give us a reprieve, (even though a short-lived one in some cases). Forget reality tv and movies-give me something I can truly enjoy! Thank you Catherine Bell for your wonderful movies, and I hope, many more to come.

Everything in this movie from the lack of anything dirty (like in dirt) to it's syrupy whiteness does nothing but teach an avoidance of all the issues that are devastatingly real to the rest of the world.

3158706,4,B0016KHA10,"To be different is to tempt being shunned or made terrible fun of, and THE GOOD WITCH resurrects that old chestnut. A mysterious stranger moves into the town of Middleton, and this being that sort of town, the rumors are soon flying thick as flies. It doesn't help that Cassandra Nightingale takes up residence at the ""Grey House,"" the dilapidated local haunted mansion. With everyone speculating whether Cassie is the frightening Grey Lady come back to life, the mayor's prudish, imperious wife Mrs. Tinsdale soon embarks on her persecution crusade, accusing Cassie of practicing the dark arts and petitioning to throw her out of town. Jake Russell, the town sheriff and a widower of three years, finds himself caught in the middle. Because Cassie, with her enigmatic ways, is giving credence to all the gossip. The sheriff is faced with having to enforce the mayor's wife's vindictiveness even as he becomes attracted to the newcomer.

Magic... or just good old psychology at work? Believing that she has certain, er, arcane powers, several in the community approach Cassie with their problems. But if you listen close you'll hear buried in Cassie's whimsical mumbo jumbo some sound advice, a spoonful of common sense, a certain knowledge of human behavior. THE GOOD WITCH, another good 'un from the Hallmark Channel, sets up the mystery of whether Cassie is truly a witch and there's enough tension and Cassie does just enough weird stuff that you're kept guessing. Because Cassie can soothe the savage beast, can tame dream monsters, and then she even opens up an herbal shop she calls Bell, Book & Candle (she charges $5 for each of her merchandise). Oh, Mrs. Tinsdale, Middleton's champion busybody, she's really up in arms now. Meanwhile, Cassie is sneakily improving the lot in life of certain of the townspeople.

Part of me wishes the sexy Colonel MacKenzie were still trading courtroom barbs with Commander Rabb, but the role of Cassandra Nightingale is a terrific change of pace for Catherine Bell, and she's still as gorgeous as ever, as, er, bewitching as ever, and here she shows off her playful side. THE GOOD WITCH is a family teleplay, and it does teach lessons of tolerance and open-mindedness and perseverance. Pay attention and you just may suss out that even a violent bully may be going thru his own hell, that a homeless drunk can still contribute if given a chance, that an alluring unorthodox stranger residing in a scary mansion with a black cat doesn't necessarily equate to ""Witch!"" Or maybe it does. THE GOOD WITCH leaves you to make up your own mind. And I like that.

Given it's low cost I guess this is somewhat understandable but definitely a disappointment.  That knocks off a star.

While this didn't affect my rating, I am surprised that the original aspect ratio of this film is 4:3.  You would think a film made in 2007 would have been 16:9.

Update Dec. 2012: A recent viewing of this movie on the Hallmark Movie Channel shows that they do have an HD widescreen version of the film but did not use the widescreen version for this DVD. Before I did not count off for the DVD version being 4:3 since I assumed the OAR had been 4:3 but now that I know a 16:9 version had been available this whole time I have to reduce my rating to two stars.

A lot of people can learn a lot of knowledge, from these movies, about life and how to decently treat people!  I hope it is turned into a series as I have read about in previous reviews!

Just from reading these reviews, apparently I am not alone with my opinion. Everyone seems to love this movie yet we are forced to either wait for the next airing of it or keep it forever on the DVR. Hallmark needs to listen to its audience if it wants us to keep coming back. If its acceptable to play on TV, then it should be acceptable for release. Apparently they are aware of how popular it is since they have a sequil to it airing soon. I don't get what the problem is but it makes me mad and they need to explain!",1233878400,,650,4.0859375

3158750,5,B0016KHA10,"I literally JUST finished seeing this sweet, magical film on the Hallmark Channel this morning.  I love that it celebrates diversity and belief in the healing power of magic (i.e., love), and the power and possibility in each moment.

This film spoke to me on many levels. I found the line ""They killed the magic"" especially poignant (when Bell spoke of the foster family who raised her) because her situation mirrored my own upbringing with parents way too fearful and strict.  The sweet handsome town sheriff figures out she's been ""on the run"" from love ever since, which I am trying to stop doing as we speak.

""The Good Witch"" also shows what happens when people stand up for the truth, even when it is difficult to do so.  It is a delight especially for those fond of Halloween, which absolutely includes me!  I was not that familiar with the work of Catherine Bell, but I have become a fan today.

This film is a great pilot for a potential series.  I rarely watch the Hallmark Channel but would faithfully watch this.  I would also buy this film in a hearbeat, but Amazon doesn't have it, Ebay doesn't have it, nobody has it.

3158756,5,B0016KHA10,"I absolutely loved The Good Witch, the romantic comedy-drama Hallmark made-for-TV movie, which I felt portrayed witchcraft in both a positive and a more realistic light. More importantly, the movie taught the virtue of tolerance toward people who may look, think, and believe differently than we do. This summer I was thrilled when Hallmark announced that the movie would be released on DVD, and then dismayed to learn that it had been suddenly pulled from production without explanation. After reading other fans' reviews, I was determined to get to the bottom of what had really happened, so I contacted Hallmark directly online. They responded, and I quote, ""It's being held temporarily, because ""The Good Witch"" is being made into a series."" What good news! Apparently, The Good Witch is a Hit! So all we fans have to do is be a little more patient, and keep watching the Hallmark Channel for more of The Good Witch!",1222905600,16,920,4.903846153846154

If it was just a money thing, we all need to bombard Hallmark with emails about a very BAD decision. I saved this on my DVR and can make a copy on a DVD, but it's not the same thing as a professional movie.

3158760,5,B0016KHA10,"After viewing many movies that paint the image of Witches in a very scary and bad light it is refreshing to find a movie that portrays the Wiccan folk in their true and harmoniously positive personality. Catherine Bell portrays to perfection the real charactor of a young witch who moves to a community after inheriting a legendary haunted  house left to her by a relative the ""Grey Lady"".She befriends the chief of police, who falls for her--bewitchment perhaps?-- and his family and using psychology and insight gives realy good advice that helps his daughter overcome nightmares,his son  befriend  the bully of his school and the grandfather regains a new interest in life. She helps a derelect through kindness and opportunity to regain self confidence and he becomes a repectable member of society all because she shows him kindness and his true self worth. She gives him a break and he gets back on his feet again.
Her nemisis,the mayor's wife who is haughty and bigotted tries to have her driven out of town and when her two sons vandalizes the Wiccan shop she just feels that  Cassie the witch had it coming and her boys were above punishment. Well the real turn around towards respect is a lesson to be learned by the boys when they are forgiven because Cassie didn't want their lives ruined with a criminal record against them. And as punishment the boys were made to clean up the mess they made of the shop.
This is a truely magical movie with a great lesson to learn and that is live and let live. Respect everyone and don't judge. Everyone has good in them and there is great potential in all of us.
I've watched the movie on the Hallmark Channel several times and I hope they plan to reprint and distribute. Of all the witchcraft movies I have ever watched this one gives a fair and human perspective to the time honored tradition of the magickal Healer.

3158765,5,B0016KHA10,"Although the actors were not at all familiar to me, and the ""feel"" of the movie is typical made for TV movie/Hallmark fair, please don't let this stop you from seeing this great ""feel good"" movie.

It seems as if I have seen this movie a million times as it feels formulaic and clichd but it somehow has a refreshing charm and character as told by a ""witch"" stranger who comes to a small town and moves into a mansion who no one notices at first.  The closest movie I could compare this to in terms of theme would be Elvira, Mistress of the Dark (1988).

Ok, now for the witchy part of this review:  The only God/dess mentioned is Isis, the name Cassandra's familiar, a black cat.  Her jewelry is non-descript, and I saw no alters or ritual tools in the background sets of her house (believe me I was looking for them), except for the most recognizable ""witch"" tool to muggles, a round broom that would appear at ""magical"" times throughout the movie with its own ""magical"" music.  There are Native American tools (dream catcher) and New Age tools (Crystal), but this only shows her eclectic nature.  The character is very good with herb and salve lore.  There are no rituals depicted unless you can call reciting a mantra such as ""I will not dream of bunnies"" a ritual.

To cannibalize Starhawks quote, the main character in the story Cassandra ""Changes everyone she touches"" both directly and indirectly for the better.  The theme of ""the truth/answer/solution/magic is within yourself, you only need to find it"" is pervasive throughout the movie and Cassandra is the catalyst that helps the other characters work through their problems.  Cassandra answers can best be described as spoken by an ""old soul,"" as she is very wise beyond her years.

Besides the general ""feel good"" nature of this movie, I highly recommend this movie as a ""coming out"" of the broom closet movie to show disapproving family and friends, as I cannot find one negative/incorrect treatment of Cassandra in this movie.  In short it paints ""wise women"" in a very positive and accurate light.  Some questions to ask after finishing watching this movie would be:  ""So what do you think of witches now?""  Followed by ""What would you say if I was/want to be one?""

I can only hope to see more positive/accurate media portraying witches in such a good light.",1217635200,32,2327,4.678132678132678

3392050,5,B0016KHA10,"I've been a fan of Catherine Bell since she was on Army Wives. After following her on Instagram I learned about her acting and producing roles in Good Witch. When I discovered Season 1 on Netflix I was elated and fell in love with the show. I love the pure simplicity of it, particularly in this day and age of teenage reality shows, outrageous cursing and bloody violence. Don't get me wrong: I appreciate a good movie just like anyone else and am not opposed to blood and violence; it's just that sometimes it's nice to just sit back with a glass of wine and immerse myself in a show that, for whatever reason I can't quite pinpoint, makes me feel happy and relaxed. I watched Seasons 2 (on Neflix) and 3 (iTunes) before ordering this movie and I realize I'm going a little backward. Since then I have watched three more and plan on finishing it all! I love the characters, the persnickety Mrs. Tinsdale, the handsome Jake (movies) and Dr. Sam (television series). I truly enjoy watching these....perfect for the entire family.",1513209600,,1029,4.5978260869565215

3392061,5,B0016KHA10,"*Some spoilers if you're new to the Good Witch series.*

If you're new to the Good Witch series, watching the first movie is a no-brainer. Don't do what I did and start watching the TV series and wonder where the ""magic"" is. I was expecting something along the lines of Bewitched, but the ""witch"" here is more a mystery. Is she a real ""witch"" with actual powers, or just a New-Agey woman who has a high sense of intuition? You won't see magic wands, spells, or nose-twitching, but you will see a woman who always seems to know what people need and gently ""manipulates"" them through ""witchy"" mind tricks to follow the right direction.

As a Good Witch veteran, I love rewatching the original. Middleton was a little more rough around the edges then. While the TV series makes the town look like a planned community where everyone makes $100,000 or more a year, the original wasn't afraid to show a homeless guy, a young boy living in a run-down trailer in the woods and being abused by his father, and a guy with an aggressive doberman. Even the mayor's wife, Martha, insinuates that Grey House may be housing a drug lab. Speaking of whom, I also kind of miss the days when Martha was a real adversary and not just the annoying town busybody.",1507507200,6,1241,4.511111111111111

BUT dear Amazon, I don't want to buy videos and have them shipped to my house. I want to stream them. And you have a bunch of other Good Witch movies that you have to buy. Can you change this Amazon so more and more videos are available for buy AND stream. Some like to stream, some like to buy, so you're not losing anything but the streaming business of the 100 or more who would have streamed this highly popular series. I see season 2 is for stream, thank you, going to do that ... thanks. just not going to buy the others listed here but I would definitely stream them, just so you know.",1481414400,3,686,4.088888888888889

Nothing witch like going on, other than herbal remedies and a highly perceptive woman's intuition. I really liked how Cassie  is creative about solving problems with relationships with family members and others. People solve their own problems by taking her suggestions, but do it through their own strength, not by magic. No special magical brews or spells, even though it's highly suggested with looks and back ground music. There is also a value system that is put into place on how to talk, respect others, consequences of lying and dressing appropriately. Highly recommend.",1465948800,,745,5.10655737704918

Very cute and wholesome movies with no particularly religious slant and no agenda-- good for pagan families or Christians or atheists. Everything always turns out well in the end, there's no swearing or really dark themes, but there are some nice storylines that encourage acceptance of people who are different and the love of your family.

3392379,4,B0016KHA10,"This is an enjoyable movie for those that get sucked into Hallmark channel movies. Even as a guy, I find that I sometimes do. Catherine Bell has a lot to do with my enjoyment of this little gem. It's a simple story, but it's told very well and shot rather well. The pacing is good and Catherine Bell is beautiful and charming. It feels like mostly fluff, as these movies tend to be, but there were a couple of unexpected moments of depth and solid acting. Things not usually called for in these types of movies. A couple of technical notes, however: it is in 4:3 ration, as this was a time before many widescreen TV's. Also, the DVD transfer I have seems to suffer from random, momentary skips, like a couple of frames were cut out. Most people may not notice, but I did. Also, story wise, it set up for a great finale that didn't really happen. Perhaps that gets fleshed out in the next film, which I have yet to see, but it felt like a very abrupt ending, and the main story line seemed to be left unresolved. Otherwise, it's a lot of fun and I look forward to catching up with the rest of the series!",1452556800,2,1103,4.232227488151659

Thank you, Hallmark Channel for producing this.  I intend to see the whole franchise of movies, as well as the current TV series.

We can be critical and judgmental of people and situations or we can work with what is offered. The lead actress has a smile that is so loving,i always want more. While watching,i am always reminded that we have a mind set,and I  may have a different mind set. I guess this why they call it the Good  Which. It can also compare favorably with the best motivational seminars,in my humble opinion. After watching this collection,i will buy all new sets when they are released.

The 'kids' act like real kids, not forced to act overly mature, sickening sweet & cute, or unnaturally funny. You really wish YOU were living in Middleton! I got this series for Christmas after the marathon I had taped was wiped when we switched TV providers and I was heartbroken. Anyway, great concept, great acting, great sets; and PLEASE take a good look at Cassie's wardrobe! I got a lot of ideas for myself from her clothes!!!",1429488000,,590,4.5754716981132075

I assume any DVD will have both of those options, and the first at least had CC.  With these, the only option you have is to play the entire movie.  If you stop or pause, it will pick back up where you left.  Love this series, but what DVDs come out with no subtitles or scene selections nowadays?  Selecting the root menu just takes me back to ""Play Movie"".  If someone has any suggestions to correct this, please let me know!",1425686400,,602,4.228070175438597

A young couple's romance, family friendly. Our mystery woman arrives unseen in a small town where everyone knows everyone and mainstreet is still open. We learn she has inhereted the large, abandoned mansion. Catherine Bell is at once mysterious, spunky, a rebel, sweet, moral, kind-hearted, intimidating, cute, wise, vulnerable, tough, and all-around absolutely adorable and lovable. She produces the series, and I don't grow tired of the story. See why this is a much beloved modern tv-movie series for years.",1421020800,,882,5.1678321678321675

3392826,5,B0016KHA10,"This series is just plain wonderful, every single episode. I was hooked from the very first one I saw on Hallmark (""The Good Witch"") and was thrilled to see them extend it into a series. It's a combination of reality and fantasy. Reality: There's no such thing as ""real"" witches. Fantasy: But then again...!?! I intend to have all of them in my collection as soon as they come out on DVD. Catherine Bell is wonderful in her role as Cassandra Nightengale, the ""witch."" She dispenses warmth and wisdom, understanding, and love. One of the things about this series that really impresses me is the segue from one episode to the next - it all makes sense, it all ties together, and the skill of the supporting cast - the ensemble - makes it all the more delightful. You watch the children grow up, a family grow stronger, friendships blossom, a community pull together... In case you haven't figured it out by now, I highly recommend this collection and if you don't already have the first one I recommend that you get it, too.",1418256000,11,1022,4.559782608695652

The movies themselves, are predictable but enjoyable nevertheless, and they can be viewed by the whole family.",1418169600,,385,4.7164179104477615

3392836,3,B0016KHA10,"My daughter asked for this video set for Christmas, and upon first looking at this one on Amazon, found that it did not contain all of the movies that she had mentioned, but I bought it anyway. After some further looking on the internet, I did find the full collection, which contains two movies that Amazon's set does not, these being the first and last movies in the series. Also, the price for the 6 movie set was significantly cheaper than Amazon's 4 movie set. Both are produced by the same studio, and packaged and sold wholesale by the same company, as well. So, naturally, I sent the Amazon set back and purchased the complete set for less money, $30 as opposed to $35. Sometimes you have to watch the prices of what you buy from Amazon, many people think that they are always the lowest price on the internet, but shopping around sometimes finds this to not be true. Watch my other reviews for another example of a popular childs toy.",1417996800,66,943,4.488372093023256

Pleasant distraction for very old people, or people home sick and on medications. (The plot is extraordinarily simple.) Three stars for a kind-hearted film, celebrating open-mindedness, honest community members, helping one another, and happy endings in an era where the opposites of those values are widely prevalent. Especially liked the positive portrayal of the ""witch"", and an amazingly positive portrayal of the male lead, a policeman. It's a child's fantasy of what police should be like. If only.
You can see the producers were hoping to launch a ""Bewitched""- inspired series, and there are sequels...apparently.",1415664000,4,757,5.707964601769912

Second, there are a total of 7 films (including the one that came out last week.)  So this ""collection"" is very incomplete.

3392947,5,B0016KHA10,"The collection of 4 movies in this DVD is an excellent value and very good entertainment. The four movies from the Good Witch Series in this DVD are: The Good Witch's Garden, TheGood Witch's Gift, The Good Witch's family, and The Good Witch's Charm.

In each movie you will follow Cassie, the Good Witch, as she becomes settled in the town of Middleton and makes her home in Grey House. You will see her marry Chief Jake Russell and become part of his family. They will have a child of their own. There are challenges that need to be overcome in each movie, but Cassie always seems to know it will turn out OK. She uses some of her witch intuition and charm often and seems to know people well. I enjoyed each movie and would recommend the DVD.

3392948,5,B0016KHA10,"The Good Witch was an instant hit with my wife and I - we caught this one and the second one before hard times hit and we gave up cable and stuff. I noticed a couple of weeks ago they finally are releasing a set of the second through the fifth Good Witch movies. I pre-ordered that and decided to go ahead and get this one (the first movie.) And yes, I, too, find it odd that they wouldn't put the first movie in with the set but what the hey!

Catherine Bell, starred for nine seasons on Jag. While she did a good job as Sarah I never really think that role fitted all of her in that character. She did fit in nicely with the exceptional ensemble cast and guest actors during her Jag stint. I did not think her time on Army wives was really an exceptional event though she filled her role well, again, with a very good fellow cast.

With the Good Witch movies, however, the long hair (missing on Jag) and a very sincere and charming smile and grace - I believe she has finally found her best role as Cassie - The Good Witch. One that she clearly is the star and commands the screen. She is terrific and most of the cast works well together in a rather simple plotted movie series that is fairly wholesome and good family entertainment.

And I have read that a limited ten episodes season tv show will air as well this fall or next year - that's just fantastic.

You can't go wrong here folks - a good movie that won't win any Emmy's or probably any awards but you'll find it slowly warming your hearts. With a pre made family - the towns sheriff and his two kids - Cassie will continue to win fans and new viewers for years to come!",1412640000,,1633,4.141955835962145

3392972,5,B0016KHA10,"Me, I'll take what I can get. When I look back at the desolation that was a lack of available Good Witch movies on DVD, this collection suits me fine. And now I can take some strain off my DVR. In 2008 Hallmark caught lightning in a bottle when it aired&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-Witch-Hallmark/dp/B002SAMMEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good Witch (Hallmark)</a>, it was so good. Every year since, we've been treated to a Good Witch sequel, each one stoked with whimsy and humor and gentle reminders about the value of charity and tolerance and of second chances. How often can an actor claim two iconic recurring roles in their rsum? Catherine Bell - so unforgettable as Lt. Col. Sarah 'Mac' MacKenzie in JAG - has endeared herself further as Cassandra Nightingale, the enchanting stranger who inherited the infamous Grey House in sleepy Middleton, USA. She quickly makes herself to home, and soon Grey House is producing these odd smells. She cows a ferocious attack dog and fixes a bully. She dispenses casual wisdom to traumatized children. Her mysterious presence generates rampant rumors that she's the Grey Lady, ghost of Grey House. Yeah, funny things seem to happen around Cassie.

Oh, you can tell that Cassie isn't what she once was. As we go deeper into these films, we only ever learn a smidge of her past. What Cassie has is big imagination and an unconventional streak that allows her to live life on her own terms. The series maintains a persistent flirtation with its audience. Is Cassie a witch? Or does she instead simply possess keen powers of perception and observation? Maybe her enigmatic smile is conjured deliberately. Maybe she practices saying those cryptic remarks in front of a mirror. You won't catch her ruffled. You won't catch her being unkind or close minded. Cassie is the eternal optimist. And sometimes she's theatrical. A woman cultivates an air of mystery about her.

From jump we sense that Cassie Nightingale is a very lonely person. The Good Witch and onwards chart Cassie's putting down roots in Middleton, safe and done at last from her travels. We also see how capable she is at overcoming obstacles, most of which are erected by the mayor's snoopy, small-minded wife. By dint of six - soon to be seven - movies, Cassie has come to feel like an old and trusted friend. Out of the ether Catherine Bell has snatched allure and enigma and also gentleness and impeccable insight, and bottled all that up in Cassie. Bell is pitch perfect. And I love the Russell family - the widower who happens to be Middleton's Chief of Police (Chris Potter) and his two children just starving for a loving mom. They ground Cassie. It's so endearing, the absolute faith the Russell kids have in her. I love how kind and generous Cassie is, and how intuitive she is, and how wise, and how she always sees the good in people. Who wouldn't want a problem-solving good witch living in their neighborhood? I've got two in mine. Or I think they're witches. They both of them have odd smells coming from their houses.

This DVD set has four of The Good Witch movies. No, the original Good Witch is absent, as are the sixth and seventh installments, The Good Witch's Destiny (2013) and The Good Witch's Wonder (2014). But I'll take what's here, and happily.

Oh, but I am fiendishly jonesing for the recently announced The Good Witch ongoing series, set to broadcast in February 2015, a date that cannot come fast enough.

I'm not sure - maybe plot SPOILERS now?

- The Good Witch's Garden (2009) - Middleton is prepping for its 200th year anniversary garden gala, this time to be held at Grey House. Except, to supplement her income, ""the most untraditional woman in town"" converts Grey House into a bed & breakfast inn. Wouldn't you know it, that her first tenant is a stranger who means to claim Grey House for his own on strength of a more direct bloodline and an ironclad chain of title naming him as sole heir.

- The Good Witch's Gift (2010) - It's silver bells and wedding bells for a good witch. In an unexpected swerve - because Cassie is THE spontaneous one - her down-to-earth fianc, the Chief of Police, suggests they get hitched on Christmas Eve. That's seven days away, yo! Also, Chief Russell frets about the return of an ex-con whom he had arrested more than ten years ago for a bank robbery. Is he in Middleton to see his estranged family or to exact revenge on the Chief?

- The Good Witch's Family (2011) - Three challenging years in Middleton - during which time she'd been shunned as an outsider and accused of witchcraft - but Cassie is finally accepted enough in the community that she's nominated to run for mayor. But I doubt she'll catch a vote from her vindictive long-lost cousin who's shown up on Cassie's doorstep for an extended visit and proceeds to try to shred her new family apart.

- The Good Witch's Charm (2012) - Middleton is judged as one of the ten most charming towns in North America. So imagine the furor and the townwide harrumphing when a baffling glitch caught on video during an interview with new mayor Cassie raises unwholesome gossip that she's a witch - and this time the rumor's gone viral. It's SO not a good time for a crime wave - a rash of shoplifting incidents - to hit Middleton. Or for Cassie's controlling foster mother to come a-visiting out of the blue.

Now if they would only release the DVDs for the sixth and seventh movies, The Good Witch's Destiny (2013) and The Good Witch's Wonder (2014). Man, that sweet someday.",1408924800,58,5563,4.755440414507772

She has a way about her that you get the feeling that she couldn't do what she does without supernatural powers.  However, as the movie progresses, you understand that she has great intuition about people and probably understands them better than they understand themselves.  She very subtly introduces hints about themselves to them..... and it's as if a light bulb goes off and they finally get it, so to speak.  It's a wonderful movie and I would recommend it to everyone.  It will warm your spirit.",1405555200,,612,4.735849056603773

Old movie fans will catch that Cassie's store is named the Bell Book and Candle, 1958 Kim Novak and Jimmy Stewart movie with witchcraft.
Cassie's 'witchcraft' is more about positive thinking (Lori's dreams), confidence (bullying). I think it would be a good movie for kids.
My one COMPLAINT is the DVD had the abrupt stops for commercials......",1396483200,,451,4.934210526315789

Catherine Bell delivers as a beautiful and knowledgeable women who uses herbal remedies and an understanding of-how human beings and nature-cycle together- to transform a small fearful and backward town into a loving and charitable one.

It is nice to see that those "" chicken soup remedies"" that grandma spoke of are still alive and able to deliver!  Good for the whole family",1392595200,,744,4.796875

3393034,3,B0016KHA10,"An odd movie, I was amazed to learn that its quite popular and has sprouted many sequels.  For a so-called romance though, its really quite tepid and routine, not to mention chaste.
The writing was less than inspired; the scenes were abrupt with awkward time changes (days fluttered by, highlighting an event or two).  In the end it just felt like a few bits and pieces strung together, there was no natural flow to the story.
As for the plot, a strange woman (Catherine Bell as Cassandra Nightingale) shows up in a quiet town ruled by a domineering woman/chairperson Martha Tinsdale (Catherine Disher).  Instantly accused of witchcraft (the dark arts), Cassandra becomes the target of the comically evil Martha who wants Cassandras house and business ruined to suit a nefarious scheme of her own.  Heres where things get a little skewed.  Throughout this film, the law is broken multiple times with no repercussions to anyone.  The town sheriff (Chris Potter) is entirely ineffectual in upholding the law, which is either poor writing or an intentional message that if youve got a good enough excuse for breaking the law, your transgressions will be overlooked in this slap-happy town in the middle of nowhere ruled by a cruel and crazy woman, who under normal circumstances, would be considered the resident witch.

Nothing about this movie warrants a second viewing, nor did it charm me enough to want to seek out the rest of the series.  Eh.",1383955200,2,1445,4.89344262295082

3393060,5,B0016KHA10,"First off, I love the movie. Seen it many times on Hallmark channel, so thought I should buy it. So I'll skip the usual blurb about what the movie is about and such. Suffice it to say, I love how it treats the Craft and witches in general in a good light.

This movie was due for delivery on the tenth, lucky for me, it arrived yesterday, on the 8th. So again, super fast delivery. Thank you folks at Amazon!

Now, if Hallmark would just start disc-ing the lot, as far as the rest of the movies go, I would buy the set. COME ON HALLMARK get with the program! You have niche buyers out here!",1373328000,,590,4.077586206896552
3393061,4,B0016KHA10,"This movie has a good mixture of sweetness, humor, and a bit of social commentary. When someone a little bit different moves to a small town, it takes awhile for the locals to appreciate her, but her good heart wins out. Definitely a feel good movie... especially for those who identify themselves as good witches!",1372118400,,314,4.7272727272727275
3393062,5,B0016KHA10,"Catherine bell is very good in this series. Loved the story. Don't expect a deep subject here, this is clean family entertainment.",1371600000,,130,4.954545454545454

3393064,5,B0016KHA10,this is a beautiful series.  a little bit of mystery to it .  delightful for family to watch.  we have watched it many times and never get tired of watching it.  would highly recommend this whole series for family viewing.  it is hard to find good clean entertainment these days.,1370476800,,279,4.5
3393065,5,B0016KHA10,"I ordered it on a Friday and it was here on a Monday. It was how the seller said it was to be. I have been looking for this movie since the first time i watched it. Thank You very much, i Love it.",1370304000,,196,3.477272727272727
3393066,5,B0016KHA10,"I first saw ""The Good Witch"" through Hulu and found it a wonderful and creative movie. Once I had seen this movie I was convinced I had to own it for my DVD collection. Since I found ""The Good Witch"" through Amazon I am not sorry for my purchase.",1370217600,,246,4.040816326530612
3393067,5,B0016KHA10,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Good Witch was really quite clean. There was low cut shirts and dresses; a couple has wine over dinner; and a tasteful scene where a woman buys some aromatherapy oils to improve the intimacy between herself and her husband. It is not rated and the Dove Foundation gave it a four star and approved it for 12+.

I love this movie and have watched it multiple times.  It is the only ""Good Witch"" movie out on DVD.  I originally saw this movie on Hallmark Channel and bought the DVD immediately.  Most people might skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".

I love all the characters: Cassie (the good witch), Jake (the widowed Sheriff), Brandon and Lori (the sheriff's two children), George (their mother's father who lives with them), Derek (sheriff's deputy), Kyle (school bully then Brandon's friend), Nancy (town's travel agent/member of the citizen's league/friend and customer of Cassie), Martha (mayor's wife and person responsible for wanting ""The Witch"" out of town).

She wins the approval of the Sheriff almost immediately and Cassie helps Lori with her bad dreams and Brandon with the school bully.  She even helps Grandfather George.  But before she can truly become part of Middleton, she will need to win over some of the more skeptical neighbors who don't approve of her unique ways.  Especially the mayor's wife, Martha.  She tries to get Cassie's shop closed and hopefully push her out of town.

The rest of this six part series are all worth watching and buying.  They are clean, uplifting and teach great lessons about trust, love and family.

""THE GOOD WITCH'S GARDEN"": Cassie has settled into Middleton and is busy making a home of Grey House. Her boyfriend, Sheriff Jake Russell, and his kids are happy to have Cassie in the neighborhood, but she has yet to gain the trust of some people in town.  Before long, a stranger rolls into town with papers entitling him to legal ownership of Grey House. Before she knows it, Cassie is left without a home and is convinced Middleton isn't where she belongs. Ultimately, everyone will learn holding on too tightly to something can make it more likely that thing will slip through your fingers.

""THE GOOD WITCH'S GIFT"":  Cassandra Nightingale always has a few tricks up her sleeve, but is surprised when her handsome sweetheart, Police Chief Jake Russell, proposes. Getting into the spirit of the season, they set their wedding date for Christmas Eve--only six days away!  As the two hurry to plan the wedding, trouble clouds their happiness when a mysterious man from Jake's past returns to town.

""THE GOOD WITCH'S FAMILY"":  Life is going well for Cassie as she settles into marriage with Middleton Police Chief Jake Russell and as stepmom to Brandon and Lori. But evil soon blows into town in the form of Cassie's long-lost cousin Abigail, who whips up wickedness like a tornado. The once peaceful Russell family bickers night and day; Jake is fired after an argument with the Mayor over a bridge expansion; and Martha, the Mayor's wife and town busy body, walks out on her long marriage. As the town divides further over neighborhood expansion, Cassie is drafted to run for Mayor. With in her once-happy marriage, her family is unraveling, and Abigail's diabolical ""double, double, toil and trouble"" is the apex of Cassie's misery. What's a good witch to do?

""THE GOOD WITCH'S CHARM"":  Good Witch Cassie Nightingale is back to her bewitching ways, but this time shes also juggling a newborn daughter and her job as town Mayor. With such a busy schedule she and her husband, town sheriff Jake Russell, aren't getting much sleep. Hoping for a break, Cassie plans a much needed vacation with her new family. But things go awry when a crime wave sweeps through town and an investigative reporter tries to ruin Cassies image after a video of her magically disappearing turns up on the internet. Supported by her loyal family and friends, Cassie must rely on her signature charm to put a stop to the troubles before they completely destroy the town, and a Good Witchs reputation!

""THE GOOD WITCH'S DESTINY"": (which is still in production): ""There's something definitely magical about Cassie Nightingale. But when even her loved ones start to wonder how Cassie seems to know everything and be everywhere, the good witch senses that she's in for a rough ride... It begins with stepdaughter Lori's writing project, the story of the Grey Lady who once lived in their house many years ago  and who shared more than the same birthday and an amazing physical likeness with Cassie. Then Drew arrives in Middleton, a boastful young man prone to investing fortunes into hopeless scams and blaming others when his projects fail. The person responsible  in his eyes  for his current fiasco and his fiance's break-up with him is Cassie. And the vibes he is sending out in her direction are definitely laced with danger. Lori then discovers the Grey Lady's journal which suddenly breaks off on her birthday, which is also Cassie's. As her family fears for her safety, Cassie resolves to clear up the hocus-pocus concerning Drew and the Grey Lady with a tried-and-true method: humor, openness and the acceptance of one's destiny.""

Overall, I love this movie and the 4 (soon to be 5) others in this series and will definitely watch it/them over and over again.  I can't wait for all of them to be out on DVD.  I will definitely be purchasing the whole series.",1369785600,2,5616,4.8097713097713095

There is a storyline, but the interaction of the good and bad and the little magical touches are even more important than the plot. This is a delightful family film, more about family and honesty than witchcraft, which is really a small but fun part of the story. This is the first in a series, can't wait for the rest of the series to come out on DVD.

I wonder if ""The Good Witch"" was made in 16x9.  Besides being portrayed by a beautiful & charming actress, Catharine Bell, the character of Cassie Nightingale has a subtle magic (subtler than ""Bewitched"" or ""Harry Potter) based on strong intuition, sensitivity to others's needs & a psychological gift for ministering to the needs of the other.

3393117,4,B0016KHA10,"This is a pleasant, easy-going fantasy movie that will probably not rustle the feathers of most viewers. When an old abandoned house with a scary reputation suddenly becomes occupied by a beautiful and mysterious young woman the town's curiosity is aroused and tongues start wagging. Who is this strange young woman, where did she come from and why is she there? The mayor's wife develops an instant dislike for her and quickly begins to plan on steps to get her out of town.

When the young woman opens a shop in town the people are both alarmed and curious by the unusual nature of the shop; is this woman more than she appears, does her presence in town present a potential danger to the town? Here is a situation which requires attention and action and that is what this movie is about.

Catherine Bell plays the part of Cassie Nightingale, the mysterious young woman with grace and charm and quickly becomes a compelling character with whom the viewer can sympathize. Chris Potter plays the part of Jake Russell, a level headed-police chief who has to keep a lid on the town's overreaction to the mysterious young woman.

However there is some HORRIFIC acting in it which kinda puts a damper on the whole thing. The kids acting is mediocre at times (which is understandable and can be overlooked), but the acting of the character or Martha (the mayor's wife) is beyond awful. She is ridiculously bad (almost laughable in her portrayal of a small minded housewife on a power trip) and I have no idea how this actress landed any kind of role in a televised production. The scenes without here are decent and the basic story is good. But the bad acting of Martha ruines the rest of the movie.

Yes, the story has been told many times and in many ways, but this is a refreshing and charming film based on a good witch and a widower sheriff who fall in love.

Cassie was much more like most witches I have met.  This movie helps witches to come out of the closet and reminds us that there is nothing necessarily scary or demonic about witchcraft.

The story was a bit trite, but it advertised itself as a ""feel good"" movie and that is what it is.  My only wonder is why didn't Cassie wear a pentacle or something, like most witches? Indeed, there was not even a pentacle on display in her shop.  It seems the makers of the film wanted to tone down her witchiness by avoiding most symbols of witchcraft (with the exception of the broom); I think they went overboard in an effort to present her as a benign, all-American woman.  This I think was a mistake.

But all in all, a good movie.",1318636800,2,960,4.6117647058823525

3393154,5,B0016KHA10,"""The Good Witch"" is a great upbeat film starring Catherine Bell as emotionally resilient and benevolent witch Cassandra Nightingale.  The character of Cassandra Nightingale moves to the town of Middleton because she inherited a mansion, and is hoping that the long-time residents welcome her.  She soon bonds with a widowed policeman father Jake Russell (played by Chris Potter) and his two children.  She opens up her own business of magical items and soon encounters resistance from those who have a challenging time accepting her and figuring her out due to her unique personality.  The character of Cassandra Nightingale has a big heart, but it matters little to the Mayors wife Martha (played by Catherine Disher).  Martha instantly treats Cassandra coldly upon first meeting her.  Martha eventually petitions to try to drive Cassandra to leave town again.  Cassandra at first considers and wonders whether she made the right decision in moving to Middleton.  This is only because she longs to find a place where she can feel like she belongs and is accepted. Cassandra Nightingale yearns for the sense of acceptance and belonging. Jake Russell sees the good and potential in her and urges Cassandra to reconsider her decision in moving.  He persuasively reasons with her by mentioning how she has ran away from so much in her life that she needs to stop running away.  Hearing this statement resonated with me, and I am glad that I followed the prompting of my spirit to watch this movie.  I only say this because I appreciate where I live, and I now intend to permanently settle in the D.C. area.  However, less than three months ago (May 2011), I admit that I at first wondered if I made the right decision in choosing to stay in the D.C. area. In addition, I also know what its like to desire the feeling of a sense of belonging and acceptance. Luckily, I received a series of personal confirmations that choosing to stay in the D.C. area is the most joyful decision.  For me to watch a movie that featured a character going through a similar situation with this was very healing for me.  I intend to watch the other movie sequels to ""Good Witch"".  ""Good Witch"" is best for anyone that enjoys a feel good and uplifting film to watch.",1315699200,4,2242,4.772020725388601

This film is the first of ""Good Witch"" movies. The Second is ""The Good Witch Garden"", and the third is ""The Good Witch Gift"". This is the 3 films I know with the actress Catherine Bell playing as Cassie.
(""The Good Witch's Gift"" is a movie with a lot of ""Christmas Spirit"")

I can't wait for the time of the official release of the next two movies. When Released, I will buy also the other two [Although I have the 3rd because the Television Showed it Last Christmas (2010) and I Recorded it with my DVD Recorder on a DVD-R]

3393166,5,B0016KHA10,"Catherine Bell's Cassie Nightingale is the coolest good witch on the planet.  She's a cross between Samantha Stevens and a cool earth mother type of new age shrink in great clothes.  She has this cool familiar, a black cat named Isis, lots of magical remedies and potions in her home and shop, bakes killer cookies, and has a messy run-down home of which she is obviously the heir.

This movie won me over the first time I saw it on Hallmark, and I love how she doesn't solve the problems, but tricks people into solving their own.  Magic?  Depends on how you look at it!  I think it all boils down to possessing a bewitching charm.  She strikes up a friendship with Lori and Brandon, kids of the local cop Jake Russell, then later a low-burn steamy romance with him.  She seems to charm everyone except for the local uptight priss, Martha Tinsdale, who will do anything to make trouble for Cassie because, like too many people, she fears what she doesn't understand.

Best of all, we also have The Good Witch's Garden, in which some guy pretends to be an heir of Gray House and is encouraged to make trouble by Marth Tinsdale--of course.  We also now have The Good Witch's Gift, in which Brandon takes a shine to a girl whose dad is a convict and has a tough row to hoe.  Miracle of Miracles?  Martha does an about face and finally accepts Cassie in the community!

Pleasant surprises await you with each addition of this wonderful Hallmark family trilogy, and you are never either too young or too old to enjoy fantasy with a touch of subtle reality in the guise of gently taught morals on treating others as you would like them to treat you.  This is what I'd like to know:  when can we get all three movies in one package?  You don't want to miss a single one!",1301702400,3,1764,4.398148148148148

There is just something about her; she seems to cast a ""spell"" over almost everyone in town (except for the mayor's wife), and I couldn't help falling in love with her along with them!  Catherine Bell is wonderful in this role, and I also loved Chris Potter as the sheriff.  I would love to own the next two movies on DVD, ""The Good Witch's Garden"" and ""The Good Witch's Gift"".

Now all Cassie wants is a loving family, so she says. She starts out making friends with the local police chief (Chris Potter) and the chiefs family. He uses her wiles and obvious psychology to right many wrongs committed by locals.

Even though this was written to make you wander if Cassie really is witchy or not. The production is too superficial and pushes ""in your face"" clues as locks that won't unlock and dialog as ""I will not dream of bunnies.""

As the story progresses, you learn that her most special talent is that she is a gentle, loving person, and through her good will, gains the acceptance of the neighbors and finally has a place to call home.

As with most Hallmark films, this story is very wholesome and great for the whole family. The story emphasizes tolerance and accepting of people who may be different than ourselves.",1293667200,,721,4.76

It shows a woman of intuition and insight using her wits.  Though there is a nod to witchcraft, it's not really overt or overstated.

That said, this movie is fun, lighthearted, and yes, even typical....boy meets girl....trouble ensues....etc.

However, since purchasing it, we've watched it over and over.  It's just that entertaining.  One day I even had it on while I was washing windows just because.  With all the stupid stuff out there, this is a breath of fresh air for sure.",1291852800,,653,4.707964601769912

It's so nice to see a movie that everyone in the family can enjoy, and also one that doesn't portray witches in such a negative light.  Hollywood has done much damage in that regard over the years and this was just so refreshing.

I wanted to purchase the other movie I heard of, The Good Witches Garden, but I don't see that is available.  I'm hoping that Hallmark runs these two movies in October again, so I can see the second one also.

It's a great movie that teaches tolerance and good wholesome family values without being preachy.",1283817600,,713,4.446153846153846

3393192,5,B0016KHA10,"What I enjoy the most about ""The Good Witch"" is that it's not the typical Hallmark cookie cutter TV movie that they're famous for. This movie is special because it has a lot of great standout performances, centering on a great plot. OK some of the acting is ""Murder, She Wrote"" worthy, but overall it's a heartwarming picture that your entire family will appreciate.

Catherine Bell plays Cassie, in the title role and she is just amazing. This is the first time I have ever seen her in anything and she comes off as believable and relatable. Watching Ms. Bell was like watching an old friend that I had known for years. It's a rare actress that can capture that type of sentiment and emotion for her viewers within the first few minutes like Ms. Bell has done.

The character of Cassie is my very favorite. She's a little mysterious and a little esoteric and always knows how to solve other people's problems. Chris Potter was also really great as the local sheriff and the two made a lovely couple in the movie because she was the ying for his yang.

One of the main messages that I got from ""The Good Witch"" is the importance of compassion. Even though some of the people in her town were less than hospitable (such as the mayor's gossipy wife), Cassie was able to keep a cheerful disposition. And in the end there's a shocking outcome, I don't want to give it away but I will say that Cassie was able to forgive which I'm sure is a lot more than most people could do if presented with the same situation of circumstances.

If you're looking for an extraordinary movie about just an ordinary lady, watch ""The Good Witch."" Remember, only bad witches are ugly.",1283385600,2,1661,4.490066225165563
3393193,5,B0016KHA10,Love this great family movie from Hallmark. Is a very good Halloween holiday movie. Can't wait until I can buy The Good Witch's Garden.,1282521600,,135,4.666666666666667
3393194,5,B0016KHA10,"Every small town has its legends, and often one of them will involve a haunted house. In this case the local haunted house even has a ghost with a long standing identity, ""The Grey Lady"".

When Casandra Nightingale moves in, there is initially some confusion as to whether she is the heir she claims to be, or possibly the ghost herself! As it turns out, Casandra is not a ghost, just a witch. LOL But a good one. She opens an apothecary downtown, and dispenses sage advice and confidence building charms where and when they will do the most good. In the process she helps out the children of the town's police chief.

However, all is not friendly and quiet in this little town. The mayor's wife is an enemy for several reasons, and someone is trying to make her feel decidedly unwelcome ...

""The Good Witch"" will remind you of any number of the charming books you may have read as a youngster, and does a great job of developing a feeling of being in and belonging in a fictional small town setting. Catherine Bell is excellent as the good witch who doesn't get too flustered no matter what she is up against, doing her best to win over her detractors through open friendliness rather than matching their antagonism. That in itself is a good lesson learned.",1282003200,,1259,4.5131578947368425

3393196,5,B0016KHA10,"This is a movie favorite in our home. We only wish that those who produce movies and tv would get the hint-the majority of viewers are fed up with the constant diet of movies and television shows with the same, tired old subject-drugs, profanity, and all of the other sad subjects of life that go along with it. This is a real ""feel good"" movie that allows the viewer to walk away at the end with a smile. Even though some would call it corny, we will take a thousand of the same kind of shows, because after all, wasn't the original concept of movies supposed to take us away from our day-to-day problems and give us a reprieve, (even though a short-lived one in some cases). Forget reality tv and movies-give me something I can truly enjoy! Thank you Catherine Bell for your wonderful movies, and I hope, many more to come.
Now, where are the sequels of the Good Witch-The Good Witch's Garden, and The Good Witch's Gift??? With such a popular series, I cannot imagine why they all haven't been released as of yet!

Everything in this movie from the lack of anything dirty (like in dirt) to it's syrupy whiteness does nothing but teach an avoidance of all the issues that are devastatingly real to the rest of the world.

3393203,4,B0016KHA10,"To be different is to tempt being shunned or made terrible fun of, and THE GOOD WITCH resurrects that old chestnut. A mysterious stranger moves into the town of Middleton, and this being that sort of town, the rumors are soon flying thick as flies. It doesn't help that Cassandra Nightingale takes up residence at the ""Grey House,"" the dilapidated local haunted mansion. With everyone speculating whether Cassie is the frightening Grey Lady come back to life, the mayor's prudish, imperious wife Mrs. Tinsdale soon embarks on her persecution crusade, accusing Cassie of practicing the dark arts and petitioning to throw her out of town. Jake Russell, the town sheriff and a widower of three years, finds himself caught in the middle. Because Cassie, with her enigmatic ways, is giving credence to all the gossip. The sheriff is faced with having to enforce the mayor's wife's vindictiveness even as he becomes attracted to the newcomer.

Magic... or just good old psychology at work? Believing that she has certain, er, arcane powers, several in the community approach Cassie with their problems. But if you listen close you'll hear buried in Cassie's whimsical mumbo jumbo some sound advice, a spoonful of common sense, a certain knowledge of human behavior. THE GOOD WITCH, another good 'un from the Hallmark Channel, sets up the mystery of whether Cassie is truly a witch and there's enough tension and Cassie does just enough weird stuff that you're kept guessing. Because Cassie can soothe the savage beast, can tame dream monsters, and then she even opens up an herbal shop she calls Bell, Book & Candle (she charges $5 for each of her merchandise). Oh, Mrs. Tinsdale, Middleton's champion busybody, she's really up in arms now. Meanwhile, Cassie is sneakily improving the lot in life of certain of the townspeople.

Part of me wishes the sexy Colonel MacKenzie were still trading courtroom barbs with Commander Rabb, but the role of Cassandra Nightingale is a terrific change of pace for Catherine Bell, and she's still as gorgeous as ever, as, er, bewitching as ever, and here she shows off her playful side. THE GOOD WITCH is a family teleplay, and it does teach lessons of tolerance and open-mindedness and perseverance. Pay attention and you just may suss out that even a violent bully may be going thru his own hell, that a homeless drunk can still contribute if given a chance, that an alluring unorthodox stranger residing in a scary mansion with a black cat doesn't necessarily equate to ""Witch!"" Or maybe it does. THE GOOD WITCH leaves you to make up your own mind. And I like that.

Given it's low cost I guess this is somewhat understandable but definitely a disappointment.  That knocks off a star.

While this didn't affect my rating, I am surprised that the original aspect ratio of this film is 4:3.  You would think a film made in 2007 would have been 16:9.

Update Dec. 2012: A recent viewing of this movie on the Hallmark Movie Channel shows that they do have an HD widescreen version of the film but did not use the widescreen version for this DVD. Before I did not count off for the DVD version being 4:3 since I assumed the OAR had been 4:3 but now that I know a 16:9 version had been available this whole time I have to reduce my rating to two stars.

Hallmark needs to listen to its audience if it wants us to keep coming back. If its acceptable to play on TV, then it should be acceptable for release.

3393247,5,B0016KHA10,"I literally JUST finished seeing this sweet, magical film on the Hallmark Channel this morning.  I love that it celebrates diversity and belief in the healing power of magic (i.e., love), and the power and possibility in each moment.

This film spoke to me on many levels. I found the line ""They killed the magic"" especially poignant (when Bell spoke of the foster family who raised her) because her situation mirrored my own upbringing with parents way too fearful and strict.  The sweet handsome town sheriff figures out she's been ""on the run"" from love ever since, which I am trying to stop doing as we speak.

""The Good Witch"" also shows what happens when people stand up for the truth, even when it is difficult to do so.  It is a delight especially for those fond of Halloween, which absolutely includes me!  I was not that familiar with the work of Catherine Bell, but I have become a fan today.

This film is a great pilot for a potential series.  I rarely watch the Hallmark Channel but would faithfully watch this.  I would also buy this film in a hearbeat, but Amazon doesn't have it, Ebay doesn't have it, nobody has it.

3393253,5,B0016KHA10,"I absolutely loved The Good Witch, the romantic comedy-drama Hallmark made-for-TV movie, which I felt portrayed witchcraft in both a positive and a more realistic light. More importantly, the movie taught the virtue of tolerance toward people who may look, think, and believe differently than we do. This summer I was thrilled when Hallmark announced that the movie would be released on DVD, and then dismayed to learn that it had been suddenly pulled from production without explanation. After reading other fans' reviews, I was determined to get to the bottom of what had really happened, so I contacted Hallmark directly online. They responded, and I quote, ""It's being held temporarily, because ""The Good Witch"" is being made into a series."" What good news! Apparently, The Good Witch is a Hit! So all we fans have to do is be a little more patient, and keep watching the Hallmark Channel for more of The Good Witch!",1222905600,16,920,4.903846153846154

If it was just a money thing, we all need to bombard Hallmark with emails about a very BAD decision. I saved this on my DVR and can make a copy on a DVD, but it's not the same thing as a professional movie.

3393257,5,B0016KHA10,"After viewing many movies that paint the image of Witches in a very scary and bad light it is refreshing to find a movie that portrays the Wiccan folk in their true and harmoniously positive personality. Catherine Bell portrays to perfection the real charactor of a young witch who moves to a community after inheriting a legendary haunted  house left to her by a relative the ""Grey Lady"".She befriends the chief of police, who falls for her--bewitchment perhaps?-- and his family and using psychology and insight gives realy good advice that helps his daughter overcome nightmares,his son  befriend  the bully of his school and the grandfather regains a new interest in life. She helps a derelect through kindness and opportunity to regain self confidence and he becomes a repectable member of society all because she shows him kindness and his true self worth. She gives him a break and he gets back on his feet again.
Her nemisis,the mayor's wife who is haughty and bigotted tries to have her driven out of town and when her two sons vandalizes the Wiccan shop she just feels that  Cassie the witch had it coming and her boys were above punishment. Well the real turn around towards respect is a lesson to be learned by the boys when they are forgiven because Cassie didn't want their lives ruined with a criminal record against them. And as punishment the boys were made to clean up the mess they made of the shop.
This is a truely magical movie with a great lesson to learn and that is live and let live. Respect everyone and don't judge. Everyone has good in them and there is great potential in all of us.
I've watched the movie on the Hallmark Channel several times and I hope they plan to reprint and distribute. Of all the witchcraft movies I have ever watched this one gives a fair and human perspective to the time honored tradition of the magickal Healer.

3393262,5,B0016KHA10,"Although the actors were not at all familiar to me, and the ""feel"" of the movie is typical made for TV movie/Hallmark fair, please don't let this stop you from seeing this great ""feel good"" movie.

It seems as if I have seen this movie a million times as it feels formulaic and clichd but it somehow has a refreshing charm and character as told by a ""witch"" stranger who comes to a small town and moves into a mansion who no one notices at first.  The closest movie I could compare this to in terms of theme would be Elvira, Mistress of the Dark (1988).

Ok, now for the witchy part of this review:  The only God/dess mentioned is Isis, the name Cassandra's familiar, a black cat.  Her jewelry is non-descript, and I saw no alters or ritual tools in the background sets of her house (believe me I was looking for them), except for the most recognizable ""witch"" tool to muggles, a round broom that would appear at ""magical"" times throughout the movie with its own ""magical"" music.  There are Native American tools (dream catcher) and New Age tools (Crystal), but this only shows her eclectic nature.  The character is very good with herb and salve lore.  There are no rituals depicted unless you can call reciting a mantra such as ""I will not dream of bunnies"" a ritual.

To cannibalize Starhawks quote, the main character in the story Cassandra ""Changes everyone she touches"" both directly and indirectly for the better.  The theme of ""the truth/answer/solution/magic is within yourself, you only need to find it"" is pervasive throughout the movie and Cassandra is the catalyst that helps the other characters work through their problems.  Cassandra answers can best be described as spoken by an ""old soul,"" as she is very wise beyond her years.

Besides the general ""feel good"" nature of this movie, I highly recommend this movie as a ""coming out"" of the broom closet movie to show disapproving family and friends, as I cannot find one negative/incorrect treatment of Cassandra in this movie.  In short it paints ""wise women"" in a very positive and accurate light.  Some questions to ask after finishing watching this movie would be:  ""So what do you think of witches now?""  Followed by ""What would you say if I was/want to be one?""

I can only hope to see more positive/accurate media portraying witches in such a good light.",1217635200,32,2327,4.678132678132678

8262935,5,B0016KHA10,"This movie series completely caught me off-guard. I saw that Hallmark was airing a marathon and figured I'd give it a try, but was also mentally planning on getting a bunch of housework done because I figured it would bore me. So much for that -- I was hooked by the first commercial break! I don't know if it's because this is from 2008, so Hallmark had a different production style back then, or it's just something unique to these movies because they're about a ""witch"" (more on what that means here later), but this was so different and good compared to a lot of their movies.

How? This series combines several appealing themes: A fish out of water finding a sense of community in a small town (OK, that's not so unique for Hallmark); a ""Sound of Music""-esque romance with a widowed father (neither is that); and a good dose of mystery and intrigue with the whole witch thing. Is Cassie really a witch, or just a very mysterious, intuitive woman with a black cat who happens to like essential oils and live in an old manor? I can see why Hallmark was vague about her witchiness (so as not to offend some people), but it also adds a new layer of intrigue to the show. And the lessons each movie teaches about forgiveness and not rushing to judgment are really lovely. Seriously. I mean, maybe it's a little naive to (SPOILER, sort of) make the villain almost always turn out to  be someone who's really good deep down and changes their ways once Cassie has a talk with them. But it's nice to see, and, as weird as this may sound, has made me even think about my own life and how I would treat someone in similar situations. Who'da thought Hallmark's series about a witch would be its most heartwarming?

I also really like the cast. Catherine Bell is lovely as Cassie, capturing this unique blend of mysterious-yet-warmhearted; the police chief/love interest has great chemistry with her; and his daughter is such a cutie. As with many of these shows that take place in a small town, the annoying busybody who's ultimately harmless (the mayor's wife, Martha) adds a layer of tension that's somewhat funny without being too dark or depressing. However, I'll also say that it's nice how this show doesn't gloss over some of the unpleasantries of life, like how there's a homeless alcoholic, characters who are genuinely hostile towards Cassie at first, others who are being abused by loved ones, etc.",1525046400,,2402,4.620608899297424
