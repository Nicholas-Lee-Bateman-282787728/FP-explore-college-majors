8241334,3,B0011BA9BW,"The cover art on this release by TUTM Entertainment hails this as being ""directed by John Woo"", while most other sources including the film print itself, indicate that it was directed by Wu Yin-sheng. The film itself is an entertaining enough martial arts movie from the mid-70's involving Chinese laborers and their conflict with their Japanese bosses. The print comes from a full-screen public domain master so those expecting dynamic DVD-quality picture and sound may want to look elsewhere. This is basically a bare bones budget release. If your only interest in the film is the advertised Woo involvement, you'll probably want to skip altogether as there is no evidence to suggest he worked on this film, let alone directed it.",1389484800,,732,5.0578512396694215
