8254318,5,B00144N8LO,"I have used this compelling film in my 8th grade Health Science class as part of our unit on nutrition and organic gardening.  I like to use the film because it documents the development of farming with chemicals in a very human way.  The film has the quality of a home movie and the individual lives it focuses on help make the story very real to my students.  This film does not preach, but does show us how farmers innocently used chemical pesticides and fertilizers thinking they were farming with the newest scientific advances.  This documentary is informative and moving, and important for all of us to experience.",1203552000,3,621,4.722222222222222
8254319,5,B00144N8LO,"""My Father's Garden,"" is one of the most important and poignant documentaries I've seen on the plight of the American farm and how petro-based chemical agriculture has altered this country's rural heritage. Fred Kirschenmann is my organic farming hero. If I could choose all over again, I'd pursue a career in organic farming because of him.

If you care at all about what you eat, if you care at all about the health of our rural communities, if you care at all about the well being of the people who grow the foods you consume, buy this DVD. Watch it. It will forever change the way you think about what ends up on your plate. A must-see.",1203552000,2,640,4.47008547008547
8254320,5,B00144N8LO,"Ok, so at this point, everyone has caught on to the ""organic"" idea.  But why is it so important?  This is no fad, people (or at least it shouldn't be).  Non-organic agriculture undermines our soil, our health, and our planet.  This film is moving and has been one of the most influential pieces in my life.  I show it to anyone who will watch.  ""The Future of Food"" seems to be the natural sequel.",1203552000,,397,4.297297297297297
8254321,5,B00144N8LO,I really enjoyed this production. Being a Farmer myself it interested me greatly. Once I saw it I thought it was wonderful. I hope that all Farmers and Agricultural Educators view this picture and share it with everyone. It should make everyone think a little bit. There really is a purpose behind Sustainable Agriculture. The ending tells it all.,1203465600,3,347,4.898305084745763
8254322,4,B00144N8LO,"My Father's Garden is a classic in my film library.
The story is beautiful and compelling, and you just can't beat getting to spend some time with Fred Kirschenmann.",1203465600,2,165,4.724137931034483
8254323,5,B00144N8LO,"Not only the BEST DOCUMENTARY on any subject I have ever seen, but the most relevant. Period.",1203465600,2,93,4.529411764705882
8254324,5,B00144N8LO,"This is a wonderful story with a dramatic twist.  It's hard to distinguish between a documentary and a novel, but it tell's an important story of the current state of our agriculture.  It brings up important possibilities for the future of our food and should be seen widely.",1203465600,3,275,4.708333333333333
8254325,5,B00144N8LO,This movie shows that organic agriculture is sustainable on a large scale in  spite of propaganda to the contrary.  It also makes the point that it can be the difference between profitability and the auction block for farmers in the 10 to 500 acre range.,1203465600,,254,4.622222222222222
8254326,5,B00144N8LO,"This movie was fantastic.  The information is important and the story is touching.  The realities of the small farmer are the heart and soul of the problems of this country.  Just like great teachers, the farmer who knows the land and is able to farm without pesticides is a special breed.  They give their lives to learning nature's secrets every season.  Each year is a new story with new challenges.  They are very creative artistic people who cultivate the soil, work with the land, and know how to accept nature on her terms.  We need to reclaim the land with these natural farming methods.  Genetically Modified Corn, Soy, Canola, and Potato must be outlawed.  The idea that we can control nature with chemicals, pesticides and bioengineered organisms is getting in the way of the natural process.  I look forward to more farms like Fred who convert the dead soil from pesticide farms to the rich organic soil of a natural ecosystem.",1203465600,2,939,4.77639751552795
8254327,5,B00144N8LO,"I love this film. I initially saw it at a Film Festival here on Kaua`i many years ago and loved it. So warm, sincere and real. It really appealed to the part time gardener and naturalist in me and to the natural health practitioner in me. Well, I purchesed it several months ago and watched it for the first time in years and it still holds up well and now has an appeal to the film maker in me as I now watch it through those eyes. It is a real and a warm film. RZ, Wailua, Kaua`i",1203465600,2,481,3.9183673469387754
