8430535,3,B004IARKXS,"This is vintage 1950's B-grade sci-fi fare.  It's US release title as The Crawling Eye is more descriptive of its content.  I was interested in it both as classic sci-fi and as a film that featured Janet Munro, the Disney film actress of Darby O'Gill, Third Man on the Mountain and Swiss Family Robinson.  It was amusing to see Forrest Tucker in a science fiction setting instead of the Old West.  The film itself has quaint special effects for the monster sequences that I found stimulating as a tweenager.  They're pretty hoaky by today's standards.  Drama level with the cable car sequence and subsequent fight was great.  I enjoyed it from a campy sci-fi film perspective.",1301875200,,676,4.775862068965517
