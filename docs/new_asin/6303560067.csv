680005,5,6303560067,"I loved this movie.  That's a hard statement for a black man to make about any movie in which Snowflake has a role.  Regrettably, Hollywood had few roles for blacks in the 30s and 40s and the roles it had were generally  comic relief and blacks played characters typically happy, subservient and  dumb.  Snowflake is Fred McMurray's butler and made a few early scenes in  the movie very dated.  (""He's not too bright, but he makes a great  sandwich"").  Nevertheless, the movie has a great script and gradually  builds where the viewer roots for the improbable pairing to work out.  I'm  surprised that I've never seen this movie on cable around Christmas because  it is truly a Holiday classic.",960854400,124,694,4.73109243697479
680006,4,6303560067,"Stanwyck is very appealing here as Lee Leander, the  shoplifting gal who goes to stay with DA MacMurray and his family during the Christmas holidays. You'd have to be a grump not to like this sentimental blend of  pathos, drama and zaniness which borders on Capra-corn yet never goes over  the edge. Realistic are the scenes where Stanwyck experiences a warm,  close-knit family (something she had never known) and the scene where she  confronts her cold mother (Georgia Caine) is  truly moving. Both Elizabeth  Patterson and Beulah Bondi give superb performances which are honest and  not heavy-laden. This ""holiday-type"" is great viewing for any  time of the year!  A superior Leisen directorial effort coupled with a  terrific Sturges script make this nifty little 1940 flick a keeper!",958953600,25,788,5.125984251968504

680120,5,6303560067,"More than 75 years after its original release date (Jan. 19, 1940), this perennial favorite about the love affair that develops between a petty shoplifter (Barbara Stanwyck) and her prosecutor (Fred MacMurray) has become a holiday classic.

The chemistry between Stanwyck and MacMurray was so powerful that they again co-starred in ""Double Indemnity"" (1944), The Moonlighter (1953) and ""There's Always Tomorrow"" (1956). Other top-billed cast members include Beulah Bondi (who was George Bailey's mom in ""It's a Wonderful Life""), Elizabeth Patterson, and character actor Sterling Holloway (who voiced Winnie the Pooh and countless other Disney characters).

The screenplay was written by Oscar-winner Preston Sturges. This was Sturges's last script where he did not also serve as director.

This edition of the Paramount pictures release is part of the Turner Classic Movies library. It is shown in its original black-and-white in a full frame aspect ratio of 1.33:1. There are no subtitles and there is no bonus material.  However, this holiday favorite is a treat all by itself. [Running time - 1:34:08] VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1485561600,5,1128,5.4655172413793105

The awkward ""Snowflake"" dialog was the only sour spot (until an ending that was a bit clumsy). My favorite parts are scattered evenly throughout but the topper is Stanwyck vs. a scene-stealing cow. I must have watched that a dozen times. She was a trouper, that one, and never lovelier (Stanwyck, not the cow).",1453075200,,395,4.91044776119403
680238,5,6303560067,"I discovered this film years ago in a video rental store and it has become a yearly Christmas film for me. Surprisingly, hardly anyone seems to know of it, but that was the case with me as well. It's totally overshadowed by Stanwyck's Christmas In Connecticut, which has become one of the top tier Christmas Classics over the years, and deservedly so. But Remember the Night is wonderful in its own way, often quite funny as it quietly works its spell on you in a way that has more warmth than the other Stanwyck film.

Lee Leander (Stanwyck) is caught shoplifting and John Sargent (MacMurray) is the tough District Attorney's prosecutor who is out to convict her. Trouble is, it's hard to get a conviction around Christmas, so he jumps at a chance to postpone the trial when her windbag attorney introduces a new theory of her innocence. Sargent is about to go home to Indiana to his widowed mother and aunt, but feels sorry for Lee and arranges to have her released in his custody, assuming she will stay at her hotel during the court's holiday recess. It's hilarious when she arrives at his place and thinks he has other things in mind., saying ""I suppose you do this with all the lady prisoners?"" Soon he discovers she has no money and is locked out of her hotel and so he decides to take her with him on his Indiana Christmas trip.

This begins a voyage of them discovering each other, at times in funny situations as when they have to sleep in the car for a night in a field of cows, or in sad situations, when Lee visits her Mother at her old home. The heart of the film is the quiet idyll at the farm where John grew up with his mother (Beula Bondi), Aunt Emma (Elizabeth Patterson) and their eccentric farmhand Willie (Sterling Holloway), and as it proceeds you feel you really don't want it to end.

The film was directed by Preston Sturges, one of the best director's of comedies in Hollywood's golden era. The actors work perfectly well together and the result is a really magical Christmas movie. Check it out. It's really worth adding to your holiday movies. I finally bought it, but I hope Amazon adds it to their Amazon Video streamed movies so more people will become aware of it.",1452988800,3,2197,4.4875

There is a little of comedy and drama in this story.  It was the first film with the teaming of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray.  In later years, MacMurray mentioned that Stanwyck was one of the easiest women he ever had the pleasure of working with and it shows in all of their films together.  The acting is first rate in this one, with MacMurray and Stanwyck looking very attractive as they spend the holidays together at his family farm and then fall in love.  Look for Elizabeth Patterson, best known to baby boomers as Little Ricky Ricardo's babysitter, Mrs. Trumble, on the I Love Lucy series.",1451001600,,775,4.5

He postpones the trial because it is hard to get a conviction at Christmas time. But he feels sorry for her and arranges for her bail, and ends up taking her home to his mother for Christmas.

I think it is Barbara Stanwyck's and Fred MacMurray's best performances ever (especially the scene with her estranged mother).  It has a golden supporting cast (Beulah Bondi, Sterling Holloway, to name two) and it ends in surprising and wonderful way.  If you can watch the scene when Sterling Holloway is singing ""A Perfect Day"" and not have your eyes fill with tears, something is wrong with your tear ducts!",1420243200,,540,4.8478260869565215
680399,5,6303560067,"Even though Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray's most famous cinematic pairing would occur four years later in the  1944 Billy Wilder film noir classic ""Double Indemnity"", I much prefer this lesser known yet sparkling initial collaboration ""Remember the Night"" from 1940.  I want to thank Turner Classic Movies for introducing this to me I believe during the Christmas season of 2009.  After one viewing it became a new addition to my list of favorite Christmas film classics, and each year since I never miss it on TCM.

Noted playwright/screenwriter soon to be producer/director Preston Sturges penned the screenplay in a deft combination of wit and sentiment.  During the Christmas season, Lee Leander, (Barbara Stanwyck) a beautiful accomplished shoplifter steals an expensive bracelet from a Fifth Avenue jewelry store.  She crosses over two avenues to Third Avenue and attempts to hock the bauble at a pawnbroker, who is tipped off to the theft and alerts the police.  Lee is arrested and comes up for trial a few days before Christmas.  Her bombastic, theatrical lawyer Francis X. O'Leary (Willard Robertson) wanting to close the case before Christmas, uses the excuse of hypnotism for the theft.  His hope is that the jury given the season and the closeness to Christmas plus Lee's being a woman will acquit her.  However, he is foiled by the savvy assistant district attorney Jack Sargent (Fred MacMurray), who gets an adjournment until after New Year's Day, so a doctor who is an expert on hypnotism can be brought in as a consultant.  Unless she can post $5000 bail, which she can't, Lee will have to spend the holidays in jail.  Jack feeling sorry for her, arranges with a bail bondsman ""Fat Mike"" (Tom Kennedy) to have her released.  ""Fat Mike"", thinking the worst, drops Lee off at Jack's apartment as he is getting ready to drive back home to Indiana for Christmas.  Softening further after realizing that Lee though temporarily at liberty has no place to go, and discovering she is also from Indiana, Jack offers to drop her off at her childhood home and pick her up on the way back.  Lee eagerly accepts and they take off on a memorable auto journey to Indiana that will change them both.

Once I read an appreciation of Barbara Stanwyck where the writer noted that she never gave a bad performance.  Amen to that, I will add to that she was a sure mistress of both comedy and drama. Only her contemporary Jean Arthur was able to transition so naturally and easily from the sassy, sharp, no flies on me wisecracker to a woman whose finer instincts emerge under mellowing influence of true love.  This is one of her best portrayals, full of delicate nuances and a depth of feeling balanced with a breezy comic touch.  Ms. Stanwyck will make you chuckle one moment and then touch the heart.  Besides this she is gorgeous with a playful, natural sexiness, what a woman!  It's a real rip-off that she was so deserving of at least one Best Actress Oscar, but never made that charmed circle, while lesser , forgettable actresses did!  At least the Academy tried to remedy this oversight by finally bestowing an Honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 1982.

If like me, you were a kid in the 1960's, you were probably familiar with Fred MacMurray from his Disney films such as ""The Absent Minded Professor"" and ""The Happiest Millionaire"" and his long running television series ""My Three Sons"".  He came across to me a comfortable, fatherly figure, but kind of bland, no real sparkle and no great shakes as an actor.  I was pleasantly surprised in my teens when I began to view some of his earlier films to see that he could play flawed, amoral men memorably in ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Apartment"", while alternating as an attractive, intelligent leading man in romantic comedies starring with and holding his own with Katharine Hepburn, Claudette Colbert, Rosalind Russell  and Carole Lombard to name a few.  I think he was underrated at times and taken for granted.  Here he is like Stanwyck's character, bright, self-assured and cynical, an ambitious, talented young lawyer with his eye firmly fixed on the path for success.  Yet, as he grows to know and care about Lee on their road trip home he loses his edge, begins to relax and his sense of humor begins to emerge.  Back in his childhood home, you see the loving, earnest young man he is underneath the slick veneer.  Ms. Stanwyck and he are a perfect screen duo, each drawing out the best in each other.

The supporting cast are winners all beginning with Beulah Bondi as Jack's gentle, sweetly loving mother Lucy Sargent.  She's well paired with veteran character actress Elizabeth Patterson as her sprightly spinster sister Emma.  You can see the positive influence they exert on Jack, helping make him the man he is.  A young Sterling Holloway, who later would achieve fame as the voice of Winnie the Pooh, has a nice eccentric touch as the hired farm hand Willie.  Willard Robertson has a very funny tour de force as Lee's over the top  lawyer flamboyantly summing up for the jury.  There is a petty vindictiveness in Georgia Caine's portrayal of Lee's unforgiving, chilly mother.  The one actor that made me squirm is Fred ""Snowflake"" Toones as Jack's dim witted, stereotypical African American valet, it's hard to watch.  Thank heavens that kind of role is a thing of the past!

Director Mitchell Leisen had a good touch with romantic comedies, as he had proved previously with his hits ""Easy Living"" and ""Midnight"", and this film is a highlight in his career.  Although here he did clash with Preston Sturges , in terms of trimming his screenplay to Sturges annoyance.  Going forward Sturges determined to have control over his screenplays, and with his next film would start on his acclaimed road as producer/director/writer with ""The Great McGinty"", resulting in such screen classics as ""The Lady Eve"", ""The Palm Beach Story"" and ""Sullivan's Travels"".

All in all, this is a rediscovered classic, and again a tip of the hat to Turner Classic Movies for introducing it for me.  I hope  you will be as delighted with this Christmas ornament as I was and add it to your pantheon of holiday films.  Happy New Year!",1420070400,,6203,4.813975448536355

680404,5,6303560067,"Slightly hokey, but heart-warming 1939 Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray outing where a cynical NY DA and a slick hard-nosed female jewel thief get together and have the opportunity to ""go home again"" to their joint roots in rural Indiana for Christmas through the New Year.  Remember the Night has a great cast of 1930's character actors, and appalling servant characters--particularly offensive is an idiot black servant role typical of the step-and-fetch-it characterizations of blacks in early American films.  Have to say the white laborer on MacMurray's mother's farm is also depicted as extremely slow if not an actual idiot.  Never could understand why servants were all expected to be idiots--why was that considered ""funny"" in early cinema?  Rural people were and are NOT stupider than anyone else, just with different lives and expertise than city folk.  I guess that's a bit too philosophical for early American film-making.  Anyway, while travelling and over the holidays, Stanwyck is transformed and MacMurray seduced, with a bittersweet ending typical of Stanwyck's staunch female roles over the years.  The holidays allow both individuals to step back to a simpler time and life and meet each other on equal ground.  The result is inevitable and predictable, but nonetheless entertaining and satisfying.  This is a holiday film and one of Stanwyck's I'd never heard of--so I was glad of the opportunity to add it to my vintage dvd collection.  Her usual Christmas film, Christmas in Connecticut, is better known and altogether different in tone.  This one was more expensive, but unusual vintage films often are--I thought it was worth it.",1419120000,6,1657,5.238636363636363

680445,5,6303560067,"A very good movie and very much in the style of the day (it came out in 1940).  One of the things I like the most about old movies is that they are done so differently.
  It is set around Christmas and stars a shoplifter (Barbara Stanwyck) with Fred MacMurray as the prosecuting attorney.  It all begins when she steals an expensive bracelet from a jewelry store and tries to sell it in another.  She's been in trouble before and the prosecutor, who is very good at his job, has no sympathy for her.  The problem is that juries are sympathetic to young, pretty women and especially so at Christmas time.
  The defense attorney puts on one of the finest examples of overacting when he tries to persuade the jury that she was hypnotized and thus not responsible for her actions.  Normally that should do the trick and get her off -- but the prosecutor asks for a postponement of the trial so they can have her examined by a competent psychiatrist.
  It's a cheap trick and he is a little ashamed of pulling it on her; so much so that he bails her out of jail and winds up taking her with him as he goes home for the holidays.
  I won't ruin the movie by revealing more; it is a wonderful slice of an old-fashioned American Christmas with a nice romance and an ending that is very interesting.
  I had never heard of the movie until it came out on DVD just a few years ago.  I love it and you may too.",1417132800,,1398,4.218867924528302
680486,5,6303560067,"My wife and I go back two decades for our love of Remember the Night and its heartwarming story.

I first became a fan of writer-director Preston Sturges' films Sullivans Travels, The Lady Eve, The Miracle Of Morgans Creek and The Palm Beach Story  all four star screwball romantic comedies  and started to seek out all the films he worked on.

Displeased with the way other directors interpreted his scripts, Remember the Night was the last film Sturges wrote before directing his own works. This is where I must step in and say that RTN director Mitchell Liesen was at his peak and did an excellent job with the material. His judicious editing of the script and his many light touches helped to draw natural and touching performances from the entire gifted cast. It couldn't be a more perfect movie. And I should know, I have watched Remember the Night more than 25 times, continue to be charmed and find something new to love with every viewing.

I first saw RTN on TV back in the 1980s when cable TV started playing black and white classics on the old AMC (American Movie Classics). I found it a completely original story, about a pretty young thief who meets a district attorney with a heart of gold. (I know thats rare, but believe me its possible.) Assigned to prosecute Lee Leander after she is caught stealing an expensive bracelet, John Sargent manages  with the inadvertent help of her blowhard defense lawyer (a hilarious Willard Robertson) - to get the trial put off until after the Christmas holidays. Feeling guilty that the shoplifter will have to wait out the postponement in jail, Sargent arranges bail. This first act of kindness sets off a domino effect of compassion and grace that shows the healing powers of love, acceptance and absolution.

Twenty years ago, on one of our first dates, I showed my future wife just one scene from this film on a poor quality video tape I made of that early TV broadcast. The scene where Sargents family sing The End of a Perfect Day is just a fragment of this heartwarming film, but when I looked over to see my sweethearts reaction, she already had tears welling up in her eyes and I realized that she got it. And to me, getting it is everything.

This is my wifes favorite movie, a one-sheet poster from it now hangs over our fireplace, and weve told hundreds of people how RTN is (to us) as good as The Wizard Of Oz, Casablanca, Singin In The Rain, Its A Wonderful Life, The Thin Man, It Happened One Night and many other four star classics you can watch over and over again and still feel all the magic of a perfect film.

Remember the Night was finally released on VHS in 1998 and looked fine when compared to a broadcast quality picture on TV. But it soon went out of print and still remained difficult to find or see for years. We started buying up VHS copies to pass on them on to other film buff friends. We held screening parties in our home. We took copies on the road and introduced the film to others. Remember the Night was both loved by those who had seen it and lost to those who could not find a copy.

After years of petitioning, TCM put it out on DVD in 2010. It looked better than the VHS and sold well for a forgotten little gem. Though the market for DVDs had started to fall off, because of its success, TCM released another version, now restored by no less than the Library of Congress, three years later. And now finally the topper  a brand new Blu-Ray version is finally available and it is stunning! The picture is a super sharp fine grain, showing more detail to enhance those subtle performances and the delightfully funny script. Watch it on the biggest screen you can find with the lights low, the phone turned off, next to the love of your life. You will thank me later.

P.S. As I type these words I am reminded of the inscription my wife had engraved inside the wedding ring I now wear Remember The Night.",1415404800,4,3896,4.4641350210970465

The premise is intriguing if far-fetched--accused shoplifter gets a continuance of her case and goes home for the holidays with the DA who's prosecuting her to rural utopia--but there's nothing in what follows that makes the viewer care much how it all turns out. In short, no real drama at all. Better spend that DVD allowance on ""Double Indemnity,"" a MacMurray-Stanwyck pairing that actually is a classic (just not a Christmas one).

In spite of sadness and pathos in these films, there was always an underlying hopefulness, an optimism that reflected the time of WWII. This film is not exactly a Christmas story; it takes place during Christmas time. Stanwyck plays a petty thief caught stealing and pawning an expensive bracelet. MacMurray plays a district attorney who takes her home for a family holiday. The two fall in love, but Stanwyck's character does the noble thing and decides to serve time in jail as she feels she is not good enough for her attorney boyfriend. However, you are left with the feeling that eventually these two will end up together.
What's interesting is a couple of other Christmas movies are based loosely on this film: ""On the Second Day of Christmas"" and ""Undercover Christmas."" All three deal with a female petty criminal who is put in custody with a male law enforcement type. Said male ends up taking his charge home for an old-fashioned family Christmas where they fall in love. Predictable, but still wonderful to watch.",1360972800,,1170,4.914141414141414

680715,5,6303560067,"Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck were a marvelous screen team.  They made four films together and, of course, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is their masterpiece.  However, their first outing, REMEMBER THE NIGHT was excellent as well.  It can't be called a comedy, though there are some funny scenes.  It can't be classified a drama, though there are dramatic elements as well.  It can't be labeled a weepy, even though...well you get my point.  MacMurray, was always an underrated actor, and this film captures him during his romantic leading man period when he was teamed with the cream of the crop among leading ladies and held his own and then some.  Stanwyck has always been one of my all-time favorite actresses and her performance here, I consider one of her ten best.  The film was written by Preston Sturges and directed by Mitchell Leisen.  Leisen was one of the top Paramount directors of the 30's and into the early 40's and writers like Billy Wilder and Sturges were always putting him down because they wanted to direct their own material (which ultimately they did), however, Sturges does a meticulous job of directing and brings out the best performance wise in both of his leads and the films wonderful collection of supporting players (fine performances by Sterling Holloway, Beulah Bondi, Elizabeth Patterson, among others).  The early scenes featuring Fred 'Snowflake' Toones, are at times difficult to watch as it is a very stereotypical performance and the MacMurray character, who otherwise is honest and kind thru out, is not very nice towards him.  But get past that and this film is a terrific romantic comedy-drama and the Christmas scenes at the farm of MacMurray's mother will evoke an earlier era when Christmas was all about family, decorating the tree, eating popcorn and singing around the piano.  While not really a Christmas film it has become a staple for many for the holiday season.",1358121600,,1909,4.968553459119497

680796,3,6303560067,"This is an enjoyable Christmas film which went largely unnoticed and unremembered for years (not one of the big films for Fred MacMurray or Barbara Stanwyck).  What brought it back into the limelight?  Well, the plot has been used for at least 2 remakes (in the 1990's:  ""On the 2nd Day of Christmas"" with Mark Ruffalo; and in the 2000's:  ""Undercover Christmas"" with Jamie Gertz and Tyne Daly) leading folks back to this movie (for years only on VHS).  Also, TCM has just released it on DVD-R.

The leads are both terrific.  One might quibble that this movie definitely has a dark side (especially for a Christmas comedy).  This can be a little jarring for those used to lighter-than-air TV Christmas movies.  The scene between Stanwyck's character and her mother is intense.  And the ending, while logical and hopeful for the future, does break the spell of the wonderful middle section where they are in Indiana with MacMurray's character's mother (Beulah Bondi).  The film wraps up rather quickly, and is vaguely unsatisfying, which is probably why it never became a runaway classic like other Christmas movies.

680805,5,6303560067,"This is a spectacular movie set in Christmas time about a petty (and pretty) criminal, Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) charged with theft and grand larceny is being tried by assistant district attorney John Sergeant (Fred MacMurray). John convinces the judge to adjourn the case until after New Year, knowing that a conviction against a woman during the holidays is hard. When John's conscience begins to bother him, he posts her bail and drives her to his hometown in Indiana. His mother and aunt adore her until his mother comes to know Lee's past demeanor. Initially she ignores that and recognizes that an unhappy childhood may be responsible for her delinquent behavior, but fearful of ruining her son's career, she politely asks Lee to stay away from John. When John offers to leave Lee in Canada so that she can avoid prosecution, but fearful of destroying his career, she refuses and stands trial in New York, and pleads guilty when she realizes that John has fallen in love with her. As she is lead away, John proposes to her and she promises that if he still feels that way after she has paid her debt to society, she will marry him.

The movie is strongly supported by the powerful performances of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray who pass through an incredible odyssey to spend Christmas in peace at his home in Indiana. We see two sides of a family, where Lee's mother is harsh and unforgiving who refuses to accommodate Lee even during Christmas time, but John's family is happy and understanding. When Lee finally learns the truth about her past and present, she strongly feels that she has to pay her debt to society, but she also sees brighter future as her conscience will be clearer for a happy ending. This is a story of Christmas miracle in which we see a transformation of Lee from her past to her future.

I was not much of a fan of Fred MacMurray unless he was doing comedy, but this movie is a delightful exception.  He really is good.  The premise, that a successful D.A. prosecuting a beautiful thief on Christmas would take pity on her and spring her for the holidays, ending up through a series of unusual circumstances to take her home to the family, and ultimately fall in love with her, is a bit of a stretch, but it all feels right in this warm family film.

They got it to me in just a couple of days, but there were no bonus features, just the movie!

Badly done, Amazon! Shame!

And while I'm at it, thumbs down to TCM, too! Why go to the bother of recovering a lost gem like this and then neglect to provide captions? While the transfer seems to be fairly competent, given the limitations of the source material, the overall effect is that you would expect this of a bargain-bin $5 disc, not a full-price release from the TCM Vault Collection.

680834,5,6303560067,"When most people think of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray they think of the great noir classic, ""Double Indemnity.""  Not too many people are aware of this film that the pair made four years earlier.  Now while I am giving this movie five stars, I have to admit that it is not in the same league as ""Double Indemnity,"" which to my mind is one of the best films ever made.  ""Remember the Night"" is an excellent Christmas film that deserves to be much better known.  The script by the brilliant Preston Sturges is outstanding, MacMurray shows the easy charm that he was to employ to such great effect decades later in the TV series ""My Three Sons,"" and Stanwyck displays a winsomeness that is very appealing.

Although this film is not as obviously Christmasy as Stanwyck's ""Christmas in Connecticut,"" which she filmed a few years later, in some ways the scenes at MacMurray's family farm in Indiana do a better job of conveying the true meaning of Christmas.  MacMurray and Stanwyck's drive from New York City to Indiana also does an excellent job of showing the United States as it was on the eve of World War II.  The film's main drawbacks are that the plot is a bit implausible and Sturges apparently couldn't resist including a stereotypical African-American servant part.  The actor who plays MacMurray's ""house boy"" Rufus is billed as ""Snowflake""!  Leaving those issues aside, if you are a fan of the stars and like 1930s/1940s Christmas films, you will almost certainly enjoy this film.

I purchased this DVD through Amazon, so it is a apparently a DVD-R, rather than a regular pressed DVD.  The quality seemed fine to me, although not noticeably better than the VHS tape of the film.

Well, he falls in love and they both end up spending Christmas together at his Mother's house.

They are both backed up by a superb supporting cast headed by Beulah Bondi.  The highlight of the film is when Stanwyck and MacMurray's characters arrive at his mother's house and they sing a song called ""The End of a Perfect Day"" on the piano.

The film, like many of its time, unfortunately, fails in its portrayal of its African-American characters.  Fred 'Snowflake' Toones portrays MacMurray's stereotypical manservant, Rufus, and it is rather painful to watch for the unprepared, as annoying a portrayal as Mickey Rooney's Japanese character in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"".

Of course, he tells his mother about her, and though she welcomes the girl, she also sees them falling for each other and talks with caution to Stanwyck's character, but the die is cast and the tough attorney who would never fall short by aiding and betting, now wants to help Stanwyck run away but somehow this time, she doesn't.

Know this before you purchase it!  The missing features and the fact it is a DVD-R and not a DVD figures into my lower (1 star) review.

680894,5,6303560067,"Barbara Stanwyck never looked more feminine or gave a more luminous performance than in this touching holiday classic directed by Mitchell Leisen. A fine screenplay from the great Preston Sturges and an excellent supporting cast bolster this sentimental film into a holiday staple you'll watch every Christmas.

Fred MacMurray is Assistant District Attorney John Sargent, charged with prosecuting pretty shoplifter Lee Leander right before the Christmas. He coaxes her defense attorney into a postponement so he can spend Christmas on his mom's farm in Wabash, Indiana. Feeling guilty when Lee reacts badly to being locked up during the holidays, he arranges for her release. Startled to find her childhood home is just a few miles from Wabash, John decides he can drop her off and pick her up on his way back to New York for the trial.

As with all good Holiday classics, one must just go with some improbable circumstances and accept what's happening. Stanwyck and MacMurray were a great team, and there are some very fun moments as they keep getting lost on the backroads of Indiana. There is nothing funny about the reaction of Stanwyck's mother when she goes home after all those years, however, confronted with bitterness and rejection. John decides to take her to his home home and they slowly begin to fall in love.

His family is warm and welcoming, only his mother (Beulah Bondi) aware of Lee's situation. Elizabeth Patterson is wonderful as John's aunt, taking an immediate shine to Lee and helping her get in John's heart. It is the family Lee never had, the one thing that might have made the difference in her life. It is a warm and moving moment when John's mother and his aunt make sure she is represented as well when they open presents on Christmas morning.

Stanwyck, often unfairly described by her critics as less than beautiful, has never been so much so as in a tender bedroom scene with John's mother, who knows her son might love her enough to ruin his career. John confesses his love for Lee at Niagra Falls and though she knows she shouldn't, she loves him also. She won't run, however, and when John starts to question her about the theft during her trial, she realizes in horror what he is doing. A gesture of love climaxes in a memorable ending for fans with a sentimental heart.

This is a warm and wonderful film to watch at Christmas, or anytime. There are fine performances from everyone and a truly memorable one from Barbara Stanwyck. A great film to own.",1266364800,6,2491,4.770301624129931
680895,5,6303560067,"I was planning on ordering this DVD - Remember the Night -- last fall when it appeared on Amazon's pre-order list, but shortly after it appeared, it was flagged as unavailable.  This is one of my favorite Christmas movies and until this release had only been available on VHS tape at a greatly inflated price because, of course, it is out of print.

Notification of its unavailability was disappointing, but in December Turner classic movie channel was showing --Remember the Night -- and the host, Robert Osborne, mentioned the movie was just released on DVD by them as part of their Vault Collection. Great news! I immediately checked their web site and ordered it for a very reasonable price.

This is a crystal clear print of the 1940 Preston Sturges black and white screwball comedy/romance/drama -- the film is too complex to wear just one label. Sturges' screenplay gives us a holiday film with heart, smarts and no convenient ""Hollywood"" ending. This is the last screenplay Sturges wrote where he didn't also direct the movie. Michael Leisen (Death Takes a Holiday) directed, and Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck supply solid performances as a DA and a shoplifter thrown together during Christmas. This is a classic film with snappy dialogue, irony, genuine character development and a level of unpredictability created by the very talented writer.

In addition to the movie, the DVD contains an introduction by Robert Osborne along with a group of Special Features that include the Original Trailer, Publicity Stills, Scene Stills, Behind the Scenes photos, Movie Posters, Biographies of the writer and director, along with Trivia. This film is a gem, a treasure, and easily the best inexpensive Christmas gift I bought for myself in 2009.

Update 11/27/2010: Amazon is now selling a DVD-R on-demand copy of the film which, according to a gentleman who left a comment on my review, does not have the features I noted. My review is for the DVD, not the DVD-R on-demand copy. I have no firsthand knowledge of what is or isn't included with that product.",1262908800,25,2063,4.9681159420289855

The actors are every bit as good as you would expect. It was interesting to see the clothes, furniture and other 1940's trappings. My husband and I particularly enjoyed the popular words of the day used in this move ie: sap, chump, fat head etc. The actress supposedly had nothing, yet she wore fancy clothes and a fur jacket.
The ending was disappointing though. It left you hanging as to whether she would have to serve time or not. Smoking was so pervasive and accepted back then.

This gets good after Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck begin their trip to Indiana. The movie turns out to be a pretty solid drama and romance with a few very touching scenes. Stanwyck's emotional scene with her mother is very memorable.  The rest of the story is so-so.

It's also interesting to note MacMurray and Stanwyck would be paired in a few more years in one of the most famous films of all time: Double Indemnity. They weren't so nice in that one!",1239667200,,558,4.346153846153846
680931,5,6303560067,"Stanwyck's lawyer describing to the jury, in ultra-dramatic terms, how the jewelry hypnotized her into stealing it, and hypnotized her into returning it--but first she had to get to Long Island and you need money to do that--so she stopped in at the ""hock shop""--is just the first of the priceless setpieces of Mitchell Leisen's classic weeper REMEMBER THE NIGHT.  People say Preston Sturges is responsible for how great this movie is, but I give Leisen lots of credit, and I don't know if I would have liked a Sturges-directed REMEMBER THE NIGHT.  You know there would have been more of the scenes which might have looked great on paper, but are clunkers on film--the scene where the cow eats Stanwyck's hat, the scene where the angry farmer brings McMurray and Stanwyck to the Pennsylvania JP (and she has to set fire to the wastepaper basket to escape).  Well--these scenes are beneath the talents of the stars--they might as well have gotten Bud Abbott and Joan Davis to play them.

As for the scenes with ""Snowflake,"" they are hard to take!  Maybe the one is sort of cute when McMurray impersonates Snowflake's voice on the phone, but the caller tells him he will never be an actor.  But then you see Snowflake looking puzzled in the background and you just cringe.

Those NYC scenes do have a peculiar pre-Code flavor to them, though, don't they?  Sophisticated isn't the word!  They're downright seamy just like Stanwyck pictures of 10 years before, with the implication that Fat Mike is delivering Lee to Sargent for sexual favors that will get her off the hook and result in a reduced or dismissed charge--and that's par for the course in prosecutorial circles.  At any rate, that's what Fat Mike seems to believe is going on--Lee too.  She's shocked when it develops that John Sergeant isn't going to require her to sleep with him.  So there's a bit of noir flavor in the first half of the picture, but once Beulah Bondi and Elizabeth Patterson enter the action, the movie becomes incomparably richer and more satisfying.

Others have described it better, the way Bondi treads a delicate course between coming to care for Stanwyck, and knowing that marrying her would be ruinous for John's career.  We may not agree with Bondi's position, and in fact we were rooting for the aunt to win in the debate, but Leisen's camera insists that we pay her respect and take her argument seriously.  Only under the pressure of Bondi's loving admonition, I think, is Stanwyck really able to change, able to see why her own harum-scarum life isn't ultimately very satisfactory.  I have no words for the scene in which Bondi pulls the strings of the old fashioned girdle to reduce Stanwyck's waistline from 25 ot 26 to a 1910 ideal of 19.  It is tender, physical, practical, luminous--and educational too--we were like, OMG, look at all those crazy underwears!

A fine screenplay from the great Preston Sturges and an excellent supporting cast bolster this sentimental film into a holiday staple you'll watch every Christmas.

Fred MacMurray is Assistant District Attorney John Sargent, charged with prosecuting pretty shoplifter Lee Leander right before the holiday weekend. He uses her defense attorney to wangle a postponement so he can go home to his mom's farm just outside Wabash, Indiana for Christmas. Feeling guilty when Lee reacts badly to being locked up during the holidays, he has an old pal post bail for her.

He brings her to John's place, however, and once the suspicious Lee realizes John had no ulterior motives, Lee confesses she has no place to really go for the holidays. Startled to find her childhood home is just a few miles from Wabash, John decides he can drop her off and pick her up on his way back to New York for the trial.

Stanwyck and MacMurray were a great team, and there are some very fun moments as they keep getting lost on the backroads in Indiana, even getting arrested for trespassing at one point! But there is nothing funny about the reaction of Stanwyck's mother when she goes home after all those years, only to find bitterness and rejection. John decides to take her home for the holidays and they slowly begin to fall in love.

John's family is warm and welcoming, only his mother (Beulah Bondi) aware of Lee's situation. Elizabeth Patterson is wonderful as John's aunt, taking an immediate shine to Lee and helping her get in John's heart. It is the family Lee never had, the one thing that might have made the difference in her life. It is warm and moving when John's mother and aunt make sure Lee is represented as well when they open presents on Christmas morning.

Sterling Holloway is marvelous as their farmhand Willie, who along with the rest of John's family gives Lee all the love she never had. The season passes all to quickly and after the New Year's dance it is clear John loves Lee and she loves him. Stanwyck, often unfairly described as less than beautiful by critics, has never been so much so in the tender bedroom scene with John's mother, who knows he may just love her enough to ruin his career when they return.

John confesses his love for Lee at Niagra Falls and though she knows she shouldn't, she loves him also. She won't run, however, and when John starts to question her about the theft during her trial, she slowly realizes what he is doing for her. She makes a gesture of love also, and in a memorable ending their future is decided.

  It is about a young woman played by Barbara Stanwyk who shoplifts and gets caught.

He takes her home to his mother who lives in a farmhouse in the South and shows her what family love is all about. Through their love and normalacy she learns right from wrong and repents of her crime.  My favorite scene is when they are all sitting around the piano singing on Christmas Eve. I nearly cry every time I see it.

Really appreciated Fred MacMurray looking so tall, dark and handsome in this one--even more so than in Double Indemnity.  I could see George Clooney playing this Asst. D.A. part, if he darkens his hair like Fred to appear a bit younger, and possibly taking the defendant to his old-fashioned home down South (George really does hail from Kentucky) to his farm to meet his family, instead of to Indiana.  Or, maybe Matthew McConnaghey could take lady crook home to his family's cabin in the mountains.  The other actress I could see in this part is Sandra Bullock, possibly paired with Tom Hanks, a modern-day, all around good guy. What a great comedy team they would make, who also can turn dramatic.
Please, Hollywood, just don't pair Jennifer Lopez with Antonio Banderas, or Madonna with Richard Gere.

680978,5,6303560067,"I am going to confess that I am a big fan of both Barbara Stanwyck and Mitchell Leisen.  So, the odds were heavily stacked in favor of this film well before I ever saw it for the first time.
Absolutely no one in the history of film played a bad girl better than Barbara Stanwyck.  ""Tough as nails"" could have been invented to describe most of her characters.  Unlike other Hollywood actresses, who were highly capable ""bad girls"", she was equally adept at comedy or drama, so that she could be funny bad in THE LADY EVE or BALL OF FIRE or scary bad in DOUBLE INDEMNITY or CLASH BY NIGHT or NO MAN OF HER OWN.  In many of her comedic ""bad girl"" roles, she has been forced to assume that role by the harshness of the world as she has experienced it growing up.  Typically, she just hasn't gotten her share of the breaks (as Beulah Bondi puts it to Fred MacMurray in this film, she probably just didn't get enough love growing up).  Many of her roles are of women getting a break for the first time.  And once a better way of life is presented to her, she invariably seizes it.  Lee Leander, her character in REMEMBER THE NIGHT, is quintessential Stanwyck.  An inveterate thief and con artist, she is so touched by the kindnesses shown to her by prosecuting attorney Fred MacMurray, that you hope and believe that in the course of the film she has changed for good whether she and Fred end up together or not.  Like in so many of her films, she is the streetwise, wise gal, who finally and genuinely wises up.  Any movie with Barbara Stanwyck at her best really needs no other reason to be seen, and this is Barbara Stanwyck at her best.  Luckily there are other really great things in the film.
I think Mitchell Leisen gets a bum rap as a director.  The book on him is that he was a moderately gifted director who rode the coattails of gifted screenwriters to success in the late thirties and early forties.  Certainly, he had some phenomenal scripts to work with.  Preston Sturges wrote the screenplays for both REMEMBER THE NIGHT and the great classic EASY LIVING, while Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett wrote the scripts for HOLD BACK THE DAWN, ARISE MY LOVE, and, what is probably Leisen's best film, MIDNIGHT.  This seems unfair to me.  Wilder and Brackett also wrote NINOTCHKA for Ernst Lubitch, and absolutely no one would accuse Lubitsch of riding anyone else's coattails (indeed, the claim would more probably be that he made their screenplay look better than it would have otherwise).  Also, while Leisen's best films were indeed from screenplays by either Sturges or Wilder and Brackett, he nevertheless managed to make several other excellent films, including HANDS ACROSS THE TABLE, DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY, and the film noir classic NO MAN OF HER OWN (another killer Barbara Stanwyck film, based on the novel I MARRIED A DEAD MAN).
Fred MacMurray is as fine as always.  It would really be wonderful if more people thought of him as a charming leading man of a string of first rate thirties and forties comedies and dramas (HANDS ACROSS THE TABLE, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, TAKE A LETTER, DARLING, and this film), who later transformed into a versatile character actor (THE CAINE MUTINY, THE APARTMENT) than as the star of MY THREE SONS and some kooky Disney films.
The supporting cast is great.  Beulah Bondi is great as Fred's mother and Elizabeth Patterson, who is one of those character actors who seems to be in every other film made in the thirties and forties, is the Aunt we all wish we had.  Sterling Holloway, the actor who did the voice for Winnie the Pooh, is great as the farm hand (it is fun to ask someone to close their eyes when Holloway begins talking, and identify the voice--almost everyone I have tried this with was eventually able to identify him as the voice of Winnie).
I want to agree with the reviewer who lamented the presence of Fred ""Snowflake"" Toones in this flick.  At his best, Toones only managed to portray dimwitted, depressingly subservient porters, red caps, bartenders, shoe shine boys, and house servants.  He appeared in hundreds of films in the thirties and forties, rarely getting any billing, and never playing a character embued with any dignity.  You can contrast him with Rex Ingram, who despite being a black actor at precisely the same time, never portrayed a character lacking in dignity and pride (his best know roles are perhaps the genie in the 1940 version of THE THIEF OF BAGDAD, God in GREEN PASTURES, the black soldier in Humphrey Bogart's SAHARA, and Jim in the Mickey Rooney version of HUCK FINN).  On the other hand, Toones made a couple of hundred films and Ingram around twenty-five, so obviously, there was money to be made in being an idiotic servant.  My 14 year old daughter watched this movie with me, and became intensely angry during the scenes in which ""Snowflake"" appeared.  She found it painful to think that anyone ever found him at all funny.  That he was playing an all-too-familiar stereotype is brought home by a line in the movie, when bondsman ""Big Mike"" (whose name Toones reports, predictably, as ""Big Ike""), shuts Toones up by quipping, ""Save it for your radio show.""  Unfortunately, he put in an appearance in most of Preston Sturges's films, so I encounter him a bit more often than I would like.
I was a tad perplexed by the title.  Remember what night?  There are several nights in this film, but none that really seem to stand out more than another.  I could have understood REMEMBER THE NIGHTS.  ""The Night"" intimates that there was a crucial event in Lee's transformation or in the progression of their love, but in fact the entire thing was a gradual transformation that took place over the whole week of the trip.  I suspect that Preston Sturges original had a different title for the screenply, but for some reason the studio changed it.  Just a hunch, but I would be willing to place a bet on it.
If you are a fan of romantic comedies, old Hollywood flicks, Barbara Stanwyck, Preston Sturges, or just good films in general, please do yourself a favor and see this movie.",989452800,37,6065,4.620689655172414

As for the disc itself... aye, theres the rub. It is intermittently playable on my oppo bluray player, why it works once for every four or five times it fails, who knows. This film desperately cries out for a Criterion style digital restoration - the quality of the print, when it can be viewed at all, is on the ragged edge of unwatchable in places, barely adequate elsewhere. If the film were getting the audience it richly deserves - along with Christmas in Connecticut and Its A Wonderful Life, we could be watching a luminous, crisp print with fantastic sound, like the excellent versions we now have of those other two holiday season classics.

As it is, you have to love the movie, as I do, to soldier on through a very dicey version. TCM occasionally shows the film on its regular schedule in December, and you might do well to watch Remember the Night that way until a well restored version is available on disc or for digital download.",1514246400,,1454,4.61003861003861
