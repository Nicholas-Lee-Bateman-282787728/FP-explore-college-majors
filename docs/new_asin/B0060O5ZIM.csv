Twenty minutes wasted making homemade fire starters from crayons. The bug out bag section everyone had the bag beside them but no one opened it up and showed contents .Dave Canterbury's portion is the only value. Go to the Pathfinder Self Reliance website and buy his Survival books instead.",1488326400,,405,5.059701492537314
