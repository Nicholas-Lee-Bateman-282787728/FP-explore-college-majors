8317663,5,B001L9EXOS,I have been a Lynch fan since the early 80's always interested in what he is doing. You can always learn something from this guy he is a great metal guitar player Eddie Van Halen can't even measure up to Lynch .,1349740800,,211,4.0476190476190474
8317664,4,B001L9EXOS,"I Just got the DVD's ""Wicked Riffs"" and ""Wicked Licks"".  They are both very high quality.  They don't come with a tab book, so don't get mad. However tabs are on the screen during the lesson.  I'm dead serious when I say ""Lynch fans only"".  If your not a Lynch fan don't even read this you wouldn't understand.  The stuff covered is stuff mostly from from the ""Souls of We"" recordings, except ""Mr. Scary"".  These vids do a good job of showing you how to pull off a lot of George's new techniques.  Again, I'm a huge Lynch fan and I'm blown away with how George's playing is ever evolving.  If you're looking for ""Breaking the Chains"" and other old Dokken staple stuff look else where.  The way the vids are laid out is cool.  George plays the tune, tells what kind of parts the tune is broken down into (i.e intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus and turn around.) Then takes each piece and shows you how to play it with tabs on the bottom of the screen.",1230768000,5,948,4.305084745762712
