Knowing our luck Season one will be out in February, but season 2 will not be available until six months later and so on. Lets just hope these are available back to back!!!!

3685278,5,B001LM64VA,"Great horror anthology; up there with earlier TV's Twilight Zone. I made a point to catch the show when I could and thought it was one of the best of its kind in many years. Well known directors and writers like George Romero, Stephen King and Robert Bloch. I'll like these discs even if they are upside down and backwards!",1231027200,2,323,4.4
3685279,5,B001LM64VA,"My personal opinion is that this season box set had all the best episodes. I started noticing when they used (what I call, the bloody looking tales logo), they were all the best. then after when they had the up to date logo, the stories got very boring. So if you have never seen the shows and just want to try it out...by all means, grab up this season because the rest is trash. I know I will get alot of bad comments on that but I know alot of people out there will say this season was the best. I mean when the next seasons appear, I would suggest buying them to try them out but I would buy them used for no more than 10 to 15 bucks. this season though is well worth the price tag!",1230940800,4,686,3.9424460431654675

3685281,5,B001LM64VA,I watched on Tv Tales on the Darkside when it first air and it was ok stories !,1230163200,,79,3.4444444444444446
3685282,5,B001LM64VA,"When we were young there were a handful of shows that stood out in our memory and Tales From the Darkside sits close to the top. Produced by George A. Romero, who brought us classics like Creepshow 1&2, we were given some creepy half hour shorts which would be shown late night on fox. It was just the best. At that age the intro alone was enough to keep you sleeping with the covers over your head. What could be better then sitting in a dark room late at night while the show started rolling? The unfortunate aspect is the show has not held up all that well over time as far as the scares go. This became evident once sci-fi started showing marathons of the show. When we found out Tales from the Darkside was being aired again it was exciting. Then after a few episodes it was a bit of a let down. So many of them are really weak and barely watchable, but the ones that are good are really good.

This first season promises to be the best with a handful of gems sprinkled in over the following 3 seasons. The most memorable episodes from season one are;

""Trick or Treat"" where a nasty old man plays a game with the local townspeople only to have the ultimate revenge brought upon him.

""Inside the Closet"" where a young student stays in a home to get ahead on her studies. While searching for some peace and quiet she discovers something much more horrifying residing in a tiny closet.

""Madness Room"" where a man's wife tries to get him out of the picture by playing a prank only to have the last laugh on her.

""Levitation"" where a magician's heckler pays for his challenge.

& Santa's favorite ""A Case of the Stubborns"" which stars a young Christian Slater who can't seem to make his grandfather understand that he's been dead for a couple weeks.

So despite the test of time the show is still really fun to watch. Sure some of the episodes may not be as great as you remembered, but it's more then that which makes the show so memorable. It takes you back to an era that can't be replaced with whats out there now. If you grew up with this series then you just can't help but love it.",1229299200,7,2092,4.281012658227848
3685283,5,B001LM64VA,"I never thought I'd see this day arrive. We no longer have to watch 2 or 3 episodes on an old, battered VHS. Now we can enjoy a much-deserved full season DVD collection of the eerie TV show I'm sure we all watched as kids back in the glory days of the Eighties.

Sure, the series in-whole has some poor examples, but several are fantastic and... the best part... the price can't be beat. Paramount has fashioned the series into a single DVD-style case at about $25.

3685325,4,B001LM64VA,"I loved watching Tales From the Darkside when I was little. Hearing the intro used to creep me out. Some of the episodes seem a little bit dated, but that's the way things were back in the 1980's. The only thing that would have made the DVD collection even better would have been to add some special features on the episodes. It would have been great if they added commentary from the guest stars or directors. They should have added the bumpers that they used to play (just before & after commercials). All-in-all, not a bad collection.

I ordered 2-3 of each season before I received ANY that were not broken in some way due to the cheap packaging. Out of the 10 or so that I ultimately ordered only 1 was undamaged.

Plan to buy other cases. I got these and other than having 4 disc slots when only 3 are needed they are perfect.

3685330,4,B001LM64VA,"If you were glued to the 'tube like I was when I was a wee lad, you couldn't miss happening across ""Tales from the Darkside"" somewhere on television. ""Darkside"" was a show that every kid I knew had seen at least one episode of, regardless of whether or not they particularly liked or followed the show. With its low-grade production values and sometimes incomprehensible/illogical storylines, ""Darkside"" came to be quite well-known in a whole subgenre of low-budget-tales-of-cheap-horror that were so prevalent from the mid-80's to the early 90's (alongside its compatriots ""The Hitchhiker""; ""Freddy's Nightmares""; the higher-budgeted, but still hit-or-miss ""Amazing Stories""; and even Darkside's own spin-off ""Monsters"".) However, it's my opinion that the low budget and sometimes shoddy writing was a part of Darkside's charm. If you fondly remember spending a rainy Saturday afternoon watching this show, then it's worth it for you to pick up this set because it is an instant time machine back to when syndicated shows seemed to rule the airwaves.

Like any anthology show, the episodes are really hit-or-miss and sometimes more of one than the other. For every episode on this set that still works (""The Odds""), there's an episode that's howlingly bad (""Mookie and Pookie""). Though it should be said that even the terrible episodes are not without their appeal - in example, ""Mookie and Pookie"", although laughably bad, weaves a story about computers at a time when computers were these completely foreign objects capable of seemingly magical things. Taken in context with today's technology, ""Mookie and Pookie"" is almost quaint with its scenes of dot-matrix printers and voice synthesizers which provided me with an unforeseen level of amusement. Don't get me wrong, I'm not ripping on the show for it being a product of its era, I'm just saying that I enjoyed this particular trip down memory lane that I wasn't expecting from a DVD collection of old horror stories. Plus, where else but ""Darkside"" am I going to get an episode that teams up Tippi Hedren and Justine Bateman in the same scene?

Yes, ""Darkside"" is awesome for featuring well-known (at the time) character actors and some celebrities of the day. You may not remember their names, but their faces are awfully familiar and, again, it's all a part of this series' charm. While the acting certainly goes from passable to bad to worse per episode, it's not all that distracting in the good tales and it may be the only thing making you morbidly continue to watch the bad tales. It's also important to note that not all of these tales are necessarily ""dark"" per se; in fact, some are far from it, but it's this mix of variety that keeps the show from becoming a little too formulaic (though I agree that some tales have an ending that you can see coming a mile away).

Now, some reviewers have noted that this set does not contain all the original music for each episode of the show and, honestly, who cares? I really can't believe there's this many reviews on here going on and on about the music. Now I'm not one that believes a studio should butcher a movie or a show just to get it out into the market, but arguing about the music cues in this series is ridiculous. First of all, to the casual viewer or fan, you would never even notice that the music's been substituted. The music is so unremarkable, that it doesn't even matter. Secondly (and perhaps more importantly), it's not like ""Darkside"" was ever a show that was particularly well-known for its music, so it's not a big deal that some of it got replaced. It doesn't appear to affect any of the episodes and I'm not a big enough aficionado of ""Darkside"" to be able to tell the difference. So, if the fact that the music got replaced is what's keeping you from picking up this series - knock it off. I don't think ""Darkside"" was ever a big enough moneymaker for either CBS or Paramount to go crazy and get the rights for every single solitary piece of music that ever appeared in an episode. In fact, we're probably lucky this series showed up on DVD at all, let alone got released as a whole and in logical order (Remember those series I mentioned earlier? ""Hitchhiker"" was released, but in a random ""best of"" order; ""Freddy's Nightmares"" has no official release; ""Amazing Stories"" got one season released and the other is in limbo - pretty ""amazing"" considering it was only a two season show and ""Monsters"" hasn't seen an official release either).

The other complaint I hear about this release is that the episodes weren't remastered or reformatted. Okay, look, it's a low-budget series from the mid-80's that has a decent, but not overly-zealous, fanbase around it... They're not going to remaster the series for HD snobs who think everything needs to be in 1080p with 7.1 surround sound. They're not going to reformat a fullscreen show into widescreen. The picture is fine and I think I rather prefer it this way because it reminds me of how I used to watch it on TV all the time. I haven't had any problems with the sound and I can hear everything perfectly (even that substituted music that has some people's underwear in a bunch). Arguing about this sort of thing is like arguing about the special effects in the episodes... What? You mean Paramount didn't go back and punch up all the special effects for ""Darkside"" like they did with the original series of ""Star Trek""? Those monsters! And they expect me to pay between $15-$20 for this garbage? Arrrrggghhhhh! To the internet with my crazy complaints because someone at Paramount will actually read my one-star review on Amazon and fix everything!

Bottom line is this: if you've never seen an episode of ""Darkside"" but are mildly curious about the show, rent it first. Get a taste of what you're in for and then decide from there whether you want to own it or not. If you remember this show fondly and want to rewatch some of your favorite episodes over and over again (or show it to someone else for the first time), pick it up. It's a decent return on investment for your money. I picked up this season on sale for $15 and it's been entertaining for me in one way or another as I made my way through each episode. Some episodes I remembered well, some were a first-time treat and some were just ironically enjoyable. If you can be satisfied with that sort of reaction from a mid-80's television series, then click on ""add to cart"" now. Meanwhile, I'll be making my way through season two...",1324857600,2,6482,4.722614840989399
3685331,1,B001LM64VA,"Sure, everyone mentions that the original music is taken out. Let me tell you, if you pay for this product make sure you buy another case to keep it in. Bought this at FYE in a clear case. The paper inside the cover was pulled up so high that the security sticker ripped the paper. Maybe that was FYE's fault? I don't know. Then when I opened the case a piece of plastic broke off. Clearly all costs were cut to make this cheap crap. Write to CBS to demand original music & better casing.",1321056000,4,488,4.147368421052631
3685332,1,B001LM64VA,"What everyone else already said is completely true. All of the episodes have been stripped of their music and the picture quality is mediocre. Hopefully the company who made this DVD will take notice and release a REAL unaltered Tales From the Darkside. The saddest part of this is that many, if not most of the original episodes with original music were uploaded on Youtube but Paramount just recently had them all taken down. It would seem as if they're trying to bury the original show and wipe it from history forever. In place of it we're given this cheap, shoddy, tease of what should have been the DVD set that could immortalize this show.",1317168000,3,646,4.626086956521739
3685333,4,B001LM64VA,"I am a Major Tales From The Darkside fan, I remember when the series came out; I would try to catch every episode I could. When I found out it was on DVD I did not hesitate to purchase them. The only diappointment i had with season 1 was some of the episodes were cut where a commerical came originally and Tales From The Darkside pops up for 20 seconds. I wonder why they did this on the 1st disc; and the rest of the 1st season and seasons 2,3, 4; all played through with no interruptions. I know it's not that big of a deal, but I don't know if it was a mistake or what. I thought the way it was laid out was great, you can either watch a few episodes or the whole 2hours and 45 minutes of it. I also thought the DVD's were all clear and the sound was great considering it's an older series. Thanks so much for a great series :).

3685334,2,B001LM64VA,"Did you ever remember liking something when you were younger then you go back and watching and it's not that hot?  That's Tales from the Darkside. I only likes maybe six or seven stories of the entire season. Pretty cheesy stuff. Too much light-hearted, thin scripting, lame dialogue, the picture on the DVD is horrific (!!!), and the plots were just weak overall.

If you're curious about this show, rent it, don't buy it for corn's sake!  The only episodes worth watching are:

Trick or Treat
The Wordprocessor of the Gods (Stephen King story, that's why!)
A Case of the Stubborns
In the Cards
Anniversary Dinner
It all Comes out in the Wash

the rest of the ""tales"" are either dumb or INCREDIBLY dumb! Some seemed unwatchable to me. This show was too goofy. I know it was supposed to be the TV version of ""Creepshow..."" hardly!

The only thing that scared me about these ""dark"" tales was how many episodes I had to watch to find good ones!",1311465600,,942,4.544378698224852
3685335,3,B001LM64VA,"This anthology aired an awful lot of dreck over its four-season run, but the debut is comparatively respectable. While the misses outnumber the hits about two-to-one, most of the quality episodes I recall from my haphazard acquaintance back in the '80s appear here: the spooky pilot Trick or Treat (so whole-hog in its finale that it doesn't feel like a Darkside episode), Stephen King's The Word Processor of the Gods, the wonderfully acted (and wonderfully gross) A Case of the Stubborns and Levitation (though it lacks the critical final scenes of the original Joseph Payne Brennan short story). The casting and performances are quite good -- at least for the first half of the season. Sadly, it begins to run out of steam on Disc 2 -- with plot twists too easy to read in advance, far too much padding and an ever-increasing flood of D-list actors.",1304899200,,852,4.802721088435374
3685336,5,B001LM64VA,"Tales From The Darkside - Season 1
This is a good anthology show, not a great one. It is no doubt a tv version of George A. Romero's great '82 film 'Creepshow', and it shows with it's dark humor integrated with it's visual horror. Not all the episodes/stories are great though. In the first season, there are some episodes that are great.
**** = great / *** = good / ** = decent / * = bad
Trick Or Treat (Pilot) **** - A great pilot, spooky for tv in '83 (which is why it was in syndication). Bernard Hughs is good as an evil town owner who delights in scarying desperate children in search of their parents' debt papers on Halloween at his house of horrors. Bob Ballaban directs George A. Romero's script.
The New Man - **** - Another one of my favorites because it's so devious. A recovering alcoholic is visited by a boy who claims to be his son named Jerry, but he doesn't have a son named Jerry. Who is this boy, and why is he claiming to be his son? It's a Twilight Zone-ish 'what's going on here?' style that is made even better by the casting of Vic Taybeck.
I'll Give You A Million *** - Almost one of the best with Keenan Wynn as one of two rich old men who buys his friend's soul for a million dollars only to getting more than he bargained for. It would have been great except for the very end.
Pain Killer *** - I liked Lou Jacobi in this that, again, seems to have fit in an 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' episode. A man with chronic back pain caused by stress from his wife is made an offer to take his ""pain"" away.
The Odds **** - Danny Aiello is great as a bookie who makes a bet with a demon. This is like a mini play - one setting, a few characters, but the way it's acted and plays out is entertaining.
Mookie And Pookie ** - This is a sweet-natured, decent episode starring Justine Bateman about a brother whose soul is in his computer and the parents want to pull the plug unless his sister can convince them he's in there. It doesn't take a lot to see the real ""point"" this episode is trying to make. It just doesn't fit with the 'Darkside' though. It's seems more of an 'Amazing Stories' episode.
Slippage ** - A man begins to slip out of reality. Fitting, though similar to 'Twilight Zone' episodes. I like the eerie tone it sets, but a similar story by Ellison for a story on the '85 Twilight Zone called 'Shatterday' with Bruce Willis is better. This is a bit more predictable.
In The Closet ** - A college girl who is being boarded by a professor (Fritz Weaver) is convinced something inside the closet in her room. This isn't bad, but you have to depend on the stupidity of the girl to get to the end which is somewhat surprising the way Tom Savini directs.
The Word Processor Of The Gods **** - One of the best and most memorable episodes for me. Bruce Davison stars as a writer unhappily married with a lazy son who recieves a word processor from his late nephew that changes reality with the push of a button. Steven King wrote this from a short story included in his book 'Skeleton Crew'. It's well directed, written and acted.
A Case Of The Stubborns ** - An dead man (Eddie Bracken) won't except the fact that he's dead as he walks around rotting. Also stars a young Christian Slater as the grandson. This one is played for laughs and disgust - not bad, but not lasting.
Djinn, No Chaser ** - A couple buy a lamp with genie locked inside who makes their life hell unless they can open the bottle. This is taken from Harlan Ellison's story (not surprisingly), and it's another one played for laughs - nothing scary at all. It feels like an 'Amazing Stories' episode. It's more silly fun than anything else.
All A Clone By The Telephone **** - A great episode with Harry Anderson as a struggling tv writer whose voice on his answering machine is trying to take over his life.
In The Cards **** - Another great episode about a fake fortune teller whose stuck with a cursed deck. I like the haunting twists and direction.
Anniversary Dinner **** - Three in a row, this one is one of the best for me because of the way it handles the story, characters, direction. A girl on the run from her abusive, controlling boyfriend seeks shelter at the home of an elderly couple celebrating their anniversary.
Snip, Snip *** - A witch and a warlock vie for a winning lottery ticket with Bud Cort and Carol Kane. Great casting with a nice twist.
Answer Me * - Horrible, one of the worst episodes. A woman is bothered by the constant phone ringing in the next apartment. What makes this irritating (besides the rediculous, cop-out outcome) is that the woman does nothing but talk to herself thoughout the whole episode.
The Tear Collector ** - Not bad, but simple story of a woman who constantly cries and a man who collects tears who is interested in her. Again, more like an 'Amazing Stories' episode.
The Madness Room ** - Your typical 'Body Heat' style story of revenge, murder and greed.
If The Shoe Fits... * - This is, sorry to say because Dick Shawn is in it, a boring episode. It's point is clear right away, one-note that is supposed to be funny but isn't, and it's not horrifying in any way either.
Levitation ** - A predictable circus story of a magician who can make things/people levitate in mid-air.
It All Comes Out In The Wash * - A good story idea that crumbles because of it's implausable confusion with the plot that tapers off near the end.
Bigalow's Last Smoke **** - One of the most memorable stories - seeing this as a kid stuck in my mind as really creepy. Richard Romanus stars as a man who is undergoing a sinister program to help him stop smoking.
Grandma's Last Wish *** - This episode is purposely annoying, but the ending image is worth seeing.
The False Prophet ** - A woman obsessed with fortune telling is stuck at a bus station with a controlling fortune telling machine. I like Ronee Blakey's performance especially, but the main story lost my interest half way through and ends up going for cliche rather than scary. The fortune telling machine's voice should have sounded a little more like Hal from 2001 than Harlan Ellison.
There is only one special feature included and it's a commentary by George A. Romero for the pilot. There are many spaces in between and only a couple of somewhat interesting comments from Romero are given. A small featurette or documentary would have been nice with interviews with some guest stars, directors, writers, ect. But at least Romero and CBS/Paramount finally released it on dvd. I can't say the same for Amblin/Spielberg who did not release the second/final season of 'Amazing Stories'.",1286668800,3,6578,4.410361842105263

1st Disc from Episode One until the middle of Disc 2 is of average quality. Part of Disc 2 through all of Disc 3 is entertaining and fairly good episodes and stories. I'm torn as to give 3 or 4 stars.

It lacks the cleverness of The Twilight Zone yet has just enough going for it to say some episodes are watchable and somewhat entertaining. I also enjoyed the dark humor some of the stories had. So we had some boring stories as well as some good ones and everything in between.",1275350400,2,3772,4.489795918367347
3685339,3,B001LM64VA,"Lets be honest, the best episode of the entire series was Savini directed ""In The Closet"". It came the closest to what this series strived to be, a successor to the original ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Night Gallery"". Unfortunately, this series suffered from the same problem of most eighties horror - too much humor and not enough chills. I'm a avid fan of seventies Romero films but this falls flat (as does most of George's output) when compared to those classics, even stuff like ""Season of the Witch"". I could barely sit through Season Two which was downright silly for the most part.

I'm sure I wasn't the only kid who wanted cartoons to hurry up and get over so they could watch this show, followed immediately by ""Monsters"" another great show by the same people.(Hopefully this will see a DVD release as well?) When the SciFi channel had marathons, I would record them, trying to get every episode. It seemed like they kept NOT playing 8 particular episodes. YEARS later, when I heard this was gonna be a DVD, I was getting a Christmas time feeling in August. So far the one thing that is upsetting people about the DVD set is the ""music being changed"". I watched the DVD and the music being different really didn't bother me. Seeing as this is my favorite show, you think I would freak out worse than anyone about the soundtrack being different from the one I grew to love. But it really isn't that bad. The original music is way better, don't get me wrong. Legal issues I guess are the reason things got changed, and I would rather have the episodes NOW than wait for those people to sort out the music issue. Besides, they still re-run all episodes on SyFy in marathons. TiVo them and dump them to disc if you want to hear the old soundtrack. Have fun skipping commercials, and seeing the SyFy ""Coming Soons"" getting plugged in the lower part of the screen. I think the DVD's are great.",1270512000,,1363,4.456

I just bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tales-from-the-Darkside-The-Movie/dp/B00005NG6B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tales from the Darkside: The Movie</a>&nbsp;since I haven't seen that one in a while. It's a shame from all the reviews on here about the dramatic changes in the show's musical score cues. I'd like to point out that because of this, according to wikipedia's article it explains this quote, ""Paramount has replaced music before with the release of The Fugitive  on DVD. Fan outcry for that set was so great that Paramount issued free replacement DVDs"". So until then I will not buy this series, I'll just record the show on the SyFy Network with my DVD Recorder. I find these shows more interesting because back then, in the 1980's, Horror in general was heavily monitored by censor boards, even Horror Films which were banned and had lots or some gore cut out, a-la ""Friday The 13th (1980)"" and ""The Burning (1981)"", which finally saw release on dvd in 2008 fully uncut, after being banned for several years. I used to watch this show every Saturday Night around 11pm along with others like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freddy-s-Nightmares-No-More-Mr-Nice-Guy-VHS/dp/630216690X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freddy's Nightmares: No More Mr Nice Guy [VHS</a>] which I own the only 5 VHS Tapes of that series that were ever released by Warner Bros Studios. ""War Of The Worlds"" & ""Monsters"" as well as ""The Twilight Zone"". These all came on every Saturday Night on the local FOX Channel back in 1988. I can't believe since by today's standards i.e. films like SAW which have a ton of gore, that it took them forever to re-release Friday The 13th (1980) last year, with the extra gore intact on dvd and blu-ray, which also got criticism from longtime fans of that Film on the poor re-production of the framing being too zoomed in. Anyway, thanks everyone on your reviews about this release here, I'm glad I read them before buying this series. Hence my C Rating.

3685353,5,B001LM64VA,"As a kid I simply thought this show was the best. Every week I would watch Monsters followed by Tales from the Darkside in an hour block of creepy goodness. It's funny how scary I thought these shorts were back then as opposed to how I view them now. Despite that fact the show brings back so many memories and is just great to watch. Unfortunately the conversion to dvd wasn't a good one in most fans eyes. There are tons of complaints in regards to the butchering of the show and the points are valid. It should have been so much better. However the show is still great and that's what my review is for. 5 stars for the show and 1 star for Paramount and their poor execution of the show on dvd.

Among the first season my favorite episodes are;

Trick or Treat (The Pilot Episode): In which a stubborn miser gets his comeuppance on Halloween

Inside the closet: Where a young girl rents out a room to find a horrific secret dwelling in the closet

A Case of the Stubborns: Starring a young Christian Slater who has a grandfather that won't admit to the fact that he passed away

Anniversary Dinner: Where a girl becomes more then just a guest at an elderly couple's home

& Levitation: Where a magician gives a heckler the ultimate trick

Just a classic show that still provides so much enjoyment. As far as shorts stories go Tales from the Darkside will always be one of my favorites up there with The Twilight Zone & Tales from the Crypt. It just provides a great nostalgic feeling making me feel like a kid again.",1247184000,3,1518,4.361702127659575

While I'm sure everyone idealizes the era in which they traversed from three to eleven years of age, the toys they played with and more importantly, the entertainments in which they partook,  I am confident in stating that there was something truly unique about growing up in the 1980's: Bruce Hornesby and the Range, that McDonalds Christmas commercial,Real Genius, striped socks and solid color shorts with seams in white...I'll leave you to fill in your own memories.

First, there was Star Wars and George Lucas' ""vision"" for the re-release of the Star Wars Trilogy and the prequels,which has forever tainted my memories of the original ""Holy Trilogy"" because I can't help but picture Hayden Christiansen's metrosexual mug beneath Darth Vader's mask every time I watch them.

Then there was the so-called ""fourth"" Indiana Jones movie loaded with camp and eye candy for the modern generation of prepubescents.  This time, I exercised a little foresight and sent two reliable previewers out as canaries, humble fans like myself who grew up idolizing Indy as children.  I'm glad I did because based upon their respective experiences, I avoided polluting my memories of Indy, and in this I remain stalwart.  Memories are precious.

The list seems endless...

NOW-the lawyers and ar-teests have collaborated to produce another long-awaited abortion.  Christ, I am willing to pay $50 for my memories, but I want MY memories.  This show is a favorite and a part of gowing up in the 1980's-my childhood-but it is one that must remain unsullied by petty bickering and penny pinching over (this time) ""music rights.""

3685358,5,B001LM64VA,"Back in the 1980's I watched and recorded on video tape, (and watched again and again), the Tales from the Darkside TV show. The original series was shot in 16mm film, which is not movie house quality, but was fine for TV, (this was of course long before HDTV). Romero and Rubenstein were striving for the 1950's EC Horror comic book feel and I think they perfectly achieved that. There has always been a claustrophobic air to the shows in this series that I like, and just like childhood comics that became ragged from reading them over and over, they bear multiple viewings,.
It was a no-brainer for me to get the Tales from the Darkside Season One DVD set upon its release. I've watched it twice. The print quality of the films are fine, much better that my old VHS copies. So, now I look on the Amazon reviews and discover that I failed to notice what some are saying was an unforgivable atrocity, that is, that the some of the original background music has been altered! If that's true, I never noticed it. It was a thoroughly enjoyable DVD experience for me. I can't wait for Season Two.
Do not believe those who demand that it is essential to pass this set up solely because the soundtrack has been unnecessarily altered. All that will happen if you do, is that you'll miss this great show.",1242086400,3,1297,4.476793248945148

That is until I started reading the reviews about butchered music and horrible video quality. I put off purchasing this set for several months, then finally broke down and got it, the nostalgic undercurrent pulled me under and kicked my a$$.

When I watched this show as a kid, it was on channel 30 in Memphis, so the picture was sort of snowy. That is how I remember the episodes, so when I started watching these DVD's it felt like HI DEF!!! No problem at all.

The second issue is the music. Granted, it's been 20 years since I have watched this show, but to me the new music seemed well done and I would not have noticed it was different had it not been called out and publicly bashed like Quasimodo. The signature opening music and voice over is intact! And believe me, that's huge draw of the show.

I have always been a major horror fan. I watched all I could Darkside, Crypt, Twilight Zone, Friday the 13th the series and Freddy's Nightmare's, as far as television goes.

Like a lot of people, I am upset and angry that the score has been replaced. I can accept that the release isn't given anything in the way of restoration but I think it's really poor that fans aren't given the show that they remember. I think it's particularly important with cult media that content providers are careful to cater to the interests of fans.

To the show. Like any anthology, it's a mixed bag of the great and not-so-great. My favourite episode is 'Slippage' starring David Patrick Kelly. It's quite reminiscent of The Twilight Zone.

I find this to be an enjoyable series. This is not simple nostalgia on my part. I don't believe I saw it when it was originally broadcast but picked up some ex-rental VHS tapes about 7 years ago because I was curious.

Romero who gave us the Living Dead saga and Richard P. Rubinstein (Producer of ""Creepshow"", ""Dawn of the Dead 1978 and 2004"" and ""Pet Sematary"") originally pitched this as a TV spin-off to their successful 1982 classic ""Creepshow"" but instead they wanted to not just throw horror stories but also Sci-fi and fantasy stories just like ""Twilight Zone"" or ""Outer Limits"" thus ""Tales from The Darkside"" was born on October 1983 then finally hit 1984 until 1988 for it has became a cult fave.

This season has the 1983 pilot episode called ""Trick or Treat"" which deals with a spoiled rich man who sends kids into a special haunted house attraction in his mansion to scare them witless until a weird visitor gives him one hell of a scare.

""Mookie and Pookie"" is a fantasy tale about two twin brothers and sisters who one of them dies and leaves his soul & mind in a computer for now the sister must prove that he exists in their.

""Splippage"" tells us about a graphic designer who finds he is losing his mind when he's slipping through reality, next is ""Inside The Closet"" where a female college student who takes a room at a room-and-board dorm from a professor who keeps literally a secret in one of his closets. ""Word Professor of the Gods"" is a Stephen King written story about a married man who's got a humdrum life until his newphew gives him a magical word processor that makes his life better, ""A Case of the Subborns"" is a funny story about a griefstruck southern family who's grandpa recently died until he's mysterious brought back as a zombie who refuses to believe that he's dead. ""Djinn No Chaser"" is a tale about a couple who buys a magic lamp from a strange dealer but the Genie in the lamp is unfriendly towards the couple until one of them frees him then he will be nice again. ""All A Clone by The Telephone"" is a bizarre story of a TV show writer who's answering machine begins to become literally enchanted for it wants to help the man, ""In The Cards"" has a phoney psychic who is tormented by haunted cards that predicts terrible futures for many people.

""Anniversary Dinner"" has a cannibalistic couple who takes a young girl in whom is running from her boyfriend as they invite her to their anniversary dinner and she will soon discover she's the main course.

""Bigalow's Last Smoke"" has a man trapped in a caged area by a anti-smoking company to quit his smokin habits, ""Grandma's Last Wish"" deals with grandmother who's about to go to a retirement home makes a special wish of her desire and finally ""The False Prophet"" has a fortune telling machine who desires a young woman and begins to become progressive yet hostile.

This season is a nice start with some good stars like Jessica Harper of ""Suspiria"" fame, David Patrick Kelly (""Commando"" and ""The Warriors""), Jean Marsh (""Willow"" and ""Return to Oz""), James Hong, Kareem Abdul Jabar, Keenan Wynn, Bruce Davidson, Harry Anderson, Dick Miller and Richard Romanus (""Heavy Metal"", ""Wizards"", ""Hey Good Lookin""), it became one of the most popular shows of the 80's and started out well.

3685391,4,B001LM64VA,"As a devoted follower of Tales From The Darkside in the 80's I can honestly say this was my most eagerly anticipated DVD release of a series EVER. I bought my copy from Target two days ago [..........] and I read the reviews here that same day. After that I had some trepidation and considered taking it back, but curiosity got the best of me and as we all know, curiosity killed the cat. Well, I have to say this moment is so bittersweet. I also have to say that all the unflattering reviews that you have read so far are RIGHT. The quality of the transfer to DVD is LESS (or at best, the same as) than the original analogue broadcast from the 1980's. This is unacceptable. When you purchase a DVD (of a beloved series)you EXPECT it to be cleaned up. That's why people are willing to shell out their hard-earned dollars for them.- The thought of watching their favorite shows looking BETTER THAN NEW. And there's no reason why in 2009,when technology has come so far that this shouldn't be so (especially for newer series from the 1980's to the present). My other gripe is another that you have heard so prevalently in other reviews for this product here on Amazon; that is the inclusion of new music within the episodes. I didn't expect this to bother me; I thought I'd never really notice. But I DID notice and as I continued watching all the episodes had a FLAT feel to them. Something was definitely missing. It even seemed as though some of the sound effects had been changed. Only the theme music is unaltered. So there you have it. I AM DISSAPPOINTED. The treatment that this show has been given has me stymied. It is ridiculous and uncalled for. And of course it had to be one of my favorite shows. I almost think this is worse than the time the Three Stooges were colorized. It's a similar crime. The only reason I decided to keep these DVD's is because for some mysterious reason I never taped the show back in the day, and I don't have DVR or Tivo NOW so I figured that this edition of Tales From The Darkside Season 1 (such as it is) is better than nothing at all. But, I also can't conclude this review without proclaiming to Paramount/CBS, SHAME ON YOU for releasing TFDS like this! I will be EXTRA cautious in the future when considering purchasing releases from you!

3685395,3,B001LM64VA,"Okay, even after all the hub bub of how terrible this set really is, I had to see for myself. First off, the show was shot on film (not videotape) period; even George Romero states this in the commentary on the pilot episode on disc 1. The film prints are dirty and there is some grain, but they look no better or worse then what any station is showing currently. The show was low budget to begin with, so it is never going to look like a brand new release, that is simply the nature of the beast.

Paramount spent zero dollars cleaning anything up, that much is VERY evident. George Romero's commentary is indeed new and is not made up of old interviews from the 80's (the reviewer here who claimed that is on crack). Then again if he didn't buy the series due to the music replacement, how did he listen to the commentary? ;) Think about it folks.

There are no extras at all on this set, but hey, its Paramount, we would all be shocked and/or amazed if they did include ANYTHING on a television on DVD release (heck even their TWIN PEAKS Gold Box Edition disappointed me).

I have to say I used to watch this series religiously back when it first aired in independent syndication and if the music has been replaced I didn't see too much of an impact or difference. Am I put off by the fact that the original music is altered or removed or replaced? Hell yes, its an awful and shoddy practice and should be outlawed by the consumers, but its still with us so we can grumble or you people can write letters to Paramount and complain. George Romero created the series, is he aware of what was done to the series' music? Anyone write and ask him? Or Rubenstein?

So, the new music replacements are just as low budget as the old ones if are comparing. Still I have seen far worse conditions released on DVD (NIGHT STALKER anyone? Eh Universal?) so try not to over-exaggerate, thus scaring to many folks off.  Will Paramount re-release these again with original music? Its Paramount, do you REALLY need someone to answer this question? REALLY?

So,if you just want to enjoy the stories and memories then I would say pick the set up, if you are so adamant you won't support the series release on DVD and risk stopping ANY and ALL future season releases, then go ahead and keep your memories cause that is all you will have now and in the future.

So in short, yes Paramount should be ashamed of this release with zero extras and replaced music. I still am enjoying the series regardless. If you are on the fence, and know the budgetary limitations the series had originally, its not THAT big a stretch to live with the replaced music. Enjoy it for what it is, not what you utimately would like it to be.",1235520000,8,2699,4.386
3685405,3,B001LM64VA,"Back in the 1980s, I used to watch ""Tales from the Darkside"" when my parents were out of the house on an occasional Saturday evening and my siblings were upstairs in bed. Even then the rubbery acting and hit-or-miss stories were apparent to me, but the show's headstrong attempt to creep out horror-loving people like myself was endearing, and what's more, the dark twists to the conclusion of some of these scripts were actually pretty amazing at times. I think that's why I tuned in to ""Darkside"" most: to be surprised.

Unfortunately, season one offers few plot twists that lead to shock, though there are a few gems. On early ""Darkside"" tales, subtly is mostly left out in favor of ham-handed scare gags, while the characters tend to be a bit one-dimensional, the plots are mediocre to poor and evil cackling is unnecessarily added. But a funny thing happens as the shows progress: The plots become more complex; current-day issues begin to arise; a few noticeable faces from the acting world of the 1980s begin to pop up; and, probably scariest of all to most horror fans, a few scripts are even life-affirming, such as ""The Odds"" with Danny Aiello. Another fascinating script to watch these days is ""Mookie and Pookie,"" starring Justine Bateman, which perfectly captures the burgeoning popularity of personal home computers at the time. Though vilified at the start of the story, the miracle of communication via a computer ultimately gives the machine its redemption. After watching ""Mookie,"" it's actually not so difficult to fast-forward to the present and visualize how communication behemoths like Facebook got their start.

Whatever mayhem was going on, ""Darkside"" stories always had a pervading sense of plastic weirdness, mixed with a touch of you'll-get-yours-in-the-end humor, that gave them a creepy edge. Indeed, these eight tales won't disappoint in that sense.",1235520000,4,1880,5.10064935064935
3685406,3,B001LM64VA,"I've always been a fan of the movie but never saw the TV show, and when I noticed all the sterling reviews it was getting and found it at a great price, I picked it up.  Sadly, right away I could tell it was not going to appeal to me, and as I watched more episodes in hopes that it would get better, I found I was forming a litany of gripes with it.  The show is clearly a product of the 80s, signified by the cheap looking intro (where the ""dark"" world is shown by using a negative of an image) and the pedestrian picture quality.  The acting is horrid, with the majority of actors giving one-note performances, which might not be so bad if the show gave us compelling stories ... not so.

Like the EC and 60's DC and Marvel horror comics I adore, many of the stories hinge on a final twist, and yet many of them don't handle this well, telegraphing the twist far too early (""If The Shoes Fit,"" ""Grandma's Last Wish,"" ""Anniversary Dinner"") or using a twist that doesn't make a lot of sense and so isn't earned (""Trick or Treat,"" ""The New Man"").  There are a few episodes that actually handle story and suspense well, such as ""Snip, Snip"" and ""The Madness Room,"" which despite their low-budget pedigree are on par with any Tales From The Crypt story, but these are subsumed by the overwhelmingly poorer episodes.  ""The False Prophet"" is the perfect example of an episode gone wrong, with an annoying one-note lead and a story that rips the best elements of the Twilight Zone episode ""Nick of Time"" and the ""Bishop of Battle"" segment from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nightmares/dp/B00000K0DZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nightmares</a>&nbsp;and creates a silly mash that ends all too predictably.

Thankfully, the episodes are brief (about 21 minutes each), and so Paramount was able to fit the entire 24 episode season on 3 single-sided discs.  Because they were created for TV, all of the episodes are given a standard presentation instead of widescreen.  The DVD case is standard-sized, or the size of a regular DVD case, with a single leaf that holds 2 discs, the 3rd residing on the inner right side of the case.  The case is clear plastic and the artwork is double-sided, with the episode listing and a brief summary for each one printed inside.  All in all, the set is compact and nicely-packaged (I'm a big fan of clear DVD cases!).  My 3-star rating for this product comes from averaging 2 stars for the unintentionally cheesy show, and 4 stars for the packaging.

No offense intended to the fans who grew up watching the show and those just getting into it.  I'm just looking to caution those who haven't seen it and are thinking about buying it - rent it first.  Also, I'd suggest instead getting any set of Tales From The Crypt as well as Alfred Hitchcock Presents, the newer Outer Limits, and the far superior&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tales-from-the-Darkside-The-Movie/dp/B00005NG6B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tales from the Darkside: The Movie</a>.

I just cancelled my order. I used to love this show. The show had many good moments. How sad. But what can you expect....it's good thing that Paramount sold the rights to Hitchcock's Psycho years ago. If not, we might have been subjected to a special DVD release of the Hitchcock Classic with Herrmann's score replaced by Yanni. Nothing against Yanni...but material should be released as close to originally aired as possible. Does Paramount really think that fans would stand for this?",1234915200,10,646,4.9907407407407405

Stand out episode has to be Answer Me. Jean Marsh shines in this one woman show about an actress slowly being driven made by a ringing telephone in the apparently empty apartment next door. It shows how effective an anthology series can be with a good script and minimal cast and settings.

As far as music replacement goes, I think anyone would be hard pressed to notice. The score was made up of library tracks and having some of those replaced with other generic tracks certainly doesn't detract from the proceedings.",1234828800,4,709,4.664

Well anyway I really did enjoy this little treasure, but I wish they would include some 80's commercials in between each segment during the episodes like say McDonalds, Burger King, maybe some old Mr. Clean commercials.  I can remember how the excitement of seeing the next segment kept me going so I kept my eyes peeled on the TV set which made me watch all those commercials.  I only give it 4 out of 5 stars, only because I think the quality of the DVD's could have been a little better, but better this than nothing at all.

I've read some reviews complaining about some of the score being replaced due to legal issues, but honestly, I can't tell the difference.  I can understand the purists being upset, but I'm perfectly happy with this.  And for me, as long as the title sequence and music are untouched, which they are, that's good enough for me!  As a child, that's really all I remembered anyway: that scary opening sequence! So, negative reviews aside, give this dvd set a try.  I'd hate for an overwhelming negative response keeping the other 3 seasons from getting released on dvd.",1234569600,4,719,4.534883720930233

I like the grainy look of the show. It makes me feel like I'm watching it all over again just like when I was a kid. Most are wondering why the small changes to the set. The cost savings on the case, soundtrack, and keeping the grainy original look all helped make this dvd a reality. Paramount knows this show is a cult classic and that they will not sell a great amount of units so they had to skimp on the little things in order to allow the fans to see what they initally wanted...this classic on dvd. Shame on all the people and thier bickering over the small stuff with this set. I'm just glad i finally own the first season on dvd. All this negativity is what is keeping other classics like Freddy's Nightmares and Monsters from being released.",1234483200,5,1076,4.467005076142132
3685428,4,B001LM64VA,"It's important to understand I'm writing this review with a 24 year gap, as it has been that many years since I've watched Tales From the Darkside. I'm not writing a review of the original airings, but of the First Season DVD with respect to picture and sound.

The picture quality seems to be VHS quality. It is definitely not in 480 lines of resolution and is most likely in 240 lines of resolution. This is OK, because this is how things were when I was growing up. Just be prepared. It is not easy to go back to VHS quality after becoming accustomed to 500 or more lines of resolution, but once you get started watching, your eyes will adjust. If you still have an old tube TV set, it might be worth your time to use it for these episodes. I own a plasma, so I do not have that option.

I remember the title music very well, because it scared me as a child. It is intact. I do not remember the music that played during the show, since I never saw any episode more than once. So, I can tell you that the title music has not been altered, but I can not say anything about the music during the show, other than the fact that background music does play from time to time.",1234483200,3,1171,4.131578947368421

I'm not one that is particular enough to notice the change in music, so I can't complain about that. What I did like is that scenes that were edited for TV commercials seems to have been put back in again. There are some scenes that I've never seen before. I've been a fan for years, like many of you, and it is basically great just to have them on DVD, hopefully season two will have better treatment than this season got.",1234396800,2,598,4.300884955752212
3685430,1,B001LM64VA,"I rented this set and CBS, as others have said, ruined the perfect opportunity to release this classic show to disc. So since they decided that buying the rights to some tunes is too much of an investment, they released the majority of the episodes with their own music. WOW! Just think. A Super Bowl 30 second commercial can rake in millions yet these guys cry this would break their bank. I'll pass on buying.

3685431,1,B001LM64VA,"News of the release of Darkside's first season on DVD was long awaited. Unfortunately, the product ultimately delivered was a tremendous disappointment. Please be aware that all of the show's original music has been changed here for every episode as far as I can tell, with the exception of ""Inside the Closet"", which is presented with its original score. In all fairness to the producers of the set, this music alteration is mentioned on the back of the DVD case, along with a statement about some episodes that may be modified. However, these facts are stated nowhere in the amazon.com product description, so many buyers may find this out after the fact.

  It appears that music library licensing has forced the producers of this set to strip the series of all of its original soundtracks. I find it somewhat difficult to believe that compensatory arrangements couldn't have been made with the original composers or their families in order to allow for this music to be included in the DVD release. Consider the DVD release of The Twilight Zone, for example. Beyond the 4 or 5 major composers that contributed music to that series (Herrmann, Goldsmith, Constant, etc), there were a plethora of other musicians that contributed little musical cues, as confirmed by the new Zone book by Martin Grams. With this in mind, the Zone DVDs still present all of the original music from the series. Again, I find it difficult to believe that the producers of the Darkside DVD set could not have done the same.

  I personally would have paid $20 to $40 more for the set if it included the original music. For me, the inclusion of altered music makes the DVD set utterly unacceptable and unwatchable. For all of its campiness, low production value and overall marginal episode quality, I really feel that the music of this series was well written and indispensable. Some viewers, and especially anyone new to the show, may not care about the altered soundtrack. However, for anyone with even a casual admiration for the series, I would think that the changes made here will be of great concern.

Regarding the picture quality of the DVD release, it appears that no effort was made by the producers to improve upon or re-master the video. This being said, I would not say that the visual quality is poor. It is at best average, but does not take away from the enjoyment of the viewing experience. That said, it is my opinion that the visual quality of the program as aired on the Sci Fi channel is better than what one would get with the DVD release. If nothing else, this is still disappointing.

  There are two other very minor issues that I would like to mention. This is really nitpicking on my part, but hopefully it can be of value to someone. First, the commentary by creator George Romero that is advertised in the product description appears to be nothing more than bits taken from an interview done with him around the time of the creation of the series circa 1983. In other words, Romero has not been actively involved in contributing any new material to the DVD release, which he could easily have done. This is in a way deceptive advertising, as the product description leads one to believe that Romero provided new commentary for the purpose of the DVD release. In addition, this supposed commentary appears as an option for only one episode, the pilot ""Trick or Treat"". My initial impression after learning of the inclusion of commentary was that Romero would sit down and review at least 5 of the most well written episodes of the season. The second gripe is virtually meaningless, but something that was still disappointing. The show's commercial bumpers are not included in the set. This is trivial, but I cannot help to again reference the DVD release of The Twilight Zone, which does include all of the original show bumpers as each episode went to commercial. In virtually every way, the Zone DVD release is IMO the model for which all other TV programs should strive. Unfortunately, this release came nowhere near to satisfying what the fans of the program deserve.",1234310400,142,4080,4.76628895184136
3685432,1,B001LM64VA,"I really can't believe that I'm on Amazon actually giving a Tales from the Darkside product a negative review... but here I am doing just that. I consider myself one of the biggest ""Darkside"" fans ever. I have been waiting 15 years for this show to get the treatment it so rightfully deserves, and what does Paramount/CBS DVD do?  They TAKE OUT ALMOST EVERY PEICE OF ORIGINAL MUSIC IN EVERY EPISODE!  I have the entire series made from TV airings burned onto DVD from my DVR, and these DVD's only improve on the picture quality a microscopic bit.  Grain is apparent everywhere.  This is inexcusable.  If they can make Night of the Living Dead look like it was made yesterday, then they can fix up an 80's show!!!  Speaking of ""Night of the Living Dead"", all of the musical tracks from ""Night"" as well as ""Creepshow"" ( two of George Romero's most remembered films ) are taken out completely. Funny thing is, ""Night of the Living Dead"" is in the public domain, so this couldn't be a rights issue.  So what do we get instead?  An incredibly inferior alternate soundtrack that sounds like someone is playing around on a Casio keyboard.  This is the first review I have ever done for Amazon, and I am really sorry that it has to be a negative one, but come on Paramount!  You can't get anything right!  Can you watch Titanic, Rocky, or Star Wars with the soundtrack completely changed?  Of course... but why would you want to?  It would be almost a sin.  But Paramount likes to experiment with this on one of the greatest and creepiest shows of all time.  What do I rate ""Tales from the Darkside"" as a series?  That's easy: 6/5.  What do I rate this set?  I've had bowel movements that have been better.  Hopefully, if enough people complain, this will be rectified... and I'm praying that's the case so that this show won't be remembered as ""That 80's show with the bad soundtrack""!  Paramount is the devil.",1234310400,74,1903,4.524926686217009
3685433,1,B001LM64VA,"Like other reviewers, I've been an avid fan of this series since it premiered when I was a kid.  So, when my brother broke the news to me last week that the first season would be released on dvd, I ordered my copy immediately.  Shipping took 2 days from the time of availability.  I thought, ""this is too goood to be true.""  Well, it is.  The big problem I have with the release is that A FEW EPISODES DO NOT CONTAIN THE ORIGINAL MUSIC.  Now, I'm not referring to the beginning and ending titles.  That music is the same.  Just do me the favor of comparing the Youtube versions of ""Trick or Treat"" and ""The Odds"" with the versions on the disk.  You will notice markedly different music throughout the course of the episode.  And these are two of the greatest episodes in the series!!!

Many people would find this trivial; to have the episodes in one place for the first time is enough.  However, I am certain there are fans out there for whom this has been a long anticipated event who will be disappointed.  My memories of this show are not just the stories:  they are the images, the diaglogue and, yes, THE MUSIC.  George Romero should be ashamed of himself.

Now, it is possible that having been syndicated, these episodes were not shown with the original music since their first airing.  I invite anyone to prove that assumption; it would be reassuring.",1234224000,48,1359,4.481632653061224
3685434,1,B001LM64VA,"""Tales From The Darkside"".  I love this show as much as those of you that have already posted reviews.  Therefore, I've got to be honest.  The episodes do not appear to be edited of any footage (which is very good) but there is a big problem:  all of the library music used in the first season has been replaced (to me, a very bad thing).  I understand that when shows like this were created, using library music was very commonplace; however, with the creation of DVDs it seems that library music tracks pose a problem for releases such as this and other series (such as library music used on ""The Fugitive""; DVD releases of that series have had their library tracks removed as well).  Though it's not much, the silver lining is that the new music created to replaced the original library tracks sounds similar to the library tracks it's been created to replace.  Little of the original music created by composers for season one remains (Such as tracks used in the episode ""Inside The Closet""), but not all of the episodes are as fortunate (For example, the episode ""I'll Give You A Million"" is missing the original music composed by John Harrison).  Luckily, the Opening and closing theme remains untouched which will please fans (Though the bits of it heard in the Pilot ""Trick Or Treat"" have also been removed).

The picture looks as well as one would expect; a bit grainy, but considering the age it looks very good.  The same cannot be said for the 'Commentary Track'.  It's always great to hear George Romero talk about his work on specific films, but from what I understand it's not a true commentary track (George didn't sit down and watch the episode ""Trick Or Treat"").  Instead, he was interviewed for an hour and the bits concerning the creation of the series and bits about the pilot are spaced about the 23 minute run of the episode.  In fact, there seem to be several minute breaks inbetween George's input and can be a distraction as you wait to hear more about the series... only for things to pick back up after two or three minute breaks.

I originally rated this five stars, but I've decided to lower the rating due to the treatment of this show by Paramount (the music changes and the commentary track being a let-down).  I would have prefered George's Hour-long interview to have been included as the extra instead interspersed with scenes from the episodes referenced.  If you are a fan of this series, avoid this DVD because you're not getting the show the way it was originally broadcast as.  Show Paramount that treating ""Tales From The Darkside"" like this is a good way to lose business.",1234224000,9,2614,4.6355748373101955
3685435,4,B001LM64VA,"...wow, are there some gems. What makes ""Tales from the Darkside"" really stick out amongst the crowd is its writing. Everyone from George A. Romero to Robert Bloch to Stephen King lend their talents as a means to turn out the terror. In a lot of ways the series feels like an extension of Romero's stellar Creepshow, which many (including myself) consider to be one of the greatest horror anthologies ever put to film.

However, Tales from the Darkside was one of the best horror TV shows ever.  In my opinion it was wedged right between the Tales from the Crypt and Friday the 13 TV series.  This collection has many dark but humorous favorites but my all time favorite was ""Trick or Treat,"" which I believe was created by George A. Romero.

If you have never seen this series, do yourself a favor, buy it now! You have writers such as George A. Romero, Robert Bloch, Stephen King, and many other fine talents in this collection.  If your a horror buff like myself you will treasure this warped series for the rest of your life.
