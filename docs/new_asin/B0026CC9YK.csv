A movie for children, or for those who, like me, do enjoy animations.
The history is quite innocent and romantic, it's also fun. One thing about the indian movies is their innocence, lost now in these days when all movies are full of sarcasm and second meanings. The shine of the eyes, the romantic songs, and even the innocent kind of humour, well, certainly 100% safe (clean) for children. For me it's good enough in order for having it in my collection. The soundtrack, although with latin and spanic rythms, has an indian touch in the orchestration that I find amazing.",1247702400,6,728,5.813084112149533

8352484,4,B0026CC9YK,I am so happy with this movie it came about 2 or 3 days earlier then they said and for that I was very happy. BUT when it came here the plastic inside was broken I don't know why I paid for shipping and handling when they didn't handle it. Actually they did. They man handled it so now the movie won't sit in the box that aside it is a wonderful movie good fun if you love classic love stories and dogs. Buy this. Buy it!!!,1331596800,,423,3.8735632183908044
8352485,5,B0026CC9YK,"I think this is a gem of a movie. equal to ones like ""Madagascar"" or ""Over the Hedge"" and the like.  Though financed by Disney, they have apparently so interest in marketing it to the masses.  Quite a shame, for they usually market their own product without end.  So I guess word-of-mouth will have to suffice here.  If you are a fan of anthropomorphic animals in 'toon or written story this movie is a MUST!  The design of the characters is interesting and varied.  This is first-rate CGI in my opinion.

Buy this, enjoy it, and PLEASE, pass the word along.  This movie deserves so much better than the ""back-burner"" treatment it's being given by Disney.  If you'd like, go to ""You Tube"" and look under ""Roadside Romeo"".  There are many things there that will give you a ""preview"" of the movie to see before you make your purchase here at Amazon.  There are the songs of the movie, which are on the DVD as a separate part, along with being in the movie itself.  There's also on both ""You Tube"" and the actual DVD a ""music launch"" that they did to promote the movie there in India and there are actual fursuits of both ""stars"" of the movie, ""Romeo"" and ""Laila"".

Have I made myself clear...buy this movie!",1308096000,7,1205,4.447488584474886
8352486,4,B0026CC9YK,"Roadside Romeo isn't what I'd call a box office hit, but I do think it's underrated.
So far, I think it is India's best animated film to date, but more importantly, I think the script is fabulous. The story is cute and family-friendly (even if a little far-fetched... but that's Bollywood for ya!). I found the jokes in the movie to be hilarious and my senior parents were also very much entertained.
For me, it was worth buying the DVD to watch over and over again because, thankfully, there are little nuances and details added in the background of many scenes that will bring an additional smile to your face. I didn't see these till the second or third time I saw the movie, but they were worth catching!
I don't regret this purchase. The DVD case was a little scratched up when it arrived (the plastic casing had a tear in it), but the DVD inside was perfectly fine. The subtitles are also well done :).",1300060800,,908,4.4431137724550895
