8699688,4,B00SXA4ELK,I really liked this movie.  It reminds me of the Lethal Weapon movies with Mel Gibson.,1431043200,,86,4.375
8699689,3,B00SXA4ELK,"We need your help. This is a small town, we don't get to many of these types of crime around here. This isn't LA, this is Baton Rouge. Frank Vega (Trejo) and Bernie Pope (Glover) have been invited to the wedding of the daughter of an old friend. What starts off has a happy occasion changes when she is kidnapped. When the cops aren't doing enough Frank and Bernie take matters into their own hands and as usual, will stop at nothing to fix things. This is a series that I cant believe is still going. Im not saying they are bad movies, just more unnecessary. Trejo has a huge cult following and Glover seems to have fallen a long way since Lethal Weapon, but they both fit will together. As far as the movie goes, its basically the same thing as the other two. Two old guys fighting for what is right and a decent blend of humor and action. Overall, if you liked the first two you will like this one. Generic but somewhat entertaining. I give it a B-.",1427587200,,952,4.236263736263736
