8512378,5,B0078UPDEI,"This was my favorite soap opera and I was extremely upset when it was cancelled.
Having DVD collections of the show has made it fun to revisit.
Thanks for having them for all of the shows fans.",1357603200,,193,4.243243243243243
8512379,4,B0078UPDEI,"Reva was not one of my favorite GL characters.  Though, I could appreciate and enjoy her character from time to time.  I particularly liked her friendship with Phillip.  With the highlight of their friendship being when they danced to ""Proud Mary"" together.

Episodes:

1) ""When Reva Came to Town"" - Reva's intro episode.  She comes off as a stereotypical gold-digger at first.  However, by the second episode on this disc, she had become a fully developed, complex character.  The episode also features the characters of:  Billy Lewis, Vanessa, Phillip, Floyd, Katie, Hillary, Kelly, Alan, Lesley Ann, Warren Andrews, Beth, Rick, Mindy, Lujack, and Annabelle.

2) The famous ""Slut of Springfield"" episode - According to a podcast interview from September 2009, the head writer, Pam Long, actually wrote Reva's fountain dialogue, herself.  Besides the famous Josh and Reva scene, there are also great scenes between:  Alex and Beth; Fletcher and Claire; Josh and Phillip; Phillip and Ross; Ross and Trish; Rick and Mindy; Alex and Warren Andrews, and H.B. and Reva.

3) The episode that ends with Reva driving off of the bridge.  Also has, early Rick Hearst as Alan-Michael Spaulding which was soon after the recast.  Besides the Reva and Josh stuff, it also has some great Roger scenes where he is the protective Daddy. The episode also features the characters of: Blake, Holly, Phillip, Beth, Samantha, Dylan, Gary Swanson, etc.

As well as 2 other episodes.",1342051200,8,1460,5.09704641350211
8512380,5,B0078UPDEI,"This is great history for Guiding Light followers. It shows the first day Reva was on, and other highlights. Actress Beverlee McKinsey was probably the other great actress on Guiding Light. I love it !",1333584000,2,201,4.771428571428571
8512381,2,B0078UPDEI,Was excited to see many of Kim Zimmer's stellar moments from Guidinglight on this new CD collection. There is very little of her on this CD even though the name of the collection is The Reva Shayne Collection. I was very disappointed. I wonder if Kim knows how little she appears on this CD.,1332460800,3,291,4.407407407407407
8512382,5,B0078UPDEI,"Kim Zimmer became a household name when she started portraying Reva Shayne on CBS' daytime soap opera ""Guiding Light"" in 1983. Created by Pamela Long Hammer (""Texas"", ""Santa Barbara"") Reva was one of the most controversial characters in serial history as she not only slept with one man from the rich Lewis family in Springfield, but with all the men in that particular family. This was way before Brooke did the same thing on ""The Bold and the Beautiful""! Part Scarlett and part Jazabel, Reva emerged as one of the show's most beloved characters and Zimmer became a daytime superstar winning multiple Emmy's for the role.

 In this beautiful single disc set viewers get a chance to watch Reva and Kim tear up the screen like no one before her.
