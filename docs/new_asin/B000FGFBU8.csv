2565292,3,B000FGFBU8,"They say all good stories are told in threes.  This is the third and final installment of Rue McClanahan's popular ""...Bride"" movies (preceeded by ""Children of the Bride"" and ""Baby of the Bride"").  The stories revolve around Margaret Becker-Hix (Rue McClanahan), her younger husband John (Ted Shackelford) and their ever-growing family.

In this finale, Margaret delights in planning the wedding of troublesome twice-divorced younger daughter Anne (Anne Bobby), who has finally decided to settle down with a decent guy.  Meanwhile, Margaret and the kids get a huge shock when her ex-husband Richard (Paul Dooley) waltzes back into town and announces he's paying for Anne's wedding!  Pretty soon, the small and intimate ceremony in the backyard is replaced by a complete reception at a luxury hotel.  But will Richard be true to his word?  And what about Mary (Kristy McNichol) and her new biker boyfriend?

MOTHER OF THE BRIDE ties up the trilogy into a neat little package, but there's still room for new stories (hint hint, Ms McClanahan and Ms McNichol!).  It's great seeing all the regular cast back together again, especially Anne Bobby, whose character of Anne definitely had the most varied and dramatic transformation during the trilogy.

The DVD from Direct Source Special Products is nicely-priced; be sure to also see the other two movies from the series, sold separately.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1202342400,8,1419,5.262222222222222
