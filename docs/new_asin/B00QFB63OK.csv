6866219,5,B00QFB63OK,Love this DVD.  A real barre class that have three different workouts.,1451952000,,70,4.833333333333333
6866220,5,B00QFB63OK,"I started using this workout regularly (2-3 times per week) about a month ago. I have gained a lot of flexibility, coordination, and long, lean muscle tone. For the past year, I have been doing Ballet Beautiful (Mary Helen Bowers) or Tracey Mallett's Booty Barre workouts 3-4 times per week, with great results. However, I found that my knees started to ache (especially with Tracey Mallett's fast-paced and squat-intensive workouts), often. Sleek Technique, however, has a gentler pace, and my muscles have definitely lengthened and strengthened. It also doesn't bother my knees (probably because of a slower pace and better form). My heart rate is up the entire time (I do the warm-up, at least 2 of the 3 barre routines, and cool down each workout), but I am not shaking afterward. I have lost inches that wouldn't leave before, and seem to have broken through a fitness & weight plateau. This induced me to order the Ballet Body Boxed Set, and I can't wait to begin.

The instructors are graceful to watch and demonstrate lovely form. The scripting is recorded and on-cue, which was odd at first (I'm used to the instructors talking as they do the movements), but after a little adjustment, I actually prefer it. I do own a barre, and would recommend one if you can afford it, as I have trouble finding a chair that is tall enough and sturdy enough for me. Overall, this is a very effective, wonderful workout.",1445644800,18,1414,4.747967479674797

6866222,5,B00QFB63OK,"Good quality production, music syncs with the moves which I find very important and not often done.  Excellent workout.  I will order more of their DVDs.",1437868800,,153,4.846153846153846
6866223,5,B00QFB63OK,Excellent barre based workout! Love it!,1430006400,2,39,5.666666666666667
6866224,5,B00QFB63OK,"Great ballet routine especially when you are short of time. The dvd offers 3 segments of 20 minutes each, plus warm up and stretches. The segments are similar yet each gives you a little variation and opportunity to work out the ballet muscles (assuming you already have some ballet training). It is not a full ballet class as you will have in a studio but the exercises are still classic ballet demonstrated by 2 amazing dancers. I love it!",1429920000,14,441,4.594936708860759
8691090,5,B00QFB63OK,"Love this barre work because very similar to barre work when I studied professionally but also easy enough for beginners which is what I feel like after so many years of not doing any barre work! Also, love the 20 minute segments and hoping to be able to do two back to back in the near future!",1489881600,,294,4.175438596491228

8691093,1,B00QFB63OK,"Please learn to teach before putting out a dvd!  The instructors had NO idea how to mirror the viewer.  People complain over and over about this sort of teaching because you hear ""lift your left foot"" but the foot they lift is to your right and a lot of people have problems processing the conflicting messages.  I can't believe that with all of the reviews out there complaining about this sort of shoddy teaching that here is yet another one. It's going in the trash.",1467936000,,469,4.4941176470588236

Bought one as a gift.",1461542400,2,82,4.928571428571429
8691096,5,B00QFB63OK,Love this workout! Haven't done ballet since I was a child and it's a perfect technical workout. I've been doing Barre and Pilates workouts 5 days a week for 4 months at home and this is a real barre workout .and a great addition to my other workouts. The girls are lovely and easy to follow. Nice low key narration and music.,1461456000,9,326,4.274193548387097
8691097,5,B00QFB63OK,"Easy to follow and I felt as though I worked many unused muscles! The ladies are both lovely to watch and to listen to. Music is good, too.",1461283200,,139,4.0
8691098,5,B00QFB63OK,"I began dancing ballet when I was just a little girl, and I was on pointe by the age of 12. I even took ballet as my exercise classes in college, but then I was diagnosed with MS, and my dancing days were over. Until NOW!!! These short ballet workouts are REALLY, TRULY, ballet moves, and the girls use the correct terms for everything. I can usually do 2 of the sections back to back. They feel wonderful, and have reawakened some muscles that have been hidden for years. I can't wait to try their 3-DVD Box Set!",1458604800,6,513,4.244897959183674
8691099,5,B00QFB63OK,"I can't say enough about this dvd,I absolutely love it.  The workouts are beautiful and challenging.  The music is breath-taking.  Nothing about it annoys me, and I can get out of bed excited to do this workout.  I have ALOT of workout videos.  I've tried Tracy Anderson, Ballet Beautiful, Beachbody workouts, Jillian Michaels, etc... They all have ended up irritating me, and after a few months I cannot stand to do them.  Not this one.  I love it, and I can actually feel that my booty is lifted a little higher each time I do it.  I wish these girls would make more!!",1454371200,12,570,4.466019417475728
