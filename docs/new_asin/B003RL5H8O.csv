8403809,5,B003RL5H8O,"Kang Hye Na, is a rude, spoiled, rich successor to the largest conglomerate company, Kang San Group. One day she meets, hard-working con-artist, Seo Dong Chan. During their encounters, incident after incident occurs and both of their lives are changed forever. Dong Chan, appointed by Hye Na's grandfather, becomes her household manager. Hye Na is furious. No longer able to live her usual extravagant, princess lifestyle, she immediately plots to get rid of him. Though they are constantly at each other throats, over time they start to develop feelings for each other. However, their feelings lead to more problems, especially when some surprising secrets are revealed.

This is a great romantic comedy. It's heartfelt and sincere at times, as well as laugh-out-loud funny. Like any good Korean drama, there are bound to be some love triangles too. Some of Korea's top stars are in this Korean drama. I suggest giving this show a try, especially if your a fan of actress, Yoon Eun Hye, who plays many lead roles in Korean dramas. (Some other dramas she stars in are: The Vineyard Man, Princess Hours, Coffee Prince, Lie to Me, I Miss You.)

(16 episodes) (Also known as ""Take Care of the Young Lady."")",1387756800,,1203,4.921182266009852
8403810,5,B003RL5H8O,This is one of the best of the Korean romantic comedies.  Yoon Sang Hyun is funny and sweet.  I love the sound of his voice whether he is singing or speaking.  The story is great and the English subs were very good.  What more could you ask for?,1360972800,,245,4.041666666666667

8403812,4,B003RL5H8O,"To be honest this is 3 1/2 stars not 4, but I like the leads so will spot them a half star.  The leads are actually good and although it does take some time to get the chemistry going it is there.  The problem is the writing.  They had a good idea of where to start and end but they got confused in that long middle part.  This should have been a direct rip-off of Shakespeare.  It's Taming of the Shrew, with less taming to be done.  Introducing the secondary love interest seems to be where they went wrong.  It watered down the story and did not really add anything.

But what works here is the acting.  Yoon Eun-hye is good here as she tries to play what should be a very unlikable character with some heart to make her likable.  Yoon Sang Hyun is good here and has to do the lion share of the work to make it through a tough script while keeping it all pieced together. Jung Il Woo does well enough but unfortunately is the character who I would find easiest to get rid of to make this work better.  I did not dislike his character but he is not really needed and I don't think the writer or director got that. Moon Chae Won is exceptional and given enough screen time to show why she is getting more work.  They all manage to keep the pacing up and keep the story moving forward.  The other supporting cast do a good job and help the leads through this.

The script and somewhat inept directing are overcome by a good cast who know their jobs.  This remains watchable and fun.",1349308800,,1482,4.169014084507042
8403813,4,B003RL5H8O,"A lot of people complain about this show, but I liked it more than a lot of other more popular K-dramas like ""My Girl"" and ""Princess Hours.""

A middle class man is hired as the butler for a rich heiress to a huge company; playful bickering and romance ensues.  This series (16 episodes, 60 minutes each) is fast-paced, highly addictive, and very entertaining.  There's a lot of charming humor and the conflicts are developed well.  All four characters are likable but the chemistry between the two leads is fantastic.  Eun-hye Yoon is perfect as the spoiled but deceptively appealing rich girl, and Sang Hyun Yoon plays off of her very naturally.  The heavier dramatic moments are restricted to a few episodes, which leaves most of the runtime to fun character interaction.  Yeah, it's definitely cliched in spots but who cares?  The production values are also very high.  Much of the series was shot in a gigantic, exquisite mansion and there are lots of beautiful, trendy dresses to gawk at.  Awesome K-drama that's unfairly criticized.",1327449600,3,1038,4.913793103448276
8403814,5,B003RL5H8O,"I was so excited to get this. Kang Hyena is a wealthy heiress. She gets in a bit of trouble with Seo Dongchan and somehow he becomes her personal butler. Things would be perfect for him, but another man comes into the picture. His name is Lee Taeyun and he is a well known human rights attorney. I won't give anything away but it is a wonderful show and I would recommend it to everyone who likes kdramas :)",1323820800,2,407,4.1645569620253164
8403815,5,B003RL5H8O,"If you like the Korean dramas, you will for sure like this one. It keeps your attention from beginning to end. The characters are charming and funny. If you like a good love story, buy this and you'll not be disappointed.

Now for the caution: Make sure it comes with four disks. Email the seller to verify this if the seller is not Amazon.",1317427200,,340,4.3125
