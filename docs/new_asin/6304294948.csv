7867353,5,6304294948,"""Unification I"" ended with Picard and Data on Romulus, where they have just found Ambassador Spock, who is not at all happy to see them.  When Picard demands an explanation, Spock explains he is on Romulus to meet with Pardek, a leader in the reunification movement that wants to see the Romulans turn away from the ways of war and joins with the pacifist Vulcans.  After all, the two races have a common ancestor.  Pardek claims that the political leadership of the Empire is changing and that the new proconsul supports these efforts.  Spock believes the time has come to make the initial overtures towards peace.  However, when Spock and Picard realize that Pardek has some hidden agenda, they are arrested by Sela, the half-Romulan daughter of Tasha Yar (""Redemption"" and ""Redemption II"", Episodes 100-101).  In the great tradition of villains everywhere, Sela explains her entire plan to her captives: The Romulans have stolen three Vulcan ships which are now on their way to Vulcan with troops.  Sela will use a holographic Spock to tell his people that the ships carry a joint peace delegation.  It seems the blonde Vulcan has her own plans for ""reunification"" of the Romulans and Vulcans.  Meanwhile, back on the Enterprise, Riker is still investigating the disappearance of the Vulcan ship T'Pau from the Qualor Two interstellar junkyard and finds evidence that strongly suggests the Romulans are involved.  Will our heroes find a way to stop the Romulan invasion force or will Spock's home world be enslaved?  (Take a guess.)
If the character of Spock only gets to interact with two members of the Enterprise crew, then Picard and Data are certainly your top two choices.  My only complaint would be that the episode does not milk the meeting of Spock and Data for all it is worth since you know it must be nice for them to have an intelligent conversation for once without having to waiting for the others to catch up.  However, there is a marvelous scene in which Spock and Data take the wind out of Sela's sails with their understated, logical approach to the situation and her dreams of grandeur.  Ultimately, it is the scenes between Spock and Picard that provide ""Unification II"" with its emotional depth.  Picard has the grim duty of informing Spock of the death of Sarek, and the final scene between the two is one of the most moving in the series.  It is amazing how emotional you can get with those Vulcans.  It is the characters that make this episode more than the action; after all, the Romulans and Vulcans achieving peaceful reunification would be like China and Taiwan deciding to merge and the idea that three Romulan ships could conquer all those peaceful Vulcans without the Federation objecting suggests the United States would just look the other way if China made a major military move across the Formosa Straits.  However, this is the Star Trek universe and not the real world.  The two parts of ""Unification"" are a splendid showcase for Leonard Nimoy and Spock, well worthy of the actor/character.",984096000,4,3031,4.839147286821706
7867354,5,6304294948,"This Part 2 of ""Unification"" .  Most Star Trek fans tend to like part 1 better but I honestly like this one much better because the Romulans are so much more interisting than the writters of the show give  them credit for.  They should have already been in one of the movies before  the Borg and especially the easily fooled Klingons.
Anyway, this episode  shifts from revolving around finding Spock to the politics of two nations:  The Romulans and the Vulcans.  Commander Sela makes a special guest  appearance which was long over due .
Hopefully we will see her as this  charactor again because this one has substance unlike the dull Tasha Yar  charactor.
Overall a fabulous episode because you actually get to see a  small peice of Romulus rather than the Klingon homeworld oe Earth.  BUY  THIS!",946857600,8,799,4.702898550724638
