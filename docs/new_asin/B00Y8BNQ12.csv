7209044,1,B00Y8BNQ12,"This was the worst kid's movie I have ever seen! My kids really enjoyed the original, so when my 3-year old begged me to get this at the store today I figured it would make for a nice family movie night. This was not the case at all. There is a lot of standing around talking at the beginning that just about put everyone to sleep. Then we were able to watch a bunch of flashbacks from the original movie. It says the film is 44 minutes but it's really only 39, so about 25 minutes of actual new movie since there are so many scenes included from the previous movie! This was a terrible rip off and makes me angry that I was tricked into buying it by the false advertising.",1441756800,,673,4.106060606060606
7209045,2,B00Y8BNQ12,"My kids enjoyed Alpha and Omega.....and so we decided we would watch A&O Family Vacation.  Well, super disappointed.  Apparently the writers decided that after 10 minutes of writing they could fill in the rest with flashbacks to the original movie.  Save your money.....you've done watched this movie if you watched the first A&O.",1441670400,2,330,5.188679245283019

7209050,3,B00Y8BNQ12,Of all the sequals to come from the Alpha and Omega movies this is my least favorite.  Mainly because like some TV episodes this is a clip show  movie with several flashbacks to previous films throughout this movie.  The story deals with Humphy and Kate starting out with the pups on a family vacation when their warned of humans trapping wolves for relocation like in the original film.  With help of family and friends they have to escape the trappers while running into several characters they've met from the first film along the way.  Each encounter sparking a memory of the past.,1438819200,,585,4.696078431372549
7209051,2,B00Y8BNQ12,"Well, here it is: The long-awaited fifth ""film"" in the incomparably weird Alpha & Omega franchise. I'll put it out in the open now: My brother and I watch these films as a joke, mainly because they're pretty fun-bad movies. We weren't expecting anything spectacular about Family Vacation, and that's exactly what we got. The animation quality comes and goes, but it looks much better than the previous incarnations of our favorite wolf family (save the first film). The sound editing was awful: the score was way too loud and and sound effects were borderline terrible.

Also, a good 35% of this movie consists of flashbacks to previous films. If you're watching this, odds are that you've seen the previous movies and have no interest in seeing those scenes outside of their film-proper. The sidekicks were unusual and unnecessary, but to be fair, bringing characters back from previous sequels shows that the creators care about their franchise. That is to be commended.

The biggest issue comes from the setup that Runt (one of the pups) has hurt his leg and will soon not be able to keep up with the family as they run from hunters. The film devotes three scenes to establishing Runt's injury and his worsening condition. When the end of the movie comes, this subplot is inexplicably abandoned in favor of nothing. The climax (SPOILER) is us merely waiting for characters to fade into existence (AKA walking out of the woods with really bad animation quality).

That all being said, there are some good laughs for bad-movie goers, especially when our heroes murder an old librarian.",1438732800,6,1586,4.888475836431227

7209072,1,B00Y8BNQ12,"Waste of money. Even my 10 yr old daughter who wanted to watch it told us how bad it was after it ended. Possibly the worst ""movie"" I've ever seen. Not only was the story line terrible, the animation was subpar.  1/3 of the movie was flash backs from the movies she had already seen. Even though it was only 3.99 I wish we could get our money back. Or at credit for another movie. Avoid if your kids will let you.",1459468800,,413,4.036585365853658
7209073,4,B00Y8BNQ12,"It was a very well movie and I love all 5 of them. However, most of the flashbacks weren't exactly needed and kinda just wasted time the movie could have had to show more action and more Humphrey and Kate.

7209076,1,B00Y8BNQ12,"My son and I love all the Alpha and Omega series but I can't say I like this one. There are too many scenes where characters remember the past events as if that's the only thing they do in this movie, and it gets really boring to those who have already watched the other episodes. And to those who haven't, it's just a spoiler. This made me think that the production company tried to make some easy money by reusing graphics that they already had or something. Really disappointed.",1454976000,,481,4.415730337078652

8717704,2,B00Y8BNQ12,"By the time this the fifth Alpha and Omega film came around (do keep in mind the 8th is about to be released at the time of this reviews writing), the crew at Crest themselves even realized things were becoming a little long in the ol wolfs tooth.  Already aware of the fact that subsequent entries to the series would be developed and released by Splash Entertainment (but still distributed by Lionsgate), they did exactly what you would expect with the last entry to wear their name: they used it as an excuse to flash viewers back to most of the moments leading up this far.

Released on August 4th, 2015, Alpha and Omega 5: Family Vacation came into being like the three movies that preceded it: a 45-minute, $5-million budgeted all-ages-friendly romp.  This one bears the distinction of being first aired on Discovery Kids in Mexico (March 28, 2015) as a made-for-TV movie. It was later released worldwide on DVD in August 4, 2015.

The setup for this one plays on the plan of Kate and Humphreys to take their pups to Alfred Creek Falls for a vacation, where, as expected, they find themselves embroiled in a cross-country chase after having been spotted by wold trappers.

Not to worry if this one sounds a little light on plot, as indicated above, the story is just the catalyst to to string together a whole bunch of recycled scenes from the previous films in the form of remenission-style flashbacks.

Given the films (or rather the series as a wholes) apparently ever-decreasing target demographic, it comes as little surprise that the final entry from Crest Animation is little more than a thinly-disguised rehash.  Theres little here to celebrate or criticize; in fact if you own or have access to the films leading up to this one, youve seen the majority of the content here already.  What is fresh, while in no danger of threatening National Lampoons dominance on the subject matter, pokes fun of the dynamic of traveling cross country with the kids.  Adults may find the occasional chuckle here.

All in all, the trend of Alpha and Omega turning less a runaway theatrical success and more a made-for-TV series continues right on schedule with this entry.  Though not as original or adventurous as Legend of the Saw Tooth Cave, it does manage to succeed over The Great Wolf Games in terms of its comedic nature and pacing.  Younger audiences may not tire with the material quite as quickly as adults (especially adults who have recently seen the earlier entries of the series) but its a bit of a stretch to insinuate that Crest went out with a bang on the franchise they were so instrumental in developing from the onset.

For better or worse, the franchise would be handed over to Splash Animation after this one and while in no danger of ever being considered a narrative (or animated) masterpiece, it does serve as a fairly consistent bookend to the Crest era at the helm.  Even if you're already quite familiar with many of the chapters within this book.",1486771200,,2972,4.712355212355212
