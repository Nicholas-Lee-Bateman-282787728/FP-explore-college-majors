7026249,5,B00TZ6QA0Y,Ordered 1 episode - 'If You Give a Mouse a Cookie' because it's one of my daughter's favorite books and she LOVES Reading Rainbow. This is a great episode and really fun for little kids if you are trying to introduce them to RR.,1438473600,,228,4.204545454545454

7026251,5,B00TZ6QA0Y,Wonderful learning experience for adults and children. It reminds me when I was in grade school when we had a rainy day and had to come inside and watch educational films. My grandchildren love it as well as the books.,1432425600,,218,4.475

8703443,1,B00TZ6QA0Y,"Was disappointed. Was more of overview of books. Not a video, my grandson, age 22 months loves If you give a mouse a cookie, disappointing Easter gift.",1492300800,,151,4.62962962962963
8703444,5,B00TZ6QA0Y,"I loved this show while I was growing up.  Such nostalgia!

 The original theme song was epic but it looks like they replaced all the episodes with the new one (from 2000)--which is not as awesome.

The season's episodes are all mixed up too.  For instance season 1 has shows from '93, '95, '04 and '05.  Crazy.

You have to hunt around for all the episodes from the 80's.  The clothing from that era is entertaining!

LaVar Burton is such an enthusiastic host and it seems to come from a time when public television actually helped children learn new things.  Sharing the excitement with my children now is really fun!",1491264000,3,619,4.545454545454546
8703445,5,B00TZ6QA0Y,This is so nice and really cool for me. I find this educational for kids. This is a must watch film.,1489104000,,100,3.8095238095238093

8703447,5,B00TZ6QA0Y,"I have lost count the number of times my son has asked to watch this.  He is so fascinated by the episode ""if you give the mouse a cookie"" but not because of the story.  If you remember watching any of the reading rainbows as a kid you will remember those segments before the books.  There is one here on bowling.  It gives a behind the scene look at where the ball goes after you throw it down the lane.  It also shows how bowling balls are made.  My  4 year old son thinks this bowling segment is the coolest thing ever.  There is also a segment on dominoes that has gotten my son interested in setting up his own layout.  I originally got this DVD for the story but I forgot how interesting and educational the segments in-between the stories really are.  I am so glad I decided to buy this!",1474156800,8,794,4.1644736842105265
8703448,5,B00TZ6QA0Y,"Great DVD!  Picked it up after one day I was asking my wife for advice on a situation at work, and she said, Well you know if you give a mouse a cookie

I looked at her befuttled and admitted I had never heard that phrase. She replied  he will ask for a glass of milk  you really need to read more.

A few days later I saw this DVD at the store and had to have it to see how the story goes.

This is a great Disk with 4 Episodes:

Chain Reactions  If You Give a Mouse a Cookie
Composting  Two Old Potatoes and Me
Growing Up  Owen
And You are never too Old to Learn  Mr. George Baker

The field Trips in these episodes include: A Bowling Alley & Brunswick Bowling Ball Factory, A Domino Artist, A New York Family Bakery, A group of Retiree Dancers called the Steppers, and a couple amazingly cheesy flashback to LeVar Burtons childhood.  While I bought the DVD for me; my boys (4 & 2) love it.

I highly recommend it, too!",1470441600,3,921,4.016574585635359
