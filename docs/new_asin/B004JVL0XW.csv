8432009,5,B004JVL0XW,"When I first went to massage school, I fell in love with massage as a way of helping people.  I was passionate about many different styles and took various trainings.  Consequently I have over 30 massage DVDs including Volume 1 and 2 DVDs from Sacred Lomi.  They are one of the best massage DVDs that I own.  First of all, this style of massage is the ultimate to receive AND to give.  Taking a class from Tom and Donna will transform your practice.  Secondly, the DVDs are beautiful and will surely entice you to attend one of their trainings where you will have a head start in absorbing this style.  Once you have taken the class and have a basis of understanding, the DVDs provide plenty of details to refresh your memory.  I highly recommend these DVDs as well as taking their trainings.  I treated myself to massage training in Hawaii and it was like an amazing vacation where I received so much more than just massage training.  It changed my life.",1386028800,,955,4.5
8432010,3,B004JVL0XW,"This is a good DVD and I would recommend it all MT's.  The techniques are broken down into easy to follow steps and Tom Cochran is a good instructor.  The reason why I couldn't give it more than three stars is there just isn't very much on it.  The information on this DVD was top notch but there wasn't much of it. I don't believe that the amount of content on this DVD justifies it's price.  It did have some runs that I have not seen in other DVD's but most of them are the runs that you see on most temple style Lomi Lomi DVDs, that have more content for pretty much the same price.  Overall I don't regret buying this DVD and I don't think you will either but there are better DVDs with more content on them, that cost pretty much the same.",1384214400,,745,4.075342465753424
8432011,5,B004JVL0XW,"Actually, as a result of viewing this DVD, I signed up for Sacred Lomi training several years ago.  Many trainings later, I still refer back to this DVD. For anyone interested in Hawaiian Temple Bodywork, this DVD demonstrates by showing the Sacred Lomi process, run by run.  Against a backdrop of great respect for ancient tradition, ritual movement, and intention, the DVD incorporates simple, concise instruction for each stroke used on the back of the body.  This is followed by weaving the ""runs"" together, creating a flow.  The clarity, honor, and simplicity really sets this presentation apart from many other ""how-to"" videos on my bookshelf.",1318291200,,649,5.152380952380953
8432012,5,B004JVL0XW,"This is a very informative and detailed training DVD. Tom demonstrates with passion and intuition.
Well worth the money spent.  Aloha Kristina.",1317772800,,143,5.5
8432013,5,B004JVL0XW,"I bought this DVD after ""happening"" into the Sacred Lomi trainings in Hawaii.  I am a licensed massage therapist (for over 20 years) and wanted to recall the technical aspects of the ""runs"" on the body.  However, once you have experienced this bodywork, you will know that the heart and soul are also invited into this healing space.  The DVD also helps to remind you about the heart and spirit aspects of what is being done and the culture that provides this avenue of healing.  If you buy this DVD, count on going to at least one of the trainings to experience this work fully.  If you are a massage therapist, there are wonderful ""strokes"" to steal!  If you are a healer, there is much to draw you further in training.  If you are a discerning client, you may discover a new world of well-being and healing.

8432014,5,B004JVL0XW,"I first viewed this DVD when I was considering attending a workshop on Sacred Lomi. Just watching the demonstration relaxed me so well I slept all night afterward. I have since attended workshops, and find this dvd a great review resource. It is well done and beautifully presented.",1317600000,,282,4.895833333333333
8432015,5,B004JVL0XW,"Having first taken a Lomi Lomi workshop from Tom, I found this DVD an indispensable learning aid to assist in the practice of this modality.  It re awakens the sacred spirit in which the art of Lomi Lomi was created with  emphasis on heart centered massage.  I recommend this DVD highly along with the sequel Vol 11",1317600000,,315,4.491228070175438
8432016,5,B004JVL0XW,"As a massage instructor, and massage therapist for over 15 years, this is an excellent DVD, both for its production value, and its educational value.  I use this DVD to introduce my massage students to this modality, and it clearly introduces the modality, its history, and what it is.  As a Sacred Lomi practioner I find the DVD invaluable as a learning tool, to help when I sometimes forget! I recommend this to all of those interested in Hawaiian culture, and massage therapy.",1317513600,,479,4.759036144578313
8432017,5,B004JVL0XW,"It is difficult to put into words what this body work means to me,and what it means to so many others who have experienced it. I am a facilitator of this work and I have to tell you that it is by far my favorite ""modality"" to give and to receive. Tom and his wife Donna are exceptional teachers,gifted,heart centered and VERY Pono in the work they do. They will even tell you that the DVD's cannot replace actual instruction from a workshop,but from these DVD's one can gain much in the techniques taught and the method and manner in which they are presented in this format. These are beautiful DVD's that will convey to you just how powerful
 And transformational this work is. So you can learn much from them. I highly recommend this series including ""the back of the body"" and ""the front of the body"". Be sure to attend a workshop from these teachers as they travel all over the country and Hawaii. You don't have to be a massage therapist to take the workshops,you just need to have an open heart,a caring mind,and a willing body.

Much love and as they say in Hawaii ""Aloha Nui Loa""""!!!!!",1317513600,,1093,4.432835820895522
8432018,5,B004JVL0XW,"Sacred Lomi is bodywork that supports spiritual experience. I cannot recommend these beautifully produced DVD's of Sacred Lomi instruction highly enough. Drenched in the spirit of aloha, they are just what any dedicated practitioner of Sacred Lomi (with a less than photographic memory) needs to hone her practice. I know, because that's exactly how I use them. The instruction is clear and thorough, giving all the information needed to begin the physical practice of Sacred Lomi. But this is heart work, and the practitioner really must experience the work, the lineage, and share with ohana (the family of practitioners). So get the DVD's, start practicing with a dear (and lucky) friend, and book yourself into one of Tom and Donna's Sacred Lomi workshops across the country.",1296000000,2,779,5.190476190476191
