Be careful for false review such as ""A fan"" He's obviously and evolutionist who keeps posting the same lies and two star rating on all of Dr. Hovinds products. It just shows what kind of people the evolution theory makes people to be. I guess it's ok to lie though since there's no God huh...? What a joke.. I loved Dr. Hovinds products and I know you will too.",1459728000,,409,4.324675324675325
8570776,5,B000B7DK54,Dr. Kent Hovind knows what he is teaching and this is an excellent movie to watch! He has lots of information. He explains many things that you may have never known were lies in your childrens text books at school. Make sure your children know the truth before teachers fill there minds with lies! Dr. Kent Hovind's movies have been very beneficial in understanding the truth about Science.,1315008000,3,390,4.75
