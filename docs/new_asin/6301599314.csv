it is definitely not for children, don't expect anthing like the disney one, u will have a hard time figuring out why it is called sleeping beauty!! half of the episode involves a woodsman telling a story..they're trying to be funny but they're not..

I found myself fast forwarding through most of it.",1112918400,2,453,4.512195121951219
340682,1,6301599314,"I ordered this dvd along with the dancing princesses.  My daughters love fairy tales and knew both stories well.  They love the dancing princesses.  We only got 20 minutes into this one before we turned it off.  (and it was a long 20 minutes!) This version of sleeping beauty is full of sexual innuendo.  Furthermore, the story is hard to follow and boring.  It is nothing like the Disney movie or the fairy tale book version.  Don't waste your money.  Buy the dancing princesses instead!",1104105600,2,488,4.658823529411765
340683,4,6301599314,"SLEEPING BEAUTY is one of the earliest episodes in the FAERIE TALE THEATRE series.  The production values are lavish and the costumes heavenly.  Beverly d'Angelo and Bernadette Peters lead a strong cast.

The story recounts a childless king and queen (played by Sally Kellerman and Rene Auberjonois) who are finally blessed with a child after receiving some helpful advice from a fairy.  At the child's christening, all the fairies are invited to bestow gifts upon the little princess.  However, the wicked Henbane (Beverly d'Angelo) gets left off the list and gatecrashes the event, cursing the princess to a premature death from a spindle-prick.  Kindly good fairy Cookie (Carol Kane) remedies the curse by changing a few details: the princess won't die, only sleep until woken by the kiss of a true Prince.

Utterly enchanting.  Christopher Reeve is perfect as the Prince, with the cast also including Ron Rifkin and George Dzundra.  Beverly d'Angelo is hilarious as the addled Henbane and Bernadette Peters is an ideal princess (she even gets to sing!).",1097193600,14,1057,5.1345029239766085
340684,5,6301599314,"After years of waiting, Faerie Tale Theatre fans can finally own the series on DVD. Shelley Duvall's series originally appeared on Showtime 20 years ago and featured well-known and rising stars of the time. The series' enthusiastic interpretations of beloved fairy tales has made it a cult classic. Better yet, the DVD prices are affordable, especially after the high prices the used VHS copies have been earning in recent years.

About this episode:

The classic tale of Sleeping Beauty, expanded with comical touches.

Cast:

Bernadette Peters .... Sleeping Beauty

Christopher Reeve.... The Prince

340685,5,6301599314,"Another one of my favorite films in the Faerie Tale Theatre series.  Christopher Reeve plays the galliant prince who loves listening to a good story or two.  Bernadette Peters plays the beautiful and graceful princess.  Carol Kane plays a very whimsical good fairy.  And watch out for Beverly DeAngelo as the wicked fairy Henbaine.  She really used to scare me when I was little especially as the fire breathing dragon.  A very interesting scene in the film.  The special effects are intriguing.  Although, I feel the plot is slowed down by a few unnecessary segments, I still love this movie and would recommend it to absolutely everyone!!! A+",1086480000,2,644,4.898148148148148
340686,5,6301599314,"Charming and obviously one of the funniest episodes from Faerie Tale Theatre, this is the classic tale of a beauty who was cast into a spell of a deep sleep and a prince must come to kiss her in order to wake her and the rest of the kingdom. Bernadette Peters and Christopher Reeve are absolutely amazing in their roles and have excellent chemistry. Beverly D'Angelo was equally impressive as the wicked Henbane. The script is filled with hilarious one-liners and situations. A great episode.",1076457600,2,492,4.8
340687,5,6301599314,"Faerie tale theatre has lots of wonderful shows with great actors, but my favorite is this one.  Christopher Reeves and Burnedette Peters are wanderful actors that bring the tale of Sleeping Beauty to life.  If you never watched one of Shelly Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre collections, I highly recommend watching them all.",1044576000,2,322,5.173076923076923
340688,2,6301599314,"I was very disappointed with this movie. I've enjoyed many others from the Faerie Tale Theatre collection, so I was expecting to be more like the others. It was not very romantic or uplifting, as I expected Sleeping Beauty to be. It was comical, but were a couple parts that had sexual inuendos (sp?) and I would have been embarrassed if I had watched this for the first time with family or friends. I bought this movie thinking it would be a cute, romantic fairy tale that my family and I would enjoy. But I don't know if I even want my young children to watch it. Overall, it was okay, but did not at all meet my expectations.",988243200,3,628,4.285714285714286

I can't pinpoint exactly what's wrong with the Faerie Tale Theatre adaptation of ""Sleeping Beauty,"" but it's several little things that punch big holes in a would-be watertight boat.  For starters, although casting is strong, including Bernadette Peters, Christopher Reeve, and Beverly D'Angelo, there are too many cutesy side elements that detract from the momentum of the story.

An absolutely needless framing device opens the story; a woodsman telling the tale to a prince, played by Christopher Reeve, and his attendant.  When the action properly opens, Carol Kane's good fairy who bestows the saving blessing on the princess is so insipid the viewer wants to rush through her scenes.  The show earns positive points on a nice, atmospheric set and a very strong villainess.  The witch Henbane is excellently played by Beverly D'Angelo, and her huge snake lady at the climactic battle puts even Maleficent's dragon to shame for sheer ugly fearsomeness.

I want to like this more, but it has too many competing elements tearing it apart.  Nevertheless, it still manages to be mildly entertaining.",1271462400,,1116,5.230337078651686
