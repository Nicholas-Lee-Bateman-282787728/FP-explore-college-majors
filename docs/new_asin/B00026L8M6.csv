8023066,5,B00026L8M6,"Leisa Hart's CORE BAR is the best weight training tool i have, it's adjustable, easy to adjust in a snap, that a screw on piece like Gaimm's or the other pilates bar; this is great, you can change the weight level depending on what exercise you are doing, and you don't waste time, it's awesome, i have several Body Bars and this is better quality, easily better. I Highly Recommend the Core Bar, and loved Leisa's great exercises in the Fit To The Core Series.",1102118400,4,461,4.435294117647059
