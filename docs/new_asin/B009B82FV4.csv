JONES VS BELFORT

This was the event after the lost event thanks to one half of the main event on this card. For those who don't know Jon Joes was set to defend his title against Dan Henderson at UFC 151. But after Dan had to pull out due to an injury the door was left open for a replacement to fight Jones. From what was said by Dana White no one in the Light-Heavyweight division wanted to take on Jones on short notice. So the very vocal Chael Sonnen said he would come up from the Middleweight division to fight Jones, Jones refused. He said he could not take on Sonnen on short notice. Funny thing is that he agreed to take on Vitor Belfort at this event who like Cheal was coming up from Middleweight and was injured. But on a great note this event would also see the debut of a new title, the Flyweight belt which is at 125 pounds.

Spoilers

1. CUB SWANSON VS CHARLES OLIVEIRA-the first fight of the night on the main card was one that we were all waiting for. Both guys had been looking good so we knew this was going to be great. The fight starts out with Charles looking for and getting the take down. It would not take long though for Cub to get back up. From there Cub would land some great body shots on his way to knocking Oliveira out. It was a crazy KO as well as he walks back at first and then his legs give out. Nice win for Cub.

2. MATT HAMIL VS ROGER HOLLETT-Matt Hamil is the UFCs only deaf fighter who had retired a year before only to return this night. This was another fight we were excited for since The Hammer 2 was coming back after that year off. The first round was a bit of a feeling out process until Hamil got the take down and landed blow after blow on the ground. But to Rogers credit he got back and started to land himself. The second round looked like the first along with Hamil getting the takedown. But Hamil was a bit slow in this round as it seemed he gassed a little bit after the first. The third round was all Hamil really after he reputedly took Hollett down, a UD win for the returning Hamil.

3. MICHAEL BISPING VS BRIAN STANN-when this fight was announced we could not wait to see Bisping get knocked out by the former Marine. So like the other two we were excited for this one. So the first round starts off with Bisping getting Stann against the cage since he did not want to feel Stanns power. But once they get off the cage it becomes a bit more of a boxing match with Bisping attempting another take down and trip. From that point they both trade not only cup checks but exchanges. Stann mixed in some great leg kicks throughout and landed a big right hand towards the end, Stann in a close round one. The second round sees Bisping get a big takedown at the beginning only for Stann to end up on top. When they make it back to their feet and get off the cage Bisping seems to be landing more as his jab is on point. Towards the end he slams Stann down again to take the round. In the third Bisping keeps to what was working the in second. Working for takedowns and using crisp technique in his boxing. Stann turns it up in the end but not enough to win, UD win for Bisping.

4.[FLYWEIGHT TITLE]JOSEPH BENAVIDEZ VS DEMETRIOUS JOHNSON-now it was time for the first ever Flyweight championship, history baby. The little guys always put on a show and never get tired so the action is always fast paced. The first round is very much what I just described with all kinds of foot work and quick shots at each other. It is a close round but I think Johnson landed just a little more and ended up on top in the last few seconds to take the round in my opinion. The second round is just as exciting with both guys moving in and out of range of each other. It is a close round with Joseph landing some shots at the end that may have won him the round. The third follows suit but even though he gets taken down for less than a second I think Johnson took the round. The next round takes things to an even higher level as Joseph lands a huge punch that drops Johnson. Afterwards Joseph gets so close to choking Johnson out only for Johnson to attack the leg and eventually getting back up. Johnson goes on to end up on top three times and finishes the round there giving him the round. It is insane how quick these guys are and their technique is just so good. In the final round Johnson gets some takedowns which seals the fight for him as he becomes the first ever UFC Flyweight Champion.

5.[LIGHT-HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE]JON JONES VS VITOR BELFORT-ah yes the fight everyone was waiting for. Everyone wanted the old school to reign supreme here as Vitor was moving up in weight to take on Jones. I cannot tell you how bad I was waiting for Vitor to knock Jones out. Now Belfort was fighting hurt here which played in to his performance since he could spring like he normally does. But anyway Jones comes out and gets the takedown early only for Vitor to almost pull off the big win as he locks in a deep armbar. The world stood still as that happened. To Joness credit he fought threw it. The rest of the round was all Jones as he was on top and even cut Vitor open with an elbow. The second round had Jones landing more often than Belfort and at one point Vitor pulls guard, very odd for him. Vitor gets hurt in the third from a front leg side kick and pulls guard once again late in the round, another round for Jones. Vitor comes out stronger at the beginning of the fourth only to end up on bottom on the ground. Once there Jones gets side control traps an arm and sinks in an Americana.

DISC 2

1. KYLE NOKE VS CHARLIE BRENNEMAN-the first fight ends in the first round as these two do battle. The fight ends as Charlie jumps in only to eat a big right hand that drops him. Once down Noke is all over him and the ref jumps in to call it. It may be a bit early depending on how you see it but that is a TKO victory for Noke at 45 seconds.

2. MITCH GAGNON VS WALEL WATSON-this like the first ends in the first and is a great finish for Mitch. He moves out of the way of a superman punch and lands a big left hook dropping Walel. From there he jumps all over him eventually taking his back and sinks in the rear naked choke getting the win.

3. SETH BACZYNSKI VS SIMEON THORESEN-good first round for these two as the go back and forth in a good fight that once again ends in the first. After an unintentional eye poke that Simeon eats he gets knocked out cold by a well placed left hook by Seth.

4. JIMY HETTES VS MARCUS BRIMAGE-great first round here in the first fight to make it to another round. These guys go at it just throwing power punches and bunches trying to end it. The second round is a big one for Hettes after they trade blows he gets it to the ground and almost ends it multiple times. The third round is a big one for Marcus as he just lands big shot after big shot. Add in the leg kicks he lands and the round was certainly his which gives him the 29-28 UD win.

5. SEAN PIERSON VS LANCE BENOIST-great first round here with Sean coming hard and dropping Lance early. But Benoist stays aware and keeps the fight going attempting armbars and umaplatas. The battle continues as Sean wobbles  Benoist but the round ends with both still standing. The stand up battle continues into the second with both guys landing and being contested very little on the ground. The pace slows just a little in third but both guys trade turning it up at times with their hands. Towards the end Lance lands a big shot that stuns Sean but it is not enough as Pierson gets the UD.

6. TJ GRANT VS EVAN DUNHAM-excellent opening round in this fight with both guys daring the other to just keep coming full force and swinging. Great shots landed by both but no man falls. Towards the end Evan lands a takedown that may have won him the round. Another great stand up war in the second that even draws blood a big knee cuts Dunham open. They continue to trade blows landing big shots and working a quick pace until Evan scores another takedown. Another great round takes place in the third round with hands and kicks a plenty. Of course Evan gets another takedown towards the end that gives him the UD, or so we thought. When it went to the judges TJ Grant actually gets the UD for landing more I assume.

7. IGOR POKRAJAC VS VINNY MAGALHAES-this fight goes to the ground pretty early on as Vinny gets Igor down and eventually works to side control. From there he goes for the armbar but has to let it go eventually landing Igor on top. The second round makes its way to the ground again this time with Igor on top but Vinny tries to set up the triangle. He cant really get it and switches to the armbar and flips him with it, from there Igor has to tap.

8539135,5,B009B82FV4,The only other good thing about getting two title fights is seeing a card that's fun to watch. This was a fun show to watch from top to bottom and well worth the money spent to watch.,1361145600,,183,3.972972972972973
8539136,2,B009B82FV4,"Mixed Martial Arts from 2001-2005 was a very special time and place to be a part of.

But no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time in the world. Whatever it meant. There were remarkable Pay-per-Views in any direction, at any hour. You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever the Pride nuthuggers were doing was right, that we were winning.

And that, I think, was the handle - that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of old and evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn't need that. Our energy would simply prevail. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. So now, less than ten years later, you can go up to a steep hill in Las Vegas and look North to the Air Canada Center in Toronto, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark - that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.

UFC 152 had two bags of Jon Jones vs. Vitor Belfort, seventy-five pellets of Michael Bisping vs. Brian Stann, five sheets of high-powered Matt Hamill, an opening bout half-full of Cub Swanson, and a whole galaxy of TJ Grants, Evan Dunhams, Sean Piersons, Roger Holletts... Also, a prelim show of Charlie Brenneman, Marcus Brimage, Lance Benoist, Jimmy Hettes. Not that Zuffa needed all that for the show, but once you get locked into a serious point fighting collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.

The only thing that really worried me was Demetrius Johnson vs. Joseph Benavidez. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a couple of 125 pound men in the depths of a point fighting binge.

...and I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.

We were all wired into a survival trip. No more of the real fighting that fueled the Pride FC. That was the fatal flaw in Dana White's trip. He crashed around America selling ""UFC expansion"" without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all the TUF noobs who took him seriously... All those pathetically eager freaks who thought they could buy mainstream acceptance for $50 bucks a PPV. But their loss and failure is ours too. What Dana took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped create... a generation of permanent shills, failed noobs, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of MMA culture: the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force - is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.",1353628800,3,2623,4.5702127659574465
8539137,3,B009B82FV4,"UFC 152 was a tricky event for several reasons, the first being that UFC 151 was cancelled after Dan Henderson was injured in training two weeks before his fight with Jon Jones.  Initially talks of Lyoto Machida replacing Henderson were speculated but then those rumors were dismissed.  Chael Sonnen had put his name forth as a replacement for Henderson but those plans were cut short very quickly.  After that news broke out it felt like another batch of bad news broke out when it was publicly released that the entire event had been cancelled.  There are already so many things that have been said on this so I'm going to skip over that.  So, to fix up this jumble Jon Jones was then scheduled to headline UFC 152 with Vitor Belfort.  With plans finalized it looked like UFC 152 was going to be a stacked card with a lot to offer.

Things started off in an odd way.  Cub Swanson is good featherweight to keep track of because his fights are typically pretty exciting.  He doesn't mind going to war with another fighter and that involves some bumps and bruises on his end but I have come to respect his style as a fan.  His opponent, Charles Oliveira, once fought at the lightweight class but after a few bumps he chose to drop weight and has found success.  The reason that this is tricky is that Oliveira was unable to get to the weight limit.  A tough weight cut is indicative of a tough conditioning, and that can make a rough performance for a fighter in later rounds.  Luckily, this is not the case in this fight.  I'm glad to see that this was a fast pace fight, while it lasted.  Shots were thrown and eventually the finish came about although it may take watching the replay to entirely understand the ending.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Matt ""The Hammer"" Hamill.  Watching him on ""The Ultimate Fighter"" I can pretty much say that it would be hard for anyone not to root for him.  He retired late last year after a pretty successful career in the UFC and had dropped off the radar until his fight at this event where he stated that he was coming out of retirement.  Roger Hollett was his opponent and this was Hollett's debut in the UFC so it's hard to say what kind of fighter he is.  Unfortunately, this was not a good fight for either man.  They both looked hesitant, unable to pull the gun, and their conditioning was horrible.  This was a pretty painful match to watch, as a fan of Hamill or not.

Strangely enough, on a card stacked with some pretty important fights, this was the fight I looked forward to the most.  Michael Bisping has long been considered one of the best middleweights in the world but has been stopped just short of number one contendership on a few of occasions.  His tenacity to fight the best in the world is pretty well documented as he's always been eager for that eluding title shot.  The opponent, Brian Stann, was also in a similar situation.  Many people thought of Stann as a darkhouse in the division as he was slowly beating all of his opponents in pretty impressive fashion.  Then he hit a wall in the form of Chael Sonnen.  Since then he bounced back with an impressive finish of Alessio Sakara and was looking to make the same kind of impression on Bisping.  I thought the way their styles would clash together would have made for a really fun fight but it came down to one fighter looking for the ""big shot"" after getting a lucky clip but never quite finding that shot.  The victor had all the right tools to win this fight and utilized them well but it was not overly exciting. It was not an impressive win but given the circumstances of how good both fighters are it should be considered a pretty decent victory.

It's really strange to think that when you're watching a fight it's history in the making. Joseph Benavidez and Demetrious Johnson were fighting for the first UFC Flyweight title.  After a strange journey to this point this was the night.  Benavidez has fought for the Bantamweight title twice, each time losing to Dominic Cruz.  Strangely enough, for a man who is a natural 125 fighter he has always looked pretty strong at 135, but think of BJ Penn going up to 170 throughout his career.  He's a strong wrestler with some pretty impressive power and as a former 135 fighter is noted for his impressive speed and conditioning.  Demetrious Johnson is a bit of a different fighter.  He's also a wrestler but unlike Benavidez his speed is something else.  He doesn't posses the same kind of power but what he lacks in that department he makes up for in technique and just damn impressive speed (watch his fight with Dominic Cruz and for the few moments where he's able to shine I think you'll see what I'm talking about).  The fight had the kind of pace I think most people would expect out of the lower weight classes but something felt amiss in this fight.  I understood how big this fight was and from a technical standpoint it's a fun fight to watch, well, at least until the last round, but that's just because I personally felt there was no question in who the victor was.  For those of you who watch this I'm not saying it's a bad fight but it's not a classic in my eyes.

Now came the moment of truth, would Jon Jones successfully defend his title against Vitor Belfort, or would ""The Phenom"" capture lighting in a bottle and dethrone the Light-Heavyweight King from his place on top the mountain?  It should be noted that many people did not given Belfort a shot in hell.  He's a natural middleweight and he was coming up in weight against arguably the biggest Light-Heavyweight in history and while most people love to witness an underdog victory most of the fans just did not see Belfort coming out of this fight with the championship.  In all honesty, it's one of those situations where Belfort had nothing to lose, and everything to win.  Here's the thing I can say about this fight, each fighter looked very strong and I'm most definitely glad that I can say that given my feelings coming into this fight.  It's really hard to say anything about this fight without spoiling anything but I'll leave it at this: the victor implemented a very good game plan with the loser looking strong in the face of a damn good performance.

Overall, this event had a lot of hype coming in and while I would like to say the event lived up to it I personally feel that it did not.  I enjoyed a few moments throughout the night but for the most part I'd say that not one fight really can save the card as a whole but this is most likely me being over-critical.",1353196800,4,6534,4.445004198152812
