434297,4,6302180155,"Greenaway's work is not something I can be objective about.  I either love his films or loathe them.  ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"" made me want to toss my television set out the window, but I spent years trying to track down a copy of ""The Draughtsman's Contract"" because I loved it so much.
Surely one of the strangest films in my collection, TDC requires a lot of attention.  You need your eyes and ears open and your wits about you in every sense of the word, because a sense of humor is critical here.  The characters are unlikeable, but compelling, the action artificial and the storyline murky.  The clues you need to solve the mystery of what has happened to Mr. Herbert, and who is responsible are there, but you have to work with them.  Nothing is obvious here.
The performances are wonderful, cool and formal as the drawings around which the story revolves.  The scenes are set pieces, remarkably lit and costumed to give a very visceral sense of time and place.  Greenaway's background in art comes through very strongly here as it does in ""Pillow Book"" (another of my favorites) giving the film a lot of depth and beauty.
So that's it, my wholly subjective opinion, presented for what it's worth.",1001203200,11,1225,4.587155963302752
434298,5,6302180155,"I get goosebumps and heart palpitations when watching a Greenanway film, while my friends fall asleep or walk out (though I didn't care much for Pillow Book or 8.5 Women). This one still gives me the biggest rush. I've always found Higgins' performance mezmerizing.
But the thing that's always gotten me about DC was it's absolute bravado and might. Completely uncompromising in every way in order to get to that higher level that creates a meaningful experience., but without the vile exclusionary feel that makes you wonder if the creators just hate audiences.
And of course that's a big point, because Greenaway gets extremely close sometimes to just that. I would like to believe that he in fact respects his audience deeply, and finds it important to challenge us in ways that excite and entice, and not merely leaving us with a sense that we've merely been preached to.
Or maybe I'm just completely nuts.",991958400,4,910,4.877419354838709
434299,4,6302180155,"Peter Greenaway may be the last indisputably distinctive Anglophone filmmaker. With ""The Draughtsman's Contract,"" he broke through from relative obscurity as an experimental artist into feature-length narratives. While his subsequent films have been more conservative than his earlier work, he remains a highly original and innovative artist. ""Contract"" may be his most balanced film, integrating much of his earlier formal experimentation with the demands of narrative.
Greenaway is just about the only well-known filmmaker with an interest in the art and film theory of the past thirty-five years. His is a ""meta-cinema,"" at least as much about the act of making and watching movies as about particular situations. Summarizing the story of ""The Draughtsman's Contract,"" for example, gives only a limited sense of what watching the movie is like. As some of the reviews here have pointed out, you cannot watch ""Contract"" without noticing the perspective tools used by Mr. Neville. These technologies anticipate the optics used in photography and cinematography. As we are aware of how they contribute to 17th century draftsmanship we (in theory at least) recognize the construction of the very images we are viewing. In short, through these and other techniques, you are too aware of experiencing the film to become engrossed in it.
If you are not comfortable with such distancing, ""The Draughtsman's Contract"" may not be your cup of tea. On the other hand, there is certainly ""much to be applauded"" in ""The Draughtsman's Contract."" As in virtually all of Greenaway's work, the visual design and cinematography are exquisite and all the more remarkable given the film was shot in 16mm. The actors obviously relish the chance to make the film's baroque dialogue compelling, lively, believable as everyday speech. (Incidentally, fans of the British ""Poirot"" series should get a chuckle out of Hugh Fraser's snide, arch, thoroughly unpleasant Mr. Talmann. It's almost impossible to believe that under the wigs and layers of linen and between the pauses in a viscous German accent is Poirot's amiable poodle, Captain Hastings.) ""Contract"" was also as much a breakthrough for Greenaway's favorite composer, Michael Nyman, as it was for the director. The score's Purcellian themes and arrangements are a little a-typical for the composer, however.
If you are familiar with the film or Greenaway's other work, you should be aware that the transfer is adequate without being stunning. While matted for widescreen, the disc is not 16:9 enhanced, which is a pity. Blown up to fill a widescreen TV, the grain gets a bit noticeable. I recommend viewing the disc in matted 4:3 mode. If you have never seen a Greenaway film, ""The Draughtsman's Contract"" makes an excellent introduction to the intricacies and paradoxes of his thematically and sensually rich cinema.",989625600,21,2852,5.298013245033113

Although other reviewers point out that the weather is too good to be true, and the wigs bigger than life, I found the filming gorgeous. The candlelight evening scene gave me a real idea of what living without electricity was like.  (I know that's kind of a mundane remark, but so many other period films show brightly lit rooms; there must have been shadows and wavering lights.)  The end, though, revolted me, which is a tribute to Greenaway 'cause I can watch Terminator and action films without getting shocked by death.  Scenes from this movie come back to my mind frequently over the years.  I appreciate all the reviews on IMDB and Amazon (and the link--that's great), as this movie has haunted me for years, and I appreciate any hints.

434301,5,6302180155,"This beautifully shot, highly intelligent, somewhat surreal and shockingly unknown film was originally made by Peter Greenaway for the opening night of Channel Four Television in Britain, and represents, perhaps, the man at his peak. The story, which avoids any direct explanations of itself or its plot, centres around a draughtsman (Higgins) who is hired to produce twelve drawings of a stately home in England. While he draws, objects appear in the landscape around him, which he includes in his drawings... when a body finally surfaces, do the drawings contain evidence concerning the identities of its murderers, or has some clever person purposely placed the objects in order to frame someone else... possibly the draughtsman himself? One may watch the film many times, each time coming up with a different answer; the motives and dialogue contradict each other just enough to add to the mystery, but not enough to ruin any possible explanation. The sountrack (by Michael Nyman) is also interesting: the themes within it are based on eight-bar samples of Mozart which are repeated and improvised upon, to hypnotising and evocative effect. A fascinating film.",971481600,29,1164,5.263440860215054

...and open your knees!""
So says the dastardly Mr Neville, the epitome of the self-made 17th Century Englishman in Peter Greenaway's sumptious 'Draughtman's Contract', the contract in question being one of a sexual nature;  Mr Neville agrees to sketch the financially embarrassed Mrs Herbert's house and gardens in return for twelve sexual favours from his reluctant employer.
Yet what begins as a simple story of a sado masochistic relationship unravels into a perlexing jigsaw puzzle of a film where nothing is as it first appears, our affections switching from one character to another as we (as well as THEY) try to figure out exactly what is afoot in Mrs Herbert's beautiful garden.
A film about perception, art, sex, age, gender, 17th Century British politics, murder, love (and pineapples!), 'The Draughtman's Contract' is as cerebrally challenging as it is visually beautiful, with Michael Nyman's sensational mock-Baroque score the perfect icing on this multi-layered cake.
Anthony Higgins is worryingly sexy as the autocratic Mr Neville, and Janet Suzman is wonderfully womanly as the much older Mrs Herbert, their strange relationship confusing us as much as them until the shocking final scene.
An absolute delight.",970876800,2,1229,5.367875647668394
434303,5,6302180155,"This is an enigma of a film from Peter Greenaway. A intriguing and complex puzzle that is difficult to decipher. It will have you watching it many  times to try and discover who the culprit is. It is set in 1694 England. A  draughtsman is asked by a lady to make twelve drawings of her house. In  return, the man asks for money, and to use the lady for his intimate needs.  It's all going along as normal, then strange things start to happen. Stone  statues start to walk around, objects in the drawings start to move, then  the lady's husband is found murdered. The search is then on to find the  culprit. The DVD is Ok. The picture in widescreen 1.66:1 is clear, and the  sound in mono is alright. The extras are just filmographies and awards, and  production credits. It deserves a few more extras. The film is still a  great piece of puzzling cinema. The cast all wear beautiful costumes, and  speak in a statement-like manner. Buy it!",967075200,4,939,4.432748538011696
434314,4,6302180155,"Peter Greenaway's maddening puzzle of a film, The Draughtman's Contract, involves us in a multi-layered, multi-themed murder mystery involving an artist and an entire cast of crudely distinctive characters. Taking place in a very exaggerated and very artistically inspired version of England in 1694, Mr. Neville (Anthony Higgins) is hired to sketch twelve separate landscape illustrations of the Herbert estate. He agrees, with the intention that he will be repaid with food, shelter, money, and sexual favors by the wife of the owner of the estate, Virgina Herbert (Janet Suzman). Things get weird when Mr. Neville begins to suspect that Mr. Herbert has somehow mysteriously been murdered due to slight changes in the particular landscapes he is sketching. It turns out that he isn't the only one who suspects murder as well. Unfortunately, his arrogant behavior eventually causes everyone to dislike and resent him. The deal that was originally set forth is soon broken, but the chaos has only just begun.

Peter Greenaway's The Draughtman's Contract is a maddeningly ridiculous film. This statement becomes meaningless, however, when I realize that this is probably his most accessible film for the casual viewer. In terms of content, it is mild. In terms of over-the-top imagery, it's consistently focused and has little to no complicated structural camerawork. In fact, every shot in the film is a static shot. There are almost no close-ups, there is almost always more than one person on screen, and the entire film is shot with fixed master-shot camera angles. Because of this, many viewers will find the film alienating. It doesn't help that every character is dressed in such over-the-top garb. All of the dialogue in this film sounds irrelevant and excessive. The characters all speak in tangents and vocal riddles. Of course what most viewers don't seem to realize is that this is all a distraction technique to bring more attention to less important things. This is a film in which a murder-one is the least of anyone's concerns. The characters in this film were raised in such a way that superficial aspects of family and of circumstance play more into the thoughts of the characters than anything else. The only character in the entire film that actually seems concerned for what's going on at this estate is a complete sloth. This character would be the draughtman in this story and his contract concerns sexual favors in exchange for artwork. The viewer already knows, fairly early on, that his artwork will become less important in the grand scheme of things, and more important to the plot. This man has all the clues to a mystery murder, and it all exists nowhere else except for in his artwork. By the end of this film, the audience will know only a few things. This film's structure exists in details. Like many fans have said, it really is like the film equivalent of a crossword puzzle. We only know some of the answers, and we have to put the rest of the film together using only what we DO know, which is almost nothing except the bare minimum. There are exactly five major plot twists in this story, one of which occurs fairly early on, but we will never know the purpose of any of them until we reach the end of the picture.

In my opinion, one of Peter Greenaway's intentions was to make a sort of feminist film, the difference being that the feminism exists at a time when feminine qualities and women were not taken seriously and were often discriminated against. This is a film in which men are in power, but women are in control in the sense that they use their pain and their repression as a sort of weapon to combat the discrimination. It is difficult to elaborate on what I mean without getting into spoiler territory, however, so I will instead use this opportunity to try and back up my opinion in a way that doesn't evade to plot details for the casual reader, because I am sure many viewers will disagree with me on this opinion. A common theme that Peter Greenaway uses in his films is pure inhumanity vs cruel humanity. In many of his films, the most realistic or most passionate character is a person who is guilty of terrible acts. In this case, the title character is the perpetrator. Early on, the contract in question falls through only for a separate character to recreate and renew it in some form. The audience knows that only trouble can come out of this business, but we hope that somehow the draughtman is smart enough to see through it and come up with his own way of turning the tables. I won't ruin whether he does or not, because that's not the point. In order for Greenaway and his actors to stay true to the style of this murder mystery, however, the characters must be surrounded with as many red herrings as possible. For example, the large amount of characters and what they intend to do, by the end of the film, seems to have led nowhere. There is also a touch of surrealism involving a very bizarre statue located in the courtyard of the estate that only seems to catch the eye of the young and the low class. Now, historical accuracy aside, a lot of these details don't linger in the mind upon film conclusion. Throughout the film we may wonder what's going on, but the film ends on a factually satisfying note that ends up leaving many of the mysterious aspects of the film in the dust. Peter Greenaway would proceed to do this more and more with his films, which is why I recommend that if someone is new to the cinematic world of Peter Greenaway that they watch The Draughtman's Contract multiple times, because the off-putting aspects of his subsequent films will become harder and harder to digest without proper mental context.

Despite my high praise for this film, this is easily one of my least favorite Greenaway pictures. Peter Greenaway is my favorite English filmmaker, but aspects of The Draughtman's Contract have always left me cold. As accessible as this film is, it is also one of his more challenging films. If one is going to start watching Peter Greenaway, my personal recommendation to start with is The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover. As utterly bizarre, disturbing, and emotional as that film is, it is also one in which all of his commonly used themes are on full and exuberant display in every shot and in every plot development. It is a difficult film to swallow, but an easy film to understand and appreciate when one knows what to look for. This is more than I can say for, for example, Drowning By Numbers (which I didn't even notice the actual numbers that appear throughout the film on the screen and in dialogue until the film was almost over, though I did notice the drownings), and The Baby of Mcon (which was absolutely one of the most unpleasant and disgusting film viewing experiences I've ever had in my life and the thought of people watching it without viewing even a single other Greenaway film beforehand makes my skin crawl). It is also the closest he has come to making a genre picture, it is the film that got me into his work, and it is my favorite film of his as well as my second favorite film of all time. Peter Greenaway has stated in the past that filmmakers who want to tell stories should instead be writers. I understand exactly what he means when he says this, but I think part of what makes cinema and film progress as an art form is the new ways people have discovered to tell the stories that they want to tell. For example, my third favorite film is David Lynch's Eraserhead, which is a film that Peter Greenaway himself has said is a masterpiece. To many people, it is a work of extreme ugliness and nightmarishness. To me it is all those things upon immediate reflection, but on second thought it is a beautiful, haunting, and very funny, sometimes gross, story about the beauty of parenthood.",1304812800,3,7825,4.664735698769008
434315,1,6302180155,"I was disappointed to discover that the version was for Zone 1 countries (US & Canada) even though I ordered the DVD via the Australian Amazon site.  This limits me to only two viewings, thus severely restricting our enjoyment of the film.

434316,4,6302180155,"The Draughtsman's Contract was made near the very height of the post-structuralist semiotic orgy that infected France and Germany and, to a lesser extent, the intellectual circles (such as they are) of Britain. If the most famous novel resulting from that frenzied period was The Name Of The Rose and the most widely read piece of theory was S/Z, then The Draughtsman's Contract was the most elegant and popular film.  But just as Rose and S/Z were ultimately less substantial than their progenitors tried to claim, so is this movie less than meets the eye.  For all Greenaway's insistence on semiotic clues (the objects that appear in the twelve drawings the eponymous Mr Neville is contracted to produce), the fact is that this is a beautiful work that is essentially hollow at the core.  But frankly it doesn't matter.  No one composes shots like Greenaway.  Each frame is constructed with the care of an Old Master.  It doesn't matter that the plot is silly and the intellectual guessing-game actually rather thin.  What carries the movie is its sense of itself.  It is assured, witty, engaging, and wonderful to look at.  Greenaway revels in the period costumes and the dialog is always brisk and amusing.  This is a movie you would be happy to watch with the volume turned off, were it not for the score which is glorious in itself - a twentieth century interpretation of period composers like Purcell.

The plot of the movie has been recapitulated by other reviewers; suffice it to say that really the plot doesn't matter except that it acts as a scaffold for Greenaway's compositions.  This is essentially a static movie, a movie in individual frames each of which is to be savoured. It doesn't matter ""what Greenaway meant"" because in the end the whole post-structuralist theory meant practically nothing.  But whereas post-structuralist music is unlistenable and works like S/Z are now mere museum curiosities, The Draughtsman's Contract is still worth watching for the sheer visual delight it provides.",1233187200,7,2013,4.973134328358209

434318,4,6302180155,"This new digital transfer looks quite nice but keep in mind the limitations of the format it was shot in--Super 16mm (most TV shows were shot in 16mm for British TV and this was financed by Channel 4--when watching this new digitally restored transfer of ""The Draughtman's Contract"". The plan was for a theatrical release and then a TV airing. The budget was quite small. Super 16mm doesn't yield the fine detail of 35mm or 70mm. The transfer is an improvement over the previously available DVD but it also reveals the flaws of the source so the high definition elements can't mask the limitations of Super 16mm.

The real reason to get this though is for the extras. We get a commentary track by director Peter Greenaway as well as an introduction that's almost long enough to be a featurette on the making of the film. We also get deleted scenes, an interview with composer Michael Nyman (""The Piano""--this was one of Nyman's first scores), a restoration demonstration, behind-the-scenes footage and on set interviews and the original theatrical trailer for the film. There is also a booklet with an essay by Greenaway (don't read it until AFTER you have seen the film if this is your first time viewing it)and an interview with Cinematographer Curtis Clark discussing how he and Greenaway decided to use Super 16mm and the challenge of shooting only by candlelight.

""The Draughtman's Contract"" won't be for everyone. Director Peter Greenaway deliberately sought to subvert the way a traditional period piece was portrayed in film with this unusual and elliptic mystery. Part social commentary and avant garde period piece. Greenaway has his actors behave in a stiff, formal way often posing as often as performing. Imagine an avant-garde period film written by Patricia Highsmith and directed by Alfred Hitchcock and you might just get an idea of what ""The Draughtman's Contract"" is like.

The plot is simple--Mr. Neville a draughtsman who creates pictures of valuable items for the wealthy is employed by Mrs. Herbert the wife of a stuffy and insufferably man. She plans to give the pictures that Neville draws as a gift to her husband when he returns from his journey. Neville's terms are difficult to say the least--he demands that she engage in degrading sex with him, provide room and board plus his usual fee. Neville thinks himself superior to those he provides service to and makes that quite clear his speech and attitude. It's a time of stuffy people doing stuffy things and Neville takes advantage of it. In many respects, Neville is just as bad as the master of the house subjecting the family to his whims but things take an unusual turn when it appears that a murder may have been committed.

""The Draughtman's Contract"" is certainly unusual and for those adventurous enough to try it (and those that enjoy ""art films"" something that Greenaway was trying to take the stuffing out of anyway with this film), you'll probably enjoy it. It is an acquired taste so I would recommend a rental before purchasing.",1203638400,17,3023,4.886939571150098

If you've never seen the film and you count yourself as a movie buff, you must.  I'm not saying you'll come away as a champion of the movie, I'm sure their are as many people who think it was silly and confusing as those who attribute genius to the production.  But regardless, it's a stunningly beautiful film and there can be no argument that it's compelling to watch, which seems to be Greenaway's forte, stirring up the pot, but with the most elegant eye candy.

This DVD presents a ""restored"" version of the film, which as explained in a special feature, is not actually a frame by frame ""Vertigo"" style effort, but a digital wash through a couple of programs that eliminate flicker and improve detail.  In any case, as illustrated in the examples shown, the process does produce a noticeably cleaner film.  The question is should you rush out and replace your existing copy?  I have the 1999 DVD, and I can now see the flaws, but they weren't so bad that it affected my enjoyment in any way.  Your call, even the new version is not that great, this was his first (feature) film, and was filmed with rather primitive equipment.

You cannot talk on your cell phone and get up for snacks repeatedly during this film. You will be lost if you do.

Greenaway has done a simple thing here: He has written a Restoration Mystery. Like the Restoration Comedies of Dryden or Congreve, the language is thick and full of double and even triple innuendoes. Like Agatha Christie....it's a murder mystery with clues that tell you exactly who done it. [If you pay attention, it is quite clear who actually did the deed and on behalf of whom.] Terribly British and terribly wonderful!

434322,1,6302180155,"Whatever Greenaway is trying to achieve here--historical allegory, 17th-century sex romp, comedy of manners, etc.--is beyond most of us, I'm afraid.

It begs the question: who's he making the movie for? Is this pandering to some tiny group of intelligentsia who'll watch it and then proudly declare that they--and yes, they alone--'get it'? Which of course leaves the rest of us--the great unwashed and uneducated masses--scratching our heads and asking for our money back.

Frankly, this is the kind of rot that affects much of modern art (and Greenaway, don't forget, started out life as a graphic artist). All these coy, internal references which are nothing more than the director thumbing his nose at the general public and quietly declaring, ""If you don't understand my movie...then to h*ll with you. See if I care.""

If you need further evidence of this, just look at the extra features on the DVD. There are none. No director's-commentary soundtrack, no critic's commentary, no supplemental or historical-background material...any of which *might* have made it a more enjoyable, approachable or understandable film. God forbid, that.

If there's any allegory here, it's the dead, bloated and tortured body floating in the water at the end. Maybe it's Greenaway's subconscious way of admitting that he's made an equally dead and tortured film.

434323,4,6302180155,"The first Peter Greenaway's feature ""The Draughtsman's Contract"" (1982) - is absolutely delightful, devilishly clever (just imagine the best Agatha Christy's mystery with all sorts of clues and suspects but without Poirot or Ms. Maple to explain in the end whodunit and why. You are on your own to try to figure out - everything you need to know is right there), and funny (Yes, Greenaway can be funny!) art film - the perfect example of an art film. It combines the elements of social satire with murder mystery, meditates on the power of art and role of an artist, studies family drama and mothers - daughters love and understanding, perfectly wraps it in sensual pleasure - and what the pleasure it is. I know I will watch it again because it is a feast for eyes (I've seen big budget movies that looked plain comparing to this one shot on the limited funds), ears (Michael Nyman wrote one of the best score ever for this film) and for brain - there are mysteries and puzzles in every frame and in every dialog.

There is couple of Greenaway's thoughts on his first film and on the films that influenced him from the interview that was published in L'Avant-Scene Cinema"", No 333, October 1984:

""Majority of my films may be viewed on several levels. Thus, in ""The Draughtsman's Contract"" there was the desire to open the symbolism of plants and fruits, to study the connections between the aristocrats and the common people, the conflicts between the worlds of gentlemen and of servants. With my films, I hope to generate interest, to stimulate imagination, to wake feelings...

I consider that 90% of my films one way or another refers to paintings. ""Contract"" quite openly refers to Caravaggio, Georges de la Tour and other French and Italian artists...

Before the work on the film began, I did not explain to film crew what I wanted, but I showed them five European films: ""Fellini's Casanova"", ""The Last Tango in Paris"" by Bertolucci, ""The Marquise of O"" by Eric Rohmer, ""Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach"" by Jean-Marie Straub and, most importantly, ""Last Year at Marienbad"" by Alain Resnais which has been the most influential film for me.""

434334,4,6302180155,"There is a plot, sort of. A murder that is never solved with enigmatic clues, signifiers that never match a signified. The film is all subtext, no text, and all surface, no depth. But this is not a complaint. The surface has a sinister glitter and the film hints that there is indeed nothing behind it. What you see is what there is. This is not to say the film has no political meaning. It clearly enough shows the exemption of privilege from responsibility which should be no news to us in the Republican ascendency. But the real meaning of the film is not its content but its very taking style, a triumph of imagery over substance, thus ultimate postmodernism.",1126051200,,663,4.533333333333333

434336,4,6302180155,"This is the movie that brought Greenaway to the world stage...

... it's the intriguing story of a man who's persuaded, against his better judgment, to make some drawings of a country estate - unaware that he's being used as a pawn in a vicious plot involving several co-conspirators.

The visuals are stylish (perhaps even over stylized), and the dialogue demands the viewer's attention at every turn: but it's a movie worth watching more than once because of its ambiguities.

I first saw this film in 1984, and even today I'm not convinced that I've solved all of its mysteries.",1113955200,4,581,4.79
434337,4,6302180155,"Peter Greenway's first feature combines ""Masterpiece Theater"" dialogue and settings with an unusual mystery that unfolds slowly like a rose. The draughtsman Mr. Neville(Anthony Higgins)is hired by Mrs. Herbert to draw portions of her husband's estate while he is away on business. There's something amiss about the drawings that Mr. Neville doesn't catch but others do suggesting that all is not as it seems at the Herbert estate. Well directed by Peter Greenway, the use of candlelight for key scenes in the film reminds me of the ambitious Kubrick film ""Barry Lyndon"". Although there's much more happening both on the surface of this film and below than most Hollywood films, ""The Draughtsman's Contract"" has such a static, placid surface that it's easy to get lulled into watching it without seeing what's going on. The formal dialogue and look of the film suggests a Merchant-Ivory period piece in some respects although it's clears that Greenaway is making a comment on how we see the world around us. It's also a comment about our possessions and how they define us. Depending upon what's in them, the drawings could represent different things. If, for example, Mrs. Herbert's clothing items appeared as part of the landscape, it's clear that the drawings would be much more about her. As it is, her husbands things from shirts to boots dominate the landscape predicting a strange and unusual twist at the end of the film.

The print used here is washed out and doesn't have the detail one has come to expect in a DVD transfer. I'd blame that on the source print used which appears to have been exhibited one too many times losing much of its bold colors and sharpness. The transfer isn't the best but the film looks decent on DVD. It's possible some of the defects seen here could be due to the fact that the film was shot in Super16mm. There's little in the way of extras which is a pity; I'd love to have heard Greenway's commentary track or thatof the actors involved in the making of the movie. We do get some production credits, awards as well as a limited filmography.

I'd suggest renting or paying as little as possible as this just isn't the greatest transfer and needs to be spiffed up with extras.  Greenaway boldly tries a number of unusual experiments in his first feature film. Evidently hisoriginal cut of this was nearly four hours long (luckily, we didn't have to suffer through that version as this is perfect at a little under two hours). An arthouse hit in 1982, ""The Draughtsman's Contract"" signaled the arrival of a bold new talent in film.",1112918400,9,2569,4.7685393258426965
434338,5,6302180155,"This is the best meeting card to refer one of those weird and artistic films . This is the second work of Greenaway , conspicious and polifacetic as his own movie.
Summer XVII . In a community of a recent rich family in the english village , a dare painter accepts to make some drawnings of the elegant mansion of Mr. Herbert . Since the husband is absent there is a condition in the contract ,in which the lady must satisfy the sexual apetites of the painter .
But this will be just the sparkling point for a complex web in which the two main ladies of the house are involved ; an evil and perverse plan thought with the meticulous and mathematical perfection of a chess player . This will become in th beginning of the end for the artist . The figure of the bufon servant is employed for Greenway as the ancient shakesperian device (King Lear, for instance) , he is mude witeness who will have his painted latin pineapple.
The great triumph of Peter Greenaway consists in mixing levels of interpretation or estetic facets (pictoric , musical). He shows an unusual artistic ingenius , merciless and wild .
This film is important because it will work out as a reference for later works . Greenaway has added to the cinema art , new expression possibilities , in the best tradition of Visconti, Jarman and the visual magnetism of Nicholas Roeg . His films are loaded with eccentric cynicism and sometimes overtone black humor as you know . The multiple , sinister and macabre behavior of most of his characters are practically a constant in every work with the notable exception of The belly of an architect , for instance .
Recommendable for you if you like this mood .",1092009600,4,1669,4.511551155115511
434339,5,6302180155,"""The Draughtsman's Contract"" is a  precise, almost mathematical dissection of human motivation, desire, envy and retribution. The wonder is that it is delivered by a painterly director at the height of his powers. A rare mix.
Cunning and subtle, yet in love with the subject...usually doesn't work - but while you're being beguiled by the visuals, the story sneaks up on you from behind, and leaves you with a puzzle which rewards the solving.
Michael Nyman's memorable score perfectly complements the gorgeous cinematography, while providing a constant reminder of the enormous underlying tension of the story.
If all of this sounds a little earnest, let me put it another way - it's all about..., and it looks and sounds beautiful - what's not to like?",1064448000,5,754,5.032
434340,5,6302180155,"I first saw ""the Draughtsman's Contract"" in the movies when it first came out.  I was rivited by the wholeness of every detail in the film.  For example, the filmmakers eye for accurate detail, even down to the orange ribbions the men & women wore on their clothes!
The story is a real mind bender as well.  Everything seems so matter-of-fact, but it's not that way at all.  I also love how the tables turn for the obnoxious, know it all draughtsman, and how the clothes colors were reversed when that happened(black/white).
The scenes filmed by candelight were wonderful, not as pretty as those in Barry Lyndon, but with a starker authenticity, making them appear more real.
Another great thing about this movie is how it was scored. Greenaway uses Purcell, but with a twist, it's so clever & very appropriate to this film.  Also, Janette Suzmann is terrific as Mrs. Herbert.
Like all of Peter Greenaway's films, this does not have mass appeal, but it's truly a masterpiece & worth a watch especially for those who enjoy period peices, mysteries & stories about the human condition.",1064361600,6,1083,4.770053475935829
434341,4,6302180155,"This tale of a 17th Century draughtsman who takes a commission to do drawings of a wealthy Englishman's estate only if he can ""do"" the Lady of the estate at the same time, is an intriguing piece for those unhurried and with a taste for something different.
Meticulously recreating the era, with the best candlelit scenes since Barry Lyndon, we realize that a stately sort of mystery is unfolding as we watch the arrogant artist have his way with first the mistress of the house and then her daughter, all the while insulting and denigrating everyone around him.
The Draughtsman is arrogant, self-confident, and sure that he is superior to the aristocratic twits he serves with his art.  That he believes he is smarter than everyone around him will come around to be his undoing.  Being used while he thinks he is doing the using, the Draughtsman finds out too late that he has been nothing more than a pawn in a game he never understood.
Not for everyone, I found the film fascinating but as detached and aloof as its protagonist.  This cold detachment becomes the wry amusement in the story, but also separates us from any emotional connection to the characters.  There are also the typical Greenaway non sequiturs, in this case a naked fool, painted, posing as statues etc.  At any rate, worth a look for those wanting something different.",1035504000,13,1341,4.738197424892704
434342,1,6302180155,"This is probably the worst film I have seen, narrowly beating George Of The Jungle. The design is beautiful, with the sets and costumes serving a dull dull story, bereft of plot, characters, and interesting dialogue. Why Greenaway tried to write this himself, instead of employing a writer is beyond me. Michael Nyman makes a good stab at the music, but it is too dominant in the sound mix, and not subtle enough to complement the occasionally good photography. Add to the mix unnecessary music, actors who barely move when speaking their lines, many characters who look alike due to identical make-up or masks, and a pretentious pseudo-restoration English, and the result is an unintelligible mess.",1009584000,10,699,5.0344827586206895
434343,5,6302180155,"You don't have to be a student of Restoration drama to enjoy, in fact revel in this 17th century story of strategems, intrigue and double entendres.  If you are a student of this period, or have a historical familiarity, then you'll be even more delighted. The Draughtsman's Contract from its intimate, candlelit close-ups to its ribald and rapier-like puns, from its sumptuous interiors to its elegant feast of manners will tease your senses as it feeds your intellect.
Mrs. Virginia Herbert, an unloved and much neglected wife of a wealthy landowner (thanks to her dowry),commissions a handsome, clever and talented young draughtsman to make twelve drawings of her house while her husband is away.  With little ado and certainly no pretence, Mrs. Herbert also privately agrees to satisfy any and all of Mr. Neville's sexual pleasures whenever and wherever he wishes. So begins his commission much to the amused disdain of the Herberts' neighbors.  At first Mr. Neville seems to have the upper hand with this coterie to whom wit is prized above all things. Moreover, his audacious style and lusty spontaneity attract another proposal, this time a contract with Mrs. Herbert's daughter Sarah. Sarah is married to a gentleman whose words are like his clothes, she tells him: there's no substance in either of them.
Despite his extracurricular activities, the Draughtsman is a conscientious artist who takes great care to reflect accurately in his work all that he observes.  When he begins to notice a randomly placed pair of boots in a field, a man's jacket thrown unexpectedly over a hedge, a ladder leading nowhere, Neville is first annoyed and then curious. When Mr. Herbert's horse returns without his rider, Neville suspects murder.
Over the years I've seen a few other Peter Greenaway films, Propero's Books, A Zed and Two Noughts, The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and her Lover and Drowning by Numbers.  Of all his films, The Draughtsman's Contract has, in my opinion,  the most substance and also gives the most satisfying entertainment.  Propero's Books had promise but seemed to be consumed finally by its own excesses.

The characters' arch elegant dialogues are honed to perfection.  The overall effect is more of a theatrical presentation than a movie, as the camera is usually fixed and allows for the leisurely luxury of fully contemplating a scene as it is articulated without any overly active directorial cutaways or insistent editing. The film ponders numerous themes:  beguilement, romance, marriage and inheritance laws, religious and class differences, feminine power, all wrapped in the intrigue of a murder mystery, and gloriously portrayed by actors of the highest caliber.  The setting is a country estate and the action takes place in the milieu of the richly detailed Restoration period of post-Jacobean England in 1694.  The closest relative to this film might be 'Barry Lyndon.'  If you liked that film you will definitely enjoy this opus.  It is a memorable classic to be treasured.
