7978051,4,B00007L4L6,"After being sorely disappointed with season 2, I was shocked and very impressed by the ending of this series. I'm not going to spoil it, but I will say that it's unexpected and very sweet. This ending deserves 5+ stars, but b/c the production quality of this entire series was bad I'm sad to give it 4. As a whole, this series deserves 3 stars. The story is great. Even though there is not as much action as there was in season 1, it's still a lot of fun and very dramatic. The production quality is awful. The animation is about as bad as I've ever seen. All the characters have mysteriously gotten super ugly, and have unbearable sounding voices. Cherry is the only character that doesn't look like she had a botched plastic surgery procedure and an awful voice. The cute Marionettes from season 1 look deformed. It's really hard to get used to. The good and the bad average out to 3 stars in my book. I suggest renting or watching season 2 online before buying it.",1355961600,,967,4.407821229050279
7978052,5,B00007L4L6,this anime is excellent but the ending is far from what one would expect instead of a romantic comedy this series like the first mixes some great characters with lots of emotion and a pinch of action i should be owned by any anime enthusist and as for the ending lime cherry and blood berry finally get what they want to live with otaru as humans just not in the way you migh think,1081728000,,381,4.162162162162162
