4246222,3,B0041QSZGA,"I thought this SNL would be much funnier than it was.  Adam Sandler was the only good disc, in my opinion.  However, for the price I got for it, it was a good buy.  Something to keep around and watch in the future.  It is interesting too look back on what current events were back then.",1315094400,,286,4.053571428571429
4246223,5,B0041QSZGA,"I admit, I came to this show with Eddie Murphy in mind first, and Adam Sandler to boot sounded a great deal.  Nor did I mind Chris Rock on the bill.  I couldn't have told you who Tracy Morgan was.  Oddly enough, after watching all four discs, each at around an hour, Tracy Morgan was probably my favorite of the bunch.  I dug it.  Some really hilarious and imaginative skits (though probably could've done without the Conan O'Brian show spots, but those were 'extras' on special features).  Second in the running would have been Sandler who is hilarious even in his very young days, as anyone knows (Opera Man, etc!). Then Chris Rock also good fun.  And last but not least Eddie Murphy!  I was really surprised that I should enjoy them in this order but so it went.  You can't go wrong with this set and these comedians from the show that got them all started.",1300233600,13,860,4.426751592356688
4246224,4,B0041QSZGA,The SNL 4 pack was a great bargain!  I was only looking for a Best of Eddie Murphy DVD but saw this product advertised for a great price!,1294531200,2,137,3.892857142857143
4246225,5,B0041QSZGA,Great for the money.  Have enjoyed the two I have seen so far.,1416009600,,62,3.769230769230769
4246226,5,B0041QSZGA,"No offense to the actor, but did Tracy Morgan need his own best of? He was talented and belonged on the show, but rarely was he a lead in skits or bring something original or unforgettable to SNL- you could argue he was overshadowed however.

Chris Rock and Adam Sandler at their best. Again two very talented comedians and also examples of success beyond SNL. What makes this their best though is that you get them in bite sizes..so when you get loud and obnoxious Adam Sandler you get it for 5 minutes, not 90 minutes like his movies. He is great at doing other roles and personalities but you really only get to see them here. Chris Rock was an essential piece to golden era of SNL.

Eddie Murphy is probably #2 behind Bill Murray for SNL comedians who launched iconic success with SNL as their launching pads. Here you can see his very broad skillset. He shines best however do to a less than stellar accompanying cast (in my opinion).",1413676800,,939,4.453488372093023

4246233,5,B0041QSZGA,"My ""birth plan"" was to watch SNL during labor to keep my mind of the pain. This combo provided lots of distraction and lots of laughs! Some of the skits are seen on other Best of compilations but they're so funny I never get sick of seeing them. I think the nurses thought we were a little odd but I am positive they enjoyed the laughter these 4 brought into our room!",1403049600,,368,4.125
4246234,3,B0041QSZGA,"Four presentations of more than an hour each, so you know that this thing is packed  with material. So that's good.

However, neither the Eddie Murphy nor the Chris Rock presentations were very good; the first because it wasn't thorough and the second because Rock just didn't ever have enough aired on ""SNL"" to compile a ""greatest hits."" In fact a large slice of what's there was done when he was hosting the show, and not when he was a cast member.

Neither Adam Sandler nor Tracy Morgan was one of my favorite cast members of the show, but those two programs are much more substantial than the other two, although Sandler's is weighed down by too many Opera Man sketches.

Overall, not a bad pickup for fans of the show, but fans of Murphy or Rock probably won't be happy.",1402963200,2,775,4.475177304964539
4246235,5,B0041QSZGA,I love Adam Sandler! Any movie with him in it is really a good ass movie. I love it all!,1398816000,,88,3.45
4246236,5,B0041QSZGA,the good old stuff. Worth the investment. Not exactly kid friendly but it is SNL so I didn't expect it would be.,1389312000,,112,4.136363636363637
4246237,4,B0041QSZGA,"Yes, four DVD'S in one package. Many of your favorite moments included. Tracey Morgan's is the best of the lot. Very good picture and sound, plus extras. These are four of the series of ""Best of ""'s from SNL, just grouped in one set. The good news is the four DVD's are not overlapped in the case. Each is mounted on its own plastic ""page"". Enjoy!",1389225600,5,347,4.2727272727272725
4246238,5,B0041QSZGA,"These are everyones favorite comics put into one case with four very different DVDs! You will love Eddie Murphy's hot tub sketch and all of his lovable chrachters. Adam Sandler is amazing like always, i personally don't understand why the seasons he was on were the worst because that is the funniest DVD in there. Lets face if Chris Rock just rock and if you love Tracy Morgan you are gonna love his character Brain Fellows. Just get it thanks",1388620800,,444,4.5625
4246239,5,B0041QSZGA,I really bought this DVD for my son because his Best of Richard Pryor SNL walked away from his house. So he was thrilled that he got four for the price of one. This is really a great buy!,1382745600,,187,3.8205128205128207

4246243,5,B0041QSZGA,I purchased these for my husband and he is so glad to have them in his collection. He enjoys them a lot.,1365811200,,104,3.772727272727273
4246244,3,B0041QSZGA,I have not viewed all of these Best ofs yet. They take their place in one time slot in my growing SNL collection.,1365465600,,113,3.9565217391304346
4246245,5,B0041QSZGA,I originally was looking for the best of Eddie Murphy when I stumbled across this collection. When I saw that this also had the best of Adam Sandler I decided to buy it. Both of those DVDs have some of their best known skits and if you are a fan you will definitely enjoy the collection. I have never really followed Chris Rock or Tracy Morgan but I really enjoyed some of their skits as well. If you are a fan of any of these comedians or even just one I would get this collection since it really is a great deal and you will save a lot if you buy this instead of all of the them on there own.,1363996800,2,594,3.9173553719008263

4246248,5,B0041QSZGA,I bought this just for the Eddie Murphy disc but the rest of the disc were just as funny. Great Buy!,1358726400,,100,3.8095238095238093
4246249,5,B0041QSZGA,"The only problem with ""Best of"" anything is that it always leaves you wanting more! This is my 2nd time owning the Best of Tracy Morgan. The Hardball skit where he calls Osama bin Laden an Uncle Tom is utterly timeless humor. Needless to mention, comic heavyweights Rock, Murphy and Sandler's DVD are 2nd to None (well, only to the Best of Will Ferrell, of which I have Vol. I and II). Great buy, a steal at any price.",1357689600,,418,4.30379746835443
