2402388,4,B000B64TTQ,My kids love it and are learning hebrew! The intro song is catchy too brings me back memories of when I was a kid! Can't wait to purchase the most current videos.,1302480000,2,162,4.09375
2402389,4,B000B64TTQ,"Good, but not great- held the interest of a classroom full of kids for one or two episodes, but some are a bit dated.  All in all, I'd say buy it- but if they came out with a newer one, go with that.",1192665600,9,199,3.627906976744186
2402390,3,B000B64TTQ,We love the video and my sons are both enjoying the music but it doesn't have the highest quality of effects.  We bought the entire collection.  I would recommend the video to anyone but I wish Sesame Street would do a better job like they did with the Plaza Sesamo and Sesame Street US.,1173312000,3,287,4.296296296296297
2402391,5,B000B64TTQ,"i have only one of these episodes so far (the box set is on my wishlist, i have the passover edition) but it was great. sesame street has shows all over the world, each set to it's own culture and language, and they are outstanding.

if you are jewish with young children, this will be a very good way to help them learn about their culture and to help explain the holidays in a way they can understand. highly recomended!",1139875200,18,422,4.275
8082096,5,B000B64TTQ,Shalom!! I am trying to learn Hebrew on my own. Love this as repetition is an easy way to learn even for adults.  This is certainly more entertaining than a boring CD or MP3.  I wish this was on TV when I was young and I am using it to encourage and educate my children.  Everything is better with Grover!,1510963200,,305,4.05
8082097,5,B000B64TTQ,I'm so thankful we are able to share the Shalom Seaseme that my husband grew up watching with our kids. They love it and ask frequently to watch Sum Sum!,1475193600,,153,4.133333333333334
8082098,4,B000B64TTQ,"This DVD collection includes eleven episodes on 5 DVDs. The episode titles and subjects include ""The Land of Israel;"" ""Tel Aviv;"" ""Kibbutz;"" ""The People of Israel;"" ""Jerusalem;"" ""Chanukah;"" ""Sing Around the Seasons;"" ""Journey to Secret Places;"" ""Aleph-Bet Telethon;"" ""Passover; and ""Kids Sing Israel,""

The five DVDs includes interactive menus; printable teaching guide ideal for Hebrew School for every episode. I would highly recommend this series for early Hebrew school to learn about Israel.

The first five episodes were done in 1986 with Bonnie Franklin and Yitzhak Perlman. The second series with six episodes were featured with Jereny Miller from ""Growing Pains."" There are plenty of celebrity cameos like Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara; Nell Carter; Joan Rivers and Melissa; and more.

I did see a change between the first and second season. I felt the first season dealt with diversity and incorporated a wide range of Israelis more. Since I'm a Bonnie Franklin fan, the DVD collection includes her in the first five episodes. She is sorely missed three years later.

Sadly with everything going on in Israel today, I felt like I was watching a different country. The Israel in 1986 and 1990 is totally different than today. This series makes me long for the Israel then.",1464912000,,1280,5.139423076923077

I enjoyed these",1455062400,,45,6.5
8082101,1,B000B64TTQ,"Rabbi Grover is very good but he should say how homosexuals like Bert and Ernie are wrong! He fails to condemn the horrible acts and it is not very Kosher! The Bible even says they will burn in Hell and should be killed. How Kosher can you be!?

Also the part where baby Oscar gets his Circumcision, Rabi Grover doesn't suck off the blood - not very Kosher!

The moocher Cookie Munich is no greedy enough to stand out as a real Jew.

Not very happy about this, it isn't ""Jewish"" enough for anyone who is Orthodox.",1420329600,,513,4.268041237113402
8082102,3,B000B64TTQ,"It's dated. From what I understand, there is a newer version that would assume is a little better. That being said, my almost 3 year old did enjoy watching it a few times, and I am glad to have the title in our collection.",1355788800,,222,4.068181818181818
8082103,5,B000B64TTQ,My children were given this set when my older child was 3 years old by her grandfather and it was one of her favorites of all time.  My kids learned the Hebrew alphabet and facts about Israel from this set.  We just bought it for our first grandchild--she is only 2 and we expect her to grow into it (and enjoy discovering the character her family's cat is named after!),1355616000,,370,4.271428571428571
8082104,2,B000B64TTQ,found it hard for a young child to understand.  it didn't hold her interest like regular sesame. I thought I would buy more of this series but changed my mind,1330732800,,158,4.266666666666667
8082105,4,B000B64TTQ,My daughter is thoroughly enjoying these dvds. Too bad they're from the early 80s. I guess you can look at them as a retro find.,1310342400,4,128,4.16
