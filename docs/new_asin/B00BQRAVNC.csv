I feel like I should have more to say but I watched it in a very brief time on a computer. The episodes that really stand out are the episodes about nuclear weapons and the boy who grew a fish in a cube, and eventually became a very big fish. There's also a very nice filler episode about the lochness monster.

I like all of the characters. It's essentially a slice of life anime that turns into a cyber anime with action. The animator is very famous, having worked on many anime legends including Evangelion.

What is perhaps most memorable for me is the use of fog, which relates to memories. This reaching back into one's youth to try to find the sequences lost in time. In a way it's almost like the aimless search for nostalgia. It's like an itch that one must scratch, and when one does it's incredibly satisfying.

I quite liked the way they explained Amasawa's character as well as Yasako, or gentle girl, who wears glasses and seems a bit out of place, almost too fragile at first for her own good.

Her sister Kyoko, is quite a bit younger and immature and constantly exclaims, ""poop"". I thought that was funny. I think people really are all the same everywhere you go.

What I liked most about the series was probably the mystery. A lot of critics have put the impetus on the series to solve everything for them and feed it to them conveniently. I quite liked that the viewer is as lost in the dark at times, (by long sentences about cybertech) as the characters themselves.

Dennou Coil apparently translates to electric brain, and this series is also called a Coil of Children. Although it seems this may more closely translate to Cyber Brain. The characters all use these special glasses like they were gameboys, but instead life is the game. They even have lasers, and hilariously they use metatags to fend off bad guys.

Everything takes place in a city-like town, in alley-ways and parks, small streets and shrines, a very enclosed community, where it's more like the characters fend off their boredom. It reminded me quite starkly of my childhood. But it shows us that children have the most fun outside. One could hardly imagine American parents allowing their children outside to play all day.

I suppose if one were to subjectively take the fast moving narrative as too complex for its own good, one could in fact turn down this series. Of course most only feel this way about the second half, and especially the near end.

You also get Miyazaki-like character design and nice, warm, cool colours, nothing to extreme on either end, so in many ways it's pleasant for the eye, even if like a typical Tokyo, or urban city, there are far too many grays and whites, and this in turn makes a series in ways dull.

A lot of work was apparently put into this show over many years, and it first aired on Japans' NHK, which is its BBC, so I've heard.

I quite enjoyed the different elements in it. The episode where all the characters grow beards from traveling, infectious 'illegals' has to be one of the more special, distinctive anime episodes I have seen.

A great mystery series with sci-fi elements in a slice-of-life setting.",1420502400,2,3266,4.571917808219178
8572825,5,B00BQRAVNC,"It defies logic, that this is unknown and unavailable in North America. ('Course, 20 years ago no one in the West had heard of 'Naussicaa.') After four years of seeking access, driven by only a hunch, I finally obtained a copy via Amazon. It's Zone 4 Australia, so it requires an all-zone machine. No other English subtitled version seems to exist, anywhere. It has not disappointed. I guessed by the drawing that this would be the real deal. You can tell very much about an anime by one drawing sample. Not the ""large eyes"" variety of anime, and the personalities are believable, finely wrought and irresistible. The cast is nearly all children, but they are wise to far more than the adults, even those who police cyberspace  - because children have time, they notice, they don't presume and are curious. And because cyber life is second nature to them.
The setting and plot are hard to describe. The whole assumption set of the kids' lives is unfamiliar and require a few episodes to absorb. To consume this with pleasure you have enjoy computer terminology and be willing to consider that scary stuff may lie hidden in the ""un-formatted space"" of the cyber world.  We're glued to this series, but rationing our consumption so it lasts as long as I can stretch it.
It's one of those anime that fully recharges my sense of wonder.  - signed, Kay's anime-consuming surrogate",1413936000,3,1375,4.7447698744769875
