8131900,5,B000GG4Y00,"One of the very best documentaries that has been made. It's odd this documentary receives so little attention. Perhaps the subject is too unnerving for many to watch. After all, cell phones, washing machines, microwaves, refrigerators, even our toilets depend on electricity. This documentary should be bumped as a watch by anyone interested in how we function, and what allows us to function.

Electricity is the most important element of modern living bar none and this documentary will make you very uncomfortable realizing how dependent you are on it. As an example, one day a squirrel found its way inside the transformer just outside my house. Apparently this happens fairly often. Blew the transformer and with it my electricity. We no longer know what living without electricity is like, although my seventh day adventist parents would turn off all electricity at sunset on Friday and not turn it back on until sunset on Saturday. Perhaps the next president will find a worthwhile national project...like upgrading All the nation's electric systems.",1419120000,,1057,5.2176470588235295
8131901,5,B000GG4Y00,Great documentary about developing nations and difficulties American companies face when expanding into uncharted areas of the former communist world.,1355011200,,150,6.55
8131902,5,B000GG4Y00,"As others have pointed out, this documentary shows the economic issues and misery of the lack of electricity that Georgians had to face during the 90s and early 21st century. What touches me most about this film is that it gives the average westerner a peek into the lifestyle of Georgia 10 years ago as well as a comparison for us expats who live here now. What they failed to also point out was that most of Georgia outside of Tbilisi had absolutely no electricity at all, with the exception of Adjara. The town that I used to live in was completely in the dark in the 90s with the exception of the main businesses. My friends had vision issues from always reading in the candle light, my other friend was the most popular woman in the neighborhood due to her having a generator and many soap opera parties!

My life in this town in 2009 to 2011  was completely different from what I am experiencing in Tbilisi today. When I lived outside Tbilisi, I can remember many power cuts but they rarely lasted more than 5 hours; there were only a few times that the electricity was off for more than a day, and it sure is cold! BRRR!! Actually we had no gas or central heat until we moved to Tbilisi, I have learned to appreciate hot water and heat as well. I love it when he quoted that ""when the power is off, you are stressed to know how long it will last, and vice-versa- when it comes back on, you are nervous and trying to get things done until it goes off"". Exactly, I would be in the middle of doing something, including taking a hot shower, and then- darkness and cold water! The cuts sometime only lasted 5 minutes but often hours, you never know! We still get plenty of water cuts too, I had to skip out on a party due to no water to wash the conditioner out of my hair and no electricity to heat up my bottled water. The same holds true in Tbilisi, but it is quite rare, only a few power cuts or water cuts per month, but I still never take the elevator! The economy is terrible and I still get many people knocking on my door and honestly asking me for money to pay their electric bills. I always count my blessings and feel guilty to be in such a better financial situation than my fellow Georgian inhabitants and friends. It does feel so good whenever I have a chance to help, and I feel that promoting this documentary is one of the things that I can do for them.

The documentary is fantastic at showing the everyday lives of Georgians and how demoralizing it is when you have no power. It was such a gloomy time back then; especially the 90s with the multiple conflicts and economic issues. Things have changed so much in the past 10 years; and even the past 3 years that I have been here. I hope more and more viewers or documentary junkies will watch this film and appreciate the importance of electricity as much as I do. Another quote from the book, ""Stories I Stole"". He said,"" sure you always had plenty of power in England, but you did not know the instant feeling of bliss that occurs when the lights come back on"". I agree 100% and actually love that awakening and happiness I feel when the lights come back on. Treasure your luxuries!",1335657600,,3156,4.300840336134454
8131903,4,B000GG4Y00,"What happened when an American company tried to bring electricity to a country formerly part of the USSR is what this doc is all about. The Georgians aren't accustomed to paying for power, but AES is determined to get the money out of them. Though US, most of the company's employees seem to be Brits. Well done.",1247702400,,312,4.491228070175438
8131904,5,B000GG4Y00,Excellent documentary on the trials and tribulations companies face investing in the former USSR and what the smaller republics face in trying to build a market economy in the former Soviet Union. I felt for the elderly who could not pay their bills. I greatly admire AES for trying to tackle the problems they faced in Georgia. They finally sold AES Telasi to the Russians in 2003 and from what I have read the situation is worse now because of the economic situation in the country.,1217116800,,484,4.6395348837209305
8131905,5,B000GG4Y00,"First off, I'm a ""documentary junkie"", especially when the director edits the film so that it forms a storyline and doesn't use the film for ""propaganda"" purposes. When that happens, I don't need to know the subject in advance to seek it out and watch it.

""Power Trip"" meets those conditions on all levels. It's recent enough to be current (it takes place between 1998 and 2003). And filmmaker Paul Delvin follows the timeline from when the American Owned energy AES bought the government power company in Soviet state of Georgia until ...... well, I can't tell you or it would spoil the narrative. Like a good filmmaker, Devlin seemed to have his camera at the right place and at the right time and he is able to capture some incidents that were not expected at the time he started his film. Again, it's those surprises that make this film interesting.

""Even handed"" and ""Well Balanced"" are two phrases that come to my mind immediately in describing this film. There are no ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" here. Well, yes there are. The politicians. (the corrupt ones anyway, who are the ""bad guys"".). But in the fight between the residents of Georgia who find themselves without power (no lights, no TV!) and the employees and President of AES (who are working for a company that can't collect payments for the power that THEY have to purchase), Devlin doesn't point any fingers or take sides.

And the personalities of the employees of AES who are working in foreign counties is fascinating too.  You'll remember AAES Manager Piers Lewis long after you've watched this film.

The supplemental material is interesting as well, though not essential to the enjoyment of the film. I'm not reviewing this from a political point of view; just as an example of excellent documentary filmmaking.

8131906,5,B000GG4Y00,"Devlin's gripping film unblinkingly exposes a Western audience to the fundamental upheavals accompanying major transformations in form of government. Shots of major blocks of the city going dark (as A.E.S cracks down on non-paying customers), and furious, uncomprehending people protesting the need to pay for electricity, bring into close proximity a far-away problem too few comfortable Americans even know about. An unnerving and cautionary tale, since energy could one day be a luxury for us all.",1185148800,,500,5.592105263157895
8131907,5,B000GG4Y00,"This film is funny, gripping and informative. It's hard to believe that a documentary about the privatization of the power grid in the Republic of Georgia could make such a fascinating tale. This film is excellent for use in classrooms trying to explain the political economy of post-socialist countries, or the problems facing foreign businesses in alien environments.",1181606400,,369,5.379310344827586
8131908,4,B000GG4Y00,"Againt a background of lovely, ethnic folk music (of the region), this is the story of the electrification of the former Soviet Union of Georgia, a land where 90% of the people cannot or will not pay for the power.  The events that unfold rival any theatre of the absurd.",1174867200,3,271,4.42
