I don't like the new song, it's just not as fun. Their is also a sing-a-long at the end called ""Little Engines"" that my twins love to dance to.

1814748,4,B00007JMD5,"Video was as expected.  If your kiddo likes Thomas' stories, Percy's Chocolate Crunch is a must-have.  Long story short, Percy is upset because Sir Topham Hatt has like, banned unnecessary washdowns.  So, in an attempt to stay clean, Percy decides to take the sugar cars to the chocolate factory because that's cleaner than say, shunting coal.  He skids on the rails and smashes into the factory and chocolate-coated Percy ensues. I'm not really sure there is a lesson to learn from that one, but my kiddo likes chocolate, and he likes Percy... thus making the Percy's chocolate crunch a winning combo.
Don't buy this if you're thinking you'll get the Bulgy bus, cause you won't.  You'll get a toy with it for sure, but it's a crap shoot as to which.",1210204800,,750,4.694656488549619
1814749,4,B00007JMD5,"Percy's Chocolate Crunch is an excellent video! I would have given it a 4.5 but Amazon does not have that. It is a great buy and almost every part of it is excellent. I am very pleased to see a gordon episode. He has been neglected as a main character this season.

Percy's Chocolate Crunch: 4.5/5

Percy complains all day about having to do the dirty work on the island. Trucks start calling him ""dirty percy"" which is a good name because children cannot repeat it and call themselves dirty percys. Then Percy refuses to do dirty work so he takes sugar cars to the chocolate factory but slippery rails cause percy to crash into the chocolate factory and get covered in chocolate!

Thomas, Percy, and the Squeak: 3.5/5

Thomas is to take a famous singer to her concert so when he has to get clean at the washdown he cuts in front of percy and calls him dirty percy. When the famous singer boards the coaches she sees a mouse and refuses to go on Thomas's train. Then percy comes in still dirty because he did not have time to get a washdown. The famous singer rides in percy to the concert. Later Thomas and percy make up and thomas lets percy get a washdown first. A good story of friendship, however it is tied for the worst.

Gordon Takes a Tumble: 5/5

This is the best story of the set, Gordon thinks hes better than everyone else and is too important to pull trucks. Until TFC forces Gordon to pull them. While speeding along with a train of trucks, Gordon ignores the ""go slow"" signs and crashes. The crash is a bit over dramatic but it is still my favorite story.

Buffer Bother: 4/4

A good bill and ben story, Ben gets new buffers but bill doesnt that makes bill extremely jealous and causes him to have an acident and damage his buffers. Jealousy is an area not covered too often in Thomas and Friends but it is an esential lesson to teach children with siblings.

Middle Engine: 4/5

Percy goes to the smelter and Arry and Bert play tricks on him to put coal cars in front and back of percy so he has to go slowly. Percy accidentally goes onto the tipper for the coal which is quite a funny sight. Then he gets in trouble with TFC. James is sent to the smelter the next day and Arry and bert put james in the middle of a long line of trucks. When James refuses to move Percy is sent to fetch him. This is a good percy episode, it lost half a point because it is just not as good as percy's chocolate crunch.

Faulty Wistles: 3.5/5

Tied for the worst with Thomas, Percy, and the squeak. Not really a bad thing though, this story brings back some of the classic narrow gauge engines who have not been seen for some time. Peter-Sam loses his whistle and Duncan makes fun of him for it. When Duncan over uses his whistle to show off it pops off! Cute story, just not good enough for a video like this.",1176076800,,2810,4.261278195488722
1814750,3,B00007JMD5,"I ordered this DVD because (1) my son loves Percy, and (2) he really wanted a Bulgy the Bus, which is pictured as the bonus vehicle that comes with the DVD.  Our DVD arrived with Skarloey instead of Bulgy.  If you're looking for Bulgy (he's hard to find), be wary that this might happen to you, too.  The DVD otherwise is great.",1168300800,,328,4.258064516129032
1814801,4,B00007JMD5,"We got this DVD after our 3 year old saw the cover and became fixated on learning the story.  I was glad to be getting another disc narrated by Alec Baldwin, since our first two were Make Someone Happy and Races, Rescues and Runaways, and as a result the voicings by George Carlin, Ringo Starr, and whoever it is doing the current series on PBS just don't sound right.  So strong is our association of the Baldwin voices with the Thomas characters that when I thought I saw Baldwin at the theater last week, I wanted to go up and tell him how much I appreciated his work on Thomas - the engines are all very distinctive and characterful.

Imagine my shock, then, when Gordon first speaks - and he has an average voice, not the unmistakeable deep bass of our earlier DVDs.  My whole problem with Carlin is that he doesn't realize that Gordon has a deep voice, and now it seems like Baldwin doesn't either.  Worse still, instead of his (obviously correct) clipped air-traffic-controller voice, Harold now speaks like some weird British eccentric - ridiculous!

I can only guess these are some of the first episodes Baldwin recorded, before he figured out the engines' *true* voices.  So, be warned - if you want to know what the engines really sound like, go for Races, Rescues and Runaways!

1814802,4,B00007JMD5,"Great Thomas Video. I liked all of the stories very much(They include: Percy's Chocolate Crunch, Thomas, Percy & the Squeak, Gordon Takes A Tumble, Buffer Bother, Middle Engine, Faulty Whistle) I'd say Gordon Takes A Tumble is one of the funniest stories of all time. The first time I saw this story, I was in tears(laughing, not crying) when Gordon fell of the rails and crashed into a pile of tires, a shed, and a giant mound of dirt and stops right in front of a scare crow. Now this is a story you'll want to see over and over again. Very good, 9 out of 10.",1095465600,3,561,4.252336448598131

In Buffer Bother Bill is jealous of Ben's new buffers. In Middle Engine Percy tries to stop getting tricked by Arry and Bert. In Faulty Whistle Duncan has to deliver freight cars by using an organ as a whistle. Then there is the music video Little Engines. This tape is good and I recommend it.",1066435200,,623,4.522123893805309
1814804,5,B00007JMD5,"i have been really critical of alec baldwin's vocalizations in the past (particularly in ""make someone happy""), but i have to say that this is by far the best of the 7 thomas tapes we own.  the messages in the episodes are good, the vocalizations are interesting, and mr. baldwin has totally changed the way he plays james for the better.  i also loved hearing him as the foreman at the coal plant saying, in his best brooklynese: ""joo have cawsed confyusion and deeelay.""  this video is such a tremendous improvement from some of mr. baldwin's previous efforts--please keep it up!  i highly recommend this video for anyone interested in thomas or interested in starting a thomas video collection.",1053907200,,697,4.831932773109243
1814805,4,B00007JMD5,"Our son is a big Thomas fan, and he really loves this new DVD from the Thomas and Friends series.  This one introduces a new character, Elizabeth, who is Sir Tophamm Hatt's first truck.
In the first story, Percy's Chocolate Crunch, there is a water shortage.  Since Percy has been doing a lot of dirty work, he complains that isn't always clean like he wants to be.  His driver suggests that they take some cars loaded with sugar to the chocolate factory, but chaos ensues.
In Thomas, Percy and the Squeak, Thomas is chosen to take the famous singer Alicia Botti to her concert.  She refuses to go with Thomas when she sees a mouse in one of his coaches.  Percy then comes to her rescue.
In Gordon Takes a Tumble, Gordon shows Salty that he's ""too big for his buffers"" and disobeys a few signs telling him to go slow when he is accidentally switched onto a branch line.  An accident then occurs.
In Buffer Bother, Ben needs new buffers.  Bill, his twin, is jealous because he wants them too.
In Middle Engine, Percy falls for Iron 'Arry and Iron Bert's devious tricks.
In Faulty Whistle, Duncan tries to show off by tooting his whistle too much.  It then comes loose and flies off when he tries to give Terence the Tractor ""the loudest whistle yet"".  A man who plays the organ then comes to Duncan's rescue (he has been riding with Duncan and offers to play his organ because it's too dangerous to travel without a whistle to alert the stations).
I definitely recommend this DVD in addition to the rest of the Thomas series.  It also has a cute little song called Little Engines.  Also, the bonus features are worth trying out as well.",1050451200,3,1635,4.4713804713804715

Join Percy in a unexpected visit to the chocolate factory, help the engines get Alicia Botti to the island concert in time & listen to the sound of Duncan's new whistle. At first I thought the song was stupid, but soon the tune got better! New stories, new characters & new DVD extras, this is where the fun begins!",1049155200,5,438,4.353658536585366

1814858,5,B00007JMD5,"Percy's Chocolate Crunch: Percy does the dirtiest work outy of all the engines. Sir Topham Hatt says every engine will only have one washdown per day. Percy ties not to get dirty but it won't work.
Thomas, Percy, and the Squeak: The famous singer, Allicia Botti, is going to have a concert on the Island of Sodor. Thomas is the one who gets her to the concert. He hears a wierd squeak coming from Annie.
Gorden Takes a Tumble: Gorden is the proudest engine on the island. One day, Salty comes up and teases him. That night it is really busy in the harbor. Gorden has to take some of the freight. He wants to prove to Salty he can take a freight train better than him. Well, I think you know the rest by the title.
Buffer Bother: Ben gets his buffers bended. He has to get new ones. Then Bill gets jeluice.
Middle Engine: Every engine is proud of their work. But no engine likes being a middle enginje becuase it is no fun being stuck in the middle of a freight train.
Faulty Whistle: Duncan is taking an organ and the headmaster somewhere. Along the way he whistles at Elizibeth, some sheep, and Terence. Then his whistle flies off like a rocket!

1814859,4,B00007JMD5,"Percy, the stout green engine, gets dirty in a few stories.  He wants to get clean.
This is a nice collection of new stories.  The new characters seem to be more subtly introduced, but the stories don't feel as lively as those presented on ""Salty's Secret.""
One note: narrator Alec Baldwin retains Salty's ""sea dog"" voice from the ""Salty's Secret"" collection; however, he has forgotten the voices he had established for other characters (even Elizabeth, the steam truck).  I guess most kids won't notice, but why jazz up the narration if there isn't going to be continuity?  Ringo and George didn't need the fancy voices.",1045612800,6,621,4.885714285714286

If you have a Thomas fan in your house, this is a must-have. It has a lot of the newer characters, but does a great job of incorporating the old favorites along with them. The stories are original, funny and have a good message. I'm not even sick of it yet, just give me a few more days.",1044835200,18,486,3.87
