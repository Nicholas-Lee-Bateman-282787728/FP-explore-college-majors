1827357,5,B0000844ML,"This movie is overwhelming in its effect on the viewer. I am a big besson fan and came across this older movie a few years ago (before the dvd release) when I found it at a tag sale in a box of Laser Discs. Being a diver and realizing what the movie was about (life underwater as if you ARE a creature of the sea, with the music to match the sea creatures ""personalities"", among other things) I actually shopped ebay to buy a Laser Disc just to watch this movie. It was worth it.  I think this is much better than the Koyaanisqatsi series because of its simplicity and compactness.  The essential Luc Besson if you will.",1093219200,5,620,4.245762711864407
1827358,1,B0000844ML,"This movie simultaneously introduces me to Besson and puts me off him forever. Why the overbearing music ? I was so sick of it that I muted the TV after 15 minutes and switched a stream of 20th century classical instead, and it was much more appropriate. That's just shameful. Why does he spin the camera around like we're in the middle of a dryer ?
At the half-hour mark, there was a shot reminiscent of the opening of Solyaris. Having been provided with this fortuitous inspiration, I removed Atlantis from my DVD player and watched Solyaris instead. It eased the pain.",1055203200,9,571,4.607843137254902
1827359,5,B0000844ML,"I saw this film in the theaters.  I was a die-hard Besson fan from La Femme Nikita and The Big Blue -- two movies that got me into the film business.  When I saw Atlantis in the theater I was one of five people in the audience.  We were all awe-struck.  Besson must've angered the head of the studio that released it because it vanished soon after.  He had spent two years traveling the world (Besson's an avid diver and grew up in Greece where his parents were divers) and photographing the incredible images in this picture.  I actually found a French VHS that i had for a while, then got a LaserDisc via Hong Kong, and people used to come to my house, watch it and beg me to tape it for them.  Lucky divers around the world have a couple bootleg copies they were grateful to receive.  So when my laserdisc player barfed, i could no longer watch it.  So now its finally coming out on DVD.  Well if you can't gather my opinion from what i've already written, not much more will help.  If you're interested in the ocean -- or just want something to put on in the background to calm you down after a long day -- this is it.  But watch Atlantis the first time very carefully.  It's all about the last scene to find meaning in what Besson was getting at in this gorgeous visual underwater opera, and i think it's point is as poignant as the DVD's arrival is exciting.",1045958400,24,1364,4.24031007751938
1827360,5,B0000844ML,"I am so pleased to finally be able to watch this on DVD. I remember seeing the movie's origianl release in France in 1991 and being amazed by Luc Besson's brillant camera work and vision. Set, as usual, to Eric Serra's music, there is no comparable underwater film.",1045872000,7,265,4.541666666666667
1827361,5,B0000844ML,"At last. Long had I heard rumors of the magnificence of Luc Besson's ATLANTIS, but found nary a showing in the years since becoming enamored with the serene moments of Besson's THE BIG BLUE. [The DVD's release date] couldn't have arrived too soon.

ATLANTIS is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a French Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtrack. English subtitles are optional for the opening prologue. Chapter-title cards display only in French, but a printed insert lists the chapter breaks in English. Also included are the trailers for this and one other Besson film. What's notably (and thankfully) NOT included is a voice-over narration beyond the prologue. Press Chapter Next to skip even that much, and move on to:

[1] premier jour / Start
[2] la lumire / The Light
[3] l'esprit / The Spirit
[4] le mouvement / The Movement
[5] le jeu / The Game
[6] la grce / The Grace
[7] la nuit / The Night
[8] la foi / The Faith
[9] la tendresse / The Tenderness
[10] l'amour / The Love
[11] la haine / The Hatred

[12] la naissance / The Birth

ATLANTIS is a pleasure-piece of a documentary, marveling at and frolicking with the undersea creatures. No soapbox or proselytizing, Besson and company had a good time making the film and pass that right along. Eric Serra's score runs from typical, if familiar with his work, to stunning. The score gladly steps aside for the chattering of dolphins, penguins, and sealions, however. Sound editing and foley crews are allowed to shine, in fact, with some of the best humor (school's out and the manatee snicker come to mind). The little bumps against the camera are fun but don't distract from the majestic, operatic rays, rubbing shoulders with dolphin buddies, or thousands of little moments, such as the coral fans bowing in the ""wind"".

Of parental concern: No orcas toss any cute critters about. One reef-shark feeding frenzy, but very mild (tag, keepaway flavor). Close-ups of the great whites might be scary, and you could have a bit of fun explaining portions of L'amour (nothing graphic).

Credits roll with a pictoral cast list in French of the featured performers, beginning with les dauphins.

Highly recommended.",1045440000,7,2181,4.846774193548387

7979121,5,B0000844ML,This movie is a visual feast that can be best appreciated in context of when it was filmed. In today's modern era of digital cameras and advanced diving equipment it becomes easy to forget the challenges and technical difficulties it took to film this a mere quarter century ago!,1356912000,,279,4.714285714285714
7979122,5,B0000844ML,"One of the old Besson movies - an ocean documentary which any person who loves sea, should see. An underwater opera gala out of this world - the combination of great music and fantastic cinematography is stunning. Hypnotic and joyous.",1294617600,,234,4.875
7979123,1,B0000844ML,"This Blu Ray was made in England, for region B only. No warning about this fact, in this site. Amazon omitted to do it. I bought the Blu ray and had to give back it because my Blu ray player is not multiregion.",1286409600,4,210,3.9069767441860463
7979124,3,B0000844ML,Unfortunately the wonderful images didn't survive the time (original in 1991). But there are splendid scenes. Manta ray dance with Maria Callas' voice is unforgettable.,1179100800,,168,5.76
7979125,5,B0000844ML,"If you like underwater scenes and music you will love this movie. Its so relaxing to watch and its full of spectacular underwater scenes of dolphins,manta rays,whales,and lots more. I highly recommend this DVD its wonderful.",1173744000,,224,5.25
7979126,5,B0000844ML,"""Forget one by one the everyday sounds, all these noises, all these symbols of a life that has become modern, urban, the everyday sounds of glass and metal environment. Forget this asphalt that every day takes us faster, farther. Welcome to the world of Atlantis, the original world. A world that is magnificent, mysterious, harmonious. Man was born there. Man grew up and matured there, as a prince heir. He trained his senses in this world with no gravity--this world free of all chaos. The love, the tenderness, the rhythm, the grace, the spirit. Many gifts offered forever by that sea, beautiful and generous. Forget one by one the memories of our numerous generations. Forget everything you know. Dive. Dive a few million years earlier when life, the wonderful idea, was about to become a reality. . . .""

So says the narrator (in French, subtitled) at the beginning of this  beautifully filmed undersea documentary. Fortunately, that is the total dialogue in the film. The rest consists of 12 chapters, each of which is an undersea ballet set to atmospheric music (some electronic, some orchestral and choral) by Eric Serra. The action unfolds at a leisurely pace in cool shades of blue and green. It's a film that can provide instant stress relief. Except for the very end, all the photography is below the surface.

Creatures featured include dolphins, a sea serpent from New Caledonia, otters, iguanas, and penguins from the Galapagos, manta rays, a giant octopus, manatees, and sharks (including a great white and a whale shark).

My personal favorite part is titled ""The grace"" and features a trio of manta rays doing an underwater ballet to a live recording of Maria Callas singing ""Ah! non credea mirarti"" from Bellini's ""La Sonnanbula."" There is perhaps a tie-in with sleepwalking here, as the manta rays float by as in a dream. These are some of the finest images of these magnificent creatures I have seen. The next sequence features a giant octopus lazily floating through the seaweed. Again, highly unusual imagery with a telling effect.

It's best not to take the ""message"" of the opening narration too seriously. Better just to be carried away for a while into another world and marvel at some of the endless and wonderful forms that life has taken on planet Earth.

The DVD is in widescreen format (anamorphic), in French with English subtitles. Special features are minimal: Theatrical trailers only. Packaging and notes are likewise minimal. But the price is right. Recommended for lovers of underwater photography, soothing video, good cinematography, marine biology, and nature films in general.",1171152000,2,2620,5.025345622119816
7979127,3,B0000844ML,"A beautifully filmed piece, I did expect much more though, only watched it once and that was enough.",1168473600,,100,4.611111111111111
7979128,4,B0000844ML,"It's like a personal aquarium. I love to play it on repeat on my big-screen tv as I fall asleep gasing into the ocean. Sometimes I mute it because the music is kind of tacky. I love sharks and orcas, therefore I enjoyed Luc's footage. -1 star because I hate dolphins (Reasons of Hating Dolphins are the same as of Cartman of S.Park)",1168387200,,332,4.285714285714286
7979129,4,B0000844ML,"Of course the cinematography is stunning, with some segments more moving than others.  The rays are incredible, and there is something for everyone with the dolphins, sharks, wrecks and the music is pretty nice, too.

We watched it with people of all ages and it was nice - something you can watch a few times then keep on in the 'background' - even could be a good background video for a mellow party, an event or fundraiser!  Ocean-based, of course.",1168300800,,451,4.6125
