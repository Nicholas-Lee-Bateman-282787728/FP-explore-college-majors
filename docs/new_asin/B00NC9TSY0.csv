6639310,2,B00NC9TSY0,"Contains a plot spoiler you will quickly figure out anyway if you ever watched a sci-fi anything.

Calvin (David S. Hogan) and his fiancee Abby (Angela DiMarco) pick up her sister Rebecca (Kate Alden) so they can scatter their mom's ashes at their old A-frame cabin, maintained quite well. We immediately find out about the secret incident that caused Rebecca to have psychological problems...or least the cover story as we pretty much know what is going on by the DVD cover as aliens are involved. Calvin finds a mysterious orb which he keeps with him...one that sticks both him and Abby.

This is basically a three person play which drags on as a low budget production of Rosemary's Alien. It has some of that 90's sci-fi sound track, as it starts out fairly decent building character, establishing the story, and then staying on the path of boredom.

Guide: F-bomb. Sex. No nudity.",1419120000,13,884,4.802631578947368
6639311,1,B00NC9TSY0,"A satire of COMMUNION, okay, but swerving from a Lifetime Channel story of the dangers of underage sex to the dangers of picking up little spheres in the woods?  Makes you wish North Korea would hack this studio.  The cover art shows Matrix-like tubes coming off the lovely actress' back, but that never appears in the movie itself.  One actress is even shown reading COMMUNION while she sits in a chair waiting for rubber-suited aliens to arrive from deleted scenes from FIRE IN THE SKY.  Well, I maybe should give it 5 stars for a student film, over-acting, micro-budget, and exercising my eyes with constant rolling up and down.  As a rape drama it just uses stage blood, sharp nails, and Halloween costumes to compete with SIGNS.  Spoilers anyone?  The actresses are cute.",1419120000,2,776,4.7894736842105265

this movie is just  OK....the cast was wrong....

6639313,4,B00NC9TSY0,"The Device is a beautiful movie. Having spent my teen years in the 90's with Mulder and Scully I really love alien stories that focus less on the actual alien and more on the people and surroundings. The acting is solid and the slow but constant build of tension in the movie leads to a lot of genuinely creepy moments.

This is not a big movie. If you're looking for Alien or Independence Day you will not find it here. If the X-Files and Twilight Zone it's more your speed then The Device is right up your alley.",1418688000,13,514,4.244897959183674
6639314,2,B00NC9TSY0,"CONTAINS SPOILERS:  This film is better quality than most lame movies.  If it was a low budget flick, I think I could actually give it a passing grade.  This film tries to be much better than it actually is.

Calvin, girlfriend Abby, and her sister Rebecca find a sphere while at ""the cabin"" to scatter the ashes of the girl's deceased mother.  Set in liberal Seattle (you can tell by the Prius' [(Is plural of Prius Preii?)].  Rebecca was impregnated by aliens years earlier.  Now Abby finds herself pregnant by the same aliens.

I really wanted to like this.  In fact, I stopped it and started it up again.  The editting is actually good and the direction seems to be okay.  The script and story, however, just do not do sci-fi justice.  Some who watch this may disagree and that's their prerogative.  But I watch a lot of science fiction and expect a great deal of bang for my buck.  This HAD potential.  Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to it.",1454198400,,948,4.4941176470588236
6639315,1,B00NC9TSY0,"As a movie it was a joke, mainly on the viewer. The cover picture is a deceptive creation to lure you into watching it, but the actual movie doesn't have anything close to what is on the cover if you were expecting an alien or creature in the film.

6639317,1,B00NC9TSY0,"Watched at least half of it at 2x speed with sound, after falling asleep half way through. I would suggest watching it at the speed of light or warp speed if possible, that way you save yourself the frustration, boredom and sleep inducing snooze fest that is the Device.

If you want something kind of scary with aliens, decent acting, decent plot, and great atmosphere you'll think this is great. That's where the movie really shines, the atmosphere.",1432425600,,355,5.033898305084746

6639326,4,B00NC9TSY0,"This is a good film, I don't know why the reviews are so poor. Im guessing its because this is not a conventional alien movie with ships and lazers.

6639328,2,B00NC9TSY0,"The concept had potential but the story developed much too slowly and I fell asleep before a less than stunning ending.

6639331,1,B00NC9TSY0,"This sucked. There is no other way to say it. The plot is cliche to the point where there is ZERO originality. The acting is bad, although the actress who portrayed the younger of the two sisters was OK. The script is a joke, seriously. The dialogue was painful at times. 95% of this movie focuses on the 3 characters and 5% features Aliens. Even if you flip that stat, this movie would still be boring because the aliens were boring. The most action we see from them is standing up or standing over people.
I'm all for Indy Horror, but this movie just brought nothing worth watching to the screen.",1424476800,,598,4.396396396396397
6639332,4,B00NC9TSY0,"Pros:  Music score is superb - understated, suspenseful, eerie. Cinematography was good.  The acting, especially by the two women, was better than average.  The tone of the film is quietly creepy.

Cons:  Character development and dialogue leave something to be desired at times and I found myself asking, ""Why did s/he say that?""  There are some minor pacing flaws here and there but the story recovers quickly and moves along.  Cover art is unfortunate, as it has nothing whatever to do with the movie.

All things considered, I have to say I really liked this film. Despite criticisms that it offered nothing new in terms of plot, The Device is a worthy sophomore effort from a fledgling Indie film company that shows tremendous potential to make thought-provoking, suspenseful films in the Alfred Hitchcock tradition.  I look forward to seeing more and watching them grow.",1423612800,9,876,5.027777777777778

6639335,1,B00NC9TSY0,"This is a movie with very little plot, poor special effects and little else. The actors seem like participants in a community theater production. The best part of the dvd is probably the misleading cover art. The device turns out to be a little ball which does nothing but seems to have an effect on those near it. Ther are pleanty of better independent movies than this one. Save your money and search elsewhere.",1421366400,,413,4.594594594594595
6639336,2,B00NC9TSY0,"By all rites this should be a one star B flick, but the acting was very good.  There wasn't much of a plot.  The same old alien abduction tale, but don't tell anyone.  The storyline was very slow and dull and the ending failed to deliver.  Actually the ending almost seemed like a cop out by a director and writer who didn't know how to end the film.  The device was a black ball that didn't do anything.  The cover was good and the acting fine, but the story, directing, writing was very dull and hurt a standard plot used many times.  Not really worth a watch unless you need something to pass the time.",1421280000,,605,4.208695652173913
6639337,4,B00NC9TSY0,"Embrace it for what it is. ""The Device"" is a sci-fi themed psychological thriller. The cover is pure marketing and has nothing to do with the film, but the movie itself is worth the watch on its own merit. The story re-unites two sisters now in different places in their lives, one a recluse still recovering from a traumatic event from her past, the other planning a life and future with her finance.

Following the discover of a small, black-metallic object in the woods, hallucinations and hidden past details come to light and the three soon find themselves at odds with each other in more ways than one. I won't spoil the story any further other than to say I was glad I put the cover out of my mind and focused on the film rather than the marketing. Good stuff here that many Sci-fi buffs will enjoy, and a character-driven, subtle approach to the genre that is rare these days. Recommended.",1421107200,9,897,4.537037037037037
6639338,2,B00NC9TSY0,"Ugh - I wish I could get those hours of my life back. This movie was slow and not very original, and the ending was very unsatisfying and unfulfilling. The characters, at least, were interesting enough for me to care about their lives, and the movie made good use of a painfully low budget (i.e. the few FX on offer looked convincing), but that's about all I can say for this movie.

With a name like ""the Device"", I was really hoping for something more than a smooth black orb that never does anything really interesting - I pictured  a machine that conveyed some awesome power in exchange for a terrible price. Instead....well, before I say, I will throw up a:

***SPOILER ALERT***

Still here?

It's a bloody homing beacon for aliens to come and take you away. That's it. Soooo boring and disappointing.",1420675200,2,806,4.569444444444445
6639339,2,B00NC9TSY0,"Boring as hell.
Strong acting, plot so sloooooooooowly evolved that you find yourself nodding off.
All the action in the Entire movie takes place in about 4  30 second snippets broken with flash images.
The other 80 minutes or so you are waiting for Something to happen.
Acting was good but otherwise, this horror flick is sleep inducing save for the aforementioned 2 minutes of actual action pretty much trashed by flash imagery.

Plot - a few SPOILERS- (there really isn't a plot to describe without them).

Couple and sister in law go to lake from childhood - sister in law later realizes she was ""drawn"" there.
In a hole clearly dug in the ground ""crash site"" is an eight ball with the 8 missing.
They take it home with them and each of them is affected strangely by it and old memories surface.
The device has very odd properties.
Bad things happen.

Unfortunately, my synopsis is about as riveting as the movie.
To wait all that time for only seconds of actual action is frustrating.
To have the action broken by flash imagery is simply irritating....

....and that is likely how you will feel if you make it to the end of this film.

6639341,1,B00NC9TSY0,"I bought this at walmart. Impulse buy. Saw the cover thought, oh this looks neat. Looked at the back, has a pic of a city enveloped by some big pulse, pavement buildings and cars being destroyed with an Alien in the center. Was sold.
Take it home. Watch it. Horrible. The alien on the back. Nothing like the aliens in the movie. The ""device"". A black ball. That does nothing. Literally nothing. It glows once. And defys gravity for like 2 seconds but Thats about it. Drives a guy crazy to deliver his prego raped wife to the aliens. Bright lights. End of story. Thats it. Literally. The cover? The short haired girl, nobody in the movie has hair that short, tubes n such, nonexistent in the movie. The ball on the cover looks more interesting than the ball in the movie if that tells u anything. Almost want to take it back BC the front and back cover r such RIP OFF LIES as to the boringness of this hr and a half movie that took a total of 4 actors, 5 including someone's voice, a Dr for a quick second, and maybe 7 actors if u include the naked aliens that touch someone's stomach and stare. BC u know. An advanced alien race is gonna b naked, all look alike, and broadcast their presence by having a mini sun of a light follow them wherever they go.
The covers make it look like a cool alien invasion mystery thriller. What u get is a cheap made movie with "" meh"" acting including a decently made alien costume, if it weren't for the fact they barely move. Description, ""the device has plans for us, this world is no longer ours""....yeah were pretty much fine. It affects all of 1 person. If it weren't for the ending "" whoops I forgot to load the gun ive been toting around for 10 minutes, and heaven forbid I use a cell phone"" the aliens probably could have been beaten. But alas. No. Woman bleeds out after the alien starts drooling to take his 3 day conceived rape baby back. Credits.
Yeah I ruined the movie for you.
No its not a loss to u.
I sacrificed my time to warn you good people not to waste yours. BC if u watch this. It will b a waste.
Wanna watch something that mess u up and make u think about stuff? Look up ""the begotten"" and watch it on YouTube. Will stay with u for life if u find the right thing.
Peace be with you.",1420156800,2,2240,4.175519630484988

But unfortunately this is a micro budget production with only a handful of actors. And while the story does focus on aliens and nasty things that they are up to (although it's all a bit vague, really) this is a story about a single family and their experiences. It does drag a bit all the way through although I did not feel that I needed to reach for the fast forward on the remote.... The acting is pretty good which does help things along.

Rather, it is a psychological drama that is much more subtle in its approach to the alien abduction lore, and is one that unfolds via a steadily focused dramatic lens. It's a shame that many have been misled by any of the marketing efforts of the distributors, as I feel that others might come to appreciate the homages to ""The X-Files"" or FIRE IN THE SKY if they knew to expect more of a subdued story.",1455494400,,575,4.538461538461538
