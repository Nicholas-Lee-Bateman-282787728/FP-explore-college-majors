7926654,5,B00004Y56V,This second 2 tape installment of this captivating anime series starts 4 years after the first one and brings the story to an amazing climax!,994291200,,141,4.68
7926655,5,B00004Y56V,"To the wonderful animation that IS 3x3 Eyes.
Thank God for re-releasing this excellent series after the former distributor went out of business. 3x3 is one of the best anime series I have ever seen.
The animator, Yuzo Takada is excellent... noted for other classics like Nuku Nuku and Blue Seed. The animation is not only excellent, but so is the storyline.
Pai, a young girl with a strange third eye (that she can't control yet) is the last of her race. She meets up with the young boy Yakumo and asks him to help her grant her wish to become human.
It seems so simple at first... find a statue... do some incantations and viola! BUT... trouble arises when the statue is stolen, and they've got some big baddies to face off against.
The perfect mix of blood, gore and love story! It moves at a great pace, and all of the characters are interesting. The music is excellent, and the movie has a very dark feel to it (although you somehow can't help but believe everything is going to be turning up daisies in the end ^_^)
I reccomend to all!",986428800,3,1040,4.393782383419689
7926656,5,B00004Y56V,"3x3 Eyes is one of the most captivating Anime series I have ever seen.  This anime features a beautiful, girlish Demon-Girl and an Invincible average school student.
Imagine, you get run over by a bus, crushed under a falling bridge, ripped into pieces by demon monsters...but just keep coming back?
This gripping tale keeps you on the edge of your seat and I highly recommend it to any anime lover.",982713600,,399,4.7
