2474996,3,B000CZ0PW6,"As a veteran ""W&G Head"" (first discovered them around almost 15 years ago now?), I'd seen all of these already, and already owned the 3 adventures on DVD and Cracking Contraptions via internet download (how they were originally distributed).  But I still jumped at the chance to get an all-in-one ""Complete W&G"" as this DVD set represents.  However the fact that they offer Curse only in full frame (not original widescreen) puts me off.  You have to understand (and if you have seen the half hour BBC special with Nick Park on W&G you should), each and every 1/30th second frame took minutes or hours to compose, and therefore there were plenty of opportunities taken to put in sight gags that you might not even notice in the theater, without stepping through the frames closely (if you've never done that with he museum break-in scene in The Wrong Trousers, you should!)  The idea of taking the fully composed widescreen shots for Curse of the WereRabbit and chopping chunks off each side ... how silly.  If you can't get the *complete* movie in this set, should it really be called a Collector's Edition?

The value is great, but if you truly are a Collector you'll just have to knuckle down & spend more money to get the unedited Curse separately",1139961600,10,1251,4.689497716894977
2474997,1,B000CZ0PW6,I never thought the Collector's Set would be fullframe! I'm be returning this today and buying them separately.,1139875200,8,111,5.222222222222222
2474998,5,B000CZ0PW6,"I won't type a lengthy review. I second what everyone else has already said - W&G are verly loveable and endearing characters. Everything about these films is top notch - the writing, the animation, the characters, etc.

I had the original W&G shorts all on VHS. If I remember correctly they were about $12-15 each when I bought them.

In this package you get not only The Curse of the Were-Rabbit and the original three shorts but a bunch of worthwile extras. All this for less than I paid for three VHS copis of just the shorts.",1139875200,2,530,4.453608247422681
2474999,1,B000CZ0PW6,"I agree with all the others, PLEASE offer ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" in its original Widescreen.  The ""Three Amazing Adventures"" are correctly 4:3 in Fullscreen, but the movie and all the hardwork that was put into it deserves to be all visible, and enjoyed in the way it was made.  I guess I have to buy both titles separately...",1139184000,22,334,4.55
2475000,5,B000CZ0PW6,"I agree that you can't get a better bargain than this 2-CD set, but the format above is listed as ""full screen"", and Amazon is not listing any 2-CD set with the same content and a widescreen version of the feature film. Why not????????????????",1137715200,43,243,4.545454545454546
2475001,5,B000CZ0PW6,"Wallace & Gromit 2 DVD Cracking Collector's Set is a real bargain for all wensleydale fans!! This cracking dvd set contains ""Three amazing adventures"" and the latest full length feature ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"". Both of these titles are available separately too but this is a great bargain for those who are yet to bring wallace and gromit home!

PLEASE BE AWARE, THIS SET INCLUDES THE FULLSCREEN EDITION OF THE FILM ""CURSE OF THE WERERABBIT""! OTHER THREE WALLACE AND GROMIT SHORTS WHICH APPEAR ON THE OTHER DISC WERE FILMED IN FULLSCREEN ASPECT ONLY!

WALLACE AND GROMIT IN THREE AMAZING ADVENTURES:

Wallace and gromit and its creator Nick park need no introduction. these 3 wallace and gromit films, involving wallace and his faithful and brainy dog gromit, turned out to be a global phenomenon, not to mention those three well deserved academy awards Nick park won for his exceptional talent in claymation!! All three wallace and gromit films (""a grand day out"", ""the wrong trousers"" and ""a close shave"") were nominated for oscars with the latter two actually winning it. Not to mention here, the rare distinction Nick park enjoys, being the only animator whose two films (""a grand day out"" and ""creature comforts"") were nominated in the same category, same year with ""creature comforts"" winning!! ever since, these films have won Nick park and aardman studios countless awards the world over. By far wallace and gromit remains the best claymation work ever not just for its amazing quality of animation but for the equally marvelous storytelling and emotinal depth it has!

Wallace and gromit has seen 2 dvd releases in US so far. the first one being a fox release and the second one from warner bros which had a great amount of extras on the same disc. Both these dvds are out of stock now and are extremely hard to get.

Thanks to dreamworks, those who missed out on the previous two dvds have a reason to cherish now. Once again, all three wallace and gromit films will be available on dvd. here's what you can look forward to in this release:

1. All three wallace and gromit films (including ""A GRAND DAY OUT"", ""THE WRONG TROUSERS"" and ""A CLOSE SHAVE"" with English 2.0 dolby digital surround and French 2.0 mono)

2. never before on dvd 10 cracking contraptions, involving wallace and gromit-

the soccomatic
the telescope
the autochef
the snoozatron
the turbo diner
the bullyproof vest
the 525 crackervac
a christmas cardomatic
the snowmanotron
shopper 13
(few of the above said films were available on the net for quite sometime)

3. wallace and gromit:the curse of the wererabbit- sneak preview of the acclaimed wallace and gromit first feature film.

4. cracking contraptions-behind the scenes

5. shorts....and more
Please be informed, this disc does contain all three highly acclaimed wallace and gromit shorts, however, all the great behind the scenes and other extra stuff which was available on the old warner disc is missing here.

CURSE OF THE WERERABBIT:

""Wallace & Gromit:Curse of the wererabbit"" is the highly anticipated first full length feature involving Wallace and his brainy canine companion Gromit. Its a dream come true for all the fans around the world who have been expecting their favourite characters on silver screen for a long time.

In ""Curse of the wererabbit"", a vegetable guzzling ""monster' is on the verge of spoiling the giant vegetable competition organised by Lady Tottington and only wallace and gromit can save the day now. Nick Park has remained faithful to the characterisations and followed the same trend which w&g is known for. New adventure, few more amazing inventions, more new characters, new circumstances, more suspense but same old British flavour, feel and charm...W&G first feature is surely a winner. Those familiar with ""King Kong"", ""Jaws"" and other Hitchcock films will enjoy the spoof and occasional references more!

Wallace & Gromit:Curse of the wererabbit disc will be loaded with all these extras:

1. English & French DD5.1 Surround
2. English & Spanish DD2.0 Stereo
3. English SDH, English, French and Spanish subtitles

2475002,5,B000CZ0PW6,"Gromit, faithful, sacrificing, long-suffering pet dog of inventor extraordinaire and cheese freak, Wallace, solves the mystery of the Were-Rabbit, and along the way we laugh our heads off.  Frankly, I don't want to know how they animate these films, how they produce the subtle facial and body expressions of the characters, how they come up with the outrageous, delightful story lines, or how they write the double entendre dialogue that plays perfectly for children and adults alike.  It would spoil the fun of falling into the weird world of Wallace & Gromit.  This bizarre and hilarious film is complemented in this boxed set by ""Three Amazing Adventures"" (my favorite being about a trip to the Moon to have a vacation devoted totally to cheese -- green, of course) and 10 shorts that focus on Wallace the Inventor in all his glory.

It's worth it to own the DVDs, because there is so much going on that you could not hope to catch all the jokes, visual and verbal, the first, or even the second time around.

It is perfectly clear why ""The Were Rabbit"" won an Oscar this year.  Truly entertaining!",1144022400,5,1102,4.7434554973821985
2475003,4,B000CZ0PW6,"This would have been a five star review if the fact that the feature (The Curse of the Were-Rabbit)was panned & scanned (full screen)would have been mentioned in the title.

Both the feature and the shorts are great Wallace & Gromit fun. Were-Rabbit is the best yet, and it even had some twists that I wasn't expecting. In the tradition of the Muppets and Loony Tunes, Aardman has peppered adult in-jokes in with the all ages fun, so Mom and Dad will stay interested and the kids won't get it for years.

As with Chicken Run, the focus of the commentary is on how long each shot takes to make. Yes, claymation is time consuming. We get it.

Recommended for people who do not want a wide-screen presentation. I'm giving my copy to my In-Laws.",1142553600,8,741,4.474074074074074
2475004,5,B000CZ0PW6,"Great shorts and movie!  Wallace and Gromit display the best of British humour and creativity!  My grandchildren, along with my mother, enjoy the Wallace & Gromit 2 DVD Cracking Collector's Set so it's appeal is not limited to any age.",1142380800,,235,4.85
2475005,5,B000CZ0PW6,"I saw the shorts, saw the Oscar-winning film in the theater--and now I've seen all of the Cracking Contraptions.  Will look for more W&G DVD titles. They're so much fun, and you can watch them on a date night or with kids. . .and DVD does a great job of telling their story.

LOVE Wallace and Gromit.",1142380800,,300,4.245614035087719
2475006,5,B000CZ0PW6,"Nick Parks is a genius.  These are fun, interesting movies for young and old alike.  They even appeal to the car/motorcycle guy in me. Has anyone seen a Morris?  Or an old Triumph motorcycle?  Watch these movies to see old English machinery in clay!",1142294400,,249,4.590909090909091
2475007,5,B000CZ0PW6,"Fabulous DVD for all the family no matter what age.  Disney, look at Aardman for inspiration!  If you do buy this DVD please don't miss the ""Special Features"" they are so worth watching!",1142208000,,186,4.606060606060606
2475008,5,B000CZ0PW6,"Great DVD set-worth the money, lots of laughs. Good for kids, because the good guy always wins.",1141948800,,95,4.647058823529412
2475009,5,B000CZ0PW6,Wallace and Grommit are two of my favorite characters ever.  I am delighted to have the amazing adventures on DVD now (I had VHS previously).  Nick Park is so creative with language and images.  He tells stories that are charming and seem simple on the surface.  Adults can share them with their older children without worrying about young children seeing them. We watch the shorts with embarrassing frequency and share the Were-Rabbit with friends who aren't familiar with Park/ Aardman.  We were lucky enough to find some Wensleydale cheese (my favorite when I lived in London)to snack on when we saw WereRabbit!,1141948800,,614,4.980392156862745
2475010,5,B000CZ0PW6,"The definitive collection of the best claymation characters ever! Not only is the animation superb, the sets richly detailed (the floors visibly move and creak when the ""trousers"" walk) but the story lines and characters are better than most flesh and blood actors.

I particularly enjoy the earlier ""Cracking Contraptions"" for their unabashedly English sensibility. The ""were-rabbit"" is very good as well and more suited to a broader audience.",1141948800,,444,5.434782608695652
2475011,1,B000CZ0PW6,"Unfortunately this set as others have said is full screen only.  If you are a completist, and already have the original 3 adventures, the UK 2 disc-edition has the extras you're looking for.  For US audience, the documentaries are available as part of a 2 disc exclusive available at another retailer (Wal-Mart), the two discs being ""Curse of the Were Rabbit"" (full or widescreen) along with ""Gromit's Tail Waggin DVD"".  Contents of Gromit's Tail Waggin DVD:  ""10 Cracking Contraptions"", Making of the Were-Rabbit"", ""The Amazing World of Wallace & Gromit"", ""Gromit's Favorite Scenes"", ""Learn to Draw Gromit"", ""Gromit-Cam"", activity sheets.",1139961600,25,639,5.36

8102467,5,B000CZ0PW6,These movies are classic- fun for all ages.  I grew up watching them and now watch them with my niece!  They are her favorites!,1418860800,,127,4.25
8102468,5,B000CZ0PW6,"Two great films (OK, the three shorts in the one CD go together, but are not a film in themselves), plus some very interesting features included as bonus material. Definitely recommend this for all Wallace & Gromit fans!!",1249516800,,221,4.842105263157895
8102469,5,B000CZ0PW6,"We loved getting the packaged set of Curse of the W'ere Rabbit and the three Adventures of @W & G. They have been very fun movies to watch. We love how Gromit is so expressive, even though he doesn't say anything! His expressions and movements really make the humor and he is a good sidekick for Wallace. If you like humor, clean fun, and claymation animation, these are the movies for you!",1187827200,,390,4.430555555555555
8102470,5,B000CZ0PW6,This is such a great dvd set. My son loves it.  He can watch it over & overs.,1184976000,,77,3.2777777777777777
8102471,5,B000CZ0PW6,"Claymation walks the line between two-dimensional animation and real-world, three-dimensional stuff. And a delightful interface it is too. Wallace and Gromit are about as charming a twosome as anyone could dream up. That they are oh so British to boot only adds to the pleasure of watching the stories unfold. If you have seen a bit of claymation and what it can do or you are just curious to see what the buzz is all about, this collection is a great place to start. You get several different stories to play with and they are just as much fun the second time around. Very creative stuff indeed!",1167782400,,596,4.579439252336448
8102472,4,B000CZ0PW6,"I enjoyed them both, and I recommend them to those who enjoy what Wallace & Gromit do. But I felt that it wasn't as good as Chicken Run, which I also own, I think They needed a better story line up to the standard that was used in Chicken Run. Still I look forward to what else They will attemp to do.",1163030400,,301,3.870967741935484
8102473,5,B000CZ0PW6,An excellent set--with one purchase you can own all the Wallace and Gromit features.,1156636800,2,84,5.071428571428571
