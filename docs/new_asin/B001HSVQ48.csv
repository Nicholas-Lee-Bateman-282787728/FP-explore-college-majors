Michael Andropolis (Michael Douglas) is a world-class marathon runner. However, he has been so afraid of failing that he always quits things halfway through. In a previous Olympics trial, he discovered that another runner had a better qualifying time and dropped out of the trial. Now at 34, as his life lies in ruins around him, he makes another attempt at the olympics. However, his poor racing strategy in the qualifying trial gets him passed by 3 other runners at the end. (The top 3 make the olympics). However, the 3rd place qualifier breaks his leg at the end and Douglas's character gets to go instead. As he finally starts to deal with his life, he runs a smart race and is leading when he suffers an accident. But he now understands what he has to do and returns to the race (broken bones and all) to finish hours after everyone else. The film ends with him crossing the finish line - last, but victorious.
The movie has a hauntingly beautiful musical score which evokes ""the loneliness of the long-distance runner"". I so wish that I could get a copy of this in the US (or even just the soundtrack.)",1261526400,,1296,4.6147186147186146

Simple yet wonderful story about a marathon runner whose life has not lived up to expectations.  Given a chance to redeem himself a bit, he enters the Olympic Marathon.  Whether he wins or not isn't important.  Sometimes it is more important just to finish.",1230768000,,454,4.409638554216867
