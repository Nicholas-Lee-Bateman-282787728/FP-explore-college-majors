8060291,5,B0009GU9OM,"Mr. Moore is a great ambassador for the New Orleans style of drumming. This release together with his others are a great releases and i think Mr. Moore have done an awesome job getting the old school groove and soul out to the modern drum community !

Great work Stanton Moore.",1451865600,,277,4.431372549019608
8060292,4,B0009GU9OM,"the package came from very far away from here, so i`m happy that it came in time and that`s ok.",1362096000,,95,3.8
8060293,5,B0009GU9OM,"The best part of this DVD is watching and hearing Stanton Moore do his thing on the drums in the traditional New Orleans tradition - it's an instructional DVD, yes, but the ""instruction"" is more on a global scale (i.e. not a lot of details), but you can learn so much about what to do and what this music and drumming sounds like from this DVD - If you want more detailed instruction, get his book ""Take It To the Street."" - The entire songs of him playing drums with fellow are just a blast to watch and learn from!",1359504000,,516,4.17
8060294,5,B0009GU9OM,"This is great for all drummers.  Very informative, entertaining, and will help your playing regardless of your style.  I got mine for an incredible price, too.  I wish I had time to watch it more often.",1357257600,,202,4.555555555555555
8060295,2,B0009GU9OM,"This is a disappointment, especially for a DVD created in 2005. Instructional drumming videos (and later, DVDs) have been around for over 20 years, and even in the early years many products contained supplemental material to augment the visuals. Not on Moore's DVD. Essentially this is what each section is like:

Moore: ""Check out this groove"".
[Moore plays a semi-complicated New Orleans rhythm.]
Moore: ""Now you can play a variation on that groove like this.""
[Moore plays a further complicated New Orleans rhythm.]

Wash, rinse, repeat.

What this DVD needed was some PDFs with transcriptions of Moore's examples, that could be printed out and used to practice with. That way you could use the DVD for copping the feel of New Orleans drumming, and the PDF for the detailed parts. As noted, many instructional drumming videos are presented like this. The fact that this is made by Mel Bay makes it all the more disappointing (and surprising).

Of course, if one really wants to figure out what he's playing, it's not impossible. Get ready to use the rewind button on your remote though. Especially if you're a beginner.

I give it 2 stars because Moore's a decent player, and the live performances are good. As a learning tool though, I find it extremely limited and behind the times of current instructional videos.

If you want a comprehensive and extremely well made package on New Orleans drumming, buy the book ""New Orleans Jazz and Second Line Drumming"" by Johnny Vidacovich, Herlin Riley, and Dan Thress. You can augment that with the DVD the book was based on: ""New Orleans Drumming""",1255824000,13,1594,4.907063197026022
