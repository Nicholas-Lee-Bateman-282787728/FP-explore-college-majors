2274433,5,B0009A40NO,This is such a great play and such a great story plus it's outrageously funny. Brown was one of my faviorite characters in the Madea plays so this was a treat. The only thing missing....Madea.,1139011200,4,192,4.514285714285714
2274434,5,B0009A40NO,"LOVE IT SO MUCH, I WAS RENTING EVERY WEEK, UNTIL I DECIDED TO GO OUT AND BUY IT.  SIDE SPLITTING HUMOR THAT MAKES YOU SMILE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT SOME SCENES DURING THE WEEK.  WELL DONE AND GOOD CASTING AS USUAL.",1130371200,9,211,4.121951219512195
2274435,5,B0009A40NO,Very funny and very soulful play on the passing of Mr. Browns father.  Made in the Tyler Perry style this movie has great singing and touches on a lot of topics that many of us deal with.,1126569600,3,187,4.054054054054054
2274436,5,B0009A40NO,"The Browns could be my family all over again. The situations are

real and the solutions are easy but getting to the solutions is

the fun part of it. I must have Brown's tailor;s name. Really

Great",1124150400,3,199,4.324324324324325
2274437,5,B0009A40NO,"I enjoyed this play.  I enjoy all of Tyler Perry's plays with Madea, but this was different and focused more on Mr. Brown and it was good, but I also take it for what it is worth and appreciate the theme of God, family and love.",1123632000,,228,3.9565217391304346
2274438,5,B0009A40NO,"I enjoyed the entire show.  The Browns are a handful and they actually keep you guessing what will happen next.  My little sister loves all of the songs and has decided to buy a copy too.  I highly suggest this movie, if you are a fan of Madea.  It's hilarious!!!  I honestly didn't think it would be this funny without Madea, but they good.  Go out and buy it today!!

Can't stop laughing",1123113600,,389,4.2465753424657535
2274439,4,B0009A40NO,"At first I was skeptical of Meet the Browns because Madea was not in the play!!  However after watching the play the cast did an outstanding job!  It was hilarious, the songs we're uplifting and storyline flowed perfectly.  I'm thankful to Tyler for allowing the development of the Browns and it shows he has faith in the cast and he supports their talents.  Truly an excellent play!",1122940800,,383,4.6716417910447765
2274440,5,B0009A40NO,The Browns are a great example of a loving couple. They make it through the hard times and the good times. The Browns show that they truly depend on God like we all should. Most marriages don't seem to last today as long as they used too. I think all people can learn some great lessons from the Browns whether they are married or not. Marriage is a difficult thing and should not be taken lightly. The Browns also show us a good time with all the laughs that they bring throughout the play. Praise God for all of the people involved in Tyler Perry's plays and their willingness to share their talents and faith with the world!,1122940800,,627,4.322033898305085
2274441,5,B0009A40NO,"This play, to be completely honest, was one of the funniest that I have ever seen in my life.  I just can't stop watching it. It is a hoot!  Not only is it funny, but it ends with a very positive message, just as all of Tyler Perry's plays do.  It is amazing when you can mix comedy with Christian themality in order to portray a positive message here.

Essentially, after ""Pop Brown"" dies, the dysfunctional Brown family comes together to plan his funeral.  Through planning his funeral, many different problems and issues arise within the family including a lonely woman who ends up finding love, a woman torn up inside because of her murdered child along with a husband whom she has tensions with, a husband who has cheated on his wife, and three sibilings as well as the whole of the Brown family who in the end discover the importance of family.  I won't reveal anymore about the play because I want you to discover it and discover the wonderfulness of it for yourself.  Believe me, this play is a keeper as well as the other ones in the Tyler Perry Collection.

My only thing against MEET THE BROWNS (which is my favorite of Perry's collection) is that Madea isn't in it. However, you'll discover ""Brown"" as he is called steals the show!  5 stars easily.",1122595200,26,1260,4.491228070175438
2274442,5,B0009A40NO,"I saw the DVD of this play, and it was hilarious.  The first time I watched it, I almost hurt myself laughing at the whole Brown clan.  I love Madea, but Madea ain't got nuthin on Brown.

The family gathers to have a funeral for Pop Brown, and as many people know, funerals are filled with more drama than day-time televison.  There is cheating, unforgiveness, and jealousy.  At the center is the very lovable Brown and his daughter Cora.

David Mann and Tamela Mann are great in this play.  Not only do they showcase great acting ability, they can ""sang"" like it ain't nobody's business.  The rest of the cast are wonderful, and there are truly no weak links to this cast.

I could go on and on about how great this play is, but see it for yourself.  Get the DVD and not the bootleg.",1118707200,10,784,4.308219178082192
2274443,5,B0009A40NO,"I always get nervous when Madea/Tyler Perry isn't in the play, but as usual the cast pulled it off. The jokes were hilarious and the music was beautiful. Definitely glad that I have it in my collection!",1496793600,,202,4.486486486486487

If you like family and want to watch something with yours that is clean and hilarious, this is it. But again the end is over the top and I could have done without it.",1476835200,,376,4.013333333333334

I enjoyed it so much that I went back to the same store looking for other Tyler Perry plays. After purchasing the majority of his plays since that time, Meet The Browns is still my favourite ([[ASIN:B0009A40NY Tyler Perry's Madea's Class Reunion - The Play] is a close second].

Funny that I ordered it at Christmas and he laughed just as if he had never seen it before.  We thank God for the Manns and the entire cast.

2274563,5,B0009A40NO,"If you are a fan of Tyler Perry's work, you will not be disappointed with Meet the Browns!!!!  The storyline is good, but the acting and music are better.  David Mann is hilarious yet again as Brown.  His costumes evoke laughter before he even opens his mouth!!!! Once he does open his mouth however, the fun never stops. He is a phenomenal comedic actor.
  Tamela Mann is awesome in her role as Cora once again. Her Macy Gray song reference was hysterical!!! However, it is when she opens her mouth to sing about the Lord that my soul is both moved and blessed.  Why this dynamic woman of God and phenomenal singer is not the number one gospel singer in America is beyond me. When she sings I am transported to another time and place.  I forget about all that may be going on in my life and just allow myself to be blessed by the voice of Mrs. Tamela Mann.  I know that this review is for Meet the Browns, but if you have not bought her cd ""The Live Experience"" do yourself a favor and get it now!!!!
  The entire cast of Meet the Browns was excellent!!!  Joyce Williams, in my opinion steals the show as Browns sister-in-law.  She is awesome and I wish that she was in more movies.  She is very talented and the world should know who she is!!!!!",1186358400,2,1247,4.277777777777778

did NOT!!! prove to be as entertaining as the other shows.

2274568,5,B0009A40NO,"This play was funny!  I didn't think that I would like a play without Madea but I was wrong!

First of all, Mr. Brown is always funny, he bounces off of Madea and vice versa.  Cora takes up where Madea leaves with a gun in her purse.  The actors are all good singers and play their roles very well.

I especially loved the sister Vera who drinks throughout the play and is in love with the Reverend.  The scene that she has with her son who is a doctor is too funny.

This is a must see especially the song Will you love on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday et.  I loved this play!  All of the actors were wonderful.",1151712000,5,606,4.067796610169491
