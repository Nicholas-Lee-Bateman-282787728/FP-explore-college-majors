8071715,5,B000A0LE6Y,"This is one of the best Tango movies I've seen. It gives you the history of Tango from early 20th century to today. From Milonga to Classic to Modern sort of ballet. The music is outstanding and the acting is first notch. Listening to Raul Juli speaking, you do not notice any accent from his native Puerto Rico, as both countries have a very distinct accent and he had a full command of it. His tango dance with Valeria Lynch is a beautiful scene to watch.

I purchased a multi-zone  player in order to have this film. Even though it was released through Warner Label, they did not manufactured it for the American market in Zone 1. The rights were then sold to Force Video from Australia and it was lost for us in the colonies. Contacted all Argentinian video manufacturers and no luck. Best you can do is research for VHS as I think is available or purchase a Multi-zone player. There are a plethora of movies available in other zones and not in zone 1 that are very beautiful.

For the purist as I am, there are players for less than $100.00 in the market and Blue Ray for about $120.00 and up. A point to consider if you like European movies.",1399939200,,1147,4.350467289719626

it's Region 4 PAL.  I found good delivery to the UK and arrived in mint condition.
IF you can see it - do,  'Course you may need to be an Argentine tango afficionado/a
5 star worthy. An Amazon purchase.  Guess they're International.",1307836800,3,289,4.296296296296297
8071718,5,B000A0LE6Y,"I saw it in the VHS format, excellent music, dancing, plot, and  performance by all the cast especially Raul Julia.
A must see by Milongeros and Tango lovers.
It is a shame that it is not available in the USA Format.
This is truly a Collector's Item.

8071719,5,B000A0LE6Y,"This review is not from a DVD version. I have the VHS copy of the movie and is beautiful. It has everything: drama, romance, magnificent music, and fabulous dancing.

It is impossible to understand why the powers that be have not issue this marvelous movie in a Reg. 1 DVD. One could imagine that the US market should be apealing, however it is business and I really do not know what is going on.

In any case, if you have never watched the dance or are curious about it, watch this movie. You will never forget it. One word of caution: Tango is highly addictive.",1125878400,13,563,4.352380952380952
