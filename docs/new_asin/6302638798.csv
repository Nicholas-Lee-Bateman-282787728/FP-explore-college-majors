7828407,1,6302638798,"U.S. President #35, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, was murdered by one man (Lee Harvey Oswald) in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. Most Americans fail to believe that only Oswald was responsible for the President's assassination, which I shall never fully understand since every scrap of physical evidence (and nearly all of the circumstantial evidence as well) revolving around this murder points to Oswald's singular guilt in the President's killing.

The 90-minute program on this VHS videotape, entitled ""Beyond 'JFK': The Question Of Conspiracy"", is sort of an extension of Oliver Stone's 1991 feature motion picture (""JFK""). This documentary, like the movie, is filled with all kinds of conspiracy theories and hidden Dealey Plaza assassins. And there's no shortage of finger-pointing either, with regard to the $64,000 ""Who Was Responsible?"" question. The only problem is: Not a grain of PROOF is unearthed in either this documentary program or in the film to support any of the pro-conspiracy theories being placed on the table. (But, naturally, a little thing called ""The Lack Of Hard Evidence"" won't stop such unsupported theories from being spouted by some individuals. And that's truly a shame.)

According to most conspiracy theorists (""CTers""), including moviemaker Oliver Stone, one of the biggest stumbling blocks for the ""Lone Assassin"" crowd to overcome is the ""Single-Bullet Theory"". But what most CTers fail to do after they attempt to rip the ""SBT"" to pieces is to ""replace"" it with any kind of a reasonable alternative conspiratorial scenario of their own, which would fit both the evidence and any semblance of ""common sense"". In my opinion, such a ""CT Replacement"" for the SBT is not possible (when any amount of logic and common sense are attached to such a conspiracy-favoring theory).

Because.........

1.) Any non-""Single-Bullet"" theory that is put forth by conspiracists MUST include a minimum of THREE separate bullets striking the two victims in the Presidential limousine (JFK and Texas Governor John Connally) -- with all of these various bullets (incredibly) getting lost all by themselves or having all of them scooped up by evil plotters in a hurry and tossed in a trash can someplace. Sound logical to anybody?

2.) Any non-""Single-Bullet"" theory must have THREE different shooters injuring two separate victims with bullets that strike the two victims in a very-nearly perfect ""SBT""-like wound arrangement (close enough to make the SBT a viable alternative later on, per the Warren Commission's Arlen Specter, et al).

What do you suppose the odds are of having three bullets from three guns all being fired at virtually an exact moment in time (given the Zapruder Film timing of the shooting), and having all three bullets line up nicely enough to ""fool"" the Warren Commission members, and also having NOT ONE of these bullets enter the official record in the case?

Because, per the most widely-accepted version of events postulated out of whole cloth by the CT side, only the ""planted"" CE399 stretcher bullet (found inside Parkland Hospital) enters the official record re. this SBT shot, which is a bullet that most CTers say never even touched JFK or JBC on 11-22-63.

That leaves at least three other ""Magic Disappearing Bullets"" for CTers to reconcile the existence of. And they have no choice but to attempt to reconcile this laughable theory by claiming that three (or even more) bullets which entered the two victims somehow all vanished into thin air, or were swept under the carpet by a group of evil plotters. (Think a jury'll buy it? I know I'd be perspiring quite a bit if I was a lawyer who had to face a jury with such unsupported nonsense.)

3.) The odds are incredibly low of having TWO bullets from TWO different high-powered weapons enter JFK's soft flesh, strike NO BONES or hard substances within his body at all, and yet only proceed a few inches into his body and simply stay there, until they are plucked out by that ever-efficient band of evil conspirators. Either that, or both bullets just conveniently fell out of Mr. Kennedy's back AND neck, and then got lost on their own. ~cue a belly laugh here~

4.) Another thing to consider (which perfectly corresponds with just one single bullet going through both men) is the fact that very, very few fragments of any bullets were recovered from either JFK or JBC. Odds please IF there were in fact THREE or more different bullets entering the two men?

5.) Every scrap of bullet (and bullet shell) evidence in the entire case can be traced back to Lee Harvey Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano rifle and only that one weapon. What are the odds of this occurring if there were several OTHER guns responsible for the victims' wounds? This includes, of course, the two large fragments found in the front seat of the limousine, which is bullet evidence that perfectly corresponds with the scenario of the head shot coming from behind and coming from only Oswald's rifle.

Therefore, when you factor in ALL of the ""Oswald-Only"" bullet evidence (and not just the ""SBT"" shot), this even further increases the high improbability of multiple non-Oswald guns causing ANY wounds to the victims.

And relying on the usual CT argument of ""All Or Most Of The Evidence Was Faked And/Or Manipulated, So We Can Never Be Sure Of Anything"" is a standard cop-out that IMO gets worn out in a hurry and is an excuse I'm sick of hearing being spouted by CTers. It's the type of argument that is resorted to when there is no other kind of ""evidentiary"" argument to make (which is why CTers make such claims of ""evidence tampering"" and stuff being ""planted"" all over Dallas -- because the physical evidence is NOT on the CT side; it's all on the ""Oswald Did It"" side instead).

Can any CTer provide the name of even ONE person who said they witnessed any of these many bullets being plucked from the victims and disposed of? Of course they cannot. Because no such cloak-&-dagger nonsense was performed on the President in the first place. But, obviously, CTers NEED such ""digging out of non-Oswald bullets"" in order for any of their conspiracy plots to stand a chance of being accepted.

And yet many conspiracy advocates actually seem to think that THAT kind of utter guesswork that has been engaged in by CTers is supposed to be deemed MORE truthful and MORE reliable than what the Warren Commission had published for all to read in its Final Report. Pfftt!!

And -- Paranoid conspiracy believers seem to also think that the CT-invented hocus-pocus (with nary a person to place in the witness box to validate the claims), is also supposed to be MORE credible than what has been said by respected scientists and physicians worldwide, who have backed-up the SBT and the Lone-Assassin conclusion. Why the sworn testimony of multiple doctors and investigators (who certainly know more about this stuff than 95% of all Americans do) is tossed aside by CTers is anyone's guess. (I guess an amateur ""CT sleuth"" must know WAY more than some Nobel Prize-winning scientist...right?) ~eyeroll~

The odds of that complicated ""CT version"" of the shooting actually succeeding are probably so low as to be considered totally impossible. (Not to mention how laughably-stupid-sounding it is, to boot.)

If he'd been given the opportunity, former prosecuting attorney Vincent T. Bugliosi would have mopped up the courtroom with the mountain of wholly-unsubstantiated and unsupportable CT claims that have surfaced in the JFK case. Vince would have been able to thoroughly debunk each conspiracy theory with relative ease -- mainly due to the fact that ""common sense"" is ALL on Vincent's ""LN"" side in most of these arguments (not to mention the fact that ALL of the physical evidence in the entire case tells us that Oswald is guilty and guilty alone). Whereas only things like ""Unsupported Theories"", ""Pure Guesswork"", and ""Craziness"" seem to occupy the CT side of the courtroom.

In short -- If the Single-Bullet Theory is NOT the correct version of November 22nd events, then it's 100% certain that the ""multiple gunmen"" who were able to ""fake"" a pretty darn nice-looking ""Single-Bullet"" event pulled off the most spectacular and fantastically-impossible shooting feat that has ever occurred in the history of mankind -- in conjunction with THE most amazing ""cover-up"" and ""hide-the-bullets"" operation since the beginning of time.

I'd love it if a CTer could (believably) answer the following simple one-word inquiry regarding the above alleged conspiracy-slanted scenarios relating to the events of November 22nd, 1963 ---

7828408,5,6302638798,"Sorry to say, most of the other reviews on this movie don't tell it like it is.  I hope you can understand once you see the movie.
  Beyond JFK is an excellent tool to hear both sides of the JFK case. We hear from both conspiracy types as well as supporters of the lone gunman theory. However, by watching this, you definitely get the sense that something gravely out of the ordinary took place on 11/22/63. With both sides arguing it out, including some renound writers, such as Mark Lane, Jim Marrs, and others, with some eyewitness testimony from real people like Ed Hoffman, Jean Hill, Marita Lorenz, Beverly Oliver, Fletcher Prouty, etc., you feel like you're actually there.

  In this movie we see that JFK was definitely at odds with many in the gov't, CIA, Mafia, and Military. We also see signs of a cover up after his murder.

 This movie will heighten your awareness on many sidepoints of the JFK assassination. So, if you haven't even seen the movie-JFK, I highly recommend Beyond JFK as a remarkable learning tool. It is also a good follow up the Oliver Stone movie as well.
 If you're looking for other material to help you in your search for the truth, I highly recommend the video ""The Assassination of JFK"". 2 books I recommend are ""Plausible Denial"", by Mark Lane, and ""Murder In Dealey Plaza"", by James Fetzer Ph. D.
 This movie is definitely a real treat. Enjoy.",1004054400,12,1383,4.585365853658536
7828409,4,6302638798,"'Beyond JFK' is a video that all JFK conspiracy buffs must see. The main reason is that you finally see the real people that we have all been  reading about for years. Take Clay Shaw for example. Most of us have always  seen photos of him but in this video, there he is, big as life! In  addition, you will see interviews with the stars of 'JFK' by Stone and what  they have to say on the assasination. The video last approximately 90  minutes but I wished it were twice as long.",964137600,19,479,4.163043478260869
