8358041,3,B0029OMK62,"The content of the material is what was expected and thoroughly  enjoyed.  Only disappointment was on the DVD case described for sale (Knight with flag in background), instead item arrived in a clear CD case.  I thought this was a video taped version of Lt. Grossman's seminar rather than just an audio.",1386028800,2,303,4.788461538461538
8358042,5,B0029OMK62,"This is a great verbal introduction to Col. Grossman's work. I'm just a civilian who trains in ECQC a lot, not military/LEO. Essential for anyone who wants to develop the ""warrior mindset"", but not a substitute for stress-based training.
This set is available in CD format at North American Rescue Products for $96, worth every penny.",1319760000,2,334,4.982142857142857
8358043,5,B0029OMK62,"Let me just start off by saying that I have not seen this video. BUT, I have had the privilege of hearing Lt. Col. Grossman give this presentation in person. I have to say that as a Law Enforcement trainer for years, I have never seen a room of LEO's awake after a 4 hr. training session that kept you in your seat the entire time.

By the end of this 8hr. seminar by Mr. Grossman, every guy in the room was still sitting on the edge of there seat begging for more. It packed the biggest punch of any training I have ever had. Nothing else is even close. There really is no good way to describe it that would do it justice. It has the power to bring a whole new perspective to what we do.

I will go out on a limb and say that no other single trainig session will have as much impact as this masterpiece!",1290124800,6,804,3.987577639751553
8358044,5,B0029OMK62,"I have the DVD of this, but the description of the VHS matches exactly.  First, I am a board certified psychiatrist, and a former military officer.  LTC Grossman presents the most compelling, and inspirational, instruction I have ever witnessed.  If you are in law enforcement, the military, or fire department, this is a 5 1/2 hours that will be worth more than all the ""pep-talks"" you have ever slept through.  LTC Grossman will give you insights into the sociopathic mind, the mind of the average person, and some significant insights into your own mind.  If you have ever been in an ""officer involved"" shooting, you need to see this.  The cost of the DVD is about twice this, but if the VHS sells out, buy one for your department.  You will never regret it, and you may save the life of one of your colleagues.",1282348800,7,814,4.572413793103448
