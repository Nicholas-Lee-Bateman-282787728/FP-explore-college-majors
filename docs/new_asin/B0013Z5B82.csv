For the longest time I thought he should include more runs, passing notes, variations, etc.  After lots of practice and listening to both Hawkins and Davis, I felt immersed enough in the music that I have begun playing more and more in Davis' style, adding in very Davis-like licks, often inventing them as I'm playing, so in the end, these lessons have worked really well and I have a local reputation as being a very good performer, guitar and vocals, in this style.",1407456000,,530,4.557894736842106
8253674,5,B0013Z5B82,"I have wanted to learn Cincinatti Slow Drag for a long time.  I was pleased to discover Ernie's DVD, and slowly but surely, I am picking this great tune up.  I have not had time to check anything else out with the DVD, so I can't comment on that other than it all looks interesting.

The parts of the tune I have heard and worked on have been well-presented.  The only thing I added was some freeware that slows down a DVD; that way I could carefully listen to what Ernie is doing. I find that even when he slowly goes over a section, it is still a little too fast for me.",1370649600,,572,4.035398230088496
