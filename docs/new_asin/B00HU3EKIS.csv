6208217,2,B00HU3EKIS,"This was really a bad movie, the actors were cardboard and I'm being polite. The storyline was awful and the fighting was terrible also. Even if you still enjoy outdated westerns from yesteryear like me. You will not like this, even for free on television. Instead watch reruns of the Rifleman on television every Saturday",1420329600,,322,4.872727272727273

8635739,1,B00HU3EKIS,"Poor music back ground which conflicts/competes with the dialog, which is rather average at its best. The acting and directing are wooden and stiff.
