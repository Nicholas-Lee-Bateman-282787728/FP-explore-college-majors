8431599,1,B004J4RQXM,"This was a narrated collection of material that was interesting for perhaps the first 30 minutes or so, then became somewhat boring, and then became horribly boring.  The person narrating is obviously not a professional and was obviously doing it unrehearsed and on one long continuous read.  In several places the person repeats himself and even backs up and restates his comments after losing his place or rethinking his copy.  In many, many cases, the material is repetitious (although repetitious, even in all caps, is just not a strong enough word), with the same cases being examined time and time again, using virtually the same comments.  My wife and I were determined to watch the whole thing, however, no matter what.  After the first three plus hours, though, we simply couldn't stand it anymore and hit the stop and eject buttons on the remote.

If only we hadn't opened it; we could have returned it for a refund.",1416873600,,926,4.829113924050633

8431601,4,B004J4RQXM,I first became interested in ufos after seeing the footage of ufos over Mexico City in the 80's. This dvd brought back that initial awe I felt when I first saw those lines of lights darting across the sky. This video has a ton of information and will really get your wheels turning.,1368921600,,282,4.339622641509434
8431602,5,B004J4RQXM,"I can really get lost in a good ufo dvd, been watching them for years. This is high quality and makes a fine addition to my collection.  They didn't skimp on the content at all. Lots of great information.",1368835200,,204,4.230769230769231
8431603,1,B004J4RQXM,contrived. fake. nonsense. utterly unbelieveable. absolutely no proof any of this exists. a scam. don't waste ur money on this.,1333324800,,127,5.4
8431604,3,B004J4RQXM,"You don't have to be a real buff to enjoy this.  Though similar to the author's UFOs Don't Exist! DVD, this is a more comprehensive look, and covers other sightings.  It's in the same style: narrated lecture/slideshow, and the images are well-picked and to the point.  There is also news footage, mostly clips from Fox News.

The DVD covers the spotting of spacecraft throughout the ages, then the explosion of evidence after WWII, when personal cameras became widespread.  The film documents strange animal abductions and mutilations, Roswell, Stephenville, and dozens of other sightings, crashes and incidents.  The real-life ""men in black"" seem to show up afterwards, adding to the general suspicion that the US and other governments know far more than they're telling.

I could have done without the generic background music, but for amateur UFO researchers, this DVD is a must, I think, and you're sure to find sightings near you mentioned.  Fascinating stuff.  Watch the skies!",1315612800,,983,5.170886075949367
8431605,3,B004J4RQXM,"I've always been very interested in UFOs and the possibility of alien contact. This DVD covers 50+ years of UFO landings, crashes and retrievals. It's packed with photos and detailed narration of some of the most popular and even little known UFO information. I thoroughly believe we aren't alone in this universe and films like this just add more concreteness to the belief. If you're a UFO buff you should definitely add this DVD to your collection.",1314489600,,451,4.87012987012987
8431606,3,B004J4RQXM,"The narration in this film was very good. I found the information and cases that were presented extremely informative. I'm not sure If I'm 100 percent convinced that there is UFO life, but the information in this film made me definitely question my beliefs.",1307059200,2,257,4.863636363636363
8431607,3,B004J4RQXM,"Great cover art, but the program is a 4-hour free flowing narrative about various UFO events and theories over the past 50+ years.  In fact, there is actually very little ""footage,"" rather lots of still pictures and narration.  I guess you'd call it an entertaining 4 hour slide show.",1303516800,6,284,4.775510204081633
