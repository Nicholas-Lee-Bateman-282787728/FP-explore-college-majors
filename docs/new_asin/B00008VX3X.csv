This was a really cute movie in my opinion and I am glad that I was able to get it added to my DVD collection.",1357257600,,254,3.8846153846153846
7987390,4,B00008VX3X,"I have just seen this movie and highly recommend it. The basic premise is about Gus a manager of a retirement home. He is very rigid and the retirement home is a very bleak place. One of the residents catches on to the fact that he has been cooking the books and blackmails Gus to take him and two of his friends on a ""last hurrah"". Two of the residents are Kim Hunter who plays Nellie and Ossie Davis who was a boxing coach or boxer. James Whitmore also stars as the resident who was an accountant that discovers Gus is cooking the books. Along the way bonds are formed and the residents especially Nellie try to help Gus find romance. What I liked about the movie is that it celebrates life and the little moments. You come away feeling good. See this movie only to see one of Kim Hunter's  last performances. She is wonderful and moving as Nellie and gives a very subtle, fine performance that really makes the movie.",1235088000,,920,4.348837209302325
