8689805,5,B00PYI2UM4,"Excellent quality on the blu-ray of Ming-Liang Tsai's film. Stray Dogs is a film about desolation and despair in modern times. Beautifuly shot, slow spaced with great emotional acting. Lee Kang-Sheng is as brilliant as usual. The extras are a delight too, Journey to the West is a master piece of digital cinema and the master class is really worth watching. Great material.",1438214400,2,374,4.9523809523809526
8689806,1,B00PYI2UM4,"It is disjointed, illogical and goes exactly nowhere. The director must be a fool who expects the audience to have a single digit IQ. How many times does he have to show long drawn out scenes of his actors urinating? I'm sorry that I paid good money for this blue ray disc, my wife and I both tried hard to sit through this asinine film but we had to turn it off after suffering through it for not quite an hour. What a relief!",1437091200,,427,4.095238095238095
8689807,4,B00PYI2UM4,"STRAY DOGS. Wow. Because of the intense focus on the natural world, the first half reminded me of a Malick film. Alebit a Malick film with little or no sound and much much longer takes (sometimes several minutes long). In Malick films the characters never seem to step out of their own poetic stream of words and never cease being propelled by those words. But in this film there is nothing, no poetry from within or without animating two adults and two children/nothing stirring them into motion. Instead they are hollowed out creatures (at least the two adults are). These four individuals are barely scraping by on the fringe of an unnamed and impersonal city (somewhere in the east) where commerce continues but no culture of any kind seems to exist. Instead of the dance that is a Malick film you get lots of stillness. lots of stasis, lots of meaningless activity (eating, washing, preparing for bed). We slowly learn (from the father's song) that this family has suffered some great political displacement and that the mother and father now live apart (in fact we don't even know they're mother and father until we're well into the film). In that first hour or so we follow the father and mother separately. The mother works in a supermarket as some kind of inventory clerk. The father makes a living by holding a sign on a street corner. He takes care of his two kids in a home-made shelter. I would call this first half poetic realism but its a grim poetry (even though the children do giggle now and then).

But then the second half (wherein the father and mother reunite) feels more like a Tarkovsky film. As in Tarkovsky we never know if we are in an actual world or in someone's fantasy world. This whole second half takes place at night in a huge abandoned building with paint peeling off its walls. This building certainly looks like a set from STALKER. And its in this second half that the psychic displacement felt by the adults is taken to a whole new level. Their emotional pain builds and builds (the source of the displacement is only hinted at when the mother tells her daughter a story about a group of helpless frogs with an abusive king) throughout that final hour until that last sustained almost interminable shot of the two of them standing staring and finally touching in front of a pastoral mural that represents some kind of lost paradise.that remains in their memory to haunt them but that is alas no longer within their grasp. The way the film indirectly deals with political upheaval (by simply examining its psychic effects) reminds me of the already mentioned Tarkovsky but also of Erice's Spirit of the Beehive.  SPLENDID FILM.",1426204800,,2664,4.69017094017094

8689809,5,B00PYI2UM4,"If this is TSAI Ming-Liang's last feature film, he has in his unique way accomplished what has rarely been surpassed in the history of cinema. (Tsai announced his retirement from the feature-length films in 2013 Venice Film Festival.)

Those who like Tsai's films know what to expect: minimal dialogues, obscure plot and extreme long and ""static"" takes, some of them stretching past the traditional 12-minute limit of the 35 mm film magazine. As in Tsai's all other feature films, LEE Kang-Sheng is the lead actor. The new twist Tsai adds to this film is to have the main female character played by three of his favorite actresses (YANG Kuei-Mei, LU Yi-Ching and CHEN Chiang-Chyi), much like what Luis Buuel did in ""That Obscure Object of Desire"" almost four decades ago. Unlike Buuel's film, however, the ages of these three actresses are more than 10 years apart and their appearances are sequential rather than alternating. This opens many new possibilities for interpretations.

Winner of the Grand Jury Prize in 2013 Venice Film Festival, this is an emotionally powerful film. Scenes of despair alternate with ones of (quasi-)surrealism. Viewers who are able to resonate with the film's wavelength may feel the staggering beauty through Tsai's unblinking gaze. Tsai has always paid extreme attention to his cinematography and framing, but this time he tops himself. Its beautiful photography will surely linger in its viewers' minds.

The Blu-Ray package includes a perspective essay by Jonathan Rosenbaum in the insert. Extras include Tsai's (non-feature-length) film ""Journey to the West"" (56 min) and Tsai's Master Class/Interview at the Cinmathque Franaise (69 min, BD only).

------------------
P.S. Having seen all of Tsai's feature films and some of his shorts, I will put ""Stray Dogs"" alongside ""Vive l'Amour"" and ""Goodbye, Dragon Inn"" as my favorite films by Tsai.",1424217600,9,1878,5.25
8689810,4,B00PYI2UM4,"Buyers beware! If you have not seen any of Tsai Ming-Liang's movies, this is not a good one to begin with. Start with Rebels of the Neon God if you're interested in him.

Ming-Liang loves long shots, 20 minute shots, and minimal dialogue. Throughout his filmography he has reduced the use of dialogue. Leaving it up to the viewer to meditate on the movie.

I love that you can project yourself into his movies. That being said, I had a hard time doing it while watching Stray Dogs. Mostly because I couldn't relate to the characters. But I could still feel the hopelessness of them in this saddening movie.

The cinematography was quite the spectacle that helped carry the movie and keep interest. With his long time collaborator, Pen-Jung Liao, they created a tone and some shots that you'll never forget.

The special features include an interview with Ming-Liang before a showing of Stray Dogs. As well as his film Journey to the West (Xi You). Which packs another two hours of watch time on top of the two hour movie.",1423785600,4,1021,4.624309392265193
