3871725,3,B00284BVAO,"As a history of Alexandria, it is fine.  It was a little dry.  My young daughter (who loves this stuff) tuned out.  I think in part by this dryness and in part by the stronger accents in the interviews.  We wanted to watch this to learn more about Cleopatra, but she is only mentioned as a brief part of the history.  Once you watch the video, even the credits refer to this as simply ""Alexandria"" and do not mention Cleopatra.",1375660800,4,427,4.2875
3871726,4,B00284BVAO,I like this product because I like history.  This was an enjoyable visit back in time. it was also a time to introduce a younger group to the cleopatra story that would not have taken the time to read it. They did enjoy watching and listining to it.,1362441600,,249,4.1875

3871736,4,B00284BVAO,"I have become very fascinated with Cleopatra and anything related to her, ancient Egypt, and Rome.  I am soaking up any info I can find on this era. I found this documentary to be very informative and interesting, and it gave my imagination facts and details to help visualize life in ancient Egypt.  There were two drawbacks, however:  some of the documentary's film shots are grainy and out-of-focus. Another is the documentary was filmed years ago, so for someone needing updated info, this could be a drawback.",1410048000,,514,4.885057471264368

3871742,4,B00284BVAO,This documentary was done in the late 90's.  Thus it is dated.  It does give good historical information though and is worth watching for some of the facts which have not changed in 18 years.  The world is still looking for the tomb of Alexander in 2014.,1399420800,2,254,4.361702127659575
3871743,4,B00284BVAO,"Nice footage (actual film--probably 16mm--so it's pretty grainy) with nice interviews with the actual international band of archaeologists.  Liked that it wasn't all ""wow!"" and dramatic like History/Discovery Channel.",1397692800,2,217,6.482758620689655

8355636,5,B00284BVAO,"An interesting survey of the ancient Egyptian artifacts littering the underwater shoreline of Alexandria, the established site of the ruins of Cleopatra's Palace.  Briefly includes the history of Cleopatra, Julius Ceasor and Marc Antony, her downfall and the factors that brought down her famous Palace.  Explores the underwater site with provocative photography, and includes the evidence supporting the conclusion that this is in fact Cleopatra's Palace, as well as the scientific archeological process for those interested in how this is done in a way readily accessible to a lay audience.  Explains why the site is of such great importance in our study of ancient peoples--and how the city itself contributed to the modern foundation of mathematics and science.  Maps out how the site used to look, with the aid of 3D digital renderings.  Discusses the future of the project which is expected to take many years--and their hope for creating a museum which could include an underwater recreation using the large pieces that were used to construct the buildings.. A decent portion of the film takes place underwater.

 Fascinating!  Worth watching if you have any interest in Alexandria, ancient Egyptians, Cleopatra or underwater archeology.",1524960000,,1244,5.376288659793815
