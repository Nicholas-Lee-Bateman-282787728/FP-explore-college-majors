4584570,5,B00562PIJA,"As a New Yorker who grew up basically at coney island, I was truly moved by this Dvd.  It was informative, fun, historical and extremely emotional.  I actually became sad as a result of knowing that an iconic place like Coney Island would close.  I highly recommend this work to anyone who has either been to Coney or wanted to visit.",1316822400,6,334,4.442622950819672

8459134,3,B00562PIJA,Vintage photos were great but there was too much time spent talking about unnecessary details.,1406160000,,94,5.333333333333333
8459135,3,B00562PIJA,An interesting insight into the history and the current/ongoing efforts to revitalize Coney Island. Unfortunately the politics of the latter occupy a goodly portion of the film with far too much time spent on filmed meetings of the council and  individual responses to the intrusion of gentrification into what is now a pretty run down area. Would have been a better film if it had been edited by a third to remove repetition.,1391558400,,426,4.835616438356165
8459136,1,B00562PIJA,"half the show should have been setting up the history of the park with video of the original rides and side shows.  instead, the whole production is about the proposed controversial revitalization plans.  this could have been done in 15 minutes.",1391212800,,245,4.951219512195122
8459137,3,B00562PIJA,This was rated on a feeling It was to local. I learned about the business owned by individuals in a amusement district. I was really looking for history as of pictures rides and when it was booming.,1390176000,,198,4.378378378378378
8459138,5,B00562PIJA,I love old amusement parks and Coney Island is a just an icon. I had heard things about it over the past few years and wondered how it was surviving considering all the developers that I thought would be looking at that piece of land for condos and stuff. This documentary shows the tug of war between the developers and the folks that love the amusement area. It show the bungling of the development of the surrounding area with lots of low cost housing that was built there and areas that were destroyed for redevelopment and left as bare lots for years. Hopefully the amusement park will not shrink and will preserve the components that have made it legend.,1386288000,,660,4.554621848739496
8459139,2,B00562PIJA,I've seen better histories on Coney Island.  I was disappointed. It need further histories and better conclusions.  PBS had a wonderful video.  I wish I remembered the name of it.,1380412800,,179,4.9

8459141,5,B00562PIJA,Coney Island is a national landmark and it is terrible to see its land being snatched up by greedy developers.,1375056000,,110,4.55
8459142,2,B00562PIJA,"Just too political.  It really didn't seem historical enough for me.  I guess it will show up on ""Current"" TV soon.",1374364800,,115,4.428571428571429
