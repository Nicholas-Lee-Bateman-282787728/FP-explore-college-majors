622541,3,6303323200,"Roger Avary's directorial debut Killing Zoe presents a surreal take on the heist genre. Zed(Eric Stoltz)comes to Paris to participate in a bank robbery with his friend Eric(Jean-Hugues Anglade) who he has not seen in eleven years. On his first night in Paris he is set up with an escort named Zoe(Julie Delpy)who he has an immediate bond with. After a night of drug fueled partying Eric and his gang set the robbery in motion. Things go horribly wrong and carnage results. To say anything further would ruin the plot.

Avary proved in his first outing that he could direct and write a credible film without the help of his friend Quentin Tarantino. Though the two director's styles are similar both are quite distinct. Avary uses an interesting color scheme to distinguish the three acts of his film: white in the opening scenes, blue in the middle and red for the robbery itself. Also of note is that the film was almost shot in Los Angeles as a substitute for Paris, a fact that Avary found interesting.

622548,5,6303323200,"I don't see how anyone could write a bad review for this film. Although it comes from the same group of Tarentino-related film-makers, it has a much more different tone. Somewhat noire and extremely bizarre. The violence is extreme, hardcore and almost constant throughout the film.
I wish it was not advertised so closely to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs because it's a totally different animal. It's a hardcore rush from start to end. Whereas, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction have slower paces and a totally different style. Reservoir Dogs plays out more like a play than a movie and both films bounce around in the timelines of the film. Killing Zoe on the other hand is a high-octane wild ride that makes itself clear from the start. Stoltz's character arrives in Paris, meets the hooker, then head out for a crazy night of heroin and debauchery with his psychotic friend. He dozes off and semi-wakes up to his French counterpart anal raping some other guy? Nuts.
From then on out the whole movie is in the bank and nothing but mayhem. It's frenzied and beautiful and when it's over you feel like you've just gotten a shot of adrenaline that'll take a little while to wear off. A one of a kind film that unfortunately got clumped together with the whole Tarentino hype. Now, I love Tarentino's films, but I think this one should get credit on it's own for being completely independent. Just like I feel True Romance should be more closely connected to Tarentino because, in my opinion, that is his best work.",1327017600,,1514,4.695488721804511

Like his coeval Tarantino, it descends into horrifically graphic violence and chaos.  The art of total catastrophe.  This is an early film, much like Reservoir Dogs for Tarantino.

That being said, the acting is outstanding.  Delphy is wonderful as a student hooker, tossing her gum before servicing her client.  Stolz too is perfect as a man with a chaotic life looking for the big score.  But Angalde is the best as an insane, AIDS-ridden addict turned killer.  Unfortunately, the plot is so weak and conventional that they cannot carry it.  I was just waiting for it to end once the violence started.

622577,5,6303323200,"This is a bank heist movie. You know, there's a safecracker, blueprints, a plan. Problem is the gang doing the heist is made up of assorted druggies and wackos. Wackiest of all is the gang leader, Eric (Jean-Hughes Anglade). Anglade put about 200% into this role.

Injected into the robbery is Zed (Eric Stoltz), Eric's childhood friend. Apparently they were close, but they haven't seen each other in eleven years. Eric lives in Paris and he invites his American safecracking buddy to France for the big job. If the story seems to be thin, that's because it is.

Zed comes off as the ""good bad guy"" so adored by script writers. That is, he winches at random violence, but doesn't mind robbing a bank. In the film's beginning he hires Zoe, a prostitute. Turns out she is also an aspiring artist/part-time bank employee. She is very convincingly portrayed by Julie Delpy. The Zed-Zoe connection is at the heart of the matter.

I found the film to be highly entertaining. It builds to a powerful conclusion. There's a lot that is over the top and wildly improbable.  But it still works.",1249257600,,1084,4.689473684210526

as always, is the hooker that Eric orders right after landing.

This movie has ""cult classic"" written all over it, and after more than a

decade it has lost none of its acuteness in portraying a generation that

doesn't even care about being desperately lost. Abundant drugs permeate

the story, but drugs alone can't fully account for everybody's apathy.

It is a very simple tale with a very simple setting. The whole French crew and their gregarious lifestyles and generally crazy demeanor is what makes this movie pretty good. These people live life to the fullest and are fun to watch onscreen. Delpy is great as usual, but I do not understand her attraction to Stoltz who is a dolt and largely uninterested in her on a deeper level it seems.

Worth a watch. It is not stylish violence though like a Tarentino movie. It is gritty and grimy.",1167782400,,675,4.184615384615385
622582,4,6303323200,"I was drawn to see this because Roger Avary was the man who came up with  the idea for ""The Gold Watch"" segment in my favorite movie ""Pulp Fiction"".

I was curious to see how Roger Avary was when he worked by himself. ""Killing Zoe"" was his directorial debut and like almost any debut, it has its flaws. It's not a bad movie though and it's a pretty interesting movie, but dialouge over story is truly Avary's strong suit. I hate to compare anybody's dialouge (except Elmore Leonard in his books) to Quentin Tarantino's, but to make a point I must. Avary's dialouge flows like Tarantino's and it's filled with wit and humor. I laughed aloud at a couple parts, like the cat & ""I can't do pee on you for 200 bucks."" The first time I watched it, I wondered to myself how one of the characters in this movie could feel emotion for the person that she helps at the end after what is done to her. I don't want to say much more than that for fear of ruining the movie...But in the first few scenes between these two, it's obvious. Anyway, ""Killing Zoe"" begins in a cab with Zed (Eric Stoltz, who's very good here), an American in France, who's on his way to a motel. When Zed gets to the motel, he takes a shower and a prosititute shows up at his house. This prostitute is Zoe (Julie Delpy of ""Before Sunset""), an art student. In a great scene, Zoe and Zed have a conversation (after sex) about why they like each other. Then, Zed's friend Eric (Jean-Hughes Anglade) shows up and tosses Zoe, naked, out of the motel. Zed does nothing, but goes with Eric to his place where they begin to map out a bank robberty that's to happen tomorrow on Bastille Day (which I've never heard of except in the song by Rush). The bank will be the only one that's open, Zed will crack the safe. Problem is, Zed is not a bad man by any standard. He's a crook, but he's not a bad man. Eric is a bad man, he's also a drug fiend and that's not a good combination. Anyway, Eric and Zed, and a bunch of other guys go the bank the next day (they don't get to the bank until like 45 minutes into the movie) and preceed to rob it, but (as in all bank heist movies) things don't go their way and the cops are outside. Also,

Zoe happens to work there...That's all I'm going to say about the synopsis.

Anyways, one thing Avary does in this movie really well (besides dialouge) is

he paces the film well. In a lot of movies, the pacing is boring and obvious. The only other director I can think of that can use a lot of pacing is Stanley Kubrick, most notably in ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Avary isn't using the pacing just to have some story leading up to the bank robbery, he's building the tension. Problem is, there were a few times when the pacing did get boring. Like in the scene where they're driving down the street and yelling at prosititutes. Pointless...But, this is a good movie and a good first feature. Stoltz, Anglade, and Delpy are all very good and Roger Avary proves that he's a worthy director.

622583,4,6303323200,"It's easy to discuss 'Killing Zoe's problems; they are, after all, plentiful and in clear view. It's hard to deny, though, that it's an incredibly entertaining movie. It's important not to be misled by the treacherous phrase 'from the creators of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction'; Killing Zoe was directed by Roger Avary, who may has a co-writer's credit on Pulp Fiction but his part in it was quite small; in Reservoir Dogs all his actually did was write the radio dialogue that runs in the background. Quentin Tarantino was executive producer, but clearly had no influence on the creative side of the movie. The presence of Tarantino's name on the Killing Zoe DVD is a double-ended sword; on the one hand, it's what made me notice it and pick it up in the first place, and I'm sure it helped a lot in the film's sales when it was first released. On the other, it inevitably creates some high expectations, and these can hinder your enjoyment from the movie, as they did mine. Because while Killing Zoe shares with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction some themes of crime, drugs, sex and honor among thieves, it shares none of Tarantino's witty, sarcastic edge and cultural awareness.

If, however, you remember to steer clear of these expectations - and if you like this kind of movie, of course - then you're bound to enjoy Killing Zoe. It's a fast-paced, entertaining crime story with lots of violence, some sense of humor, some sex and a lot of atmosphere. Very good performances are also given by the beautiful Julie Delpy (""the prostitute with a heart of gold"") and Jean-Hugues Anglade (""the psychopathic sadist""), who plays one of the coolest villains of the 90's (who's more than a bit similar to Gary Oldman's fantastic Agent Stansfield from 'Leon'), and these two almost make up for the unimpressive leading man we have in Eric Stoltz - who, though he made a fine career for himself playing small character roles in fantastic films from Pulp Fiction to Singles, had not proven himself as a capable lead since his breakthrough performance as a disfigured boy in Mask - who plays a rather unlikable and uninteresting hero.

Killing Zoe is a featherweight film with absolutely no depth to the story or characters, that generally likes waving around the sex and violence for the sake of sex and violence, which are sometimes unnecessarily excessive (like the far too long sex scene at the beginning, or the gory image of the dying man near the end); it's not a very intelligent crime movie, and it won't stick with you, but it's great entertainment, with fantastic atmosphere, and for any fan of the genre - one who is not easily offended (and you'll be amazed at how dirty a dirty joke sounds in French even if you don't understand one word) - it's well worth seeing. Keep your expectations low, and you'll have lots of fun.",1128384000,2,2828,4.711111111111111

Loved the scene where Eric and Julie are going at it in the hotel room while the original Nosferatu plays soundlessly on the room tv; no doubt heralding the imminent arrival of the one-man wrecking crew Anglade.",1115337600,,931,5.340136054421769
622607,3,6303323200,"Have you ever been somewhere and thought to yourself, this would be a great location for a film (happens to me all the time, and yet no movies have come my way)?  That's what happened to producer Lawrence Bender as he was scouting locations for the 1992 Quentin Tarantino film Reservoir Dogs.  He was offered the use of a bank in L.A., it didn't fit within the script, but he was able to find a story that utilized the location, and thus begat Killing Zoe (1994).  In this case the script had already been written, and it just happened that most of the story takes place within a bank, so it was a match, for better or worse.  Written and directed by Roger Avary (The Rules of Attraction), the film stars Eric Stoltz (The Wild Life), Julie Delpy (An American Werewolf in Paris), and Jean-Hugues Anglade (Taking Lives).  Also appearing is Bruce Ramsay (Alive), Kario Salem (Nomads), Salvator Xuereb (The Doom Generation), and Gary Kemp (The Krays).

The film begins as Zed, played by Stoltz, looking much like a scruffy poster boy for the Grunge movement, arrives in Paris and hails a cab to take him to a hotel.  During the cab ride, the driver offers to set Zed up with some female companionship, to which a comely woman named Zoe (Delpy) show up a few hours later.  After some brief formalities (we learn she doesn't do `weird' stuff), the two further the cause for Franco-American relations, to which we learn she's just doing it for the money (duh) to pay for school.  Soon Zed's French friend Eric (Anglade) arrives, and he quickly and unceremoniously ejects Zoe from the room (sans her clothes).  Seems Zed has arrived in Paris at Eric's bequest, as Zed is a safecracker, and Eric has a job lined up, to take place on Bastille Day (similar to our 4th of July...look it up).  Zed meets with the rest of Eric's crew (I wasn't impressed), and the gang goes out on the town for a dose of the three D's, drinking, drugs (there's a lot of `riding the snake' involved), and Dixieland music...seriously.  I don't know about you, but if I'm going to pull a major bank heist, the last thing I'm going to do is go out the night before and get stoned to the gills (Zed puking in a dirty urinal being the highlight here...remember that kids, drugs is bad).  Anyway, the next day arrives, and the gang hits the bank...and their well-oiled plans quickly go down the drain (much the same as Zed's breakfast, lunch, and dinner the night before).  All kinds of complications develop, from uncooperative bank employees to less than capable members within Eric's group.  Did I also mention that Zoe works at the bank (talk about your moonlighting)?  Well, things continue to deteriorate (the police show up, and they seem to care little for the hostages) as we witness the importance of careful planning and being picky when choosing associates for such an undertaking.

In some aspects, I felt like this film was almost a pale comparison to Sidney Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon (1975) starring Al Pacino (see it, it's a great film).  There were a few things that detracted from this film, some major, some minor.  First of all, how stupid do you have to be to go on a drunken drug binge (scenes that took way too much time) the night before you're planning to pull a major robbery (I think it was presented as some sort of `bonding' sequence)?  Did I mention this before?  It's worth bringing up again...and an experienced safecracker (Zed) would have never agreed to perform a job with such short notice and so little planning...talk about stupidity...and what was with that dumb, American stereotype in the bank?  Here's some guy blathering on and on about he's an American and all kinds of simplistic, stereotypical American BS, presented only so that we can see him get blown away.  What kind of moron would have stood up and did what he did, amidst a group of heavily armed, trigger happy, obviously unstable bank robbers?  An American one, obviously...  I did feel the script was decent, even strong at some points, and there's plenty of action, but more often it seemed like the violence was there only for the sake of having it there...the random shooting of the various bank employees and patrons (actually, we don't get to see a lot of people get shot, as a good deal of the violence happens off screen) seemed a bit gratuitous (a Quentin Tarantino film with gratuitous violence?  Gee, that's a shocker...).  I appreciated some of the comic elements throughout the film, like when Zed, who was mainly working on the vault doors, and is unaware that the police have since gotten involved, discover such in the elevator as him and another have liberated the booty and are bringing it to the ground floor.  The film was set in Paris, with the opening and closing scenes featuring Paris locations, but the rest of the film was shot in L.A., the bulk taking place in the bank and its underground vault area, which was painted an awful, garish, red.  The film is filled with lots of flashy spectacle, so-so acting, two-dimensional characters, guns, guns, and more guns, and lots of blood.  Some scenes to watch for...Delpy gets nekkid...this happens shortly after the beginning, and is worth it, as she's an attractive woman.  Also watch for a cameo by Ron Jeremy aka A Man Called Horse, as an unfortunate bank employee.

The widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1) picture on this DVD looks very good, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 audio is clear most of the time, but could have been better...special features include cast and crew bios, productions notes, and a theatrical trailer.

In the movie he walks towards the screen and flicks something and it makes a small explosion. Is it a cigarette or is it a heroine-related hallucinations. It's as if Avary, Stoltz, Bender, and Tarantino are throwing a riddle in our faces. It reminds me of whats in the suitcase in Pulp Fiction. All-in-all, a great film.",1107043200,2,615,4.6

As for the prior reviewers' complain of lack of character development.  I say nuts.  Must every movie have detailed character background?  If you want one, go read a book.  A good movie does not require obvious character background.  A good movie will have such information hidden inside.  A good movie will implore movie-goers to think and explore themselves.

 The script is nihl and the acting less than stellar. The screenplay is littered with intentional conincidences too absurd to be credible. I frankly could have done without the grotesque heroin-induced sodomy scenes. Watch ""Heat"" instead if you want to see a great bank heist film.

This film was reccomended to me and all I can say is I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.
Quentin Tarantino and Lawrence Bender produced this. I must admit, I find that very hard to believe. Not because of the slow pace, crappy story and characters (Although that is surprisng for those two) but it's the incredible lack of money that surprised me most of all. Don't get me wrong on this, I don't care if a film is made on pennies. BUT IT HAS TO BE GOOD.
Robert Rodrigiez made El Mariachi on seven thousand dollars. This looks like it was made on seven cents.
I personally think that this film was no more than one of Tarantino's old Video archives buddies asking for a bit of money to make a film. Tarantino being the nice guy that he supposedly is, not to mention a film addict, was curious to see what his friend would produce. Now it went one of two ways.
Either Tarantino and Bender gave him the money and left him to do the whole thing on his own without any tip offs, or the guy just kept all the money, went to the local supermarket to pick up a crappy video camera (cos that's what it looks like) and shot the film without a care in the world eagerly awaiting the rap party.
Anyway I f you find all this hard to believe (Just like I did) then get hold of this and find out yourself. But make sure you do yourself a favour and when you start to get incredibly bored, turn the film off. Take my advice, It doesn't get any better.

Killing Zoe is a perfect distraction for any of you out there who, like me, are to entrenched in reality to fly to Europe and take heroin for the first time the night before a bank robbery you didn't plan for at all.

Its the story of an American safecracker who gets out of prison and travels to Paris to rob a bank with his French friend, Eric.  There he meets a prostitute named Zoe who happens to work at the bank they rob.  The robbery is one of the most bloody in movie history with them gunning down anyone that gets in the way.  At first I was uncomfortable with that but the story unfolds in a way that is so compelling you can't stop watching.  Jean-Hughes Anglade was incredible in his portrayal of the evil Aids stricken Eric with no respect for human life.  Eric is probably the most interesting character in the film.  He's so ruthless and convincing that he's the one thing that makes this movie so great.
There are also funny moments like the Billy Holiday albums, their night at the jazz club, the Viking movies and the little monkey.  The movie is bizarre at times but its definitely unique.

Jean-Hughes Anglade and Eric Stoltz are perfect together as old childhood friends out to rob a Federal bank in France on Bastille Day.
Here are the reasons why I love this movie.  It really has a lot packed into it.  It has a ton of humor, though much of it is dark humor.  The extended drug use scene and tour of Paris must be about as close as you can come to honestly portraying being high on film.  The pace of the action never slows down, and each scene consistently draws me in.  There are a whole bunch of little original ideas and surprises thrown in that makes the film always interesting.

It is different from Pulp Fiction in the way that it keeps itself serious, and after all, that's a very good thing, because it doesn't have all the pretention to put crude vulgarity and violence with such a commercial touch of humor. Pulp Fiction makes violence look cool, with all the seventies' look and stupid jokes. But Killing Zoe is realistic...""spoilers warning"" There is that strong and intense scene of drug abuse, which shows the exact pictures of a bad trip. The violence is more intense, and more horrible, which gives a sense to the film where a Tarantino film could never go. I admit that Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs had more development of various characters, but Killing Zoe is focussing on one particular guy, and that guy is more interesting than any character in a Tarantino movie. In my first view of the film, I thought it was absolutely stupid that Zoe was not so important in the story, because the title says ""Killing Zoe""...that's not an appropriate title, but if you read this before watching the film, don't follow Zoe's character, follow Eric's. The acting is awesome, especially from Jean-Hugues Anglade, who plays the maniac junkie who doesn't care about anything, and who's ready to die anytime. I would even say he's a touching character. And the scene where he dies is just perfect, and beautiful, it's a magical piece of acting from Mr. Anglade. Every scene of the film is intense, and was made with care and originality. The tragedy and the insanity is really there, and you can feel it very well. The directing is great, and the mood is awesome!

Eric and Zed then go on a drug binge with Eric's criminal buddies. The next day they rob a bank and Eric goes insane.
My Opinion:  The production notes tell the story of how a director found this cool bank in Los Angeles that he thought would be perfect for a movie. He called around to see if anyone had a script for such a movie. Roger Avary said he did. After hanging up the phone, he hurriedly wrote one. For me this explained everything. Had he taken some time with the script, things might have been different. The long drug binge in the beginning of the movie is terrible. I don't care if it's supposed to show the chaotic mind of Eric or whatever. I didn't like it. As for the main bank robbery portion of the movie, there was nothing new or inventive. The violence was without reason and over the top. Things like dirty jokes seemed to be just thrown in to make the movie longer. It was like watching Pulp Fiction with all the humor and intelligence removed. Jean-Hugues Anglade does put in a good performance, but it is in a losing effort. I had a hard time buying Eric Stoltz as a hardened bank robber and the very attractive Julie Delpy as a desperate call girl willing to risk everything for a criminal she met only hours before. Chalk this one up as direct to video quality and move on.
DVD Quality: Widescreen anamorphic - 1.85:1 DD2.0 Picture quality was good. Extras include trailer, cast bios, and production notes.

He is a psychotic, a man with who knows what neurosis or psychosis, the  knowledge that he is dying of AIDS, a hopeless heroin addict. This is his  downfall in actually being able to pull off his role as ring-master in the  bank heist.  Eric Stoltz's character reminded me a little of his character  Lance, in Pulp. He is definitely living in the underworld and yet shows  abilities for compassion and maybe even love, the anti-hero of this film.  There should have been more development of his character as I would have  liked to been able to enjoy the complexity of his role.
I agree that  character development was lacking.  I agree that the movie dragged some,  especially in the beginning.  I also heard more clever lines in Pulp.  However, the use of camera, color, location, set up the backdrop of this  film with much symbolism, helping to convey this film-noir's  aspects.
Once the heist went down, I was along side them, every step of  the way. I had to see how it was all going to play out in the end.  I  wanted to see Stoltz walk away in the end and ""get the girl"".

622685,4,6303323200,Killing Zoe is an interesting movie with some great lines in it. For example an American tourist goes to the bank robbers and says you would be speaking German if it weren't for us! right before he gets shot in the  face. But the movie is predictable but is an overall enjoyable movie to  watch.,952819200,,295,4.345454545454546

7843213,2,6303323200,"I thought it was awfully violent and the character development poor. I'm sure Stoltz was giving it his best and wanted to work with Tarantino, but let me just say, I never want to see this movie again. It's basically blood and yelling throughout the majority of it, and I found Julie Delpy to be pretty lame. Poor Eric couldn't save this one.",1509148800,,342,4.444444444444445

7843216,4,6303323200,"**** 4 Stars ****  Upon the movie's release, Roger Ebert wrote (9/9/1994):  ""'Killing Zoe' is Generation X's first bank caper movie, an ultra-violent screamfest about a soft-spoken American who gets involved with a gang of drugcrazed Parisian thieves and blunders into a hostage situation.""  I couldn't have summarized it better.  Written and directed by Tarantino's buddy Roger Avary (they shared an Oscar for best screenplay, 'Pulp Fiction'), Avary was only 27 when he made this movie, and it has become a cult flick on both sides of the Atlantic.  And for good reason: 'Killing Zoe' brings the ideas of 'down and dirty' and 'gritty' to new lows.  I mean, there are scenes when you just want to stop and take a shower, and I'm not talking about sex - there's stuff here to make your basic junkie barf.  But ultimately, Eric Stoltz and Julie Delpy keep us grounded (with great performances by both) - they offset the evil insanity of Jean-Hugues Anglade (also a great performance) and his crew.  Because of its pedigree (Tarantino was a producer as well as the director's BFF), 'Killing Zoe' gets compared to 'Pulp Fiction' a lot - and that's just wrong.  'Pulp Fiction' is a light comedy compared to 'Zoe' ... think 'Reservoir Dogs' (1992) instead, but with zero humor.  Recommended for anyone who likes quality crime films (and won't complain about the drugs and body count).  Thanks for reading.",1502409600,,1399,4.885593220338983

7843221,5,6303323200,I really love the two part structure of this movie. It's like 1 shorter film and its sequel.  The characters and world building are very compelling. The first half gets you very invested in the characters. And the second half...impossible to say without spoilers.,1473465600,,263,4.9772727272727275
