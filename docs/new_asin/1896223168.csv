7801137,5,1896223168,"At last! An educational video designed with the VCR user in mind! This video isn`t just an entertaining group of skits - it has interactive  options that you control with the remote. After you've worked your way  through a lesson listening and watching - and I shouldn't say work, because  it's so easy and rewarding - you can rewind a lesson and practice speaking.  To do this, you use a cue on the tape to pause the video while you  formulate the sentence that's coming. Once you've spoken out loud and heard  the original on the video, you have time to pause and correct yourself,  without having to rewind the tape. It's a simple concept but one that I`ve  never encountered before and one that is extremely effective. This is  certainly better than watching videos that are really just conventional  lessons or footage of situations with no chance to get involved. Other  features of this video that enhance the learning experience are the variety  of background music, the ironic approach, and the practicality of the  language. While these aspects all contribute to excellent lessons, the  character in the video is certainly the main teacher. It is through the  character's actions that you understand the language. He is an affable, but  inept mime  who goes through a series of ordinary actions while the  narrator clearly enunciates instructions, questions, and comments. The  actor is so talented that you, the viewer, understand much of the new  language you're hearing. The workbook that comes with the video is really  well constructed too and gives you a chance to review and extend all that  you've learned. All in all, this video package is an exceptional language  experience.",966038400,11,1695,4.932624113475177
7801138,5,1896223168,"Everybody knows that learning by doing is the best way to learn. Doing  something is better than just hearing about it or watching it. Many  language learning resources use tapes that you listen to and a few use  videos that you watch. Like these other resources, this video has you  listening and watching too, but it goes a step further and has you actually  doing - doing actions and speaking the language of what you're doing. It  seems to me that when I started Lesson 1, my mind reverted to some younger,  receptive mode and automatically began to put together whole phrases and  sentences. And the sentences weren't just statements - they were questions,  commands, and exclamations as well - structures that I had studied with no  small amount of frustration before. As I worked my way through to Lesson  20, I didn't always jump up and do all the actions (my two young boys sure  did), but my body simply took my mind through them while I sat on the  couch. Then, later, when I reviewed the lesson, my body not only responded  to the language but actually prompted my memory of the words. It's all  rather magical but it seems to me that it's also the way we learn our first  language - by doing it, by matching actions and words, and by sometimes  using those actions to prompt the words. I wish I'd had this video years  ago and I wouldn't have wasted so much time and experienced so much  frustration. Although I'm still focusing on my French, I know that this  video is available in three other languages - Spanish, German, and English  - and I must say that I'm curious to experience it in these languages too.",965779200,9,1624,4.493150684931507
7801139,5,1896223168,"This video is a great purchase. At $1.50 per lesson, it's value packed. Each lesson has 20 - 30 utterances with basic verb tenses and ordinary  vocabulary. Each lesson is accompanied by two pages of exercises in a  workbook where you rewrite the script yourself and use the language in new  ways. Each lesson deals with a common topic using language you encounter  every day. Each lesson uses humour and theme music to relax you while you  learn and start speaking. In fact, on the video jacket you'll find a series  of steps that explain a good process for efficiently learning the language  in each lesson. These steps take you through from watching to listening to  speaking. The only problem with this video is that it's so much fun to  watch and the language starts making so much sense that you may want to do  a sneak preview of the whole thing before you actually back up to the  beginning and start following the directions. But when you do, you've got  at least a solid hour's lesson for only $1.50 an hour.",965606400,7,1017,4.527472527472527

Hello Teachers. Hello Students. Do you have the  classroom blahs? Do you need new learning activities? Do you have Suivons  Simon? You don't? Don't buy another activity book. Don't videotape another  TV program. Don't record more radio newscasts. Instead, Suivons Simon.  You'll like it. You'll learn a lot.  Designed for beginner to low  intermediate language learners, this  language kit is a pedagogical  delight. It's breezy, cheeky and funny. The themes and situations are  universal, the writing is simple and energetic, the lesson delivery is  professional and accessible. And it's available in four languages: English,  French, Spanish and German.  I am a teacher and writer in Montreal. I began  using the English version, Follow Francis, about two years ago with my  immigrant classes at an adult education centre in Montreal. It was an  instant winner with those students. Since then, I have been using it  regularly and successfully with all my basic education students. The  multimedia instructional kit contains four teaching components: a video, a  printed student exercise book, a cassette tape, and a teacher's guide.  (Teacher guide and audio cassette available separately). All materials  smoothly integrate the four language elements, then spice them up with hits  of light-hearted humor.  Students particularly like the video's strong  visual and verbal components. The cute but perpetually confused main  character, Simon, plays a klutzy ""everyman"" character to great  effect. Our laughter dissolves classroom cultural barriers faster than March  sunshine melts snow. Children also respond enthusiastically to the highly  graphic skits and lively action. I have lent the video to a French Canadian  neighbor whose 5-year-old loves the sad-eyed, silly mime. Used together or  alone, each component contributes to the overall effectiveness of this  learning resource. Both the video and the tapecassette have the same 20  vignettes about familiar themes; the sketches follow a pedagogical  progression from listening comprehension to speaking. The writers built up  the themes using controlled grammar and high frequency vocabulary and  expressions designed to help learners develop a native-like language base.  Each of the approximately 4-minute sketches is different and all of them  can be used to reinforce grammar or theme-based curricula. The sketches  explore universal subjects in ways that stimulate thought and discussion.  The Teacher's guide and  the student exercise book, have been designed to  encourage student participation by extending the theme ideas and bringing  in other vocabulary and grammar structures. Repitition, imitation,  roleplay, cued responses, trivia questions, skits and dialogues are some of  the guide's suggested activities. The professional production standards of  this kit make viewing and using a pleasure. Simon is an appealing  character, played with zest and sympathy by a skilled mime artist. The male  and female narrators enunciate clearly, the background music dramatizes the  action, the pacingand sequencing enable learners to both repeat and  anticipate lines. This learning resource delivers the goods in a way that  allows teachers to focus on their students' needs and that helps students  to learn more easily. Individual learners can use this language aid to  learn at their own pace. And it's a lot of fun for everyone.",965260800,10,3419,5.603921568627451
