7635216,1,B01BHTSIOC,"Pure, unadulterated treacle. A shame, because I like the actors in other projects they've been involved in. And for some odd reason Julian Fellowes feels a need to chat both before and at the end of each episode. I didn't like the practice when Alfred Hitchcock did it, and I don't like it here.",1531699200,,295,4.481481481481482
7635217,3,B01BHTSIOC,"While Downton Abbey was Fellow's opus, this is not; although it has incited myself to read the story as the book is generally far superior to the 'movie/television' rendition I did enjoy the good doctor's stoic wisdom not to mention calm demeanor and nice looks.",1531612800,,262,4.844444444444444

7635229,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I really did love this little miniseries.  It was completely predictable but it was just fun to watch.  There was humor, romance and intrigue.  What's not to love?  The costumes were beautiful to see on screen and the settings were breathtaking.  The acting was of good quality and I actually enjoyed the little fireside chats with Julian Fellowes.  It's clear Mr. Fellowes loved this novel and seeing it made into a move, I can see why.  There is nothing truly groundbreaking here but it's fun little escape.  I hope Mr. Fellowes chooses to do more of these because they are quite fun.",1526601600,,586,4.676470588235294

7635236,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I could not believe my eyes, the bad ratings and what was said. 1) I am American and found the American Character charming and never offensive in any way. IT IS JUST A CHARACTER for goodness sake. 2) I Absolutely enjoyed this little series. 3) I will also enjoy picking up the book and reading it myself with my teenage children. 4) Very well put together. 5) NOT boring. I watched all episodes back to back and wish there were more. BRAVO!",1524009600,,440,4.378048780487805
7635237,5,B01BHTSIOC,GREAT STORY,1523923200,,11,5.0
7635238,5,B01BHTSIOC,I absolutely loved this! I really hope that they bring Julian Fellowes back to do another one or even rotate authors to bring these stories to life.,1523491200,,148,4.518518518518518
7635239,4,B01BHTSIOC,"It's like Masterpiece Theater mixed with Alfred HItchcock Presents.  Julian Fellowes opens and closes each episode with commentary.  Definitely not on par with Downton Abbey, but a quick watch that enjoyable if not that well acted.",1523318400,,231,5.388888888888889
7635240,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Not Downton Abbey, not so much. More like Jane Austen, with a little bit of Dickens and costumed in puffy skirts. Good pace, good acting, good production values, feels a little like a soap opera, especially when compared to other adaptations.  Still, fun to watch, especially if you like period pieces",1523232000,,301,4.901960784313726
7635241,5,B01BHTSIOC,Love it. .. good story telling. No smut.,1523232000,,40,4.125

7635244,5,B01BHTSIOC,My wife really enjoyed this.,1522368000,,28,4.8
7635245,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I loved all of it and may watch it again to get a good grip on who's related to whom, and who killed Dr. Thorne's brother, and why things developed in an odd way.  Dr. Thorne himself is a predictably kind and tactful middle-class doctor who seems to have favor with everyone.  He's almost too perfect, but he it the glue that binds all these various classes in a Victorian countryside.  I gave it five stars because it left me wanting more.  If the series ended here, the conclusion to this season would suffice.  Apparently the viewers have spoken and hopefully, we will get more. I agree that this is nowhere near the caliber of Downton. The period does not demand the sophistication in the characters as they do in Downton. Don't let that deter you......it is more on the stiff proper Sense and Sensibility genre.

My only critical comment is dear Julian Fellowes presenting each episode and following with a summary.  Not meaning to sound harsh but it reminded me of the format of the Alfred Hitchcock series with a more gentrified presentation.  I hope that is discontinued now that we have sunk our teeth into this series and have enjoyed the fare.",1522281600,,1154,4.622549019607843
7635246,5,B01BHTSIOC,Thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful period piece. Julian Fellowes does not disappoint.,1522195200,,84,6.7272727272727275

7635250,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This was a great show and I ended up binge watching season 1!  It has a great story line and I was so glad to find something so good that didn't have bad language, violence or anything else.  Wish more writers would do that!!",1521676800,,225,4.090909090909091
7635251,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This was one of the best series I've watched so far this year. There were powerful women, men with many flaws, and youngsters trying to do what was best for them despite their parents' interference. I loved every second of it, especially Julian Fellowes introduction and conclusion as bookends to the presentation. During my treadmill walks, I was able to spend 4 days watching the superb writing and acting. I'm hopeful that Julian Fellowes considers doing more of these limited series for Amazon.",1521244800,,498,5.0120481927710845
7635252,5,B01BHTSIOC,Nice period drama.  Well put together and I liked that Julian had a bit to say about each episode.,1520985600,,98,4.157894736842105

7635257,5,B01BHTSIOC,I thought it was fun!  It is definitely worth watching.  It doesn't rip your heart out with drama ... it's a nice escape ... spoiler alert ... with a happy ending .. just as it should be .. like Jane Austen.,1519948800,,207,4.024390243902439

7635259,1,B01BHTSIOC,completely predictable,1519516800,,22,10.5
7635260,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This is fairly lightweight as dramas go.  It's even predictable.  But, it has a happy ending and after Drummond was killed off in ""Victoria,"" I think I needed a happy ending.  Sets, costumes, location, scenes, acting, notable actors - all great.  It's only four episodes so I did the whole series in one evening.",1519257600,,312,4.722222222222222
7635261,5,B01BHTSIOC,Feels much alike to Downton Abbey,1519171200,,33,4.666666666666667
7635262,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I really enjoyed it! I loved Dr Thorne`s performance, I remember him as Mr. Collins in Pride and Prejudice, he was so much better in this story, he held it all together, and such amazing acting with his compassion at the death bed and also his anger at injustices. He was brilliant! My favorite actor.
The whole story was lovely.",1518480000,,329,4.5
7635263,5,B01BHTSIOC,great,1518393600,,5,5.0
7635264,4,B01BHTSIOC,"MOST: The Era, Author, 80% of casting. Rich people being rich complicated good bad. The usual. Fellowes. Bad? Well these storylines have a way of working out happily in the end......so not exactly sitting on the edge of your seat.",1518307200,,230,4.775

7635268,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I absolutely enjoyed watching Doctor Thorne!  <3 This is what I would consider a classic and very original. The storyline is far interesting and I love all the characters! Honestly, I found the last episode to be hilarious after Dr. Thorne announced the news to Frank's mom! I started to crack up lol",1517443200,,300,4.660377358490566
7635269,5,B01BHTSIOC,Really enjoyed this original series.,1516838400,,36,6.4
7635270,5,B01BHTSIOC,I enjoy Trollope very much and the production was beautifully done. I very much appreciated the insight and background from Mr. Fellowes,1516838400,,136,5.2272727272727275
7635271,5,B01BHTSIOC,Positively the best series I have seen.. Incredible acting and brilliant storyline.  My only wish is that there would be more episodes!,1516665600,,135,5.136363636363637
7635272,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I truly enjoyed the four episodes, with the exception of the interruption at the beginning and end of each by Julian Fellowes, an Alfred Hitchcock wannabe.  I would have given the presentation 5 stars were it not for his strange insertion of himself, which appears to be ego gone awry. He would have served this production better by remaining in the writers' room. This was basically a good story. The role of Louis was over acted and poorly done. Loved the role of the charming leading lady.",1516492800,,492,4.655172413793103

7635278,5,B01BHTSIOC,"It was a little hard for me to follow at first, but once I understood how the characters were related to one another I throughoughly enjoyed it. It was a funny, dramatic, romantic, historic, mysterious series.",1515888000,,209,4.833333333333333

7635281,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Innocent, sweet, easy to watch but didn't find it nearly as good as other series I have enjoyed.",1515196800,,96,4.388888888888889
7635282,3,B01BHTSIOC,"A bit boring. Nice sets and costumes. Poor acting and lousy chemistry on the part of the younger actors. Not in line with the customs of the Victorian era. A lazy, contrived period piece at best.",1514505600,,195,4.444444444444445
7635283,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Oh, dear.  I'm a great fan of Anthony Trollope, and Dr. Thorne is one of my favorites.  This adaptation, though, is thin, shallow, and rather vulgar.
One of the joys of Trollope is the sheer volume and flow of language:  the copious back-stories on every character, the long asides to the reader on social mores, the fourth-wall-breaking meta-narrative of the narrator justifying his own choices.  Having taken out all that, the mere plot is only melodrama, and not very compelling at that.
Trollope is quite cheekily aware of the absurdity of his characters, but Fellowes does not seem to be. By playing it more or less straight, he allows the viewer the cheap thrill of feeling superior to the characters; Trollope undercuts the reader's moral superiority by implicating himself as well as the reader.  Trollope serves ambiguity, but Fellowes does away wit all that in favor of obviousness.
There is also something very modern in the performances, especially on the part of Mary and Young Frank, and that is not a compliment.
Very much a made-for-TV movie, with all the shallowness that implies.
The costumes and sets were pretty.",1514332800,2,1132,4.968253968253968
7635284,5,B01BHTSIOC,This movie will be enjoyed by everyone who loves stories of England in the 1800s.,1514246400,,81,4.466666666666667
7635285,1,B01BHTSIOC,"Pathetic little story. A common person absolutely cannot identify with this idiotic story. Here, Scatcherd who made his money by hard work is a drunkard. His son even more so and is called ""pathetic"" by Fellowes at the end. Somehow the Squire who lost all his money through gambling or whatever is to be saved at the end because ""they have been there forever"". What complete utter nonsense.

Same nonsensical premises as Downton Abbey, some rich ""noble"" English family is in trouble and somehow they find some self-made rich person or the heir of the self-made rich person to save their estate via marriage or engagement or an altered Will. Immediately and conveniently that self-made rich person or the heir is bumped off so the main loser characters who are in ""love"" can marry and live happily, not ever after mind you but only for a while, before they inevitably squander the money too.

And people are supposed to like these characters? Every character is hate-able and punch-able in this story. Even the maternally Lady Scatchered who favors mopey Frank over her own son Louis. How do people eat this elephant excrement up?

The costumes were good I guess.",1513814400,,1162,4.8291457286432165
7635286,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I love British period pieces and this did not disappoint.  It's more of a movie shown in parts than a ""season.""  But that's fine.  I watched the whole thing in one sitting.  Great acting and a good adaptation by Julian Fellowes.  Very enjoyable entertainment......",1513728000,,264,4.909090909090909

7635289,5,B01BHTSIOC,a bit of a cross between Austen and Dickens!!!,1512864000,,46,4.222222222222222
7635290,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I enjoyed this adaptation of the book for the most part. My biggest problem is that we never see why Mary is viewed by nearly everyone we meet (Dr Throne, Beatrice, Augusta, Frank, etc) as such a very special person. We see her help her uncle nurse Sir Roger (1 patient); we see her deliver 2 food baskets to poor villagers (1 occasion of good works). That's all. Some conversation where Mary tells her uncle she's going to help such a family, or helping with the church, would have added more to her character. I agree with another reviewer who thought the actress playing Mrs Dunstable much too young; she looked a contemporary to Mary or Frank's sisters, rather than nearly middle aged, as she is in the book.",1512864000,,712,4.5271317829457365

7635295,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I quite enjoyed watching Doctor Thorne! Although the plot was slightly predictable, I found myself eagerly anticipating the next episode. The characters, Dr. Thorne in particular, were intriguing and dynamic; each one brought his/her own flare to the story. The fireside introductions and conclusions to each episode were a nice touch as well. Overall, this series is worth a watch!",1512345600,,382,5.383333333333334

7635299,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Wonderful miniseries! Someone mentioned Doctor Thorne was a ""Step Down"" from Downton Abbey. I don't think you can make a side by side comparison because Downton Abbey was a long running series with a lot of  storylines & character complexities. Doctor Thorne told a simple storyline & the characters were more predictable ~ but still a good well-rounded story!",1512000000,,360,5.101694915254237

Don't waste your time, if that's a commodity that is important to you.",1510531200,,327,5.288461538461538
7635317,5,B01BHTSIOC,I didn't go into this comparing it to Downton Abbey. I never finished Downton Abbey. I enjoyed this a lot. The story did end in what some might call an unrealistic happy ending but so few movies and shows seem to have happy endings anymore. People are complex and life can deal some unfair circumstances but so many shows just end up coming across as so depressing its maddening. I loved the story and thought it was executed really well in this miniseries.,1510358400,,457,4.518072289156627

7635324,4,B01BHTSIOC,"A lovely little period piece. I would have to say the ending is not as shiny as the beginning but a show can only be as good as it's source material. The ending is tied up farrr too tidy for my tastes but I guess that's the Trollope style. I feel the production and acting itself deserves five stars but the narrative is much more three stars.

I still found it delightful for the cast. Tom Hollander as Doctor Thorne is the dad you always wanted. He is just unbelievably charming and fun to watch. For a character that seems to have zero flaws, Hollander makes him so incredibly charismatic and human.

Harry Richardson is of course, a dream as Frank Grisham. He completely lights up the screen with charm. And Stefanie Martini is absolutely delightful as Mary. So yes, a bit frothy and fluffy under the seams but definitely a delightful watch anyways.

As to what to watch next, add Poldark and North & South to your list after all the Austen classics of course :)",1508716800,,966,4.446327683615819
7635325,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Just finished this. It was Ok, but for those expecting another Downton Abbey, it was nowhere near. As you know Julian Fellows was the writer for both. I love period dramas and especially 3 or 4 part adaptations of English classics, like the Jane Austen's you see all the time on Masterpiece Theater. There are 2 better Anthony Trollope adaptations that I have seen. Those are The Way We Live Now and He Knew He Was Right, which are available in many places to view.",1508716800,,465,4.482352941176471

7635332,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I enjoyed the Doctor Thorne miniseries very much. I thought it was visually appealing, well acted, and resonated nicely of Julian Fellows' influence. My regret is the limited duration however, as I viewed it in its' entirety in one morning. Being a steadfast Downton Abbey enthusiast, I am looking for a period drama for the long term to fill in the gaps of time when I have completely rewatched Downton and need something to redirect my attention. I would very much like to see more period offerings from Mr. Fellows in the future - so far I have yet to see anything which has captivated me as much as my all time favorite series - the incomparable Downton Abbey. But I am certainly up to continuing the search, and Dr. Thorne was a very worthy watch.",1507420800,,752,4.536764705882353

7635358,5,B01BHTSIOC,"In his inimitable style Julian Fellowes's charming adaption Dr. Throrne from Anthony Trollope's Chronicles of Barsetshire delights not only his fans of Downton Abbey but fans of Masterpiece Theater and a particular brand of British literature, TV, and movies.
I particularly enjoyed his fireside chat's before and after each episode that were so reminiscent of the Master of Masterpiece Theater Alistair Cook.
Besides his writing skills Mr Fellowes has an eye for historical authenticity so that the characters and settings are very creditable . The countryside was lovely, the stately houses were perfect, the village  charming, and along with the superb costuming made for a charming visual confection.
Some reviewers have referred to it as lightweight and amusing. Both of which I think the world needs a little bit more of.  Happy endings have a great appeal.
I think if Amazon is smart this will be the beginning of a long and happy collaboration with Mr. Fellowes.",1502582400,,970,5.171974522292993

7635365,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Very entertaining.  The series walks a fine line of camp, cheese and quality.  Fortunately, it teeters in the direction of quality, and allows the viewer to enjoy the tale, tongue in cheek.  Lots of fun.  I needed to watch something light hearted and this was able to fill that order without being Hallmark Christmas Movie sentimentality.  Well written, bravo Julian Fellowes.

7635367,5,B01BHTSIOC,I really love the language in this story as well as the plot and characters. I agree with Julian Fellowes; it belongs with the classics. I also thought it was a clever idea to have the actor from Pride and Prejudice (the newer version) play the doctor in this story. It made it stand out more. Thank whoever decided to keep it a clean video for having that idea - it would have ruined it for me had it had anything stupid like that in it.

7635376,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Doctor Thorne is definitely not a ""Downton"" hit. Rather a sorry attempt by Julian Fellowes to formulate success instead of giving Trollope the full respect he deserved.  On the face of it, Doctor Thorne is  just fine and quite enjoyable.  What is not so enjoyable is being subjected to an introduction and epilogue by the egocentric and insufferably pompous Julien Fellowes.

It seemed at first that it was going to be a sad story, but it turned out really well. A little predictable by the time it came to the end of Episode 3, but still I enjoyed it.

Anyway, the story is fine. It's a tale about rich people who spend more than they earn so they have to marry money to maintain their lifestyle. The problem is, they are snobs, and the only people they know with money are beneath them. This snobbery creates some problems for the two lovers who actually don't care about that.

There is some humor and a lot of veiled preaching that I am sure went over well back in the day. The human qualities are intact and the story still plays well today.",1495929600,,643,4.17741935483871

Just my opinion and obviously I am in the minority based on the reviews here but at some point there is such a thing as too much color and this has definitely reached it.  Downton Abbey was much easier on they eyes. I think that this was filmed with a type of technique that must be state of the art but I really do not like it and it detracts from the feeling of authenticity.  IT LOOKS TOO MODERN.

It is not up to old Masterpiece Theater/BBC standards but I am assuming the target audience is less literary, more visual, and wants their stories to move along. The lead actress's make up was a bit much but again maybe meant for a younger audience. I even enjoyed ""Kilwillie's"" intros and wrap-ups. They were a bit campy and trite, but endearing nonetheless.

Everyone else is very boring and predictable in comparison. The only other interesting element is that there is a certain sense of danger that a lot of these types of period series lack, in that two characters fight a losing battle with alcoholism. There was no romance I found myself rooting for. The only thing I really wanted was more on Dr. Thorne and the life he has outside of his niece or the friends he might keep, but unfortunately, we just don't get enough of his character or much on his background. He's clearly an upstanding and honorable man: why has he remained single in a society that is all about connections? I really liked him and the series would benefit from more of him!

Given the 4th & final episode of season 1, it appeared to me that they has already decided against a 2nd season when this last episode aired.",1490400000,,361,4.388059701492537
7635434,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Compared to many videos I soon stopped watching, Doctor Thorne is a delight. Julian Fellowes' interspersed comments are part of the entertainment, making it clear that he was having a good time. An ending predictable long before it arrives did not diminish the pleasure.

Lead roles are well played, and one of Frank's sisters has amazing eyes. Several supporting roles are overplayed, however: At one point, I envisioned Louis, the male villain, twirling his mustache after having laid a young lady across the railroad tracks.

In hopes that Trollope reveals the key rags to riches back story, I've begun to read the book, but it is incredibly wordy. I admire Fellowes' ability to cut to the chase but not his ignoring that important ingredient. In that respect, the video is unpredictable. Some may regard that observation as a spoiler, but I regard it, coupled with aforementioned weak acting, as grounds for awarding only four stars.",1490400000,2,937,5.038709677419355
7635435,4,B01BHTSIOC,"For those who enjoyed period dramas, this one will do quite nicely. Based upon the book of the same name by Anthony Trollope and adapted for television by Julian Fellowes, the creator of Downton Abbey, this is a well-done period drama. The cast is uniformly excellent, as are the settings and costumes. The observance of the social mores of the time serve to ground its authenticity of time and place. Aficionados of period dramas will most definitely like this four part series, though it lacks the grandeur of Downton Abbey.

Dr. Thorne lives with Mary, his niece, in Greshamsbury, home of the Greshams, who used to rule all they surveyed. With the changing of the times, however, money has proven to be in short supply for the Greshams, and the need to marry off the Gresham children to those with deep pockets has become of paramount necessity in order to maintain the status quo. Their mother, the Lady Arabella is determined to ensure that this happens but runs into a roadblock when she discovers that her son, Frank, has fallen in love with Mary. Therein lies the rub.

The machinations of the Lady Arabella to ensure that her plans come to fruition, and the fact that Mary harbors a ruinous secret, all serve to create tension and drama throughout the four episodes. The series concludes with episode four with no loose ends. So, it is a stand alone season in case there is no follow-up. Still, I can't help but hope that there will be a season two.",1490313600,2,1458,4.647286821705427

Like his Downton Abbey, there was nary a surprise to be had, from beginning to end, every plot point as predictable as the rising and setting of the sun.  Zero suspense.  Even so (as with Downton), the settings and costumes were lush, the actors personable, engaging and believable.  For me, Tom Hollander (I'm a fan) as Dr. Thorne was the bulwark of the production, the rock.  Without him (Ian McShane was great too) , the production would've been even more insipid, purely a drama of manners.  One reviewer likened this to Emma or Sense and Sensibility- can't agree with that, they were clever and anything but predictable.  This isn't BAFTA calibre film making by any stretch of the imagination (pun intended) but even so, worth watching for the eye candy and performances.",1489881600,3,867,4.850340136054422

7635462,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Tom Hollander plays ""Doctor Throne,"" the dignified moral center in a miniseries directed by Niall MacCormick and adapted by Julian Fellowes from Anthony Trollope's novel.  The story is set in England during the 1850s.  Thorne's niece, Mary (Stefanie Martini), is a lovely and kindhearted woman who has won the heart of her childhood friend, handsome Frank Gresham (Harry Richardson).  However, nothing is simple in Trollope's world. Frank's family is deeply in debt; if he does not acquire a fortune by making the proper match, the Greshams will lose their estate, status, and comfortable lifestyle.  Frank's mother, Lady Arabella, caustically and frequently reminds her son of his duty.  Still, when Frank gazes into Mary's lovely eyes, he cannot resist telling her that he intends to make her his wife.

Executive producer Julian Fellowes introduces each of the episodes and ""debriefs"" us afterwards. Viewers will ""ooh"" and ""ah"" at the gorgeous scenery, stately mansions, lavish costumes, and meticulous attention to period detail. Hollander is wonderful as an intelligent and reasonable individual who behaves honorably in spite of the pressures he faces. The always watchable Ian McShane stands out as wealthy reprobate Sir Roger Scatcherd, an ill-tempered drunk who treats his wife like a poor relation.  Also notable is Rebecca Front, perfect as the sharp-tongued, mercenary, and domineering Lady Arabella Gresham.  Alison Brie is the wry and witty Lady Dunstable, an American oil heiress who may be getting on in years, but her fortune makes her a prize catch. Alas, Edward Franklin has the thankless task of trying to imbue the role of Louis, Sir Roger's ne'er-do-well son, with a semblance of realism. Louis is an insecure and jealous braggart who clings to his flask like a baby to his bottle.  He is thoroughly one dimensional--an immature, stubborn, and self-destructive wretch.

Its visual splendor notwithstanding, ""Doctor Thorne"" is, at heart, a soap opera in which male and female malcontents do what they can to improve their lot at the expense of others.  Fellowes captures Trollope's dry sense of humor, satirical attitude, and insight into the pettiness, snobbery, and greed of England's pampered classes. In the final episode, the plot is wrapped up as neatly and prettily as an extravagant gift.  This diverting entertainment is easy on the eyes, but only occasionally engages us intellectually and emotionally.  The bonus features are quite good.  Fellowes eloquently expresses his enthusiasm for Trollope, while members of the cast and crew share their views about the making of ""Doctor Thorne.""",1488672000,,2619,5.325242718446602

When I heard that Mr. Fellowes was recreating Tom Hollander, I was excited to see characters come to life. I was not in the least disappointed. Every actor was perfect for their role. Mr. Fellowes has a knack for choosing the right actor for the right role.

Great acting, and we thought the casting was well done.  We enjoyed that the characters weren't ""all bad"" or ""all good"" but dynamic and much more relatable than the usual drama characters who do and say things most people would never do or say.  Its also great to see good entertainment that relies on great visuals, character development, and good acting rather than the shock factor of bad language, infedelity, outrageous plot twists and all that. This is one that the whole family can watch.",1486598400,,659,4.90990990990991

7635630,4,B01BHTSIOC,"This was a fun watch due to the costumes and nastiness of some of the characters who supposedly were refined. The plot was rather predictable. However, there are times when an individual just wants to be entertained and not have to wring out the brain too much. This was a visual beach book.",1486598400,,291,4.509433962264151

7635650,5,B01BHTSIOC,The story is adapted by Julian Fellows from Anthony Alsop's novel so it is a bit more like an adaption from a Jane Austin book than Downton Abbey. The lovers are very sweet and his mother is a bear defending her cub because the family has run out of money and he wants to marry his childhood sweetheart who has none either. You will have to watch it because I'm not going to tell you how it ends.,1486425600,,396,4.089743589743589

7635669,3,B01BHTSIOC,"From the very first minute, you know exactly what is going to happen through the rest of the episode. And it's still great fun! The story line is so typical and the dialogue is riddled with cliches, but the acting is good. Frankly, Oscar Wilde's The Importance Of Being Ernest"" did it much better, but this is still worth watching just to experience the typical Victorian novel. Julian Fellowes's narrative at the beginning is an obvious copy of Alistair Cooke's introduction to Masterpiece Theater years ago. I can't image why his adaptation is so bad when he did such a good job with Downton Abbey. You can guess the ending before you are even halfway through - there are no surprises anywhere in this story.",1486339200,,710,4.688

7635680,3,B01BHTSIOC,I guess I was expecting something with more story/character development like Downton Abby.  The story seemed flat and the plot predictable.  The heroine should probably have some flaws.,1486339200,,185,5.571428571428571
7635681,1,B01BHTSIOC,"In the interest of condensing the novel of Anthony Trollope, Lord Fellowes has not been faithful to the text of Dr. Thorne nor to the development of character typical of Trollope.

7635790,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I recently read many of Trollope' s novels and was thrilled to see that a theatrical adaptation was available.  Yes the movie has some slight changes, but it is a great representation of Trollope' s work.  If you have not exposed yourself to his writing, it can be confusing at first, but all is made clear by the conclusion.  The movie was the same.  I felt as if I read the book for a second time.  Excellent",1486080000,,410,4.2727272727272725

From beginning to end, it was well done.  It's a must watch if you love British aristocratic stories.  The costumes were beautiful.  Julian Fellows reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock when he use to present his films.  Loved his dry sense of humor and witty comments.  Be prepared to watch all four episodes in one sitting. You won't want to wait.  Lol",1485907200,,501,4.52808988764045
7635830,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I enjoyed it and Sir Julian did an excellent job of summarizing the book.  I was so interested in the production that I decided to read the book first.  The book is all about the fact that Frank MUST MARRY money in order not to be evicted from the ancestral home and the machinations of his family as well as the deCourcy's to discourage him from marrying Mary.  There were a few slight changes to the book, but I think they really enhanced the story.  I liked the fact that Frank was totally committed to Mary even when she was poor.  Loved the production and the casting....I only gave it 4 stars because the characters (from the book) weren't that compelling.",1485907200,,662,4.43801652892562

Hard to hold a candle to Downton though, but this is pretty good. I enjoy Julian Fellowes intros where he talks about the Tom Hollander story and the charactershe's a bit of a character himself in a fun way. I would probably give it 5 stars, but I've seen some period dramas that just were a cut above.

This attempt, however, was a rather sad disappointment, but I believe that he probably did the best he could with the story he chose to adapt to the screen. Hopefully the future will find him more discerning regarding what will possibly capture the attention and any high accolades from his audience.

7636049,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Thorne. My husband and I have watched it twice and enjoyed it even more the second time around. Dr. Thorne is Julian Fellowes next project after his huge success with Downton Abby.  Think Jane Austin with before and after fireside chats by Alfred Hitchcock. Its quite apparent Julian Fellowes loves this production and his on camera chats.
Dr. Thorne is not serious television, but a wonderfully delightful escape from violence and reality TV. So, on the next blustery winters evening, curl up with your favorite hot beverage and begin this four part journey back in time.",1485561600,,597,4.97

Could've really done without that and it might have been 4.5 starts. I like to look at the costumes and hairstyles and such as well as following the storylines. Some parts covered things way to fast that could do with a little more time and things that went on and on could have been covered fast.,1485388800,,471,4.186813186813187

7636136,5,B01BHTSIOC,engrossing portrait of class differences and mind set in Victorian England with a nice twist and a great ending for the underdog. I am a student of archaeology and cultural anthropology and loved it so much I hated to see it end. Beautiful costumes beyond excellent examples of architecture complete this series. And Doctor Thorne  played by Tom Hollander aka Doctor Who is a plus.,1485388800,,381,4.861538461538461

7636210,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I have only seen the first two episodes, but so far I like it.  The characters are interesting and there is a huge distinction between the classes.

7636222,3,B01BHTSIOC,"It's no Downton Abbey, but it's satisfying for as short as it is. With only 4ish episodes, you can only develop the characters so much. Dr. Thorne himself was very good, witty, understated sense of humor, patient but obviously very caring and invested in his niece/adopted-daughter.

It was a little bit difficult at first to get the who's-who of the noble families though.

I suppose much of this would be the fault of the original author rather than Fellowes, but still....it's just getting good when it ends.",1485216000,,511,4.862068965517241
7636223,4,B01BHTSIOC,"This is an entertaining series in the genre of Downton Abbey about the challenges of life in 19th century England in the context of the old British class system. This class system was portrayed as causing complications to members of both the upper and lower classes in issues of personal liberty, free choice, personal responsibility, and family and societal expectations.  The acting and story line is good, but in my estimation neither with quite the quality of Downton Abbey..",1485216000,,479,5.063291139240507

At least it is was wrapped up in a decent amount of time in like the seemingly endless Downtown Abbey. Of you delight in Trollope, then maybe this is your cup of tea.

7636321,5,B01BHTSIOC,"My wife and I both love all things England, especially the history, stories, myths and lore of the landed, titled gentry. From Upstairs, Downstairs, to Downton Abbey, and Sherlock Holmes to Gosford Park. We're now watching Victoria on Netflix. But, having read many of Trollope's works about Victorian England earlier in my life, I stumbled across this 4-episode gem that was adapted by Downton Abbey's creator Julian Fellowes. It's on Amazon Prime, and the story has been cut into four roughly 45-minute episodes. However, we consumed these in one sitting, and it was well worth it. The cast was perfect for their respective roles, although most of them are not well known here in America. But, in English circles, many are regulars in television, movie and stage roles. They were marvelous as either representative of inherited wealth, the newly ""working"" wealthy and the more common folks of the village...such as Dr. Thorne. It turns out, he has a secret about his niece that is later revealed (no spoilers here!), and at the end of the episodes you are left feeling that all is right with the world of Victorian England. The ""bad"" guy gets his comeuppance, and the two young stars of the story both enjoy life together. Would love to see the a follow-up series on what happens next to everyone in the story. But, that would be taking license with Trollope's original story, so Mr. Fellowes may not go beyond this very well-done adaptation.

If you like Downton Abbey, I feel certain you'll really enjoy binging this 4-episode Amazon Prime television drama. Mr. Fellowes introduces each episode fireside in a small study, and adds some commentary at the end of each episode. His commentary is worth watching all by itself.",1485129600,,1726,4.910958904109589

Because I like the writing of Anthony Trollope and his social commentaries of the day, I was disappointed by this video version.

7636464,5,B01BHTSIOC,"First rate acting, lavish sets, and beautiful English countyside, plus a fairy-tale plot (think Cinderella) and you have an thoroughly enjoyable four-part mini-series. There are likable characters to root for (Frank, Mary, Dr Thorne, Lady Skatchet, Squire Greshem), and unlikable (but not evil) antagonists. I haven't read the Anthony Trollope novel on which it is based, but, as would be expected of Julian Fellowes, the screenplay is articulate and funny, and satisfying.",1484697600,,473,5.583333333333333

7636466,4,B01BHTSIOC,Good enough but not outstanding.,1484697600,,32,5.6
7636467,3,B01BHTSIOC,"It was no Downton Abbey (early seasons) in terms of how engaging it was. Some of the acting wasn't very good. The guy who played Frank was not the best actor and he looked too young to be matched up with the lead actress. It wasn't believable that they grew up together. Some of the other actors were great. It was very predictable, but overall, it was moderately enjoyable.",1484697600,,374,4.434782608695652

7636471,5,B01BHTSIOC,I stumbled onto this story when exploring Amazon Prime video..  I really enjoyed it.  I am a fan of Julian Fellows who produced it.  Because of watching the four part story I purchased the other Trollope books on Kindle.  This story was season 1 and there was no information given as to season 2.,1484697600,,296,4.425925925925926

7636486,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Well done adaptation. I thought the acting was very good, especially the character of Dr. Thorne, who was played with a subtle touch by Tom Hollander. The story is one fans of Jane Austen would appreciate: love thwarted by social standing and the need for money. Even though you can guess the ending very early on -- the penniless woman ends up with all the money, so that true love (subsidized by 500,000 BPS) prevails -- the journey there is nonetheless enjoyable.

The only detraction for me was the somewhat pompous introduction of each episode by Julian Fellowes. And even that produced some gems: Trollope invented the ubiquitous red post box. Who knew?

I have already recommended this to a friend.",1484697600,,705,4.818181818181818

7636494,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I've watched this twice in the span of about four days. Dr Thorne is one of my two favorite Trollope novels (the other favorite is Orley Farm). And Julien Fellowes did a SPLENDID job of winnowing a long complicated novel into four short episodes while still catching all the important highlights. Ian McShane is incredible, of course. Tom Hollander is a perfect Dr. Thorne, quiet and moral and kind and just the kind of person you want in your corner. I hope Fellowes does more of the Trollope novels. Just wonderful.",1484697600,,517,4.6923076923076925

7636523,2,B01BHTSIOC,"It's not exactly bad, but after watching DA and some other BBC type productions, this one is kind of disappointing.  The settings are very pretty, so if you enjoy beautiful castles and pastoral landscapes this might be your cup of tea.  I found it distracting to have Mr. Fellowes constantly popping up to explain the obvious, it was kind of like he misses being in front of the camera instead of behind it.  After watching 3 or 4 episodes I think we are going to take a break and catch up on some NCIS, I need a little bit of an action fix.",1484524800,,541,4.233009708737864

I also skipped Julian Fellowes's monologues. They were completely unnecessary. The characters and actors were pretty engaging, though. It's not a very long series, so if you're a fan of Downton Abbey or period dramas in general, I'd say go for it. This series also made me want to see more of Tom Hollander, who plays Doctor Thorne.

Didn't understand all the flowers (were they artificial?) in the women's hair.  Perhaps done at that time but some of it really looked stupid.,1484265600,,306,5.468085106382978

7636678,4,B01BHTSIOC,"The actual show it's self was very good, but really does not compare to Downton Abbey. The most annoying part was Julian Fellows introductions and comments afterwards. That is just him tooting his own horn and really unnecessary.",1484179200,,229,5.052631578947368

7636686,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This is a short series of 4 parts. It is fast moving and has a great plot that is rather predictable, but is very entertaining. This is a comedy wrapped up in a drama that will keep you entertained throughout and it ends with nearly everyone in the story happy - somewhat to their to surprise.",1484179200,,293,4.25
7636687,2,B01BHTSIOC,I found it disappointing.  It was short and predictable.  The filming was not the quality of Downton Abbey to which it had been compared.,1484179200,,137,4.666666666666667

7636726,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Julian Fellowes has dumbed down a very smart and funny book, and unnecessarily. He removed the complexity from a number of characters, and in what seems a very patronizing move towards his American audience (of which I am part), makes Miss Dunstable American, and then a deal more attractive than she is supposed to be. How tedious. Must everyone that is wise look beautiful? He doesn't allow Fred to be foolish in the beginning, but instead Fellowes makes him into a vacuous love lorn Ken doll the whole time, and so he becomes quite one dimensional and is not able to grow.  And it is neither credible nor particularly gratifying to see Mr. Moffatt made into a hero for class equality. Fellowes has robbed a delicious story of its complexity and depth, and made it into suggary melodrama.  (Tom Hollander and Ian McShane are both, on the other hand,  wonderful, in the midst of this. And their scenes together make you yearn for more of them, and less Barbie and Ken).

And really, Mr. Fellowes, the Alistair Cook impersonation in the library is embarrassing.",1484092800,20,1061,4.75
7636727,5,B01BHTSIOC,"My husband and I both loved Dr. Thorne. We have re-watched it several times now.

7636875,4,B01BHTSIOC,"As a Trollope lover, this Doctor Thorne production was a real treat. I have watched it four times, and loved each viewing. To me, the production values and script are true to Trollope's writing and to his time. He wrote about the social, economic religious and political issues and values of Victorian England, but always packaged them in a great love story, and usually with a happy ending. This Jullian Fellowes production meets all those objectives. I have one small but nagging complaint: the portrayal of Sir Louis Scatcherd. It seemed more like a caricature of a spoiled rogue than a portrait of one. The performance becomes distracting, and detracts a little from the whole picture. It might have served the story better to have a slightly more sympathetic (but still spoiled and rogueish) Scatcherd.

Like I said, it's a small complaint.",1483920000,,845,4.950704225352113

7636937,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Everything was spelled out in the first ten minutes. I like a little intrigue. Let me figure out the characters before you shove them down my throat. Right off the bat, you know who is good and who is bad. Romeo and Juliet are obvious, and the opposing family members are sooooo predictable. I don't know if I will watch the entire series. It's as if it were written for children. Oh, and in case you forgot, Fellowes is there to remind you that he also made Downton Abbey.",1483833600,,473,4.325842696629214

7636950,3,B01BHTSIOC,"The series was alright but not great. I have watched  three other series based on books by Anthony Trollope like ""The Way We Live Now"", ""He Knew He Was Right"" and ""The Barchester Chronicles."" on PBS. The actors did their best and the locations and costuming were excellent. But the plot and sub plots were trite.",1483747200,,312,4.571428571428571
7636951,5,B01BHTSIOC,Fabulous. A real gem.,1483747200,,21,4.5
7636952,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This series was absolutely uplifting-even the villains had charm and panache! I just smiled throughout at all the intrigue, nonsense and hope. But I was debated when it ended... Hope more stories from Trollop follow.",1483747200,,216,5.2
7636953,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Watched it twice and loved it. Jane Austin without the brooding leading man. Lots of twists, humor and character development with great costume and scenery. Beautifully done by Fellowes. A must see for period piece lovers. I hope he does more Trollope.",1483747200,,252,5.023809523809524
7636954,5,B01BHTSIOC,If you liked Downton Abbey you will want to watch this.,1483747200,,55,4.090909090909091
7636955,5,B01BHTSIOC,Funny and much more family friendly than Downton Abbey,1483747200,,54,5.111111111111111
7636956,3,B01BHTSIOC,Some of the acting is sub par. The beginning of the first episode seems rushed and the characters are difficult to place familialy at first. But the characters become well defined and the story is told well. The show becomes very addictive.,1483747200,,240,4.738095238095238
7636957,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Took a bit to get into it, but I enjoyed it after I got immersed in the characters",1483747200,,82,3.611111111111111

7636959,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Delightful!  You can't go wrong with J. Fellowes and A. Trollope. Tom Hollander is a wonderful actor and plays the leading role beautifully.  Alison Brie is excellent as the American heiress.  I would love to see more adaptations by Mr. Fellowes in the future.  And some original stories, too!",1483747200,,293,4.918367346938775

7636961,5,B01BHTSIOC,Thoroughly enjoyed the series. A quick story with intetesting characters. The acting was very good. The intro by the creator was informative but a tad bit long. Definitely recommend it if you need a little historical romance fix. The nicest surprise for me was the actor Tom Hollander.  I have seen him in pride and prejudice play a very odious self righteous parson. So playing this different character with love and compassion was a treat.,1483747200,,441,4.88
7636962,5,B01BHTSIOC,Very entertaining,1483747200,,17,8.0
7636963,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Satisfied my desire for a nice period show, however the short season made for characters that didn't have entirely enough time to develop into interesting people you wanted to know. Of course after Downton Abby, I had pretty high expectations. Overall good and I'd watch a 2nd season. But not rating it higher.",1483747200,,310,4.867924528301887

7637020,4,B01BHTSIOC,"this was an entertaining short series to watch. Not much depth to it, but at least it had no machine guns, bad language, or racing car scenes! It was an easy relaxing, predictable, portrayal of a typical classist society. The scenes were wonderful displayed along with the costumes, hairdos and nice looking people. Mr. Fellows did an excellent job both before and after each series, creating curiosity in the beginning and tying it all together at the end.",1483574400,,457,4.871794871794871

The outdoor shots were overly saturated with green and yellow while the close ups of everyone's faces were completely out of focus. I don't understand how this has such great reviews. The storyline was awful and so was the acting. Lastly, I feel embarrassed for Allison Brie.

In the 70's, watching the Pallisers is what made me begin to read him and there have only been two further adaptations that I know of since then, both very good. I love Julian Fellowes and it is nice to see him introduce the series as well as writing the adaptations (though he does appear to be more like Alfred Hitchcock than Alistair Cook!). The acting is first rate and I always love the British use of the same actors that appear in other British products (like Tom Hollander).

7637157,3,B01BHTSIOC,Very nice cinematograpy and very good acting.  Like most victorian stories Doctor Thorne turns what appears to be a tragedy into a happy ending if a somewhat contrived and unlikely turn of events.  Each show begins and ends with commentary from an English gentlemen who tells some of the back story and seems to model himself after Alfred Hitchcock.,1483401600,,349,4.898305084745763

7637161,5,B01BHTSIOC,"a beautiful rendition of the novel.  Although not absolutely faithful in chronology and substance to the book, the cinema captures the essence of the inner thoughts of the principal characters, which cannot be represented in words.  It is a wonderful complement to the book in that it presents the glory and magnificence of the three principal dwellings as well as the lush countryside and the flavor of the countryside.  But it also stands on its own--if you have not read the book and never plan to, you will enjoy the drama and suspense of this novel as well as an understanding of the important of money, class, and title in nineteenth century England.",1483401600,,656,4.787610619469026

7637243,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Doctor Thorne is like a pair of comfortable jeans. You know what to expect, you think fondly of it, and it makes you happy.  I couldn't help but smile watching this with my wife. Julian Fellowes hits all the right notes with this period peace about love and it's challenges in the rigid class system of England.
The characters you are cheering for are all likeable and very well played and the heels are irksome just as you would expect them to be.
I do feel like calling this a season of a show is a bit of a stretch. The story arc very much feels like a film that they artificially broke up into episodes but it doesn't detract from the show at all. I also enjoyed hearing Fellowes excitedly talk about the story during his debriefs.
If you were hoping for a Downton Abbey replacement you need to look elsewhere. This is much more of an appetizer portion than a 7 course meal like Downton, buts it's still quite enjoyable for what it is.
There's no question if you enjoy this kind of period drama you won't be disappointed with Dr. Thorne. I only hope they will have other stories to tell around these characters.",1483315200,8,1115,4.386473429951691

7637248,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I know how to MUTE Julian Fellowes with the touch of a button. And thank God for it.  Now if only someone would have the guts to edit his sloppy writing.  As he did in Downton Abby, Julian Fellowes never met a plot twist he didn't enjoy revealing over and over and over again.  Who is Mary's true father?  And how many of the characters need to hear the exact SAME answer before they all finally know what WE knew from the first episode?  His ham-fisted writing is as patronizing as his Alistair Cooke introductions.  But this adaptation is still very watchable because of the great actors he employs.  Could easily have been trimmed to under two hours and have been tighter and better for it.",1483315200,,693,4.4523809523809526

We were not sure how many episodes this series when we began watching it and were somewhat disappointed to see it was only 4. However, unlike some of the movies we have watched recently, this was a wonderful story and series that had a beginning, a great middle and a wonderful end that was suitable to either ending the series or allowing it to continue.  Way too many movies and series do not seem to have a great ending, but this was the exception.

Great acting by great actors and again I cannot emphasize enough the wonderful English countryside and background that can only be fully experienced with one of the newer HD TV's.

We look forward to the possibility of a Season 2 but if it never happens, we are very happy to have had the opportunity to view this short series.",1483142400,,837,4.493421052631579

7637360,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Bringing Anthony Trollope' s wonderful series ""Barchester""  to life again is pure delight and these stories are perfectly suited to come under the skilfull pen of Mr. Fellowes.
Every nuance of class, status and money from the shores of the New World of America to the rigid rules that hold sway over the newly minted American Society is carefully but subtly shown by look, shoulder turn and the odd robust whisker shiver from a Gentleman.
I am looking forward to another Fellowes ""binge"" with Doctor Thorne.",1483056000,,507,4.895348837209302

I've watched it twice.",1482796800,,331,4.533333333333333
7637476,5,B01BHTSIOC,Nice program.  I have not read the book but will do so.  The ending was predictable but that is a reflection on the writing of the time and not the adaptation.  Well done.,1482796800,,171,4.121212121212121

7637508,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Doctor Thorne has nicely developed personalities with backgrounds (and baggage).  The viewer can easily delve into their relationships as they crisscross each other's lives.  Even in that genteel era, when society was still heavy on manners and expectations, they too had to bear the universal sorrows of all people everywhere,...but somehow these characters make it look like it was a better time and place to live.",1482710400,,416,5.287878787878788

Dr. Thorne has nowhere near as many plot lines as Downton Abbey had, but it was still intriguing.

7637606,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I just watched the first episode of Dr Thorne and am hooked.  I love 19th century British stories and this one is perfect.  It has all the trappings of a Jane Austin novel, though it is by Trollope and the adaptation is by Julian Fellowes.  This is a keeper. A very good show.",1482278400,,276,4.169811320754717
7637607,5,B01BHTSIOC,Off to an interesting start. Fellowes's comments concerning the author and his skill in developing complex characters are remarkably revealing. What a treat it is to see literary discussion as part of a dramatic commentary.,1482278400,,223,5.4
7637608,4,B01BHTSIOC,I enjoy historical romance movies and this does not disappoint.  Clearly Julian Fellowes is a master of this genre.  Four episodes is a short season but hopefully there will be more to follow in future seasons?,1482278400,,210,4.805555555555555

7637634,3,B01BHTSIOC,"So far - OK. This and probably nothing else measures up to Downton Abbey with its wonderful story. Doc Thorne is certainly worth watching, though. Costumes, scenery, interiors, cinematography, are fantastic! The two romantic leads are quite attractive, but along with the rest of the cast, seem a bit wooden. Probably the fault of dear Julian. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to Episode 2!",1482192000,,392,5.140625

7637649,1,B01BHTSIOC,"It doesn't come close to Downton Abbey. That bar was set  pretty high. Even though this is a different type of story but the music and acting is fair. I love Fellows as a writer. He is a genius. Maybe he was restricted by the writing in the book.

The characters are very richly developed and the underlying tensions are well written.  I particularly liked the scene toward the end where the ""tables are turned"" and reveal all the changes in circumstance.  Tom Hollander did a lovely job with his character, and the other actors perform beautifully in the roles they have.  If you are looking for a 4-hour or so diversion, I highly recommend this quality show.  If you loved Downton Abbey, you'll definitely like this.",1482105600,,582,5.148936170212766

7637801,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I love finding British costume dramas, especially based on classic literature. And a Julian Fellowes adapted British costume drama doesn't disappoint. I have yet to read any Anthony Trollope's novels, but after this series, my interest is piqued to read a few. I didn't know many of the actors in this 4 part miniseries except for the excellent Tom Hollander (Wives and Daughters, 2005 Pride and Prejudice/Mr. Collins) but I enjoyed them all. Sir Julian hosts the beginning and end of every episode, in Alistair Cooke Masterpiece Theatre style, which I enjoyed. It reminded me a lot of Dickens meets Elizabeth Gaskell. Not an overlong series, and concludes with the fourth episode. Sometimes the Season 1 tag on many of these series is misleading. But sometimes I am only in the mood for a series I can binge in just a few hours, and this fit the bill nicely. Well done, Amazon. I hope you will create more of these types of series.",1481846400,,932,4.723926380368098

Very nice love story and the villain got his due - as well he should have.  Even Julian Fellowes thought justice was done - and he was the host who introduced each episode!

I must say it takes a lot of searching on Amazon to find a movie that justifies the time spent watching it.  Most of the movie titles make me shudder because they're such obvious junk.  Search search search - and then get out the Kindle and read a book.",1481846400,,545,4.1826923076923075

7637908,1,B01BHTSIOC,"So disappointed with Doctor Thorne. Could not even bring myself to finish the fourth episode. Maybe I set my expectations too high being a fan of Downton Abbey, The Forsyte Saga, and more recently Poldark but all British period dramas are not created equal. I love Julian Fellows but what was this? Like some of the other reviewers I agree that it probably wasn't Julian Fellows fault solely that this was bad. As a HUGE Downton Abbey fan and Julian Fellows fan disapointed that there were times when he literally used lines from Downtown Abbey in Doctor Thorne. Discredits Downton in my opinion in this way and when it uses Lady Rosamond's London house for Greshemsbury-others would think that's absurd but that's my opinion. I can't pinpoint exactly why I hated about this but mostly I think the plot is just terribly predictable and uninteresting which sometimes can be overcome when other things are done well but this just wasn't. I can see how Ms. Dunstable could have been an interesting character but she is suppose to be 35 or something and the actress looks the same age as ""20 year old"" Mary Thorne and isn't even likable plus is doing a fake American accent? Main characters-Frank and Mary aren't even likable and their acting is not captivating which again maybe isn't really their fault just the script, etc. Some of the characters are flat out annoying i.e. Lady Arabella and her daughters. This adaptation is simply goofy at times I'm not sure if it was suppose to be funny but I didn't find it funny at all. The only good thing is probably the beautiful landscapes and houses. Horrible casting across the board which is probably the main reason this failed in my option. For example, the actress who plays Lady Susan in Downton is the Aunt in this and she is a great actress and great in Downton but in this she is just annoying for lack of a better word. Overall it's bad because it lacks emotion, intrigue, characters you can connect to or even care about what happens to them. I could see how this is probably a good book just wondering how it could have been adapted better? Literally watched an American Girl movie when I got bored of this that was more interesting. I wasn't even excited or interested after watching the trailer for this even though I knew Fellows was doing it if that tells you anything.",1481500800,,2328,4.625603864734299

7637926,5,B01BHTSIOC,I enjoyed this little series. It was predictable but an enjoyable ride. The acting was superb and Julian Fellows knows how to write a compelling script. Worth the time! In fact I watched the final episode a second time.,1481500800,,219,4.641025641025641

7637940,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Typical beautiful English castle/country settings with handsome characters.  But the story really becomes totally predictable after the first episode or two.  Once you know the relationship of the characters, it doesn't take much more from there.
Pleasantly diverting, but no harm if you don't catch it!",1481414400,,303,5.565217391304348

7637953,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Love the raw emotions and irritations of the main characters. The intermixing of the class structure and the ""bought"" titled mix with the generation titled is very interesting. It truly shows the irritations of the struggles of the upper class and the desire to hold close what they are accustomed to. There are many correlations of people's present day struggles.

Mr. Hollander is a pleasant welcome at the start of each episode inviting the viewer into his sitting room and explaining the inter dynamics of the characters. Excellent, I will watch this again!",1481414400,,561,5.032258064516129

7637957,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Trollope adaptations  require a deft hand, and although the story was of necessity condensed, Julian Fellowes did a good job of dramatizing it with a first rate cast.  Was more of a play than a movie.",1481328000,,200,4.527777777777778
7637958,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Julian Fellowes did a lovely job bringing this Anthony Trollope book to the screen: excellent interpretation of the book, acting, costuming, sets, musical scores, and brilliant flashes of humor and irony. My family loved it!",1481328000,,224,5.428571428571429
7637959,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Heroine is stunning. Acting is passable (I do wish the drunk hadn't been a NONSTOP tippler... we GET  that he's a drunk). Although Fellowes, in full  Allistair Cooke mode, makes a point of distinguishing between Dickens and Trollope (the latter being much more reality based, his characters far more nuanced) this rendition looks more like a Dickensian romp.  As a Trollope fan, i was delighted to see him getting the attention; can't wait for a production of ""Can You Forgive Her.""",1481328000,,482,4.925925925925926

7637975,2,B01BHTSIOC,"I would have rated it higher based on the content, but being subjected to Julian Fellowes' BEFORE AND AFTER EVERY EPISODE diminished it so much. Good writers/directors should not have to explain anything if they have done a good job. The actor who was not able to make it in that world (Julian Fellowes) is showing us why he never made it as an actor. PLEASE edit him out the next season! Hs ego seems to have no bounds.

7637990,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I had perhaps unfairly high expectations for this show because it was written by Julian Fellowes. Goes to show a television production is a team effort, and the success of Downton was only partially to his credit. Not that Doctor Thorne is bad ... it's enjoyable but rather average. One would expect far more than average from Fellowes, following Downton. As other reviewers have said, it was completely predictable. It's worth a lazy snow-day marathon but doesn't need to go to the top of your must-see list.",1481241600,,509,4.862068965517241

7637992,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Mr. Fellowes follows up Downton Abbey with this beautifully-filmed, dramatic, intriguing and sometimes comical period piece.  He even breaks in periodically (filmed sitting in a plush chair in front of a cozy fireplace) to explain and comment on the story as it progresses.  Some of the English accents are thick and hard to understand, but Mr. Fellowes's commentary helps in tracking plot, sub-plots. and characters.  Highly recommended for folks who like this type of English period piece and you know who you are.",1481241600,,516,5.192771084337349

Nothing will be probably ever be as perfect as Downton Abbey. However if you enjoy British period dramas you should enjoy Doctor Thorne!

7638201,5,B01BHTSIOC,"A delightful little tale by Anthony Trollope, centered around the character of Dr. Thorne. Vibrant colors, beautiful costumes and memorable characters bestow upon this 4-episode cinematic rendition a most agreeable air. With some twists and an unexpected major turn, Malice is appropriately punished and goodness rewarded, guaranteeing a most satisfactory ending. Don't miss it. 5 stars",1480550400,,386,5.910714285714286

I did not open this DVD until I finished watching Downton Abbey. As soon as I put it in, the screen read that it was incompatible. Not exactly sure what that means but I think it is formatted in a different way since it shipped from Great Britain. When I asked to return it, my time for return had expired.

7638216,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Good actors, quality scenes, costumes, etc. But the story was too shallow and predictable. The only thing that makes it sound interesting and mysterious was the words of the man speaking at the beginnings and ends of each episode. He was talking about a ""vicious triangle of love and jealousy"", but in reality there wasn't any such intense moments. Only a sudden appearance of a drunken young man, his sudden desire to have Dr. Thorne's daughter and then his conveniently sudden death. You can actually predict his death from the moment he appears since the talks are all about wills, fortunes, and debts.",1479859200,2,605,4.883495145631068

7638235,5,B01BHTSIOC,I am very turned off by the filthy language used today in movies! I enjoy watching these movies from the 1800's and 1900's when women were treated like ladies and no bad language.,1479772800,,179,4.454545454545454

7638246,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Another great dramatization of an Anthony Trollope novel - by Julian Fellowes, who also introduces each of the 4 episodes.  Familiar faces from British series pop up in unexpected roles with some wonderful newcomers (to me anyway).  Very bad men repent on their deathbeds - but are satisfyingly dreadful for much of their screen time.  Virtuous behavior is rewarded more genteelly than in Dickens.  Amazingly the character whose sentiments may be most understandable to American viewers is American.  Miss Dunstable is a delight, making me want to read the book again.  Very highly recommended.",1479772800,,594,5.26595744680851

7638248,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I attempted to read the book, but I found that Trollope's style is just too much work.  I don't mind having to exercise my brain, but I found myself saying over and over ""just tell the story!""  I watched the movie and was much more satisfied.  The story moved along and we weren't forced to follow the inner workings of the storyteller's mind.  I don't often say this, but the movie was better than the book.",1479772800,,408,4.328947368421052

The story is very ""Austenesque"" and the acting, as with all of Julian Fellows productions, is excellent. Tom Hollander (who played the annoying Mr. Collins in the movie ""Pride & Prejudice"" starring Kiera Knightly)  does his usual stellar job as Dr. Thorne.

7638320,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Lovely series. Julian fellows narrative before and after each episode I thoroughly enjoyed. It's not hard to figure out the plot but the doctor is wonderful in his unflappable good natured handling of all that transpires. The cast has some faces you will have seen over the years in other British series.  I enjoyed this, for it is a wonderful glimpse into Victorian England with the layers of society and snobbery which people were locked into or out of depending on their birthright. This little series doesn't deserved to be picked apart and analyzed, just sit back and ENJOY.",1479168000,,579,4.848484848484849

7638337,4,B01BHTSIOC,"An adaptation of Anthony Trollope done Masterpiece Theatre style this is beautifully acted and filmed. Amazing estates, lovely period costumes and a well contrived melodrama of a plot, if a bit predictable. Some of the characters are a bit two dimensional but Dr. Thorne is a brilliant statesman and it's hard not to like his niece Mary and her suitor Frank Gresham.",1479168000,,366,4.919354838709677
7638338,3,B01BHTSIOC,"i love Julian Fellowes.  His costumes are fabulous and he makes a time period in England--which I studied in college many, many years ago-live.  The scenery is wonderful and I feel I'm there.  I was a Downton Abbey fanatic and almost cried when Matthew died, etc.  He is a historian and a dramatist.

This story does not rise to the occasion.  I cant' believe the story, which seems to me to be a vehicle for costumes and scenery. I don't want this to discourage Mr. Fellowes, but I can't applaud it as loudly as I'd like. I'm disappointed that I had to rate it --generously--as a 3 star.",1479168000,,588,4.398148148148148

The acting is good and the costumes are beautiful. Well worth the binge-watching time it took up (I did fold laundry whilst watching so not a complete loss of time). If you liked Downton Abbey and you liked some of the more recent versions of Jane Eyre, then chances are you will like this too.

7638437,5,B01BHTSIOC,A thoroughly enjoyable and engaging English melodrama from the pen of literary giant Anthony Trollope brought to the screen by Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes... Tom Hollander is magnificent!,1478563200,,197,5.827586206896552

7638445,4,B01BHTSIOC,"This was a well produced and scripted costume drama, enacted by England's seemingly never-ending supply of first rate actors. The story is based on a novel by Trollope, never one of my favorite British novelist, but after viewing this, I may give his works a look-see. Another thing that England has in abundant supply is grandiose country houses, several of which Mr. Fellowes utilizies in this production, i.e., to good effect. Inevitably, one may compare this to Downton Abbey, and find this is lacking, but then, it can be said that of its type, Downton Abbey is incomparable, and anyway, this doesn't trail D.A. by that much.
Since this is a good story which is well acted and well presented, why not give it a try? You may be pleasantly surprised, as I was.",1478563200,,763,4.701492537313433

7638467,3,B01BHTSIOC,Julian is not Alistair Cooke and Doctor Thorne is not Masterpiece Theatre.  It isn't even Downton Abbey.  The character development is very shallow and with no disrespect to Trollope the story has been told before and better.  The best thing about it was its brevity.,1478476800,,267,4.888888888888889
7638468,4,B01BHTSIOC,Well-done and pretty.  Young actor playing the villain lacked necessary oozing charm; just too obvious.  Others did a fine job with Fellowes' fine adaptation.,1478476800,,158,5.541666666666667

I can only say that this story is so relavent even to today's modern times. All of ys good people are doing what we can to be happy & generous & helpful to others. All of the prople who only care about themselves & live a life of greed & entitlement,well,let's just say that we all usually get what we deserve in the end.

7638527,4,B01BHTSIOC,"This is a beautiful production! Love the costumes, the countryside and the homes of the nobility, inside and out. The actors are all well cast and play their parts in a wickedly delicious manner. But, because I have just finished reading Trollope's book, I find that Julian Fellowes' version feels like a ""Doctor Thorne, Light"". Obviously, Fellowes is very good at incorporating the back story into the present without going on and on like Trollope very deliciously does, but so much else is lost, like the hypochondria of Lady Gresham after she has lost so very many babies/children and so her need for the services of Dr. Thorne while banishing his niece from consorting with her only son, and like Trollope's extensive and ongoing critique of  the way the elections of the time were being conducted. Anyway, I enjoyed this visual presentation but wished it had been somewhat more nuanced. Also, I do not understand how this can be labeled ""Season 1"" since the entire plot of the book has been presented already???",1478304000,,1016,4.872832369942197

7638536,3,B01BHTSIOC,"The show is interesting and in places great. Although it is based on a series of novels written by Anthony Trollope, the basic plot has many of the same elements of Downton Abbey-uppercrust society, arranged marriages and secrets. The show cast includes some very great actors such as Tom Hollander and Ian McShane (who only appears briefly in 2 episodes). While it shares many common themes with Downton Abbey, it plods along in many places and the characters are not quite as interesting. Most are very 2-dimensional and could have been updated for the series. That said-it's a good watch.
I could have done without the previews and debriefs by Julian Fellowes.",1478304000,,663,4.928571428571429

7638577,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I thought it was a great show. I enjoyed that Julian Fellowes gave some information prior to and after each episode.

7638586,3,B01BHTSIOC,The performances are first rate but the story line and ending are transparent after only one episode. The story is typical of Trollop and the authors of the period. This will not be as interesting and character driven as Downton Abby.,1477958400,,234,4.7317073170731705

7638595,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Very well-done.  Plot is delicious with its full-circle denouement.  I was hungry for some English period drama (having withdrawal after Downton ended) when I found Doctor Thorne.  While it is not Downton, it was quite delightful in its own right!",1477958400,,247,5.125
7638596,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I love Tom Hollander. What a terrific actor! First appreciated him in Pride and Prejudice for his comedic genius. He can nuance a character as few can do. The depth of talent he exhibits as Dr. Thorne was sensitive and touching. Loved this series. All the characters do a bang up job, but Tom was the best. It caused me to find more with him starring, and I found another gem, ""Rev. "" in which he plays an inner city reverend. Perfect!",1477958400,,435,4.317073170731708

7638612,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I was happy to find this new Julian Fellowes creation!  It was done very well - both in dialogue, and in the acting.  The cast was great!  Yes, this may have been a predictable period drama, but I loved it!  Each actor performed his part so well.  I even like the ""Masterpiece"" touch of Julian Fellowes sitting in a chair by the fire introducing each episode.  What I am wondering, though, is will there really be a ""Season Two""??  This story is completed, so will Julian Fellowes adapt another book or part of a book?  It seems strange to label this set of episodes as ""Season One"" if it is the one and only.  And since I'm sure that no one connected with this film will answer my query, I'll have to be satisfied that I did enjoy this film.  I would (and have) recommend it!",1477958400,,776,4.2534246575342465

7638617,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I love it! I was looking for something with a Jane Austen feel, and this is it! I was most entertained and laughed out loud several times. I was suprised at the higher TV rating, because for the most part it is family friendly. It is true that parts of the story are predictible, but I enjoyed the journey so much, I really didn't care.

7638763,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This is an excellent period piece that was very enjoyable to watch.  The production values were high, the acting was very good, the scenery and costumes were appropriate and well-done, the social satire and low-key humor were deftly presented, and the plot and action unfolded and moved to the conclusion in a coherent and well-paced manner.  Unlike the poor quality and mediocre presentation of many modern movies and TV mini-series, this show was great.  I wish more movies and mini-series would strive to match the quality of this one.  I hope Julian Fellowes and his collaborators make many more like this gem.",1477180800,,614,4.990196078431373

7638778,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I found Dr. Thorne to be a sweet, predictable English period drama, but I happen to like sweet predictable period dramas. The story takes place around 1855 in England among the privileged class. The length of this series was not too long, but it was sufficient to tell the story, and it held my interest from beginning to end. The film features some beautiful photography and gives one a glimpse of the life of those living during this period.  I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a brief escape into 19th century England.",1477094400,,537,4.652631578947369

7638825,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Enjoyed the very short season - the acting was a bit stilted at times and the plot probably too predictable, but can't complain too much since it's based on a novel written in time of the setting of the show. Enjoyed Julian Fellowes presentation and breakdown, but he could probably realize that the audience would be slightly more educated and able to handle slightly more intense commentary.",1476921600,,393,4.880597014925373

7638835,4,B01BHTSIOC,"The cast is very good--the younger players are quite attractive, and the older ones fit their parts.  The settings are beautiful.  The costumes ""seem"" right.  Fans of the novel will notice how much the script omits, but why complain about the good just because it isn't perfect?  Will Fellowes follow up with more Trollope?  How the good doctor ends is well worth seeing.",1476921600,,371,4.825396825396825

7638860,4,B01BHTSIOC,"This is very beautiful, but  I believe  there was no such thing as lip filler in 19th century! And the actress, who plays Mary, obviously has it (although she is very pretty). I am very disappointed, that Julian Fellowes, who usually pays so much attention to details, made such a mistake. I think Lily James would've been perfect for this role.",1476748800,,345,4.639344262295082
7638861,5,B01BHTSIOC,"My only complaint is that it didn't go further with their stories.  I originally watched it because I thought it was a series since it ""season 1"".  Thoroughly enjoyed it and will look for more shows just like it.",1476748800,,212,4.410256410256411

What more would you wish for? I also very much enjoyed Mr. Fellowes, who with a wink in his eye and a wisp of irony in his tone, intimately dished on Trollope and his characters.

7639060,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Predictable story, pleasurable watching and perfect presentation in the English estate drama format. Trollope's stories show how badly lorded gentry, especially older women, treat those who cannot enhance their societal standing.  Wealthy men are predictably arrogant and unsympathetic but goodness and generosity wins the day.  Excellent casting and acting close to the superb standard of Downton's cast.",1475539200,,405,6.087719298245614

I think the intro and outro of each episode with Julian is a tad bit unnecessary. I enjoy beginning the next episode without knowing everything in advance. There is enough in each episode where you can figure out how the next one should go, and with enough imagination left to feel the excitement of it all.

The plot was rather simple and some what predictable, the acting was ""ok"" - no BAFTA awards or anything - but enough good things to keep you interested across all four episodes.

While I was not previously familiar with the Trollope novel, and I don't know how faithfully the adaptation reflected it, I thought the characters were fun and engaging, and the plot hung together on its own terms.  And lots of beautiful settings.  I think fans of period drama will enjoy it.",1474502400,,355,4.883333333333334

7639271,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I, like many, am missing Downton Abbey.  One of my fellow Downton-ites turned me on to this series.  While set in the 1850's in England, it still gives us a bit of a taste of what many of us loved about Downton: characters we can identify with, some whom we like, and some we do not, masterful and clever use of the English language at the hand of Julian Fellowes, and having a glimpse of the lush scenery and beautiful estates in the English countryside.  This series was less about the upstairs/downstairs relationships as in D.A.  Rather, Doctor Thorne focused on the class differences between the manor-born and those who engage in an occupation to earn a living outside of Service.  Think Dr. Clarkson on DA, and Lady Violet's classic quip, ""What is a weekend?""  Since Doctor Thorne is referred to here as ""Season 1,"" we can only hope we see more in the future.",1474502400,,866,4.554838709677419

7639278,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Ah, to be able to reduce the Trollope's novel ""Dr. Thorne"" into such a predictable plot. The actors, costumes, scenery were enchanting, but much was lost in the translation. I'm a Trollope fan. I began with ""The Warden,"" which probably wouldn't have so well adapted to the screen as ""Dr. Thorne."" And I continued reading all of The Barchester Novels, as well as other Trollope novels. Yes, Trollope gives depth to his characters in his novels, and this characteristic I found lacking in the film. The doctor himself in the novel is filled with mixed feelings when he finds out that his beloved Mary is likely to be an heiress. But he takes great joy in her good fortune, and not, as much as the film suggests, in giving Tom's mother her comeuppance. I too could have done without Julian Fellows giving the audience ""spoilers"" before an episode played. But still I enjoyed watching the film, but I do think it could have been expanded to show more of Trollope's characterization.",1474416000,,978,4.7251461988304095

7639432,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Doesn't have QUITE the quality - in acting, writing, or production value - of Fellowe's hit ""Downton Abbey"". But then again, it's an adaptation of a charming and sweet, but fairly simple and predictable, Victorian novel, and is only about 3 hours long in total (all four ""episodes""). For what it is, it is as charming as its source material, and the characters, while underdeveloped in many respects, are yet likable and well-portrayed. The actor who plays Frank is perhaps the weakest, but then again he has little to do but be the foil to Sir Louis and the ""ladies"" of the households who oppose the match with Mary. Tom Hollander/Doctor Thorne is, as might be expected, the best actor and character, in such a different role from any I've seen him in before (Going from seeing him in ""The Night Manager"" series to this was... a little jarring.).

Parents, nothing to worry about here, despite the TV-14 rating for ""violence"". The opening scene is a brief moment of violence, but there is nothing else in the rest of the series, and nothing inappropriately sexual at all. This, on the heels of the similarly-safe-for-watching ""Love & Friendship"", is quite a relief to find in this modern age of dark, brutal, oversexualized drama.

Overall, it is about the same level of quality and type of production as that other Amazon-produced recent film, ""Love & Friendship"". Likewise, there are similarities with Fellowe's other show, ""Downton Abbey"". It's really a bit of both, and if Doctor Thorne is really one of Fellowe's favorite books, one can see clearly the influence it had on him in creating ""Downton"" and his other works.

I was at first put off by, but then looking forward to, the introduction and closing of each episode by Mr Fellowes himself, ala Alfred Hitchcock. If they let Mr Fellowes adapt more of his favorite tales in similar fashion in the future (likely, given the response to this...)

7639503,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Julian Fellowes' genius returns!  I love his treatment of Trollope's classic work, Dr. Thorne.  I was easily drawn into the stories of each of the very believable characters. Similar to DA, the storyline is well-paced and satisfying.  Different from DA, however, is it's lighter mood, and most pleasant look.  The scenes are filmed mostly in natural sunlight, during the day, lending a happy tone to the characters while showing off the beautiful English countryside and architecture. (Which, let's face it, the pastoral setting is a large part of the allure and enjoyment of this genre.)  On a technical note, I love how Fellowes' casting continues in the style of DA by including both new and familiar English actors in his productions.  After seeing the actor, Tom Hollander play bafoonish characters in past BBC dramas, it is so satisfying to see him shine in the lead role as the affably honorable Dr Thorne.  It's nice to see a great actor break out of his type-casting and surprise us with the genuine sincerity, humility and kindness he lends to the role. (Very savvy, Mr. Fellowes!)  And just how endearing is it, to be personally and intimately welcomed into each episode by Julian himself, casually sharing his remarks while seated comfortably in front of a warm fireplace?  Imagine my disappointment, however-- I was all set for the other volumes in Trollope's works!  I hope they turn up soon!!",1473724800,9,1407,4.948936170212766

7639577,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Downton Abbey it is not, although the themes are the same. Whereas Downton had numerous memorable scenes that were carefully composed like gorgeous paintings, Doctor Thorne lacked lacked that visual treat. Of course, being so much shorter, Thorne could not develop its characters to the extent that Downton did, and I missed that. But at least most of Thorne's characters were three dimensional. I loved the old man who died! Too bad we could not have seen more of him....",1473552000,,472,4.9125
7639578,5,B01BHTSIOC,I enjoyed season 1 of Doctor Thorne. The narrator was great setting the background of the story.,1473552000,,96,4.705882352941177
7639579,5,B01BHTSIOC,"If you enjoyed Downton Abby, you'll like this. We have only gotten through 2 episodes, but the plot is intriguing and the characters are excellent.",1473552000,,147,4.92
7639580,5,B01BHTSIOC,Another fun series!,1473552000,,19,5.666666666666667
7639581,4,B01BHTSIOC,I enjoyed Doctor Thorne but it is 4 short episodes so it made it impossible to build the characters or allow the viewer to become interested in the characters.,1473552000,,159,4.517241379310345

7639587,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Another outstanding production connected with Sir Julian Fellowes.  Although a costume drama in form, it is redeemed by Fellowes adaption of Trollope's fine novel set in his mythical Barsetshire.  Excellently acted.  Proper cliffhangers in each episode.  Wish he would do more of the series.  Highly recommended.",1473552000,,312,5.695652173913044

7639591,4,B01BHTSIOC,"The scenery and costumes are lovely. The acting is very good. I will watch it alone as my husband found it boring. Not my preferred genre; I prefer light: comedy, science fiction, police sagas, and mysteries.",1473552000,,208,4.805555555555555

7639594,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I know that the characters were meant to be archetypes - but most of the representations were a bit overdone.  Like so much on Acorn, I feel that the series just could not make it to regular broadcast.",1473552000,,201,4.2894736842105265

7639598,5,B01BHTSIOC,An excellent story and a very effective cast make for viewing pleasure.  This isn't one of those darkly-dreary period pieces; there is quite a bit of humor and the characters are reasonably multi-dimensional.  Definitely worth watching.,1473552000,,236,5.527777777777778
7639599,5,B01BHTSIOC,This was a good series.  We enjoyed it. As always amazon has great quality movies.,1473552000,,82,4.466666666666667
7639600,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Never heard of the author, but intrigued with Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park was disappointing, but everything has been good) it was worthy of watching in one sitting!!",1473465600,,167,5.222222222222222

7639603,1,B01BHTSIOC,It was nothing like Downton Abbey and was quite trite and boring.  The end was predictable from the beginning.  Watch something else.,1473465600,,133,5.0
7639604,5,B01BHTSIOC,I am addicted to it!  I love it. Not done yet but so far I'm hooked!,1473465600,,68,3.25

7639607,4,B01BHTSIOC,Decent story but not the brilliance of Downton Abbey. Perhaps having only four parts didn't allow for indepth character and plot development.,1473465600,,141,5.454545454545454

7639615,4,B01BHTSIOC,"In typical Julian Fellowes' style, the characters, settings, and dialogue were superb.  The plot line was a bit predictable.  The Thorne niece (the actress) is enchanting.",1473465600,,171,5.538461538461538

7639617,5,B01BHTSIOC,What a wonderful 4 part series!  Julian Fellowes outdid himself on this!  Just like I didn't want Downton Abbey to end...I didn't want this story to end. I loved how Julian Fellowes introduced each episode...I felt as if he was talking to me personally.,1473465600,,253,4.7272727272727275

7639621,5,B01BHTSIOC,LOVED this. Short and thoroughly enjoyable - only 4 episodes. But exquisitely done - as we have come to expect from Julian Fellowes. There are dozens more Trollope novels available - dare we hope?,1473465600,,196,4.794117647058823
7639622,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I'd say it compares more with the fourth and fifth seasons of Downtown Abbey--which is not a complement. I stopped watching after those seasons. The commentary by Fellowes is somewhat interesting, but mostly unnecessary.",1473465600,,220,5.5
7639623,4,B01BHTSIOC,Tom Hollander was excellent. The series was no Downton Abbey but it made for a great distraction.  I enjoyed the humor and the right people won the day in the end.,1473465600,,163,4.258064516129032
7639624,4,B01BHTSIOC,Cute show. Surprised it ended with only 4 episodes.,1473465600,,51,4.777777777777778

7639646,4,B01BHTSIOC,"With Julian Fellowes involved, how could this miss.  We binged watched all four episodes because it was so enjoyable.  The locations were beautifully filmed and staged, ala Downton Abbey.  The story was a bit predictable but watching it unfold was half the fun.

I might remove 1/4 star because nothing can truly match Downton but that doesn't mean it isn't great in its own way.",1473465600,,290,4.647058823529412

7639665,4,B01BHTSIOC,Julian reminded me of Alfred Hitcock. I enjoyed it and found that time period interesting. I would like to see more like this. Downton Abbey is still my favorite of all times.,1473465600,,175,4.5

7639677,4,B01BHTSIOC,A soothing period romance. Boy those people were so uptight about their station in society and obsessive to an almost obscene degree about marrying for money instead of love. No wonder they were all so miserable.  Just saying.  But The acting was good and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it unfold. Also loved the intro by Julian Fellows. Nice touch and really sets the stage.  A very predictable story but I love a happy ending.,1473379200,,427,4.743243243243243
7639678,5,B01BHTSIOC,Every character (except for the main female protagonist) was very good! I felt like the female protagonist could have been more decisive and strong willed. But that's just a personal opinion.,1473379200,,191,5.193548387096774

7639701,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I was not sure about the introductions by Julian Fellowes to start with but very quickly learned to enjoy them as he provided some valuable context.
The story itself is engaging and illustrates lots of pathos.  There are times we found ourselves wanting a character (particularly the doctor) to say something as we knew the details but the other characters in the scene did not.
We found the episodes engaging and quickly moved on to the next.  By the fourth episode we were desperate to see how the situation would unfold and enjoyed the irony and the way it was illustrated.
A very enjoyable mini series.",1473292800,,606,4.7075471698113205

7639716,5,B01BHTSIOC,I really enjoyed Downton Abbey but going into into this show I was prepared to make no comparison to the two. I wanted to give Doctor Thorne a chance to succeed on its own merritts and not have it limited appeal as only would come from comparing the two. As a piece of storytelling on its own Doctor Thorne succeeds in every fashion. They have wonderful characters a wonderful tale and beautiful costumes and scenery. I really enjoyed the commentary from Julian Fellowes at the start and end of each episode. You really get to know a little back story about the author Anthony Trollope and the wonderful passion he has for English literature. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the wonderful world of English literature during the Victorian era.,1473206400,,754,4.71969696969697

7639731,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Adequate adaptation up until the final episode, which is cheap and cartoonish, and will fill any sensitive viewer with revulsion at its inappropriateness.

7639757,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Julian Fellowes has a well-earned reputation for bringing historical period dramas to the TV screen. The most successful and popular is probably Downton Abbey. Dr. Thorne is a TV adaption of a novel written by the great Victorian writer Anthony Trollope, which is part of Trollopes collection known as the Chronicles of Barsetshire. I must admit that I have not read the original novels of Trollope, but I have seen a number of TV adaptions of his works (notably The Barchester Chronicles, He Knew He Was Right, The Way We Live Now and The Pallisers) and enjoyed them tremendously. I would not say that Julian Fellowes Dr. Thorne is ""up there with the best of them"", although it is worth watching. The acting, sets, countryside, period dress and stately homes, as we would expect, are very well done. But the plot is unfortunately a familiar one in many Victorian dramas. Beautiful heroine is poor and (how shocking!) illegitimate; she is therefore unacceptable in good society. She falls in love with the handsome and eligible son of aristocratic parents, who have no money but are well regarded in high society. Son reciprocates her love but is under terrible pressure to marry a rich American woman that he does not love in order to save the upper-class familys finances (yes, its the usual rich American a.k.a. Downton Abbey). I don't know whether to blame Julian Fellowes or Anthony Trollope, but Season 1 does become too predictable, despite the clever twist at the end, which however is also predictable in its own way, but I won't say more on that, because I don't want to be a spoiler! There is a modest attempt at variation by bringing in a hopeless young alcoholic who is super-rich but hated by all (including himself). Incidentally, there are four episodes but it is not clear if there might be a second Season. I would have given the series four stars on the basis of presentation but I deducted a star for the too-familiar plot. I also felt that the actor playing the son Frank (Harry Richardson) is not cast at all well. He has the looks but no real strength of character.",1473120000,2,2088,4.723287671232876
7639758,4,B01BHTSIOC,The outcome was predictable but nevertheless enjoyable.  Some gaps missing as to how certain people came by their fortunes but I suppose we'll have to read the original.,1473120000,,169,5.035714285714286
7639759,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I love Julian Fellows, but for some reason everytime I watched this series I fell asleep. I guess Downton Abbey has spoiled me to the lavish production expected. A predictable love story but very drawn out.",1473120000,,206,4.75

7639761,3,B01BHTSIOC,This production was entertaining but not up to Jullian Fellowes' typical high standards.  Much of the story-line and dialog seemed rushed and therefor stilted.  I think four episodes was not long enough to develop some fairy sophisticated themes.  But I DID enjoy it anyway.,1473120000,,274,5.181818181818182

7639836,5,B01BHTSIOC,I stayed up late to finish it. I had no idea I would like it so much. I also ended up enjoying Fellowes commentary. I kind of want to read the book now. It really is like a mix of Dickens and Austen.,1472860800,,199,3.6511627906976742

7639855,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Strong and likable protagonists, odious and contemptible antagonists, then add crisp dialogue and beautiful English countryside scenery and the stately homes and you have the recipe for a BBC-style period piece hit.  But frankly I expected this brief adaptation of Dr Thorne to be a weak attempt to appease the Downton Abbey fans having withdrawals from the PBS mainstay.  I was wrong - this was well done and fun.  I thoroughly enjoyed these 4 episodes and even clapped at the conclusion.  Worth the watch for a short summer binge.  The story wrapped up very nicely, but Fellowes leaves us with a tease at the end of a potential 'to be continued' story.  I'd watch a Season 2 if it were created.",1472860800,,696,4.710743801652892

7639863,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I am not a qualified critic of the movie or the period. Nevertheless, I say without hesitation that Dr. Thorn was simply wonderful from first to last.

Meddling mothers, pushing their children to marry into money (for the good of the family). Characters you will love, and those you will love to hate!  The downfall of one empire, and the rising of another......with proper bowing scraping!
The Victorian era was beautifully depicted by the estates and grounds used in the filming.  The costuming was very detailed and appropriate, as were the hairstyles.

7640038,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Good story, well produced.",1472428800,,26,5.75
7640039,5,B01BHTSIOC,"""Doctor Thorne"" set in 1850's England is a very well adapted, produced and entertaining drama. Julian Fellowes shows his masterful art keeping a sensitive and relevant approach to the issues at hand.
The incredible consciousness and sensitivity of Dr Thorne dealing with the many issues coming at him from different avenues show him a master at finely and safely navigating the social vagaries of the period and a very ""conscious"" human being in a world fraught with egocentric manipulating personalities interested only in their own agendas. He is the most genuinely aware person in this drama and it elevates him steps above others in being a mature, realized individual.
Fellowes' ability to adapt and deliver this novel to the screen in such a subtly profound manner (without today's addiction to high adrenaline extroverted action) is a marvel in itself. This is a quietly powerful drama that transcends today's loud action movies and brings to the screen a more gentle and conscious approach needed in the journey to grow as a human being,  in each individual and as a people in any society.",1472428800,,1097,5.027472527472527

7640053,4,B01BHTSIOC,If you like period pieces you will most likely like Doctor Thorme.,1472428800,,66,4.583333333333333
7640054,3,B01BHTSIOC,a little slow..... but pleasant,1472428800,,31,5.4
7640055,5,B01BHTSIOC,"We have only watched a few episodes, but we are hooked.  Again there is a contrast of social classes. The characters are interesting and the setting seems authentic. We are looking forward to the rest of the season.",1472428800,,215,4.657894736842105
7640056,3,B01BHTSIOC,Pretty good for a lazy rainy Sunday afternoon ,1472428800,,46,4.75
7640057,4,B01BHTSIOC,My husband and I enjoyed it. We watch all three episodes back to back on a Sunday afternoon while we had colds. Made the time pass quickly.,1472428800,,139,4.185185185185185
7640058,5,B01BHTSIOC,It was very enjoyable,1472428800,,21,4.5
7640059,2,B01BHTSIOC,This is what you think of when you remember B rate British acting. This is nothing like the cast of Downton. Keep your expectations low.,1472428800,,136,4.48
7640060,5,B01BHTSIOC,I enjoy Julian Fellowes' characters with the many twist and turns. It is enjoyable!!,1472428800,,84,5.071428571428571
7640061,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Quintessential Brit Julian Fellowes begins and ends each episode with a fireside chat in his study discussing this Victorian tale of mystery heiresses, love triangles, and lost fortunes.  It is incidentally and unintentionally funny to the point where I can see a Monty Python skit using the same scenario, but in an obviously less madcap manner. 'Doctor Thorne' is extremely British, and I fully enjoyed it.",1472428800,,408,5.181818181818182
7640062,5,B01BHTSIOC,Great Movie!!  The kind I like to watch get started and can't stop.  Watched all episodes in one night.,1472428800,,103,4.368421052631579

7640065,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Was a great story, and well told my Julian Fellowes. I thought the pre and post episode introduction with Julian himself added a touch of nostalgia for an ""Alfred Hitchcock presents"" kind of event.",1472428800,,197,4.823529411764706

7640068,3,B01BHTSIOC,I need to watch more episodes before rating this story higher. After Downton Abbey the 1st episode was slow. I suspect it will get better as we learn the characters.,1472428800,,165,4.533333333333333

7640072,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Enjoyed it.  Not nearly as engaging as Downton Abbey, but for a short series it was very satisfying.  However, you could guess what the ending was going to be a short way into the first episode.",1472342400,,194,4.361111111111111

7640116,4,B01BHTSIOC,"This was well done. Julian Fellows opens and closes each episode, which for the first one, was nice because he set it up and I learned a bit about the author. After that though, if you are marathoning the series, is not very helpful. Did remind me of when people always did that though, and that was kind of neat...",1472169600,,315,4.266666666666667

I needed to watch something with intelligent dialogue and superb acting, and that is exactly what I found here. A wonderful story with interesting characters that had me mesmerized to point where I had to watch the entire series in one sitting!

7640138,5,B01BHTSIOC,"If you are a fan of Downton Abbey you will enjoy Doctor Thorne. Not as extravagant and witty as Downton, but very enjoyable with sound acting and characters.. I was sad when the four episodes ended and would enjoy watching it again..",1471910400,,233,4.571428571428571

7640150,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Interesting story line, but too many disagreeable people. Hard to like most of them. Too much shallowness and money motivated relationships. Just doesn't make for a pleasant evening of entertainment. Perhaps if there is a season 2, there will be more likeable people besides Mary and Dr Thorne.",1471824000,,294,5.145833333333333

7640165,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Beautifully produced, written, acted, etc.  Not as exciting as Downton was as we watched how unfolding history affected the old social order of things.

The locations are amazing eye candy and the costumes are unusual and fun. Well acted. Nice writing. A tiny bit predictable perhaps, but for me a big improvement from Downton.",1471824000,,253,5.0476190476190474

7640174,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I really enjoyed this series. It is lighthearted with an easy-going plot. If you are in the mood for a pleasant period drama, then this is it. It is rather predictable but it has just enough wit and humor to keep you engaged. The witty comments are subtle but clever. It was a little fast-paced and the jumps in time are somewhat awkward, but that just makes me curious to read the book and explore the depth of the story more. Julian Fellowes reveals spoilers which is a bit odd, but nothing more than what you would discover if you read the episode description. Overall it was entertaining and enjoyable and if you like the Jane Austen movie adaptions, then you will like this.",1471824000,,679,4.483870967741935

7640211,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Not the best of Trollope's work to begin with.  Add to it the ham-size fist of Julian Fellowes, and you get an over-ripe, over-acted (save for the good doctor himself, played by the ever-excellent Tom Hollander) hodgepodge of every Masterpiece Theater trope going all the way back to ""The First Churchills.""  Everything about it feels like a self-conscious parody, with the perpetually snarling and fiendishly-drunk young gun of the manor, Lord Scatcherd, played like nothing so much as Christopher Guest's Nigel Tufnel in period dress--turned up to eleven.",1471651200,,557,5.318181818181818

7640226,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I thought the story went too fast, only about 3 hours in total viewing time, more like an epic movie length rather than the more thorough leisurely pace I expect from a miniseries. There was insufficient time for developing the plot and characters or for the viewer to get involved with them. I've read many Trollope novels, including Dr. Thorne twice, and was interested in watching the whole series, but my wife stopped watching after one episode.  I don't blame her.
Unlike Fellowes, I think Dr. Thorne is one of the weaker of the Chronicles of Barsetshire sextet. I prefer Trollope's storylines involving the workings of the clergy, legal and inheritance procedures, and political maneuvers to the standard romantic story more in the Austen tradition that is the majority of Dr. Thorne. The book was strongest when dealing with the election and electioneering which were shortened in the miniseries and with the Scatcherd inheritance issues. I thought the 1980 Barchester Chronicles miniseries to be superior, but both pale before the thorough 26 part Pallisers miniseries from 1974.
I also found the bright light green grass, Greshambury's hue and overall color and brightness distracting and unreal.",1471564800,,1205,5.17948717948718

He chops up the plot, rearrange the parts, perhaps to fit a filming schedule, and adds things that simply aren't in the novel.  For example, Sir Louis dies from a punctured lung in Fellowes' version whereas he dies from acute alcoholism in the novel.  And much that makes the novel more enjoyable -- the political machinations, the rivalry with Dr. Fillgrave, the horse whipping of Mr. Moffet, etc. are not there.",1471564800,,519,4.875

7640327,5,B01BHTSIOC,"The top review from Design Think is really spot on.  This really is not like Downton Abbey.  There are indiscretions and improprieties but they are handled more in the Jane Austen style - known about or mentioned but not played out for us all to watch.  This is also similar in style to Dickens in that there are twists and turns in the plot.  It is unlike Dickens in that those twists and turns are somewhat predictable. This is also less gruesome than most Dickens movies.  If you like Jane Austen, Dickens, Elizabeth Gaskell, and happy endings you will enjoy Doctor Thorne.

I particularly liked watching Dr. Thorne as he struggled with decisions about what information to reveal to whom and when.  Although Mary and Frank are the spotlight, Dr. Thorne really carries the story line between all the different groups and does so masterfully!!!

Thank you Amazon for producing such a quality program.  I especially loved that there were not bosoms busting out of every dress.  I did not care for the summaries at the beginning and end of each episode, but I do hope you will continue to make more programs like this one.",1471219200,,1121,4.673469387755102
7640328,2,B01BHTSIOC,"I expected to like ""Dr. Thorne"" because I enjoyed the first few seasons of ""Downton Abby"".  Instead, I was sorely disappointed.  Sadly, ""Dr. Thorne"" was slow moving and boring.  There was nothing unique about the plot of Episode One to hold my interest, and there were so many characters that I couldn't keep track of who was who.  I don't plan on watching the other two episodes.",1471219200,,380,4.626865671641791

I am not jaded, and prefer that when I use media to have a little escape, to not escape to somewhere where it holds not hope or goodness! This was a great film, well done, and I LOVED the good guy characters...they did the right things for the right reasons, and got rewarded in the end!

It is well written, well acted, and something one doesn't often notice on television, well shot, all accompanied by a most appropriate score. I hope Amazon and Julian Fellowes find another book to adapt into this style of show. One with an equally satisfying conclusion. In fact, ""satisfied"" is the best way to describe how I felt after this show. So much television leaves a person wanting, empty, even frustrated at time wasted.

Beautifully done, great locations, good actors, and my wife and I do like the slightly quirky conversational moments with Julian Fellowes in his chair by the fire. Please do more collaborations with Julian, and produce more period drama. There is too much smut and violence, and far too much reliance on computer generated ""action"" sequences. What I look for is quality production values, shot at interesting locations, and well scripted human conversations. Show me real humans doing human things, and treat me as the viewer like I have a brain. This is an excellent series.

7640544,5,B01BHTSIOC,A delightful tale set in the middle of the 19th century. A story of the haves and the have nots. A story of love and sacrifice. Beautifully filmed from the back alleys to the opulent mansions. The only problem I had is that the series is too short!,1470787200,,248,4.1875
7640545,5,B01BHTSIOC,Simple but pleasant story -- almost a Hallmark Channel quality.  Acting was terrific; Ian McShane was priceless.  Scenery alone was worth watching the series.,1470787200,,158,5.541666666666667

7640547,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I enjoyed the story, but because it was told in only four segments, the actors, for the most part, were played in a very stereotypical fashion.  The drunk is always so very drunk and swaggery, the bitch is always so very bitchy.  The street the carriage drove down to the doctors house was always the same block of houses.  These things probably can't be helped, but it was so much less than what I expected.  The costuming, however, was superb.",1470787200,,445,4.525

7640683,4,B01BHTSIOC,Enjoyable series.  More predictable than what I was expecting.  It is not the same quality of production that we find in Downtown Abbey.  But much nicer than anything I have found on any of the 275 channels for my satellite service.,1470700800,,232,4.609756097560975

7640692,5,B01BHTSIOC,"A terrific series. To me, much better than Downton Abbey since it is not seeking to be soap opera-ish and is adapted from a fine book by a great author. Julian Fellowes says as much in his introductions. Also, it's family friendly. So many original works by Netflix, HBO and Amazon are pretty rough and needlessly sexualized. This stays true to the source with only a brief fight scene at the beginning. Made me laugh that it got a rating of caution for that.",1470700800,,459,4.476190476190476

7640728,5,B01BHTSIOC,I think I enjoyed Julian Fellows doing the intros for each episode more than anything lol.  I'm sure this is his same team from Dowton and they do a great job with getting everything so right.  The three houses (castles) featured in the series is worth the price of admission.  Loved it. I hope Julian Fellowes takes on a few more books this way.,1470700800,,346,4.375

It is a classic story of a titled gentleman who's father has squandered the family wealth and he knows it is his responsibility to marry an heiress in order to save their home and lands. Unfortunately, he is in love with Dr. Thorne's niece who is penniless and of questionable birth. Of course, there are twists and turns along the way to the happy ending.

7640810,1,B01BHTSIOC,"Very disappointing. The actors did not speak or have the demeanor, protocol or deference appropriate to the context of the mid 1800's. They were all acting ""too modern"" for the time period. Hair styles, particularly the women, and especially Dr. Thorne's niece, and costumes and make up were also out of context. Although the scene was England, not one actor had a British (or even slightly England-ish) accent. It was very off-putting. Everything seemed to be out of sync with the mid 1800's.",1470009600,,493,4.951807228915663

Thoroughly enjoyed how the plot was consistent with the books; actors gelled very well which made the story that much more visually appealing and intellectually captivating! I enjoyed it each time I watched it (I'm up to 5 now!)! Julian's intro and 'extro' were right on point and did not in anyway take away from the screening of this story. His narration actually helped build the anticipation, gave great background on the author, and provided a wonderfully light telling of how this 're-production' came to be.

7640824,5,B01BHTSIOC,"It was fun and engaging in all its details. Julian Fellowes introduces with shades of Alfred Hitchcock like tongue in cheek. The actors were first rate, the script also. As a period piece the details were wonderful and the characters quite engaging with all the panorama of archetypal representation. There was a lot of goodness and relatively amusing and/or pitiable villains. A great yarn for free with my Amazon Prime. I thoroughly enjoyed this.",1469923200,,448,5.0675675675675675

Perhaps the Trollope story needs more tweaking for this time, being a bit predictable. Some very good individual performances, but overall the cast was much too wooden.  I have read that Julian Fellowes was inspired by many of the actors in Downton Abbey and the resulting character development gave life to the story line and sparked individual performances. Perhaps it is the lack of this longer familiarity tempered by the effects of an in demand schedule, or simply the result of adapting a piece from another time that doesn't completely deliver the Julian Fellowes touch we are so spoiled for.  It is pleasant and lovely viewing sans the addictive quality of Downton Abbey.",1469923200,,798,5.068702290076335

Downton Abbey grabbed my attention instantly and never let me go.  This seems so static by comparison.  Perhaps it is because it covers an earlier more socially rigid era.  At this point, I must say I'm disappointed.  Please give me a good reason to go back to it.

I pushed through another show thinking it just needed time to build characters, but the characters just don't have the connection that the cast of Downton had.  There was always that feel-good under current in Downton.  Yes, sisters were snarky at times, bad things happened, but there was always that part that was wonderful, caring, positive and just made you smile.  So far Doctor Thorne seems gloomy and depressing with lots of mean people and bad behaviors - but with no moments that make you smile.",1469750400,,660,4.646551724137931

No fault to Julian Fellowes, more to the author of the original novel- Trollope, but story line is predictable.  Good mini-series to keep you entertained for a few hours.

Frank's mother, Lady Arabella, is determined that he marry wealth to save the family from financial ruin.

With Allister Cooke-like imitation, Julian does a nice job of setting up the stories and teasing them at the conclusion.

7641036,2,B01BHTSIOC,"This adaptation gave me the impression that Trollope was the English equivalent of a romance novelist - the bad ones (Harlequin). I am sure that impression is completely wrong. The series just never delivered what was promised. The characterizations were shallow and dull, the plot was utterly predictable, and some of the portrayals were way too over-the-top (McShane) or kind flat/strange (almost everyone else). The token American's accent was cringeworthy. The JF interviews were downright annoying, mostly absent of historical context or any useful information, opened with strange camera angles (no, I didn't see any nose hair even though that obviously was the intent), and promised so much that was never delivered. The costumes, sets, and scenery were absolutely lovely although the excessive fake hair and hat flowers were kind of distracting.

7641192,5,B01BHTSIOC,"While we 21st Century Americans idealize Victorian England, we can forget how circumscribed and difficult life at that time could be.  Of course, the poor of that period, without any ""social safety net,"" suffered endlessly from poverty, illness, alarmingly high infant and maternal mortality rates, constant crime, and cities awash in filth.  But even the growing middle-class and the nobility, despite their lovely homes and their lovely clothes, found their lives bounded by the strict and intrusive rules of society - including how one would be expected to use one's time, as well as whom one might love and whom one might marry (not always the same person).  Julian Fellowes has a gift for bringing to our attention the real struggles of those who - through the misty lens of time - might otherwise seem to us to have drifted through lives consisting of only charm and elegance.  I also appreciate Baron Fellows' re-introduction of Anthony Trollope to modern readers and viewers.",1469404800,,983,5.049382716049383

It's labeled Season 1 -- here's hoping Season 2 appears on schedule! Even though McShane and his useless son have both departed this earth, there are villainesses enough to keep us happy for another series of episodes in the county. Will we meet the Bishop and more important, the Bishopess? Will our plots move to the Cathedral Close?

7641273,5,B01BHTSIOC,"My husband and I love period pieces, and this is definitely one that ranks up at the top 10 list in our books.  Yes, as with many period pieces, there are some slow spots.  However, those are still important to get those points in for the storyline to flow properly.  We loved that you saw both the good and bad of so many of the characters.  No one was the ""perfect"" good guy, and no one was all evil either.  It gave depth to every character by having this dynamic. In addition, although it is rated 14 and above (which made us nervous that there might be some inappropriate scenes in it), the storyline was so well crafted to let you know about indiscretions in plenty of detail to understand what was happening without having to actually show any sex scenes at all.  That shows great writing skills.  My husband and I would feel very comfortable watching this with our teenage children.  We hope that Amazon creates more period series just like this one.  We also would love to see a sequel to this series that had these same characters in their continued story, even though the next book in the series apparently focuses more on different characters.  Be prepared for a few slow spots, but a great story with a great ending. Well done, Amazon.",1469318400,,1248,4.482300884955753

7641290,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Well, this is no Downton Abbey, but you have to remember that the story is Anthony Trollope's with Julian Fellowes dramatizing the novel for viewing. Any criticisms about the plot and even some of the dialogue would rest with the original. I thought the first episode was a little slow and predictable, but the sharp characterizations, the not-always-expected twists and turns of the plot, and Fellowes' wry sense of humor drew me back to each succeeding episode. I guess you could watch all of the episodes at once, but I chose to make each episode a weekend treat. I added a star for the most enjoyable part of the show, Fellowes' slyly amusing commentaries that introduce and conclude each episode. Julian Fellowes has a perceptive respect for an old-fashioned story brought to life by a talented cast.",1469318400,,805,4.883211678832117

7641435,5,B01BHTSIOC,What a fantastic series! This is nothing like Downton Abbey so there's not as much dreams or back stabbing. This was closer to a Jane Austen book amfd was a deloight to watch!,1469232000,,175,4.333333333333333

7641440,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Dr. Thorne was a great movie series.  I enjoyed it very much!  It got hooked on it when I saw a bit of it on a Canadian TV channel while I was in Canada.  It may be more of a women's movie, than men, because it is a romance, but it has lots of twists and turns.  I highly recommend it!",1469232000,,285,3.622950819672131

7641448,5,B01BHTSIOC,"It is definitely nothing like Downton Abbey, but it was incredibly charming and tasteful.  It is so hard to find a good romance made in this decade without the distraction or encouragement of seduction, or blatantly bearing every detail of sexual intimacy.  However, I know deep intimacy between man and woman does not solely lie in a physical connection. Some of the best and truest connections of life first are built in friendship, humility and honoring one another.  Then, and only then have I been able to give myself over to the deepest love I have ever experienced and it was delightful to see these values recognized, all without making it too heavy. Very enjoyable and I expect by the end you will find yourself admiring Miss Thorne and her many virtues. (I think I've found a new author to look into!)",1469145600,,811,4.697183098591549

7641457,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Jullian Fellowes loves the dramatic and comedic tensions the infamous British class system brings to any story of romance, ambition, greed, etc. and he can't help but make those stories interesting, whether he's writing original material or adapting material, as in the case of Doctor Thorne.  What makes this offering less appealing to me than the spectacularly successful ""Downton Abbey"" is the casting. Along with the alway terrific and appealing Tom Hollander and the always grizzled and commanding Ian McShane you get a number of actors who seem like people who auditioned for Downton and were passed over as ""not quite right.""  Stephanie Martini tries too hard to play the headstrong and forthright Mary Thorne, with a coquettish laughter that borders on the maniacal when flirting with Frank Gresham, the boy she's known since childhood.  The two ostensibly love each other but he's above her station and while he refuses to accept this, she is too level-headed to deny the realities of the world they live in. Unfortunately, she also appears to be too old for him (almost a big sister to his boyish romantic), and consequently their chemistry is less than it needs to be.  And maybe I'm just watching with my own prejudice, but Tom Hollander as her guardian doesn't seem to be all that knocked out by the actress playing the niece he supposedly adores.  Then there are the almost Maggie Smiths and almost Hugh Bonnevilles and the whole thing quickly feels like a road company trying to bring the game of the A team but not quite having the chops or the star power. If you're addicted to British drawing room dramedy, it's okay, but I'll be browsing Netflix and Amazon for something else.",1469145600,2,1695,4.871527777777778

7641462,5,B01BHTSIOC,"The STORY! The beautiful sets, the funny characters (as caricatures!) And the interesting ""once upon a time"" feel to this  perfect and complete 4 part binge-watching delight is for young and old. Remember being read a story when you were a kid? Well, curl up and enjoy some old fashioned story-telling and narration given before and after each part of the story by the inspired creator, Julian Fellowes.  Get lost  in the humorous and complimentary cinematography and the well developed characters as they struggle with love, greed, alcoholism, jealousy, and a plethora of other human emotions all familiar to each one of us today (if we're honest!) An unbridled, unexpected happy ending is your reward, making you believe once more that goodness and love always prevail in the very end.

7641469,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I found Doctor Thorne to be a charming, somewhat predictable -not that predictable is necessarily a bad thing-addition to the pantheon of British historical dramas. Tom Hollander is by far the most chameleon like actor I've seen in a while. I just finished watching him as a thoroughly repulsive toadie in The Night Manager, only to find him completely transformed as the kindly, solid title character. For Austen fans, it's a home run. For others, it's time well spent.",1469059200,,470,4.962025316455696

I liked that because he'll either mention something that I did not catch or give me perspective on the attitudes of the period. The actors presented their characters professionally and gave care to the story. I enjoyed these episodes while running on the treadmill in the morning. I was completely absorbed by the time my 2 minute warm up ended. I recommend this to any Julian Fellowes fan. Just disappointed that it was just 4 episodes.

7641580,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Really enjoyed this, even though there were only four shows.. I hope it comes back for a season 2... If I understood correctly, it's the same castle/grounds/town/etc that was used in downton abbey. Really enjoyed the characters and the story line..It's all about class and how people treated those ""beneath"" them, how the upper class saw themselves as so much better than those below them, but the great thing is, some of the uppity upper class really had to swallow their pride, which was hillarious..Really captures how people manipulated others to get what they wanted.. And also, the show demonstrats how a person's word was good enough, there wasn't the need for all kinds of legal documents/lawyers to prove something, like how it is today.  Please continue with more seasons!",1468800000,,782,5.015384615384615

7641584,5,B01BHTSIOC,My wife watched this 4-part series in two nights and loved it. Julian Fellows adapts a book written by Anthony Trollope (1858) for the modern audience and the result is delightful.

7641695,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Predictable, fun, and frivolous.  I had a smile on my face when it ended and that is a sign of good entertainment.  The mini-series was a more like a longer movie.  Although the film did not dive deeply into emotion and many characters seemed rather one-dimensional- things I usually do NOT like in period dramas or television- it still worked!  While this would not have survived a longer mini-series, for a short series it was intriguing, fun, and satisfying.  Beware that the first episode, like many period dramas, seem to set up the story; it is well worth continuing on to the conclusion.",1468627200,,594,4.728155339805825

7641733,3,B01BHTSIOC,3 stars because of its predictable plot and predictable characters. The Oh So perfect (against odds) heroine seems rather flat after seeing this theme so many times in more fleshed out dramas..the righteous suitor with his meddling mother and aunt etc etc. Somehow I really didn't care whether they ended up together or not. But it is passable escapist fare with luscious settings and the exemplary fashions of the day. Don't get me wrong. I am a major fan of period pieces. This one seemed like a quick fix and just too formulaic for me to add more stars.,1468627200,,556,4.626262626262626

7641745,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Another good run from Julian Fellowes! I'm glad he brought to light an author that I'd never heard of. For those of us who loved Downton Abbey, this was a good, albeit brief (only 4 episodes), return to that era and its societal rules. They hired some very good actors, too. It was great to see Tom Hollander in a very different role from those he played in ""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""John Adams,"" and in Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies. I also thought that Stefanie Martini, a relative newcomer, was great. Lastly, it was great to have Mr. Fellowes himself doing the Alistair Cook thing (Masterpiece Theater), explaining context and such for the audience from his comfy leather chair.",1468627200,,683,4.7478991596638656

7641755,4,B01BHTSIOC,"The series goes through the storyline quickly, somewhat at the expense of character development. As with most British period pieces, the costumes are gorgeous, the scenery is excellent, and the acting superb. Everything happens quite predictably. Not as captivating as Downton Abby, but still a fun program to watch. Good summer fun.",1468627200,,333,5.423076923076923

Julian Fellowes won my heart with Downton Abbey (actually his character in Monarch of the Glen made him a favorite).

I love period dramas, especially Jane Austen. I was concerned that this might be too much like a soap opera (like Season 1 of Downton Abbey--and I ended up really enjoying the full run of Downton Abbey), but it was just the right blend of drama, humor, and witty dialogue. The main characters of Dr. Thorne, Mary, and Frank are very likeable, and the supporting characters are a delightful mix. I watched this with my 16yo daughter, but I felt that some scenes might be too intense for my 12yo daughter or had content that I didn't want to have to explain....not very many, but a few.",1468540800,,752,4.41726618705036

7642019,4,B01BHTSIOC,"This was an entertaining show with a satisfying conclusion. The main characters were charming, and Ian McShane was brilliant.

The story is not especially complex or thought provoking and treads a fine line between drama and light satire.  But, it was refreshing that there were no plot turns added just for the sake of shock or cheap manipulation of the viewer. Being accustomed to ""modern"" story telling,  I kept dreading that something awful would happen to one of the protagonists in order to create drama (Downton Abbey,  Game of Thrones...).

The show concludes with no surprises for the viewer,  yet it leaves one missing the characters when it's all over.",1468540800,,663,4.9818181818181815

7642077,4,B01BHTSIOC,"It has everything a Victorian drama should: romance, scandal, intrigue.

Tom Hollander is excellent as the moral compass, wanting to do right by his niece, Mary, without ruffling too many feathers, except Lady Gresham's. She and her sister-in-law, Countess de Courcy, are typical aristocratic snobs, but are fun to watch. You know pretty early into the series that their machinations will backfire, it is a Victorian romance after all.

I gave the series four stars because I wanted to see Ian McShane more. I haven't read the Barsetshire novels yet (but I want to now!), so I'm not sure if more scenes with Sir Roger were possible, but it would have been nice to see more of the dynamic between Sir Roger and his son to get a better understanding of Louis's awful behavior.",1468540800,,774,4.768656716417911

7642128,4,B01BHTSIOC,"OK, it's not Downton Abbey. And the story ends up winding up a little too pat. And it's sort of predictable what will end up happening from the first episode. But you know, if you like period pieces like this, and like British mini-series, you are sure to watch this one to the end.",1468454400,,282,4.2407407407407405
7642129,4,B01BHTSIOC,It was short and sweet. Too short for my liking but good enough to fill in the void that Downton Abbey left.,1468454400,,108,3.9545454545454546
7642130,5,B01BHTSIOC,I absolutely loved Dr. Thorne. I hope we can expect more of this caliber in the future. A love story with enough intrigue to grip your interest and never let it go.,1468454400,,164,4.15625

7642135,5,B01BHTSIOC,"As a lover of Downton Abbey, this didn't disappoint. The scenery is exquisite and the characters are very interesting and well played by the cast. My husband and I got completely absorbed and loved every minute. Our only complaint is that it didn't go on and on. The story comes to a satisfying conclusion at the end of the four (or was it 5) episodes but you'll find yourself wanting.... Not for a more complete resolution to the story; just more of these characters to whom you grow so attached.",1468454400,,497,4.533333333333333

7642156,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Good fun to watch, lovely period piece, though just a little bit too predictable and ""everyone gets their just desserts."" In that sense, it's a bit like a junior high / sweet valley high kind of story. Everything is wrapped up nice and neatly and happily ever after, so it's a nice easygoing miniseries to watch when you're in the mood for something light and uplifting, but not really that well-suited if you're looking for something with depth or insight. The intro and outro with Julian Fellowes is a bit unnecessary though, I actually wish he'd just let the story unfold without his interjections. And I was very disappointed there wasn't more of Alison Brie, considering how prominently her name was billed. Overall, I enjoyed it, but more Alison Brie please!!",1468454400,,765,4.847328244274809

The accompanying music score adds to the experience.  I think most people who like this genre will enjoy this mini-series. Julian Fellowes' commentary was fun and added character. Given that the storyline stayed in its lane, his commentary neither detracted nor forecasted the plot.",1468454400,,421,5.578125

7642209,2,B01BHTSIOC,I have watched grass grow and be more interesting than this. The plot and characters are one dimensional; it is almost an unfunny parody of a nineteenth century novel.,1468454400,,167,4.793103448275862

This is a wonderful story, with noble characters, full of the power of love... while still commenting on the shallowness of society.  It was also beautifully crafted.  We need more shows like this for our world where love is growing cold and hope is disappearing.  Real life has so much good, and it is nice to see it reflected in a great work of art.

The casting was well-done, though some of acting was a bit melodramatic.  Julian Fellows attention to detail was evident in the script and settings.  The costumes and scenery were lovely, though done with less of a budget than Downton Abbey.  If you like period English dramas, you will enjoy Dr. Thorne.  (I can't imagine where a Season Two would go from here.)",1468195200,,477,4.987341772151899

Doctor Thorne, the character and the series, was just an all-around good time.",1468022400,,355,4.725806451612903

However, I am not in favor of having death-bed conversions to show us that even bad people have good points. No matter that I do believe the statement, the author's use is contrived. That flaw is not the fault of Fellowes. I think he did an outstanding job with the production. I enjoy Fielding and Austin for many of the same reasons: wonderful satire and characters who are not just cardboard. I highly recommend viewing this series.",1468022400,,587,4.88

7642292,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Not great...but not bad.  It's written by Julian Fellowes but it's no Downton Abbey by any means.  The characters aren't as meaty and the story is not as strong.  But, if you love period pieces, it's worth watching.  The story itself involves two lovers, he upper class, she middle class, who fall in love but aren't allowed to marry for various reasons, the primary being money.  The female lead reminded me of a Jane Austin heroin.  She's mature, clever, well spoken, and sarcastically witty at times.  It's good fun all around but, again, if you're expecting something as meaty as Downton Abbey you may be disappointed.  However, if you take it for what it is, a light, sweet, romantic period drama, you'll enjoy the ride.",1467936000,,725,4.744

Still, nothing about it is poorly done, and it was an enjoyable afternoon's viewing.  The thing that irritated me most about this miniseries was the 'presents' format with the host carefully explaining things that are already rather obvious at the beginning and end of each episode.

But it is only season one after all and who could not like the romance and intrigue of a good 19th English novel!",1467849600,,328,4.09375
7642335,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Anthony Trollope, like so many  Victorian novelists, wrote books that may be a little difficult to tackle for some of today's readers who are used to sound bites and tweets.  However,  like Dickens, Trollope's novels are rich in memorable characters, astute psychological insight, and social  commentary.  Trollope's work transfers  beautifully to film and television, (think Barchester Towers and The Pallisers) as long as the adaptations take their time and don't' try to condense the stories and characterizations too much.

Julian Fellowes' adaptation of Dr. Thorne is absolutely spot on to Trollope's intention in writing a gripping, sometimes amusing commentary on the power of money vs. the power of love.  This series offers everything one would hope for:  brilliant acting from British actors that have practically become beloved friends to their American viewers; splendid scenery, gorgeous settings, lush costumes,  all a perfect antidote to the same old same old of most standard TV offerings in the U.S.A.

The cherry on the sundae is the delightful appearance at the beginning of each episode by Julian Fellowes himself, channeling Alistair Cooke, complete with easy chair and fireplace, and doing it splendidly!  Anglophiles, sit up and pay attention!  Dr. Thorne is the answer to your prayers!",1467849600,,1309,5.420792079207921

Characters are interesting and likable and well acted by a fantastic cast. Over all a very well done period piece, enjoyed it thoroughly!! It's such a pleasant alternative to so much of the formulaic, unimaginative, dark crap that celebrates people behaving badly on TV now.

The writing is well done and the story is never allowed to drag.  Although there was only one or two 'big names' in the cast, the remainder were from the stable of actors that we have followed in many other productions.

He left out the great clash between Mary and Lady Arabella, and he chose a beautiful actress to play the plain but witty Miss Dunstable, but why complain when it was so much fun.

7642500,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I liked this mini series. I have never read the book so I don't know how well it followed the original story.  It was a little slow at times but a lot of period pieces can take some time to pull all the story lines together.  Such was the case here.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because of all the hoopla given this Julian Fellows T.V. production after his absolutely stunning Downton Abbey. That was such a hard act to follow. And this wasn't even in the same league. It's like comparing beer to champagne.  If this show hadn't been so over promoted as another Julian Fellows, Downton Abbey like show I would have probably given it 4 stars.",1467590400,,651,4.2682926829268295
7642501,4,B01BHTSIOC,"My main unhappinesses were the headlong pace and several shortcuts required to pack that wonderful book into four short episodes. The second season implied by mentioning a first ought to have gone far to improve on that, given how well was done with too little time. Encouraged by Amazon to compare this offering with similar products, I will mention time squandered on less substance by ""Downtown Abbey"" in recent years. The quality of the production struck me as superb and the casting often inspired -- Scatcherd, Lady Arabella, and Miss Dunstable in particular. Alas, I could never altogether quiet the ghost of Tom Hollander's perfectly splendid Mr. Collins from some years back, but that is surely more my fault than his.",1467590400,,727,5.016528925619835

7642510,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Doctor Thorne was no where near the quality of Downtown Abbey.  It felt forced and overly dramatized.  Clever idea, and if more time were taken to develop character and nuance, could have been entertaining.  The use of Julian to introduce and then cap off each episode indicated to me that they knew it was a flawed execution of a clever idea, and were trying to add another dimension to package it in.  I think the character of Doctor Thorne could be a fun and rich serialized figure, given the right production.",1467590400,,513,4.604395604395604

7642545,2,B01BHTSIOC,"I loved Downton Abby. I read Jane Austen and have seen almost every movie production made of he novels, even the unconventional ones: (see Clueless).
First I'll say what was good: the sets were amazing, the costumes were detailed and beautiful, Ian McShane delightfully chewed up the scenery with his performance!
Now the bad: the other characters were dull, either over the top bad or good, the story was bland and predictable, the acting was so so to incredibly bad (the vicor's beautiful sister sounded as if she was reading the script, badly).
Whoever thought giving Julian Fellowes fireside chats before and after each episode should be shot. I can tell he thinks he's Alistair Cooke, but he reminded me of the Monty Python skit about upper class twits. He disrupted the flow of the story so much!
The character of the American heiress was overdrawn; I imagined her with a John Wayne accent and added 'little lady's or 'pilgram' to the end of her lines, and it improved her immeasurably!
It was a disappointment.",1467504000,6,1017,4.817142857142857

7642566,4,B01BHTSIOC,This is a fun potboiler for an evening. It's based on an Anthony Trollope story. Production values are reminiscent of Downton Abbey but with less resources. The houses look like where the family would have ended up if Robert had lost all of the Downton money.

7642598,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Where do I begin? It could have been so much better.

The soundtrack overwhelms each scene, gratingly informing the viewer when to be happy, suspicious, or sad. Except for a few actors (Hollander being one; he's marvelous and understated), the cast needs lessons on how to NOT chew scenery (that's another way to say overacting). For this,  blame the director. The script was written with stereotypical characters, that at any moment you expect the liquor-soaked villian to growl ""You must pay the rent!"" and the innocent ingenue to sob in response, ""But I can't pay the rent!"" This show is overdone drivel.

The absolutely most annoying aspect of this miniseries is having to endure Julian Fellowes' attempts at channeling Alistair Cooke, the British journalist who eloquently introduced each episode of PBS Masterpiece from 1971 to 1992. Cooke, seated in gentleman's library chair, possessed an eloquence and mastery of voice that engaged, unlike Fellowes, who also sits in a wingback chair, has a voice that repels.",1467417600,,1018,5.157575757575757

7642626,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Why take decent actors and a Trollope novel and weight them down with such a leaden script and awkward direction and editing?  Hardly any of Trollope's satire or the actors' charisma shines through.  I got through the whole thing, but part of that was in hopes that it would get better, which it didn't.  The simple romance that's left is nothing you haven't seen a dozen times, and better done.

Trollope is actually brilliant.  I didn't think his membership of the British literary pantheon was in any doubt. Watch the recent The Way We Live Now adaptation with David Suchet, Shirley Henderson, and Matthew Macfadyen instead of this.",1467331200,,635,4.842592592592593

opinion. For those who do not take the time to read anymore this is an ok adaptation with some changes.
I liked the actress from Inspector Lewis (Rebecca Front DS Innocent) playing the mean Lady Arabella.
She did a very good job and gave me a chance to see her do something quite different from the usual.
The scenery and costumes were great and the acting was good. I just really did not get into it as I did

7642629,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Having enjoyed every delicious moment of DOWNTON ABBEY, I was, foolishly, hoping I could jump back into another Julian Fellowes' masterpiece and thought this might be it. Sadly, this did not immediately engage me. Not remotely. I simply did not care about a single person in it. In truth, I did not get past the first 10 minutes and I will, if I return to it, modify this review accordingly. But in DA, I was immediately drawn into the story and I cared almost instantly about all involved. Mr. Fellowes is obviously brilliant and one does not argue with such brilliance and I should give this series the time it deserves. But in all honesty, it just didn't grab me the way DA did, and I realize, now, that nothing ever will. DA was, at least in my experience, singularly unique.

7642643,3,B01BHTSIOC,"The story line is pretty predictable and the production is rather crude compared to Downton Abbey. Some of the acting leaves much to be desired as well, although Ian McShane is always worth watching. The saving grace is watching Julian Fellowes give his little summaries and it helps that the actress that plays Mary Thorne is smoking hot.",1467331200,,339,4.862068965517241

7642695,3,B01BHTSIOC,A program adapting someone like Trollope into a few episodes is more tolerable & to the clichd point more quickly vs. the tonnage of the leviathan DOWNTON. BUT I almost rated it a 2 because of Fellowes playing the obnoxious village explainer at the fireside. I know Allistair Cooke and Julian is no Allistair Cooke. Please stay in the background. Our whole family is laughing at you and playing the old SNL skit of Brian Fellows on YouTube.,1467244800,,440,4.653846153846154

7642724,4,B01BHTSIOC,"This is a really fine series, well written, well cast, well acted and well photographed during one summer.  Sound quality is excellent and if you start early enough you can watch all four episodes in one evening.  The only drawback is that Julian Fellowes speaks on camera at the beginning and end of each episode, and he is, well, boring.  Just fast forward the first 60 seconds or so and watch the drama unfold.",1467158400,,413,4.554054054054054

Though Dr. Thorne, his daughter, the man she loves and his mother are fully realized and quite wonderfully performed, the secondary characters are thin cartoons. It is a story of true love pitted against requirements class, family and honor. A good time if you're looking for something light and fluffy to watch.",1467072000,,484,4.987654320987654

Beautifully filmed, with the same gorgeous landscapes and settings we are familiar with from Downton Abbey. I was anxious to get on to the action, so Fellowes' Hitchcock-like intros and epilogues made me antsy, but still they were enjoyable to watch. The acting was very good, for the most part, although the casting was not quite on the same level as Downton.

7642921,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Ok. The openings and closing by Julian (who more than a little resembles and talks like Alfred Hitchcock) should have been edited out.  Yikes.

The series - which all over indicated three parts but is actually four - was mildly entertaining but in no way comparable to Downton. A few borrowed characters, like the unlikable Countess, were actually a part of the Downton cast too (equally unlikable there!).  A couple of the storylines went nowhere and the last episode wrapped with all the action super quickly and the ending was predictable from the moment you knew the contents of the will.  I mean, no surprise there at all.

Not bad, not great. Rainy Saturday entertainment.",1467072000,,678,4.860869565217391

7642956,4,B01BHTSIOC,I know in that time period marrying for money was done quite often to maintain standards of living but it nevertheless always bothers me.  I just don't get how people can do that but there is a lot of things people do now that I don't understand. From the first episode it was a bit predictable.

Fellows did the best he could with a rather predictable tale told in a seriously limited time frame. Good for a binge watch one night , but don't expect too much.",1466899200,,301,4.8076923076923075

7643183,5,B01BHTSIOC,"For those who miss Downton, and love the Jane Austen type, this was a nice series. It was a little slow in developing in a couple of places, and is a bit predictable, but it is an enjoyable four hours of TV.  Tom Hollander is a veteran of Pride and Prejuice but plays a much better character in Dr Thorne than the ridiculous Mr. Collins. He is fun to watch. Good summer viewing. I hope Julian Fellowes makes more adaptations like this.

I am always drawn to Fellowes work. I first saw him as the quirky neighbor in Monarch of the Glen, which is a must watch. Then read several of this works of fiction, finally to be enraptured by all that was Downton. He is a brilliant producer, writer, and actor. In the style of Alfred Hitchcock, Fellowes introduces each episode and does a brief wrap up at the end. These make the viewer feel more involved. Thanks for another delightful venue.",1466899200,,882,4.404907975460123

7643190,2,B01BHTSIOC,Beautiful scenery and stately homes alone do not a good screen version of Doctor Thorne make.  I found this to be a Cliff Note's version of this complex and powerful work by Trollope.  My advice to Mr. Fellowes is to not rush it and cast with the care and patience you did with Downtown Abbey.,1466899200,,293,4.3090909090909095

7643194,5,B01BHTSIOC,"No expense was sparred on location settings of three great mansions involved in the telling of this Trollope novel adaptation.  Production values were high, just as I expected.  Characters were well-written, you knew who to like and root for, who to dislike and who you wished would die a sudden death! We especially enjoyed listening to Julian Fellowes ""bookend"" each episode a la Alastair Cooke from old Masterpiece Theatre days.
Very enjoyable viewing; predictable but very satisfying happy ending.",1466899200,,501,5.329113924050633

7643197,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Nothing too deep, very light series. It doesn't have a lot of drama like Downton Abbey, but it's good for a mini series. Sort of like a chick flick of Period dramas. Everything ends happily and falls into place. I was surprised to see Alison Brie from Community in it. I never expected to see her in this genre.

7643203,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Doctor Thorne is very well done and a quick, easy escape.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the plot is very predictable from the beginning. With that being said, it is still an enjoyable watch and the good guys come out on top.  Doctor Thorne won't challenge you much, but it is a nice diversion and a sweet story.",1466899200,,331,4.15625

That said, such a depiction includes a great deal of over drinking and also the diminution of the role of women.  While this may be historically accurate, I am watching for entertainment and I feel like there is just too much depressing ""stuff"" going on.  There are fine, upstanding characters to be sure, and I will watch the entire series, but the disgusting characters are given a bit too much importance.",1466899200,,540,4.78494623655914

Obviously might have been titled Two Dr. Thornes.  Alison Brie, thmbs up, and I wish Fellowes, if Trollope had not done so, wrote/writes a longer book that would provide both these characters and the actors the opportunity to develop a relationship we all might envy, and if so it would be the solid, more mature, less silly infatuation of the young.",1466899200,,618,4.6422018348623855

It is set in a time period that is very interesting to me. You can see the disparities between what the rich expect for their lifestyles and how the not so wealthy live. It seems the less moneyed ones have a much better life. I hope there is a second season as I fully enjoyed this one.,1466812800,,458,4.043956043956044

I like that it was to the point(s), had great period costumes and fantasic scenery. The characters and storyline were a tad predictable, but I think that the actors did a fine job.

7643410,1,B01BHTSIOC,"Very disappointed.  I loved absolutely everything about Downton Abbey, but sadly, this production didn't come close to it.  I felt the acting was wooden.  I felt that most of those who were cast into the roles of these characters did not come across well- for it seemed that the actors were out of touch with the characters they were playing- i.e., with those who were living in the Victorian age.  I wanted so much to be drawn into the story, but as I watched, I felt that I was simply watching actors on a stage who were  ""play acting"" and therefore not believable.  I needed to feel some measure of sympathy and/or empathy for the character-  to finding myself truly caring about his/her personal life and situation.  These, I believe are absolute essentials to any successful theater experience (whether it be a stage production, viewed at the cinema, or watched on television!)
Perhaps others will disagree with my assessment... but since you asked my opinion... well, there it is.",1466812800,,986,4.792899408284024

(Well and maybe all the mass of flowers in the hair and on the clothing of so many of the women!) To be fair, it was written and set in Victorian times when readers were much more gullible.

7643691,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Underacted and lacking. While Downton Abbey could be just as dramatic, it was well acted and carried as a story thanks to its cast.

7643781,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Liked it so much, I listened to the audio book on Audible.  As in any movie adaptation, a lot of detail has been left out of the story and a few minor  changes have been made.  I normally don't like changes to the story when the movie is made, but in this case I approve as I feel it made the story a warmer.",1466726400,,308,3.78125

7643783,4,B01BHTSIOC,"In my humble opinion, this is a well done Anthony Trollope adaptation.  It was entertaining, beautifully filmed and the acting was superb.  1 star is subtracted however, because Julian Fellowes needs to get over himself!  Ian McShane or Tom Hollander would have better served as presenter.  (They are such gifted actors and really hot at the moment: Ian McShane in GOT, Tom Hollander in The Night Manager... amazing!)  After the first episode, I simply fast forwarded through the introduction and debrief.  Honestly, does Julian Fellowes assume American audiences need to be spoon-fed information about classic literature or 19th-c. societal structures?  Those who appreciate British drama don't need the lecture.  I hope this format is not a new trend from Masterpiece.  Having grown up with the series, I never felt that the former introductory commentaries were debased, or as self-involved.

7643786,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Absolutely loved Downton Abbey .... so it's no surprise that I would also love Doctor Thorne and no one does these period pieces like the English.
Since the hard news of the world is so depressing, it's just a pleasant experience to watch a beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted drama that has a happy ending.  Can hardly wait for Julian Fellowes next presentation.",1466726400,,368,4.841269841269841

7643788,4,B01BHTSIOC,"A stylistic masterwork from the master of period drama.  Very true to the time period.  The cinematography is stunning, with scenes that mirror paintings of the time period.  I deducted a star only because Trollope's story, contrary to Mr Fellowes' great intro and closing comments on the film, is too predictable for my tastes.",1466640000,,328,5.037037037037037

I binged them all in one night because I couldn't stop watching and will watch the episodes again, probably in another binge.  The little bookend appearances of Mr. Fellowes before and after the episodes was a treat, as if the ghost of Alistair Cooke of the older Masterpiece Theatre had influence.  A delight.

Young romance involving money/status vs love never gets old. Tragedy, redemption and a bit of scheming are hallmarks of the genre, but the show manages to spread the redemption around so you really find it hard to dislike anyone.",1466640000,,358,4.885245901639344

I know this was based on a story by Thackeray, so Julian Fellowes was bound by following the plot, but I was saddened that the ending was so blah.

The characters are quite well developed and their behaviors and actions appear consistent with who they are.  The performances are uniformly strong.

Perhaps this is not one of Trollope's best but it is not Julian Fellowes' best either. The costumes and sets are wonderful and what I expect from a good costume drama.

But if you like Downton, especially early seasons, take time to enjoy the beautiful settings. To think that these places might actually exist is intriguing. The sets are truly beautiful and very much what we would believe to be true to the story.
Overall, I enjoyed the series. I enjoyed sneaking away late at night with iPad and earbuds to visit England all on my own.
A very nice interlude to what Fellows fans will follow in the future.

7644048,4,B01BHTSIOC,"As a fan of Anthony Trollope's novels, I was thrilled that Julian Fellowes has brought 'Doctor Thorne' to video life.  I thoroughly enjoyed the four-part Amazon series, which was enhanced by fine acting and attractive settings.  My only reservation:  viewers unfamiliar with the Barsetshire novels may find it difficult to keep some characters and plot lines perfectly straight.",1466553600,,378,5.482758620689655

7644050,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Julian Fellowes, one-time actor, is now best known as the creator of Downton Abbeythe sweeping saga of the noble family Crawley that opens in Edwardian England. Downton fans saddened by the series conclusion in March, can now stream Fellowes newest delight, Doctor Thorne, which debuted on Amazon Prime on May 20.

While Downton was an entirely original work that ran six seasons, Doctor Thorne is a four-part mini adapted from the third novel of Anthony Trollopes beloved Barsetshire Chronicles. Published in 1858, Thorne tells the lovelorn tale of Doctor Thomas Thorne and his orphaned niece Mary.

Virtuoso Tom Hollander (The Night Manager, Rev) is subtle and brilliant as Thorne, while newcomer Stefanie Martini (Endeavor) is at once coy and mocking as Mary. Thorne also stars the excellent Richard McCabe (Wallander) as the bumbling Squire Gresham, Alison Brie (Mad Men) as the daring American heiress Miss Dunstable, Ian McShane (Deadwood) as the drunken rascal Sir Roger Scatcherd, and Phoebe Nicholls (Downton Abbey) as the commanding Countess de Courcy. Personally, I find the acting nimbler and the dialogue tighter in Thorne than in Downton. Perhaps thats thanks to Trollopes text and the shorter running timefour episodes rather than fifty-two.

Still, Downton fans will not be disappointed by Doctor Thorne.",1466553600,,1320,5.367149758454106

Beautiful scenery, costumes, and production value---and Julian Fellowes' approval! Turned out to be an enjoyable few hours, with plots nicely tied up in happy endings.

I found it very predictable in terms of plot and characterization: the teen girls here enjoyed it even more for those same reasons though! And they were delighted to see it all wrapped up neatly in just four episodes. Diehard Downton Abbey fans might find this series too simple and straightforward (and with less engaging characters), but lots of others will really enjoy this light and pretty period piece.",1466553600,,707,5.094827586206897

7644102,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I was unfamiliar with the works of Anthony Trollope when I began watching this production.  I was hooked in the first episode by the costumes and the beautifully shot exteriors which were familiar staples of Downton Abbey.  To be honest, I found the plot to be a bit shop-worn and trite.  The theme of star-crossed lovers kept apart by accident of birth and fortune has been done often and done better.  This is not a criticism of Julian Fellowes's screenplay, however, as it is appears to have been true to Trollope's original novel with one or two minor exceptions.  The main problem is that the plot is rather thin for four one-hour long episodes.  With regards to the cast, I give high marks to Ian McShane.  His performance might have been a bit campy but he appears to have embraced his role with glee and his presence was a high point.  Lord Fellowes's appearance as host of each episode may bring to mind Alistair Cooke's stint with Masterpiece Theatre.  Personally, I found myself recalling SNL's Jon Lovitz as Evelyn Quince in Tales of Ribaldry, an image that I doubt Lord Fellowes intended to project.  Overall, I would recommend this production to fans of Victoriana.  It has motivated me to read Anthony Trollope's novels which I believe may have been at least one of Lord Fellowes's goals in this endeavor.",1466467200,,1320,4.720524017467249

7644151,5,B01BHTSIOC,Everything about this series met my expectations. I was a follower of Downton Abbey & was happy to have another excellent series to follow. Enjoy the intro at the beginning of each episode by Julian Fellows. Reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock's' intro to his television shows years ago.,1466467200,,282,4.895833333333333
7644152,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Anything Julian Fellowes does is fine with me!  This series is a mini-novella -- succinctly wrapped up in four episodes.  It has all the dramatic elements of the period -- class distinctions (the upper class young man who falls in love with a girl;"" beneath his station""), villains (including the wealthy but nasty would-be suitor), posers, the kindly uncle, conflict, vanity (the money-challenged upper-crust looking down on those who control their financial fate), and good-triumphs-over- evil. This is formula drama, but a fun summer ""book"" on video.

 I ignored phone calls and other distractions to watch the entire series in one sitting.  .  Just hope that Juian Fellowes has more in the pipeline.",1466467200,,703,5.176991150442478

7644187,4,B01BHTSIOC,"This was enjoyable, and certainly worth watching for the beautiful scenery, English estates, costumes, and actors. But it is not quite satisfying to those jonesing for a Downton Abbey fix, which is more of what I expected since Julian Fellowes was involved and he presents each installment.  Nonetheless, I might watch it again sometime if I found myself in the mood to binge-watch a period piece type of mini-series.

The actors are all believable and enjoyable. The Doctor Thorne character, played by the same actor who was Mr. Collins in the Keira Knightley version of Pride and Prejudice, is very good.  Whereas I found him so creepily irksome in the P&P role, he is so likeable as Dr. Thorne and manages to convey an entirely different persona.  Since it is just four one-hour episodes, it is easy to finish it on a rainy, lazy afternoon or two evenings.  It is predictable, but an enjoyable movie with a few loose ends in regards to the resolution of some under-developed minor characters.

Recommended to watch if you enjoy the general Jane Austen type of movie.",1466380800,,1069,4.814207650273224

7644243,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I love British period pieces a la Jane Austen.  Doctor Thorne is the perfect fix for a Brit-period-Ro. You know the formula, two exceedingly attractive young people in love, one of whom is wise and witty beyond her years which only enrages the despised but usually socially and financially powerful, wicked mother/aunt/town snob(s) who wants their offspring to ""marry well, marry money"" but whose object of affection is in different social class, thereby unattainable.  Julian Fellowes penned this fun, witty, satirical take on the good girl Becky Thorne, whose birth of questionable origin comes to the fore as she's cruelly frozen out and banned from her friends-since-birth circle of friends, including the handsome and kind son who loves Becky. The mother is scheming to marry him off to an older American.  Mother embodies all that is cruel with the misguided notion that the appropriate and family-name and social status saving marriage is only attained through betrayal, plotting, and ""polite""but cruel social maneuvering.  Don't count Becky Thorne out or underestimate the power of the idealistic, authentic and pining young love to give the town snobs their comeuppance.",1466380800,,1179,5.32258064516129

Her young fellow doesn't come across as such a substantial character, but he waffles in the book too (which I subsequently read in between watching this rendition twice :)  The American is great, and her acting really filled in additional dimension for me when I read the book (in which her character plays an even greater role).  Trollope takes just a bit of license here and there with the storyline; on most points I'd say he improves on Trollope in fact (and I'm a big fan of Trollope).  Wish it had been done as a longer production though, like 2-3 times the length ;)  Well worth watching then reading the book (then watching again!)",1466380800,,793,4.7101449275362315

The costuming was interesting.  There were some pieces I wouldn't be caught dead in, so it would be interesting to research just how accurate the styling was.  As Julian Fellowes said in his opening remarks, it was filmed during one of the most glorious summers England has seen, and there is nothing like the English countryside during a glorious summer!  What splendid scenery! Fortunately, the summer I spent in Wilstone near Tring was just such a summer, and this brought it all back.  Thanks you for a super enjoyable feast that delighted all the senses!  I might forgive you now for taking away Downton Abbey.",1466294400,,831,4.776223776223776

Instead, I found myself being drawn gradually into the story and slowly developing a fondness for the characters.  Perhaps it is because I found the first episode confusing with its plethora of characters and their relationships.  (But maybe I had trouble because I watched it while I was feverish with the flu.)

Dialogue & acting are OK but is missing the intensity & drama of Downton Abbey.",1466294400,,127,4.565217391304348
7644507,4,B01BHTSIOC,"This was too pretty and too well-acted to get anything below four stars, but there were aspects and parts of it that were extremely lacking. The bizarre introduction and conclusion of each video by Julian Fellowes was ridiculously erudite at best, creepy at worst. If you know anything about the period, you will be rolling your eyes at his absurd condescension; if you aren't as familiar with it, you'd have an easier (and less creepy) time of it just heading over to wikipedia and reading up a bit. Secondly, the tone was... confusing. The story itself was rather serious; people's livelihoods and well-being were at stake, and the actors played it very seriously. But the music would suddenly become light and comical at the weirdest moments; it was sort of like listening to the Cranford soundtrack while watching Downton Abbey (a very, very serious show). This ties in with the treatment of one of the young female characters; the way she is tricked and left out in the cold at the very end is apparently supposed to be humorous, yet I felt Fellowes (being the filmmaker) was unnecessarily making fun of this character, who just wanted to secure her own well-being and seemed to form a genuine connection with the person she was interested in (plus the person she was interested in seemed rather sincere and interested in her, too, and so the sudden change he makes -off camera- comes out of nowhere and is just very bizarre). If this entire situation is true to the book, then fine, but film it in a way that makes more sense. If the character is genuinely mercenary and/or a fool, then present her in that way, rather than sympathetic. Lastly, and I suppose this ties in with the previous point, but the length is problematic. Some 19th century novels can be successfully summed up in a single film, but this is very rare. They are massive tomes where each and every scene adds something to the narrative... it's why so many of them are made into mini-series, and it's why this almost always works (Bleak House, Price and Prejudice, and Cranford [though Cranford is an amalgamation of three novels] are the best examples). I felt as if I was just missing something, here and there, from one scene to another... characters seemed to change their minds out of nowhere, and it made the passage of time difficult to keep up with (apparently Frank leaves for Cambridge several times and I believe several months actually pass, maybe even years, but it truly feels like little more than a week passes throughout the entire thing). Okay, despite all those criticisms, like I said, it wasn't painful to watch, and I was totally fine with it. Adaptations of Victorian novels are my favorite, and it's hard to disappoint me TOO much. Fellowes is just lucky his actors were so good. And for gods sake, please Amazon get rid of those creepy fireside chats if you decide to let him make another one!",1466294400,,2893,4.708086785009862

Julian Fellowes adaptation has rendered this wonderful Victorian piece well, with spectacular settings and wonderful costumes, as well as capturing the very essence of Trollope's work.

Fellowes manages to capture his style and the actors do a terrific job of portraying the characters.

7644692,5,B01BHTSIOC,"'Julian Fellowes Presents Doctor Thorne' is a lovely story that centers around the penniless niece of an upright but nevertheless poor country doctor, in 1850s England.  It is a story about love, manipulation, financial woes, the narrow-minded attitudes of high society at the time, lust for fortune and prominence, and other life dramas.

While received during childhood by the influential Gresham family at nearby Greshamsbury Park estate, in adulthood Mary Thorne is shunned by the mistress of the estate because of Marys low standing in society and suspicions in regards to her parentage.  Nevertheless, young Frank Greshams love for Mary remains steadfast, even when Mary herself deems herself unworthy and tries to distance herself.  Despite all the twists and turns in the story, true love wins over, lessons are learned, and the ending is a happy one for all.

The story is rich with colorful characters  some endearing, some amusing, others provoking and unpleasant.  The four-part drama series, season 1, is based on Anthony Trollopes novel Doctor Thorne, scripted for television and hosted by Julian Fellowes.",1466121600,,1120,5.329545454545454
7644693,5,B01BHTSIOC,"If you enjoyed Downton Abbey, then this mini series is a must. I don't want to give too much away but I will say Julian Fellowes is a genius. Okay, yes this is a trip back in time, 1700's if I remember correctly. The well to do British trying to save their status by marrying the daughter to a man of means. It's just never that easy and I found myself sympathetic towards the main character. I love the British but I do have a problem understanding what is being said due to the thick accent. I found watching the series on my Kindle instead of on the television made a big difference. I just loved this series, so do watch it.",1466121600,,628,4.155737704918033

Julian Fellowes' episodic intros and 'debriefings' were unnecessary though he did share interesting facts about Anthony Trollope that few people (Americans) would know. A very enjoyable adaptation of a fine story, set and costumed beautifully, and acted admirably. Too bad Ian McShane's character had to leave us so soon; he was marvelous!

The characters, all well delineated, were played by some of my favorite BBC actors and some new to me, and the locations were beautiful country estates (on the order of Downton Abbey). Although there were several story lines, due to the length of the series (four episodes), none was too intense.

I have never read any of Anthony Trollope's novels or stories, but after watching Dr. Thorne, I think I will.

7644910,1,B01BHTSIOC,"Very poor adaptation of an excellent novel.  Dialogue was choppy; cast inappropriate; the decision to shoot short scenes tumbled together made the story uninteresting;  too many long, long scenes of Thorne walking through a picturesque village, with no apparent reasons.  Overall, a great disappointment;",1466121600,,304,5.863636363636363
7644911,3,B01BHTSIOC,"A little predictable and still entertaining. Julian Fellows and crew have a knack for picking the prettiest places in England for their period pieces. I'm a sucker for period pieces, so the fact that the ending was a bit predictable didn't bother me. I'm ok with just being entertained and this was entertaining. Beautiful scenery and costumes. A look into the peril of women if not cared for by a man and the class system makes me thankful to be alive in this century with all if its faults.",1466121600,,492,4.53932584269663

7644914,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Series great as usual from this creator-- acting, writing,dialogue but Mister Fellows introductory remarks & post commentary are annoying- coy& self-satisfied. I stopped watching- it really spoiled the magic.",1466121600,,208,6.206896551724138

7644916,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I know it's not fair to compare Dr. Thorne to Downton Abby just because it is a Julian Fellowes presentation.  However, that's the main reason I watched it.  It seemed the plot was too contrived and the actors weren't given the chance to develop their characters. Edward Franklin came across as a buffoon instead of being the evil son of an actor of Ian McShane's caliber.  The story was just  too convoluted to present in three short episodes. I felt It was just thrown together to capitalize on Downton's success.  Just my opinion.",1466121600,,533,4.688172043010753

7644930,5,B01BHTSIOC,Very good. I thought I was watching a Masterpiece Theater drama. It ended too quickly and predictable but it was still enjoyable to watch.,1466035200,,138,4.791666666666667

7644937,5,B01BHTSIOC,"What a delightful bit of Victorian fluffprecisely what I needed after a year of politics. Trollope's wit is a bit softened in this adaptation, but it's done masterfully, so that the lesson is presented without preaching. The actors do a superb job all around, because any of the characters could have too easily become caricatures. Instead, love conquers all, and does it delightfully.",1466035200,,385,5.126984126984127

Others who gave it poor reviews pretty much echo my issues with it so I won't repeat them with the exception of the under drawn character complaint because it is the most obvious issue with this series.

In all honesty, the reason for this review was I just wanted to bring the overall rating down so people don't get their hopes up because this may be one of the disappointing series I have ever dedicated any time to.",1466035200,4,704,4.407692307692308

7644964,3,B01BHTSIOC,"While I enjoyed it, it was trite and entirely predictable.  Julian's commentary was entertaining, albeit rather much an advertisement for the show to follow as opposed to an actual preface.  What I realized, and should have after the Downton Abbey series, was that these are relatively inexpensive productions to raise.  All you need are actors, period costumes, and the rental of fancy estates and vehicles.  There's no CGI or exotic stunts or arcane locations (think ""African Queen"" in the actual jungle, or the Bourne Series throughout Europe, Moscow, and the US), and no extremely expensive stars.  ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" presaged this period approach on TV (a technology which has morphed into any streaming, satellite, or cable media), but it took a number of years before it actually took hold.  We're likely to see more of this inexpensive soap-opera-ish type of offering given the demand for content.  Scripps Network, Disney, Netflix, and now Amazon....all chasing inexpensive but attractive content.
In this instance they took 4 episodes to produce a 2 hour made for TV movie.  Entertaining but don't expect much.",1466035200,,1124,5.275280898876405

7645005,5,B01BHTSIOC,"The characters, the setting, the story line - Doctor Thorne is delightful from the start! My only complaint is that the series doesn't have enough episodes!",1466035200,,156,5.038461538461538
7645006,3,B01BHTSIOC,Story very predicable.,1466035200,,22,6.666666666666667

7645011,5,B01BHTSIOC,My husband and I loved it. JF has a way of spinning a tail!  We fell in love with some of the characters and couldn't wait for the next episode. Ancore Ancore!!,1466035200,,160,4.0

7645013,5,B01BHTSIOC,I loved the series.  Nothing like a little historical drama and Romance.  Dr. Thorne reminded me a little of a Dr. Who or two,1466035200,,125,4.166666666666667
7645014,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Eh. Ok, but not even in the same ballpark as Julian's other work. Predictable with limited entertainment value.",1466035200,,111,5.222222222222222
7645015,3,B01BHTSIOC,"As a big fan of Downton Abbey, I was disappointed in Doctor Thorne.  Despite Julian Fellowes introduction to the contrary, the character twists were pretty predictable to me. I have not read the Anthony Trollope novel on which the show was based so I can't say whether the novel has the same problems, but the series was mildly interesting. Historical fiction always holds some interest for me, as there are generally new details of information to be gleaned.",1466035200,,459,4.884615384615385

7645023,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I love this time period but I find the characters and therefore the story to be a bit flat. None stand out to me and ""make me care"" which is at the heart of all good storytelling. Perhaps Mr. Fellow's held my attention so well in Downtown Abbey because there were so many more characters to follow!",1466035200,,298,4.245614035087719

7645034,4,B01BHTSIOC,Pleasant costume drama. Full of pretty people and places. I miss Trollope's customary tone of snark. Completely absent.,1466035200,,119,5.666666666666667
7645035,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Kind of a mess. Feels like a student film. Scenes wander aimlessly and lack any real tension. Direction veers between close-ups that are way too close and wide shots that have no sense of choreography or purpose. A lot of chemistry between the two leads, but the other actors seem to be trying to bring humanity to their characters while the director is screaming, Bigger! Brighter! Bolder! A real disappointment.",1466035200,,413,4.914285714285715

7645044,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Great mini series, I hoping for a longer story.
It transports you to a wonderful era where good manners and etiquette were the norm.
Another wonderful story like only Julian Fellowes knows.

7645069,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Really enjoyed it.  Has a great feel to it and I didn't even mind the commentary from Julian Fellowes before and after each episode.  I loved the actual character of Dr. Thorne and felt he was portrayed beautifully.  All in all, if you like the feel for Jane Austen/Downton Abbey type things, this should be up your alley.",1466035200,,322,4.517241379310345

7645071,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Excellent adaptation, but what would you expect from Julian Fellowes? The characters are rich and even the worst of them elicits sympathy. The show is rather lighthearted and funny, even while you grow ever more invested in the characters. Definitely worth watching.",1466035200,,266,5.357142857142857

7645075,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This is a charming, albeit lightweight, summertime treat without the depth of Jane Austen nor the complexity of Downton Abbey.  The two young star-crossed lovers pictured here are beautiful to look at & their acting renders them sincere.  Of course, they're surrounded by a bevy of bubble-headed twits, scheming old hags & a delightful American heiress who proves invaluable.  If you can't travel to England soon, feast your eyes on the landscapes that inspired hundreds of poets & the castles-to-die for.  As julian Fellowes says in his fascinating commentaries, Anthony Trollope's characters are not quite Dickensian, but if you can't get enough of Victorian dramas, one step above soap operas, this is for you. p.s My husband tried several times to watch it & fell asleep repeatedly.",1466035200,,786,5.165354330708661

Keeping the cast of characters straight is somewhat challenging, as well as understanding the rapid fire British accents. The costumes and sets are beautiful, and the story involving.

7645092,4,B01BHTSIOC,I really enjoyed Doctor Thorne. It is a wonderful story. Thanks to Julian Fellowes for presenting it so soon after Downton Abbey. The casting was great and I liked the happy ending. And it was free on Amazon. (I do have Amazon Prime and Kindle Fire.)

7645107,5,B01BHTSIOC,So glad Julian Fellowes has dug up this saga now that Downton Abbey is over. Dr Thorne is as interesting as the former taking place in Victorian England . There is intertwined some humor as well as the drama. I'm hoping there's more to the four episodes I've seen thus far.,1466035200,,273,4.372549019607843

7645112,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Dr. Thorne has a leisurely Victorian pace & a pleasant collection of characters. None of the characters really seized my attention, although there were several unusual features of the plot which revolved around the illegitimacy of one of the major characters. Julian Fellowes comes out from backstage to comment before & after each episode. I did not fully agree with him that the characters were all more complex than those in Dickens' stories. The climax was very satisfying, and I felt foolish that I had not seen it coming. One quibble with this as with most modern historic productions was the very modern makeup on the women.",1466035200,,631,4.906542056074766

7645130,4,B01BHTSIOC,I thought it was well written and well acted.  As you would expect with Julian Fellowes it was beautifully filmed with great costumes and scenery.  While the ending was very predictable it was very enjoyable to watch.,1465948800,,217,4.837837837837838
7645131,4,B01BHTSIOC,Well acted and looked great.  Loved the beginnings with Julian Fellows.  Story line was very predictable and in some cases a real stretch.,1465948800,,138,4.956521739130435

7645134,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Delightfully done.  The forward and closing by Julian Fellows was reminiscent of the old Masterpiece Theater intros by Alistair Cooke.  It has a predictable happy ending, and while in the Jane Austin era, the language is modern and easily followed.",1465948800,,248,5.175

7645139,3,B01BHTSIOC,Mildly diverting.  Definitely Downton Abby light.  Too much Julian Fellowes.  You don't have to explain everything before and after each episode.  Way too predictable.  Certainly short and sweet.  Characters single dimensional.  Some good visuals.,1465948800,,247,6.088235294117647

7645148,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Personally I thought it was quite good, though a bit too short.  Tom Hollander, who I believe played Dr. Thorne was very good, and Stefanie Maritini is a true beauty - hope to see her in more shows.

Acting was uneven, costumes uneven, setting was beautiful but it seemed clear that they were only shooting in certain rooms of grand houses. Plot was wafer thin and easily discerned.

7645199,3,B01BHTSIOC,"This was fairly good, although it was no ""Downton Abbey""!  It takes place earlier, in the Victorian era, and is a very typical story -- titled nobleman from impoverished family rejects rich American woman who could save his family, in favor of true love with a poor, illegitimate local girl.  Said local girl, who has been raised as ""Dr. Thorne's niece"", is actually the niece of a very wealthy  man (wonderfully played by Ian McShane); and with a few, predictable, twists and turns, true love, great wealth, and happiness all around  end up together in the finale.  It feels like a Masterpiece Theater, and the costumes and scenery are spectacular.  It's a fun, easy, short series to watch; and despite calling it ""Season One"", I highly doubt there is a Season Two.",1465948800,,766,4.765151515151516

7645271,4,B01BHTSIOC,"This is a good and faithful adaptation of a great novel.  If the actors exaggerate character traits somewhat, I find that in keeping with the way they are written in the novel.  In other words, the actors are not trying to, nor should they, give contemporary,modern realistic performances, but rather portray the fictional people as Trollope described them, a bit over-the-top.  I loved the phyiscal authenticity of this period piece, including the men's messy hair and some of the ladies' overly floral hair ornamentation.  However, Frank's hairdo was quite distracting, toupee-like, definitely NOT swoon worthy.  The only other element that distracted from the perfection of presentation of this novel was Julian Fellowes' appearances.  He is no Alistair Cooke, and instead of being capable of drawing American audiences into material they might have regarded as effete, Fellows comes across as exactly the kind of silly British snob we sneer at.",1465948800,,948,5.328859060402684

7645346,3,B01BHTSIOC,"While you'll recognize some actors from other British dramas, including Downton Abbey, this seemingly B-class drama felt rushed and left me wanting. This wasn't the quality we expect from Mr. Fellowes. While keeping close to the story and with witty banter Jilian is known for, it felt too much of a comical stretch. The acting was a bit off, especially when it comes to our villian. We want to love Mary Thorne, but in the end she is quite dull. The best of the series lies in the last 15 minutes. I'm sorry Mr. Fellowes... I'm a huge fan of your work, but I just couldn't hop aboard this train for more than 3 stars.",1465948800,,618,4.3826086956521735

As a Cinderella-Rags-to-Riches story, the characters are well drawn and competently acted. The setting is beautiful, although a little too clean for the period.

7645584,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Fun miniseries, in the vein of recent adaptations of Jane Austen's novels. It reminded me a lot of screen adaptations of Mansfield Park. The same cast of characters you see in many costume dramas - star-crossed lovers, a henpecked husband who gets his quiet comeuppance at the end, shrill judgmental society ladies, giggling debutantes. It's all very predictable, comfortable, and delightful. This one has a slow spot or two, but hang on for the ending, which is comical and jubilant.

The intros by Julian Fellowes were cute and quirky but ultimately didn't add any value or interesting information to the episodes. Think Alan Cummings or Laura Linney introducing the Masterpiece Theater programs. Fine as a buffer between commercials for a TV airing; but not really sure why it's necessary on a Prime show. It's a minor quibble; I think the intro on each episode will probably be annoying with a repeat viewing. Because there WILL be a repeat viewing - it's definitely a keeper.",1465862400,,980,4.975609756097561

The actors are captured better in the series, just like a book cover that one image can determine for some whether to crack the cover. I enjoyed the story very much, I loved (spoiler alert) the happy ending. Loved the cast they all fit the time period and their roles. I think the people of the era reading the story needed these characters to triumph. The costuming and locations were wonderful (done so well they don't pull you out of the story due to the detail as experience in other period productions). A weird thing that I thought ""hmm could have been better"" where were the titles (software choice?) to indicate which estate you were at, I thought it didn't match the production. So happy Julian likes to work.",1465862400,,813,4.5
7645614,5,B01BHTSIOC,I loved this series. Tom Holland was amazing. I loved him as Mr. Collins on the Pride and Prejudice adaptation starring Keira Knightly. I watched the whole series in one night.,1465862400,,176,4.709677419354839

7645621,5,B01BHTSIOC,"The use of beautiful sets and the lighting is enough to make this a series worth watching.  The story line is straightforward, but there is enough suspense to keep your interest. Having Julian give opening and closing remarks for each episode was an extra bonus.  The story is best describe as historical fiction at the close of the Victorian era.",1465862400,,347,4.766666666666667

7645706,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This was somewhat different to Downton Abbey, set some 60 years earlier and adapted from Trollope's book.  The acting was generally good with some established actors and some newcomers.  The sets, lighting and photography were outstanding but the storyline was predictable, as probably was the original book but I have not read it so cannot say.  There was more humour than DA and the music well matched the lighthearted pace.  All in all a very enjoyable production.  It was shown in 4 episodes with introductions and final comments by Julian Fellowes.  For me this added to the enjoyment.",1465862400,,590,4.969387755102041

The movie has the beautiful countryside of England and the lavish mansions for filming. Great acting and story line and I love happy endings. The characters were not as complex as I was expecting from Mr. Fellowes.  I wish Mr. Fellowes would write a series about Downton Abbey's  Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham who was played by Maggie Smith. A story about her youth and growing up would be fabulous.

I don't understand how the man who killed Mary's birth father (her Uncle) could serve ten years in prison and then turn rags-to-riches.

7645828,5,B01BHTSIOC,"If you are a fan of 19th century English literature (I am) and enjoy taking an imaginary journey to a time of non-modern manners and sensibilities (as I do), then this one's for you.  The romantic morality tale fits the 4-episode format nicely.  The characters and locations are full of charm.  I'd seen Tom Hollander (who plays Dr. Thorne) recently as a villainous modern-day international arms dealer in ""The Night Manager"" mini-series, so took pleasure in his acting versatility.  Dr. Thorne is the pivot around which the entire plot of the story turns.  He proves to be a benign, honorable and seemingly unintentional puppet master whose actions and attitudes shape the lives of everyone else.

Julian Fellowes provides wry and affectionate commentary to introduce and close each episode.  That's fun...very reminiscent of the role Alfred Hitchcock played  in his tv series in the 1960s.",1465776000,,891,5.138888888888889

7645858,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Doctor Thorne was light, fun, and entertaining, as well as beautifully acted and shot. Julian Fellowes himself appears at the beginning and end of each episode (which, incidentally, I found rather irksome; I skipped these sections after the first episode), extolling the virtues of the tale and claiming that it belongs in the annals of classic Regency fiction along with such as Jane Austen. However, the premise of the eldest son of a rich family that has squandered their fortune who falls in love with a kind but poor woman is so tired as to be considered a cliche. It was quite clear from the first episode what the resolution would be, and the plot played out exactly as expected. So while I enjoyed this production, I don't believe it compares favorably with the works of a master like Austen, whose complex and engaging plots and characters never get old.",1465776000,,863,4.76

A wonderful job!  Thanks to Fellowes, Amazon and the cast and crew for such a great job.

I look forward to the masterful ways Mr. Fellowes is able to develop each character and allow the audience to feel like they know them, only to find out not everyone is as they appear.

This appears to be an effort well worth the time of all Julian Fellowes fans, both present and future, to bask in British lifestyle during the 19th century.",1465689600,,452,4.512195121951219

It is always a pleasure to watch Tom Hollander and Ian McShane. Rebecca Front found just the rate bit of hatefulness for Lady Arabella Gresham and Stefanie Martini made us fall in love with Mary without turning her into a simpering victim.,1465689600,,370,4.537313432835821

7646156,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Now I am the first to say that the book is better than the film or TV adaptation but this version of Doctor Thorne is just so well done that it's one of my favourite adaptations of a novel.

The settings are exquisite and the characterization just as I pictured in the novel so this ticks all the boxes for me and more. It's nice and compact too without feeling rushed and there is so much detail and charm to this story that it really is a nice one to settle down with on a sunday afternoon.
It's a nice gentle drama with a dark secret at its core and the unravelling of this secret is the crux of the story - there's also some classic comedy moments however regarding how people of the different classes used to act - take note of the boy's mother in the story and how she changes her tune when events change! I did giggle at this. This is just one of the many fine moments which make up this drama.

If you're keen to know where this was filmed, there is a review and map on thebooktrail.com and the villages are just as cute as they look on the TV!

Highly recommended!",1465689600,,1073,4.124401913875598

7646189,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This was so enjoyable.  I was interested because I thought Tom Hollander was great in The Night Manager, and thought it would be neat to see him in a much different role.  He was great as the titular Doctor Thorne and seemed very natural in the role.  Also phenomenal were Harry Richardson (yum!) and Stefanie Martini as the conflicted couple - their longing was palpable and was the lynch pin to maintaining the story's interest.  They are both gorgeous in addition to being obviously talented...I look forward to seeing more of them.
I was concerned that the story may move too slow, as some of this genre do, but with only 4 episodes, things move along swiftly enough to keep the viewer's interest.  While the story was fairly predictable, it was good fun and I was disappointed for it to end.  Another favorite performance that I have to mention is Janine Duvitski as Lady Scatcherd.  I really hope we get to see more of this story, and I thank Julian Fellowes for bringing this author's work to light.",1465603200,,1006,4.617977528089888

7646200,4,B01BHTSIOC,I actually thought this started out slow/ confussing then the story lines and characters fell into place in the second episode. I was surprised the importance of money and marrying for it plays such an important factor guess that's where today's standards come from. This series is similar to Downton Abbey in the same era and produced beautifully with accuracy.,1465603200,,362,5.05

7646284,5,B01BHTSIOC,I admit I'm an unabashed fan of Victorian Era pieces. This is a highly entertaining story with a twist. It made me look up Anthony Trollope who was quite a prolific writer.  I plan to read his Barsetshire series. The story centers around Dr. Thorne who has as his ward a niece of questionable background.

7646314,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I am hard-pressed to evaluate this four-part series.  Julian Fellowes introduces and then ends each episode in very Hitchcockian fashion, even looking and posing much as Hitchcock did.  It is no Downton Abbey and it is very dark but not satisfying.  I found a total disconnect between the story and the music as the music seemed very light and airy at some of the dreariest parts.  I have no ear at all for music so you can imagine that it must have been very apparent- even intrusive- for me to pay attention.  But each episode is only 42 minutes so three hours is not much time to spend if you are a Trollope and/or Fellowes fan.",1465516800,,631,4.405172413793103

7646373,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I always enjoy historical novels and movies.  Characters seemed sketchy, so it has made me want to read the book.  Perhaps it was the fault of my IPad, but much of the movie seemed overly dark.  Dr. Thorne's niece had two gentry men fall in love with her, however, her character is portrayed as so bland As to unlikely to engender such devotion.",1465516800,,345,4.444444444444445

7646385,5,B01BHTSIOC,"No different than any other Jane Austen-esque story, but adorably entertaining. Great characters, amazing costumes, grand estates and country sides to marvel at, including the typical underhanded, back stabbing and secretive efforts to affect each other's lives for personal gain and status. Sincerely wished it lasted longer than just a few episodes.",1465516800,,351,5.769230769230769
7646386,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Look out Downtown Abbey.  Their's a new show on the block.  Looks like Julian Fellows did it again.  An amazing story about rich people, that party every day, drink to much, talk cap about someone when there not their, and have way to much free time.  That's what I have gathered while I'm playing on my tablet while my wife watches it.",1465516800,,336,4.370967741935484

7646388,5,B01BHTSIOC,"We've been spoiled with six amazing seasons of what is arguably the best drama ever to grace the television screen. So, it's probably unfair to even make a comparison.  That said, this is vintage Fellowes: wealthy landed gentry losing control of land and position and needing a wealthy American heiress to secure their place; a seemingly ill-fated love interest;  complicated and interesting characters; breathtaking settings, costumes, sets and props. The added bonus is that we are introduced to an often overlooked 19th century British author, Anthony Trollope AND it's Fellowes himself who gives us the literary critique of Trollope's work in a Hitchcockian way! I found that aspect delightful!

Since there are only four episodes and each are fairly brief, it's possible to binge on the entire season in one evening.

Thanks Amazon and Julian Fellowes for a fun post-Downton evening!",1465516800,,888,5.276595744680851

7646395,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Very well done production of Trollope's story.  Granted, this is no Downton, but well worth the view.  Set in an earlier era with an overriding emphasis on the poor deserving girl who gets happiness in the end.

7646398,3,B01BHTSIOC,Since this was written by Julian Fellowes I really expected a lot more.  The settings were stunning scenes  right out of Victorian England but the story line was really quite trlte.  You could have guessed the ending right after episode two. The acting was mixed with outstanding performances by Tom Hollander and Stefani Martini.  Maybe the next story will be better. I hope.,1465516800,,376,4.920634920634921

7646495,4,B01BHTSIOC,I am enjoying this program. It isn't nearly as good as Downton Abbey but what is. I guess I was expecting more though. It is a light piece and I think Fellowes is enjoying the fun of it. So I am too.,1465430400,,199,3.761904761904762

7646498,4,B01BHTSIOC,"A lovely story and beautifully-film. But the outcome is rather predictable, even from the beginning. Love wins out over money, but ends with both love and money. Tom Holland was fabulous.",1465430400,,187,5.064516129032258
7646499,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Excellent!!  Didn't require Julian Fellowes' explanations at the beginning and end of each episode, but the short series was wonderfully entertaining.",1465430400,,150,6.142857142857143
7646500,4,B01BHTSIOC,Interesting - crazy how those people tried to do trying to preserve status. Where has Stefanie Martini been hiding! She is just delectable.,1465430400,,139,5.086956521739131

7646504,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I haven't read much of Anthony Trollope but I love Jane Austin and everything (so far that I've seen) that Julian Fellowes has done so far. I really enjoyed the depth of he characters and how it wasn't as simple as the good vs bad. I think Fellowes did a wonderful job, and it doesn't hurt that I LOVE Ian McShane, and he plays such a diverse character, as do so many of them. I want to read some of Trollope's work now.",1465430400,,420,4.072289156626506

7646507,3,B01BHTSIOC,Lose the Julian Fellowes introductions and prologues; unnecessary and annoying they are.,1465430400,,88,6.416666666666667
7646508,5,B01BHTSIOC,Loved the story!  Very well done & well written. We loved the British shows!,1465430400,,76,4.428571428571429

7646519,4,B01BHTSIOC,Julian Fellowes talks way too much. It was ok. No shooting or explosions. A complicated plot very like Dickens. Worth seeing.,1465430400,,125,5.0

7646522,5,B01BHTSIOC,Great story! Julian Fellows does it again!  I loved this series in some ways even more than Downton Abby. The characters were more engaging and perhaps in some instances more real in their feelings. I loved Dr. Thorne and I hope Julian Fellows coninues to entertain us with his wonderful scripts and peroid pieces. You can truly lose yourself in this story and forget about all of life's stresses!,1465430400,,397,4.753623188405797
7646523,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Such a wonderful story. I am a great fan of these style movies and shows, but I honestly knew nothing of Doctor Thorne, or that it was originally a book.

It is very reminiscent of Jane Austen style movies like Pride and Prejudice.

I found the acting to be great and the storyline was wonderful. Though there are some predictable aspects to the story, you do have some twists that are harder to see coming. You have superb heroes and excellent villains.

I would recommend this to anyone who likes movies like Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre or those style movies.",1465430400,,564,4.564356435643564

7646541,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Except for the last episode -- it was of course predictable, but that doesn't mean it had to be predictably presented -- this was a very good short series with good acting, decent dialogue, and some of the things which make Trollope as interesting for our times as he was for his. .",1465430400,,282,4.339622641509434

7646571,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Ok, it won't ever be my favorite period drama of all time, but it has a lot of what I like: costumes--check. Grand English houses--check. Familiar faces from some of my favorite period films--check. And I know it is not fashionable to say this, but I really, really appreciate it when you can watch a show and not have crude language or sex scenes. Really. I hope Julian Fellowes keeps producing shows like this.",1465430400,,412,4.581081081081081

7646575,5,B01BHTSIOC,"One of the best Trollope adaptations I have seen. In overall quality - casting, writing, and sense of period - I thought it closest to Wives and Daughters in tone and comic sensibility, though of course Wives and Daughters was written by Elizabeth Gaskell and adapted by Andrew Davies. If you are a fan of Jane Austen or Anthony Trollope, this should be a must see.",1465430400,,365,4.545454545454546

It fits right in with Austin stories, an unfair event and smug upper classes learn a lesson from life.  Enjoy!  Thanks Julian.",1465430400,,270,5.045454545454546

Anthony Trollope is one the of the great English classics, especially on social commentary and social relations between people. Julian Fellowe's did a wonderful job with this dramatization of characters who struggle to be good, with their faults, with one another, with love, with forgiveness, with gaining their livelihood.

7646842,3,B01BHTSIOC,"While this is certainly not another ""Downton Abbey"", it is so much better than most of the network programming.  Did not think introductions by Fellowes each session added much;  perhaps an outline in beginning and a summation in the end would have been sufficient.  Casting was good, pacing a little slow.

How about a series on one of Anne Perry's novels?  She always hits the mark on family, love/hate, life and death, and great mystery plots.  Have read all of her books and have never been disappointed on a great read.  Masterpiece always does a wonderful job on atmosphere and I can just visualize one of her books being presented.

7646862,5,B01BHTSIOC,This was an excellent series.  This was different than the production level of Downton Abbey but the production level was perfect for this story.  What is most exciting was that Julian Fellowes introduced me to a new author whose work is on the level of the other great authors of the time.

7646869,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Based on an novel  Anthony Trollope written in the mid-1850s, this video will appeal to readers of his other works as well as readers who like Jane Austen's works. The story focuses on a young woman born the illegitimate daughter of the local physician's brother, Dr. Thorpe, adopted as his niece. The characters are well-developed and it is enhanced by the period costumes and aristocratic settings are of country houses. It is pleasing overall but  readers should know that although Fellowes is well-known for his ability to dramatize this genre (e.g., Downton Abbey and Gosford Park) this is a predictable rags-to-sudden riches tale in which all the ""evil"" repent their sins and turn out to be ""good"" people in the end.",1465344000,,722,4.958677685950414

7646912,5,B01BHTSIOC,I am anxiously waiting to see the next season.  It was more family friendly.  Not much bad language and a very positive and uplifting story.

7646915,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Julian Fellowes has favored us with his talents once again in this short series. It's not quite as juicy as Downton Abbey simply because there was not enough time to get into the personality of all the main characters. Nevertheless, it's entertaining for those of us that appreciate period drama. The reason for four stars rather than five is because it was just too short.",1465344000,,373,4.753846153846154

7646929,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Really enjoyed this first rate production. Only wish they could have stretched it out to a 6 episode production to more fully develop the characters and storyline of the book.

7646931,4,B01BHTSIOC,This was superb. I really liked that Julian Fellowes gave us added tid bits before and after each episode. It added the finishing touches to a very good mini series That style also reminded me of how the original Upstairs Downstairs many years ago on PBS was narrated.

7646948,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Beautiful photography and settings. I have watched the first two episodes. The story, however, seems tired. ""Mystery"" wealth behind modesty. Tom Hollander is terrific in the title role. I've been a fan of his since the ill-fated ""A Good Year."" Ian McShane delivers a fine performance. Young actors are enthusiastic. I plan to follow the series",1465344000,,343,5.142857142857143

7646957,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Perhaps I was affected by my enjoyment of Downton Abbey, it having been written by Julian Fellowes, also.  I enjoyed the presentation, and it seemed to bring its own originality, but without depth.  Characters didn't seem to be realistically developed to my satisfaction, anyway.  The plot was quite predicable.  Perhaps, there wasn't time for that sort of presentation.  I was warned that it was no Downton Abbey, but I couldn't avoid the comparison.  Perhaps Downton, has become the standard for all such period presentations.  That is good for Downton, not so for those that follow.",1465344000,,585,5.094736842105263

7647136,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I'm a sucker for virtually all English period pieces, whether they be dramas about the English royals, or simply of bygone eras, such as ""Downton Abbey,"" which was also written by Julian Fellowes. Clearly cashing in on his extraordinarily successful version of ""Upstairs/Downstairs,"" Mr. Fellowes not only has turned to a book by the 19th century English writer Anthony Trollope for his source, he also turns himself into a sort of Alistair Cooke, making both pre- and post-episode comments. Unfortunately, in spite of a fairly dependable cast and lovely scenery, all is rather hackneyed and cliche, the entire plot and its denouement clearly seen just about from Scene 1. I don't understand why it's referred to as ""Season One,"" as the story is contained in only 4 episodes. Unless the implication is that Mr. Fellowes will be back with another story based on the works of Anthony Trollope. It was diverting enough, but far from the standard set by so many other similar tales. I think a rerun of ""Downton Abbey"" would be more entertaining.",1465257600,2,1041,4.954285714285715

7647321,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Doctor Thorne is a four-part television miniseries created by Julian Fellowes (he who created the popular Downton Abbey television series and starred as Kilwillie in Monarch of the Glen.). This series from 2016 lovingly dramatizes the novel of the same name by Anthony Trollope. Doctor Thorne is the third novel in Trollopes Chronicles of Barsetshire series.

The Warden (1855)
Barchester Towers (1857)
Doctor Thorne (1858)
Framley Parsonage (1861)
The Small House at Allington (1864)

Most of his novels are available for download free or for a small fee. The novel is available for Kindle:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Thorne/dp/B00846RHIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Thorne</a>. You can read ""Doctor Thorne"" without reading the first two novels.

Anthony Trollope is one of my favorite writers. Trollopes characters are realistic, complex, confused, conflicted, and self-contradictory. Many consider him to be one of the parents of the modern novel.

This mini-series of Doctor Thorne is entirely true to Trollopes novel. I was impressed with the entire production.

The first two novels in the Chronicles of Barsetshire series (The Warden and Barchester Towers) were previously dramatized in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Barchester-Chronicles/dp/B00065GX96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Barchester Chronicles</a>.

7647322,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Love those British time pieces.  The only reason I didn't give this one 5 stars is because Julian Fellowes talked a little too much (for our taste anyway) on presenting and explaining the plot both before and after the program.  After the first episode, we just fast forwarded him.  Otherwise nice story with lovely visuals.",1465257600,,324,4.8545454545454545

7647332,4,B01BHTSIOC,"It took me a while to get on board with Dr. Thorne, but probably somewhere in the middle of episode 1, I was hooked.  It was a little disconcerting that Julian Fellowes introduced, and ended each episode, but perhaps he was following in the steps of Alfred Hitchcock.  In any event, the information about Trollope was interesting, but I didn't think we needed to be told how to view characters, or the story line.  Fellowes is an exceptional writer, so I'll forgive the excess information.  I thoroughly enjoyed all four episodes, and, of course, the happy ending.",1465257600,,564,4.783505154639175

7647334,2,B01BHTSIOC,Julian Fellowes talking was dull and wannabe Hitchcock. The show was not smooth in its transitions fas time passed for the characters. It felt disjointed. Acting itself was good but no stellar performances.,1465257600,,206,5.2727272727272725

7647355,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I loved this. My only complaint is that it went by too fast.  Julian Fellowes presents this drama just as Alistair Cook used to introduce Masterpiece Theatre episodes back in the day, and I loved it. So interesting to hear background information, maybe a little clarification, but mostly just to share in relishing a good story with someone who  appreciates it as much as I do.  I honestly wish I could thank Mr. Fellowes.  This show took me back and warmed my heart.  I wish he knew how much this work is appreciated.  I wish he would do this every week, for the next 20 years.",1465257600,,578,4.40566037735849
7647356,5,B01BHTSIOC,"It was presented similarly to Masterpiece Theatre.  Julian Fellowes sat in a chair to introduce the storyline and the scene was reminiscent of Alistair Cooke, who would recap the previous episode and wonder how the plot lines would converge and what would happen to the characters.  All of the acting was superb, the suspense maintained so there was not one boring moment.  The cinematography was beautiful.  Remember the old Masterpiece Theatre?  So much of those scenes were interior.  It's so nice to see a sort of graceful, beautiful series such as this presented with the grand houses, the beautiful scenery and the historical antiquities so accurately.  Bravo, Bravo, Bravo!!  I hope Julian Fellowes continues to produce excellent series such as these.  They will be most welcome, especially as Downton Abbey has ended.",1465257600,,825,5.1893939393939394

7647398,5,B01BHTSIOC,The only negative I can think of is that it is only four episodes. Past that this series is delightful. With Mr. Fellowes appearing at the opening and closing it reminded me of the way Alfred Hitchcock used to do it. Extremely well done through and through. A must see. So hoping that this series goes on past four episodes.,1465257600,,324,4.416666666666667

7647414,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I found this program truly delightful from the myriad of personality /plot twists in a complex character study.

7647426,4,B01BHTSIOC,"It had some of the Downton Abbey 'feel', but on a different note. Here we have a self-made rich man of the people (Sir Roger Scatcherd) who was an alcoholic and had a spoiled unappreciative son (Sir Louis ) who, for all intents and purposes, was an alcoholic as well. We also have the essentially middle class physician, Dr. Thorne, who took care of the older alcoholic man as well as had a beautiful niece whom the son, Sir Loius, wanted to marry, but she would not agree as she had a love for someone else.  All set in England, of course with some typical scenery as we saw not only in Downton Abbey, but in many of those shows based in 19th century England. Overall, we found ourselves wanting to see more.",1465257600,,709,4.330827067669173

7647440,5,B01BHTSIOC,"A visually stunning version of a classic book. Compared to many other period dramas, this is not a very lengthy piece, but all characters and events are thoroughly explained in as few scenes as possible.  Anthony Trollope is not as well known as he should be as he is one of the greatest writers of his time. Thanks to Mr. Fellowes for giving all of us another classic.",1465257600,,369,4.426470588235294

7647442,3,B01BHTSIOC,Everything was truly exceptional except for the script. The bad guy died with enough white gunk on his face to line both foul lines in a major league park. The other bad guys died or lost everything. The good guys found true love and oodles of British Pounds under every pillow. This was true romance set in a sumptuous setting. There was no room for grey on their colorful palette.,1465257600,,382,4.4714285714285715

It's more like a Jane Austen miniseries, only not quite as well acted. Still, it was a fun little series and a departure from other Amazon originals I've seen.",1465257600,,286,4.627450980392157

7647455,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Good production values and some fine performances but Julian Fellowes seems to feel the need to dumb down Trollope's story, and his own narrative remarks, to an insulting degree. Does he think that's required for American audiences? Interesting to see Tom Hollander in the role of wholesome, wise Dr. Thorne after recently viewing him as brutally violent yet lovelorn gay criminal henchman in the Night Manager.",1465257600,,411,5.242424242424242

The plot of this, however, was so simplistic compared to other shows of this kind that I was quite disappointed.

7647656,3,B01BHTSIOC,"After watching one episode, here's a quick take: a short, miniseries, Downton Abbey-like show, but without the great cast and character development. It's got the production values, costumes, and authenticity you'd expect from a Julian Fellowes production, of course. But the pace seems wrong to me -- too hurried. In the rush to fit the entire plot into a 5- or 6-part miniseries, it doesn't have the time it needs to develop the characters slowly, and let them simmer in our imagination as we proceed. Worth giving it a try, though -- it might ring your chimes.",1465257600,,562,4.804123711340206

The ending was apparent early on in the show and it was disappointing that it was clear.  We saw, we liked ok, (but, not to watch a second time).

It felt very much like Fellowes rushed this production to market simply to fill the void left by Downton. We were always going to be measuring Doctor Thorne against the ridiculous high standards achieved by 'Downton Abbey.' And I suppose we were always going to have the aforementioned withdrawal from such a long running, marvelously produced, written and acted spectacle as 'Downton Abbey.'

I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Hollander and Stefanie Martini and thought they gave truly first rate performances. It will be interesting to follow Ms Martini's career and see what becomes of shiny new RADA alum.",1465257600,,773,5.086614173228346

Fellowes (Monarch of the Glen, A most Mysterious Murder, Downton Abbey, et al) has given us another brilliant drama, this time from the novel by Anthony Trollope.  Stunningly filmed and with first rate acting from a great cast this is a must see!  Not only does Fellowes give us a great screen adaptation but before and after each episode he gives a synopsis and a bit of history from Trollope's time.  His fireside chats reminded me of Alistair Cooke's introductions/follow-ups for the PBS Masterpiece Theatre series many years ago.

For those of us who remember Allistair Cooke as the original host of what was Masterpiece Theatre, Julian Fellowes, the writer of this script and a Trollope enthusiast, does the introductions to the four segments with great charm and wit. I have already watched the entire four episodes three times. There is enough fast-talking smarm for all tastes. Turn on the subtitles. The overarching theme, of course, is GREED, and of course there's plenty of English treacle to send you into sugar shock, if you enjoy that. There's no spoiler alert in this post!

As in Downton Abbey, it was easy to identify with the characters because none were so physically incredibly beautiful and perfect that they seemed much more real, at least to me.

7647892,4,B01BHTSIOC,"If you are in Downton withdrawal and generally like British lit, this is a nice series.",1465257600,,87,4.5
7647893,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Well acted and lovely visuals; this may be a problem of the author, but the program would have been stronger if the outcome had not been so completely telegraphed in the first hour.  A little suspense would have improved the experience.",1465257600,,236,4.7560975609756095
7647894,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Nice story. Entertaining, but somewhat predictable.",1465257600,,51,7.666666666666667
7647895,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Hope to see more of these period films as Downton was and is bright star but has now set.
Loved the Alfred Hitchcock style opening and closing by Fellows. Just Wonderful!!!",1465257600,,172,4.580645161290323
7647896,5,B01BHTSIOC,I was immediately drawn in to this very short series.,1465257600,,53,4.4
7647897,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I really liked it! It had that ""Downton"" feel but was finished in 4 episodes. I hope he does another.",1465257600,,101,4.1
7647898,1,B01BHTSIOC,"After Downton Abbey I was expecting superlative work. This however was shallow and uninteresting, lacking the character development and intriguing dialogue of his other work. I suppose it was a personal indulgence for him in one of his favorite writers, but it did not succeed.",1465257600,,277,5.177777777777778
7647899,3,B01BHTSIOC,Good...but no Downton Abbey.,1465257600,,28,6.25

7647903,5,B01BHTSIOC,Loved it! Julian Fellows' commentary brought depth to the story and presented thought provoking questions about morality and literature. Very well done. I can't wait to see what else gets done.,1465257600,,193,5.258064516129032
7647904,4,B01BHTSIOC,It is a nicely done BUDGET film.  The acting is good.  The sets are minimal.,1465257600,,76,4.0
7647905,5,B01BHTSIOC,Excellent short series. Hoping Julian Fellowes does more like this and Downton Abbey!,1465257600,,85,5.615384615384615

7647910,3,B01BHTSIOC,"There is a lovely story line here, provided by the original author, but this was not the quality that we have come to expect from Julian. It felt to me as if there were gaps in the story and things that should be happening or questions that should be asked that never were. It was good but definitely not great!",1465257600,,311,4.2
7647911,1,B01BHTSIOC,Disappointing in every way And Fellowes' introductions of each episode were condescending in the worst way.,1465257600,,107,5.75

7647914,3,B01BHTSIOC,"A little over sentimental, but very pleasant watching. With a satisfying ending.
Julian Fellowes, however, is an unnecessary addition. Doesn't really add any great insight or background to a nice story...a bit smug. Thank heavens for fast forward",1465257600,,246,5.5
7647915,5,B01BHTSIOC,Very entertaining!,1465257600,,18,8.5
7647916,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Not as good as Downton Abbey, but Fellowes didn't write this story, just adapted it.  I found the plot hard to believe.",1465257600,,119,4.409090909090909

7647920,2,B01BHTSIOC,Oddly disjointed at times. Horrid soundtrack. Over acted . A sad offering after Downton Abbey.,1465257600,,94,5.333333333333333

7647932,5,B01BHTSIOC,Such a great story!,1465257600,,19,4.0
7647933,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Fun drama about social mores in England.  Very Jane Austen like material.  Tom Hollander is so good.  He was in The Night Manager and plays such a different character, that you realize he is a great actor.",1465257600,,205,4.486486486486487

7647939,5,B01BHTSIOC,Very entertaining!,1465257600,,18,8.5
7647940,3,B01BHTSIOC,A bit overdone. Costuming rather cheap looking.,1465257600,,47,5.857142857142857
7647941,2,B01BHTSIOC,This was thin at best and I was completely unimpressed with any of the characters. I did watch the entire thing since it was relatively short but I would not recommend that you waste your time with it.,1465257600,,201,4.315789473684211
7647942,5,B01BHTSIOC,I hated to see the 4th and last episode end!  I hope Fellowes does more of Trollop's novels.,1465257600,,92,4.111111111111111

Delightful....",1465257600,,80,6.2727272727272725
7647957,1,B01BHTSIOC,BORING.  Julian Fellowes should have continued with Downton Abby. This is not even close.,1465257600,,89,5.357142857142857
7647958,5,B01BHTSIOC,Not as good as Downton but yay Julian! We need more of this!!,1465257600,,61,3.769230769230769
7647959,5,B01BHTSIOC,Great!  Going to see it again?,1465257600,,30,4.0
7647960,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Another great presentation by Julian Fellowes. Although the scenery is not that of Downton Abbey, the characters were ones I became totally interested in. I just hope he produces another one for Amazon.com soon.",1465257600,,211,5.235294117647059
7647961,3,B01BHTSIOC,"In my opinion, the actors who portrayed Dr Thorne, Frank and Lady Arabella performed very well, I felt Louis overacted and Mary was on the verge of boring.  Just didn't think this was one of Julian's best work.",1465257600,,210,4.526315789473684

7647968,5,B01BHTSIOC,very entertaining.  Love happy endings.,1465257600,,39,6.8
7647969,3,B01BHTSIOC,The characters were a little dull. Some of the acting were done poorly including Louis's. But I think the worst part was actually the intro and final commentaries: they were just pure insults to my intellectuality. They should have put all those into special features or something.,1465257600,,281,5.0
7647970,4,B01BHTSIOC,"A nice period piece but not nearly as interesting as Downton Abbey. I couldn't connect with the characters.  Worth watching in this ""down"" season on PBS.",1465257600,,153,4.884615384615385

7647974,5,B01BHTSIOC,Loved it.  Did not want it to end.,1465257600,,34,3.25
7647975,5,B01BHTSIOC,"If you like period pieces like Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"", you will love this. It has all the right elements: a young aristocrat about to loose his fortune and family estate, being forced to consider marriage for money, while steadfastly in love with a beautiful young lady considered unsuitable by his parents. However, the secret surrounding her birth, the money and status she is about to inherit, and whether or not the star-crossed lovers will be together in the end, is the real mystery here. Julian Fellows, of Downton Abbey fame, narrates, and the film will transport you to the 1800's where fortune, vanity and position in society rule the day.",1465257600,,662,4.919642857142857
7647976,4,B01BHTSIOC,"A very well done, romantic costume drama with a happy ending. Make no mistake, this is escapist television that will probably appeal to women more than men. Still, being a man I enjoyed it too. A pleasant way to forget the trials and tribulations of real life.",1465257600,,260,4.553191489361702
7647977,5,B01BHTSIOC,The series was entertaining and well-acted. Julian Fellows did a good job adapting Trollope's novel for TV.,1465257600,,107,5.352941176470588

7647988,3,B01BHTSIOC,Roles were played one dimensionally.  Maybe they were written that way.  Downton Abbey was so much more complex.  Tough standard 8 know.,1465171200,,136,5.090909090909091
7647989,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Just what you can expect from Mr. Fellowes,  the story moves quickly and the characters are engrossing. Right up there with Downton Abbey.",1465171200,,138,5.0

7647993,5,B01BHTSIOC,Don't try to compare to Downton Abbey. It is not the same. It is a novel based program with intros by Fellows. It is a well done mini-series.,1465171200,,141,4.071428571428571

7647999,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I didn't know the novel and only vaguely know his work through the television series The Way We Live Now.

7648030,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Okay. Neither of us are fans of the Victorian English Manners genre. Julian Fellowes entertained we who are more likely to watch science fiction and fantasy.

The too brief series was just damned good. Actors were just right. We don't care the ending wasn't a twist.

Sometimes things are just great. That's why I love to skip around genres of movies (husband not so much). Every once in awhile, you find a gem. If you find a pile of stuff, then just stop watching. This one was a gem.",1465171200,,485,4.438202247191011

7648035,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Well acted, beautifully filmed, nice British aristocracy period piece. If you need an echo of Downton Abbey this just may do the trick.

It's a adaptation of a British 1858 novel so to be honest the story isn't as fresh, it seems like, well an old British novel (not nearly as multilevel as current stories, kind of predictable).

Still a very enjoyable watch, well worth your time,... if you're looking for a short British style series with echoes of Downton and Masterpiece theater.",1465171200,,484,4.819277108433735

7648040,5,B01BHTSIOC,Better than Downton Abbey. Trollope's characters are hilarious. The plot is more delicious and dramatic than any Jane Austen. Setting is gorgeous. I liked it so much that began reading Trollope's novels to get back into the world of Dr. Thorne.,1465171200,,244,4.975609756097561

7648072,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I thought this short series was very good.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I felt that some of the actors seemed like they were trying too hard in their acting.  Others were very good, though.  Overall, I really enjoyed it.  I have already recommended it to friends and family.",1465171200,,301,4.418181818181818
7648073,4,B01BHTSIOC,Didn't care for Julian Fellowes narration at the end of every episode.  I liked the narration but maybe as a separate episode at the beginning or end of the season.  Wished there were more than 4 episodes..  Costuming wasn't my favorite.,1465171200,,237,4.7317073170731705

7648077,4,B01BHTSIOC,Glad to see the author Trollope being put to the screen. Thought it was good if not a bit too predictable but the characters were good and the period well represented. It was nice to be able to watch it all together and it didn't drag on and on...,1465171200,,247,4.061224489795919
7648078,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Good story--- I'm not familiar with Trollope and this introduction made me want to learn more. It was fun and very much in keeping with the Downton Abbey vibe Fellowes established, so chances are good that if you liked D.A., you'll like this. With that said, I did accurately predict the ending before the end of the first episode. Also, for fans of Downton, it's just less epic in scope, so the handful of episodes it takes to tell this story may not fully satisfy your appetite. But overall, light and enjoyable.",1465171200,,514,4.5978260869565215
7648079,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Handsomely filmed with solid acting and excellent sets and costumes.  A light and enjoyable little series from an established screenwriter.

7648092,5,B01BHTSIOC,"""Doctor Thorne"" is a charming adaptation of Anthony Trollope's novel as seen through the lens of Julian Fellowes of ""Downton Abbey"" fame.  This Victorian tale has very Austen-esque qualities for those that enjoy these stories.  Since this is a Fellowes joint you're guaranteed splendid costumes and sumptuous, grand English country homes and estates along with nicely honed dialog from the characters.  ""Thorne"" is a romance primarily and revolves around the penniless niece of a country doctor who's the love interest of an equally poor suitor from a once wealthy family.  The one family wants their son to marry money and cruelly discourage Mary Thorne from following through with her engagement to her childhood love.  There are many fine performance including Tom Hollander as the title character, Stefanie Martini as Mary Thorne, Ian McShane as a wealthy baronet, and Alison Brie (who somehow is made to look rather homely here) as a rich American heiress husband hunting abroad.  There's some interesting twists and ultimately a happy ending.  If you like costume dramas and this time period than you'll no doubt enjoy ""Doctor Thorne"" as well.",1465171200,3,1149,5.211956521739131

7648098,3,B01BHTSIOC,I suppose Downton has spoiled me. Thorne is disappointing. The dialogue seems stilted. It doesn't ring true and that could be because the characters are less than compelling. ...and  that may have been helped by a better cast of actors. The costumes and settings and scenery are lovely.,1465171200,,286,4.958333333333333

7648106,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Predictable but beautifully done. The sets, the settings, the manor houses and castles are absolutely fantastic, as are the costumes. Story-wise, it's not Cranford or Dickens or even Downton--it's a little more like Austen. You pretty much know exactly what will happen but the fun is on accompanying the characters on the journey. Ian McShane plays disaster to perfection and Tom Hollander's performance is flawless--as good as he is at playing villains, it's so nice to see him in a likable role again. And the lead couple are ridiculously adorable. Highly enjoyable.",1465171200,,569,5.195652173913044

Those who think themselves wealthier than others end up discovering their need for the one they thought lower than them.  Love wins out in the end.

If accurate, it's amazing how little changed for the British elite between the time this series is set (1830s?) and the first season of ""Downton Abbey"" (about 1900-1910, if I remember correctly).

The characters are complex as are the relationships between the various characters.  It is based upon a book that I will definitely have to read.  While I am not certain, but because it is based upon a book, it will likely end as the events in the book end.  This is unfortunate because I am very much enjoying the characters and story.

7648350,5,B01BHTSIOC,"A lovely light adaptation of a period ""happy ending"" novel.  Trollope's strength (in my opinion) when compared with his contemporaries was in writing well rounded characters in real world situations without going dark like Dickens and many others did.  Julian Fellowes is obviously fond of the novel and the cast does a wonderful job filling out their roles.  Frank and Mary and determined and naive, Lady Arabella is conniving and selfish, etc.  Tom Hollander carries the series magnificently, giving one of his most thoughtful performances of the last decade.  It's not Oscar stuff but he does it tremendously well.  And the English villages, houses, countryside must be mentioned of course, as they provide our setting and do it beautifully.  Please continue to produce series like this Amazon!

tl;dr - If you're a period piece fan, I can't think of a single reason you wouldn't enjoy this.  Happy watching.",1465084800,4,911,5.101351351351352

One tiny thing I'd change up is this: I'm not a fan of Julian Fellowes introducing the episodes with his own thoughts, and not a fan of him giving an overview of each episode at the end. (I think it was a bone thrown at him so he'd get some screen time. I get it and I understand, but that was unnecessary IMHO.

 Knowing she was the heir to another Uncle's fortune & was not dead as the other Uncle thought made it necessary she be told
 Also, her being told this same Uncle was responsible for her father's death was only half the story. What is Dr Thorne thinking? Maybe, he is afraid to lose her as he raised her in place of his poor brother who was killed without marrying the girl's mother who also died.",1465084800,,617,4.176470588235294

There are four episodes and Fellows tells you before the big themes Trollop was writing about.  Then after the 45 minute episode was finished, he summed it up for you, and then thanked you for joining him in his  presentation.

All in all, a wonderful treat.  Since Trollop wrote more than 40 novels, I hope to see more these Trollop/Fellows efforts in the future.",1465084800,,558,4.622448979591836

No one does these better than the British. The story has all the elements to keep you engaged:and  the acting is fine. Only the Brits properly do the British aristocracy. If you like North and South and BBC produced Austen you'll like this. Thanks Amazon - I hope you'll produce the entire story I'd like to see what happens!",1465084800,,503,5.209876543209877
7648515,4,B01BHTSIOC,"""Dr. Thorne"" is light and predictable compared to Fellowes' ""Downton Abbey"" masterwork. But If you are hungry for a romantic costume drama, and you've gobbled up all the offerings out there, Dr. Thorne is a yummy little confection. Part of the appeal is Julian Fellowes' armchair introduction, and ""debriefing"" before and after each episode.

Tom Hollander is wonderful, warm and incredibly appealing as Dr. Thorne. I'm a new fan, and will be binge watching Hollander's numerous movies and tv series.

My only complaints about the production are the incredibly messy and distracting hairdo's and costumes our heroine suffers, and the over-the-top floral headdresses and way-too-bright dresses that stole every scene featuring the female cousins. Darn! Dial it back, pleasssse!",1465084800,,776,5.512605042016807

7648531,4,B01BHTSIOC,Very addictive despite it's formulaic plot--- we watched all four episodes in one night because we wanted to confirm our suspicions on how it would turn out. Tom Hollander was engaging and convincing as Dr. Thorne and their were a number of loathsome personalities to offset his big heartedness and honesty.,1465084800,,307,5.03921568627451

I thought the characters were great and the clothes and setting also fun like Downton Abbey. The only reason I gave it a 4 and not 5 star was because of the ending. I won't share because I don't want to spoil it for others but in my opinion a certain character was too forgiving.",1465084800,,382,4.1066666666666665

Writer Julian Fellowes' Masterpiece talks by the fireplace at the beginning of each episode are entertaining. somewhat soap opera-ish, like Fellowes' Downton Abbey.

7648589,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Produced by Julian Fellowes,  this may not have the opulence of his famed Downton Abbey but it has a charm and sweetness that brings to life Anthony Trollope's great literary work.  I watched the first episode after the kids went to bed,  thinking I'd meter out the episodes nightly.  At 3am, I finished binge watching the whole miniseries and it was worth the lack of sleep.  Tom Hollander was magnificent in his role as the titular Doctor Thorne and the subject of Victorian society and it's focus on marriage and connections were portrayed true to the work it draws it's plot from.

7648660,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Mr Fellowes makes it clear that Anthony Trollope is the author, and that he, Mr Fellowes is merely offering the introduction. As he rightly points out, Anthony Trollope was a prolific and terrific author.  This movie adaption of Dr Thorne is perhaps the best Trollope I have seen on film - which is a shame since there is such a wealth of wonderful material from which to work.
It was an absolute delight to see Ian McShane in his pre-Deadwood days; the only drawback is his very limited screen time.  The rest of the cast seem to appreciate the difference between Trollope and the Austen / Dickens / Thackeray  menagerie that makes one much the same as the next.  All said, this series is off to a great start.",1465084800,,711,4.488372093023256

I'm very pleased that I could watch Doctor Thorne all in one evening. Loved the story and especially the ending.

7648813,4,B01BHTSIOC,"This series is an adaptation of Anthony Trollope's most famous homonym novel. This love story takes place in the 19th century in England with its beautiful countryside and amazing castles and manors. A very proud noble family is highly in debts. The mother is dreaming of her son marrying a  rich heir to save the manor, their standing and probably their honor too.
The Greshambury heir flirts with Mary, the niece of Doctor Thorne. Played by a beautiful Stephanie Martini the young orphan secretly loves the well mannered Frank Gresham too (Harry Richardson). Yet,  never Lady Arabella and her sister would consider such a penniless union between these two lovebirds. You can easily imagine there will be obstacles and sudden developments in the story.
Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park, Downton Abbey) made a faithful and visually beautiful adaptation of the book. Like Trollope he evoked with irony the Victorian era main  problem: the social classes differences. (Let's think of Oscar Wilde with The Importance of Being Ernest). Social origin at the time would determine people's relationship and weddings were consequently a very serious thing for the rich families to reinforce and preserve their place in society and be respected/recognized... However money was stronger than anything : one could be well born with a big castle and a long aristocratic genealogy tree, but one could be excused of not being noble if he/she was full of money (represented by the American heir woman in the series). Thus money made people recognized by/in society.
The endearing characters of this series are of course Mary, Frank and Thorne because they are straight, sincere and honest. They are not as interested in money as the others. Frank would be even ready to work to maintain Mary! In the book main and secondary characters have interesting personality whose characteristics have been very well illustrated in the series. For example, Frank father's is a nice guy, but he is represented as being coward as soon as his wife Lady Arabella is around. Other interesting characters you will see are the De Courcy.
I did not like the Julian Fellowes intervention after each episode. It is as boring as the omniscient book narrator in the book. That being said some ironic comments about the hypocrisy of the Victorian society can be funny and relevant for whom has never heard about Victorian society in England.
In general I think this love story series is a successful adaption of the book. Moreover, the Victorian costumes,the outdoor and indoor  decor not to mention the countryside images, everything is really beautiful
Great if you are a romantic person.",1465084800,2,2648,5.06651376146789

7649162,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Thank you Julian, for giving us ""Downton Abbey connoisseurs"" something else to to sit down at the family table and enjoy.  It appears a famine is in the land. The bleak prospects for a delicious British costume drama that includes both appearance as well as substance is a cuisine that is in high demand but easily passed over for a lascivious, flavorless fare.",1464998400,,361,4.73015873015873

7649166,5,B01BHTSIOC,"If you like Downton Abbey, you will like this. Very smart, and the writing really held my interest. Although Baron Fellowes' opening and closing remarks are a bit tedious, I have to admit I enjoyed the piece more because of them. This was a good time, and I am sorry it was not a longer series.",1464998400,,294,4.267857142857143

7649174,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Admittedly spoiled by ""Downton Abbey"" I found Julian Fellowes's adaptation of Trollope's ""Dr. Thorne"" somewhat lackluster and  hurriedly put together in contrast.  It upsets me to say that because I consider  him a national treasure. But perhaps I am being unfair.

On the positive side I happen to love English literature and admire Britain's very talented actors. So I was happy to watch Tom Hollander, one of my favorites. I had just seen him play a villain in ""The Night Manager"" where he portrayed a cold, heartless bastard very convincingly.  In contrast as Dr. Thorne he was kind and caring, the complete opposite - again his portrayal was very convincing. Why is British acting so doggone fantastic? I am happy to say the actors here did live up to my expectations. Bravo to them!  And the surroundings and costumes were splendid as well.

My sincere apologies to Mr. Fellowes whom ,I confess, I shall not easily forgive for ending ""Downton"" so quickly. I was selfishly hoping they could have gone on at least until WW11. As an octogenarian I keep remembering British courage  in face of extremely difficult odds,
their finest hour as the wonderful Winston Churchill said. How would Downton Abbey have been at that time? So much to work with.

Well I cannot be angry  forever.  After all, Julian Fellowes,  whom I admire, just might have something already cooking!  Hurry up, please. Mr Fellowes. Don't keep us/me waiting. My age, you know.",1464998400,,1448,4.885245901639344
7649175,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I was really excited to see this because it is presented by Julian Fellowes, now that Downton Abbey is over. I was hoping it would last a couple seasons at least, but it was just 4 episodes. There was obviously not enough time to develop characters as they were in Downton, but I still enjoyed it. I love stories set in historical England. Hoping for more!",1464998400,,356,4.409090909090909

7649252,3,B01BHTSIOC,"First let me say, I LOVE ALL things BBC or anything resembling British T.V Series.  I have been a devotee since the late 70's when I first saw ""All Creatures Great and Small.""  Then, I soaked up any and all British series I could find.  Most I liked or loved very much.  And, of course, Downton Abby is right at the top for quality programming.

So, I was most anxious to watch Doctor Thorne.  I fell asleep during the first episode 3-times.  I finally made it all the way, fell asleep through part of episode 2, and was able to watch all of episodes 3-4.  While the settings and costumes were spot on, and the acting was fine, I just couldn't get interested in this show.  I knew in the first 10-minutes exactly how it would end.  And I was right.  When the plot is so transparent you know 'the star-crossed lovers will run into obstacles, never waiver in their feelings, give the other person up in the name of honor, get together in the end' it just doesn't make the show fun to watch.

Lest anyone say ""of course you knew the ending, you read the book"" I had never even heard of this author or book, let alone read it.  I am sure Julian Fellowes was true to the entire story, and that's a shame.  I have no desire to read this book.  Most of the time, a good movie or t.v. show will entice me to read the book it was inspired by.",1464998400,4,1333,4.15234375

7649294,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Julian Fellows is one of the most articulate and witty contemporary writers.  With a nod to the past and its mannerisms, he imbues characters with the full range of emotions that novels of the past endowed to them.  Trollope is a natural choice for him as it combines humor, societal frisson and fluidity of plot.  The only thing that I missed was the ""direct to audience"" voice of Trollope where he would explain or give comment on the norms of the time.  There is not a single author that I would request to do Trollope than Mr. Fellows.  He is why many of us become anglophiles.  By the way, I own every novel of Trollope and suggest that those who love these four episodes indulge in following their original author.",1464998400,,720,4.5

7649452,4,B01BHTSIOC,I always enjoy period pieces and I enjoyed this mini series. If you are a fan of Jane Austin then you will like this. I find it fascinating that the rich look down upon the poor because they have to work for a living. The class system and snobbery is beyond belief.,1464998400,,265,4.115384615384615

7649458,3,B01BHTSIOC,"This is an okay series. It's very predictable. The most interesting character was the old drunk owner of the estate and fortune and he died in season 1. The rest of the characters are dull. And, Julian Fellowes opening and closing commentary is cliche.",1464998400,,252,4.75

7649468,5,B01BHTSIOC,"We have liked Anthony Trollope for a long time and were happy to see Julian Fellowes had written a script based on one of his novels. It is short and sort of hurriedly wraps things up in a tidy bow in the last episode, but it works and was a lot of fun to watch.",1464998400,,262,3.7818181818181817

7649485,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Nothing particularly enchanting here. The resolution of the story is predictably obvious from very early on.
All the pleasant fixings, but not much of the heart.

p.s. Does anybody understand what Julian Fellowes is doing here as the narrator? Was the program too short and they needed extra minutes to fill the hour? I find his commentary useless and excruciatingly dry.",1464998400,,371,5.081967213114754

The scenery was quite beautiful and the various mansions were quite lovely to see. As with Downton Abbey the clothing was of the period and also fun to view. The one American character behaved outside acceptable norms of the time  but since she was filthy rich she was excused as just being an ""American"" which seemed to excuse any bad behavior.

7649596,1,B01BHTSIOC,"Although from a source novel, the predictable story line would not have been so, I guess, boring, had some (not all) of the acting not been so flat and some (not all) of the art direction so off the mark. Mr. Fellowes made it a point to call out the modernity of the multi-faceted characters from the book, but I found some of the acting to be one dimensional. And I was extremely distracted by the costume, makeup and hair design. Many of the women's costumes were in garish colors not of the period, and in some textiles I'm familiar with in fabric stores today (for example, the vicar's sister was in an ombred silk available at my local yardage store). The women's hair accessories were puzzling--faux flowers in so many colors / types along with trailing ribbons that their heads looked like tacky centerpieces--and everytime someone was wearing one on screen, I kept wondering if this was period correct, who thought this looked good, why did they use so many flower variety on one person, etc. that I'd stop listening to the dialogue. The married women's gowns were generally in more tasteful palettes, although again, the quality of the fabric was lacking, or did not translate well on screen. Also, every woman except Mary was over accessorized - hair flowers in multiple types and colors, hair ribbons, earrings, necklaces, lace and bows at the neck and bustline, brooches, shawls, gloves. It's like they were trying to create opulence on a budget, so they threw in everything but the kitchen sink to demonstrate wealth, with no thought of harmony, balance, the personality of each character, or luxuriousness of materials that would read well on screen. It just hit me what the women looked like, collectively, to me: a Disney production with the cartoonist changing colors and shape of the same features on each character to (weakly) create distinction. I will say some of Mary's dresses were sweet and appropriately simple for her ""station"" in life. For the most part the men's costumes were well done, in rich muted colors and fabrics for some of the waistcoats and cravats ... save for the footman's Kermit the Frog green uniform, which was jarring to say the least. I thought the interiors were beautiful and well lit, although the Greshman's foyer seemed more Italianate with its cold, rosey-hued marble, so I kept thinking it was filmed outside of England or on a stage set. I likeed Dr. Thorne's offices and home, with the dark interiors and crackling fireplace - seemed appropriate for the town medic. However, a few of the outdoor scenes seemed oddly lit, like I was watching a digitally recorded soap opera, and the overall mood of some of those scenes clashed greatly with the nicely done interior scenes. I would say take a pass on this series and keep searching for a more nuanced (on all fronts) period production.",1464912000,6,2840,4.809815950920245

7649603,2,B01BHTSIOC,"this is certainly no ""downton abbey"".  i've not read the book from which it is adapted, but if it lives up to the introductions and end commentary fellowes provides in each episode (ala ""masterpiece theater"") this series needed to be at least twice as long as it is.  the redemption of the villains comes as a sentence or two on a deathbed and in no way shows trollope (author of the book) as a deep student of character motivations or as having any interest in providing more than two dimensions for his characters, and those two dimensions are layed on as broadly as possible. why only 4 episodes?  there is very little treatment of any backstory aside from this happened, then this happened...no exploration of how events affected anyone and so very little sympathy engendered for any of the characters.  and they are, except the title character and the star crossed lovers, all reprehensible in one way or another.

i was so disappointed in the story itself that i'm not going into too much detail on the production which, while handsome, also seemed hollow. aside from dr. thorne, i've seen better acting in high school plays. even ian mcshane, whom i've always loved, is hamming it up like an easter dinner. it is as if everyone involved had to lay the archetypes (drunk, snooty, angelic, befuddled) on so thickly so the audience would ""get it"" immediately as there was not going to be time to develop these characters naturally.

7649658,5,B01BHTSIOC,A charming film that doesn't venture too far into the realm of soap opera. Enjoyable from start to finish.,1464825600,,106,4.631578947368421
7649659,4,B01BHTSIOC,Didn't realize it was a miniseries. Will there be more? I can't wait to read and/or watch more stories by this relatively unknown to America British author.,1464825600,,156,4.814814814814815
7649660,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I'm not often moved to write reviews, but in this situation I have to comment.  This mini-series was enjoyable to watch.  It was adeptly paced, though predictable.  Fluff entertainment for what its worth.  The thing that killed it for me was Mr. Fellowes' introduction and (especially) deconstruction of each episode.  I understand (because of the overly lengthy prologue) that Mr. Fellowes is enamored of the books, but any intelligent viewer would have taken Mr. Fellows' comments as a form of self-gratification the like of which I haven't seen since English lit. 101.  This mini-series would have stood better alone than with the blathering of Julian Fellowes before and after.",1464825600,,681,5.201834862385321

7649664,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Finally! I have been wanting to watch a new Victorian Era film with my 13 year old daughter and I felt that this one was age-appropriate! This was the best film since the BBC put out the most recent Emma, Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice!! I personally was so relieved that there was no homosexuality, and that the most the main characters did was kiss and it was cut within a short amount of time. I didn't have to squirm in my seat, knowing my daughter was watching too. Thank you Julianne Fellows for keeping this one clean and respectable. I LOVED it! Keep them coming!!",1464825600,,587,4.444444444444445

7649674,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This is a great period drama.  Totally predictable but fun and enjoyable.  If you enjoy Jane Austin, you will enjoy this.  I hope Amazon makes more like it.  I was not a fan of Julian Fellowes talking so much.  The intro about the book and author was interesting but I was annoyed by the commentary at the end of the episodes and usually skipped it.",1464825600,,349,4.3076923076923075
7649675,5,B01BHTSIOC,"My only regret was that it was four (4) episodes!  Characters were well developed, situations were utterly believable - my problem was that I  and my friends, expected Julian to be our guide for more than 4 episodes. Who knew Julian Fellowes could develop a piece - I have not read the book - that would answer what happened to the characters, offer possible insight  into ""why"", address the cultural feelings at this time, give me and my friends  enough time to  discuss/watch each  episode and determine what the next episode would be about.
I think we thought Julian Fellowes has only one bag of tricks ( the many episodes developed for ""Downton Abbey"") and we were prepared to settle back and enjoy!  We, senior citizens, enjoyed Doctor Thorne and look forward to  the next  Julian Fellowes offering. ( I hope he is teaching a Literature class somewhere to help future writers to learn how to adapt literature written in another period to contemporary times w/o having the characters compromise their truth  - appropriate for the time in history - to engage a 21st century audience.",1464825600,4,1086,4.790322580645161

A young woman with a mysterious past that even she's not aware of struggles with her love for a young man who is willing to sacrifice everything for her. The acting was very good, the characters likable, and the setting is beautiful.  The only thing I didn't care for was the cheesy soundtrack. Other than that, I enjoyed every episode and would recommend this short series to anyone who loves period dramas.",1464825600,,468,4.765432098765432

7649693,5,B01BHTSIOC,"If you enjoyed Downton Abbey and appreciate film versions of Jane Austen novels, this four-part series is for you.

7649694,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I don't write many reviews, if any, but this series was fantastic. Julian Fellows has done it again. I thought I would hate the fact that it was such a short series, but the resolution to the story could not have been more satisfying. Love, self sacrifice, honor, duty, and money are the best combination. You will not be disappointed with this series!",1464825600,,352,4.603174603174603

7649698,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Another well-done period piece by Julian Fellowes who has a real appreciation for Anthony Trollope.  In the mid-1970s, PBS presented the Pallisers, a compilation of the Barsetshire novels.  Anyone who enjoyed this will be pleasantly surprised by Dr. Thorne.  The story may unfold a little slowly for those accustomed to the twists and turns of Downton Abbey, but the themes and character development are as interesting today as they were in the 1840s.  Beautifully shot in time-appropriate villages and manor houses.  Enjoy!",1464825600,,524,5.341463414634147

I think my favorite elements to this story is that I really found myself second guessing some of the character rolls.  I'm pretty good at reading a character and I got at least two of them wrong!!!  I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, but when you are watching a very intense, exciting, what's gonna happen next Love Story, it's great to know that GOOD can still prevail.  I give this project 5 stars because it left me wanting more!!!!  I feel in love with the lead actress and the young fellow who pursues her.  You roote for them the whole time!

7649716,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Very engaging with  good character development. Of course it is  hard not to compare it with Downton Abby since it written by is Julian Fellowes.

7649765,1,B01BHTSIOC,"I cannot believe this tawdry production passed muster with so many reviewers.  The casting, costumes, script, & production values are completely lacking in the quality which made Downton Abbey so enjoyable.  It also felt dated, like something from PBS 30 years ago.  The fevered plot suffers from a case of the vapors, the secrets are banal and boring, the scenery chewed & gnawed like a shank of mutton.  The opening credits of Downton Abbey alone had more substance and beauty than an entire episode of Dr. Thorne, and sadly, Mr. Fellows' Midas touch has turned to fool's gold.",1464739200,,579,4.877551020408164
7649766,4,B01BHTSIOC,Julian Fellowes does it again with another wonderful British story. The adaptation of Doctor Thorne has inspired me to read other stories written by the original author! Looking forward to more.,1464739200,,194,5.290322580645161

7649771,5,B01BHTSIOC,"For the reviewer who stated that it ""felt like Masterpiece Theater"", I agree. I actually loved the fireside introductions and postludes by Julian Fellowes.

Did an outstanding job with this production. The casting
Was great they made you care about them just like Trollope did in the novel. I only wish he would of done a few more episodes to develop the characters more.
The introductions to each episode by Mr. Fellowes
Also added a great touch to the series. Please make
More productions of Anthony Trollope. He is not given his due and is by far the best writer in my opinion of
The Victorian era.",1464739200,,544,4.396039603960396

7649876,5,B01BHTSIOC,Trollope has a special edginess to his depiction of Victorian society which is defined perfectly in this production by Julian Fellows.  This story is one novel in what is known as his Chronicles of Barsetshire.  Previous BBC productions of Trollope novels have been extremely successful in both attracting great casts as well as audiences.  This production stands out for the same reasons so I am hopeful that Julian Fellows will follow this with other adaptations from the Chronicles.,1464739200,,485,5.1923076923076925

7649894,5,B01BHTSIOC,"It was wonderful, and I highly recommend it to Austen and/or DA fans - almost a hybrid of the two.  Set in 1855, it is the story of a country doctor (Dr. Thorne, played by Tom Hollander (2005 Mr. Collins)), and his niece Mary, who is of questionable birth and has no money but is beloved by many in their village.

Brief plot outline:  A local, wealthy family (the Greshams) has a son, Frank, who is in love with Mary, much to the disapproval of their mother, Lady Arabella.  Lady Arabella and her husband need at least one of their children to marry into a lot of money to save their estate, which is in debt. In addition to Frank, Lady A has two daughters, Beatrice, who seems to like Mary, and Augusta, who might be inclined to be kinder to Mary but is easily persuaded to not do so by her snooty and wealthy cousin Audrina and aunt Lady DeCourcy, played by Phoebe Nicholls of Downton ( who played Lady Rose's mother). There are other characters who figure into how this will all turn out, as well, some comical, some cruel, though not one-dimensionally so.
I binge watched this over two days - just 4 short episodes, and it left me longing to read more of Trollope.  Although not a contemporary of Austen, apparently Trollope's mother lived in the same neighborhood at the same time as the Austens (or so I've read).  I've also heard folks who like Austen will like Trollope's works.",1464739200,,1387,4.440944881889764

The writing is excellent, the story is lovey and tidy (you gotta love the Victorian novel for tidiness), the cast is good, and the costumes are wonderful (I need a flower crown asap). I think it's just as beautiful and cinematic as Downton Abbey. It's a different story line, though, so of course you can't expect it to be exactly the same! It has all the same great themes, though, of class/caste, money, love, and revenge. I also think the debriefing at the end by Lord Fellowes is adorable. If you like Brit. period dramas, you'll like this.

Also, Alison Brie! She's wonderful. I loved her as Trudy Campbell, and I love her in this! There's something so hilarious about her to me. She does the job perfectly as The American Heiress.",1464739200,,746,4.567164179104478

7650015,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I liked the series a lot, but felt that there were substantial swaths of story left out.  I went ahead and downloaded the Kindle book and Audible version as well to see if I was right....and I was. I do think that overall the adaptation is fairly true to the spirit of the book, even though there are some plot points that are handled very differently.

It's really a shame that you can't dramatize Trollope's turn of phrase.  Without spoiling anything, I think I can share the following description of a gentleman who's just been hit by a rotten egg while making a speech, ""As the insidious fluid trickled down beneath his waistcoat, he felt that all further powers of coaxing the electors out of their votes, by words flowing from his tongue sweeter than honey, was for that occasion denied to him.""  I've been dying to work the word's ""insidious fluid"" into conversation for the past week...

Not really related to the plot or anything: My teenage daughter marveled at how bright some of the fabrics were in the costumes and wondered if they could possibly be accurate.  She ended up raiding my costuming books and googling to satisfy her curiosity.  Then she treated me to a lecture on the development and introduction of aniline dyes.  :)",1464739200,2,1243,4.669724770642202

7650019,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Fairly predictable but entertaining enough to watch.  People who liked Downton Abbey will like the the Julian Fellowes cadence to things.  While it is not really on the level of Downton Abbey, it is good enough.  The 4 episodes last a total of 3 hours, and the story at hand is completed within the 4 episodes.",1464739200,,310,4.5

7650023,5,B01BHTSIOC,"A great mini-series and story.  It has humor and while it is set in Victorian England, it isn't pretentious.  I would hope Amazon does another mini-series such as Doctor Thorne.",1464739200,,177,4.866666666666666
7650024,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Don't watch expecting Downton Abbey quality. It's almost a spoof.  Nothing is believable, but still entertaining!  It's like Julian Fellowes decided to take a big breath of air after being tied down for six seasons of DA!",1464739200,,221,4.945945945945946

7650038,1,B01BHTSIOC,"Expecting a Downton Abby type quality in writing and production and this isn't close. Personally, too many characters to follow in beginning without enough foundation of how the relationships fit together. Also, sound quality made it hard to understand dialogue.",1464739200,,262,5.575

7650062,5,B01BHTSIOC,Well done. I love period pieces and when I heard that Julian Fellowes was presenting this I couldn't resist and it certainly didn't disappoint. I love how Julian Fellowes preempts the program and summarizes it all as well. Very enjoyable.,1464739200,,238,4.975

7650065,3,B01BHTSIOC,"This is enjoyable, but not even remotely in the same league as ""Downton Abbey."" The tone is inconsistent. There a funky little music score which makes it feel as if it's meant to be humorous, but some of the actors are in a slightly over-the-top piece and others are deadly serious. You never really get to feel as if there is much more than a surface understanding of the world of Doctor Thorne. At the end of the day, it's not really very satisfying.",1464739200,,452,4.392857142857143

7650069,4,B01BHTSIOC,i really really really like stories like this where you can forget about your own issues and just dive into a great story told in a wonderful way -- although perfectly predictable we still need more stuff like this more more more more more -- too much graphic bang 'em up blood & guts out there -- thank you julian and pbs,1464739200,,322,4.209677419354839

7650079,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I am always primed for this type of ""period"" series. The creators have the right credentials. However, I think the disappointing thing is that the actors are just not quite good enough. The quality of the actors is not as good as most British shows in this genre. Tom Hollander (who is great in The Night Manager) is fine and Stefanie Martini is suitable, but I wish everyone was a cut above this.",1464739200,,397,4.4520547945205475

This dreary four-part drama of love and intrigue was predictable and boring. (Sorry, Julian!). The characters were unlikable and lacked depth and  the plot line  was thin. You knew exactly what was going to happen the minute Sir Louie appeared on the scene. In fact, when it was over, I found myself feeling a tad crabby for being duped and having my time wasted. I don't even think Dame Maggie could have saved this show.",1464739200,,569,4.514563106796117

Also, I think it was an unwise choice to have J. Fellowes modeling Alistaire Cooke.  Please put him in a different setting and let him be J. Fellowes.  He has a wealth of knowledge about Victorian England, manners, mores, authors, et.al.  The static mood of this chair by the ""fire"" lacks energy.",1464739200,,523,4.580645161290323

7650226,5,B01BHTSIOC,Very well done. Julian Fellowes is amazing at  screen adaptations of classic literature. He has a great understanding of the characters and his presentations before and after each episode helps viewers to clarify what's gone on and what we are about to see.

7650261,5,B01BHTSIOC,"We thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Thorne, I was not familiar with the author, Trollope previously. HIs writings seem to be a blend of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens if I were to judge by the mini-series.  I'm not sure I was wild about Julian Fellows commentaries--perhaps it would have been better if there had just been a brief into at the beginning of the series and then a short afterword at the end. It did help to get more of a cultural context from Fellows, however, for those who have not widely read 19th Century English literature.  I hope that Amazon.com does more of Trollpe's books, judging by this one this practically forgotten 19th Century author deserves a 2nd look.

The production values, photography, music,  and scenery of the show were very vibrant and alive looking and up to theatrical cinematic values.  Bright colors abounded and it lacked the grim impoverished look or exegerated steampunk look that many series featuring the 1800s seem to have adopted.  It was definitely on a par with anything Masterpiece has been doing over the last few years.",1464739200,2,1066,4.829670329670329

7650290,3,B01BHTSIOC,"With a resume touting the makers of Downtown Abbey, one expects to find the very best.  Perhaps the problem is that it sets our expectations a little too high.  This feel good drama is set at the end of the Victorian era where class, 'breeding' and money mean everything.  America is booming with 'new', working class money and the aristocratic ways of excess minus the sweat of the brow are quickly swirling down the toilet.  Rich, aristocratic families are quickly finding that simply owning land can't keep up with the rising prices of living while cities, industry and the tycoons it produced taunt their ideas of 'acceptable' matches in marriages when they face the loss of their homes vs. the acceptance of children of working men.  *egads!*  Doctor Thorne presents us with an aristocratic family in just such a position.  Their lovely son is in love with a commoner girl, the child of a doctor (even he is too common for the family's taste.)  They do their best to dissuade the marriage between the two in the hopes of forcing their son to 'wed money', even if it is 'vulgar, new money.'  Of course, the entire point of the book and movie is to show the shallowness of the rich and the beauty of the more common man.  But in all fairness, the book does allow for at least one good rich man- Frank, the son who must decide to save his family or serve his own happiness by marrying the woman he truly loves.  Watch the movie to see which direction he turns.  I love 'feel good' endings, but I don't love when a movie is, well, badly done.  The film, from the beginning, treats us like children, as if we don't know how we should feel as the characters do and say things.  Even the music is overdone.  When the scene is supposed to be funny or ironic, the music is goofy and funny.  I felt like I was watching an old flick from the 50's!  The acting was also overblown sometimes.  Especially the evil Louis.  Sir Roger Scatcherd was pretty hard to watch as well.  I know a lot of people complained of Julian Fellowes commenting before and after each episode.  That kind of thing doesn't affect me at all if the movie itself is good.  You can just ff through it.  Over all, the film was still fun to watch.  It was something to do while I worked on my art pieces at my desk.  But I would never take serious time to watch it.  That's what's so good about Amazon- once you pay for it, it's free, so no loss.  But I wouldn't recommend paying a penny to see it.  So, let's just put it that way.  Great to fill some time, but not good enough to spend money to see it.",1464652800,24,2565,4.318658280922432

7650294,3,B01BHTSIOC,"The show is a decently entertaining drama set in Victorian Englandmore specifically, the moneyed class of 1856. On its own, it would be an average or even slightly above average TV drama. But Julian Fellowes (creator & writer of Downton Abbey) is the screenwriter for this series, which is based on a novel that is NOT written by Fellowes. The show is promoted as being ""Presented by Julian Fellowes"" and thus is meant to draw in the many Downton Abbey fans who already miss the frolicking excitement of British high society. That instantly sets up a comparison in viewers' minds with Downton, and let me tell you, when compared to Downton Abbey, Doctor Thorne is a letdown.

The characters are much more two-dimensional, with the ""good guys"" being overly pure and kindhearted and the ""bad guys"" being inhumanly cruel and selfish. The rich American girl is annoyingly conceited. The two young lovers really have no substantial connection, at least none shown on screen. Doctor Thorne is by far the most compelling character on the show, and Tom Hollander does a spectacular job with what he is given. But even so, any one of Downton Abbey's characters are more compelling than him, unfortunately.

As a television period piece, Doctor Thorne isn't bad. If you're interested in 1850s English high society, the show is just decent enough to merit your time. But as a comparison to the brilliant writing and acting of Downton Abbey, the series is subpar.",1464652800,2,1451,4.894308943089431

Trollope never wanted his novels to have too much suspense, indeed he would spoil his own story with an aside to the ""dear reader"" if he sensed that suspense was building.

A good story should never need to be explained. Just skip those parts and enjoy great acting, costumes, and settings, but just 4 stars for the scripts. There were no surprises here and if you have a very evil person in a four-episode drama, you know his fate from the get-go.

7650494,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Great adaptation of Hollander's book.  If we can't have Downton Abbey, this was second best.  Great acting also.  Fellowes should be proud.",1464652800,,139,5.2272727272727275
7650495,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Story too convoluted, but we'll give it a few more episodes",1464652800,,59,4.454545454545454
7650496,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Engaging drama, certainly not as captivating as Downton Abbey. The romance between Mary and Frank is never interesting enough to drive the plot, but Fellowes (in classic fashion) lets the class drama do the real work. Fantastic sets and costumes and performances from the supporting cast. Definitely worth a watch if you're looking for something simultaneously slightly intelligent and slightly indulgent.

This is not the best BBC period drama, nor the best of Trollope's stories, but it's a beautifully told story with the most predictable outcome imaginable.",1464652800,,561,5.448275862068965
7650497,5,B01BHTSIOC,Julian Fellowes and Trollope are quite a suitable marriage!,1464652800,,59,5.666666666666667
7650498,3,B01BHTSIOC,Let me begin by saying I would watch anything with Julian Fellowes name in the credits. I found this series entertaining but not adictive. I think Julian could have written the book better than the original author. There were no twists & turns to really captivate an audience like Julian usually does. It is difficult to make real magic with someone else's work.,1464652800,,362,4.761904761904762

7650503,5,B01BHTSIOC,Fantastic!  Authentic!  Wonderful!!!  I am going to watch it again!,1464652800,,67,5.5
7650504,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Not much dramatic tension here (though the dinner party is well set up and executed0,  but the acting is stylish and the writing smooth. Not one I'd put on the shelf in my collection, but definitely a solid evening's entertainment.",1464652800,,231,4.775

Why do I feel like Julian F. has a thing for Alfred Hitchcock?  His introductions were rather silly and superfluous...",1464652800,,203,5.3125
7650508,3,B01BHTSIOC,Just ok. Was wanting something more like Downton Abbey,1464652800,,54,5.111111111111111

7650522,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Beautiful landscapes and superb period art direction don't make up for the fact that this is overstated and dumbed down Trollope. Some of the acting is very fine (Tom Hollander) but some is terrible (actor playing Louis). I didn't like watching Julian Fellowes trying to be Allistair Cooke, and the commentary was just banal. Very disappointing overall.",1464652800,,353,5.2105263157894735
7650523,5,B01BHTSIOC,Love it!,1464652800,,8,3.5
7650524,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This is a rollicking English comedy enjoyed by those of us who are having Downton Abbey withdrawal symptoms.  The typical 1850's stereotypes are rampart.  Handsome young men whose job is to seek out and marry an heiress or better yet an American who has wads of money to bail out the family estate that is about to go bankrupt.  And the daughters of these peers also have to find suitable (men with means) husbands.  Julian Fellowes introduces each episode and then wraps up the episode with his observations of society of the 1850's.  This is easy watching, lush country-sides, beautiful and elegant homes, beautiful people and extravagant costumes.  I couldn't help myself, I watched all 4 episodes in one sitting!",1464652800,,716,4.925

7650529,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I found this beautifully done and very entertaining.  I really did find Mr. Fellowes a bit irritating after awhile though.  He either should have just introduced episodes or did the follow up, not both.",1464652800,,202,4.911764705882353

7650544,5,B01BHTSIOC,Fun and well produced.  I think they stretched this as along as necessary for a mini-series book adaptation.  I could have used a little less of Mr. Fellows introducing each segment was overkill.  Begin and End for him.  I hope they do some more of this author.,1464652800,,261,4.48936170212766

7650576,4,B01BHTSIOC,"We just can't muster the same enthusiasm for Trollope that Fellowes expresses.  The characters are thin as paper; even silly, even for Victorian standards I would guess.  However, there is a beauty in the settings and historical ambiance that is trademark Fellowes engaging and masks so many flaws in the plots, characterizations, and even dialogue.  And, his arm chair chats with us are pretty fluffy and I just don't buy his sincerity at all.  I just know Hitchcock is somewhere throwing up at a 21st century rip at his schtick!",1464652800,,530,4.855555555555555

'Good' families who have squandered their fortunes, scheming to improve them by marriage.  A good girl whose reputation is tarnished by illegitimacy. An American heiress.  A love triangle.  A rogue (or two), and of course, in the midst of all - the patient, reasonable, good Dr. Thorne.  Enjoyable short series.

7650660,4,B01BHTSIOC,It was okay. Didn't like the intro with Julian Fellowes. It reminded me of an Alfred Hitchcock show.,1464652800,,100,4.611111111111111

7650667,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Thoroughly enjoyable. It is rewarding to be able to find great entertainment without all the sex and violence that so often accompanies current shows. As much as I found Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones fascinating, it is nice to be able to have a change of pace.",1464652800,,263,4.5
7650668,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Pretty good, old-fashioned period piece, but I expected more from Julian Fellowes.  It's not in the same class as Downton, that's for sure.",1464652800,,139,5.043478260869565

7650670,5,B01BHTSIOC,We throughly enjoyed this series. We were avid D. Abbey fans and this was just as delightful and well executed.  We binged and watch all four chapters in one night.,1464652800,,164,4.466666666666667
7650671,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Very engaging story that is well acted. This is very much a ""chick flic"" series but one that even the most ardent ""muscles from Brussels"" fans can enjoy.",1464652800,,153,4.5
7650672,4,B01BHTSIOC,Love the era and enjoyed the episodes.  Julian Fellows is a terrific story teller.,1464652800,,82,4.857142857142857
7650673,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Four episodes don't allow the development of characters or story line. Does not have the richness of Downton Abbey and the characters are rather shallow and annoying.

7650690,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I always enjoy Julian Fellowes and loved Downton Abbey, but I wasn't wild about Doctor Thorne.  It was very predictable and seemed very ""soap opera-like"".  If there is a second season, I will not watch it.  A bit disappointing.",1464652800,,227,4.769230769230769

7650696,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Don't go in expecting ""Downton Abbey"" - it's a different time, though with some of the same overriding concerns (landed gentry trying to find the money to avoid selling off the entire estate, the desire to marry for love vs. pressure to marry for money, etc). Still, a good start through the first installment.",1464652800,,310,4.7592592592592595

7650707,1,B01BHTSIOC,"Seems to me that Fellowes--a spectacular writer, director and wit--thinks (and Amazon obviously agrees) that there is an endless appetite in the U.S. for British period drama. Maybe they are right, but I have had enough Yorkshire Pudding for the time being. He obviously is riding the coattails of Downton Abbey. Good for him, but I he's lost me with this one. It's not that good. And please, the Masterpiece Theatre Alistair Cooke armchair thing? I'm done.",1464652800,,457,4.9480519480519485

The actress playing his niece looks the part, but I found her acting self-absorbed and annoying.  All the other acting is quite hammy.

7650750,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Too simplistic a story. And gee, the happy ending is that the rich get richer. How perfect for Mr Fellows. And he thinks he has channeled Alfred Hitchcock with his commentaries fore and aft the episodes. Again how precious!

7650764,3,B01BHTSIOC,"An OK story, not nearly as detailed or elaborate as Downton Abbey but fine to watch when you're looking for something to fill some time. Wish that the storyline and characters could have been filled out a bit more. There are four 42-minute episodes that include intros and closing comments by Julian Fellowes.

7650878,5,B01BHTSIOC,"The series is a joy to watch. The beauty and trials of Victorian living are splendidly portrayed. The architecture and scenery are dazzling. Julian Fellowes' brief commentary before and after each episode adds a fine touch. Overall, its not quite Downton Abbey, but it satisfies hunger for the genre.",1464652800,,300,5.142857142857143

There was a little violence, but not a lot, and the drama was just enough to keep things interesting.",1464652800,,394,4.6521739130434785
7650918,5,B01BHTSIOC,"It was exactly what you would expect from J. Fellowes - a lush and beautiful production.  It wasn't exactly like I remembered Doctor Thorne's plot but it was close enough to be an absorbing story with a lovely cast.  We need more dramatic presentations of Trollope's work.  He is much more interesting than Austen or any of the other writers of that period.  I, for one, would love to see more Trollope!",1464652800,,403,4.555555555555555

Stefanie Martini, who only has one other imdb credit, is perfect as the strong-willed heroine (so much more relatable than those soupy Dickens girls!); predictably, the picturesque exteriors and the dorky Mid-Victorian costumes and dcor are right on the money",1464652800,,749,5.097560975609756

I was kept interested in this series because it had a story line of interest, settings, and Julian Fellowes giving us an introduction to each episode.

My daughter loved it so much that she started re-watching it the following morning.

7651008,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Beautifully told story about love and the demands of society in what might be thought of as another explanatory backstory for Downton Abbey fans, though it certainly is more than that.  We didn't know what to expect, but Doctor Thorne turned out to be entertaining and satisfying as the optimistic and principled characters, Frank and Mary, chose their own paths through the expectations and conniving family troubles they faced.  Fun to see Julian Fellowes maybe channeling an inner Alistair Cooke, as he retells what he describes as a favorite work of his favorite novelist, Anthony Trollope.  It is hard for us to believe just how mercenary the marriage process became in Victorian England, but the mixture of Trollope's studied and well-crafted criticism and Fellowes' incredible visual storytelling really did give us historical insights (with possible application to our own money-driven culture), while we learned and laughed and commiserated. We were sorry there were only four episodes!",1464652800,,995,5.365384615384615

7651014,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I was surprised by this recent work of Julian Fellowes. I was expecting more quality writing and acting than what was conveyed. The story line was simplistic and predictable...it felt like one was watching a soap opera with a bit too much soap. Since I have not read the book maybe there wasn't much Fellowes could do toimprove it. However, the costuming and scenery throughout were a saving grace in viewing as well as his clever fireside introductions to the story before each episode.",1464652800,,487,4.809523809523809

7651109,5,B01BHTSIOC,"It was very good, not quite as good as Downton Abbey, but the characters were interesting, the story held one's interest, settings were beautiful. I enjoyed seeing the costumes, countryside, furnishings of the mansions, and the architecture. I would watch anything by Julian Fellowes.",1464652800,,284,5.4772727272727275

7651112,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Good story, and we all like a good outcome. Snobby people get what's coming to them. Julian Fellowes should not have done the introductions and endings. He seemed to be mocking Alfred Hitchcock.",1464652800,,194,4.909090909090909
7651113,5,B01BHTSIOC,I really enjoyed this show. Mary and Frank are endearing. I found the Greshams to be very funny and entertaining.  I hope there are more seasons to come.,1464652800,,153,4.464285714285714

7651115,4,B01BHTSIOC,Sweet Victorian movie with a tough of Little Women. Kind of sappy but fun to watch. Acting is great and you will recognize many of the actors from other Masterpiece programs.,1464652800,,174,4.645161290322581

7651118,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This was a masterful presentation of Trollop's work.  Julian Fellowes took good advantage of the time he was given to develop the characters over 4 episodes.  The acting was superb.  Doctor Thorn and Mary were given the best possible things to say but the actors had to deliver these lines with the right attitudes and body language which they did quite well.  Everyone sensible loves Mary, and you will too.  But the work is called Doctor Thorne for good reasons obvious throughout the story.",1464652800,,493,4.821428571428571

7651120,4,B01BHTSIOC,"We liked the story, thought it would last a little longer.  It's obvious that there's little different between then and now.  It just may be that the human race is far less civilized that we'll admit.",1464652800,,200,4.527777777777778
7651121,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I liked that it was a one book series. I confess I wanted to see Ian McShane and Alison Brie the most, but all the actors were very good and one recognizable from Pride & Prejudice,  playing Dr, Thorne, who was awesome in his performance.. I enjoyed the fireside chats with Fellowes because we did not get to know him with Downton Abbey. I enjoyed his insights and passion about Anthony Trollope's work. Many of Trollope's books are free for Kindle, and I am always glad to find a new writer to enjoy. More of these would be fun -- bring these short series on!",1464652800,,560,4.333333333333333

7651127,2,B01BHTSIOC,"I couldn't believe how amateurish and cheesy Dr. Thorne was. I actually thought it intentionally campy, with Julian Fellowes sitting in an overstuffed chair, offering an overstuffed explanation at the beginning an end of each episode.",1464566400,,234,5.527777777777778
7651128,5,B01BHTSIOC,Loved it!  Julian Fellowes is a talented writer and his version of Doctor Thorne was beautifully presented.  I was sad that there were only four episodes.,1464566400,,154,4.884615384615385

7651132,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Very predictable plot, but I enjoyed watching nonetheless. Visually appealing and some good acting and interesting characters.  JF's intro/epilogues seem like a nostalgic homage to Alistair Cooke/Masterpiece Theatre, but the commentary seems superfluous for such a short series.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that this makes for a fun binge-watch.",1464566400,,359,5.754716981132075

7651180,2,B01BHTSIOC,"I am surprised this got such good reviews. Although not a bad story, it is a bit predictable. Casting was average. A few characters come across as wooden. (The role of the American heiress was by far the best.)  Apart from the Doctor and his niece there really was little chemistry between any of  those supposedly in love. As is often the case with romances and shorter series there are big missing chunk of time where people meet and are suddenly attached to one another either romantically or through friendship (even allowing for the time). The costume design was pretty good and probably the best aspect of the production.",1464566400,,627,4.743119266055046

On second thought, I realized that it was still a pleasure to watch and was pretty true to what Trollope wanted to portray, even if jazzed up for modern tastes in a few spots.  The actors fit their roles excellently.  I only wish Mr. Fellowes had been given another hour or two to flesh it out.  I will definitely watch it again.",1464566400,,507,4.478260869565218

Costumes are wonderful, large cast of characters, just wish the leading lady's love interest was more handsome.

7651361,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I love Anthony Trollope and was giddy when I saw Dr Thorne pop up in my feed. If you're not familiar with Trollope, this is a good place to start. I have to say that Julian Fellowes did an excellent job of bringing the novel to the small screen, and while it doesn't follow the written work completely, it was pretty close. I'm sure that some of the events were changed for time constraints, and the book certainly had more background info, especially regarding the clergy and the voting customs of the time, but this series did stay pretty true to the novel. Overall I was pleased, and blew through all of these in a long evening.

I really hope that JF makes more of Trollope's works into series like this one. Part of the glory of reading Trollope is that every book refers to characters from previous books until the stories are all intertwined. You really get to feel as if you live in his world, and Julian Fellowes does that well also. I would definitely watch any others he decides to do, and I highly recommend this one.",1464566400,9,1029,4.41578947368421

7651422,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Filmed in and around stately piles in Wiltshire, Somerset, and Hertfordshire, DOCTOR THORNE convincingly recreates a world of rigid socio-economic divisions where everyone was supposed to know their place and accept it. This is the eternal conflict between money, power, and love that underpins the plot. Pauper Mary Thorne (Stefanie Martini) loves rich Frank Gresham (Harry Richardson), but their path towards true romance is perpetually blocked by Frank's avaricious mother Lady Arabella (Rebecca Front). we have the perfect recipe for a series of conflicts between characters of different generations and different socioeconomic groups. At the story's heart stands the eponymous Doctor Thorne (Tom Hollander), a basically goodhearted person with a penchant for protecting those less able to defend themselves against unwanted social criticism. The script is not without its humorous elements, especially in the comic opportunities given to Lady Arabella and her equally avaricious sister-in-law the Countess de Courcy (Phoebe Nicholls). Like a pair of aging dowagers they stride through the Gresham family seat, knocking everything and everyone aside in their attempts to break up Mary and Frank's affair. Oh what tangled webs we create when once we choose to deceive. I for one am so glad that we have our own individual free agency today to choose who we love and desire to marry.  You will find this film extremely watchable. So enjoy.  Rosemary Kerr.",1464566400,,1457,5.442477876106195

7651619,5,B01BHTSIOC,"If you favor Victorian romance, and liked Jullian Fellows' Downton Abbey, you will enjoy his adaption of Anthony Trollope's Dr. Thorne.

7651630,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I loved this ""series"".  It was honestly only the length of a somewhat long movie.  One issue I had was that the titular Doctor Thorne was barely in this series and never seemed like the main character.

7651636,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Overall the presentation was well done; however, the commentary by Julian Fellows did more to confuse that inspire.

7651638,3,B01BHTSIOC,You don't get quite involved with the characters as you did in Downton. Maybe they need a Dowager Countess to stir things up.,1464566400,,125,4.478260869565218
7651639,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Ponderous.  Slow and very self-aware starting with Uncle Julian impersonating Alistair Cooke from the old Masterpiece theater days.  Not a good look for Julian.  It's an adaptation of a short story and it shows.  There's not much plot here and it lacks the panache that collaborators bring to Fellowes' work in Downton Abbey and Gosford Park.  If you are sick in bed and have already binged everything else on your list, this would be an appropriate choice but not a raging success.  Do not expect to be riveted.",1464566400,,512,4.761363636363637

7651642,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Well done adaptation of a British classic...The characters are engaging and, while the outcome is predictable, it's fun to watch.

7651644,5,B01BHTSIOC,Rally enjoyed Doctor Thorne. This series is done very well. Julian Fellowes comments at the opening and closing added to understanding of the story and the author of the original novel. Hope we see more of this quality programing from Amazon.,1464566400,,242,4.926829268292683

7651653,4,B01BHTSIOC,I enjoyed it well enough.  Worth watching but not so interesting or engrossing as most of the Trollope series I have been lucky enough to view - a little too lightweight - this might be because the writer of Downton Abbey wrote the script and his work tends to be lightweight.,1464566400,,276,4.411764705882353

7651660,4,B01BHTSIOC,Liked the story line but it was a little slow here and there. Fellowes acting like Hitchcock was a hoot!,1464566400,,104,4.25
7651661,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Great series as I am a huge fan of historical dramas. I did know of the author, but the story line was very interesting and it is always interesting to see how people lived and the social decorum of the times. I hope there are more to come!",1464566400,,240,4.020833333333333

7651672,5,B01BHTSIOC,Excellent well acted period drama. Julian Fellowes is the master of the period piece. Love all of the beautiful locations they used to filmed this show. Anyone who enjoyed Downton Abbey will definitely enjoy this show.,1464566400,,218,5.083333333333333
7651673,3,B01BHTSIOC,Much as I like Sir Julian's writing and acting this is not up to snuff.  Much too melodramatic and soap operaish.  Not true to the feeling of the Barchester novels.  OK to while away time,1464566400,,187,4.285714285714286

7651680,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I love period films very much. For whatever reason, from my strange mind, I kept thinking of how the old Pink Panthers movies ran.

7651681,5,B01BHTSIOC,My wife and I really enjoyed it. Stephanie Martini is excellent (as Mary Thorne) as are the other actors. The story line is a bit reminiscent of Downtown Abbey but different enough to make it enjoyable. The antagonist is someone to despise (Louie).

7651737,5,B01BHTSIOC,The best part was Julian Fellows introductions and after talk. I am a big Trollope fan and every now and then need a happy ending.,1464566400,,130,4.24
7651738,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Although the ending was easy to guess, the short series was still enjoyable. The acting was good, and the scenery fantastic. I wish the series/adaption was stretched out a bit more, over more episodes, but it didn't detract from the entertainment value.",1464566400,,253,5.0476190476190474

7651745,5,B01BHTSIOC,I loved that Julian Fellowes introduced each show with some insight for the viewers and gave a summary after each show as well. I hope he does more adaptations from Trollope's books!,1464566400,,182,4.71875

7651754,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Very disappointing. By then end of the first episode, it was rather clear how the series plot would unfold, and the way that it did was clunky and poorly written. Lovely scenery and some good acting can't carry a program on its own. The introductions and wrap-ups to each episode revealed Julian Fellowes in all his swollen-headed buffoonery. It was embarrassing, so thank goodness it was easy to fast forward to skip these ill-conceived ""chats."" This is one to skip unless you have absolutely nothing else to do.",1464566400,,513,4.840909090909091

7651757,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I liked it overall, but it annoys me when everyone but one character gets the happy ending.  She wasn't  undeserving of that.  A Victorian Era historical/farce always seem to be about manners and doing the right thing.  It was predictable and for want of a better term ""Austen-y"", which I happen to enjoy.  If you like the genre you will like this mini series.",1464566400,,360,4.5625

7651767,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I loved it and wished it had been more episodes.  I love this kind of story whether it be a little predictable or not.  The actors, the scenery, the dialogue, the costumes are all  beautiful.  And, as cheesy as some may think it, I loved Julian Fellowes introducing each episode, sort of a little bit Masterpiece Theatre and a little bit Alfred Hitchcock.

7651782,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Lovely to look at and thoroughly entertaining  if you enjoy the usual Victorian stereotypes--which I do!

Community's Alision Brie as a cynical, very amused American heiress is icing on.the cake.

There is an odd low budget quality to this short series. Pleanty of costumes, the typically good British sense of location, fine production values but the acting is off somehow - either too passionate or not enough or some other quality that is not easily identified. It feels as if we are watching second tier actors - unfair of me to say I know. Perhaps there was not enough rehearsal time, perhaps the script was more hindrance than help but sad to say this is no Downton Abbey and is a shade below Mr. Selfridge.",1464566400,2,728,4.6953125

7651944,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Pleasant enough to pass the time, but don't expect to be wowed. Hollander, Alsion Brie, and Ian McShane all do nice work, but most of the characters are boilerplate cliches. If you like this sort of thing, it's passable, but if you don't see the end coming a mile away by the end of the first episode, you need to read more. There are just too many better things that fall roughly into this category for me to recommend this strongly. ""The Grand"", ""North & South"", or classics like ""Brideshead Revisited"" or ""Upstairs Downstairs"" offer period costume drama of a much more unpredictable and engrossing variety. ""Cranford"" and ""The Paradise"" are also very good, as is ""Mr. Selfridge."" If you're looking for something to ease the loss of ""Downton Abbey"" this is just a snack cracker, not a full meal.",1464566400,,797,4.7

7651986,5,B01BHTSIOC,Jillian Fellowes really gives us what we love.  I am looking forward to his next project.,1464566400,,89,4.5625
7651987,4,B01BHTSIOC,I wouldn't have missed this for anything.  And would even watch it again.  But after one has seen Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth it is hard to give this a full five star review.  It had all the bells and whistles but they just weren't polished.  Of course I realize this was done in four hours which makes it difficult to include all the little touches. Trollope obviously must have been an Austen admirer.,1464566400,,412,4.453333333333333
7651988,3,B01BHTSIOC,Poor acting; actors too stiff; they didn't appear to be enjoying or feel comfortable with their rolls.,1464566400,,102,5.0588235294117645

7651997,4,B01BHTSIOC,I liked the presentation and the closing of each episode by Julian Fellowes as he set the stage for the story. A season with only four episodes does seem rather short to me but it was certainly well done.,1464566400,,204,4.256410256410256
7651998,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I wasn't instantly sold on this show  - it was touted as being like Downton Abbey and it is not  - but it piqued interest enough to keep me watching. I'm glad I did because it was well worth it. It's a different time period (Victorian) than Downton Abbey and the approach to the story and characters is more droll and amusing. It's a wonderful character study show, with great period art direction and costuming, and though the story presents life with tragedies and bad people in it, it is overall lighthearted, wise and filled with charm. I would have loved for it to continue past the 4 episodes.",1464566400,,599,4.486238532110092

7652006,5,B01BHTSIOC,Well done in  the genre of well adapted well written British fiction. The acting was excellent revealing the characters from inside out. The cinematography brought out the abundance of scenery in aristocratic mid-19th century Britain. And the plot had that Dickensian twist that's so satisfying to experience.,1464566400,,309,5.574468085106383

7652039,3,B01BHTSIOC,"A lot of scenery chewing by all actors. If you are looking  for a replay of Downton Abbey you aren't going to find it here. First of all, Julian Fellowes didn't write the story, he adapted it from a Trollope novel. Predictable all the way to the sugar sweet Disney ending. Still, not a bad way to spend a few hours, among gorgeous castles/manor houses and lovely clothes.",1464566400,,371,4.455882352941177

7652049,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Enjoyed it, Tom Hollander is wonderful, the rest of the cast is fair to the task and Mr. Fellowes introductions and post mortems are delightful.  Not as rich and absorbing as Downton and probably unfair to compare, but people will watch it because of their fondness for all things Downton.

7652072,5,B01BHTSIOC,"First, I must confess, I am a hopeless Anglophile.  Mr. Fellowes obviously knows how to engage our romantic notions about culture and geography in a manner that captivates our imagination, and if you are  descendent of a parent born in England like I am, the hook is set very easily.  I am hopeful that this current endeavor of Mr. Fellowes lives up to my expectations, so far so good. I certainly enjoyed seeing Mr. Fellowes in a bit part in Monarch of the Glen.

7652079,5,B01BHTSIOC,"As a longtime reader of Anthony Trollope's books, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Amazon and Mr. Fellows had adapted one of his works for television. I have not been disappointed. The quality of the production and the actors is fine. A great deal of information is compressed into the first episode. Once past that, the plot develops at a reasonable pace in keeping with modern sensibilities. Great social satire is rare. Jane Austen, William Makepeace Thackeray and Charles Dickens are the few that stand out besides Trollope prior to the 20th century. In many ways, the Big Four have few peers in our modern era probably because the 20th century was one of the bloodiest in recorded history. This production allows the viewer a glimpse into a more ordered world with mores we may consider to be outdated but with social dynamics which have never gone out of fashion. That's the beauty of Trollope and the other great satirists; they describe behaviors that are universal to the human condition. The petty spite and malice, the shunning of persons not "" belonging "" to this or that clique or class and the like are universal to human societies everywhere. Don't kid yourselves: it's all still there, wearing different clothing and speaking a multitude of languages and it hasn't changed. That's why we can laugh at our Barchester Towers because it's Our Town.",1464566400,,1367,4.871244635193133

The story of a young girl, born of dark circumstances, and raised by the good Doctor is classic.  The obsession with money by Doctor Thorne's neighbors, the tangled plots of love and marriage, and tests of character all make this mini-series a delight.",1464566400,,377,4.681818181818182

7652109,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I found this show captivating.  In fact, I watched the entire season in two sittings.  It would have been one sitting, but I pulled myself away to do the things necessary to sustain life.  Julian Fellowes once again did not disappoint.  Unlike Downton, this is not his original but an adaption of an author he likes.  ( or that is how I understand it.).  Whatever the case, well done, Mr. Fellowes.  I enjoyed his comments also.  I hope there is a season 2.",1464566400,,457,4.421686746987952
7652110,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Loved it!!!!  So happy to see Anthony Trollope as it should be.  Great casting and the costumes are accurate for time period.  So far,  it seems like Julian Fellows remains true to Trollope's writing and his stories without an agenda.  Just let Trollope's stories speak for themselves",1464566400,,284,4.957446808510638

7652117,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Not up to the quality script of Downton Abbey.  The characters portrayed were a somewhat one dimensional, which had the effect of compromising the narrative tension.

7652120,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Too much narration before and after program. On the first episode It was helpful before the program began, but not necessary every time. I fast forwarded through them on the other episodes and shut it off so I didn't have to listen.",1464566400,,232,4.5476190476190474

7652123,4,B01BHTSIOC,Good start not as classy as the Abbey but well done. Too much emphasis on going broke not suitable for the time but as usuall a great story and very watchable,1464566400,,158,4.129032258064516
7652124,5,B01BHTSIOC,My wife watched this and loved it! She said she was clapping at the end of the final episode in our living room... haha,1464566400,,119,4.0

7652142,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I am transported back to the days of Masterpiece Theatre period dramas introduced by Alistair Cook.  In similar fashion, Julian educates, entertains and seduces me with the believable promise of a great story.  And the production delivers!",1464566400,,239,5.4324324324324325
7652143,5,B01BHTSIOC,Very good I liked that Mr. Fellows speaks after each show. Kind of confusing at the beginning until you get who is who. The characters are so endearing you want the small series to go on and on. I hope Julian Fellowes will do more of these for Amazon!,1464566400,,251,4.142857142857143

7652165,3,B01BHTSIOC,OK but the ending was a little too predictable.,1464566400,,47,4.333333333333333

7652171,4,B01BHTSIOC,I enjoyed it.,1464566400,,13,3.6666666666666665
7652172,5,B01BHTSIOC,A good way to assuage the loss of Downton. What I wish Fellows would do is create a series about the new rich of the United States and their obsession with and seeking of the royals of Europe for marriage and status. Dr Thorne is a wonderful insight into Victorian England.,1464566400,,273,4.372549019607843

7652181,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I enjoyed it. It is played a little broader than Downton Abbey, it lacks its subtlety, but arguably Trollope's book has a satirical edge to it that perhaps asks for broader comedy- it still could have been played at times with more restraint. The cast was excellent as was the visual look. As a result I've been listening to the original book to see how it handled the source material and that has been a fun addition to the film.",1464566400,,430,4.3875

7652191,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I did watch the first season, of four (4) episodes.  I would hardly call this a season.  The story is good; but the last episode seems to run at high speed compared to the previous 3 episodes.  It was disappointing that the season was so short.  I expected more after watching Downton Abbey.  Julian Fellowes begins and ends each episode with a brief introduction and conclusion to what you are about to watch or have watched.  This ended up being a bother/negative rather than a plus for me.  You can judge this for yourself.",1464566400,,526,4.531914893617022
7652192,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I admit to being a Trollope reader so this put the series into the high regard category almost sight unseen. Also an Anglophile ( brought up to be one) and a lover of costume dramas ( beautiful and stately homes included). In addition, there were great performances in this miniseries.
( It was especially interesting to see Tom Hollander in the title role, having recently seen him inhabit a totally different character in another TV miniseries) While predictable in plot, I still found this delightful. Maybe not for everybody, but I immediately recommended it to my sister in law, who reported that she loved it. And I loved the little visits from Julian Fellowes.",1464566400,,667,4.859649122807017

7652234,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I love Julian Fellowes' work and this is no exception. It departed a bit from his more sophisticated storytelling in his other productions but Dr. Thorne is dramatic with excellent acting, as usual.
I wouldn't say this is my favorite of his stories but that can be chalked up to personal preference-a little too simple for me? But the set, location, acting, cast and storytelling were well done.",1464566400,,395,4.823529411764706

7652257,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Although somewhat predictable, it was a joy to watch!  Always looking for more period pieces that aren't detective mysteries or World Wars.  Like Duckens and Jane Austen, this is what I like to watch!",1464566400,,200,4.852941176470588

7652263,5,B01BHTSIOC,Entertaining. I love the costumes and characters. My favorite is Alison Brie's character. She is delightfully irreverent and truthful in a way none of the other characters allowed to in this society. Greatly look forward to the net season,1464566400,,238,5.128205128205129
7652264,5,B01BHTSIOC,I'd give it 6 stars if I could!  Awesome story!  Everything about it was great!,1464566400,,79,4.2
7652265,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This was a delightful 4-parter that made for easy binging! The cast and scenery were lovely and the plot, while predictable, kept me engaged. A nice surprise was seeing Cordelia, from the original ""Brideshead Revisited"" in a supporting role.",1464566400,,241,5.205128205128205

7652268,5,B01BHTSIOC,"A bit convoluted and hard to follow at first, but this quickly crystallized into a marvelous, riveting romantic tale. Parts two and three went by so fast, I just could not stop watching. First rate production in all ways, and the performances from each and every actor was nothing short of superb. Thank Lord Fellowes, you've hit another one out of the park.",1464566400,,358,4.698412698412699
7652269,4,B01BHTSIOC,Just meh. For Julian Fellows I'm not sure this is what he should have follows Downton with. I burned through this pretty quickly.,1464566400,,129,4.6521739130434785

7652271,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Very well acted & a nice period piece. My only complaint had to do with Julian Fellowes introduction and summary at the start and end of each episode. It was as if he was trying to raise expectations where as the story played out in a very predictable fashion. Having said all that, it is an enjoyable diversion.",1464566400,,312,4.396551724137931

7652276,3,B01BHTSIOC,"This was an enjoyable diversion for several evenings. Unlike Jane Austen, author Anthony Trollope dispensed with the intrigue and almost all the characters were incredibly honest about their motives and characters. Acting was good overall, but the plot line was incredibly predictable (partially because of the aforementioned honesty).",1464566400,,335,6.0

The characters were likeable and well played, the costumes and scenery beautifully done in what is expected of a program connected to the name of Julian Fellowes.

7652354,4,B01BHTSIOC,"This read like a romance novel, which I liked. The casting was great, acting good as well. I was left at the very end with a feeling of 'Huh?' as the story wrapped up so (supposedly) happily, with the building conflict being swept away with some very predictable and convenient happenings. I think it could have been stretched to 5 or 6 episodes with some great twists (maybe Mary has left the area for a whirlwind tour to escape her broken heart, maybe Frank has gotten himself betrothed tot he wealthy American who refuses to let him go, etc.).
And the silk flowers in the girl's hair looked very fake - were they supposed to appear as real flowers? Hmmm.... Mr. Fellowes did much more intriguing work with Downton Abbey.",1464566400,,723,4.569230769230769
7652355,5,B01BHTSIOC,Top notch British drama that lands somewhere between a Jane Austin experience and a Charles Dickens dilemma. Really enjoyed it and was only disappointed that it was a limited four episode affair. Great casting also.,1464566400,,215,5.171428571428572

7652357,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I hate to say anything against the genius that is Julian Fellowes, but it's just okay... it's no Downton Abbey. I guess it depends on what you want in a show.

As a great fan of Downton Abbey, Gosford Park, and the other mini series based on Anthony Trollope's novels (""The Way We Live Now"" and ""He Knew He Was Right""), this is a very big disappointment.

7652450,3,B01BHTSIOC,"The witty lines are lacking.  More depth could have been added to the characters.  They appear to be one-dimensional. In some ways it's like it wants to be Pride and Prejudice, but definitely isn't.

It's pretty light and entertaining enough if you are in the mood for a period piece and don't mind the issues that I describe above, go for it. Otherwise, you may end up skipping much of it without missing a beat.",1464566400,,413,4.48
7652451,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Had to say I'm quite disappointed with both the plot and the performance of the young actors. It felt mechanically choppy, things are made so for the sake of convenience, the conversation is nowhere near clever nor passionate. The characters are far less attractively developed than 2009's ""Emma"" if compared in the same category as miniseries....and Julian talked too much, it almost felt like he's using his words to make up for the lack of efforts in the movie itself.",1464566400,,471,4.9

7652503,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I really enjoyed the first season of Doctor Thorne. The story line was very entertaining and humorous. It takes place during the mid 1800's in a village in Greshamsbury, England. It's an age old story of how love can be destroyed by money, power, and meddling family members. The acting was very good. Tom Hollander, who I first discovered in Pride and Prejudice,  does a fine job as the kind hearted Doctor Thorne. I  also enjoyed each recap that was given by Julian Fellowes at the end of each episode. My only complaint would be that the season ended too soon and I was left wanting more.",1464566400,,591,4.514018691588785

7652522,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Overall, I liked the episodes, and am grateful for almost any depiction of 19th century mores and costumes.  However, I found some of the dialogue and acting a bit flat.  For instance, I sensed merely warm regard, not an overwhelming passion between the young lovers -- notwithstanding the emotional restraint of the era.

Please don't take this as any indication that I will not watch a second season, however.  I fully expect that the series will get better!",1464480000,,460,4.858974358974359
7652523,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I have to admit that while I viewed a few episodes of Julian Fellowes' Downton Abbey and thought them very well done, I was never roped into the high-class soap opera. But I enjoyed this four-part series of Dr. Thorne, based on Anthony Trollope's novel set in the same era as Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Julian Fellowes introduces and concludes each episode with a cozy fireside chat full of interesting observations. Mike Hale's review in the NYTimes [...] asserts that Julian Fellowes played up his best impression of Alistair Cooke, the British host of PBS Masterpiece Theatre from 1971 to 1992. However, Fellowes' presentations reminded me more of Sir Alfred Hitchcock hosting his TV programs. Listen to the music--the minor melody and use of bassoon often mimic the theme song of Alfred Hitchcock Presents.

It is much better written with much less unrealistic drama demanding to be given your attention whether you want to give it or not.

7652550,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Our story as human beings is like a play that is played by different actors wearing different costumes depending on the period but whose story line is the same. The TV series ""Doctor Thorne"" which is an adaption from a novel, is just that. It is a snapshot of the England Victorian era. I remain convinced that had the original author of that novel come back to life in the beginning of the 21st century and had decided to rewrite that novel, he wouldn't have a lot to change to change in the story (perhaps show some computers on some desks and put some tablets and cell phones in the hands of the characters, better yet show the privileged ones driving in one of our modern luxury cars instead of showing them riding on horse's back and carriages pulled by horses).

Julian Fellowes had used his talent to bring to the screen a story forgotten by so many English historians, ""the story of the customs and habits"" of an era. It is not at all difficult to recognize any human being of any history period through the characters depicted in that story. Lady Arabella doesn't want to lose her life style as an aristocrat and therefore she couldn't care less about her own son's love for the penniless Mary. Lady Arabella want her son to ""marry money"". And she is helped in that endeavor (or should I write 'endeavour') by her sister. Sir Roger Scatcherd's son, Louis, had learned the hard way that this father's fortune can't buy him happiness and most importantly, penniless Mary's love. The main character, Doctor Thorne, strikes us as a balanced and rational being. He recognized the power of money but at the same time is not intimidated by it.

Doctor Thorne is also a story of human betrayals. Case in point: Lady Augusta Gresham (played by Gwyneth Keyworth), one of the two Lady Arabella's daughters, confided in Lady Alexandrina de Courcy (Kate O'flinn) that the family's lawyer, Gatsby, asked to marry her. Using the social stigma attached to any person at that time who made a living by 'working for others', Lady Alexandrina advised Augusta to reject Gatsby's marriage proposal. Turns to find out it was because Lady Alexandrina wanted  the lawyer for herself. The acting is superb, the photography breathtaking and the characters' costumes could not be more pleasing to the eyes. Every episode left the viewer asking for more.

 Doctor Thorne is not just the story of the english Victorian era, it is the timeless story of us in which everybody is in pursuit of money and the one who is lucky enough to put his or her hands on it will rule as king or...queen (in the case of Mary Thorne).

 To Julian Fellowes, I would like to say this: I am thirsty (already) for the next captivating (or should I say 'bewitching') story that you will bring on screen. Be honest with me, should I hold my breath?",1464480000,4,2805,4.620481927710843
7652551,4,B01BHTSIOC,"This 4 episode series was fun to watch! I really hope the show continues!

The writing is DULL, the characters predictable, the story hackneyed -- lacking any hint of irony or wit. And no, Trollope, prolific as he was, is not (to disagree with Fellowes) on par with Dickens or Jane Austin -- he's a poor man's version of both. Pretty dull stuff and the budget didn't include ace scriptwriters or directors who might have whipped the show into something worth watching. Fellowes as writer, producer, head cheese maker is old-fashioned and insipid -- he needs an executive producer who'll tell Fellowes to go hunting and leave the show to a team of clever writers and directors but it's hard to breathe life into a story that's DOA.",1464480000,,1001,4.928994082840236

This is not a Downton replacement, and I know it isn't billed to be, but it is a good enough time for anglophiles like me.",1464480000,,510,4.347368421052631

7652599,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Rather predictable, but fun if you like British chick flicks. The whole dilemma of having to marry for money rather than love is so foreign that it's hard to relate in this modern age.",1464480000,,184,4.4411764705882355

7652602,4,B01BHTSIOC,Very enjoyable.  I was in the mood for a Victorian story.  I am giving it a 4 star because some of the plot and characters were predictable.  I enjoyed the narration before and after by Julian Fellowes.,1464480000,,202,4.405405405405405

7652609,5,B01BHTSIOC,"The sets and costumes were wonderful, and the acting excellent.  The ending featured a mass marriage (three couples) probably not in the original novel, but it was properly Trollopian because one was based on family rivalry, desperation, and  opportunism.  I would have been just as happy without Julian Fellowes to comment, though he presented a comfortable sense of BBC entitlement and pleasure. The characters were only overshadowed by the scenes of the village and interiors of the mansions.  And let me not forget the fabulous Victorian jewelry.",1464480000,,550,5.287356321839081

7652642,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I didn't expect to like this. I had tired of the soapy aspects of Downton Abbey after three seasons. And this seemed, at first, like more of the same:idle rich desperately trying to hold on to their estates. But this had a light-hearted quality and the 44 minute episodes were perfect. We got a chuckle at the set created for Julian Fellowes where he introduced/recapped each episode. It looks to be a ""grand"" room that's about 12 feet wide.",1464480000,,441,4.594936708860759

Yes, this is a different story, and if you really like those corny romantic novels (like my mother used to read back in the 60's) then this is for you.  I watched the first episode and I just found it to be a bit too corny for my taste.  I will perhaps attempt watching episode 2 just to see if it's rating is any better.  The costumes, hairstyles and scenery are all there for a period piece, so I did enjoy that bit.  I feel Julien has set the bar very high with the Downton series so it will be hard to find that same success.  Maybe if the humor in this one was actually funny....I do miss those sassy quips made by Dowager Violet, my favorite character .",1464480000,,699,4.102941176470588

7652765,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Although I had to adjust after 6 seasons of looking at the Downton Abbey estate and nearby village to looking at the various estates and the village in ""Doctor Thorne"", it was a quick and easy adjustment. The Brits write more tightly than the Americans; hence, this spry debut season is accomplished in just 4 episodes. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though we, the viewers, know the truth about Mary Thorne rather early on and wait for how and when the news will be delivered to the others by the morally impeccable Dr. Thorne, who has the best sense of timing of any mini-series character ever! It was delightful to witness the characters maneuver the rules of society while knowing their places--to the good and to the bad--but for those who believe that love triumphs over money and power, ""Doctor Thorne"" will only reaffirm that belief. I wish that season 1 had been more than 4 episodes, simply because I am greedy for interesting drama with well cast actors. Now I wish that a season 2 could follow soon, very soon! For those viewers who love to see the rolling English countryside, the vast country estates, and the lives within, and who want a strong, well written plot line, ""Doctor Thorne"" more than delivers.",1464480000,,1219,4.700934579439252

7652799,2,B01BHTSIOC,"If you loved Trollop's book you'll probably be disappointed in this film adaptation. Fellowes made several changes to the story that take away from Trollop's intent, to discuss the growing obsolescence of the English peerage and the hypocrisy involved in the idea of marrying for wealth. I enjoyed Ian McShane's portrayal of Roger Scatcherd. I thought Tom Hollander and Stefanie Martini were well cast as Dr. Thorne and his niece, Mary. I liked Harry Richardson as Frank Gresham, but I thought he was a bit too conciliatory and eager to please. Mr. Moffat and Sir Louis Scatcherd were both completely miscast as was Squire Gresham. Lady Arabella, her daughters and sister were well-done although the rushed script forced Lady Arabella to look even more hypocritical and narcissistic than she should look. Cutting the election down to bare bones missed some of Trollop's best quips and most amusing moments. Eliminating Frank's horse whipping of Moffatt undermines the strength of Frank's convictions as Trollop wrote him. Making Sir Louis a menacing, dangerously arrogant drunk instead of an absurd, effete arrogant drunk did not improve the story at all for me and undermined Trollop's point about the ridiculous significance wealth plays in increasing status.

Doctor Thorne is a large full-length novel and could have been adapted into a complete and interesting season instead of four truncated episodes. It does not have the lush atmosphere and direction of Downton Abbey. The direction here is stagey, employing a lot of theatrical techniques that are both unnecessary and ineffective when used on film. McShane walking through town and being importuned by all and sundry is one of those moments. Another was the election debates, played as though on a divided stage.",1464393600,7,1773,5.221052631578948

7652836,4,B01BHTSIOC,"While it's not quite as delicious as Downton Abby, this is a very entertaining pot-boiler.  Love Julian Fellowes' commentaries.  A little stilted in places, but it's worth the price of admission just to see the sweeping panoramas of beautiful English estates.  There is a kind of Dickensian feeling about some of the characters, and it's probably a realistic depiction of the British social caste system at that time.",1464393600,,417,5.102941176470588

The early action is oddly choppy and confusing. It's hard to track how much time is passing. A disappointing next chapter after Downton. Oh, and hopefully you like Julian Fellowes, the man, as you are treated to episodes of him pontificating from a drawing room armchair at the beginning AND end of each episode, in old school Masterpiece Theater style.

7653022,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I love the introduction to these episodes, all it's missing is the clich smoking jacket and pipe. Thinking that this would be somewhat like Downton Abbey, really the only similarities are the fact that it takes place in Victorian England.

Some of the acting is outstanding. Without giving away too many spoilers, the lead actress (Stephanie Martini) is headed for big things not just with this but with the television show based off the Wizard of Oz due out this year. The executor does a great job of acting as the protagonist and setting up most of the plot.

Most of the aristocracy are annoying, whining, and a Jane Austen character type way. And the acting of poor Sir Louis Junior is atrocious. You can see every move coming, and it is set up very easy to enjoy over the course of four episodes, how it all comes together has a few twists but nothing serious. I wish that the love interest had been developed a little bit further.

One thing this has done is introduce me to a new author that I may check out this is based on a series of books. Enjoyable and often better than 85% of what's on TV right now. It's just not ""Call the Midwife"" or even ""Mr. Selfridge"". Yet it is a very nice morsel of life during the 1800s in England.",1464393600,,1238,4.373913043478261

We hope he does more of these adaptations. He is a world treasure.",1464393600,,318,4.8

I think Julian Fellowes was a little lazy in character development. It did not have the wit of Downton Abbey but he was working from the original material of Trolloppe.

7653096,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Have only seen three episodes so far, but the plot lingered in the ""ho-hum"" Jane Austen period limbo a bit too long. Middle and upper class women (and men) of this era had little chance at a comfortable life if they did not enjoy ample unearned personal income or marry a wealthy spouse. Thus the hunt begins. But gradually I see the typical Austen plot becoming more subtle and interesting as we begin to view these increasingly complex characters through Trollope's less stylized eye. It's waxing more promising. Am glad I stayed with it and will know more after Episode 4.",1464393600,,575,4.702970297029703

7653155,4,B01BHTSIOC,"If one turns the page on Downton Abbey and views it in the context of a Jane Austen novel, it's quite good! That sounds like faint praise, but some of the actors couldn't quite pull it off, in my opinion. In Downton Abbey, every single one of the actors became the character they played. The other issue with this new one, Mr. Fellowes, is that our American ears cannot catch all the dialogue when the accent is rather strong. Even running the sound high, I wasn't able to understand everything that was said.

I watched all episodes in two evenings, which was nice, though I did wonder if things ""wrapped up"" a bit too quickly at the end.",1464393600,,639,4.415254237288136
7653156,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I watched all four episodes in one sitting, and found the acting, costumes, set design, and direction all top-notch, which is to be expected from studios who have mastered those arts.  The story was a sweet romance, if not exactly ground-breaking.  However, Julian Fellowes does little monologues at the beginning and end of each episode and, no matter how much he tried to insist that the characters were complex and multi-faceted, I had to respectfully disagree.  Perhaps in the original source material, which I have not read, but in this adaptation the ""good"" characters are readily apparent and the ""bad"" characters border on cartoonish.  But, hey...sometimes that's just what you want to watch on a lazy Sunday.  The only stand-out performances were those of Tom Hollander as Dr. Thorne, and the character of Louis Phillipe who, while definitely a ""villain"", was probably the most complex one in the whole series.",1464393600,,919,5.1

7653163,2,B01BHTSIOC,"I was hopeful for this mini-series based on the trailer, but several things I found frustrating to the point that I don't know that I would watch another such Julian Fellows/Amazon mini-series unless they modified some things.
1. This must have been made on a pretty low budget. I know we're all spoiled with Masterpiece Theatre and BBC period dramas, but... Where were the extras? Many scenes felt sparse. The show definitely had a feel of being on a set.
2. The only strong character in my opinion was Dr. Thorne. Where did they get the rest of the actors/actresses? Out of theatre school? They came across very amateurish and unable to really grasp and portray the depth of their characters, especially Mary, who looked and acted very modern and had a strange way of expressing herself that made me wonder at times if she was an American doing a British English accent. She came across almost sickeningly sweet.
3. What was up with all the drone shots? They felt like drone shots. Maybe they strapped a cam to a Amazon Prime drone and delivered packages at the estates?
4.  The filters or post-processing done on the scenes with many of the women had too much of that ""softened"" effect. One camera would be sharply focused on a male and the next camera on the female is all fuzzy and ""romantic"" looking. Did not like that.
5. Strange camera angles on Julian Fellowes at times. Under his jaw? Odd. I think the intro would have been sufficient, but not two chats with Fellowes. His personality isn't particularly charming.
6. Wasn't sucked into this like Downton Abbey. Story/plot just to blase. And I LOVED Anthony Trollope's ""The Way We Live Now"" with David Suchet. That has a marvelous plot and fantastic acting. If you want a real flavor for a Trollope-set-to-film, try that one.",1464393600,3,1784,4.699680511182109

7653198,4,B01BHTSIOC,I do so love a good English love story. This was great with some twist and turns.  It is light and airy but lovely as well. I believe most will enjoy it . Give it a try. Thank you for making it available.,1464393600,,204,3.744186046511628

7653201,4,B01BHTSIOC,"It's a trifle, but lovely to look at and reasonably engaging over its three hours even though the plot was nothing we haven't seen before. The romantic leads didn't have a ton of chemistry, but were both quite pretty; Stefanie Martini is a beauty. Some of the side characters were a little over-the-top but I loved Tom Hollander as the title character.",1464393600,,352,4.693548387096774
7653202,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Entertaining storyline, but predicatable. It is well worth the watch just for the landscape, villages, mansions, and gardens. The costumes are wonderful!",1464393600,,153,6.0
7653203,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Loved this short series. I do like Julian Fellowes. I had hoped that this would have been a few more episodes to round out the characters.  I hope that he does more for Amazon Prime. I was glad to see Rebecca Front from Inspector Lewis and Alex Price from Father Brown. I really do like the British shows. I just finished watching Inspector Morse.
I miss Downton Abbey but I look forward to seeing these actors in other roles.",1464393600,,426,4.3924050632911396

7653214,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Fun to watch, but predictable.",1464393600,,30,5.2
7653215,4,B01BHTSIOC,Follows in the steps of Downton Abbey but in an earlier era.  Thoroughly enjoyed the series (binge watched all four episodes).  Only comment of a mindly negative nature was that some of the characters seemed exaggerated probably due to a shorter time for character development compared to the subtle changes over time in Downton Abbey.  That small complaint is largely offset by the beautiful outdoor backdrops that Fellowes manages to incorporate into his scenes.  This was called Season 1 but really had a satisfactory conclusion.  I'll be interested to see what happens in a Season 2.,1464393600,,587,5.072916666666667
7653216,5,B01BHTSIOC,Great show and a good follow to Downton Abbey.  Not as well developed as DA but well done as Julian does.  Wish it went on a few more episodes.,1464393600,,143,3.896551724137931

7653223,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Watches more like a guilty pleasure during the post-Downton hangover. It's like a cartoon version of an actual period drama. Whoever had the idea to give Julian Fellows so much screen time is off-track at best. It would be nice for Mr. Fellows to introduce the series, but an intro and recap of every episode is excessive. It feels like I'm getting an unwanted lecture from a cranky uncle during Mr. Fellows little chat sessions. In the end, it's enjoyable, but I'm sort of ashamed that I like it.",1464393600,,497,4.595505617977528

7653235,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Clearly well done, wonderfully accurate costumes, appropriate attention to details etc. It lacked something in the actual plot line, or perhaps the story as a whole.  I can see why the story/novel is not widely known although it has something of Austen-type issues as she liked to write about, it doesn't quite capture the innocent love and class distinction as Sense and Sensibility or Pride and Prejudice did.  Still worth a watch if you're into Victorian period dramas. I would watch it again.",1464393600,,496,4.963855421686747

7653240,1,B01BHTSIOC,"Am a total british period drama fan but this was unwatchable. I couldn't even get thru the first ep.  I felt like these were modern day actors playing dressup...I was not transported to that time and place esp bc of the hyped cinematography. The screen writing/acting was quite awful esp when Trollop's novels are excellent reads.  Ur better off watching Poldark for glorious cinematography, excellent writing and acting.",1464393600,,421,5.176470588235294
7653241,5,B01BHTSIOC,"We had to watch episode one twice to get it straight who was related to whom, who hated whom, who liked whom etc. And I am so glad we took the time to do so. because now we are hooked. Having Julian Fellows introduce and then wrap up each episode is brilliant. He channels Hitchcock in both appearance and delivery and is quite funny.",1464393600,,334,4.234375

7653263,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I am quite an Anglophyle and, while I did not like Doctor Thorne as well as, say, BBC's production of Pride & Prejudice, I did like it very much. The writing and performances (especially Tom Hollander) were excellent, as were the locations and costumes. This is from one of Trollope's novels I have not read, therefore I was unable to compare the series with the novel. All in all, I found the series very entertaining, and I binge watched it as soon as my husband left for the day so I could enjoy it uninterrupted. Bravo to Julian Fellowes (shades of Alistair Cooke) and bravo to Amazon for producing this fine series. Now, please do more in this vein.",1464393600,,654,4.504201680672269

7653312,3,B01BHTSIOC,"A little slow to develop characters.  The story should tell itself without Mr. Fellows narration before and after, in my mind.  Lovely sets and costuming.  Given time, it could probably build.",1464393600,,192,5.129032258064516

7653314,4,B01BHTSIOC,The story is everything a Jane Austen or Downton Abbey fan could want.  Only Julian Fellowes intros and outros were a bit much.  Spoiler Alert:  Happy Endings!,1464393600,,159,4.814814814814815

7653317,4,B01BHTSIOC,I like this kind of story..so they'd have to mess up pretty bad to make me not like it. The main bad guy who starts it all running seems pretty predictable so will see how it goes. Hopefully he'll surprise me.,1464393600,,209,4.121951219512195
7653318,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Obviously, Julian Fellowes has a knack for developing good stories from England's stuffy past, when class and good manners were viewed in high regard. Doctor Thorne from Trollope's novel lends itself to the skillful manipulations of someone like Fellowes, and follows quite nicely to Downton Abby. I look forward to the next production by this very talented script writer.",1464393600,,372,5.322033898305085
7653319,4,B01BHTSIOC,"A little predictable, but I love regency era shows! This did not disappoint! Great story, great cast, great acting....all very well done.

7653377,5,B01BHTSIOC,I really liked this and enjoyed Julian Fellowes presenting it like in the very old Masterpiece days with the wonderful host who is no longer with us. It isn't as good as Downton Abbey but that's a high bar to reach. I'm very glad Amazon acquired or fathered this series.,1464393600,,270,4.42
7653378,1,B01BHTSIOC,It wasn't anything close to Downton Abbey. It was supposed to be witty and it just seemed derivative and uninteresting.,1464393600,,119,5.0

7653427,3,B01BHTSIOC,I would have given it at least one more star if Julian Fellows had NOT been in the series.  His being at the beginning and the end of each segment was annoying and he seemed to be there simply for his seeking his own glory.,1464393600,,223,3.9555555555555557

The arc of the storyline was tedious and predictable and the characters were implausible to the point of cariacature.

7653438,3,B01BHTSIOC,"The drama is only minimally engaging partly because the characters are drawn in a mostly stereotypical manner.  So far I have only seen two episodes, so I may still change my mind if the drama improves.  So far, only Mary has taken hold of my empathy.",1464393600,,251,4.434782608695652

7653444,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This series wasn't quite as captivating as ""Downton Abbey"", but very enjoyable to watch.  Perhaps, if the series continues, the acting and details to settings, costumes, etc. will become even better.  Julian's introductions are entertaining and help the viewer obtain the proper perspective.  Keep up the good work, Julian!",1464393600,,323,5.551020408163265

7653459,5,B01BHTSIOC,Julian Fellowes is the premier writer of British period drama for movies and television. A true gift for our generation.,1464393600,,120,5.05
7653460,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I enjoyed this little mini-series. I did get tired of Julian Fellowes doing his before and show explanations of what the story is about, etc. Maybe before each show, it was helpful, but then after the show he came back on! That is too much. It is completely unnecessary to tell us what just occurred, and explain the human issue side of the story.
The show is based on an Anthony Trollope book. As long as you venture into this program with the idea that is a show based on book, much like Jane Austen, I think you will enjoy it too.",1464393600,,533,4.235294117647059

7653462,5,B01BHTSIOC,"As always Julian Fellowes delivers again!!  Marvelous scripts, actors and locations!  If you are a fan of Gosford Park, and of course Downton Abbey, you will love this series!!  He is an extraordinary writer (and least we forget actor - who didn't love him as Kilwille).  Please Mr. Fellowes keep them coming!!",1464393600,,310,4.903846153846154
7653463,4,B01BHTSIOC,Tom Hollander does a great job of making you fall in love with him. I wished the series was longer so I could see him and the American's story unfold.,1464393600,,150,4.033333333333333
7653464,3,B01BHTSIOC,"So,so....The story was a good old tale - one of privilege versus wealth with a twist reversal of fortunes.  However, I found the characters flat and uninteresting.",1464393600,,163,5.037037037037037

7653467,5,B01BHTSIOC,Well done as usual.,1464393600,,19,4.0
7653468,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I so love Julian Fellowes, and his beloved Downton Abbey that I felt, if only for a moment,  I could return to those memories it would be wonderful.
My mistake, Doctor Thorne is not, and, nor should it be, compared to Fellowes previous Masterpiece. As a short series, it is rich in scenery, costumes, and the mannerisms of the titled and the rich working class. Beyond that, I found nothing of great interest in either the plot or the acting - save a few. Tom Hollander as Dr. Thorne was a wonderfully sympathetic, and gentle man. Ian McShane as Sir Roger is the crotchety old man, who founds his soul before passing. My only complaint with him is that he wasn't on long enough. The younger cast members are all attractive and, do their best.
All in all it's viewable, but leave Downton in the past, where, sadly, it now belongs.",1464393600,,829,4.490066225165563

7653480,3,B01BHTSIOC,Most first episodes require some patience.  I hope that the series becomes more engaging - the characters were facile.  That quality may be a product of Trollope's point of view. I may not like it.,1464393600,,197,4.6

7653487,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Wonderfully cast, excellent ending. How Julian Fellowes wrapped this up so neatly in four episodes is a marvel. Production is exquisite. You'll want much, much more of Dr. Thorne. His dance with the American heiress in the last episode leads you to wonder if there is romance in his future. The doctor's skill at treading the tightrope of secrets to the glorious end of this story is worth watching. His role is masterfully played.",1464393600,,431,4.837837837837838

Anyway, it's better than the crap we have to watch on TV most nights, no crazed murderers or psychopaths.

7653561,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Great story, well packaged.  Limited to four episodes gives the viewer the options of spreading it over four nights; dividing it into two for teo movie length sessions; or binging all four because you are facinated by the story and its charascters.  Fellows has provided a package that has [hopefully] kept it from becoming the soap opera that is/was Downton Abbey.",1464393600,,365,4.967213114754099
7653562,2,B01BHTSIOC,"The story line was too obvious, not much mystery. /The characters were overdrawn. We didn't have much interest in what happens to them.",1464393600,,135,4.913043478260869

7653570,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This is another Julian Fellowes production based on the novel ""Dr. Thorne"" by Anthony Trollope,  and it was everything that I anticipated a Julian Fellowes production would be: characters whose lives are intertwined with love and angst, beautiful period costumes and setting, and a tale ingeniously woven to fit into a movie/TV period of time.  Because there were only 5 episodes in this series, the storyline moved quickly and the resolution of the problems occurred almost too conveniently.",1464393600,,492,5.294871794871795

By the end of the season, I didn't particularly care what happened to most of them.  I also thought the way it all wrapped up was just too simplistic and predictable.  Life is nowhere near that neat and tidy, and it was a little insulting to one's intelligence to have it come together so fairytale-like.",1464307200,,420,4.56

7653738,2,B01BHTSIOC,"This series based on a melodramatic story, and rendered in an overly sentimental style, with ridiculous circumstances and lucky coincidences, is topped by a swollen-headed and superficial narration by Julian Fellowes.

A few decent actors do their best to try and lend importance to this drivel, but its cartoonish, 1-dimensional characters seem like they came from a child's concept of how characters should be: a saintly and beautiful girl, a dashing and loyal suitor, an evil stepmother, kindly father figures, a drunken mess of a hateful villain, the villain's croney sidekick, and an old crone, etc, etc.  The ""good"" characters are not materialistic, and love and sacrifice truly.  The ""bad"" ones are selfish, grotesque, rude, and greedy.  There are no penetrating, multidimensional characters as Fellowes would like us to believe.  A person feeling a moment of regret does NOT a multi-dimensional character make - especially a last gasp at humanity on their deathbed -- talk about contrivances!

The ""well-bred"" and high born characters in the story behave like commoners, whereas the lower-birth doctor and his illegitimate ""niece"" are their superiors in both manners and grace?  Highly unlikely!  A titled son and heir-apparent of a large estate dating back many generations, then risks squandering every birthright for a chance at uniting with a ""bastard"" girl and a life with no prospects other than common work, such as trade or some other ""lowly"" job (the same work that we know has been despised by titled aristocracy since time immemorial), knowing that his family would also be turned out forever as a result? Again, improbable.  Improbable too that he would grow up to have a heart of gold and not care about any of the trappings of his day and age, and even go so far as to declare that he hates money.  Haha, you have to laugh.  It only works in Cinderella cartoons, outside of animation it just makes you laugh.

The actress in the lead role did her best, I can't fault her, nor the doctor.  Then we meet either these selfish women, or else look up to an angelic, faultless martyred female character.  The villain was so ridiculously portrayed, he might as well have twirled a mustache around his fingers as he spoke, drank and spewed (the expected) poisonous words endlessly.  The day is saved by a trite and forced Deus ex machina obvious plot device, which is actually revealed very early on and is alluded to throughout (as what will save the day).  Need I say more?! There's a reason why we've never heard of this author, because this novel, and I suspect much of his work, is feeble and wallops one over the head with its clunky, hackneyed devices and cardboard characters.  Then afterwards, Fellowes sounds like a fool summarizing each episode; I felt embarrassed for him.  Overall, a disaster!  Well, at least the costumes were interesting to examine, as well as the sets.",1464307200,3,2899,4.92798353909465

7653802,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I found Doctor Thorne to be very enjoyable. It was well done, good story, beautiful settings and great performances. I hope Julian Fellowes does more of these.  His commentary added a great deal to my enjoyment of the episodes.",1464307200,,227,4.82051282051282

7653810,3,B01BHTSIOC,It was good but it wasn't awesome. It didn't have that wow factor. I believe Downton Abby has spoiled us.,1464307200,,105,4.3
7653811,5,B01BHTSIOC,My wife enjoyed this movie immensely. It was very similar to some of the Jane Austen pieces she watches.,1464307200,,104,4.526315789473684

7653830,5,B01BHTSIOC,Loved it,1464307200,,8,3.5
7653831,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Not up to Downton standards. Looks great, as one might expect from Fellowes, but the plot depends upon two major characters dying off, and of course they do in a most predictable manner. Moderately entertaining.",1464307200,,211,5.057142857142857
7653832,2,B01BHTSIOC,"We started to watch this based on Julian Fellowes wonderful work on Downton Abbey. Not knowing the story ahead of time, the large cast of characters became so confusing that we gave up. I may try again after studying the characters on another source.",1464307200,,250,4.704545454545454

7653835,3,B01BHTSIOC,"This was a nice period piece, but definitely not as engaging as Downton Abbey. None of the characters were particularly exciting to the point where you could not wait to see what happens next.",1464307200,,192,4.676470588235294

7653837,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Excellent show...we need more mini series like this.....shows that run on for years are not the way to go...quick hitting, entertaining and with a known closing timeline....love it",1464307200,,180,5.464285714285714
7653838,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I really enjoyed this, it was a sweet story!
But I was SO incredibly disappointed with the quality of the hair and makeup and the costumes on this production! I've been spoiled by the golden touch the Brits seem to have when it comes to getting things historically accurate...it's surprising to see something with Julian Fellowes name on it be so sloppy. There were times when Stefanie Martini's hair was so horribly '21st century' I was apalled that they let that slide! No LADY of that time would have been seen outside of her bedchamber with such un-coiffed hair under her bonnet. After Julian Fellowes went to such crazy lengths to be historically accurate in every little detail with Downton Abby...why wouldn't he at least make sure they had a decent hairdresser on set?",1464307200,,776,4.798507462686567
7653839,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Julian Fellowes does it again, giving us another beautiful period drama. The costumes and sets are magnificent.",1464307200,,111,5.588235294117647
7653840,5,B01BHTSIOC,Absolutely wonderful !,1464307200,,22,6.666666666666667
7653841,4,B01BHTSIOC,We watched all four in one sitting and thoroughly enjoyed it.,1464307200,,61,4.636363636363637
7653842,5,B01BHTSIOC,I think Anthony Trollope would have approved.,1464307200,,45,5.571428571428571
7653843,5,B01BHTSIOC,What a wonderful story- especially with Julien Fellowes droll introduction to each episode. The cinematography was so lush I was transported into Victorian England!  Loved it!,1464307200,,175,5.730769230769231
7653844,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Great story, enjoyed it very much.",1464307200,,34,4.833333333333333

7653847,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Loved this and would have loved if it was 20 episodes longer... I was amazed at the development of the story in just 4 episodes!!! More, more, more!",1464307200,,148,4.321428571428571
7653848,3,B01BHTSIOC,Doesn't hold a candle to Downton Abby. However story is interesting and it's decently acted.  This refers to 1st episode which is only one i've watched so far. . Worth seeing how the plot thickens,1464307200,,196,4.6
7653849,5,B01BHTSIOC,Loved this production!  Would watch it again and again!,1464307200,,55,5.111111111111111

7653855,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I enjoyed Doctor Thorne, especially being able to watch all four in an afternoon.  It probably would have received 5 stars but the story wasn't quite as strong in comparison to Downton Abbey and the several of the PBS productions of Jane Austin tales.  I encourage Amazon to undertake more of these quality, classic story-lines.",1464307200,,328,4.945454545454545
7653856,3,B01BHTSIOC,Not nearly as well done nor was the acting close to Downton Abbey.,1464307200,,66,4.153846153846154
7653857,5,B01BHTSIOC,Great story about the pursuit of money vs the pursuit of love,1464307200,,61,4.166666666666667

7653871,4,B01BHTSIOC,Doctor Thorne was an interesting drama in the same vein as Downtown Abby. The costumes were wonderful and the sets were lovely. The dialogue was hard to understand at times.,1464307200,,173,4.8
7653872,3,B01BHTSIOC,A little boring.,1464307200,,16,4.666666666666667
7653873,5,B01BHTSIOC,I loved it. I wish you would offer more shows like this.,1464307200,,56,3.75
7653874,1,B01BHTSIOC,I found the plot to be very confusing. I only watched Episode 1 and part of Episode 2. Also the quality of the video was very poor. It looked grainy and slightly blurry.,1464307200,,169,4.151515151515151

7653877,3,B01BHTSIOC,It seemed hokey after Poldark.  It was just too pretty and predictable.,1464307200,,71,4.916666666666667
7653878,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Not right up there with Dowton, but great story and one of the few times that I watch this genre.  I put Upstairs Downstairs on the same playing field as Dowton.  I did feel there is room for at least one sequel to Thorne to get everybody else straightened out...  Too much emphasis I think, even for the times on ""all about money"".  This one kind of mixed up the money vs. class thing.  In the other series that I mentioned, you wouldn't necessarily get the guy on the top floor if you are on the bottom just because you were willed a boatload of money.  Class structure was more important.....",1464307200,,595,4.315315315315315

7653886,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I loved the sweet and compelling story, and it ended with a smile on my face. The acting had me giggling at times, but overall it was a great watch.

7653897,4,B01BHTSIOC,I love a good 19th century/early 20th century centered movie. The plot is easygoing with subtle drama compared to what people are used to nowadays. It's a great movie to watch at the end of a long day. These kind of movies make me relax.,1464307200,,237,4.288888888888889
7653898,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Good and not a big time commitment. If you miss Downton, this might be a nice filler.",1464307200,,85,4.0588235294117645

7653919,5,B01BHTSIOC,Loved the show and Tom Hollander is great!,1464307200,,42,4.375
7653920,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Perhaps my expectations were too high but Dr. Thorne was a bust for me. The production values were glittery but other aspects were lacking or just wrong. Having Julian Fellowes do an Alistair Cook-type commentary between the episodes boded ill at the beginning but the biggest mistake was casting Tom Hollander as the virtuous Dr. Thorne. He is a wonderful actor but not in this role. Maybe I have seen him too often with that mischievous, up-to-no-good twinkle in his eye but it was impossible for me to buy him for a minute as the kindly, heart-of-gold doctor. Fellowes claim that Trollope is on par with Dickens and did he say Thackeray or Austen did not bear out in the story he chose to present. Predictable, pat and far too many coincidences. The actors did their best and performed abley given the material. The one exception would be the woman playing the part of the niece. She seemed out of her depth with little smiles at inappropriate times, just not the person to carry such a pivotal role. I truly wasn't expecting Downton Abbey but was sorely disappointed that anyone thought this would please that audience as a follow-up.",1464307200,,1138,4.723618090452261

7653926,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Julian Fellowes, the charmer Killwillie from Dalton Abbey, is the host introducing each episode of this new Series which he adapted from an 1858 book by Anthony Trollope.  The plot centers around a Mother who goes to great length to be sure her son will marry into wealth even though he has already fallen. for Mary who is anything but wealthy.  The plot has all the Victorian Elements, Secret family histories, finding your way into the upper classes, dressing the parts.

It's written in a similar fashion and the movies are visually similar as well.  I absolutely loved it. I only hope there is more to come from Julian Fellowes. I'm not really sure why they are promoting this as anything even remotely close to Downton Abbey because they are nothing alike. Both are fantastic in their own way.",1464307200,,443,4.740259740259741

7653963,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I was rather disappointed -it was quite boring and bland.  Love Tom Hollander, though. All other actors are doing a fine job as well, but there isn't enough drama, action, and the dialogs lack energy.
This series came out too soon after DA ended which set the plank quite high.",1464307200,,277,4.54
7653964,4,B01BHTSIOC,Wonderful little mini series. If you like Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre you will like Dr. Throne. While script is slightly weak and casting of Louie was an odd choice the overall show was enjoyable to watch and I would watch it again.,1464307200,,238,4.431818181818182

7653972,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Nicely done, sumptuous production, but the story is unsurprising and the characters strike white keys only. The depiction of the drunk old lord and his alcoholic son is excruciating. Drunks do not have to stagger and shout and swig from a glass or flask every 15 seconds.",1464307200,,271,4.787234042553192

7653975,2,B01BHTSIOC,It was really hard to get through the first half of the first episode.  It was like a theater production done in the 70s.  The acting was not believable.  And the story line was tedious.,1464307200,,186,4.257142857142857

7654004,4,B01BHTSIOC,"As a genuine member of the English landed gentry, Fellowes is perfectly and articulately well qualified both to review and to critique its past periods of splendor and increasing decline. Who better these days, given his splendid ""Downton Abbey"" masterpiece? Yes, resoundingly another triumph, as he depicts the inevitable struggles of the over-staffed and over-spent rich, while the merit-driven middle-class increasingly make their presence felt.

Not to mention the inspiration of seeing the young heroine making decisions which she believes are right, even if they do not make her happy. You don't see that often.
Actress Phoebe Nicholls is making a bit of a career playing highly unlikeable women in Julian Fellowes productions. Really enjoyed her villainy in Downton Abbey, and now in this as the scheming Countess de Courcy.

7654047,3,B01BHTSIOC,Not as clever or as well acted as Downton Abbey,1464307200,,47,3.8
7654048,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Very well done. Trollope is early Victorian so the storytelling is of that era. It's worth watching the episodes just to see the grand country estates where most of the action takes place. Also, the cast is superb. Some of my favorite Brit actors are in it.",1464307200,,257,4.48936170212766

7654063,4,B01BHTSIOC,"This was a charming period piece with well drawn characters, well acted that works well on many levels.  It was, however, NOT Downton Abbey.  It did highlight many of the universal hipocrasies of our society, then and now.  Love, jealousy, social climbing are always good, particularly when packaged in such lovely surroundings.",1464307200,,328,5.269230769230769

7654072,5,B01BHTSIOC,I LOVE these period pieces from Julian Fellows. Nobody is all good and nobody is all bad as this series points out. Loved it.,1464307200,,125,4.25
7654073,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I liked it. It takes time to get to know the characters. I wasn't wild about Downton Abbey at first either. But I liked it well enough to continue to watch. Then I found myself ""hooked""!I think Doctor Thorne will ultimately follow suit.",1464307200,,236,4.511627906976744

7654075,5,B01BHTSIOC,I love the 19th century drama with the nobility and commanders; how the parents try to come between the love of those from different rank. Jonathon Fellows does a great job.,1464307200,,173,4.612903225806452

7654079,3,B01BHTSIOC,"The settings and costumes are beautiful, and the actors' performances are good, they are all just a bit one dimensional, and the story after a fairly leisurely progression, suddenly seems in a hurry to wrap things up at the end, which makes the pacing feel somewhat uneven. I would probably give it 3.5 stars if I could. I liked it, but this is probably not a mini series I'd find myself opting for another viewing.",1464307200,,415,4.546666666666667

7654083,5,B01BHTSIOC,"My wife and I watched Doctor Thorne following an Amazon Prime email advertisement.  We watch no television, British period pieces being the only exception.

We had not previously heard of Doctor Thorne and weren't sure what to expect, but were very pleasantly surprised.  It was most enjoyable and from the advertisement, we thought there might a season; unfortunately, that is not the case.  If you are an anglophile and enjoy period pieces, you will enjoy this production.",1464307200,,474,5.116883116883117

that Julian Fellowes will do the piece justice.",1464307200,,189,4.9375
7654086,5,B01BHTSIOC,I just loved the series.  I didn't want it to end.  It was probably a date flick or most men would say that anyway.,1464307200,,115,3.75

7654092,2,B01BHTSIOC,"I wish that Amazon would invest its money in productions done in the USA where at least the actor/actress characters could be understood, and the sound levels would significantly better. Come on, boys, let's come back to the USA!",1464307200,,229,4.897435897435898

7654094,3,B01BHTSIOC,Fun and short diversion. Could do without Mr. Fellows' commentary.,1464307200,,66,5.7
7654095,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Highly enjoyable period costume drama (originally written by a member of the British postal service) about love, honor and overcoming tragedy. Done with humor and grace, this adaptation by Mr. Fellowes is well worth your time, as it is a miniseries done in 4 episodes. ANYTHING Julian does, from Monarch of the Glen to Downton Abbey is highly creative.  I loved his introductions. He is such a fantastic creator; on this production he is the screenwriter and host ala Alastair Cooke.)",1464307200,,484,4.9753086419753085

7654100,1,B01BHTSIOC,Just not in the same league as Downton Abbey. Poorly acted and shallow storyline. The narrative remined me of Alfred Hitchcock when he would introduce his movies - too narcissistic for my taste and eventually I just fast forwarded through it,1464307200,2,241,4.902439024390244

7654118,4,B01BHTSIOC,Julian Fellowes has done a terrific job bringing Trollope's tale to life in this entertaining four parter. Looking forward to more of The Barchester Chronicles if he's game.,1464307200,,173,5.214285714285714

7654130,4,B01BHTSIOC,I hope there will be another season.  I would have liked for this one to have been a longer season.  I felt like I was just getting to now the characters and it ended.  It felt more like a mini series with nothing else to come afterwards.,1464307200,,238,4.0212765957446805

7654261,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I loved this movie, but I have to caveat that I have been wanting to see a decent, period, romance film since Jane Austen's most recent adaptation movie. These types of movies are few and far between. My grandmother always said, ""Hunger makes a good sauce.""  I would admit that I enjoyed this movie much more having been ""starved"" for this genre in recent years. May have been less enamored if I had been to the theater to see the likes of ""Pride and Prejudice"" last week.  All in all, I would recommend watching it!

Julian Fellowes introductions alone are worth a watch- fun- reminiscent of bygone styles of hosting...
The acting (well ALMOST all of the acting) is dandy, the writing enjoyable. Sets and costumes are wonderful. I love Tom Hollander, and the rest of the cast (well ALMOST all of the rest of the cast) were up to his standard.

7654275,5,B01BHTSIOC,I love English dramas. It's like being in England.  This is a rendition of one of the oldest novels ever. It's a kind of fairy tale where the good are rewarded and the misguided get their comeuppances.  Young people might need a disclaimer: the fairy tale may be true as metaphor but the kind of justice portrayed in this series may take a life time or they may never see it. For the young--don't count on your life being like this tale.  Few people rarely are the secret children of surprising parents and almost no one is as smart and good-looking and good as the protagonists.  We old ones enjoy the fantasy.,1464307200,,611,4.428571428571429

7654302,5,B01BHTSIOC,Great for fans of Downton Abbey.  I still can't believe one conniving minor character in particular  and their subsequent episode of  partner poaching! I can't be more specific without creating a spoiler alert-- so finger to lips. Just watch and enjoy.  The young heroine is particularly appealing and the actor who plays Dr Thorne a real mensch- even if that word might not have been known to author Trollope!,1464307200,,410,4.898550724637682

Luckily for me, I watched the first episode again, and by the end of the second episode, I was hooked. Now I just try to pace myself. Having Julian Fellowes introduce and debrief each episode makes it even more appealing and charming. The cast seems unremarkable and not nearly as glamorous or diverse as Downton Abbey, but they seem well suited to their roles which in themselves are of a unique nature. To sum it up: consider me a big fan of Doctor Thorne in particular and Julian Fellowes in general. Fans of Downton Abbey must realize that Doctor Thorne is a very different story.",1464307200,,681,4.544715447154472

7654396,3,B01BHTSIOC,"It was enjoyable but entirely predictable. In one aside from Julian Fellowes direct to the audience, Fellowes says that none of Trolloppe' characters are entirely good or entirely bad. If that's true, I found it to be a dimension poorly represented in this adaptation: Sir Louis, Lady Arabella, Alexandrina, & several others are completely one-dimensional; they could each be summed up with one strong adjective. It kept my attention, but I wouldn't bother watching it again. It has none of the twist & subtle plot points that Downton Abbey led me to expect of Fellowes. After looking forward to Dr. Thorne with interest, I'd say I'm moderately underwhelmed.",1464307200,,658,5.101851851851852

7654461,4,B01BHTSIOC,"It was satisfying, but predictable. Acting was not as good as in Downtown Abbey, and since it was only 4 episodes, the characters were not as well developed. The plot was likable overall, and of course we didn't know how the snooty people would receive their comeuppance, but the ending was nice.

7654463,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Much like Masterpiece Theater of old, Julian Fellows opens and closes this production with words about the story from the comfort of a cozy chair. The nostalgia of it all just tickled me pink. Really, it just did.

Gorgeous film with lush acting and a clever story, eye candy every where. Dresses and dramatic floral hair decor. I hope to see more stories by this author brought to film soon. I just love seeing Tom Hollander in anything witty.",1464307200,,444,4.620253164556962

7654474,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I enjoyed the story and the introduction by Jullien Fellowes was wonderful.  The production was done on a budget, so it was noticeably different from Downton Abbey.

7654484,4,B01BHTSIOC,"It's a pleasant enough translation although I would have liked to have seen more characterization and rounding of the motivations. Having a love triangle is fine but the addition of the third suitor with Louie was rather sudden and jarring. I couldn't understand what his motivation was especially for falling in love with Mary Thorne except she was there and it was convenient. Although in screen writing for novels, much gets lost in the translation from the page to television.",1464307200,,480,5.0125

7654511,2,B01BHTSIOC,"I feel like Julian Fellowes is a one-trick pony.  If you like that trick, here is yet another one. It's about people marrying for status and/or money in Victorian England. It took me forever to actually stay awake enough to get through the first episode. After falling asleep 2 or 3 nights in a row, I finally got through the whole thing by watching it during the day. Everybody does the best they can with familiar themes and material.  You can pretty much guess how it will all turn out from the first episode (if you can stay awake, that is.)  Particularly annoying is that Julian Fellowes taped little Masterpiece Theater type intros and outros for each episode.  He is no Laura Linney (or Alan Cumming!) that's for sure.  This feels like a bloated vanity project to me.  I'd rather watch the first season of Downton Abbey over again.  Just the first season, though.

7654516,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Really enjoyed Season 1.  Will there be a Season 2?  That question was not answered.  If you loved Downton Abbey, you will love Doctor Thorne.  In Doctor Thorne another Mary is a central character.  This Mary is played to perfection by a delightful Stephanie Martini.  Her Mary is an absolute angel, but with a questionable birth.  She is Doctor Thorne's niece and thus part of the working class.  She loves Frank, part of the gentry upperclass, but he has parents who have squandered their financial position and his mother bans Mary from their estate in hopes Frank will marry someone with money.  Frank is hopelessly in love with Mary, but is still torn about helping his parents out of their financial mess.  Will Frank marry Mary or will he marry money?  The ending is a hoot, except for poor tipsy Louis.  You see, poor drunken, rich Louis is also in love with Mary, but Mary is not in love with Louis.  She loves Frank, but is convinced by Frank's conniving mother to drop Frank so he will be free to marry money.  Mary's uncle, wonderfully played by Tom Hollander, knows some secrets and plays a key roll in steering all players to the hoot of an ending.  Outstanding performances all around with a fun cast!",1464307200,,1216,4.590697674418605

7654548,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Julian Fellowes is a genius!  Doctor Thorne is a thoroughly enjoyable story.  Although not at all like Downton Abby in language and acting, I suspect that Fellowes tried to bring out the characteristics he found in the novel he adapted. The combination of familiar faces (from BBC productions) and new talent was perfectly done. I was in the middle of the first video when I realized that the adaptation was not being overacted, but simply following the style Fellows intended.",1464307200,,477,4.95

7654555,4,B01BHTSIOC,"True to his taste for all things Victorian, Julian Fellowes has again given us a wonderful screen work. Characters were fleshed out, costumes were gorgeous,the story line was luscious apparently true to the novel by Anthony Trollope. It was much shorter in length than most of Fellowe's dramas only, I believe, four episodes. The whole movie went by too fast. I loved every minute of it.",1464307200,,387,4.878787878787879

The story had everything I love, gorgeous scenery, stunning, sweet heroine, wicked villain, breathtaking costumes, decent characters and a good storyline.  It helped a lot that Julian introduced each episode.  It helped me understand and appreciate the story and the storytelling so much more.  I watched Episode One about 9:00 one night and stayed up until 12:30 to watch all four episodes.  I couldn't stand to wait to find out what happened.  I'm not familiar with Anthony Trollope's writing, so it was wonderful to have it explained.  It's not Dickens or Austen.  I'm so happy I heard that Julian Fellowes had written another series.

Having never read anything by Anthony Trollope, I can't say whether Fellowes banalized the story line or whether Trollope achieved this on his own.  There is very little sparkle to the plot whose resolution is telegraphed early in the series.  Nonetheless, the costumes and settings are handsome indeed.  And the British actors (none known previously by me) are uniformly good within the confines of the stilted dialogue and plot.  If you are already a Prime member, give it a look.

Let's hope Fellowes will go on to do the author's even finer works in the series:  The Warden, Barchester Towers, and The Last Chronicle of Barset!

I was more of a distraction than an enhancement to the series. Also, in this day and age of binge watching, Jullian's summary at the beginning AND end of each episode was unnecessary and almost seemed like filler to stretch the series into 4 episodes.

7654731,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Julian Fellowes is a welcome narrator for all of us who miss Alistaire Cooke and I appreciate his enthusiam for Trollope's book.  I hope Fellowes will introduce many Masterpiece Theatre series in the future.  Trollope has his fans, but for me, Jane Austen is a much more insightful, honest story-teller.  Many of her heroines are complex, seemingly real people--they have their faults, which makes them appealing.  Trollope's heroine in this series is a bit too saccharine for my taste.  The plot was predictable, the good people were too good.  Maybe the bad people weren't all bad.  But that doesn't make this story truly compelling.",1464307200,,635,5.048076923076923

7654928,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I've only seen one episode, but I am already intrigued by the characters and am looking forward to watching the next episodes. I also like how Julian Fellows began and ended the episode, talking to the audience, reminding me of how Alfred Hitchcock used to do it. It kind of gives you a preview at the beginning, and sums up at the end. I hope all the episodes have that feature.",1464307200,,379,4.352112676056338

7654937,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Very nice presentation of a Trollopian tale of love and snobbery.  For costume drama fans, it'll satisfy very well.  Trollope is not paid enough attention to by film companies, possibly because his stories are complex and have more characters than is usual.  But he's one of the greats of English literature, so seeing a well-done film like this is a real pleasure.  Well cast, well acted, it's a winner.",1464307200,,404,4.811594202898551

7654941,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I'm a big Trollope fan, and I also enjoyed ""Downton Abbey"" and ""Gosford Park"" so I was prepared to like this a lot.  However, even with a total run time of just under three hours for all episodes combined, the story seemed to me to be a bit rushed.  In the book Mary's exile from Greshamsbury Park was much more painful because of its long duration.  Also, the actress playing Mary (Stefani Martini) was just a bit too angelic.  Alison Brie is too young and too attractive to convincingly represent Mrs. Dunstable.  I liked Rebecca Front's interpretation of Lady Arabella Gresham.  I thought that the colors were too brilliant and that the presentation of the story was too upbeat--not all of Trollope's novels have happy endings (e.g., ""The Small House at Allingham""), and those unfamiliar with ""Dr. Thorne"" might have enjoyed not having the ending implied by how the series was shot.",1464307200,,885,4.7894736842105265

7654966,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I remember being enthralled as a young girl with the dramatizations of Trollope's Palliser novels on Masterpiece Theatre.  It is truly a delight to watch this wonderful Dr. Thorne dramatization deploying some wonderful character actors that are familiar to many of us who have watched British cinema over recent decades.  Having Julian Fellowes preface each episode with a plot, character, and historical context overview is so very helpful to the viewer.  I studied British and Irish history in college and am a true Anglophile, but even I have learned so much by having Julian Fellowes set the stage before watching.  Trollope is an English genius, whose books transcend time and nationality.  He, like Shakespeare, understands human nature and motivations like so few can.  I just adore this program, and I hope Julian Fellowes will introduce the American viewing public to many more dramatizations of those iconic novels that form the backbone of his patrician background. To me, Dr. Thorne reminds me of my late  grandfather, a dedicated physician who worked in Pittsburgh during that city's industrial prominence.  He saw a lot of the human condition and treated everyone with respect, no matter the complexities and contradictions of their lives. He was a great doctor in the Dr. Thorne mold.  This show is just first rate, so please keep them coming. PS, Bosch is over-the-top wonderful too.",1464307200,,1399,5.154867256637168

The turn of fortunes and the manner in which Doctor Torne and his beautiful neice Mary face humiliation and eventual victory is a comedy in the true Trollopian vein.

Like Downton Abbey, the poor British aristocrats must marry rich women to keep their life of luxury, but who is really poor? or rich?

Julian Fellowes, and his hero author Anthony Trollope, create a very different landscape than the upstairs/downstairs Highclere Castle, and I am enjoying!",1464307200,,456,5.0131578947368425

This detracts from the viewing experience so you may wish to fast-forward past him, you will miss nothing!

If you enjoy British period pieces, then by all means partake!  Trollope's story exposes the hypocrisy of the era, the tail end of the feudal system giving way to kings of commerce rather than of birth.  It is unremarkable as a Dickensian plot with Dickensian characters carry out their assignments to the end.  It was a pastry rather than a meal.  Three stars.",1464307200,,651,4.568965517241379

7655315,5,B01BHTSIOC,I hope that Julian Fellowes does more miniseries like this. It satiated my hunger for Downton Abbey type shows. The acting was wonderful.

7655329,5,B01BHTSIOC,I wouldn't quite put this at the level of Downton Abbey but it is an entertaining story.  I enjoyed the series of 4 episodes.  I don't know if more are coming or if that completed the novel.  The last episode seemed to tee up several threads that could be pursued in future episodes.,1464307200,,283,4.30188679245283

Specifically, that Dr. Thorne would be so forgiving of and willing to work for his brother's killer, that Sir Louie would so conveniently die just before his 30th birthday so that Mary, by convoluted circumstances, inherits and thereby becomes a somewhat (because of circumstances related to her birth parents) acceptable spouse for Frank in the eyes of his greedy mother and others.",1464307200,,456,5.347222222222222

I would have liked to see more as the actors did a superb job in their roles and the story's emotion catches the viewer and holds the attention.  Alas, it is now concluded with a happy ending thank goodness.  I hope to see more Julian Fellowes' scripts produced now that we have lost our beloved Downton Abbey.",1464307200,,442,4.641025641025641

If you don't read the book, you'll never know. If you do, you'll wonder, ""Why?"".

The cast and production are first rate, though, and far better than the usual fare one encounters in a vast wasteland of television and movies.

The book is available at Project Gutenberg and worth reading. Disappointed that I couldn't read it in Kindle Reader, although some say that there is a way to make that happen. I installed ""FBReader"" and it worked great.",1464307200,,664,4.6581196581196584

7655424,4,B01BHTSIOC,I enjoyed it but it was not the same quality as Downton Abby. I felt there was a bit of overacting with a couple of the characters.,1464307200,,131,3.888888888888889

7655447,3,B01BHTSIOC,"I liked the casting, but the production itself seemed very one dimensional. I'm a fan of Trollope's writing and had read Dr Thorne  and enjoyed it.

7655464,4,B01BHTSIOC,I've just watched the first two episodes and am thoroughly enjoying this.  It seems that it is rather predictable as I can already tell that one dreadful person will probably pass away leaving my favorite character in a much better position.

7655475,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Nice tidy little story, beautifully acted, with many light whiffs of possibly heading toward the tremendous scope of Downton Abbey's greatness -- but, alas, ends up having neither the poignancy of Fellow's great work, nor its intricacy.  Its a sweet little tale, well told a thousand times over, helped by Fellow's skilled hand but ending up, nontheless, no more memorable than any other moderately successful ""boy meets (unacceptable) girl who eventually Triumphs Over All, and in the process, Forgives Meddling Soon-to-Be Inlaws, whom, we hope, Meddle No More In The Future"".  Aaaaagh!  Hopefully Fellows will write something as powerful and meaningful as Downton Abbey soon again.  Meanwhile: Dr. Thorne is fairly endurable after Downton, but only hints at Fellow's tremendous skill.",1464307200,,786,5.471074380165289

A couple of the characters were a bit overwrought, pushing them in the direction of caricature. (Evil need not wear its horns quite so conspicuously.)

7655598,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I haven't finished the entire series yet, but what I've watched so far has been excellent.
1. The characters are rich and complex. I love the former Mr. Collins from Pride and Prejudice, as Dr. Thorne. He is lovable and warm, especially with his niece. Really the entire cast is excellent
2. I love the way the story is being revealed with juicy little secrets along the way. The story is interesting and exciting, but completely acceptable and appropriate content for me to watch with my teenage niece.
3. The costumes are well done and the scenery is beautiful.
4. I really enjoyed Julian Fellowes introduction and summary of the episodes. I never had heard of Anthony Trollope. It is nice to be introduced to a new author; now I can't wait to read his books.
5. Frank, is played by a handsome young fellow.

7655599,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Well, it certainly fills a void left by the departure of Downton Abbey.  But don't be misled, this story, adapted from Trolloppe's novel, has a more narrow focus and a bit of a wry sense of itself. Eager for season 2!",1464307200,,217,4.2926829268292686

As much as I admire and respect Jullian Fellow's and his work, find his intro and exit set pieces before and after each episode rather tiresome and forced.

7655789,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Lovely costumes and lovely people. That said, the plot is predictable to the point of being painful, and yet 90% of the dialogue is still exposition. Do not spend time on it unless you love costume dramas regardless of their content.",1464307200,,233,4.7073170731707314

7655791,5,B01BHTSIOC,This is very much about the England we should know and not the one we feel we must be fed with in our American world of sufficient crises and daily newsfeed. Life paced differently is generally bland in our modern view. Earlier generations felt the depth of this mellow pace. It is for this reason that I treasure Jane Austen and Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell equally as much as Lee Child and Jo Knowles.,1464307200,,401,4.506849315068493

I loved the actors, the shots, though the exterior establishing shots did get a little annoying because I did wish they could come up with a better way of introducing us to the different locations, but then again those are often neglected during post-production as they try to turn out the film in it's entirety!  :) Oh indeed this was quite a splendid film, as film it must be only being around 3 hours in length!  :)",1464307200,,462,4.411764705882353

7655795,4,B01BHTSIOC,"I was delighted to hear of another Julian Fellowes production so soon on the heels of the beloved Downton Abbey series. Trollope is not an author I have had time to read, but based on Fellowes' warm recommendation, I downloaded the novel simultaneously with starting to watch this mini-series. The 4-part series, though entertaining and beautiful to behold, feels like the Cliff's a notes version of Trollope's lush novel. So much is left out or condensed that it all feels a bit rushed. I stretched the series out over a 6 day period, but have read only ~40% of the novel during that same time. So much of the novel is omitted, that the video series feels like a weak imitation. However, rarely do I find a screenplay adaptation of a novel to be as engaging and entertaining as the written word.

Nevertheless, if you enjoy British period pieces, and you don't intend to ever read the novel, this one will not disappoint. The castles are gorgeous, the countryside magnificent, and the costumes impressive. The plot is the predictable, oft-repeated struggle of the upper classes to retain their wealth at the expense of marrying for love. It is always of utmost importance to marry into one's own class, and failing that, to ""marry money"". So we know from the outset that the young master will have to marry well to right the sinking fortunes of the Greshams...we just don't know who the lucky lady will be!",1464220800,2,1407,4.719512195121951

I have posted this hoping my wife nor anyone else I know will ever know my true identity. I have not watched a lot of the shows many others have referenced in their reviews, but I enjoyed the show. It reminded me of cross between an old western, a soap opera, and keeping up appearances. Is this thing still anonymous?",1464220800,,488,4.202127659574468

7655807,5,B01BHTSIOC,"We thoroughly enjoyed Doctor Thorne for a date-night-in binge watch costume drama. There's so much available entertainment that that is dark, angst ridden, and disturbing - this is not that kind of series.  It was clean, light and entertaining.  Although it is not completely without some thought-provoking themes.  Does our culture value goodness and innocence enough?  Doctor Thorne does a great job in exploring some Victorian attitudes, both positive and negative.  The introductions and conclusions by Julian Fellowes reminded my husband of Alfred Hitchcock, and they were, indeed, a bit campy but we loved that about the show and thought it added to the charm.  All in all it was a refreshing, but updated, throwback to some good vintage television and we wish they would do more - how about some Wilkie Collins?

This is totally clean to watch with the whole family.  English Lit teachers looking to take up some of that end of the year downtime in the classroom might consider this one.",1464220800,4,994,4.9818181818181815
7655808,4,B01BHTSIOC,"If you're a Jane Austen fan, then you'll enjoy this adaptation of an Anthony Trollope novel. The characters actually follow a more understandable motivation than many of Miss Austen's characters. Some are more well rounded than others, but that may be a product of the adaptation rather than the underlying novel. What I do really appreciate about Julian Fellowes' adaptation is that he kept the pace moving without it feeling rushed. Coming in at around 3 hours total, the show is what I would describe as a the perfect length. The sets, scenes, and costuming are beautiful, as to be expected.

If you're fan of  Ian McShane (Deadwood), you'll love his role in this. He plays one of the main supporting roles, and actually has one of the most interesting backstories and one of the most in depth character developments.

While some have objected, I enjoyed the episode breaks with Julian Fellowes providing commentary. It reminded me of the old Materpiece Theatre.",1464220800,130,965,4.944444444444445

There's a comic strain to show with some overacting, possibly done purposefully, but it makes it hard to take any of the characters seriously.  The show has a rather retro-feel, with it's gold old-timey font and Julian Fellows introducing and concluding each episode with an air of academic analysis (even though the story is very easy to follow and the emotions of the characters are obvious. It's like some kind of simplified Masterpiece Theater - maybe the Brits working on this show felt like they had to dumb it down for the American audience?).

The little dramas and rivalries of the characters were highly entertaining. My biggest problem was with Fellowes insistence on telling the ignorant viewer what was to happen, and then reinforcing what did.

7655855,1,B01BHTSIOC,"This adaptation does nothing to improve one of Trollope's blander and more predictable novels.  Everyone is played as a pattern copybook character, and you can only pity the actors, who have to contend with tawdry direction on top of an airless script.  (Though they do seem to bring their own woodenness to their roles.) The best character in the book, Miss Dunstable, is completely eviscerated, changing from a plain outspoken ""middle-aged"" spinster (by Victorian standards) to a pretty American that plenty of men would be attracted to. And just to make it even more stultifying, the producer lectures us at the beginning and the end of each episode to reiterate what each episode makes abundantly obvious. There are so many better Trollope novels that have more complex characters and plots.",1464048000,22,795,5.107692307692307

Still ,all in all,I would highly recommend this drama for all those suffering from Downton Abby withdrawal. If I might add a aside ,I hope all the production people who green light Prime original content get a nice bonus this year.

On the other hand, I quit Downton Abbey mid-way through season 2, so I had concerns about what he would do with this book. And what he has done is to so Fellowes-ize it that almost all of the charm of the novel is lost. Everything is stated with such sledge-hammer obviousness, that it's almost painful. Unfortunately, good actors are in the position of having to say these lines. Alison Brie is Miss Dunstable, an actress I enjoy playing a character I love. The character is intelligent, practical, and humorous. So why does she come off as arch  and artificial in her opening scenes? I suspect she was directed that way.

Not only is the casting superb but the costuming and settings combine to make this drama a visual feast.  Anthony Trollopes novel focuses on relationships in class conscious Victorian England.  The actors bring the characters to life and are a joy to watch.

Julian Fellowes introduces each episode as well as offering a short commentary after each concludes.  It is reminiscent of Alistair Cookes role of host on Masterpiece Theatre.

7655882,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Cinematography reduced the actors to talking heads.  Goofy music turns the whole series into Regency camp.  Last of all, the blocking for the scenes indicated a sense of urgency that left the characters looking cold and distant, as if they had met the same day of filming.  Didn't really enjoy the ""modern"" rewrites, either, though the actors did what they could with the script they were given (only one or two glaring weaknesses in the cast, and they were all peripheral cast members).

I've enjoyed the Barchester series (with the help of free Kindle downloads), and one of the great virtues of the novels is what Trollope can communicate when his characters aren't speaking.  But Amazon seems to have rushed the production of this iteration, and has sadly reduced Barchester and its inhabitants to a vapid, 2-dimensional cartoon.  Maybe some people prefer that style (and are not shy about approving of it, if the Amazon reviews are any indication), but for the fans of the novels, this version of Trollope's work falls pretty far below an acceptable standard.",1463961600,,1064,4.949438202247191

It also reminds me that people have always been people. I appreciate stories that almost move beyond the times and expose the ridiculous and sometimes cruel in human behavior. The conventions have changed, and the world may seem more free but the truth is that you will find superior, snobbish people everywhere, quiet people, broken people, etc.
Stories like this, even if not considered very original, are important because so many of us live the same lives. The manners and social graces may have changed, but we all face times when we have to choose between ideals and practical ""real-life"" concerns.

(As was ready to view, in contrast to how the treatment of servants in Doctor Thorne accorded to the historical norm.)  Julian Fellowes is fine and elegant in his presentation of the world he graciously has revived for us.  Only one thing was missing--well, almost; there was a good instance (I'll let you guess where it occurred)--and that was the catalogue of zingers that only the Dowager Countess of Grantham can, like the ships Homer set against Troy, launch.

There is a richness of story, but fans of such great British writers as Dickens, Forester, Waugh, et al, know this content well and will find this series predictable. The adaptation by Fellowes is credible, I suppose, but Fellowes' presence and commentary pre and post episode is cheesy, unnecessary and smacks of trying to wrest or cash-in on the Masterpiece Theater imprimatur from PBS, of which this production is neither Masterpiece nor PBS.

Unfortunately, by the end of episode 1, the formulaic ""British Period Piece"" was under way, which I found disappointing.  Don't get me wrong, it's one of my favorite genres, however this really brought nothing new to the table.  Unless you are considering the part that Mr. Fellowes played, and I'm not certain that really was a contribution.  While espousing the writing prowess of the original author was quite nice, he was otherwise telling us what we were going to see, or what we had just seen.  It was in a bit of an over-the-top way, and I'm capable of figuring out what I've just seen.  Even Alistair Cooke never rambled on so much.

7655946,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Well... I definitely watched these pretty quickly. Did I feel like they were a downtown Abbey replacement? No, not so much.
The story is a good one. I have read and re-read the Austin and other similar works very frequently, and I think I'll give this series a go.
Why was this disappointing? Well, first off, I find the explanations done by Julian fellows both before and after each episode slightly insulting. I'm intelligent enough to understand what's going on without his needing to explain it to me....EVERY TIME. Also,I think it might have been helpful if it were presented on a weekly basis. However, presenting it in an on demand format with binge watching easily available just seemed insulting.
Ok, once I got through that... generally I knew how the series was going to turn out before the end of the first episode. Ok, that's kind of a given for these novels. The issue for me was there were no charming twists that make you think even for a moment that things aren't going to turn out just right. And while one of the characters gets his just desserts, no one else really does.
 Ok, if the two issues above didn't knock it down two stars, here's the thing that did it for me... the characters ended up being caricatures rather than real people to me. I just didn't feel like Julian Fellowes brought his A game. I think the directing could have been better since so much if it felt very overacted in a bad way without the depth needed to pull it off.  Also, I'm in full agreement that some of the casting could have been better. I am not sure if Mary was described as blonde, but most of the best beauties of that period were darker. I also think many of the characters ended up looking very strange, especially the families, when they all stood side by side, it was sort of horrible no thought was given to the fact they didn't look like each other a jolt.
Anyhow, if you don't have anything else to do, give it a shot. It is enjoyable, but not downton quality.",1463875200,7,1975,4.43801652892562
7655947,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Found Julian Fellowes' adaptation of Doctor Thorne quite enjoyable, but as someone who has read Dr Thorne twice, I was a bit taken aback by how quickly the plot moved along.  What took Trollope 400+ pages was managed efficiently in four episodes.  It was certainly more 'modern,' also, with Fellowes eschewing the sometimes painful Victorian reluctance to speak straight and having characters just saying what was going on, and who was who, without the hemming and hawing about 'indelicate' matters.  Probably all for the best, and certainly more likely to appeal to today's viewers.  Any chance there will be a season 2?  Doc Thorne and Miss Dunstable, converted to an American (I wonder why? to make her straight speaking more acceptable to the snooty Brits?), have a bit of a story to follow, too.  In fact, why doesn't Fellowes adapt all the Barsetshire novels, condensed the same way? Not to mention the Palliser series.  I love Trollope, too, and would avidly watch them all, on steroids or not.",1463875200,13,1001,4.9226190476190474

7655959,5,B01BHTSIOC,Julian Fellowes is my personal hero!  What a lovely series!  The visuals are stunning and the colors pop even on a computer screen.

Meanwhile, we have this period piece and it goes down like warm chocolate cake with chocolate sauce and chocolate ice cream.  A harmless and satisfying indulgence.

7655963,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This is but a touch below the level of ""Pride and Prejudice"" The author, screenwriters and actors did such a wonderful job in bringing this story to life. People would like to say that Dr. Thorne is predictable. I would like to say stories in the developmental stages of literature from the time period from which this stems can be thought of this way. On the other hand the period in which we live now has only been cheapened by Hollywood and does this sort of literature no justice. The crux we have to look at here is that this story was brought to life in the most wonderful of ways and allows the viewers to feel for the characters and what they are trying to accomplish in the world that encompasses them. Julian Fellowes alludes to it himself that this story is to show the complexity of characters and the concept of nature which calls for a balance in life will it be moral, political, or legal theory. If you are to watch this story or read it do so with an open mind free from the cheapened love stories of today.",1463875200,,1024,4.310880829015544

I just wish it were longer. However, I must say Mr. Fellowes did a much better job with the final episode. Unlike DA, whereas, the ending was rushed and jampacked with storylines. If you watch this, you will find yourself on a binge. Enjoy!",1463875200,,397,4.605633802816901
7655966,3,B01BHTSIOC,"We did watch all the episodes but they don't compare to the story quality of Downton.  To be fair, Downton should stand on its own as the story and time periods are different but, because Mr. Fellowes is involved, the bar for quality and content is raised high.  This series is enjoyable but just okay.

Also, Julian sitting in the red chair is a bit weird, and not sure if they meant to, reminds me of Alfed Hitchcock - lol",1463875200,3,424,4.275
7655967,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I don't post many reviews but after watching this series, I just had to. I'm a big fan of Julian Fellowes after Downton Abbey so I was curious to watch. The series is beautiful and cringeworthy in all the right places. There are some plot points that I feel weren't fully addressed and I'm going to download the book to see if it was a limitation of the medium or if the author really left it open ended. (The book is available for free on Kindle.) Despite this, I had to watch in one sitting because I couldn't pull myself away. Definitely worth the few hours investment!",1463875200,,572,4.355140186915888
7655968,5,B01BHTSIOC,Well done presentation of a good story. Wonderful filming locations and costumes. Julian Fellowes did a great job writing. His Alistair Cooke impression is great as well.

7655969,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Thank you!  Thank you!  Once again Amazon brings us GREAT entertainment!

I thoroughly enjoyed myself!  It was absolutely addicting!  Hollywood just can hold a candle to this kind of movie making and storytelling.  The BBC and English movie makers have something really special in this area.
And for me Anthony Trollope is right up there with Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, Gaskell and Alcott.

What a treat to hear the insights, thoughts and opinions in the epilogues of genius Julian Fellowes.  .

It is always a joy and great pleasure to see the craft and artistry of Ian McShane, Alison Brie and Tom Hollander.",1463788800,,616,4.846153846153846

I also wanted to believe Julia Fellows when he promised me complex characters and twists. But there were none. Not one. And Dr. Thorne et al. where about as multi layered as the toilet paper at the airport. Nor did any of them have any chemistry with each other. I did watch all four episodes, hoping that I'd be surprised at least a little while enjoying the scenery and costumes.

7655977,5,B01BHTSIOC,"What a wonderful surprise! Or rather, it surprises me how delighted I am by Trollope. I've loved Julian Fellowes' work since Gosford Park. After Downtown Abbey's final season, I'm glad to have more from Mr. Fellowes and to discover another 19th c. author. The story involves layers of dilemmas facing young lovers due to family expectations, a will's last-minute codicil, financial ruin, jealousy and ultimately happy endings. The actors were wonderful and the resolution satisfying. Fellowes' astute introductory remarks and his sums at the end added to the pleasure--especially if you can recall Alistair Cook on Masterpiece theater. Trollope was a prolific author, so I hope there's more to come.",1463788800,2,699,5.363636363636363

There was good British humor and a peek into the life of the times, but it was terribly rushed and several major details to the plot are skipped entirely after having been mentioned. A great deal of deus ex machina was all that kept the story going. In all, it was a cute little love story, but expect no more than that.",1463788800,,427,4.156626506024097

7655990,2,B01BHTSIOC,"If you're dying for a period costume drama this will probably do.  It's just very rushed and less complex than Julian Fellowa would have you believe.  He does an intro before each episode, much like Laura Linney does before masterpiece theater, and he keeps telling the audience how multilayered each character is, and how not everything is at seems.  And then he goes on about a supposed love triangle that is very nonexistent.

It's pretty irritating when it turns out that everything is as it seems and all the characters are little more than cardboard cutouts.  I imagine I would have enjoyed the story much more had I not been waiting for the story and characters to surprise me as I was told would happen by Mr Fellows before and after each episode.

I suppose I shouldn't have expected much out of the man who made Mary  Crawley to be such an incredibly unsympathetic character and did everything to try to make me like her to the point that I had to jump ship in the middle of Downtown Abby season 5.

And yes, I do know that Doctor Thorne was adapted from a novel written by Anthony Trollop and is not Julian Fellows original work but I can see why Fellows is quite a fan of Trollops writing.  I, however, don't imagine I'll go out of my way to watch anything that Julian Fellows has attached himself to in the future.",1463788800,13,1327,4.450413223140496

7655992,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I would have loved this story to be stretched out into more episodes where we could have explored each character more in depth. But it was good the way it was done too. Just a lot was skipped over that I feel would have really enhanced the story. Great acting. Beautiful settings. Wonderful plot. Even though I saw the end coming from the first episode, it only enhanced my enjoyment of watching everything I'd predicted come to pass. One thing I didn't see happened in the very last 5 minutes of the last episode and I wish that had been developed quite a bit more throughout the episodes because it made me very happy. Anyhow, overall a great show. Give it a try. I think you'll like it.",1463788800,,689,4.390625

7655995,1,B01BHTSIOC,"This was all about Julian Fellowes, wasn't it?  I knew this at the onset, as self-aggrandizement poured through his ultra British persona, as if the deeper his aristocratic accent, the more the Downton Abbey-philes will hasten to viewing his god-gift to us.  After all the hype and I'm sure the expense put into this fiasco, one cannot avoid the immediate slap in the face to all the expectations--the cinematography lacked 19th century mood, the casting was ridiculous, as one reviewer said, a GQ tween; the actors were poorly directed through a very poor script.  Sorry for this rough review but for one who adores British period pieces, and the list is long including Upstairs/Downstairs, Downton Abbey, The duchess of Duke Street, Poldark, The Way things Were, The Forsythe Saga,  to name a few, this kind of marketed pablum needs to be called.",1463788800,22,848,4.950704225352113

7655998,3,B01BHTSIOC,"If you're a real fan of period drama, this will suffice if you're itching for something new, but really, I'd rather re-watch any number of old classics available than this. I highly doubt I'll ever come back to this. Julian Fellowes' episodic writing has always been a bit weak; the first season of Downton showed how he rushes as if he's writing a movie, and then suddenly remembers that it must go on for quite awhile. This is the same. However, with Downton, the difference is that what's great about Fellowes is that he has a panache for writing great dialogue zingers, and his characters really come alive through the dialogue. Here, he isn't the source material author, and the dialogue is really rather droll. Also, the cinematography on this project isn't as good -- so it's nowhere as lush and beautiful as Downton was -- many shots are made with shallow depth of field, so much that it really seems as though it's a camera trick so you don't realize they're on a set, not outside, and the background is actually a painting. There are few shots where it seems as though they're really trying to make the most of the rented estates by ubiquitously showing architectural splendor, but it's not done very well.

In broad strokes, this is very much like an Austen story, with class lines getting in the way of love, and then throw in a dash of Wuthering Heights. However, like Fellowes, Austen also had a panache for dialogue, and herself seemed to have a much more natural wit in her writing than Trollope, allowing us to be amused by her characters. Here, there's really nothing but the plot line, which we're all too familiar with.

Finally, Julian Fellowes hosts as if he's Alistair Cooke, and I have to say, I found that really annoying; presumptuous even.

So, in sum, Dear Amazon, please continue with the period drama productions, but fire Fellowes and definitely get a new cinematographer.",1463788800,,1903,4.708708708708708
7655999,2,B01BHTSIOC,"Perhaps the fault of this mediocre and painful melodrama lies in its being crammed into 4 episodes. Nearly every action feels forced and trumped-up. The endings come off as trite and rushed, not triumphant or cathartic.

Don't expect the universe. It's not Downton Abbey. But on the other hand it is well done, the actors are real pros, and it's free with Prime. The introduction by Julian Fellowes is wonderful. The story is light but a treat. The main characters (Doctor Thorne and his daughter) are sympathetic and the villians are appropriately wicked but as Mr. Fellowes says ... not one-dimensionally bad and therefore interesting. After seeing this I decided to start listening to other Trollope books on Audible this morning and am enjoying the discovery.",1463788800,9,720,4.861788617886178
7656027,2,B01BHTSIOC,"The costumes and the settings are the best things about this remarkably silly Julian Fellowes indulgence. The acting, with the notable exceptions of Tom Hollander and Rebecca Front, is mediocre. Ian McShane engages in his usual scenery chewing overacting; there is no chemistry among the alleged romantic leads, and the heroes and villains are caricatures of characters.

The story lacked luster and the main climaxes of the story were rapidly skipped over and could have been made so much better. I found the costumes dreadful! The hats were modern day straw beach hats, cut to shape and a cheap trim added to hide where the scissors had done their worst. There were no stunning dresses but a lot of ubiquitous starched flowers  I like Julian Fellowes as an actor and writer, and I can only surmise that the direction was not up to scratch.

7656033,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Victorian era series about a penniless niece of Dr. Thorne, a widely respected doctor. We have two suitors for Mary, penniless and then not, but I found Frank, the man she prefers, to be boring and lazy. I didn't understand her attraction to him. His mother, Arabella objects to their plans of marriage until the end of the series simply because Mary is penniless and the family home can only be saved by marrying her grown children off to a rich man, or woman---anyone will do as long as lavish living of hearth and home is kept intact. No love need apply.
Then we have Louis, son of the deceased and wealthy uncle of Mary. He's portrayed as a boozer and it's un-nerving and overdone with his glass of booze, or whatever he drinks and in his hands almost all times and it's simply overdone. Without the drinks, Louis is much better suited to marry Mary. It's really the only obstacle that I can fathom. She's a good horsewoman; he's a good horseman and he does love her, despite his drinking. Loose the booze glass at every turn and things could be different. Frank's declarations of love fall flat and without emotion of any kind in a kiss or whatever form. I don't really think the series is about saving a mansion and a family's lavish way of living by marrying adult children into the world of money. In my opinion, it's about marrying for love being acceptable.",1463788800,,1367,4.516129032258065

7656035,4,B01BHTSIOC,"While I agree with some of the previous reviews, its not Downton...but it is definitely worth a watch!  I appreciate Julian Fellowes as a director, and screenwriter.  I even don't mind hearing his brief synopsis at the beginning of each episode, but I think its overkill to recap at the end of each episode.
 Knowing that Season 2 is up in the air,  I felt the wedding was rushed to tidy up loose ends just in case.
Well,  I hope they have a season 2. Hopefully, they read the reviews, so they next season will be as good as Downton!",1463788800,,533,4.29
7656036,4,B01BHTSIOC,Thoroughly enjoyable diversion. Enjoy it for what it is. Trollope was never as hard to slog through as Austen or Dickens and liked happy endings. It is entertaining and I enjoyed it so much I binge watched the whole thing in one sitting. The acting was fine and if anything understated. Dont let other reviews dissuade you.

7656039,4,B01BHTSIOC,"It's definitely not Downton, but also, it would be wrong to compare it to that standard as Doctor Thorne is entirely different from it.
It motivated me to read the novels of Anthony Trollope. The script is good, as we can expect from Fellowes. The costumes are marvelous and the cinematography unique and clean. Its a little optimistic for my taste, a little too sweet of an ending. Then again, I'm a cynic. The message of the series is applaudable however. But the actors do their job well, you detest Arabella and the Lady De Courcy yet you pity Louis. I should like to see a second season and see if the characters get a chance to develop more. If anything, maybe a bit more time was needed, perhaps longer episodes. The story seemed rushed in certain parts.
Overall, its enjoyable. Well done Julian Fellowes. You are versatile and I hope to see more of your work!",1463788800,,867,4.528662420382165
7656040,5,B01BHTSIOC,"I absolutely loved this four part series. It is gorgeous, charming, and made me smile the whole time. It is fairly fast paced, but this allows it to stay fresh and far from dull. In all honesty, I wish there were a few more episodes, but it was lovely nonetheless. The acting is pretty solid; some performances were a little hit or miss, but overall it was superb. The costumes and sets were very elegant and perfect for the series. The camera work was decent; sometimes it felt a little underwhelming, but I cannot complain. The story is very charming and active. I have never read anything by Trollope, but I have added him to my ""to read"" list. I highly enjoyed Doctor Thorne, and I would recommend it to anyone, especially people who enjoy shows like Poldark and Downton Abbey. I pray that it receives a disc version because I would like to add it to my shelf.",1463788800,,864,4.440251572327044

7656044,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Really enjoyed this adaptation.  Though there were some tragic characters, and some I wouldn't invite over (including a mother), there was a great deal of humor that I liked in this production.  My favorite, perhaps, is near the end in Amazon's episode 4.  That's as much of a spoiler as I'm willing to give.  I don't think this is close to Julian Fellowes's Downton Abbey, and certainly not the biting wit of Maggie Smith, but there were allusions to other British works.  Quite honestly, I haven't read Trollope's book, but now find I must.  I'd like to know if his characters were written to appear as in the adaptation, or if they are more exaggerated.  I found a bit of Jane Austen, and was reminded a bit of the haughty Hyacinth.  Even though this won't be the sensation that many of the British shows come to be, I think the production values in the show were much better than we seem to do here, generally.  I would like to see more of Trollope's work brought to the small screen.",1463702400,,988,4.4748603351955305

7656047,3,B01BHTSIOC,"Yes, yes, it is lovely to behold. Beautiful costumes, settings, landscape and cinematography, but a pretty flat plot. Mr. Fellowes himself appears at the beginning and end of each episode, extolling the virtues of Anthony Trollop's writing skill, expressing his admiration for Trollop's  ability to render characters of great depth, unfortunately range of character did not translate from the page to the screen, so we have only Mr. Fellowes' word for it. (I confess I've never read Trollop) However the cast was full of outstanding actors who could probably read a telephone book and make it interesting. Just think what would have been possible if the story had not been so bare bones predictable. When Alistar Cook introduced the old Master Piece Theater productions it was to offer  insight about the culture or history of the period  that  the general population, especially Americans, would not have been aware. These were generally informative and added to the appreciation of the story. Frankly I found Mr. Fellowes,  in his little fire side setting, in the same position, same jacket and tie, twice in each and every episode telegraphing the plot  with flagrant spoilers, directing your attention to details  of character in case we missed them, then recapping what we'd seen in case we failed to grasp the significance as annoying as it was condescending. The whole thing lacked tension and any sense of anticipation for the outcome.  I never felt sympathy for this rich, ungrateful family about to get thrown out on their pampered butts. So the good news is, it is pleasant to watch even if it's not very engaging. And, I'm going to read this book. I'll let you know if I change my opinion. :)",1463702400,149,1704,4.933566433566433

As Fellowes did not have much time to develop characters as he did on Downton, I would say he has done a splendid job of it in his new series.

The hero and heroine are both good, do good, and are rewarded. Ian McShane is fantastic in his small role and is redeemed at the end, as are the 'villains' of the piece. Even the smallest character contributes to the storyline or atmosphere and the village was just gorgeous. The subplot with 'Gus', Lady Augusta, is very funny, though not of course for her, and the American heiress Miss Dunstable was very intriguing and well played.  Devoured all 4 episodes in one sitting, it was so good. Yes, the Victorians were stiff, preoccupied with class, and had very formal ways of acting, which are brought out accurately here.

When your leading ""man"" looks like a tween Abercrombe and Fitch model and appears much younger and more girly than your heroine, you know you've got a serious problem. All the upper lip injections in the world cannot give this utterly shallow lead actress the kind of natural pretty warmth required of a historic romance heroine, esp ag tween GQ.  Why A&E's seminal Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility, and Downtown Abbey bar none were all so incredibly successful and beloved was casting - the right cast can enthrall reading a recipe or the phone book.  This casting was bad, you wonder that so much expense, time, energy would be put into such a project then cut at the knees by really really bad casting.  Our heroine looks like a transvestite, to me, and though that may be ok elsewhere, it is not ok in Austen.  This visually gender neutral heroine - with as much warmth and depth as an ice slick on the road - distracts horribly from the story. Though loaded with some older stalwart historic romance fav actors, the other young starlets cast also totally lack the quintessential historic authenticity and character acting chops we luv and expect from a juicy historic romance piece.  The casual observer won't notice this, but the hard core won't luv it and in fact may wince as i did within the first 10 seconds.  The story is not either that compelling or fleshed out here.  Even so, Downton IMMED hooked us with superb casting - this is a barely tolerable dose for the truly period romance enamored, but it will NOT become Downton nor do Trollope the kind of justice or recognition Fallows seeks.",1463702400,5,1879,4.641566265060241

For those leaving not so great reviews, I thought the creator did just fine with only 4 shows! You can only go so deep and develop an entire novel so far in limited amounts of time.

Tom Hollander and Ian McShane elevate this series with fine acting even though the adaptation, dialog, and soundtrack is a bit forced. I loved seeing Nicholas Rowe as Gazebee...yet he will always be a young Sherlock Holmes to me! The other actors were perfectly fine but less memorable. Nothing and no one really stood out.

Mary's in love with her childhood friend, but his parents oppose their relationship because they want their son to marry for money and save the family estate.  Sound familiar?  Anyone who has read any Dickens knows where this story goes.  There are no surprises here, no subtitles to the plot, no complexity of character.  And the music?  Yikes.  If you're ever stumped while watching this as to how you're supposed to feel, the overwrought score will tip you off.  (""Time to laugh!""  ""Oh, sad part."")

Bravo to Amazon for providing Prime members with something a bit different.  And I hope they keep grabbing a variety of shows to stream.  And if you're looking for something harmless and somewhat literary you can watch with the kids, ""Doctor Thorne"" is a reasonable option.  But if you prefer more grownup fare with character development, plot surprises, and subtlety in direction, acting, and screenplay, have another go at the BBC's ""Pride and Prejudice.""",1463616000,12,1820,5.053872053872054

7656098,5,B01BHTSIOC,"This adaptation of ""Doctor Thorne"" is witty, engaging, charming, and even at times downright funny. This is a sunny world populated by all kinds of scheming characters. Some are put in their place, others get their comeuppances at the end. It's somewhat predictable, and a little cramped (I wouldn't have minded another hour to flesh out the side stories) but quite charming.

It's also one of the few recent costume dramas I would have no issue problem recommending to anyone. It's nice to watch a grow up story without ""the adult content"" to match.",1463184000,23,550,4.851063829787234

7656100,5,B01BHTSIOC,"Doctor Fellowes is not really a ""Downton"" type mega-hit.  Instead, it is a little bit Cranford, a tiny bit Poldark, and a lot of Emma and Sense and Sensibility.

Taken in its own right, Doctor Thorne is everything I expected it to bewhich is just fine by me.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.

To be clear, it really more of a long movie than a ""series,"" per se (just under three hours in total).  But the length works well enough for the source material.

To turn it into a set of four distinct episodes rather than the a movie format, the producers added formal fireside introductions and conclusions by Julian Fellowes to each ""episode"": kind of an Afred Hitchcock meets Masterpiece Theater kind of touch. Those weren't really weren't my personal cup of tea, because they tended to take me out of the flow of the story, and sometimes offered up (minor) spoilers.  Some viewers might enjoy those interludes though, and they were easy enough to skip over.

To be clear, nothing about Doctor Thorne was surprising in the slightest.  Marvelously grand houses.  Spectacular clothing.  Unnaturally beautiful people.  Stunning English scenery.  Fabulous wealth, and the desperate fear of losing it.  High-stakes tradeoffs between love and money.  Deathbed drama, and lighthearted frivolity.  The strictures of being a woman during that era.  Uptight English norms, and desires to break free of them.  The entre of an American heiress into that world, casting a bright light on some of the inherent dysfunction of that system.  And, of course, some requisite swoon-worthy deep eye gazing, with expressions of repressed and forbidden love.

Okay, so not terribly surprising, and more than a little predictable; even a bit formulaic at times.  But it is the source material by Trollope which is responsible for that, not something about this particular rendition.  And in any case, so what, since it is a formula that works?!  It was engaging and pleasant and perfectly marvelous fun, and I will happily watch it again.  And it is quite to Amazon's credit that it is willing and able to support original feature productions of this impressive quality.

The characters and all of their perfect imperfections were compelling, often comically so, with a few notably wise souls in the mix.  I was left wanting to see more of them, which is a good sign.  I enjoyed seeing familiar faces (favorites were Allison Brie of Mad Men, Ian McShane of Deadwood, with several other recognizable actors in the mix as well.)  I did not happen to find the familiarity to be distracting in this case, but be forewarned that some viewers may.

It will have a smaller potential audience than Downton Abbey.  Among other especially special attributes of Downton, it was quite a cross cutting show, enjoyed seemingly as much by men as by women.  I quite loved both of the shows myself, but I am guessing Doctor Thorne will not be as widely beloved.  This strikes me as a show mostly for the English period drama aficionado, which is quite fine by me, but naturally limits its reach.

For some interesting context about Anthony Trollope's work relative to his contemporaries, with discussion of Doctor Thorne in particular (with useful comparisons between the book and novel), Google  ""The Way We Live Now,"" by Laura Miller, published on Slate.com on May 30, 2016.

For those of you who finish all 4 episodes/ 3 hours of Doctor Thorne tonight (...and, c'mon, you know you probably will...), and are then left wanting more British period drama, here are some ideas.  Here are good Amazon options, mostly on Prime (+ also check the comments section below this review, since people have been making some great suggestions there, as well!)

****************************************************************************
*** TIPS for VIEWING ALTERNATIVES (for after you have blown through Doctor Thorne!) ***
****************************************************************************

~~~  POLDARK ~~~ A succulent English drama that will tend to appeal to the same crowd who will enjoy Doctor Thorne, albeit with a bit more darkly melodramatic flair.  Set in the English countryside on the heels of the Revolutionary War as British soldiers return home, it has classic themes of marrying for love or money, sudden gains and reversals of fortune, working class struggles vs. the landed gentry, tension between those who are ready throw off the strictures of hierarchical English society versus the many elites who resist it mightily.  After blowing through Season 1 of Poldark on Amazon Prime, I am now eagerly awaiting Season 2.

~~~ LARKRISE TO CANDLEFORD ~~~ Seasons 1-3.  Based on a book of the same name, Larkrise to Candleford is a bit less opulent than Doctor Thorne and Poldark.  It spends much of its time with the middle and lower classes of English society (directly acknowleding the differences in engaging, if fairly predictable, ways).  As such, the costumes and sets aren't quite as marvelous.  But it is a lovely show, if a tad dated in terms of production quality.  It is also one that is family friendly (kind of like an English ""Little House on the Prairie""), mixing life lessons in with the drama, so I have been rewatching it with my 11 year old.  Catch it while you can on Prime, as it has circulated in and out of Prime, and right now (May 2016) all three seasons are free on Prime. (and/or just read the classic books, as they are also a real treat, and fantastic window into that interesting time of railroads and associated technological developments, and how those affected rural English society.)

~~~ CRANFORD ~~~ Cranford is along the lines of Larkrise to Candleford, a little newer, and also quite a charming on small village life in merry 'ole England.

~~~ THE PARADISE ~~~ The genre is slightly different -- i.e. rather than focusing on the landed gentry in pastoral England, it focused on the opening of the first full-fledged department store in Gibson-girl London.  The concept can feel a tad predictable and trite (audacious store owner, big stores pushing out small stores, women gaining independence in the workplace, shop floor competition, etc.)  Yet it is much fun!  Great costumes.  Engaging characters.  An always-interesting focus on new developments replacing old traditions.  Different seasons of Paradise cycle in and out of Prime (and it doesn't seem to be on Prime as of the moment), but it always worth a look to see if/when The Paradise available for free.

~~~ MR. SELFRIDGE ~~~ Basically see my description of ""The Paradise"" for plot (the shows are almost amazingly similar!)  Keep the idea of a flashy and controversial department store replacing the increasingly staid stores of London.  Change the era to Downton Abbey/ early 20th century/pre and post WWI.  And basically, you get ""The Paradise"" and its department store politics, set in a later era, with an audacious businessman (Jeremy Piven of Entourage) who happens to be American.  It also has great costuming.  It also focuses a good deal on new developments pushing out old traditions, and on the societal change of women gaining independent power outside of the home.  Like the Paradise, it is also a little predictable and sometimes a bit trite, yet it is still good fun!  Several seasons of Mr. Selfridge happen to be on Prime at the moment, and you might want to grab it while you can because it, too, cycles in and out of Prime.

~~~ OUTLANDER ~~~ I almost hesitate to add Outlander because it not on Prime at the moment (so $19-ish per season), and because it probably has already been voraciously consumed by a good portion of the people looking into Doctor Thorne...but, oh, if you haven't seen it, you must!  Be forewarned though, it can be graphic, both sexually and in terms of violence; Outlander is definitely not family-friendly fare, and the violence sometimes seems over the top and unnecessary to me.  But, aside from that, it is quite a magnificent show.  If you are not familiar with it, or the wonderful books the series is based on, Outlander is a bit hard to explain -- it is mostly Scottish colonial period drama, mixed with time travel.  But even the sci fi adverse are likely to enjoy this show, with its magnificent costumes, sets, lush Scottish scenery, and, aye, the truly marvelous accents and men in kilts.  The acting and characters are great, as well.  Highly recommended, at least for those who are ok with fairly explicit violence and (...some wildly, passionately, super hot...) sex.

7656101,4,B01BHTSIOC,"Was a very predictable but still nice. Only a little disappointed how they ended off in Augusta's case. I felt they could've ended her off in a bit better a position. I know she was silly/ stupid & deserved what she got, but she was also  young, naive, & trusting of selfish relatives, so in the end I just feel sorry for her. It may have been the original writer who ended it off this way, though, so I wouldn't blame the movie makers for this.

8750239,1,B01BHTSIOC,"The production itself had great casting, great scenery, etc.  No wonder it gets mostly 5 Stars?

By it is sad to reflect on this sad remnant of Masterpiece Theater.

Consider: Upstairs/Downstairs went on for many, many episodes.  Each one advanced the plot only slightly. The series had entirely believable characters acting in entirely believable ways.  The last couple of seasons, as James suffers the after-effects of WWI, and Richard marries his secretary were excruciating.  Richard has done what we would think is natural, but everyone around him says ""She doesn't know her place.""  The gradual decline of James is even more pitiable.

Fast forward to Downton Abbey.  The plot evolves at lightening pace, and it is truly improbable that the head butler ends up in prison awaiting trial.

Dr. Thorne really marks the end of the road.  There are only four, 40 minute episodes, so this giant book is reduced to the length of a 2 1/2 hour movie.  Why, oh why, did they truncate it like this where the people commenting on this site are raving about it.  This book could have been made into about 16 episodes where you would actually come to understand the complex difficulties Trollope has each character face.

I've listened to this as an audiobook of 20+ hours.  Did you know that while Dr. Thorne is shown to be a saint, and while he also is the ""hero,"" his hang-up  is that he maintains pretensions of his own about his background.  He is alienated from the branch of his family with the money because of a perceived slight, and he is at odds with the rest of the medical community because of his treatments.

Lady Arabella, meanwhile is a hypochondriac  who relies on Thorne.  You only see her cough once in the series, but it is a major theme that she wants his advice but is too proud to call on him.

And the reason the family is broke is mainly Lady A's insistence they maintain a house in London they can't afford.

In the book, the only person who knows about Mary's background is Gresham and he is boxed in because he was the one who brought Mary to the house.  Mary has no idea either until near the end, etc., creating endless tension as she is illegitimate.

Frank, meanwhile, though he claims he will marry Mary for love, ignore the money, and get a job, is probably not capable of functioning on his own.  In the book, you understand that this plan will fail because he is an underachiever at school, likes his horses, etc.

The only point in the series that really embraces Trollope's style is right at the end where the one sister advised the other not to marry the lawyer, and it turns out she then marries him herself.

Really too bad. I think the audience would have loved the full version, and I never understand the excuse that people have no time or short attention spans.  Take a look at Game Of Thrones or House Of Cards.  Complicated plots that have a wide following.",1535414400,,2897,4.560077519379845
