4400472,5,B004L5TVPU,"The three DVDs in the set have been very helpful to me.  I like how they take you through with clear instruction and that there is alot to work with.  You are not just stuck with one thing to work with, but instead have some things when you are just starting which are easier to do with more help (there is a good amount of that), plus more to work on that adds to earlier work.  There are things where you are sitting, lying down, standing and the selection helps to find things that you can start with that way also.",1304380800,66,518,4.108910891089109
4400473,5,B004L5TVPU,"This set of videos is a perfect selection if you are inflexible or very new to yoga like I am.

It is designed to really help you out between the 3 choices,  Yoga For Inflexible, Essential Yoga For Inflexible and Gentle Yoga.  The first one guides you through modified moves to make things real easy and allows you target areas, the second is a more general version with a couple of sections that are more modified then some less modified things and the last has three sections of various levels.

I have found things that I can do on each one and am rotating them every day.",1303171200,121,575,4.345794392523365

4400481,5,B004L5TVPU,"I simply love this DVD set! At 64 years old, I was timid about starting yoga, despite the fact that I could feel myself growing steadily less flexible. This DVD has transformed me into a yoga addict in just a couple months! I can't say enough about the DVD entitled ""Gentle Yoga."" Not only does this DVD get you started, it does so with ""VERY Gentle Yoga,"" much of which you can do while seated in a chair. Don't let the chair part fool you, though, you'll still get a nice workout. I've progressed to Gentle Yoga Challenging Routines and will probably stay there for a while. One of the best things about about these programs is the fact that the teacher gives you alternate movements to do if the standard pose is too difficult or painful. Finally, I like knowing subsequent CDs will give me somewhere more challenging still to go as I progress.",1449273600,3,847,4.470967741935484

Even the Gentle yoga was quite rigorous for me...but I guess it all comes down to opinion. I just wish there was a way to slow her down as sometimes it was so quick, by the time I finally got to the stretch she was already on the next pose...which defeats the purpose of calming yoga!",1437523200,6,432,4.154761904761905

I'm disabled -  out of shape and my balance is off because of a stroke I had years ago.  I need yoga to help me get back into balance and build strength.  This video helps me do that -  I've done only the easiest sitting yoga so far.  Don't mistake me -  it's the easiest level but it's definitely a workout -  you can feel the stretch.  I also like how she encourages us to NOT overdo it - to go as far as we can but not overextend.  Great video for beginners or those who need help getting back into shape and balance.

I started with the Gentle Yoga on the Chair section since I figured sitting would be good.  That started getting me some range of motion and I was able to start adding some workouts from the others, though there are some on there I could have also started with.

The lessons then built up and I started selecting areas to work on and general workouts from all three.  There is a great number of things to do and even on days where I have less time, I use a short workout just to make sure I maintain things I have developed and progress.",1407801600,2,681,4.097744360902255

4400523,3,B004L5TVPU,I am not a yoga fan so my review may have a little bit of bias in it.  I was pretty bored with this whole set of yoga DVD's.

4400525,2,B004L5TVPU,"Im new to yoga and purchased this DVD series because its geared for ""inflexible"" people. While the positions are solid and gentle, the transitions are VERY choppy.

For example:

* One of the many programs consists of six or seven separate subprograms. The screen goes black in-between the subprograms. Its like starting a completely new yoga session. This makes it very difficult to get in the groove and is NOT relaxing.

* It would be helpful if you didn't have to pause the DVD, then get up to retrieve a chair or strap for the next subprogram. Knowing what tools you need at the beginning of the program would eliminate this flaw.

* The scenery is quiet dated and unappealing.

While I do not recommend this DVD, I'll end my review on a positive note
The narrator does an excellent job of pronouncing the Indian names of the positions.",1389052800,2,841,4.617449664429531

4400527,2,B004L5TVPU,"This DVD set is too basic.  And the full routines (what few there are) lack flow.  Maybe this is beneficial for a senior citizen who has never stretched a day in their life before.  (I don't mean that to be insulting, I just can't think of another example of someone who would have absolutely exposure to the concept of stretching.  That's how basic this is).  But if you are a normal person who is inflexible and looking to get flexible .. keep looking for a different DVD.",1384819200,3,474,4.402298850574713

4400530,3,B004L5TVPU,"I have always thought I was an inflexible person until I purchased this DVD set.  While touching my toes tends to be a challenge without a slight bend to my knees, I realize now that there must be far less flexible people than me out there.  Two of the three CDs were a waste..it seemed as if I was going through the motions of a person recovering from injury.  Very careful, limited stretches that I surpassed without issue.  The only DVD in the set that seems slightly helpful to me was the one with the customizable workouts that allow you to challenge yourself a bit more....and I mean just a bit more.

All in all I can say it made me rethink my flexibility level on a scale of 1 to 10.  If you can't touch your toes easily but don't have much problem with getting into simple poses, don't buy this.  It is designed for people who need to start with chair exercises to get them more mobile and may be better suited for the senior who isn't as active or those just getting back on their feet after a long recovery from injury.",1379116800,5,1030,4.251282051282051

This set is exactly what I needed and delivered what I expected.  There are three DVDs.  The Gentle Yoga starts off as the easiest in  general since the first section has alot of selections where you sit on a chair and move from there, showing you the moves and giving you stretches and poses that are used otherwise from the basic position.  So if you need the most help, good one to choose.  Later on it increases.

The Essential Yoga For Inflexible (on beach) also starts off with easier movements with chairs, then moves into longer workouts.  This is a general dvd overall, while the other Inflexible has general workouts, plus also focused items.

With the wide range of workouts (starting with some real easy ones) to the later levels, covers what you need if you are looking for something if the word Inflexible (or somewhat new) applies to you.

One DVD, the Gentle Yoga, has almost all of the first level done on or with a chair, so it was real easy to start stretching and moving with that.  (It has three levels)

One of the Inflexible really targets problem areas which the other is more general workouts, and both have easy things to do.  These have been exactly what I needed.",1366156800,,477,4.314606741573034

4400549,2,B004L5TVPU,"I am not an active person at all (although I did do yoga many years ago), and I thought this beginners set would be a good place to re-start a movement practice. WAY too beginner! One DVD is nothing but EYE movements, the other two use a chair for most, if not all of the 'exercises' (I use that term loosely). If you are very elderly or have severe health and/or mobility issues, then this set will be perfect for your needs. If you can walk and bend without assistance, this will not benefit you at all (unless maybe you want to meditate). The set itself is not 'bad', just be aware that it is not meant for anyone that has even reasonable health and body motion ability.",1361404800,8,673,4.265625

It is for the person who wants to step up their yoga level not have a gentle workout without pain.  The person instructing has a very irritating voice which does not help with relaxation. From now on I will only order from Gaiam!  Total waste of my money!!!!,1361404800,6,363,4.65625

4400555,3,B004L5TVPU,I was gonna return this because it is pretty outdated. Seems to be made in the 80s to early 90s. The front cover is pretty misleading. I did like the gentle dvd and I use some of the essentials one. It is slow paced. It would be great for people who are very new and need every step easy to understand or someone with injuries or an older person. I decided just to keep it and not go through the hassel and just use it for some night time exercise. So anyone under the age of 25 or even 30 may find the outdatedness really annoying. But again it is good for those who need to learn the absolute basics more slowly.,1358294400,4,614,4.040983606557377
4400556,2,B004L5TVPU,"These DVDs are definitely for beginning yoga students, which is fine. However, the sets and voice overs are really unappealing, regardless of your yoga level. For example, one of the DVDs looks as though it was set in an Olan Mills studio from the 1980's. I prefer the Element Yoga DVDs - the setting is serene and becomes a part of the home yoga/DVD experience. This 3 DVD-set is headed for Goodwill.",1356998400,4,401,4.583333333333333

4400560,5,B004L5TVPU,"If you are lack flexibility and want to start yoga, this is a collection you want to consider.  All 3 DVD are by different instructors, which I like.  It gives me variety and each teacher does things a little differently so you can see what works for you and also pick up different pointers and cues.  One is what I'd describe as remedial yoga.  There's even routines using a chair instead of the traditional blocks and straps.  If you really have no flexibility, you can appreciate this.  I know I have.  Another instructor gets into more detail in the poses and uses the more traditional props and modifications.  I'm still working my up to that level.  I've only popped in the third DVD to take a look at it and watch the instructor interview.  When I'm ready for it, I know I'll like it too.",1342137600,4,795,4.4206896551724135

4400564,5,B004L5TVPU,"The set does what the title says, gives you help if you are inflexible or not quite THAT flexible through the 3 DVDs, though there are a couple of sections that do work you more later on.  But primarily it is for people new to yoga or who need help.  The Gentle Yoga has the most basic support to start with the first section mainly being done on chair or relying on the chair.  There are others like that on the two other DVDs also to work with.  Also good information on using things for support (mostly on the Yoga Inflexible People) where blocks, or books, and other things are done to make things easier.  Such as using a strap or tie to get some reach.

Browse through all the selections to see which ones will work from the start for you, but if you just want to start without doing that go for the Gentle Yoga first level, the couple on Essential that use a chair and some of the first poses listed on the Inflexible People.

Very well worth it to have this.",1338076800,9,966,4.1891891891891895

My impression was this product is intended for inflexible people. However, it requires a great deal of flexibility to perform the tasks.

4400568,4,B004L5TVPU,"The first CD is pretty much for people with injuries or elderly people. The positions were a little too easy because the instructor uses a chair prop the whole time.

The second two CD's are good for inflexible people or people new to yoga because they say when to breath so you can time it right and they tell you exactly where each part of your body should be. They also hold the poses for a long time so you build flexibility, balance, and stamina.

Essential Yoga For Inflexible is a bit more general and Gentle Yoga has alot of things to work with.

I have found that they have lived up well for being designed for people who are inflexible and/or are looking for gentle routine and each gave their own uses and levels.  The selections also have a bit more added to them, so there is more to work with as you gain flexibility and strength.  Essential Yoga For Inflexible People and Gentle Yoga have sections as you move along, the first Inflexible is targeted to various areas.

Start with the first Yoga For Inflexible People and also the first levels on the other two titles, then the other levels on the second two DVDs.

If you are considering buying this because you have gotten stiff, want modification, or just don't move thought the poses as fast is you used to, don't.  I have tried these exercises and they are entirely too slow and modified.  If you are recovering from injury or going through rehab for something, this is probably great.  If you are a little stiff, gotten slower, or want modifications... just be persistent in your practice until you get looser or get a basic yoga dvd.  Again if you are a little stiff more persistence/taking on the challenge is probably the answer.  I think people who have done yoga but gotten stiffer will find this too slow.

I suggest reading a good book on Yoga also, like ""yoga for dummies"" and ""full body flexibility"" for more insight into breathing, self awareness and extending from the neck to the feet.
