8396928,5,B003H8HV36,"I am a big fan of Alex Jones, and I believe that what he is doing is for a righteous cause. Though he may at times seem slightly irrational, and sound like a crazy ""conspiracy theorist"" he genuinely believes that we need to be woken up. The Republic is falling around us, helped by corrupt politicians and ""bankster"" crooks, and the sad thing is most of us don't care. Economic collapse? Who cares, American Idol is on! Your rights as citizens are being taken away??? Wow, I hope my sports team wins the playoffs!!! Illegal wiretapping? I hope I get an IPhone! Most Americans don't see the storm clouds on the horizon, but these two movies will open everyones eyes to the truth. There are people around the world who want nothing more than to control all of us, and the plans have been in motion for decades. We are on the cusp of their Endgame, and if we don't start waking people up soon, all we have may be lost. Long Live the Republic! We Will Prevail! Death to the New World Order!",1274659200,3,986,4.364130434782608
