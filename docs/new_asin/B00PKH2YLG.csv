6815136,4,B00PKH2YLG,"This movie does a good job of trying to be realistic.  Real life isn't like a Hollywood movie so there are no car chases, no kung-fu.  Just a couple of average looking middle age women who have average jobs.  Personally I thought the two sex scenes were hot because it seemed real life, not porno, more like making love.",1461974400,7,320,4.389830508474576

6815139,4,B00PKH2YLG,"When you think of same sex couples having children you only think about all the wonderful aspects of parenting. This is the amazing take on the perspective of all the trials and difficulties that could possiblly happen along way, with the real strains on a relationship that could untimate happen. It certainly can make you think twice before you take such a hugh step. The women in this movie did a great job with this portrale.",1427241600,9,429,4.657894736842105

8688374,2,B00PKH2YLG,"I particularly like foreign films, prefer it over american films any day...but this movie just didn't do it for me. I watch it free (thank god I didn't pay for it), The whole concept of happy life with this couple is lacking. One wants children, the other does not. She thinks she will feel left out after the child arrives which  In the end, she IS left out. Couple did not have a solid foundation in the first place, a child just made it worst. Bad movie all around and not because there was no happy ending, its because the story line didn't work, the actresses didn't have chemistry, it was just plain bad.",1469750400,,610,4.350877192982456
