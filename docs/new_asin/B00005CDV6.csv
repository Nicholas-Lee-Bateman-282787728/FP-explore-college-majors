8624792,3,B00005CDV6,"I received the DVD of this film and I have to say that there must be a better version of this out there. The print is blurry, cropped to 4:3 and is probably a cut TV version of the film. The film itself is great exploitation fun and would love to see it in a restored print in it's original aspect ratio. They don't make films like this anymore. I give it 5 stars minus 2 for the barely watchable version (Codename: Zebra DVD) that is available.",1331424000,4,445,4.126436781609195
