8513688,5,B007B3426M,"Marvel Has awesome superheros and Daredevil is one of them. Ben Affleck plays Dredevil and he's awesome at it. Jennifer Garner plays Elektra and she is awesome and georgeous in her outfit. Collin Ferlle Plays Draedevils Main Nemisesse Bullseye and he rocks and Michael Clark Duncan Plays the Most Dangerous and powerful Villian in the marvel universe The Kingpin. Though the Kingpins is White i still don't think you could of picked a better actor to play The Kingpin but Michael Clark Duncan. and when are they going to Make Dredevil 2. I hope they keep all of the original actors if they do make a sequel. This movie is awesome. The action is awesome the costumes are awesome and so is the story and actors.  If you have not seen this movie then you should. one thing i don't understand if the movie companies are all set on blu rays then why don't they put the special features from the two-disc special edition dvds on the blu-rays. isn't blu ray supposed to hold more and be alot better than dvd. oh, well guess you can't get everything. don't see how hard that would be. spend more money and get less. thats the only complain i have about this blu ray. i have the two-disc special edition of this movie and i want the blu ray but i'm loosing all the special features.",1475366400,,1273,4.463519313304721
