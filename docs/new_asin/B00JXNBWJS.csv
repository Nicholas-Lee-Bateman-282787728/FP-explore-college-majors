8654525,5,B00JXNBWJS,"""Art Of Darkness"" (also known as The Painter or Art Hourse Massacre) is a great slasher movie about a serial killer who lures beautiful and hot models in his studio for a photography session and ends up kidnapping and torturing them. The husband of his last victim will not surrender and will keep pushing until he discovers that behind this deranged individual there's a human trafficking case. The plot is quite conventional but effective, the direction is great. There are some extreme - gore scenes, so people into that will like that. It's good fun for a night with friends and beer, no more and no less than that. I saw it at a film festival where it won the best feautre award.",1425340800,,684,4.569105691056911

Will this movie be for you? Hmmm...let's see. Do you like movies where serial killers are incredibly obvious yet get away with their crimes for years? Where main characters repeatedly drop weapons and could kill the killer but run away? Where a police officer finds murdered victims, evidence of a conspiracy with several persons being involved, but never calls for backup? Do you like amazing and stupid coincidences between characters in an attempt to force drama or suspense into a ridiculous story? Then you will probably like this movie.

Funniest moments:

Heroine escapes (drops weapon, could have killed evil guy), car stops for her, she repeatedly tells driver ""he is going to kill me,"" driver just sits in car on deserted country road asking her if she is okay. Lunatic in blood covered surgery suit and mask, holding sledgehammer, appears in front of car--- wait for it --- driver asks pleading woman who repeatedly has said ""he's trying to kill me"" if ""this guys with you?"" then GETS OUT OF THE CAR TO QUESTION THE MANIAC AND HAS HIS HEAD BASHED IN. Hilarious!

Runner up for funniest moment: Everyone is dead after being brutally tortured, hero and heroine have been beaten and maimed, he looks at her belly and somehow magically knows she is pregnant, they lovingly look into one-another's eyes and hug...the end. Comedy at it's finest!

Seriously, though, this is not a ""so bad it is good"" movie. Just bad. Way bad. However, there is a lot of gore, if that's all you care about and do not mind a big plate of stupid served up with your eye gouging.",1415059200,2,1582,4.759124087591241
