8250670,4,B0013FCOPU,"I really liked Dragonaut. The animation is good, the story is fun, and there are plenty of great characters. It's not an entirely original story, but it's different enough to be interesting. what drives this anime is the strong bonds that the characters form with one another. The main character, Jin, and his girlfriend, Toa, are really cool characters. You really want them to find happiness. The animation in this series is impressive. There are lots of bright colors. It kind of has the Heroic Age vibe to it. If you have seen Heroic Age and liked it you will certainly like Dragonaut. If you haven't I recommend Dragonaut to any anime fan. It's well worth the reasonable price.",1354665600,,682,4.739495798319328
