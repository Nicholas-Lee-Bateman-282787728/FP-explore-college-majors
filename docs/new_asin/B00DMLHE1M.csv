8594532,5,B00DMLHE1M,"I found out about the CARE channel while my parent was in the hospital for an extended amount of time. We were flipping around the channels and discovered the beautiful videos and relaxing music on the TV in the room. It was so soothing and we kept it on the channel during the whole stay in the hospital. Then, recently for me while I was in the hospital, I searched out the channel and found it again to my delight at a whole different hospital! It ran 24 hours although went into night-time ""stars"" late at night into early morning.

I jumped on Amazon I found the DVDs for sale. I was so happy to find them since I had a several week recovery at home and able to have these beautiful images and music in my room at home! I also continue to play the videos in my home after my recovery during my yoga practices (which is wonderful!) and in my living room as an alternative to regular TV.

So, I got all 3 of the DVDs that they publish:
1. Enduring Spirit&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/C-A-R-E-at-Home-Enduring-Spirit-DVD/dp/B00DNAZVPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">C.A.R.E. at Home - Enduring Spirit DVD</a>

Maine, Stanley and Redfish Idaho, Acadia Maine, Sundial Utah, Lake Superior Michigan, Wasatch Utah, Miners Beach Michigan, Alpine Loop and Snake River Utah, Sable Falls Michigan, Sawtooth Idaho, Bridal Veil Utah.

Each one is unique and I love having all three so I can rotate them. Each one runs a little under and hour, so this gives me 3 hours of enjoyment without repeats (although I love replaying them and waiting for certain ""favorites"" on each video). I think my favorite DVD is Enduring Spirit because it has more water scenes than the others. If you're only going to buy one it would be that one (if you like water a lot), but I really recommend all three if you can afford it. I swear it helped so much with my recovery! Well worth the money!

The scenes for each location vary from 3-7 minutes for each. They are moving video not still pictures. They are peaceful, slow moving and include landscape scenes and close ups of things like flowers, water, vegetation, and even animals. The video is of very high resolution and very colorful. I like to turn down the music so it's faint although the composition and quality is very good if you want it up louder. All the scenes are in very peaceful soothing settings and the background music is beautifully composed by the authors of the video (Susan Mazer and Dallas Smith). I only wish there was a bit of nature sounds mixed in like birds singing, water flowing, ocean sounds, etc.

You can see a video snippet on the CARE website healinghealth dot com. You can even download beautiful high resolution images that you can put on your computer, iPad, or smartphone.

I love this 3-DVD set and will get years of use out of them!",1396483200,4,3785,5.406779661016949
8594533,5,B00DMLHE1M,"I have dvd's & blu-rays`but I have never seen such beautiful video on my 10' beaded screen or heard such clean audio on my 5 x 140W sound system!

These are truly magnificent productions in sight and sound.

I first saw the C.A.R.E. channel while in hospital. What a thrill to have now at home!",1381708800,,294,4.327272727272727
