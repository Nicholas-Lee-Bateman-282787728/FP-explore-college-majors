It was mostly by chance that I was involved in their projects -  I knew both men when they lived here in Pittsburgh for a short time in the mid-seventies. And yes, it's true - Roger would develop his film in his bathtub. Such an original creative. He was also employed as a silent film accompanist, and was quite good. I was attempting to develop my Charlie Chaplin impersonation at that time, so we had much in common. Ondine was an outrageously amusing character, and his legend preceded him. I was saddened to read tonight that both died young. They were full of life every day and each day was an art work...in fact, just living was art for them. They were very inspiring people. RIP, Gentlemen. I'm glad your films are still out in the world.",1519257600,,1046,4.5638297872340425
