8409969,4,B003Z7SF4S,"Pilar (played by the attractive Carmen Maura) is a widow living a contented life somewhere in the Canary Islands.  She has a good relaitonship with her daughter and several friends.  However, her son in law is an irritant and, beyond that, she believes that he is cheating on her daughter.  So distressed that she considers suicide, she is ultimatley persuaded by her friends that another solution is at hand--hire a hit man to eliminate the son in law.  The hit man, played very well by Federico Luppi, is violent, but somehow urbane and seems to have a nice and otherwise tranquil upper-class life.  This tranquility is disturbed by the arrival of his son from Argentina, who having failed at many other things in life, decides that he has a vocation to enter the family business.  I won't tell you more about the plot to avoid spoiling the fun.  My wife and I enjoyed watching the film.  Some critics have panned it and, no doubt it could have been improved with better dialog, but it is fun nonetheless.  And Carmen Maura and Federico Luppi absolutely carry the movie.  The director, Gerardo Herrero, is a major producer of latin films, including Hormigas in La Boca, Luna de Avellaneda, and El Secreto de sus Ojos.  I have the feeling that this movie would have been laugh out loud funny had it been written by Juan Jose Campanella (who worked with Herrero on other films).  Film is in Spanish with English subtitles.",1368489600,,1422,4.689516129032258
