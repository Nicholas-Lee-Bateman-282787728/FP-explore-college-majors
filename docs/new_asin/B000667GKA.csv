2169790,5,B000667GKA,"This product explains things that most other products ""assume"" you already know.  this is nice for beginners.",1142380800,27,109,5.411764705882353
2169791,4,B000667GKA,This is a very good toning DVD.  I wish it had an aerobic component like some other DVDs on the market.,1141776000,17,103,3.9047619047619047
2169792,5,B000667GKA,Out of all the tapes this one gave me the most results in actually elongating my body.. liz explains how to use proper postures to avoid neck pain.. I originally tried tapes off of those listed suggestions. The other tapes I tried were ok but found I really listened with Liz's tips on form. This made all the difference and is the best for understanding ball!! thanks,1111536000,94,368,4.507462686567164
2169793,5,B000667GKA,Get a ball!! Buy this DVD.  It is fantastic!!!  Make sure you  buy a ball according your height.,1106352000,50,96,4.222222222222222
2169796,5,B000667GKA,"Great DVD. It is easy to follow and I was surprised to find how much it worked my body. The moves are nice and smooth, slow and concise. I recommend, especially for anyone who is just getting back into the workout game.",1388275200,,219,4.238095238095238
2169797,5,B000667GKA,"THIS IS LIZ GILLIES I AM PROUD OF THIS VERY BEGINNER TAPE FOR THE FUNCTIONALITY IT SUGGESTS. SOME OF THE EXCERCISES WILL FEEL EASY IF YOUR DROPPING YOUR WEIGHT INTO KNEES AND BALL INSTEAD OF USING THE BALL AS AN AWARENESS TOOL TO FIND THE 3 DIMENSIONAL COORDINATION MUSCLES NEED TO BE MOST USEFUL AND MAKE YOU FEEL LIJE YOUR WORKING HARDER, HAVING TO ENGAGE YOUR LIFTED CORE IN ORDER TO CREATE THE SPACE TO WORK IN 3 D.  WHEN I SAY CORE I MEAN AS DEEP AS THE PELVIC FLOOR TO THE CONNECTING LIFT WAY UP INTO RIB INTERCOSTALS  ANYWAY MY REASON FOR THIS IS TO LET YOU KNOW THIS IS THE SAME PROGRAM AS THE STABILITY BALL FOR DUMMIES.  THEY CHANGED TITLE AND TOOK MY NAME OFF WHEN THEY SAW I HAD WRITTEN  101 WAYS TO WORKOUT ON THE BALL,  CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH THE DUMMIES STABILITY BALL BOOK UNPUBLISHED THEN! I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE WRITTEN IT TOO!  ITS PRETTY MUCH COPIED FROM MINE ANYWAY!  THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT HAVE NEW WORKOUTS COMING SOON  SORRY FOR CAPS CANT SEE TOO WELL!",1347321600,3,984,4.281081081081081
2169798,3,B000667GKA,"The video was too slow moving for me. Not much variety in the ""workout"". It's basically the same as the poster that came with the ball.",1297900800,2,135,4.230769230769231
2169799,5,B000667GKA,"I had tried this workout a friend's house and loved the way it helped me to target certain muscles.  It goes at a slow pace, yet you KNOW you've just had a thorough workout when you're done!  Getting used to balancing on the ball really strengthens your core. My posture has improved and I am noticing definition. I have lost over 30 inches of body fat using this tape and a sensible diet.  I HIGHLY recomend it to anyone serious about re-shaping their body without having to go to a gym.",1254355200,,488,4.34065934065934
2169800,5,B000667GKA,"great product. have to be a little carefull at first, so you don't fall off. the wife loves it",1241395200,,94,4.0
2169801,5,B000667GKA,This DVD is great for the beginner. I used a ball in physical therapy and they told me I should get one at home. At first I just used the ball while watching TV - it was fun. Then I got this DVD and it was easy to understand how to do the moves but challenging enough that I felt I was actually doing something. It's slow paced so you have time to figure out where to put this foot and that hand. Good luck!,1232928000,2,407,3.8
2169802,5,B000667GKA,This is the perfect exercise video to use a exercise ball. It was recommended to me by my Dr. to help strenthen my core muscles after a back injury.,1231200000,,148,4.137931034482759
2169803,5,B000667GKA,I have a couple of For Dummies Books that are okay and this is the first video that I bought for Dummies.  It was a very good choice.  A good selection of exercises to work with and targets muscle groups.  Also has workouts that are easier/harder depedending on how good you are at them.,1230508800,,287,4.277777777777778
2169804,5,B000667GKA,"This is the best Fitness Ball DVD that I have found, and I think this workout is fantastic!!!  (Options for basic & advanced training are demonstrated on DVD).",1202688000,,159,4.678571428571429
2169805,2,B000667GKA,"I just used this tape the other day. The instructor does a good job of explaining things, and they do spell out what you are  doing very well. The only thing I didn't get out of it was a good workout. This would be fine if you are a beginner or are new to exercise, because it is helpful, but if you are used to working up a good sweat or feeling like you've really gotten a good workout, I didn't get that from this tape. So I would recommend for beginners, but not for someone who's done this for awhile.",1198627200,9,506,4.00990099009901
2169806,3,B000667GKA,"So I thought this ""Dummies"" version would be easier and I realized that I have horrible balance and this dvd didn't work for me! There were great tidbits about exercise and that was very informative.",1190937600,4,199,4.714285714285714
2169807,5,B000667GKA,"The directions for the excercises presented in this video are really easy to follow. For most exercises there are 2 levels of difficulty. One for the biginners and one for the more advanced. The tips are great too. It is like being with your own personal trainer, reminding you of the finepoints of the exercises. I also like that the video covers both upper and lower body work in one session. A great video for beginners or people not so familiar with working out on the ball.",1189296000,8,478,4.505747126436781
2169808,4,B000667GKA,It was very good for someone that needs to learn the techniques for using the exercise ball. I would say it is for beginners not intermediates.,1185062400,,143,4.538461538461538
2169809,4,B000667GKA,I am a beginning stability ball user and bought this DVD to show me some ways to use the ball. I REALLY like the moves for the lower body. I could feel it immediately and know I'll be sore tomorrow. The arm workout was okay but nothing too challenging. For whatever reason the ab workout hurt my lower back too much so I skipped that part. I admit I haven't finished the whole DVD but may just stick to the lower body moves. Just for those it's worth the price.,1179705600,,461,4.133333333333334
2169810,3,B000667GKA,"I got a good workout with this, but the instructor wasn't good at cueing, especially in the warmup. After doing it a few times though, it doesn't matter and you can go right along with her.",1175644800,4,189,4.277777777777778
2169811,4,B000667GKA,"A good workout, and a pleasant instructor. It's easy, though---perhaps too easy?---and after a couple of months of doing this workout at least once or twice a week, I'm finding there to be too much time between each exercise as she explains each one.

That said, it was a great introduction to working with the gym ball, and I really like catching her little imperfections. Definitely a thumbs-up if you're in the market for a beginning gym ball workout.",1174608000,7,454,4.746835443037975
2169812,5,B000667GKA,"After a week I really felt myself becoming stronger.  After 2 weeks, I could notice a difference in the tone of my stomach.  Can't wait to see what it's like 2 and 6 months from now.",1171152000,10,182,4.027777777777778
2169813,5,B000667GKA,"I'm in my early 30's, go to the gym 4 times a week and am in pretty good shape. At the gym I do the elliptical as well as some of the fitness (weight) equipment. I decided it would be nice to to add some variation to my routine as well as have a workout I could do from home.

I researched for a while and decided on the ball and the video ball workout for Dummies. The result? I'm VERY happy. At first I didn't think it was going to be worth the money or time- I'm used to working up quite a sweat at the gym and thought this workout might be ""too easy"" for me. Well... not so. It hurt to walk for 3 days after I did the video the first time. This tells me I was working SOMETHING that I usually didn't. It's true, it targets muscles that aren't typically ""worked out"" on traditional exercises or machines.

All in all, I really like this video. The instructor is a bit annoying but I've come across worse. It goes slowly (which is the point to get an efficient workout) and really explains how to position yourself correctly (which I find to be a downfall of a lot of the others). I'd say go for it!",1169510400,60,1101,4.0228310502283104
2169814,5,B000667GKA,"I found this workout to be challenging and effective. I'm new to fitness ball exercising and each time I've worked out with this DVD, I felt it the next day! It's easy to follow, easy to keep up with and the instructor keeps you motivated. I would recommend this DVD as a starting point to anyone that is new to fitness ball exercises.",1168300800,19,335,4.333333333333333
2169815,4,B000667GKA,"This is a wonderful DVD for starting on the exercise ball. I have been doing it for about five months regularly and am still not tired of it yet. I am ordering a new one as I have given mine to my sister, who also loves it!",1167696000,9,223,3.765957446808511
2169816,4,B000667GKA,"This is a great workout to introduce you to working with a ball. It covers a range of exercises, really focuses on your core, and includes strength training.

The only problem I had was at the end, during cool-down, the instructor doesn't hold the stretches very long. That's usually when I turn it off and do my own cool down based on her plan.

I highly recommend this DVD if you are buying a ball for the first time.",1166486400,9,419,4.291139240506329
2169817,5,B000667GKA,this video demonstrates some good exercises to do with the balance ball.  I have been very sore after doing this workout!,1166054400,4,121,4.761904761904762
2169818,4,B000667GKA,"I really like the style of this video. The instructor is very encouraging (I like how she'll tell you ""you have two more now, you're doing great!"") and clear about her instructions. She talks to you throughout and I found it very helpful; in at least one other workout video I have, I didn't know we'd switched exercises until the instructors were already in an entirely different position. She also gives helpful hints throughout.

The camera takes shots from different angles so you can tell exactly how to set up your form and how to make the movements.

I also like the breaks between exercises. It gave me time to rest for a moment and regroup. In other videos, I often find myself falling behind because they move from one exercise to another without a pause, when I could really use half a minute to catch my breath. I am also happy that after almost every set there's at least a little stretch. I find it keeps me from cramping up and allows me to keep going.

If you bought a pilates ball and have no idea what to do with it, I definitely recommend this video. Though it's ""easy"" I feel I get a very good workout with it and I am not bored with it yet.",1163030400,27,1161,4.31651376146789
2169819,4,B000667GKA,"This was my first exercise ball tape I bought.  Being a larger size person, I found that this was a help to getting started.  I can do most of the exercises right away.  I like that it has exercises with weights also.  I find this a help to getting back into shape, even with my bad back.",1160179200,16,288,4.0
2169820,4,B000667GKA,"I like this program. It is a great introducton to the ball, including proper use. I'm a beginner exerciser so this was perfect for me. I see myself being able to master this program and move on soon, and this is a good thing! Build your confidence working out, while getting in shape with this easy yet effective program!",1156982400,9,321,4.4576271186440675
2169821,1,B000667GKA,"This video covers several basic exercises you can do with an exercise ball.  I don't care for the woman who does it -- I find her personality a little annoying.  That aside, there is no way to do the exercises straight through without title segues between each position.  This makes for a long workout with too much rest between positions.  It's nice the first time through because you are just learning.  But I would have preferred an option for a traditional style video without titles and intro descriptions for each position.",1154736000,29,529,4.769230769230769
2169822,5,B000667GKA,"I have never done a ball workout so I tried Ball for Dummies. It is easy to follow and will really give results. I felt toner and trimmer within one month. The best size of the ball to use depends on your heighth and the exercise. I use the larger ball and I skip a few of the exercises. But overall, the DVD is really good and I even bought the DVD as a gift to a friend.",1154649600,13,372,3.782051282051282
2169823,5,B000667GKA,"This is the first 'for dummies' workout that I have bought and I really like it.  It's a good dvd if you haven't done a ball workout before.  You focus on stability and balance and building up your core strength.  But because you use weights too, you also get good toning for the whole body.  They use your regular overhead presses and ab work too.  She gives you optional moves if you want to make it harder or easier and tells you what not to do wrong.

Don't be fooled by thinking you can't get a good workout from a stability ball.  You will totally feel this the next day and you will be surprised with exactly how many muscles you in fact worked.  I really like this a lot.",1153526400,60,679,4.1692307692307695
2169824,4,B000667GKA,"This DVD is great and very user friendly for the novice using a fitness ball, yet the routine is still challenging. As you go through the routine, the exercises are simple but they always offer you a more challenging version of the same exercise for those more advanced users of the fitness ball.  I would definitely recommend this as a good, solid exercise routine and to build confidence in the program.  I will continue with this one but ready to purchase others too in order to mix my routine up.  Thank you.",1153267200,10,512,4.543478260869565
