7800502,4,1620333341,"Lily Chin shares tips on the two discs for beginner and more experienced knitters.  There is, alas, no way to find a specific area for help, instead it is like a college lecture to be watched and notes taken. This video (2013) is similar to her book, ""Lily Chin's Knitting tips & tricks, shortcuts and techniques every knitter should know (2009)"" which does have a table of contents and index to quickly find specific information. Both are very useful in their own ways.",1490140800,,470,4.662650602409639
7800503,5,1620333341,"Without question the BEST knitting class/dvd/instruction I've ever purchased (and I've bought quite a few....)  Lily Chin is the font of amazing, simple, useful, and clever knitting tips.  After the first 30 min, my head was spinning.  She removes all the jargon and just shows you exactly how to save time, increase simplicity, and produce items you will be proud to say that you made.  The instruction is up close and very clear.  She just saved me, too.

I had started a simple sleeveless top and was working on the back.  Because of another class I'd completed at Craftsy.com, I had knit a pretty good size sample to check gauge, etc.  Lily had another suggestion on how to use your gauge sample - she suggested weighing it and then using it to estimate how much yarn would be needed for your project.  I thought, that sounded like a neat idea.... So I weighed my sample and found that I was going to be ""short"" at least one skein of yarn....  Opps!!! I had been sure I had enough since I'd purchased what the pattern required, but forgot to factor in that I'd made a couple of small changes (more ease, a little longer - the kind of thing that knitters do).  So, Thank You Lily Chin!  You just saved me hours of knitting that would have ended in 3/4 of a knitted top...

I completely recommend this item and I think it's available from Interweave Press as either a download or as a DVD.  I know it's expensive but think about how much you spend on yarn!  And, sometimes Interweave has great sales.... if you're willing to wait.
EDIT:  I forgot my favorite thing!  Lily is actually wearing a beautiful handknit tunic throughout her instruction.  It's always a surprise to go through a knitting DVD or downloaded class and the instructor is there talking about knitting and how great it is to use these techniques and they NEVER wear anything knit.... That always makes me little suspicious?",1398729600,11,1894,4.56973293768546
