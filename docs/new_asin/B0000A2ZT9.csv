7995585,5,B0000A2ZT9,"I've read previous reviews of this film and wonder what in the world these folks were watching or expecting. This film takes you throught the lives of various ""bums"". You get to know each skier and what brought them to this lifestyle. The complaints that I have read that say you don't get to know the skiers could not be further from the truth. Great ski footage, excellent soundtrack and very likeable characters. (ya Johnny's a bit out there). Coming from an old ski bum (quite some time agao haha)...this is an excellent flick.",1358467200,2,531,4.659574468085107
7995586,5,B0000A2ZT9,"This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.  I don't even like to ski, but this movie can make you cry.  It is not just a ski movie; the personalities are fascinating.  All it does is follow a bunch of people who spend their time skiing and living in Whistler and living to ski, but the personalities are fascinating.  This has been running on the Documentary Channel, but it can't be found on DVD anywhere!",1185667200,,422,4.30379746835443
7995587,5,B0000A2ZT9,"I first saw it in its premier in Sundance.  Regardless of how much I love skiing, this documentary should be taught in all film schools.  It was not like medicine that you HAVE to take.  It was fantastic.  Purely artistic, and completely entertaining.  Breathtaking cinematography (I'm a musician, so a film connaisseur would love it even more).  I highly recommend it for all sports lovers, young people, sociologists, you name it.  Everyone will learn something.  A truly entertaining piece.",1109894400,4,493,5.151898734177215
