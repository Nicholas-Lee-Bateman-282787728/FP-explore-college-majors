8705659,5,B00UGPKPMC,"During World Was II a U-boat and a destroyer are in a cat-and-mouse situation to the end. The question is who the cat is and who is the mouse? They use standard clichs and extraordinary tactics; however there is not need for anything supernatural or far fetched to hold your attention. It is a battle of wits and wills between the Commanders of both vessels. We are there as they both sweat out time or take chances.

For the most part everyone is speaking English so you will not have to strain your eyes to read the small print at the bottom of the screen. Being made before CGI we will watch some battles and scenes made with the use of models.

Yes you have seen this story portrayed again in such classics as ""Das Boot"" (1982). What is more interesting is even the same dialog is played out in the movie ""Star Trek II - The wrath of Kahn"" (1982)

You will find this movie worth repeated viewing.",1500854400,,900,4.313609467455621
