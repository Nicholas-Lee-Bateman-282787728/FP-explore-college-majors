8500064,3,B006K5H27S,"This out-of-print region 2 German import is the only way to find the TV series ""Out of this World"" in any home video format .This 6-disc set is a compilation of episodes from seasons 1 & 2.

The picture quality is great . You can turn off the German subtitles and switch the audio to English very easily.

Other than being incomplete, there are two major issues with this release.

1)The original opening theme song has been replaced with a really irritating version.

2) The voice of Burt Reynolds who plays Evie's father Troy (heard coming from a cube, but never seen) has been replaced with a completely different actor. I must say it is not a good change.

It would be really wonderful if Universal would release this show in its entirety in the US with its original opening music and The Voice of Burt Reynolds.

The show really deserves a better release. In my opinion it has aged far better than ""Small Wonder.""",1501891200,3,918,4.533333333333333

8500068,5,B006K5H27S,"Out of This World is the children sci-fi comedy series which aired from 1987 to 1991. There were 4 seasons with 24 episodes to a season, totalling 96 episodes. The volume 1 DVD contains a total of 35 episodes from seasons 1 and 2. 13 episodes are missing due to copyright issues with the music used within the episode. I think almost all fans would have settled for them cutting out the music instead of cutting out whole episodes. However, that was the approach they took instead. This should really dock 1 to 2 stars off, but I am so grateful to get my hands on these 35 episodes already. The original theme tune ""Swinging on a Star"" had to be replaced by a very similar song with the same underlying tune and slightly altered lyrics. Due to complex copyrights issues, this is a common practice for DVD releases of old series.

Unfortunately, there is no volume 2 at this time, so only a little more than one-third of all the episodes from the entire series is available. I would suggest to get your hands on this DVD set if you can, because there is a chance they might never reproduce any more in future. Moreover, low demand for the DVD would also mean a greater likelihood of never seeing volume 2. Also be aware that this is a region 2 DVD can so can only play on multi-region DVD players, or play on your desktop PC/Mac using other media players such as VLC. Copyright really sucks.

As this is a German DVD, all textual material on the box and in the DVD menu are of course written in German. This isn't a problem at all. Thankfully, the English soundtrack is available, so one can enjoy the series completely. Unfortunately, there are no subtitles, English or otherwise. All in all, if you were a fan of the original series, I would highly recommend you get your hands on this while you still can, and your purchase might just spark their interest in making the second volume.

The DVD is not sold directly from Amazon US at this time. Rather than buying it from third party merchants and sellers, I decided to buy the DVD straight from Amazon Germany (www.amazon.de). The German Amazon site is exactly the same as the US site and you can log in with your existing username and password. The site is of course in German, with a bit of guess work, it is not too difficult to navigate the website. You may opt to have Google Chrome help out with the German translation if you want. Buying it straight from Amazon.de ended up being a lot cheaper. The price fluctuates constantly (are they using dynamic pricing in Germany?) but at the time of writing, it is only EUR8 which is around USD10! (I bought it two weeks ago, and it was almost twice that price at EUR15.) There is of course a EUR10 charge for shipping international, bringing the total cost to EUR 18 (around USD23). That's much less than the USD55 quoted (without shipping) from third party merchants and sellers.",1408579200,3,2881,4.483809523809524
