7872568,4,630448965X,"I've loved this show since I was a kid! (I'm twenty now) The characters are very colorful and the acting is GREAT! The Aaahh!! Real Monsters series has to be one of the most intelligent and creative cartoons to appear on Nickelodeon. It's ashame that Nick took it off air.

I took off a star only because the VHS was recorded in EP mode. Other than the poor quality, this video is a must have for all Monsters fans.

Pssst...ARM fans: please vote for a DVD release of this wonderful cartoon at the ""TVShowsOnDVD"" site. Thanks ;)",1126483200,8,528,4.43298969072165
7872569,1,630448965X,This cartoon was recorded in ep mode and is so badly done that you can hardly watch it.  It is such a shame that the people who made this tape are so cheap that they couldn't have used a better viewing mode.,1104019200,3,207,3.9285714285714284
