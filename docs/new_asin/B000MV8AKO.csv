Learning to play his music has been some real therapy for me.
For a finger picker some of it is easy & some is hard. What you really need
is a good memory so you can make all of the finger changes fluidly so that
the music just flows from one section of a song to the next... memory &
a lot of practice. Well worth the price.",1403308800,,366,3.7662337662337664
8172808,4,B000MV8AKO,"The Music played on this particular DVD is a fusion of  Blues, Folk and Ragtime.  It's music  that I would like to invest more into.

8172809,5,B000MV8AKO,"This DVD is filled with guitar lessons taught by Dave Van Ronk in 1993 -- it is not a concert. Most non-musicians will probably be bored by it. If you're a fan of Dave Van Ronk but aren't sure about this, then I'd like to point out that you can sample two of the song lessons on this DVD (""Green, Green, Rocky Road"" and ""Cocaine Blues"") as bonus content on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dave-Van-Ronk-in-Concert-at-the-Bottom-Line-June-2-2001/dp/B000SOHIPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dave Van Ronk in Concert at the Bottom Line June 2, 2001</a>; a tab booklet with both of those songs is included.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dave-Van-Ronk-Memories-in-Concert-1980/dp/B0001I2BQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dave Van Ronk Memories in Concert 1980</a>&nbsp;is another concert currently available. I highly recommend both for guitarists and non-musicians. They are great performances all around and offer clear shots of what he's playing on the fretboard for interested guitarists.

Now, back to this DVD...

For each lesson he usually:

- Tunes up and/or talks about the tuning.
- Plays and sings the song at regular speed.
- Slowly walks you through the song by each chord (zoomed in camera on the fretboard).
- Plays the song slowed down with a split screen (top half is fretting; bottom is picking).

He also gives advice on how to play in general, and throws in remarks and brief stories.

He teaches with a capo on his guitar in different positions throughout, so I recommend having one.

A booklet of tabs for each song is included.

The songs:

1. Down South Blues (not a lesson; opens with the credits)
2. Green, Green, Rocky Road
3. Kansas City Blues
4. Sportin' Life Blues
5. Sunday Street
6. Spike Driver's Moan
7. That Will Never Happen No More
8. Midnight Hour Blues
9. Cocaine Blues
10. Down South Blues
11. St. James Infirmary (instrumental version) (not a lesson; closes the DVD)

Simply put, this is a goldmine for guitarist fans of Dave Van Ronk.

For more guitar lessons taught by Dave, you can get tabs and audio lessons for all of these songs (except ""Down South Blues"") and more from both of the Mel Bay book/CD combos --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blues-and-Ragtime-Fingerstyle-Guitar/dp/0786659270/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blues and Ragtime Fingerstyle Guitar</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Folk-and-Blues-Fingerstyle-Guitar/dp/0786659262/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Folk and Blues Fingerstyle Guitar</a>.

8172810,5,B000MV8AKO,"For the Van Ronk fans out there, a must have.  He has two other instructional books available, both recommended. Van Ron had a way of imitating others staying true to the intent of the original but making it his own.  This video tome will give you a window into that style.  Buy it by all means.",1273968000,4,295,4.232142857142857
