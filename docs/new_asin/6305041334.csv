989048,4,6305041334,I had heard a lot about this movie and finally went to Blockbuster and rented it.  It was great. The actors were great especially the actor who played Victor and the actress who played Vanessa.  They were awesome.  I  loved the fact that one of my favorite authors Eric Jerome Dickey wrote the  story for this film.  I hope to see more from Craig Ross and these talented  actors.  Peace!,954547200,10,387,4.428571428571429
989049,2,6305041334,"Cappuccino has style;I loved that it was filmed in black and white. I also liked James Black and would love to see more of him in better movies. Angelle Brooks is another actress who I thought was great.  Now here is why  I didn't care for this one: I've already seen this kind of plot twists in  ""The Last Seduction"", ""The Rich Man's Wife"", and ""  The Usual Suspects"", and it's getting very old. There were some smart  lines, but most of them seemed like it was ripped out of pages of a bad  porno script; I rolled my eyes so much from Victor and Cappuccino's  dialouge that I got a headache. The events in the story was corny when it  was ment to be suspenseful and Jennifer Lee, the title character,was awful  in her role!  I understand that it was a low budget picture, but I still  felt as though Craig Ross had on too many hats for this movie and should  have waited and saved up more money to at least hire someone else to direct  it. I think that this is Craig Ross's first movie, and do I see some  potential. ( Spike Lee's first movie was 'She's Gotta Have It', but he came  a long way since that bomb.)I will be there for Ross's next effort.",949276800,4,1152,4.172727272727273
989050,5,6305041334,I am an black indie filmmaker and moviegoer who is thoroughly tired of black gansta movies and stereotypical comedies.  So I am very pleased to say that Cappuccino is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a shame that  it didn't make it to the theatres. I hope that it will.  This is just the  type of movie that Black audiences have longed for.  This is moviemaking at  it's best. Buy this movie.  You won't be sorry.,934588800,17,427,4.197530864197531
989051,5,6305041334,"This movie is noir at its best.  The plot is totally captivating.  Following the lead character's (James Black)seek what he had lost at home only to spiral into his own destruction was awesome.  Craig Ross's  direction is stylish,lean, and superb. James Black and Angelle Brooks and  (the fine actress who plays cappuccino)work well together to make the story  plausible.  It combines mind games, marital issues, lust, and murder in a  smooth and easy fashion.  The sex scene in the shower is some lust to be  reckoned with!
This movie has more twists than Clinton's tenure as prez!  Just when ou think you know what's up, you realize YOU DON'T KNOW JACK!  The ending is a neutron bomb!",921628800,7,686,4.769230769230769

7885218,5,6305041334,"This has got to be one of the best movies that I have ever seen. This movie had me on pins and needles the first time I saw it, and it gets better everytime I see it. From the first frame to the last the twists and turns in the plot are amazing, and it should not be watched alone. Get this video tape and I can promise there will be no disappointments",1038700800,6,352,3.835616438356164
7885219,4,6305041334,This was a good movie.  It was just like reading one of his books.  It will make anybody think before making a crazy mistake.  I give a 4.5.  Check it out.,1011571200,,155,3.903225806451613
7885220,5,6305041334,"If you're looking for million-dollar special effects, look for somethng else. If it's Oscar-award-winning acting, this movie is not for you.  But Cappuccino proves to be a tremendous work of art, not to mention the perfect holiday gift for the cultured consumer.
Any and all loyal Eric Jerome Dickey follwers will easily recognize the story as his work - identified by the house for sale, the hairbrush, the ever-twisting plot, and finally the SHOCKING ending. His work clearly outshines everything else necessary to put this movie together, but then again this movie reviewer is a bit biased toward the author (not to mention ignorant of the director, producer, and actors).
One drawback of seeing Dickeys work on film as opposed to the page is that you don't get his vivid verbal description of the love/lust scenarios between his characters. Seeing them actually ""gettin' it on"" is actually a disservice to the imagination. However, seeing his art on film does allow the viewer to pick up the minor details you missed the first time - the minor details that normally take a second and third reading to find... all you have to do is rewind.",978912000,3,1142,4.88659793814433
7885221,3,6305041334,"I rented this little movie largely because i read on it's cover that it was written by Erick Dickey. Yes, the writer of sisters and lovers and the more recent cheaters. The movie is kind of like a black low budget version  of Body Heat  with a few twists.  Overall I found it rather entertaining.  It's in Black and white so it really has that  film nior vibe going it. It  was a largely black cast, something you rarely see in any film noir movies.  The directions wasn't really thrilling but competent, the acting was  average. There were no name stars in it. but it really didn't hurt the  story that much. The script written by Erick Jerome Dickey wasn't too bad.  The dialogue was pretty sharp and there were only a couple of plot holes in  it but nothing major. It's worth a good rent for a couple of dollars.",964483200,,815,4.33112582781457

7885223,4,6305041334,"The best way to describe this movie is a low budge ""A Thin Line Between Love and Hate"" without the laughs.  Actually, this movie is pretty damn scary.  It scared the dog out of me.  Well, for a few days  anyway.  This is a must see for all male playas.  And a word of advice, DO  NOT, I repeat, DO NOT WATCH THIS WITH YOUR WOMAN!  As a matter of fact,  DON""T LET HER SEE IT AT ALL!",961632000,2,381,3.782051282051282
