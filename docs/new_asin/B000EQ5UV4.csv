2529530,5,B000EQ5UV4,"I didn't expect Shakespeare Behind Bars to be as entertaining as it was.  Not only is this fine documentary film a compelling argument on behalf of drama as a rehabilitative tool in prison, but it is also a welcome reminder of our universal foibles and  potential for redemption.  Shakespeare Behind Bars will change any preconceived notions you may have about criminals because these Shakespearian actors are as wise and perceptive and articulate as any actor on or off Broadway.  Highly recommended.",1151107200,7,501,5.148148148148148

2529540,5,B000EQ5UV4,This is a fabulous film that looks at the power of Shakespeare - men examine their crimes and the concept of forgiveness through acting out The Tempest.  Powerful!,1377820800,,163,4.821428571428571
2529541,4,B000EQ5UV4,"It reinforces that Shakespeare is relevant today and indeed in every era. Putting on his plays seems to be a wonderful outlet and a way to self-understanding. These men in the program are at base like all men, with good and bad traits, only in their cases most of them committed murder, and are paying for their crimes. Still, one feels their humanity and cares, and so when Sammie did not make parole after 19 years, I felt for him.
Kudos to the director who leads these men and helps  them confront the characters and themselves.",1368316800,,531,4.53125
2529542,4,B000EQ5UV4,"I had heard a radio program about prisoners performing Hamlet behind bars.  I understood the story of Hamlet in a way I had never considered, as a story about crime and punishment.  On one level this movie demonstrates the lasting power of Shakespeare's words and the ability to change lives.  On another level, the movie can't avoid the question of crime and punishment in society.  Should prison be a dehumanizing, punishing experience or should it rehabilitate to integrate the prisoners back into society?  The serious crimes the profiled prisoners committed were often caused by a hair-triggered emotion, and possibly a ""perfect storm"" of personality conflict.  Will the experience of Shakespeare alone prepare them for making better decisions?  I think not.  The support network they have outside the prison walls will serve them during the tough transition into a judgmental society.  That being said, learning and performing Shakespeare can only help them empathize more, analyze and process their own feelings, and give them tools to cope along the way.  It certainly can't hurt.",1365811200,,1088,5.273255813953488
2529543,5,B000EQ5UV4,Amazing story letting the viewer get a glimpse of the heart and humanity of people who are too often regarded as less than human on the basis on their performance in life.  Also a great tribute to the power of the creative arts in transforming lives and bringing meaning and healing to the broken and down-trodden.  A powerful illustration of the social and human costs of rampant dysfunction within families and our society at large.,1365465600,,434,4.773333333333333

2529545,5,B000EQ5UV4,"If I weren't a Shakespeare lover, or didn't even like the play The Tempest, I would still deeply appreciate this film.  It documents the creative process of inmates as they produce a play, but it is the emotional process as they deal with working together, baring themselves, and seeking forgiveness-- in the play and personally, from themselves and from society-- that is especially poignant.

Shakespeare would heartily approve of the film, which humanizes a group of men who are otherwise marginalized by society.  They are the monster Caliban, and their stories demand attention if not sympathy.  Turn some of these guys into dukes or kings and their stories are as complex, dramatic, and provocative as any of the bard's best villians or heroes.

If the study of literature is the practice of empathy, this fim is quite suitable in an English classroom.  I show it after The Tempest, but I'd also show it beforehand, or in conjunction with any play if only to prove to my reluctant inner-city students that Shakespeare is still relevant.  It also brilliantly demonstrates the healing power of art.  But truly, the film goes far beyond implications for its literary subject matter.  Just watch it.

2529547,5,B000EQ5UV4,"This moving documentary focuses on a program for inmates in a Kentucky prison which allows incarcerated men to express themselves through the roles in Shakespeare's plays. The troupe produces ""The Tempest,"" their seventh play in as many years. In interviews and behind-the-scenes glimpses, it becomes clear that the play serves to catalyze these men to search deeply to discover the reasons that they committed murder, rape, or robbery, and to try to find forgiveness and redemption.  I found their capacities as actors impressive and their life situations deeply tragic.  I believe that this program and others like it need to be the direction in any system of true rehabilitation.",1353110400,,682,5.247706422018348
2529548,4,B000EQ5UV4,"I had to watch this for one of my classes in college and thought it was going to be a boring Shakespeare rendition. But, I was surprised when it turned out to be the story of the lives of several inmates at a prison as they put on their own performance of The Tempest. It is a documentary and I actually was interested the whole time and didn't want to turn it off. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a different take on a classic idea.",1336694400,3,461,4.076923076923077

Let your fears and weaknesses go. That's what I call this documentary. Communication is the first thing we need to learn as human beings and learn how to be honest with one another.

We have to learn to listen and refuse to reject people who are hurting before they do something that will cause them to end up behind bars.

A MUST SEE!",1335139200,3,499,4.413043478260869
2529550,5,B000EQ5UV4,"Shakespeare fans, sociology buffs, Tempest enthusiasts, school teachers, college professors - watch this, and watch it right now. It's one thing to read enriching commentaries on Shakespeare's works by the over-privileged, highly educated crowd - but it's much more rewarding to hear it straight from the mouths of murderers, rapists, drug dealers and worse. If ever there was evidence to prove how multi-dimensional and deeply human Shakespeare's characters are, this is it.

And of all of the Bard's works, perhaps The Tempest is the most suiting for this documentary. There are the obvious themes of forgiveness and virtue, difficult relationships with parents, power, deceit, and not to mention the fact that the entire play takes place on an island, far away from civilization. The inmate who plays Miranda is particularly touching in his ability to see how her life relates remarkably to his own. This is something Shakespeare no doubt would have liked to see--an understanding that we are not one sex or another, but human. The Caliban is also inspiring, as he battles with the identity of a ""monster"" and how that label is in many ways misleading.

Once again Shakespeare proves to be permeable, timeless, and transcendent. Many scholars have tried to articulate this message and many people understand it, on some basic level, to be true, but nothing--that I've seen, anyway--has been able to capture it all so simply and beautifully as in this little documentary about a group of prisoners who perform a play.",1322092800,,1519,5.120967741935484
2529551,5,B000EQ5UV4,"I have to say that this documentary is very well thought out to the last clip. As for me, I am not experienced with prison life or what it is about but this movie truly educates you on the lives and mindsets of prisoners' lives. I have never particularly been tolerant of people who don't follow by the rules of society but ""Shakespeare Behind Bars"" has enlightened me with a whole new understanding. The program is a mind altering experience for prisoners in the fact that they learn things about themselves that they never understood before playing the Shakespearean character and perhaps this is the road to healing and recovery. I say watch this documentary because you will walk away with a whole new understanding of the prisoner's world and perhaps your own.",1321574400,,765,4.7593984962406015
2529552,5,B000EQ5UV4,"Watched the video after having been to a few SBB performances (probably not the usual order of doing things!) and so it was rather surreal seeing men who I've met, but seeing them years ago, in the same surroundings, etc. The movie was enjoyable and unexpectedly emotional for me, and for the men too I think. A great example of how life (theirs) imitates art (Shakespeare). I heartily recommend. It's an insight to both Shakespeare and to the hearts and lives of people. I wish every performance they did had a movie about it. I would watch each one!",1298419200,,551,4.575757575757576
2529553,5,B000EQ5UV4,"I am an educator teaching Adult Basic Education to Inmates at a State Prison. This movie was fantastic on three levels: the experience of watching Inmates engaging in the learning of The Tempest, watching as the film humanizes the featured Inmates and their day to day struggles in their everyday lives in the environment of a Maximum security prison, and finally, the amazing message of redemption of these Inmates as they grapple with the reality of the horrific natures of the crimes they have committed. One interview in particular with inmate playing Prospero in ""The Tempest"" has an emotional breakdown as he describes his crimes (he has murdered someone), trying to hold back tears and his regret over the horrific nature of his crimes. It is an extraordinary moment. And, in some ways, that is the true genius of the documentary. Every one of these men, regardless of their past sins (some of which are incredibly horrific), are allowed moments to really humanize them. The film does not only categorize them as murderers to the viewers. These are human beings and very quickly does the audience learn to feel for them and hope for the best for these men. As an educator working in much the same environment, I see these same struggles in my own students, making this film extraordinarily touching. I cannot recommend this film highly enough. If you get the chance to see it, you will find yourself incredibly moved and touched. See this documentary. It could very well change your mind in regard to the value of redemption and the necessity of education among inmates in our prison system.",1288915200,5,1598,4.857142857142857
2529554,3,B000EQ5UV4,"The thing that sticks most in the viewers' minds is that many of these prisoners are actually deeply introspecting themselves. They are not the mallgoing capitalistic zombies that populate the real world. Of course, they really need to introspect more than the unincarcerated. Yet, this introspection does not inhabit the film, itself. By that I mean that the film never really explores the effectiveness of the program, merely having an addendum that claims the program has been effective. While I understand Rogerson's aims for his film, the fact that the film displays skepticism re: the individual prisoners, yet seems to show no such skepticism toward the whole program, is one of the reasons that the claims of dimwitted liberalism have been hurled against the film.

  Another thing that prevents this film from engaging more deeply than its probably should is that it is a no frills documentary. The cinematography is rather pedestrian- the only shot that sticks in the mind is the film's ending, where, after the play, the cons are bodysearched, and they fade, one by one, from the film and hallway, as a prison guard locks the place up. The chronological structure and interviews with the individual prisoners, after brief introductions, are also rather predictable, as is the film's ending with a recap of what state of grace (or not) the prisoners featured are currently in (at least as of the DVD's 2006 release). On the plus side is some hauntingly appropriate music by James Wesley Stemple. Rarely has a documentary used music as effectively as a fictive film. Perhaps only Ken Burns' The Civil War surpasses the music in this film. And, it should be noted that music is present in perhaps only 10-15% of the film, so that when it is deployed, it is in moments of supreme synaesthesia.

  The DVD is shown in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and contains extra features, such as deleted scenes, more play footage, updates on the prisoners, and three audio commentaries- two with the program director, Curt Tofteland and prisoners, and one with Rogerson and Spitzmiller. The first commentary has Jerry `Big G' Guenthner, Floyd Vaughn (a prisoner whose appearance in the film is rather brief), and Tofteland, and it is a mediocre commentary. Too much of it involves the prisoners merely marveling at doing a commentary, or pointing out old pals they've left behind, or have been left behind by. The commentary was done in 2006. Occasionally, Tofteland gets in a good observation, but dead air and too much minutia make this commentary not a prize winner. The second commentary features Hal Cobb and Leonard Ford, as well as Tofteland. It's a might better, and one gets more inside into why Ford was sent to the hole, how it was based upon false information, which led to his transfer from Luckett, but also on how the lie precipitated Ford's acceptance and admission of his pedophilia. However, while the scene of Ford's admission is praised, in fact, the viewer has no real idea whether or not the `conversion' is genuine, despite the pleadings of Cobb and Tofteland. Yet, his case, oddly, makes a compelling argument for a third way between outright punition and rehabilitative laxity. By far, the best commentary is that of the husband and wife film duo. Yes, they drone on a bit too much of the `truth' of this or that moment, even when it is obvious that the con is in full con mode, but they do give informative insights into scenes and the making of the whole film.

  I am hardly of the bleeding heart liberal persuasion, but the film does make a strong case for needed reform in out penal system, as well as better models to follow than the current parole system (the scenes of Sammie Byron's denial of parole are very affecting, and, given the glimpses we see of him in performance, it's hard to believe that he could be acting as he does to convince the viewers that he is a man of passions, when he's, at best, a barely mediocre stage actor), for it shows how the differences between prisoners and layfolk are not always those of kind, but more often those of degree. That this is also a major theme of The Tempest is, well....you know. Shakespeare Behind Bars breaks no new boundaries in its art form, and is not a particularly profound work of art, but it is a quality piece of film that has its moments. Prospero knows.",1283299200,3,4337,4.764314247669773
2529555,5,B000EQ5UV4,"Movie reviews get swamped in jargon.  ""Breathtaking.""  ""Stunning.""  ""Deeply moving.""  These get used so often that they become cliches... and these phrases all apply to this film, so I'm usin' 'em anyway.  I watch a lot of movies, but few move me to watch to show it to everyone I know.  This is a richly human film that touches on these lives, these regrets, and these possibilities with a deftness that never overwhelms the truly liberating power of art, theatre, education, language, and storytelling.  I don't want to spoil any more.  This is THE movie to show anyone who thinks that Shakespeare is irrelevant, and I can think of few films better for getting discussions started with friends, parents, or kids.",1264377600,3,714,4.8429752066115705
2529556,5,B000EQ5UV4,"Great case study example of how acting Shakespeare can have a liberating effect even on those whose freedom is circumscribed.

2529557,5,B000EQ5UV4,"This documentary is a remarkable achievement in itself, managing to capture the 9-month process of producing a full-length Shakespeare play behind bars, while revealing in depth many of the inmates who participate in the production. Assembled from hours of footage into a single, coherent narrative, the film challenges nearly every preconceived notion an audience might have about prisoners serving time for violent crimes - as well as the environment in which they spend the months and years of their sentences. And it shows again the power of the collaborative enterprise of drama in transforming and sustaining the lives of those who perform it, whether professional or amateur.

Emotions run high in the film - and there are moments of comedy and humor - as the men allow us to see them almost as deeply as they see themselves, in a life-long process of recovering lost integrity, lost dignity, and lost identity. It is as though the magnitude of their crimes has forced them to confront themselves in ways that we in the audience have seldom if ever had to. Meanwhile, despite the increasing depth of self-knowledge, the great dilemma for them (and for us) is whether the crimes they have committed are finally forgivable. While their lives as inmates exhibit a kind of uncommon courage in the rebuilding of self-worth and character, their regret is that if they are remembered at all, it will be for the worst things they have done.

For me, this was the message that came through most clearly in the film, and the prison production of ""The Tempest"" was only an interesting and fascinating pretext for taking us to the center of this ethical conundrum. That ""The Tempest"" is finally about forgiveness rather than retribution says much about how, in this case, art makes life livable. The DVD has about 30 minutes of deleted scenes, plus three separate commentaries by the filmmakers, the director of the play, and four of the inmate performers. Maybe not surprisingly, the inmates' commentaries are by far the most interesting. The film is served quite well by the musical score, as well.",1220400000,4,2095,4.948863636363637
2529558,4,B000EQ5UV4,"Shakespeare Behind Bars explores life for a group of twenty or so inmates at Kentucky's Luther Luckett Correctional Center. For the past fourteen years director annd educator Curt Tofteland has worked with the inmates to put on a full production of a Shakespeare play. The production at issue in the movie is The Tempest. This play was chosen because of emphasis on forgiveness.

The film follows the nine month process from casting to final performance. The key in this film is the process not the final product. For it is in the process of doing the play that the inmates learn about themselves and indeed help to find forgiveness in themselves.

This is a powerful documentary that needs to be seen by educators and especially those in the corrections industry. It is about the redemptive and forgiving power of drama and art.

The version I viewed was produced by Shout Factory. It features three commentaries. The first two by Tofteland and a selection of the inmates provide valuable insight into the program and life in prison in general. The third commentary is bt film makes Hank Rogerson and Jilann Spitzmiller. Also featured are some deleted scenes and some additional performance footage.

If there is a complaint about this package it's that Shout Factory has added two non removable trailers to both the beginning and the end of the presentation. While they are interesting the first time you see them ; being forced to watch them over and over has a tendency to get annoying.

We see growing insight into each man's own humanity, self-revelation and understanding, and increased compassion for each other develop over the course of working on a play.  Although we only see glimpses of the final product, we watch the intense emotional and intellectual involvement of each inmate.  A very moving piece.

2529560,5,B000EQ5UV4,"The previous reviewer's disappointment is apparently rooted in a mistaken inference: that this documentary's title implies that it records a finished performance of Shakespeare's The Tempest by incarcerated offenders.

I have discussed the documentary with a mixed group of twenty-five offenders in an Indiana prison and they had no trouble recognizing and appreciating it for what it is.

This documentary is most impressive for its portrayal of the impact of PREPARING a Shakespearean performance on the self-understanding of the performers.  The candor and intelligence with which these incarcerated gentlemen find the connection between their struggles to pretend to be someone they're not while discovering the truth about themselves is truly astounding.  No one experienced in the myriad issues associated with ""corrections"" and offender-reentry could fail to appreciate the many small personal victories portrayed in this documentary unless they had the misfortune to view it with others not prepared to accept it for what it is.

She found it to be much more about the filmmakers than the inmates -- she thought they would at least show the inmates doing a complete scene, but while they showed them rehearsing from a distance, they never really TALKED with them or showed any of their performances for any length of time. She was very disappointed and so was I -- it's a great idea for a project, but only partially realized from the viewer's point of view.",1168905600,8,592,4.342342342342342

Tenderly directed by Hank Rogerson, copiously rich with a story of human beings finding redemption through Shakespeare's eternal art, Shakespeare Behind Bars is a one-of-a-kind jewel. By film's end, the 'bars' melt away in an ineffacable lesson about FREEDOM, miraculously enough, and very real human suffering finds a resonant voice in these prisoners who have never had one, a voice that shouts with hope.

2529564,5,B000EQ5UV4,"Shakespeare Behind Bars (dir. Hank Rogerson) cracks open the hardened shell of an audience and makes us look at the true human soul inside characters who are otherwise dismissible as ""monsters."" There is nobody I wouldn't recommend it to. So I have to limit the focus here to what was most important to me about the film and why I walked out  knowing that my life is better for watching it.

Curt Tofteland has been volunteering on a weekly basis with prisoners in Kentucky for ten years now to direct the Shakespeare Behind Bars program: 30 inmates who rehearse nine months to perform one show.  Through a friend I was given the opportunity to have breakfast with Curt Tofteland and Hank Rogerson, director of the documentary.  As I tried to hang words on what the documentary meant to me, Curt just nodded with a knowing smile.  He told me that Shakespeare isn't just a literary icon, but the writer who captured raw humanity better than anyone ever has.  Which is why he brought Shakespeare to the prisoners.

24 hours a day, 7 days a week, year after year these inmates wear a hardened mask, a false-self who feels no pain.  It's survival of the fittest and softness is not rewarded in prison.  But for the 30 inmates involved with the Shakespeare productions, honesty is a mandate.  They are cast by their peers in roles that fit their background and their crime.  In their rehearsals they push each other to go deep, to find honesty, to not act but really wear their character, which for a lot of them means wearing their own skin for the first time.  From the screen, their souls became palpable during rehearsals. I watched them discover for the first time the true man behind the label ""prisoner,"" ""deviant,"" ""convict.""

The film is breathtaking. I laughed and I cried. Then I left the theater chewing on the fact I just just laughed and cried through the struggles of men society has deemed unsafe to enjoy the freedoms I enjoy. That's a sure sign of great filmmaking.",1155081600,30,1978,4.63323782234957
2529565,5,B000EQ5UV4,"Although I am not in this documentery, I was a prisoner at Luther Luckett Correctional Complex in LaGrange, Kentucky during filming. It's almost hard for me to praise the film because I have a biased opinion. I know every one of the guys in this film personally and have experienced much of what they have. This film is about searching yourself, searching for the truth of who you really are inside. No other prison program helped me more than Shakespeare Behind Bars because for the first time in my life, I took a look at the real me. As the men in this film allow you to take a look at who they are, I challenge you to face your own personal truth just as I did while I was a member of Shakespeare Behind Bars.

You will remember this film, and if you happen to see it more than once, will appreciate the different points, parts, details and words that come through in each viewing.

It is not necessary to understand Shakespeare to understand this movie. Yet you may understand Shakespeare better after having watched it!  The play featured in the film, ""The Tempest"" has forgiveness as a theme.  I will wager that few viewers will come away from the film with their own capacities for compassion and forgiveness unchanged.

The issues are heavy; the film is not.  It's funny, well told and well timed.  The soundtrack is tasteful and non-manipulative (thank you so much for that). And there are some surprises along the way.  Just like life.

I attended a screening for educators at correctional institutions (you know, prisons) and can attest that to a person they were impressed, inspired, and wanted a copy of this film. That's a strong recommendation in and of itself.

In particular, the courage of the director/mentor in ""en-couraging"" the men will inspire any educator.  One of the most inspiring documentaries I've ever seen.",1153699200,7,456,5.394366197183099
2529568,5,B000EQ5UV4,"I saw this in a premiere showing, and bought a DVD.  it is a wonderful movie that shows how life and art can parallel and be a catalyst to learning.  As a special education teacher, I was impressed with how some of the prisoners learned a Shakespearian play despite learning difficulties.  Even more important, is how the prisoners learned about themselves through the trials and tribulations of trying to put prepare for this performance.  It is a moving film.",1153180800,5,461,4.7974683544303796
2529569,5,B000EQ5UV4,"The movie gives you a better understanding of what it means to be in prison.  Watching the changes in the actors (prisoners) through the documentary shows how drama may lead to rehabilitation. They are articulate about what got them there and are serious about their acting part in the drama. The movie is entertaining, thought provoking and extremely well-done.  It is a must-have addition to your video library.  You will want to watch it several times.",1153180800,4,455,4.9605263157894735
2529570,5,B000EQ5UV4,"I have seen this film many times. We actually have had it on DVD for a few months already. Hank & Jillian gave it to my husband who is in the documentary (Bulldog/Ariel). I knew very little about the filming of this as it was going on, and I was completely surprised when I seen it the 1st time. Wow! What beautiful work these producers did. My husband has been out of prison for close to 2 years now and has participated in a few of their Q & A sessions at some of the showings. These are real people who have made mistakes, like we all have. I wish there was more forgiveness for each of them from the parole boards first, and then when out back in society from people like you and me. I have seen amazing reactions from people after they have watched this documentary. People who have admittedly judged criminals without thinking of them as people. I dare you to see this film, and see if you don't develop some empathy for them.",1152230400,5,932,4.241573033707865

8113191,5,B000EQ5UV4,"I was kind of conflicted watching this, it made me really weigh the importance of rehabilitation and forgiveness against retribution and justice.  But by the end, I was definitely in favor of programs like this.  Even if someone does something evil, they still deserve to be treated like humans, and if they get out I think that is much better for both them and society.

I loved watching them connect to the material.  Shakespeare isn't easy, and many criminals aren't very educated, but they put a lot of effort into understanding the play and the real meaning of the words.  I definitely think this encourages empathy in them as well as contributing to their learning.",1452643200,4,671,4.8
