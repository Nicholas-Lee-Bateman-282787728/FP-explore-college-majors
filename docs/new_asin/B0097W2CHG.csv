In April, 1985 after years of dating and being great friends ""As the World Turns"" characters Bob and Kim (Don Hastings and Kathryn Hays) were married over a period of ten episodes. These shows were written by the marvelous Douglas Marland, knwon for his outstanding work on ""Another World"", ""The Doctors"", ""General Hospital"" (he created the Luke and Laura story) and ""Guiding Light"".

 The shows are uncut and feature a very young Julianne Moore in her first role as Bob's long-lost daughter.",1351036800,,583,4.82
