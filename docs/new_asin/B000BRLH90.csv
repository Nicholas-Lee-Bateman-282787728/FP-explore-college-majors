8091541,5,B000BRLH90,"They are not Mary Martin and Robert Preston but very good as well,  Hal Linden is great as usual.",1430006400,,97,4.105263157894737
8091542,2,B000BRLH90,"The talented Remick and Linden (whom I admire) cannot (for the most part) revive the moribund book, lyrics and score. Fifty minutes into the two hour production, it comes alive for a couple of segments. And Act Two is a definite improvement over Act One. But I spent far too much for this show on VHS whose principals deserved far better material.",1429747200,,347,4.612903225806452
8091543,3,B000BRLH90,Very disappointed. Quality of sound and picture is poor. The beginning of the video is missing. Starts 10 minutes into the show. Extremely overpriced. I am returning it.,1403308800,3,169,5.071428571428571
8091544,5,B000BRLH90,"So not quite Robert Preston and Mary Martin, but Lee and Hal were very enjoyable to watch. Loved the music and the acting.",1390953600,,122,4.3478260869565215
8091545,5,B000BRLH90,"I purchased this item for my girlfriend at the time, now my wife, who saw this more times than any other movie.  They rented this from the movie store and loved it so much they considered taking the hit from the fines to keep the video tape. This item arrived in great condition for it's age and we store it in a safe location.",1341187200,,327,4.109375
8091546,4,B000BRLH90,"I was surprised to see this item listed on Amazon.  I never knew it was filmed.  I have the Mary Martin/Robert Preston cast album and even though Lee Remick and Hal Linden are no Martin and Preston they pull off the tuneful and touching score (by Tom Jone and Harvey Schmidt whose big hit ""The Fantastiks"" is the longest-running off-broadway musical) very well.  The acting is very well done.  The production was directed by Marge Champion, widow of the original Broadway production director, Gower Champion and is smooth ans innovative and keeps the production flowing.  Camera woerk and sound are both excellent.  A good find for lovers of this little-known show or its stars.",1253923200,3,678,4.9035087719298245
8091547,5,B000BRLH90,"My husband and I saw the production live three times in the past 25 years, each time for an anniversary. And now we enjoy this video any time we choose. A very favorite musical treasure.",1162684800,3,186,4.3428571428571425
