7671808,2,B01C4D4Z1U,"This video is about Jewish, Land rights. it tailor-makes historical knowledge while ignoring biblical knowledge and law, in order to justify, still, taking the land they now reside in, with the help of the US. THIS is why this video IGNORES the division on Judaism between Jews and the Orthodox. The video is Pro-Jewish, without giving the entire matter a viewing. Sort of like a Pro-Muslim video only showing the peace and refusing to touch on the violence because it will cause questions
So, since the Jews CLAIM to live the letter of Gods laws, decrees and wishes, WHY did the steal the land they now occupy and try to convince the world it was divine right ? Any 10 year old child can read Genesis 15:18-21 and then look at a map and use a pencil. The problem was the US could inot invade, at the time, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt....so the Israelite decided ""This is the promised land"" and slaughtered the Arabic residents, with US and European assistance.....NONE of this is addressed in anything other than a ""God's will"" interpretation, while ignoring the bible as well as the FACTS.

Another issue I have IS the Jew/Orthodox division. GOD cast the tribes out and revoked his gift of the ""promised land"" and they were told they could NOT return until the Messiah appeared ( This is the Jewish Messiah, not the Christian one) that the covenant with God was cancelled for the most part and they were to wander the lands OUTSIDE of the promised land. The Orthodox follow this, the Jews do not. The Christians, lemmings that they are, simply soak up with the Jewish political society says and SUPPORTS a Jewish state that is one that was STOLEN under false pretenses, in order to provide a political foothold, in the middle east, for the Allied nations...nothing more. We saw it happen, half-assed I might add, with Iraq, with a different goal in mind. That goal has apparently been to destabilize the region, keeping Iran in a war against it's own religious group.

Anyway, this is a propaganda film, not a historical film. It's like telling someone you think is ignorant, the Alphabet for the 1st time, and leaving out the letters you do not like and calling it ""fact"".

2 stars for the cinematography, and audio, -3 for the orchestrated content",1462924800,3,2254,4.70126582278481

8752177,5,B01C4D4Z1U,"Thank you (!!!)...
This is a brilliant documentary, with a sharp focus and wonderfully consise analysis of how and why Israel and the Jewish people got from there to here historically, as well as precisely what the primary dangers are that exist today.
My mother's maiden name was Bergman, but her father emigrated from Germany as a lone boy in the early-mid 1930's, and the word G** was never mentioned in his house except as epithet.
I have never understood the visceral antithapy directed towards the Judaic Identity with such force and from seemingly every direction; it is so terribly misplaced. Numerically, the Jews are a tiny, so very tiny portion of world population, yet the contributions they have made and continue to make, to the larger body of humanity, is astronomical. In every field of positive human endeavor, the Jewish star burns brightly indeed... art, the sciences, medicine, music, philosophy... the contributions of Jewish origin are both vital and boundless. I can only surmise there must be some truth to the idea that mediocrity is mortal enemy of the best, prefering to be forever angry & resentful rather than muster the courage and strength to address their own failings.
My only question just now is quite simple...
Are the Jews so consistently excellent in all that they because the are G**'s Chosen people, or are they G**'s Chosen people because they are so consistently excellent?
Hmmm...

This film is so relevant to current events. It beautifully and powerfully presents a strong set of historically document facts that I suspect are unknown to many. One such example is that the Romans changed the name of Judea to Palestine to punish the Jewish people and attempt to destroy their connection to the land.

8752185,5,B01C4D4Z1U,"""Body and Soul"" seems historically accurate in light of my own readings as found in Josephus, Bible, and support from numerous references from antiquity. One academic interviewed by Dershowitz said Jews are defined by: the people, the Book, and the land, i.e. Israel.

Hitler, Stalin, and Muslims  tried to eradicate the people with partial success - e.g. the Holocaust, Soviets forbidding Jews to know Judaism, 95% of Jews fleeing hostility of Mideast Muslim countries. But the people continue.

The Book (i.e. Old Testament) is relentlessly attacked despite continuous confirmation of its historical accuracy from ancient non-Biblical records. To the contrary,purported evidence from those attacking the OT - such as claims that neither David nor Saul existed - is shown to be fake. Like the Jews, the Bible isn't going to disappear as a powerful cultural influence, either theologically or historically.

And so the land remains as the third element in destroying Jews  - take away the land and that ends Jews as a coherent people, a theme in the video. But, Muslim wars to date haven't displaced the Jews, even if destruction of Jews and Israel is one of the few topics on which all devout Muslims agree. But until Iran enters into a war of mutual annihilation with Israel, dispossessing the Jews that way, at least at the moment, doesn't seem too imminent. So short of military war, the war is being waged by rewriting the historical record to delegitimate Jewish historical claims to Israel.

Some of the historical revision as presented in the video is laughable such as the Muslim cleric who says the Jew Jesus was really a Muslim. Other attacks are classic Goebbels ""big lie"" such as the two Jewish Temples never existed, despite abundant historical affirmation for them.

But some attacks raise good questions.  Fact: the Romans expelled the Jews from much of Israel and forbade Jews from even looking toward Jerusalem even from a distance. Fact: the Romans changed the name of the land from Judea to Palestine in their effort to eradicate Jewish identity with the land.

Legal question: because Rome conquered Judea does that mean the Romans could legally do with Jewish land as they pleased? Do the spoils belong to the victor? Did Roman expulsion of the Jews and subsequent occupation by Arabs, Crusaders, Ottoman Turks, and the British terminate Jewish legal claims to the land?

The answer seems to be ""no"" as affirmed by the UN partition of Palestine. But in politics ""yes"" and ""no"" are tenuous. And so the contemporary debate on Israel's existence and Dershowitz's case.

Dershowitz is a brilliant advocate who calmly marshals his facts just like the first-class lawyer that he is. His witnesses all would be certified by the court as ""expert."" Opposing witnesses would be shown disingenuous if not absurd - the Jew Jesus was a Muslim? Really?

Anti-Isreal zealots will not be moved by his case. Pro-Israel zealots are affirmed in what the already believe. Neither change positions.

But for those examining the record, like jurors mandated to leave their prejudices outside the jury box, the film provides strong evidence for acknowledging, if not supporting, the legitimate right of Israel to exist as a Jewish nation.",1475712000,7,3237,5.050656660412758
