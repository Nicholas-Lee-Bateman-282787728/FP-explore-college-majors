8675732,3,B00N1TV6NC,"It is very hard to find good Gilbert and Sullivan DVDs.  I have not purchased this set but have most of the titles from this set from long ago, some on VHS tapes.  Some of the  performances are reasonable versions that may give a taste (but no more) of the Gilbert and Sullivan genius. Buy elsewhere but note that the Mikado version in this set, although very poor, is not the worst I have seen.",1510704000,,395,4.24
8675733,3,B00N1TV6NC,"Disappointing.  Coming from England, I assumed these were British productions.  They're not.  They're a series of PBS productions done in the United States in the 1970's.  Good productions but the remastering for putting them on DVD's was minimal and the quality suffers accordingly.",1492819200,,283,5.511627906976744
8675734,5,B00N1TV6NC,An excellent full set of Gilbert and Sullivan operas!,1482710400,,53,5.0
8675735,5,B00N1TV6NC,"The only drawback is you need an all region DVD player.  For G&S fans, I only need to say Vincent Price in Ruddigore to get your attention.  But the main reason to buy this is that it is the only DVD that includes this excellent version of Trial by Jury.  The earlier set calls itself ""the Complete Gilbert and Sullivan"", but omits Trial by Jury, and neither set has the last two G&S operettas, which are totally unavailable on DVD.",1477180800,,432,4.375
