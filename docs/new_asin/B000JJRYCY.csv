8150936,1,B000JJRYCY,"For whatever reason, Amazon wouldn't post my previous two reviews about this DVD..I dunno why, since there wasn't anything derogatory, vulgar or in violation of their policy..Whatever..Here's the revised review:

I have nothing against Kate Clinton, but she isn't funny.... This DVD is now making the rounds in the ""new 4 a dollar"" bins, which is where I found it, and like I knew it would, it's as entertaining as an obnoxious infomercial at 2am. Kate's delivery style is always off, she's not hard hitting nor outrageous. There's nothing that makes her stand out ; plus the topics here are very timely and always generic; which explains why it's only $1 now. This DVD is horrible and a waste.",1401753600,,694,4.831932773109243
8150937,1,B000JJRYCY,I remember seeing Kate in concert years ago. She was funny then but not now. In the DVD she even had to beg the audience for some response. Too long in the tooth to be funny anymore Kate. A total waste of time. After 15 minutes I took this DVD and threw it in the garbage. Pathetic.,1371686400,,282,3.9649122807017543
8150938,5,B000JJRYCY,"Kate Clinton is an astute and funny commentator. Kate rarely misses with her observations and she makes you laugh so hard you have to rewind to see what else you've missed. No sight gags here or reliance on old standards, Kate is a trail blazer and beats everyone to the punch. Her intelligence reigns over it all with a sensibility to humor that is rare and that you will want to remember for you arguments with family. DVDs like this are worth owning, because you can revisit it again and again and find something new every time.",1326672000,,531,4.484536082474227
8150939,5,B000JJRYCY,"With all the doom and gloom in this failing economy, Kate is a breath of fresh air.  Forget what George Bush has done to the country for about an hour and sit back and laugh at all of his poofahs.  She shoots it straight with a funny slant on a serious situation.  Go Kate!!!!",1235779200,,276,4.074074074074074
8150940,2,B000JJRYCY,"I love Kate Clinton.  I think she is fabulous.  However, this particular dvd left me a bit flat.  Parts of it were entertaining enough but overall I don't think it's worth the money.  I would suggest renting it first and if you like it enough then buy it.  Having said that, Kate is still one of my favorite comedians.",1205884800,2,318,4.322033898305085
8150941,5,B000JJRYCY,"Kate's DVD is the next best thing to being at one of her live concerts!! She is an impishly attractive, intelligent, provocative,  outrageous, political, and hysterically funny woman!  I was inducted into  Kate's ""fan club"" about 15 years ago by a friend who took me to one of her live concerts.  I've been ""hooked"" ever since!!

Anyone needing or wanting a laugh-out-loud-until-your-sides-ache experience should  have this DVD.  I hope this won't be her last!!! Enjoy!!!",1180396800,,471,5.2
