8617576,2,B00FPA8J0I,"There's no denying that M.M. (Erin Brown) is obvious about what she is and what she's doing, and is almost always horrible at acting, in just about every movie I've seen her in, including the non-spoof ones.  That said, there's little to no plot in any of them, and some are just confusing messes.  The earlier stuff is not even at the high school film club level, it's just like random garbage thrown against the wall.  None of it sticks.  However, some of the deleted stuff and bonus features shows us how really hot Misty is/could be.  The short subjects specifically, usually.

Not that she isn't hot in many of the scenes already, especially the ones more on the X side than on the R side.  When the scenes aren't being ruined by choppy vantage switches and bumbling obvious attempts to hide some angle or another.

If these are the versions I think they are, they're the same unrated versions you can sometimes send in coupons for from the R rated ones. Unrated softcore non-explicit scenes that are just more of the R rated stuff that are longer.  R, X, unrated.  It's difficult to tell with the way these are marked and marketed though.

In any case, that would mean that I've seen both Vampire Vixens and Mummy Raider from this set; the unrated versions at least.  Are they the same as the ""Euro"" versions?  Most likely.  If so, I didn't see much if any difference between these and the R versions.",1267056000,,1407,4.531746031746032
8617577,4,B00FPA8J0I,"Let's be honest. We're not buying these movies for how great they are. We're buying them because we love Misty Mundae. These are longer versions of the movies available in the States. Longer in that they have more nudity. And that means more Misty showing off how pretty she is. Plain and simple.

So yes I'm pleased.",1267056000,,317,4.56140350877193

8617579,5,B00FPA8J0I,"I highly recommend this movie collection of several ""classic"" Misty Mundae films from Seduction Cinema.  These flicks are extended european releases that have a lot of extras and it comes on three DVDs and a very nice booklet.  If you're a big Misty fan then this collection is an essential!

Highly recommended",1233360000,,311,4.9423076923076925
8617580,5,B00FPA8J0I,"There are 4 movies in this collection, and each has erotic moments. I have seen some of the other movie offerings in this category, and these are better than most. Just the doctor office scene in Roxanna, and the phone sex scene in Vampires make this collection worth the price. Enjoy some fantasy with Misty Mundae and the other lovely ladies!",1194220800,2,344,4.655737704918033
8617581,1,B00FPA8J0I,Not worth the money. Only the fact that I would only get back half my money stopped me from sending it back. The music stank and was used too much instead of the real sounds and the dialoge. Don't waste your time.,1194134400,,213,4.095238095238095
8617582,5,B00FPA8J0I,"Basically, every Misty vehicle I've seen is quite poor in terms of quality. You watch them for her - she's always cute, and often funny. These are more explicit versions of her films, meaning the editing disregards pacing for extended raunch. The Mummy film here is particularly eyebrow-raising in that sense. Don't trust the low ratings for this one, none of her films deserve high ratings in the conventional sense.",1172448000,19,417,4.9714285714285715
