5683210,1,B00BZW5V6U,"I've used Amazon since 1997. And this is the first time I'll be exercising my right to return something. This is NOT the product I saw described when I purchased pre-sale. I knew immediately when I saw the teeny-tiny text at the very bottom of the poor quality, blurry DVD jacket: ""unauthorized"".

This schlock belongs on an NYC street corner.

Don't get duped.",1370822400,53,361,4.714285714285714
5683211,1,B00BZW5V6U,"It's basically 2 interviews from a couple years ago on YouTube. The narration is by some robot sounding woman and taken from Wikipedia...there is nothing about her past or Liz grant. No wonder this is unauthorized - it's terrible. It's $8.46 for a reason. Whoever made this should be ashamed - a movie isn't silent music video clips attached to a couple interviews. If its the ""greatest story never told"" (such an amazing title) why don't they tell the story in the video?.",1370736000,70,473,4.710843373493976
5683212,1,B00BZW5V6U,"I cannot even imagine how this is being sold on Amazon. It basically is two of Lana's interviews available on YouTube from 2011, with a useless narration of the biographical facts of her life (taken from Wikipedia). The video background has no music so you don't hear any of her songs in this 25 minute abomination. Avoid, avoid!!",1370649600,130,330,4.706896551724138
5683213,3,B00BZW5V6U,"it was nice, but I kinda felt it would be a better DVD, with more scenes..But it was worth the price if you're a lana lover",1380499200,3,123,3.769230769230769
5683214,2,B00BZW5V6U,"If you are a Lana Del Rey fan, you might want to avoid this stinker. It is poorly done and boring. Lana does appear in the DVD which is why I gave it two stars, but that doesn't make it worth buying. It's rambling and tedius. I'm waiting for a legitimate DVD release next time.",1379548800,5,277,4.054545454545455
5683215,1,B00BZW5V6U,I bought this because I was high on Lana del Rey's music.  This DVD has nothing to do with her.  She didn't make it.  It's fan made and a compliation of interviews you could find on youtube.  I'm sorry I wasted my money on it.,1378166400,6,226,3.9555555555555557
5683216,1,B00BZW5V6U,"I AM SO GLAD I READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING
WHEN I FIRST SAW THE DVD ADVERTISED FOR PRE ORDER I COULDN'T WAIT, GLAD I DID THO
LOVE LANA, GOT ALL HER MUSIC PAST AND PRESENT, SAW HER SING AT MANCHESTER,ADORE HER
BUT WONT BE BUYING THIS",1375833600,5,235,4.0212765957446805
5683217,1,B00BZW5V6U,"This is a really horrible dvd. There are two interviews that are available online from 2011 with a narration of information known to anyone who hasn't been living under a rock for the past two years.

DON'T BUY THIS. SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY AND THE EFFORT.",1374537600,21,256,4.565217391304348
5683218,1,B00BZW5V6U,This is a disgrace. No music. Just an interview where the couldn't even keep her head in the picture. This a complete joke. Amazon should pull this shameful DVD now.,1373760000,22,165,4.533333333333333
5683219,1,B00BZW5V6U,"I'm a Lana del Rey fan through and through, and just bought this on a whim when I saw it was available for pre-order. I thought that it would be more like a documentary, or include footage I'd never seen before. However, I found that most of the interviews used in the film were things I'd already seen on Youtube for the most part, and the narration/storyline lacked any kind of enthusiasm. The dvd was cheap so I guess you get what you pay for in terms of quality, but I was pretty disappointed in the actual ""documentary"". There was nothing in it that I hadn't already read/seen online. Speaking as a fan of the artist, I have to say don't waste your time with this product.",1373500800,19,677,4.338582677165355
5683220,2,B00BZW5V6U,"I am a huge fan of Lana Del Rey and pre-ordered this DVD. I should have waited until it was out and read what others think about it, because the bad reviews are right. It's only about 30 minutes long and the cover is the best thing about it.",1372723200,8,241,3.938775510204082
5683221,1,B00BZW5V6U,I must agree with all the 1 star reviews that were given before me. Lana Del Rey is a gifted artist but this DVD did her absolutely zero percent justice.,1371513600,23,153,4.133333333333334
5683222,1,B00BZW5V6U,"Let me start of by just say that the only reason i even gave this 1 star was because it's about lana, i am very disappointed at the fact that someone is making money off of this when in fact they are youtube videos the quality is so bad, the music in the background is very infuriating. the cover picture was hq but the contents in the dvd were bad. also, i pre-ordered the dvd when it was first announced on here, only to receive it a week later then the set release date, due to the fact that my card info was 'incorrect', but they were quick to take my 10 dollars, i mean its not much, but that could've been fund for when lana starts her tour in the US if she ever decides to have a tour in the US because of stupid things like these. again very disappointed, if anyone wants to view it just go check out the youtube videos where she's wearing her ferrari jacket, anddd, watch her music videos with the music on mute or you could message me and i'll link you to the youtube videos in this dvd. the only thing i learned from this dvd was that her UK tour ended may 28th, but i could've just googled that.",1371427200,27,1107,4.059360730593608
8575941,1,B00BZW5V6U,nice to have but not near as good as I thought it would be!,1509321600,,59,3.2857142857142856
8575942,3,B00BZW5V6U,Shipping and packaging were excellent. The content was boring as hell! Omg!.  And it's only 30 minutes long. But I'm a huge Lana fan and needed this.,1471046400,,149,4.518518518518518
8575943,1,B00BZW5V6U,This was terrible. Gave me no information about how she started up her career or anything listed. It was also like 15 minutes long. It was like I watched a bad school project with two dragging interviews from youtube in it. Dissapointed.,1451433600,,237,4.666666666666667
8575944,1,B00BZW5V6U,Just was bad,1443139200,,12,3.3333333333333335
8575945,1,B00BZW5V6U,This is not an hour and 10 minutes and it consists of 2 interviews that I could watch on YouTube. I love Lana so much but this was a huge disappointment.,1435276800,4,153,3.967741935483871
8575946,3,B00BZW5V6U,"I expected a bit more, though i still like the dvd as i love everything about lana! But with that title ""the greatest story never told"" i thought that i would learn more about lana and her work!",1404777600,2,194,4.131578947368421
8575947,1,B00BZW5V6U,Crudely put together DVD. Can find better videos on YouTube. Bad narration and information. Don't waste your time like I did.,1397692800,,125,5.0
8575948,1,B00BZW5V6U,I thought this was a full movie. It is just a clip interview where she likes to touch herself a lot. It was disgusting. I threw it away.,1393286400,,136,3.892857142857143
8575949,2,B00BZW5V6U,"It's not worth it! All the interviews they show with Lana are on YouTube, and the little narration is actually of information you can find anywhere on the web. Plus, it's a 35-minute-documentary. Don't pay for this.",1384819200,5,215,4.837837837837838
8575950,1,B00BZW5V6U,biggest scam in the universe. best part about this documentary is the cover. Someone stole my laptop that had this DVD still in it and i feel sorry for them that they now own this piece of crap.,1381363200,4,194,4.131578947368421
