1219884,4,B00000IBVC,"Opera on DVD has come of age with the release of ""Turandot at the Forbidden City of Beijing.""  This production by the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, transferred from Florence Italy to the historically accurate  setting of the Forbidden City, tells the story of the deadly Ice Princess  Turandot and the Unknown Prince who solves her riddles to win her hand and  eventually her heart.  Thrice Oscar-nominated director Zhang Yimou has  filled his expansive venue with extras from the People's Liberation Army  and the Dance Academy of Beijing.  The flawless video transfer boasts vivid  colors that jump off the screen and clear sharp images that reveal the  smallest details even in the panoramic wide shots that showcase the scope  and grandeur of the presentation.  The performances are good - Barbara  Frittoli is a standout as Liu.  The Dolby Digital 2.0 audio transfer is as  good as can be expected given the sonic limitations of the original  production.  Overall, the orchestra conducted by Zubin Mehta fares somewhat  better than the singers, who were body miked for this open-air production.  Occasionally, some voices get lost in the mix.  Examples of this include  ""Ah, per l'ultima Volta,"" which combines all voices to bring the  first act to a close, in which the voice of Calaf must dominate, but  doesn't, and ""Fermo!  Che fai?"" with the voices of the three  Ministers of State too small for the occasion.  It is the extras included  in this disc that make this a DVD and/or opera enthusiast's dream: 16:9  anamorphic widescreen transfer; Synopsis and subtitles in English, French  Italian, German, Japanese and German; a PCM audio-only track identical to  the CD release of this production coupled with a slideshow of  behind-the-scene and production photos; and a 30-minute ""Making  of"" documentary in English or German with subititles in 4 other  languages.  In addition, this may well be the first mainstream DVD to make  extensive use of the alternate angle feature throughout the presentation,  providing wide-angle alternatives to close -up shots and vice versa, as  well as occasional views from the wings and behind the stage.  The presence  of alternate angles is appropriately signalled by the appearance of an  unobtrusive but noticeable full moon in the upper left corner.  Overall,  this disc is a welcome arrival for anyone who wants to take advantage of  all the features of DVD.",924048000,36,2407,5.095360824742268
1219885,1,B00000IBVC,"I saw this performance in Bejing, and this video in no way reflects what I saw. Some scenes are out of focus, there are no long shots which give a sense of space and place. The direction is totally haphazard, with no  continuity of shots. It is so horrible to watch, that I was distracted to  the point where I could hardly listen. The cast is ok, but totally  undistinguished. If you love or don't know Turandot, this video is to be  avoided at all costs.",913420800,6,456,4.267441860465116

Finally it became available on DVD. The voices and the performances are excellent. Since it is given from the Forbidden City, the staging is the best I've seen.",1420848000,,332,4.306451612903226
1220055,4,B00000IBVC,"The biggest point in favor of this vis-a-vis other versions, the beautiful setting and stage production, is frustratingly detracted from with inexplicably bad taste in cutting away from the stage to show jarringly incongruous and not especially well shot scenes such as the Great Wall in broad daylight, or superimposing a moon or what is apparently supposed to be jade or ice at key moments.

There are also some failures to make much of some dramatic points. The short embrace between Turandot and Calaf, for example, is more a token than a portrayal of what their singing describes.

On the whole, though, the production is beautiful, the acting sincere, and the singing very good. I hope someday a restored version without the misguided effects/excursions will be available.",1416182400,,778,5.118110236220472

1220145,5,B00000IBVC,"Ive seen multiple performances of this opera and this is how Puccini intended it to be. The staging and costuming are perfect, the quality of singing is almost perfect and the acting is very good.

 I don't understand why, on several occasions, we were treated to repeated views of Chinese architecture, stone statuary or other Chinese art, as they did not seem to have any relevance, to the storyline or action. Some of the photography was a bit sloppy, in that, in some of the long views, we were treated to views of the offstage lighting fixtures.

 The only disappointment, if one can really call it that, is that they sang the shorter version of Nessun Dorma.

 Aside from that, this performance deserves 5 stars.",1383868800,,718,4.704
1220146,5,B00000IBVC,"This production has to be on of the greatest feats ever achieved with a piece of theatre - in this case a full opera with thousands of Chinese actors and artists as extras but also part of the cast.  The inimitable Zubin Mehta certainly knew what he was taking on in the conducting role. Zhang Yimou as Director had a huge task put before him, but one which he made into such a successful spectacle.  And let;s not forget the more than adequate singers in this production.  Sergej Larin as Calaf and Giovanna Casolla as Turandot  are superb.  This DVD is a must have and own forever item.  I am so happy I found it.  It was posted quickly, took a while to reach me in Australia but was packed well and arrived safely.

1220153,3,B00000IBVC,"I'm afraid my review of this dvd is not terrible favorable. Zhang Yimou did a beautiful job in terms of sheer stage spectacle. The singers, however, are basically second string and definitely not singer/actors, especially in terms of overly stylized gestures, Calaf's wandering eyes, the fluttery movement of Ping, Pang, Pong, etc. Where are the days of Callas, Tebaldi, Nillson, Bjoerling, etc. Perhaps it was the dvd I saw, but voices seemed out of synch with mouth movements. Grand opera can be beautiful, but I don't know that film is the best medium. When the camera gets so close you can see every double chin quiver, well....",1337299200,2,632,4.91588785046729

1220205,5,B00000IBVC,"This will be the second copy of the Turandot - Live at Peking Forbidden City that I have, the previous copy is in VHS format where in those days where DVD is yet to innovate yet, since there is no subtitle therefore I have absolutely no idea what they are singing about, but overall even though I know what the story is about but without the subtitle it is hard to understand what is going on. The DVD version of the opera comes with Subtitle in English & Chinese. Even though the Chinese subtitle does not appear in every conversation (the Japanese subtitle almost translate all the conversation during the entire show), but it gives me a better understanding on the entire story.

However, I always wish that Barbara Frittoli can play the main character ""Turandot"" while Casolla played the character ""Liu"". Barbara Frittoli have the sweetest tune compare with Casolla, in fact in some Classical music review, ""Liu""'s part in the opera is the most difficult and technical in the story.

Love the setting of the stage and of course the culture dance, love the angel of death (in Act I, when the prince is about to be axe, a group of woman dancer dress in white, dancing under the moonlight), director Zhang Yi-Mou portrait the traditional Chinese version of Angel of Death well, and the little monk holding lotus lamp at the end make the show more interesting.

1220207,5,B00000IBVC,"There is no more spectacular recording of any opera ever made, to my knowledge.  The Chinese government got behind it to make it a visual masterpiece, and musical personages from throughout the world flew in to see it.  While the vocal artists may have been surpassed by various of the historic greats, the overall production is an unequalled artistic masterpiece.

1220208,5,B00000IBVC,"I wish reviewers would review the product at hand without comparing to other recorded versions. No singer or opera performance is similar and should be reviewed based on it's sole merits alone. Larin is not Corelli, Casolla is not Nilsson and Frittoli is not Moffo. Just think how boring opera would be if every singer and opera performance was exactly the same. As a Chinese-American, I thoroughly enjoyed this lavish performance. From the Chinese perspective, it is a great honor that a magnificent composer such as Puccini would have been enthralled with our culture to write Turandot. To bring Turandot home to Beijing is an honor long overdue. Of course for such an important homecoming, Zhang Yimou, the greatest director in China would be asked to direct and produce the event. In a culture where face (honor) is so important, should it be surprising that the Chinese would spare no expense in recreating such lavish costumes, and scenery, etc.? This was a chance for China to showcase herself and her grand culture. The Chinese government is very selective about whom is allowed to film inside this amazing symbol of imperialism. I only state the above so viewers can better understand why certain scenes like martial arts (wushu - acrobatic style) are included. I can hardly wait for the opening Beijing Olympics ceremony. Also, Frittoli's slave attire may seem too fancy for some reviewers. However, servants of wealthy families were well dressed because they accompanied their masters into public. Now for the reviewer that called this a second rate cast, I disagree. Just because they do not have famous names does not mean they are not great singers. Those who can DO, those who cannot criticize. Larin is a wonderful tenor, but he does not seem to act at all. Casolla has a steely voice just perfect for the role of ice princess. Frittoli is again magnificent. Her voice is warm and golden in tone. She's a fine actress too. Mehta is in fine form directing the Orchestra & Chorus of Maggio Musicale Florentino.
I think Zhang Yimou is a genius and have enjoyed all of his films. The production and background are visually gorgeous. The costumes were unbelievable and I greatly enjoyed having real Chinese in the cast. A very worthy Turandot!",1205625600,8,2254,4.903141361256544
1220209,5,B00000IBVC,"This was AWESOME!  Granted after seeing the freak show the Met put on with James Levine Conducting I was ""easy to please.""

1220210,3,B00000IBVC,"I am not an opera ""buff"" but I bought this DVD soley for the purpose of seeing someone I know in the opera..his name is Aldo Bottion and he played Altoum but, not knowing opera, I don't know which character this is..I hope it's not the old man with all that makeup, cause I couldn't even pick out my own mother with all that makeup...Could anyone tell me which one was Aldo Bottion?",1186358400,,382,4.2465753424657535
1220211,3,B00000IBVC,"Nine years down the road, this production strikes me as neither particularly good nor particularly bad.

In performance quality, it is typical of the sort of thing one sees from second-string companies, such as--alas!--my own local company, the Vancouver opera.  The cast--satisfactory enough for that level--is resolutely, steadfastly B-list, with Frittoli perhaps aspiring to B+ status.

Considering that this is as much a circus as it is an opera, concerns about the quality of conducting are largely irrelevant.

In production values, this ""Turandot"" holds some interest, but primarily  as a stunt and little more.  It is a production transplanted from the Florence May Festival, a well-regard and respectable source.  That being said, I, for one, would bet that everything about it had worked better in Florence than any of it did amid all the foofraw in Peking.

Except for the sheer spectacle of it all, this should not be anyone's first choice for ""Turandot"" on DVD.",1172188800,10,974,5.198717948717949
1220212,3,B00000IBVC,"I was disappointed to find that all of the singers in this production were European.  Surely there are some Chinese opera singers who could have taken part and made it seem more realistic.  I agree with those who have said they preferred the Placido Domingo/Eva Marton production.  Marton was a much better Turandot than Casolla, who I thought was too old for the role.  Frittoli's Liu was beautifully done, but I agree her costume was too elaborate for a slave.  Leona Mitchell was a much more believable Liu.  However, since this version was not made in China, I didn't expect the singers to be Chinese.  I found the dancers in the long white robes puzzling.  What were they supposed to represent?  The use of a small Chinese woman as the executioner was startling and not particularly effective.  I would have preferred the chorus to be hidden, and the crowd to look like the Chinese peasants they were supposed to be.  However, on the whole, the music and the singing were beautifully done.",1154390400,3,994,4.72093023255814
1220213,3,B00000IBVC,"This production has some pluses and some drawbacks.

First the pluses.

The costumes in this production are radiant and colorful.  Very vivid and indeed opulent looking.

The setting from Beijing makes the opera even more exotic in nature.

Now for the negatives

Both the soprano and the tenor singing the role of Turandot and Calaf only did a so-so job in my opinion.  The soprano is underpowered and sounded very strained especially during the ""grido"" and the riddle scene, which is not an ideal Turandot since this is the most exciting part of the opera.  The tenor is also underpowered.  Not only that, he makes some weird facial expressions when he was singing which I find very distracting.  Although the costumes were good I don't think some of them are appropriate.  Calaf was not suppose to be Chinese yet his costume was Chinese looking.  As to the slave girl Lui's costumes, again it was too chinese and looks too ravishing to be a slave girl's outfit.

Overall not a turkey, but there are better productions out there especially in the singing department.  Try the MET production with Eva Marton in video/DVD or buy the Sutherland or Nillson set in CD.  For one of the best ""In Questa Reggia"" ever sung, try Dame Eva Turner's version.",1140393600,9,1247,4.734883720930233
1220214,5,B00000IBVC,Puccini would be thrilled with this vast film production of his durable and spectacular opera Turandot.  Top notch voices filled the enormous Imperial Palace staging.  Costumes were authentic and brilliant in detail. Most of the extras were Chinese nationality.  Enjoy this and then ask for the DVD film on The Making of Turandot which tells the lengthy tale of the first concept for bringing the Italian production to China for filming and then the unending modifications in order to present an authentic setting.  It is a total experience and brilliant throughout.,1127520000,10,566,5.186813186813187
1220313,1,B00000IBVC,"For a long time I avoided buying this DVD, fearing that it would be like the football stadium Aidas that you see here and there:  ""Cast of thousands!  Horses and elephants! Truly spectacular!""  Finally, after getting all the other Turandot DVDs, I broke down and bought this one.  Unfortunately, I was right -- this is just a circus.
The musical values are actually not all that bad, but they are overwhelmed by the colossally bad production values.  All the action is set in the midst of a vast plaza in which no one ever would expect an opera to be set.  The cinematography specializes in displaying ""look how big this is!""  Scene after scene is shot from afar, over the heads or shoulders of a huge audience, presumably to show us how big the square is in Peking, how many people are attending, and how enormously clever the producers are to have arranged this.  The opera itself is largely overlooked in the rush to be with it.
I could go on about other, less serious faults, but why bother?  There are three other Turandots -- the Met, San Francisco, and Salzburg -- that are infinitely superior to this production.  Buy one or more of them, and leave this turkey on its roost.",1083715200,21,1182,4.533018867924528
1220314,4,B00000IBVC,"Turandot is an excellent opera and this production does it justice. The spectacle of it all, and the occasion (on the original site!!!) combine to make it near-to-perfect.
The only things that keep it from that beloved fifth star:
Larin's acting leaves a good deal to be desired.
Casolla's singing is not bad, but is much less than ideal.
Mehta's choices in conducting, especially his tempos, are exaggerated and inaccurate.
But aside from that, Larin's singing is heavenly, and Fritolli's voice and her acting are superb. Yimou's stage direction is the perfect combination of Chinoiserie and operatic refinement, and is visually stunning.",1083283200,13,639,5.2745098039215685

1220317,4,B00000IBVC,"As a Chinese with some idea about Chinese history and culture, I have the following reservations:
1) The Forbidden City-- the setting of the play-- was built in the wake of Ming Dynasty and was only used as the Imperial Palace in early Ching. The costume here is neither Ming or Ching, nor any suggestion of a mixture. The Palace anyway has completely faded and virtually colourless, making a stark contrast with the bright and colourful costumes.
2) The Chinese Kung Fu Scene ( as well as a number of other scenes for embellishment ) is totally unnecesary and the performer's costume in particular is peculiar. We also have too much zoom-ins and zoom-outs and then diversions (in the form of montages?) into irrelevant Chinese spectacular scenes or images like various shots of the Great Wall or other scenes taken from the Forbidden City itself, just to remind viewers that this is China. These may distract and annoy some viewers.
3) The actors acting and singing with full facial and body expressions in such costumes and in such make-ups ( particularly their funny beards or unnatural finger gestures) look funny to oriental eyes. Madame Butterfly ( the one with the Japanese singer ) is doing much better in these aspects.
4) More often than not, the setting is flooded with people, peole from both sides, people from everywhere: perhaps typical of any Chinese scene. But does it really help in a musical drama?
But a glance through some of the reviews seems to suggest that these are over worries, at least so from the eyes of the Europeans: most of them seem to enjoy it.
The part of Turandot is a difficult enough, perhaps even more impressing would be the singing of the supporting actress, the prince is marvelous too. All in all, suffice to say that in terms of singing, both the solos and the chorus or even the orchestra, they are all superb: they are even better than most of the Metropolitan performances.
On the music score, there might be some justification when Mahler slighted Pucinni as a song writer ""who just knows some orchestration"". Althugh one might argue that in a way, the two are just 6 and half a dozen. the fact remains, as a whole, Turandot is rather noisy. It seems that the sense of drama in Turandot is not so potent, at least not as popent as Madame Butterfly. And of course, one could always turn to Verdi, like Pucinni himself did, for an alternative. And in any event, credits should be given to the excellent recorded sound and picture of the production.",1070409600,6,2495,4.685649202733485
1220318,5,B00000IBVC,"Though this may not be the best recording of Turandot ever released, it is arguably the best DVD of a live performance to date.  The crew lensed the performance with careful attention to dramatic detail -- we are taken from the grand sweep of authentic Chinese spectacle to almost claustrophobic close-ups of soloists, then back again, all timed with excrutiating precision to the soundtrack.  The widescreen presentation captures much of the grandeur of the original performance as I remember it (one of the few bonuses of my previous career was an ability to travel to events such as this) and the sound quality is superb.  Sergej Larin's Calaf is competently respectable and Barbara Frittoli stands among the great Pings on record.  The PCM Audio track is superb, though the enthusiast should be aware that it lacks some of the clarity of the audio CD on some of the larger numbers.  Although conductor Mehta's sometimes heavy hand is apparent in the pomp of the production, it is in the backstage photos (over 100) and the ""Making of"" vignette that we see his disarming charm work to bring together not only the cast and crew, but the many Chinese officials attached to the project.  This DVD is a genuine pleasure for any fan of live opera, and for the enthusiast, it beautifully records a unique moment in opera history when Italian composer Puccini's famed Turandot ""came home"" to China.

1220319,4,B00000IBVC,"This is probably the most unique and most spectacular opera production of Puccini's ""Turandot"", plus being staged at the Forbidden City in Beijing, this also could be the most authentic ""Turandot"" ever produced. Zhang Yimou's stage direction has mingled large amount of Chinese traditional culture elements - Chinese martial art, Chinese dance, Peking Opera, Chinese calligraphy, dazzling Chinese ancient costumes (all hand-embroidered on silks and satins), Chinese drums, Jiaozi (Chinese sedan chair), even the young Chinese Buddhist monks played by dozens of young kids - to enrich its realism, although on the other hand, they somewhat sidetracked the essence of the story and weakened the characters. A bit of over-display by juxtaposing the Chinese tradition, one might feel, however, for Chinese culture novice, this is a very good demonstration. And again, Zhang didn't forget the moon, which seems to be his favor in any of his works.
The main cast, unfortunately, is hard to stand out in such a grand production and on such a huge stage, well maybe with Barbara Frittoli's Liu as an exception. She sings beautifully and wholeheartedly, and she acts. Sergej Larin has a brilliant voice, but his ""Nessun dorma"" lacks the intensity if compared to Pavarotti's. Turandot is portrayed by Italian soprano Ciovanna Casolla, who sings the character quite well, but hard to fit in the image of a Chinese princess. The three ministers, each of them holding a prop that's kind of confusing: a woman's handkerchief, a calabash (used as wine bottle in old China), and a Chinese abacus, are good to listen but not really nice to watch.
Although relatively highly priced, this DVD has loads of bonus material, including a nice quality PCM audio track of the entire production. After all, this is all about Puccini's music, and Zubin Mehta and the Orchestra & Chorus of Maggio Musicale Fiorentino have made it all the more worthwhile.",1040860800,12,1926,5.1369426751592355

1220321,3,B00000IBVC,"I agree with other reviewers who praise the production values in this performance.  Zhang Yimou's stage direction is very impressive and reflects his wonderful visual sense.  Although at times he appears to have everyone under the sun on stage, the direction does not veer into the worst excesses of Zeffirelli.  Zhang makes some interesting decisions regarding how to stage the chorus-dominated scenes, and, by and large, they work quite well (especially the invocation to the moon).
The DVD direction, on the other hand, is another story.  The director keeps cutting to shots of the chorus, who are static because they are arranged like a choral society on the steps of the Forbidden Palace, while very interesting and/or beautiful things are happening on stage(such as the wonderful dance during the 1st scene's choral hymn to the executioner).  Another example of the director's strange choices is his insistence on showing the viewing audience the artificial moon during the moon invocation (oh, look, it's the moon!  and there's an axe superimposed!  how clever!) when Zhang had staged a beautiful and effective scene.
The performances were generally disappointing.  Larin's singing was adequate, no more, and his acting dismal.  Casolla sounded fine and she generated some heat during the riddle scene, but the final love duet was limp.  Frittoli was an effective Liu, but the PPP trio was made more annoying by using pointless affectations to create character (one was, apparently, suppposed to be drunk in the 1st scene.  Why?  who knows?).
I'd really give this performance 2 1/2 stars.",1012521600,29,1595,5.211764705882353
1220322,5,B00000IBVC,"Apart from the opera itself, which is sublime (we already know that of course), the orchestra is excellent and the singers are from good to very very good. The stage is astonishing, as it was built specially to perform this opera, within the Forbidden City of Beijing (one of its real buildings is used as backstage). The customs, designed by the Chinese people copying the fashion of the Chinese court at the time the plot is supposed to be taking place. The dances are choreographed by a renowned Chinese choreographer. It's a pleasure and a moving experience to listen to Puccini's music of a Chinese story very well performed (it touches you) and not totally seen by occidental eyes, as this performance has been assembled with the collaboration of Chinese people.

So how do you get the two of us to watch an Italian opera about a medieval Chinese princess and some nut who is so smitten by her that he risks his very head to win her love?  Get a wonderful orchestra under the baton of Zubin Mehta and combine it with the sublime voices of Giovanna Casolla, Sergej Larin, and Barbara Frittoli and the chorus of Maggio Musicale Fiorentino for starters.  Then recruit a thousand Chinese extras and perform the show in exquisite costumes at the Forbidden City of Beijing.  The result is one of the finest videos I have ever seen.  I am sure this will not be the last opera my son and I will see.  Pokemon move over; Back Street Boys get back stage; PUCCINI VINCIT!",990921600,75,805,4.291390728476821
1220405,5,B00000IBVC,"Seventy-two years after its premiere in Milan, Puccini's Turandot finally ""came home"" to Beijing.
 Never mind that the Turandot story was not even of Chinese origin, being based on a play by an 18th-century Italian dramatist who in turn probably got the idea from The Arabian Nights.  And never mind that Puccini had never been to China, and knew little of Chinese history and culture.  However imperfectly it was glimpsed, China was the inspiration for the opera, and China remains the source of much of its continuing fascination for the world.
 For too many decades, Turandot was seen solely through western eyes, with scant respect for authenticity, its ""Chineseness"" no more than a veneer.  Even a director such as Franco Zeffirelli could commit the unthinkable blunder (in his 1987 production at New York's Metropolitan Opera, also available on Video/DVD) of presenting the Emperor, the Son of Heaven, dressed completely in black!  It was left to the great Chinese director Zhang Yimou to redress the balance and turn Turandot into a genuine and equal meeting of East and West, rather than a travesty of the East by the West.  His production came close to a vision of this opera that the composer himself might have dreamed of, had he been all-seeing and all-knowing about China, whilst retaining the genius and conventions of Italian opera.
""Opera on original sites"" (which started with Aida in Luxor some years ago) is a concept that has produced variable results with different operas.  For all its extravagance, there is no denying the unique magic that the right location under the right conditions can conjure up for the audience.  Though it is not one of the most majestic halls in the Forbidden City (which would in fact have dwarfed the production), the sight of Taimiao (Supreme Ancestral Temple) in the Beijing twilight as a backdrop for Turandot was perfectly imposing and inspiring.  To this were added two moveable pavilions which Zhang used to brilliant effect, from being an integral part of the scene (from which, for example, the Wise Men read out the answers to the riddles), to a dreamlike evocation of the musical imagery (as when Ping, the Minister, nostalgically recalled his home in Honan, with its lovely blue pond surrounded by bamboo).
The production was a visual feast of unparalleled splendour from beginning to end, fully matching the splendour and passion of Puccini's score.  The costumes set a standard in opulence and authenticity probably never equalled, let alone surpassed, in the annals of opera.  With a cinematic director's eye, Zhang filled the 82-metre-wide stage with a huge cast of extras, from ministers and mandarins to dancers and soldiers, which lent flesh and blood to Puccini's ""insubstantial pageant"".  Their beautifully choreographed movements, with elements from Chinese opera, dance, and even martial arts, were so skilfully blended in as to become an integral part of the music drama.  For all its authentic appeal, a major drawback of the historic site as a ""stage"" was that its separate tiers leading up to the terrace outside the temple seriously constrained the movements of the crowd, especially in the riotous First Act.
 If one talks much more about the production than the musical performance, it is only because it is for the former rather than the latter that the Beijing Turandot will long be remembered.  Good as they were, the principals - Giovanni Casolla as Turandot, Sergej Larin as Calaf and Barbara Frittoli as Liu - were far outshone by the best of other recorded versions (particularly Nilsson, Corelli and Scotto, and Sutherland, Pavarotti and Caballe).  Conductor Zubin Mehta presided over the orchestra and chorus with masterly control, and an equal sensitivity to the exotic colours of the score and its pacing and dramatic impact.
Like one of your readers, I too was at the performance in Beijing in 1998, but unlike him, I do not think it either realistic or fair to expect the video to duplicate that experience.  Considering the conditions under which the production was shot (outdoor and at night), the visual quality is acceptable.  The audio quality is variable, both at the live performance and on DVD.  In this more than any other Puccini opera, the chorus plays a dramatically and musically pivotal role, but here their rousing and at times barbaric voice is often blunted by imbalances in the sound system.
But then, a barbaric China was not what this production was about.  This was, above all, a gloriously and lovingly nostalgic Turandot.  It was almost as if, after half a century of proletarian rule, Zhang Yimou was intent on recapturing, if only for a fleeting moment, all the pomp and splendour of a bygone civilisation which once thrived on this very spot, and whose heritage the ""cultural revolution"" almost destroyed.  In this context, the three Ministers' valediction resounds with a new, touching significance: ""Addio, razza! Addio, stirpe divina!"" -- ""Farewell, race of men!  Farewell, divine heritage!""",980380800,36,5013,5.070559610705596

1220407,5,B00000IBVC,"This production is not an Arena di Verona type outdoor performance translocated to Beijing. It is a grandiose event on a gigantic scale of the kind Mehta specializes in. As far as the staging is concerned this is a  Turandot unlike any other. The location required and inspired a different  and impressive approach by the director Zhang Yimou: from the inclusion of  the Beijing Dance Academy to the unusual location of the choir. This  approach seems surprisingly appropriate, partly because all the action in  the drama takes place outdoors. Mehta doesn't need my endorsement in  Puccini. The singers are good to wonderful, depending on one's  expectations, but this doesn't matter because the issue here is THE EVENT.  This is the only opera DVD I have that takes advantage of many of the  possibilities in this medium. The list of the technical features is too  long. You can choose different camera angles, 6 subtitle languages, the  entire audio track and more.

Thousands of people involved, for sure one will be entertained by all the  magic of the settings, the costumes, the performance, the music - it is  hard not to be amused by Puccini music, as long as one appreciates Opera.  The sole remark is on the music itself, not sung with all that brilliance.  But you can always listen to the CD, also included in the DVD, which has a  much better sound quality.
