941089,5,6304953747,Great pair of campy horror movies. The predecessors to Army Of Darkness (1992). Quality of the movies is very good considering the vintage of the movies and the budget they were made on.,1520380800,,186,4.666666666666667
941090,5,6304953747,Bought this from a brick and mortar shortly after it came out. Make sure you buy one that has the little booklet tucked in the page before the dvd disc itself. The dvd disc as another commenter pointed out does not have as many features as im sure other copies have. But the book itself and the included booklet are a MUST FOR EVIL DEAD FANS. Pony up the $$$ and make the purchase. Also for true fans there is a collector's edition Evil Dead vhs. Mine says copyright 1998. This vhs tape came in a hard plastic black case that snapped closed. On the opposite side of the cover for this vhs is a message from Bruce Campbell and a really cool b&w photo of the crew standing in a swamp.,1520294400,,682,4.174242424242424

941151,3,6304953747,"RELEASED IN 1981 (but not until April, 1983, in the USA) and written & directed by Sam Raimi, The Evil Dead chronicles events when five Michigan State students travel to a remote cabin in western Tennessee for spring break wherein they discover a copy of the Book of the Dead and an audiotape whose incantations resurrect demons in the woods. Havoc ensues.

This is a cult classic movie and the famous directors first full-length feature. It only cost $350,000 to make and was shot in 1979, as well as the first weeks of 1980. Bruce Campbell makes for a quality protagonist and theres a good trio of girl-next-door types (Ellen Sandweiss, Theresa Tilly and Betsy Baker), but Raimi only really takes advantage of these feminine resources with Sandweiss as Cheryl.

The first half of the movie is great, which involves the five students arrival to the cabin and the initial possession/attack sequences. Its atmospheric, well executed and compelling. The second half, however, is redundant. While each new attack ups the ante its basically more of the same in the same setting (the cabin). Dont get me wrong, the second half is effective chaotic & chilling horror with loads of cartoony gore, but its too one-dimensional with no meaty subtext to chew on. Its just people being attacked by hideous creatures, one after the other.

This simplistic approach CAN work, as witnessed by 1972's ""Gargoyles,"" but in that movie the initial gargoyle attacks led to a captivating confrontation in their hellish cave complex in the last act. The latter half of ""The Evil Dead,"" by contrast, is just one attack after another in the same general setting. This might work for 11-14 year-olds who are wowed by cartoonish gore and constant diabolic thrills, but it doesnt work for more mature people who require some element of mindfood or, at least, variation to keep interested. Another negative is the final gory sequence which is decidedly low-budget and cartoony, albeit creatively and expertly done on a film student level.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 25 minutes and was shot in Morristown, Tennessee, with additional work done in Michigan.

Bar none one of the most imaginative movie horror films out there with a touch of hilarity in each and almost every scene.

It may very well be the most influential horror film of all time.  Funny and frightening, with a lithe and lusty Bruce Campbell as lead, this movie really nails down what makes this genre so fascinating - the allure of something forbidden, the brutality of the unknown around us, the ambivalent attitude towards those loved ones who have fallen under evil's spell - where is this better shown?

Anchor bay's first blu-ray reissue of this film was released with a Bonus dvd back in 2010
which contained hours & hours worth of bonus material
for some stupid reason Anchor bay released all this bonus content as a Bonus Disc with this blu-ray release
when all the bonus material could've easily fit on 1 Blu-ray Disc
but instead they advertised this blu-ray with Limited edition bonus dvd which is out of print now
however for those fans that missed out
the 2010 U.K. blu-ray version of Evil Dead contains most of the special features from the DVD on 1 Disc
U.K. branch Sony pictures owns the rights to this film now and has released it on blu-ray with
most of the content from the Bonus DVD Disc
ONE BY ONE WE WILL TAKE YOU- which is the 52min retrospective Documentary
from the old Anchor bay Ultimate edition dvd which has interviews with all the cast & some of the crew from the film
except for Bruce campbell & Sam raimi are not interviewed for some reason
there's also THE EVIL DEAD Deleted scenes, Discovering the Evil Dead, At the Drive in, Make up test, Photo stills Gallery,
Theatrical trailer, & TV spots & the old Anchor bay commentary with Sam raimi & Bruce campbell
all on 1 Blu-ray Disc but only from the U.K. version which is ABC regions anyway
so the only 2 things missing is the Reunion panel & Ladies of the Evil Dead meet Bruce campbell
apart from that nearly all the extras from the old Bonus Disc are carried over
there is 1 new special feature added for this U.K. blu-ray a picture in picture featurette
which has new interviews with some filmakers talking about how the Evil Dead is their big influence
the HD transfer on this U.K. blu-ray is actually the same transfer from the old Anchor bay blu-ray
without the 1:33:1 option, the old Anchor bay blu-ray had 2 screen options either 1:33:1 ratio or 1:85:1 ratio
well the Full screen option is Gone, Sony pictures blu-ray has the 1:85:1 ratio only & 5.1 Master audio mix
so if you can live without the reunion panel & ladies meet Bruce campbell featurette's
then just buy the U.K. blu-ray version which is ABC coded
which i think is still worth buying without the reunion panel featurette
5 stars for the U.K. blu-ray version
1 star for this old Anchor bay blu-ray which only has audio commentary track",1460851200,4,2389,4.494252873563219

Being a big horror fan and the fan of the series I was extremely stoked to see that this version was up on Amazon instant video along with the new Starz subscription, I first watched it on Starz to see if this was actually the NC-17 addition that was re-released when the 2013 edition came out on DVD when the remake was released . It was! So immediately after that I purchased it in HD . The current print of this film being sold is superb every way end even the audio is 5.1 . Where as my DVD from 2003-ish is only stereo. They did a really great job mastering the video footage and audio and the footage that has been reinserted into the NC-17 addition does not look distorted or aged at all they did a great job at making that look like it had been there all along and was never getting that out for 33 or 32 years . Anyways , I see why the evil dead franchise/ArmyofDarkness movies have done so well and now why there is ash vs the evil dead on Starz.

941928,3,6304953747,"One of my all time favorite movies in the ""cheesy scary horror"" category.

It has its share of what we now call ""jump scares"", it's got gore, and it's got bizarre and wonderful makeup. It also has Bruce's legendary and fantastic facial expressions, which should be enough to sell anyone on it. All you gotta do is Google Bruce Campbell's face. Does the quirked eyebrow and the promise of like, buckets of weird gore draw you in? Cool, watch The Evil Dead.

I really only give it three stars because as I get older, one scene in which a female character is raped by a tree entity seems entirely unnecessary, cruel, and sexist to me. There are more interesting horror-things in this world, and the ""dimensions beyond"", than rape. Traumatizing real victims who might stumble upon a piece of media like this shouldn't be something we do for shock value, as creators. Do you think men are as frightened by this scene as women are...? No. Perhaps the grosser ones might even be into it.

Horror movies can do better than rape, but if you fast forward through that one kind of unnecessary scene with your eyes closed and sing the Benny Hill theme, this is a hell of a good ride.",1458000000,2,1171,4.514150943396227
941929,4,6304953747,"""Low-budget"" is usually used either as a criticism, or as an excuse for a movie's shortcomings. But a movie's actual cinematic quality isn't determined by its budget.

Case in point: ""The Evil Dead,"" the classic cult film that turned writer/director Sam Raimi into a big name. Produced on a shoestring budget in less-than-ideal surroundings, this movie proves that you don't need amazing special effects or big-name stars to produce an excellent movie -- just a simple tale of five clueless people going off to a cabin in the woods, only to encounter demonic horrors, possession, and some trees that don't understand what ""no"" means.

Five college students are venturing to a remote cabin in the woods, including Ash (Bruce Campbell), his sister Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) and his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker). And with the words ""remote cabin in the woods,"" anyone who has seen horror movies in the last few decades knows roughly what's going to happen. Either eldritch horrors or brutal murders are afoot.

 It turns out to be the former -- when the guys venture into the cabin's basement, they find a book called the Naturom Demonto (""roughly translated: Book of the Dead"") bound in human flesh and inked with blood, and a tape recorder whose incantations release the book's evil. And the evil wastes no time in attacking the group... although it seems most interested in Cheryl. She hears voices calling ""Join us,"" her walk in the woods leads to an encounter with some very rapey trees, and she ends up possessed by a rotten-faced demon.

Unfortunately, the only bridge back to civilization has completely collapsed, leaving them stranded miles from any kind of help. And though they are able to trap the possessed Cheryl in the basement, more of the group are being targeted by the demons lurking in the woods outside -- either to possess them, or to brutally murder them. Or both. Will Ash be able to survive the night in this horrifyingly haunted house, or will he succumb to the ""evil dead""?

Sam Raimi managed to make ""The Evil Dead"" on a budget of under a million dollars, with a real cabin, minimal crew and inexperienced actors (including his childhood friend, future cult icon Bruce Campbell. In other words, this gory little cult movie is only a little more polished than the kind of homemade horror movies that some people put up on Youtube. And honestly... its rough, low-budget style is a large part of its charm, both in how cheesy it can become and in how inventive Raimi had to be.

And about half the time, the results are pretty atmospheric and creepy... and the rest of the time, the movie is pretty hilarious. In the first half, when we have a slow-building, eerie build to the horrors waiting in the woods, with moments of almost Lovecraftian creepiness when the flesh-bound book is uncovered. Raimi uses odd camera angles (and the odd zoom-through-the-swamp-from-the-demon's-point-of-view) to emphasize the unnerving aspects of the story, which is quite impressive considering the limited budget. Actually, it's even creepier because of the gritty, realistic look of the movie.

But once the demon possessions start, the movie bounces into the kind of excess that is utterly hilarious -- fountains of gore, guts, a chainsaw and zombie makeup, mingled with cackling demon girlfriends and a wild-eyed Bruce Campbell lurching around having weird experiences. It stops being scary, but it achieves a delightful cheesiness that is almost irresistible. Where else can you see blood streaming from wall sockets?

The actors all do a pretty good job here, although most of them are generally not noticed in favor of Campbell -- Ellen Sandweiss is quite good as the tormented Cheryl, who is raped by branches and driven into hysteria by the knowledge of the demonic presence, while Richard DeManincor/Hal Delrich is pretty convincing as the insensitive jerk of the group. And of course, we have Campbell. He doesn't yet have that over-the-top, larger-than-life masculine presence he's known for, and utters a few woodenly-delivered lines, but he definitely has a scene-stealing presence and intensity. And most importantly, he can throw himself into seemingly silly scenes (attacking his possessed girlfriend with a wooden beam as large as he is) with utter conviction.

It's cheap, it's cheesy, and its shoestring budget is apparent. But ""The Evil Dead"" ends up a delight through a combination of working well within its limited means, and in graduating from creepy suspense to an orgy of possession and dismemberment. And the demonic fun has only just started.",1457049600,2,4579,5.036988110964333

941934,5,6304953747,"Now we know that this notorious movie was made by a bunch of crazy kids on 16mm cameras and that most attempts like this fall into obscurity.
However, this movie was developed with individuals who knew what worked and had a real sense of editing to make the film all the more menacing and unnerving.
This print is the best that I have ever seen and the fact that it has a new commentary by Sam, Bruce and Bob, the erstwhile crazy kids, gives us a highly entertaining retake of the filming process. As you might imagine, this is not a po-faced, academic discussion but quite hilarious and informative.
Best of all is the fact that this has the Widescreen version but also the tremendous 1:33.1 print as well to take in the whole image and give the really claustrophobic feeling to the movie.
Just Buy It as long as you can play BD region A discs (only works in the UK with Multi-Region players).

942208,5,6304953747,"Long considered one of the classics of the horror genre, The Evil Dead holds up well all these years later. Having grown up during the '80's, I'll always have an affinity for practical special effects compared to CGI, so movies like this are right up my alley. Filmmakers had to be much more creative and inventive than today when it came to realizing the gory, violent details in the script. Sam Raimi delivered a low-budget masterpiece with The Evil Dead, a movie that basically takes the premise of The Exorcist and turns up the intensity level to unheard of proportions. It also offers a much different setting, and as far as I can remember, is one of the original cabin in the woods horror movies. Much like The Exorcist, an ancient demonic force is brought back to America after an archaeological dig, in this instance one that unearths The Book of the Dead. After the researcher who found it reads some passages from the book in his remote cabin, the force begins a reign of terror. After the main cast stumbles on the cabin some time later, possessions begin in earnest, and they're far more grisly than anything in The Exorcist. All of the demon-zombies, blood splatters, and dismemberments are done in glorious old-school fashion, with copious amounts of disgusting concoctions by the makeup and prop crew that rival any other gore movies from that era. And, of course, I'd be remiss not to mention the legendary beginning of Bruce Campbell's B-movie career, and he gives a memorably intense and bizarre performance to match the insanity of the story. This is a movie that belongs in everyone's collection who claims to be a horror fan. It's a real classic from a fun time period in the genre.",1442880000,2,1703,4.737373737373737

942290,5,6304953747,"I have been a fan of Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, so when I went to buy the first Evil Dead, I bought the Ultimate Edition.

The movie is a classic and shows how great horror movies can be made from a low budget.  The plot of Ash and 4 friends going to a cabin and getting possessed and killed was original and creepy at the time, Ash isn't the guy with the chainsaw hand or the ""Boomstick"" yet, this movie shows how he has to fight for his life and seeing how he deals with his possessed and dead friends.  There is no comedy in this movie either, which didn't bother me, because who knew Evil Dead II or Army of Darkness would be made?

Disc one has the film, a commentary with Sam Raimi and Producer Robert Tapert, and a video about the untold parts of The Evil Dead.  Disc two has deleted scenes and a commentary by Bruce Campbell (Ash).  Disc three has videos about the Ladies of The Evil Dead, The Ladies of The Evil Dead meet Bruce Campbell, a video about ""Discovering The Evil Dead"", ""At the Drive-In"", a reunion panel for the cast and crew, ""Unconventional"", the trailer and T.V. spots, a Still Gallery, and poster and memorabilia collections.  As a bonus, there is a poster that comes with it, the original painted poster on one side and a restored version on the other side.

If you are a fan of the Evil Dead series, then you need to get this.  Buy the 3 disc Ultimate Edition because there is so much on it that anyone can enjoy.  The movie is terrific, and the Ultimate Edition is perfect.",1436832000,5,1509,4.244755244755245

Presented in its original 43 version as well as an enhanced widescreen version (again clipping the top and bottom of the frame, but this time doing a much better job than the many DVD releases), the film looks and sounds much better than ever before. Despite Anchor Bays ever-disintegrating reputation for their horror releases, they must be commended for one thing: The horror titles they DO appreciate, they deliver. Great care was put into this amazing (still VERY grainy and VERY ugly to the unsuspecting eye) transfer, and it can be had very cheaply. My local Walmart sells it for $10. With it being Halloween season, however, you may well find it cheaper. Also released in a limited edition with a DVD bonus disc of extras.

942541,5,6304953747,"The Evil Dead is among my favorite horror movies of all time, I understand why many people prefer the sequel for it's more comedic tone and superior cinematography, but in my opinion nothing quite matches the dark and foreboding atmosphere of the the original. There is plenty of genuine criticism to to leveled at this film (Sam Ramie Himself is on record saying that he probably would not have included that bit with the tree, you know which one I'm talking about, if he were to make the movie again) and it's definitely not for the faint of heart of anyone with sensitive triggers, but if you're a gore hound, practical effects enthusiast, or horror fan and you haven't seen it then you owe it to yourself to correct that, and this edition is the best version currently available on DVD for the best value.
This Edition contains two cuts of the film, one in widescreen and one in fulllscreen, each on their own disk with a plethora of extras, including commentary tracks with Sam Rami and Bruce Campbell, as well as a third disk of all extras titled ""Women of the Evil Dead,"" which includes a making of documentary, original promotional material, and a whole bunch of other stuff. The package is all presented very well in an aesthetically pleasing, although slightly over-sized, box set full of very nice artwork, as well as a medium sized double sided poster with the original movie poster art on one side (the one on the cover), and a re-shot and colourized version of the image on the reverse side.

942584,4,6304953747,"Excellent campy movie from a few decades ago.  The movie was an attempt at a horror movie that does have a few creepy moments, but it has its share of moments that are unintentionally funny too.  The good part about the creators is that they realized it, and made a couple more movies for you to watch too.  Evil Dead 2 is a sort of remake and sequel... kind of.  But they made it into more of a comedy-horror movie than the first one.  And finally they made Army of Darkness.  It's movie that stands alone and is well worth seeing.  It's hilarious.  But it's set with the same main character, and is in the same setting as Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2.  It gets funnier if you've seen the preceding movies.

So if you like campy horror, and want to watch Army of Darkness fully understanding the background, then I very much recommend The Evil Dead.",1415836800,,847,4.30379746835443

942640,5,6304953747,"This is ultra-low budget moviemaking--guerilla filmmaking, you might say--and just on the level of production values I'd normally give this kind of thing 3 out of 5 stars at most. Too many young directors these days think they can substitute ""intensity"" for skill and real talent. But, as Pauline Kael once said, Raimi's visual ideas are so good that they make you wish he were a better director. She's right. The visceral and kinetic punch of his angles and shots--which sometimes make me feel like he's attached his camera to a rubber ball that he's throwing and bouncing around like a mischievous kid--are consistently effective and entertaining. The movie is so effective, in fact, it makes you wonder if low-budget horror is more effective than big budget horror ever could be. No Hollywood studio could ever have produced such a frantic and hyperactive movie such as The Evil Dead--and I mean that as a compliment.

The Evil Dead is also distinguished, like its distinguished precedessor Night of the Living Dead--by the presence of an intelligent subtext beneath the gore and dismemberment. In the case of Romero's film, Romero was using carnage and man-eating zombies to represent the anger between classes and races in 1960's America. In the case of Raimi's film, Raimi brings the battle between the sexes into the zombie mix. During the early 80's, feminism made women more demanding and men more resentful. Whether Raimi knew it or not, Ash becomes a symbol of the beleaguered and embattled ""nice young man"" stereotype that women (and men) were becoming more intolerant of.

I also have to say that the remixed sound effects on this Anchor Bay release are truly outstanding. The mix of music and ambient noise is really one of the major points in this film's success. The photography looks about as crappy as ever--I heard that the original movie was shot on a smaller negative like Super 8--but I guess there's so much you can do when you enlarge a small negative to a larger format.",1412985600,,1995,4.882005899705015

I must admit, I have both the Steelbook Blu-ray and the ""Ultimate Edition"". You may want to do the same if you are interested in the special features such as a ""making of"" and all the other great features on the 3rd DVD. I think this is going to be the best version released of this movie. Tons of extras on 3 DVDs, with the most being on the 3rd, ""Ladies of the Evil Dead"". I highly recommend getting this edition if you haven't already. Combined with the single Blu-ray disc release, it is the only edition you will ever need.

This single Blu-ray edition gives you the option of viewing the original 1:33:1 or the ""enhanced"" 1:85:1 versions.
The picture is great and the sound is English Dolby TrueHD 5.1
The interactive menu design is well done with background music.

A group of College friends goes out to the secluded woods of Tennessee to an isolated Cabin. The first night one of the girl's sees and feels strange occurrences. They soon discover a strange book called ""The Book of the Dead"" in the basement. They bring it upstairs to listen to the audio tape of the former resident and learn the details of the deadly book. It's only then that things start to turn gruesome for the cabin friends. One by one, they are consumed by the spirits of the book and are possessed by the beings that are resurrected from it. Ash, the hero of the movie seems to be the only one that survives, or does he?

Everything seemed to happen so fast through-out the whole movie and excessively focused  on one location: cabin . The film really had no story but rather a one man survival cat and mouse game with gore and scary looks.  Now you can somewhat compare these movies to zombie films such as dawn of the dead..

My all time favorite horror film gets an upgrade in this attractive Blu-ray steelbook. This particular edition comes from the UK (as indicated by the Certificate 18 rating) and is region free, meaning it will play on any Blu-ray player in any country.

But ""teenagers-go-to-woods-and-get-murdered"" is a standard horror trope these days, mostly because of this movie, and despite many, many modern competitors, ""Evil Dead"" (1 and 2) has most of them beat. While it doesn't offer much by way of characterization, the story is solid, with enough explained for the Evil Dead themselves to be really terrifying and enough unexplained that the threat remains credible.

I love how they used a ""shaky cam"" approach to achieve the sweeping camera movement (by having the camera mounted on a piece of wood and making two camera operators run around the forest carrying it).  For the long sweep through the cabin, a camera was mounted to a bike and the bike was driven through the cabin.  Necessity is the mother of invention.  The camera work used in this film was very expressive.  Equally important was their unnerving use of sound as another character.  The consistency of acting was a whole other problem.  They were wise to let Bruce Campbell shoulder most of that responsibility.  I also loved their use of light.  They managed to find and place light in impossible situations, where no light source could ever be, and still have it work to their advantage.  The story isn't all that involved, a group of people stranded in a cabin while an unidentified influence rages without and within.  It's a premise that's been done to death.  How they managed to make it feel fresh and new is a testament to their ingenuity.  Decades later, it's still an impressive work of horror and humor.",1395532800,,1225,4.641860465116279

In the search for financing, the 21 year-old Raimi claims he was reduced to begging. When he finally got enough money to shoot, Raimi, armed with a skeleton crew and a budget of $90,000, began what his main star would later call, ""twelve weeks of a mirthless exercise in agony"". Splattered with sticky fake blood, forced to burn the furniture to keep warm, using bicycles and 2x4's as camera equipment, and being subjected to ruthless makeup and action sequences...the cast and crew were harried and literally desperate.

I believe it is that desperation that made THE EVIL DEAD the film it is. Evil Dead is a no-holds-barred kind of film; a ruthless, energetic, dangerous, gritty, campy film in the best way possible. Loaded with black humor, blood-spewing action, and genuine scares (there is no beating the sheer dread you feel with Raimi's zooming tracking shot), this is a film that horror fans will love.

943066,5,6304953747,"The pre-production of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sam-Raimi/dp/B000I9YV2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sam Raimi</a>'s black-comedy horror extravaganza THE EVIL DEAD was so grueling that many people began to think the movie was as cursed as the ancient book that that released flesh-possessing demons on a group of unwitting teenagers. In the search for financing, the 21 year-old Raimi claims he was reduced to begging. When he finally got enough money to shoot, Raimi, armed with a skeleton crew and a budget of $90,000, began what his main star would later call, ""twelve weeks of a mirthless exercise in agony"". Splattered with sticky fake blood, forced to burn the furniture to keep warm, using bicycles and 2x4's as camera equipment, and being subjected to ruthless makeup and action sequences...the cast and crew were harried and literally desperate.

I believe it is that desperation that made THE EVIL DEAD the film it is. Evil Dead is a no-holds-barred kind of film; a ruthless, energetic, dangerous, gritty, campy film in the best way possible. Loaded with black humor, blood-spewing action, and genuine scares (there is no beating the sheer dread you feel with Raimi's zooming tracking shot), this is a film that horror fans will love.

943208,3,6304953747,"The Evil Dead has a HUGE cult following.  It is considered a cult classic.  This doesnt mean that it is a good film, and that is something that should be taken into account here.  This is actually a rather dumb film, and there are many moments when the comedic angle outweighs the fear and turns this into a near camp classic and yet it all works in the end to provide us with a film that deserves to be considered a classic in some sense, even though it is really stupid.  With huge amounts of fake blood, some inspired makeup choices and some really tacky visual effects, The Evil Dead tells us the story of five young adults trapped in a cabin in the woods with a book or the dead that soon allows demons to possess them all one by one.  Ash, the main protagonist, has to deal with his friends turning on him one by one and soon has to dismember them all (including his own girlfriend) or die.  Its easy to see how many current horror filmmakers were inspired by what Raimi did here, even if what he did wasn't as good as many of the horror directors working at the same time (I mean, this same year we saw Scanners and The Howling and An American Werewolf in London and while none of them are spectacular, they all have sharper story lines and better visuals).  Its fun, for sure, and iconic in many ways (that plant scene) but at the end of the day, it is kind of a letdown.",1389225600,,1379,4.200757575757576

But this double pack is a cheaper Korean issued (dare I say, Bootleg?) edition.
The misspellings on the back of the dvd jacket are bad enough, but they also plague the closed captioning.
Fair enough, the first Evil Dead film doesn't necessarily need to be seen at the highest definition to have some old fashioned fun.
And frankly, for a casual Evil Dead viewer, this double set is just fine.
But Evil Dead II is worthy enough to invest in one of the latter released versions, especially to appreciate the camera work and effects.
Can't say I've watched the extras yet.
So, again, just looking to casually get in Evil Dead, sure, jump on this. True Deadite? Save your dough and get the cleaned up Blu Ray.",1388448000,3,807,4.534246575342466

I also enjoyed the remake of this movie they did this year BUT this version (the orgional version) is the better of the whole series..

I would rate the movies this version of ""the evil dead"" then ""Army of darkness"" and Evil, Dead 2 tied at number 2 and the newer 2013 Evil Dead in 3rd place.",1388361600,,555,4.431372549019608

943263,5,6304953747,"The bluray version of this film is the best quality release of this title to date. Everything is clear crisp and clean.(with some grains) The sound quality is so good that i heard things i never have before. Some of the hoky moments in the original anchor bay release are cleaned up nicely. Meaning that some of the ""scary"" moments are actually scary.
The anchor bay dvd i have has two commentaries. Bruce cambell solo(in my opinion the very best commentary for this film) and rob tappert and sam raimi. These are both lost in this version sadly. But the commentary in this one is all new with sam raimi rob tapert and bruce cambell all together discussing things they didn't in the dvd version. There are two versions of the film. original widescreen and the updated full screen. both are identicle other than the theatrical bars on top and bottom of screen.

This film means something to me mainly because it was shot not too far from where i live and all the locals in that area have some pretty funny facts to share with you if you ask around a bit.
If your a big fan of slap stick comedy and horror then you will love all the work sam raimi and rob tapert does.

Another great horror movie to check out is Return of the living dead part three. The third stands alone and is in my opinion one of the purest B movie horror there is bside this one. Oh yeah and check out Mutant another great B movie horror.

Buy this film. I'm shocked that there is no box set of the Evil Dead franchise in the US. A 3-disc Evil Dead Trilogy box set on Blu-ray is available in Region 2 with some new extras for Evil Dead 2. It also includes vintage extras (including the Bruce Campbell hosted documentary which was previously only avaliable on the ""Evil Dead: Book of the Dead"" release).

I can understand the bad special effects because it was made in the 80s. But that's it. It was so bad! The acting was terrible. The camera was too noticeable. Why are there so many close ups of the actors faces? There was a scene where a character was possessed and every time the angle changed her hair went from straight, to long to curly. And when Ash gets sprayed by blood on his face and then enters the house there is no blood at all. Not even a stain. I understand the older people liking this when they first saw it. But when it's 2013 and your saying its still good, I recomend that you watch it again. Even for a low budget movie, they could do a lot better.",1374278400,,842,4.140243902439025
943555,5,6304953747,"Ya know Im watching the original Evil Dead tonight, and Ive got to say, the original is better.
Im fully aware of how clich that is to say, but it is but the fact remains that THE Evil Dead is, creepier, more unique, and more memorable than the decent but forgettable 2013 remake Evil Dead.

1. The original  has more unusual moments, moments that set it apart from anything else on film.

2.  It has more of a mood; the harsh white lighting, the fog, the cabin itself.  The low production values in actually give it a look like nothing else.

3. Better sound: Scenes like the iconic POV shots, the tape, the crazy unnatural noises the deadites make, the weird ghostly sound that is heard at some level in almost every scene.

4. It even has better dialog; and the fact that that dialog was recited by actors who learned their trade by reject actors of the 50s somehow made it creepier.  And then theres Bruce Campbell.

5. The cheap special effects actually added something.  Weve all seen red-colored liquid as blood a billion times; but the original Evil Dead used oozing yellow puss, a milk-like fluid, and Im pretty sure I even saw cottage cheese coming out of one.  While there isn't anything inherently scary about cottage cheese; its unusual to say the least to see it oozing from a human body; and thats the charm of The Evil Dead.

Perhaps my biggest complaint in the new Evil Dead is that they re-make all the easy scenes, but left out the complicated ones; the ones I really wanted to see re-shot with modern technology and a budget.  To quote: I fear the only way to stop those possessed by the spirits of this book is by the act of bodily dismemberment  See the original deadites where the horror equivalent of the Terminator;  hard to kill.  In the remake one apparently dies of natural causes!  Sure she had lost a couple limbs and had a few nails in her; but come on, thats nothing.  I wanted to see the full dismemberment.  I wanted to see the dissolving deadite.

The remake wasn't all bad.  I enjoyed the film; Ill buy it; it was still better than 90% of the horror films released.  Over all the special effects are more realistic; the actors are better, especially Jane Levy, and the film did have some moments.  But honestly; if it weren't for the original the new Evil Dead would be entirely forgettable.",1374192000,,2327,4.488095238095238

943561,5,6304953747,"Before ""Spider-Man,"" Sam Raimi started off as the director of the classic fright film ""The Evil Dead,"" which, to this day, is one of the hippest horror films ever.

Ash, his girlfriend Linda, his sister Cheryl, and his friends Scott and Shelly head out to an isolated cabin in the woods for some fun. But right from the beginning, strange things happen. Cheryl hears voices howling ""Join us!"" And then, Ash and Scott find a recording of a ritual from a book called The Book of the Dead. Too bad for them, because that ritual releases soul-hungry demons who possess everybody in the cabin. The only way to stop the demons is through the act of bodily dismemberment, and it's up to Ash to return the demons to their resting place. However, it's not gonna be easy.

""The Evil Dead"" can be very scary, but it's mostly great fun to watch due to its shameless amount of gore. This movie goes so over the top, it sort of becomes comic, and I dig that.

Bruce Campbell has created such an icon out of Ash, a character who has lasted through 3 films. Campbell is a master. The other cast is very good with Ellen Sandweiss as Cheryl, Hal Delrich as Scott, Betsy Baker as Linda and Sarah York as Shelly.

""The Evil Dead"" is a movie done with so much love for the genre, and a movie like that only comes once in a while. Hilariously gory, well-acted, and great fun to watch on a nice Halloween night, a horror movie like this doesn't get any better. A classic!

This movie is a must own for any horror fan.",1372982400,2,1494,4.340501792114695
943650,5,6304953747,"Tho I thoroughly enjoyed this movie with many a laugh I do prefer Army of Darkness.

This is/will be one of those campy cult films that have you relaxing while watching and laughing til you cry.  The effects (tho said on IMDB, you can see wires)  I don't watch movies to pick them apart, tho I do enjoy reading the trivia from IMDB while watching movies for (sometimes) interesting facts.

This movie along with it's sequels really doesn't really require any thought process, it's more of a kick your feet up, sit back and vegg out movies and enjoy for what it is.

It is best to watch them in order to better understand the characters.  Even still I highly recommend this movie for some laughs especially with friends over to help with the chuckles, they may see something you missed while wiping your eyes.

No doubt it has retained the power to do so successfully even to this day---at least if you are not in a setting where communal unease creates defensive laughter and mockery. You have to decide for yourself before watching. No doubt it is good horror but is it a good (as opposed to financially successful) movie. My opinion is not of any use on the subject; I would simply advise that this is a film best watched with a group of people.

I regretted this movie for so many reasons.  All of the tackiness of Evil Dead 2 that made it special and fun to watch did not work in this movie.  It was really just over the top gore and that's about it.  Campbell didn't even really have the charm that he is so well known for in this one.

Originally this film MAY have been of the super scary genre. I found the film to be VERY tame, amateurish and suitable for the dust bin. The cast would appear to have been brought in from a local amateur group, with the characters standing around waiting to say their lines. The 'horror' make-up is just that, horrible. I guess that the director Sam Raimi had to start somewhere and this film appears to  be right up there at the starting line. I found myself thinking that enough was enough, and the temptation to stop watching the movie becoming 'possessive' as the minutes ticked by. I've since watched EVIL DEAD 2 and can only say that this sequel was much in the vein of its' predecessor. I couldn't recommend The Evil Dead.

944085,1,6304953747,"Man, I got the Special Collector's Edition of The Evil Dead tonight
and got through maybe 30 minutes of it before giving up.  First of all
I'm a longtime serious horror fan and writer/critic/author in the field
for nearly 30 years and I somehow missed The Evil Dead when it first
came out, probably because I was just too young to get into a theater
to see it.  I'm also a massive Lovecraft and weird fiction scholar, fan,
and expert in the field, which is another reason I was interested in finally
seeing it due to the alleged Lovecraftian elements.

I happen to be a massive George Romero fan (I've written an entry/essay for the
Supernatural Literature of the World Encyclopedia on his classic film MARTIN)
because I feel his early films in particular deliver the gore and the scares with more intelligence
and craftsmanship than most horror directors.  I never warmed to directors like Raimi, Wes Craven,
and a lot of the others (Stuart Gordon, Fulci as well, a schlockmeister at best) that so
many of my peers and fellow horror nuts seem to worship slavishly.  I don't.
This movie SUCKS. It might've seemed scary or good when I was 15 or whatever
but all it did was bore and annoy me trying to watch it now.  I always pretty
much felt the same way about most slasher type horror films even though I know
this one is not quite merely a slasher/teen body count type film.  I never
was a huge fan of Friday the 13th either, barely so of Halloween and only then
because the once-great John Carpenter was the man behind it.

Sorry, The Evil Dead wasn't even good for the Lovecraft influences which
prove to be so lame and bastardized in this film that it doesn't even make it
worth watching for HPL fans to catch any mention of the Necronomicon which it's
not even actually CALLED in the film (although the DVD box copy claims it is).
Or maybe I've just outgrown these types of films, or some of the lower common
denominator of the horror genre, which both could also be true.  All I know
is, if I want a quality horror film I'll watch The Shining (warts and all),
ALIEN, The Exorcist, Dawn of the Dead (original), Christine, Burnt Offerings,
ANYTHING but this wretched low budget bomb from 1982.  I also had similar feelings about The Hills Have
Eyes: when I was in summer camp when it first came out everyone was like
oh Scott it's so scary you'll have a heart attack if you see it but of course
I didn't cause I was too young at the time, obviously, and then
when I finally watched a good deal of it on IFC a few years back, unedited,
IT SUCKED.

Why people think these are good films is beyond me.  I know you
have to take into account that they are low-budget indie. productions,
that goes without saying, but so what, if the film is lame it's lame,
no matter what the budget.  I also heard years ago the hype that The Evil
Dead was so ahead of its time, so intense and X-rated (or nearly so) in its
graphic horror, and ultraviolent and not for the squeamish and it's not even close to those
descriptions.  False advertising, even for 1982.  They spouted the same
nonsense for Dawn of the Dead and that was intense but was also mainly
marketing/promotional b.s. As for Evil Dead, it's mainly just predictable
hackwork and boring as all get out.  Even Friday the 13th #1 or #2 have
more surprises and original scares than The Evil Dead.  Ho hum. And I generally HATE
those stupid movies.

Sorry, The Evil Dead didn't do it for me.  It's going back in its case
and back into the basement!  Fast!  And this is dedicated to the spirit of
master film critic Roger Ebert (and Gene Siskel too), just for kicks. I really do think of Roger
everytime I write anything, especially on film.  Now you'll excuse me as I go put
my ""pretentious"" film fanatic hat back on and go watch some Louis Malle films.  Well,
at least I'm sure it won't be four wasted hours with any of his stuff!",1365033600,,3875,4.403927068723703

The movie itself is just amazing and I had no trouble with the blu ray. I had read several reviews when I ordered this about the quality and possibility of it not even working.

This is my first review on here, so I will make my point. Evil Dead is a scary and shocking movie about a group of college students vacationing in a cabin in the woods, who stumble upon an old book called ""The Book of the Dead"" and accidentally summon demons. All HELL breaks loose -literally, from there as Ash (the main protaganist played by an early Bruce Campbell) tries to save his girlfriend and buddies from the evil powers lurking in the woods! This movie has lots of good gore effects and really creeped me out. There is no comedy thrown in here like what the sequels Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness had.

Putting aside the possessed vine scene (which was cringe-worthy and could have been left out without affecting the story), this movie is ridiculous fun and strangely charming. The movie is clearly low budget and the effects are sloppy and nowhere near realistic. Bruce Campbell's performance only hints at his acting style that we eventually see in #3.

944253,1,6304953747,"Back in the early 80's I can understand this film creating a buzz. It is an over the top gore fest which probably pushed the envelope for it's time and made it a memorable experience. Practically the last half of the film is dedicated to shocking you with puss, gallons of blood, roaches and more blood flowing freely from the gouges of every demon extremity you can think of. The overall experience is a comical and gag inducing one which is undoubtedly intentioned. This is all fine and dandy but the film seemingly relies wholly on the viscera alone. Let's put it this way, the characters (spoiler) get possessed then become a bloody practical effects mess. This is all there is to the flick.

Absolution to logic is required to nearly all horror films but this one requires so much that the viewer loses interest into taking it seriously at all. Example, a woman is terrified and is left in a car with no motivation as to why her driver has left her behind. He didn't discover something (like in a Slasher film), he wasn't possessed (like in a Satanic film), he was simply...away, to provide a jump scare for the audience. The acting is notably bad...even for a horror film...in the 80's. The sacred Ash is the clear winner for worst actor in the film. For example when he is asked to hit one of the demons he stands there dazed not in a ""I""m so horrified I'm frozen in place"" way but rather ""I""m hoping that Ripley will induct me as his newest model for the wax museum.""

I suspect that this film's success relies heavily on the fan-bases' memories from when they were more impressionable. I understand that it has no intention to be The Shining but for today most horror fans will request more meat to bite into instead of just the gristle.",1361404800,2,1746,4.504731861198739

Secondly the film itself, two different version of it both complete pieces of crap. The original version didn't fit my screen at all, but what both of them had that was just god awful. The films themselves were horribly remastered for blu-ray. I mean so horrible I'm pretty sure dvd and vhs had out-beaten it in quality. The film was extremely grainy throughout most of the film, looked like sandpaper with the film printed over it with cheap ink. It was that bad. The audio quality seemed a bit better than the original but audio to visual ratio not worth it at all. I hate it so much I'm probably going to resell this pos. I own the other 2 of this series and I must say those are remaster very well. I have the 25th anniversary edition of Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness screwhead edition. I hope they have another version of this film with better quality because I feel cheated both out of money and out of loyalty to their fans. Do not buy!",1348185600,2,1274,4.334728033472803
944488,5,6304953747,"There comes a point when you watch a movie and you're marginally impressed with it and feel a bit underwhelmed after all the accolades and positive rapture it received from fans. But when you watch a movie again in a new format that truly demonstrates what this film was going for, you realize it's not the movie that was wrong, but you.

Such was the case with ""Evil Dead"", in which a couple of years ago, I gave it an average review and criticized its supposed bad acting and script holes but praised its production values (I have since deleted this review and replace it with this one). Watching it again on Blu-Ray, I can finally understand the entire hullabaloo. The goofy acting actually adds rather takes away from the film and as for the script errors - well, nobody complained about how Rick's raincoat suddenly dried up after reading Elsa's letter in ""Casablanca"". ""Evil Dead"" is, far from underwhelming, a relentless experience from beginning to end. In fact, it is so unremittingly intense that Raimi had to make its sequel considerably lighter in tone.

Watching ""Evil Dead"" made me discover all the hidden nuances that I didn't see the first time I saw. The supposedly ""dumb"" characters that Raimi created was intentional - unlike most slasher films, that lazily goes through the motions to set up a character's death, the way Raimi sets up these characters' mistakes and inevitable demises has weight because he shows us how a minor foolish action could have severe ramifications. Take, for example, the scene where Cheryl is raped by the trees in the forest. The scene is shocking in its gleeful violence, but the aftermath gives it weight. Cheryl tells her friends the experience, but none of them believe her. This subsequently leads to a chilling scene involving a deck of cards where a demonically possessed Cheryl goes berserk and stabs Linda with a pencil, which in turns leads to her possession. Thus we find out the motivation behind such sequences - small human errors leads to large ramifications to all the characters involved and it becomes an endless cycle until one character is left standing.

If there is an argument where less is more, then ""Evil Dead"" is truly the model of that argument. The way Sam Raimi builds scenes for the inevitable scare and the gruesome murder now strikes me as impressive enough, but the methods he used to make the film bigger is astonishing given the film's pathetic budget. The claustrophobic sets, the drearily grainy imagery and the dark shadows lurking outside the cabin and in that dreaded cellar add to the horror, creating a frightening experience for viewers who want to get out but are trapped inside much like the film's ill-fated characters.

Unfortunately, this was something that I didn't notice when I watched it on DVD a few years ago. Watching it on Blu-Ray, however, I understood the director's intentions. The 16mm camerawork of ""Evil Dead"" is extremely effective in capturing the grit and violent imagery on film. In that sense, Raimi's challenge in overcoming all kinds of deficiencies that would have been solved by a few extra million dollars benefits rather than takes away from the picture.

As far as the goofy acting is concerned, I have another confession: I enjoyed it. First time I saw it, I didn't like it. But watching it again made me rethink my opinions. Far from an example of bad acting; the ""dumb characters"" now strikes me as comic relief and their goofiness even adds to the gallows humor to the seemingly scary sequences. One of the best moments comes when a possessed Cheryl grabs Ash by the throats, which leads to Ash whining at the demons for tormenting him. Suddenly, he turns away to see one of Ash's possessed friends gleefully declare, ""We're gonna get you"". It's a wonderful sequence that's both funny and scary at the same time.

""Evil Dead"" is a movie that warrants second viewing even by people who hated it the first time they watched it. On my first viewing, I was underwhelmed by the film given the hype. Watching it on Blu-Ray made me want to stab a pencil on my ankle for not realizing the film's brilliance. ""Evil Dead"" is the ""Detour"" of horror movies: a zero-budget movie that overcame its financial hurdles to deliver a visceral experience for viewers and in doing so redefined its genre. The Blu-Ray enhances the experience even further, providing an exceptionally grainy video (remember, this was shot on 16mm) and a rousing Dolby True HD 5.1 track. As for the bonus features, unfortunately I bought the bare-bones Blu-Ray version that only contains the audio commentary track (recommended for those who want to make films with minimal production values), but there is a limited edition out there that contains a DVD disc featuring numerous supplements. Either way, don't even think of starting your horror collection without this great picture.",1347667200,,4870,4.86144578313253

944493,5,6304953747,"Some People tend to forget this is about DEMONS possessing people... Instead they are called zombies and treated exactly like zombies, as soulless, brainless dead beings that don't torture or torment.... Unlike these Demons! These badass demons don't only possess, they drive people to the brink of insanity... just look at Bruce's character (Ash) he was a coward until he stopped be a wimp and realized that he had to take action and fast.

Plot: Five friends go to a cabin in the woods but soon they disturb some demons by playing a recording that has an evil spell that unleashes these crafty and soul-seeking demons that will stop at nothing to cause pain, torment and in some instances relief but only until their victim's guard is down.... now five becomes four and then three and so on and so forth... who will survive the Atmospheric, Disturbing, and Dark Night of Unholy Terror!

Review: It's so unoriginal.... but the way it was done cries out that it is original. Everything from the way they maneuvered the camera and the angles that were shot perfectly... to the dated yet modern special effects that are almost as painful to watch as they were a little over thirty years ago. Bruce Campbell I'll admit wasn't as good in this one as he was in part two or three but if you watch the documentaries then you'll probably know why... even Eli Roth says in a brief description that before he has his actors perform he has them watch THE EVIL DEAD and tells them to imagine how hard and sticky it was for Bruce Campbell to do all his own stunts to the point of him becoming a blood target for these menacing monsters. The movie itself has what I like to call a genuine white walls, black backgrounds atmosphere which means that the house itself (or in this case, the cabin) is gritty and has a raw feel to it and when the camera moves a certain way you are only looking at that one object and everything else is black because of how hideous or deformed that one object's appearance is. It happened in films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and in my Opinion a low-budget independent film titled Dark Harvest.... The object in this movie is the gore.... and by god are the bloody dismemberments graphic as all hell. This movie (as much as it is gory) is not hilarious by any means.... it just has incredibly morbid and dark humor to the point where it actually starts to creep you out. This is a B-Movie but it is one of the Best damn B-Movies ever made and it has ranked upon my top three pure horror films from before the 90's the other two are The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Exorcist for the time being but there are still plenty of 1970-1989 horror flicks that I haven't seen and I for one know that terror will always be better when it is done in three ways.. To the extreme, to the intensity level that turns beds into lemonade stands all the way to B-Movie Fun!

Acting: Superb... it was an 80's movie so most movies of the era were acted cheesy but it worked and it did a damn fine job controlling its cheesiness and it was even modernly acted in some scenes that were done just right, no complaints here!

Gore: Bloody dismemberments, decomposing bodies (great stop animation by the way), a graphic body hacking scene, gory gun shots, a groovy decapitation, a disturbing yet gruesome eye gouging, a painful looking pencil stab in the heal scene.... and plenty more... this one will not let gore hounds down!

Bottom Line: One of The best movie it's kind and this movie acts as a lot of things, a suspenseful thriller, a gorefest, a black humored and disturbing thrill seeker, and a rollercoaster ride that makes you think it is close to over when the nightmare has just begun!

944539,5,6304953747,"WARNING: SPOILERS

First things first: this movie is insane. Between the brutal violence, some of the most disturbing imagery ever put to film (girl getting raped by a tree, anyone?), and mind-blowing camera work, this movie is a totally mad ride. And it's one darn awesome ride. This is one of the very few horror films that actually disturbed me. And that's something that I always like in a horror film. This film is friggin' freaky. Lets rate by category, shall we?

1: Story: 9/10
  The story, while simple and kind of contrived, is very good simply because of the way that it is told. The story is simple: 5 college students go on vacation to an abandoned log cabin in the woods. While there, they discover a tape recorder that explains the book of the dead, and recites the passages. Turns out, that allows demons to posses the living, and all hell breaks loose. Eventually, only Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) left, and he destroys them by burning the book. This leads to our next subject.

2: Special effects: 9.5/10
  Holy frikkin' crap. These are some of the best special effects of the 80's, especially when considering the extremely low budget. The ending where Ash burns the book of the dead leads to a beautifully disgusting array of stop motion animation, in which the demons/corpses rapidly decompose in a mess of blood, guts, maggots, and creamed corn. Yes, creamed corn. It's nasty, disgusting, revolting, and totally awesome. Very well done. As for the make-up effects, they are fantastic. They look a tad chalky compared to today's make-up effects, but they still look fantastic and grotesque, and will definitely stick with you for a while. The practical effects (blood, guts, and so on) look fantastic. The budget must have gone straight to the special effects, because they are really good and well done.

3: Musical Score: 10/10
  The musical score, done by Joseph LoDuca, is perfect. Most of it is synthesized, and it fits quite nicely. The score adds to and fits perfectly with the scary and dark, yet fun and entertaining tone. It is perfect for this film.

4: Acting: 9/10
  For the most part, the acting is pretty good for a movie of this genre/caliber, but there are times where the acting does feel forced, but this is only a minor complaint. The acting is quite good most of the time.

Overall score: 10/10

  This is by far the best horror film I have ever seen. Yes, there are some minor complaints, but the good far surpasses the bad. I wholly recommend watching this film, as well as the 2 sequels, Evil Dead 2, and Army Of Darkness. This film is, frankly, awesome. I definitely, wholly, and excruciatingly recommend this amazing film, as well as the totally awesome and 'groovy' sequels.",1338940800,4,2724,4.737288135593221

944541,4,6304953747,"Working with a very limited budget and shooting over a couple of years, Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert, Bruce Campbell, and Joel Coen (along with many collaborators) managed to produce a horror movie where five college students, while having a weekend in a rented cabin down in the woods, uncover a book called the Necronomicon, which releases the spirits of the dead who now haunt, curse, and torture the five college students over a single night.

Shot on 16 mm, the movie shows clever use of the camera, which is not only used to film the characters' actions, but also to play the role of the spirits of the dead as they track and haunt Ash and his friends. The music, composed by Joseph LoDuca, is very effective and adds the perfect tension to the story, along with a few comic elements like during that scene between Ash and Linda when he wants to offer to her a gift. Evil Dead also has lots of gore and clever use of stop motion to show the characters transformation into dead living creatures. The smoke effects in the forest also gave an eerie presence to the wooden cabin and the surrounding woods as they gave another visual demonstration that the evil forces in the Necronomicon were haunting the characters.

This movie also reveals the genre-bending traits of Sam Raimi's movies, as he mixes both comedy and dramatic scenes in his stories and productions. For this movie, it works pretty well though the only few criticisms I had with the story was that there were probably too much characters, including some that were underdeveloped like Shelly. I also felt that the story dragged around the end, like when Ash is trying to get his grip to what is happening or when the corpses decompose themselves, and could have been shortened at seventy minutes. Nevertheless, the story was fun to watch and I especially liked the final camera trick at the end of the movie, which to me will probably become, and maybe already did, a classic element to horror movies.

Although the movie did had some continuity mistakes (i.e.: hair cuts, light directions, etc.) which were due to the shooting constraints that Raimi and his team had on the film's shooting which went over a couple of years, I admired the energy and will that comes out of this project as a couple of people managed to make a movie that launched their careers, but also a series of movies set in the Evil Dead universe, including a sequel that revised for better the events of this movie with only two characters (the most interesting ones of this story and combined with traits coming from the other characters), an excellent ending, and less gore than in this first version.",1330387200,3,2641,4.675268817204301

Of course as we all know this was the film Robert Tapert,Sam Raimi(later of Xena & Hercules,and Bruce Campbell all cut their filmic ""teeth"" on and the rest is history. The film itself deserves no more than about 3 1/2 stars,being a just above-average flick. I am no fan of Anchor bay but they have put together a three -disc set here,worthy of say a Criterion company release;but more on that later.
The plot as we all know by now involves a couple of guys with girlfriends and a sister tagging along,who all decide to head out into the remote woods to a cabin. There they find a tape recorder and a strange notebook(that we all come to know is the Necronomicon).They play the tape recorder and find it has the voice of a professor on it,and as he chants some ancient words it arouses spirits in the woods that slowly but surely attack the cabin and everyone in it. One by one the girls and eventually one of the guys all become Deadites and attack Ash,who remains the only one still standing and possession free throughout the movie. But Ash has his work cut out for him(literally and figuratively)as he has to kill each one of his friends. The spirits make it clear they want EVERYONE(""join us"") and at the end,as Ash stands alone outside the cabin,the strange entity comes at him in a head long rush as he screams into the lens...fade to black.
I recall the movie originally and it was quite the gorefest when it first debuted. It certainly looks tame now,as have alot of its contemporaries. They had lightened the rating system I recall in the early 70s so things got a little bit more intense,if that's the word,on screen. Filmmakers really started to push the envelope. What was rated ""R"" back in the 60s is now about PG today;it's amazing(the times they have a-changed!),but I digress. The special effects,as primitive as they were for the late 70s,still stand up pretty good today. Raimi and company made the most of what they had and used every trick in the book to convey that sense of isolation,dread and horror that became the trademark of the Evil Dead series. Bruce Campbell of course as Ash really makes the movie,as he goes from a very wimpish type character and converts into a much stronger one,due to the forces that he is pitted against. It's do or die and Ash doesn't want to die as his friends did. The rest of the cast do an admirable job and while it is no Citizen Kane,Campbell and company manage to pull it all off pretty well.
Technically speaking the film,though shot in 16mm,looks and sounds very good in these prints. It was originally shot full frame so Anchor Bay has gone and included BOTH the full frame AND widescreen prints here for your edification! Each disc has extras and the third is dedicated to nothing but extras. They include:Commentary on the widescreen print by the directors,commentary on the full frame version by Campbell,poster and memorabilia gallery,trailer and TV spots,make up tests,featurettes about the women of the Evil Dead,Campbell and Ted Raimi WITH the women of E/D,discovering E/D,a premiere in 2006 at a Drive In w/ the full cast,the cast at a convention,a reunion panel AND a replica of one of the original theater posters thrown in for good measure. Phew! As I said this is a release worthy of the Criterion company and as such that is why the high marks;as they just put the whole package right over the top.
All in all a highly recommended release for fans of the first of the three of this gorefest series. Though not the best it's still pretty darn good and it still has some scare the pants off of you moments throughout. This edition has both the original full frame print and the specially made widescreen print. And with all the extras,there is NO other version to get the Deadite of your choosing.

944570,4,6304953747,"Evil Dead has much higher name recognition than actual presence on TV and probably availability in general.  After seeing clips from it and periodic references to elsewhere, I finally saw this movie.  I was surprised both good and bad.  It was played up in my mind as distinctive, a bit cheesy, and with a cheap look that might keep it off TV.  None of that was true.  The movie attempts to be serious, is a bit dull from having fight scenes which are just a bit too long, and is solid but not memorable.

The story begins as five friends (two couples, and the sister of one of the men) go camping in a cabin in the woods.  When night comes, a few odd things happen, and investigation leads to the discovery of some odd artifacts, including a tape recording.  When the friends play the tape recording, a scholar of ancient texts explains that he has translated and will read the text of an ancient book which describes how to summon demons.  The tape recorded incantation summons all kinds of trouble including blocked escape routes from the forest, trees raping a camper, and eventually demonic possession for some of the campers.  This leads to some over-the-top gore in the context of demonic possession, including blood dripping and praying from inannimate objects and eventually people.  It isn't terribly scarey because it's over-the-top.

You probably already know whether you want to watch this or not.  The tree rape scene makes a viewing worthwhile, if you are into horror movies.",1318896000,,1490,4.750972762645914

Each page has detailed drawings from the films and are written in a font that can be fun to decipher.

944625,5,6304953747,"I'm pretty sure I cant say anything NEW about this film that my drones of fellow horror film fanatics haven't already said, but heck, why not try? My dad first introduced me to the Evil Dead series when I was about ten years old, back in '04 or '05. I'd never seen a Sam Raimi film, except for the Spider Man films. Since I left the womb I'd been watching horror films, I remember being like eight years old and skimming the racks in my small video store for the weirdest, craziest horror film I could find, sometimes renting crap, and other times renting insane and awesome movies like Saw 1(I don't care for the other Saw movies) or stuff like Cabin Fever. Yes, I watched movies like this in my prime youth, well, maybe not eight, but like ten or eleven. But when my dad popped in his old VHS of Evil Dead 2, I didn't like it, in fact, I thought it was retarded. Wait! Dont pull those triggers yet, fire squad, let me explain. I was ten, okay? I didn't get, nor was I fan at the time of campy films. But then a year or two later, I saw Evil Dead on IFC. THAT changed my view FOREVER on horror films. I was amazed by it, the cinematography, its complete and absolute awareness of what it was, and what it wanted to be, Bruce Campbell, oh, what a sexy beast, and the forest rape scene! Come on! It was hilarious, out there, insane, crazy, scary, and just fun. It was a thrill ride, and I knew I had discovered something amazing. I went back and watched Evil Dead 2, and finally liked it. In fact, I loved *it* as well, not nearly as much as Evil Dead, but still loved it. Then I saw Army of Darkness, and well, lets just say when I first saw AoD, I crapped myself in the wake of its awesomeness. Evil Dead is one of those films that, if I'm having a late night horror film marathon, which I have like, once every four weeks or so, it has to go first, second, or last. In front, after Re-Animator, or just after Hills Have Eyes(original, remake sucked). Its one of those films thats not only just a grand tour de force in horror, but also inspiring, and lets you realize that you too could make films, you just need the right ingredients for the meal. :)",1310515200,,2153,4.177884615384615

The Evil Dead is the first of the his deadite trilogy and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash, an everyman thrown into a decidedly unusual situation. The plot is simple, but perfectly functional. What drives this film is Raimi's keen understanding of the audience. The camera and pacing is tight, allowing little room for the audience to catch a breath. This results in a rush which only the very best of horror movies can produce. Although the effects have aged, there is no denying that The Evil Dead was an early sign of the young Raimi's gift behind the camera.",1293580800,,692,4.588709677419355
944629,5,6304953747,"Sam Raimi is known for breaking genre boundaries, and it all began with his first feature film, The Evil Dead, which is a cross between a zombie flick and a demon flick. Five college students take a holiday in the woods of Tennessee, spending the weekend in a creepy, run-down cabin with a cellar that doesn't like to stay closed. Exploring the cellar, they find, yes, in the middle of Tennessee, a Sumerian Book of the Dead, the Morturom Demonto. They also find a recording of someone reading passages from the book; playing it, they unwittingly awaken slumbering demons who are looking to possess the first human they find. That's the demon part. The zombie aspect is that these demons like to eat human flesh.

A truly inventive horror film, with excellent camerawork, scriptwriting, and directing. The Evil Dead was made in a era of slasher sex-and-death horror. There is very little slashing, no sex, a whole lot of death, but a whole lot of undeath, too. Evil Dead doesn't fall neatly into any genre, especially given when it was made. The psychological trauma that the demons exact is fascinating and creepy at the same time. They have no plan, no ultimate motive, no guiding Lucifer--they are merely annoyed at being awoken and enjoying their playtime. Bruce Campbell does an particularly excellent job in playing a man that is struggling to retain his sanity and reason. And the ending is genuinely surprising and disturbing.

944704,5,6304953747,"Evil Dead is a must-see for horror fans.

The version I watched was the Special Edition which says ""Elite Entertainment Presents"" at the top of the DVD box. It has two commentaries, one with Bruce Campbell talking and another one with the makers of the film Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert talking. It also has as an extra some clips of takes from the making of the movie.

I would like to note here that the movie was originally filmed in full screen, so the full screen format on this DVD is the original format for the movie. It was not originally filmed in widescreen. Its a fullscreen movie.

The movie is about some college students who go to a cabin in the outdoors to have a good time, but instead they accidently unleash demons. Bruce Campbell who plays Ash is the star of the film. He's great. At the beginning he doesn't yet have his persona down but as the film progresses he matures.

""Evil Dead"" is extremely gory and terrifying. The first time I watched it, I watched some parts standing so I could exit the room before it got too scary. In some of the scenes I was so scared that I closed my eyes and covered my ears because I couldn't take it anymore.

Of the two commentaries that come with the movie the better of the two is the one with Bruce Campbell. He makes really funny comments as the movie goes along and his commentary is very entertaining.

While it might have less plot, story, or interesting characters as other horror movies have, it achieves what it claims to be, and does horror and gore better than most movies to date, pulling it off with humor and style.

  The movie is a remarkable achievement for its budget and filmmakers' level of experience. A few college students with an investor-given budget of $375,000 filmed it. They traveled to a cabin in the woods and made a funny, gory, and certainly scary monster movie.

  During the movie, four teens spend the night at a cabin, without a clue of the horrors that await them. When they open the lavishly designed Book of the Dead, the terror is unleashed and evil spirits consume the youths one by one. They become monsters, and taunt the ones who haven't by making themselves human at times.

  The special effects are quite an eye-filler, especially given the cheap animation they used it with. Performances are decent, but the monsters are the real show-stealer. It's easy to see why this was a cult classic from its 1982 to this day.",1287446400,,1156,4.655172413793103

Every few years they give us a new reason to buy the film.  I anticipate the ""extended version"" will be available in a few years.  It is the limited edition version I am reviewing here.

Blu-ray does clean up the picture some but the biggest improvement in my opinion is in the sound.  The better the sound the better the presentation  Older films like this one can be cleaned up digitally but I personally do not like enhancement and prefer the digital master to be made from a good analog source rather than attempt ""improving it"".

944761,5,6304953747,"There have been tons of horror movies released over the years. Many critics have noted that the horror films run in cycles with the original films eventually downplayed to comic status (note the original FRANKENSTEIN and DRACULA found there way to pairings with Abbott and Costello). That all changed during the 80s when horror films became more of a mainstream favorite and home video took off. Now horror films are playing nearly all the time in theaters.

But even those movies don't always elicit fan devotion or repeated viewings. Sure many people have favorites but a true classic stands the test of time and continues to offer goose bumps and nightmare ideas repeatedly. Such is the case with the Sam Raimi directed EVIL DEAD.

Released in 1985 (though credits often cite the release date as 1981), the film was a terrifying experience in a theater. I know, that's where I first saw it. The film was released through Thorn/EMI back in the 80s on home video and then bounced around until it ended up at Anchor Bay a few years back. Then Anchor Bay made it one of their staples releasing numerous incantations of the title, everything from special edition boxed sets to bound in the Book of the Dead cover (a main icon of the movie). Finally they've released the film on blu-ray. So is it worth going out and buying the new edition if you own one of the umpteen other ones? The answer is yes.

Let's get one thing out of the way first. The synopsis for those who haven't seen one of the many versions. The story revolves around two couples and a sister of one of the guys heading out to the country to enjoy a nice peaceful weekend. Scott (Richard Demanincor) is dating Shelly (Theresa Tilly), Ash (Bruce Campbell who also co-produced) is dating Linda (Betsy Baker) and Ash's sister Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) is along for the trip.

The five head to the secluded cabin that can only be reached by crossing a dangerously outdated bridge. Once they arrive at the cabin they work on cleaning it up and trying to settle in, unaware of the evil that resides there. It's not until the cellar door tosses itself open and the look in the cellar that things begin to change. They come across an old tape player and a strange looking book that they discover is the Book of the Dead. The house had belonged to an archeologist who had discovered the book and only realized too late that it contained a pathway for demons.

So what do they do? Why of course they play the tape that recites an incantation that releases the demons, the first of which eventually possesses Ash's sister Cheryl. But not until after she investigates some noises outside only to be grabbed by wild vines and raped by a tree branch. To this day this scene is still disturbing though not as graphic as many films released today.

The night proceeds and each of the cabin dwellers finds themselves attacked or possessed with only Ash tormented from beginning to end and never taken over. The film offers tons of gooey gore, slashed limbs, stabbings, gunshots and oozing gruesome goodies for fans but by today's standards...well yeah it's still pretty extreme at times. So much so that when originally released, the film was attacked in Britain and placed on the notorious ""Video Nasties"" list for films that were banned.

While watching this film I was listening to the new voice over track that features commentary by director Sam Raimi (who later directed the SPIDER MAN movies), Rob Tapert (who went on to produce TV series like XENA and HERCULES as well as most of Raimi's movies) and Bruce Campbell (who went on to star in TV series like BRISCO COUNTY JR and can currently be seen in BURN NOTICE), but in the background I watched the film. Having seen it numerous times I knew what was going on and wanted to hear the new commentary (which was great focusing on how they got the movie made). The thing I noticed while watching was that the movie still held up. It was still a frightening film. I could see that this movie would induce nightmares in younger viewers and perhaps even in some of the older one. It is still one scary flick.

And that's why it stands the test of time. That's why even after 25 years the movie is still an experience that will frighten most movie goers. Even sitting in your living room with the TV going it will be a scary movie with certain scenes that will elicit screams. There are few movies that leave images in your brain that you remember later and this is one.

One thing that helps I think is that the acting seems pretty good for a group of first timers or actors who had done so little. These people are believable in their roles and that makes the movie that more believable, even when you have severed limbs crawling or demons running rampant. All do a great job and its sad that of those involved on Campbell has gone on to more recognizable roles.

So as for the film itself, yes, it is one scary horror film and deserves to be watched over and over again. It won't make a difference how many times you watch; it will remain scary and give you the creeps time and time again. And that's the sure fire test of whether a movie is worth buying or not, if you can watch it again and again.

So what does this new blu-ray disc offer? Well first off Raimi supervised the reconstruction of the film from original prints giving you a great 1080p HD transfer. Kind of amazing seeing as how the film was shot on 16mm back in the early 80s. It also offers a choice of aspect ratios to watch it in, either a 1.85 ratio or a 1.33 ratio, both featuring Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio as well as the commentary track I mentioned earlier.

A second disc in the set offers some interesting things as well. The usual cover art/set photos are there for one. It also features some featurettes that have been available in past editions but are now brought together here. These include ONE BY ONE WE WILL TAKE YOU:THE UNTOLD SAGA OF THE EVIL DEAD, THE EVIL DEAD:TREASURES FROM THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR, THE LADIES OF THE EVIL DEAD MEET BRUCE CAMPBELL, BOOK OF THE DEAD:THE OTHER PAGES, DISCOVERING THE EVIL DEAD, UNCONVENTIONAL and AT THE DRIVE IN. Of these extras, THE LADIES..., UNCONVENTIONAL and DRIVE IN were all made in part a few years back at the Flashback convention held in Chicago where the cast reunited for the first time since making the movie. The three female leads continue to tour the convention circuit now and then under the Ladies of title thrilling fans.

So there you have it. A run down on a truly classic fright flick that is bound to give you scares. But make sure you watch it in the dark for full effect. And if you think that watching a scary film like this is made better by seeing it with a crowd in a darkened theater AND if you are lucky enough, it is making the rounds to theaters across the country again for midnight screenings. For die hard fans (sorry if you read this after the date listed) make a point of going to Dixon, IL,  where Flashback is having another celebration of the film and star Bruce Campbell at the Midway Drive In on September 10th and 11th. Campbell will be there as they screen THEY CALL ME BRUCE, THE EVIL DEAD and its two sequels.  You can also find make up effects coordinator and artist Tom Sullivan on the convention circuit, especially Cinema Wasteland in Cleveland. Look for the website of both conventions online for details.",1283299200,8,7376,4.514606741573034
944762,5,6304953747,"A couple of months ago it was announced that Evil Dead was coming out on Blu-Ray. I confess that I was not very excited due to the fact that I had a copy of the HDTV broadcast of Evil Dead and didn't expect much of an improvement. Yet I decided to pick up a copy at my local DVD shop. With little excitement, I nonchalantly put the disc in my Blu-Ray player and sat back. Unlike some other Blu-Rays, this one had didn't have to take time loading and immediately went to previews of horror movies. I skipped through these and went to the menu. When the menu started playing, my spirits immediately were uplifted. The menu had the same music as the one in the Ultimate Edition over a nice collection of suspenseful moments in the film with a sepia filter over them. I decided to watch the full screen version.
The moment the movie started I was shocked. The once blurry and pink Renaissance logo and Evil Dead title were now sharp red. I was intrigued. As the movie proceeded, I was thoroughly amazed, this is and probably will always be THE BEST PICTURE QUALITY THAT EVIL DEAD WILL BE PRESENTED IN. I highly doubt that a film shot on 16mm can be up-converted beyond this; however, don't get me wrong, this isn't reference quality Blu-Ray, it's very far from it. There is plenty of grain that is inherent to 16mm film. Apparently Sam Raimi really did supervise this transfer well. It no longer suffers from the problems evidenced in the widescreen Anchor Bay releases and surpasses even the Elite DVD in sharpness. The color timing is spot on and is probably what was intended. For example, at the end, the sky is white rather than pinkish like in the Elite DVD. Additionally, reds do not bloom as in the Ultimate Edition transfer and HDTV broadcast. In case you are wondering, I did compare this with the aforementioned HDTV broadcast, and the difference is like night and day. It reminds me of the difference between the original Anchor Bay DVD release with the vastly superior Elite DVD. Finally, I am pleased to say that this transfer does not use HEAVY DNR (grain reducer) unlike the Evil Dead 2 transfer (which makes me hope that Anchor Bay will re-release Evil Dead 2 on Blu-Ray with a new transfer by Sam Raimi. The Dolby True HD sound mix was immersive and very impressive; although, I am disappointed that the mono mix was not included for purists' sakes.
After finishing the movie, I watched it again in widescreen with the commentary. The widescreen video is exactly the same as the full screen video quality, so I suspect Sam Raimi supervised both of them. The commentary was informative and had it's moments. Although I enjoyed it thoroughly, it is nowhere near as good as the Evil Dead 2 commentary, which is in my opinion the best commentary ever.
The Evil Dead is a horror masterpiece. Though lacking in acting, it makes Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street look like the comedies they really are. It showed that horror should have no boundaries through the very raw talent of Sam Raimi. This rawness resembles the similar rawness Stephen King (who incidentally endorsed this movie) used in his (in my opinion) best novel Carrie. It gets to our horror tolerance limits then breaks them. Bruce Campbell brings a certain charm and innocence to the role of Ash that makes his character the best male horror protagonist.
With that, I am glad to say that Evil Dead has finally gotten the release it deserves. Now, JOIN US!!!",1283212800,81,3441,4.605863192182411

944869,2,6304953747,"THE EVIL DEAD

(USA - 1982)

Aspect ratio: 1.37:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Whilst on vacation at an isolated backwoods cabin, five students are terrorized by ancient spirits which possess and kill them, one by one.

Clearly the work of talented filmmakers going places, this OTT gore-fest is alternately loud, excessive, stylish and disgusting, in roughly equal amounts. Debut director Sam Raimi throws everything into the mix, perhaps to atone for a flimsy plot and stock characters (well-played by an excellent cast, including cult-performer-in-the-making Bruce Campbell), and while much of it is tongue-in-cheek, some scenes leapfrog the taste barrier with unconscionable glee (Raimi has since admitted the 'tree rape' sequence was a mistake, for example).

Sadly, the movie is rendered monotonous by its excessive pace and comic insouciance (the sequels - beginning with EVIL DEAD II (1987) - went even further in this direction), and the movie quickly succumbs to the laws of diminishing returns; once you've seen one drooling demon getting its head cut off, you've seen 'em all!

If you have a weak stomach, you'll probably find yourself puking in the toilet halfway through the film. Good thing I don't have one (no offense). This is a gore-filled masterpiece. It really is. If you think Saw and House of 1000 Corpses (both of which are great horror films, by the way) are bloody and gory, wait until you see this one. Like the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Evil Dead is a prime example of how hands should be bitten off, and how bodies should be dismembered with an axe. And it's all done in such a low budget; it's unbelievable. I have to say that this is an excellent movie to watch on Halloween, and an excellent movie to watch any day or night. It's scary, funny, bloody, gory, intense . . . . and that's basically how it is.

944927,4,6304953747,"This review is primarily for the Book of the Dead packaging, but I will delve briefly into various presentations of the film.

I originally bought the Book of the Dead version when it was first released by Anchor Bay. The obvious luster of this packaging struck me with excitement as soon as I saw it. At the time I had the Elite version, which I immediately sold to fund the new purchase.

This packaging is awesome. The binding is latex and looks and feels great. The pages inside are thick and contain artwork inspired by the film, as well as a book of liner notes. The dvd itself is in a thin plastic sleve with a soft back for the data side.

Everyone who sees the book on my DVD shelf immediately picks it up and checks it out.

Having said all that, over the years the book is finally starting to show some degeneration. The binding along the top and the sides of the latex have started to tear. The face and back look great, though I'm concerned that the tears will destroy the entire cover.

Considering the book is 9 years old (2002 - 2009) it's had a good life, and should be great for at least a few more. I don't handle it frequently, it simply sits on the shelf with the other DVDs.

In regards to other editions, the newest ""Ultimate Edition"" is the best way to go. The packaging is beautiful, with the different covers that have been released previously as separate editions. The special features are great, and it includes the matted as well as the full frame editions.

Personally I have both the Book of the Dead, and the Ultimate editions. The Book of the Dead edition is just too cool to let go.

The film is a splatter classic that tells the simple story of a group of five college students who go to an old cabin in the woods and unleash an ancient evil which kills and takes them over,leaving only one survivor...and than something happens....

Raimi brings so much exuberance to the production with a constantly mobile camera,some wild concepts and bizarre special effects that it would be difficult for it not to have become an instant cult hit. The film's gore was so extreme that it featured the most buckets of blood in a film for over a decade until Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive""(1990).

In recent years the film has taken on a larger following,which seems more inspired by it's comic third film,""Army of Darkness"",and the original has become overrated.
What keeps the film from being a TRUE genre classic is the fact that the acting and characters are pretty amateurish and the film dosen't exactly have the best plot and will be remade more effectively by Raimi in 1987 as ""Evil Dead 2:Dead by Dawn"".

Still,this is a must see Horror film for fans of the genre and a Grindhouse must have.

This DVD edition features loads of features including two audio commentaries with Director and Producer,Sam Raimia nd Rod Tapert and one with star and B-Movie legend,Bruce Campbell. There are also still galleries,behind the scenes footage and trailers.

944991,1,6304953747,"Major disclaimer: I dislike horror as a genre pretty much from top to bottom. I am a major movie buff. I've seen quite literally thousands of films, have run film societies, and own a staggering pile of DVDs. But I don't like horror. I love nearly every other genre, from film noir to Astaire/Rogers musicals to screwball comedies to Italian Westerns to every imaginable form of Sci-fi, but I simply detest Horror. Doesn't matter who makes them, films by people like Wes Craven, Sam Raimi, and Eli Roth, not to mention lesser lights, just bore me to tears.

THE EVIL DEAD was not only as boring to me as other horror films, the sheer amateurish quality (albeit gifted amateurs) added an additional layer of torture. There was simply nothing in this film -- not a single second -- that I found in any way, shape, form, or manner to be even remotely entertaining.

OK, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the way I'm wired I'm constitutionally incapable of ""getting"" whatever there is to get in a horror movie. So, in a way, this review might end up saying more about me than the movie. Or perhaps it says more about most people who watch and enjoy this than it does about me. When I watch this, absolutely nothing steps forward to refute my conviction that this is complete and utter crap.

I will add that Bruce Campbell's commentary is great. I actually watched this and the two sequels to the film because I was reading Campbell's account of his career as an actor, IF CHINS COULD KILL: CONFESSIONS OF A B ACTOR. I love the book; hate the EVIL DEAD movies. Obviously the two subsequent films engage in a great deal of self-parody. I found both his account of making the film in the book and his commentary on making the film on the DVD to be infinitely more entertaining than the film itself.

In short, if you, unlike me, like horror films, especially no-budget horror film, you might like this. In fact, you will apparently love it, like most of the reviewers here. But if you don't like horror, you will, like me, probably view this movie as a different kind of horror film, in which the horror consists of your having to watch it. I'd rather watch a mime troupe than ever watch this again.",1230163200,3,2196,4.537878787878788

944994,4,6304953747,"""The Evil Dead"" is an innovative, ground-breaking horror classic that has developed a cult following.  Director Sam Raimi (""Darkman"" and ""Spiderman"") was highly influenced by other well established horror megahits such as ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" and ""Night of the Living Dead.""  A young Bruce Campbell (""Maniac Cop,"" ""The Woods,"" and ""Bubba Ho-Tep"") is college student Ash; him and his friends rent a secluded cabin in the mountains.  (""The Evil Dead"" was filmed mostly in the backwoods of Morristown, near my home of Knoxville, Tennessee.)  Demonic forces inhabit these woods.  After discovering the Book of the Dead, the friends begin turning into demon possessed zombies.  There is levitation and green vomit spewing as in the ""Exorcist.""  They have learned that only bodily dismemberment can destroy a demon.  Numerous sharp farm implements hang from the cabin's ceiling.  Ash uses a chainsaw to slice up one of his friends.  Hence, the similarity to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""

  Fans of Lucio Fulci (""Zombie,"" ""The House by the Cemetery, and ""The Beyond"") will enjoy ""The Evil Dead.""  It has a tremendous amount of disgusting gore.  Some of it is too over the top for my taste.  It is this excessive gore that kept it from gaining the popularity that was achieved by ""Halloween"" - another low-budget horror classic.  Also, there is too much dark humor for me.  Some dialogue came across as silly.  However, it helped ease the tension created by some of the graphic scenes of demonic violence.  Furthermore, the acting and directing was amateurish, almost to the point that it lent the film a homemade feel.

  ""Evil Dead"" is highly recommended for fans of zombie films, especially those which involve demons such as Lamberto Bava's ""Demons"" and ""Demons 2.""  The DVD from Anchor Bay is excellent.  It has interesting features that include outtakes and deleted scenes and great commentary from star Bruce Campbell.  It is very educational to learn how this movie was finally released after five years of production and at a miniscule cost of $375,000.

Note of Interest:  As stated earlier, Lamberto Bava's film ""Demons"" is similar to ""The Evil Dead.""  His father, Mario Bava, was considered the Italian Maestro of the Macabre.  In his film ""Baron Blood,"" the hideous baron is released from his tomb when a parchment was read.  This scene is similar to the one in ""The Evil Dead"" when the five friends listen to the tape recording of a professor reading from the Book of the Dead, which resulted in the demons being released from the ground outside the cabin.",1226448000,,2590,5.009389671361502
944995,4,6304953747,"As far as teenage horror movies go this is pretty decent stuff. It is easy to see the tongue in cheek humor as well. I can see why it is a cult favorite. Part of a trilogy I think they got better as actor Bruce Campbell and Director Sam Raimi felt comfortable with this theme and took it further and further. By the time they got to ""Army of Darkness"" it became mostly comedy with some horror. AOD is my favorite of the three because of the outrageous bits and great special effects. This is a great collection for fans of horror/comedy movies. If you enjoyed this catch ""Scary Movie"".

945056,5,6304953747,"But we fans of ""Evil Dead"" certainly don't care.  It's not his singing skills we're interested in.  What we want to know is this; can the man still decapitate with the swing of a shovel?  Well, of course he can!  As long as you own this or ""Evil Dead II"" you'll get to watch him do it over and over as often as you want.  For me, this is the scene that defines what ""Evil Dead"" is all about in a nutshell:
-Creative camera work.
-Spirited if not talented actors.
-Audacious, imaginative gore.
-Spook-house fun.
With one swing of a shovel, Ashley (Ash/Bruce Campbell) defines the mood of this film.  But maybe I should start at the beginning and slice this film up into little pieces.  Only then will I truly bring honor to Sam Raimi's seminal film of the horror genre.

-5 WHEELS HEAD FOR THE RICKETY OLD CABIN.
This film moves at a blindingly fast pace.  If you ever get bored watching ""Evil Dead"" regardless of what you think of it, then I don't want to be you.  About 3 minutes into the film, we get POV (point of view) shots through the woods watching our 2 couples, Ash and Linda (Bruce and Betsy Baker), Scott and Shelly (Richard DeManincor and Theresa Tilly) along with Ash's sister, Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss); the fifth wheel I eluded to, driving up to the isolated and run down cabin.  It doesn't take long for all hell to break loose after a recording found in the cellar is played with magic words in it.  The words in German are: ""Sam and Rob, Das ist Hikers Dan dee Roadsa"" translated to mean ""Sam and Rob are the Hikers on the road"".  Of course, this references Raimi and executive producer Robert Tapert who were portraying local yokels on the road leading to the cabin.  Regardless of Raimi's goofy devices, fifth wheels are usually where all the trouble begins and those magic words aren't ones to ignore the rules.  This thinnest of plots becomes one of the great scaffolds of horror ever put to film.

-WHEN SETTING THE STANDARD IS NO STANDARD AT ALL.
If there was a gorier, sloppier more audaciously violent film prior to ""Evil Dead"" I want to know what it is (because I want it!).  I believe this film set the standards for eliminating standards in a horror movie.  Even by today's ""standards"", ""Evil Dead"" can still hold its own for balls-out gore and grossness while still being a load of fun.  Though the demonic makeup is a bit goofy by today's measurements, I still admire the vision of the work.  At the very worst you see seams, wrinkles and flaws.  At the very best, it is still very creepy and grotesque.  The only standard this film didn't stretch was in the nudity department (as there really isn't any).  However, when getting raped by a tree is ok, well... ...enough said.

-SCARY?  OH YEA!
As horror films age, they tend to lose their visceral impact.  Even horror classics fail to scare people most of the time with few exceptions.  After nearly 30 years this film still holds up very well to its modern rivals.  Though more over-the-top than anything that preceded, ""Evil Dead"" could still disturb the uninitiated.  For me, few things are scarier than demonic possession.  A demon is invisible, moves indiscriminately, is deceptive by nature and is in a hurry to get your soul.  So, anyway it can get you dead is fair game.  This movie plays on all those angles to the hilt.  The big surprise with ""Evil Dead"" was the physical state possession left people in.  This took ""The Exorcist"" to a different level.  The funny and great thing is most of the actors are better at being possessed than human.  Of course, Raimi's POV camera shots might be the scariest innovation employed in this film.  Regardless, it all adds up to a nearly timeless horror experience.

-HI I'M BRUCE CAMPBELL.  YOU MIGHT REMEMBER ME FROM ""DOG SOLDIERS"".
Yea, I'm kidding.  That was a characters name in ""Dog Soldiers""; clearly a case of a director paying his respects to a horror icon.  Needless to say, Bruce is the undisputed king of camp and B-movie horror.  He's even had his ""A-movie"" cameos (Spider Man films etc.).  But this is where it all started for him.  In retrospect, he was an awful actor in ""Evil Dead"", yet he brought a sense of slapstick to horror that was both fun and refreshing.  He'll never win an Oscar (for what it's worth) but he has had a long and storied career since his initial portrayal of Ash.  Amazingly, the other actors in ""Evil Dead"" may have actually done a better job than Bruce, but they lacked his persona.  They have all become legendary for this film but have never translated that into successful film careers for a bunch of different reasons.  To learn more about this, particularly the women, a little book is included with this version of ""Evil Dead"" titled ""The Ladies of the Evil Dead"".  Boy, that's clever marketing,

-WHICH VERSION IS THE BEST?
I have no freaking clue!  The ""Evil Dead"" series may be the most reproduced and exploited horror series ever.  If you can find a series of titles more reproduced in more varied levels of quality (excluding Star Wars), then I'd like to know what it is.  Given this, I don't know if one version is more complete than another.  I have the one with the green outlined letters with Bruce Campbell's kisser poking through and the girl reaching up.  This version has the little book in it.  It's good enough for me.

-PUTTING MY SOUL ON THE LINE
As low as the budget is, as clunky as the acting gets, as thin as the plot is, ""Evil Dead"" is a landmark horror movie.  Horror films that came before could be viewed as sluggish.  Much of what came after could be viewed as derivative.  Regardless of these iconic traits, ""Evil Dead"" is just flat out entertaining.  Who cares where it came from or where it's going.  Forget my fan-boy rambling and just sit down on Halloween night and watch ""Evil Dead"", ""Evil Dead II"", and ""Army of Darkness"".  If you enjoy audacious, in-your-face, balls-out horror done on the cheap, then this will do it for you.

Throw in some dark scenery, evil trees, buried demons and a book made of human flesh called the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis and you know that something gory is about to happen. The five innocent University students who are planned a relaxing retreat in Tennessee have no idea what they are in for as they are about to uncover the deadly dark secrets that have been haunting the area for ages. Even undisturbed the morbid forces make the cabin feel like an unpleasant and disgusting place but once the door to the cellar blasts open on it's own, the students feel intrigued to explore - big mistake!

The overall feeling of the movie is of pure dread from the very beginning. The woods are not lush and green but brown, savage and eerie, something you would not want to see through a window of any cabin. Once our friends settle in strange noises start, which is the beginning of the end. If you like zombie-like ghoulish creatures that must have been dreamt up while in delirious tempest of a fever then this movie will not disappoint, it has all that and more. This movie is not suave and thrilling; it goes through body part chopping, screaming, running, stabbing, throwing up of blood and other questionable fluids of all colors, demonic possessions and false sense of security. It's a crazy movie and its little old, well not that old, but its more old school while these days CG monsters plague the blue screen, in Evil Dead some serious plastic puppets were taking center stage in this film and that made me like the movie a whole lot more. In parts it reminded me of ""The Thing"" because these were some really creepy and gross transformations, so fans of that fantastic movie should get a kick out of this.

This is part one of three, and after seeing part two this weekend I bet I know what to expect for the finale, more of the same gooey goodness.

945063,5,6304953747,"The Evil Dead(or Book of the Dead, as it was originally called) is a 1981 horror film that was written and directed by Sam Raimi. He's famous for movies such as Darkman, The Quick and The Dead, and Spider-Man. Although this isn't his first film, it is his most widely 'acclaimed' film. The film stars Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss and Betsy Baker. It was made on a budget of $375,000.  It tells the story of five college students who take a vacation in the woods at a cabin which quickly turns into horror when they find an audiotape that is a key to unlocking evil spirits. The film was extremely controversial, in its' day, for its' graphic violence and gore. It is accepted as a classic in the genre these days and has a cult following worldwide.

Originally, when I first saw the movie years ago, I didn't like it so much. It was quite different than horror movies of the day back then because of its' excessive use of violence and gore as well as its' dark humor. It wasn't til recently when I purchased the movie that I seen it for what it was truly worth. It's absolutely brilliant. A classic, for sure.

Low on both plot and character, the film instead offers an enormous number of scares and thrills, and exhibits a precocious (and highly effective) use of camera placement, make-up effects, and editing and story rhythms--this is one of the best-paced horror films ever made. Raimi makes reference to almost every film you can think of that preceded it, from the expected (CARRIE, HALLOWEEN, SUSPIRIA) to the surprising (THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, with the shot of the tendril creeping up Cheryl's dress, and THE WIZARD OF OZ, with Cheryl's zombie mocking Ash just like the Wicked Witch of the West mocks Dorothy). The tone is mostly straightfaced, with little indication of how tongue-in-cheek the series would later become, though there are some indications in the demons' impossibly but enjoyably arch dialogue. The film won no prizes for progressive gender politics: the hero, Ash (the strongjawed and likeable Bruce Campbell) basically learns how to be a man by ceasing to protect the possessed female characters and instead beating them literally to bits.

My review is not about the movie. There are plenty of those already. This is a review on the latest release called The Ultimate Edition. With this edition, you get three DVDs chock full of movies and special features that should whet the appetite of any possessing demon that should come your way.

DVD 1:
This DVD contains the widescreen version of the movie in Dolby Surround 2.0, Digital EX and 6.1 DTS-ES. It contains audio commentary from Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert. Also included is a 50+ minute documentary called ""One By One We Will Take You: The Untold Saga of THE EVIL DEAD"". This new special from Anchor Bay interviews the cast and crew of the movie and goes into such in-depth detail of how this movie was made. Do you think you know everything that happened? You may and you may not, but you'll definitely learn more with interviews with Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Betsy Baker and Theresa Tilly and others from behind the scenes. The picture itself of the movie is as pristine as you can get it to be.

DVD 2:
This contains the full screen version in Dolby 2.0 and contains the commentary from Bruce Campbell. Again, wonderful, pristine picture and it also contains a 59 minute feature of deleted scenes and outtakes entitled ""THE EVIL DEAD: Treasures From The Cutting Room Floor"". There is no commentary with it, but still, it's a wonderful introspective into the making of this film.

DVD 3:
Wow. What can be said. This is just chock full of Evil Dead treasures that should keep you possessed. You have numerous features concerning the ""Ladies of the Evil Dead"". There are plenty of videos from conferences with the cast and crew, including a reunion panel, make-up test, trailers, TV spots, still gallery and more. Also included is a two-side poster containing the original ""touched up"" Evil Dead poster and on the other side is the original photograph before it was touched up. There is also an Easter Egg on the 3rd DVD that has a panel discussion after the movie was released in 2001 by Anchor Bay to a capacity crowd at the American Cinematheque in Hollywood.

my only complaint, and the reason this edition gets 4 stars instead of 5, is that i can't give away my previous 'collectors edition' anchor bay dvd of 'evil dead' because they put bruce campbell's commentary on a separate disc from the one with sam raimi and rob tapert. if anything happens to one of these two discs you still have the movie but you'd be missing one very important commentary track.",1199750400,2,1894,4.587020648967552

An all time horror classic from the 80's! Sam Raimi  made his directorial debut with this low budget horror splatter-thon that was made on a shoestring budget and became a selected feature at the Cannes film festival of 1981. Then it came out in theaters in the fall of 1982 with some critical acclaim and a strong cult following since it first released into theaters. Bruce Campbell became a cult hero after this movie thanks to playing the lovable lunkheaded hero Ash whom also became a horror icon as well, the movie spawned two classic sequels, one upcoming remake and merchandise nowadays.

In low-budget gems like this, you can really appreciate how simple things such as camera angles, props, and other plot devices add to the mood and the story.

How many different editions of this film and countless others will Anchor Bay release before the fans revolt and turn their backs on these films and the company itself???
  But this edition does come close to it being the Ultimate Edition. The only reason why it's not the ""ultimate edition"" is simply do to the lack of two things, not including ""Within The Woods"" and a new commentary with ""the ladies of evil dead"" Ellen Sandweiss (Cheryl), Betsy Baker (Linda), & Theresa Tilly (Shelly), and of course Richard DeManincor (Scotty). If these two things would have been included, I don't think anyone would have complained at all.
  We all know that ""Within The Woods"" will probably never have an official release do to the fact that it contains products used in the film and the companies either refuse to allow their products to be used in a horror movie or have asked for too much money. I honestly don't know why a new commentary wasn't recorded.
  This release does contain some new footage never seen before at all!!! That's pretty cool to have if you're the hardcore fan. And the fact that the film was released in it's original Fullframe version (the movie was filmed in Fullframe) and the cropped Widescreen version.

So if you've thought about getting this film, ignore the other releases and get this version. It's close to being the true ""definitive edition""!!!

Year Made: 1981

The Package: 5 Stars. This review is for The Evil Dead Ultimate Edition released in 2007 from Anchor Bay. I received this in the mail and opened the box it was shipped in. I took out the box and after waiting and waiting since I had this on pre order back in November. WOW, What I now was holding in my hands was the ultimate edition of one of my all time favorite horror films ever! I opened it up slowly and was so happy with what I was feasting my eyes on.  The box is very well made and the box graphics are so sweet! Inside you will find 3 discs.  Each one has some superb graphics on the discs themselves.  They are easy to pop out from the holder, and when put back in they hold in place very well.  You also get a poster inside that you can hang on your wall, OR if your a purist like myself, you can just leave it in the box to stay nice and in original condition as well.  On one disc you get a widescreen version of the film.  On the second disc you can watch the full frame version.  On the third disc there is lots of sweet extras that is sure to please any Evil Dead fan!

Spook Meter:  5 Stars.  This film is creepy! The way it was shot, the forest, the cabin, the lighting, the sounds of the demons! It's freaky and just amazing. This is a absolute classic horror film that never fails to make my mouth drop open in awe every time I watch this!  Ladies, I think you all rock, but Lynda is my favorite demon.  That laugh of hers is just freaky as hell. LOL.  All and all I would say there is a handful of horror films that you watch and they are not only scary but you watch them and afterwards you think.  It just could not have been better made then this. The Evil Dead IS one of those films. Yes, it is really that exciting to watch.

Gore/Violence Meter: 5 Stars. There is tons of flying blood/goo and all sorts of parts. If you love gore, you will love this.  The very first time I watched this, I was in total aww at that one body could hold that much blood. The gore really works well here.  Some films, less gore is better, in this case I loved to see the blood fly and it does. Even though there is tons of gore here, this is a fun film to watch and it won't leave you walking away feeling emotionally drained like some other horror films can do.  Not saying that's a bad thing from other films, but what I'm saying is, there is tons of gore here but it's truly fun to watch and not in a intense depressive way at all.

Profanity Meter:  3 Strikes. There is some language here and there.  Gods name is used which I never like to hear in any film.  Other then that, there is not a lot of swearing.

Sexual Meter:  2 Strikes. Nothing really sexual as far as nude scenes in this.  However, I must point out that there is a ""famous"" scene where a woman is suggestively  sexually assaulted by tree branches in the woods that come to life.  Nothing to graphic is actually shown, but you do have a clear idea what happened.  I point this out to any new viewer to this film just to let you know what may or may not offend you.

Final Thoughts: I first wanted to give a review of this gem of a horror film just in case someone new stumbled across The Evil Dead (Ultimate Edition) and never seen this film at all before.  With  that said, I just want to say that I'm happy that Anchor Bay has come out with this edition.  I know not everyone is happy with this film being Re-released time and time again.  I am happy though as to me this is not only one of the greatest horror films in history but also a film that I just love to collect on period. If they keep releasing these, I will keep buying.

Thank you for reading and have a Merry Christmas! 2007",1198454400,6,3710,4.041152263374485
945119,5,6304953747,"Three stars because it is the infinite greed, money grabbing version release of The Evil Dead.  The Evil Dead I give ten stars hands down. I give ten stars for Joe Loduca's music score. ""Yeah I know"", the 100th Evil dead DVD edition. I agree with most of the Evil Dead fans, I'm tired of it. The only bright things about this umpteenth edition: I like having the Widescreen and Standard format each on a single disc. The third DVD is all I believe unseen extras on The Evil Dead creators and actors and actresses. Annoyed with Sam Raimi and Anchor Bays greed to cash in on an already done project is aggravating to me. I will admit, the extras on all three DVDs is excellent stuff, I have never seen before, is really interesting and again caught my interest in this gore masterpiece for the infinite time. I admit I seen this new version in the store and on impulse had to get it, after watching the extras I'm glad I did. If you have the the other Evil Dead releases, you won't need this latest one. The extras though, are not only great for an Evil Dead fan, but any fan of this genre of film should have. Check out the photos I have put up, this will give you a better idea of the packaging of this umpteenth release of this fabled film. Anchor Bay has done an incredible job with this release, packaging is phenomenal. One thing that gets most overlooked with this film is Joe Loduca's amazing music score. Evil Dead would never be as good without Loduca's incredible music score. Evil Dead continues to fascinate its fans and of course newer generations of fans.

945120,2,6304953747,"About two years ago here in Chicago at the Flashback horror con they had a Evil dead reunion. Most of the activities were filmed for another dvd release of the film that has just now come out. For some time ive enjoyed the joke of how many versions of the Evil Dead films Anchor Bay has put out .So i was originally going to hold out and buy this one used like many of the other versions. On my bookshelf i have all but two of the many versions of the three films sitting side by side. But i heard the panels from that convention would be on there and that was exciting for me. See my friend is a big Evil Dead fan like so many people out there are,and as we sat in on the reunion panel he really wanted to ask a question to Bruce .I suggested asking why there are so many editions of the film. When he got the chance to ask the question Bruce had Tom the president of Anchor bay come out and give his opinion. Being that this was two years ago all i remember was Tom being a bit put off as if he had never heard this gripe and went off on my friend as if he was being a jerk for asking the question. He claimed that it wouldnt be fair to hold off on versions of the dvd every time something new was made or found ,that he was doing a service to the fans putting a new edition out every year.
  Back to the new dvd,once i saw that this panel would be on the dvd i was excited that my friend would be on there asking a question i know so many people wonder. I watched the whole panel on the dvd and of course the only question that was taken out was my friends. I think it would have been far cooler if Anchor Bay had left my friends question on there instead of censoring it.
  The best thing i can say about this edition is the packaging is beyond nice looking. The three discs are housed with most of the art that has been used for all the earlier dvd releases.",1197936000,3,1863,3.93368700265252
945121,3,6304953747,"First off, anyone who loves this film knows, that the now out of print, ""Elite"" edition, has the best over all picture quality (just compare the scene where Ash gives Linda the necklace, between the two versions, and you'll see that the Anchor Bay version is soft, almost to the point of being out of focus, where as the Elite version is much sharper) and it seems that no matter how many times Anchor Bay, ""Remasters"" their print of, The Evil Dead, they just can't seem to make it look any better.

So what we have in this new, ""Ultimate"" edition, is the same old tired transfer of the film, this time in both wide and full screen formats (of which the major consensus is that the full screen version is the director's preferred aspect ratio, which is made even more evident during the commentaries for Anchor Bay's previous, ""Evil Dead"" edition (the one cropped to widescreen, but with both commentaries on the same disc) during the scenes where things in the picture are referred to, even though the widescreen matting on the top and bottom has covered them up, case in point, white rocks placed at the bottom of the cabin's front porch, which one of the commentaries refer to as looking like teeth, making the cabin look like a skull, are cropped out, in order to get the full shot of the large moon in the top of the frame (we where obviously meant to see both).

And as for the, ""New"" material, it consists mainly of a 59 minute retrospective, with no Bruce or Raimi participation (although Rob Tapert and the, ""Ladies of the Evil Dead"", along With the, Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz director and the Cabin Fever, Hostel director, to name a few, pipe in through out) which doesn't really tell you any more info then you already know, and also a couple of, ""Ladies of the Evil Dead"" talk sessions, which although interesting, aren't really all that worthy of an upgrade.

Of Note: one of the, ""Ladies of the Evil Dead"" mentions at some point, having been at a commentary session with the other two girls, and since this commentary doesn't appear on this, ""Ultimate Edition"", DVD set, then it can only lead one to believe that another edition is in the works (probably, ""The Ladies of the Evil Dead"", Edition).

There's also a, ""From the Cutting Room Floor"" feature, which is really just a cleaned up version of the deleted /alternate scenes, which already appear in both the last Anchor Bay and Elite editions.

So, unless you can't get your hands on the, Elite DVD, to get the full screen version, want to see the, ""Soccer Moms of the Evil Dead"", are a completest (my particular affliction... lol) or just want to fork over more hard earned cash to the people at Anchor Bay, then this edition can be skipped, and you can begin to save up for the next edition.

Hope this helps :)",1197849600,33,2783,4.52286282306163
945122,5,6304953747,"If you're buying this DVD, its obviously for the extras. That being said, this is something I will be picking up because of my love for the series makes me want to dig deeper whenever possible to get more information about this little indie film that could.",1197763200,3,257,4.48936170212766
945150,2,6304953747,"I like this movie as much as any fan, but come on--how many times are we going to have to buy this before we have the absolute final edition? I don't believe that there is anything included here that couldn't have been put with any of the previous ones. And so I'm afraid I'm going to have to side with those of a cynical perspective (I don't like to be cynical...) and give this movie two stars. Great movie, but it's the same in all editions! The film itself is the core of the product, so why do I have to spend over $30 to buy it ONCE AGAIN? I realize that it's unreasonable to expect them to accomodate those of us who have bought it several times, but we are the true fans and I feel some sort of loyalty is due in our favor. I also realize that, of course, this is good business on the part of the studio... but in the long run one could spend several hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands... buying multiple editions of many 'collectible' movies over time. How can I justify buying the same movie in the same medium (I understand converting from vhs to dvd of course) when that money could be spent on a different film or some invaluable outdoor activity, or... crazy notion... giving the money to charity? $30 can feed a whole family for more than a month in some countries. Just a thought.

On an added (somewhat unrelated) note--I don't like to include references to other reviews in my own (waste of time and wholly irrelevant) but why do some people attack the negative reviews of others? We are all entitled to our personal opinions of a product as a whole, and we ought review it as such. I like this movie alot, but based on my reasons given above I would rate this edition two stars. As a slightly more diplomatic reviewer, I might give the product AS A WHOLE, four stars, for those who haven't yet 'taken the plunge'. The reasoning behind four stars and not five is that even with all the extras, close to $30 dollars is still overly expensive (collector's items?! These aren't Picassos and Stradivari we're talking about here... they're plastic and cardboard!)

Now, if you don't like my review--too bad. Deal with it. But if you don't find it HELPFUL, then you can click ""no"" towards the end. Alternatively, you can click ""yes"". It's easy when you know how, eh?",1197763200,3,2282,4.430952380952381

The only people that dig it are guys that just get off on tons of gore, but it's not even quality gore. It's some college students making a horror movie on a shoestring, using stuff from their kitchen.

The first half of the film is quite atmospheric and frightening, but then it just gets silly. I prefer the ""sequel"" or remake, ""Evil Dead II"".  It has a bigger budget and the same great(actually better) directing from Raimi, but also a sense of humor and much better set pieces.  The only humor in ""Evil Dead"" is of the unintentional variety.  Which is OK I guess, if you are watching it to laugh at.

This film is different from the two sequels in a couple of ways, one being that Ash is more of the cowardly co-star and second being that this is strictly horror. Not that it is really scary, but it's intention are in that genre with no real laughs intended. Everytime I watch the movie, I am amazed with how much was able to get done with such a low amount of money to spend and how well the movie comes off. It is just as good as any major film of the same year, you can't really tell the difference between a big budget horror movie and the Evil Dead when it comes to quality.

It is easy to tell that there was talent that was working in front of and behind the camera. Not just Bruce (who would be the only star with any future success in film), but everyone else was equally impressive. The way the entire movie was written, set up and shot is nothing short of amazing for a young director and writer (Sam Raimi). Overall, if you have seen any of the other movies in the series or never have, this movie is a big recommendation. Just know that this is different from the other movies, as I said, Ash isn't the heroic icon he is known for now with the quick one liners.

945304,5,6304953747,"It's the early 80's, what do you expect? This is a scary scary film. And I think I know why films now a days can't hold a candle to films like Halloween and Evil Dead. And that is because a photo copy is never as good as the original. That is the bottom line. Directors don't care about a lot of the material that they are filming today, especially when it comes to horror films and that is because they don't write their own stories. They do someone elses work. But not Evil Dead. This was Raimi's baby from the outset. When films like the two mentioned were filmed they were filmed by two directors that were complete unknowns. They had no pressure to make a great film and they did it on an incredibly low budget. Halloween was made for $150,000 and Evil Dead for $50 000. So what that meant is that the directors could stick to their visions but they had to find innovative ways to do so. Their budgets didn't allow a heap of special effects so they had to rely on what they knew. And that was, how to create atmosphere using the camera. And Evil Dead is one of the best at doing that. There is one scene in this film that I will never forget and that is one of the early scenes where the cast arrives at the cabin. Here we see a long shot of the cabin and it has very eerie music playing. This shows the cabin as being menacing. It lets you know that there is evil in that cabin. And that we are in for a hell of a ride.

Sam Raimi made a masterpiece here that I believe stands the test of time. You can put this film up against any of today's so called horror films and I guarantee you this scares you more. Raimi cares about his movie and he does everything to make you feel the terror that the cabin people feel. We are scared and disgusted at what happens when one of the women goes outside alone at night and meets a tree that does unspeakable things. And when the book is first introduced.... that is horror movie history there. What a brilliant concept. A book that is evil. I have often wondered about such books. We hear about them all the time in movies about ancient Egypt and ancient times. But here we have a book that has weird incantations from another world and another language, and you just know that as soon as some idiot utters the words that they are not supposed to say, well they won't be around much longer.

The Evil Dead is a miracle. It was made on a rock bottom budget yet it is scarier than any Hollywood movie that is made for 20 million could ever hope to be. If you want to truly experience a frightening experience, rent this film, it knows what it wants to say. And it knows how to make you afraid. So be afraid. Be very afraid.

945308,5,6304953747,"Even though it seems cheesy, even laughable today, there's no denying ""The Evil Dead"" is still a landmark moment in the horror genre. Made for virtually no budget by a group of struggling young filmmakers straight out of college, ""The Evil Dead"" became one of the most original films in the horror genre as well as films in general, and is still vastly entertaining today.

Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) and his friends have gone upstate to rent a cabin in the woods. Everything seems well at first until they find the so called Book Of The Dead, which is supposed to unleash unspeakable evil. That unspeakable evil is manages to one by one, turn each cabin dweller into mindless, bloodthirsty zombies, until Ash is the only one left standing.

The plot is pretty much that, but it's still a thrill to watch. The death scenes are both hilarious and creative, and the performances are great, especially Campbell, who became a cult icon thanks to his performance as Ash.

This new special edition comes with a wealth of special features, including audio commentary from the stars and the crew (including director Sam Raimi), and crystal clear sound and picture quality.

945385,5,6304953747,"The Independent Film Channel has been showing a few classic horror films here lately. A week or two ago, it was the first and third ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" films, and now this 1983 classic from Sam Raimi. I hope the second film is on the way!. This was my first real viewing of the film that I remember. I saw it in bits and pieces some years back, dug it, but didn't remember much of the film as a whole. Boy, I've been missing out!. The movie is unabashedly filled with splattering guts and grue, and any horror fan will relish in the film's over the top gore. Is this the same guy that did ""Spider-Man""?. The always great Bruce Campbell heads up the small cast as Ash(Ashley), who goes along on a little outing in the woods with three other friends. Only one gets out alive. They come to a creepy old cabin, and things pretty much go downhill from there. They find odd things including a book made of human skin and a recording from a previous tenant. Before you know it, our little group has resurrected an ancient evil, and they won't be getting out alive. Soon, the demonic forces start to take over the gang, until Ash can put a bloody and gory stop to it. Raimi sets the right tone and delivers his chills and thrills in a nice, organic fashion. Looking back on these older films, one appreciates them more when comparing them to modern ones with fancy effects and CGI. Raimi doesn't skimp on the awesomeness of the idea, and let's it all rip in bloody good fun. The only thing that was skimpy in the film were the characters. With the exception of Ash, The three other friends were mainly decoration to be taken down in the most awful of ways. The setting itself was wonderful, and brilliantly shot by Raimi. Let's face it, the woods are scary. The woods at night are downright terrifying. Raimi uses wonderful skill to make the most of the wooded areas and making them not only sinister, but making them feel as if they were really alive. Some of the make-up and gore effects get chintzy here and there, but most of the time they are a gorehounds delight. What can you expect here?. Impalements, dismemberment, chainsaws, shovels, and so on. It remains to be seen if Raimi will ever return to his low budget horror film ways. It would be too bad if he didn't because he was one of the masters.",1154736000,2,2305,4.400468384074942

Firstly the Latex..squishy covers: The ""Book of the dead"" from the first movie is a great piece. Screen used(or very similar) pages and a great insert booklet. The special features are all great too. The Second ""Book of the Dead"" was definitly not worth it as far as being a prop replica, unless you are a hardcore fan. The interior although by MR. Sullivan himself is not authentic as far as screen used images. It looks like he just had some spare time @ some fun. It's only saving grace is the eye that screams when you press it. Which soon wears thin. LOL

Now to the DVD's themselves: The DVD's for both movies are exceptional and are crisp and clear like never B4. Loaded with special features. I guess I am glad I purchased both in this pack as I am a completest when it comes to my DVD collection LOL

945472,5,6304953747,"Horror movies today usually involve a big-breasted woman walking into the woods/a dark room/ another poorly-lit place and yelling ""Hello?"" and the name of the person they're looking for. The Evil Dead is no exception (well, Ellen Sandweiss isn't exactly big-breasted...), but the fact that walking into the woods and yelling loudly results in rape by tree is one of the many tricks up director Sam Raimi's sleeve.

Most people say, ""Oh, that movie with that guy with a chainsaw for a hand!"" when Evil Dead is mentioned (real fans know Ash got the chainsaw hand in Evil Dead 2). Those people don't know what they're missing. The Evil Dead is a wild, insane goreride that launched Bruce Campbell to King of the B-Movies (and chins) and Sam Raimi to films like Spider-Man and its sequel (perhaps you've heard of them?). Not only is it scary, but it was made from a low budget, spawned one of the coolest franchises around, gave birth to the Coen brothers (well, they weren't actually born on set...) and their fame, and basically made the horror movie fresh again, even with well-known cliches.

Lost? Fine, the basic plot: five college kids- Ash, his girlfriend Linda, sister Cheryl, best buddy Scott, and Scott's girlfriend Shelly head up to a remote mountain cabin in the woods and promptly find a strange book and tape recorder that has a professor named Knowby reciting passages from it. This raises evil spirits that possess them all until Ash is left to fend off the...wait for it...EVIL DEAD by himself. You getting chills yet?

However, tend to agree that there are far too many versions of these movies coming out, without anything new to say. The new ED2 doesn't really add anything except a nice box, and it is a nice one but nothing new! And now to have it repackaged with an ED Book of The Dead seems a little like just going for the cash dudes! Especially as this is now a different version of the ED Book Of The Dead cause by the look of the image, its the same size as the new ED2 and thats smaller than my original ED Book of The Dead. Its nice packaging so I kinda feel if I don't buy it somebody else will buy it for me! Sad, I know but I want it!

In terms of the AOD version, as far as I'm aware - Anchor Bay are already talking to Tom Sullivan about designing one so yep, we'll have another version of that with another boxed set, yadda yadda yadda. Its a money making machine...

And just to stick my oar into the previous reviews, ED was shot on 35mm which means the full size TV version actually shows more than the widescreen version. I'm a widescreen champion normally but the original ED is better than this new widescreen version, there's a lot of nice touches missing because of the top and bottom of the screen being blacked out (eg the elastiplast box floating in the blood towards the end).

And don't think that this will make a great deal of difference with whether we get an ED4 or not...

It almost seemed like a lot of the make up could have just been made from stuff they found in the kitchen. In one scene someone's leg got clawed and their skin tore like it had the consistency of wet cardboard. I think weird experimental art-gore scenes like that were what the point of the movie was. The movie alternates between lulls where you're like ""god this movie is so boring, why isn't there any plot, why do they expect me to even care about what's going to happen next"", and the visual action sequences. I get that they needed something the break up the action sequences, but it felt like what they were using was most often just empty space, like they could have had an actual story develop between the art-horror scenes, but they just didn't bother.

Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"" is an amazing start off to a trilogy of horror and three stooges slapstick. I have never seen a horror movie so many times, heck I've never seen any movie so many times. Sure the special effects are discouraging but who could of better been cast as the reluctant hero than Bruce Campbell? It has cheaply thrown in nudity and unusual amounts of blood which give it that early 80's horror film feeling. It's easy to pick out flaws and inconsistencies throughout the films, but thats not the point. The point is to make you laugh, and then scare your pants off.

Evil Dead II -
The first Evil Dead film was pure horror. The third is pure comedy. Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead II"" is a mixture of both horror and comedy - which is why it works so well. The film manages to make you go ""Urgh! Gross!"" AND laugh at the same time. Here's an example: in one scene there's a zombie trying to get out of a cellar through a trap door. Two men try to keep the trap door closed by standing, lying and jumping on it. But the zombie's head sticks out at the same time they're jumping on it. Whaddya get? A squashed head. And whaddya get when that happens? An eyeball that pops out of the head - one that goes flying across the room and goes straight into a screaming woman's mouth!!! HAHAHAHA. This film is hilarious! And the ""possessed hand"" scene is awesome.

I'm not saying it needs it, but on the big screen this film is so much more obviously amazing.  The crazy angles and tracking shots are very involving and basically disallow the viewer from not getting trapped into its story.

Especially nice about this movie is its fun.  The makers obviously never wanted to let up, so it just delves right in and never stops.  Not only does it not matter that a lot of the events in this film are unexplained, most of the time nobody thinks even to point that out.  The movie is so true to it's own desire to just immerse and never come out for breath that it is wonderfully self-secure.  It only gives a few tidbits of why things are happening to give the audience some foundation so as not to just float away in a random haze of chaos.

On a smaller screen, the effects don't seem very special, but on a wide-screen, they are quite good and still very fun.  The entire movie is by no means the greatest horror film in existence, but everything in it is good and just as good as it needs to be.

I'd say all horror fans should see it, but especially if there's a showing in an independant theatre nearby.  Then buy the DVD anyways because how else can you say you own a film where a woman gets raped by a tree?

945549,4,6304953747,"I remember the first time I saw previews for this movie when I was little and never taking the chance to see it. I never even rented it and I wanted to, but I was worried about it being just one of those ""by-the-numbers, just-like-every-other-horror-movie"" type of film. I went ahead and purchased the DVD, hoping that it would unlock some type of reaction - some kind of glimmer of hope. What's the verdict on this low-budget shocker?

First off, let me be one of the first to say that the camera angles in this movie really make it quite terrifying. Raimi's camera work is pure genius...he uses the camera angles and frenzied shots to his advantage, and they add more to the film, making it ultimately more creepy. EVIL DEAD is a real treat of a low-budget film, and the atmosphere will give you the chills for nights after you watch this. One of the many reasons this film is great is actor Bruce Campbell, who plays Ash, the hero of the film. His comic turns; his sense of dread; his fear; his anger; every thing he is feeling, you're feeling ultimately more. The other actors in this movie, Betsy Baker, Ellen Sandweiss, Sarah York...all of them lend this movie a realistic sense of dread that can only permeate from a great horror film. Mind you, this isn't just a horror movie...elements of comedy and action also flow into this, but make no mistake, this is still very much a shocker. After five people set out to the woods of a remote part of Tennessee, they find not quiet but chaos after awakening evil spirits in the backwoods with the incantation played from a tape reading scriptures from the ancient ""book of the dead"". People start getting possessed one by one (all except for Ash); one of the ladies has a rather lewd encounter with possessed trees; a mysterious and angry force is after our hero in the final frame of the film (which is by far one of the best I've ever seen); and Linda (Ash's girlfriend) goes nuts and eventually, is decapitated by Ash, who really had no choice in the matter. All the scenes at nighttime are chilling, no doubt this would be quite scary if it really were happening. Just be grateful that this is only a movie. The ending of the film is one of the strongest, and the sequel would perfectly pick right up where this low-budget chiller would leave us...hungry for more.

So if you're looking for a good scare this Halloween, you should look no further than THE EVIL DEAD. Though there are plenty of good fright flicks out there to enjoy, EVIL DEAD is a whole new experience, low-budget done right and done scary. You will never think of the woods the same way again after watching this...anyone rent a cabin?",1130371200,,2658,4.523908523908524

I mean how can you have 2 awesome looking ones and then a plain old Army Of Darkness? That just doesn't work, I also have to agree with what everbody else has said, why do they keep repackaging them and putting them in wide screen also, what a waste of tv, now when I watch my favourite movies (the Evil Dead trilogy) it's half the screen size I hate widescreen.

As his friends succumb to the evil spirits, Ash must fight them off in a bloody battle of unstoppable terror. Evil shows him no pity as he fights for his life as well as his soul.

A tour de force of low-budget film making which really shows (for all aspiring filmmakers) that you can make a great film with little money if you have talent.  Sam Raimi has talent.  This tale of five friends who go to stay at a backwoods cabin is truly terrifying.  The cabin is in the middle of nowhere and the cabin itself is a ramshackle mess.

The first signs you get of something wrong is when the wooden porch swing moves slightly and then abruptly stops.  The group finds a book (Necronomicon) and tape recorder with a guy doing weird incantations.  Soon Cheryl is guessing the playing cards without seeing them and is promptly possessed by a demonic spirit, taking a pencil and driving it into the ankle of another girl.  They eventually fight her off and lock her in the cellar where she taunts them.  One by one the rest of the friends become possessed except for Ash (Bruce Campbell) and he finds himself fighting off the demons by himself.

There are some really creepy scenes such as when Cheryl is sexually assaulted by a tree, and when Ash's girfriend playfully taunts ""Were gonna get you...We're gonna get you""  These are shudder inducing scenes!  The blood flows freely and thick as Ash does everything he can to destroy the demon's human bodies.

Raimi's cheap but effective gore, and dis-orienting camera work add to the unsettling feeling of the film.

It was an important film because it was made by the venerable Sam Raimi. Yeah, I know he's sold out nowdays making stupid big budget hollywood schlock, but this was made when Raimi was HUNGRY. Raimi pulls out of his bags of tricks (drawn from Kubrick, Hitchcock, and Leone)some clever scenes that sets a mood of sheer terror for a group of college kids on vacation in a secluded mountain cabin. As we've come to expect, Raimi plays this genre as true as possible just he does with whatever genre he tackles, he is indeed a man true to his craft. Supernatural evil abounds (which is THE most terrifying form of evil ) for the group as they mistakenly uncover the acient transcribings of The Book of the Dead which unleashes the evil (the Devil type of evil) on them. Photography is incredible considering the budget, and years later Raimi actually improves his effects with a bigger budget in Evil Dead II, but that's another film review. Raimi uses clever steady-cam shots to create incredible fast-paced moving horror footage that has set a new standard in the genre that no one has really been able to capture but himself. His use of the moving camera smacks of Kubrick's World War I trench scenes in Paths of Glory with a camera flawlessly moving ahead of a victim running for their life from an unseen, but incredibly scary evil force. I could go on an on about the groundbreaking moments of Evil Dead, but I digress. Enjoy this movie with someone in the dark on a cold, foggy night around midnight with the lights off.

The cast makes the whole movie work also, especially Bruce Cambell, star of all the Evil Dead series.  Probably the most recognizable part of the Evil Dead series is the first person perspective of the demon chasing after someone or running towards the house, very cool looking.

The movie is about a group of friends going out to a cabin in the woods to have fun, but they do not know about the evil living there.  As day turn to night, one of the girls get possessed and turns into a demon, the rest of the group have to stay together and fight the evil. Death by dawn, death by dawn.

  With that let me say to Horrorman horror movies aren't meant to be F**ken Shakespeare they are meant to be fun silly and that's the way fans like em if you want serious Movies go watch Casablanca or Citizen Kane if ya want a few hours of good fun then watch this or something else of the like. I mean I find it strange you call yourself horrorman yet almost all your reviews are negative I think I speak for the majority of horror fans worldwide that you are a F**ken joke.

You will be subjected to some creepy stuff also, but this movie is a dark comedy.  Even so, it will still scare you if you're a first time viewer.  When I first saw this I was gripping my seat as hard as my muscles would let me.  From the first act of violence you are thinking ""I'm screwed!"" for the entire film.  The only thing I dont' really like is the Cheryl ""Violated by the Woods"" scene, it's sort of disturbing, but with more views it's sort of funny.

So, if you're interested go out and rent this one and pop it into the VCR or DVD player, sit back, relax, and get grossed, and creeped out of your mind.  You'll also have a laugh or three.

Basically just a handful of creative kids with no money going nuts and among other things, doing all their own stunts, firing off real shotguns in to real glass directly in front of their real faces.

Although I haven't seen too many dvds with commentary, Evil Dead with the 2 different commentary tracks is the best Ive seen yet as the director, producer, and actor all give non stop insight and depth about the film instead of just rehashing whats going on on the screen ala book report style like some commentary does.

Im not involved in the film industry but after watching the cast and crew romp thru this challenging production (that took a few years) it reminded me of some of the times when I was younger, totally in my element and focused working on projects also with reckless abandon.

For those that haven't seen it....It is low budge, gory, action packed, interestingly filmed (odd angles and movements with the camera), classic mythological story, and has an intriguing soundtrack.  Dont expect the gloss of your typical flavor of the month multi million dollar Hollywood FX film though as this is not that type of movie.

I enjoyed Bruce Campbell's commentary as he had a lot to say (unlike Kurt Russel in the Thing commenetry that couldn't even remember most of the movie), came across as sharp, witty, and funny.  The commenatry by the director and producer was also well done and delivers.

And even though it's unrealistic, I love the gore.  They really made what little money they had strech far.

Besides that almost everything is pretty good, although the character Ash is almost always covered in blood or a bunch of blood is being splattered on him, and in some ways they overdid it a bit too much.

The acting is pretty bad, even Bruce Campbell is ineffectual in the early scenes of the movie, but once the demons kick in, Campbell turns on the talent and assuages a classic hero in Ash.  The gore is plenty, but the special effects are rather cheesy, down to the oatmeal that comes out of one of the demons near the end.  But one can't deny director Sam Raimi's incomparable style and energy.  There is suspense in every scene in the cabin; the incessant barrage of blood and violence in the final scenes is both repulsive and mesmerizing.  Notice how Raimi uses Campbell's and his girlfriend's eyes in two very different ways.  Initially, it's a lover's game over whether or not she's going to open a surprise gift; later, it's a demonic game when he's preparing to bury his former lover's demonic body.  I guess the reason THE EVIL DEAD stands at the head of its class is its bold desire to be as frighteningly horrific and sardonically humorous at the same time, with no respite for the weary.  It's claustrophobic intensity and its over the top action makes THE EVIL DEAD one of our most unique and thrilling horror films, spawning two commendable sequels as well and making both Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi very successful young men.",1114214400,4,1351,4.670886075949367

Had Raimi only showed the same love towards the genre and the characters as he did in the Spiderman films... But, of course, he didn't. No love, only talant.

There is a scene that shows the attitude of the film maker, where one of the character screams: ""Why are you torturing me like this?"" Obviously, that's a relavant question in many horror movies. That is if you're watching the movie, not if you're in it. The perspective in this film is rather distanced. Raimi is sitting in his horror movie sofa, laughing at the mysteries of the genre.

The Limited Edition ""Book of the Dead"" version, Latex  cover and all really falls into the ""Absolutely got to have it because I am an insane fan"" category.

If someone at Sam's production House actually worked up a proper copy of the Book of the Dead ( Necronomicon? ) together with a copy of the film dagger prop, then people would likely part with bundles of cash to get it, well ... tops for me might be 150 dollars.

Anyways, the content of the book of the dead is fairly lame. Nice to have as a prop .... scares the hell out of anyone who sees it in my collection ( alongside of Eddie's Archives ).

The added items in the DVD  make it worth the money in some ways, but if people on the production side maybe thought like a fan, and produced fan based products ( i.e.  some sort of decent quality, and maybe even asked some fans what they wanted) then perhaps these special editions would bring in more, since the price would be appropriate.",1101772800,4,1087,4.299019607843137

945740,5,6304953747,"Even though it's been more than 20 years since its original release, 1982's THE EVIL DEAD is still an impressive marvel of low-budget filmmaking.  It does have its palpable flaws, but this first feature-length directorial effort from SPIDERMAN's (2002) Sam Raimi, produced on a shoestring budget of circa $350,000, offers clever special FX, interesting make-up work, relentless shocks, and brilliant direction and camera work.  And of considerable note to genre fans, it highlights Raimi's knack for pushing violence and gore to such an extreme that it becomes comic or farcical, a characteristic that is enhanced by the slapstick talents of actor Bruce Campbell (who would himself become a cult hero due to his work in this and other Raimi films).

The story involves a group of college students who, during a weekend getaway, find a Sumerian Book of the Dead in an old wilderness cabin they've rented.  When they unwittingly unleash evil spirits and demons while reading incantations from the book, that's when the real havoc--and the real fun for the audience--begins.  As each of the kids, one by one, are possessed by the demons they've loosed, body parts and bodily fluids go a-flying until only one young man is left to face down the Evil Dead.  A simple plot with a simple set up, but Raimi and Campbell effectively milk it for all the scares and all the laughs they can get.

There are several editions of THE EVIL DEAD available on DVD, most of which come from the wonderful folks at Anchor Bay.  Most are of great quality and offer beautifully restored digital transfers of this cult classic.  The best discs also include feature commentaries from Raimi and Campbell.",1100390400,68,1678,4.943060498220641
945741,5,6304953747,"There's a reason why The Evil Dead is always listed among the greats of the horror genre. Ignore what you know about the sequals and focus on the horrific beauty of this movie.

While the rest of the Evil Dead movies tried for over the top gore for comedic effect, the orginal is a strait up scary movie, with non-stop thrills. The plot revolves around five teens who rent a cabin deep in the woods. They find a book called the Necramonicon and a tape recording of a translation of the spells inside. Unfortunetly, playing the tape turns out out to not be the best idea in the world, as evil spirits are drawn into the world of the living and begin possessing the teens. Soon only Ash (Bruce Campbell) is left and it's up to him to find a way to stop his undead friends. What follows is a bloody fight between Ash and the ""Deadites"".

This movie was Sam Raimi's big break. He really shows what a good director can do with a small budget and a cheap camera. The movie has a documentary-like feel to it that many horror movies try, yet fail to really achieve. Bruce Campbell is great as a guy who is thrust into a situation with no idea what to do. He doesn't make a move against the zombies until closer to the end of the film. The other actors give good performances in some memorable scenes, like the infamous forest sequence, and Ash's confrontation with his undead girlfriend.

Lots of other movies have come out to try to imitate what Raimi did and none have surpassed this movie. It's not fair to compare the original to Evil Dead 2 or Army of Darkness since they are more comedic then horror. As far as horror movies go The Evil Dead stands on top as king of the mountain.

945793,4,6304953747,"First I'll tell you everything that's wrong with ""The Evil Dead"" -- the acting is poor, the dialogue is bad, the characters are 2-D, the special effects are cheesy and the film quality is mediocre. And you know what? ""The Evil Dead"" is still one of the most transgressive, experimental horror films ever made.

The plot is about as bare-bones as it gets: A group of college kids go into the woods of Tennessee for some R&R, they find a tape recording of the cabin's owner reciting passages from the ""Book of the Dead"" that unwittingly release demons into the surrounding woods, and one by one the cast is possessed. The only way to stop the possessed is through the act of bodily dismemberment... and even then, decapitated heads continue to giggle and squeal; severed limbs continue to twitch and bleed. Before long our blood-soaked hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) is alone in a fight for his life against the possessed corpses of his friends.

""The Evil Dead"" is an absolute clinic in how to do low-budget horror right. Sam Raimi shocks the viewer with gore: There are decapitations and axe dismemberments, gnawed off hands, pus-spewing demons, thumbs in eye sockets, a cabin that drips blood, and in one of the more queasy scenes I've witnessed in any movie, a woman is brutally raped by vines out in the woods. But Raimi doesn't just pulverize the viewer with carnage; he also uses odd-angled shots and an eerie ""loud-quiet-loud"" score to disorient the viewer and build an eerie, hallucinatory atmosphere: By the end of the film, the relentless howl of the woods outside the cabin becomes almost as frightening as the goriest dismemberment.

This is easily one of the goriest, most creative movies I've seen, and a real landmark not just in horror films but also in low-budget film making. A must have for horror fans.",1097798400,5,1816,4.777070063694268

Not in the way that I found it revolting (it takes a lot to do that to me)  But I was in this state of mind while watching it.  The best way to describe it I guess would be like playing a really good survival video game running for your life (without actually running) and having a slight adrenaline rush.  As the credits rolled by, I said to myself ""Whoa..."".  No film can do this nowadays.  No film can have as much blood as the Evil Dead has and get shown in theaters.  On a friend of mine's copy it says rated R.  On Amazon.com it says NC-17.  On my copy it says NR (Not Rated).  I ordered it from Amazon, so this is probably and error on their part.  Either way, you know you're in for a hell of a ride when/if you check out the Evil Dead.  Definitely not for those with weak stomachs and definitely not for someone who works in the MPAA who wants all movies made for kiddies.  A woman gets raped by a tree for Christ's sake!

The special features are good (Like the 18 minutes of raw footage), but it appears as though there are more features on the other editions.  One thing that is lacking on all of them (I think) is that there isn't a Within the Woods movie as a special feature.  For those who don't know, Within the Woods was a low budget prequel of sorts to the Evil Dead.  Read more about it (and all of his movies) in Bruce Campbell's autobiography If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B movie Actor.  This movie can not be redone in any way shape or form.

 Notice how there's all the remakes and sequels/prequels nowadays?  If they tried to remake Evil Dead, it would be less gory.  Probably something like 50 percent less and no body fluids (the white stuff) other then blood.  No one can redo this classic and they would fail miserably if they tried.  Well, I hoped this helped.

 A young Bruce Campbell plays a twenty something college student that vacations at a lonely cabin in the mountains with a group of friends who stumble upon an ancient evil that disrupt their lives forevermore. There really isn't much more that I can say concerning the storyline that hasn't already been said already in reviews here other than that its fairly simple, formulaic, and you have seen similar plots in nearly every slasher movie made. However, unlike many other low-budget slasher flicks, ""Evil Dead"" has a uniqueness of its own with its queer humor, disorienting camera angles, special effects and gore.
 The only thing that was disappointing about this movie is that Campbell's character hadn't yet developed his caustic sarcasm and arrogance that is experienced in the other ""Evil Dead"" movies. There is no mention of the trademark ""groovy"" or ""come get some."" Also, the comical dark humor found in the other movies are missing here although there is a deliberate amount of cheesiness.
 Overall, no horror movie collection is complete without this low-budget classic horror flick.",1091577600,4,1133,5.141304347826087

The plot has been explained over a hundred times : Five people spend the night in a cabin in the middle of the woods, and one by one they are possessed by the dead. It's really simple. Everything is so great looking, especially for the so-low budget.

For the weak stomached people out there, do not watch after Ash throws the book in the fire. The play-do looking effects at the end are not only sick, but they are the way gore should be done. How many movies have you seen that did gore this way? Totally gross, wicked, and awesome. The greatest zombie/demon film of the eighties.

There were also a few cool scenes worth the rental alone. What I didn't like about it was it was some-what boring. It was also just felt a *bit* too short.

945855,5,6304953747,"Low budget horror does not get much better than ""The Evil Dead"". In fact no other low budget horror film even looks like ""The Evil Dead"" thanks to Sam Raimi (The director of ""Spider-Man"" for the ladies and gentlemen of you out there who do not know this.) So if you want to see how a big director starts from the real bottom end of film making and works his way up then you need to watch this film at all costs. Besides he was just a young kid when he made it (using a school's 16mm film camera)..... and so were his friends who acted in it.... and they ended up making a film which coined the term ""video nasty'! The movie was filmed in 1979 and released in 1982 where it hit the video market just at the right time. It was one of the very first cult classics promoted by the advent of video tape.
`The Evil Dead' IS one of the nastiest films ever made. It contains extreme violence, blood, torture, beheadings, dismemberments, mutilations, gore, violence towards women, chain saws - all in FULL VIEW of the camera. No holds where bared in the making of this film but some countries may show this movie in a censored form which entails the removal of about six minutes from the film (This is uncut and the UK recently released it uncut). The story is original, fast paced, scary and extremely enjoyable. Many fans watch it over and over and over again. Many of today's new film making talent watch this film over and over again and it is obvious to see why.
The camera work is used unusually, skillfully and surprisingly (so rare these days). The editing is dramatic and the low budget special effects must be given credit for the end results which beat the pants out of some of things that hit the shelves these days. In short, the film making aspect is really what ""The Evil Dead"" is all about. Here the director is really giving you a bang for what bucks he had.
The premise is a simple one to explain. Five young kids go to a cabin in the woods for a short vacation. In the house they find a tape recording which manages to invoke an incantation which wakes up the evil in the woods. It comes after them - turning some of them into the undead, demons, zombies and flesh eating ghouls. Cue lots of household items being used as weapons, an initially sissy anti-hero (Bruce Campbell) who becomes the GOD of million adoring horror fans (you'll see why when you watch it and certainly the sequel is even better still!!) and low budget special effects galore. Copied by a hundred thousand other horror films, exploited by a million uncensored bootleg copies - `The Evil Dead' is still the low budget horror king. And that is a hard act to beat!",1085616000,2,2644,4.3869653767820775

What follows is a further hour of low budget dismemberment, slicing, dicing, chopping, slashing, cutting, you name it and I'll add it to the list. Anyway, great movie, I recomend it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because it needed a better plotline, and because sence I've only seen it once I can't remember it well enough.

945857,4,6304953747,"Being a big fan of Army of Darkness for some time I'd long been planning on checking out the first 2 Evil Dead films. I picked up Evil Dead 2, and while it is quite good it didn't quite live up to expectations. Still, I was sufficiently intrigued that I decided to finally pick up the original. By this point, however, I was a bit suspicious of it, starting to wonder if the consistently positive reviews of it were a case of mass hysteria, or if the low budget combined with an emphasis on gore and visual effects would make it seem too dated. Fortunately, my concerns over the film made my actually seeing all the more enjoyable, as it easily surpassed expectations and still stands as a first rate horror film.
I need to say, right off the bat, that this is a serious horror film.  Most people know this, but there is a fairly sizable contingent who seem to think that this is a parody or comedy.(as are the sequels) It does contain some humor, and has a greater emphasis on being unusual and surreal than your average horror film, but it is, by and large, very serious.
As most critics love to point out, this film is a bit short on plot.(Not that I'm looking for plot when I see a horror movie) In short, 5 young adults go to a cabin in the woods, find a book, find a tape, play the tape, become possessed by demons and must fight the demons.  It's not much on paper, but the execution is excellent.  The major caveat is the acting, although it really isn't as bad as lots of people make it out to be.  I would rarely call it good, but it usually isn't bad enough that I'm taken out of the movie.  Also, the visual effects occasionally falter, most notably during the 2 obvious uses of ridiculous looking dummy heads. Overall, the effects aren't necessarily realistic, but they are generally cool or gross or both.  And their lack of realism doesn't much matter as it is well established that once possessed the people change greatly from a physical standpoint, and are far from human.  Lots of the gore effects are self-consciously over the top, most notably the moist 'n gooey claymation extravaganza at the end.  The most effective effect, however, is just about the simplest.  This is, of course, the agonizing pencil-to-the-ankle scene, which stands as one of the most painful scenes to watch that I've come across.  Also of particular note is the scene where one of the demons proceeds to chew their own hand off. A tad inexplicable, but effective none the less.
This movie is interesting as it displays an unusual combination in horror films: it is very gory, yet it is very slow and deliberately paced.  The first half of the film is largely uneventful, but I think it sets the mood pretty well and is more interesting then the exposition of your average horror film.  And the second half, which is pretty much non-stop horror is still slow and deliberate, as the demons are sadistic and playful, choosing to mock and torment their victims rather than simply kill them outright.  The horror set pieces are generally excellent. I particularly like when the lone Ash is assailed by 2 demons simultaneously, one in the room with him, the other clutching at him from the below.  While this movie isn't really scary, it is pretty eerie at times.  The initial possession is quite creepy, particularly the spontaneous levitation and her slow, crippled movements.  The standard 'character is walking through the empty rooms looking for someone' are unusually good as well, generally generating some real tension.  The demons are occasionally a bit over the top, but this is largely negated as they are clearly intended to be a bit mischivious.(murderous too, however) They're makeup is usually pretty effective as well, if a bit weird.  Cheryl's blue, sometimes grey-blue witch face is more effective then it seemed from still pictures, particularly when she is laughing with blood pouring out of her mouth.  Linda's porcelain doll make-up is kinda annoying to look at but it fits her evil and giggly little girl persona very well. Every character has their face horribly mangled or covered in blood at some point during the film and they generally look quite disgusting.
Sam Raimi is famed for his inventive camera work, and it shines here.  The scenes where Ash is apparently on the brink of insanity are quite cool, with lots of crazy shots, ranging from ones tilted at a 45 degree angle to one looking directly down from the rafters to extremely low shots, from underfoot. The absolute visual highlight of the film comes when we are given a low shot viewing two corpses in the foreground.  Ash proceeds drag one of the bodies outside and the camera tracks him, moving along side til it reveals the possessed Cheryl waiting patiently in the basement. The `force' shots are pretty cool to, particularly the one where it rams through the cars windshields.
A few closing notes. Personally, I found the infamous plant scene to be a bit, I dunno, stupid.  The end of it was just messed up. Not a huge flaw by any means, but it did hurt the film a bit. Also, as many have mentioned, make sure to get the Elite version.  All Anchor Bay versions are in pseudo-widescreen where they matted out the top and bottom of the picture.  I accidentally got one matted as such, and while it probably isn't a huge deal, it's just stupid to have it cut like that.
All in all this is a very good horror film. It's got gore and violence combined with well designed scenes and plenty of visual flair. Check it out.

The thing to keep in mind while watching this is that it was made on a shoe string budget back in the early 80's.  So sure, the special effects don't hold a candle to what can be done today, but for the time, it worked.  And the make-up -- the voices and those white eyes -- always scared the bejeezus out of me.

945895,4,6304953747,"When asked my favorite series of films, I will likely say THE EVIL DEAD.  As far as horror series go, ""Evil Dead"" is definitely my favorite.  ""The Evil Dead"" is the first film in the trilogy, a low-budget film with a $250,000 budget that ended up being one of the most popular and influential horror films ever made.  Drawing inspiration from films like ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"", ""Evil Dead"" was the first film to demonstrate Sam Raimi's creative genius.
The story involves five friends (your typical 70's college students) who travel to an abandoned cabin in the woods.  There, they unwittingly resurrect evil demons which have one goal: to scare you out of your skin - literally.  You see, these ain't just flesh-hungry demons: they're flesh-possessing demons.  With the friends being picked off one-by-one, in the end, only Ash (Bruce Campbell) is remaining.  Now it's up to him to save the day (or night) and get the hell out of there before the demons reach him.
Sam Raimi, who is in fact much more of a Three Stooges/comedy fan than a horror fan demonstrates his creative genius here.  The story was surprisingly original, and the script is filled with suspense and scares.  Then there's Tom Sullivan's terrific effects; there's enough barrels of gore here to make even the strong-stomached feel sick.  Joseph LoDuca also contributes a creepy score; Bruce Campbell's performance is good, but comes nowhere near being comparable to his role in the sequels.
I loved ""The Evil Dead"" when I first saw it and still do.  It is one of my favorite horror films, and undoubtedly a horror masterpiece, using all the tricks in the book while creating some new ones.  ""Evil Dead"" is a true horror classic, and essential for any and all horror lovers.

This was something I had been looking forward to since I first heard about this movie on Houseofhorrors.com and a Leonard Maltin review. Six days later, at five in the morning (after a nightmare about watching a horror movie where the floor turned into quicksand), I watched THE EVIL DEAD for the first time. And I was hooked! This movie was indeed gory, and is still among the goriest horror movies ever made, but it was genuinely scary as well, with a great music score and atmosphere created in the woods! It became a habit to see THE EVIL DEAD late at night when everybody else was asleep. So far I have seen THE EVIL DEAD about 25 times.
In late March of 2002, my sister Flora gave me this Book Of The Dead Limited Edition DVD as a belated birthday present. This is by far the best packaging of THE EVIL DEAD that Anchor Bay Entertainment has provided. It looks just like the Book Of The Dead in the movie right down to the pages! (And no, I have not tried to recite any of the passages in the book.) The DVD has a great widescreen transfer of the film, a fun audio commentary track by the star of the film, Bruce Campbell (I listened to this track on my most recent viewing), as well as one by director Sam Raimi and producer Robert Tapert, a documentary by Campbell about fans of horror and sci-fi, and a documentary on the film's distribution in England, along with a wealth of other cool supplements!
During the weekend of August 16 and 17 of last year, I met special effects artist Tom Sullivan and the ladies of THE EVIL DEAD at the Horrorfind convention in Maryland. They were all really nice; in fact, I learned from Sullivan how he achieved all those effects, saw the props he created, and even learned about how they tried to title and release the film. They also signed my Book Of The Dead and it was one of many wonderful experiences at the convention! All I need now is Bruce Campbell's autograph in my Book Of The Dead (and on my EVIL DEAD 2 and ARMY OF DARKNESS Boomstick Edition); hopefully I'll get it this year!

The DVD displays a sharp clear picture for such dated material and cheap production. My main complaint is that this is another one of those many DVD's out there that feature an old movie CLAIMING to have DTS surround sound. First off the movie never had DTS in the theatres, DTS was never used in the sound process in filming the movie besides this DVD's inserting of bogus sound effects and reditributing VERY LITTLE sounds into a faked DTS process. The DTS surround sounds on this one, especially one CLAIMING to have DTS-ES, are just about nothing much. Maybe two or three scences have redistributed sounds in the back & side speakers. I didn't notice much. The sounds quality is not bad, it's just not any form of true DTS surround sound. Most DVD's featuring old movies that never had DTS in the beginning haven't been very good in my opinion. The Dolby Digital EX process is much better when it comes to reproducing and redistributing surround sounds through home theatre sound systems.""The Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen Before)"" was done excellent using the Dolby Digital EX for transfer to DVD.",1078185600,,1216,4.767772511848341

Directed and written by Sam Raimi.
 Five young adults are in a yellow automobile having just crossed the state of Tennessee. Scott (Richard DeManincor), Shelly (Theresa Tilly), Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his sister Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) and Linda (Betsy Baker).  There is an invisible evil force running in the woods. Suddenly, the car almost hits a red truck. They are fine, but now they come to a sign that says ""Dangerous Bridge"". They have to go across it to get to the cabin. As they drive on it, wood boards fall down in the water below. The tire hits a hole and the car stops. More wood falls. The car is able to move on and they finally come to the cabin. This is their first time here at this cabin. The hanging porch bench is repeatedly knocking into the cabin. When Scott reaches for the gold ring with the keys, the bench suddenly stops. It is dusty and foggy in the cabin (a Hollywood effect to get your attention).
  Later that night, Cheryl is drawing on paper the clock on the wall. At 6:52pm, the clock pendulum stops and the clock rings. A wind rushes through the window where Cheryl is sitting. An eerie voice says ""Join us!"". Suddenly, her hand is forced by something invisible to draw on the artist paper. Then the trap door begins to move. While everyone is having dinner at the table, the trap door quickly flips open. The men look at the door. Scott decides to go down there in the dark. Ash calls to him, but no answer.
  This is going to be a wild weekend.

For anyone who really loves The Evil Dead, whether it was then or you just discovered it, this is the DVD package to own.  I had never seen the movie with such clarity.  I had NO idea that it was so well done.  I should have known that it was better than those old copies of copies videotapes made it look!  It's Sam Raimi for goodness' sake!
But anyway, with the Book of the Dead artwork, the extras, and the article inside, it's a great thing to own and display.  I can't tell you how many people have been intrigued by the DVD just propped up on my entertainment center.  (It goes really well with the Julia figure from Hellbound, too!)

945949,5,6304953747,"When I first heard of Evil Dead, it wasn't in some upscale, fancy movie mag, like EW or Rolling stone. I heard about it from fans of the other horror films I liked; Night of the living dead, texas chainsaw massacre, etc. They said it was one of the few films which was made up of every element that stuck out in these other pictures and still stood tall to the original source material. In terms of entertainment, the film is a 10+. In terms of filmaking, its a little lower. the film was Raimi's first attempt at a motion picture, and he didn't have a lot to work with. The make up is masterfully implemented by the other worldly camera, a charecter in its own. If you care even slightly about horror, see this and the 2 sequels.
Oh, and if you are in the market for a DVD of Evil Dead, get this one, not the expensive Book of the Dead one. This has all the features you need on the Book of the Dead, except a short made by Bruce Campbell about fanboys. This has all the others and its in Widescreen with THX sound, so this is the disc for all the cheapo's (like me) out there.",1075248000,3,1078,4.113744075829384

Later in my teens, I saw it again, finally.  Didn't scare me as it did when i was younger, but I still appreciated it's raw gore and attempt to simply catch you off-guard for a good jump-from-your-seat scare effect.
Now, at 30, I had to order this on DVD.  You can bet I'm going to show it to my kids when they hit the age I was when I first saw it.  Will it have the same effect?  I HOPE SO!  If not, at least they'll see what scared the hell out of dad at their age and that's good enough for me.
I'll agree it has plenty of bad acting, a silly story-line and plenty of ""fake"" fake blood, but man, it is what it is...a horror film.  To me, this is just one of those pure horror movies that doesn't need anything other than what you see to freak you out.  Raimi did alot with a little in this one.

When you consider that Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, and their friends just decided to make a horror movie and went out and did it, it boggles the mind! They were all just kids from Michigan State University, on a top-secret (so secret, they didn't know it themselves) mission to make movie history. The result is an intense 85 minutes of dread and terror! Ash (Campbell) and his friends are staying in a cabin in the middle of the deep woods. They have no idea that this particular cabin is the stomping-grounds for a demonic presence of pure evil. Unleashed through a tape-recorded recitation, the dark forces descend upon Ash and company, possessing them and playing sadistic games with each. Death, oozing gore, and rape by a tree (!!) are only some of the things that make this unforgettable. Turn out the lights and enjoy...",1072915200,2,909,4.870967741935484

946008,3,6304953747,"I have to frankly admit that I was hesitant in purchasing this DVD. The reason being is that I purchased ""Evil Dead 2"" first after reading several of the rave reviews posted on this site. I was extremely disappointed with it, at first (I have since re-watched the sequel multiple times and I like it now, almost as much as the original. Sometimes you need watch a film more than once I guess).

The story deals with several people spending some quiet time in an isolated cabin in the middle of nowhere. They accidentally stumble upon an old book - the very powerful ""Book Of The Dead"" and foolishly recite some of its incantations and in doing so, unleash hell upon themselves. The demons start by raping one of the unfortunate girls and later possess her. The victim, once it is clearly evident that she is possessed by a malevolent demon, is put under restraint and thrown in the cellar however the demonic infection is passed to others until the only one left is our hero Ash who must fight to survive amongst the possessed. The film moves along at a good pace and there is gore-a-plenty. What makes this film slightly superior than its sequel, in my opinion, is that it's scarier despite its much lower budget (""Dead by Dawn"" clearly had a better budget and better special effects). It is over the top but not  to the extent of the sequel. There are no severed walking hands, laughing moose-heads or laughing lamps. What you get are frightening possession scenes, reminiscent of ""The Exorcist"", pencil stabbings, be-headings and a lot of blood and slimy gore. The films major strength lies in it's creativity and excellent make-up effects, although some of the clay-mation effects in the climax are a bit cheesy and not as effective.

Gore-hounds and horror film fans will find a lot to like in this fast paced shocker that delivers the goods despite it obvious low budget.

Overall a solid movie, scarier then the 2nd and 3rd. This movie isn't scary, but it's creepy, a good family horror movie.",1068163200,,331,4.442622950819672

Hmmm, if they'd been married for years, it might not seem that far-fetched.
This movie plays like a video version of an EC horror comic book. If this film doesn't creep you out, try watching it again on a large-screen set with hi-fi surround sound, at midnight with all the lights off in your house.
I live in a heavily-wooded area, and when the spell that summons the Evil Dead was recited, all of the igniters on my gas range started firing non-stop, forcing me to unplug the unit.

Ash and his friends have traveled up to a somewhat abandoned cabin, where they find a tape player in the basement and play it..... So that resurrects the evil dead. Then one after one they get possessed then its up to ash to kill them. There is some cool gore scenes including full body dismemberment with an axe and an AWESOME eye gouge.

I've seen since a lot of Sam Raimi's work including his blockbuster hit Spiderman. But this movie is so great because it shows us a young Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell just haveing fun.
The Evil Dead tells the story of five college age kids who go to a cabin in Tennesse to do what college kids on breaks do. They end up staying in this weird cabin. They find in the basement of it a tape recorder and a book. The book is the book of the dead. There is a tape recorder and it is played. On the recorder is a chant that releases terrible evil on our 5 college breakers and the rest is history.
Bruce Campbell is great. The story, effects, acting, and plot are so cheesy. Not everyone can play that kind of role and Bruce plays cult hero Ash to perfection. He's funny as anything. You don't know what he's going to expect next from the zombies and it had me laughing so hard seeing some of his reactions. He is even better in Army of Darkness.
The special effects in Evil Dead are great. They are so cheesy and lame it's fantastic. There is so much blood and gore it's funny. Does a zombie really have that much blood. The contacts the people where when they are zombies are great too. The slapstck with the fighting of the zombies is great too.
Evil Dead is a fantastic movie. All the members of the cast helped the crew build sets, do effects and set up shots. It's a great movie made by some great people just wanting to have fun making fun of b-rated horror movies.

946105,5,6304953747,"If you've never seen Evil Dead, you're probably wondering what all the fuss is about. This is one of those movies that every horror fan has either seen or won't admit if he or she hasn't. Not to mention, it's a must for anyone's DVD collection, if only because this is the film that introduced the world to the likes of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell.
The plot is simple enough. A group of college students vacation at an isolated cabin, only to unwittingly unleash demonic spirits and one by one become possessed by them. Won't you kids ever learn?
What seperates this from other horror fare is Raimi's innovative directing. Even in his first film, his talent for visual flair enhances nearly every scene. At one point, his camera maniacally chases a character through the woods, and at another, he splatters the camera with blood, drenching the scene in red. In fact, Raimi does his darnedest to make this film unlike anything else you've experienced in a horror movie. On particular scene comes to mind, an infamous scene where vines out in the woods ""take advantage of"" (for the lack of a subtler term) one of the female characters. This is one of those scenes that's so outrageous, it sticks with you long after the movie is finished.
By today's standards, most viewers won't find the movie terribly scary. However, Raimi does a nice job at setting the proper atmosphere with creaky porch swings, creepy fruit cellers, and plenty of trees and fog. Considering the low budget, some of the effects are nicely done. One of my favorites include Bruce Campbell touching a mirror, only to have his hand sink into it like a pool of water. Very cool. Sure, some of the scenes are now corny or ridiculous (as both Raimi and company admit during the commentary), but that's just part of the appeal, right?
The acting isn't great, but what do you expect from a B-movie? Campbell hasn't quite turned into the Ash-character popularized by its sequels, but he plays the role with a nice edge of hopelessness, bordering on cowardice. The supporting characters are passable enough.
The DVD extras are a definite bonus, particularly the commentary tracks. Anyone interested in how the film was made and its makers will enjoy both the Raimi/Tapert and Bruce Campbell tracks. If you're buying the ""Necronomicon"" Limited Edition, a short documentary by Bruce Campell called ""FANalysis"" is also worth a look. The Limited edition also comes with a replica of the Necronomicon (i.e. the book of the dead) in the film. It's neat, but unless you're a die-hard fan (like me) it's maybe not worth the money that some people would have you fork out for it.
The audio and picture of the DVD transfer are amazing; Evil Dead has never looked or sounded better. Fans should be very happy. In short, own this movie! It's a classic.",1062806400,,2801,4.741803278688525

But you have to remember that this was made by a group of kids on an extremely tight budget. If you realize that, and watch it with an open mind, you will really get the full effect. Evil Dead II is also very good, although it's definitely more cartoony than the first. Oh, and by the way, to all of you who still think the movie is a horrible waste of time, keep in mind that if this movie had been a miserable failure, then Sam Raimi would never have directed such a good ""Spiderman"" movie!

946110,5,6304953747,"I was lucky enough to see this film at a drive in(remember those?)when it 1st came out! I didn't really know what to expect except the small amount of knowledge(that it was a Horror-Zombie
movie)that I got from trailer's on tv. WOW! What a pleasant suprise, & scare! Yep scare; this was probably the last Horror film I saw that did scare me!
 I took a girlfriend w/me to the drive-in that nite. There was another 'horror' film on 1st, but because ""Evil Dead"" was such a great film & suprise I cannot recall the other film. About 1/3 of the way through the film, we had an incredible,(but thankfully very brief)lightening & thunderstorm descend upon the drive-in! The lightening was so intense for several mins that it actually enhanced the overall 'spooky' feeling of this film! The girl simply kept her eye's covered with her hand, after the 1st violent act occured!!
 Anyway, Sam Raimi(imo)hasn't made any decent films(Except ""Evil Dead II"" I didn't care for ""Army of Darkness"")since this one, even though my 22 year old son tells me another 'Zombie-horror film' is in the works from Raimi! Why not? He went on to make a ton of money, & could have used some of it to do what he does best, make another true horror film! But no. We get schlock like
""Spiderman"" & all the other junk he's directed.
 Where have all the smart young director's of real horror films gone? Why not make a horror film 1st, take chances like Raimi did, & experiment. I can't recall what ""Evil Dead"" originally cost..my son told me, & it was a ridiculously low figure, a figure that most independent film director's can work wonders with if they're truly talented! Another good example is Robert Rodriguez' ""El Mariachi"", or Tarrentino's ""Resevouir Dog's"". Now the last was a higher budget independent film but you get the idea. Where are the director's willing to take a chance on showing their genius(like Raimi did here)in a horror film.
 The performance by the cast is phenomenal, including that by Bruce Cambell. However, the unique placement of the camera's(the overhead tracking shot while Bruce is walking or running through the house, along with the 'wooshing' sound each time he passes
through a door, reminds me of Scorsese's great end seaquence of the brilliant ""Taxi Driver"", when Travis has killed everyone & saved Jodie, & sits on the couch while the police arrive. Martin
actually cut out a huge section of the upstairs floor to get his shot, & I would imagine Raimi learned his technique from that?)and the excellent very creepy, segments in the house's basement, along with the great use of fog & gore make this probably the greatest Zombie film ever made.
 I sure hope my son's right? Raimi needs to return to 'what got him going in the 1st place', & new,1st time director's NEED to give the Horror genre a 'shot in the arm' & revive it, by making it their 1st film. One can only hope. What a wonderful, clever well thought out film by a 1st time director& a group of no name actor's! Bravo. But please, we want more.",1060214400,,3011,4.641651031894934

946112,5,6304953747,"The Evil Dead is one of the true Hall of Fame cult classics in the field of horror, a movie more than justified in billing itself as ""the ultimate in grueling horror.""  Its pervasive influence is felt strongly even today, and the movie stands as a primer on how to do terror most effectively.  There are very few movies that I consider truly scary, but this low-budget Sam Raimi masterpiece of gory terror managed to delightfully tweak my hard-to-find fright nerves on several occasions.  I was scrabbling to return light to my darkened room as soon as the end credits appeared.  High school buddies Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, with the help of Robert Tapert, took their work very seriously, studying the reaction of drive-in horror movie audiences to see what works and what does not work in this type of film.  This research made them wise beyond their early twenty-something years, as they committed themselves to a creed of ""the gore the merrier,"" never letting up for a second once the real horror began.
Raimi, Campbell, and Tapert parlayed a sixteen hundred dollar thirty minute film called Within the Woods into a three hundred fifty thousand dollar investment venture to make this film, originally called Book of the Dead.  They led a small group of visionaries, including the unforgettable ladies of Evil Dead, into the cold Tennessee wilderness and proceeded to make, sometimes almost on the fly, one of the most effective, unrelenting scary movies of all time.  As the story goes, five young people, two men and three women, travel deep into the countryside to a run-down cabin for reasons never explained, discovering far more than a mysterious tape recording and obviously infernal book bound in human skin in the cellar.  The tape reveals the voice of a supposed scientist who had come to this desolate spot along with his wife to study the ancient Sumerian Book of the Dead which he had discovered.  Foolishly, he records himself reading the ancient tongue of the books demonic conjurations, and even more foolishly Ashley ""Ash"" Williams (Bruce Campbell) and Scotty (Hal Delrich) play these words, unknowingly calling forth from the earth an evil more ancient and terrifying than anything they could ever have imagined.  Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss), having earlier witnessed undeniable manifestations of something not good underneath the cellar door, foolishly goes out into the night in search of whomever she knows it out there, finding only a forest of trees seemingly alive and determined to rape her.  After finding her way back to the cabin, she is the first person to be possessed by the appropriately named Evil Dead, and she delivers what is to me the most satisfying attack in a movie bursting at the seams with one attack after another.  One by one, as the terrifying night unfolds, the quintet of friends are possessed and changed into disgustingly foul demons, until only one gore-encrusted survivor is left to battle his former friends for a life that can no longer even seem worth living.
I went into this film somewhat questioning the power of its legendary heritage, but once the first zombification scene rolled around, I knew that The Evil Dead was going to fully live up to its dark promise.  These poor ladies, Ellen Sandweiss, Betsy Baker, and Theresa Tilly, let the makeup artists do anything to them, and they willingly and enthusiastically turned themselves into the sickest of creatures.  I can hardly imagine how much Karo syrup was procured for this production, as the blood and gore just kept coming nonstop.  The fight for survival led to the brutal use of axes, fingers to the eyes, shotguns, planks, everything within reach of the victims in that truly creepy little cabin in the dark woods.  Bruce Campbell took some time to grow into his role, but once his wimpy character saw what he had to do if he were to have any chance of surviving, he turned in a magnificent performance, exhibiting fear and loathing as well as any horror movie actor I have ever had the demented joy of watching.
The Evil Dead is a landmark horror film that all fans of the genre should be required to see, preferably in the darkest, more fear-enducing environment possible.  Having it available on DVD in widescreen format is wonderful in and of itself, but this DVD (ASIN B00005R24K) comes with extras to further delight the gore-lovers out there.  You get the theatrical trailer, four TV spots, a poster and still gallery, impressively lengthy cast and crew biographies, a Ladies of the Evil Dead booklet containing modern interviews with the movie's intrepid female stars, outtakes and behind-the-scenes footage, and not one but two audio commentaries for the film, one with writer/director Sam Raimi and producer Robert Tapert and one with legendary star Bruce Campbell.  The Evil Dead is a horror fan's most demented dream come true.",1058659200,3,4863,4.930232558139535

Soon, after getting settled, they check out the basement, where Ash and Scotty find a mystical dagger, the ""Necronomicon ex Mortis"", or book of the dead, and a tape recorder. The recorder is played, with a professor rattling off a incantation that brings an evil spirit to life that possesses Cheryl and destroys the only bridge out of there. As his friends fall victim one by one to the spirit, Ash must find a way to stop the evil once and for all.
A horror movie made on a shoestring budget, most people would label this as garbage, but it's not. It's ENTERTAINING garbage. The performances, especially by Bruce Campbell, are excellent. The gore effects are really stomach-churning: hands being bitten off, melting, stabbings, decomposing, and a decapatation are among them. The video and audio quality are incredible for a movie this old. The extras are packed, inclusding the packaging, which a recreation of the book prop in the movie. The trailer, TV spots, and still gallery are there, with the documentaries DISCOVERING EVIL DEAD, on introducing Europe to Evil Dead, and FANALYSIS, on Bruce Campbell's reaction to fans, being well done. The commentary track is very informative, and the behind the scenes footage is excellent, seeing the cast try those creepy voices without the sound modulator, and the cast acting silly between takes. A collectible and informative booklet is there too. all in all, the so far ULTIMATE edition of thiss cool film.

Elite Entertainment has been sucessful in this DVD edition... There are two great commentaries: one with Bruce Campbell (Main Actor, ""Ashley"") alone, another with Sam Raimi (Director) and Rob Tapert (Producer). They are very informative and fun. There is a Still Gallery featuring more than 150 photos too, awesome pics... The Theatrical Trailer is here too, along with Charpter Selection and a 20-minute ""making-of"". It's not exactly a making-of, but it has behind-the-scenes footage and some alternative takes. The menus are animated too.
The sound in 5.1 is great, no complains at all. It's a full screen edition (no complains too, because my TV is not widescreen, you see..). Unfortunately this edition is not captioned, but it won't make me take out any of those 5-stars.

The movie has lots of violence and gore (that's why it's rated NC-17).
The reason I don't give this edition five stars is by the fact that there are no extras, no booklets, nothing else but the movie. The movie itself is surely a 5-star one...

First all I can say is this is one of the greatest films ever made. All I can say is what in the [heck] was Sam Raimi thinking when he wrote this, if films were still written like this, classics would be in theaters all the time. It was a smart move for Raimi to direct this film because it put him right in the business. This film became an instant cult classic, the underground scene loved it. Of course you have to think right away of Bruce Campbell. This is the man that became famous because of this film; he did an excellent job in this film. I couldn't think of an EVIL DEAD without Bruce. The rest of the cast did great jobs to, Ellen SabdHal Delrich, Betsy Barker, and Sarah York. Of course we have to show some love to the crew working behind the scenes. But finally on to the movie.

This is the DVD edition so I will first go over the special features. The behind the scenes and outtake reels are great, but the best are the commentaries. Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert the producer give an insightful commentary track while Bruce's is hilarious. Now to the film, even though there are more special features. The movie has a group of friends going for a get away in the woods in an old cabin. Once there the friends stumble across the book of the dead, and a recording. They play the recording and awake the dead. The friends fall one by one becoming these creatures all in one night, and when day breaks.......

There is not enough time to go over how much I love this film it is absolutely one of my all time favorite films of all time. This is possibly part of the greatest series in the history of film; this group of friends that made these films are brilliant. All I have left to say is go buy not only this film but the next two in the series, EVIL DEAD 2 and ARMY OF DARKNESS.",1053561600,,1804,4.17816091954023

I heard about it from fans of the other horror films I liked; Night of the living dead, texas chainsaw massacre, etc. They said it was one of the few films which was made up of every element that stuck out in these other pictures and still stood tall to the original source material. In terms of entertainment, the film is a 10+. In terms of filmaking, its a little lower. the film was Raimi's first attempt at a motion picture, and he didn't have a lot to work with. The make up is masterfully implemented by the other worldly camera, a charecter in its own. If you care even slightly about horror, see this and the 2 sequels.",1053475200,,730,4.258992805755396

I was alone, so I rented all three films and sat down with a bottle of Jameson's to watch what I assumed would be back-to-back-toback horror comedies...nothing I couldn't handle, and perfect for a Christmas Eve, no?
What I saw in this film cut my life by at least a few years. From the creepy approach to the cabin, to the first appearance of a deadite (the now-classic ""jack-of spades"" psychic bit), to Ash's ultimate descent into the madness of the moment, I was not only riveted, but horrified constantly.
ED2 and AOD are wonderful, fun, creative movies, to be sure, with lots of suspense amidst the laughs, but this is pure, unadulterated soul-disturbing stuff.  Argento with no budget.  Romero without morality.  In-effing-credible.  Possibly the best horror flick ever.

The setting is a deserted cabin in the woods. For 85 minutes you never leave it...nor do you want to! Don't go into the woods! Whatever you do, don't go into the woods! Of all people, I may not sleep well tonight. This film accomplished what I thought no horror flick could ever do...it scared the %$#( out of me.

Wanna venture deep into the horror genre'? See ""The Evil Dead"" and don't let anyone or anything interrupt you. It's better than any thrill ride I've ever been on. It takes your stomach to the same place. I gave it 5 stars on Amazon.com scale.  It deserves a 6.  Don't rent this.  Buy it!

And that's what makes this DVD so great. There is a whole Bruce Campbell commentary track that is so much more amusing than the movie itself. I can watch that over and over again. (The Sam Raimi/Rob Tapert commentary is interesting, but it's also clear why they are behind the camera.) This DVD also features Bruce's short documentary, ""Fanalysis"" - also great if you are a Bruce fan. (I still think that Evil Dead 2 is better, both the movie and the dvd, but that doesn't mean this one doesn't rock.)
As for the Book of the Dead keepcase, it's creepy in that manufactured kind of way. It's spongy and textured. The pages inside are hilarious. I spent an evening on the sofa with two friends figuring them out and laughed til I hurt.

946300,4,6304953747,"The Evil Dead (Sam Raimi, 1982)

What is it possible to say about Sam Raimi's classic video nasty that has not been said already? If you haven't already heard of The Evil Dead, you've likely been living in a cave for the past twenty years. if you haven't seen it, you've likely been living in Great Britain. But I digress.

The Evil Dead is the most basic of stories (whoops! we let these demons out, see...) shot on the most shoestring of budgets ($150,000, in six weeks), using no-name actors, many of whom were also behind-the-scenes participants. Nothing is ever explained, no reasons for all this occurring are handed us. It just is.

Sound familiar? It ought to. George Romero had done the same thing almost fifteen years before and created a monstrous smash hit on the underground cinema circuit in Night of the Living Dead, to this day the most influential horror film ever made. The Evil Dead followed in Night's tradition, of course, becoming the first of the ""video nasties"" (or so the liner notes in Book of the Dead crow... we'll  just ignore Peeping Tom, banned in 1960,for the moment, shall we?) banned for so long in Britain. (That has since, thankfully, been rectified.)

Another way in which Evil Dead has gone on to imitate night is in the breadth of its influence over film-not just in horror, but in all walks of life. Camera tricks used in The Evil Dead are often replicated today to get the same effects (The Blair Witch Project made use of Evil Dead-style camerawork to nauseating effect, as does the opening of Tornatore's A Pure Formality), the ripped Hills Have Eyes poster in one scene in the Evil Dead sparked a decade-long rivalry between Raimi and Wes Craven (and playing ""spot the ripped poster"" in the films of both is just as amusing as playing ""Spot the Hitchcock""), mini-homages to scenes in The Evil Dead can be found around the map. It has truly become a classic; it did for the popularity of giallo in America what Night of the Living Dead did for the classic horror film.

One other odd similarity between the two: the vast majority of the actors therein never went onto another role. Male lead Bruce Campbell, obviously, not only went on to The Evil Dead II and III, but Darkman, The Adventures of Brisco County Jr., The Hudsucker Proxy, and the Spider-Man franchise, to name only a few. What of the other four main actors? Ellen Sandweiss gets her first role since in 2003 with Satan's Playground, the new flick from the inimitable Dante Tomaselli (Desecration, Horror). Theresa Tilly, who went by the stage name Sarah York in the film, resurfaced again in 1998 as Selma Blair's mother in Debutante. Hal Delrich and Betsy Baker have disappeared off the map.

It's a must-see film by any standards. Hard evidence that, even in the Hollywood-controlled machine, it's possible to take a shoestring budget and an incredibly stupid idea, work outside the gears, and produce one of film's enduring classics. **** ",1048982400,,2949,4.734892787524366

Let me explain myself here, I love letterbox and firmly believe in seeing the whole image. However, this film was shot in 16mm, which means it's aspect ratio is square and fits on television screens as is. So those little black bars are in this case only covering the top and bottom of the image. Why on earth this was done is a mystery to me. Maybe to cater to people with 16:9 televisions? Also the THX people really did effect the look of the film, as the colors are noticeably different from earlier dvds. Now this is fine, there's nothing wrong with that, but I'd venture a guess that the older editions more accurately represent what The Evil Dead was when it first came out. This edition is sort of that as seen through the eyes of a digital telecine colorist technician, which may be better in some people's eyes.

The firts hald-hour is very suspenseful but once the first deadite shows up the pace never slows.  The violence is way over the top, with severed limbs and head, and more blood than any other horror flick aside from Peter Jackson's Dead Alive.
  The directing is absolutley outstanding.  Even in this, his first theatrical film, Sam Raimi proves that he is one of the most talented directors of all time.  This movie is just so visually pleasing it's incredible.  It is staggering how much the camera angles add to the clautrophobic nature of this movie.

The characters inside the book are actually in fancy English letters that thank all of the fans of this horror trilogy!  Also, there is a seperate insert, a little booklet, tucked into the back of the Book of the Dead near where the DVD itself is that chronicles the making of this landmark film.  The DVD itself is awesome also.  Widecreen, good sound, and neat extras including behind the scenes, bloopers, and a documentary by star Bruce Campbell about star Bruce Campbell.  There is also some commentary tracks in there as well.
  What agreat DVD.  It is a little bit expensive, but it is worth ever dime for fans of this film.",1044662400,2,1647,4.474747474747475
946320,5,6304953747,"Well, as far as the actual movie itself the Elite DVD version is superior. I have both the Book Of The Dead Anchor Bay edition and the Elite version. The Anchor Bay version is very nice just for the extras and packaging (even though it smells like model glue!). However, the Elite version presents the movie in it's original 1:33 full-screen aspect ratio, exactly as it was filmed and originally released. The Anchor Bay versions present The Evil Dead in a new 1:85 Widescreen transfer which actually blocks out some of the movie at the top and bottom of the screen. It looks nice, but was it really necessary?
Anchor Bay is by far my favorite DVD company, but they really goofed up on the Widescreen transfer in The Book Of The Dead...they should have included both the new Widescreen and Original full-screen versions.
Oh well, the Elite version has recently went down in price to where if you are a fan of The Evil Dead you can just buy both editions.",1040169600,4,954,4.5523255813953485

Best in the series.",1038960000,2,288,4.0701754385964914
946323,5,6304953747,"Man, I don't care what nobody says, Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' is one of the greatest horror films ever made. No, I'm serious. This is one of the most original and appealing films to come along in all of modern cinema, by far. Will everyone enjoy it? Probably not, but only because not everyone will understand why it's such a masterwork. Some will only look at it superficially as a ridiculous, gratuitously violent horror movie. But, if you are a true lover of film, an' I don't mean stiff-necked over-analytical critic of film, I mean a TRUE LOVER of motion pictures, an' the fun an' magic of sitting down an' losing yourself in a nice slice of pure entertainment, then you SHOULD really love, or at the very least appreciate this.
These young film students that pieced this monstrosity (an' I mean that in a good way) together back in the late '70s clearly had the biggest an' brightest imaginations an' a true love for the magic of the movies. Is it cheesy? Sure. Is it violent? Hell yeah, it is, probably the most violent of the whole trilogy. But, is it a ball to watch? By all means. The establishing shot alone heavily influenced a lotta lesser horror movies in the '80s. Is' a long tracking shot across a dirty, swampy lake, an' through the backwoods toward the main road as our unknowing group of college kids drive toward an isolated cabin in the country where they plan to spend a weekend.
When they arrive, once they've done a quick run-through of the broken-down shack, they discover some strange findings in the cellar; a shotgun, a few medeival-looking knives, and, most importantly, a tape recorder and a rubbery-looking old book, that turns out to be what the whole movie revolves around. As the friends sit up at night an' listen to the unknown doctor on the tape recorder reciting some strange demonic chants, as they flip through the chilling book whose pages are covered in strange lettering an' drawings of devils an' spirits... okay, I know what you're wondering; are these kids really stupid an' careless enough to unlock some otherwordly spirit an' awaken the dead to wreak havoc on the five of them. who are hopelessly stuck in the middle of nowhere? Well, to put it bluntly, YES. What follows is one of the most relentlessly bloody an' violent films I believe I've ever seen. It's like the filmmakers went to painstaking lengths to find out where the most awful an' horrific spot would be to stab people (The acchiles tendon, as Bruce Campbell's commentary points out). I mean, there is some really raw an' shrill moments of gore that actually put even the 'Evil Dead' sequels to shame, including a truly sick an' disturbing sequence involving one'a the girls an' some lively trees, with some very, uhhh, BUSY branches. To make a long story short, one by one each of the kids end up bein' possessed by the demons an' turned into bloodthirsty zombies, except for Bruce Campbell's character, Ash, who'll end up being the lone warrior in the sequels.
I had this movie in its original special edition for a while, but when this limited edition ""Book of the Dead"" came out, there was no way around it, I hadda have it. The rubbery binding of ""human flesh"", the unreadable lettering an' demonic drawings of ancient myths an' devilish spirits, ohhhh man, any fan'a this movie'll eat this up. There's no real making-of featurette, but there is a retrospective with all the producers, as well as some old behind-the-scenes footage on the set, including outtakes. This footage looks like it was dug outta some crates that it'd been in for the past twenty years or so. I was also surprised to see TV spots, not only because it was such a low-budget movie, but also because of the limited release it received, cause'a the graphic nature an' the fact that it was unrated. The two commentaries are fun to listen to, mostly 'cause these guys're so snide an' sarcastic about their movie, especially Bruce Campbell (""I'll be quiet, cause, uhh, we wanna hear this dialogue"").
To be honest with you, these aren't the kind of movies that are a whole lotta fun to watch by yourself, so here's what you do, or at least here's what I do: First I getta bunch'a my homeboys to come over some night, then I throw a few fine females into the mix too, preferrably some trill ones so maybe they'd enjoy the flick too, I try an' plan it around some dark an' rainy weather, then I break out the liquor, sit back, an' jus' enjoy the weird satanic chants, demonic zombies, and the gallons an' gallons'a blood that's shed.  Thas' all there is to it, y'all.",1036368000,10,4548,4.628712871287129

946325,4,6304953747,"This movie is wonderful.  Very scary (considering it was made in '83) and very gory.  But the gory is VERY VERY cheesy.  So much to the point where its not scary or disgusting. You see two people decompose but its not that nasty because it looks just like clay.  The movie leaves lots of ground to be paradied (Evil Dead II).  A tree voilates a girl by raping her; give me a break.  This movie is very graphic but its not too much.  My grandmother could watch this and still feel ok.  But that doesnt stop it from being a horror classic.  Bruce Campbell is awesome as Ash.  He makes this movie worth the $5 rental fee.
Note - The movie is rated NC-17 but seriously its not that gory.  I mean lots of blood and yea you see this girls tendon ripped out but i mean it looks SO FAKE!  Its really a joke i guess.  Dont let the rating discourage you from buying this because its really not bad.",1036195200,,888,4.12280701754386
946326,4,6304953747,"This movie is probably one of the most well known and obsessed over horror films of the century. The actor Bruce Campbell is practically a living legend to most horror crazed movie buffs. Personally I think he is a great actor but does a lot better in comedy roles like in ""Amy of Darkness."" I've always liked all Sam Raimi's films but honestly never took the time to watch ""The Evil Dead"" until a few weeks ago. I started the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy backwards with ""Army of Darkness"" and flat out loved it. Pure fun and action for any movie fan. Next I saw ""Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn"" and really laughed by a** off. I thought ""Well if the last two were so great the Original has to be the best!"" Well, I was sort of right...
I began watching ""The Evil Dead"" and thought it was running pretty well. Very stylish camera angles, good music by Joe Lo Duca and a great setting. The movie was fine for me until it came to the infamous tree branch scene. I was literally shocked to see how far the scene was taken and really lost allot of respect for the film. Don't get me wrong, I love movies with blood and explosions but that scene just steps too far and ruins the whole thing for me. The scene is duplicated in ""Evil Dead II"" in a much better and settling way. That is really the only problem I have with this film. I am not easily rattled by movies but that scene really surprised me. Other than that, the movie is great and once the horror really starts, it never stops. This movie is Not exactly jump out of your chair scary but more like ultra gory horror that makes your jaw drop. It is easy to see why this film is hailed so much by total horror freaks and buffs.
To sum things up, this is not your average horror film. It offers more style and edge than you usually see in horror movies. Bruce Campbell is great in his role as Ash and later gets to really show off and be funny with ""Evil Dead II"" & ""Army of Darkness."" For all you horror crazed, violence addicted psychos out there this is the movie for you. Still, if you are interested in becoming a filmmaker, like me, you may like this just to see how a bunch of college filmmakers can really pull something off.

946327,5,6304953747,"""The Book of the Dead"" should find it's way into every home in America 'nuff said.  Why do I make such a bold statement?  Is it because ""The Evil Dead"" is perhaps the largest cult phenomena movie ever made with the possible exeption of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show?"" Is it because of all the versians of this movie ever released (15+) this is by far the greatest in terms of  quality and bonus features?  Because the widescreen anamorphic picure and newly remastered soundtrack are superior over any previous attempts?  Or is it simply because the packaging is so friggin' COOL!?!?!  Whatever the reason, this debut for the talented director Sam Raimi and the high spirited dynamic screen presence that is Bruce Campbell is simply a wonder to behold.  Now, just to clarify something once and for all, ""The Evil Dead"" is NOT for all tastes, and features some extremely gory shots that may leave you a bit uneasy after eating a cup of yogurt or other soft substance of pus-like consistancy.  And you may want to send the kids out of the room during the scene when the woman is attacked... by trees(you'll see). But it is what it is,whether it be a great movie of classic stature, a gorgeous new widescreen transfer, glorious remastered sound, hefty extras, or the greatest packaging ever made for a DVD, this is just a must own in EVERY way!!!",1035072000,3,1343,4.637130801687764
946328,4,6304953747,"Having seen (and owned) ""Evil Dead"" in many different forms, it is nice to finally get an all-inclusive version. Anchor Bay is notorious for lousy video transfers (the VHS version of Halloween), but this one is surprisingly good. This neat little ""Book of the Dead"" is a great collectible, assuming you have the cash for it.
Rather than give a plot synopsis (if you are reading this, chances are youve seen the movie many times), I will say that this is the only real ""Horror"" movie in the Evil Dead Trilogy. While ""Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn"" and the later ""Army of Darkness"" were more comedy than horror, the first installment is a strait-forward horror outing. What sets it apart from other 80s horror movies is Sam Raimis stylish direction and Tom Sullivans extremely gross special effects. ""Evil Dead"" is perhaps the goriest of all the 1980s horror flicks, with blood, guts, and body parts flying everywhere. But it is done in such a way as to make it a stylish horror movie, not a snuff film like a lot of early 80s ""Video Nasties"".
Anchor Bay gave us quite a package with this edition, so fans of the series can rejoice. Included are no less than 2 documentaries, one by Bruce Campbell himself called ""Fanalysis"", which give an insight into the world of fandom as seen at conventions. Campbell makes a piece similar to that is ""Trekkies"", showing all types, and all degrees, of fans. The ""Evil. Dead"" fans, by the looks of things, are the most civilized out of the bunch. The second documentary is called ""Discovering Evil Dead"", which has interviews with two early proprietors of home video who discovered ""Evil Dead"", and were responsible for getting it released to the general public. Also included are the outtakes, bios, trailers, and other supplements.
The quality of the movie itself it nice, even though I have heard people complain about the ""matted"" widescreen. The only other prints I have to compare it to are the Thorn EMI release from the early 80s, and Anchor Bays abysmal re-release that I bought in 1998. The image is clear, but a bit grainy in parts. This is to be expected in a print as old as this, and especially in low-budget movies, also like this. I have always loved ""Evil Dead"", and am happy that I now own it on DVD
My biggest complaint is the price tag, which is steep no matter how you look at it. This costs as much as some DVD box sets, and considering the extras, this is still only 1 DVD with a fancy book included. If you are a diehard fan of the series, and want to own a ""Deluxe, Limited Edition"" print of this movie, than this is definitely the thing for you. If you are indifferent to the extras and just want a good quality print with perhaps a few supplements, than the other editions are a better bet.",1034467200,,2748,4.520080321285141
946329,5,6304953747,"This movie is surely the best ever made, in my opinion. It's scary, gore... This movie will never be forgotten, because it's different from everything. Even its sequels don't get near it. Yes, I'm talking about The Evil Dead....
In this DVD, there are many extras, the best ones. There are exclusive extras, such as a documentary by Bruce Campbell (the actor who plays Ash, the main character in the trilogy), called Fanalysis. It's not an Evil Dead-only documentary, it tells things about fans, who they are, how far can they go. So the documentary shows many fans (from Star Wars, Star Trek, Xena...) in conventions... There's a participation of Sam Raimi's brother, Ted Raimi in this documentary also. The best documentary in my opinion is ""Discovering the Evil Dead"", because it tells the history about the movie, it tells things about how the censorship was, how it was released... You MUST see this documentary!
There are Commentaries (well, they are the same from the Elite Entertainment edition DVD) of Bruce Campbell and another one with Rob Tapert (the producer) and Sam Raimi (the director). There are some rare behind-the-scenes footage (same from Elite Entertainment DVD), many pictures (not only from Elite Entertainment DVD), TV trailers, the trailer, bios of Bruce Campbell, Rob Tapert, Sam Raimi. It's a widescreen version (Evil Dead was never released in Widescreen format, until this DVD), it's closed-captioned. And there are much more extras.
Wait, this is the DVD, I didn't say anything about the awesome package yet. Well, I would buy this edition even without the DVD, because the book is really worthy. It's almost the same Necronomicon (Book Of The Dead) that appears in the movie. There are some pages of the book in the movie which doesn't appear in the DVD Necronomicon. And there's also some difference between them, because in the movie, you can't read what is written in the pages, but in the DVD Necronomicon, you can! And it's not hard! The book has the same drawings from the movie, and there's a GREAT booklet in the book, also...
There are really no words to describe it. PLUS, a few years from now, it will be really hard to find, so it will be really expensive. But don't worry about it. You won't even think about selling yours.",1033257600,2,2268,4.847938144329897

But please keep in mind, the producers did it all without computers and that's what makes this film so special.  It's far from scary now though, but will give you the best laugh.  I was in hysterics, and it's nice to see it again after many, many years.  What's annoying about this movie's release to DVD is that there are different versions of the DVD floating around!  I've got the 'Exclusive Widescreen edition', but be warned, it's not true widescreen (it originally wasn't even filmed in widescreen)so they've 'doctored' it, as such, to get away with it.

The cover is beatifull and the artwork inside is very simmilar to that of the 'real' necronomicon. The only remark I have is that the prologue page should maybe be in the back of the book or in the included booklet, because..... well It breaks the magic a bit when you over the book.
The DVD is super! Very nice menu's, all is a feast for eye. The extra's are good. I highly recommend the Commentary version by Bruce Campbell, I thought it was hilarious. So just buy the ... thing.

946406,5,6304953747,"INTRO:  Evil Dead was/and still is one of the most fun you'll ever have watching a horror movie.  This is also Sam Raimi's (director of the new Spider-man movie) first movie he directed professionally...well, he did Super 8 movies...do those count?  Also, this is the first major movie Bruce Campbell (Brisco Country Jr, Serving Sara) performed in.  If you don't know the series by now, this is the first of the Evil Dead series, and one of the best as well.  As the series progresses, you'll notice that it becomes more slapstick, but this one is shere horror at its best.  From monsters being locked in the basement, to blood gushing out of every fixture in the house, this is a must for any horror fan.
PLOT:  Well, it is your typical ""kids go out alone in the woods only to be attacked by monsters"" bit.  Except this movie lets the gore come through in full swing.  Of course the special effects are outdated (stop motion animation, rubber legs being stabbed) but its still better than even today's best horror movies.  I won't spoil much more, so see it for yourself.
DVD:  This DVD should get the ""DVD-of-the-Year"" award.  Sculpted by Tom Sullivan (the man who did various props and special effects for all three movies), this DVD case looks like the Book of the Dead used in the movie pretty good.  There are even pages within the book that are replicas of the movie's...bet you didn't think they would make a DVD case like that eh?  Its got a rubbery feel that is different from the typical cardboard, plastic, tin casing that you see so abundant today.  Really refreshing!  Also, the DVD itself isn't half-bad either.  The menus are remarkable and pretty cool.  The extras I will explain below.
EXTRAS:  I would rank the extras alone with a 5/5 stars mainly because there is so much to look at.  There are two screens of movies and short trailers to watch as well as multiple featurettes.  I can't believe how well-done this DVD is.  Also, a featurette describing actor Bruce Campbell himself is included.  Its VERY entertaining if you are a Bruce Campbell fan as am I.
AUDIO:  The audio has been restored to excellent quality.  Its hard to believe this movie was once a poor 16mm movie with bad audio.  Its just amazing as you watch it that you get lost in it and forget its flaws.
VIDEO:  The video as well has been restored to clean, crispness as it should be.  Originally a dark and grainy movie, now a detailed and texturized video transfer is what this classic horror movie deserves.  If you saw the original version in theater, you would probably cry at the difference.
OVERALL:  Overall, I think you know what I've been implying the entire time.  But don't settle for the basic DVD version, you HAVE to get this version.  $30-$40 for a prop replica created by the same guy who did the props, plus the DVD itself with hours of extras is an EXTREMELY great buy.

946409,4,6304953747,"""The Evil Dead,"" director Sam Raimi's debut, is both astonishingly wicked and divinely silly. The plot of the movie is not something completely different than a lot of horror films out there, but the difference is that this film came out before a lot the copycats, hence becoming one of the most influential horror films of all time.
The plot: A group of friends head into the woods to spend a weekend at a cabin. (Simple enough, right?) 2 of the group find a tape in the basement of the cabin and play it, only to release demons and all kinds of madness unto themselves.
The amazing thing about this film is the small budget they had to work with. (And don't get me wrong, it shows at times), but the film holds it's own none-the-less, and delivers superior chills and gore. Especially for the year of it's release. The gore/makeup is what really steals the show in this film. Some really good gore effects make for a very entertaining and gross movie. The acting is very good, especially on the part of Bruce Campbell (The film's lead) who really shines through as the lovable but goofy hero, Ash. Take these things and factor in some experimental camera work and an eerie soundtrack and you have a very entertaining horror film.
The reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is due to the fact that you can see the outrageously small budget at times. Also, 1 or 2 of the supporting cast is a little lackluster.
A very annoying thing about this movie is the fact that it has been re-released a bizillion times. If you buy this film, chances are, in a few months, another SE will come out. I saw the Evil Dead: Collector's Edition. The film looks good for it's age and budget and the audio is good, but could be better. The extras are ok. There is a commentary with Bruce Campbell that is very funny.
If you're a fan of cheesy horror or gore in general, and you haven't seen this film...Then this is a must have for you. People who don't like the site of blood and dismembered demons, Beware! Cuz there is plenty of that.

Other than that, everyone should see this movie at least once to prove that Bruce Campell was capable something better than ""Jack of all trades""  and to see how much blood really can come out of a demon!",1029110400,,701,4.065217391304348
946461,5,6304953747,"One things for sure, the closing credits have it right ""The Ultimate Experience In Gruelling Terror""
I'm not one to be easily scared by a horror film (or any other film unless Kevin Costner is in it)so if I didn't fully appreciate the terrifying parts of this movie please excuse me.
What I will say is that Evil Dead is the closest anything has come to giving me goosebumps.  Its not the effects, they're cheap (though extremely well done for the budget) and its not that I have a particular fear of Zombies, but the atmosphere in this film is incredible.
For the most part shot in one location (or rather the story takes place in a single location - a remote cabin) it builds upon everyones natural suspicion of the woods and it uses that to creep you out to great effect.  Using subtle but creepy shots like the blackening of the moon, growls from the woods as it comes alive and an unseen force speeds towards the cabin and the young teens trapped there, the subtlety of the music to build tension, the overall darkness of the movie, and the way it doesnt rush into the next make up effect.
Thats not to say it isn't gory, gorehounds will have a great time with this movie, but you can also appreciate how the tension is built to almost breaking point, where your on the edge of your seat waiting and genuinly afraid of what your waiting for.  Its unsettling and plays on the mind that way, in a way the Blair Witch tried but failed (for me at least) to emulate.
Because of this unbearable tension, natural fear and the way the movie is shot it serves to bring to the screen one of the scariest, under-rated pieces of film making genius and without a doubt one of the best movies of the horror genre
Ignore the cheesy acting (Bruce Campbell is awesome cheesy or not) and low budget effects and instead let yourself become engrossed in the book of the dead and the evil ""within the woods""
A Cult classic and so it deserves to be.
The DVD transfer on the special edition is good, its as crisp and as clean as a movie shot on this budget can be, the soundtrack is extremely well transfered to digital 5.1 and the audio tracks are excellent - not one but two!!! Bruce Campbells especially is very fresh and funny and worth the price of the DVD alone.  An excellent addition to a collection, and a worthy buy if you find the Book Of The Dead limited edition price a little steep.

The  characters  are  thin  to  say  at  the  least  and  the  main  character  Ash  is  just  plain  overrated.  I  have  heard  the  sequels  are  better  than  this  one,  but  I  won't  take  my  chances  since  this  one  bombed  so  horrifically.

946513,5,6304953747,"Sam Raimi's crafted one of the finest horror films of all time with the original Evil Dead, which became a landmark film for the horror genre.  First off you can tell the film is low budget, but that didn't stop Raimi from crafting a wild, shocking, well rounded movie that created an entire cult legacy.  In case you don't know the story by now, five college students go on vacation at an abandoned cabin, only to find the Necronomicon and inadvertantly release some very evil spirits that takes over each person one by one until only our reluctant hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) is left.  What follows is a wildly entertaining horror thrillride that pulls out as many stops as Raimi can handle behind the helm with the claustrophobic, eerie atmosphere of the cabin and the surrounding, living forest, and some greatly disorienting and dizzying camera angles.  The makeup effects team used the small budget as best they could to create some great blood and gore effects (I still can't get the image of one of the girls knawing her hand off), and Bruce Campbell is equally great in his defining role, although he would not be the slapstick ridden hapless hero of the later films Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness.  All in all, if you want to watch a real horror movie thats budget didn't strap its' imagination, then there isn't a better time then now to get this new special edition of Evil Dead.  Plus, the Book of the Dead casing is fantasticly designed.",1024531200,3,1451,4.626459143968872

946515,5,6304953747,"This movie is just one of kind, great fun, very bloody. Not necessarilly really gory, I always look at gore to be maybe alot of decapitation and showing guts, however this movie had some of that but not enough to think of this as the goriest movie ever. But it is one of the bloodiest and wildest. Story of course involves some college students going up to a somewhat abandon cabin and the evil starts from there and how they unleash it, you must see for yourself.
The acting was well ok, however Bruce Campbell himself did awesome, I think he is a great highly underrated actor. This movie is very scary, or exciting if you will as it is also very funny sometimes, like when the possessed women say funny statements like (kill her if you can loverboy, and Were gonna get you not another peep, its just so corny yet funny.) Gets you back to enjoying the movie instead of wanting to get grossed out or terrified.
The work on the demons or zombies, though they didn't seem like major flesh eaters, just demons in human form are quite excellent, the rough sketching and so on. Anyone that doesnt like this film, in my opinion, you just shouldnt like horror in general because this is a damn straight horror classic and will stay that way. If you like entertaining, keep you guessing type of horror movies then see evil dead. I love the whole series, but the first one is more of a major horror movie then the others, however they are all outstanding. Dont be fooled by the ending, there is more of that too come. Also I think I figured out why Evil dead 2's storyline was so similar to this one, find out my theory on my Evil dead 2 review.

946516,5,6304953747,"They're dead.  And they're evil.  They're evil dead.  Pretty well says it all.
Bruce Campbell and friends spend a weekend in an out-of-the-way backwoods cabin, where they discover strange artifacts, a black magic grimoire, and a tape-recording by an anthropologist afraid of what he's found.  The anthropologist reads chants from the book onto the tape...and all hell breaks loose.
This is the movie Night of the Living Dead wanted to be, and wasn't.  It's the ultimate zombie picture.  Its low-key, low-budget approach works brilliantly.  The suspense has never been bettered, and never lets up.  The film starts out very slowly and quietly, building to fever pitch, and when it jumps out and says ""boo,"" it does so to great effect.  It also manages to engage the emotions in ways you wouldn't expect.  Despite the fact that you know it's a movie, it still leaves you feeling terrified and wrung-out, long before the ambiguously unsettling finale.  In addition to the really gruesome decomposition effects, there's an incredible scene in which one of the young women at the cabin is high-speed tracked through the woods, to be overtaken and raped by...a tree.
Not for the squeamish, but definitely for zombie-film lovers, and those that enjoy really nail-biting, grimacing horror.",1023580800,2,1281,5.140096618357488
946517,5,6304953747,"There's a whole world out there in the ultra-low budget horror movies, specially those made in the 1970's, before the MTV era. Sam Raimi's 'The Evil Dead' is a clear example. If you are one of those people who make this movie an all-time cult favorite (I know I am) this edition will be very good, second only to the Special Book-of-the-Dead Edition.
The picture and sound quality is excellent, the best I've ever seen in an Evil Dead DVD. Any imperfection you may find is justified (remember, this is a 1970's ultra-low budget), but what really makes this edition a worthy buy is the features. Both commentaries are great, and the one with Bruce Campbell is not to be missed, since is full of funny anecdotes and facts about the production of the film (actually, he never stops talking). In fact, both commentaries are a master class in film-making inventive. The deleted scenes are very good too, presented in a rough cut, but they're shown in a carrousel, so you can't access them individually. As for the picture gallery, it's very original, since it gives you not only images from the movie (like most DVD's do), but also pictures that were took from the premiere, and some nice material on the original posters. Definitely, the only flaw I can see in this edition is that, once again, we are left with no closed-captioned or subtitles of any kind, and that's a big no-no in my book.

It's easier to pick apart the cheesy acting and hokey dialogue and situations now, since I'm not 13 anymore. I think the other 2 movies in the Dead Trilogy are much better movies, more polished and professional, but the enthusiasm with which the film was made shines through, so it's hard NOT to get caught up in the spirit.........
  Director Sam Raimi has since gone on to become the closest thing Hollywood has to a renaissance man, directing virtually every genre of film: Western (The Quick & The Dead), Romance/Sports (For The Love Of The Game), Suspense (The Gift & A Simple Plan), and Superhero/Action (Darkman & now the eagerly awaited Spider-Man), but it all started here, with the small story of a group of friends in an isolated cabin who accidentally resurrect an ancient demonic force. The film is a non-stop thrill-ride, with the gore gushing freely throughout. The weak of Heart need not apply....
 The idea to package the disc in a ""Book of the Dead"" case is pure genius, and the case alone is worth the price. The disc itself is great; Chock full of extras, plenty of Easter eggs, 2 commentary tracks, both of which are hilarious AND informative, Galleries of art, photos, and promotional and advertising material, and a few GREAT documentaries.

It's not just you'r typical ""lets go into the woods to fool around"" movie  Now Raimi would make two more of these films, Evil Dead 2 and Army Of Darkness, but both of those films went for camp and not so much horror, both were very good films but this one remains a real diamond.

Not long after arriving at the cabin, darkness falls and strange noises are heard outside and under the cabin. The group stumbles upon an old reel to reel tape recorder and a strange looking book that looks like a shriveled face. After listening to the tape they learn that the book is an ancient Book of the Dead and contains enchanments to raise evil spirits that can possess people. The only way to kill one of the possessed is by dismemberment. One of the guys listens to the tape a little too long and strange words are chanted. The spirits are waken and the group finds themselves in a fight for their lives.

EVIL DEAD reminded me of THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and there are a lot of similarities. Both films were shot on a shoestring budget. Both films' directors when on to bigger pictures. Both films involve creatures rising from the dead, killing humans, and having the aforemention killees come back to life. About the only major differences between the two films are that: NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is in black and white; EVIL DEAD is much more gorier than NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD; EVIL DEAD isn't a social parable about the state of society; and one person survives in EVIL DEAD and surprisingly becomes a hero.

I could see how this film could scare people. However, I didn't find this film as frightening as I thought, though it was often suspenseful. In between the times of action and suspense, the movie moved slower than a snail. Though the movie runs a little less than ninety mintues, it could have been cut in a few places and have had a more steady pace. Of course the stop and go pace of the film reflects the shakycam technique used in much of the picture, so maybe Sam Raimi wanted it that way. The story is rather simplistic, but it works. Bruce Campbell is a joy to watch as Ash and the transformation of Ash from a whiny wimp into a tough guy hero, parrallels the acting acting career of Campbell himself.

Over all, a rather gory and sometimes frightening film that you probably wouldn't want to watch alone. It has become a horror cult favorite and introduced some new movie making techniques to the general populous in a way that works well.",1018224000,,2324,4.48936170212766
946622,5,6304953747,"Now this is what a DVD should be! A very low budget movie that outgrew its budget and expectations.
First of all it is a truly scary and at times downright creepy movie. Added to that you have a lot of comedy in the mix. Could you ask for a better combination in a movie? A bit of wooden acting from a small, inexperienced cast is certainly passable and can be easily overlooked because of the very tight direction from new director, Sam Raimi.
The over-the-top gore can have two effects on the viewer: absolute turn-off or outright laughter. Raimi mixes the gore so well with the bits of comedy and tension that it is effective in both. A combination that in a movie with any other director might not work.
The behind-the-scenes footage on this DVD shows a lot of people having a good time. This translates to the screen. The DVD is not dressed up with repetitive extras, just the bare necessities that illustrate the amount of passion that went into this cult classic.",1018051200,2,970,4.517045454545454

It was weird I know. But when they released this dvd w/the book of the dead I figured since everyone raves about it, I'll buy it and watch it again. When I saw it again, I'll tell you, I was blown away, it was a great movie. The effects were great and it still scared ...me. This is my all time favorite horror flick. I recommend this movie set, which is limited edition, to anyone.  Especially if you want to get scared out of your life! It's a 5 out of 5!

This DVD is crystal clear and has many extras. Extras include commentary by Bruce Campbell in which he describes his character and how they did some of the special effects. The cover is also awesome it's the coolest cover I've ever seen. Even my friends, who are not fans of this movie thought the cover was cool.
As for the movie. It does not contain a strong story, however great special effects and some good ol blood and gore make up for that. 5 young people go to relax in a secluded cabin in the mountains of Tennessee. When they discover a tape recorder in the basement they are curious to see what is on the tape. Also in the basement they find Necronomicon (Book of the Dead). Upon playing this tape they release the evil dead and all hell breaks loose. Bruce Campbell(Ash) turns from a quivering wimp into the hero.
Evil Dead was very controversial upon it's release. Still to this day it is one of my favorites and worthy of anyone's horror collection. It's a pure classic.",1017705600,8,1145,4.330232558139535

946678,4,6304953747,"I know everyone reading this is probably already familiar with the movie, so I won't go into the movie here - just comment on the extras & commentary tracks.
I saw Bruce Campbell when he spoke at Mount Holyoke College on his book tour, and that tour included a screening of his documentary 'Fanalysis', which is included here.  I loved 'Fanalysis' (and I think I may have recognised some of the folks involved in it...), it reminded me so vividly of my time on the SF/Fantasy convention circuit.  Well worth seeing.
The outtakes are pretty straightforward, nothing really funny or hugely gross in comparison with the movie per se (aside from some really funny scenes in which the effects just weren't working at all).
Trailers and TV spots are also pretty straightforward.
'Discovering Evil Dead' is ok, I guess, but not quite as interesting as I'd hoped.
The commentary tracks, though, are where this one shines - specifically Bruce's solo commentary track.  The commentary track from Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert is a little annoying - they're poorly miked, or not aware enough of the mikes, and the track is overflowing with distracting and somewhat gross noises - lips smacking, small grunting and swallowing noises, and what sounds like sucking on hard candy, among other weird sounds, and they keep talking about the financial side of the movie, 'was this your idea or mine?', and how Bruce is probably complaining about this or that on his track, and they're just, frankly, somewhat boring and kinda glah.
Bruce's commentary track, on the other hand, glows.  Bruce is really *real* on the track - informative, witty, somewhat self-deprecating - overall, possibly my favourite part of the DVD.
I keep reading other reviews, many of which mention 'Within the Woods' being on this disc - if it's there, I can't find it (a shame, cos I'd love to see it).  All the same, in conjunction with my newly-bought Official Bootleg Edition of 'Army of Darkness', I foresee a lot of great late-night viewing in my future...",1017014400,,2012,4.854227405247814

The film opens with five collage students driving to an old cabin deeb in the woods. The night they get there they find an old book and a recorder with something on it. They listen to the recording and a lot of freaky stuff starts to happen. And one by one the students start to turn into  zombies.  Bruce Cambell leads the cast as Ash.

946682,4,6304953747,"Don't get me wrong -- I'm a total Evil Deadhed all the way through. I was just disappointed in the features that should have been a bang-zoom kind of explosion that ended up being some type of Roman candles. Okay, but not what I was expecting.
First the good -- the cover is excellent. Kind of this squishy latex foam (stinky) cover to simulate human skin -- it's also chock full of Tom Sullivan's drawing. Artistically, pretty cool but not great to stack with your DVDs.
FANanalysis, the documentary by Bruce Campbell was great. Bruce takes Evil DeadHeads behind the scenes at conventions and offers an intimate portrayal of himself interacting. Although it was very short (23 minutes) I thoroughly enjoyed watching this little gem of an addition to this DVD. A must-see.
The sound and picture of the Evil Dead is outstanding. Considering this was a cheaply made film, MAN did they clean everything up and clarify all the details of the movie. Probably the best I've seen.
Plus, there are some Easter Eggs in this DVD. At main menu:
Egg 1: go to EXTRAS highlight ""trailer"" > arrow left that should highlight a fish, click it (this will play a screen test for the animation of one of the zombies)
Egg 2: at EXTRAS click ""more"" highlight ""fanalysis"" > arrow left
that will highlight a skull, click it (this features a short film of a discussion of Evil Dead. Robert Tapert and the actresses who play Linda and Shelly discuss a little about what went on during the filming. Robert briefly mentions his wife <who is the actress who plays Xena for those of you who didn't know> Also talks a bit about their next film collaboration that could be the 4th Evil Dead)
Now, the not-so-great. Well, unfortunately, the prequel ""Within the Woods"" was apparently pulled by some yahoo guy at the last minute at Columbia. Why, we don't know but I know a number of fans were really ticked about this. Don't despair! Surf the web and you'll find ways of getting a bootleg --albeit a crappy copy, but it's out there. And you have GOT to see it -- you will see all the inspiration for Evil Dead including the parts that ended up transferring over to the next two flicks.
The commentary was cut into two sections: Bruce by himself and Rob Tapert and Sam Raimi on the other. If you have the Evil Dead 2 special edition, you'd appreciate the commentary for the way they kid each other. Bruce is great with technical details but I think they should have had him comment with Sam and Rob. Sam has a tendency to get into his flicks and go quiet so there were long pauses despite the fact Rob was with him. They should have had the three of them together for one commentary as it is too much fun listening to them all kid each other and laugh about how they pulled Evil Dead off. At one point, Rob questions why they separated them for the commentaries (which tells me it wasn't their idea) and I missed their friendly bantering.
The outtakes section was interesting, but boring. I got the impression it was them messing up and laughing, but alas, it was merely unused takes and footage. Not bad, but probably interesting for die-hard fans only.
Overall, it's a good DVD, but incomplete. I get the impression that ""Within the Woods"" is thought of by the studios as a money-maker which might be why they pulled it at the last second. If this is apparent, then hopefully the hesitant studios will realize that the Dead series is a money maker and offer the funds for a new flick.

The Book is great for all fans out there, it has some blank pages so you can get your autographs there.

At first the gore and killing of the monsters is pretty crazy and entertaining but it soons becomes stale and repetitive after 82 minutes of the same wackiness.

946716,4,6304953747,"That's what a previous reviewer called this film. I strongly disagree. It seems to me that he failed to realise that this film wasn't intented to be a dark comedy. It's a horror movie. And the purpose of a horror move is to scare and shock us (which this flick does quite well). Not to make us laugh. He went on to compare this film to porn. How can you compare the two??? Unlike porn in which the sex is pretty much real, the violence and gore in this film is SIMULATED. I've seen this movie a few times and of course the first time it scared the hell out of me! But during repeated viewings one cannot help but laugh at the bad acting and the cheesy (though gruesome) effects. It's not seeing a person getting mutilated that gets a chuckle out of me, it's the hokeyness of it! Anyways, I'm through venting.
  This is probably my least favorite of the ED trilogy but when I saw a picture of this collectible edition I had to get it! The same illustrated pages within the Necronomicon in the film can be found in the cover! (I'm still having a hard time deciphering the text) There's also a nifty little booklet included. Of course there are alot of extra goodies within the DVD itself with a couple of hidden surprises! My favorite was the 'Fanalysis' feature with Bruce Campbell himself. There's only 2 small problems however. On the inside back cover of the book the DVD is enclosed in a tight plastic sleeve. It's a struggle to get the disc out without scratching it up. Unlike the actual Necronomicon in the movie this edition isn't made of human flesh but judging from the way it smells you'd think it was. It stank up my whole room the evening I brought it home!

Video is so clean you'd think the movie was filmed and transfered to DVD digitally. (I'm not an audiophile, I'm sure some of you will notice stuff, but considering prints of this video in the past, trust me when I say this disc is really nice.)
Sound track was remixed into a ""stunning"" DTS-ES sound track (That's that new Dolby Digital 6.1 with the extra rear center track) and is quite delightful to listen too.

The outer casing of the book is amazing..very soft like styrophone, great detail and craftsmenship...your hands will shake when you first touch it.  The DVD is hidden on the last page of the book with a mini book about the genesis of the film located just before it.  I found the mini booklet very informative (and you will too!).  The DVD itself conatains all the extra features from the original Special Edition DVD released by Elite Entertainment: The Behind the Scenes Footage & Outakes are the same.  Both audio commentaries are identical to that release.  The Still Frame Gallery is different from the first release with many new & different pictures given (a reason to keep your Elite version if you're a collector).  You have to check out ""Fanalysis"" a short documentary starring and directed by the great Bruce Campbell himself, which focuses on the fans of Evil Dead as well as Campbells own experiences at Sci-fi conventions and his devotion to his many admireres.  The other ""making of"", entitled ""Discovering Evil Dead"" is far less interesting simply because Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, & Ted Raimi are not included in the featurette.  The theatrical trailer is also released in Widescreen and you even get some TV Spots as well which is rare.  The other big bonus is the film has DTS sound for the very first time and it sounds fantastic!  You can expect future DTS releases for Evil Dead 2 & Army of Darkness sometime soon.  If we're lucky, maybe each film will be encased in its own Book of the Dead...or at least a Boxed Set, right Anchor Bay?!
On a personal note, the first time I viewed this film, I dared it to scare me, so I watched it by myself at midnight with no lights on and the sound way up on my VCR (many years ago this was).  HUGE MISTAKE!!  I couldn't sleep the next few days and had nightmares of deadites screaming ""JOIN US!!!!"" at me.  Truly one of the scariest movies ever made!

Anchor Bay has done an excellent job on all the re-issues of the Evil Dead series, and this is probably the best I've seen from them yet. I had a VHS copy of Evil Dead for some time, and the quality was just horrible. Needless to say, after a few years, I'd gotten used to it. When I put this in my DVD player, I was simply blown away by the picture clarity it had. For once, Evil Dead actualy -looked- like the low-budget masterpeice it truly is. The audio is equally improved, and 5.1 mixed to boot.
What really makes this the coolest DVD around is the packaging. It's not one of those standard hard plastic snap cases, with graphics on it. It's an actual replica of the Book of the Dead from Evil Dead 1, with an intro by Tom Sullivan! It also comes with a booklet INSIDE the Necronomicon, following the release history of Evil Dead on video, DVD, and Laserdisc. It's a special feature in and of itself.
There are two seperate audio commentary tracks, one featuring Sam Raimi and Rob Tappert, and one with Ash himself, Bruce Campbell. The only real soft point of this DVD is the commentary. The tracks are informative, and funny as always, but just not as entertaining as the Evil Dead II commentary. That being said, the EDII commentary track is the best I've ever heard, so it's a tough act to follow up.

  This is just the coolest thing I've seen in a while! I wish more DVD's would go the extra mile the way they did with this one! I must admit, when I first saw this DVD in person I was a bit disappointed because I thought it was supposed to be much bigger, and was worried it would be around regular DVD size. Problem was I was thinking of the way the book was presented in Army of Darkness, I had forgotten that in Evil Dead, it IS around DVD size. Anyways, realizing this upon viewing the movie again, I was quite happy. The case is outstanding! You can see that by the pic. Inside are the actual pages of the Necronomicon, as seen in the trilogy, and the cool thing is that the text CAN be read if you concentrate! There are hidden little phrases throughout, such as ""Make movies, not war!"" 10 stars for the case alone baby! As for the disc, another winner!

This is a sick film, designed to be such... to gross-out and create fear... not humor.  The problem with the movie is that it appears to have been made sadistically.  Rather than just show gore, the camera focuses on the violence longer than needed, as if this was pornography---indeed, this appears to be a motion picture for those who wish to be stimulated not by sex, but by suffering.
There seems to be two types of reaction to the film--disgust and fear (normal people); humor and pleasure (people with a blood lust).
The film received an ""X"" rating but withdrew this.  Later, in 1994, the MPAA awared it an ""NC-17"".  It well earns this rating.  A film enjoyed by psychopathic minds.",1015286400,6,848,4.62

946781,5,6304953747,"After just a half an hour of watching The Evil Dead I was blown' away at what a great and notable job the collage studnts that made this groudbraker as good as they did, and scary too.
As a matter of facted I think reson that The Evil Dead was created so skillfuly buy kids not much older than my 15 year old self, is reson enough to call this cult classic the best( if not one of the best) horror films ever created, just like what almost everyone ealse thinks, even though it takes bits and peaces out other classics like House on Hunted Hill, (the overly long) Night of the Dead seires and my personal favorite The Exoricist.
The story begins with a five collage bubbies going up to the hills for the weaked just to have some fun, but what they get instead is the satanic Book of the Dead wich is an old book put together by human flesh and writen in blood, and it opens the doors to another world I don't anyone would like to spend much time. One by one the kids die in very, very, very bloody ways. That is the reson why even if your expecting alot of gore it might be just to much. Sam Rami shows us brains smashed up, rolling body parts and the whole nine yards as far as lots of gore gose, but I think that how gorey the sepcial effects are  is reson to love this even more, because even the special effects have some how faded over the years, but we must remember it was only film studnets that made this the hit was and the hit it deseved to be.
This is a great Special Edition disk in mind, but if you don't own this already you might want to wait for the other Special Edition DVD set to come out in a month or so from right now.
Just in case you don't want to speand the mony on the newer edition that is soon to be released then I beilve this is this edition is worth every penny.

946783,4,6304953747,"Ah, to be young, low of budget, and inventive.
Such was the predicament Sam Raimi et al found themselves in back in 1982.  A head brimming with ideas for odd-angled shots, staccato editing (two Raimi devices used to great effect in one of my favourite films, ""The Quick and The Dead""), and better methods for splattering gore was all that Raimi took into the Tennessee woods with him (oh, and the indispensable Bruce Campbell tagged along too).  What he came out with was a film that manages to be simultaneously sophisticated, primitive, gruesome, and hilarious: ""The Evil Dead"".
While not as blatant about its task as its more polished sequel ('polished' being a relative term), Raimi's first trip down splatterfest lane intends to mock horror movie conventions with all the glee of an omnipotent slasher.  So when someone goes to check the dark cellar, or a mysterious sight up ahead in the woods (""You stay here... I'll be RIGHT BACK!""), they're gone for a longer time than usual.  The audience, used to the length of such scenes, will actually get antsy that Our Hero has perished.  When a hand quickly grabs the wrist of a helpless young woman, it's not always the demon of our nightmares, but the young lady's beau.  During the climactic showdown between the deadites and Ash, Ash is repeatedly thrown against a wall, only to get trapped underneath a flimsy fallen bookshelf.  It comically couldn't have a more inextricable grip on him than if it was a giant octopus.  And for such a small, deserted cabin, it sure has a lot of doors and rooms through which evil can hide.  The Labyrinth was less daedal.
The one drawback here, besides the wooden acting, is the complete lack of story, character development or social message (okay, so that's three drawbacks).  To sum up, five young friends go for a vacation weekend in a deserted cabin deep in the Tennessee woods, where they accidentally wake up the spirits of the dead (story).  Ash dates Shelly, Scotty dates Linda, and Cheryl is Ash's sister (character development).  And as for social messages, well, it could be construed as having a shrewd environmental commentary: after years of mankind raping the forests, here we have a forest raping a young woman (a deliciously shocking scene).  But that's probably giving the filmmakers too much credit.
Regardless, there's surely enough blood and dismemberment, of both the sincere and sidesplitting variety, to satisfy your appetite for carnage.  And enough laughs, of both the intentional and unintentional variety, to keep you laughing between screams.",1012867200,4,2562,4.955607476635514

Story of course involves some college students going up to a somewhat abandon cabin and the evil starts from there and how they unleash it, you must see for yourself. The acting was well ok, however Bruce Campbell himself did awesome I think he is a great highly underrated actor.

The work on the demons or zombies, though they didn't seem like major flesh eaters, just demons in human form are quite excellent, the rough sketching and so on.

If you like entertaining, quiet, keep you guessingtype of horror movies then see evil dead. I lovethe whole series but the first one is more of a major horror movie then the others,  however they are all outstanding. Dont be fooled by the ending, there is more of that too come.

Raimi's is a good look on how the movie was made. Campbell's, on the other hand, is just funny! Now, don't be fooled. The ""Behind-the-scenes"" is nothing special. Just a bunch of cuts and inaudioble advice to the actors. No interviews, no funny outtakes, but still cool! This movie spawned two sequels. Both great. Not as scary, but good.

But, we also know there has been a previous special edition DVD from horror video masters, Elite Entertainment. It also happened a few times in the past were the older edition was better, in terms of either presentation or extras. Let me explain to you why you need to replace your current Edition with this one. First of all, you get a THX master of the film, which I don't remember ever being done on this film before. Thank god for Anchor Bay or for the most part older cult movies would suffer horrendous transfers and high prices due to its availability. Next, you get what is looking to be a stellar replica of the book of the dead that holds the DVD. You can see screens of it at deadites.net. Finally, the extras is where this new edition really shines. First off, you get commentaries which are from Elite. You get screen tests of the plentiful gore effects also from Elite. You get a documentary about fanboys, made by Bruce Campbell himself. Another nice adddition is the original TV spots and trailers for the movie, and everyone loves vintage ads. But the part that makes this an ABSOLUTE must buy is the inclusion of Within the Woods, Sam Raimi's short film that has rarely been seen by anyone.

Tree's split apart and crash to the ground from some unknown force. Little do you know, as you enter an old cabin in the woods, that this will be your last night to live...if Ash has anything to say about it.
Made on a next to nothing budget, Evil Dead is still as disturbing today as when it was released. Do you know of any other horror's plastered with the NC-17 rating? Ultra-gore and erupting goo, with flying chainsaws and shotgun shells splatter throughout the cabin's interior. Imagine your sister, suddenly starting to predict the poker cards in your hand, one after the other, then jerking violently she levitates into the air spewing out incantation's and words of warning. Clock's stop, screams ring out...and what follows is one of the most graphically inclined series of horror segment's to ever be placed on film. As Blair Witch left everything to the imagination, Evil Dead leaves nothing to the imagination. After literally watching thousands of movies in my life this is by far the most disturbing. The last three times I have taken it to friends houses, they have made me take it out of the player within the first 20 minutes. How long can you last?
But, as gruesome as Evil Dead is, you will not likely find better representation of Good versus Evil. Ash, the hero, watches his friends around him turn into these hideous flesh craving creatures, and he must use everything good and strong that he can muster, to fight off the darkness. Turn out the light's, crank up the volume, and cheer for Ash.
(WARNING: When I say you have been warned, you have been warned, the sound and the images are extremely disturbing. It easily, with a little more, could have gone for the X rating. If robocop originally got an X rating, this would have tackled it.)

Throughout the film Cambell takes a hilarious hiding getting smashed into walls, bookshelves repeatably falling on him and his whole body getting cut up by the evil fingernails of the dead. At one point in the film Bruce is caught under a small chair and is unable to actually lift the thing off himself.

Ill admit the acting is amateurish, the plot is ridicilous and the effects well, but theres just something about The Evil Dead that makes it a 5 star movie in my world. Maybe its that weird low-budget charm, or the fact that Bruce Campbell, Sam Raimi and the rest seem like such nice guys. I dunno.
One things for sure, the numerous people out there calling this the scariest movie ever, really should watch more movies. Unlike its sequels, this is actually meant to be scary, but fails in just about every way a movie can fail in that respect. Where it succeeds, however, is at entertaining.
The plot goes something like this: Five teens, who for some reason find themselves in a remote cabin in the woods drinking berry drinks, accidentally play back a recording containing portions of the dreaded Book of the Dead, causing all hell to break loose. Thats basically it. Exept this movie somehow manages to pull it off, through the combination of a great location, sheer imagination, and at times wildly inventive camera work (foreshadowing the excellent Evil Dead II).
This movie was considered quite gory for its time (1982 or thereabout), but the low-budget effects have lost most of their impact over the years. Or maybe Im just being insensitive...
This DVD has some nifty extras, including a huge still gallery, trailer, and 20 mins of hilarious alternate footage (plenty of demon-posessed growling here).

When it starts, the grainy quality of the film hints that it might just be another horrible slasher film from the 70's or 80's, but Evil Dead transcends that and comes out to be a true classic, leading up to two more great movies, and in this way the Evil Dead trilogy almost mirrors George Romero's zombie trilogy, as far as opinion of the three movies.

This film demonstrates how scares can be pulled from the audience without the need for excessive violence, then offers up excessive violence in an almost mocking manner. Sam Raimi provided this cult classic to the world, and I while I can't represent everyone, I think it's safe to say that the world thanks Sam.
The DVD offers a few bonus materials. The commentary by Bruce ""Don't Call Me Ash"" Campbell is interesting and funny, providing glimpses into the errors that made it to the final cut as well as providing humorous insights to the making. The commentary by Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert is very intersting too, although I would probably say I preferred Bruce's.

The special efects are great for their time and budget, very convincing. The rapid editing and quick camera cuts makes for some of the greatest suspense seen on film. The 'Sam-Cam' is also first-rate. It supposed to make it look like a spirit out in the woods, and is delivered magnifincently. The acting, though, is typical B-movie fare. Which means they tried to hard, and over-acted. But don't get confused with the second one either.

""The Evil Dead"" is truly one of the best, and wildest, horror/cult films ever made.  Originally, a box office failure when theatrically released in 1983, the film has since become a huge underground hit and eventually became popular enough to spawn two very worthy sequels, ""Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn"" (1987) & ""Army of Darkness"" (1993).
The ""Evil Dead"" trilogy, along with Romero's ""Living Dead"" films, is perhaps the best example of a horror film's ability to evolve if given the chance to do so.  The first ""Evil Dead"" film is played off as strictly being a horror film filled with blood and guts and a very slight touch of humor.  ""Evil Dead 2"", while technically a continuation of part one, is more like a remake of the first film with a much greater amount of camp humor and slapstick comedy thrown in around the elements of terror.  The third (and best in my opinion) film of the trilogy is ""Army of Darkness"".  This one is quite different from the first two films in that it takes place during the dark ages (one will have to view the end of part two to understand how the change in time and place has occurred), and that the element of horror has now all but disappeared from the storyline, having been replaced almost entirely by the highly absurd (but also highly entertaining) camp humor and wild slapstick first brought to the series in the second film, with a hint of sword & sorcery and swashbuckling elements thrown in for good measure.
The three films in the ""Evil Dead"" saga are by far the best career efforts by Director Raimi and Actor/Producer Campbell.  Yes, the ""Evil Dead"" films truly are minor masterpieces in their own right and should be seen atleast once by every film buff.  I personally recommend watching all three films back-to-back, along with Romero's ""Living Dead"" trilogy.  Now there's a real ""fright film fest""!",989539200,2,2539,4.736961451247166

947060,5,6304953747,"Ever since its release back in 1979, Sam Raimi's ""ferciously original horror film (Stephen King)"" has stood in a class all its own simply because no movie has ever been able to truly succeed it. The film's only true superior is its immediate sequel ""Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn,"" but most of us already knew that, so we won't count that one in the grand scheme of things.
When ""The Evil Dead"" was released, it was so totally gory, repulsive, funny, and scary that people couldn't decide whether this was visionary-ahead-of-its-time-filmmaking or a total waste of brain cells. The more intelligent among us recognize it as art in a genre during which time was just being rebirthed, thanks to the success of John Carpenter's masterful ""Halloween,"" which paved the way for pretty much every horror film that came after it. But Raimi didn't do what most of the filmmakers of the eighties tried to do, which was to basically copy the ""Halloween"" formula down on paper and make a new script with it. No, he had something much darker in mind; something that dwelt within the woods and could be reawakened by the incantations of an ancient book: Nocturum de Morto - The Book of the Dead, later renamed Necronomicon Ex Mortis, which was later abused by producer Brian Yuzna for the awful H.P. Lovecraft film called ""Necronomicon."" The book, which served as a passage way to the evil worlds of the beyond was translated and studied by Professor Raymond Knowby, who used a tape recorder to record the phonetic pronounciations of the book's passages, not fully knowing exactly what he was doing with it. The professor ended up dead (we assume) after his wife attempted to kill him while possessed. But the professor reveals one vital clue as to how to destroy the demons in human form: Bodily dismemberment. Do we actually see this? Yes we do, and it actually looks realistic enough to churn a stomach or two. Yet, despite all of this seriousness, the acting of the film is so purposely bad that we realize that we're seeing more than a horror film: This is a satire. ""The Evil Dead"" was not made in bad taste, as its more hateful critics hypothesized, but on the contrast, it is about bad taste, and about making fun of bad taste in a new way. Not only do we see evidence of this in the bodily dismemberment of one inhabitant of the cursed cabin, but in the ""raping"" of another, the stabbing in the ankle of yet another, and the decapitation of the same ""yet another."" This movie is so full of Karo syrup and latex it would've been easy for it to get lost along the way, but Sam Raimi keeps the film along the same track the entire time, lighting the path with lanterns of dark humor, and it never steps wrong. At its center is a sympathetic Bruce Campbell performance, amazing camerawork for such a low budget, and enough gore for an entire room of blood-and-guts hounds.

There is a lot of cartoonish gore thrown in to keep our interest.
Director Sam Raimi gives the proceedings a tongue-in-cheek tone and sets up many elaborate moments of over-the-top physical humor that simply don't pay off due to bad timing.

Look, what I am going to do is write a review on each Evil Dead movie. I already did this for the Hellraiser and Nightmare on Elm Street Movies, and I am going to do it for the friday the 13th movies, the Halloween movies, and the horrible after the first one it went so downhill its not funny SCREAM movies. And many more in the near future. I am going to rate each movie by 5 stars, 1 being the worst, and 5 of cousre being the best.
Evil Dead (5 stars) Before seeing this movie I had heard a lot about it. Not from my stupid friends who would rather see Lethal Weapon Part XXVI but real Horror Movie Goers. After seeing this movie I basically wanted to be Bruce Campbell. Of course my brother beat me up for it(lol) but hey, it was fun while it lasted. Like Sam R. said after making this movie was how he wanted to make this movie more of a ""Scary movie"", he basically wanted to frighten the crowd with every scary moment. This movie can be said by all to of course be the scariest of the bunch. When seeing this movie it freaked me out like the part when they were playing cards and when Linda was possesed. The gore in this  movie is amazing for some, but for most Horror fans its mild compared to movies like Dead Alive. Overall this movie is and always will be on my list for greatest movies ever. This movie will also remain the best low-budget movie ever. (made for only 350,000)
Evil Dead II:Dead By Dawn(4 stars) Before veiwing this movie I wasn't expecting much, I was expected a normal stinker Sequal! But more and more before the release date of the movie, I kept getting more and more high hopes. I was thinking this movie could not possibly be bad because of the first one being so good. After seeing this movie I thought it was AWESOME! But...not as good as the first. The thing that I didn't like was how no parts where really scary expect for when Lindas face was up against the window, and when the mom was in the cellar and he saw her for the first time. Even though this movie lacking in scaryness this movie was still visually awesome. After this movie was finished Sam said how when making this he was trying to give the crowd more of a Special Effects treat, instead of being a scary movie. Of course with this ending there would be one more sequal.
Army Of Darkness(4 Stars) Of course before seeing this movie I didn't think it was going to be scary. I expected a action type horror movie and that is what you get. I love this  movie for its a nice get you into the movie plot and Bruce Campbell's one liners! Oh man are they awesome. I went around for about a week just saying them to my brother (Of course getting beat up once again, and also once again...hey! it was fun while it lasted)One thing I hated about this was how Sam was trying to make this a comedy, not anything of a horror movie. The GraveYard scene is just stupid with the fingers in his eyes and the stupid sound effects but still. This movie was awesome. Also another thing is the ending. There was an Alternate ending and can be found on the Anchor Bay Version (as an extra). But still instead of the sleeping till end of time ending I prefer the S-Mart ending much much more. This movie would still be good if all the sound was taken out and Bruce's one liners where just left in.
Well that is it thank you and goodbye and I hope you didn't fall asleep already.",980812800,4,3495,4.22272047832586

947091,5,6304953747,"A group of college kids are vacationing in the Tennessee woods, having rented a run down cabin for the weekend.  Once there, they accidentally release a host of Kandarian demons.  Then the stuff hits the fan.
I have several reasons for liking this movie.  The main reason is Bruce Campell.  His charactor, Ash, isn't the hero type he turns out to be in Evil Dead 2 or Army of Darkness.  He is much more sensitive and eaisily frightend, spending the first half of the movie letting Stevie take care of most of the dirty work.  Ash is reluctent to kill or even bury those that were once his friends, no matter what they have done to him.  Ash even cries.  He is the hero only because he isn't as brave as some others.  Not until later, anyway.
The second reason I love this film is the pure fright value of it.  From the first five minutes the eerieness of the movie comes through.  The special FX are generally top notch, as is the makeup (see for your self how creepy Linda looks with just a little touch up).  The end scene is one of the best FX sequences I have ever seen, and the ""chased by the evil"" effect is pretty spiffy.
For those of you who, like myself, prefer a good splatter every now and again, there is plenty, both from monsters and from the cabin its self.  For those that prefer to be scared silly, again like myself, Sam Raimi does a wonderful job of building suspense. The evil in the woods spends more time toying with the kids than actually killing them.  There are quite a few ""jump"" moments as well.  Even if you know the film, some of the scenes make you jump every time.  Adding to the fright are the feeling you get for the characters.  When something happens to them you find yourself going ""oh no, not him/her.  that can't happen to them"".
Be warned, though, ED lacks the director's  signature humor in favor of scares.  For those of you looking for that, i highly recomend checking out the other two fims in this series.
For anybody who is a fan of downright horror, independent film, Bruce Campell, Sam Raimi, or movies in general, Evil Dead is an essential part of your collection.  In my humble opinion, it ties Night of the Living Dead for the greatest horror movie and cult classic ever made. Trust me.",978825600,,2236,4.378640776699029

Evil Dead is a classic, and should always be hailed in the same breath as Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It was the ultimate low budget thriller, with tons of gore and images you could only throw into a movie like this (IE the tree raping scene?). But it's moved a step above that by the talented direction and knack for horror of Sam Raimi and the energetic and off-the-wall acting of Bruce Campbell. It spawned two sequels (which were both, in their own ways, as good as the original, which is quite an oddity in the movie world), and has developed into a cult classic all over the world.

Good edition, but lacking in extras.  A couple of months later this edition comes out and I finally have it.  What kept me from buying it? The price is a little steep, but well worth it for the carnage and truly if you're a ""Dead"" fan like I am.  One thing I did like better about Anchor Bay's version was it had far more chapter stops.  Where this one only contains about 16.  Anyway, loved the extras on this one.  You get the same old theatrical trailer.  You get 20 minutes of alternate takes, which I enjoyed and for only twenty minutes it really gives you a knack on how to shoot a low budget film.  The commentary was great.  Sam Raimi's was more serious and informational. Where Bruce Campbell's just made me flat out laugh, but I wish they had done one combined.  Neither of these tracks came close to the gem Anchor Bay released on ""Evil Dead 2"" probably the best commentary track I've ever heard.  I've said enough, buy this or I'll swallow your soul.

Like Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, Raimi and Campbell (along with Tapert) give you all the information, history, anecdotes, and stories behind just about every facet of the movie in the commentary.  In this DVD, Raimi and Tapert are on 1 commentary while Campbell is by himself on the other (with each pointing out how the other would probably tell a different story or hit on things a little bit better).  And typical of Raimi and Campbell, they seem to enjoy making fun of themselves and about how bad their movie was.
At any rate, Evil Dead is everything you would want if you are familiar with the series, and a pretty darn good horror flick nonetheless.

Five friends go out to a cabin in the wood and accidentally unleash a demon which posseses some of the friends. The movie is extremely violent, but other then that, it is a good time. It isn't really scary, besides a couple of scenes. The movie however is one of the most entertaining movies of all time. It can be watched over and over again. This is why it has such a cult following. One thing to note when you are watching this movie; don't take it to seriously. It isn't meant to be taken seriously. This is evident by the sequel, which is much more of a black comedy and the third one, which I would probably call a black comedy. All three are great, but the first one is my favorite.
Evil Dead is more than just a personal favorite. If you ook at the movie critically, it is a great movie. Bruce Campbell's acting is great. It is supposed to be over the top.

Sam Raimi would later go  on to direct the two great sequels and the brilliant Simple Plan, but this  is his masterwork. A low-budget, comic-horror excursion unlike any other. A  movie so proud of its gore and hideousness that it promotes it on the front  cover. ""The Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror.""  The movie's  plot is typical, college kids going to have lots of sex and partying in an  abandoned cabin....find an old book.....unleash evil. That is where the  real pay-off comes in while watching your squeamish friends cringe at the  disgusting visuals that Raimi proudly spills across the screen. Bruce  Campbell, who has made his mark on cult-movie history with these  installments of the Dead trilogy, is perfect as the niave yet vengeful  hero. He would later be built up in the sequels, but I think this movie  portrays him at his most primitive, enjoyable area of the role known as  Ash. The ending's atmospheric tone makes you relate to Ash as he struggles  all alone to survive the night. There is a particular scene where his eyes  are closed tight, his back is to the wall, and he is mumbling to himself  about how he doesn't want to go like this. This scene is the most  definitive scene in the Dead trilogy, and the genre's history. A movie that  does not hold back or let up, it is a MUST for all horror fans.  I can only  think of a few movies that come close to the quality of the first Evil  Dead.

947260,5,6304953747,"I spent some time trying to find this edition. You can find the Anchor Bay copy all over, but it is VERY lacking in features.
This DVD cost me as much as the collectors edition of The Thing, but it is SO worth it.
The  bonus features include roughly 20 minutes of RAW behind the scenes footage.  You can see the markings on the film go past the projector, no music, very  basic. But it's very interesting to watch. In fact, many of the actors  comments are left in.
Also, they include dozens and dozens of pictures.  Some are just ok, others are pretty interesting. The theatrical trailer is  a little different too. I've never seen that one before.
First, my  biggest complaint is there is no wide screen version. Maybe wide screen  versions didn't exist in 1982, I have no idea.
You can select two types  of commentary. Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert, or Bruce Campbell. Let me just  say that I was very, very disappointed with Sam and Robert. They might as  well have not even bothered. During the ENTIRE movie, you could just about  fit BOTH of their feedback on a single sheet of paper. Worthless. At times  they would go over 5 minutes with no comments. Doesn't that totally defeat  the purpose? Both men are very quiet. I wish Elite would have just scrapped  them altogether. I am very glad I didn't buy it for their  commentary.
Bruce, on the other hand, gave EXCELLENT commentary. Just  about every single scene he gives detail. He shows you mistakes, tells you  how scenes were filmed, how far apart they were, and so much more  information. In fact, I learned more about Evil Dead from his commentary  than from ALL the fan sites combined. He did an outstanding job telling us  how they filmed it.
On with the DVD, I can't imagine someone reading  these reviews who hasn't seen it. My guess is that most readers will just  want to know what the DVD has to offer. If you want selection, get the  Elite version. The Anchor Bay version has virtually nothing on it.
The  special effects look a little more fake on DVD, but I think just about  everyone knows they were very low budget. Still, the blood and guts hit  home. This is an excellent late night, weekend or whatever horror flick.  Not for the weak, even with the low budget special effects.
As most  readers will know, Evil Dead set a standard for its extreme use of blood  and guts, bodily dismemberment, acts of killing, and demonic  disfigurement.
The Elite version costs more than the Anchor Bay version,  but if you are a TRUE Evil Dead fan, get the Elite copy. It is far  superior. You will be VERY glad you did.
Did you know they shot in at  least 3 different locations? Hal and Sarah (actors) were not their real  names? Betsy Bakers character had several stand ins? That there was no  cellar in the actual cabin? That many of the back to back scenes were  actually filmed 6 month (or years) apart? Well, you'll find out.",964310400,39,2892,4.471264367816092

He is forced by circumstances to become the hero and he finally  comes through.  However, this is a pretty formulaic horror movie with lots  of blood and guts and a splash of humor.  A great job with a very low  budget to work with and a fantastic 1st effort for people who have gone on  to bigger and not necessary better things.  For those unfamiliar with the  movie, however, I would recommend that you rent it first to see if you  really want to buy it.",963100800,2,614,4.336283185840708
947263,4,6304953747,"""The Evil Dead"" is one of my favourite horror movies and certainly one of the most important horror flicks ever made. It's a pity that, in Germany, you only can get the ""cut"" version (with less  gore than the original, of course). But what the heck, it's still a  spine-chilling experience to watch Raimi's masterpiece. The movie itself is  far better than most people believe, it does certainly not rely merely on  cheap shock effects, but what you can find is also a great deal of  references to other movies - especially old Hammer pictures from the 60's  (e.g. the sinister surroundings, the fog hovering everywhere). Of course  you shouldn't watch it if you already can't sleep after watching  ""Gremlins"", but if you love real good horror films, you must get  yourself into ""Evil Dead"". Suspense, fun and gore galore  guaranteed.",962755200,,834,4.851063829787234
947264,5,6304953747,"Sam Raimi, an amazing movie considering on the low budget it was made. The effects Raimi creates are amazing like in the first scene when the 5 teenagers arrive at the cabin and the porch swing is hitting rhymically  against the cabin and stops when Tom puts his hand on the door, really  creepy and effective, but now with the ""Scream"" movies, I doubt  it would scare anyone.
For those who are Ash fans (myself included), you  will be dissapointed, the ""Ash attitude"" as I like to call it  (one-liners, guns, chainsaws for hands, and always getting the girl),  doesn't really gel till the end of the movie and into ""Evil Dead  2"". Ash's real name is Ashely and he is pretty much Ashely till the  end of the movie where his character becomes Ash. Not to down play on Bruce  Campbell who does a great job, this is how it is in this movie. An example  of this is when some zombie girls attack Tom and Ashely is standing in the  background looking horrified, and those who have seen ""Evil Dead  2"" or ""Army of Darkness"" will be standing up and screaming  at Ash to do something.
I would say it is unfair to compare ""Evil  Dead"" to ""Army of Darkness"" because the movies get better as  they go along and, of course, have higher budgets... ""Evil Dead  2"" is not as strong plot wise and ""Evil Dead"" because  basically it's a remake of ""Evil Dead""...
""Evil Dead""  could also be considered to have a weak plot that a 5-year old can follow,  but horror films are much more subtle and create more suspence now so that  screenwriters don't have to hit the plot over the audience's head to get it  across. If this movie was shown today, it would get bad reviews as a horror  movie, but ""Evil Dead"" is more of a cult classic and if you can  step back and realize that ""Evil Dead"" even though it's a  low-budget movie, it's a satire on low-budget movies and does a lot of  sterotypical things on purpose. This humour is carried on in ""Evil  Dead 2"" and ""Army of Darkness""
Bottom Line: You love  Raimi, Campbell, or ""Army of Darkness"", you won't be  dissapointed, but you might want to rent it before you own it.",962236800,3,2096,4.3462532299741605

For example, Ash discovers the same taperecorder (for the first time) in  both movies, as if the events in ED1 never happened.  Yes, ED1 is creative,  for a low budget movie, but EDII is much better.  The combination of EDII  and Army of Darkness can't lose as a slapstick comedy horror  double-feature.

947268,3,6304953747,"Now don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Sam Raimi (especially his DarkMan), but this movie didn't seem to cut it.  I think a good, quality horror movie must always begin with a lot of charactor developement, in  which the audience can relate to the ""victims"".  This way, when  trouble arrives, the siduation becomes more believable.  This was not so in  Evil Dead.  The movie almost emmediately started with a set of eery  twitches and sequences, as if Sam Raimi wanted just to skip the  ""borring stuff"" and jump right into the ""scary stuff"".  This was a very bad move, but at least the charactors weren't bad actors.  As a matter of fact, I thought the acting was unusually good.  But lets  just forget about the sentimental part, any true horror fan will just focus  mainly on the gore factors.  In this case, Evil Dead is a masterpiece of  horrific disfigurement and unconcerned cannibalism.  Its not a non-stop  blood-fest, but when the heat is up, the fire starts burning.  There's even  a very creepy and distastefully sexual encounter with a monster tree, but  lets not get into that.  My main point is, that Evil Dead can only be  reveled at, not experienced.  The storyline is so choppy that tension  development will rarely occur.  If you're looking for a good time, buy the  sequal: Evil Dead 2; if you're looking for a scare, go to a haunted house  or something, cause this one won't delivere the goods.  I'd buy it for the  special effects though; its cheap, but very explicit.  I give this movie  credit strictly based on its ability to deliver massive amounts of gore,  not its emotional effectiveness.",960854400,,1619,4.627659574468085

I have to admit they did an excellent job with what they had to work with, hence the 4 star rating.  The plot is a little  thin, but the movie does have some pretty creepy moments. My favorite was  the girl who was guessing the cards before they were picked up from the  deck. Her back was turned, and the way her voice was changing by the second  was really creepy, it gave me the willies before she even turned around.  The only thing I didn't see in the movie was the supposed subtle humor.  Maybe I'm just thick-headed and didn't ""get it,"" but I saw  nothing funny in this movie. Just lots of gore, nasty jump-out-of-your-  seat surprises, and alot of goosebumps.  It's worth buying. After renting  it I went out and bought it to add to my collection.

The film is very well worth buying, and I must urge you to  rent-- no, I must urge you to BUY-- the follow-up ""Evil Dead 2: Dead  By Dawn"" which is more of a remake than sequel.

(Cheesy acting is key to a good horror flick) If you haven't seen  this one, GET IT!!  You won't be disappointed.",940118400,2,699,4.292307692307692
947474,1,6304953747,"After reading the good reviews of this flick I've seen on the internet, I decided to go and rent this one.  I don't know what the reviewers were thinking (they must have been on crack) because this movie sucked! The acting was cheap and the demons were not frightening at all!  For college-level work this was good, but its got competition out there  that it just can't compare to.  The romance of the main couple in this film  was just not believable to me -- I kept finding myself forgetting they were  boyfriend and girlfriend since it just didn't seem to fit.  The only fair  aspect of this film was the gore (rather low-budget, but still good) at the  end of the movie.  In conclusion, after watching this video, I wished I had  done something else with my time!",939600000,8,767,4.446043165467626

Picture and sound are as good as it gets and the extra features are awesome. Bruce Campbell's audio commentary is  very funny. With this DVD, you can't get tired of warching it over and over  again.

947583,5,6304953747,"This is easily the best horror movie ever made! The story starts off with a bunch of friends heading into the woods to stay at a friends cabin. When they get there they discover a book bound in human flesh, and thats where  the fun starts. Director/writer Sam Raimi spares us no gory details in  documenting the untimely demise of all of the characters. The guts and gore  come fast and furious and you have barely recovered from the last  mind-numbing experience in terror before you are nailed square between the  eyes with another. This is a great movie to help you get a little closer to  the girlfriend!",923529600,,608,4.532110091743119

947621,4,6304953747,"I think the reason why 'Evil Dead' is such a good  horror (in my view at least)is because it manages to create a very good of fear simply because there is no escape for the teens.  Also, fear is made even more frightful  by the fact that one by one each of the teens are killed off..untill there  is  one left! (at least untill you watch the sequel). Overall, I'd say that  this movie has got to be  worth a try, even if the actoring is...well, a  little odd in places.  I would also recommend  Evil Dead 2, which is an  even better film and gets the full 5 stars from me.",918777600,,572,4.017857142857143

7879718,3,6304953747,Its still an amazing movie but its not the original movie when you GEORGE LUCAS it! Digitally removing the charm of what made it incredible in the first place. Additionally the Original Evil Dead doesnt have the commentary or behind the scenes. Its sad to say the dvd version is better. Evil dead 2 is awesome and has been untouched (thank god).
