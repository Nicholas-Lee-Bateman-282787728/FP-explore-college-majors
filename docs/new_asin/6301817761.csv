369896,5,6301817761,"A classic intro to animals and their ways for little ones and adults. Our kids, and now our grandkids love the story and images. They ask to watch it often when visiting. A really well done story with a British perspective, including sequencing from brand new puppy and kitten to young adulthood. Filmed in rural northern England with beautiful full seasonal scenery. There are carefully trained and respected animals in the entire story, no people seen at all. Excellent narration and music background.
Nice replacement for our ancient but classic VHS copy. DVD, what a concept! Cleaned up a bit, better image and sound. Not to mention much easier to store and use!",1520467200,,666,4.902654867256637

369964,1,6301817761,"Wish I could return a rental. We only watched about 10 minutes, 5 of which my 5yo daughter begging me to turn it off but I couldn't find the remote fast enough.

Other reviewers marked this as a great family flick for all ages, and one said ""a must for animal lovers,"" but my 5yo (animal lover) found the first 5 minutes too painful and scary (the crab on the kitty's nose was too much for her!)(Ok that wasn't fake -- Ow!!). As an adult, I just found it to be not at all funny. I have to agree with my tender-hearted girl -- too much pain to watch. This movie shouldn't have been made and should not be available to rent/buy.

My little loved Happy Feet, so if you've got - or you are - a person not de-sensitively to pain and suffering, maybe that's a better choice for you.",1511308800,,776,4.132450331125828

I was having kind of a blah day and i wanted to find an entertaining and endearing ""dog lover"" movie today to watch for my doggie and me. this was perfect. she actually really watches it. she even barks at certain scenes and gets more into it than i get into my movies.  completely and intently focused. its so funny. she will lay down with her head on her hands watching it when more relaxed or sit up when she sees more exciting scenes.  then at some parts she'll bark or growl at it. but no matter what her eyes are glued on the screen and shes really focused on it. its so entertaining and cheers me up just to even simply watch her watch the movie. i love how this movie is a live action film with real life animal interactions without any photoshopping or editing to change their movements like modern movies. I think thats why her (and me) find this movie so pleasant to watch because its so real and has so many different types of animals interacting together. Wonderful idea and production and no other movie out there that Ive seen of this unique kind. If you're looking for an amazing story line though you're probably not going to get it here, but if you're looking for super cute and endearing, interesting real-life animal interactions and something endearing to take your mind off things this will be great :)",1504656000,,1420,4.395437262357414

370153,5,6301817761,"We bought this movie here and watch it via the Amazon video app with no problems. It's my 5 year old nephew's favorite movie and one of my childhood favorites as well...

My husband was a teenager when this came out and I was surprised he never saw this until recently. He thoroughly enjoyed the movie and he's in his mid-forties. It's full of adventure and has loads of funny moments.

If you're an animal lover, you'll likely love this movie too. My husband commented that if this was made today, people would likely protest all of the ways animals may have been in danger in creating this and I think he's right. There are some scenes that really make you wonder.

The cinematography, music, and narration are unique and endearing. The single voice playing every character is a perfect match and did an excellent job with each animals' lines. So creative and adorable, this movie is hard not to love.

If you have kids and are considering renting it, I'd recommend buying it because chances are, they want to watch it again and again. I babysit my nephew weekly and he requests it every time without fail.

It's a feel good movie that parents can feel good letting kids watch. From the start, you can see how Milo, the trouble maker cat, gets himself into trouble by not listening to his mother. His bond with his best friend, Otis the dog, and their growth from being babies to fully grown, will have you in awe over their cuteness.

Very cute movie. Smile. Highly recommended.",1487548800,,1481,4.569811320754717

Films such as this attract those of us who love animals, but the animals used for this movie were horribly treated. There was no green screen here. These animals really were placed into some terrible situations. A cat really did go over a cliff, really was pecked by all those birds, really did get put in a box to float.

I know there's some controversy about the treatment of the animals in the making of the film, but if I'm just rating the movie as the final product, I think it is well done, especially considering how it didn't rely on CGI or any special effects at all.  It's just a fun movie to watch as a family.  I like it that it is old fashioned, i.e., it's not too hyper or containing underlying adult themes that so many Disney movies tend to be these days.

370887,1,6301817761,"This isn't really a family friendly film. I watched it as a kid and found it terrifying and disturbing. 20+ years later, watching it again, I have to agree with my kid self. This film starts off charming, but it doesn't stay there. Something about it is off-kilter. I think the real abuse and misery of the animals in the movie shines through. I usually try to keep opinions on these matters to myself, since the truth isn't always fully apparent in matters of animal abuse allegations, but since it bugged me to watch it as a kid, I bring it up to help parents who are thinking of letting their little ones see it. This film is nightmare fuel for tots with sensitive hearts (and no fun for the average kid either).",1447027200,,715,4.383458646616542

370956,5,6301817761,"I seriously feel bad for anyone who did not grow up watching the classic ""Milo and Otis"". It is holds such a strong memory in my childhood, one of those bittersweet classics that you never forget. Personally I love the music in it, but my wife doesn't. -she didn't grow up with it. Our twins love this movie because it has so many different animals in it. Watching it as an adult I can't help but to wonder how many animals were harmed in the making of this film? I think a fish is actually eaten in one scene; the other times are more minor but perhaps painful shots for the animals. In the end everyone is happy and well. Still I don't think a film like this would be allowed to be produced in the United States anymore. In fact I don't think it was filmed in the United States to begin with...

Anyway, if you don't have this movie in your children's collection buy it! There are no people in the film whatsoever which means no swearing, obscenity, and other elements that sneak into children's films today. You do see animals giving birth if that is a concern to you; my kids think the animals are ""pooping"". But that's life; it's all rather tastefully handled.

I was absolutely HORRIFIED and felt sick to my stomach after watching these animals being tortured and terrified for viewers entertainment. To name a few instances, in one scene a cat is seen being thrown off a cliff dozens of feet in the air into an ocean & swimming for it's life while being pounded down with waves. Another, is the first bear scene, the puppy pug (which breed are not strong swimmers to begin with) is being held under the water by the bear's paws nearly drowning it. There is evidence from the humane societies providing the animals that there were as many as 27 cats killed in the making of this movie.

371226,1,6301817761,"Artistic wise, the movie was good...  and I hate to say that because of the content in it.  I have to give the movie only one star because it's so obviously filled with animal cruelty.  Fans of the movie claim that it was only ""training"" or that the maker was filming the natural reaction of the cat and dog in the wild.  OK, if it was training,  then the cat was ""trained to jump off the cliff.""  If so,  why wasn't there any scenes of the cat making the brave jump off the cliff?  If it was an example of the film maker documenting the animal's reactions to the wild,  then how did he anticipate the jump to have a camera man waiting at the bottom to capture the fall?  All the action was happening above.  And,  if it was a ""natural thing"" again, why wasn't there any video of the actual jump since it allegedly occurred during the bird attack which was caught on tape.

The simple answer is that the cat did not jump off that cliff on it's own. It had to be thrown.  And that's cruelty no matter how you look at it.  Would the film maker had forcibly thrown a child off that same cliff even if the child could swim?  I am guessing the answer would have been no because it would have been cruel and the child could have gotten hurt.  The same thing holds true for the animal.  Wouldn't forcibly throwing a cat off a cliff into a rough ocean cause the animal high amounts of mental stress?  Isn't that cruelty?  I am sure if I kept throwing my cat into my pool from my rooftop that the ASPCA would be at my door and rightfully charging me with cruelty.

PARENTS:  DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS WATCH THIS MOVIE.  THINK.  If there are so many adults who feel kittens and puppies are being abused, what impression might a child have?  There are enough cute animal movies out there to see instead.",1433808000,,1787,4.200589970501475

She was recently very sick, too sick to play or do much, and she spent all day on the couch. We watched  this movie 4 or 5 times a day during that. It was the only thing that comforted her. A few weeks ago they took it off netflix so I had to buy it. I am not disappointed.

Sweet story about a cat and dog who are friends. They live on a farm and grow up together, then are separated while out exploring. They spend about a year searching for each other and finally find each other after having many life experiences, including having their own families. It's about love, adventure, friendship, and growing up.

Narrated throughout in a way by the same person,  rather than different actors like Homeward Bound (a somewhat similar movie) which flows better in my opinion. Rich settings and landscapes.

The filming drew controversy over the filmmakers putting the animals in danger and just using animals for entertainment purposes. As a vegan I am a little bit worried about that but I try to get past it since I loved this movie as a child and it provided so much comfort to my sick child. She loves animals and watching them in this movie helped her stay calm to heal. I am not that familiar with the controversy but if you are a vegan you might feel it's important for you to check it out yourself, which is why I mention it here in my review.

Shows animals giving birth in a tasteful way but it's still a bit bloody and graphic. If you are not prepared for your child to see this (or if it freaks you  out), maybe best not to watch this movie.",1427587200,,1643,4.280645161290322

371682,1,6301817761,"The all-too-frequent danger  the animals are placed in---and their all, but certain resultant death for some---overshadows the sweet sentiments of the story--kind of like the scientific experiments on humans in WWII.

A terrified, cowering, crying cat is shown on a cliff being bombarded by seagulls that eventually descend upon him en-mass like they do with food and the shot ends.  You don't see a cat walk away.

The subsequent shot shows a cat thrown from a cliff and into the sea and swimming to shore.  The outtake shows a cat climbing a cliff but he falls off.  We don't know how many cats drowned or were injured in the fall, nor do we know whether the film crew left the cats there or took them back up the cliff.

Similarly, there is scene where a cat is placed in an open wooden box that runs down a river and water fall.  Although that visibly shaken cat makes it back to shore--hence the suspense and adventure of the story line--it is doubtful that all the other shoots of that scene ended as the same.

There are also scenes of the pug wrestling/playing with a bear and the bear climbing towards a terror-stricken cat with  puffed up  tail on a tree branch.  If each take  ended well, the movie would not have taken four years to make.

Because the plot of the story is the ""adventures"", the potential dangers and escapes of Milo and Otis, the animals are put in dangerous positions and it is virtually impossible that all the animal actors emerged simply scared, but physically unharmed.

The film is shot in documentary style without digital editing.  Many of the camera shots end when things aren't looking good for Milo or Otis, which leads me to believe that  what came seconds later was not fit for viewers' eyes, much like in  nature documentaries.

Perhaps most telling is that the directors never outright  stated that  animals were not harmed in the act of filming the movie, despite questions raised by animal rights groups.  Inquiries from animal rights groups in Australia and Europe purportedly met with a dead end.  However, various Japanese animal rights groups are cited in the credits and there was apparently some sort of over-sight, in keeping with local standards, which are not as stringent as  U.S standards.

For me, the harm done to the animals but not shown on-screen overshadows the entertainment  value of the story.",1423958400,,2359,4.7346437346437344

Now I feel horrible because I see that this movie used multiple different cats, and it's not a comforting thought to see a cat in one scene chased by a bear then cut to the next scene and you have a similar cat w/ different colored eyes.
This was originally a Japanese film from 1989 titled: Koneko monogatari

There are cats attacking chicks and chickens, cats and dogs nearly (and probably) drowning, a dog being attacked by a bear, a raccoon being attacked by a bear, etc.  My 5 year old and I only made it through 15 mins before we'd had enough.

Google ""how many animals were hurt in Milo & Otis"" and you would be shocked at the answer, and also at how they got around animal welfare requirements (the answer is: film movies in countries that don't care about animal welfare...like Japan). Please Amazon, show support for the humane treatment of animals by taking this animal torture film down.

371852,1,6301817761,"This movie shoul dbe removed, and banned in every country. Onscreen cuts, editing, or any other way you want to reason that the animals were not hurt, is simply a farce. I wanted to believe it just like you do.... There is no interview with the producer and the pug was best buddies with the bear, the cat at the bottom of the waterfall wasn't in a controlled environment. You need to do some research... there is HOURS and HOURS of footage where many cats and several dogs died on the footage. The scene where the cat is limping on a foot... they broke the foot to get the cat to limp. Birds diving at the cat, and it sitting there meowing... ya you can totally get a cat to act that out, and birds totally do that on queue. That dog with the bear, on several occasions yipped and snarled in pain on the turn around and wanted to get away. That's the stuff you see in the MOVIE. Do some research and read the American and Foreign investigations that found that Animals in this film were not only harmed... were killed. If you don't believe me, you think about this scene and nothing else, they have in the movie on camera a cat at the bottom of a cliff, from a waterfall... they filmed that cat down there for hours.

I understand people don't want to believe it, or even think it. It's very hard to wrap a mind around it. Like me... I'm one that didn't mind the film, even as a kid... I don't mind Little Mermaid, easter eggs, and a lot of the improper things filmed in movies, specifically child films such as innuendo's and hiding curse words. So take it from a loose, not over protective, average joe. Get to Google, do some reading, and then realize this flim should not be anywhere near anyone ever again.",1420156800,,1712,4.30030959752322

372095,5,6301817761,"Ok, I just had to add a review.  First of all, I find it almost laughable that some viewers have felt ""dirty"" after watching this film due to the fact that there may have been animal cruelty throughout.  I wouldn't call it that.  I grew up on a farm and animals can and will do some of the dumbest things and as a kid I would have laughed at the idea of a cat floating down the creek in a wooden box or a dog running and then falling into a hole!  This film totally captured animals being just that...animals and it will keep your kiddos entertained!  I'm in my twenties and I still enjoy watching this flick with my younger siblings.  Yeah I'm probably still a kid at heart but animal antics can be very entertaining and the added voices are just too timely!  Only thing ""dirty"" about this film is the birthing scenes towards the end...both the dog and the cat have litters of their own and it does show the process to an extent!  Other than that, just enjoy it for what it is!  As far as I could tell the animals had a happy ending too.",1418169600,,1038,4.15
372096,1,6301817761,"This movie was extremely disturbing. There are several instances of animal cruelty on screen, some of which were clearly extremely dangerous. I only shudder at the thought of the failed takes and scenes that did not make the final cut.

And all that for what? The final product isn't even very good.

Why is this movie still being sold? Let alone being offered as part of amazon prime? This is shameful. I feel dirty for having watched this with my children.",1418169600,,458,4.6419753086419755
372097,3,6301817761,"Very cute movie. Kids and grownups enjoyed a lot.

Upon reading a bit more about how the movie was made I am starting to realize that the animals may have been harmed in the process. Not something I support.

We continued watching as I didn't find it to be something that would have killed an animal, but then the kitten gets pinched by a crab.  They let the crab continue to pinch the kittens face for a long time in the film and the cat is visibly in pain.

At one point, a live cat (obviously not stuffed) is seen being thrown off a cliff.  A freaking ocean cliff.

Thw Animal humane society didn't give the disclaimer at the front of this film that no animals were harmed because clearly MANY were.

It's been reported that 20 cats were killed and one producer intentionally broke a kittens paw so that it would walk with a limp.  A quick Google search will give all of the facts to you.

I remember when this movie came out it was all the rage. A heart-rending tale of cat and dog buddies. Watching it now, as a mostly grown adult...
SPOILERS
...we came up with a theory (brilliant really). The movie was recorded backwards - yes, backwards. Toward the end of the movie, there were tons of puppies and kittens born. Those kittens and puppies would go on to fuel the twisted snuff scenes that made up the first half of the film.
Yes, you've heard about the cliff ""jump"" and the bear fights by now, but you really need to understand that this is truly groundbreaking animal snuff porn.
Upon doing some research, the famous Japanese cat island, otherwise known as, Tashirojima, originally had it's first development boom from the mid-eighties in conjunction with this film's production. Tashirojima is actually Japanese for ""mutilated orange tabby pug corpses in the spring meadows.""
Another little-known fact: the wild Domos of Japan actually fed on the corpses of poor Milos and Otises for 18 years until they were spotted chasing kittens in a pleasant field - evidence of which was later utilized as a propaganda meme, vilifying self gratification. Movie producers, you sit upon a throne of lies and dead kittens.
Anyhow, I'm getting slightly off-topic.
I wouldn't want a kid to watch this movie purely for the fact that you can't play rough with animals and expect not to get bitten or scratched or mauled or eaten to death. Bear would have eaten the pug. Shark would have eaten the cat. And we're pretty sure someone was controlling the sea turtle from underneath the water with a plunger.

It appears upon watching the movie that the animals were filmed doing their own thing and pieced together to make a story.

The movie was made in Japan, so I am not sure if they have the same standards for animal protections as in the US. Seeing the cat being attacked by sea gulls and then thrown off the cliff was horrifying. Seeing the cat fight the brown bear in the shack was horrifying, especially when the bear's teeth got a grip on the cat's paw. I've read they had to use 30 cats to make the movie, but the movie did take 5 years to make.. so it makes sense for them to use a lot of cats. But I just don't trust that none of the animals were hurt. The end of the movie says the animals were supervised, but it doesn't say that none of the animals were hurt. I don't know.. I just don't trust it. Watching this movie makes me feel very uncomfortable. And my 4-yr-old was simply scared and nervous watching many of the scenes.",1374969600,,923,4.104972375690608

The story is narrated by Dudley Moore who also does ""voices"" for each animal character which is pleasant as if an adult is reading aloud. There no ""talking"" animals with weird mouth movements, or annoying visual/sound effects. The barn and natural world where Milo and Otis have their adventures is green, lush, and very entertaining  and pleasant. There is nothing mean or scary happening, and while there is a nice wild variety of animals in this film, natural enemies or predators don't tangle with each other, or have a narrow escape that's not scary, but fun and fine for little ones to watch. There are no people shown in the film, and the animals have free range of the barn, pastures, and streams. This film was written and made in Japan, where they are masters of cute.

The movie does a lovely job of showing the natural (if domesticated) world to young children, and it's not annoying or obnoxiously loud and ridiculous like so many ""children's movies"" that try to hard to be ""silly"" in order to be entertaining.

When I rewatched the film through adult eyes, I was horrified at what these animals must have been put through, over and over again, to make all the perilous shots found throughout.  There is no disclaimer that animals weren't hurt during the making of this film; I suspect because such a claim could not honestly be made.  I'm sure the writer/director is happy that the Japanese film industry doesn't have such humane requirements or at least didn't when this movie was made.  It mad me sick and sad to watch and I would NEVER recommend it for children who might be traumatized by all of the very scary scenes of grizzlies, snakes, near drownings etc....",1363910400,,800,4.652482269503546

Highly recommended for family viewing. *Edit* After reading some of the negative reviews I'd like to add that this film by no means glorifies cruelty to animals. There is just no way that any of the scenes required the deaths of any animals. As another reviewer noted, all of the scenes people complain about use very careful editing to create a heightened sense of danger. That being said, this movie does capture a wide range of emotions and it probably went a step too far in placing Milo in a couple of fear-inducing situations. In that sense this movie could never be made today - but that is no reason not to enjoy what has been captured on film here.",1358294400,,990,4.5055555555555555

Or the more plausible scenario is that the cat is tossed off the cliff which again is not ok in any way, shape, or form. Oh but they seemed to have ""lived"" through the scene huh???

374266,3,6301817761,"I remember this movie when I was a kid & it was one of my favorites.  For the most part, it still is.  I am an animal lover & there are parts that are questionable.  However, with no actual proof, its up to the people watching to judge for themselves whether or not animals were physically harmed in the making of this film.
  For all those people yelling about the movie's standards, u still need to remember when this movie was made.  There were different standards back in 1986 than there are now.  There was technology available back in those days that could simulate some of the more distasteful scenes in this movie so u cant just ignore that, just like other people cant ignore the possibility that animals may have been hurt.
  I personally think that these animals were trained and raised together to limit the amount of harm in the 'fight' scenes & that no animals were intentional hurt or killed.  For example, that bear coulda killed either Milo or Otis in an instant if it wanted to.  Anybody who watches the animal channel can tell u that.
  Granted, we know better to do that now because we have an additional 20+ yrs of research that does show how even when raised together & even with trainers & the best of care, that things can happen.  For example; that event at SeaWorld with the Orca killing its trainer.  The trainer & the Orca had training for many many years.  Is it possible, the Orca's killer nature kicked in for whatever reason? Yes.  But at the same time, it could have been very well trying to playing with her.  It's not like the Orca would have known that she couldn't go down that far.  I mean, really, if that Orca wanted to harm her, it could have just ate her.  Instead, it grabbed her arm & just swam too far down. It didn't break her arm or even try to eat it.
  Anyhow, back to the movie, for its time & the standards held back then, overall, I would like to think the movie was done tastefully, although they did flirt with the line a few times.
  Also, for all you people who complain about how the story line sucked at the end when Milo & Otis finally gets re-united & then Otis gets ignored by Milo, get over it.  We humans do stuff like that all the time.  Friendships end over a woman.  At least in this story, although they go their seperate ways for a while, to pursue what is in their nature to pursue (since only humans do it by choice & for fun), they get re-united again & their friendship is re-kindled.  Thats more than I can say for most humans.  People grow & people change.  Why should it be any different with animals??
  For those of you who say Homeward Bound is better, what about when Shadow falls into that hole at the end of the movie?? We think he's dead but then he comes limping back.  That could be animal cruelty too. I don't hear any of you yelling about that.

374270,5,6301817761,"This is one of those childhood spectacles that makes young and old alike feel so warm and cuddly inside.  I remember watching this as a toddler and up, sitting in my grandfather's basement and just soaking in this delightful little tale of a young kitten and his best friend; a pug-dog named Otis.  Yes, my adoration of dogs in general fueled my affections for the film, and as a child that was all that mattered to me (awww, they are so cute), but as an adult there is even more to be impressed with here.  Taking four years to make, director Masanori Hata really took his time to develop a story that felt honest and earnest, while allowing these two little creatures (unassisted by human voices, unless you count the narration) to speak volumes through their heroic play and general loveliness.  It may not be a complicated concept, but it is one that works wonders thanks to detailed and refined direction that shapes this beautiful family film into one for the ages.  It also works because within the simple story there are layers of emotional complexities shared, emotions that transcend mere child's-play or `animal-play' but reach the human heart.  This is a tale of friendship and loyalty and love.  As one reviewer mentioned, this is a celebration of life!  This movie is, without a doubt, something special.  And, to all of those reviewers barking about this being a sick movie because animals were obviously distressed and hurt (some even suggested `killed'), you should do a little more research before making such a blanket statement, especially when that said statement is made in light of information that has NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.  Sure, allegations abound here, and yes the film was not made in the states, but your perception of what you see on the screen is never what really happened (it's a movie, so they can make it look like anything happened) and one should never believe everything they read online.",1313020800,,1924,4.803030303030303

The film made me cringe - I was uncomfortable and felt worse for watching it.  If you can throw a cat off a cliff into the water, let it get attacked by sea gulls, and let a pug almost die in the snow all to just catch the perfect scene then, yeah, the abuse probably went further.

374308,1,6301817761,"First of all, my toddler absolutely loves this movie. It's cute, it's sort of funny and engaging, and.... it's full of animal cruelty. (I bought it second hand, so my money went to the consignment shop and not the movie makers, thank goodness.) I started to really think about it after watching it over and over and now I can't get past it. Whether or not any animals were actually hurt or killed while filming, their discomfort and anxiety was utterly unnecessary and I'm rather appalled at how often it is evident. Inflicting pain, be it physical or mental anguish, is ABUSE. Any pet owner will know it when they see it here. I'm not going to list all the examples from the film. They are numerous. I think the worst, though, is subjecting the cat to the angry seagulls and throwing it off a cliff. It is such a random part of the story and it's like they just threw it in for shocking action. And I HATE the part when they leave the dog on a rock with the tide coming in. That dog is utterly terrified. It's all just sick and wrong.
I'm on the fence about whether or not to let my son continue to watch it. It's not plainly visible abuse. There isn't a bad message about mistreating animals; there are no people in the movie. But these animals were mistreated during filming and that bothers my conscience. I don't think my son will be ""damaged"" by this film, but the fact that the animals in it probably were makes it impossible for me to enjoy with him.",1289865600,,1458,4.344322344322344

I really would not buy this movie for any child!!

Animals were treated  badly and killed!!!!!!!!!

A little grafic!! YOU WILL ACTUALLY SEE THE CAT AND DOG GIVE BIRTH. I wonder if they were harmed in other movies as well!!

Homeward Bound is MUCH MUCH BETTER!!!",1273276800,,685,4.491935483870968
374312,5,6301817761,"I have always loved this movie.  A cute dog and a cute cat, its the perfect basis for a charming film.  Filmed in Japanese, Milo and Otis has been re narrated in English by Dudley Moore (he plays every characters so if you don't like him, don't watch) and also had English music added.  The music is warm and folksy and perfectly fits the movie.  The cinematography is great.  In fact, it took four years for them to film this since they were working with live animals.

It starts out on a small farm where a litter of kittens is being born.  Milo is one of those kittens.  From the very beginning he is always getting himself in trouble and is very eager to explore the world around him.  He makes friends with Otis, a pug puppy who also lives on the farm.  Together they have adventures, play games, and generally make a nuisance of themselves.

One day, Milo takes it too far.  Playing hide n' seek in a box in the river, the box becomes detached and starts traveling down the fast moving water.  It travels a long way from the farm, with Otis trailing behind to try to save his friend.

The adventure officially begun, the two animals must overcome many hardships to be reunited.  They meet several wild animals, some friendly, some not.  Milo just tries to survive while Otis searches for him.

When they are finally reunited, something else comes along to break them apart.  However, as it is not life ending, they are able to overcome it and become the best of friends, traveling to get back home.

There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie.  Claims of animal cruelty and animal death to make the movie abound.  Having searched the web, I came to the conclusion that this can be neither proved nor disproved.  Also, one must look at what actually animal cruelty is.  A lot of people are upset about the scene between Milo and the crab, however, the director did not make the crab pinch him, they were two animals doing what came naturally.  Also, there are complaints about the animals being distressed.  I wonder if these same people complain about horses in distress in war movies that are made where the whites of their eyes are showing and they are forced onto the ground in mock battle.  I'm not advocating animal cruelty or its use in movies, but I think its a very fine line to judge this movie as so.  Until its proven, I believe the movie should be judged on its merits, not what people think happened to the animals.  Innocent until proven guilty.  And now I'll step off my soapbox.

Suitability for very young children could also be questioned.  There are live scenes of both a  cat and a dog giving birth in the movie.  The camera doesn't cut away, but instead shows one of each animal being born.  This might  be disturbing for some young viewers, however, more likely it will inspire loads of questions for mom and dad.  While it wouldn't bother me to show it to my future children, some parents may want to be handy with the fast forward button.

Since I was a child this movie has been one of my favorites.  The way they filmed these animals was incredible and I always enjoy watching it again to reminisce.",1270252800,,3147,4.475352112676056
374313,3,6301817761,"I would like to give this film more stars, as there are myriad adorable scenes in the film that brought a smile to my face. My husband and I enjoyed many aspects of the film to begin with, but as the film unfolded, we became increasingly disturbed by multiple scenes and ""enactments"" which we personally would not dream of subjecting our own cat or dog to, for ANY reason, animal handler involvement or no. Speaking as casual movie viewers, we couldn't help but speculate that much of what was filmed (in Europe or Japan?) in 1986, could not and would not be considered acceptable and/or legal in the film industry today. Theoretically speaking, other viewers and fans of the movie (perhaps within the context of their trusting the animal trainers/handlers) might feel perfectly loving putting their own pets through scenes that frankly disturbed us and occasionally horrified us. To each his/her own.

Here's my ""pros and cons"" list on this film:

Pros:

- General animal charm and ""cuteness"" caught on film, at times combined with cinematic natural beauty
- Scenes with the cat and dog playing together, other assorted playful scenes with animals
- Scenes with the cat and dog cuddling/napping together, and cute scenes of the cat cuddling/napping with the following animals: a baby deer, a piglet, a family of pigs, and a cow.
- Scene with a fox and pug playing together
- Myriad scenes I enjoyed that appeared to me to be harmless and un-distressing to the animals being filmed

Cons:

- Sending a cat down a river in a box, through rapids, and down a waterfall.
- Throwing a cat over a cliff into the ocean.
- Placing a tiny pug and a young black bear in the water together to ""enact"" a fight scene.
- Allowing a cat on a cliff to be attacked by a flock of seagulls
- Stranding a distressed pug on a tiny rock in the ocean, surrounded by rising tide
- Placing a cat in a tree with a snake
- Placing a frightened cat in a tree with a black bear
- Obviously the crab biting the cat's face hurt, no doubt, but personally, I think it paled next to some of the above scenes.
- There were other smaller scenes that generally made me wince in empathy for the animal ""actors"".

In conclusion, if you don't like the sound of the ""cons"" section above, I'd recommend checking out a film like ""Babe"", it's a delight, and I don't recall ever feeling disturbed or questioning the animals treatment by handlers while viewing it. I haven't seen ""Homeward Bound"" so I can't recommend it, although I've noticed it being mentioned by folks that found ""Milo and Otis"" objectionable.

I do find it interesting how polarized and heated the comments are surrounding this movie, as well as the ""was this review helpful or not"" votes. There is clearly a heated war amongst viewers as to whether the filming process was distressful or cruel to the animal ""actors"".",1267401600,,2843,4.606719367588933

They do a number of cruel things to the creatures in here.

That cat is unhappy and frightened,you can tell by the tone of his meows,and its a real cat w/a real voice ....

374367,1,6301817761,"There are rumors about this movie saying 20 cats were killed and a cat's paw was broken to make it limp in a scene. I don't know if those rumors are true or not. What I DO know is that animals were tortured to make this movie.

1. In order for Otis to rescue Milo from a bear, the film makers put the little dog and a bear cub together and filmed whatever would happen. The cub seemed to want to play with the dog. It would take it's large paws and swat at it, knocking the dog around like it was a stuffed animal. Keep in mind, even though it was a bear cub, it could break the dog's back like it was a twig. The bear may not have been mean, but the whole scene was an accident waiting to happen. It is incredibly irresponsible to put a little dog in this situation. And the dog was NOT enjoying it. If you watch his body language, he was scared to death and fighting for his life.

2. A cat is put in a box and sent down a river. If you watch the movie, there are several moments when the box looks like it will come to shore and the cat would be able to jump out. But that's when they cut the tape and push the cat back out so that it can plummet down a waterfall. In the footage they show, the cat survived. But...that's in the footage that made it in the movie. I would hate to see the outtakes.

3. They put the cat in a tree with a snake. Maybe the snake wasn't poisonous. Maybe the snake wouldn't bite the cat. But the cat clearly did not know this and it was scared to death. I do not agree that any animal should be put in a state of fear for the sake of making a movie. If an animal is used for a movie, any ""acting"" it does should be something the animal enjoys doing.

4. They throw the cat down a deep hole.

5. They throw the cat off a cliff into water below near large rocks with big waves crashed on them. First of all, anybody that throws a cat off anything should be arrested and locked away. There is absolutely NO excuse for this. Second, the person that threw the cat into the water could easily have missed and the cat could have landed on the rocks. Third, even after the cat survives the fall, it panics and tries to climb back up the cliff, only to fall back into the water and have a giant wave crash onto it, slamming it into the rocks. This is ALL ON FILM! It is NOT a rumor. They even narrated for it! After the cat falls again the narrator goes ""Oops! Try try again!"" in a cute way as if this cruel display was in any way cute.

6. They put the cat in a tree and send the bear cub up after it. Very similar to the scene with the snake. The cat is scared to death.

There's also a scene where they stick the cat in a smokestack. The cat pokes his head out and he's practically blinded by the smoke and ash. I can only imagine what went into his lungs.

I really can't believe all the positive reviews for this movie. I can only hope that the defenders of this trash do not have pets.",1259280000,,2913,3.942176870748299

374369,1,6301817761,"Started watching this this morning with my toddler. Everyone on the farm... cute cute... pleasant Dudley Moore voice. Whimsical, adorable - but what have we here? cats falling into rushing water? A cat getting its face attacked by a crab? A dog getting dunked by a bear? I go online and watch the outtakes - scenes that were deleted from the US version but shown in Japan. That director threw a cat off a cliff into the rushing water of the ocean. Even if he released the rest of the footage (i.e., the footage that didn't make it into the Japanese version, the takes they didn't use), that would not exonerate him of animal cruelty, because it is in the film plain to see. I guess what's equally disturbing is how so many US audience members exonerate him automatically on the basis that this is a children's film released by Columbia, that it was Dudley Moore's voice, or that the director was a zoologist. All those things can be true, co-existing with the truth that the director put cats and dogs in danger and caused them pain for this film. There is no logical reason why the quality of Dudley Moore's character or Columbia film's judgment or the director's profession would mean that cruelty could not have happened. My logical argument for the fact that there was cruelty in this film is that the original version of the film shows a cat being tossed off a cliff into the ocean, scrambling back up the rocks, and falling back in the ocean as he loses his footing. This was done with no special effects and any animal who had this happen would be frightened for its life, as well as at great risk for injury or death. People may hold various opinions about whether animal cruelty is a problem or not, but it is very clear that instances of violence against animals exist in this film. It is actually amazing that people are still debating the presence of animal cruelty in this film as if it were a question at all.",1256688000,,1923,4.497142857142857

I know a lot of users made comments about ""20+ kittens died"" in the making of this film, but I did a lot of research and couldn't find anything that supported these claims.  In fact, the Humane Society approved this film, and so did several other Japanese animal protection organizations.  The film wasn't shot like a similar US film would be shot.  Instead, the photographers lived on an island with about 300 animals and watched them interact over 4 years, creating more than 400,000 feet of footage between all of the photographers.  The film was pieced together from this footage.  Some of it was staged, like Otis riding on the turtle, but virtually all the film was candid.  Milo was played by 27 different kittens, but this is because cats age quickly (anyone who has had one knows they change completely in a matter of weeks), not because the kittens were killed in production.

""When the film was first released, several Australian animal rights organizations raised allegations of animal cruelty during filming and called for a boycott. The Sunday Mail reported at the time that Animal Liberation Queensland founder Jacqui Kent alleged the killing of more than 20 kittens during production and added that she was disturbed by reports from Europe which alleged other animals had been injured, as in one case, where a producer allegedly had broken a cat's paw to make it appear unsteady on its feet. Kent said her organization had a number of complaints from people who had seen the film and were concerned that it could not have been made without cruelty.[1] The Tasmanian and Victorian branches of the RSPCA also alleged abuses.[2]

The film was reported to have the approval of the American Humane Society, despite not having their officers present during filming.[3]

The American Humane Association attempted to investigate cruelty rumors through ""contacts in Europe who normally have information on movies throughout the world."" While noting that the contacts had also heard the allegations, they were unable to verify it as being true. The organization also reported, ""we have tried through humane people in Japan, and through another Japanese producers to determine if these rumors are true but everything has led to a dead end.""[4]

374466,4,6301817761,"As a kid I used to love this movie. I still like it. But there are three scenes that make me wonder if there wasn't real animal abuse going on. First is the bear and Otis fighting in the river. BOTH animals could have drowned and maybe one or more did when you consider Otis' size and that the bear's mouth looks glued shut. Then there is the scene where Milo gets pecked by seagulls and thrown from the cliff. This one used to really bother me when I was a kid. Looking at it now it's clear no seagull touched a cat and the cliff-jump was from a much shorter distance than I recall. Super slo-mo makes it look a lot worse than it really was. Lastly there is the scene with Otis on the rock in the rough ocean. For the 1st minute it's  one dog then the water calms and the tortoise comes it's a different dog on the rock. I always wondered what happened to the first dog.
I'm sure the makers of this movie did not intend to purposely harm any animals and I do not belive the reports of 29 Milos or 10 Otises dying, but neither do I believe the director when he says no animals were harmed or Otis and the bear were friends and just playing. There are scenes where the animals are obviously in distress but for the most part they go with the story.
Much of this could be moviemaking magic. I used to be convinced(along with many others) that the guy in the Ben-Hur chariot scene really died in real life, turns out it was seamless editing.
All in all this is still a great movie but I'll withhold a fifth star until a ""Special Edition"" with the original version and a truthful documentary comes out.",1231632000,,1598,4.188311688311688
374467,3,6301817761,"I only watched about 30 minutes of this, with two very young girls, one of whom wanted me to turn it away due to the fear of Milo and Otis's separation at one point (it really wasn't that traumatic, btw, but just relaying what happened).

In any case, suffice to say this is not a movie that could be made today or was made ""without hurting any animals"". The story is a heavily narrated thing overlaid over animals that are doing what animals do, which is to say their handlers (you can even see one at one point) put them in strange situations and film it as if it's actual acting.

I found a few parts where Milo was clearly under genuine duress: 1) Fell/pushed (who knows) into a stream where he swims and his mom chases him down. Cats don't like water! 2) A part where the handlers put him next to a crab to play with, it latches onto his nose, and he tries to get it off. Clearly, that hurt. 3) His handlers put him on a tree next to a bird that's distressed, squaking, trying to scare him away from its chicks. He ends up hitting it with his paw several times as the thing tries to ward him off.

There was a part with Otis ""fighting"" a bear in the water, but I wonder if in fact he was basically drowning/panicked in real life.

All very strange. Obviously a lot of people like this movie, but it was just a tiny bit weird. A lot of cute closeups but something about the movie just seemed anachronistic.",1228780800,,1410,4.191881918819188
374468,5,6301817761,"""Milo and Otis"" must have taken a lot to put together. There is so much they have all the animals doing and interacting with. There's all of Milo's hiding places on the farm, Milo's adventures down waterfalls and off cliffs, Otis' struggle with a bear, Otis' ride on the back of a turtle during high tide. How did they manage it all? A friend who I was watching with suggested the turtle wasn't real when it was shown being ridden on. I don't know about that myself, I think it's hard to say...

The story is of Milo the cat and Otis the dog, who grow up as kitten and puppy on the farm, helping look after the chickens' eggs and playing hide and seek among other things. One of Milo's hiding places is a box on the river, but this ends up drifting downstream, with Milo helpless inside. Otis follows Milo, and during the adventures to come back together and get back to the farm, they both grow up a lot.

Dudley Moore does the narration, and I think he does a charming job, and helps make the funny moments funnier. The beginning of the film is a lot faster paced than I remember when I was a kid in the cinema, which was surprising. It's interesting to hear how Dudley keeps up with all the farm scenes coming one after the other. I love the scenery out in the wild too, with it's rivers and forests and greenery. I'd love to visit wherever it was they filmed.",1221523200,,1363,4.258687258687258
374469,5,6301817761,"I bought this for my son, and when he saw the front cover he immediatly wanted to see it. He simply referred to it as just Otis he has a hard time saying Milo for some reason. I was very happy I bought it, and that he wanted to watch it with me since normally he only wants to watch cartoon DVD's. My long-term memory could only pick up a yellow kitten floating in a box down a river, so I must admit I was just as excited to watch it again for the first time in over a decade.

When I finished watching it I thought wow this is a really great movie. I read that it took 4 years to make, and I could see why every scene was absolutely perfect. The so-called ""animal abuse"" in this film should be overlooked, because animals on farms do have to deal with things like this, and the bear was obviously a trained animal, and he never hurt the dog or cat. I did feel kind of bad at first for the cat when he went down the waterfall, but I don't think he was really in there they had to have did some kind of trick, because I'm sure the cat would have fallen out and drowned if they hadn't.

I won't spoil the end but I just think it was so cute, and this is a great movie for kids of all ages, especially toddlers because they get to see all the farm animals. My son just laughed and laughed at the ""doggie"" and ""kitty"", especially when Otis fell in this little hole.

374509,4,6301817761,"The sheer amount of one star reviews gurgling about animal cruelty is just ridiculous!

First of all there is no such thing as the ""AMERICAN HUMAN SOCIETY"" so anyone saying such an organization claims that at least 29 Milos died is just allowing themselves to be misled! The American HumanE Society has never released any such statement, in fact, they have not even reviewed Milo and Otis at all! If you want to argue with me about this then find me the review!
here is a video review from Ebert and Roeper in which they further debunks these statements:

[...]

Anyone who keeps going on and on about how such technology did not exist in 1986 therefore logically concluding that cruelty must have occurred: unless you have studied film making and the history of film making or are a professional in the industry, you cannot make such claims, you really have no proof at all except your own opinions!

For everyone crying about the bear brutalizing Otis: Masanori Hata has interviewed with journalist Margo Kaufman of Pug World and stated that the bear cub and the Otis puppy used in that scene had been raised together and were friends. In that scene they were just playing and messing around.

About the cliff: I have so far seen people describe this cliff as 200ft, 100ft, 50ft, 20ft and 10ft! People are just sitting around making up numbers! No one has any actual proof about how tall the cliff was. No one has proof about whether the cat chose to jump or was tossed and whether the cat jumped off of that particular cliff or if the image of the cat jumping was edited or whatnot. no one has proof whether cats died. people are literally sitting around, making things up working themselves up into an outraged state and then screaming about it on the internet!

For the people who say that the 'no animals were harmed' tag is missing: I'm not a lawyer for this Milo and Otis movie and I don't know what the tagging standards are for animal movies. it is possible that they did not include this tag because two animals WERE indirectly harmed/killed. The fish Milo catches with his tail and the field mouse that the owl grabs. And possibly the scene where milo is messing with he crab and his cheek gets pinched. it is wrong to assume that 10/20/29 milos died and 9-20 otises drowned just because of a missing tag. You must do actual research, call Fuji Television Network, call Columbia Pictures, call Masanori Hata, call Mark Saltzman, call the American Humane Society! Don't just rely on some nitwits freaking out on the internet and for goodness sakes don't keep propagating unverified rumors!

If you have not done research and have actual proof you should not be running around writing things like this because it will ruin the movie for other people! When I first heard 20 Milos were killed I was devastated! Imagine how many other people are being hurt and hating this movie because of rumors like this?

The only reason why I am not giving this DVD 5 stars is because I wanted to see the original 90 minute Japanese version and it is not included in this disk, nor is there a Japanese track or subtitles.",1199577600,,3116,4.591726618705036

Also, i think it's horrible the message sent across with Milo and Otis... it's supposed to be a movie of ultimate friendship.. but then a girl comes along and milo forgets all about otis?? that's rediculous.. you shouldnt leave your friends for some girl you don't know at all... it's like leaving your best friend for some hot girl you just met and know nothing at all. sure they come back together nearing the end of winter when otis is strugling to find food, but milo seems unconcerned as he gives otis the food and doesn't offer to help him take the food to his starving family... i don't know, maybe i'm looking into the movie too deep.. but it's full of abuse and bad messages sent out to me.",1199491200,,1132,4.221198156682028

I am absolutely horrified that Dudley Moore did the voices for the Americanized version. The horror starts with the baby chick hatching out and being mauled by the kitten and moved on to the poor kitten ""jumping(?)"" from a cliff, a dog being frozen, and mauled by a bear.  The scene where the kitten moves through seagulls and is pecked is incredibly scary.  As an animal lover and a bird feeder, I hand feed seagulls frequently, believe me a peck by a seagull is no laughing matter and certainly not cute! I accidentally saw this flick while in a vacation rental and it looked like it would be a cute flick but BEWARE and stay away.  My stomach and my heart are still aching.

Well he certainly did love it, laughing his head off, dancing around, and immitating the animals.

I thought it was kind of cute at first too... until I really got into the story and started noticing that the poor little animal ""actors"" were being repetedly placed in precarious situations that no animal handler in their right mind would make any animal do under these circumstances.  And for those who chide ""special effects"", well it really doesn't take a degree to figure out that this movie has the special effects budget of my last home movie = $0.

One of most anxious scenes for me was when Milo the cat was looking for a meal and thought maybe a seagull egg nesting in a rocky cliff overlooking the coast might make a good meal.  So the next thing we see here's this poor little cat cowering and dodging for his life as a flock of seagulls (each one twice the size of the cat) defend their nests with swoops and pecks from everyside.  But the only thing the terrified cat can supposedly do to get away is to leap off the cliff into the pounding surf 30-40 feet below, and must then swim to safety (and you can tell it is definiely a real live cat doing the entire ""stunt"".)

Like other reviewers, I was a little disturbed by the cliff scene, knowing that it was most likely staged for the film (unlike the other scenes which are normal scrapes into which kittens find themselves).  But, the cat was fine and it didn't frighten my toddler (who is easily frightened).

374643,3,6301817761,"Warning: Gives away the plot of the movie.

Yes, Milo and Otis is very cute and well done as many reviewers have said.  I was enjoying it until near the end.

As far as the animal treatment controversy, i think the reviewer below pretty well debunks most of these concerns. Even in the 80s and earlier trick photography could do some pretty amazing things, as anyone who  has seen many 70s horror films can attest.  I doubt any real harm was done to these animals. On the other hand, I am not sure standards in Japan in the 80s were what we would now expect, so I just have to reserve judgement.

My complaint is one most people won't care about, but I do; the movie's  heterosexism. Now I hate to be in turn a homosexist;  I do not mean to disparage marriage or raising children in any way, because I do not feel that way. I also hate to take a simple children's story and make it so darn controversial. HOWEVER,

For the first 3/4 of the movie  Milo and Otis is about male friendship, bonding, and heroism for each other. Then out of the blue appears ""Joyce"" who has absolutely nothing to offer Milo, as far as he can be aware,  other than being female. Otis, who just saved Milo's life, is out the window.  Milo doesn't care. Otis is devastated and goes off into the bitter cold snowy mountains, possibly to die. Is that a message to send kids - dump your closest buddy who saved you just for a girl?  I am not suggesting that Miloe and Otis were ""gay""  but this kind of hetero supremacy would do James Dobson proud.

Then it gets worse:  Otis, out in the mountain, meets a girl-dog, and now he ""understands what came over Milo.""  This about made me  turn the thing off.

I think it is fine to make a movie about animals getting married and having cute kittens and puppies - i am all for it, but this ended up totally negating the whole feeling of the first hour of the movie. It should have evolved differently and without such total disregard for each other.  In the end, the deep bond between Milo and Otis, which I thought was what this movie was about, ends up being trivialized.",1151280000,,2087,4.302564102564102

The rumor of animal abuse that hangs over this film is worrisome, but it's never been substantiated as far as I've read; without any damning evidence I don't think it's wrong to watch and enjoy a warm-hearted family movie made many years ago.

Kids should see movies like this, not just because it keeps them quiet while the parents can have a rest, but so they can have something to remember their best years of life.

But anyway......

When I was younger this was my favorite movie of all time, and it's lost nothing as I got older.  It is so sweet, and even heartbreaking at times without being cloyingly cutesy, even adults can watch it without exasperation (unlike homeward bound).  I love how Milo and Otis obviously love each other and were raised together, rather than the filmaker trying to invent a love that isn't there.  As to people complaining about the 'love interest,'  I think it's comletely justified since the movie follows the animals from birth to adulthood.

374670,5,6301817761,"....killed in this film is a retard, that thing about 20 cats being killed is a rumour that was bred by paranoia and ignorance. I can say that this film is amazing in what they accomplished with these animals and Dudley Moore is awesome as the narrator, but the editing was kind of awkward which is understandable when you are piecing fragments of non-cohesive shots. i watched this becuase it is a remarkable achievement as a film. but really, everything that you see in the film is a very basic, and usually very obvious, camera trick made to allude that it was more ""dangerous"" than it realy was. first off, the japanese man who made this owns a farm and is a devote animal lover so I strongly doubt he would have allowed an animal to be killed. Also, its a trivia fact that ONLY 4 cats were used this film and that was only to show an age progression. really, their was no assembly line of death in this movie. So lets break down the ""stunts"" in the film.

1. the scene where the pug and bear ""fight"". The bear in this film was obviously domesticated and was really only playing rough with the dog because by nature, bears play rough. the dog was only slapped on his hind by the bear and not even scratched because it was not an attack, it was play that was meant to look like one with the magic of editing. He did get dunked in the water a few times though which was kind of funny.

2. the box scene where the cat drops off a waterfall. the cat coudnt have been injured. the fall was made to look bigger than it really was with the use of the camera and really coudnt have been more than five feet, and cats are very limber and can sustain a much greater fall than that on solid ground.

3. Seagulls pecking the cat? I didn't see a single seagull even touch the cat. the cat was just running around all erratic to make the situation look really distressing. One gull lifted his wings up to stand his ground from the cat, that was pretty much it.

4. Now the big one, the cliff drop. If you look at the actual shot, you will notice the cat really only fell about a quarter of the way into the ocean but was filmed in a way to suggest that he had fallen from the top.

5. heres a funny one, one person actually believed that the fish really bit the cats tail which is really laughable. the fish that you saw being dragged by the cat was a dead fish prop attached to the cats tail, and then was replaced with a live fish flopping on the ground in the next shot. this film must have been exhausting to make.

6. oh yeah, the crab that pinched the cats cheek. well...ok, that was real. you got me that time. even though that crab was smaller than a baby kitten and could not have broken through his skin.

7. Were they psychologically harmed? doubtful. the average cat or dog owner does far more psychologically damaging things to their pet, you strap a leash on them. you confine them to your backyards. put them in cages to transport them like cargo. really, its a subjective viewpoint.

You know how I know that animals were really looked after intensely when this was made? because the editing is clumsy as hell. If they really were at a complete disregard for animal safety, then they could have gotten these shots to flow much easier and it wouldnt have taken them four years to make it.
If there are any more that i missed, you could probably figure them out for yourself if you stop watching it in such an emotional state and look at it like a film. I suppose the reason they did not include the message ""no animals were harmed...."" is becuase that was not the standard in 1980's Japan at the time, and instead the message ""all animals were treated under the care of supervisors with regard to their safety...etc."" was used instead. trust me, i watched the entire film with every allegation that people have made about it in mind and would be surprised if any animal was even injured in the making of this film.",1142553600,,3919,4.293640054127199

Lessons include: stick up for your friends, help them, if you have to be separated it's alright, you might meet up again, how to deal with a friend in love and always perservere.

They did throw a stuffed cat off a cliff, and it did look like Milo, but its not. Also, it may have looked like Otis was being bitten by the bear, but he wasn't. The beat and pug were raised that way.

The movie is great. Its about a kitten named Milo and a puppy named Otis. They meet at birth, and they play as babies. Milo always gets into trouble, and Otis always saves him. One day during hide and seek, Milo hides in a box that is tied to a dock by the river. The rope gets loose and Milo, still in the box, gets swept down the river. Otis, the pug, tries to stop the box but to no avail. Otis goes in search of Milo, while Milo fights bears and tries to get some food. Eventually, Milo falls into a pit, and Otis finds him and saves him.

On the way back to the farm, they meet a girl cat named Joyce. Milo falls in love, and Otis, feeling lonesome, leaves Milo and Joyce. Otis meets a female dog named Sandra. Soon, Milo and Otis, who were both seperated now, had kittens and puppies. Otis eventually meets Milo again, and in the spring, Milo and Otis's two families meet, and they return to the farm.

I had to post a review after reading the insane remarks posted by other reviewers of Milo and Otis.  For one thing, animals are much, much more akin to being in ""adventurous"" situations such as going down raging rapids and leaping off cliffs than we humans imagine.  No, mental torture is not possible on the animals performing in this great kids film.  My Kevin is a prominent tree climber and also proficient at falling out of them.  Should I simply film one of his ""adventures"" for my entertainment later, that would make me guilty of animal cruelty?  Don't forget, you animal rights activists, those animal actors enjoy a much higher salary than you'll ever make and a life of plush living like that on MTV's CRIBS.  Stop thinking you can save the world with your ""holier than thou"" attitude as though no one has the compassion for animals that you do.  And especially don't insist on thinking all children are as dumb as you are as an adult to think they will abuse a living animal because they watched the ""Adventures of Milo and Otis.""

374740,1,6301817761,"This would be a great movie for kids if it weren't for the fact that one or more cats were abused and almost certainly killed in the making of it. If you must watch it, check out the scene where they really throw an actual cat off of an actual cliff. It's pretty horrifying, and it's edited so that you have no idea if the cat really survived, or if they just grabbed a new one and kept filming. Also, check out the disclaimer in the end credits. It says ""animals were under close supervision with utmost concern for their safety"". Notice it takes great pains not to say ""no animals were harmed"", which has been boilerplate language for movie animal disclaimers for decades. What does this tell you? Wouldn't they say ""no animals were harmed"" if none were? Even if that cat survived, throwing it off a cliff into water, into what looks like breaking ocean surf if memory serves me, is unspeakably cruel. I'm sorry to all the fans of this movie who don't want to believe this. I wish I could see it another way, too. I agree with you that it's very well made and enjoyable in so many ways. But the moviemakers' disregard for their animals' well-being ruined this for me. Please don't support this sort of thing with your money.

P.S. I am not a PETA member nor am I a vegetarian (not that there's anything wrong with either of those). I believe that using animals for human benefit is good and necessary as long as it is not done cruelly. And that said, I don't really have any problems with this movie apart from the fact that they threw a cat off a cliff into the ocean, and probably killed it. How anyone can endorse this film for children after seeing that is beyond me.

P.P.S. To Douglas Custer.
In your review you write: 'animals are much, much more akin to being in ""adventurous"" situations such as going down raging rapids and leaping off cliffs than we humans imagine'.

I agree with you here. But there's a difference between a cat climbing a tree on its own and falling out (as you mention your cat does), and a cat being thrown off a cliff into the ocean, as they did for the enjoyment of moviegoers and the profit of the producers of this film.

You also wrote: 'No, mental torture is not possible on the animals performing in this great kids film.'

I can't see any way to agree with you here. Anyone who's ever been around abused animals can see the effect it has on them, and not all abuse is physical.",1106438400,,2418,4.364444444444445

This is a simple but timeless story of adventure and friendship. Milo the mischievous kitten and Otis the pug puppy are best friends. Otis even pursues his friend when he's carried down the river after jumping into a wooden box. Soon, both of them are lost as well as separated from each other. The adventures they have with other animals are amazing, numerous and varied. They interact with a bear cub, raccoon, fox, seagulls, a turtle, a fawn and many others. The interactions will amaze you -- I couldn't believe a pug was riding on a turtle's back!

The footage is incredible, and does make one worry about the animals. While the director has said that the animals were raised together and are friends, and this is believable, it cannot account for the cat  being attacked by seagulls and later falling from a very high cliff into the ocean. This troubles me.

After some research, I discovered that an American version of this movie was available with narration by the late, great Dudley Moore.
While Dudley Moore's narration is charming and informative, I found the movie to be terribly misleading. Cats and dogs do not like each other - never have, never will.

A cat in search of a lost dog? A dog in search of a lost cat? Forgive me while I scoff in disbelief.
It's movies like ""The Adventures of Milo and Otis"" that give children ideas about how to rebel against society. Milo tells us that it's okay to jump on a raft and get swept down a set of treacherous rapids. Otis tells us that it's okay to confront ferocious grizzly bears, and that a cute little wag of the tail will make everything alright.

The scenery and cinemetography are wonderful - even spellbinding, but nowhere in the credits does it say where it is filmed.  If it's Japan, then Japan has a wonderfully northwestern European look to it.  The ""river"" looks so cool and refreshing that I often wondered how refreshing a drink from it might be.

Beautiful scenery aside, it's obvious to the adults that most of it is contrived.  There really aren't any farms anymore that have ""all the animals.""  And let's face it, a sea turtle just doesn't ""stop by"" to let a dog ride on it's back.  But again, in the child's perpective, it's wonderfully casual.

For the adults, Duddly Moore's narration is a bit annoying sometimes, but it is, after all, directed at kids.  My two year old insists on watching it at least twice a day (for now - past obsessions include Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life), so I suppose it worked as planned, and I've sat through it at least four or five times myself.

One other reviewer mentioned the possible animal abuse.  The film credits do indeed say that the animals were closely supervised, but that didn't stop them from being their own, unwitting ""stunt men.""  I don't think anything amounted to animal abuse, and I certainly don't think any died.  Although they pushed the limits by throwing a cat off a small cliff into the sea!  It wasn't harmed, and the cat swam to shore and shook it off pretty easily.  Still...

Parents will see the bittersweet nature of the ending.  Sure, Milo & Otis go home.  But they never ""go home.""  Who can?  By the end of the movie, their happy childhood is spent, so even getting back to the farm will not restore them to their first innocence.

But anyway, it's fun to see the animals go their ways and make friends.  Overall, it's a delightful movie and a cool DVD.",988761600,,467,4.458823529411765
374858,5,6301817761,"The Adventures of Milo and Otis is one of my favorite movies.  I like it because it is about animals, and I like animals.  Well, a cat named Milo meets a dog named Otis, and weird enogh become best friends.  Their favorite game is Hide'n Seek.  Milo finds a box in the river, jumps in and floats away.  Otis tries to save him but just them farther and farther down stream.  So with that, an adventure begins.  You should go out and watch this movie, because it's great!!!",987033600,,471,4.284090909090909
374877,4,6301817761,"This is a movie portraying the special friendship of a cat, Milo, and a dog, Otis, which stays true from when they a puppy and kitten until the very end.  Milo is a mischievious cat who is always getting into some sort of trouble, and Otis is the brave pug who is always there to look after Milo.  The adventures of Milo eventually lead to separation between the two, and Otis is there to find and rescue him.  Milo's everlasting confidence and Otis's continually worried expression contribute to the movie as well.  And we can learn a lesson about friendship from Milo and Otis; true friends stick together and help each other out through thick and thin.
As a child, I enjoyed this movie and found it very entertaining.  I was sad when the two friends were separated so long, but there were lots of hilarious episodes that balanced things out.  As one reviewer pointed out, the fact that there are no humans in the movie makes it more attractive to kids, and probably adults too.
One concern of several viewers is the possibility of animal abuse which decreases the quality of the movie.  It says somewhere though that the animals were well supervised, which is reassuring.  As for the chance of casualties, perhaps the animals were slightly injured at one time or another, but I don't believe any died.  That's a little extreme.  How is it possible to find more than one identical cat like Milo or dog like Otis that is the same in looks and brains.  My family has had four pugs over the last 25 or so years, and there are definite distinctions between them.  The colouring, build, features, and especially the wrinkles are different in them all.  So I think the abuse part of it is nothing to be so concerned about unless you're an extreme protester against animal abuse who blows up every chance of abuse to a monumental size.  I certainly didn't feel like throwing my grandparent's cat off the roof or making my dog copy Otis after watching the movie.  If anything, it creates a tighter bond between a child and their pet.
If you enjoy animals, adventure, and laughing, you'll probably like Milo and Otis.",978566400,,2110,4.60427807486631
374878,4,6301817761,"All the action and drama of Mission Impossible 2 did not measure up to my 10-year-old son's absolute love and delight of this movie.  I loved it too and it's so nice to have a film to share at his age.  (He thinks the  talking pig, whom I love, is too babyish.)  However, I give it four stars  because he was left thinking it was a sad movie.  I'm not sure why, but it  may have to do with his question throughout the film, ""Will it say at  the end 'No animals have been hurt' in making this film.'?""  I didn't  see that notice.  Also, he loved the animals so much I was forced to lie to  him when he asked me for the release date of the film.  Okay, criticize my  parenting if you must but he is a very sensitive boy and wanted to believe  those very same animals are still alive and well.  Thank you to the  reviewer that mentioned the whole film was shot in Japan.  I didn't see  that in the end credits either.  I would have guessed Canada.  What a  wonderful, warm and innocent (sort of) film.",959385600,,998,4.062176165803109
374879,5,6301817761,"Despite the fact that they threw the cat in the river, had about hundred birds peck wildly at him, chucked him off a cliff and other inhumane things and what not that caused so much controversy, this remains a good film. The  film, which originally was meant for a Japanese(!) audience, was well  crafted into a upbeat American feature with a fantastic narration by Dudley  Moore.",956880000,,380,4.7272727272727275
374880,1,6301817761,"This movie involves tossing a cat off a cliff into the ocean--where it presumably swims to shore--putting a cat in a box and sending it down a river and over a waterfall, pitting a cat against a bear, which later falls  from a branch quite a ways to the ground. It seems the many reviewers who  liked this movie don't empathize with the animal actors who (against their  wills) are forced to do things that clearly terrify them.  This is cruel  spectacle, not wholesome entertainment.",952819200,,484,4.647058823529412

The pug-nosed pup, (Otis), and his curious little kitten pal, (Milo), go on a  long journey together; getting into a few scrapes and experiencing many  amusing run-ins with various other forms of wild-life, along the way! The  most amazing thing, is that there are no people in this whole movie! What's  even more amazing, is that people would just be superflous!  Dudley Moore's  narration is pure perfection; sure to get a chuckle out of everybody!  My  opinion?
