8294274,5,B001DN0UOY,"I love the Devil May Cry series. So naturally I wanted this anime, and it's great I love it. This gives more insight into what and who Dante is. It paints a picture that just playing the games couldn't.

Now I had bought this series before at a Buy Backs, but one of the discs ended up being damaged. So naturally I turned here to Amazon to replace my damaged disc. I found a cheap and new copy of the disc I needed. Well I ordered it and received an email from the placed I purchased from. I was told that the disc I needed came with the other two discs. So they gave me two options; one, they could separate my one disc and give the one. Or two, they could just give me the other two discs completely free.

Of course I wanted the series complete again, so needless to say I now have the complete Devil May Cry anime series. It only costed me $9.34.",1498608000,,851,4.059523809523809

8294277,4,B001DN0UOY,The video is a good one. I only wish that this series would be longer than expected. It would leave you wanting more.,1285545600,,117,4.130434782608695
8294278,3,B001DN0UOY,"Well, this series can be looked at like this: If you were to mash together the PS2 games, added a ho-hum group of secondary characters, remove most of the story that followed the games, then you have a start on what to look at for this one.  I personally have loved the animation quality and the music, they have both been high quality over the course of the series.  The voice actors do okay, even if a few lines felt forced from them,(especially some of Dante's lines.) The main problem with the series, is that while they have the big characters from the games that us DMC fans like, (Dante, Trish, Lady, etc.) they put them in rather unusual situations.  The best example was the episode 'Death Poker', which had Dante playing poker with a group of people we did not know hardly anything about, or truly even care about.  Then they keep dying off, one by one without any real explanation as to why until later in the episode.  The last two episodes were worth the price of admission, but I had stronger hopes for this series.  Overall, I think the series deserves an overall 3.5 out of 5.  I would love to have put it higher, but the series was too much of a mixed bag of great episodes, and too many ho-hum ones.",1228608000,,1217,4.3584070796460175
8294279,5,B001DN0UOY,"Devil May Cry is a bit quirky to begin with. I love these quirky characters. Patty as Dante's daughter figure really makes me laugh, she keeps him in line. But then again, so does Trish and Lady. Dante and the crew face a manipulative cache of demons that want to take him and the people he knows out. Of course there's a lot of swearing and blood gushing, so this is as Dante would say, ""for adults only."" I wish that Capcom would do another set of Devil May Cry anime, I'd certainly would buy it.",1225324800,,498,4.197916666666667
