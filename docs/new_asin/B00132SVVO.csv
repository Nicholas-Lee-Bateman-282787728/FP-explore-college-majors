3101472,5,B00132SVVO,"The video production itself is very cheesy with public-domain sound tracks and titles.  The video earned 5 stars from me because in spite of the cheesyness, it clearly captured the spirit of a new age not seen again until the space program came along.  I enjoyed following the path of the Clipper in the video as it made its way from San Fancisco to Hong Kong.  The stops along the way were as amazing as the flight itself.  This video is a treasured part of my colleciton.",1276214400,5,473,4.402298850574713

3101474,5,B00132SVVO,"For any Pan Am Clipper enthusiast interested in actual video footage of the ""big three"" golden-age Clippers (Sikorsky S-42, Martin M-130, and Boeing 314), this DVD is worth every penny of its $25 price!  All three planes are introduced and shown in development, but the 314 gets the most coverage, with footage from stops across the Pacific in a travelogue style forming a large chunk of the video.  The 314 is my personal favorite, so no complaints here, but some people might like to see more of the other ships (I would, too, if any film survives, of course!).  I presume this DVD was transferred from an earlier video (a bit of VHS-looking fuzz at the bottom of my screen), but that and the occasional 1980's synthesized background music did not detract too much from my experience.  I've found it difficult to track down video footage of these beauties, so this DVD was a fantastic treat.  Even some COLOR film of the 314!  Alas for being born too late to be part of this era.

Footage of pioneering Pan Am bases being built on Pacific islands, some shots of the Sikorsky S-40 and VS-44, mention of Pan Am's contribution to the WWII effort, plus brief clips of Juan Trippe, Charles Lindbergh, Igor Sikorsky, and Grace Coolidge really rounded out this bit of history nicely.  11 out of 10 from this flying boat lover--I still have a smile on my face after watching it.",1271462400,7,1372,4.617283950617284

8248874,5,B00132SVVO,"Amazing stuff.  This is history that you won't find in text books.

Even if you are not a big fan of the history of Pan Am...and the flying boats...members of your family will still like to watch this documentary.  The footage of the people, the planes, and the story might just Spark someone to read a few books about this incredible history.

Best scene was when the Pacific Clipper flew over the Golden Gate Bridge.  The bridge was still under construction and the roadway was not there.",1387497600,,490,4.586206896551724
8248875,3,B00132SVVO,"I paid $25 for this DVD and even though I liked some of it, I don't think it was nearly worth the money.  Books are available that tell thrilling, factual stories of Juan Trippe, Pan Am, the clippers, and trans-oceanic flight.  This DVD was interesting, but very far from thrilling.  I bought it to get a perspective via video footage, but with hindsight, I would rather have seen my pictures in a well-written book printed on good paper stock with color photos (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pan-American-Clippers-The-Golden-Age-of-Flying-Boats/dp/1554078946/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pan American Clippers: The Golden Age of Flying Boats</a>, which is cheaper too!).  Second, the DVD either was written - or at least appears to have been written - by a Pan Am publicist or ad agency.  It was certainly neither unbiased history nor drama.  The first 20 minutes or so of the DVD cover the flying boats themselves, and the last 40 minutes are dredged up, vintage travelogues promoting the Pan Am Pacific routes.  I liked the first third well enough, but the second two thirds quickly got boring.

A few other things (mostly on the plus side):  First, although the cinematography is all understandably old, the very fact that it is old helped capture the retro atmosphere and only occasionally detracted from the presentation.  (At times, the blurred footage was an issue.)  Second, I was struck by the respectful treatment of the various cultures shown.  Third, I think the video did a good job of hitting the highlights of the Pan Am Clipper story.  And finally, I think the story was logically organized, either by time or by the sequence of stops along the route.

But the crux of the issue for me is that the mainly promotional nature of the video sucked a lot of life out of it.  All things considered, I gave it 3 out of 5 stars.",1363478400,5,1888,5.064724919093851
8248876,5,B00132SVVO,"This is a great video history of Pan Am before WWII and their iconic ""clipper ships"", the seaplanes that they used to establish their worldwide airline in the Pacific. The films included are seamlessly joined so the story is told in one complete presentation. There is very little technical detail and really nothing about other Pan Am areas of operation but the trans-Pacific route is well presented. I love the film of the seaplanes in flight and on the water. It really gives the viewer the sense of travel in that short time period before the war disrupted everything and it was never the same afterward. I really enjoyed this product. The showing of the overnight stops at the island bases and the available recreation demonstrates how in that era, people 'made haste elegantly'. All travel is comparative so the seaplane travelers were still going faster than ship travel so they could enjoy their overnight stops at Midway, Wake and Guam islands. Nowadays we pack ourselves like sardines in a can for 12+ hours because we are in such a hurry. In the late '30s, people still enjoyed the journey. Everything was ""first class"" so one wonders how Pan Am could make money. Of course the Airmail contracts were critical to profitability. It is clear that the producers of this film were engaged in a ""labor of love"" and it shows in the quality. I highly recommend this DVD to those interested in aviation/airline history.",1345161600,,1422,4.808163265306122
8248877,4,B00132SVVO,"This was an excellent movie chronicling the drive and perseverance that went into the start up and formation of Pan American World Airways. From it's humble beginnings of establishing international air travel between Key West and Havana, Pan Am pioneered the idea of offering pilots guaranteed career opportunities, in their own professional pilot and navigator training schools. Eventually encircling South America with scheduled airline service, Pan Am grew into the worlds largest and most influential airline. Development of aircraft required to fill the needs is somewhat discussed in this movie. Glenn L. Martin and Boeing Aircraft corporations partnered with Pan Am to produce newer and longer range aircraft as required. Pan Am was instrumental in creating the first flight charts and the establishment of island landing bases with hotels and restaurants across the Pacific ocean all the way to China in 1936. Pan Am also trained a lot of the U.S. pilots who eventually flew the Pacific in WWII. This movie stars Pat O'Brien, Humphrey Bogart, Beverly Roberts and Ross Alexander. This is an excellent movie.",1340582400,,1114,5.3352272727272725
8248878,5,B00132SVVO,"Perfectly satisfying documentary about the Pan Am flying boats. I had just read Dover's ""The Long Way Home"", which I also recommend, and wanted to see the aircraft he was writing about, and here it is, the three clipper types, particularly lots of shots of the Boeing B314! Who would have thought there was film of the hotels in Midway, Wake, and Guam being constructed, and of the passengers arriving? And I weep, seeing the passengers in flight - big chairs, sleeping berths, dining at tables off of china and silverware - having myself spent many many hours in today's flights like sardines squashed into the can. Progress? or not? I recommend this film. Clear images, often color film, good sound.",1335830400,3,701,4.801652892561983
8248879,5,B00132SVVO,"There are a number of well-illustrated books on flying boats and commercial operations employing them. This video provides a unique added dimension to the stories; not new information but film and still sources that expand our sense of how exceptional these huge aircraft were for their time. Still pictures and text cannot convey the drama and luxury of air travel across the Pacific. All the books I have on the Clippers and flying boats miss this emotional experience. This DVD does for Pan Am and it's brief history of Clipper operations what ""Triumph of Will"" does for the the history of the Nuremberg rallies",1297900800,6,614,4.913461538461538
