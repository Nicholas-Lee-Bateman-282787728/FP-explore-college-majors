8058803,5,B0009AFFX8,"I've seen the beginning of this movie and it was pretty hilarious. The theme song was Ronald McDonald singing it, Ronald McDonald being upside-down was funny, there's a scene where Ronald McDonald says, ""Hey, what are you doing in there? Get it? Water you doing in there?"" Ronald McDonald is the clown from McDonalds, and he stars in his very own TV show, The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald. I wish I could watch this episode beginning to end, but I've seen the first three minutes of the episode.",1431216000,,502,4.651685393258427

8058806,5,B0009AFFX8,"Grimmace steals the show in this 5* film.  The only bad thing about this movie was it tended to focus on Hamburglar a little to much for my liking.  This brings me back to about a year ago when the Nook and J-Abs threw a kickin McDonalds party.  Nook dressed up as Ronald himself, J-Abs was Grimmace and former Notre Dame QB Ron Powlus was Hamburglar.  Needless to say Ronald and Grimmace stole the show which is the truf unlike this video where the Burglar tried to steal the show.  When the party got crunk up to a respectable level and it was Some Kind of Wonderful crunk the ladies were all over Nook and J-Abs when Powlus showed up ad the Burglar.  He came in trying to Breakin 2 Electric Boogaloo all over the pace and the ladies were disgusted.  What was worse was when he struck the heisman pose.  Whatever!  Nook ripped off his costume gave him a Chad May poke in the eye and kicked him in the groin.  Powlus left crying as everyone laughed at him.  Then the party was back off da hook once again.  We are the McDonalds brew crew you are the Jack in the Box big clown head who has only sold 36 burgers vs our trillions and trillions.  Deal with that super size style!",1130112000,5,1176,4.219730941704036
