6044404,2,B00G1L6WCW,"Now kids, don't get me wrong: the two stars are for quality, not content!

The content is---in a Mystery Science Theater 3000 way---very entertaining, especially the first two features, which I've watched multiple times (and wondered why there were no silhoutettes of Joel, Tom Servo and Crow at the bottom of the screen.)  Peter Graves at his most solemn, nattering on about how the existence of turtles PROVES that Bigfoot COULD exist, and how a hypnotic session CONFIRMS that the ""recalled"" event really happened, and how someone finding a coelecanth (sp?) off Madagascar in 1938 PROVES that creatures thought to no longer exist CAN exist, and hence Bigfoot must be running around pooping in our forests and stealing picnic baskets....Oh, wait.  That would be Yogi Bear, wouldn't it?

Well, anyhow....You get the idea.  Pop some popcorn, turn down the lights, spin this baby up on the DVD player and try not to choke laughing at the hideous leaps in logic and hammy acting!

""I'm Peter Graves, for Biography.  Uhhh, I mean, 'Bigfootgraphy'.""

In short: poor audio/video quality, but watchable and certainly entertaining as a 70's ""quackumentary""!",1433980800,3,1149,5.139784946236559

6044408,5,B00G1L6WCW,"Well, the first of the 3 films was really great! It had a lot of the creatures appearing to people left & right; I remember seeing this when I was either still in grade school, or already in junior high, or maybe high school, I don't remember; the 2 other films-Sasquatch & Snowbeast were kind of ok, but, maybe just slightly boring; I remember Snowbeast when I was just a little girl; brings back memories, so it's kind of ok; the second, well, kind of boring.  But I have on DVD the Film, Sasquatch which is based on actual accounts where this man & a group of people went to investigate a plane crash out in the middle of nowhere; the man discovered that his daughter & the whole crew were killed by this powerfull creature that dragged the plane through the snow; you see the bigfoot/sasquatch later in the film towards the end; now that was a good film!",1393891200,6,858,4.3625
6044409,1,B00G1L6WCW,"Still not sure why they are using an image from a VHS release of the Legend of Boggy Creek, the name Boggy Creek yet none of the 3 films are in Boggy Creek series/line.

CFS releasing should be ashamed of this sham DVD release. Interesting that the DVDs come with zero info about the company (no address, email, website or phone to complain about this) on the release. All 3 are full screen, grainy copies of poor VHS dupes. ""Sasquatch"" even has the video distortion on the bottom (that is easily corrected when properly uploading the source tape.)

Looks absolutely crappy on modern flat screen TVs. One would think they would attempt to make the quality a bit better since tube TVs are almost gone. But greed over having to spend cents more on multiple discs in a set influenced CFS to put 3 features on one DVD.

This set optimizes everything wrong with these types of releases. All 3 movies are good on their own (the 3rd ""The Snowbeast"" is actually ""The Snow Creature"" (50s release) and the title is the Snow Creature on the movie.

All 3 look better on other sets. Alpha Video's DVD of ""The Snow Creature"" looks far better.

I have 2 older copies of ""The Mysterious Monsters"" & the Rockside Pictures/Color Splat Images release is far superior and is the one to get (to date) for this classic. The 2nd version I have is from BijouFlix (I think now out of business) and this looks better in it's public domain glory than this abomination ""presented"" in this set.

""Sasquatch"" looks better on Retromedia's ""Sasquatch Horror"" set.",1388102400,17,1532,4.613970588235294

6044411,1,B00G1L6WCW,"Asinine from the word go.  Not remastered so fuzzy and dull gray for the most part.  First one might not have been too bad (although bit of a comedown for Peter Graves) if not for the poor picture quality.  Second one stupid - supposed ""expedition"" with all the stereotypes:  old mountain man and his mule which he kept yelling and regaling us with fireside legends, requisite Indian with the usual words of wisdom and otherwise a complete bore with laughable creature.  Third one equally stupid with Sherpas played by Japanese, another laughable creature and lousy acting.

Don't know why this piece of tripe got all the good reviews.  To me a complete waste of money and off it goes to Salvation Army.

And where did Boggy Creek come into this?",1469750400,,746,4.684615384615385

6044417,2,B00G1L6WCW,"The quality of the movies is poor. I enjoyed the first 2 movies immensely. Bigfoot:The Mysterious Monster is a Documentary from the 70's that I have always wanted to find. The second movie, Sasquatch is an enjoyable movie as well. The third is mistitled. They have it listed as The Snowbeast, but is actually The Snow Creature. It is a 1954 movie,that in my opinion was poorly made. I felt I would enjoy watching the orignal Mummy more. I had to give it 2 stars, simply for the first 2 movies. It deserves to lose at least 1 star over quality and 2 stars over the third movie. Some may think I was to generous to them.",1449532800,,618,4.2905982905982905
