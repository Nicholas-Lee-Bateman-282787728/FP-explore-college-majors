8040075,4,B00067Z2CI,"A great inside look at the kings last 24 hours by those who were there and those who were close to the king. This is the best account of what happened from August 15th to August 16th 1977. If you have always been curious concerning the death of Elvis and what happened and not so much how it happened this is for you. This account is not morbid in anyway. Family and friends come together and describe the last 24 hours in chronological order. Joe Esposito leads the way as he was the first to attend to Elvis other than his girlfriend Ginger who is not in the DVD and that is probably a plus in my opinion. You cannot go wrong and you will not be dissapointed. The last 24 hours of Elvis is well done with many intwerviews and clips coming together in good taste. If you are a Elvis fan and you want to spend a couple of hours learning about the end of the greatest entertainer of all time.
Buy this and you can't go wrong.",1262044800,,924,4.138888888888889

So I can't say that I've seen or read all that is out there about Elvis, but the last review prompted me to give my input about ""The Last 24 Hours"".  I have now seen several DVD's about him, the ususal top rated ones, but the self-reflective sharing of the men on this DVD who were close to him left me with an ache that hasn't gone away in the 2 hours since I watched it.

I felt for the sudden loss of such a powerful force in their lives, and through their honest willingness to face the public with their personal stories, I could understand more compassionately the circumstances that seemed so preventable but so unstoppable.  The tragedy of it all is carried deep in their hearts.  I'm not sure what the last reviewer was looking for, but for me this was the most moving DVD about Elvis that I've watched.  Thanks, Diane",1169078400,9,946,4.256983240223463
8040077,1,B00067Z2CI,"There is NOTHING new on this DVD. Same information EVERY ELVIS fan already knows. I assumed the CD was by ELVIS, it is NOT, it is an impersonator and has a LOT of static. Why listen to an impersonator when you can listen the to REAL ELVIS? SAVE YOUR MONEY!

This is a waste of money. IT does NOT even deserve one star.",1124496000,39,318,4.0476190476190474
