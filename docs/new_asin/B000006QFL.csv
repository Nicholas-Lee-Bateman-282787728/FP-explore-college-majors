7904647,5,B000006QFL,"""Stan Lee: The ComiX-MAN!"" is part of A&E's ""Biography"" video series.  This entry looks at the life of one of the pivotal figures in 20th century comic books.  The film looks not only at Lee's life but also at the history of the comic book genre.
We learn of Lee's birth in Manhattan, Army service during World War II, marriage and family life.  Also covered in depth is his history in comic books--the first appearance of the Fantastic Four, the creative process known as the ""Marvel Method,"" etc.  Also covered are the various successful TV incarnations of some of Lee's great creations.
The filmmakers include interviews with a large range of people--Lee's family members, writer Harlan Ellison, comic book artists including John Romita, actor Lou Ferrigno (TV's Hulk), filmmaker John Singleton, Marvel proofreader Flo Steinberg, and more, including Lee himself.  This rich collection of voices gives the film a lot of depth and color.
With a copyright date of 1995, this film obviously does not cover the many big motion picture projects with which Lee has been involved from 2000 onward.  But this is still a fascinating, informative tribute to one of the great figures in American popular culture--a man whose characters continue to thrill and inspire millions.",1074470400,2,1267,5.0673076923076925
