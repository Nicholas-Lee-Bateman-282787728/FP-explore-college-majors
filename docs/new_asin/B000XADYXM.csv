3000303,5,B000XADYXM,OMG this album brings soo many memories.  I've always loved this band since I was 15 yrs old.  I have all of Raca Negra albums.,1360195200,,127,4.04
3000304,5,B000XADYXM,"What can I say? I started listening to the wonderful minera Paula Fernandes last year when I accidentally bumped into a YouTube music video ""Long Live"" (song originally by Swift) and from there I started to listen to her music, now that I watched the DVD you can see/hear the passion and the emotion when she sings every single song. This DVD will not dissapoint also if you are a person wanting to speak Portuguese this is a great way to start by singing along her beautiful voice. The only thing I'd love to see was the songs also with English/Spanish subtitles not only the spoken parts, but other than that I highly reccomend this DVD.",1359072000,,639,4.517241379310345
3000305,5,B000XADYXM,Really worth have one copy!  I recommend strongly buy it!!  Is one of the new brazylian success! MUITO BOM MESMO!,1345507200,,113,4.6
3000306,5,B000XADYXM,"Paula's performance is simply lovely, a display of musical joy and lyrical purity.  The set, music, and performance are elegant, and the video quality is excellent.  Her voice and expressions are captivating.  While I lean most toward jazz and classical music genres, Paula and her group demonstrate how pure and enjoyable country music can be.  What always comes through in this peformance is her and the group's love of their craft.  Never does one have a sense that this was done merely as a commercial effort, but performed for the love of music and for the benefit and love of her audience.  The DVD includes her rendition of Shania Twain's familiar 'Feel Like a Woman' in English, certainly faster tempo and enjoyable, yet the songs in her native Portuguese have even more passion and perfection.  I thoroughly enjoyed and feel blessed to have seen and heard Paula's music.",1325894400,3,879,4.898648648648648
3000307,5,B000XADYXM,I first saw her on YouTube.  Altough I don't understand her language...I didn't need to.  Her voice is soo amazing.  She has done a English CD and it was pure pleasure.  I can't wait for her to come to the states.  If Nashville new about her; she would be the next super star.,1298678400,14,276,4.132075471698113
3000308,5,B000XADYXM,"Bite, scratch and claw your way to THIS dvd, as it is long overdue and highly anticipated. It is a milestone, and must be seen to be believed.
All those who love MPB will want to get this ASAP! It features great songs, Mauricio Maestro's vocal arrangements, superb guest artists including MPB-4, and a perfomance worthy of worship. As you can tell, I REALLY like these guys...I do miss the guitar of Fernando Gama, but that is a small complaint considering how many times this dvd made me cry with joy! The Making of segment is very informative and cool in that it includes ancient clips of the band performing with MPB-4 and others. I can not fathom why this disc, along with that of MPB-4 and the new Cidade Negra, is so difficult to find. These dvds should be on the shelves everywhere, easy to obtain for personal pleasure and gift giving!",1196899200,,843,4.516339869281046

8227634,5,B000XADYXM,Good video and amazing sound,1418169600,,28,4.8
8227635,5,B000XADYXM,"When I bought it I saw another review saying that the dvd lacked of subtitles in our languages (English at least hehe because my main language is Spanish). But when I got it I was really relieved that the main songs offer subs in the original language at least! (Because I am learning Portuguese) it is true that it is needed to offer more subtitles for some special features but I think it is ok.

Regarding the sound, the stage, the performance! I loved them! I was really surprised that I loved almost all the songs! Her voice is amazing! The performance of her band is really good! I discovered myself smiling just because the band seemed to be enjoying their own music!!

I am really happy with this DVD!",1369180800,2,709,4.446153846153846
8227636,5,B000XADYXM,She is a stunning a performer.  Her voice is beautiful and her eyes make me think that perhaps angels have brown eyes.,1367280000,,118,4.363636363636363
8227637,5,B000XADYXM,"This is an eye and ear opener.  This young Brazilian performer knows what singing, and sharing talent with an audience, is all about.  Her love of music shows in every note she sings.  This is the caliber of talent that I wish there were more of in North America (Canada does have it's share).  Even the lack of understanding of the language she sings, did not dampen the enjoyment of the beauty of her singing.  During one of her songs, ""Costumes"", I found myself not breathing, and a tear on my cheek.  I thought, ""how does she do that?""  Marvelous CD!  I would recommend it to anyone who loves music, and doesn't necessarily have to have it done in English (although she does have a CD sung in the familiar tongue, and it's excellent also).",1360972800,,743,4.451851851851852
