2269472,5,B00097HUJ8,"Dave Allen is a great comic. Had to get region 2 beacuse it is not available in the US, but worth the all the hassle to watch it on the PC. Will bvuy it again when it is available in the US.",1259020800,3,190,3.5476190476190474
2269473,5,B00097HUJ8,"I grew up watching him in the states, and he was very funny and wasn't afraid to make fun of himself (ie, the origin of his missing finger spawned many different stories!). He made fun of the COE and Catholics a lot, and always started his show by telling a joke to the audience (one of which I still tell 30 years later). If you have never been introduced to him, I recommend his videos. He inspiration stretches all the way through today, including Graham Norton.",1258675200,4,465,4.4186046511627906
2269474,5,B00097HUJ8,"I am so glad to see Amazon offering this. I had watched Dave Allen since I was a youngster. I think it helped formulate my unique and slightly dark sense of humor. Dave Allen was quite an influence on me, and I have been looking for anything I could get for many years. It was originally a Brit/BBC series that I was able to enjoy on PBS just before Dr. Who. The other reviewer (Jim) described him quite well. I would just add that his sense of humor was for the thinking man, or woman. It questioned establishments without being non-conformist. In my opinion he was the greatest Brit comic I have ever seen since he was the first one I've seen that was actually funny. I just wish I could get his whole collection on DVD. Please Amazon, help me!",1181692800,19,746,4.297872340425532
2269475,5,B00097HUJ8,"If you haven't discovered the late Dave Allen, check this DVD out. You'll need a Region 2 DVD player (it won't play on most U.S. players). Since I've run into this repeatedly (being an ex-pat Brit with relatives still overseas) I solved this by letting one of my computer DVD drives be a Region 2 drive, which you can accomplish when you first buy a computer as the drive will eventually become a fixed Region 2 drive (it's not complicated, the directions come up automatically when you play the DVD).

  Dave Allen was an institution. He did TV specials every year or so in Britain in the 1970s and '80s where he'd sit in a spotlit leather chair on stage and share the wit and story-telling ability that made him a unique raconteur. In later years, he dropped the trademark cigarette and glass of booze that he also had on stage throughout the hour or so specials. He avoided over-exposure, appearing just frequently enough to retain a following. Dave Allen was something you looked forward to, appointment television because it was a rarity.

  His origins were Irish, and his wit and world-view was uniquely Irish, too. He pontificated about sex, the Irish, God, smoking, life, death, etc., etc.

  What makes ""The Best of Dave Allen"" a particular treat -- aside from just getting to see some of his best stuff -- is to watch how he aged and how dress style, haircuts and BBC stage sets changed over the years.

  But the real joy is that dry Irish humor. A touch of self-deprecation, a dash of blasphemy, a trace of (sometimes dated) edginess, a smidgen of willfulness, a slight smirk, a sense of a joke shared between the comedian and the audience (in the nudge, nudge, wink, wink, know-wot-I-mean? vein) and almost always a great payoff.

  I'm not sure how -- or if -- Dave Allen played in the States. The humor might be culturally specific to a degree that it doesn't translate well. And it certainly might offend some American sensibilities. But Dave Allen was one of the greats, and this is a good collection.",1172275200,42,2019,4.632022471910112
2269516,4,B00097HUJ8,"Dave Allen, RIP, appeared on Public TV in Chicago in the 1980s.  I was very amused and cried tears of laughter listening to his jokes and watching his comedy skits.  The disk shows a few of his skits, but for my taste, these were not the best, nor the highlights of his comedic career.",1394582400,2,285,4.2592592592592595

2269518,5,B00097HUJ8,"This is great!  I love Dave Allen and only wish I could find more DVDs of his TV shows.  He's one of the best, you rarely find someone as funny as him any more.",1382140800,,160,3.676470588235294

2269520,2,B00097HUJ8,"One DVD of Dave Allen At Large is not enough, and this one tells only a tiny fraction of the story!  They need to start releasing an entire set of full-season DVD's of this wonderful long-running blockbuster comedy programme in the same way many of the greatest and most popular TV programmes have got after they were introduced on DVD.  What would turn out to be his crowning achievement, Dave Allen At Large, which ran from 1971 to 1979 and have over 200 episodes, would become an international sensation on the telly as a groundbreaking extravagant sketch comedy programme that became a blockbuster ratings hit and create an electrifying and bold form of original comedy that have led a timeless comical legacy of laughs, screams, gut-busting hilarity, thought-provoking madcap commentary and plenty of belly laughs--all done in the great traditional music hall repertoire.  While Dave Allen At Large drew absolute praise for it's nerve-wracking comic sketches and wacky send-ups on political hypocrisy, mankind, society and the catholic church, the programme even drew additional controversy for the outspoken master comic because of the nature and his obnoxious characterizations of politics and the catholic church to whom many have viewed as a threat (He was also Britain's most controversial comedian).  However, despite all this controversy, Dave Allen At Large went on to become a bonafide five star masterpiece in television comedy and one of Britain's greatest and most popular comedy programmes.  Now let's have Dave Allen At Large seen in it's complete form in a set of full-season episodes, because not only will it give fresh new light on the programme, but will bring a lasting lease on life for Dave Allen's groundbreaking comic artistry that will always remain as resilient and absolutely side-splittingly funny as ever.",1372204800,,1839,5.220338983050848
2269521,5,B00097HUJ8,"I loved watching Dave Allen At Large on the local PBS station in Chicago in the 1980s.  This DVD has several funny skits, but I saw better skits from Mr. Allen, RIP.",1367366400,4,165,4.15625
2269522,5,B00097HUJ8,"I haven't seen Dave Allen since the 1970s. I thought he was very funny then. Now, having seen his best material covering the span of his career, I can state that he was a genius. He would be so not politically correct these days as he smoked and drank what was assumed to be whisky, although it was ginger ale, during his routine. RIP Dave!",1356220800,,340,4.246153846153846

2269524,5,B00097HUJ8,"When I saw this DVD for sale I did not hesitate one minute to send in my order. Dave Allen has been a favourite of mine for a long time, with his laid back,clean,incisive humour which I doubt could be offensive to anyone. Glad to have had the opportunity to enjoy his talent once again.",1283040000,2,286,4.218181818181818
2269525,4,B00097HUJ8,"Everything about Dave Allen was relaxed... except his humour.
It had no boundaries. Nobody was safe, religion, governments celebrities, even himself.
This DVD is just a glimpse at the many years when he amused his fans and bemused his critics.
Like many other excellent comedians, he did not need to rely on swearing and abuse. This humour is clean, tidy and very funny.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dave-Allen-The-Best-Of-PAL-Region-2-Import/dp/B000LLN2HG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dave Allen - The Best Of [PAL, Region 2, Import</a>]",1277337600,2,576,6.693333333333333

It is not a big loss since I didn't pay alot for this dvd but now I have to go through the hassel of returning it.

8058083,1,B00097HUJ8,"Normally I can play a region 2 PAL disk on my computer.  However, some sort of weird UDF encoding was used on this disk on everything except the copyright warning and the BBC banner flying across the screen.  Those two things played normally.  Big deal.  As for the main feature, that was a pixilated mess visually, with screechy audio.  I've tried a few different programs to try to produce something playable from it, with no luck.  On June 15, 2015, I wrote to BBC Worldwide, asking what the compatibility problem was.  On August 6, 2015, they finally responded, denying any responsibility and not answering my compatibility question.  Their response:  ""Our DVDs may not be compatible with all players or PCs.  We would advise you return your DVD to Amazon for a replacement or check for a suitable Region 1 version.  Kind regards  BBC DVD Support""
So they're clueless as to how much time can elapse before you can not longer make an Amazon return.  They respond with the speed of an elderly snail.  And they are clueless as to their products, suggesting I obtain a region 1 version of the product, whereas they do not make a region 1 version of the product - or take the insane step of having it replaced with the same thing.  It's a pity because Dave Allen was a comic genius.",1446595200,,1281,4.581497797356828

8058086,5,B00097HUJ8,"Dave Allen is perhaps one of the greatest storytellers of all time. I never get tired of his jokes, skits and stories. There are no sacred cows with his humor. Government, relationships, death, ethnic, police, military, religion and anything else you can think of; all were targets for his stories and skits.

The only issue I have is that after watching this DVD, I wanted more! I just wish that the old Dave Allen At Large series of shows were available. There are so many hilarious skits and jokes I remember from years back which aren't on this ""Best Of"" compilation, I always found his religious humor superbly funny and not the least bit offensive and was really hoping for a few of the Arch-Bishop in the chair skits but alas, there weren't any. Still, this Best Of DVD is definitely worth getting and will have you laughing the whole time.",1429920000,,847,4.6092715231788075
