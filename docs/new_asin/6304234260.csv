7865293,5,6304234260,These cartoons were so fun to watch with my 11 year old son.  A treat to enjoy in addition to the Christmas Classics that we all know and love. It's fun to discover Christmas classic cartoons that you haven't seen before.  Thanks for making these available in your video library.,1512345600,,279,4.56
7865294,5,6304234260,"......one short animated film included here was made in Germany in 1944. About a boy who creates a snowman and loses him when he takes him out of the freezer in July. It's so peaceful and utterly beautiful, I know it's a tired phrase, but it's worth buying for that alone.
 The others here have also become classics, Rudolph, Somewhere in Dreamland, Christmas Comes But Once A Year are infectious. You see them once and never forget them. A classic VHS tape, well worth owning.
 Look out for the DVD ....",1049673600,4,504,4.527472527472527
