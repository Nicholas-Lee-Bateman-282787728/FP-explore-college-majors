8448707,5,B004YOEEVO,"One of these days we may even get season sets.  Imagine that! :-  There's been a hiccup of two, maybe three years between volumes 3 & 4, but now that 4 & 5 have been released, I have all the Alpha offerings to date.  It'd be sacrilege for me not to get each volume to expand my ongoing collection.  Though as I've said, I'd like very much to see season sets released so I can have them all!",1316995200,2,390,3.9615384615384617
