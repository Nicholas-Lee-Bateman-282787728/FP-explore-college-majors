8571683,5,B00BNLPIMU,"""Resistance"" training - otherwise known as ""strength"" training - develops a person's muscles (muscle mass), as opposed to ""aerobic"" training, which develops one's cardiovascular fitness, but basically does not develop one's muscles.

My personal focus, in the immediate near term, on an emergency priority basis, is to develop my muscle mass, particularly in my lower body - is that your goal in exercise?

This excellent and engaging DVD presents extremely informative research results about very interesting research studies concerning various aspects of ""strength training,"" including methods which may be the most rewarding to one's fitness program, and in what areas and why.

The research results presented in this DVD provide a great deal of guidance to anyone engaging in ""strength training"" as, e.g., at a commercial gym, where persons may consider incurring the considerable cost of hiring a ""personal trainer.""

These research studies inform people how to structure their ""strength"" workouts in order to maximize the physical value of their exercise sessions - great clues for exercise success.

The research results presented in this DVD provide considerable motivational inspiration and encouragement to persons engaging in, or considering to embark upon, strength training.

This DVD's lecturer is very engaging and lively - he has also authored a number of books on ""resistance"" or ""strength"" training and exercise, which are available on AMAZON.com, where I purchased a few, as a result of viewing this DVD.

Highly recommended.",1396742400,,1544,5.54468085106383
