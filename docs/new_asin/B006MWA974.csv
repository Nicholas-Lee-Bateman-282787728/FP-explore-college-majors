5006551,4,B006MWA974,"Two disclaimers before I begin:
1) Same as my review for Strike Witches. If you don't like fan service, stay away from this show. Very, very far away. If fan service makes you uncomfortable in any way, go stick your head under a pillow and pretend this show does not exist. You'll be happier for it.
2) There are going to be some minor SPOILERS from the first season in my review. If this bothers you, I'm sorry. But in order to review the second season correctly, I feel I must mention some stuff that happened in the first season.

Now that that's out of the way, let's begin (Yes, this is a combo DVD and Blu-ray box set, despite what the description says).

The lovely ladies (did I really just write that?) from the 501st Joint Fighter Wing return in Strike Witches 2.  Once again, they find themselves struggling in the war against the Neuroi. However, they have clearly won the war on pants because no female wears them anymore. I still don't understand what pants did to deserve an entire war on them. Poor pants.
Actually, the real reason the witches don't wear pants is because their Striker Units (the planes their wear on their legs) are powered by a witch's magic, and must have direct contact (or near direct like wearing tights) with the skin. Again, this is never explained and you're just suppose to know. That's because the anime is a continuation of the manga, which has unfortunately never been released in the United States. So that, along with a few other plot points, are never really explained.

I'll make it simple. If you liked the first season of Strike Witches, you'll like season 2. All the same characters are back, all the same action, all the same jokes, all the same camera shots. And NEW camera shots, now with less pants! Miafuji is still the main star and is still jealous of Lynne's figure, which Lynne is clueless about (the flirt!), Sanya is still crazy cute, Eila is still overprotective of her. And attracted to her. Erica still gives Barkhorn a headache, Shirley is still insanely ""developed"" for a teenager and Francesca wouldn't have any other way. Perine is still tripping over herself regarding Major Mio Sakamoto, and Mina is still in charge.
This season does add some depth to the characters, though not much. What really made me happy was that the four characters who didn't get their own episode last season get one this time. Eila gets her own episode which shows her relationship with Sanya in a more revealing light, and we find out that Sanya can be violent with Eila (that made me laugh: quite little Sanya smacking Eila hard). Perine gets an episode that, shockingly, doesn't involve her fawning over Mio but instead focuses on her desire to help her country and gives her character a new level beyond ""I'm the stuck up one."" Francesca spends an entire episode running around Rome with her new friend and showing how much she loves her homeland, and Erica enters a duel with an ace just as good as she is. I was happy that these episodes were made because, while all the characters were in the previous season, these four never really got their own episodes. They were always 'part' of the episodes, but never the main focus.
Another fun thing that was added this season is the fact that each witch gets to use her special magic ability in combat right from the start. It only happens once, but it was fun to see it. I had no idea that Erica's special combat skill was turning into a wind bullet, because I'm pretty sure that was never shown in the first season.
The sound effects are again pretty accurate, although I think they may have changed some of the machine guns' noises because several models sound the same. The English voice acting is spot on for the most part. The only time I found myself cringing is when Mio did her laugh, or in the last few episodes where one of the characters starts to have a mental break down because of what's happening to her. Those two parts felt way too forced, and while I'm sure that works in Japanese, it doesn't here. Also, the name of Mio's sword attack and the way she says it always causes me to roll my eyes.

Now for the reasoning behind my missing star. Once again, Strike Witches sets up for a big plot reveal, and then fails to deliver (here come those SPOILERS from the first season I warned you about, and for the first episode of season 2). As you recall at the end of the first season, the Neuroi suddenly takes the shape of a witch and plays, for lack of a better term, with Miafuji. It even goes so far as to show that the humans are building a superweapon that turns out to be a real danger to the witches. All this implies that, perhaps, the Neuroi are not what we think they are. Miafuji even says, ""Are you really our enemy?"" Season 2 picks up this idea, with the first episode showing a unit of witches flying to meet the strange Neuroi witch. It seems like the Neuroi are willing to talk, but then a more powerful Neuroi shows up, wipes out the Neuroi witch and the Neuroi hive there, and...nothing. The Neuroi attack themselves for one episode, suggesting that maybe there are factions of Neuroi and not all of them want war, but this is never touched again. The finale, while better than the first season, still leaves you with that nagging question of ""Why did the Neuroi attack themselves?"" Again, I'm left feeling like I'm missing some information, but the writers were hoping I'd forget about it between all the laughs and nudity.

The finale episode ends with a hook for the movie that came out in Japan earlier this year. I really hope that FUNimation gets a hold of it and releases it here in the U.S. because I really do like this series. It makes me laugh and it does have an interesting take on World War II. I just wish that the writers would stop dangling this carrot in front of viewers. Either complete the underlying plot that keeps getting suggested, or drop it in favor of the complete silliness that the rest of the episodes feature.
And Commander Mina, if I may make a suggestion: The 501st seems to be the only unit that is getting ANY results in the war against the Neuroi. As such, stop disbanding them after every major victory! You could save a lot of trouble and time if you kept the unit together and just moved to the next battlefield.",1351123200,21,6285,4.489510489510489
5006552,5,B006MWA974,"It might be a little distracting to watch this because of the fan service, but its one great anime when or if you get passed that. There are some really powerfull scenes; especialy from the final episode.

But the other thing that made it great was that it's finaly in HD, and it looks fantastic! Depending on the TV you have, like mine it really makes it look crisp since my TV has a nice contrast and it balances the color spectrum better than other TVs.

Not the mention that it comes in a very sturdy box (and an extra slot for your season one pack). I was originaly going to wait for this but I couldn't hold it any longer.

For any die hard Strike Witches fan it's a must-have. I highly recommend it.",1349913600,2,706,4.214814814814815
5006553,4,B006MWA974,"Even I had to ask myself this question: ""What makes this show work?""

Japan's anime industry had been known for turning everybody and everything into cute little girls. This, the audience it panders to, and the fact that they treat the young guys EVEN WORSE in anime, had earned (from me) the term ""Wapan's Animu Industry."" ""Strike Witches"" is of many.

So it's yet another one of those ""magical girl"" shows. But it's a WWII-era show where moe-fied versions of famous fighter pilots work together to battle against aliens and spend whatever non-serious time either in their bathing suit or ""birthday suit."" And they're in-and-around high school age; getting evil looks from the ""anti-pedophile movement.""

HOWEVER.

This show works because, while it has the means to hit below the belt, it doesn't. This show's a well-written ""what-if"" that asks what happens when aliens attack us at a certain period of time. We'd spend more time fighting said aliens instead of each other.

It's also filled with historical information that surprisingly fits with certain situation.

And you can always count on the good staff over at FUNimation for adding more ""zingers"" to their dialogue than the Republican Party on a losing campaign.

IMMHO, it would be much better if it wasn't just one gender (for fanboy-baiting's sake). Then again; I can give you a list of anime titles that are FAR WORSE than this. (I mean, low-angle panty shots is good and all. But I don't wanna feel like some ugly-looking loser who secretly takes upskirt photos of women.)",1349913600,,1537,4.934108527131783
5006554,4,B006MWA974,"I enjoyed the 2nd season of Strike Witches. The animation is very good and so is the voice acting. I was a bit surprised at the episode content though. Each episode found the members of the 501st in a different situation. The main battle only began around the last 3 episodes. Most of the series was the team goofing off a lot. Nevertheless it was funny and pretty entertaining. There is a bunch of weird perverted stuff, but if ya don't let it bother you you'll probably enjoy it. Based on the ending a 3rd season seems likely. I wish there was a little more ""meat and potatoes"" to this story. If the story got more involved I would give it 5 stars. Since it's purely a fun and games type series I'll give it 4. It has more potential than is actually achieved, but I think you'll enjoy it.",1349481600,8,790,4.273333333333333

5006597,5,B006MWA974,"If you are looking up season 2, then you already know what the show is about. So to get right to the point. It was a good show. To be honest, season one was better, but season 2 did a good job at following up the show to season 2, while keeping the story line going. I have seen many shows where season 1 was great, and 2 was just OK. This was not like that. They did calm it down a little in season 2, versus season 1, but it was still written on almost the same level as season one, at least in my opinion. If you watched season one, then watch season 2. It will not disappoint. And no, they did not kill the show at the end like some shows do.. It is just a good continuation of the show, with a decent ending. I don't think you really need to know more, and I don't want to give any spoilers, so I will not go into detail about what happens in season 2. Just watch it.",1454630400,,872,3.8232044198895028

5006599,5,B006MWA974,"Six months after being disbanded following their victory in this WWII's Battle of Britain and the Liberation of France, the 501st Joint Fighter Wing is reformed in order to deal with the Neuroi conquest of Venice and their threat to conquer Rome.  (The 504th Joint Fighter Wing already stationed in the area had been all but exterminated in the initial fighting.)

The twelve episodes of the second season follow the pattern of the first by mostly concentrating on the stories of just a few members of the crack international 501st Joint Fighter Wing at a time.  The first two episodes concentrate on Yoshika Miyafuji and Mio Sakamoto and their journey from Japan to the Adriatic Theater.  In episode 3 Lynette Bishop, Perrine H. Clostermann, and Yoshika, the only three witches to leave the military after the first season, get assigned to a tough old former instructor of Mio's for remedial training.  In episode 4 Gertrud Barkhorn and Charlotte E. Yeager clash while testing a revolutionary jet striker unit with a minor but fatal flaw.  In episode 5 after  Yeager does things with a deuce and a half that should never be attempted, Francesca Lucchini rescues a mysterious girl and gives her a tour of Rome.  In episode 6 Eila Ilmatar Juutilainen learns to her horror that the special magic ability which allows her to dodge attacks without having to generate shields makes her useless for protecting her BFF Sanya V. Litvyak on an extremely high altitude mission.  Episode 7 is the all fan service episode involving a tiny Neuroi spy that infiltrates the base and tries to avoid destruction by hiding inside panties,... while they are being worn (insert your own joke).  In episode 8 Yoshika mysteriously loses her ability to fly.  Episode 9 is another mostly fan service episode during which Perrine leads a treasure hunt and Mio displays a complete inability to hold her liquor... or to remember anything she did while under the influence of it.  In episode 10 Erica Hartmann must deal with the fanatically competitive former comrade, Hanna-Justina Marseille, who is brought in by the brass for a special joint mission.  Finally, episodes 11 and 12 constitute the season climax in which sacrifice follows upon sacrifice.

The best things about this anime are the beautiful animation, especially of the frantic air battles; the loving and accurate depiction of the WWII era warships (particularly IJN Yamato); the striker unit reimagining of WWII era fighter planes; and the depiction of a small military unit rising to the challenge, ""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few"" with so much of their rear ends exposed.

The worst things will take a little more explaining.  First, some (but only some) of the fan service was overdone to the point of boredom because if you've seen one spread-legged, tight-panties-clad camel toe, you've pretty much seen them all (I swear some of these were repeated stock shots!).  The very frequent bare breasted bathing scenes (Boy, these girls were fond of cleanliness!) tended to be better because they differed from each other and usually advanced the plot.  Finally, the panties infiltrator fought in episode seven, finally defeated by Minna's Buns of Steel, was both clever and hilarious, as was Mio's drunken spree and memory blackout in episode 9.  Second, a fascinating plot complication, a seemingly friendly humanoid Neuroi was introduced and then completely dropped without explanation.  Third, the main character was arguably the least interesting character in the show, not bad you understand, but more than a little predictable in comparison to the aging witch trying to keep fighting even with her magic gone, the confident commander who fell to pieces in the face of someone she cared about taking close to suicidal risks with her life, and the tough as nails hard charger, willing to take her chances using a weapon known to be fatally flawed because nothing else will do the job, to name just three.

Note: In contrast to so many anime and manga about coed institutions, this anime was almost completely devoid of any he-ing and she-ing.  There was a whole lot of female bonding in all senses of the word, but almost no male-female encounters at all, much less romantic male-female encounters.  There were various good reasons for this, including the base commander's overreaction to her own failure to get over losing a boy very dear to her, but the upshot is a distinct ""yuri"" undertone.  It is mostly played for laughs, but there are at least three clear examples of female characters whose affections for another female character go well beyond sisterly.  Interestingly, in all three cases this affection not only goes unrequited but all but completely unnoticed.

Note: There are two different Blu-ray/DVD editions of this series to choose from.  The original edition consists of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strike-Witches-Season-1-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B007V9EAA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strike Witches: Season 1 (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strike-Witches-Season-2-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B006MWA974/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strike Witches: Season 2 (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>&nbsp;while the current edition consists of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strike-Witches-Season-1-S-A-V-E-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00GS1YP6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strike Witches: Season 1 S.A.V.E.

(Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>.  As far as I can tell the only difference between the two is that the original edition Season 2 set comes with a box designed to hold both seasons' cases.  (There are also DVD only editions, but since they are priced higher than the S.A.V.E. multi-format sets, there seems little point in choosing them.)

Note: There are a number of Strike Witches episodes not yet released onto home video in America.  These are the Strike Witches Pilot OVA, which must take place sometime after episodes 1 and 2 of the first season, if it fits into the continuity at all; the three episodes of the Operation Victory Arrow OVA, which take place after the second season, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strike-Witches-The-Movie-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B01IPEAHGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strike Witches: The Movie (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>, which takes place after that.",1452297600,,6700,5.820040899795501

Plot and Characters: (minor spoiler only) Six months after the first season ends, The 501st strike witch squad has been disbanded. But the Neuroi has shown their alien face's again. Its up to Yoshika and the others to stop the aliens from destorying the earth again!

story line: if you have read my first review or have seen the first season its the same protocol again. Girls fly around destorying Neuroi machines from destorying the earth.

Netural Note: once again the girls hardly ever wear any clothes at all, and in one episode they break the 4th wall by admiting they hardly wear any clothes.

Cons: it has some fast pace action but once again it hardly explains anything going on with the Neuroi/invading aliens. Its like ok aliens are destorying the world, ' . Why are the Neuroi invading? never explained. What are Neuroi? aliens that destory the earth, if you want more of an answer just use your imagination like I did, otherwise you never get an answer.

Side Note: this anime was made and produced in 2010, its now 2015 and they just announced a third season but it will NOT be a continue-ation of this story with all the characters, apparently the creater is going to make brand new characters with a new story line.

Overall: its alright, If you buy this series try to get it for less, its one of thoses animes that you would watch once but never really watch again",1430524800,,1451,4.540229885057471

5006665,4,B006MWA974,"I didn't find the second season as compelling as the first, the sequel being less about the
horrors of war, and more about the panties. (Still, that isn't necessarily bad...) The tone
of this one was much more light-hearted, and in a way, it was a relief.

The sequel has a definitive ending, too, as opposed to the first season, which just sort of
tapered off.

I was a little disappointed that the characters didn't evolve in any significant ways, and
their inter-relationships were more suggested-at than told.

Anyone who enjoyed the first season is sure to like this one, too, and taken as a whole,
Strike Witches is definitely in the top 5 of my favorite anime series ever.",1407369600,,679,4.641666666666667

5006686,5,B006MWA974,"In the mid twentieth century the 501st joint fighter wing known as the strike witches gained renown for their victory in Britain against the alien race known as the Neuroi. Afterwards the 501st were disbanded and its witches reassigned to other units, but mere months later the 501st reunite in order to take up the fight to liberate Italy of the Neuroi threat. The series follows Yoshika Miyafuji and the other strike witches as they struggle to fight a far more lethal form of the Neuroi.

The animation is great, the characters are engaging, the story is intriguing and the
English dub is very good although lacked accents making this series a must own for any anime fan or at least watched.

Be warned the girls' panties are constantly visible and there is some brief nudity during a few bathing / shower scenes so it may not be suitable for children!",1392854400,7,855,4.655629139072848

I got the first season on DVD. I have nothing against BluRay DVDs except the extra $10.00 price that they try to get. I stopped buying Combos due to the fact that I feel the gimmick of trying to get people to switch to BluRays by putting out Combo sets that have the DVD version and the BluRay version and then charging the BluRay price instead of the DVD price to try and get people to buy and pay the extra $10.00 just makes me mad. If they want to sell more BluRays, get the price down!!! Try around $20.00 instead of $40.00 and you might start selling more and stop this selling Combos instead of selling DVD versions and BluRay versions apart. (This allows your customer to choose and then the seller can decide a reasonable price for each!) Anyway, I liked this anime in spite of it's terrible Combo set up and that's why I got it. (And NO I won't pay a HUGE price for an DVD release that someone brought a bunch of them up on with the idea of making a killing on.) This is well worth getting.

The second season keeps the action and fun going and lends a satisfying conclusion? Needless to say anybody interested in a second season of any series is probably well into the premise so buying this is a complete win for fans. When the final credits rolled I wanted to see more.

The entire concept is imaginative and kind of bizarre but it works and this is now one of my favorite anime series ever, I'll probably go on to check out the original manga sources materials now.",1362096000,,623,4.370689655172414

5006728,4,B006MWA974,"In 2006, Humikane Shimada (""Sky Girls"") began his ""Strike Witches"" illustrated columns. The popularity of the columns led to a light novel series, a manga series an anime OVA and a 12-episode TV anime series which was released in March 2010 on DVD courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment.  A second season aired from July through September 2010 and will be released on Blu-ray +DVD combo pack courtesy of FUNimation in October 2012.

The TV series is directed by Kazuhiro Takamura (""He is My Master"", ""Mobile Suit Gundam Seed"", ""Mahoromatic"", ""This Ugly Yet Beautiful World"") and also was responsible for character designs, series composition by Tsuyoshi Tamai (""Galaxy Angel"", ""Chobits"", ""Azumanga Daioh""), art direction is by Hiromasa Ogura (""Patlabor"", ""Nadia - Secret of Blue Water"", ""Ghost Hound"") and music by Seikou Nagaoka (""El Hazard"" series, ""Tenchi Muyou"" series"").

VIDEO:

""Strike Witches: Season Two"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  For a television series, ""Strike Witches"" focuses on the battles over sea and in the skies.  So, there is a not a whole lot of detail going on in the series.  If anything, more emphasis is put on the special effects and characters up-close especially showcasing the Strike Witches and their weapons.  Also, a good amount of detail for the mechanical designs especially the Neuroi and the vehicles.

AUDIO:

Audio for ""Strike Witches"" is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0.  Dialogue is clear and understandable.  Voice acting for both English and Japanese are done well.  But it's the English dub soundtrack that sounds incredible on Blu-ray.  Great amount of action and use of surround sound to make a more immersive soundscape.  Great dynamic range and definitely an improvement over it's Japanese counterpart when it comes to immersiveness.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Strike Witches: Season 2 comes with the following special features:

  Episode 5 Audio Commentary - Featuring an entertaining audio commentary by Jamie Marchi  (voice of Charlotte Yeager) and Trina Nishimura (voice of Francesca).
  Episode 9 Audio Commentary - Featuring Scott Sager and Anastasia Munoz (voice of Mina) and Jad Saxton (voice of Perrine), the voice talent's first audio commentary.
  Textless Opening Song ""Egao no Mahou"" - (1:32) Featuring a performance by Yoko Ishida.
  Textless Closing Song ""Over the Sky""  - (5:43) Featuring eleven different versions of ""Over the Sky"" with the Japanese voice actresses.

EXTRAS:

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I reviewed the first season of ""Strike Witches"" I felt the anime was full of cliches and a storyline that was overused.  But it's strength was its character development and for fans of fan service, the series definitely had quite a bit of that.  While the first season was OK, I was not exactly the biggest fan of the anime series.

But I have noticed how popular ""Strike Witches"" was in Japan.  From the action figures to the mecha fans who liked the combination of mecha power suits and fan service, I guess I can see the otaku allure.

While the first season tend to focus too much on the fan service, fortunately the second season is improved with much better writing, a more serious tone.  Not only does the series try to integrate all Strike Witches, it also focuses on the respect of being a Strike Witch and what Yoshika and Mio would do to fight in combat in order to protect everyone.

While the first half of the season was a little lighthearted as the girl's had to prepare to be in battle, by the second half we start to see how Mio was dangerously close to engaging in battle but knowing that her powers are nearly depleted.  For Yoshika, she wants to fight but she also seems to have lost her ability and both are frustrated that they are not sure if they can fight this powerful Neuroi.  And it seems it may come down to one sacrificing their life in order to protect everyone.

So, I enjoyed the more seriousness of this second series over the first.

Overall, ""Strike Witches: Season 2"" is an  action anime series that tones down the fan service and monotony that the first series was full of and focuses on a more engaging story.  A much improved second season that I recommend on Blu-ray!",1354320000,,4344,4.961165048543689
