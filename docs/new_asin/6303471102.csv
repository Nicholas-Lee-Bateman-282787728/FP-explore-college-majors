652958,4,6303471102,"I am surprised the other reviewers found this workout difficult to follow.  This is the first Richard Simmons dancing tape I bought, and it's the one I do most often.  I have others like Dance Your Pants Off and Disco Sweat, but Sweatin' to the Oldies 3 seems to have better/easier choreography.  I found the others more difficult to follow.
Granted, there are a few moves that are difficult for me to do, and a couple of songs/dances I could REALLY do without (i.e. Rockin' Robin), but overall I feel this is a great video.  I generally alternate it with my Tae Bo and Kathy Smith tapes, yet it gives me just as good of a workout.",1015200000,5,631,4.367521367521367
652959,4,6303471102,"I have a library of VHS tapes and cookbooks by Richard.  This tape is not one I usually pick up first.  However, I enjoy changing them around and vary them throughout the month.  I had a little bit more trouble following this one.  For a baby boomer such as myself, sweatin' with Richard is a good way to try to stay limber and feel better about one's self.  But if I were on a budget, tape one or two would be my pick.",1011398400,4,419,4.0
652960,3,6303471102,"I have owned and used many of Richard's videos and enjoy each one for different reasons. Sweatin' to the Oldies 3 fell short, IMHO due to the simple fact that the choreography was choppy and very difficult to follow. I took years of dance and I couldn't follow the moves. Strange too, because it is the ONLY one of his videos I've had any problems following. Please decide for yourself; I returned mine and am using several other videos of Richard's instead.",1009411200,13,458,4.597560975609756
652961,4,6303471102,"I bought this tape on a whim because when i was in HS gym class we used to do this tape.  Boy was I in for a suprise when I first did this tape!  It is a great workout that really gets your heart pumping.  Plus the music is very fun to dance to.  Richard Simmons is an inspiration to us all.  He knows what it is like to be in a situation where you are at rock bottom, and he brings us out of it.  The beat is great, the songs are great and the workout is great.  The only problem I found with it was that Richard doesn't explain what the target heart rate is.  That is important to you when you are exercising.  Otherwise put on your dancing shoes and get to sweating!",977443200,4,669,3.860294117647059
652962,4,6303471102,"You get a good workout with Richard whether it's in person or on a tape. Beginners and Intermediates will find a lot to love in this tape: great  music, fun routines, lots of inspiration. This video has the sexiest moves  of any of his tapes, so I'd recommend staying away from it if you're  offended by that kind of thing. This one is fun, long, and not as easy as  it looks. But there are plenty of people to watch as examples of how to  either tone down the routine or jazz it up. The setting is like a carnival,  and the routine has as much energy as a carnival ride. Great fun!",965001600,20,582,4.106194690265487
652963,5,6303471102,"This sounds so american pie, but Sweating to The Oldies 3 really did change my life.  I lost 30 pounds doing it, and became alot closer to my brother as well.  If you saw a picture of me, you'd probably think I was  the last person to do a Richard Simmons workout, let alone excersize.  I  have tried other workouts, but they were all too boring for me.  Once I  tried this video, I seriously couldn't stop!  I was brought up on the  oldies, and now listen to goth, punk, techno & ska, but doing this made  me feel like a kid again ;o)  This probably sounds completely fabricated,  but I assure you, its true ;o)",930096000,29,612,4.181034482758621
652964,5,6303471102,"This is the first Richard Simmons video I've ever had the pleasure to use but I realy enjoyed it and so I'm buying my own copy. The tape starts with a good fast paced warm up and continues to get more intense as the different ""oldies"" are played. Then there's a nice cool down. The only thing I would like if Richard would talk more and tell you what was the next exercise. I did flounder a little trying to copy the exercises as they danced them w/o any instructions. I love the fact the dancers are all sizes... Karen  END",902275200,10,524,4.188118811881188

This video was such a joke that I couldn't even continue doing the whole workout routine before I hit the eject button.  I disliked the amusement park background theme and the people he has doing the exercise routines think they are auditioning for a big upcoming movie with their ""look at me, I'm sexy"" looks.  The exercises I did follow didn't have me sweatin' at all either!!!  I'd say skip this video entirely and don't waste your money.  Mine is going in the trash can.",1484179200,,638,4.56140350877193

So far, in the three weeks I've been exercising to Sweatin' to the Oldies 3, I've already lost almost 4 pounds! Each week, my pants fit just wee bit better and better. Only one of the exercise routines is a bit girly but you can modify the dance moves to make it more manly haha.

The warmups are great - and I have to admit I was sweating, but during the real exercise sessions I was more or less doing my own footwork...because this dude is all over the place!  There is no rhyme or reason to his choreography and I found myself practically tripping over myself trying to get the steps down.  For me, it was impossible.  I ended up doing my own thing until the session was over.  I was going to buy 1 and 2 as I really wanted to like this series but I am afraid they will just be more of the same.",1460419200,,593,3.9915254237288136

I will always recommend his work outs even the rushed one and he has soom that do feel rushed , like lets hurry and get this done.

It doesn't feel like you're working out because he's so entertaining and it just feels like dancing.

I love Richard, but absolutely hate this workout.  I don't like the amusement park background, the song arrangements or the moves.  It's very different from 2 and 4.  There are workout women trying to be too sexy as they exercise, which is distracting.  It's a little too fast paced all around.  I felt like we were blowing through the stretches. I don't like this one.",1446422400,4,514,4.56043956043956

653911,4,6303471102,"Although Richard Simmons is a little annoying, this program is engaging & energizing.  I've used the FoodMover before and like the immediate visual.  And I definitely like the change to the stretchy bands - separate bands.  One has to be careful, though, if you don't put the stretchy bands in your shoes, its easy to slip off during the exercise.

The only complaint I have of the Toning video - they don't indicate to you when to start using the stretchy bands and when to put them away - missed a few moments of exercise just catching up.",1439424000,,541,4.489795918367347

Yes, it's a bit cheesy at times and I know Richard Simmons isn't for everyone, but if you're trying to lose weight and don't want to go to an annoying gym, this is a great alternative. And if the workout is done correctly, much like the title -- you WILL sweat. Simmons is a great motivator and he is genuine about it. Not like Jillian Michaels and others who just tell at the camera and make you feel like crap because you're not thin. The music is great, the dancers are fun, and the dance moves are set up so that you can do your own simpler version or your own advanced version. Highly recommended.",1429056000,13,694,4.305343511450381

Later on, my mom got his Sweatin to the Oldies tape and I did that and enjoyed it. So, here it is, ages later, and I was looking for something to do on days I skipped the gym. I was disappointed. He's not really the best instructor. When he does some moves, he lets his knees go past his toes (no, no, no!) and he is constantly running up to the band after every song to cheer. I guess you could use that time to drink water, but after every single song?  Anyway, I just didn't care for it or the band or his instruction. Times do change.",1427155200,,655,3.962121212121212

I try to do my workout early in the morning before work and Tonin' to the Oldies is perfect for that. The workout is doable, yet very effective. I love the new Boogie cord, much much easier and more safe than the original one. I haven't used the Food Mover for I bought the set because it was much cheaper than buying one disc alone. I would recommend this workout to anyone that is extremely out shape as I was, and is looking to get active. The workout may seem difficult to keep up with after the first use, but by the third you'll have it down!",1418688000,,629,4.121951219512195

She put on a Sweatin' to the Oldies video (not sure which one--probably the original), and I remember it being really fun and a good workout. I've been working out a lot at home lately and decided to order this as a cardio supplement for my routine. I've gotta say...this wasn't nearly as fun as I had hoped, and not challenging at all. The early-'90s attire and hairstyles are amusing, but the exercises are far too easy. I did the whole thing, hoping it would get less boring and more challenging, but it never did. This might be good for someone just starting an exercise routine or someone who wants something very low-key. If you want a real workout, though, this isn't it.",1418083200,3,738,4.394160583941606

My only complaint is that the camera changes scenes very often (much of the time when he is changing moves.)  It gets a little confusing, but you get used to it once accustomed to the video.  It isn't a difficult workout...and great for those who aren't ready for the new high intensity workouts.  And who doesn't love Richard Simmons?  He is an American icon in the field of exercise.  He is kind, gentle, and non-judgemental.  This is a great video for beginners, for those starting over, for older adults, and for those who just want to have a great time moving to some great music!

When I first started, I found the exercise bands provided enough of a challenge for me, but as I used the video more frequently, I decided that I needed to take it up a notch. I've been exercising with 5 pound weights instead of the exercise bands, and I find that those provide for a more satisfying work out.",1399593600,,450,4.433734939759036

I'm still uncoordinated, and it takes me longer than the average person to learn, but at least I can't blame Richard in this case!!  I LOVE the toning video.  I use it after my aerobic workout three times a week, so I appreciated that the aerobic component isn't grueling, since I've already completed one of his other ""punishing"" workouts already...I have all of the Sweatin' series and alternate them daily, so I'm having lots of fun and FINALLY seeing some success (of course, I found out last year that my thyroid was shot and that in all likelihood played a part in my unsuccessful weight loss saga--and possibly the weight gain in the first place!!--but that's another story)...",1398470400,,812,4.6573426573426575

I discoverd that beginning...or starting over at the beginning...requires some fun and some consideration for the state of ones body.  Too many work out routines expect you to be fit before starting and are too complicated to follow.  Richard keeps the movements simple, puts them to great music, and helps to keep the beginner coming back for more.  Richard can be a little hokey at times but it simply makes me smile and keep on moving.

My favorite is Disco Blast-Off; that vcr tape is the one I use when I ""just don't wanna"".  I love the music. (I wish this one would come out in dvd, but so far I've only seen it in vcr tape.)  And Richard Simmons has real sized people in his exercise vcr tapes and dvds...not the impossibly thin people you see in other people's exercise vcr tapes and videos.

I was a Richard Simmons fan as a teenager when he had his TV show in the 80's, but had forgotten about him over the years and never thought I would need his help with fitness or weight loss, since I was a die-hard Tae Bo fan.  These workouts REALLY make me sweat----and i mean sweat like I haven't since I was about 20!!!  I have been eating a Gluten Free diet for my Celiac disease for about 7 years, and have been struggling with eating healthy and weight gain too.  The Foodmover has cleared up so much for me regarding portion sizes and a balanced diet---resulting in 10 lbs of weight lost in just over 2 weeks!  I LOVE Richard's energy and encouragement in the workout videos and in the Foodmover guide booklets.  This simple little kit is causing amazing changes in my health and my husband's too.  I can't wait to purchase the rest of the Richard Simmons workout DVDs sitting in my cart, as I have actually been able to workout 6 days a week without feeling exhausted and the workout are SO fun, an hour goes by much too fast!  I have bought, used and then ditched pretty much ALL the workout programs out there---Power 90, Tae Bo, P90X to name a few----mainly because they are too hard, too boring or just not inspiring enough to use more than a week, and additionally the programs never really TEACH healthy diet and portions.  Richard Simmons does----I am easting the same food I usually do, just in proper portions and I look forward to my daily workout, whether I'm Tonin' to the Oldies or Sweatin' to the Oldies.  And for less than $15.00, you can NOT go wrong just giving it a try for a couple of weeks.  In fact, I highly suggest getting the Slimaway Everyday binder for $5 here at Amazon, as it gives complete daily meal plans for 30 days and a complete workout schedule.",1375315200,5,1833,4.4094955489614245

""to drool over bodies""  doing movements to slim you down.
The people in his videos are all sizes and shapes-- no intimidation here.  All the newer
exercise videos that use music, dance, etc. to elevate your heart rate, help you lose weight and
tone up are just copies of what RS did years ago- except his all have a fun theme and extras.
I use to be able to keep up with the videos, and along with watching my diet, doing one every day,
or every other day, I lost 76 lbs. I remember when the nurse at my MD's office said to me
""Who knew this little person was inside the old you"".  It made me feel sooo good!
I can't keep up now after several years of not doing cardio or any other real exercise, however,
I know doing what I can each time now, reverting to walking in place when I get too winded,
and sticking to it,  I'll soon be able to keep up and lose these extra 32 lbs. I'm carrying again.

I had been walking 3 miles a day, but this was not helping my weight loss.  I got out my Sweatin' to the Oldies 2 video I purchased years ago and decided to try that.  At first, I could hardly hold out, but I continued to do daily.  I begin to see the weight come off, and noticed I was feeling better.  I was even able to stop my blood pressure medication.  After a few months, I decided I was ready for something more strenuous, so I purchased the Sweatin' to the Oldies 3 & 4. I absolutely love the #3 video!!! The music is wonderful - well, except for Rockin Robin - I just don't like that song.  At first, it was hard to keep up, but I paused the video and would do the steps over and over until I learned them.  Sweatin to the Oldies #3 is by far my favorite video.

First of all, it has that ridiculous skit at the beginning warning against making copies of the movies. It's stupid, you can't skip it, and it goes on forever.

The exercises themselves aren't any good. Richard doesn't spend enough time on the moves that are actually beneficial and way too much time on the ""filler"" moves. He changes too much and too fast, with NO warning that he is changing moves.

As always, the background is filled with people dressed for a 1980's party instead of working out.",1368403200,5,632,4.431034482758621

After seeing Richard Simmons' newest infomercial, Project HOPE, a couple weeks ago, I came to Amazon to see if I could purchase it here instead (no you can't, at least not yet!). Project HOPE is $60 for the basic kit and $100 for the kit with the dumbbells, plus shipping of almost $13 for either.

For less than $12, this is a bargain. Of course, these aren't the same DVD's you'd receive with Project HOPE, but there's nothing wrong with these older DVDs.

One of the DVDs, Straight from the Heart, is not a workout. It's a 25 minute long motivational DVD.

The Tonin' to the Oldies DVD (from 2009) is to be used with the included toning cords. It's 34 minutes long and has these songs:

1. Twist and Shout
2. Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini
3. The Lion Sleeps Tonight
4. Stop in the Name of Love
5. Moon River

The Sweatin' to the Oldies 5 DVD is 55 minutes long, also from 2009. It has these songs:

1. Soul Man
2. I Want You Back
3. Ain't Too Proud to Beg
4. Think
5. Downtown
6. Where The Boys Are
7. Hit the Road Jack
8. These Boots are Made for Walkin'
9. I Heard It Through the Grapevine
10. What the World Needs Now is Love Sweet Love

I read another review that the doors don't stay up on the Food Mover. You have to click them into place at the uppermost point. They stay up after you give it an extra-hard push to CLICK them.

I checked the stats to see if there was a difference in the electronic Food Mover which comes in Project HOPE, and the older Food Mover sold in this package. The food stats are identical, Richard never changed them over the years. (I ended up returning Project HOPE).

The toning cords are so-so. They have padded handles on one end, straps to put your feet into on the other. That funny latex rubber smell that makes me cough.

You can make fun of Richard and his circa-1980's shorts all you want, but his method of weight loss is tried and true: portion control and exercise that's fun. He never hawked whatever the latest fad diet was, throughout all these years.",1364256000,61,2489,4.902380952380953

Personally, I knew I wanted to try out the foodmover, and when I found that I could get all these extras along with it for such a low price, I jumped on that deal. I wouldn't be out much if I didn't end up liking the videos.

I'll review the included items seperately.

Foodmover: I'm unsure about this. I love the idea, and I love the foodmover itself. However, the diet itself seems a bit extreme. Richard suggests you start out with a blastoff week, which is 1200 calories a week. For many overweight people, that's going to put you in starvation mode. Thereafter, even the highest calorie plan gives you only two dairy options a day. That seems a bit low, especially since there are low calorie dairy items available and calcium is vital.

Videos: I haven't tried them all, but just be aware that these are not the original videos, they've been made in the past few years. I personally prefer the old ones. Just my opinion.

All in all, a great value if you know you want these videos and the foodmover.",1360281600,3,1101,4.435643564356436

Richard Simmons does a pretty good job calling the steps but the camera angles flying all over the place are dizzying.  I'm not good at dancing - frankly, I'm horrible at it - so not being able to concentrate on the trainer from one direction makes this work out a bit frustrating.  I've watched it, tried to follow it many times, and still can't get it right.  Sad!

It is typical Richard Simmons and we get to see some of the old timers from the first videos and how they've progressed.

I'd had purchased the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Collection-of-Sweatin-to-the-Oldies/dp/B000Z0UEV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Collection of Sweatin' to the Oldies</a>&nbsp;and found it to be a lot of fun. So I purchased the kit to add to what I already had and to check out the Food Mover.

I'd seen a lot of complaints about the Food Mover windows not staying closed. At first, I thought mine was one of those. However, I found that they click open and closed HARD. At first, I thought I would break them. But when I push hard, they click, and stay closed (or open). I keep wondering if there is an ap for this. Seems like a natural for one.

As far as the toning DVD goes, I really felt the workout. It was not a ""sweatin'"" workout like the others, but it really works the muscles. I liked that Richard does it to music and makes it fun. Afterwards, I knew I'd done a workout and couldn't believe how much energy I had throughout the day after doing it.

I also watched the Straight from the Heart DVD. Basically, on this DVD Richard talks a little about how he got started doing this, about key elements in losing weight, which, to him, include exercise, toning, and portion control. He talks about how he hasn't swayed from this in over 35 years and that it still works.

I love all the ""sweatin' DVDs and they have gotten me up and moving again. They make it fun and make me want to do it every day. I don't feel like I have to be perfect when I do it, or like I have to look like a model. I just get up and start moving... and the 'sweatin' DVDs WILL make you sweat.",1344643200,41,1692,4.6112956810631225
655979,5,6303471102,"I know there are a lot of newer CD's for working out. But, to me they are all spinoffs of Richard Simmons; he is the original. I love the way he loves everyone and encourages everybody. He is always uplifting.",1343692800,,209,4.25
655980,4,6303471102,"The DVDs are fine (haven't used them all, but they arrived in perfect condition).  The toning cords are neat !  I like that they just go over my feet, and are secured that way. They are latex for anybody with allergies- but the straps that touch skin are woven straps, with a padded hand-hold thingie.  The Food Mover is where I've had some issues- and I think mine may be a weird one from what I've heard from others on his FB page (the REAL Richard Simmons, not some of the impostors who say horrible things about overweight people).  The little windows only stay open or closed on a flat surface- per other people, they do latch shut for carrying out to lunch or dinner (or whatever).  I'm at home about 99% of the time (disabled), so it's not the end of the world.

I like having a visual reminder of what I'm allotted (and it's quite a bit), and what I've eaten/have left.  The overall 'program' is very close to the diabetic exchanges of the past. I've been an RN for 27 years, and a diabetic for 17- so I know the exchanges; this works very well for me.  I gained weight with chemo (I know- I expected to lose weight, and did initially, but the combination of oral chemo that I was on for a YEAR blew me up like a toad- very discouraging after surviving what could have killed me, and almost did (leukemia), only to end up FAT).

Some people think Richard Simmons is over the top.  But he's also effective, and doesn't shun people who most in society think are inferior because of weight issues.  He also cares- and responds to people personally.  His staffs' responses are clearly marked; his are from HIM !!  That sort of encouragement is invaluable.",1343001600,110,1659,4.4

This is my Review on Sweatin to the Oldies 3 Aerobic Concert for the VHS.

My dad got this originally for his own personal use to lose weight back in the early 1990's back then I was a little kid and use to excerise with my dad because I enjoyed the music. To this day I still have the VHS tape & still use it today to work out to.  If it ever break's I'm buying it on dvd to use.  When my dad started usuing this to excerise he lost about 30 or 40 pounds back then and I lost some weight from excerising to this to.  So I can defently say that this VHS tape defently work's for losing weight and is the best method I've seen out anywhere.

Get this VHS tape or if your lucky buy it on dvd then you'll know it will last longer.

By th eway the only reason why I didn't review this earlier was because I didn't know amazon sold this.

656067,5,6303471102,"Having started my adventures in home work-out videos with Richard Simmons' Sweatin' to the Oldies, I promptly picked up this third ""aerobics concert"" in the ""Oldies"" series. This tape is considerably more difficult (and longer, at about 50 minutes) than the first Sweatin' to the Oldies, but it is still well within the grasp of a very overweight beginner like me. Like the others, it will take the viewer a few runs through to begin to get the moves down, as Richard gives pretty minimal cues. This tape begins with an easy warm up tune, followed by two easy-paced numbers to stretch and warm up the upper and lower parts of the body. Then the dancing takes off with four up-tempo dance pieces. The intensity of your work-out very much depends on the energy you put into it, and the many exercisers (of all shapes and sizes!) demonstrate a broad range of effort with which you can experiment to find the level that suits your conditioning. A slower, cool-down dance follows, and the tape concludes with a stretching sequence. I personally don't care for this stretching routine, as I prefer slower, more sustained stretching than the rhythmic stretches Richard leads.  As with all the Simmons exercise videos, you musn't miss the line-up after the stretching, when his exercisors are introduced and their weight-loss accomplishments shown.

I always ended up ""sweatin"" along with my mom whenever she'd do it, but not to lose weight, just to have fun. Finally in junior high I began to realize I needed to make a serious change and I began doing Richard's tapes almost every night. Midway thru highschool, I had dropped almost 60 pounds and I credit him with a lot of my success. This specific video is tops. I don't like ""Sweatin"" 2 very much for whatever reason and the first one got old a long time ago, but somehow it stands that this one is a keeper for me.  My favorite ditty is ""I get around""...it's actually surprisingly vigorous for Richard!
