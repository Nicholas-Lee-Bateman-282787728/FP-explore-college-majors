8067638,5,B0009VT6UK,Spencer Tracy in my opinion was the finest motion picture actor of all time having said that I believe any of his films are worth seeing father's little dividend is particularly good. There's a lot of warmth and humanity in it and a fair bit of humor. This follow-up to father of the bride is a particularly vibrant movie especially for sequel. This is a very good movie and I think one that's worth watching. A definite thumbs up,1444435200,,430,4.455696202531645
