3035302,3,B000YV1F8Q,"The Newman/Redford classic is my favorite film, and this doesn't compare--but I doubt its producers intended anyone to try. It would be more reasonable to compare this to ""Alias Smith and Jones,"" the 1971-73 TV series inspired by ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.""

Everything about this 89-minute film, made in 2003, suggests it was a television pilot for a series that didn't sell. (The PG-13 rating is a mystery given that there's no nudity, no cursing, and less violence than you'd see in a typical episode of ""Law and Order."") The film establishes the relationship between a young Cassidy, Sundance, and their mutual love interest, Etta, and sets the scene for their continuing adventures as likeable outlaws pursued by a Pinkerton-agent nemesis. Historically accurate? Certainly not. But neither was the 1969 film. And no, the acting isn't Oscar- or even Emmy-worthy, but the leads are attractive and appealing--especially Ryan Browning, who plays the Sundance Kid.

If you lower your expectations from classic Western to lighthearted TV movie, you'll probably enjoy this little film and perhaps even regret that the series never materialized. But rent it as I did or wait until you spot it in a $3 or $5 bargain bin. It's definitely not worth the current $19.99 price.",1205366400,8,1278,5.080952380952381
3035303,1,B000YV1F8Q,"This was absolutely horrible.  I love westerns and rent every one that ever comes out but this was the worst I can remember in a long time sitting through.  The acting sucked(I have never seen so many cowboys grinning), and the plots were ridiculous.  After destroying a railroad car in a botched robbery attempt, the Pinkertons think they are dead and the duo next show up in a Mexican town protecting the citizens from 'banditos'.  Probably would reccomend for the under 13 age group.",1204848000,5,486,4.75
3035304,4,B000YV1F8Q,"Although this movie may not be entirely Historically Accurate, it is an enjoyable movie. It is a ""Popcorn Movie"" that should be watched as entertainment and not as a historical documentary. The acting suffers at times, and the sets could be better, but for it to not be a Major Movie Budget film it does quite well and holds together. The ending does leave you wondering a bit and yearning for more, but overall, definately worth watching. Fun Movie.",1203984000,9,450,4.708860759493671
3035305,3,B000YV1F8Q,"A few problems here: The movie ended at an awkward place making you want to know more. Overall, interesting but not quite accurate. For any film makers out there - read ""Butch Cassidy - A Biography"" by Richard Patterson. Make a movie based on this book.",1203984000,3,253,4.521739130434782

8234076,4,B000YV1F8Q,"""The Legend of Butch and Sundance"" is an entertaining film. But it's the type of film where you have to check your brain in at the door. Unlike the 1969 film, this movie tells the chronological story of Butch and Sundance. From the creation of The Wild Bunch, to the love triangle between Butch, Sundace, and Etta Place, to their departure from the United States to South America. Even though there are some historical inaccuracies, this film tells the true story much better than the 1969 movie. I'd say if it's a friday night, plug this one in and give it a go.",1474416000,,563,4.475728155339806

8234079,5,B000YV1F8Q,"Excellent western about the early years of Butch and Sundance.  The music score by Basil Poledouris is also well worth buying.  He is known for also scoring ""Lonesome Dove.""  I purchased both the movie and the soundtrack and frequently listen to the music while driving to work.",1411948800,2,278,4.872340425531915
8234080,4,B000YV1F8Q,I love Westerns. This take on two well known characters makes me broaden my interest in that period and draws me more into that very special world.,1394236800,,147,4.481481481481482
8234081,5,B000YV1F8Q,Loved this movie and was a great addition to my western movie collection.. I have always wanted to see this movie but never had so I finally seen it on here and ordered it with no regrets...,1389225600,,190,4.162162162162162
8234082,5,B000YV1F8Q,"I actually liked this movie a lot.  I haven't seen the original and hope to watch it someday.  This however is really fun.  I like Etta's story the best. She seems to have every man she runs into tied around her finger and Butch and Sundance are going to have their hands full with her. The movie ends on that note indicating, this could go on into a sequel or two.

I would like to have seen a television series based on this, but I don't know of one created from it.

The acting is well done in my opinon.  I think its a great cast supported by a fun script.  I am sure the directing lent itself to the fun and affection for the characters.  Definitely a keeper in my opinion.  I sure would like to see more by leading actress Rachelle.

The plot is good too.  There are enough surprising twists to entertain modern audiences demands.  Its not the most brain twisting movie, but it certainly is a great plot.  Just when you think things are getting predictable, the story takes another turn.  of course this varies from any actual historical account, but it makes for fantastic entertainment and feeds the overall legend.

I say this is a great date movie.  There is nothing objectionable about the movie except for the killing which is shown in most westerns.  Blood-letting is played down although the body count is high enough.  There is little sexuality presented in kissing and one scene when the boys spy on Etta.  Nothing more than leg and shoulders is shown though, so parents don't need to be concerned.

This movie warmed my heart and now appears on my holiday gift list.  I certainly hope to find more movies just as fun and memorable as this one.",1311206400,,1660,4.4485049833887045
8234083,4,B000YV1F8Q,"So, ok, it is not Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid but I watched it not expecting it to be and therefore really enjoyed this movie. I would never even try to compare it, so, as a movie in its own right, it is good, fun viewing - probably better than lots of the block-buster rubbish out there these days. So, don't compare - just watch!",1292630400,,338,4.136363636363637
8234084,5,B000YV1F8Q,"Received this item in good time and in good condition.  Unfortunately, my dvd player has been broken and I have not been able to watch it yet.",1212969600,,142,4.2592592592592595
