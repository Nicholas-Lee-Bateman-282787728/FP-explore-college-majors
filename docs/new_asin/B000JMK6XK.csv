Amparo Rivelles and Arturo de Cordova made an excellent job.

If you like Mexican movies ; this is one you should watch .

There's some subtitles for those who don't speak Spanish language.

The DVD quality picture is O.K.",1174867200,4,289,4.39622641509434

Esta es una joya de la cinematografa que al aigual que otras, los amantes al cine mexicano debemos de comprar en el exterior y es donde me pregunto a que se debe de que en nuestro propio pas no las tengamos.

De igual manera, ""El Vampiro"" una pelicula que compite con el Dracula de Holywood tuve que importarla de Francia.

Afortunadamente estas dos son ya parte de mi coleccin.",1173744000,,448,4.506172839506172
