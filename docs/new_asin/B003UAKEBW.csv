4194744,3,B003UAKEBW,"Twists and raucous activity for mobster types in a category with many others. Not a bad escape, but not an exceptional movie at all. I would have rather rented or checked this dvd out, but I own it now and it's OK.
Violence, not much sex/nudity, language, and no obvious political agenda. Mature audience and teenage boys might like it.",1318809600,,336,4.616666666666666
4194745,4,B003UAKEBW,"This is a comedy crime caper from director Ian Fitzgibbon. It has a galaxy of Irish stars and Jim Broadbent doing a passable accent as the father of the hero Cillian Murphy. He plays Michael, who owes money to the Mr Perrier and unlike the water of the same name, he is far from soft.

The film opens with Michael being told he has until ten that night to find the thousand Euros. Meanwhile his neighbour Brenda, (Jodie Whitaker) and crush from afar is having boyfriend trouble, his estranged father appears to announce, that the next time he falls asleep, he will die and he gets offered a job with a Mr Mutt to rob a house for some ready cash. The latter plan seems like a no brainer, and so he signs up. Things go sour when Mr Perrier's henchman and gay lovers, turn up to break a few bones, one of them gets more than he bargains for. In the rituals of the underground, Michael and Brenda have gone too far and thus a bounty is put on their heads.

What follows in a tale that has dark comedy, loads of profanity and some quite good performances, we also meet a load of trophy dogs, wheel clampers, coke dealers and generally the seedier side of Dublin life. Brendan Gleeson is as ever excellent as the Mr P and gets more than his fair share of good one liners. This is not great cinema, but it is a ruddy good journey and with both action, a love interest and an examination of both family and animal values, but where it scores highest is the gallows humour, so if that is your thing then I am sure you will enjoy. A word should go to the Irish Film Board which keeps helping innovative cinema with funding as is the case here, it is a shame the UK has lost its' council.",1316044800,3,1677,4.221183800623053
4194746,4,B003UAKEBW,"You've got a great cast, Brendan Gleeson, Jim Broadbent, and Cillian Murphy. All great actors together in a quirky film about crime, a debt that must be paid, and a little love. I love to see Cillian in these rolls as opposed to the ""bad guy"" he portrays in some of his other films. You find yourself rooting for him throughout the film. To me, this is like an Irish Guy Ritchie film...and that's a good thing! Broadbent keeps the comedy throughout the film while Gleeson keeps the suspense.",1314489600,,491,4.52808988764045

I was going to ask why there are only two reviews of this here but then I remembered how deep the brogue is in some scenes; a large chunk of America would probably find this mostly unintelligible. I'm pretty good with most Brit/Scot/Irish accents but still had to use the subtitles a few times. Better to just let it all run by though, because the pacing here is so perfect. This might in fact just be the best Dublin comedy of them all, beating out no small amount of fine competition (though Intermission is hard to top, and also penned by PB writer Mark O'Rowe...watch this guy as he grows, he's a real gem).

The script is tight and darkly hilarious, the direction crisp and properly slick, and all of the acting is solid, especially the principals, with Gleeson stealing the show as usual. Broadbent is also very funny at points, as is the whole cast. The violence is wisely and thankfully toned down from other recent UK mob flick rates (The Crew, etc), so the humor and weirdness can take the fore. Which they do, to much laughter. There are a boatload of good dramedies coming across the pond lately...please don't stop! You're blowing away the mediocre competition in Hollywood, and those of us who love to laugh are mighty pleased about it.

If you like Brit mob films, especially the cynically funny ones by Guy Ritchie and his pack of imitators (he's the UK QT (and better if you ask me)), then Perrier's Bounty should make you laugh out loud many times over.",1298419200,6,1482,4.543071161048689
4194748,5,B003UAKEBW,"This film was a pleasant surprise ! Made very much like in the fashion of ""In Bruges"", it is a gritty, dark story, but this movie is also pretty funny in its' own special way.

Brendan Gleeson is perfect for the role of the irish ""Mobster"" and (oh, blue-eyed) Cillian Murphy is a real pleasure to watch as Michael, the guy in deep, deep trouble. And while you think that things can not get any worse, they do because of the ""help"" of his neigbour Brenda (very well acted by Jodie Whittaker) and his ""nutty"" father Jim (funny Jim Broadbent)...

I really, really enjoyed this film !",1291939200,5,580,4.411214953271028
4194749,4,B003UAKEBW,"This is a good film. If youi like the way too many times mentioned ""Lock, stock and 2 smoking barrels"", or ""In Bruges"", you'll like this. The witty repartee had me rolling on the floor. The dad was excellent. Cilian Murphy was also very good. I place this a tier below ""Layer Cake"", and I consider that high praise indeed. It's a lot better than recent films like The Bank Job. Get this and be prepare to laugh. And not only, but also, be prepared to be entertained.",1283644800,6,466,4.306818181818182

4194779,4,B003UAKEBW,Good movie with an interesting plot. Although the acting was excellent the characters were not developed enough. The movie moved at a rapid pace which keeps your attention but again almost made it difficult to fully understand the back drop story.

8405770,5,B003UAKEBW,"Wow! Cillian Murphy continues to deliver great performances. He excels at being a loser who gets backed into a corner that he must fight his way out of. Brendan Gleeson is admirably crazy and cruel. Jim Broadbent is excellent as the dad who Cillian would prefer not to talk to. Even the underlying ""why"" Cillian is the way he is shows the magic of Irish cinema.",1444176000,,361,4.484848484848484
