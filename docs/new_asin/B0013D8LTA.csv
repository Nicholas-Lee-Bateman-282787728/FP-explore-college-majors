8250061,5,B0013D8LTA,"Dr. Roizen's chief skill is explaining rather involved medical terminology with wonderful metaphors making it easy to understand. He knows a lot. But he makes it simple. He is a well-recognized expert with top credentials. How to slow aging? He compares our body to a car. If our body uses energy in the form of glucose, a car uses energy in the form of gasoline. How can we get our bodies to go not merely 500 miles on 20 gallons, but 750 miles on 13 gallons -- that is how can we live longer with less glucose? Roizen argues that eating less food forces our body (which does this automatically, subconsciously) to remove extra seats, inflate the tires properly, add oil, tune-up the engine, drive at the proper speed -- our bodies automatically make smart choices at the cellular level. It will slow aging. And Roizen's suggestion confirms things I've read elsewhere and see in living examples (I know a spry 98-year-old lady who eats very little but is amazingly strong for her age). And it is based on good science too (medical researchers use the term ""caloric deprivation""). Roizen has an excellent sense of humor, knows medicine, and explains clearly. What he doesn't do is explain in precise terms how much of specific foods we should be eating (he recommends foods such as avocados, tomatos, fresh fruits and vegetables, extra virgin olive oil, fish oil, etc) but this is more of a matter for us personally or in consultation with our doctors or nutritionists. Highly recommended.
