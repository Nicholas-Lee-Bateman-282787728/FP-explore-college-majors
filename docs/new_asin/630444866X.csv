7871592,5,630444866X,"After seeing a short segment On The Classic Arts Showcase which is broadcast 24hrs a day seven days a week on the Dish Network 9406 I have purchased many dvds to add to my library and am at a loss as to why this product which was originally aired on PBS network why it is not available in the USA on DVD.  You can buy on Amazon with warning that the product is only available with a Region code # 2 not playable in this country.  Anyway if you can get it on vhs tape do so.  You'll enjoy the 90 minutes.  I got my vhs for $1.99, the shipping and handling 2.98.  It's still is to be enjoyed again and again.  Hope to transfer to dvd so I can segment songs so I can get to several of my favorites asap.",1280016000,,700,3.8943661971830985
