2876335,5,B000RXZII4,I have done Tae-Bo for several years.  I enjoy this workout!  The amped bar really makes my arms look better.  Great workout.,1234483200,,125,4.590909090909091
2876336,5,B000RXZII4,This is a great continunce to the first five of Tae Bo Amped. Love the system- it helped me get back into shape after having baby. I always say I just got my butt kicked form Billy Blanks!!!,1233705600,,190,4.026315789473684
2876337,5,B000RXZII4,"I have about 10 of Billys DVD's. I work out 6 days a week, taking off Sunday. I use the Get Amped DVD's on Mondays because they are not that intense. I can ease back into my week a bit easier this way. Unless you have your room temperature set to over 100, or if the most heavy thing you lift up during an average day is a marshmallow to place in your hot chocolate, you aren't going to sweat much with this workout. Ultimate Boot Camp does that for me, but I am nearly completly dry when I finish this workout. I do feel that it is valuable, and produces some results. It has really nothing to do with the Amplifier however. I do have one that I use, but I have done the routine many times with simply two different length sticks from Home Depot that cost a whole lot less, and feel no difference between that, and using the Amplifier. Without either devices, I can still do the workout, but it is a bit more fun using the toys. As I said, It's a good Monday week starter workout.",1229040000,4,981,4.114583333333333
2876338,5,B000RXZII4,"I have many Tae Bo DVDs and I especially love this set. It is something a little different from the high action cardio Billy that I have come to enjoy.  This is a calmer but sweat inducing sclupting program that really works well. This set is great as it offers variety to Tae Bo fans like me. Be sure to note that Billy uses the ""Amped"" Amplifier Bar accessory throughout some of the workouts.  As always, the workouts can be done successfully wihout the bar, but I mention it because it can be disappointing to order a DVD and realize an extra to-be-purchased-separately accessory is featured.  Overall, I think you may enjoy this one.",1226188800,3,637,4.5701754385964914
2876339,5,B000RXZII4,"Loved all three.  Keep in mind this is not a set that is for cardio emphasis.  Although yes you do get the heart rate up...it is more sculpting and spot training.  I loved the rockin' buns....abs are good too. I think I have some curse or something because I can never seem to not have some sort of ""pain"" after I finish and ab workout.  Sculpt express is awesome and you will be sweating.",1218240000,3,389,4.216216216216216
2876340,4,B000RXZII4,"Great investment!  The amped bar does make it easier to do the workouts correctly(great for beginners).  You can do them without the bar; you just have to concentrate on your form more.
Rock N Abs has given me a nice six pack.  Rock N Buns is the hardest of the three.  It took several attempts before I could do the whole workout.  Rock N Sculpt is the easiest of the three.  I didn't even work up a sweat.  It's more upper body than lower.  Great for a light day when you don't feel like working out, or the day after Rockin buns(when your buns are hurting.).

I don't know that I would recommend these workouts for someone totally out of shape.  If you can do the advanced workouts, your should be able to do these.",1215561600,15,718,4.2518518518518515
2876341,5,B000RXZII4,"I love taebo and Billy definitely delivers in this Amped series, my fave is the Rockin' Buns guaranteed to burn the fat off your lower body, you will shake and tremble executing the lunges and squats.  You can use the amplifier bar if you wnat to or execute the moves without it.  You will feel the burn so you have to give some to get some.  I love working out with the same team of people, the hip music and the  comtemporary setting.  Billy never fails to motivate and encourage you to go that last set of 8.  I have all the dvds in the amped series -  I love them all.",1200009600,,572,4.053571428571429
2876342,5,B000RXZII4,"I've been doing Tae-BO for about five years and my favorite has always been ""Get Ripped Advanced"" but I decided to give ""Amped Rock n Sculpt"" a try.  I'm very happy to say I didn't waste my money and I incorporate it in with the Get Ripped series.  On two dvds you get three amazing workouts. Each workout is approximately 45 minutes long.  -VERY IMPORTANT- There is an ""Amped Bar"" used to add resistance to the moves but if you add pressure to the muscle you're working or you use 3 lb. weights, you'll still feel the results.  Rockin Abs incorporates standing and floor moves and each ""move"" has an ""amped"" section to it, where the move is done a little faster.  You'll probably want to use a yoga mat for the floor section.  Then there's ""Rockin Buns"" which totally works the hell out of your legs and buns.  Finally there's ""Sculpt Express"" where arms and legs are worked out hard!  All three workouts are challenging and you will feel the aches within two days!! I'm so glad I took a chance on Amped Rock n Sculpt!!!",1199750400,33,1021,4.422459893048129
2876373,5,B000RXZII4,"I love the three workouts. The workouts are from Tae Bo Amped. So you realy need the Amplifier bar. You get three workouts on two DVDs. Every workout is soooo great. You get sculpt express, a upper body workout with a little bit of lower body and cardio at the end. Rock'in abs and Rock'in buns are the other two workouts. Rock'in abs is my favorite. You feel the burn also in the other workouts.
So five stars for Billy's great workouts.",1317427200,2,438,4.353658536585366
2876374,5,B000RXZII4,what can I say but great' the amp bar toned muscles I didn't know I had and gave me more stertgh,1302912000,,96,3.619047619047619
2876375,4,B000RXZII4,"Tough butt and ab workouts, your muscles will be jell-o the first time you do it, if you don't work out regularly.  I walk 4 miles a day, 4 days a week, but I haven't done Tae-Bo for years and it kicked my butt!  I don't have the Amp Bar so I substituted a baseball bat :)  And get a mat for the floor work.  My hip joints digging into the floor were quite uncomfortable.  I gotta say...I really miss the original Tae-Bo workouts, haven't found them on DVD.

My one real complaint....I can't stand Shelly's persistant and prevalent gutteral scream....what the hell does ""Ah-Sahhhh"" mean???  She repeats it over and over thru both the ab and bun workouts.  So irritating!  Broaden the vocab, chick.  I haven't done the Sculpt Express yet, but I'm sure I'll have to listen to it on that one too.  I'll be muting the sound and playing a CD instead.",1298160000,3,845,4.387096774193548
2876376,5,B000RXZII4,Already had another 2 of the Tae Bo DVDs and got this one. I really like it. It's simple but gets tougher as the exercises go on to the last one. i'd recommend it!!,1293321600,,164,3.8529411764705883
2876377,4,B000RXZII4,"The ab workout is pretty good  but the bootcamp ab is much better.  The sculpt is really good except not enough leg work for me.  Its great for the arms though!  I just use 3 or 5 lb weights instead of the bar.
The leg workout is pretty good too.  I was sore on my thighs but wished there was more bun work!",1276214400,2,307,3.8095238095238093
2876378,5,B000RXZII4,"I am fairly fit and exercise regularly. After I had my first baby, I wanted to get back into shape.  This is a very good workout and I was toning up after a couple of weeks.",1265760000,2,173,3.8055555555555554
2876379,5,B000RXZII4,"YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! YES YES YES YES!!! This DVD is pretty awesome. My legs & buns felt like there were going to explode! The BUNS and THIGHS workout was awesome. You will be drenched in sweat.  ENJOY IT, I DID.  It comes with another workout but I haven't done that one yet.",1263427200,,274,4.46
2876380,5,B000RXZII4,"I have quite a few Billy Blanks DVDs and this is the best so far. I love them all, but the Rockin Abs and Rockin Buns is extremely beneficial. I have lost 3"" and 7 lbs since beginning this workout and I am becoming extremely toned. Me and my friend absolutely love this DVD and I would highly recommend it to those who love a challenging, yet effective workout",1250467200,,360,4.231884057971015
2876381,5,B000RXZII4,"I have done almost every single Billy Blanks workout, and have been a devout follower for 10+ years.  These are my absolute favorites.  I was expecting a moderate abs and buns workout, but I was completely surprised when I did both of these the first time.  Sore does not explain it.  These are perfect for targeting specific spots on your body.  This is the best lower body workout I have ever done.  It is difficult, but you will see very quick results.  This is not what you want to get if you are looking for a total body/cardio workout because they are shorter than the other videos.  Works best for me on days when I feel I need to spot train.  There are lots of new variations on current moves.  If you are accustomed to the Taebo/Bootcamp/Amped workouts - this one will make you burn.",1250208000,,792,4.4
2876382,1,B000RXZII4,i have a cardio workout taebo dvd that i have been using for a couple months(that i love). when i tried this one it was just way too hard - unless you've already been doing strength training on legs and abs i don't suggest this to anyone,1245110400,3,237,4.0638297872340425
8203025,5,B000RXZII4,"I had the original set for many years before discovering this set of 3 accompying workouts and was so glad I found it!!!Love all 3 of these and like the Original set,I actually look forward to using these and they really make me feel a burn!!I think my favorite is Rockin Abs because that's my trouble spot and I hate traditional crunches and planks-this incorporates cardio and twisting moves and the time flies-usually I can't wait to get Abs work over with. I highly recommend these and usually use them at the end of the day when I'm usually too tired to work out because they are so much fun,yet make me feel so strong!",1512345600,,624,4.434782608695652
8203026,2,B000RXZII4,"Got back into Tae Bo around the holidays and found a great deal on this DVD. Just isn't one of my favorites. Maybe I missed reading that there is an ""amped"" bar used in the workouts. I much prefer the platinum collection dvds.",1460764800,,226,4.27906976744186
8203027,5,B000RXZII4,"This is a serious workout! Your abs, arms, and legs will be burning and kicking some serious fat butt. I love it!",1430265600,,113,4.181818181818182
8203028,5,B000RXZII4,Love these workouts!,1423612800,,20,6.0
8203029,5,B000RXZII4,"This is a great workout! Tae Bo and the gangs will help keep you moving and motivated. His words are true, if you are looking to shed the weights off.... There are none like this...ever. This is the real stuff. Plus, it is fun.",1420848000,,227,4.181818181818182
8203030,5,B000RXZII4,A great workout video that focuses on different parts of the body that I didn't know muscles even existed. I would definitely recommend this one to others.,1386288000,,155,4.777777777777778
8203031,5,B000RXZII4,I do like this workout it does focus on specific areas which is nice. I have other DVD's of Billy Blanks and have not found one I do not like yet.,1364428800,,146,3.7419354838709675
8203032,5,B000RXZII4,"This is a great video, but I have twice pulled a mid-shoulder muscle.  I wish I could continue, because it has great twisting excercises for the waist line, but it honestly pulled my left upper shoulder muscle each time.",1364083200,,220,4.641025641025641
8203033,5,B000RXZII4,"Another good workout from Billy Blanks...Every one of these workouts work IF you put in the effort.  I actually like doing the amped workouts without the amplifier bar and just use 2 pound hand weights because I think you feel more of a burn but if you really put in the effort you should, you will feel the burn from these workouts.  And just as a reference I workout regularly, at least 1 hr/day 5days/week but usually 1 hr. 45 mins./day 5 days/week so I am in good shape and have lost about 40 pounds last year and have kept it off.",1335484800,,535,4.235294117647059
8203034,5,B000RXZII4,"This workout system is absolutely awesome. My whole family enjoys doing it together. In a matter of just a couple of weeks, we can already tell a difference. Wouldn't use anything else.",1318809600,,185,4.8125
