6245570,4,B00I099JY6,"A superb collection, both this and Volume 1 play wonderful. The transfers and sound are great, even considering the age of the original masters. Note: these are subtitles only, no English dubs. A few typos and other punctuation errors in the subtitles are the only thing preventing me from giving this collection 5 stars, otherwise they are perfect.",1403222400,2,349,5.0344827586206895
6245571,5,B00I099JY6,They have cleaned up the Gamera movies and added footage to them. I have several films of Gamera and was greatly surprised that the films actually had more scenes. This collection is a welcome addition to anybody wishing to complete their Gamera series.,1402790400,,253,4.906976744186046
6245572,5,B00I099JY6,"Yes I know, most will say, even I...these last 4 movie do not stand high on the meter of greatness, but they are part of a collection and if you're like me, you acquired the 90's Gamera trilogy blu-rays before now. If not, I tell you now, they're a must have as well. But don't let these pass you by, if you bought the 1st set, you need this too.",1401667200,3,346,3.9571428571428573
6245573,5,B00I099JY6,"Watching Gamera on Blu-ray was a treat. My childhood memories of Saturday mornings watching the creature feature were not tarnished by the updated visuals. Although these movies are 40 years old, they look and sound pretty good, much better than the old DVD's I have been watching for years.",1401494400,3,291,4.959183673469388
6245574,5,B00I099JY6,"Finally, all of the old Showa era Gamera films in one collection, and in their original aspect ratios and languages! As a kaiju buff this is like manna from heaven.

A note to those who are on the fence, there are no English options for the films. For purists like myself this is just fine, but if you are picking up some monster movies for the kids, they better be able to read or speak Japanese, or there will be some confused kiddos sitting in front of the TV.",1400544000,6,463,4.202247191011236
6245575,5,B00I099JY6,"First off, I love Gamera and Godzilla. I watched them on TV when I was a kid,  so I'm kinda bias. I do have the previous releases and liked them. I only got these for the better picture and sound. I do think they looked better, plus you can choose between the four movies on one disc. The down sides are that these four movies are the ladder half of the original series and the budget kept shrinking with each movie. Most people I know absolutely hated the last movie. Also, there is no extras and no choice of audio. It's just in Japanese with English subtitles. I was very happy with my purchase, But I love the cheesy special effects and I always watch them in Japanese with in English subtitles even when I have the choice.",1399075200,2,727,4.268115942028985
6245576,4,B00I099JY6,"The prints on this new low-price Gamera set are beautiful, really lovely.  Full marks for that.  But, if you're a follower of this series, you know that the Gamera films get goofier and their budgets diminish as they go.  Really, they're kiddie fare by this point, and some are more suited to MST3K viewing than serious watching.

Still, props to Mill Creek for doing this set and making it look so great.  It's nice to see the films in their original aspect ratios and in the original Japanese (with English subs), though that also means you're less likely to share these flicks with their original, intended audience: younger children.  (Kids don't tend to be crazy about subtitles.)

But for kaiju collectors, this is still a great set at a great price.  Only 4 out of 5 stars because, well, the films are lesser efforts -- and because the disc (all 4 HD prints on one blu ray) is bare bones, with no dubs or extras.  How much you like them will depend on how much you love the genre, and Gamera in particular.",1398729600,10,1013,4.491803278688525
6245577,3,B00I099JY6,"This is the best version of these movies, but man, are they rough to get through. I would recommend this only for hard-core kiaju fans.",1447459200,,135,4.44
6245578,4,B00I099JY6,"What can be said about Gamera that hasn't already been said. Some of the movies are good, some are just passable. He's no Godzilla but is a friend to all children. May latex monsters live on forever...",1430697600,,201,4.45945945945946

6245581,5,B00I099JY6,Perfect sales transaction. No worries or complaints here.,1427155200,,57,6.25

6245584,3,B00I099JY6,"This blu-ray edition is good, great to see all these Gamera movies in their Japanese release form except for one thing - NO ENGLISH DUBBING!  English subtitles yes, dubbing no. Everything else is as expected.  The problem I believe is that the film company never released these in America completely so the English dubbing is only  for those edited releases.  So you have to watch the screen from beginning to end to understand the dialogue (unless you speak Japanese). But the clarity and sound quality is refreshing after seeing these movies in less worthy condition.",1421107200,,569,4.957894736842105
6245585,5,B00I099JY6,"For those of you who like your monsters old-school, these classic Gamera flicks are great fun and endlessly rewatchable. If, by chance, you're a fan of early Toho but have yet to experience the insanity that is Gamera, don't delay in giving these unique films a try.

I think you'll be amazed... I was!",1420588800,,302,4.592592592592593

6245595,4,B00I099JY6,"After buying the Gamera: Ultimate Collection Vol. 1, I purchased and watched Vol. 2.  I have never been a HUGE Japanese Mega-Monster fan, I do appreciate these movies.  And am glad that these are in my collection.
  So if you are one of those who enjoy this type of film, than having this in your collection, at this price, is nice to have",1410912000,,339,4.333333333333333

6245598,4,B00I099JY6,"The last four entries on what is known as the showa era. and have the ""freind to all children"" theme in all of them. The last ont one, Gamera super monster is strange as it's basically a clip show with an original story about some alien invading wrapped them. so just a warning before you watch it.",1409270400,,298,4.245614035087719

6245602,5,B00I099JY6,"Surprisingly great picture restoration. These are the full length restored Japanese versions of the films. If your into these types of B movies, I believe you will enjoy them. NOTE: There are no English Audio Tracks on these movies. The English dialog is captioned in Japanese, and the Japanese dialog is captioned in English. If your a student of learning Japanese, you might have fun trying to follow the language.",1407196800,,416,4.957142857142857
6245603,3,B00I099JY6,"All the films are in 1080i. If you have a good player or de-interlacer on your TV, things will look great. If you don't, not so much. The films are on the low-end for bitrate and do have some compression artifacts. I'm just glad to have these films available and the price can't be beat.

The films in the volume 2 collection aren't as good as the volume 1 collection, but are still better than some of the 90's and 2000's Godzilla films.",1404950400,5,438,4.27710843373494
6245604,3,B00I099JY6,Gamera: Ultimate Collection V2 reminded me of watching an Ultraman show.  It is very kids oriented and often silly.,1404691200,,115,5.052631578947368

6245606,4,B00I099JY6,"Great collection of movies. The last movie is rather silly and uses a lot of stock footage from previous movies, but still great for the kaiju fan. There is no English dubs, just the subs, so take that into consideration before you buy as some of these can be found with English dubs. However, these are the better prints and worth adding to your collection.",1404000000,5,358,4.523076923076923
8637928,4,B00I099JY6,"I had to knock a star off for Super Monster. It's bad, so terribly bad. A slapped together plot that revolves around stock footage of Gamera from all of the other Showa era Gamera films. They even used stock footage from some anime in it, it's really bizarre. Also, the big ""terrifying"" space ship looks like a knockoff of a Star Destroyer from Star Wars, it even flies ""over"" the camera in a knockoff of the opening of Star Wars. It's no surprise this movie didn't stop the studio from going bankrupt and put Gamera on a 15 year hiatus.

The rest of the set is pure gold. Like the first set, it's 4 movies on a single Blu-Ray, very handy for binge watching. Picture quality is good, sound quality is good, there are a few typos here and there in the subtitles, but it's not too bad. The movies themselves are all cheesy and the first three are lots of fun. All told, this is another great collection and a must own for Kaiju film fans.",1529452800,,936,4.288135593220339

8637932,4,B00I099JY6,"This is a nice set. You get four movies on one Blu-ray disc. The picture quality is a bit above DVD quality. There is no English dub on these sets, only English subtitles with Japanese audio. The picture is very bright. I read that in Japan, they master their movies with brightness on zero. The US, standard is at 50. Move your brightness down to zero and you will see the colors more vivid and detail not as washed out. The movies are fun and kid friendly (aside from the monster blood). Great fun and a fantastic nostalgia trip!",1517616000,,531,4.373737373737374
