8495836,3,B006ATEYP2,"The Chilly Willy-Red Dogg match was boring to say the least. The EZ Money & Julio Dinero-Nova & Chris Chetti-tag team match was good with nice moves from Money to boot. The Little Guido & Tony Mamaluke-Mikey Whipwreck & Tajiri-tag team match had plenty of good action from both team. Translation: it was a good tag bout. The Danny Doring, Roadkill, & Tommy Dreamer-Simon Diamond, Johnny Swinger & CW Anderson-6 man tag team match was  a decent brawl, but nothing spectacular. The World title match between Justin Credible & Kid Kash was disappointing to say the least. The Tony DeVito & Spanish Angel-Christian York & Joey Matthews-tag team match was bad all the way around this side of WCW. The TV title match between Rhino & Jerry Lynn was a fine bout and did a great putting Rhino over. The Steve Corino-Rob Van Dam was so-so with a pretty good finish to save it. I give this DVD a 6 out of 10.",1423440000,,897,4.5030674846625764
