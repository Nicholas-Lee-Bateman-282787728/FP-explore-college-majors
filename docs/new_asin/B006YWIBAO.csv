5037577,4,B006YWIBAO,"Although I loved this movie, it was almost like someone just thought of a bunch of one liners and wrote a script around it. The casting was a little odd for me, seeing Paulo Costanzo in a role that required him to be the straight-laced one. However, putting J.K. Simmons in it makes everything wrong with the movie somehow become right.",1352851200,,336,4.524590163934426

5037579,1,B006YWIBAO,"Seen thirty times told before movie stereotypes of loser dad with lots of former wives (by various stereotyped marriages - hooker, Asian, etc.); gambles; self-centered to the point of making money off of his kids by enrolling them in, a supposedly for profit, drug testing program. Dad commits suicide (off screen) and so we follow his stereotypic kids, starting with the funeral, and as mostly adults with a variety of stereotypic dysfunctional personality quirks - selfish; non-commital; anal; not-so-bright; angry. All given unbelievable, over the top, characterizations. The usual boring traits you can look inside or across the street and see. As predicted everyone gets their individual acts together and everyone lives happily ever after. It was suppose to have some comical elements but they were all barely little snicker-laughs; about the same substance level as watered down non-fat milk.",1346630400,2,899,5.428571428571429
5037580,4,B006YWIBAO,"""The events leading up to my death were a lot like the rest of my life, things didn't go exactly as planned."" Duke White (Keitel) is dead and his three sons are at the will reading. After hearing what they will get they also get another surprise, due to gambling problems their father signed them up for unsafe drug tests when they were babies and because of that they all find out they will die soon. All three sons handle the news differently but eventually they all take one last run at the one thing they have always wanted to do. Based off the preview this is a movie I was looking forward to. I really like these dark comedies and the cast was pretty good. I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie and laughed throughout, but this is another movie where I laughed at things I shouldn't be laughing at. The idea on it's own is pretty morbid but watching it it comes off as more comedy then depressing. There are some really funny lines in this and the running gag about Cal's (Caan) car is great and I loved hearing what they would say about it next. This is a very funny comedy but is not for everyone. Overall, really funny but this is a dark comedy so you must like that style of humor to fully enjoy this movie. I give it a B+",1346544000,,1241,4.175

8506643,5,B006YWIBAO,"Maybe I'm just easy to please but I loved this movie. essentially, we have a dad who sires 5 sons with 3 different women. He is a really bad dad, really bad. Well, the only thing for him to do is kill himself which brings the 5 sons together for the funeral and some really interesting  literature in the way of the will. Keep in mind that this is a very dark comedy, some good laughs and some you may also cringe when you hear them. All 5 of the sons are terrific, Harvey is terrific...so is big Mitch....you'll see. So many quirky characters to be found....loved each and every one.",1441411200,,584,4.261261261261262

8506645,4,B006YWIBAO,"A Beginner's Guide to Endings is a decent comedy that could've been better honestly.  The concept begins with a father (played by the talented Harvey Keitel) on the verge of committing suicide.  Every time he tries to kill himself something goes wrong and his life is saved much to his displeasure.  At his supposed funeral it's revealed that his sons are all going to die due to them unaware that they've taken deadly drugs courtesy of the father.  The entire segment in the beginning where the father explains his whole life story, and the story of his 3 sons, is *easily* the best part of the movie since the detail here is staggering.  It's extremely well-told with pictures to follow along which enhances the enjoyability of it.

However when the story actually gets underway right after the funeral, it sort of collapses in being unremarkable for the most part but occasionally rebounds with a few really funny spots such as the one brother (played by Scott Caan who totally reminds me of WWE wrestler Dolph Ziggler by the way) finding himself getting into a fight with a big man sporting a hunk of wood with nails in it, and later when said brother and man find themselves handcuffed to the railroad tracks.  It's the kind of over the top entertainment I expected given the intro.  The entire movie should have been more like this scene in my opinion.

The other two brothers have their own misadventures to contend with.  And speaking of contention, another brother spends his day preparing for a boxing match (the racist tights he was wearing towards the blacks in Detroit was a funny moment) and the other brother made a list of things he wants to do before he dies, which includes hanging out with a Vietnamese kid (the funniest character in the movie without question) and either going through with outrageous stunts such as jumping into a tube and going into the Niagara Falls, knocking on someone's door and punching their lights out or more gentle subjects such as meeting and talking with a smiling girl he finds attractive.

Scott Caan's character is probably the most memorable of the brothers because of his insistence on dating bad girls.  Tricia Helfer becomes the main character since she's the object of his affection more than the others.  The movie concludes on a wonderful note too- I won't spoil it, but all the events of the 3 brothers come together in a most unusual way by the end.

Overall A Beginner's Guide to Endings has its moments, but expect the wackiness in the beginning to calm down considerably to allow the storyline to develop, and some of the development centers around romantic comedy-like nonsense that doesn't appeal to me whatsoever which is why my 4 stars is reluctantly so.",1420761600,,2723,4.753715498938429

8506647,5,B006YWIBAO,"This is one of my favorite Scott Caan movies! It is funny and actually puts out an amazing message about family and luck (it just does it in a crazy, ingenious way). I would definitely recommend this movie. It doesn't cost too much and it is worth the watch.",1405555200,,258,4.285714285714286
8506648,4,B006YWIBAO,"When the opening scene makes me smile, I know that I'm in for a treat.  This movie is unique and fun.  Warning - must have tolerance (and perhaps enjoy) for the absurd and some ribald humor.  I loved the cast of characters and the blend of actors' personalities really added to the comedic effect.  Great writing.  Really enjoyed this indie film.",1404000000,,346,4.60655737704918
8506649,2,B006YWIBAO,"I have an honestly tough time explaining why this movie didn't do more for me. All the pieces are there, from good performances(which you expect from Harvey Kietel or JK Simmons: less so from the often one note comic stylings of Jason Jones, who nails his part) to a quirky storyline, some sharp writing, some interesting twists.
All the same, there is a definite lack of edge here, a final connection that just isn't made with the audience. This is a collection of interesting characters, with interesting character traits, but I never found myself to really care all that much. It was a bit like being a passenger on a section of the interstate you've never been to, catching your eye but not really upsetting you as you pass by.",1391904000,,731,4.630769230769231
