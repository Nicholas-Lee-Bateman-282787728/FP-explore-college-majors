4185740,5,B003RLLSWI,"Alton Brown is the king of science-oriented humorous food preparation and also a pun master, as his episode titles frequently demonstrate. ""Pantry Raids"" is one of the best of the best ""Good Eats"" DVDs as it deals with staples we all eat and different ways to prepare them. The episodes, ""Use Your Noodle"", ""Cool Beans"", and ""Comb Alone"" are all intensely fascinating, and I found the noodle and bean preparations especially useful. ""Comb Alone"" details the production, history, and uses for bee vomit...I mean, honey...and even though it did not make me into a true honey fan (I never have been), I found it to be one of the most genuinely interesting of all ""Good Eats"" episodes.

The DVD comes with ""Ask Alton"" segments for every show, and if you didn't learn enough in the episodes themselves, be prepared to cram more interesting knowledge into your brain while watching these great bonus segments. The DVD also comes with a mini-recipe booklet detailing the preparation of the key dishes from each episode.

""Pantry Raids"" is a great DVD for Alton Brown fans or fans of cooking techniques in general, and I highly recommend it.",1436659200,,1133,4.865284974093265

4185742,5,B003RLLSWI,"""Good Eats"" presents ""All American Greats,"" which includes the stellar episodes ""A Grind is a Terrible Thing to Waste,"" ""Ear Apparent,"" and ""American Pickle."" Starting with burgers and Alton's special meatloaf, the DVD really gets down to work dealing with corn and pickles of all different varieties. The enclosed mini recipe book is most welcome as it contains the principal dishes in these episodes: to be sure my favorite of the bunch is ""Creamed Corn Cornbread."" Nobody can do educational culinary humor like Alton Brown, and these episodes present some of America's quintessential foods. I highly recommend this set to any ""Good Eats"" fan, cooks, scientists, and people with suitably eccentric senses of humor everywhere.",1420329600,5,727,5.3304347826086955
4185743,5,B003RLLSWI,"In this compilation, ""Loafing Around,"" Alton Brown takes on bread and sandwich craft as only he could. There are three episodes featured here, and the DVD comes with a small recipe book of the significant items covered in these episodes (""Sandwich Craft,"" ""My Big Fat Greet Sandwich,"" and ""Dr. Strangeloaf."") I particularly recommend his take on the Cuban sandwich and if you are interested in baking bread his ""Very Basic Bread"" recipe. While I like gyros, I haven't succumbed personally to the temptation to make his ""Gyro Meat with Tzatziki Sauce,"" though I thought the episode it came from was one of the most entertaining and informative. I like the bonus ""Ask Alton"" question and answer sessions on the DVD and genuinely find ""Good Eats"" to be the most educational cooking show I have ever seen. If you like to cook, if you like science, or if you just have a quirky sense of humor, you can't go wrong with any ""Good Eats"" collection.",1420329600,2,940,4.737804878048781
4185744,5,B003RLLSWI,"I am a big Alton Brown fan and have his first three seasons on DVD.  I bought this because every time I want a refresher on omelets or frittatas I didn't want to dig around for the episode.  I go back to 'Zen and the Art of Omelet Maintenance' every now and then.  This DVD comes with three great breakfast episodes.  The Scrap Iron Chef episode is about making your own bacon, which, while not useful to me is informative.  The Zen episode is my favorite episode after the one on brining a turkey.  I could see myself making muffins AND English muffins.

One nice surprise is that after each episode he answers questions people have sent in about the episode.  Some were questions that popped into my mind while watching.

Alton Brown educates and entertains.  A good DVD to own.",1353110400,3,780,4.468085106382978
8403816,5,B003RLLSWI,Great find and plays properly (thats always a worry with a used DVD). Im so happy to be able to watch Good Eats again!,1513382400,,118,3.9583333333333335

8403818,5,B003RLLSWI,"As a longtime Alton Brown and ""Good Eats"" fan, I always learn a lot from these shows, and this set in particular is a gem. Each of the three episodes concerns a different traditionally breakfast dish. ""Scrap Iron Chef"" was maybe the most educational but esoteric as most people won't make their own bacon (I eat bacon only very rarely). The lessons on brining it contains, though, go far beyond bacon in the kitchen, though, and I really enjoyed this episode. ""Zen and the Art of Omelet Maintenance"" is the most useful of the three in my opinion as it covers omelets and frittatas, which are not terribly hard to make but are challenging to make well. ""The Muffin Man"" is about muffins, and emphasizes both blueberry muffins and English muffins. I have made muffins from scratch, but I think Alton does it better and think his blueberry muffin recipe is excellent.

The DVD contains a recipe booklet with the key recipes from all three episodes: my favorites of the bunch are the blueberry muffin and frittata recipes. This is a great set, and anyone who likes cooking will benefit from Alton's quirky teaching techniques.",1473552000,2,1122,4.753846153846154
8403819,5,B003RLLSWI,"As a dedicated Alton Brown and Good Eats fan, I can honestly say there has never been an episode I didn't enjoy, but these three shows for carnivores are particularly insightful. My favorite of the bunch is ""Raising the Steaks"" which deals with beef preparation. Although I no longer eat much beef, the recipes for skirt steak and sirloin steak are extremely tempting. ""Q"" is all about pulled pork, and I do love everything about barbeque: this episode is probably the most educational of the three, as it covers topics such as brining Boston butt to perfection. The enclosed recipe booklet is especially helpful if you want to prepare these on your own (watch the episode first). Finally ""The Man Food Show"" highlights ""Mini Man Burgers"" and corn dogs. The corn dog recipe is the most challenging of the bunch to do correctly, and honestly I don't like corn dogs enough to put the effort into it.

Regardless of your desire to make any of these recipes, these are three very educational episodes of Good Eats, and I recommend this set highly!",1473465600,,1043,4.730769230769231
8403820,5,B003RLLSWI,"In the ""Good Eats"" DVD collection with perhaps the most groanworthy title of them all, ""Pantastic Eats"" still delivers the culinary goods. Included here are the classic episodes ""Cuckoo For Coq au Vin"", ""The Pouch Principle"", and ""The Big Chili"". I am an admittedly huge Alton Brown fan, and do find the mix of science, history, and humor he uses to teach about cooking to be perfect for my learning style. While I enjoyed ""Cuckoo For Coq au Vin"", it's honestly not my favorite way of preparing chicken, but ""The Pouch Principle"" is one of the most practical and useful episodes in the series (especially recommended is ""Salmon Filet en Papillote with Julienned Vegetable""). Last but not least is ""The Big Chili"" which as a dedicated chili lover is my favorite of the three episodes (""Pressure Cooker Chili"" is highly endorsed). The DVD comes with ""Ask Alton"" bonus segments addressing viewer questions about the episodes and a recipe booklet of the key entries from each episode.

""Pantastic Eats"" is a great ""Good Eats"" compilation and I recommend it to budding kitchen scientists anywhere.",1452211200,,1092,4.967213114754099
8403821,5,B003RLLSWI,"As a longtime ""Good Eats"" fan, I find the preparation methodology and the logic that Alton Brown uses to make great food one of the most interesting aspects of the series. I will be the first to admit that ""Ocean Edibles"" is not my favorite ""Good Eats"" DVD set as I am not a shellfish lover; I dislike mussels and can only marginally tolerate clams. I do like many types of fish, particularly salmon and bass, and for that reason, of these three episodes I found ""Mission: Poachable"" most useful (and I particularly loved the ridiculous comic premise behind it). Poaching is a useful skill and this episode is brilliantly done and illustrated with a slew of diverse dishes (including eggs and catfish). ""Mussel Bound"" and ""Send in the Clams"" are also interesting because the science and logic of preparation displayed is fascinating and entertaining even though I won't be making any of the dishes depicted.

If you like seafood and science this is the DVD set for you!",1443139200,2,969,4.733727810650888
8403822,5,B003RLLSWI,"""Good Eats"" is always educational and fun, and while I love every episode, this collection is special as it largely deals with how to use spices. Spicing food is one of the most essential skills on the road to becoming a good cook, with learning to use salt the biggest key there is to tasty fare. The first two episodes presented here are ""Chile's Angels"" and ""Spice Capades"" and several sample recipes are demonstrated using a variety of spices (at a variety of heat levels). Particularly recommended are the preparations for ""Broiled Salmon with AB's Spice Pomade"" and ""Vegetable Curry"".

The third episode in this collection is the most essential: ""Eat This Rock!"" discusses salt, from mining, to evaporation, to crystalline structure and chemistry, Alton discusses this most necessary of all spices in great detail in a one hour special which is profusely illustrated with relevant recipes. Though I personally would never go through the effort to make sauerkraut, I would highly recommend ""Beef Tenderloin in Salt Crust"". This isn't the easiest way to prepare beef, but it is an extremely useful application that gets fabulous results.

""Condiment Nation"" is one of the very best ""Good Eats"" collections and I highly recommend it.",1440720000,2,1236,5.083743842364532
8403823,5,B003RLLSWI,"""Flour Power"" is one of the very best ""Good Eats"" DVDs. Wheat flour is so ubiquitous in western cooking that mastering it goes a long way to ensuring culinary success. My Mom taught me how to bake from a young age (though I'll never rival her or Alton) and I have an appreciation for some of the more subtle techniques involved, though what I found from watching this DVD is that I rarely understood why certain techniques are applicable in certain situations but not others.

The three episodes are ""The Dough Also Rises"", ""Puff the Magic Pastry"", and ""Choux Shine"". Of the three, the one with the most important lessons is ""The Dough Also Rises"" which discusses scones, shortcakes, and most vitally, biscuits. I was happy to see Alton's actual grandmother, Ma Mae, competing with him in a biscuit making contest and found both approaches to their craft insightful. Good biscuits are a challenge to make well, and learning to make them leads to many other possibilities (including scones and shortcake). The discussion of flours here is superb, and it is an episode worth watching and re-watching. There's also a helpful mini recipe booklet included with the DVD to help you on your quest, covering all the key recipes from all three shows on the DVD.

The other two shows are also excellent though somewhat more specialized. ""Puff the Magic Pastry"" deals with turnovers (including the somewhat...unique...salmon turnover...no, thanks), tarts, and other uses of puff pastry dough, which is notoriously difficult to work with. ""Choux Shine"" details making funnel cakes and pte  choux, which are frankly not favorites of mine and are never worth the time expended; still understanding what makes them work is interesting, entertaining, and potentially handy for any baker.

""Flour Power"" is a great DVD from Alton Brown and I recommend it highly.",1439683200,2,1845,5.019607843137255
8403824,5,B003RLLSWI,"As a longtime ""Good Eats"" fan, I obviously appreciate Alton Brown's quirky science with bad puns in the greatest cooking show of all time, and I learn more from Brown than I have from anyone else (OK, except my Mom...) or any  cooking book I have read. I particularly like it when he takes fairly ordinary ingredients we often take for granted and turns them on their head, and there's plenty of that here.

This DVD includes the episodes ""Melon Drama"", ""Cobbled Together"", and the hour-long special from Hawaii, ""Down and Out in Paradise"". I admit that I don't love most melons, particularly watermelon, but with ""Melon Drama"" Brown has got me thinking about them in a different way, and I'm ready to give them another shot, starting with his recipe for ""Melon Sorbet"", though I'm fairly certain I do not want to try ""Hot Melon Salad"" (and certainly don't want to go through the preparation involved). Both recipes are included in the handy mini recipe booklet enclosed with the DVD, as are the key recipes from the other episodes as well.

By far my favorite episode was ""Cobbled Together"" because I haven't ever met a cobbler that I don't like. Here he makes ""Rhubarb Peach Cobbler"" (with a special guest appearance by an overly jocular Grim Reaper!), ""Individual Berry Crisps"" (yum), and my favorite (and favorite named) dish of the DVD, ""Blackberry Grunt"". Believe me it's far more appetizing than the name might lead you to believe! ""Down and Out in Paradise"" sees Alton scavenging for survival in a tropical environment in one of three hour-long ""Good Eats"" specials. The dishes he prepares are all over the map, from ""Island Ceviche With Pickled Onions"" (no, thanks!) to ""Chocolate Coconut Balls"" (yes, please!) The cooking methods are somewhat...unorthodox, even for Brown, but it's a lot of fun and extremely educational, particularly from a nutritional geography (if that's a real thing) standpoint.

""The Ripe Stuff"" is truly one of the great ""Good Eats"" DVDs: it's funny, it's offbeat, it's educational, and it's delicious!",1439251200,,2036,4.944444444444445
8403825,5,B003RLLSWI,"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and this, the inaugural outing of ""Breakfast Eats"" collections from Alton Brown's ""Good Eats"" Alton presents ""True Brew I"", ""The Egg Files I"", and ""Flap Jack Do It Again"". ""True Brew I"" is all about coffee; the truth is that Alton is extremely knowledgeable about coffee, but while I drink it I'm honestly not that picky, so perhaps my palate is too unrefined for the full effect of the show to work its magic on me. I can definitely say that I appreciate his enthusiasm and enjoyed the episode, but coffee isn't important enough to me to go through the effort he goes through here. ""The Egg Files I"" explains how to make perfect Eggs Over Easy (watch for the exploding egg scene and listen for the crew's off-camera laughter) and Scrambled Eggs (I still prefer mine a bit more done than Brown does), but the real gem of this episode is his dynamite recipe for Lemon Curd. Talk about versatile and delicious. ""Flap Jack Do It Again"" (great title, by the way) is all about pancakes and I definitely found it to be the most interesting and useful of the three episodes.

The DVD includes a mini recipe book of the key recipes (and an extensive discussion about coffee) and is extremely useful; as always watching the episodes first helps tackle the recipes later. This is another first class ""Good Eats"" DVD and I recommend it to breakfast lovers everywhere.",1437091200,2,1405,4.62
