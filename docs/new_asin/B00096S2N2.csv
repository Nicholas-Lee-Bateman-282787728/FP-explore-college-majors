8057470,5,B00096S2N2,"VCI offers a nicely restored version of the Johnny Mack Brown serial FIGHTING WITH KIT CARSON and this is the one to get, period.
As for the serial itself, it's a good one. A shipment of government gold is hidden by Matt Fargo when attacked by Indians and Mystery Riders. Kit Carson is accused of treachery and must prove himself and uncover the real culprit, outlaw chief and scene stealing Noah Berry as trader Noah Kraft. Berry's son, Noah Jr. plays Carson's Indian sidekick and child trick rider Betsy King Ross is Joan Fargo,  Matt's daughter, though he appears about 70 and she 10 , who for some reason disguises herself as a boy named Johnny and although everyone knows she's a girl they all refer to her as a boy. This is the most confusing part of the plot, even more so than where the gold is hidden.
We get lots of hard riding and pitch battles between Kit's band, the Mystery Riders, who sing as they ride, the Indians, the cavalry, the pioneers/settlers and the regular outlaws. This is all fast-paced and fun, reminding us what a thrilling afternoon one could have at a 1930's movie theater!
Johnny Mack Brown is a likeable hero and Betsy King Ross isn't obnoxious as the little boy/girl. But, as usual, the real treat always comes with the badguys. Noah Sr. is just great chewing scenery and spittin' it out as if he were in a Shakespearian play! And Al Bridge (Reynolds) and Maston Williams (Chuck) are in top form as the two top slimeball heavies. Lane Chandler, Tom Tully, Lafe McKee and lots of familiar faces abound.
Needless to say, Kit is cleared of all charges, the gold is recovered and the Mystery Riders sing their last song. A great way to spend an afternoon, riding along in all that wonderful ""shot on location"" scenery featured in VCI's crisp, clear print!",1318377600,3,1786,4.58125

CARSON trivia:

Lane Chandler was a silent screen star who slipped into supporting roles in 'B' movies from the early 1930s on.

In his 35-year career (beginning in 1914), Slim Whitaker appeared in over 340 westerns. He has a small role here.

William Witney (several minor characters) was CARSON director Colbert Clark's brother-in-law. In 1937, Witney began his second (and principal) career as a director of western serials, movies and TV shows.

Stuntman-extraordinaire Yakima Canutt starred in a few silent-era westerns. He was also at times an assistant director, production coordinator, writer and stunt coordinator on dozens of great films. Here, Canutt is one of the Mystery Riders.

Iron Eyes Cody specialized in playing Native Americans, yet he was the son of Italian immigrant parents. Cody denied this even in court in 1996, when his heritage was challenged. Cody's most famous role was his briefest: he was the Indian who sheds a tear for a blighted American environment in ""Keep America Beautiful"" ads that ran from 1971 into the 1980s.

8057473,3,B00096S2N2,"This is a Mascot serial in 12 episodes, best seen a chapter at a time like when it was released.  Johnny Mack Brown is the hero, Kit Carson.  The storyline doesn't claim any historical accuracy at all, but you don't expect historical accuracy in a serial.  It's good.  The raw action isn't as continuous as it is in the later WILD WEST DAYS.  However, you have Noah Beery as the chief bad guy.  You don't want to be around that rascal when he ""accidentally"" drops his knife.
One weird thing here:  when the bad guys move one victim's dead body, you have a series of dotted lines indicating their route.  Strange!  I never saw that in a serial or B movie before.
This is pretty typical B western, but it moves, and should entertain western fans, and those serial fans who enjoy westerns.",1027900800,6,786,4.440559440559441
