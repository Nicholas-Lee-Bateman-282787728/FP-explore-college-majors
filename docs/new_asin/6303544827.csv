677657,5,6303544827,"Classic Brady!  Do you know any girl who, not only got a rock star to play at her prom, but got a date out of him? Only Marcia could pull this off!  I remember when it originally aired in the 70's and had dreams of meeting the  infamous Monkee (OK, I was 6 years old and hadn't discovered ""Tiger  Beat"" yet).  The clothes and hairdews alone make the episode (check  out Davey's dorky mananger and Marcia's groovy poncho).  On a footnote: did  actually meet Davey 15 years later during a Monkees Reunion, a  disappointment.  Better on tape, than in person.",957916800,2,555,4.46

7849825,5,6303544827,"We are not talking lofty standards here when we recognize the fact that this particular set of episodes from ""The Brady Bunch"" contains two of the show's signature episodes from the perspective of American pop culture.  The common denominator here is the oldest female Brady, Marcia (Maureen McCormick), in what are clearly her two most famous misadventures.  ""Getting Davy Jones"" (Episode #61, December 10, 1971) has Marcia promising to get teenage hearthrob Davy Jones of the Monkees to sing at her school prom.  Unfortunately, this appearance is news to Davy.  Good thing this is a television comedy otherwise this would end badly for Marcia.  Marcia, Marcia, Marcia gets her comeuppance in ""The Subject Was Noses"" (Episode #90, February 9, 1973), when she gets hit in the nose with a football.  The nose swells up like a balloon and because of the disfigurement Marcia's boyfriend Doug Simpson (Nicholas Hammond) ditches her.  Obviously no great loss, but it sure bothers little miss vanity.  For fan's of neglected sister Jan this has to be the most popular episode of ""The Brady Bunch"" ever.  You do not have to like these episodes let alone ""The Brady Bunch,"" but you do have to at least know about them as touchstones of pop culture.  P.S.  Pay attention to the guest stars besides Davy Jones on these episodes and their importance in television history.  The first one has Marcia Wallace, who went on to success on ""The Bob Newhart Show"" as receptionist Carol Kester and who know provides the voice for Bart's teacher Edna Krabappel on ""The Simpsons.""  Nicholas Hammond from the other episode ended up as television's ""Spider-Man"" after being one of the Von Trapp children in ""The Sound of Music.""",1049587200,3,1706,4.943859649122807

David would feel terrible that he hurt your feelings.  I've gotten to know him in the last few years, and he is sweet, charming, kind and considerate.  Whatever happened at the concert you attended, he had his reasons for his behavior.  He's not perfect - but then neither are ANY of us!! Please don't defile his character.  He gets enough S**t from fair-weather fans who don't ""know"" him .  He's a very special guy!! Give it another try - things will work out better next time!! Believe me, it's worth the effort!!",1002672000,3,681,4.392
7849827,4,6303544827,"I liked this one because we see Marsha trying to get Davy Jones to play at the prom. After bombing out with her manager... Davy brings out his latest LP to the brady house. Believe me-- the guy is better on tape then in person.. I went and saw the Monkees in concert on March 22, 2001. I got to meet Micky and Peter.
Davy had a fight with a mamber of security and decided NOT to come out. The guy litterly blew off 30 or more fans all because of a little fight... I watch the episode to think of what might have been for me... Other then that, it is the best one of the entire series....",989107200,2,587,3.9411764705882355
7849828,3,6303544827,Why buy Brady Bunch episodes? They'll be played forever on Nick-at-Nite. SO just hit your 'rec' button. I never liked the early shows. I only like the later ones when Marcia grew her boobies.,979776000,3,191,4.647058823529412
7849829,5,6303544827,"If you absolutely have a soft spot for that little hunny off of the Monkees, u HAVE to see this movie.  The thing I liked most about it is that it came out just one year after the Monkees broke up, and Davy looks  exactly the same as he did in the television show.  Don't worry, whether  you're a Monkee fan or not, this movie will not leave you in  dissapointment.  :-)",963619200,6,370,4.069444444444445
7849830,5,6303544827,"This video contains the episodes ""Getting Davy Jones"" and ""The Subject Was Noses"".  These are probably the two most famous Brady episodes.  In the first one, Marcia's friends think that she got Davy  Jones to play at her juniour high prom.  Little do they know that Marcia  doesn't even know Davy Jones.  Fortunately, Davy happens to be in town, and  Marcia has to get him to play at the prom.  In the second episode, Marcia  breaks a date in order to date the school football star.  However, Marcia's  nose gets swollen when Peter accidently hits her with a football.  How  ironic.  Now the football player won't be seen with Marcia, who now has no  date.  Another classic episode with a great moral.
This is another great  addition to any video library.  A great video for not only Brady Bunch  fans, but fans of The Monkees!",963446400,8,827,4.5793103448275865
7849831,5,6303544827,By far the most groovy 70s show and by far its best episode the kiddies and the oldies will both like. Way better than the Desi Arnez Jr. episode.,961545600,2,146,4.068965517241379
