8088472,5,B000BKVROW,"An excellent and often very beautiful film. Dark, yes, since dealing with dark times, but brooding with much intelligence on sundry forms of betrayal and visually framed in wonderfully apt and striking images that suggest the bitter imprisonment and the lost graces of Germans during Hitler's rise in the 30s. The brooding, bleak eyes of several characters, often lingered on, are unforgettable, as are many of the settings.  Hard not to feel a sort of indirect endangerment, even - oddly - guilt while watching the inevitable disaster unfold. And yet the film is rather understated. Fine work.",1305072000,,594,5.123711340206185
8088473,1,B000BKVROW,"Uwe Kocksich (Der Tunnel) gives a decent performance in this otherwise dismal film.  Apparently film production values in the DDR circa 1980 were quite low if the Unknown Brother is an example.  A grainy film print coupled with a laughable Musak ""classical"" soundtrack only added to a pointedly dull affair.  I could only recommend this disc to a person seeking German language films of any quality.  Fortunately this search is better satisfied by the hundreds of fine German movies available at Amazon or elsewhere.",1155168000,2,516,5.107142857142857
