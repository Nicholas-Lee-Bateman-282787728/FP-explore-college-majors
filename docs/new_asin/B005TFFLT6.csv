8486149,5,B005TFFLT6,A terrific movie for ice-hockey fans. I(n this instance understanding the language is a big plus. The action is well photographed..the players  engaging...and the pace of the movie moves along at just the right rate of speed.,1366588800,,225,5.081081081081081
8486150,4,B005TFFLT6,I thought this movie was in English all the u tube show English. It a little unnerving to see Rob Lowe speak Hindi.,1335916800,,115,4.043478260869565
