4397329,5,B004KO2EUG,"Man, I must say, this concert makes me feel I'm right there on first row. Great concert, great set list, awesome sound and video. This a complete Blu Ray that it comes with several interviews and promo videos of their latest album. Make no mistake, get this Blu Ray, buy some beers and play it in your living room (I hope you have a descent speaker system). I have to play this when my wife is not there in the house, because i like to crank the volume up and sing out loud. Highly recommended!",1332720000,2,494,4.2105263157894735
4397330,1,B004KO2EUG,"Hi guyes i was very disappointed i put the disc in, and  sat in my favorite chair
lots of italian words that lasted 30 seconds then not a bloody thing so i was so up set ,i can not blame the player if i new it was a code 0 i would not have bought.it
as it said all regions and ntsc so what else do you look for buying from the local

4397331,2,B004KO2EUG,"Kelly Hansen does an awesome job covering the Foreigner classics, BUT this is another one of those concert DVD's where they use a multitude of cameras, to me there is such a thing as too many ya know, they change from one to another every 2 seconds, thats not a misprint, every 2 seconds, so much that it actually made me dizzy trying to watch it, I'd prefer to see Mick play a solo all the way thru rather than a couple seconds of Mick, then cut to the drummer for 2 seconds, then cut to Kelly for a couple seconds, then the bassist for a couple seconds, then the keyboard player, then another angle, and another angle, and so on, I wish they wouldn't keep doing this, but it has become the norm, I would have loved to have kept this DVD in my collection of music DVD's but unfortunately I was barely able to watch it once.",1320192000,13,824,4.188679245283019
4397332,5,B004KO2EUG,"This is a great Blu-Ray of the latest incantaion of Foreigner.  While it only has one original band member, the vocals are remarkably close to Lou Gramm.  The video is great (some concert video is DVD only, no bluray) and the audio mix is the best that I have heard.  The audience is the most uninvolved that I have seen at a rock concert, but that doesn't reflect on the band or its sounds, which is fantastic.  If you want a modern BluRay of Foreigner playing their hits and sounding as great as they are going to sound with Gramm, this is the disc to buy.",1318291200,4,558,4.235849056603773

4397334,5,B004KO2EUG,"I was psyched to receive and view this BluRay..unfortunately, it would NOT play in my BluRay player. Amazon was FANTASTIC in sending me a replacement (which ALSO did not work) and then promptly issued me a refund.

Great CUSTOMER SERVICE",1313193600,5,237,4.925
4397335,5,B004KO2EUG,"This blu-ray is an import from the United Kingdom.  I purchased it from Amazon, here in the U.S.  Some people mentioned problems playing the blu-ray on their players, but the blu-ray disc plays on my two U.S. Panasonic blu-ray players.

I listened and watched a few of the hits, including the megahit ""I Want To Know What Love Is,"" and I have to point out that Kelly Hansen, the vocalist, is amazing.  His voice sounds great and is very clear.  He is quite animated and interacts with the audience.

This concert was filmed live at the Ryman Auditorium, located in Nashville, Tennessee.

The two audio choices are DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.",1313107200,23,666,4.689655172413793
4397336,5,B004KO2EUG,"Mine just arrived today from Amazon.co.uk....its an ALL REGION Blu ray and easily played in my Sony player...

the concert filmed in HD is 1hour 45 minutes and the tracks are
Double Vision
Head Games
Cold As Ice
In Pieces
Blue Morning, Blue Day
Waiting For A Girl Like You
When It Comes To love
Dirty White Boy
Starrider
Feels Like The First Time
Urgent
Solos
Juke Box Hero

then bonus tracks from Sound Stage (also HD)
Night Life
Say You Will
Too Late
Urgent

Then three recent music videos
When It Comes To Love
Can't Slow Down
Too Late

and a couple of long interviews with Mick Jones and Kelly

so...this is a very good value, much better than the hard to find Sound Stage BLu Ray which only has part of that show.

The energy level of the show is very good, the filming great...I have no complaints and highly recommend to any Foreigner fans...
Do I miss Lou Gramm? Of Course...but rather than complain about that I enjoy what Kelly brings...",1305936000,41,1012,4.3563829787234045

4397338,5,B004KO2EUG,"I have not seen the DVD yet!  I was there at the Ryman and the concert was magnificent!  I have watched the HDNet concert over and over.  Same taping except the DVD includes ""Long, Long Way From Home,"" ""Blue Morning, Blue Day"" and Michael Bluestein (keys) and Brian Tichy's (drums)solos!!! (This is according to our German friends who have their DVDs).
This is Foreigner at their finest!  I am a huge fan and have gone to their concerts all over the country. Foreigner is one of the absolute best bands live!  The setlist is a mix of old and new; the mega hits and a few lesser known fan favorites! ""Hot Blooded,"" ""Cold as Ice,"" ""Waiting for a Girl Like You,"" ""I Want to Know What Love Is,"" ""Juke Box Hero, Double Vision,"" ""Head Games"" are all there and resonate through the lovely Ryman Theatre!!!  Two new songs: ""When It Comes to Love"" and ""In Pieces"" are also beautifully performed! The ethereal ""Starrider"" sounds absoutely gorgeous!  The band is high energy, the staging and set are very colorful.  The filming is perfect! Close ups and shots of the theatre!  Audio and video quality are stellar!  Add this to your collection -- you will watch it over and over!!!  (Apparently there are two bonus tracks:  ""Nightlife and ""Too Late"" from Soundstage and some interviews with the band!!)  Mick, Kelly, Tom, Jeff, Michael, Brian and staff -- great job!!!!!!!!",1302393600,8,1361,4.69198312236287

The sound quality is excellent. It is 501 surround sound.  The video quality is also very good.  This is now his favorite dvd so I get to listen to it at least once a week.  To be honest, I enjoy it too.",1454457600,,470,3.7938144329896906

4397353,5,B004KO2EUG,"If you are an old school Foreigner purist and simply must have Lou Gramm front and center when you watch Foreigner, this is not the DVD for you, but if you are open-minded to the talents of Kelly Hansen, who is in fine vocal form here along with original guitarist and songwriter Mick Jones, ""Rockin' at the Ryman"" is a good choice. The set list covers the big hits and some new stuff as well, and the audio and video quality is excellent, although I would have preferred less cuts in the camera angles from an editing perspective (Come on...let me watch Mick finish just one solo!)

The performance at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville opens with ""Double Vision"" and closes with ""Hot Blooded"", but for my money the showstopper here is ""Juke Box Hero"". The DVD also features three videos, some PBS concert footage (four songs including ""Urgent""), and an interview with Mick Jones and Kelly Hansen which was more understated and introspective than I expected.

If you are a Foreigner fan, ""Rockin' at the Ryman"" is a very good DVD of the latest iteration of the classic rock band.",1443139200,5,1079,4.643979057591623

4397369,5,B004KO2EUG,"I initially became interested in acquiring this DVD after purchasing the CD titled Foreigner- Extended Versions from Wal Mart for $5.  The CD was awesome and after learning this CD was from the same concert as this DVD I knew I needed to have it.  Of interesting note, on the CD during the song Juke Box Hero the band breaks into a riff of Led Zepplins Whole Lotta Love.  This is mysteriously missing on the DVD.  The legal folks must have gotten involved and made sure this portion of the song didn't make it on the DVD.  Even with this missing, the DVD is a must have for any Foreigner fan.

4397375,5,B004KO2EUG,"When you stop to consider that there was only one original member out there on stage, Mick Jones, guitarist, you and I would normally think the worst. And we would be totally WRONG. I don't know how Mick hammered out this performance but in most cases, most of the songs were performed better by far than the originals. Who found these guys and hammered them to absolute perfection all these many years later is question I'll be asking myself for years. I can't find even one single mistake on this entire live performance. Everyone I have shown it to agrees completely. This the best recorded live performance on blu-ray....period. I'm still sitting here with my mouth hanging open. I you even just like Foreigner & have a decent sound system, YOU MUST OWN THIS DISC!",1399334400,6,768,4.696296296296296

This performance at the famed Ryman Auditorium in Nashville is the single best concert performance I have ever seen. The instrumentals and vocals, the drums and keyboard, are electrifying. This DVD contains many of the band's greatest hits like ""Urgent"", ""Hot Blooded"", ""Double Vision"", ""Cold As Ice"", ""Star Rider"", and ""Dirty White Boys"". Band founder and lead guitarist Mick Jones is sensational, and lead singer Kelly Hansen is not to be believed. And the extended performance of the song ""Juke Box Hero"" will just blow you away.",1387670400,,646,5.046728971962617

It is a museum, just like the ""Royal Albert Hall"" in England. The intimate setting allowed for great entertainment. You did not see security in every view. There were other entertainers in the audience, rocking with Foreigner. This is up there with Styx, performing The Grand Illusion and Pieces of Eight concert back to back. I wish more groups would drop what they were doing, forget about angers towards each other. Find a place like the Ryman, and nail it, like they used to. Get it on video, for historical reasons if nothing else. You may even be surprised at your new young fans, just finding out what Mom and Dad were listening to.. I would purchase this again. I have purchased repeats, just to send them to family. I also purchased Journey. I wish that they would get back together, use the ""Ryman"", and do it right! My opinion..

We only bought this because my Mom wanted the song ""When it Comes to Love"" (which isn't on the other DVD). It is on this DVD twice--Kelly in concert & the other guy(who in our opinion can't sing as well) doing the video.
