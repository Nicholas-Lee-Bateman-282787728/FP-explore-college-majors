8590678,5,B00D8TLDRY,"These DVD's are easy to understand with lots of examples and hands on experience. The creator of these DVD's has worked with Power and Love Ministries for years and knows the dynamics of different types of speakers, as well as different types of musicians. I had no experience whatsoever and can tell the difference in tones, what they are, what they do and how to control them to maximize your vocal experience. If I can learn how to do this with no experience then anyone can. I loved how simple it was to understand.",1371254400,,519,4.531914893617022
8590679,5,B00D8TLDRY,"Great resource for training your volunteer audio crew. His professional training and sometimes humorous bedside manner really help make the material stick. You can see his experience on the subject matter and it really helps things make sense. From Gain structure to EQ to what even belongs in mix, he covered it all from a professional standpoint. Definitely would recommend to anyone trying to raise their level of skill in the Church audio world...",1371168000,,451,5.108108108108108
8590680,5,B00D8TLDRY,"I have been the lead audio technician for my 1000 member church for nearly 3 years and have been looking for a training curriculum that would enable my new volunteers to get up to speed and learn the language and techniques to mixing live sound. This course is the perfect solution. It was great for my seasoned techs as a refresher, and for people who just had an interest in learning the basics. I only hope that seeing this that the Lead pastor will agree to let Tommy lead a live training for our team, but outside of that this is the perfect course.",1370649600,,554,4.336538461538462
8590681,5,B00D8TLDRY,"My job is running modern/contemporary worship for a couple thousand member church in CT.

As any worship leader knows in any church, it can be very difficult to find a strong team of musicians to volunteer to play, and finally when you overcome that huge hurdle it means nothing if you have an untrained volunteer at the soundboard. Doesn't matter if you are a big or small church, the person running your sound is a crucial part of every service.

Tommy Scully has been a blessing to several ministries and I've seen him pulled in 19 different directions because of so many people wanting him to run sound and/or train their volunteers. Finally this product is out.

He's come out with a step by step tutorial on how to get the most out of any sound system/PA you have for your worship services/sermons.  Its an easy to understand series that you can refer back to and train as many volunteers as you can find.

I highly recommend this product for a church, big or small. Its a tool that will stay relevant and vital for a LONG time.",1370563200,,1034,4.4787234042553195
8590682,5,B00D8TLDRY,"This was an excellent training tool to start our volunteers on. Tommy takes us right from ground zero, what sound is all the way to how to EQ and the dynamics of mixing for a church environment. We will use this series each time we add someone to our sound team to start them in their training. Totally worth the money.",1370563200,,319,4.245901639344262
