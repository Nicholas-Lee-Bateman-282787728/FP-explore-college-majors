888793,1,6304475705,"Very disappointed in this dinosaur feature from National Geographic. I bought this for my dinosaur-obsessed son, but this movie is only 1/3 about dinosaurs! Most of the movie covers other creatures, such as modern reptiles, birds, bugs, spiders, bats... The other creatures were not a bonus, rather they were the main feature, so my son was quickly bored with this movie. He did want me to restart it at the dinosaur segment, but it is very short. Also the cover shows a realistic dinosaur and my son is used to CG, so the clay-mation dinosaurs in the movie looked silly to him. The cartoons and loud voice over were also distracting. I love National Geographic, so I was very disappointed in the quality and focus of this feature.",1430352000,,731,4.71875
888794,5,6304475705,"A wonderful movie my 5 year old loves it, dinosaurs, bats, bugs, it's perfect for young boys and girls who love creepy crawlies and dinosaurs, accompanied by a wonderful host Dudley Moore,  watching it brings back memories of Milo and Otis from when I was a kid, it shipped quickly and I had it in time for my son's birthday, he's watched it over and over and it hasn't gotten old yet",1427328000,,384,4.333333333333333

888799,2,6304475705,"From an adult's perspective: worst movie ever. Almost unbearable to watch.

However, my kid likes it. He doesn't notice the extremely crude animation, or awful music. He likes the dinosaurs and other creepy creatures.

So, not sure what to say. The good thing is that some kids like it. The bad thing is you might have to watch it yourself.",1253664000,,340,4.65
888800,5,6304475705,I have two grandsons that dearly love anything to do with Dinosaurs and animals of that nature.  This was a gift for Easter and it was a big hit.  I received it in about 4 days so I really cannot complain about that.  I will use Amazon in the future and always do if I need something that I think I will have a hard time finding.,1178928000,3,329,3.8805970149253732
888801,4,6304475705,"We bought this video because our twin boys love dinosaurs and bugs. The first part of the video is all about dinosaurs and relatives of the dinosaurs that are around today - reptiles and birds. The second part is about bugs, bats, vultures, and other ""creepy"" creatures. The dinosaur footage is old and a bit cheesy, and adults will find the video silly, but our 3 1/2 year olds love this video and ask to watch it every day. There is a lot of scientific information in the video as you'd expect from National Geographic. It is narrated by Dudley Moore. The older video footage is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars.",1178582400,9,620,4.447368421052632
