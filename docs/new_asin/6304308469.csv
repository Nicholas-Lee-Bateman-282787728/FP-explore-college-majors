841619,4,6304308469,"When I first rented this movie I had no way of being prepared for what I was about to see. I assumed like most films of this era that it was going to be some sort of cute romantic movie, that probably never deserved to win the ""Best Picture"" Oscar. I was completely shocked as I watched this film to see the themes that unfolded; the meaning of life, love, lust, and death! Based on the play ""Menschen im Hotel"" by Vicki Baum and the American play by William A. Drake, ""Grand Hotel"" catches our attention right from the very beginning. The film, for those who don't know, and I'm sure there are many who don't, is about the ""Grand Hotel"", and what exactly goes on in a place we are told nothing ever happens. If they only knew!! Otto Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) is going to die very soon, so he decides to take out his life savings, and enjoy the last days of his life. This very same idea was later used in Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"". The one thing Kringelein HAS to do is stay at the ""Grand Hotel"". And, he wants the best room they have! Then there's Baron Felix Von Geigern (John Barrymore), who has run out of his luck, and now is broke, he finds himself in debt, and will do ANYTHING to get out of it. Wallace Beery (Preysing) is a business man who finds himself also in a load of trouble, his company won't be able to close a deal that might cost his job. Grusinskaya (The ALWAYS amazing Greta Garbo!! One of my all time favorite actresses)is a dancer who just doesn't want to dancer anymore, she feels that the audience no longer enjoys her performances. And, finally rounding out everything, there's Joan Crawford (Flaemmchen) who works for Preysing (Beery), and has fallen under the charms of Geigern (J.Barrymore). Edmund Goulding's directing is very good. He's able to display each story in a way that makes it fresh. He doesn't take the same appoarch to every scene. Which really impressed me. Most directors, even today, could and might of [goofed] up the whole movie by not knowing how to ""treat"" it. I'm not going to discusse every little detail about this movie, that would take me far too long, but, I will make a few more comments. The ending is a shocker! I did not see it coming, I assumed it would of ended happily, in a way I'm glad it didn't. For a movie made in 1932 I think this was a bit ahead of it's time. I hope many many others rent or buy this film. It's a wonderful movie that has some of the best actors\actresses of that era (Garbo, L. Barrymore, and J. Crawford). Truly deserving of it's Oscar.",991353600,,2523,4.381663113006397
841620,5,6304308469,"this movie was made in the very early 30s and the first of its kind, casting five of mgms greatest stars in the one movie. Grand Hotel chronicles about three night in the berlin ""Grand Hotel"" and with it comes attempted suicide, murder, and sex. Garbo, who doesnt appear for some twenty minutes, is a depressed and lonely ballerina and is considering suicide, only to be interrupted by hotel thief John Gilbert. Joan Crawford is a sophisticated stenographer who has many other qualities, and recieves the interest of several gentle men, enter wallace barry.
the production won a well deserved oscar for best picture and although its onscreen technology is dated, it is still interesting to watch.
Garbo, as ever, steals the picture with her very presence, nmaking the role her very one, but is challenged by the luminous joan crawford who sparkles with enthusiasm. John Gilbart is miscast as an irritating thhief with a large dollap of sarcasm, although it is meant to be sincerity.
 Overall this will not dissapoint!!!!",985305600,,1020,4.964912280701754
841621,5,6304308469,"This is one my all-time favorite delights: MGM at its peak as the glamour studio of the world! Movie immortals at their peaks, too: Garbo, unforgettable as the fading ballerina; a fantastic Joan Crawford, warm, sensual, adorable, far from the wooden zombie she became by the seventies; John Barrymore, dashing, charming, just before his slide into acute alcoholism. On and on. Adrian designed the unforgettable gowns and dresses for la Garbo and Crawford. This was only a prelude to the phenomenal gowns, capes, fur-lined wintercoats, hats, gloves, boots he was to create for Garbo that same year in her masterpiece, ""Mata Hari."" I go into detail about both these classics in my book on old Hollywood, ""The Kiss of King Kong."" Of all the stars in this movie, it's Crawford who steals the spotlight with her poignant scene with the dying Grindelein (Lionel Barrymore)when she takes over the phone and, barely able to keep her voice from breaking, orders two train tickets to Paris. What a show! No wonder so many of us had much rather watch these golden classics when movies were made by small groups of geniuses: Adrian, cameraman William Daniels, directors like Edmund Goulding, true stars like Garbo, Barrymore, Crawford, when we get nothing but garbage today like ""American Beauty"" ""Dude, Who STole My Car"" and ""Dracula 2000"".",978912000,,1329,5.018099547511312
841622,5,6304308469,"Even today this mult-star blockbuster film crackles with wit, temperament and vitality all stemming from the cream of MGM's then-finest talent. Joan Crawford is very vivacious and appealing here, and her acting style is very  different from the rather wooden zombie we saw in the forties and fifties.  Barrymore and Garbo do well in their roles and Wallace Beery is impressive  as the German Preysing. To get an idea of just how much times have changed,  Crawford's fee for her playing of Flaemmchen was a mere $60,000!",947116800,2,519,4.931034482758621

841693,5,6304308469,"I love classic films--especially those from Old Hollywood.  The storytelling is often inventive, the technical qualities (camera movement, shot composition, music, etc.) are excellent.  Do they have all the bells and whistles (and strobe light editing) of current films?  Thankfully, no.

The pace of these stories is refreshing and given the strictures Hollywood faced in terms of the Hayes office and public sentiment, there was a subtlety that was necessary.  These barriers elevated the artistry of these movies because the producers had to convey meaning without being pedantically explicit.

I also love these films as time capsules of a long-vanished way of life whose pace and mode of living somehow seemed more authentic.  Yes, I am also acutely aware of the technological and societal shortcomings, but like with any era, it's a mixed bag and in our time of hyperconnectivity, persistent surveillance, it's nice to take a quick trip to the past to enjoy an emotional, well-crafted and visually interesting story.",1498953600,,1022,5.3105590062111805
841694,5,6304308469,"This film has been described by some where ""nothing happens"", which turns a lot of people off. It's true, in the traditional sense since there's no obvious plot. This film being about nothing reminds me of some stories I read in college while studying film and writing, where the core of the story (film, in this case) is an unexpected telling of a moment that would usually be overlooked or mentioned but is focused on because it's vital in some way. In Grand Hotel the characters are the driving force with paralleling subplots. We don't know what exactly has brought them all here or what their fate will be when they leave. We just know what is happening to them over the course of a brief stay at Grand Hotel. That sounds mundane, doesn't it? But give the film a chance and you'll see how they are all affected by the particular moment.

 It's an interesting story with well rounded characters, beautiful art direction. I will admit I initially ordered this because I love Greta Garbo (especially in silents) and saw John Barrymore in Midnight (1939) awhile back and enjoyed his performance. Some have defined 1930s film by this one film, I don't think I'd go so far as to echo that but that's only because I can think of other films that capture the style, architecture and Great Depression in other ways that also define the 1930s. But of course this is subjective!

 Also worth noting is one of the special features is a newsreel of the premiere. On some of my other classic DVDs the newsreels are very short and have no sound but I was surprised this one has sound! The actors/actresses speak into the microphone for the live radio broadcast that fans would have been listening to. I wish the footage would have been longer because I loved it so much, but if you love Old Hollywood and especially 1930s movie stars you will really like what footage is available of the premiere.",1486771200,2,1887,4.5905044510385755

841757,5,6304308469,"Exceeded my highest envisioned considerations of this most classic film from the top step of the Best Picture category for the Academy Award in 1932. I overlooked this film for decades, due to my own ignorance in appreciation of the cinema during it's infancy in time. I feel it was an education in film appreciation, worthy of any I had viewed for credit in college courses during the late '60's and early '70's.
Another item I was so pleased in is that the quality of the video production allowed/secured by Amazon.com was pristine, and provided the reviewer a most enjoyable visual as well as an audible trip down Silver Screen lane.
Wonderful cast, wonderful acting, wonderful script, wonderful direction, wonderful experience in appreciation of vintage cinematography. I can only imagine how audiences must have been astonished as they sat in the grand old palace theaters witnessing this now historical gem.
I do not know, as some of you do already, if this classic had been digitally colorized in restoration over time, as I was so pleased to find it in it's original glorious black, white and various shades of gray/grey.
An enjoyable education in Cinematic History, to all those whom have waited, but hesitated to purchase the ticket, now that the audience lines have diminished to bearable lengths, with the exception of your in-house snack-bar.

P.S. For those imbibing certain libations, reserve only top shelf spirits for the, The Louisiana Flip's.  Avoiding at all costs, anything sharper than the business end of a Mother of Pearl caviar spoon and/or a well-placed sofa to break the occasional fall.
I hope all of you will enjoy for the 1st time, (or the 81st) this classic Academy Award Winner for, Best Motion Picture of 1932.
As the Academy certainly got it right on that memorable night, just a few quick grains of hourglass sand ago, in time.",1467072000,3,1862,4.926751592356688

First of all, I still can't see what all the fuss is over Greta Garbo - to me she is very hammy and over the top...an exotic accent can only get you so far. The Barrymore brothers were pretty good, though I have to admit John Barrymore seemed intoxicated in a couple of scenes...and there was no drinking involved in these scenes.

When she skipped and danced around in her fur coat, I was enthralled. I loved the atmosphere of the hotel and all of the actors involved. I waited anxiously for the bell captain's wife to have her baby while he sweated away at the hotel. I enjoyed seeing Joan Crawford as a very young actor typing away for the big bully. The baron was exquisite in his role. It was a delightful experience for us. I am enjoying catching up on the older movies that I missed so many years ago. They really knew how to make wonderful movies then. I love seeing the old cars and the beautiful costumes that the ladies wore. Also the music was great.

In my opinion this is one of the great dramas that transcends time. While the world situation is different now, many still struggle w similar stresses and worries. The famous line, ""I want to be alone"", uttered by the lovely Greta Garbo who was in despair made me want to hope for her. This movie is dramatic, smart and offers an amazing group of famous actors.  Most of the characters in this movie you will find yourself wanting them to be able to rise above their lot and find happiness.

I have loved movies since  I was a very little girl and have seen thousands.  I do not have any one particular type of film and love a great variety of genres. GRAND HOTEL is one of the best films ever made.  It is visually beautiful as well as beautifully written and directed.  The acting is unlike anything we could find today in one movie.  Imagine putting todays biggest stars all in one film and not have a blood bath by the end of the first day of shooting! (No pun intended)  The last five minutes of GRAND HOTEL is one of the most touching moments in all of film history. The few words spoken by Barrymore to Crawford are my favorite in only a small handful of movies to this day. I watch this film every year and the last scene makes me cry every time. It is not soap opera mush or even the kind of love scene most of us are brought to tears over,  I guess you will have to watch it to know what I mean.

Both John & Lionel shine in their parts, reminding us why they (and their sister Ethel) dominated stage & screen for half a century. Joan Crawford arouses equal amounts of admiration and pity as a working girl fighting to keep some shreds of self respect in a pitiless world.

There's a diva dancer (Greta Garbo), a Baron who sidelines as a crook (John Barrymore), a dying accountant (Lionel Barrymore), a savvy stenographer (Joan Crawford), a desperate scheming industrialist (Wallace Beery), and a bored doctor (Lewis Stone).  Their lives crisscross and entangle throughout the story, culminating in a murder.  (I don't care how fancy it is, this is not a hotel I'd care to stay in.)

Of course it's dated, the darn thing is eons old and it shows.  The acting style is extravagant to say the least, most of the stars present knew exactly how to play to the camera and show their best side at all times.  None of the performances were ""natural"" by any means.  Still, it is an oddly moving and absorbing film, fraught with humor and angst.

It's historically relevant if nothing else.",1400198400,,1201,4.649289099526066

842346,5,6304308469,"MGM's 1932 all-star extravaganza, GRAND HOTEL, was the first of its kind to include several major box-office names in one production. The film utilized a wide range of filming techniques - overhead crane shots, moving camera, cross cutting, artistic lighting and  long takes - to infuse emotion and drama into its premise which takes place entirely at a posh Berlin hotel while overlapping the individual crises of its patrons. It was a novel idea and proved extremely successful, spawning many similarly structured films such as DINNER AT EIGHT (MGM,1933), WEEKEND AT THE WALDORF (MGM,1945), THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY (Warner Brothers,1954), and THE V.I.P.S (MGM, 1963), to name a few.

Based on a novel and play by Vicki Baum, GRAND HOTEL was directed by Edmund Goulding and stars Greta Garbo, John and Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford and Wallace Beery all in roles of equal importance, and each shines in what counts among their best performances. The luminous Garbo is perfect as a tired of life ballerina, her stylized acting captures just the right note of eccentricity. This is the film in which she utters her signature line, ""I want (not ""vant"") to be alone"". Crawford is radiant, chic and sensitive as a stenographer assigned to work for boorish business magnate Beery, who, despite his villainous character, manages to generate our sympathy. Beery is the only one to affect a German accent which serves to underscore his menace and alienates him from the other characters. John Barrymore displays his celebrated profile and gives a touching and ultimately tragic  portrayal as a thief forced into his trade out of dire need, and Lionel Barrymore is a likeable old fellow who believes he's dying and decides to live it up during his stay at the Grand Hotel.

The hotel itself figures as one of the main characters, and its elaborate art-deco design is showcased to great advantage, consisting of a circular construction and checkered floor tiles, topped off by the main lobby desk and telephone switchboard. Everything was given top-notch treatment, resulting in a film that epitomizes the Hollywood studio system at its very finest. Quality and dignity represented the order of the day in that classical period of filmmaking, and GRAND HOTEL met every expectation both critically and commercially, going on to win Best Picture of 1932. To this day it's still regarded as one of the greatest films of its decade, and has been selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry for being ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"".

The newest Blu-ray release of GRAND HOTEL from Warners is quite grand to be sure, with a clarity and density that outdoes the previous DVD. The grain configuration is  tantamount to 35mm film, and details in clothing and background elements are readily apparent. This pristine presentation of an 81 year old film makes one appreciate even more the exceptional skill of the cinematographers of that time. Of course, they also had movie stars with the kinds of fabulous faces that the camera could adore. The audio on this release is clear and crisp, with voices registering at a pleasing pitch without any distortion. All in all, it makes viewing this vintage classic a very enjoyable experience.

The extras are all taken from the DVD: ""Checking Out"" - a making-of documentary, the Grauman's Chinese Theater premiere newsreel, ""Just a Word of Warning"" Theater Announcement, the Vitaphone spoof ""Nothing Ever Happens"", and trailers for GRAND HOTEL and WEEKEND AT THE WALDORF - a 1945 semi remake. The only new feature is a well researched commentary by Jeffrey Vance and Mark Vieira which adds insight and is particularly helplful to viewers who are challenged by older movies.

842349,5,6304308469,"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer [MGM}, the premier and most profitable studio of the 1930s and Irving Grant Thalberg {IGT}, the Studio's creative vice president in charge of production and greatest production executive of that {or any other} era with this film showed Hollywood {then and now} how to make an engrossing all star film that remains untarnished by time 80 + years after it's debute as one of filmdom's greatest drama's.

IGT was the driving force in pushing the production forward with 5 major stars {most""A Class"" product in 1932 had 2 stars}, fine-tuning the script, casting the picture and working with director Edmund Goulding to create the nuiances / details that create the tension, humor, pathos and drama within the screenplay taking place in a luxury hotel located in Berlin in pre- 1933 Germany before the Nazi storm.

The all-star cast includes: Greta Garbo - Gruinskaya, the fading ballerina disillusioned with life, John Barrymore - Baron von Geiger, charming, broke and desperate for money, Joan Crawford - Flaemmchen, the stenographer halfway ""decent"", halfway ""on the make"" - which of these impluses will prevail? , Wallace Beery - General Director Preysing a hypocritical businessman facing ruin unless he pulls off an impossible business merger and blessed with a ""roving eye"", Lionel Barrymore - Otto Kringelein ,a dying little clerk out for one ""last fling"" and in support of the stars: veteran characther actors Lewis Stone as the scarred, forlorn Doctor Ottenschlag and Jean Hersholt playing Senf, the Grand Hotel's chief Porter ""chained to his desk"" with his pregnant wife expecting a nightmare delivery any second.

The Grand Hotel, an art deco marvel courtesy of MGM resident genius art director Cedric Gibbon is the unbilled star of the story where the lives of these very different characthers will inter-twine and some of them will find {and some of them will find and lose} love, death, redemption, wealth, ruin, murder and happiness as their lives and problems criss-cross each other. While every performer gives of their best, two performances in particular stand out - Lionel Barrymore's dying clerk, timid, obseqious with a innate dignity that comes to the hotel to blow his life savings and gets much more than he bargained for and in stark contrast - Wallace Beery's arrogant, gross, ill- mannered boor complete with bristling Prussian haircut and Germanic accent AND YET is somehow still pathetic and vunerable - their performances ""vis a vie"" each other and the rest of the cast crackle and sparkle.

Amoung the many individual bravura episolds /scenes in the film, three in particular stand out: The introduction of the principle players at the films beginning via closeups of them on the telephone all desperately explaining what the various issues that they needed to resolve and thru quick cuts, editing and cross-cutting of the various conversations it becomes more intense and hightens the tension of the scene AND it sets up the various sub-plots for the entire film. In a humorous aside - Kringlelein gleefully stumbling over, thru and around his hotel room while ""drunk as a skunk"" after sampling one to many ""Louisiada Flips"" after winning a fortune gambling at the Hotel's American Bar and the classic meeting of Garbo and Barrymore - The Baron skulking, hidden in her room, ready to commit a carefully planned robbery of Gruinskaya's pearls and upon seeing her beauty and desperation reveals himself and without missing a beat - goes from thief to her rescuer, protector and lover. This scene is beautifily played by both stars and it shows a romantic, understated sexual encounter [with the 1932 audience knowing exactly what will subsequently occur off screen} that is quite different from much of the 2012 -2013 U.S.A's TV and Hollywood view of sex and romance AND after Gruinskaya falls under the barons spell she no longer was in the Garbo ""I vant to be alone"" mode !!

This film is the pre-ultimate example of MGM Studio Product at it's apex - a seamless fusion of star power, glossy production values, sensitive direction, tight editing and a scenario that is compelling and entertaining. At the absolute bottom of the Great Depression in 1932 ""Grand Hotel"" was the highest grossing film taking in over 4 million dollars worldwide {when a movie ticket sold from 10 to 35 cents} and winning the Academy Award for best picture.

You will not see Irving Thalberg's name on any of the credits for ""Grand Hotel"" BUT he was the main force in envisioning, creating and bringing to the screen one of his and MGM's crowning achievements of great product made during MGM's ""Golden Era"" of 1930-1940. Doctor Ottenschalg's periodic weary refrain: ""Grand Hotel, Grand Hotel, people come, people go, nothing ever happens !"" was definitely shown to be a statement that was ""just a tad incorrect"" !!. This is a terrific movie and I give it an enthusiastic 5 Stars  - Highly Recommended.",1351641600,7,4927,5.038036809815951
842429,5,6304308469,"I bought ""Grand Hotel"" for the sole purpose of being an ardent Joan Crawford fan.

 Winner of the 1932 Academy-Award for Best Picture the movie is a who's who of 1930's cinema including Crawford, Greta Garbo, Lionel Barrymore, Wallace Beery and so many others. The plot centers on a variety of colorful characters taking residence in a huge and beautiful hotel in Berlin, the problems the face and the ultimate outcome of their lives.

 ""Grand Hotel"" has been selected as one of those rare films to be preserved by the National Film Registry for preserving and is still highly regarded as one of the greatest movies of all-time.

 Commenting many years later Joan Crawford had only wonderful things to say about the film (it was the only movie in her whole career to ever win the Oscar for Best Picture), but she stated she was heart sick that she didn't have any scenes with Garbo (her idol). According to Joan on the set one day Greta Garbo went up to Crawford, grabbed her by the face and said, ""You have such a lovely face my daarling...it is too bad we have no scenes together"" in her beautiful accent.

842431,5,6304308469,"Directed by Edmund Goulding from the stage production by Vicki Baum, this is one of the MGM's most prestigious projects that star several top performers of the day. Set in the most opulent establishment of post WWI Berlin, the Grand Hotel is where the story unfolds. It is all about life; the good and bad interact, and bad tries to destroy the good and it is the good that win at last. A people-weary prima ballerina named Grusinskaya (Great Garbo) is shy and likes to be alone but starved for love and attention; A conman who presents himself as the Baron Felix Von Greigern (John Barrymore) is desperate to steal precious pearls from Grusinskaya to pay off his debt to his gangster friends; A dying bookkeeper, Otto Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) is out on a mission to enjoy the last few days of his life, and his greedy boss, Preysing (Wallace Beery) is busy negotiating an important merger of his business empire. His young stenographer, Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford) is trying to make on her own in the real world; the hotel bell captain named Senf (Jean Hersholt) is too absorbed to get the good news from the hospital where his wife is about deliver his baby, and then a wealthy doctor, Otternschlag (Lewis Stone) with scarred face is lonely and too bored.

The ambitious Flaemmchen makes the acquaintance of the handsome Baron and falls in love with him, and she also likes the friendship of the kind-hearted gentleman Kringelein. When Grusinskaya is away, the Baron sneaks into her room and steals her pearls, but he finds himself locked inside the room. When Grusinskaya returns to her room, and tries to commit suicide because of depression, he suddenly appears before her and stops her from taking her own life, and in a change of heart, he also returns her pearls. His charming ways changes her heart and she falls in love instantly and dreams of her life with him. Later the Baron steals money from his friend Otto Kringelein who won a large sum of money in a poker game, and eventually returns his money due to a change of heart. Finally he gets caught red-handed by businessman Preysing when he steals his money and in an outburst of anger, Presying's hit gives a fatal blow to Baron's head and kills him. Preysing ends up in jail, Flaemmchen finds love where she least expected, the kind and gentle soul, Kringelein, Grusinskaya is lost after she couldn't find the Baron. Radiant in love, one can only imagine the despair that awaits her.

This is a fantastic story of a conman who in his last few days of life bring love and happiness in the lives of two women who desperately seek them. He spends his entire life stealing from others. He is miserable and merciless, but one sweet act changes his ways. Sweet old Kringelein is rejuvenated after finding love in young and beautiful Flaemmchen. Greedy and heartless businessman Preysing finds nothing but darkness ahead. This is a story of the good, the bad and ugly; it is the good that finally wins. The movie is brilliantly directed and it is the Barrymore brothers who steal the show, especially John Barrymore who offers a brilliant performance as a conman who goes from being bad to being good. This is also one of the big movies of Great Garbo, but she appears in very few scenes than Joan Crawford.

There are several memorable quotes from this film that reverberated through history. Greta Grabo's words; ""I want to be alone"" is one of them. She is known to be shy and strongly liked her privacy wherever she went in her personal life. Other memorable dialogue is when Baron changes the heart of beautiful Grusinskaya

Grusinskaya: ""Can you imagine a hundred girls in the ballet school, each thinking she would become the most famous dancer in all the world? I was ambitious then. We were drilled like little soldiers. No rest, no stopping. I was little; slim, but hard as a diamond. Then I became famous and.... but why am I telling you all this?

It also looks like a fun place to stay, especially that little bar where everyone meets at 5:00 to do whatever it is people do at little bars at 5:00.

I wish they had changed Garbo's character from a ballerina to ANYTHING ELSE.  She isn't graceful enough to be a world famous ballerina. This is the movie where she professes to wanting to be alone.  I'd leave her alone.  Her falling in love with John Barrymore is preposterous.  Of course, we all fall in love with the person that breaks into our hotel room, don't we?  Especially if you're a world famous ballerina.  Their love scenes are not convincing, but it's Garbo and Barrymore (!!!!) so of course we are supposed to be impressed and entranced.

I'm not.

Crawford's stenographer.  She plays it very well and is perhaps one of the easiest in the cast to take.  Sure, she'll run off with dying Lionel Barrymore for his money but so what?  She's a stenographer and a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.

Wallace Beery is bluff.  All thunder and fire.  Fun to watch.  Can you imagine Gloria Swanson being married to this man?  She was.  Around 1917 or so.  He attempts an accent (the only one in the cast to do so) but don't ask me what kind of accent it is supposed to be.

John Barrymore is John Barrymore.  Being photographed in profile as usual, but he has a nice voice.  He doesn't look like a jewel thief (but who does?).

Lewis Stone's facial scar is never explained.  He quieetly keeps saying ""people coming...people going...nothing ever happens...""  Well, it's an all-star vehicle from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1932 so of course a lot happens.  Everyone has a secret and no one is who they appear to be.  It's a great film and Cedric Gibbons deserves all the praise and awards he can for this one.  His hotel truly is a marvel.",1335830400,2,1946,4.443181818181818

I was impressed with Lionel Barrymore & Wallace Berry they were the only real actors in this story.

My last thought about Greta Garbo she repeated and repeated in this movie ""I Vant to be A lone"" in a thick  accent and over acted to point it was laughable.

842530,4,6304308469,"Grand Hotel(released Sept/32)was MGM's biggest film extravaganza to date and featured some of the biggest screen names all together in one film;at MGM or elsewhere. It certainly had a major impact on all future releases from all of the major studios and their usage of their own star power. No matter how else the film may be perceived going on over 75 years now,it is a fascinating glimpse at the power and clout at the disposal of the biggest studio of its' day.
The film stars Greta Garbo as Grusinskaya,a Russian ballet dancer,Wallace Beery as Mr. Preysing an industrialist,John Barrymore as Baron Von Geigern,Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Kringelein an accountant,Joan Crawford as Flaemmchaen,a stenographer,Lewis Stone as Dr Otternschlag, and Jean Herscholt as Senf,the head hotel porter. MGM wonder kind Irving Thalberg assembled the cast and put this film into production. MGM owned the rights to the story and had backed its' Broadway play version a couple of years before so its' transition from stage to screen was relatively smooth.
The story works on many levels at once. Among the many guests is Grusinskaya,a worn down ballet dancer who is staying at this the Berlin(Germany)property of the Grand Hotel chain. Her performances of late have been poorly received and she is very depressed. More than once she utters(what was to become)the immortal line:""I (v)want to be alone!"".Baron Von Geigern is also friendless,alone and more importantly,broke. He owes some lowly people some money and plans to steal Grusinskaya's pearls. But he inadvertently falls head over heels in love with the ballerina(only in the movies,folks!).Meanwhile a lowly desk accountant Kringelein has come to the hotel to enjoy a final fling,as he has a terminal illness. He runs into his company boss Preysing,who is not only a bully but who is also desperate. He is seeking a merger with some foreign companies and it is not going well. Preysing has hired a stenographer called Flaemmchaen. She has fallen hard for the Baron but her feelings are not to be reciprocated. She agrees to accompany Preysing to England on ""business"" but he catches the Baron trying to steal his wallet. Presying kills him and ends up being arrested for murder. Flaemmchaen and Kringelein both grieve at the Baron's demise(the Baron was good to them both)and come to the agreement that Kringelein will spend the last days he has treating Flaemmchaen and himself to the best time they can possibly have,and leave at once for Paris. Gruisnskaya who has been on cloud nine ever since the Baron's admission of his love and devotion to her,leaves for Vienna on the train where she hopes to rendezvous with the Baron;which we know will never be. Throughout all this turmoil and trouble the head porter Senf has had a wife in labour(the longest in screen history!) and at the end she finally gives birth to a boy. Mother a child are doing well,thank you. As the main protagonists leave the hotel new faces arrive to breathe a new life into it,as life indeed does goes on. Dr. Otternschlag has come in and out of the film throughout dispensing tidbits of advice,both practical and philosophical. He was a veteran of WWI who had the right side of his face disfigured due to a grenade and the resulting infection which set in. At the end of the film,as he does in the beginning,he states""...nothing ever happens here"".Filled with obvious irony and a telling testimony to the doctor's lack of perception and to the blinders he carries around with him.
Grand Hotel was ably directed by Edmund Goulding,or should I just say he ably assisted the proceedings. These were huge talents put into his hands and I doubt whether Goulding had to give much direction to the likes of either Barrymore or a Lewis Stone or Jean Herscholt;pros all. The newest of the main cast is Joan Crawford. She was at this point still an up and coming actor but she gives a very nice performance and stands toe to toe with all the veterans that surround her. Speaking of which,Lionel Barrymore gives a splendid performance as Kringelein the deathly sick desk accountant. His choice of dress,accessories and demeanor enhance his role beautifully. Then there is his talented brother,the Great Profile himself,John. John also turns in a boffo performance as the desperate but gentlemanly and kind Baron. Garbo,well I must be honest,I have never been a Garbo fan. With her deep throaty voice and less than(to me)subtle acting ability,I have always considered her far over rated. However while she continues to over act here,she at times does hit an amenable mark and is at her best with her scenes with Barrymore. And speaking of her and Barrymore you might take a closer look at the case cover for this DVD,taken from a period lobby card. Notice the couple's embrace;look familiar? It should. It was the self same embrace(and look) of the much played up ""romance"" between a younger Garbo and the screen's then leading man John Gilbert of just a few short years before in the ""silents"" period. Both were MGM properties then,but while Garbo was getting bigger and bigger,Gilbert had been long disgraced and persona non grata at MGM.He would be dead in about four years.
Technically this is virtually the same release print from the 2004 initial release;same picture and same features. The picture,while generally good in contrast and crispness,still needs a bit of work as it can get quite grainy and scratchy at times. There are a number of interesting features included:a featurette on the movie,footage of its' premiere at the Graumann's Chinese Theatre,a ""warning"" theatrical film clip of the films' last days of showing in the L.A area,its trailer and a quite funny Warners Vitaphone 1933 short""Nothing Ever Happens"".It's a musical spoof,often scripted in rhyme both spoken and musical. All the minor Warner actors here are made up to look as close to the stars of the Grand Hotel as possible and they did a bang up job,I can tell you. Also watch for the chorines that come in and out of the short;they are like refugees from the Radio City Music Hall!
All in all a nice release of a ""grand"" old picture,chock full of some of the best stars off the then MGM lot. Though it certainly runs the gamut of emotions,it can easily be perceived as quite melodramatic with a depressing overtone throughout. I find the performances here by the Barrymore brothers to be the scene stealer's throughout. It's a juggernaut of MGM talent and it is little wonder it ended up winning a best picture OSCAR that year. It just shows the tip of the iceberg of talent MGM had at their disposal in the 30s. Look at MGM today and wonder at just how far the mighty have fallen!",1267315200,,6671,4.873239436619718
842531,4,6304308469,"""Grand Hotel"" is the mother of all blockbusters, although it had been preceded by""Paramount on Parade"" (1930), also by director Edmund Goulding. What distinguished ""Grand Hotel"" from ""Parade"" was that the all star cast were used in a story as characters, rather than an all star review in which the stars played themselves. ""Grand Hotel"" was also distinguished by the interlocking stories that, at first, appear unrelated, but slowly merge together, a technique commonplace today, but never before attempted in cinema.

Never before (and possibly since) had so many major stars appeared in a single film. Garbo was fresh off two Academy Award nominations (""Anna Christie"" and ""Romance""), Wallace Beery had been nominated as Best Actor for his role in ""The Big House"" (1930) and won for ""The Champ"" (1932), the Barrymores had just appeared together in ""Rasputin"" (1932), John had an enormous success with ""Svengali"" (1931) and Lionel had won the Best Actor for ""A Free Soul"" (1930), Wallace Stone had been nominated for Best Actor for his role in ""The Patriot"" (1929) and played alongside Beery in ""The Big House"" (1930).

Joan Crawford didn't have the same award pedigree as the others, but by 1932 she was a hit at the box office and her marriage to Douglas Fairbanks Jr. added to her clout. From 1932 through 1936 she was among the top 10 moneymaking stars.

The black and white film is crisp and the sound is excellent. Edmund Goulding's direction keeps the nearly 2 hour film moving along quickly, and the changes from one subplot to the next are done seamlessly which was rare in those days. It won the Best Picture award for 1932, beating out ""The Champ"" and ""Five Star Final"".

""Grand Hotel"" is important as a sort of psychodrama, the onscreen roles of the main characters revealing a lot about their personal lives and their off screen personalities. For example...

- Contrary to his ""Aw shucks"" screen persona, Wallace Beery was known for his violent temper and disagreeable personality. None other than child star Jackie Cooper referred to him as a ""big disappointment"" and child actress Margaret O'Brien complained about Beery's constant pinching. Curiously enough, Beery said ""I hate the lousy part...I told 'em I didn't want to do it..."" and staged a 2 day strike, to no avail.

- Like her on screen character, Garbo vanted to be alone, and by 1935 she had started to withdraw, and in 1941 she would retire. Prior to Grand Hotel she made 2 to 4 films a year; after she made less than 1 per year. There are 23 films prior to 1932 and only 7 after.

- John Barrymore plays a renowned Baron who has squandered his wealth and now makes money by playing cars and occasional thievery. In fact Barrymore had squandered his enormous talent and gave perfunctory performances after 1932 in such forgettable films as ""Night Flight"", ""Maytime"" ""True Confession"", etc. Flashes of his former great self were seen only on occasion (e.g., Mercutio in ""Romeo and Juliet"" in 1936).

- John Barrymore romances a stenographer (Joan Crawford) but it is brother Lionel who leaves with her for Paris. In real life, brother John had started a romance with silent screen actress Irene Fenwick but it was brother Lionel who left with her for Paris (ie., married her).

- Joan Crawford plays a woman of loose morals, and at the time of ""Grand Hotel"" she was married to Douglas Fairbanks Jr. while having an affair with Clark Gable.

""Grand Hotel"" won the academy award for Best Picture, however, director Edmund Goulding was not nominated for Best Director, an unusual event since most pictures and directors are nominated together (in fact, it's happened less than a half dozen times). ""Hotel"" was not nominated in any other category, although Beery won for his role in ""The Champ"" (he tied with Frederic March's ""Jekyll and Hyde"" - the first and only tie). Director Goulding earned himself the nickname ""The Lion Tamer"" for keeping such big egos in check during the filming.

Variety said it was better than the stage play and praised the Barrymores and Beery, but called Garbo ""artificial"" and said that Crawford was ""not the most fortunate casting."" The New York Herald called the film ""dull"" John Barrymore said that Beery was ""the best actor on the set"" and the Des Moines Register agreed.

The film will appeal to fans of 30s films and to people who enjoy blockbusters. It's also a great chance to see these legendary actors in one place.",1266710400,,4432,4.832453825857519

Schatz's detailed research of the making of ""Grand Hotel"" clearly shows why MGM was considered Hollywood's top studio.  Prior to going into production in January 1932, there were dozens of story conferences with producer Irving Thalberg, director Edmund Goulding, and several top MGM personnel. Complicated rewrites were needed before production could begin. Problems with the script remained even after dozens of rewrites. In mid January production began.  There were no problems on the set due to such a professional cast under the supervision of Edmund Goulding, MGM's top director. In early March upon completion of the film, there were several previews held in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Much to the surprise of the studio and its cast, the film was not well received. Back to the rewrites, reshooting and editing. A month later, the film premiered and this time the audiences' reception was quite different. MGM proudly saw this film nominated for Best Picture--which it won months later.",1227744000,,1181,5.140625
842538,5,6304308469,"Lewis Stone with his twisted and burned up face, that looks bright red when he shows his right profile, steals the show if you're looking for the freakish side to pre-Code films.  They would not have allowed him to wear that makeup had the film been made a year later.  It's still pretty startling and symbolizes, I suppose, Janus, the face that looks backward and forward at the same time: a suitable pendant for the mise en scene of the GRAND HOTEL, where nothing changes, everything is always the same, and yet everything happens if you look at it from a different angle.

It's sort of a mishmash of acting styles, but in general terms we are seeing the final bid of silent acting as a viable art form.  Garbo in particular seems to think she is still in silents, as does Wallace Beery, and their wonderful faces are always exquisitely placed within the frame.  The brothers Barrymore are in there trying to make sense of modern-day ""talkie acting""--unfortunately this gives Lionel the permission he's seeking to go all over the place with those ridiculous moans, snorts and giggles.  Really it's enough to make you wonder why all the characters (but Beery) think of him as such a cute ""odd duck.""  He's about as cute as a toad.  John Barrymore, on the other hand, breaks on through into the slick modernity of screen acting, calming down his larger than life gestures and sublimating them to a bigger scheme of the what the story demands.  (Which is peculiar in many ways and is about as far from the present-day demands of the three act structure as you couldm imagine.)  His part is the most difficult as well as the most integrated, but he has to show us that he has fallen in love with Garbo's ballerina at the same time that he is developing some sort of erotic/romantic/paternal feelings for the young stenographer Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford).  All the stories revolve around him, and this is possible because of the bizarre ""classlessness"" of his Baron.  Is the Baron a real gentleman, or are his aristocratic affectations part of the con artist's resume?  This question is, exquisitely, never answered and the ambiguity is at the heart of the Weimar romance.

Of course things were changing in Berlin in the very year GRAND HOTEL was being produced.  Here and there you could swear you are seeing the up and coming signs of Hitler's reign coming on: in the scene, for example, where the grown bellmen line up for their shift and turn their hands palm upwards and down for cleanliness inspection.

And yes, Joan Crawford is pretty great here--though again Lionel Barrymore's relentless hamming prevents me from actually believing Flaemmchen honestly cares for him--though even if she's just after his money, the storyline still works.",1223164800,,2744,4.794055201698514
842579,5,6304308469,"""Don't you understand? Don't you?"" -- Barrymore telling Garbo he loves her.

Vicki Baum's popular novel was given the MGM treatment for the first time in ""Grand Hotel."" Though it does not hold up as well as its remake, ""Weekend at the Waldorf,"" due to the lack of symmetry between a director and one of the stars, the overall impact is not muted in the least. It remains an entertaining time capsule to the early days of sound pictures, when MGM was just starting to roar.

The story of a diverse group of people crossing paths and dramas, forming bonds and loving, probably seems old hat today. But this is where it all began. With names like Greta Garbo, John and Lionel Barrymore, and Wallace Berry, it is really Joan Crawford who emerged the most memorable. Her sparkling performance showed she could not only hold her own among the more heralded prestige stars, but could actually overshadow them with her charisma.

Garbo is a lonely ballerina in need of love; love which jewel thief John Barrymore will unexpectedly and, surprisingly to him, give her, at least until his desperate need for money brings about tragedy. Lionel Barrymore shines as the dying man truly tasting life for the first time. His performance is adorable and the best here sans Crawford, whose worldly but wistful secretary in search of the good life leaves the most lasting mark.

John Barrymore hadn't yet lost his magic and is excellent here, his performance only muted in scenes with Garbo. This can be attributed in whole to the failure of Garbo and director Edmund Goulding to mesh. Garbo gave a silent film performance in a sound film and Goulding allowed her to do so. It doesn't work for the most part, and creates some stilted moments. Only in the moments when she gives in to Barrymore's love for her does her silent radiance appear, her joy afterward and sheer happiness intoxicating to the viewer.

Berry is also good as the heavy, but once again Crawford overshadows him. You simply can't take your eyes off her, her beauty and charisma luminous proof of her star power. William Daniels' photography, gowns by Adrian, and the art direction of Cedric Gibbons all come together to make ""Grand Hotel"" one of the spectacular events of early sound film and a must see for Crawford's fans.",1209254400,,2275,4.749367088607595

The secret, besides a clever script, dazzling sets and costumes, of course is the cast!  Wow!  Some people complain that the acting is too mannered, especially in the cases of John Barrymore and Greta Garbo but I heartily disagree.  Garbo plays a grand diva of the old school--she thinks big, acts big, lives big.  Mumbling of the type of modern acting brought on by The Actors' Studio is not appropriate here.  This is more akin to Grand Opera---big passions, big gestures.  The scenes with Barrymore and Garbo are priceless--two great, beautiful people---look at those perfect profiles!  The chemistry between them was apparent.  How fortunate we are to have this recorded on film for us.

I did not know who played the spunky little stenographer and was amazed to discover it was Joan Crawford.  She was very good here and showed a sweet, innocent quality that she lost somewhere along the way, unfortunately.  The rest of the cast, as everyone else has mentioned, is ...stellar!

Visually this is just such a treat.  The costumes are wonderful..I loved Garbo's (politically incorrect) full length fur coats.

Usually I have to make mental ""allowances"" for these old films to compensate for stilted acting and unsophisticated scripts, but this was totally not needed for Grand Hotel.  Totally classy, totally enjoyable!",1200960000,3,1451,5.033613445378151
842582,4,6304308469,"This film doesn't seem that remarkable by today's standards, but in 1932 it was quite innovative. MGM used an all-star cast in a bracelet of intertwining stories that involved them all. The ballerina (Garbo) misses Russia, feels life is empty and pointless, and is saved from killing herself by the Baron (John Barrymore) who had been planning to steal her jewels to pay a large debt to some shady people that he owes. The stenographer (Joan Crawford) has set her sights on the Baron believing him to be rich, while she is being eyed by her employer, a wealthy industrialist (Wallace Beery) who is the former employer of a dying man (Lionel Barrymore) who intends to spend his life savings experiencing what he has been missing out on all these years, who in turn is befriended by the Baron. The only character who exists in isolation is Garbo's, who has a relationship with the Baron but noone else.

This is the only film to ever win the Best Picture Oscar and be nominated for no other awards. This is not because the picture is a poor one. Instead it is probably because there are so many subplots and so many players that it is hard to zero in on any one of them and say a particular link in the chain is outstanding compared to the others and therefore deserves an award. However, altogether, the actors and subplots form an entertaining film. Since this film was such a commercial success the entire formula was reused in ""Dinner at Eight"" the following year, and even used part of the cast from this film - John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, and Wallace Beery. Oddly enough that film was superior to ""Grand Hotel"" in many ways, but didn't receive any Oscar nominations.

Finally, much has been said about Greta Garbo's over-the-top performance in this one. I have to admit, if this was my introduction to Garbo I would be asking myself what is the big deal about her supposed great reputation. She's practically playing Ophelia at certain points in the film. However, if you think about it, Garbo's portrayal is an appropriate one considering her character's circumstances. She was a ballerina in Czarist Russia who has the world ripped out from underneath her as a result of the Russian Revolution. Now, late in her career, she is surrounded by sycophants and isn't even missed when she runs out on a performance. The little documentary that comes with the DVD does a good job of explaining more about Garbo and her performance. There's no commentary track on this DVD. Instead there is a comedy short that parodies ""Grand Hotel"" plus some theatrical trailers and movietone extras talking about the premiere of Grand Hotel in addition to the mini-documentary I already mentioned.

This latest release is being done for the sake of repackaging the last release. If you have the previous release and you are happy with the packaging, there is no reason to buy this one too.",1198800000,3,2879,4.731075697211155
842583,5,6304308469,"It is already a moving experience to see a 1932 movie with sound in black and white and added to that, the storyline is so rich in context, that  complex and interacting characters for actors and actresses (5 together) are compelling but yet, simply put.

Reflections of life in the Grand Hotel, there are many graphical implications (roulette hotel door), great conversations (the bookeeper and his boss), starry stage (elevators and hotel rooms) and exquisite costume (the ballet dancer and baron). This is a real classic movie for everyone who loves movie as its very own nature.

Greta Garbo is somewhat outshined by Joan Crawford but still she emanates a sense of untounchable and distant aura.  There are many to be told both in this movie and for this movie.  I am not goint to the academics and details.  Just buy this movie and have a go and you'll know how movie is a form of art.",1198627200,2,890,4.6369426751592355

All the guests at this posh Berlin hotel come and go with their own problems. Some suffer through heartache and some go through scandal and others suffer fools gladly. There really isn't a common storyline or a thread that keeps them all together, except for the fact that they are all at the Grand Hotel! So, as you probably know ""Grand Hotel"" has already been released on DVD (and VHS.) But the newest incarnation of this 115 minute black and white M-G-M classic is the first and only special edition which promises to be a fan-favorite! Greta Garbo and Joan Crawford!! It can't get any better than that...!!!

You know, I really wish Warner Home Video would release the DVD cover for this film. After all, Joan was the most photogenic (not to mention photographed) movie star of the Golden Age. This extraordinarily beautiful lady deserves to have her photo shown. And in ""Grand Hotel"" Joan looks devastatingly beautiful. Joan was always a knockout, but in this picture she was such a hot mama. I added some photos at this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/link/dp/B0009S4IKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">link </a>for you, which includes a rare doctored picture of Joan and Greta Garbo (who absolutely refused to be in any publicity photos with Joan!!)

""Grand Hotel"" had its world-premiere on April 12, 1932 which caused a huge sensation. At the time of its production, there had never been an ""all-star cast."" ""Grand Hotel"" absolutely changed the way movies were made! This movie had a ton of first-rate stars! Joan played Flaemmchen, the sexy little stenographer! And this was one of the very few movies that Joan made for M-G-M where she did not take first billing! In fact, she didn't even take second billing; she came in third, after John Barrymore (Baron Felix von Geigern!) The true star of this picture wasn't Miss Crawford (although she managed to steal the show,) but it was the one and only Greta Garbo (as Grusinskaya, the dancer.) If Joan was the most powerful lady in Hollywood, then Greta Garbo was the most powerful woman in the world! Ms. Garbo had the balls to call all the shots while she beat the good ole boys at their own game! Also included in this classic film are: Wallace Beery (Preysing,) Lionel Barrymore (Otto Kringelein,) and Lewis Stone (Dr. Otternschlag!)

Why is ""Grand Hotel"" so perfect? Well, for a variety of reasons... All of the performances are so first-rate; everyone was completely supreme! When Grusinskaya looked so happy (after she fell in love) you could see that this ice-princess' cold heart (did she have even have a heart?) was actually beginning to melt! And when Joan, as the little stenographer flirted with all the men that she came into contact with, you believed her because this was the kind of girl that your mother always warned you about. Besides the first-class acting, the cinematography  was beautiful. Not since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metropolis/dp/B00007L4MJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metropolis </a>&nbsp;has there been such a stunning art deco picture!

In 1932 Joan was just banging 'em out left and right! Besides ""Grand Hotel,"" she also had two other classic film debuts! You might remember, that she also had the perennial favorite, ""Letty Lynton,"" which overtime has become a huge favorite among Joan's fans. And, her third film of the year was United Artists'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rain/dp/B00011D1MC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rain</a>. Of course you know that Joan never forgave herself for making that movie because it was a huge flop. But again, over time this picture has earned a huge cult-following. More than a quarter of a century later, when asked about these three films Joan said, ""Still, two out of three isn't bad."" As far as I'm concerned Joan never had anything to be ashamed of! And, I dare say that Miss Crawford pitched a perfect game with three out of three masterful movies in '32!

2008 will surely be just as much Joan's year, just as '32 was! I am so elated because besides the new ""Grand Hotel"" DVD, there's also a lot more coming out. Joan has her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/second-boxed-set/dp/B000XNZ7NO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">second boxed set </a>that will be out on February 12.

And the paperback edition of ""Hollywood Martyr"" will also be out in Feb., too.

842585,4,6304308469,"Grand Hotel was a pretty revolutionary concept in 1932. A film of seemingly unrelated multiple plotlines in which all or most of the main characters are played by established movie stars is nothing new to today's audience, but in 1932 it was groundbreaking and resulted in critical and commercial success, as well as an Academy Award for Best Picture - the only category it was nominated in.

The film is not just pushed by the sheer star power of its cast, possibly the greatest ever assembled on film, but the grand soap opera plot of love, deceit, sex, and murder makes it a classic with great rewatachability.

Warner Bros. has assembled a nice DVD edition of the film. The transfer has very little in the way of digital artifacting, but the source quality is not as clean and pristine as that of many films Warner Bros. has put onto DVD. There's minor warping at one point in the film, and the print is a bit grainier than one would desire. However, this is still quite possibly the best the film has ever looked or sounded, so I have no major complaints.

The DVD boasts a nice selection of bonus materials. A short 10-minute making-of documentary never really goes too in-depth, but still provides a nice glimpse of the making of the film. There's trailers for Grand Hotel and its remake, Weekend At The Waldorf, plus the short film Nothing Ever Happens, which was a parody of Grand Hotel. But the nicest bonus is the premiere footage. There's also a theater announcement for the film at Grauman's Chinese Theater.

To sum everything up, this DVD edition of Grand Hotel is about as good as it gets. I recommend this film for fans of classic cinema and fans of the cast. The print quality leaves a bit to be desired, but it still looks pretty good and a nice handful of bonus materials provide great entertainment value as well.",1193184000,2,1834,4.599388379204893

Just like Latin, history seems to have become a ""dead language"", interesting only to hopeless reactionaries. Director  Goulding had none of the color, sight tricks, or background music available in 2007, but the character of the story and man's weaknesses and prejudices will always be topical.

842587,5,6304308469,"I have a particular affinity for films from the pre-code era, and ""Grand Hotel"" is by far my favorite of this genre.  After numerous viewings, I began to understand this wonderful film as a portrayal of the tremendous struggle life must have been for Germans of the Weimar period, even for the entrepreneurial and aristocratic classes, especially in this critical year before power was handed over to Hitler.  In this movie, everyone is broke except the mousy little clerk played by Lionel Barrymore, and every character is trying in his or her own way to achieve or hold on to the dream-world lifestyle they remembered from the days before the Great War.  The hotel decor is very trendy (the bar seats its patrons practically above the heads of standees) and the rooms are large, plush and satiny.

The high point of ""Grand Hotel"", for me, is the central love scene between John Barrymore and Greta Garbo, which is probably the most gorgeous ever filmed -- enchanted, poignant and steeped in doom.  The actors were also demonstrably attracted to each other, adding depth and authenticity.

I have to disagree with another reviewer here:  I find John Barrymore's performance quite restrained, even staid at times, and Garbo's very mannered (and -- listen carefully -- she says ""I ouant to be alone"", not ""I vant..."").  Barrymore did plenty of ""over the top"" performances, but this isn't one of them.  Compare ""Twentieth Century"", ""Midnight"", or his last film, ""Playmates"".  (Actually, ""Playmates"", an embarrassing stinker made the year before his death, is valuable for an amazing 30-second jewel in its center -- a tearful impromptu rendering of as much of the Hamlet ""To Be"" soliloquy as the poor man can remember, in which he seems to grieve the own slings and arrows of his own life and to beg for release.)

Lionel is absolutely priceless, as skillful a comic actor as he is a dramatic one (it is said that comedy is much more difficult).  Young Joan Crawford is breezy and delightful, with no evidence of the harridan she was to become later in her career.  Wallace Beery is, as expected, wonderfully gross and heavy-handed, but the director forgot to tell him to lose the thick accent, since his character is supposed to be a native German speaker like everyone else (except, perhaps, Jean Hersholt's).

People say that this movie is dated.  Of course it is!  So are ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Casablanca"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"".  Every movie, even a classic, carries the style and ambience -- as well as the limited technology -- of the era in which it was made.  A film's date should not be a criticism but an invitation to a treat for latter-day viewers:  time-travel into a universe their own older loved ones may have inhabited.",1188604800,21,2739,4.814102564102564
842588,4,6304308469,"With so many excellent and comprehensive reviews posted on Amazon, the details of this film are well recorded. Yes, the print is good, but not excellent; yes, the acting is dated, Garbo is miscast and Crawford is attractive and dynamic with a warmth and empathy far removed from the outrageous character she became; yes, John Barrymore has a great rapport with Garbo; yes, the decor is an art deco feast; yes, the film falls somewhere between German dourness and American glitter etc etc.

But what of the extras available with the DVD?  Well, first there is a succint documentary about the film which neatly summarises its importance in 1932, the very first all star extravaganza from the plush MGM.  Next, there is a newsreel about the opening of the film which provides a rare glimpse of the personas of some famous stars, among others a nervous Joan Crawford, accompanied by her then husband Douglas Fairbanks Jnr, the pretentious Norma Shearer and Louis B Mayer, head of MGM and not missing an opportunity to market his studio product.

There is also a Vitaphone short ""Nothing ever Happens"" which parodies the film because sure enough, nothing happens. The highlight is the precision chorus which perform some very fast tap dancing and high kicks, probably just like the Rockettes at the Radio City Music Hall - wow!

The extras also include the original trailer for the film and ""Weekend at the Waldorf"", the plastic remake from the mid forties. This, in particular, emphasises the star power and film making expertise of the original.  There is absolutely no contest between Garbo, Crawford and the Barrymores versus Ginger Rogers, Lana Turner, Van Johnson and Zavier Cugat etc. It is a measure of how MGM had slipped.

The DVD is OK value but better if purchased as part of a Garbo Collection.",1185148800,,1802,4.869281045751634
842669,4,6304308469,"This film doesn't seem that remarkable by today's standards, but in 1932 it was quite innovative. MGM used an all-star cast in a bracelet of intertwining stories that involved them all. The ballerina (Garbo) misses Russia, feels life is empty and pointless, and is saved from killing herself by the Baron (John Barrymore) who had been planning to steal her jewels to pay a large debt to some shady people that he owes. The stenographer (Joan Crawford) has set her sights on the Baron believing him to be rich, while she is being eyed by her employer, a wealthy industrialist (Wallace Beery) who is the former employer of a dying man (Lionel Barrymore) who intends to spend his life savings experiencing what he has been missing out on all these years, who in turn is befriended by the Baron. The only character who exists in isolation is Garbo's, who has a relationship with the Baron but noone else.

This is the only film to ever win the Best Picture Oscar and be nominated for no other awards. This is not because the picture is a poor one. Instead it is probably because there are so many subplots and so many players that it is hard to zero in on any one of them and say a particular link in the chain is outstanding compared to the others and therefore deserves an award. However, altogether, the actors and subplots form an entertaining film.  Since this film was such a commercial success the entire formula was reused in ""Dinner at Eight"" the following year, and even used part of the cast from this film - John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, and Wallace Beery.

842672,4,6304308469,"Published in 1921, Vicki Baum's German-language novel MENSCHEN IM HOTEL was an international bestseller.  MGM purchased the rights and employed William A. Drake to adapt the novel to the stage.  Titled GRAND HOTEL, it proved a great success on the Broadway stage, and with its fame as both novel and play the studio made the property the focus of its powerful array of contract talent.  It was smash with both critics and audiences and won the Academy Award as Best Picture of 1932.

Although the 1930s was notable for social dramas, audiences of the Great Depression wanted an escape from the hardship of their lives, and no expense was spared to create the glittering and very high-gloss image moviegoers craved.  Designed by legendary art director Cedric Gibbons, who mixed Deco and Moderne styles to tremendous effect, each set was built specifically for the film and no detail was overlooked; Adrian's costumes were also meticulous in their combination of high-fashion and romance.  No detail was overlooked, and in terms of production values alone few films before or after have bested GRAND HOTEL.

But if GRAND HOTEL is distinctly of its era in terms of visual style, it is also distinctly of its era in terms of performance, and it is here that we run into a bit of trouble.  Most actors of the silent era relied on a mannered performance style that compensated for the lack of sound.  The arrival of sound forced them to invent a new performance style, and some proved more adaptable than others.  In many respects, GRAND HOTEL is a study of the struggle to invent this new way of acting; some of the performers are excessively large, some are in transition between silent and sound modes, and some are distinctly modern in their approach.

In terms of story, GRAND HOTEL presents several overlapping and interweaving plotlines.  Celebrated ballerina Grusinskaya (Garbo) is performing in Berlin--and is a deep depression that threatens her career.  Baron von Geigern (John Barrymore) is in desperate need of money--and has agreed to steal Grusinskaya's famous pearls.  When Grusinskaya's suicide attempt collides with the Baron's intended theft, romance is result.  At the same time, industrialist Preysing (Wallace Beery) has arrived at the hotel in an effort to conclude a important business deal and has hired a stenographer named Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford) to assist him--but Preysing is unaware that company accountant Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) has been diagnoised with a terminal illness and has taken rooms at the hotel, determined to enjoy himself before he dies.  These characters, along with Grusinskaya's maid (Rafaela Ottiano), the hotel doctor (Lewis Stone), and various hotel employees (including Jean Hersholt) collide repeatedly over the course of a few days--and none will emerge entirely unscathed from their encounters.

John Barrymore was noted for his larger-than-life performances on the stage, and he brought that same quality to many silent films; less fortunately, he also carried into the sound era, and his performance reads as excessively large.  Although Garbo was a great star in the silent era, she quickly adapted to the new demands of sound in such films as ANNA CHRISTIE--but when faced with Barrymore's over-the-top performance she responds in kind, and the result is visually beautifully but incredibly mannered, and their scenes are not greatly aided by their dialogue, which is itself very much in ""the grand manner.""  Although they are indeed fascinating, their performances are distinctly out of synch with the rest of the film, where a more natural style of acting is the norm.

While Wallace Beery and Lewis Stone are quite good, and while Lionel Barrymore is unexpectedly effective (and much less mannered than his brother John), it is really Joan Crawford that points the way toward the new acting style.  Crawford herself had worked in silents, and scored notable successes in such films as OUR DANCING DAUGHTERS, but she has made an easy leap to the sound era and never overplays her hand; Flaemmchen is among the best of her early performances, and Crawford herself thought it among the best of her overall career.  She wasn't wrong.

With the acting styles all over the map, GRAND HOTEL requires a modern viewer to make constant mental shifts; consequently, the film sometimes feels more than a little uphill.  Even so, there are plenty of compensations: Garbo at the height of her beauty; Lionel Barrymore's multi-layered performance; a Crawford classic; and always, always the lush look and feel of the movie.  Although I think it will most appeal to film buffs, there is no denying the thing has power, even though that power has become somewhat obscured by the passing years.

Both print and sound are excellent, and although there are only a few bonuses--and very short ones at that--the ""making of"" documentary is excellent and the footage of the premiere is nothing short of fascinating.  Recommended for film buffs, especially those strong on 1930s film.

842673,5,6304308469,"Suggested by Vicki Baum's book ""Menschem im Hotel"" and the Broadway play by William A. Drake, GRAND HOTEL remains to this day one of M-G-M's most delightful and lavish films.  With a hand-picked cast from it's peerless roster of stars and top direction from Edmund Goulding, the film still casts a powerful spell today.

The setting is Berlin's Grand Hotel in the 1930s.  Staying at the luxurious hotel is penniless Baron von Guigern (John Barrymore), ruthless magnate General Preysing (Wallace Beery), ambitious stenographer Miss Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford), fragile prima ballerina Grusinskaya (Greta Garbo) and Otto Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) a dying man on his last fling.  It's fascinating to watch these characters and their stories merge and intertwine.

The performances are sublime.  Garbo is perfect for the remote and disillusioned Grusinskaya, suddenly woken back to life when she falls in love with the Baron.  Lionel Barrymore is heartbreaking as gentle Otto.  Joan Crawford is a hoot as the stenographer with Hollywood dreams and a shady past.  The chemistry between Garbo and John Barrymore fairly crackles and their scenes together are some of the best in the entire picture.

It's here that Garbo first uttered those five little words which would define her for the rest of her life - ""I want to be alone"".  The cast also includes Lewis Stone as the Doctor and Jean Hersholt as the desk-clerk.

The DVD contains some great bonuses like a new Making-of documentary, footage from the lavish premiere and a rare Vitaphone musical short ""Nothing Ever Happens"" which is an hilarious parody of GRAND HOTEL.",1128297600,3,1620,5.164750957854406
842674,4,6304308469,"What can one say? The acting is terrible, the script a bomb - yet it's one of the best of the old Hollywood ""star"" vehicles, and the predecessor of a thousand immitations. Garbo is the dancer who has ""never been so tired"" in her life; John Barrymore the good-hearted baron desperate for money who falls in love with her; Lionel Barrymore the dying man splurging on his last go-round; Joan Crawford the stenographer and worldly woman; and Wallace Beery the industrial magnate. Their lives intermingle for one day and night at the Grand Hotel in Berlin, with tragic results for Garbo, John Barrymore, and Beery, and reprieve for Lionel Barrymore and Crawford.

The acting (especially Garbo) is so heavy-handed and stiff it's almost a parody of itself, although the lines the actors are forced to speak don't help much. Movie acting, now that sound had been added, hadn't gained the naturalness (unstageyness) yet that would come shortly, and in that regard it's extremely old-fashioned. Beery in his oily role is the most interesting to watch, with Lionel Barrymore a close second. Garbo, though she can be vibrant, even electrifying in her expressions of love and happiness for John Barrymore, would fare much better in later movies. Without a doubt it's a very influential picture, but it's a plush, old dinosaur.",1127692800,8,1313,4.968181818181818
842675,5,6304308469,"Great movies and great stars remain ageless and immortal.  Edmund Goulding's GRAND HOTEL (1932, MGM) won a deserved Best Picture Oscar 72 years ago, yet remains fresh and dramatic.  This Grand Hotel is in Berlin between the world wars, and its fine cast is full of glittering names that a modern audience should become acquainted with.  We have Greta Garbo as a world-weary ballerina.  John Barrymore is a jewel thief who sneaks into her hotel room to rob her of jewels to pay off a gambling debt.  But he falls in love with her when she is about to attempt suicide.  John's brother Lionel is a hyperactive bookkeeper convinced he is in awful health.  His boss, Wallace Beery, is in the hotel for a big business merger.  Helping him is a very young and charming Joan Crawford as an American stenographer.  Jean Hersholt is a hotel porter.  And Lewis Stone, later Judge Hardy on the ANDY HARDY series, is the hotel doctor.

There is no real plot here.  Instead, we have engrossing character interaction with some of the finest actors of the era.  They make GRAND HOTEL a wonderfully entertaining and archetypal drama.  Is Lionel Barrymore dying?  What happens to him when he runs into boss Beery at the hotel bar?  Will John Barrymore really steal Garbo's jewels, even as he falls in love with her?  What happens to him with his criminal bosses if he cannot pay off gambling debts?  He steals money from poor Lionel during a gambling game, but shortly returns it when he gets a guilty conscience.  What happens when he breaks into Beery's room?  What happens to Beery's merger?  Hersholt's wife gives birth to a baby; we see his excitement in a phone call.  And through it all, Stone wanders through the lobby muttering, ""Grand Hotel.  People coming and going, and nothing ever happens..""  Ah, but everything happens if you know where to look in this gorgeous hotel.  Everyone has an interesting story to tell in GRAND HOTEL, which inaugurated the ""all-star drama in a confined setting"" type of movie that is still in vogue with airplanes.

842759,4,6304308469,"Lets face it, ""Grand Hotel"" is essentially a soap opera, albeit an entertaining one, with ornate trappings.  What distinguishes this film from the mundane is it's incredible cast(Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery) who breathe life into otherwise ordinary material.  I would recommend this film to anyone who want to see these screen legends in an ensemble setting.  That said, a better film of this type is ""Dinner at Eight"".  Not only does that film include the Barrymores and Beery but also a simply dazzling Jean Harlowe performance.",1114819200,,578,5.25
842760,5,6304308469,"I absolutely adore this movie! The cast is exceptional.

I instantly fell in love with Joan Crawford; I liked that she was beautiful, witty, and yet coyly aware of living outside the box. Her clothes were beautiful and complimented the art deco hotel. I really wish she would have stuck with the thin eyebrows; she was so much prettier in the 30s.

I also fell in love with Lionel Barrymore who I have never seen in a film since that topped his performance as Kringelein. It was so easy to feel sorry for him, to love him, and to want to take care of him. He was wonderful and I really feel like the story is almost about him, not everyone together. He was sort of tied to everyone except Grusinskaya.

Wally Beery was good as Preysing. I don't believe he was so dislikable as he thought the character to be. His scenes are actually somewhat boring. I can sympathize with Preysing though. I heard he was the only character allowed to have a German accent which was a stipulation to getting him to stay on the project.

I hated Greta Garbo and her over-acting in the film. As a ballerina, she was somewhat believable because she was so tall, but she DID look awkward in the dress. I think that a lot of the reason why her scenes seemed so dramatic and overly played was because of the way the film was edited. There are scenes of her that begin with her violently spinning around and blurting out a dramatic line. She also cradles the phone and talks to it. And what kills me is the way she constantly furrows her forehead and those eyebrows! Egad!

I read the book by Vikki Baum, the translation into English of course, and I really think that it is a great novel that was adapted well but stands on its own. There are so many pieces of it that cannot be translated into film. I think that maybe Garbo knowing the motives behind her character had a right to overact but because the audience did not know her thoughts did not understand her portrayal of Grusinkaya.

I thought that John Barrymore was good enough was the Baron von Geigern although the character itself does not stand out much. It was cool to see that brothers played in the same film together.

It seems crazy to me now that Garbo and Crawford were so childish about each other but stories about their fights make me laugh. Supposedly, Garbo hated Marlene Dietrich and tardiness about the same amount so Crawford came late to the set just to bug Garbo (which I find somewhat hard to believe because Crawford was so efficient about everything) and she also played Dietrich records loudly. The pranks they played on each other just make me laugh horribly. They were like junior high school kids.

I do like that so many big name stars were cast together to create sort of a phenomenon. I don't like the way the system is used today because it is like people who are not famous cannot get good roles, but back then, it sort of refreshed the screen to occasionally see a film that featured many stars. The only other film I can really think of besides Grand Hotel that is noted for using this is Dinner at Eight which is sort of the answer to the success of Grand Hotel.

The DVD is awesome; it included footage of stars attending the premiere. For an older film, any extra features are exciting. The DVD also includes a parody of the movie which was well made.",1109808000,2,3323,4.416666666666667
842761,2,6304308469,"I've seen this movie several times, and have always hated it. I don't know why - I love old movies, but I find this one impossible. Garbo is simply bad - incredible histrionics and inexplicable gyrations and shakes of the shoulders which I'm sure were meant to demonstrate her character as a ballerina, but which look only odd to the modern viewer. The whole film is stilted and shallow. The only other ""classic film"" I've ever come away from feeling shafted by was ""Mrs. Miniver"" for, I think, similar reasons. I think the modern viewer is simply incapable of viewing these movies in the spirit in which they were intended.",1107043200,8,624,4.681818181818182

Grand Hotel, like, say ""Dances With Wolves"" has that scope. Grand Hotel, like ""Chinatown,"" has that thick plot. Grand Hotel, like ""L.A. Confidential,"" has those charming characters. It's a rare experience to see something done by people who care about making a good product. That's the 15%. The others make ""Gigli.""

This ensemble piece as all kinds of different stories going on, weaved together at the end with a common frame. The Barrymores are standouts as two unlikely friends: one a Baron/cat burlar who's down on his luck and the other, an older fellow with  terminal health who is spending his last dime in the pursuit of fun before he dies. Wallace Beery plays an arrogant, self-centered tycoon who will burn anyone to keep his business afloat. Joan Crawford is his secretary. She's a nice girl who feels that she must occasionally sacrifice her dignity to survive. Rounding out the stellar cast is Greta Garbo, a famous dancer with serious self-esteem issues.

You really can't get much better than this for the 1930's. And it seems to be over before you know it.",1094169600,3,1216,4.831730769230769
842765,4,6304308469,"[updated 2009. The VCR edition mentioned below is well out-dated by now. That tape was played on the kind of premium VCR not available today. Obviously the DVD plays far better on today's gear than an aging tape played on the kind of tin-can Walmart Wonder that is laughingly sold as a ""VCR"". So I must upgrade my original 3-star rating to 4 stars, considering how times have changed.] The extra features on this DVD edition are highly desirable -- get the DVD for the features, but get a recent (still factory-sealed) VHS tape for a better print.  The DVD release is so grainy it's fuzzy and often seems out-of-focus. Contrast is murky in many scenes.  In one specific scene: when Joan Crawford enters a dark room and discovers Beery standing over the baron's corpse; the grim heaviness of the textures and depth of shadows, the stark horror on Crawford's face -- these are lost in the fuzzy grain of the DVD but are clearly preserved on VHS.  Having seen this film many times on the big screen and on tape, it appears that the DVD seriously lacks the smooth, almost lush visual quality of earlier issues.  This is also one of those old-line films that looks gorgeous on a big theater screen but suffers dramatically on smaller devices. Despite the shortcomings of the DVD, this is still the grande ol' Grand Hotel of yore, a relic (but a magnificent one) of late Victorian melodrama. And dig Rachmaninoff in the background during Garbo's scenes! But I'd still advise the VHS tape if you want the rich graphics of the original.  It also appears that the master for this transfer, whatever its source, has visible physical defects that I don't see on earlier tapes.  The 2-channel DVD sound is not representative of the weighty mono original, has a clearly audible hiss and too much treble.  The sexy undertone of Garbo's voice is missing here, as is J. Barrymore's dramatic baritone (Compare scene 8 on the DVD when John Barrymore mutters ""I don't like your tone"", with the VHS version -- audibly, the sound of that line on the tape is more darkly effective).  The look and sound of the DVD fail to convey the unique, all-important ""deco"" qualities that somehow add so much to the original film's overall effect.  I'd suggest that the VHS edition is something most classic movie fans will appreciate more than they would the DVD.  An aside: originally, Garbo didn't want to share star honors with Crawford out of fear that Crawford would diminish Garbo's role.  Garbo was partially correct: Crawford steals the show. But Garbo is still a sight to behold.",1083110400,,2555,4.719101123595506
842766,5,6304308469,"Finally on DVD, Grand Hotel is an early talkie classic that deserves all the praise it has received over the (many) years. The film offers some truly great performances, production quality, and a gripping story about the various people who stay at the Grand Hotel and how their particular lives intertwine.  There is Garbo as a ""disillusioned ballerina,"" who is particularly meloncholic and manic. She goes from low to high and then low again quite fast, you may wonder if she is schizoprenic. Then again, there are some devastating closeups to put all detractors to rest.
As for Joan Crawford, all that needs to be said is that she is timeless as the ambitious stenographer (with, as it turns out at the end, a good heart).  She offers the only performance in the film that would fit right in with modern audiences.  There isn't a hint of the archaic silent style that other actors of the time were holding on to, and her style and appearance come across as very contemporary and likeable.
John and Lionel Barrymore are also terrific as two good-hearted people who are facing bad times. One has no luck and resorts to theft and the other has the first good luck in his life, even as he is dying. Wally Beery is also memorable as the rather careless boss.
Best thing about this DVD?  I'd have to say the excellent picture quality of this legendary film, the legendary performances it contains, and the very special 1932 film premiere clip of Grand Hotel (on the extra features section).  There we can see Joan in her prime, and apparently as shy and full of humility as most of her detractors would never guess she possessed.",1077494400,3,1625,4.648083623693379
842767,5,6304308469,"The Best Picture of 1931-2 ""Grand Hotel"" deserved it's Oscar and deserves it's place in history as a forerunner of star-studded films to come.

But the film stands on it's own as well and is smoothly done considering the intertwining stories of various people whose paths (and fates) cross in that posh Berlin establishment. Greta Garbo as a depressed ballerina is one reason to see this but there's John and Lionel Barrymore in great roles, Joan Crawford as an ambitious stenographer with moral issues, Wallace Beery and other recognizable actors in character roles. Warner Bros. has done a good job with the DVD print so this is definitely a collector's item. There are some amazing interior shots inside the hotel with a wonderful art deco look to them.

From the highly lit art deco sets of Cedric Gibbons to the wonderfully stylized performances elicited from the magical cast by British director, Edmund Goulding. Those meticulous close-ups of Garbo and Joan Crawford took hours and hours to light and film. You can watch the physical beauty of John Barrymore, just before he slid into acute alcoholism. The music, those great limousines, the sets, the make-up, MGM's superb array of character actors (dig Rafaella Ottiano as Garbo's long-suffering maid), help contribute to the powerful ambiance of Hollywood in l931.

A beautiful reclusive Ballerina (Greta Garbo) finds love too late. A short tempered Millionaire (Wallace Beery) finds himself in a scandal.

There's the high strung, tempermental ballerina (Greta Garbo), the sassy vamp-like stenographer (Joan Crawford), the boorish industrialist (Wallace Beery), the stricken labourer (Lionel Barrymore)and the devilishly handsome baron (John Barrymore). These seemingly separate lives cross over - some happily so, others with tragic circumstances - all thoroughly absorbing and brilliantly performed. At the time of its release ""Grand Hotel"" was the first movie to feature more than one star above the title credits.
TRANSFER: After years of looking as though the camera negative had been fed through a meat grinder, this DVD digital remastering is a considerable improvement. Having said that, a lot of work is still needed to get this one looking up to par. Solid blacks are about the best thing on this DVD. Contrast levels appear too low in many of the scenes. There are a considerable number of age related artifacts and quite a bit of film grain present on this 70 plus year old classic. The audio has been extensively cleaned up but continues to exhibit considerable hiss. Truly, if this is a special edition it's one of the poorest I've seen.
EXTRAS: Some featurettes that round out the history - if too briefly, of this classic film.

842852,3,6304308469,"This is probably unfair to say, because the book ""Grand Hotel"" was based on has been out of print for decades and is incredibly hard to find, but this blockbuster Oscar-winning classic film is NOTHING compared to Vicki Baum's 1930 original German novel, ""People in a Hotel"". I happened across the book in a dusty corner of a dusty used bookstore purely on a lark, never having seen the film, and didn't stop reading until the last page. It was one of the most moving, beautifully-written novels I've ever read; Vicki Baum's grasp of human nature, from bellhops to barons, is astonishing, and the writing (with assist from translator Basil Creighton) is heartbreaking and thrilling. Just check out this little passage. Grusinskaya (played by Greta Garbo in the movie), the aging, despondent fading-star ballerina, has just finished a dance:
""Curtain and applause. There was even fairly vigorous applause considering how empty the theater was and how few there were to clap. 'Encore?' asked Grusinskaya without stirring from her pose. 'No,' whispered Pimenov in a loud and desperate whisper from the wings. The applause was over. It was over. Grusinskaya still lay where she was for a few minutes like a flake of foam, just as she had died in her dance and with the dust of the stage on her hands and arms and temples. For the first time in her life there was no encore for this dance. I can do no more, she thought. No, I have done enough. I can do no more.""
Unfortunately this heartbreaking scene wasn't in the movie; it gave volumes of explanation as to why Grusinskaya was suicidal, so without it, Garbo just comes off as a melodramatic nutjob. There are many such scenes from the book that were chopped up or cut out altogether that would have added so much, and without them the film just jumps from plotpoint to plotpoint with little rhyme or reason. I know that 90% of any book has to go when being translated from book to movie---and I know that Vicki Baum herself wrote the screenplay, so it was hardly a hack job---but it just seems that so much beauty was packed into so little time that there was no way to really connect with these amazing characters. The acting was brilliant, of course (although why in hell ultra-American Wallace Beery had a German accent when nobody else did I have no idea), but it just left me sad and angered that this magnificent novel, now all but forgotten, leaves its only trace on the world with this watchable but hugely flawed movie. It could have been so much more. If you ever find the book, no matter what condition it's in, BUY IT.

Of course, the sharp viewer knows irony when he or she hears it, since the film then sets about to disprove his statement.  Burglar John Barrymore is at the centre of the action.  He's fallen in love with fading ballerina Greta Garbo, befriended dying office worker Lionel Barrymore who is at the hotel to live life before he dies, offended businessman Wallace Beery who is on the brink of financial ruin, and worked his considerable charm on stenographer Joan Crawford who has come to the hotel to work for Beery, but her job may go beyond typing.  Everyone is at a turning point in their entwined lives, and these moments are played out in various plot lines that link together beautifully.  Both Barrymores and Beery, along with Stone and Jean Hersholt give their customary excellent performances.  There are two surprises in the film:  Crawford and Garbo.  I haven't seen Crawford in a lot of films since she holds no appeal for me as an actress.  But in this film she lights up the screen with warmth, humour, energy, and real emotion.  Her phone scene with Lionel Barrymore is a great moment in the film.  Garbo, on the other hand, disappoints me in this film.  Apart from her famous moaning of vanting to be alone, she is excessively theatrical.  It's not easy to make a successful film with so many linked subplots, but Grand Hotel pulls it off with style, drama, fine acting, and humanity.  Nothing ever happens?

It's the story of five guests whose lives criss-cross for just a brief time....(1) an aging, suicidal Russian ballerina named Grusinskaya(Greta Garbo). (2) the noble, elegant, handsome Baron Felix von Geigern(John Barrymore), in reality, financially broke and a jewel thief. (3) an ambitious,young, lovely stenographer Flaemmchen(Joan Crawford) looking for fame and the good life. (4) the factory clerk Kringelein(Lionel Barrymore) out to live the good life one time before he dies. (5) General Preysing(Wallace Beery) a ruthless, cold-hearted industrialist. Drinking, gambling, and a love triangle, ""Grand Hotel"" was released at the height of the Depression. Based on Vicki Baum's novel and play, it earned 1 Million dollars for MGM, and became the most profitable movie of 1932. The first All-Star epic, Lewis Stone and Jean Hersholt round out the stellar cast. This is the finest of 5 films starring the Barrymore brothers, and is John Barrymore's perhaps final great performance. Just 10 years later, alcohol would create his sudden demise and biography in the famous book, ""Goodnight Sweet Prince"". Jean Harlow's elderly husband, Paul Bern, was the producer. He died in their Beverly Hills home during production in a scandalous suicide. AMC Cable channel touts a huge list of 1930's classics, but they're wrong. There's only a short list, and ""Grand Hotel""s near the top. Near the end of the film, the timid, dying factory clerk is suddenly enriched by luck in a gambling game.

He makes the acquaintance of a baron (his brother, John), acquires a girlfriend (Joan Crawford), and gets a chance to tell off his boss (Wallace Beery).  He achieves the dream that many people have, but never realize.  His acting throughout is honest and you find yourself cheering for him.
The casting of this movie shows absolute genius.  Garbo is beautiful and engimatic as Grusenskaya the dancer, John Barrymore is the suave but impovrished baron masquerading as a jewel thief, Joan Crawford as Flamchen never looked more beautiful (although she appears in yet another of her stenographer roles), and Wallace Beery comes off well as the ruthless businessman.  All of the personalities blend together to make this a memorable film.

Under Edmund Goulding's imaginitive direction, this actor's showcase presents a veritable microcosm of humanity. Barrymore is the sly, suave jewel theif whose love rejuventates the tired, world weary 27 year-old Garbo as the ballerina Grusinskaya. Crawford gives a lively and refreshing portrait as Flaemmchen the little stenographer with flexible morals; she's fun to watch since her acting style is miles away from that antiseptic zombie she played later in life. Beery is the tough industrialist who elicits Joan's services; and Lionel plays Otto, the lonely, dying old man who's determined to spend his last days in the lap of luxury. One may question why Wallace Beery is the only cast member who adapts a German accent whilst speaking; also, watch for the ridiculous little bobby pin keeping Garbo's hair in place during the lovemaking scenes with Barrymore! No matter. What the film lacks in credibility it more than makes up for in entertainment.

7867841,4,6304308469,"The film is fun to watch, although there is a lot of over-acting by Greta Garbo. It is a combination of tragedies and humor. The title is somewhat ironic because virtually all the many characters in the film are not living a grand life; most are poor and suffering from bad circumstances. In contrast, the hotel itself is grand and very expensive.
Greta Garbo is a failed ballerina who does not get large audiences to see her anymore. She is not as pretty in this film as she is in others, possibly to reflect her sad situation. She contemplates suicide and is saved by John Barrymore who acts well. He poses as a Baron who came to the hotel to steal Garbo's necklace and falls in love with her, and she with him.
The film is filled with several other stories. One is about a man who tells us that he is very honest and a faithful family man, yet when matters go bad for him in his business while he is at the hotel, he lies about a deal to cheat others, and he tries to seduce his stenographer, played very well by Joan Crawford.
My favorite actor in the film is Lionel Barrymore who plays a very sick man who has only a short time to live. He decides to live it up and drinks a lot. John Barrymore, feeling sorry for him, asks Joan Crawford, who wants to liaison with John, to dance with him. Lionel is enthralled, but the aforementioned business man, for whom he had worked and who fired him when he became sick, would not let him dance with Crawford whom he, the business man, wants to seduce.",1506470400,,1497,4.274647887323944
7867842,5,6304308469,"This transfer is the best I've seen. After reading the one star reviews out of curiosity, I'm amending my own review. The style of acting, influenced by then current limitations of the technology, is very different from today. This classic is a wonderful peek into the film culture of the era. If you enjoyed any of the Transformer movies, I doubt you'll appreciate this. But for those with a passion for the progression of film, this is a must, a rich tapestry of writing, acting and the sensibilities of the era, the 1920s and '30s. You won't find car chases, explosions or the like here. Just a simple story well told, full of truth about the life of the times.",1506297600,3,664,4.541666666666667
