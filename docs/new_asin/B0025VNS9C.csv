8351205,5,B0025VNS9C,"This is a very well done DVD that can interest young children without being so silly nothing is learned.  Awesome scenes throughout the DVD.

I have yet to be able to locate the rest of this wonderful series.  I am very glad I bought this one.  Getting this information to young children in a way they can understand is vital.  There are many wonderful DVD's showing this type of information to teens and adults but very few that are successful to our youth.",1340409600,3,458,4.469879518072289
