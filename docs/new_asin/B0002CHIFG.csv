Perhaps I am among the few Sons of the Desert members who prefer Laurel and Hardy films in their original glorious black and white.  While I enjoyed the color version, certain scenes are missing. If they are missing also in the B&W version, I will be disappointed and begin searching for the DVD from a different publisher with all scenes intact.  Amazon's description should disclose to buyers that certain scenes are missing--even the opening scene where an artist is painting a portrait of the Boys (and Stan says it's beautiful ""photography."")",1447459200,,602,4.9405940594059405

2076048,5,B0002CHIFG,"Network On Air has superior 35mm source material than VCI's Blu-ray.  While the image is the best I have seen, there is a black flicker in the night scenes that bothers me. I believe there are restoration programs that would even this out. This may be why VCI's Blu-ray crushed the blacks, a weak attempt to fix the flicker.  Even though this is a U.K. release, there is no ""PAL Speed-up"" (KINO's old DVD is sped up), the film is transferred at its original 24 frames per second.  The voices are in the correct pitch.  The Blu-ray encoding is also superior to VCI's MPEG2.

It is unlikely that Criterion would restore this, so I highly encourage everyone to buy the Network Blu-ray which is region coded ABC and will play in the U.S. (Sorry to say, but their DVD is PAL and will not play in the U.S.)

And there is new bonus material not on the VCI Blu-ray!

2076049,4,B0002CHIFG,"After decades of inferior public domain copies, Laurel and Hardy's ""The Flying Deuces"" emerges on Blu-ray in the best picture quality to date. Produced by Boris Morros and released by RKO in 1939, this Foreign Legion escapade (a partial remake of ""Beau Hunks"") remains a fast-paced romp with plenty of memorable routines and some charming musical interludes. A minor classic in Stan and Ollie's filmography  the only non-Roach production in which the team maintained a fair amount of creative control. Beautifully restored by Jonathan Wood and BBC Digital Media Services from an original 35mm print, with the RKO logo and titles fully intact.",1442275200,,642,5.233009708737864

2076061,5,B0002CHIFG,"Given the other recent Region A Blu-ray Release by VCI Entertainment, it seemed appropriate to do a bit of comparing.

THE FLYING DEUCES: Network On Air/VCI Entertainment Comparisons

Very simply, apart from the Running time on the Network version being inexplicably 20 seconds shorter than VCI's (I honestly haven't been able to pinpoint any missing footage, and could be merely due to counter irregularities?), the former IS visually superior (Apart from one scene's Fade-In, in which shadowing can be briefly seen on the left side of the Screen) , period! The VCI Blu-ray Visuals are very contrasty by comparison, though in my opinion, are still the second best that I've ever viewed of this Title. This should give the uninitiated some idea regarding THE FLYING DEUCES' rather spotty history on Home Video!

Insofar as the opening RKO Logo/Original Titles/Credits/Opening and Closing Music; these are identical on BOTH versions!

The White Colored Subtitles on the Network Blu-ray are more descriptive than VCI's Yellow Subtitles, and unlike the latter, include Music descriptors in addition to the spoken lines.

Regarding the 1951 German Version (DICK UND DOOF IN DER FREMDENLEGION) that's included in the Network Blu-ray/DVD Releases, the Artwork used is of a style that's very similar to the original 1939 illustrations, though they are actually a bit more detailed. Very nicely done! While unfortunately lacking English (Or any!) Subtitles, the voices for the boys' are in my opinion, rather pleasant, with the voice over for Mr. Hardy sounding quite similar to the original!

Why a Trailer for THE FLYING DEUCES wasn't included in either Release is anyone's guess! This would have been a nice Bonus Feature to have included.

The Final Verdict: My recommendation is to go with the Network On Air Blu-ray!",1438646400,,1814,5.213058419243986

2076075,4,B0002CHIFG,"When I was a kid I was browsing around a now defunct Woolworth store in my hometown.  While browsing I noticed a display containing VHS tapes at a cheap price.  One of the tapes was a movie I had never heard of titled ""The Flying Deuces"".  Despite never seeing the movie I was very interested because I was very familiar with the legendary team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy and was a very big fan.  I decided to buy a copy of the movie and it tuned out to be a very good decision.  I was very pleased to see the movie was not only available on DVD but that a colorized version was available.  I wasted no time in ordering a DVD.  While the quality of the DVD is excellent I was disappointed with the movie itself.  I will explain why later.

In the movie Stan and Ollie decide to take a break from their life in Des Moines, Iowa and take a trip to Paris (Where the movie is set.).  For lodgings they rent a room at a small inn where a young woman named Georgette works (She is the daughter of the owner.).  Ollie immediately develops a crush on her.  He sends her candy, flowers and even a picture of himself (Georgette thinks the gifts are Ollie's way of thanking her and her father for their hospitality and is oblivious to the fact that Ollie has romantic feelings for her.).  Ollie soon tells Stanley that he plans to ask for her hand in marriage.  However his hopes are shattered when Georgette reveals that she is happily married.  Ollie becomes so distraught that he decides to commit suicide by drowning.  Just as he is about to do so a French Foreign Legion soldier named Francois (Who happens to be Georgette's husband.) happens by.  After hearing Ollie's story Francois says that suicide is not the answer.  What he should do instead is join the Foreign Legion.  Francois says that after just a few days in the Legion Ollie will forget all about his unhappy romance.  Stan and Ollie immediately enlist....and chaos ensues.

""The Flying Deuces"" is a lot of fun from start to finish.  I have seen the movie many times over the years and I laugh myself silly every time.  Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are (as always) excellent.  They are helped here by a strong supporting cast.  In addition to the very clever jokes there is also a well done performance of the song ""Shine on Harvest Moon"" by Stan and Ollie.  The final scene of the movie is just plain terrific.  A great way to end a very fun and entertaining movie.

The DVD is of very good quality.  You have the option of watching the movie in color or Black & White.  One of the reasons I bought this particular DVD is because it features the movie in color.  More often than not I prefer that because I think it adds to the quality of the movie.  Whatever your preference I think you will be satisfied.  I do have a small criticism of the sound.  It's a bit loud.  I found myself having to turn the volume control on the television down a little more than usual.  The sound quality is a problem, but it can easily be remedied as I mentioned.

Now for the reason I am a bit disappointed with this particular version of the movie.  I noticed as I watched the movie that there is approximately three to four minutes of footage that was included in my old VHS copy but not included on this DVD.  That is a shame because that excised footage contained some of the movie's best comic moments.  For example on my VHS copy the opening scene is of an artist drawing and portrait of Stan and Ollie.  The camera focuses on the completed portrait for a second or two before the artist gives it to Stan and Ollie.  For some reason in this DVD that footage is cut.  The audience never sees the portrait.  They just see it being handed off.  There is a sequence in Stan and Ollie's room at the inn where Stanley keeps bumping his head on an angled wall.  That scene is cut from this DVD.  Also as Stan and Ollie go to a river to commit suicide, a newspaper is shown with a headline that says ""Man Eating Shark Escapes!"".  The shark just happens to be roaming the waters where Stan and Ollie plan to end it all.  The shark actually added some laughs to the sequence I was very disappointed to see all scenes and references to the shark were not included on the DVD.  This is very strange.

While I am glad to finally have this excellent movie on such a good quality DVD I was disappointed to see so much missing from it.  Still, I believe ""The Flying Deuces"" is one of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's best and I do highly recommend you see it.  I think you will enjoy it, but sadly not as much as you should.",1421971200,,4559,4.289906103286385

2076078,2,B0002CHIFG,"I'll admit, the transfer is pretty good and it's cool to have the colorized version as well. However, once I got into the film a little ways I couldn't help but feel like there were some moments missing, the cuts were a little too hard and too sudden. As the film continued, I began to notice big chunks of this film missing, some of the funniest moments in my opinion. I watched this on ""Hal Roach Studios Presents"" VHS as a kid, watched it over and over. I only made it part of the way through this DVD because I was disappointed. I don't know why the VHS release which looked pretty good would have more footage than the DVD, but I can definitely vouch for the following bits:

1. Bits and pieces of dialog cut off too soon before cuts on numerous occasions.

2. When Stan and Ollie are upstairs Stanly runs into the wall several times before Ollie says, ""How anyone can be so stupid as to continuously bump there head, is beyond me. Mmm!"" In the DVD version, Stan bumps his head once and the rest of the scene is cut.

3. When Stan and Ollie are about to jump into the lake, there's a whole sequence missing where Stan sees his reflection in the water and thinks there's ""a fellow already in there looking back at us"", and then in another instance, Ollie is kneeling down with his butt near the edge of the water and a big fish of some sort floats by, Ollie feels and hears something and when we see the seat of his pants they are ripped.

I will finish watching this version of the film later, but either way, I am really disappointed at the exclusion of some of their funniest material in this story.",1415059200,,1606,4.2730263157894735

These two were total professionals;  it is my understanding that every scene was rehearsed for maximum effect in all of their skits, not the slapstick ""let's see if it works"" approach.

My favorite scene is when Hardy proposes to a beautiful woman whom he does not know is married (He's only known her for a couple of days). He is madly in love.  When she refuses him (kindly), he is totally heartbroken.  Sitting at the dinner table with him during the episode is Stan, who has encouraged him to propose.

2076110,4,B0002CHIFG,"If there is a better semi-slapstick feature made in 1939, someone let me know the title!

Backstory, to my knowledge, is that in the confusion of being without a contract, they signed with another company and assumed the screenplay would be fine. Stan, under pressure, rewrote it..and we have a very strong film. Good, tight comedy editing and the expected deft direction of A. Edward Sutherland, of course well-known as Director of W. C. Fields films, contribute to a fun experience. The soundtrack is a little overpowering at times...but who can complain when Ollie breaks into ""Shine On, Harvest Moon""?

The proceedings are slightly different than one might expect, as the characters sustain in the real world (save some wonderful musical sequences), and accordingly have a harder edge. Sad to realize that soon they were to be victims of the non-independent system, when they were not allowed to do any consequential rewriting and were always stuck in the, shall we say, non-surreal world. Everything had to make *sense*...and no time for elongated mime.

The boys find themsleves in Paris, and with all the ""April in Paris"" romantic trappings. Ollie is infatuated with the beautiful - but married - Jean Parker (an Inn Keeper), and when he learns she is married, he decides to end it all..until Gardiner convinces him that the Foreign Legion is the only way to forget.

For those of you yet to experience a Legend films DVD, let me tell you that colourising has moved on a very long way since the Turner jobs of the 1980s.  The range of colour is enormous and the clarity has to be seen to be believed.

For the purists among you, as I said at the beginning, you have the restored black and white print.

Looking at the total running time of the two versions, it works out 69 minutes each, which if I remember correctly would mean both versions are the complete, unedited versions - fingers crossed.

2076139,5,B0002CHIFG,"Well, it would seem that Amazon, in its infinite wisdom, included every review of this film all into one mixed bag with different versions of the VHS and indeed the CD represented here.  The version I am reviewing here is a Goodtimes Home Video Corp. release.  It is in VHS format with no extras.  The old RKO logo is included in the introductions.  This practice is a bit of a pity; a flaw that not only is true for restored movies, but with different editions of various books too.  But that being said....

Flying Deuces was released in 1939 and of course stars Stan laurel and Oliver Hardy.  Also included in the cast are Jean Parker, Reginald Gardiner, Charles Middleton and James Finalayson.  The movie is in black and white and the version I am reviewing here is of pretty good quality when all is said and done.

The plot of this offering is pretty well known so briefly stated; Ollie has fallen deeply in love with an Innkeeper's daughter while he and Stan are in Paris, apparently on vacation from their job in a fish market in Iowa.  As luck would have it, the girl, played wonderfully by Jean Parker, is already married which breaks Ollie's heart.  He decides to end it all through drowning himself in the Seine.  This ""drowning episode"" brings about one of the best routines in the movie which is funny, whimsical and sad at the same time.  He talks Stan into joining him in a watery death and their dialog is one that needs to be listened to quite closely.  As Ollie tells Stan of the difficulties of life without him, i.e. Ollie, he says to Stan ""people would stare at you and wonder what you are, and I wouldn't e here to tell them.""  This is thoughtful stuff folks and to be honest, sort of got to me.  Our two heroes are interrupted in their plans and instead join the French Foreign Legion in order for Ollie to forget.  There troubles truly begin at this point.

Now I fully agree with several other reviewers that this is not the best work these two turned out over the years.  I personally though watch each of these old movies as complete stand alones, and pretty well try to ignore work that has preceded the film I am watching and any that will appear later.  As a stand along film, I enjoyed this one tremendously.  Stan is a master at driving you completely nuts.  He is able to take a simple task and trough his repetitive attention to the most minor detail cause you to want to reach through the screen and complete the task for him.  This is rare art and a rare gift.  The physical aspect of their comedy is perfectly timed.

Of all the comedy teams that have been here and gone, these two are in my opinion one of the best, if not the best.  Even in some of their work that is not top notch, their timing is perfect and lets face it, in comedy timing is everything!  From facial expressions to misused words they have it completely nailed.  Their complete cluelessness is done so well that it actually seems quite natural and you forget that they are actually acting.  And what makes it even better is that some of the illogical conclusions that Stan often comes to actually sound and appear logical when he explains himself.  They are masters at breaking down complex problems and simplifying them to the point of absurdity, yet making them appear believable.

The supporting cast in this film, and in all of the L&H films, the rest of the cast is indeed always supporting, does a fine job.  Jean Parker is looking her best and is quite convincing in her part and Reginald Gardiner was simply made for his role in this film.

I have watched this film several times over the years (actually I saw it the first time not many years after its release), and really never tire of it.  I can certainly think of worse ways to spend around 70 minutes.

2076140,3,B0002CHIFG,"For Laurel & Hardy collectors, Kino's ""Restored Edition"" is a case of good news-bad news. Good news: this is the best-looking version of the film currently available on DVD. Bad news: it still requires some work in order to qualify as being ""fully"" restored, primarily when it comes to the opening and closing credits. I don't get it. Other copies of THE FLYING DEUCES (available from other distributors) have the original opening title and closing cast credits, so why weren't they part of this edition? Couldn't they have made a composite utilizing this footage? Why not put in some extra effort to make this the definitive version?

As a Laurel & Hardy comedy, THE FLYING DEUCES has very funny sequences, although diehard fans tend to overrate this one way out of proportion. It's routinely cited as the team's best non-Hal Roach feature. And yet I think later efforts such as THE BIG NOISE (1944) and THE BULLFIGHTERS (1945) are much funnier and truer to their style of comedy.

Rabid admirers who despise the L&H films made by 20 Century Fox during the 1940s often throw bouquets at THE FLYING DEUCES, despite the fact that DEUCES shares the same the flaws found in most of the Fox movies: sloppy scripting, erratic pacing, and inconsistent characterizations. Stan and Ollie are always a joy to watch, but this is merely a pleasant time-killer, ranking well below their greatest achievements. In his book THE FILMS OF LAUREL AND HARDY (Citadel Press, 1967), historian William K. Everson summed it up best: ""[THE FLYING DEUCES] just didn't jell and seemed to lack the old spontaneous camaraderie of the Roach films. Despite occasional good gags, it was mechanical stuff.""",1220227200,,1675,4.9361702127659575

In a world where a mass-produced urinal is the most significant work of art of the century, and a paint-spattered piece of canvas is worth $140 million, this masterpiece has to be recognized as one of the greatest and most dramatic works in movie history. The story is sheer magic: tragic, touching, wistful, it has a meaning all of its own. It is an eloquent, elegant summary of the human condition. Where are we heading? And why? Who is there to help and guide us? And how will the fish factory in Des Moines carry on without us? A boy, a girl, unrequited love: the old, old story.  Thank heaven there is always someone either less, or more, intelligent than ourselves, who either does, or doesn't, know the score. Who can remind us how to forget. The silhouettes of the legionnaires at sunset were downright poetic. The misfits of humanity, caught up among the squads of the regimented, are poignant, yet heroic, souls.

2076143,5,B0002CHIFG,"Ah life does imitate art. Almost 60 years after this film was made, a suicidal young man joined the US Marines to forget his girl troubles. This film will always have a special place in my heart.

Ollie falls in love while in Paris, to an inn keepers daughter. His proposal is turned down amidst laughter at his expense. Stan thinks that the best thing to do is to go back to the fish market where they work, but Ollie had nobler ideas, he must drown himself along with his broken heart. Of course Ollie convinces Stan that he must die too, after all what would Stan do without Ollie, aside from having a wonderful and rewarding life at the fish market. But thanks to some friendly advice and a man-eating shark, the boys decide to live again and join the French Foreign Legion.

What a Legion it is, work and march from sunup until sundown for 2 cents a day. Ollie tells the commandant that they refuse to do that much work for 2 cents, so they are put on laundry detail. I have never in my life seen a pile of clothes that large. Well Ollie has a revelation and forgets about his heartache and decides it is time to go home. After all why clean a mountain of dirty drawers if you don't have too.

Well the boys do not understand the terms desertion, UA, or AWOL, so off they go, but not without wrting a nice letter to the Commandant and stealing his cigars. Well the letter was pretty insulting and maybe it is a good thing that Ollie cannot spell raspberries. So after a little chase and a nice rendition of 'Shine on Harvest Moon', the boys are captured and thrown into a cell to await the firing squad. However, an eternal mysterious hand throws them a letter through the bars. There is an escape hatch. Stan is not sure why they are crawling through an underground tunnel.

Ollie ""We're making our escape""

Stan ""Are we allowed to do that?""

Anyway they make their way to an airplane and get away from the chasing legionaires, only to crash. Ollie becomes a horse through the magic of movie reincarnation and Stan is doomed to walk the earth with people 'staring at him and wondering what he is'.

It's a good flick, I like it",1179532800,,2133,4.344221105527638
2076144,2,B0002CHIFG,"I tried so hard to love this movie, but in all honesty, I thought it was painfully unfunny.  I laughed twice - first when Ollie tells Stan that without him ""people would stare at you and wonder what you are - and I wouldn't be here to tell them"" and last at the very end when Ollie is reincarnated as a horse with a mustache and a hat.  To be fair, I admit that I also smiled once to see Ollie's coy flirtation with the innkeeper's daughter.

Apart from that, the film was only interesting for its surprising bleakness at the beginning - there was something compelling about watching Ollie, suicidally depressed, decide that Stan too must die.

All in all, I was bored.  The boys try hard to be funny but the material just isn't up to it.  Two laughs is not enough.",1179273600,,765,4.277777777777778

On the whole, the images are crisp and the sound is consistently clear.  There are occassional scratch and dirt marks but these are so infrequent and occur so quickly that they do not detract in any way from the viewing of this film.  These elements, combined with some of the extras included on the CD make it an excellent value and a worthwhile addition to any collection of classic Laurel and Hardy films.",1177027200,,624,4.362068965517241
2076146,5,B0002CHIFG,"While everyone seems to agree that L&H did their greatest most representative work for Hal Roach Studios, there are some films here and there from other studios which are just as strong, great, and funny.  This is one of them, and in spite of a mixed reputation among fans, is often cited as the best non-Roach film, period.  The plot starts out simply enough; Stan and Ollie are vacationing in France, about to return to the United States, but Ollie is in love with Georgette.  He is heartbroken when he finds out she loves another man (later he finds out she's actually married, and to his Foreign Legion commanding officer no less), and decides to bump himself off.  Naturally he makes Stan commit suicide too, but after a number of typical false starts, they're finally saved when Georgette's husband comes by (he overheard them arguing) and recommends joining the Foreign Legion as a surefire way of forgetting all about women.  The boys take him up on his advice, but after causing a lot of trouble and a quick discovery that they're just not cut out for the service, they pack up their things and leave.  Their superiors are furious to discover the note they left, and have them arrested when they finally catch up to them.  When they tunnel their way out, there's an avalanche and they're forced to start digging up instead, right into the wine cellar in Georgette's house.  More comedic mayhem ensues as they start running away again, and they end up in a plane they can't even fly properly, culminating in one of their strangest endings ever.

Also included are a bunch of interesting rarities--two short silent newsreels showcasing their 1932 visit to Edinburgh, Scotland and Tynemouth, England, a brief 1943 PSA short narrated by Pete Smith, 'Tree in a Test Tube' (their only appearance in color besides the short surviving fragment of the 1930 feature 'The Rogue Song'), a gallery of posters, stills, and PR materials, an introduction by Serge Bromberg (director and co-founder of Lobster Films), a star-studded (but not very good) 1931 short they made a brief cameo in, 'The Stolen Jools' (just about everyone under contract to MGM at the time makes an appearance here, along with some guest stars from other studios!), and their 1954 appearance on 'This Is Your Life.'  It's well-known in the fan community that they weren't really pleased about appearing on the program, and it really shows in how quiet they are and how ill at ease and embarrassed they look.  Stan in particular wasn't happy about being surprised like this, since he always liked to have material prepared before giving a performance.  Additionally, most of the guests who came on didn't really have much of a connection to them; it was nice to see people like Ollie's first sweetheart, the woman who was in his performance troupe when he was living in Florida, and director Leo McCarey, but most of them didn't have a big connection to them like, say, Charley Hall, Billy Gilbert, Hal Roach, Sr., Anita Garvin, or Tiny Sanford, all people who were still alive at the time.  It could have been a great loving tribute to them, but instead falls really flat.

Although fan reaction to 'The Flying Deuces' is mixed, I really like it, though perhaps wouldn't rate it quite as high as a feature like 'A Chump at Oxford' or 'Pack Up Your Troubles.'  And even though they weren't at Hal Roach for this picture, their longtime foil Jimmy Finlayson also appears here, and he's as great and funny as always.  Unlike most of their other non-Roach films, here they still have control over their characters, aren't relegated to lesser roles, and had a great script.  As for picture quality, I'm reviewing the Kino release, which has very good image quality.  It's too bad the reviews for all of the releases of this are being mixed together.  I didn't see anything wrong with the prints, certainly not enough to give this a lower rating.  Whatever happened to the days when fans didn't throw a fit just because something didn't always have crystal-clear picture-perfect image quality?  It seems as though the invention of the DVD has really raised people's expectations, and now we hear complaints about less than 100% perfect or remastered images when such prints would have been considered just fine instead of horrid or unwatchable in the era of the VHS.",1160352000,,4328,4.8059299191374665
2076147,4,B0002CHIFG,"Quite a bit of stuff happens in this short 70-minute film.  Hardy falls in love with a girl who is already married, and Laurel keeps bumping his head into a ceiling by accident.  When Hardy's girl tells him she's not available, he contemplates suicide.  Naturally, Laurel is dragged into the suicide attempt as well.  They go to a river where Hardy ties one end of a rope to a heavy object, and ties the other end to himself.  Then he ties Laurel to the rope too.  Laurel says he has no reason to follow Hardy into going through with such a dreadful act, but Hardy says Laurel is incapable of making it in life alone, so he has no choice.  In Hardy's own words, ""People would stare at you and wonder what you are...and I wouldn't be there to tell them.""

Just as they're about to end it all, a man recommends the two men join the foreign legion to forget about their girl troubles and they take his advice.

Hardy plans to only be a part of the legion for a few days, until he forgets about women completely.  He and Laurel refuse to work for less than 25 cents a day, yet they end up working for 3 cents a day washing and ironing clothes.  After Hardy sees the mountain of work he's asked to do, he says, ""A miracle has happened.  I've completely forgotten what I'm supposed to forget.  Let's go home.""  Unfortunately his iron sets fire to a giant pile of clothing, and he and Laurel are both arrested.  They tunnel out of their jail cell, and try their hand at flying a plane to escape.  This is where the ""Flying Deuces"" title comes into play.  Both steering wheels of the plane break off at the same time, leaving its two occupants helpless.  They crash into the ground at full speed, and Laurel miraculously survives.  Hardy isn't so lucky, and is reincarnated into a mustached horse with a derby.  A very unusual ending I must say.  Great plot though, and a great film.",1154822400,,1875,4.345821325648415

2076149,4,B0002CHIFG,"I think I may have seen one other Laurel and Hardy film in my life before this one, though of course theses two men are such an integral part of comedy film history that somehow you feel like you've seen them a hundred times, and you're familiar with their schtick (Ollie's tie wiggling, Stan's head scratching and warbling) even when it's only because you've seen them imitated by countless later comedians.

Anyway, this one was fun and had a lot of great bits...I even enjoyed the little muscial/dance number they threw into the middle of a chase scene. This film also exemplified a ""theory of comedy"" aphorism I've heard of the years...something along the lines of 'the best comedy teeters on being a tragedy' and this one, does just that: A man defeated love attempts suicide, then, in an effort to forget his sorrow, enroles in the living Hell of the Foreign Legion and struggles to escape.  Doesn't sound like a comedy when described that way does it?? But, thank goodness, it is a comedy and an innovative laugh-and-snort fest at that.

Enjoy it just for the fun of it all and then watch it again to study the genius of these two men.",1142899200,,1142,4.588235294117647
2076150,5,B0002CHIFG,"This is a superb version of the delightful Flying Deuces.  Transferred from a nitrate 35 mm negative recently discovered in France and restored by Lobster Films, Paris who also worked on the great `Lost Films` series.

The sound has also been digitally cleaned and restored.

As usual a Kino Distribution is a hallmark of a quality release in itself and there is a wonderful goodie bag of extras including the `Tree in a Testube` colour educational short (shot on 16mm), 16mm footage of the boys` trip to the UK in 1932, `This is your life`(1955) and the fantastic charity short `Stolen Jools` with Buster Keaton, Edward G, Gary Cooper and many stars.

Overall: Excellent quality dvd transfer with an exciting tray of extras.  Superb value for money and the only version of this quality available anywhere in the world (apart from France - but that is the same version) 100% recommendation for Laurel and Hardy fans!!

Incidentally, for once, this is one that is not available here in the UK in a better version. So to coin a long lost short it is ""Hats Off"" to KINO and LOBSTER.",1114646400,,1079,4.682539682539683
2076151,4,B0002CHIFG,"""The Flying Dueces"" has always gotten a bit of a short shrift over the years from critics and fans alike but I have always thought it deserved better praise than it has gotten.
And finally KINO has released the best print of this movie I think I've ever seen to date. The French company Lobster films from whose archives this release comes from (and many other titles from Kino;check out their 'Slapstick Emporium' series!) obtained a very good 35mm negative in Europe and through some remastering in picture and sound have released this picture as close to its' original look as I think any of us has seen since its' debut in /39. The sound is improved and the contrast has been totally restored. It is not the washed out thing we've been used to seeing ad nauseum on release after wretched release on video and DVD here in North America.
Also included with this is a couple of short reels of their English /32 trip,the ""This is Your Life"" show from /54,The ""Stolen Jools"" from /31 and ""Tree in a Test Tube"" from /45. All this material is from better than average to good prints. I thought they could have done alot more with them considering the technology now but they are at least better than I have seen any of them previously.
Also included is a brief statement about ""Flying Deuces"" from the president and co-founder of Lobster films. And the original French trailer and various pictures of the North American and European posters for it.
In conclusion I recommend this DVD very highly. It has alot of extras but the main attraction hands down is the print itself. A revelation.",1107561600,,1585,4.604240282685512

""The Flying Deuces"" is a classic.  Silly and poorly made by today's standards, it is still a fun romp if you take it at face value and don't treat it too analytically.

2076156,4,B0002CHIFG,"""The Flying Deuces"" (1939) was the only non-Hal Roach production in which Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy maintained a fair amount of creative control - a quality largely absent from most of their 1941-45 output. After leaving Roach in 1940, the team's brilliance was tarnished by Fox and MGM's assembly-line approach to visual comedy. It's a shame that independent producer Boris Morros and RKO didn't retain Stan and Ollie's services after the success of ""The Flying Deuces,"" which is a minor classic in their filmography. Though lacking the high production values of the best Roach features, this Foreign Legion escapade remains a fast-paced romp with plenty of memorable routines and some charming musical interludes. The recent Kino edition offers the complete 69-minute feature in remarkably good quality, but it is the Astor reissue and not an original RKO print. Hopefully, a first-generation master of ""The Flying Deuces"" will emerge on DVD in this lifetime.",1076889600,,964,5.266233766233766

However,this being their final film kind of makes it a collector's item for me. I hadn't realised they had been around as long as from the roaring 20s until 1950. Amazing!

2076163,3,B0002CHIFG,"'The Flying Deuces' plumbs depths of despair that almost reach the tragic pitch of a Buster Keaton.  From the opening sequence, where a lovestruck Ollie has his marriage proposal turned down by a French waitress who laughs at him with her friends behind his back, the comedy is soured by very real pain.  The rest of the film sees the pair trying to drown Ollie's sorrows, so, appropriately, images of water humorously recur.  This is especially ironic in that the action's bulk is set in the Moroccan desert, with Laurel and Hardy joining the Foreign Legion, only for the duration needed, they think, for Ollie to 'forget'.
Perhaps the desert suggests the emotional barrenness searing Ollie's soul; perhaps the film is merely having a laugh at the contemporary FL hit 'Beau Geste'.  In support of the former conjecture is the film's best sequence, which takes place just before they leave for Africa.  Stan flippantly asks his miserable friend why he doesn't just drown himself.  Ollie takes him up on the idea, but insists Stan join him - how could he live without his old comrade, people staring at him without Ollie there to 'explain'.  The business with the Sisyphean rock-weight to which they are both tied; the intrusions of an escaped monster-shark; the discussions about reincarnation (Ollie wants to come back as a horse); and the prolonged leavetaking, all make it difficult to tell where comedy ends and tragedy begins.
The film is full of brilliantly resonant sequences and images like this, such as the laundry episode, Stan wandering through an endless vineyard of clotheslines, and ending up on a mountian full of dirty linen; or the boys trying to rest only to be barked at by guards who are precursors to Beckett's malevolently unseen authorities.  The gloriously inappropriate musical interludes, such as a choreographed 'Shine On Harvest Moon' at the height of a chase sequence, includes Stan playing harp on the eve of their execution for desertion, the instrument ominously looking like a gallows with numerous 'strings'/nooses.
It's a shame the humour isn't up to the ideas (the script was co-written by Harry Langdon) - the sparse funny moments bejewel long stretches of tedium, and the film climaxes with an interminable action sequence that is neither exciting nor witty.  Worse, the print's quality, even on supposedly 'restored' DVD, is atrocious and presumably irredeemable, full of scratches, black-outs and missing shots - anything longer than a mid-shot is an impenetrable blur.  Yet even this flaw can add inadvertant eerieness to the film - when the boys are arrested, their faces disappear against the desert bleach, like a strange surrealist tableau, or a James Whale fantasy.",1014163200,,2712,5.074157303370787

For some reason, I was always touched by the scene where Hardy tells Laurel that without him, ""People will wonder what you are"" and Laurel begins to cry.
