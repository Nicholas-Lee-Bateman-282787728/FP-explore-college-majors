3418679,3,B0018QY0YC,My daughter loves this movie. It is good for elementary school age kids. Not great family fare. I could not get more than a half hour into it and had to excuse myself.,1292889600,,167,4.090909090909091
3418680,2,B0018QY0YC,"I bought this Oct 2008. The Amazon site still has no description of this (as of Aug 2009) and no reviews, so just a word of note: It is not a movie, but just a collection of a few episodes.

The animation is 90s-ish (the corner-shaped elbows on humans, odd mouth movements, etc) which may be acceptable as a Saturday morning SDTV Fullscreen thing for your child, but left lacking when on Blu-Ray for the same child.

[Spoiler alert] The story is the same in each episode.  Core loses a spore. Spore chased down and recovered. Spore replaced into Core. Happy end.  [/Spoiler alert]",1250035200,7,580,4.548076923076923
3418681,3,B0018QY0YC,DVD is a good kid-friendly movie. It is broken up into 4 segments so you don't have to watch the whole thing at one time. My kids enjoy it.,1245715200,,139,3.8275862068965516

3418683,5,B0018QY0YC,"Alex and Zoe discover a secret passageway in the public library that leads to a strange and wonderful land.  Here all the inhabitants are fully articulate animals who walk upright, wear clothing and understand advanced technology.  They are amused at the children's idea that humans are a more evolved species.  Welcome to Animalia!

""The Core"" is the key to Animalia, a big glowing mass located in the library at the center of the city.  When the Core is healthy, there is positive communication and the animals co-exist peacefully.  Unfortunately, the Core has cracked, which is causing the citizens to act like ... animals!  Alex and Zoe must find the elements necessary to repair the Core and restore peace to Animalia.

There is a strong storyline, which means viewers will eagerly anticipate each episode as the tale unfolds and the action mounts.  With the Core in disrepair, the animals are losing their refined personalities, submitting to their instincts instead.  For Alex and Zoe, this means Animalia is becoming a dangerous place if they choose to remain.

These videos are absolutely spellbinding.  The characters are nicely developed and the illustrations are bright and interesting.  Best of all, the animals are hilarious!  Each has a wonderfully quirky personality that is not dumbed down for younger children.  They are attributed specific accents and mannerisms that had us laughing straight through.  We loved every minute of this series!

It should be noted that these videos are intended for children ages 6 - 9, and could be a bit scary for younger children.",1227916800,8,1582,5.093385214007782

8270722,3,B0018QY0YC,I was hoping this was going to be ok but it would stop all throughout the movie :( disappointed didn't want to bother in contacting customer service since they were small items. But I won't order DVDs here again!,1392249600,,212,4.461538461538462

8270725,3,B0018QY0YC,"For those who don't know, this is not a movie but actually a set of four episodes from a tv series. These are the first four episodes so your child shouldn't be confused with continutaty. Anyways, set in the alternate world ""Animalia"" Zoe and Alex and the first two humans to ever step foot there. In the world of Animalia, animals have adapted to speaking, writing, standing on two legs, and have even set up there own society. Alex and Zoe learn that all this is possible because of the ""Core"",a mystical crystal that posseses magical abilities. Unfortanetly though, ""core spores"" (littles crystals that power the core) are now blasting off and it's up to Alex and Zoe to find them and help save Animalia. A litte cheesy but entertaining. The graphics are in CGI and for what it's worth, the graphics really aren't that bad, not pixar statis put tolerable. The show alone teaches morals and a little bit spelling. Likeable characters and semi-original stories, I think kids will enjoy it.",1379721600,,990,4.761627906976744

8270728,1,B0018QY0YC,"To Start off with I have seen every Episode of Animalia 1-40 on The Former PBS kids. that just went under in August an change the name to Pbs Encore till there contract runs out. that is about up now. an Animalia is A Cartoon that for Tiger Lovers like me. I could not stand making every episode about Attacking and Assulting an Insulting treating so Cold Tyrannticus Tiger. that Affirms and Proves himself through out most of these Episodes of Animalia but never gets the LOve and Acceptance he seeks. it had my Kids Crying at the way they would Act an Speak Against Tyrannticus Tiger. Attain an Showing No Love/Mercy an Grace once. an also never GIVING Tyrannticus Tiger HIS Happy Ending with the 1 he secretlly Loved Fushisa Fox. but that would be SO Sonic/Sally now wouldn't it. so they don't want to Please the Sonic/Sally crowd that I am of. in Closing many people I have Talk to told me they wish to God Animalia was never Created an that the full Judgement of God comes down on them for it. well it looks like it has Seen Australia LATELLY? in the news it says that the rainfall is at Biblical proportions. so there could be something in that. anyways I found out Animalia was A book with no Story,Script an only Pictures. A picture Book only an it Gets A Adaption. God ALMIGHTY what is this world coming to. that is so Incredilbe STUPID an DUM. is this how low Animation an Cartoon Series has come to Adapt books with just Pictures an make A Story an Cartoon. please God help us all. Give me A Dreamworks an Pixar an walt Disney Animated Film anyday over this trash.",1293926400,,1575,4.378839590443686
