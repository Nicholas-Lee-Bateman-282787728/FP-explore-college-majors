8359588,5,B002AJUU9K,"If you like cannon ball run, you will like this movie. It's not meant to be taken seriously. It's just a really fun movie.",1510358400,,122,4.125

8359591,4,B002AJUU9K,"I don't get the animus directed against this flick.  It's not going to be confused with ""Citizen Kane"" but then it was never intended to be.  It's an easily forgettable light-hearted romp that goes down smooth on a hot summer's night delivering a few thrills and chuckles along the way.  Burt Reynolds is in his classic sly good-ole-boy mode and he's abetted by agreeable co-stars.  Nobody's extending themselves here but they are having a good time and letting the audience in on the party as opposed to at their expense.  Lighten up, critics!",1435017600,,544,4.806451612903226
8359592,1,B002AJUU9K,"If you're a big fan of Burt Reynolds then you'll probably want to watch this movie but if you're not & miss it then you didn't miss much. The best thing about it was Ned Beatty. Every scene Beatty was in was hilarious & I even rewinded a few parts of his to watch over & over again. Other than him being in it, It really wasn't all that funny & was just something to watch",1432080000,,372,3.9078947368421053
8359593,4,B002AJUU9K,"If you love racing and comedy this is a great vintage movie. Come on Burt in a chicken suit, I dare ya not to laugh.",1376006400,,116,3.68
8359594,1,B002AJUU9K,"I don't mean to imply the dvd didn't work or the customer service was bad.  All those things were fine.  It just so happens that this movie is so spectacularly bad that it's basically unwatchable.  My friend recommended it to me as an entertaining bad movie in the cheesy 1980's, moustached, coke fueled vein of other such classics as ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and ""The Cannonball Run."" It's not even that. My friends and I could not enjoy the movie even whilst thoroughly drunk, and decided to turn it off after BURT REYNOLDS TOTALLY DATE RAPES A CHICK!  Not cool Burt, they should revoke your moustache for that one.

Pros: Slightly better ""bad movie to watch with your drunk friends"" than ""Irreversible.""
Cons: Boring, doesn't make any sense, rape.",1368230400,,749,4.775193798449612
