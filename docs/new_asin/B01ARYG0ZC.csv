8748064,3,B01ARYG0ZC,There was nothing special about this low budget movie. The acting was ehhh and the gore and blood was more ehh. I will admit there were parts where I was getting into the movie thinking it was gonna get better. Then it just went back to being a mediocre movie. The whole folk lore bit about the movie could of made things real interesting. Only if the acting was better and they explored the folklore more. This is alright for maybe a one time watch.,1481068800,,450,4.305882352941176
8748065,5,B01ARYG0ZC,"I was lucky enough to watch this at a Horror film festival in Ireland. It's schlocky, low budget fun that went down great with an audience. If you are a fan of the genre you should appreciate this welcome excursion from the modern mainstream bigger budget horrors. It's a straight forward slasher plot based around Gothic folklore with sexual undertones, gory deaths and a humerus cast that elevate proceedings. Devil's Woods is recommended to those that like the original Evil Dead, Blair Witch, Kill List or even old school Hammer horror films.",1478304000,,546,4.945652173913044
