I keep hearing my daughter saying ""dig"" or ""Thank you"" or ""push"" in Mandarin. Kai-Lan is always careful to stop and figure out why her friends act the way they do and takes the time to help them to solve their problems. I love it because she loves it, and I think they are doing a great job. I wish they'd make some toys, though.",1220486400,12,498,4.423913043478261
3417945,5,B0018O5WUA,"This Nick Jr show is great.  My son likes it as much as Dora.  Each episode is interactive (I think even more than other shows, like Dora)--Kai-Lan gets viewers involved with things like helping her count or pick out certain colors or shapes.  A few physical movements (reaching for things, etc) are promoted too.  But the primary plus is how it focuses on social and emotional development--one episode has a theme of managing anger, another of helping out your friends, etc.  And the song that is interwoven throughout the episodes (the words change for each episode, but the tune is the same) is quite catchy.  And I have learned a few Mandarin words!

Episodes:

Dragonboat Festival  -- Rintoo gets angry when he loses a dragonboat race. Kai-lan helps him calm down so they can all meet Mr. Dragon at the end of the festival.

Beach Day  -- On a trip to the beach, Tolee gets mad when the waves knock over his sand castle, so the others help him calm down and together they build a better castle.

Twirly Whirly Flyers  -- While playing near an ant city with Twirly Whirly flowers, Tolee accidentally break the ants' bridge. Kai-lan and her friends help the ants repair it.

Everybody's Hat Parade  -- Kai-lan and friends make hats and prepare for a special parade, but Rintoo is upset when Hoho copies his design, and Kai-lan must find a way to calm him so the parade can go on.",1220400000,64,1382,4.560975609756097

3417956,3,B0018O5WUA,"I'm a native Mandarin teacher for young pre-schoolers up to high school students. Per my students' recommendations, I was excited to see the show.

The good news is...it's very well done and is an attention-catcher for young learners.

My biggest issue is...how educational it is for kids who spend time watching it?

Each episode mentions a few words that do not correlate to one another, like Hello and Grandpa. And when the other animals that come into the scene, they were clearly all named with American names, except this monkey ""Hoho,"" which sounded very funny to me. Ho-Zi is monkey. If ""Hoho"" had been named ""Ho-Er"" instead, it would have been much more appropriate.

Also, too much English in the show that could have been easily replaced with some Mandarin words.

The sound of the Mandarin words are not clear or slow enough for new learners. When a language teacher teaches new words, it is very important to dissect the sounds slowly and clearly. When I watched the show, I didn't feel that the pronunciation was even standard or clear enough.

So, my opinion is this show is really more entertaining than educational.",1321747200,6,1132,4.839378238341969

This is the only one can keep her focused for 2 hours every day (commute to/from her daycare). It has been months now and she is still watching it. The other day she wanted me to go with her do something and she suddenly said to me ""gen wo lai"", which is the Chinese for ""follow me"" that she learned from the DVD.

3417961,5,B0018O5WUA,"My 4 1/2 month son LOVES Kai-Lan.....this is the one cartoon he smiles and laughs throughout (and at the same spots usually!) and he just adores her and her grandfather, Ye-Ye.  It's a great cartoon teaching children basic valuable lessons that kids are bound to come across in real life growing up.  It's sweet, has catchy tunes and very interactive and the episodes are just ADORABLE.  I just wish they had more DVDs of the episodes :(  Hopefully they'll come out soon.

One other note, while glancing at some reviews on this screen some say the characters are ""bad"" or they are too harsh or something to that effect.........what on earth are they talking about?  They must be have this cartoon mixed up with another one or something.  The characters are all cute, lovable and are all great friends and the main point of every episode is to cherish your friends and care for one another.

3417962,5,B0018O5WUA,"This is a great dvd. My 20 month old will hardly sit still to watch anything educational on tv, but this show she dearly loves. It teaches manners, how to feel empathy for others, how to deal with conflict, and most importantly respect for other peoples feelings. It is a very cute program that I feel any child would benefit from watching.",1250467200,,340,4.5
3417963,2,B0018O5WUA,"We bought this DVD because we're Chinese American and wanted a product that would introduce our son to Chinese culture and language.  We had been very satisfied with the Dora and Diego series and what it did for Latino/Hispanic culture.  We were very disappointed.  Evidently Nickelodeon used up most of it's talent and resources for it's money maker Dora the Explorer and Kai Lan seems like an afterthought.

Our biggest gripe is that each episode involves one of Kai Lan's friend's exhibiting some poor personal characteristic (selfishness, anger, etc) and upsetting their set of friends and generally disrupting whatever fun task they have that day (going to the beach, etc).  The rest of the episode is then spent rectifying this problem and ""teaching"" everyone what attitudes are proper.  In theory this is fine for older children who understand the concept that the show is imaginary and can distance themselves from the show.  For younger children (like my son) it may be upsetting to see one of the central characters being angry, sad/crying or acting out (grabbing toys from other children, throwing tantrums).  In one episode a character spends most of the episode depressed and feeling left out, my son actually cried.  The happy ending was too little too late to make him feel better.

What we wanted was something fun and educational focusing on Chinese culture, not lessons in behavior and morality taught by intense emotional scenes and demonstrations of poor behavior.  Older kids may be able to grasp and benefit the lessons and see it only at a show but the paradox is that this age child would probably not enjoy the show.  I think the plot and ""acting"" of the episodes are too intense and abstract for the children Nickelodeon is targeting.  As an adult I found the characters and their troubles actually very annoying.  Others on this site have echoed this main complaint of mine, so rest assured it's not just me.

Additional brief complaints: the songs are not catchy and light years behind the music in the Dora and Diego episodes.  The Chinese is also minimal (taking a back seat to each episode's morality lesson) and I would have liked it to be more of a focus.

On the positive side (what saved it from being just one star): In all fairness though you buy these DVD's to watch with your kids and provide a starting point for conversations and not to use it as a sole teaching method.  So it would be a nice way to facilitate lessons in Chinese with your children and a good starting point.  The pronunciation is correct and the portrayal of Kai Lan and her Chinese culture and ethnicity is great and authentic.  The characters are cute and initially captivating, if it wasn't for their annoying behaviors my kid probably would probably love them.

The bottom line is that my Chinese-American son remembers more of his Spanish-centered Diego episodes (characters, plots, songs, etc) and has more fun watching these than theses videos about his own culture and about a language he hears everyday from his grandparents.  It's a shame.",1248652800,11,3059,4.853564547206166
3417964,5,B0018O5WUA,"My boys (6 and 3 yr olds) love Kai-Lan!  They can't get enough.  They'll watch it over and over.  As Chinese kids born in America, they are a little familiar with the Chinese language through interaction with family members, so it is great that they get a little lesson on specific words and pronunciation on their level.  In my opinion, the Kai-Lan storylines are better than Dora because they teach about everyday social situations that kid's have to deal with (others bragging, being impatient, dealing with frustration, etc.).  In addition, there are episodes that also teach about the Chinese culture, customs, and holidays (dragon boat festival, moon festival, Chinese New Year, eating dumplings, etc.).
If you're looking for an entertaining way to expose your kids to a little bit of Chinese culture and language on their level, I highly recommend the Kai-Lan DVDs (or record the show from NickJr).  Kai-Lan is a thousand times better than the other Chinese children's DVDs, like Adventures of Walker and Ping Ping, and Journeys to the East.  Go with Kai-Lan - much more engaging for the children, and more proper Chinese pronunciation.",1247097600,4,1143,5.047872340425532
3417965,2,B0018O5WUA,"This is just a Chinese-American version of Dora.  It's about as Chinese as I am (white Caucasian).  It reflects the low extent that Chinese-American kids are exposed to real Chinese culture (dragon boat festival, Chinese new year, red envelopes, dumplings etc. i.e. stuff that most non-Chinese people already know about anyways).  Your kid will hardly learn any Chinese language from these videos. That being said, the cartoon is well done, and very entertaining, very much in the style of Dora the Explorer, so you will get your money's worth if that is your goal.  However, if your goal is to teach your kids real Chinese language and culture, get some other video instead (e.g. Journey to the East), or go on a trip to China.  The good thing about this video is it really gets the kids hooked for hours, so you can have them glued on to TV while you do other stuff.  (Is that a good thing?  If they are to be glued for hours, I'd rather have them learn useful things, which isn't really the case here...)

As a side note, in reply to M Chung's review below: our daughter has also been influenced by Rintoo's bad behavior.  I don't quite know why.  This bad behavior isn't present in Dora the Explorer.  The only bad character there is Swiper, but he rarely appears, and when he does, it is only for a short time, and they always deal with him swiftly.  You also see bad characters in Disney cartoons (e.g. Wile E Coyote), but those aren't problematic either.  Maybe the problem with Rintoo is that he isn't sidelined and marginalized (like Wile E Coyote is - because he's so ridiculous), but instead integrated?  I don't know.  But here, it does have a somewhat negative impact on our kid.  Luckily, she stopped watching Ni Hao Kai Lan and is instead learning real languages from other DVDs.  It's likely that this is an isolated even and your kid may not have this problem with acting like Rintoo.  I was surprised to see that myself.",1243209600,3,1938,4.568115942028985
3417966,2,B0018O5WUA,"In Ni Hao Kai-Lan Super Special Days, I like the idea of a Chinese kid's show teaching a few Chinese words here and there, but the goal of the show is not to teach a new language.  It's about a Chinese girl and her adventures with her friends and family while introducing a few Chinese words. It's similar to Dora and her adventures while teaching a few Spanish words.

My kids (twin boys-5 years, girl-3 years), especially my daughter, enjoy the show very much.  There are lessons to be learned about being polite, calming down when you're angry, helping friends, being creative, and having fun.  However, because there's a lesson to be learned, one of the characters has to act naughty before he learns to behave....that's where the trouble begins for me.

Of course this could happen in any child's video, but for some reason my kids mimic all the bad behavior exhibited in the Ni Hao Kailan videos.  For example, in the Dragonboat Festival, Rintoo is ""so mad"" when he doesn't win the boat race.  He goes around saying ""I'm so mad"" and kicks the boat.  Luckily he does learn to calm down and eventually wins a race, but my children now often say ""I'm so mad"" and kicks things.  Rintoo also has a fit on Beach Day when his castle gets destroyed.  Once again my kids act that out as well.  In Everybody's Hat Parade, Rintoo gets angry when his friend copies his hat design but eventually learns it's a compliment.  Unfortunately now my kids sometimes say ""he's copying me"" when they get the same flavor ice cream or something else where there are only a few choices.

Needless to say, this behavior is annoying and I can only attribute their learning it from watching the Ni Hao Kailan show because my kids are generally well behaved.  This problem may be isolated to only my kids, but I wanted to give parents a warning because of my experience.

I don't let the kids watch the show as often now, but when I do I try to emphasize the good behavior.  I like the show because the lead character is a girl and can be a role model of little girls.  However, for me the bad behavior in the show negates most of the positive messages.

I did buy the next DVD called ""Celebrate with Kai-Lan"" and the bad behavior continued. <sigh>  I'll address that in a short review for that DVD.

I will probably buy future Ni Hao Kai-Lan DVDs but will screen them carefully before showing them to my kids.",1241913600,33,2387,4.468822170900693
3417967,1,B0018O5WUA,"About the only chinese thing about this children's video is the fact that Kai-Lan is chinese but the whole story concentrates on a Tigers having a fit and how the rest of the kids will help him concentrate on a boat race.

There are maybe 3 to 6 chinese words used and translated.  All songs are in english and there's no emphasis on teaching Mandarin.  If I could return this video I would do so right away.  My son lost interest in it
a few minutes into it.

""The river dragon King"" from Journeys to the East is thus far the best children's chinese learning video I've found.

I do not recommend this video.

No, don't use this to teach your kids Mandarin Chinese; there're few Chinese words.  But that's the whole point... it's a general-audience show for all preschoolers, and it does a great job at that.  The characters are loveable -- and easier on the eye.  The young actress who does Kai-lan's voice does a superb job -- she's my second favorite Nick Jr. voice actor, after the SpongeBob guy. :)  This DVD features 4 episodes, as well as a ""My Favorite Places"" music video.

She also really likes all of the characters. It is educational in a fun way for young kids, and teaches some valuable lessons in resolving issues that they might encounter. The animation is bright and lively without being overly stimulating, and each episode is the perfect length for toddlers (25 mins). It's great that Nickelodeon is branching out in their programming to include different cultures and languages. I am definitely going to pre-order the next DVD.",1225238400,5,602,5.03
3417973,5,B0018O5WUA,"Until now, if you were, say, a 1st-generation Chinese parent who wanted their 2nd-generation, fully-immersed kid to watch Chinese DVDs targeted at English-speaking kids, you had to suffer through a few noble but failed attempts: Bao Bei the Panda is a notable example, Jade goes to Kindergarten is a little better.

This is great for Chinese language, though not for the vocabulary, but mostly because they use crazy-hard words like ""Xue"" and other tongue-rolling Chinese sounds and my kid picked it up spontaneously.  Of course, we thought she was swearing at first, but turns out she was saying the word for shoe (or more appropriately, the word for slippers/sandals).

Anyhow, that's not the best part of these videos, which is a refreshing surprise.  While Dora, Diego, and Blue all teach your kid to basically follow a three-part mystery, and prepare them for a lifetime of watching CSI or Law & Order, Kai Lan and her friends teach them much more valuable lessons.

What seems like Chinese Dora is not that at all -- it's really geared at teaching how to deal with tough situations for kids, like when it's raining, or if they're angry about something, etc.  The only other children's series I've seen come close to this is Thomas the Tank Engine (where the trains often wind up embarassed at their behavior when frustrated) and Sesame Street (where it often takes a human being to point out to Elmo or Zoe that they're being unreasonable.  Again).  But Kai Lan convinces her friends to calm down, find things to do when it's raining, etc.  (Notably, some episodes are better examples than others; I went to iTunes to grab the episodes not on this DVD).

If you're debating whether or not to get this DVD, just get it.  There's so much to be said for it, and very little to be said against it.  It stands up to repeated viewings (because Chinese is so difficult to learn to American ears), and the stories are actually emotionally educational.  At first blush, it's a wannabe Dora.  But after you watch it a few times -- and if your kid has two eyes and two ears, they will force you to watch it more than a few times -- you'll realize that Kai Lan has created a super special place of her own in the pantheon of kids' TV programming.",1223683200,50,2240,4.623737373737374

Yes, the culture is ""Americanized,"" but honestly why else would this be a Nickelodeon show? Does Dora the Explorer accurately portray Mexican life? No, of course not! Both shows do a fantastic job at making language relatable and introducing different cultures. Children want to see these colorful animal characters, which we adults may find annoying. The best part of this show is how it incorporates different looking characters into the scenarios. There is Kailan-the chinese Dora,  Lulu- the helpful, friendly pink rhino, Tolee- the jittery, afraid gray panda, Rintoo- the daring yellow tiger, and Hoho- the small temper tantrum monkey.

This show is honestly better than Dora. I don't see why so many keep picking at the show's plot lines. So what, the writers repeated a few stories... as long as it's educational and appealing to children, repetition should not matter.",1412208000,2,1036,5.088235294117647
