4594479,5,B00579EKXC,"I have never forgotten seeing this on a MET telecast and being blown away.  For those who overuse the word ""awesome"", this redefines that word.  It is incredible.  Jon Vickers is never a singer who is acting.  He IS Otello.  Every utterance, in addition to being well sung, has an intensity that illuminates every phrase.  You don't need the subtitles.  When he sings, ""Non ora!""  (Not now!) it is a warning Desdemona doesn't heed but obviously should.  In the scene, after he calls her ""Otello's whore"" he drives her from the stage with an elemental fury that takes your breath away.  Wow!

Renata Scotto was also a great actress, and here she is in pristine vocal condition.  This is the kind of performance for her that only adds to her glory.  Cornell MacNeil was never my favorite baritone, but here he grabs every nuance.  The duet ""Si pel ciel"" is monumentally good.

There are minor moments in act one when the chorus is not squarely with Mr. Levine.  This is brief, and it is easy to understand how it happens.  Stage movement is a distraction.  Forget about it!  The rest of the cast is filled with the kind of great singers that only the MET can put forth.

Buy it before it fades away.",1313366400,43,1197,4.5046728971962615
4594480,5,B00579EKXC,"I bought this from the MET opera shop a few months ago. It is a magnificent performance. And Jon Vickers is a force of nature. He literally takes your breath away. Scotto is great as Desdemona and Cornell MacNeil's dark Iago completes a great trio. James Levine, as is to be expected, conducts a taught performance. If you have not seen Vickers as Otello you should do yourself a favor. This, along with his Peter Grimes, is a performance for the history books.",1311724800,47,461,4.566265060240964
4594481,5,B00579EKXC,"Vickers sometimes ruined opera for me. I was fortunate enough to see him in Otello, Peter Grimes, Parsifal, Tristan, Aeneas, Siegmund, Samson(both operas). I never want to see anyone else in these roles. He reaches heights of the tragic figures that can be overwhelming, shattering and riveting. It is difficult to see anyone else do these parts. Thank you Jon Vickers.",1298937600,3,369,5.065573770491803
4594482,5,B00579EKXC,"If you are an opera lover and particularly an Otello fan this is the performance you need to own.

I am fortunate to have seen Vickers do otello live on several occasions...there is no doubt that he was the definitive otello of his generation, and no one has come close to capturing the tortured character. Domingo pales next to this portrayal..dramatically and vocally.

Scotto is also unrivalled in her portrayal of Desdemona bringing out both the vulnerability and strenghts of her character.

Cornell Macneil is an evil, devious Iago.

James Levine conducts the work as though Verdi was standing over him.",1295827200,3,609,5.0
4594483,5,B00579EKXC,"I confess to being a Jon Vickers fan, attending many of his performances in this opera as well as in Die Walkure, Samson and Delilah, Fidelio, Peter Grimes and was present at the tour de force performance of Tristan und Isolde at the Met with him and Birgit Nilsson. This DVD of Otello showcases his subtle artistry in transforming Otello from the celebrated leader and loving husband to a neurotic, self-destructive being who is manipulated by the slightest insinuations.  What a life lesson his demise teaches as a reminder to many of us about our suppressed emotions. Otello may be viewed as a dormant volcano waiting to explode.  And oh, the anguish that Vickers expresses in his ""Dio! mi potevi scagliar tutti i mali"" in Act III - one doesn't need a translation as he laments Desdemona's supposed infidelity; he just breaks your heart with his impassioned singing.

With such a terrific Otello, Renata Scotto's Desdemona was a great complement to his disturbing temperament. Hers was not a ""placid, shrinking violet"" interpretation as I have seen in other sopranos.  Watch her body language as she responds defiantly to the false charges, particularly at the beginning of Act III. Her fate may be sealed, but she goes down fighting.  Her ""Ave Maria"" was exquisitely sung.

Cornell MacNeil gave fine nuances to Iago, full of subtle contempt for the happy couple and his determined goal to destroy all good in the world.  Finally, the fabulous conducting of James Levine, chorus, costumes and scenery  give excellent balance to the cast. All elements combine to make what Richard Wagner defines as  a ""gesamtkunstwerk"", a work of art that attempts to incorporate many art forms successfully. Your opera or theatrical DVD's are not complete without this stellar achievement.",1270339200,6,1776,5.034129692832765
4594484,5,B00579EKXC,"This is probably the best Otello on video today. Vickers is as good as it gets in the title role. Scotto is also excellent. But, what puts this one over the top, is the Iago. Looking at the others (I have two of them), most have only average Iagos. Cornell McNeil makes this the best trio on video. You have to go back to Martinelli/Tibbett (cd) to find something comparable. The young James Morris and excellent conducting by James Levine complete the picture. Don't hesitate.",1261526400,5,477,4.623529411764705
4594485,5,B00579EKXC,"Reading the other reviews, there must be many of us who have eagerly anticipated the release on DVD of this performance for over 30 years now (or at least for as long as DVD's have existed!)  In my lifetime, the great Otello's were Mario del Monaco and Placido Domingo.  But this 1978 performance by Vickers tops them all.  In fact it even tops Vickers' own performance that he did in the film version of Otello, conducted by Karajan, which has been available for many years now.  Vickers is so intense, it's almost surprising his epileptic fit at the end of Act III isn't real!  One piece of delicious irony is during that same year, 1978, Vickers played the completely different role of Vasek in Smetana's ""The Bartered Bride.""  During an intermission of that performance, Vickers is seen laughing in the most light-hearted manner about the importance of not taking one's self too seriously.  I wish I had a video clip of that!
MacNeil and Scotto are both superb, just completely overshadowed by Vickers (kind of the way Joan Fontaine was by Elizabeth Taylor in the 1957 ""Ivanhoe,"" but I digress.)
The video is restored superbly and the audio is certainly passable.  I would deduct one half star for it if I could.  The overall sound is a bit on the shrill, brassy side, except curiously for Scotto, who's pianissimo's seem unaffected, a remarkable achievement, I think!
1978 was the second year the Met was performing live telecasts.  I doubt they knew what a potential gold mine they had, and didn't take quite as much care of the technical end as they should have.  Still, it is a miracle and a blessing to have what there is.  Bravo, Vickers, et. al., and Bravo, Met!",1256428800,10,1673,4.67235494880546

4594487,5,B00579EKXC,"This legendary production dates from September 25, 1978 and I received and watched this DVD exactly 31 years later.  As is the case with the Met Cav/Pag, the video and audio have been restored.  I am in full agreement with the reviews by Messrs. Morgan and Rossi.  This is a shattering performance that will leave you breathless.  Jon Vickers' Otello is superbly sung and acted and Cornell MacNeil's Iago just oozes malevolence.  Given the right role in the right production, Renata Scotto would rise to the ranks of the great singing actresses.  This is one of those nights -- she is sublime as Desdemona.

I hope The Met will continue to release their early telecasts on DVD -- especially Miss Scotto's Trittico.  By itself, her acting at the end of Suor Angelica would more than justify the price of the disc.",1253923200,32,812,4.709219858156028
4594488,5,B00579EKXC,"I totally agree with Brian Morgan's review and insights (above).  I, too, have been waiting for this perfomance to be released....I hope that there are many more from the early MET telecasts!!!  I was very lucky to get this ""Otello"" on my Met Subscription when I lived in New York.  It always left a fantastic impression with me all these years.  The three leads deliver their emotions right on target..Vickers with his sad suffering...Scotto with her undying (well, actually dying)love and MacNeil with his ferocious cruelty.
This might not be Zeffirelli's best production at the Met but it more than serves its purpose...it is direct, atmospheric and beautiful.  No cheap sets and costumes here.  It is always refreshing to see a production as the composer envisioned it...no attempts at updating the story to some weird and/or modern interpretation.  Zeffirelli always gave you your money's worth.
I just received this DVD along with the ""Cav and Pag"" Met DVD but have not watched it yet. As soon as I do, I'll write reviews of those two performanes.
I'm glad I purchased this ""Otello"".  Along with the 1995 Domingo Met Performace DVD, I now have the two greatest interpreters of the role in my life time.  Thanks to the Met for releasing this DVD.",1251676800,12,1251,4.863207547169812
4594489,4,B00579EKXC,"I truly can not add more about this performance than what has already been said.  As I watch modern operatic productions where a singer has to be part gymnast or must have gone through marathon training in order to get through a production, it is so refreshing to see performers that with minimal action can convey the drama relying mostly on their voice.  The only reason I did not give this 5 Stars is because the performance was taped back in the 70's and you would think that with todays technological advances the MET would invest in trying to improve the video quality a bit. Still and all, this has to be perhaps the best Otello I have ever seen and highly recommend it!!",1440892800,3,678,4.459677419354839
4594490,5,B00579EKXC,A great performance I remember loving in my youth. It's really nice to be able to see it again now. Both Scotto and Vickers are superb and their great chemistry together is as I had remembered it.,1434326400,,196,4.324324324324325
4594491,5,B00579EKXC,"This is a tremendous performance of Otello and will be a rare jewel as few can afford to stage grand opera like the Met.  John Vickers is at once noble and madly jealous, capturing the two poles of his flawed character.  Renata Scotto is outstanding as Desdemona and I do not believe one will hear or see any better.  Iago uses a simple kerchief to bring down a great and noble man and his beautiful and pure bride.  The passion of jealousy, envy and covertness is on full display and powerfully presented.  Buy these while you can, opera lovers, they are the golden age.",1417392000,,571,4.451923076923077

4594494,1,B00579EKXC,"This refers to a different Otello but much of it applies.

I went, against my better judgement, with a rather sophisticated couple, both serious musicians, smart, and apparently sane, to see the Met production of Otello in a local theater last nite. They loved it and I have no idea why. Sure the orchestra plays well and the singers can belt out the notes, but everything else about this reeks. The story and dialogue makes Days of Our Lives look highbrow.  The music lacked any ability to stir me. The ""acting"" reminded me of the mugging one sees in silent movies. WTF??? Really? Great? Art? Give me a break.
If I ever have trouble sleeping, I now know what to do... put on an opera. If they could bottle this drivel, they'd make a fortune marketing to insomniacs.
The next time someone asks me to go to an opera, I'll schedule a root canal even if I don't need one as an excuse.
This emperor definitely has no clothes.",1404950400,,921,4.443786982248521
4594495,5,B00579EKXC,"I saw Jon Vickers do Otello more than any other tenor.  In fact, my very first Met performance was ""Otello"" with Vickers while one then unkown Kiri te Kanawa made an unofficial debut when she filled in for Teresa Stratas.  Vickers was nothing short of a force of nature and sang his opening line, ""Esultate..."" standing on the deck of his ship as far upstage as one could get.  Other tenors wouldn't attempt such a thing and they always came right down front as they knew they'd not be heard from such a distance.  This was a problem Vickers certainly never had, and in several later performances the volume he created actually hurt my ears.  But Otello alone does not make this a great opera.

The Desdemona of Renata Scotto is echt Italian prima donna.  When Otello first accuses her of being unfaithful, she doesn't demur, she gets angry!  At last we have a smoldering scene at that moment!  So many sopranos sing Desdemona as though she were made of Dresden China.  Not Scotto.  She gives Vickers a full run for his money and he responds by being better than ever.

This early TV production is nothing like the nonsense we get in HD.  The mics aren't place on the singers wigs or costumes as they are now - making everyone sound equal when they most certainly are not.  Kirk Browning is the director, but he's not zooming down the singer's throats as they seem to love to do these days.  And the quality of the video is that of late 70s TV, not HD TV.

But the great Zefferelli production and the smarmily massive Iago of Cornell MacNeil reminds anyone who saw this opera back then that, yes, this kind of thing really DID happen.  For those of us who grew up on big voices and big personalities, grand opera has almost vanished from the stage today.  I can't recall getting three world class singers as we have here since the mid 1980s, and I am far from alone in this feeling.

James Levine seems to be in Toscanini mode, so the event moves right along and the orchestra is blisteringly vivid.

So if you love ""Otello"" don't miss this version - and if you've never seen it, this will spoil you - good or bad as that last fact might be, - its a must have.",1399075200,2,2160,4.3793969849246235

4594497,5,B00579EKXC,"Of all the Otello video's I've seen, this is definitely the best.  This is a must have for any serious opera lover.
I highly recommend this performance.",1386979200,,152,4.62962962962963
4594498,4,B00579EKXC,"When I purchased this DVD I was hoping the opening storm would document one of the most powerful special effects ever staged on the Mets stage.  I was thrilled at the premiere of this Zeffirelli production and completely convinced that a storm was raging upon the stage of the Met.  I was disappointed that it was barely visible in this video.  But this was shot with the available live video technology of the late 1970s therefore concessions have to be made.  Despite that, this is an excellent document of one of Jon Vickerss greatest roles.  He's far better here in a live performance than he was in the von Karajan video of the opera.  I have been a long standing fan of this fascinating and complex tenor and heard him in all of his roles once the Met moved to Lincoln Center.  I loved the dark and rich tone and his presence on stage made it impossible to pay attention to anyone else.  The man was built like a redwood tree and the depth he gave to his roles were remarkable.  He, as they say with great homage, spilled blood on the stage.  In those days, fans could go backstage after performances to get autographs.  But visiting Vickers in his dressing room was more than just getting his autograph.  He patiently spent time with a roomful of fans, fielding questions about the role and the opera he had just sung.  To this day, I cannot figure out where he had the energy in reserve to graciously allow us to all chat with him.  He had more than just a working knowledge of what he was singing.  He also enriched his repertory with the tenor lead in ""Jenufa"" and ""The Bartered Bride"".  In this live performance, he's far better than he is in the studio version for von Karajan.  I was so fortunate to hear this great tenor live.  What a great artist.

At this point in his career, Cornell MacNeil was having a career renaissance overcoming the wobble that plagued his voice in the 1960s.  Hes back in excellent shape and thanks to James Levine, he ended up, and deservedly so, the leading house baritone.  In this performance of Otello theres still plenty of tonal beauty and the type of breath control needed to successfully sing the Verdi roles and with high notes to spare.  His two recordings for Decca, Fanciulla del West and his signature role of Rigoletto, are excellent examples of his finest work.

Im leaving the prima donna for last for several reasons.  For one thing, Renata Scottos voice was rather lightweight for the role of Desdemona which is mistakenly in the lyric soprano territory.  Although she sings the role skillfully, she cannot hide the fact that this was a wide stretch for her.  The need for a spinto or dramatic soprano are evident in the second and third acts although she sings an effective Willow Song where shes at her best.  Noted as an excellent singing actress, Scotto is rather insipid and mannered here.  She doesnt give a bad performance but neither does she give a great one when measured up to Vickers and/or MacNeil.  Also the strain in her upper voice stands out and is exposed for most of the opera although I think Desdemona's music never goes above a b flat..  I had heard Scotto in her prime at the Met as Lucia, Annina and Violetta but shes past her prime here and its obvious that her future performances at the Met would be marred by an annoying edge that was to become a painful experience to hear.  Too bad Freni was not available, who by this time, had developed into a spinto soprano while maintaining a gorgeous sounding voice.

With all that said, this is a fine video performance dominated by the male singers and the magnificently conducting by the young James Levine who whips the orchestra up in a frenzy down to delicate piano playing.  The chorus is a little ragged here and there.",1386633600,7,3756,4.541666666666667
4594499,5,B00579EKXC,Vickers is a great Otello. He was such a great singer and I miss him on the opera stage. I heard Scotto many times when she was beyong her prime. Her Desdemona in her prime is magnificient. I will look for more recordings of this vintage. I realize now why she is much praised.,1368057600,,277,4.148148148148148
4594500,4,B00579EKXC,The only thing I do not like is that the scene selection seems to be hard to navigate.  It arrived in great shape and on time.,1365638400,,126,3.8461538461538463
4594501,5,B00579EKXC,"An outstanding production.  Vickers is a powerful, moving Othello.  The rest of the cast is fully and vocally involved as was the production, filming and settings.  My only problem on my playback unit, the third act scene with its complex lines for the characters, and large chorus interplay was too unclear to follow the lines and central effect of these glorious sonic moments  in the audio reproduction.  The climax's impact was diminished,  All else, makes this a ""must"" for all who love this work.  It really can't get much better than this.",1362528000,,546,4.869565217391305
4594502,5,B00579EKXC,"Jon Vickers is considered the finest helden tenor of the 20th century, and was the master of the role of ""Otello,"" a role very few tenors attempt due to its difficulty. But oh, when you experience Vickers' Otello, you'll find others lacking. Vickers filmed two Otellos, one as a regular movie format, and this one, which is a live performance at the Metropolitan Opera. This is the one you want. Don't bother with the other. This performance is truly electric. And Renata Scotto as Desdemona is at her best, with great chemistry with Vickers. Placido Domingo's DVD of Otello is very fine, but Vickers' is the stuff of greatness, and irreplaceable. Live, it can make your hair stand on end - which it should. This is, as I said, the Definitive Otello.",1354233600,2,750,4.6893939393939394
4594503,4,B00579EKXC,"As so often with Amazon, one has no idea what other reviewers are actually reviewing, or what the company is actually selling. This is unquestionably the 1978 performance at the Met conducted by a relatively young James Levine. On the Sony label, it appears to be taken from a telecast that was presumably broadcast live, and the price is around $15. There are 7 client reviews attached, 5 of which award 5 stars. Just below, you will find what seems to be the identical performance with no provenance indicated, associated with 9 reviews ( all of them 5-star), and costing all of $30. Let me make it clear that my comments are directed to the first version described above. There is quite stiff opposition in the Otello stakes, the favourite contender being the later Met performance with Placido Domingo and Renee Fleming, with Levine once again stirring things up from the Orchestra pit. As I have this performance also, I can best help my fellow clients by comparing the two. Domingo unquestionably has the lovelier voice, and acts the role in the ""Italian"" manner as is appropriate for a Verdi opera. But Otello was not Italian, and the gruff persona of Vickers is more characteristic of Shakespeare's ""noble savage"", while his rasping intonation more vividly conveys the Moor's angst than the more mellifluous Domingo. Indeed his performance is reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's famous portrayal of the hero as a lisping shambling negro in the National Theatre production that was subsequently filmed. Except that Vickers gives him a great deal more majesty than Olivier did. After living with Renee Fleming's moving portrayal of Desdemona for several years before my recent purchase of the older version, I was not looking forward to hearing her replaced by an ageing Scotto, but Renata's performance is truly remarkable and surpasses that of her younger rival, both in vocal brilliance and her success in conveying every nuance of Desdemona's youth, simplicity and purity ( and perhaps also stupidity). The two Iagos also present a contrast. James Morris ( a superb Lodovico in the 1978 performance) invests the villain with intelligence and dignity, making him all the more plausible, whereas Cornell Macneil, while not lacking intellect, prefers to emphasize his outright evil, but at the cost of some histrionic interludes. As with the tenors, I prefer the magisterial voice of Morris, with its velvety bloom, to that of the gruffer Macneil. The lesser characters are equally good in both versions, but I found the Cassio of Raymond Gibbs to be head-and-shoulders above any other I have heard on stage or screen, both in voice as well as stage presence. Levine and the orchestra sound better on the later recording due to superior technical and performance features, but the earlier disc is more than satisfactory in both respects.

The credits and the booklets provided with both sets are vague about those responsible for the production and filming. The 1978 version appears to be a revival of an original Zeffirelli production, but the great John Dexter is linked with the actual stage production, and Kirk Browning with the unexciting film direction that focuses relentlessly on the stage action, and has the gloomiest lighting I have ever seen in any opera. The later production is credited to Elijah Moshinsky, and the camera work to Brian Large, whose loving cameos of the conductor and his instrumentalists add much to the visual pleasure of the experience. This race is something of a photo-finish, but the camera certainly favours the Domingo version, and overall this has a more contemporary technical feel to it. It is more expensive than the $15 1978 performance and on that basis the latter represents better value if price is an important factor. I would love to hear from someone who owns the $30 copy of this disc. The commercial movie version made by Zeffirelli, also starring Domingo, is a terrific piece of musical entertainment, but regrettably it has sufficient cuts to offend the Verdi purist. I am glad to have both of the Met versions, but the performance I continue to enjoy best of all is the old Toscannini NBC recording still available on CD where the heroic Ramon Vinay sings the Moor as never before or since.",1341100800,5,4251,4.987323943661972
4594504,2,B00579EKXC,"Bored out of my mind.  Understand this was one of Verdi's last two operas, the other being ""Falstaff"", came out of retirement to write them, and was greatly influenced by Wagner. Wagner is insidious!  AND bombastic, tuneless and dull!

Had seen it before (years ago) with I think Domingo on TV.  (All info in these comments is doubtful,except the tedium.)  I remember being bored then too, but remembered in the last act Otello says something like, ""Jove has one more thunderbolt"" and hurls some sword or lance into Iago.  Also remember Otello chasing Desdemona around a bed and her shouting ""One more year!"" ""No!' ""Month!"" ""No!' ""Day!"" ""No!' ""Prayer!"" ""No!"" - and thought it was one of the silliest things I'd ever seen.

Desdemona's double-aria in the last act is the only beautiful music I found in this thing.  BTW, the beginning reminds me of the beginning of Wagner's ""Dutchman"".

That said, the acting (Iago in particular sent chills up my spine!), the subtitles and the plot (Shakespeare's) were fascinatng and gripping.

And now I am shutting this miserable thing off and throwing it away.

I only bought it because of the great reviews and because I was and am desperate for a new pre-Puccini opera.  There aren't that many good composers of operas (none post-Puccini), and those few didn't write that many good ones.

I gave it 2 stars for the plot, the acting and the subtitles.",1336780800,,1390,4.7899159663865545
4594505,5,B00579EKXC,"Visually an exciting production and a conductor who clearly loves this wonderful score. Singers in minor roles are more than adequate (apart from a weak Roderigo) but this opera stands or falls by the three principals. MacNeil is a great Iago. He carries his darkness with him at all times and his voice is superbly responsive to the changing facets of his music. Iago is a role that can disappear under snarls and pantomime wickedness but it only works if it makes sense that others fail to see his machinations and in this, the baritone is totally convincing. Desdemona needs some charisma or else she can easily become a dramatic cipher. Scotto is a positive and fascinating presence, willing to challenge her husband in her pleading but ultimately too weak to escape being crushed by his raging jealousy. The extended solo scene in the last act can become overlong in less artistic hands but here I was genuinely rivetted by her artistry and involved in her desperate fear of annihilation. Her voice, never traditionally beautiful stamps personality through a musical artistry that expresses all Desdemona's emotions. Finally, at the opera's centre we have Vickers. It has often been said that he is an elemental force rather than just a tenor. He is admittedly unlike almost every tenor there has ever been. His is not the shining bronzed voice of Del Monaco or the rich red voice of Domingo. His highest notes are, as Steane said 'not easily won'. Yet his artistry rests upon the possibility that just this once what you see and hear is actual and true. His grief is unbearable, his anger terrible and his downfall tragic and awful. When he challenges Desdemona in the Act 3 duet he is also terrifying and Scotto herself looks momentarily (and understandably) frightened. If his performance could be described in words then it would make nonsense of his artistic achievement. If you can bear it, buy this. It really is a remarkable performance that for me, at least,stands alone as Verdi's intended creation. Now look at the price! Get it!",1331769600,5,2045,4.862464183381089
4594506,3,B00579EKXC,"I am a fan of Jon Vickers, and I often enjoy Scotto's recordings, but here Vickers is not in best voice (sounds like he has a bit of a cold), and Scotto does too much of her piano, so she is hard to hear quite a bit of the time.  Only MacNeil is in magnificent voice in this recording.  And the make-up and costume department were determined to make Vickers look ridiculous - I did make it through the Act three confrontation between Otello and Desdemona, and it was quite powerful, but after that I quit, because I have a much better live recording with Vickers from the Met with Zylis-Gara, and Quilico, where everyone sounds great, and if I want to watch a video of Otello, I would much rather see Domingo.",1327881600,11,709,4.323308270676692
4594507,5,B00579EKXC,"This performance of Verdi's Otello is excellent.  Jon Vickers' portrayal of Otello is far beyond ""believable."" He is a sensitive and intelligent singer who's account of the Moor is moving and convincing; you could ""feel"" Otello at every turn.  The role is well sung.  While I don't generally like the timbre of the voice, Vickers is able to make me go beyond the sound itself. His is a first-rate interpretation of this extremely difficult role.

Renata Scotto's Desdemona is moving.  Vocally, it is wonderful.  She is involved on all levels.  Her interpretations of the Act IV arias are exemplary.  She moved me to tears and doing so, she showed what role interpretation is all about. The listener has a front row seat throughout the drama.

Cornell MacNiel is an excellent baritone.  His voice is well suited for this role. I believe his interpretation lacks the involvement shown by Vickers and Scotto. It is a solid performance but not much beyond.

James Levine conducts a spirited performance that adds drama.

If you chose this performance of Otello you didn't go wrong.  This is one of the very best and I highly recommend it.",1324512000,7,1134,4.84375
4594508,5,B00579EKXC,"Many of us have been waiting for this 1978 performance from the Metropolitan Opera to be commercially published. It stars Jon Vickers, Renata Scotto, and Cornell MacNeil, at the height of their artistic powers.

Vickers' Otello is overwhelming in its intensity, even ferocity. Every gesture is choreographed to maximum effect; this video may be the most striking example of his acting ability. One can easily see the influence of both Wieland Wagner and Maria Callas on his unique plastique. Vocally, even though he was over fifty years old, the tenor surmounts every difficulty in the score. His studio film of 1973-74 of the same opera is simply not to be compared to this ""live"" performance.

Scotto is also at her finest in this performance. Most Desdemonas are pallid compared to this intense conception of the role. In the ""Ave Maria,"" she reaches the level of the sublime. This was, incidentally, her only performances in the theatre opposite Vickers.

MacNeil, while not quite in the same exalted league as the tenor and soprano, is a frightening Iago, with his thundering voice. None of these three singers had a ""beautiful"" voice. In fact, when the young James Morris enters as Lodovico, one is struck by the sheer beauty of his sound. Instead, the three leads give you a transcendent performance, one that will haunt you for a lifetime.

James Levine conducts with great energy, but the staging was originally done by Franco Zeffirelli. It looks no different than what one sees in the provincial houses in America, excepting the fact that the sets and costumes probably cost a great deal of money. As Zeffirelli told Vickers' biographer, Jeannie Williams, in 1999, ""I don't consider it my best production at the Met.""",1316044800,30,1728,4.968858131487889
8460415,5,B00579EKXC,"Full disclosure: Scotto has never been one my favorite sopranos, but she is wonderful here, both vocally and dramatically.  Vickers is magnificent--genuinely scary and pitiable at the same time.  McNeil makes Iago convincing.  The print isn't everything one could wish, but the singers all draw the audience into the action.  A marvelous performance.",1525305600,,350,5.547169811320755
8460416,5,B00579EKXC,"Any opera performance with Jon Vickers is magnificent and Otello especially so.  The rest of the cast is excellent, as are the sets, costumes, and direction. About forty years ago I managed to get a ticket to hear Jon Vickers in person at the Metropolitan Opera.  Unfortunately, just before the performance started it was announced that Mr. Vickers was indisposed.  The performance was excellent, but I never got to hear Jon Vickers in person, only on recordings, radio, and now this dvd. Thank you.",1522195200,,499,4.916666666666667
8460417,5,B00579EKXC,I saw this performance live at the Met.  Vickers almost makes you forget Domingo.  His acting is very real and felt throughout.  This production by Zeffirelli is so much more beautiful than the current disaster where all the characters seem to be living in glass houses and are present even when they are not supposed to.  Scotto was in great voice at this point in her career and she plays a very strong Desdimona.  Levine excells.,1497657600,,432,4.631578947368421
8460418,4,B00579EKXC,"I attended one of these Vickers/Scotto performances, but before I knew much about opera. This is a great performance. Vickers is truly terrifying as the towering leader brought low by malice. Scotto is a riveting Desdemona. She doesn't take her destiny lying down. MacNeil however overacts the villainous Iago. Why would Otello believe him? As for the singing, Vickers gives everything he has, but I prefer Domingo (his voice is far more beautiful, and he's a more wounded hero than a ferocious one). Scotto sings a beautiful Verdi line, especially her famous pianissimo, and she makes you believe it's really happening before your eyes. Fleming and Te Kanawa, on other DVDs, sing far more beautifully, but they're very simple characterizations (although Verdi said that's what he wanted). I highly recommend this DVD, but I'd buy Domingo/Fleming or Domingo/Te Kanawa as my first choice.",1489881600,,887,5.20979020979021

8460420,5,B00579EKXC,"Forget all other ""Otello"" performances on DVD. This is the one to have -- and it's bargain-priced to boot! Unlike his rather studied film with Herbert von Karajan, here Jon Vickers is captured at full electricity. For all the gravitas of his demeanor, he's a dangerous Otello: When he pulls a sword on Desdemona in Act III, one fears he will kill her on the spot. Aside from a passing frog-in-the-throat moment, this is a heroic-voiced Otello in the grand lineage of Giovanni Martinelli and Ramon Vinay. (Placido Domingo's longstanding monopoly on Otello at the Met only sharpened one's nostalgia for Vickers.) ""Dio, mi potevi scalgiar"" is a master class in the delivery of that pivotal solo, although almost every phrase Vickers utters is freshly imagined and revelatory. Kirk Browning's direction of the telecast is alive to nuance: Vickers' facial reactions during the Act II chorus in praise of Desdemona are a capsule history of their relationship.

Vickers finds a like-minded Desdemona in Renata Scotto. Not only is she the very image of bewildered virtue, she's heard in full lyric-soprano bloom, before ventures into the spinto repertory would strip the nap from her voice. Cornell MacNeil is heard in good late-career form, the tone compact and on target, although some of Iago's more intricate writing is no longer his to command. Raymond Gibbs' Cassio and Jean Kraft's Emilia are well-nigh perfect and James Morris' Lodovico delivers an early promissory note on decades of greatness to come. In the score he conducted perhaps better than any other, James Levine leads the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra with pinpoint precision and intense pictorial detail (like the serpentine bassoon writing that underlines Iago's villainy) while working hand-in-glove with the singers.

Franco Zeffirelli's set are sometimes swallowed up in murk -- this was an early Metropolitan Opera telecast, after all -- but that's a small price to pay for a performance of such volatility. Peter J. Hall's richly, brocaded costumes, however, are captured in loving detail. The Met would go on to telecast ""Otello"" three more times (once with Morris as Iago) but one need look no farther than here. If I could give this 10 stars, I would.",1458518400,4,2222,5.118457300275482

8460422,3,B00579EKXC,"I would not be one to quibble about the musical merits of Vickers, Scotto, and MacNeil in performing Otello.  And the price of $10 is certainly well worth the purchase.  But I don't think it should be one's first, or even second DVD of Otello.  It was taped in 1978, which was frankly the stone age of video recording at the Met.  It's way too dark, the camera is frequently out of focus, the color changes between different cameras, and the directional microphones are sometimes not pointed in the right direction.

I'm not saying the recording has no value, not at all.  Otello is an extremely powerful opera, in fact it is probably the most emotionally gut-wrenching opera I know.  But this is not the only performance, and I would go on to say it is not the greatest on DVD.  I suspect nostalgia for all things 40 years old has a lot to do with the frenzy.  (Does the same enthusiasm apply to the Vickers audio-only CDs?  If not, why not?)

The Metropolitan Opera itself must agree this is a visually problematic experience.  After all, it is their own marketing geniuses that changed the DVD cover art.  It used to show a stillshot of Mr. Vickers and Miss Scotto on stage, and I must say, even aside from being darkish it was an extremely unflattering portrait of both.  Now the Met has taken that away and substituted a well-lit, dynamic pose of the young maestro James Levine.  (I wonder if Levine ever thought he were more visually pleasing than Jon Vickers and Renata Scotto??????????????????)

Anyway, if video is what you need (and I agree, I like a good video) ... there are at least three other DVDs I would be more inclined to recommend for pure theatrical, emotional, and musical enjoyment of Verdi's Otello.
