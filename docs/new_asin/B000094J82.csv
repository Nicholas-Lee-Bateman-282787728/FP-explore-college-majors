It's only a 3-camera affair but the performance is so good and so inspired only the dead will not find themselves tapping their feets to the incredible groove. The picture is crystal-clear at a fixed 7.1 Mbps bitrate. Good edition too. The focus is mainly on Mr. Carlos and individual shots of the musicians are not very abundant but you can see the whole stage clearly all the time. Guitarwork is wicked.

 No clue as to what year this has been recorded but judging from the other DVDs of this series it might been around '98. It has 2.0 and a 5.1 option that are selectable from the menu but I did not try surround since I loathe it for music.

The sound -if dolby digital 192 Kbps instead of LPCM- is excellent; every instrument you see playing has its correspondent sonic counterpart and pinpointing them on the stereo soundscape is easy since the mix is almost perfect.

Now for the not so few drawbacks :

1- Song selection is only available from the menu and the menu is a bitch to navigate. It does not work right away; you have to get your way around it to make it work, and it is very hard. The dvd is authored in one title with no chapters, so jumping from one song to another is not an option. No timetable could be displayed at any given moment so no duration of the chapter or titles is provided. The songs don't have a correlation, that is to say they are just put together one after the other just going to black so there is no sensation of wholeness to the show, but  really did not care. The gig clocks in at a hair under an hour according to my computer. Extras are one song from the show with heavy psychidelic chroma effects applied and a slighty different sound mix and an extensive photogallery. The rest is a catalogue of the label's releases and a bio/discog of Donald Mc Carlos.

2-Pic : the pic is very small; it does not fill the 4:3 box and has big blackbars all around it, so it is basically a small 4:3 pic inside a standard 4:3 box; not a problem if you have a big TV but annoying if you don't.

3-Sound : bass guitars are mixed high on reggae music, but this one is so ridiculously loudly mixed-in that when cranked up (OK, maybe too loud) the clipping protection on my amp kept chopping up the music till I turned it down to a more reasonable level. Given the high efficiency of my speakers (96 db/w/m)and good bass management on the part of my sub, a good level was achieved, but on standard speakers and no sub, the bass guitar will prolly muddy all up and distort the output.

All in all quite a surprise and a cool addition to my collection. Performance and filming : 5 stars. DVD authoring : 3 stars",1346976000,,2709,4.265107212475634

I would definitely recommend this one, especially for those of you (like me) who really enjoy some good horns in their reggae fare.",1198195200,2,290,4.705882352941177
7989295,4,B000094J82,"I enjoy this DVD, the music is over my expecteations, but it has some things I don't like.

The root menu seems to have some kind of problem, cause when you want to enter to some items yakes too much time, and frecuently do not enter, like in the songs selecction. I must say I tray it in some different player and in computers but remains the same.

Another thing is that the songs are cut off, when the songs ends, the screen fade away, both image and sound, so it takes continuity to the concert.

That's all.

Than you.
