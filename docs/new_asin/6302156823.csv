432608,4,6302156823,See Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger on screen together for the first time in a comical and heart-warming rendition of the classic boy-meets-girl story - with an enormous twist! The plot is brilliantly funny and the supporting  cast includes Paul Reiser. Kim and Alec are superb together - great actors.  The Marrying Man is a definite Must See!,918172800,2,342,4.879310344827586

432707,5,6302156823,"I have bought 4 copies of this movie since it first came out. The first was on a laser disc. I loved Kim's singing and acting as a nightclub singer in the 50's. I wonder why she did not do more singing of ""standards""? I would have bought every CD she recorded. I have added her album to my I-Tunes collection, although I-Tunes dies not sell it (Big Mistake).

Her nightclub performances in the movie, like Michelle Pfeiffer's siding off the black piano in ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" are two scenes forever seared into my memory.

What a gal Kim Bassinger is. No wonder Alec Baldwin fell in love with her again and again. I don't blame him at all.",1451088000,,645,4.366666666666666

432811,4,6302156823,"i really enjoyed it. It was a funny movie and the cast was great. Both of my adult children did not think they would like it,however they thought it was just the kind of movie that takes your thoughts away from all the tragic events in life and you get swept into the comedy,leaving you laughing moments for a couple of days",1355875200,,324,4.241935483870968

She is so nice to look at. It's a fun movie to watch, if you like Kim, or for you ladies, Alec. I can't compare it to the dvd quality as I have never seen it in this format, but the blu-ray is pretty nice & the price is right too. I say if you like Kim or Alec go ahead & get this. You will probably like it too. I can't believe how really good Kim sang either. Really unexpectedly nice. Did I mention how NICE Kim looked !!!!!!!",1351036800,3,591,3.774193548387097

432829,4,6302156823,"This adaptation of Neil Simon's play will never be a classic film, but if you can get it cheap, I recommend it highly.  There are worse romantic comedies you could waste your time on, but this one is nostalgic and genuinely glamourous fun.  It's a great escape from all the current situation settings in similar films.

Charlie Pearl (Alec Baldwin), multi-millionaire, is about to marry movie honcho Lou Horner's (Robert Loggia) daughter until his friends take him to Vegas for a bachelor party, and he falls for club singer Vickie Anderson (Kim Basinger), who also happens to be Bugsy Siegel's (Armand Assante) girlfriend.  It's a wild ride between a millionaire playboy and a fast nightclub singer that involves 4 marriages and 3 divorces.  It won't change your world, but it certainly is fun, the costumes are excellent, and the soundtrack is among my favorites.  Check it out.",1156291200,2,880,4.9523809523809526

Things get a bit complicated when six days before the wedding he goes to Las Vegas with his buddies only to stumble upon the woman of his dreams...
Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger carry out their performances very well, though the supporting cast members could have been a little better.
The setting, the plot, and the dialogues are all wonderful!
As for the rating, it should have been PG-13.  Why was it rated R???
In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.",1154476800,,707,4.5234375

432833,5,6302156823,"Before they became now-divorced husband and wife in real life,Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger are an on-and-off married couple. More times then Robert Wagner and the late Natalie Wood. Charley Pearl(Baldwin),whose family manufactures Pearl Drops tooth polish(a real product),is a romantic swinger who falls in love with a lounge singer(Basinger). Charley is actually engaged to Adele Horner(Elisabeth Shue) whose father Lew(Robert Loggia) owns a movie studio. The Charley-Adele wedding has been called off after the 400+ sent invitations. However,the wedding was called off before Charley and the singer married for the first of five times. When the union made headlines,it angered Lew and brought tears to Adele. Lew is so pissed at Charley that Lew wants to kill Charley. Adele thought and hoped Charley would come back to her but no such luck. Charley and the singer ended buying and moving into Lew's home. Hey,do you think it's possible that Baldwin and Basinger will become husband and wife four more times in real life just like in this film? Wagner's and Wood's first marriage ended in divorce. They both remarried and divorced others,once respectively,before remarrying a second time. The second marriage ended in 1981 with Wood's drowning death.",1111536000,,1253,5.333333333333333
432834,5,6302156823,"Let me start off by saying that my 5-star rating is for Kim Basinger's singing of these fantastic old songs.  The DVD itself boasts no real extra features, so it deserves 3 stars at best.  Toward the end of the film, I experience a few glitches, but that may simply be with my dvd player--you may not have the same problem with yours.
The film is charming.  It is predictable, but still an enjoyable experience, thanks mainly to Kim Basinger.  (By the way, I was not a fan of her at all until I saw her in this film.)  Her performances of songs like ""Let's Do It"" and ""Honeysuckle Rose"" may be considered too sexy by purists, but considering modern sensibilities and the fact that she is supposed to be singing in a Las Vegas club in the fifties (the decade of Marilyn Monroe), I think her approach is perfectly fine.  Her ""stage presence"" during these numbers is scintillating--I would love to see her perform music like this live in concert.  The musical arrangements are fantastic also.",1052438400,8,989,4.553672316384181
432835,3,6302156823,"The review title I gave The Marrying Man pretty much says it all. I was curious to see what was going to happen to the characters in the movie from beginning to end. I won't give any spoliers. All I can say is that you need to watch this movie for yourself. Though it might not be one of Kim Basinger's or Alec Baldwin's best films, I'm willing to bet that you will be entertained from start to finish as I was.",1049932800,3,411,4.024390243902439
432836,4,6302156823,"Based on a true story, The Marrying Man tells the story of Charlie Pearl (Baldwin) and Vicki Anderson (Basinger), he a rich playboy, she a Vegas lounge singer and girlfriend of gangster Bugsy Siegel.  They love, fight,  marry. Four times. Funny one-liners, great cast, fantastic songs and an  authentic recreation of the glamorous late 1940's, early 1950's era are all  propelled by real life husband and wife team Baldwin and Basinger's  brilliant screen chemistry. The couple fell in love on the set- and it  shows.  Their portrayal of a couple whose sizzling heat fuels a love-hate  relationship which takes over and nearly destroys their lives is backed up  and given light relief by the perfectly chosen comedic supporting cast.  Fisher Stevens and Paul Reiser feature as some of Charlie's struggling  Hollywood friends, Reiser giving a wry narrative throughout which aids in  the films continuity and light tone.  Armand Assante, as Bugsy Siegel with  an ironic sense of humor, delivers a refreshing and different slant on the  usual movie gangsters.  Robert Logia is fantastic and funny as the  aggressive and egotistical movie studio owner and Elisabeth Shue is  terrific as his neurotic and spoiled daughter, engaged to Charlie, but who  is no match for sexy songstress Vicki.  Basinger who did all of her own  singing, gives a knock-out performance as the talented and ambitious  singer. Her delivery- sexy, suggestive, vibrant- is perfect.  In a sleazy  Vegas casino, Charlie and his friends' first sight of her back-lit, curvy  figure and the sound of her throbbing voice causes the stuttered and dazed  reaction of: ""she has great ....... phrasing"" to which Reiser's  character replies, ""Oh yeah, the first thing I noticed when we walked  in here was her phrasing"".  The cast, atmosphere and the on-screen  heat with her leading man all make the film an enjoyable whole.  But it is  Basinger's transformation of Vicki's whole persona and performing style,  from initially ambitious, brassy and slightly trashy, to sophisticated,  worldly, and mellow in a perfectly honed performance that really helps make  the film memorable.",951782400,11,2139,5.1911764705882355
