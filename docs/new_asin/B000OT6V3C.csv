2799434,5,B000OT6V3C,"Have all 3 seasons, can't wait to watch them cuz this noval is awsome even though its about teenagers in a who are rich and poor and how some become members of a band",1336089600,,166,3.911764705882353
2799435,4,B000OT6V3C,The DVD arrived just as I was finishing up the first two seasons. The DVD was as described. I have no complaints. I would have given it 5 stars if it had come early.,1284163200,,165,3.8823529411764706
2799436,5,B000OT6V3C,I finally purchased this DVD. Love IT! They did cut a few scenes but I'm happy and its what I would definetly will rewatch and I'll never get bored rewatching it again and again.:),1278806400,4,180,4.323529411764706
2799437,5,B000OT6V3C,"I got the first DVDs damages, but Amazon replaced them and got new DVDs the next day ;)

Love the DVDs quality.",1195689600,,111,4.045454545454546
2799438,5,B000OT6V3C,"I love Rebelde and so this DVD was a must for my collection. Just like the other two seasons it does not include every episode however, it summarizes the entire season. The ending is phenomenal and you'll watch it from start to finish without stopping.",1192924800,3,252,4.622222222222222
2799439,5,B000OT6V3C,"This was definitely the best season of Rebelde, also the most well made.  The other seasons on DVD were very choppy and it was hard to follow what was going on if you hadn't seen it before, but this one is indefinitely better, but not completely.  It is a very heartfelt season where the couples start to come together for the last time :)  If you like this show, I recommend RBD:La Familia  It appears on Univision, so look for it.  It follows the band, and is very well made (the first Mexican tv series to be made in HD)",1191974400,3,523,4.19
2799440,5,B000OT6V3C,I first off what to say that I loved the dvd It was everything I expected. However when I first played the dvd in my DVD/VCR player it froze on cd 1 side one and once again on cd 2 side 2 when I played it on the computer DVD Player it didn't freeze. I loved the quality of the CD's and I appreciate the quick arrival.,1184630400,,317,3.746268656716418
2799441,4,B000OT6V3C,"Like I bought the bootleg version of this DVD Set, because...

Y I DIDNT LIKE IT
I had seen that the cover had looked differently and the back was a picture of Maite (Lupita) (like in the other 2 seasons there was a pic of Anahi-Mia [Season 1] and Dulce Maria-Roberta [Season 2]) on the back of the DVD along with the story summary...or watever it's called.  NOT THE PICTURE OF RBD: LIVE IN HOLLWOOD

THE EXTRAS
There were gonna be extras that included videos along with the extras that there are in this one (Galeria, Trayectorias, English Subtitles, ""Los Mejores Pleitos"" & ""Las Mejores Escenas de Amor"" or something like that)

THE MENUS
In the menus there's the same picture as in the back (but bigger.  The song on side on of discs 1, 2 and 3 is ""Rebelde-En Vivo"" and the song on side 2 of discs 1, 2 and 3 is ""Tras De Mi"".  There are like bacground ""videos"" but you can barely see them, behind the picture

I don't even know why there are english subtitles, in the other seasons didn't, so why did this one

Im gonna try to put ALL 3 ORIGINAL seasons [of ""Rebelde""] that came out (in Mexico, of course) and maybe even the back covers if I can to show u what it sould look like",1184544000,2,1182,4.222222222222222

It came in perfect condition factory sealed, no scratches. I'm super satisfied! I knew from the beginning it wasn't the full series but as a fan who came to around to loving it again, its worth having as a collector's item",1441929600,2,365,4.154929577464789
8186577,4,B000OT6V3C,"I really liked this DVD set, it is an awesome product. Rebelde is one my favorite shows, and season 3 is amazing. I was just disappointing that they cut a lot of Diego and Roberta's scenes. I know that there is no way to get everything in but. they cut a lot of scenes that I wanted to know what they were saying in, because I have only seen clips on youtube for season 2&3. There was one I was particularly looking forward to that was completely cut. However, they do a good job covering the plot of the season other than an hour just for one sports match that could have been cut down in order to fit more of the stuff that was cut.",1441065600,4,634,4.0396825396825395
