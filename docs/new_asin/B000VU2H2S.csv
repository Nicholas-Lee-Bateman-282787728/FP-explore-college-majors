The DVD showed the Bosphorus, the Grand Bazaar and the Hagia Sophia Museum but I was more interested in seeing the details of the blue Iznik tiles in the Mosque and this did not happen. The tiles are its charm and drawcard.  After all, one mosque in Istanbul looks like another.  The DVD was very disappointing.",1432512000,,416,4.594594594594595

Besides the money shots of ceiling tiles, the history provided set the right tone to appreciate this masterpiece.  See you in Istanbul!
