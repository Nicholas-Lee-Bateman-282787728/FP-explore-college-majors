2556244,5,B000F9RL9Y,"Great information.  Because of the number of years ago these were produced, not all the information is accurate - some attractions/sites are closed; gone; etc.  A couple of things have actually re-opened!!  Great to have the information before going on your trip.  We drove Route 66 from Sept. 7-23, 2011 - so glad we watched the DVD set before we left.",1319414400,,353,4.737704918032787
2556245,5,B000F9RL9Y,"This is one WONDERFUL DVD!!!! It is the ULTIMATE!!!

Would like to follow what is left of the Route.",1313280000,,145,4.84
2556246,3,B000F9RL9Y,"I expected better things from Michael Wallis than this mish-mash of disjointed bits from along the mother road. I'm certainly glad that I didn't pay more for this set because it simply didn't have the ""goods"". There is another 5-disc DVD set available which is a far better resource for anyone wanting to drive the old road. Disc 1 is okay, but disc 2 is a 30 minute waste of time and really a disappointment. Disc 3 included a visit to an ""Exotic Dance Museum"" which I felt was inappropriate and not even part of the old road. While I appreciated the updates on ""favorite"" road sights, there weren't enough of them.  Far too much of Wallis' ramblings about some lost or forgotten spots. I'm more interested in what to expect if I traveled today. I have traveled most of the route over my lifetime and feel this was a waste of money and time.",1295222400,26,842,4.432258064516129
2556247,5,B000F9RL9Y,Took a motorcoach group on parts of Route 66 from Illinois to Flagstaff... and used this DVD to inform and relive the journey while on 66.... It was prefect to enhance our experience!!!,1267833600,,185,4.636363636363637
2556248,5,B000F9RL9Y,Michael Wallis is the premier research for Route 66 and anything he puts out about the road should not be missed.  Disc 1 and Disc 3 particularly have good information.  I felt like Disc 2 was something he put out because he some leftover footage from the first disc and needed some extra money.  But I watched anyway because he did visit some places that weren't on the first one.  Group this DVD set with his book and the 8-map set and you're ready to hit the road.,1243555200,2,467,4.2727272727272725
2556249,4,B000F9RL9Y,"OK, here we have 3 DVDs ca. 1994, 1995 and 2000. They are full of historical information, nostalgia and local color. Makes you want to load up the old station wagon and hit the (Mother) road. They are all well organized, East to West, and vary in content enough to be a great value at $17.99 to someone with an interest in such things.

Disc One is a fine ride. Disc Two rolls along nicely as well until you cross into California and then the ambush. At this point we are ushered into an admitted side trip detour to ""the most intriguing of the new museums"", an alternate venue called Exotic World. Here we are given a ""brief"" tour through a burlesque museum complete with some old B&W photos of bare breasted strippers of days gone by. The tour is hosted by a remnant of the bygone era in an outfit that shows way too much geriatric real estate.

Disc Three is pretty much the same deal with the addition of some live shots of a striptease pageant ""for those staunch road warriors lucky enough to be traveling this way in the first weekend in........."". Yeah right.

Mr. Wallis is obviously a very smart and talented man and I'm sure that in the name of artistic license it would be perfectly permissible to include such things in a documentary of of the History of Hedonism. But in this case these excerpts represent no positive addition to the presentation and are nothing more than a couple of piles of cow plop in the middle of the Mother Road.

I guess my main complaint that for us ""non-staunch road warriors"" there was no reference to this material anywhere on the DVDs or packaging. One might quip, ""There's nothing worse than you see on TV."" Well I don't watch it either, because I know what to expect. Watch you step!",1234224000,31,1728,4.441640378548896
2556250,5,B000F9RL9Y,"This was a wonderful DVD of the Mother Road, it's reason for being built, the people and places that make it truly the Road of the Nation. I highly recommend this DVD for all the roadies out there and future roadies. There is history, plus the personal stories and interviews that make the road more real, not just a means to get from one place to another...",1196899200,5,358,4.358208955223881
2556251,4,B000F9RL9Y,"Not new material, but this puts several items that I already have on VHS on to DVD, at a budget price",1162425600,4,101,3.857142857142857
2556252,5,B000F9RL9Y,"This collection is a documentary film about the legendary ""ROUTE 66: THE ULTIMATE DVD COLLECTION""...filled with historical  pictures and facts hosted by best selling author Michael Wallis (""Route 66-The Mother Road""), Linda Lewis (producer)  and Christopher Lewis (director), Suzanne Fitzgerald Wallis (photographer) . . . . . our three DVD collection spells out the history in fine form, U.S. Route 66, (also known as Route 66 or The Will Rogers Highway) was a highway in the U.S. Highway system...one of the original federal routes, US 66 was established on November 11, 1926, though signs did not go up until the following year.[1] It originally ran from Chicago, Illinois through St. Louis, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California before ending at Los Angeles for a total of 2,448 miles (3,939 km).

Route 66 underwent many improvements and realignments...most of those affected the total mileage somewhat...one of those resulted in the movement of the endpoint from Los Angeles to Santa Monica. Contrary to common belief, Route 66 never ran to the ocean; it terminated onto what was then US-101, at the intersection of what is today Lincoln Boulevard and Olympic Boulevard.

In the 1950s, Route 66 became the main highway for vacationers heading to Los Angeles...the road passed through the Painted Desert and near the Grand Canyon. Meteor Crater in Arizona was another popular stop...this sharp rise in tourism in turn gave rise to a burgeoning trade in all manner of roadside attractions including teepee shaped motels, frozen custard stands, Indian curio shops, and reptile farms. Meramec Caverns near St. Louis began advertising on barns, billing itself as the ""Jesse James hideout""...The Big Texan advertised a free 72 ounce steak dinner to anyone who could eat the whole thing in an hour...it also marked the birth of the fast-food industry: ""Red's Giant Hamburgs"" in Springfield, Missouri, site of the first drive through restaurant, and the first McDonald's in San Bernardino, California. Changes like these to the landscape further cemented 66's reputation as a near perfect microcosm of the culture of America, now linked by the automobile . . . . . what this collections gives the viewer, is a feeling that you've been there...and that my friend is the whole point.

Over the years, U.S. Route 66 received many nicknames, they are as follows:

1.  The Great Diagonal Way--Right after Route 66 was commissioned, it received

this nickname because a large section of the highway (Chicago to Oklahoma City)

ran diagonally, unlike the other highways.

2.  The Main Street of America--Advertised as such by the US Highway 66 Association

 to promote the highway. The title had also been claimed by supporters of U.S. Route 40,

but the Route 66 group was more successful.

3.  The Mother Road--Called this by John Steinbeck in ""The Grapes of Wrath"", the title

continued to be applied to the highway.

4.  The Will Rogers Highway-- ""officially"" named this by the US Highway 66 Association

in 1952. A plaque dedicating the highway to the humorist is still located opposite the western

terminus of Route 66 in Santa Monica, California. There were more plaques like this; one can

be found in Galena, Kansas. It was originally located on the Kansas-Missouri state line, but

moved to the Howard Litch Memorial Park in 2001.

2556277,5,B000F9RL9Y,"I had the original 3 tape VHS version of this since it came out back in the mid 90s, so my purchase was mostly to upgrade to DVD.  I find myself going back and watching the VHS version every year or so (until I got this version and tossed it).  Disc 1 contains the first 2 VHS tapes and covers the whole journey from Chi Town to LALA land in about 90 minutes.  It also has some extra interviews with Michael and his wife.  Disc 2 contains the third VHS tape and has more interviews and stories about Route 66.  It is not as exciting, but the Angel Delgadillo segment is worth watching (he was also featured on an episode of American Restoration/ Rick Dale on the History Channel).  The third disc from 2000 was not included in the VHS version, but it was quit informative as it provided updates on many of the Route 66 attractions (sad to hear about Pop Hicks).  This 3rd disc had a special feature on a burlesque museum which was fine, but the strip show at the end did not fit in with the rest of the product.

Since it is from the 90s, the picture quality is not great, but decent.  MIchael Wallis has a deep voice and is a great storyteller as well as author.  I have heard him narrate some shows on the History Channel as well.

Overall, a very informative DVD set on the Mother Road and with the exception of the strip show, I would recommend it.",1367452800,,1352,4.2015503875969

2556279,4,B000F9RL9Y,I recently was with a team of 8 on a missions project out in AZ. We visited sites along Route 66 and it was very nostalgic and I remember the TV show Route 66. I enjoyed watching this and want to share with my team mates too.,1352851200,,225,3.8085106382978724
2556280,1,B000F9RL9Y,This is a good dvd but why did they have to add the strippers on disc #3 ? Also in the extra features they have a longer segment of strippers ! I can't even SHARE this dvd with friends or family ! I wish they would not have ruined an otherwise enjoyable dvd.,1351987200,,258,3.8867924528301887
2556281,1,B000F9RL9Y,"Don't let the professional-looking packaging fool you.  I realized about 10 minutes into the first disc that ""Route 66: The Ultimate DVD Collection"" was a low-budget, amateur  production.  Jittery, grainy, low-res video and warbling audio gives it the feel of a bad elementary school film, and the narrator's sleep-inducing monotone voice (along with the rest of the audio) suffers from a complete lack of EQ, mixing, and mastering - very difficult to understand.  Another reviewer points out that the second disc is 30 minutes of filler, and the third disc is about an exotic dance club, unrelated to Route 66!

I cannot imagine how the other reviewers here could possibly give this rubbish more than one star.",1343174400,3,711,5.042735042735043
2556282,4,B000F9RL9Y,I found this video to be very good and well presented and most informative about route 66. It was almost as good as being there driving the old highway.,1333411200,,152,4.275862068965517

8119488,1,B000F9RL9Y,"Don't waste your money, i was hoping for something worth watching but instead i got what is at best a Betamax quality recording with a horrific monotone narration who for most of the film rambles on about complete crap.
 This was filmed in early 90's, Has nobody made a modern high quality story about Route 66? If they did they'd make a fortune. This is 2015 after all. You find better videos on You Tube and they're free. You get 3 discs, the 2nd one is a copy of the first just filmed a year or so later in the same crap quality, the 3rd disc has some garbage about an exotic dance place which has nothing to do with Rte 66.",1432771200,,627,4.139344262295082
