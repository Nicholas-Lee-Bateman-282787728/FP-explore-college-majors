1850539,1,B00008J2GU,"According to the dvd case this movie is called ""Montrosity, the Atomic Brain"". A more apt title might be ""Cheesey, More Neked Girls?"". One cannot help but notice yon mad scientist has a knack for grabbing great looking female corpse' to display in his ""atomic chamber"". The reason one cannot help but notice is that the camera is forever going back to pan these lovelies...repeatedly...up and down...again...again...yawn...again...

Usually I have a fondness for bad movies but they gotta have some redeeming value. I don't care if it's Jacqueline Lovell wandering around in snow drifts wearing nothing but leather hot pants and a gorilla mask -- SOMETHING to spark an interest in what's going on!  Oddly enough, you'd think having the cat's brain put into the girl which naturally freaks her out, would be it's saving grace. Then add to it the dog man chasing her up the...on second thought never mind. Remarkable as it sounds, even after this I couldn't get interested in the thing.

All this sad film has is semi-adequate acting, a thin script, gawd awful makeup for the dog man, and a true longing for Michael Myers to grab Lovells mask and a huge knife, ripping his way through the entire flick putting it and us out of our misery.

Don't even bother renting this stinker. It ain't even worth borrowing.",1057536000,2,1308,4.825892857142857
1850540,5,B00008J2GU,"""The Atomic Brain"" is a masterpiece! Pure schlock, held together by cheesey glue! A mad scientist (Frank Gerstle) is experimenting with brain transplants in the basement of his aged female benefactor. Dr. Frank's been robbing graves, with the help of the ""dogman"" he's created, in order to find fresh, 60s style centerfold model-type, bimbette bodies for his experiments. You see, he's working on a brain transplant that will enable the old lady upstairs to ""die"" and inherit her own fortune, in the body of a young bodacious babe! Dr. Frank has already turned one girl into a mindless zombie who roams around aimlessly, until she stumbles into the dogman and becomes puppy chow. Then, three girls are tricked into coming to the house for (fake) housekeeper interviews. One is given the brain of a cat. Unfortunately, she climbs up on the roof and won't come down! The old hag has her eye on the blond bombshell of the three. Sadly, blondie gets her eye knocked out by cat girl. So, the third woman is selected as the body for the crazy old bat's cranial goo. BTW, the Dr.s experimants are all being done by dunking folks into some tub of radioactive slime. I won't give away the ending. Let's just say it's purrrrrfect...",1052784000,4,1222,4.741784037558685
7985247,3,B00008J2GU,"This 1964 classic also known as ""Monstrosity"" starts out with ""out of tune"" horny or brassy type music. And the music keeps up until the end. There is some dialog but mostly it is a Bradford Dillman narration. On the plus side they show the pictures of the people with names attached so you get to know the actors. Bradford has made TV appearances well into the 1990's.

Mr. Hetty March (Marjorie Eaton) a rich uggy old lady has plenty of money. With the help of a rogue scientist, Dr. Otto frank (Frank Grestle) kept on retainer, she intends to have her brain (through the miracle of modern 1964 atomics), transferred into a young body. The body is to be selected from three candidates. Which one will it be? Anita from Spain, Nina from Austria, or Bea from England?
What does her aged companion think of this? Will the scientist be able to gain something from this? And do you thing the three donors suspect what awaits them?

7985249,2,B00008J2GU,"UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was not one of those movies that's so bad (like Plan 9) that it's good. It's just so slow (and with needless narration like some of Ed Wood's stuff) that I had to watch it over 4 nights as I couldn't stand to watch more than 15 or 20 minutes at a time.

I watched this on Amazon Prime - picture was poor to fair - sound was fair to good.  Plot - what there was of it - was just terrible. It involved some old crazy woman (one of the 'richest in the world') wanting to transplant her brain into a hot young female body using nuclear energy (somehow). The nuclear energy stuff was just stupid even for the time period.

And the part about putting a human brain into a cat's head was so very silly - well - it was just dumb. The 'mad' doctor must have used a lot of WD-40 to squeeze it in!!

Francis M. Gerstle (September 27, 1915  February 23, 1970) played the 'mad' doctor fairly low key - his part needed a little more energy but he did the best of any of the actors involved. He was fairly well known in the 50's and 60's for playing roles in various Sci-Fi movies and TV roles.

I rarely say this but this movie was really a waste of my time.

I would rate this a 3.5 to 4.0 out of 10.",1476403200,,1209,3.987551867219917
7985250,2,B00008J2GU,"I'm still trying to understand how the mad-mad-crazy-mad scientist (Frank Gerstle as Dr. Frank) managed to shove a human brain into a cat's skull.
In an attempt to outwit death, this self-same wacko experiments on the dead, seeking to upgrade them with a living brain, be it dog or cat.  He's in the employment of a scheming old harridan who wants a pretty body of her own in which to house her degenerate brain.  She's wealthy and she has a plan.  To that end, she kidnaps three young ladies on the pretext that they are to be her domestics.  She personally inspects each one for suitability (not just any young nubile body will do), she wants to be a bodacious babe men will drool over.  As with all sinister conspiracies, she can't rely on everyone to cooperate in the manner she expects.  An escape plan is soon hatched, her geezer gigolo switches sides, and her mad scientist is mercenary enough to look out for his best interests.  Who will win in this crazy struggle for world domination!!!!  Okay, right enough, no one was planning to take over the world, but that sounds a whole lot better than a wizen old harpy taking over some buxom beauty's body.  That's just all kinds of ick.

I wish I could say this was funny enough to pass as good entertainment but it's not.  It's a complete drag.  And it's so slowwwwwwwwwwwwww.  The narration is totally unnecessary but there it is, at the worst of times, pestering us with the obvious: this is totally forgettable on every level.",1430697600,,1484,4.575757575757576
7985251,3,B00008J2GU,"The Atomic Brain:  I saw this movie, or rather flipped through it, again, this time from the Alpha Video release.  The film is a lot cleaner than the Sci Fi Classics presentation I reviewed before, but the black & white is still pretty washed out.

I can understand why they did not want to go through all that trouble to clean it up, though.

The plot centers around a mad scientist who is experimenting on brains and transplanting them to other bodies by ""stimulating the brain cells with an atomic cyclotron"".  Groovy so far.

He is being supported with lots of money and an illegal lab by an old woman, played by Marjorie Eaton.

She wants the best possible body, so she puts an ad in the paper for someone who is not attached, is an orphan and hopefully someone she can hang something over so they don't squeal.  Not a nice gal.

The narrator in this film is a bit annoying but keeps the plot flowing.

Some partial nudity in the beginning with a woman strapped in a standing table, where the straps conveniently hide the good parts.

The women in the piece are a strange lot and so I thought the heroine of the piece might have a listing in IMDB.  I could not find Lisa Lang in here.  Perhaps she quit acting after this.

The movie is so convoluted and poor that the video disc had the entire plot written on its cover:  rich old lady hires mad scientist; he doesn't like her; puts her brain in a CAT.  WOW>

-----------------------------------------------------Trivia:  ----------------------------------------

Dr. Frank is played by Frank Gerstle, a character actor who has appeared in one or two things throughout his career, such as McHale's Navy, Gomer Pyle, USMC.

The crazy old lady was masterfully played by Marjorie Eaton, who has played in bit parts in such filmography as Zombies of Mora Tau (1957), One Step Beyond and even Mary Poppins!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mary-Poppins-Disney-Gold-Classic-Collection/dp/6305878323/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mary Poppins (Disney Gold Classic Collection)</a>

Directed by Joseph Mascelli, his only directorial film, thank the gods.

Per IMDB he is best known as a cinematographer on:

The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies!!? (1964) (director of photography)

Judy Bamber, the sexy blonde in the piece, was apparently her last film.  She's played in such TV classics as Peter Gunn, Hawaiian Eye and The Many Lives of Dobie Gillis.

7985252,2,B00008J2GU,"Not likely to attain cult classic status, ""The Atomic Brain"" concerns a rich old woman, Mrs. March (Marjorie Eaton), who is funding researcher Dr. Otto Frank (Frank Fowler) to discover a way to transplant her brain into a younger woman's body. Otto has a small nuclear reactor in the basement of Mrs. March's house. The laboratory set looks even cheaper than similar stuff on the original ""Outer Limits"" television show.

The scientific basis behind Otto's experiments and the need to radiate his subjects is never adequately explained, obviously they needed the reactor to justify the original ""Atomic Brain"" title, the word fission is unconvincingly thrown around several times. I can only assume that the alternate title, ""Monstrosity"", is someone's comment on the quality of the film. At the start of the movie Otto's success has been limited to the transplant of a dog's brain into a man (who has large teeth and looks a bit like the goon in one of shorts featuring ""The Three Stooges"").

Mrs. March is encouraged when the doctor steals a woman's corpse from the graveyard and reanimates it to zombie status. Needing fresh living bodies for her transplant she hires three attractive young girls from Europe serve as housekeepers. Mrs. March has no other staff at her mansion, only a wimpy ""companion and gigolo"" guy who is turned on by the young girls. His name is Victor and the narrator sums up his motivation with the movie's best lines: ""Three new bodies. Fresh, live, young bodies. No families or friends within thousands of miles, no one to ask embarrassing questions when they disappear. Victor wondered which one Mrs. March would pick. The little Mexican, the girl from Vienna, or the buxom blond? Victor knew his pick, but he still felt uneasy, making love to an 80 year old woman in the body of a 20 year old girl; it's insanity!""

Despite the low budget and feeble scripting, the movie is not entirely awful. Eaton (who played the fortune teller in cult classic ""Night Tide"") is wonderfully evil and nasty. Fowler (a veteran of countless golden age television classics) is amusing as your basic mad scientist, and the house itself is appropriately sinister. In fact, when the girls first arrive I thought that it might actually turn into a decent film as things get very spooky and suspenseful. One of the girls is played by Erika Peters, who was quite underrated as an actress - her talent dismissed because she was so beautiful. Unfortunately the other two actresses (neither did any subsequent film work) are not up to even modest acting challenges and things pretty much fall apart until a nice twist at the end (which would have worked much better if they had not spoiled it with a second twist). Despite the frequent use of a narrator to explain much of the story, so much happens off camera that is never explained that it is likely there was a much longer original version that was extensively trimmed to get to the present 72 minute running length. This much slash and burn editing does have the benefit of requiring viewers to exercise their own atomic brains whenever a narrative gap occurs. But the story follows the genre's formula so closely that it is not too difficult to fill in the blanks each time this occurs.

Only fans of bad 50's-60's science fiction are likely to ever actually watch ""The Atomic Brain"" and they should find it fairly representative of this genre. At least the premise is decent, with a significantly bigger budget for sets and competent supporting cast members it could have been an entertaining movie.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1184803200,,3606,4.809677419354839
7985253,2,B00008J2GU,"Oh where do I begin with this one? The plot is pretty good. An ugly old lady wants to be young again. She foots the bill for a scientist to live in her basement and conduct experiments on brain transfer. Three young ladies are hired as housewives, and the old woman will choose who she wants to become. Personally I like the blond who says ""I have the same measurements as Marilyn Monroe!"" There is some double crossing and the old lady brain is transferred into the body of a house cat.

You think this sounds pretty good huh? A quaint old movie to watch on a rainy Saturday? Guess again. First of all the picture quality is terrible. The film is so grainy, you would think they filmed this with oatmeal on the camera lense. The acting isn't too bad, but the lines they are forced to regurgitate are inane. And why does this movie move so slow at times? DO we really need to watch the old lady walk down the stairs, down to the basement, and then back up again? Couldn't they just film part of this long journey and we can ASSUME she walked the whole way?

I love old movies, I love bad movies. I really love old, bad movies. But it will be a long time before I revisit this lost cinema gem.",1178755200,,1192,4.200873362445415

7985255,2,B00008J2GU,"This early 1960s black and white ""horror"" film is a prime example of the misunderstood evil genius-reanimated zombie genre typical of the era. The distinguishing features of this film are the extremely disagreeable spinster and the outlandishly bad acting, particularly of the three female victims. (I am especially fond of their skillfully crafted foreign accents.)

This one has it all: ornery old woman, evil genius, hokey pseudo-scientific sets and dialogue, wooden acting, and a cat brain transplanted into a nubile young girl. The one unifying theme of the film, however, is that of boredom. The film isn't one of the very worst ever made, but it ranks right up there on the all time boringness scale. I recommend that if you want to watch this film you buy the version featuring the MST3K guys and their trademark mockery: it relieves the boredom and makes the viewing experience infinitely more enjoyable!",1106611200,,913,5.086666666666667
