8373877,3,B002MD2YWU,"This product can be summed up with good news and bad news. First, the good news: the Genshiken OVA episodes are included; one per disc. Genshiken introduces a new character, who becomes a major player in the second season. The bad news is that there are 12 episodes to the Kujubiki Unbalance show. If you may remember from the first season of Genshiken, Kujibiki is the show that all the characters watch and critique.

You may recall from the first season that Kujubiki was not too good, but it was a spoof of popular anime trends. However, this time you get the so-called second season of Kujibiki, where the creators changed the series so it would begin all over again and some of the characters are different and far less interesting. The green haired girl is gone, and the mushroom fetish is gone too. Even the pink haired girl with scarf is reduced to a small role.

The plot is simple enough: the main character, Chihiro Enomoto, enrolls in his new high school. The student council members are chosen randomly through a lottery, and he ends up being the secretary, while his friend, Tokino Akiyama, will be the president. In order for the new student council to be accepted, they must work under the tutelage of the previous student council members for the next year. However, they must endure a lot of weird trials, and if they fail, they are all expelled from the school.

The show incorporates ideas such as supernatural powers, robots,  and aliens, but it does not explain them at all. They try to help to make this show a little more interesting than the boring high school anime that it is. Also, the characters look way too young to be considered high school students. That is common in anime, but this show takes it too seriously. Another problem (or a benefit for some) is the main character's older sister. She is a teacher, but she looks like a student, and she has incestuous plans for her brother. That's right; she wants her brother real bad. There is an episode when the main character wakes up to his sister in his bed with her just wearing her underwear, and he just simply states that she should go sleep in her own bed, as if this is a normal occurrence or as if he is totally oblivious to his sister's desires.

Overall, this collection has three fun episodes in the form of the Genshiken OVA episodes, and 12 boring episodes in the form of Kujibiki Unbalance. This is recommended for Genshiken fans, but not for anyone else. There are a lot better boring anime out there to watch, but why watch boring anime when you could watch good anime instead?",1393113600,,2576,4.567099567099567

8373879,3,B002MD2YWU,"As a fan of Kio Shimoku and Genshiken, and having seen clips through out genshiken, I really wanted to like Kujibiki unbalance. The reality is that the finished result is far different from the initial concept that I was pining for.
But it isn't all bad news; The Genshiken ova's are the saving grace of the collection. As far as Kujibiki itself is concerned, I'd consider it a rental.",1308614400,2,385,4.594202898550725
8373880,4,B002MD2YWU,"If you enjoyed Genshiken then you'll really like this one!

The characters are likable and funny.  The stories are entertaining and cute.  And our friend the President returns!  If you like constant innocent panty-shots then you'll enjoy how they they are sprinkled throughout this series.  It loses one star in my book because of the appearance of super-powers, which didn't need to be in this series.  If they left it as just a bunch of regular people going to school and trying to deal with life's problems, it would have been 5 stars.

What's even better is the 3 OVA episodes of Genshiken where we are introduced to Ogui and her anti-Otaku antics that we didn't see on volume 2 of the Genshiken box-set.  It's pretty fairly priced and has very good artwork on the packaging.

Check it out!",1289520000,6,794,4.654676258992806
8373881,4,B002MD2YWU,"I liked Kujibiki Unbalance and plan on keeping it. The product description pretty much sums up this boxed set , you get the complete series and 3 Genshiken OVA's. That being said , here's what I didn't like about the series;
It's short, only 12 episodes. Sometimes 12 episodes is enough , but in this case I feel its too short. Some of the episodes feel rushed and there's no real background on the characters other than a couple of flashbacks and a few passing comments and there was no gradual transition between the comedy of the first half and the more serious second half of the series. It felt like it's a lost opportunity that could have made this a really great series.
 If you're  put off by creepy characters, avoid this show. Chihiro's older but younger looking sister  is disturbingly obsessed with him. Chihiro blows off her advances and nothing happens between them but it did get to be a bit much.
 With all this complaining you're probably wondering why I gave it 4 stars. Here's why. The show held my interest, I wanted to see what would happen next and I was entertained. The 3 Genshiken OVA's also helped move it up to 4 stars , they were great.
 If the price dropped to $10 or lower I'd say pick it up , but at its current price you don't get a lot of value for your buck compared to some of the other anime out there at the same price.
 So to wrap it up, if you can get it cheap or rent it , give it a shot.",1284940800,4,1428,4.212454212454213
