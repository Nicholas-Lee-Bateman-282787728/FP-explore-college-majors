Certainly the age and condition of the source material leaves a lot to be desired but the producers could have spent more time on cleaning up the video transfer and less on editing in the guy who puts in his two cents worth(less) before every clip.  The money could have been better spent on locating better prints of the source material - I know they exist because I've seen some of the clips on video compilations from other vendors.  Every clip on this video is very grainy.

As to the widescreen effect, I'm compelled to agree with the first review - there is some loss of information at the top and/or bottom of the frame.  I compared the ""Brest Orgy"" clip with an identical one from another source, not widescreen, and there is no question in my mind that the widescreen version has cut off some of the picture, especially at the bottom.  Why is it that DVD produces have to convert perfectly good old movies to widescreen?  Why can't they be happy with the movie the way it was originally released?",1244419200,9,1052,4.447916666666667
