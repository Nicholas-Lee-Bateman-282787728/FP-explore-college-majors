8159643,4,B0002VS7NY,"This Video contains 4 segments. The first one is a classic one explaining about Pedestrian Signs and Signals showing different signs and traffic lights and how to cross the street with the right signal. The next 3 segments contains a slideshow presentation about Signs around the school, traffic signs and Signs around the highway performed by Victoria Kirby. It is so country fitting with these segments showing different road signs and things on the road. If you would like to read road signs and different signs, I would recommend this tape.",1487980800,,544,4.989010989010989
