3586408,5,B001FD6MJO,"Nowhere could I find what movies were included in this set but I bought it anyway because it was nice and cheap and you can't go wrong with anything by Buster Keaton.  So now that it's come in the mail, I can tell the titles included are:  The General,  The Misadventures of Buster Keaton,  Steamboat Bill Jr., and College--all worth their weight in gold so you might as well buy it if you're thinking about it. Mr Keaton was the ultimate entertainer, comic creative mind and performer, from his time up to our day no one comes close to his talents and abilities.",1266883200,113,563,4.436893203883495

3586454,4,B001FD6MJO,These four feature films showcase Buster Keaton's versatility and comic timing as a performer and director. Ideal for Keaton fans.,1372723200,,130,5.55
3586455,5,B001FD6MJO,"""The General"" is awesome!  What a feat...Keaton also directs, and his stunts, which he did himself, and the action, are wonderful.  I love this film!",1372032000,,149,4.92
3586456,1,B001FD6MJO,"This could be some of Keaton's masterpieces but how can anyone enjoy it from an artistic or historical point of view, defies me. Perhaps I am too musically inclined to let pass someone announcing the attack at Fort Sumter with Johan Strausss' Pizzicato Polka as musical background. Indeed; 'The General's musical background was obviously added later on into film with such marvelous yet inappropriate pieces as Elgar's 1st Pomp and Circumntance (whose nobility is totally out of place), Strauss Waltzes (regardless of any serious scenes) and Bizet's Carmen. It is, in my estimation, a disservice to Keaton's art and impossible to watch; unless, of course, you press MUTE!

Considering that 'The Misadventures of Buster Keaton' is from 1950, the video is rather poorly delivered and the music is a non issue because, well, this is not a silent film.
'College"" uses Scott Joplin's ragtimes, most likely added during the 1970's, since it clearly has the typical noise of a 33 RPM long play record carrying along; distracting to me... cheap production. And it ends with the arch-famous 'The Entertainer"", sounding totally alien given previous associations.
Lastly, 'Steamboat Bill, Jr' is the only segment that 'sounds' authentic. The music is late 1920's hot jazz, sounds almost contemporary to the film and it fits.

So, this is another cheap proposition, no doubt, which does not deserve a place in serious film collection. I will never watch this again, that's for sure.

If you are serious about movies, get another edition.  I just wished someone with some sense of true criticism, would have mentioned all this in this column before I decided to purchase.

A production disgrace.",1365897600,19,1682,5.124087591240876
3586457,4,B001FD6MJO,"There are four shorts in this package. Three are silent films, and one is a T;leveison short from the dawn of TV. The one I liked the least was the TV short. I also did not care for the General, which is noted as one of the great silent movies of all time. To me it was boring. Here is a rundown:
Disk 1:
  The General: A classic, but I did not enjoy it.
  The Misadventures of Buster Keaton: TV show, Couldn't watch the whole thing. i will some day.
Disk 2:
  Steamboat Bill Jr.: Highlight of the set. I loved this movie! Features the classic building falls around Buster window gag!
  College: A great little film! Bookworm Buster tries to become a College sports hero to win his lady love. Contains lots of the physical comedy Buster is famous for.
  All films are of good quality and are highly viewable. They are about as good as they come given their age. I give this set four stars only because the listing is a little off. It mentions eight or so movies, but don't be fooled! only these four are included. I still think the set is worth the price I paid, (about 6 US)",1363651200,,1075,4.2

3586459,5,B001FD6MJO,So I in my 40's and my kids (younger than 12) love this stuff. Mr. Keaton was incredible; he did lots of stunts and gets into humorous situations.  Good clean fun.,1354924800,,163,4.258064516129032

I guess I shouldn't have assumed Buster Keaton dvds would all be silent!",1352764800,,358,3.9583333333333335
3586472,1,B001FD6MJO,"I bought this DVD to watch ""The General"" and ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."", but the picture is very bad, dark, blurry.

3586473,4,B001FD6MJO,"First, as a preface, I am not a silent film aficionado or expert. My view is from that of a movie fan, with moderate knowledge of film history. My taste certainly leans more from Chaplin towards Keaton. On to the DVD.

The quality of these works, range from brilliant, to lousy. The General is best of the four by far. Great production, story, comedy, and stunts. Keaton at his best. However, the DVD producers chose to add orchestral music to the movie, not the ragtime piano I would expect.

Not only that, the music on all three silent features is not in sync with the action. The tunes seemed to be completely random. I wouldn't think the cost of a good ragtime player, improvising a score, would have broke the bank.

College was enjoyable slapstick, while Steamboat Bill Jr. was a tour de force in stunts and special effects. Both stories were routine, but entertaining.

I saved the worst for last. Not only is it a talkie, (when Keaton is known for his silent performances), but the Misadventures Of Buster Keaton just plain sucks. I chuckled one time, and I can't remember why. I may have been delirious from boredom and struggling to stay awake. It was possibly considered entertaining in its day, but that film did not age well.

The other three features are well worth the money, and I recommend this DVD as an intro to the genius of Buster Keaton.",1323820800,,1360,4.580246913580247
3586474,4,B001FD6MJO,"I was really impressed with the quality of this video, especially at it's low price.  The music was a little annoying and I suggest that you turn down the volume and just let it be a ""Silent Movie.""  The actual movies were great and they are considered some of his best.  I highly recommend this video!",1301961600,,302,4.357142857142857
3586475,5,B001FD6MJO,"This was my first of many Buster Keaton purchases.  I have everything BK and two versions of several including The General.  This is the most watched DVD that I own.  This version of The General is set to a fantastic classical music score.  The General appears to me to be the same picture quality as the big Kino box set (different musical score), Steamboat Bill might be slightly better on the Kino set as is College (I actualy saw new things on the Kino version that were not detectable in this version, i.e. the steam that shrank Buster's wet suit before his graduation speech).  All said, this is a terrific set for the price and highly recommended to anyone who needs an introduction to BK features...  worth it for The General alone!",1301702400,3,740,4.568181818181818

Unfortunately, the set contains 'The Misadventures of Buster Keaton'(one of his ""talkies"") which is, like most of his non-silent comedies, painfully lame. That criticism aside, the set is worth the price for the other 3 gems.",1274140800,4,333,5.185185185185185
3586478,5,B001FD6MJO,"As I have always enjoyed movies and was introduced to the silent era in a film class, I went looking for Buster Keaton movies!  I was lucky to find this set and have totally enjoy this blast from the past!",1272844800,2,205,4.125
3586479,4,B001FD6MJO,"Charlie Chaplin and the impassive Buster Keaton, side by side, and apologies to his fans but, for me, Harold Lloyd is not even in this picture. And while the Little Tramp resonates on a more sublime emotional level, it's the Great Stone Face who leaves your jaw dropped to the floor at the the sheer daring and inventiveness of his stunts. Both are geniuses of their form and both marvelous with the sight gags. But when it comes to stunts, there's no trumping Keaton in audacity and thrills and scale. Douglas Fairbanks was the action hero of the silent film era, but Buster Keaton wasn't that far behind. And Keaton made you laugh even as he flabbergasted you.

This 2-DVD set is produced by some never-heard-of company called Echo Bridge Home Entertainment and it's indicated at the start that ""The contents of this DVD have been digitally re-mastered from masters that are many decades old."" So some allowance must be made for quality of what's onscreen. I'm not a connoisseur of digital remastering so I'll just leave it with that I had no problem with it. But I'm easy to please. Others may wail at the gods over the grainy, sometimes washed-out look of the thing. What's here are THE GENERAL, STEAMBOAT BILL, JR., and COLLEGE, as well as the much lesser feature THE MISADVENTURES OF BUSTER KEATON.

Greatness sometimes requires time to be recognized. THE GENERAL was crapdoodled on when it was first released theatrically. People just didn't know what to do with the genre bending. Was it comedy? Or an action adventure? A historical drama? It took decades before THE GENERAL was recognized as, hands down, Keaton's best and most epic masterpiece, and its central character embodies the scrappy, little guy that could. If you want to glimpse precision and grace and audacity as manifested in one unassuming frame, these were never more on display than in this hilarious Civil War romantic chase thriller. THE GENERAL is the Great Stone Face's best foot forward.

Circa 1861 and there were two loves in Johnnie Gray's life: his locomotive, the General, and the lovely Annabelle. When war breaks out between the Blue and the Gray, Johnnie enlists but is summarily rejected, his engineering skills regarded as too invaluable for the Southern cause (not that Johnnie was told this). A year passes. Disgraced and spurned by his sweetheart, Johnnie at last gets a shot at redemption when Annabelle falls in the hands of Union spies and is spirited away on the hijacked General. Johnnie engages in wild pursuit deep into enemy territory.

Based on the Great Locomotive Chase from 1862, THE GENERAL is a non-stop thrill ride and the comedy spins out of the situations in which Johnnie finds himself. Artistry, great energy, and sheer guts drive this film. The thrills are genuine; the gags are ingenious, one of the most memorable being Keaton perched on the train's cowcatcher and using a railroad tie to dislodge another tie that was on the rail blocking the path. The timing on that stunt must have been ridiculous. And then there's the sensational staging of the bridge collapse near the end, and keep in mind that this set piece was neither CG-rendered or done on a scale model. THE GENERAL is a very funny movie, but of all the gags, the one that makes me laugh most is when, running short on fuel for the engine furnace, Annabelle throws away a log just because it had a hole in it. Keaton's reaction is priceless. And there's too the terrific evocation of time and place. The Civil War period is brought to life convincingly, the costumes and the sets and the look of the people in that era. Simply a great, great movie.

In 1928's marvelous STEAMBOAT BILL, JR. Keaton plays Boston college grad William Canfield, Jr. who after an extended absence visits his father in Muddy Waters. William Canfield, Sr., a.k.a. Steamboat Bill, a no-nonsense giant of a man and owner of the ramshackle steamboat, the Stonewall Jackson, hasn't seen his boy since he was a babe. When he at last sets his eyes on the slight, dandily-dressed young man, he... isn't impressed. But blood is blood and he roughly takes him in.

There's a whiff of Romeo & Juliet in this picture. Canfield Sr. has a bitter feud running with smug rival steamboat owner, J.J. King. What are the odds that Bill Jr. and King's lovely daughter would know each other from college and would spark up a romance? (Odds are good.) Canfield, Sr. forbids his son to see the girl. King forbids his daughter to see Bill Jr. And the mean, mean storm is coming, just the platform needed to showcase Bill Jr.'s derring-do.

STEAMBOAT BILL, JR. succeeds in part on the strength of its underdog story, that of the incompetent son proving himself to his father. Marion Byron is easy on the eyes as the love interest. Plenty of silent slapstick, but this movie is most famous for maybe the most amazing, most dangerous stunt Keaton had ever pulled. The howling storm (we assume it's howling, it's certainly very blustery) causes an entire side of a house to collapse on him as he just stands there, with only Keaton's exquisite placement and an open window to give him that teeny margin for error.

COLLEGE came out in 1927 and is enjoyable but thin in plot development. In this one, a bookish student named Ronald looks down on athletics in favor of academia, and he states as much in his high school valedictorian speech. The fun-loving student body is, of course, outraged. The girl of his dreams, Mary Haines, chastises Ronald for his stuffy words: ""Anyone prefers an athlete to a weak kneed, teacher's pet."" And off Mary goes to the prestigious Clayton College. The smitten but penniless Ronald follows her and is forced to work his way thru college. But can he, champion nerd of the silent film era, successfully court Mary, who again has become the most popular girl on campus? Especially since his chief rival, star athlete Jeff Brown, is also staking his claim? Ronald may have no recourse but to engage in dreaded athletics. Except that since this nerd is being played by the sinewy and incredibly coordinated Buster Keaton, well, he eventually gets somewhere....

But it can't be made too easy. Ronald proceeds to suck at baseball and to demonstrate his ineptness at track & field. But he finally gets to flex his muscles when he's made coxswain of the rowing team. To prove that sometimes it's a thing of not mind but heart over matter, Ronald learns that his sweetheart is in jeopardy from star athlete Jeff Brown - who it turns out is a mothereffing swain - and as he speeds to her rescue Ronald is suddenly able to master all the sporting skills in which he'd been previously found wanting. COLLEGE is fun, but not one of Keaton's best. There's also a sequence which some folks may find offensive, as Keaton puts on blackface when working as a waiter.

A pox on his talkies which are so markedly inferior to his silent works. In 1950 the British Lion film company fashioned THE MISADVENTURES OF BUSTER KEATON out of material lifted from Keaton's self-cancelled national television series LIFE WITH BUSTER. Keaton, by this time, was getting on in age, but he was still able to resurrect some of his mojo. But, honestly, I've just never gotten used to an audible Buster Keaton. The man, like certain unruly children, should be seen and not heard.

In THE MISADVENTURES OF BUSTER KEATON Keaton calls back a lot of dusty vaudeville routines and, sadly, some of them are plenty tired. In the series Keaton plays a humble entrepreneur, juggling time spent in his sporting goods store and in his little theatre company. Two of the first three skits fall flat for me, the golf bit and the poster pasting bit. But there are some hilarious gags here, and the funniest moments come during the stage plays, especially when Keaton wrecks a Shakespearean act while being chased by a jealous husband and, oh by the way, reenacts his famous stunt from STEAMBOAT BILL, JR. Certainly worth one look, but it's a far cry from his best stuff.

Luckily, this DVD set doesn't boast superiority over other collections. Who would it have been foolin' anyway? I recommend this collection on the strength of the quite manageable asking price. But if you're a straight up avid collector, then you'd do best to get your mitts on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Art-of-Buster-Keaton-The-General-Sherlock-Jr-Our-Hospitality-The-Navigator-Steamboat-Bill-Jr-College-Three-Ages-Battling-Butler-Go-West-The-Saphead-Seven-Chances-21-Short-Films/dp/B00005QW5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Art of Buster Keaton (The General / Sherlock, Jr. / Our Hospitality / The Navigator / Steamboat Bill Jr. / College / Three Ages / Battling Butler / Go West / The Saphead / Seven Chances / 21 Short Films)</a>, although that sucker will certainly set you back in the piggy bank.
