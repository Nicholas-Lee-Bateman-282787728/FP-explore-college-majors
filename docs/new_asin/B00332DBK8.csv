4062835,4,B00332DBK8,We enjoyed watching Billy: The Early Years of Billy Graham.  The young Billy was appealing and charming and funny and real. What God did and is doing through his life is amazing and teaches all of us that with faith and conviction a simple life can have world-wide and eternal impact.  The movie was a good depiction of that.,1274054400,2,325,4.491525423728813
4062836,5,B00332DBK8,"I saw this in the theater in October 2008, yes 2008. That's 18 months of waiting for this to come out on DVD and FINALLY it's here! Great movie and I will definitely be buying it!",1270425600,2,179,4.0
4062837,5,B00332DBK8,"I, too bought this beautiful movie at my local Wal*Mart for just $9.00!  I sure got my money's worth, even though there is no sermon included, as was promised. That was a big disappointment!

I have Billy Graham's biography in book form so I knew about his early years. Still, it was fun to watch on the screen. The acting was wonderful! I had never heard of most of these actors so I was very surprised at how good they all were. Martin Landau, Jennifer O'Neil, and Lindsey Wagner were great, as always.

Billy Graham, the man, is a true blessing to all Christians and even non-Christians the world over and it's about time a movie about him was made. I just hope the rest of his life will be covered through film someday. And I hope it's not too far ahead!

In this day and age when it's so difficult to find something the entire family can watch, Billy, The Early Years is a gem to stumble across. In fact, I am going to be taking my DVD copy to church for a Family Movie Night real soon.

Thank you, Alice Kane",1270252800,12,1014,4.233160621761658

4062839,5,B00332DBK8,"I have to admit that I hadn't gotten this through Amazon, but from the local WallMart here in New Jersey.  A friend of mine had pointed out to me thay had it on their shelves and I had quickly bought it and we watched it not long after getting home.  One of the things I was greatly interested in see after the film was the 2009 sermon that was said to have been included as one of the special features.  You can imagine my disappointment when I checked the special features section and the only things listed were a behind-the-scenes, and a trailer.  What happened?  I was going to get a copy of this film for a friend's father who is a great fan of Mr. Graham.  He would have been ecstatic to know there would have been a sermon on the dvd.  I'm glad I had checked the special features before sending him out a copy.

If you are a fan of Billy Graham and don't care if there's a sermon of his included, then buy this movie.  Run, don't walk to get it.  You won't be sorry you did.  If you're hoping for some inspirational words spoken by Billy himself in a taped sermon... then don't bother.  Box says it's there, but it isn't.",1269475200,25,1129,4.175925925925926

4062845,5,B00332DBK8,"Wonderful movie! The characters were believable and the story line was nothing short of a miracle. Highly recommend. For families: one spot in the movie was a little sensitive sexually. We really need to raise the bar when it comes to Christian movies. ""We are not to look upon these things"". The scene didn't need to be so graphic even though it was ""clouded"". You either walk the walk or sit down and well...

Otherwise lots of laughs, times of tears, and a must watch again and again movie! It will take a spot next to my Kendrick Bros. movies :)",1516752000,2,549,4.435643564356436

4062848,5,B00332DBK8,"Outstanding movie and music with lots of heart.  Armie Hammer is outstanding as a young Billy Graham.  Saw the movie in theaters with my dad when it came out, and loved it then.  As I watched this video the first time, it gave me goosebumps as the music and movie started .. and I remembered why I loved it.  It touches your heart.  Brooks and Dunn with Mac Powell give a moving rendition in the opening sequence of the Johnny Cash penned ""Over the Next Hill We'll Be Home.""  A sweet, funny, touching movie, and beautiful telling of the early life of Billy Graham.",1511654400,3,564,4.375
4062849,1,B00332DBK8,"Are you kidding me? If this is truly how Billy Graham was in his twenties and thirties (and I seriously doubt it), then he wasn't so special. But again, I doubt it. Much of the movie was spent trying to present the topic in a humorous way, but it wasn't funny. It came off campy and just weird. I think this is just a case of a great topic presented very poorly. Perhaps one day we'll get a good movie about Billy Graham, but this definitely was not it.",1508544000,,453,4.101123595505618

4062879,5,B00332DBK8,"I loved it.  I have read one of his Bio books and this movie let us see how he started out as a young man and how he fail into his purpose when he wasn't even looking for it at the time,  his mind was on baseball not evangelism.  The movie also reflected that God showed favor on Billy's life.  Each elevation that Billy received God qualified him not man. The movie have several areas that each of us could relate to in living our own lives.  It is a good movie for newly called preachers to see, so they can see that every person that is called to preach the Word of God is different, but you will never forget how it happen and when.  The truth is what God has for you, it is for you and no one can stop it.  It maybe delayed but not stopped.",1426636800,,745,3.9266666666666667

4062886,2,B00332DBK8,"Not a very good ""Christian"" movie. This movie is more about the Templeton's view of Billy's life. Templeton was an Atheist.

This film vividly portrays the importance of faith and that choices matter by contrasting Graham's decisions versus those of his fellow colleague Charles Templeton. Cameo roles by Josh Turner and Scott Hamilton are entertaining as well. If you have any affinity and respect for Billy Graham, you will not be disappointed with this film.

It was fun to see his conversion from an athlete to a man after God's own heart.  I can not imagine what it will be like for him to meet Jesus in heaven.....what a wonderful thought.  And to think of all the people that he will meet that will tell him ""Thank You"" for leading them to Christ and changing their lives.  Praise our LORD.",1399939200,5,454,4.067415730337078

After all, it is about Billy Graham and I thought I knew just about everything there is to know about him. Surprisingly, I was so absorbed I had to sit up to watch it and my mouth even flew wide open a couple of times. I shook my head and wept as it made me desire to please God as much as Billy. I've always had the highest respect for Dr. Graham. Real God-fearing men of the cloth like him who are not tainted by worldliness nor full of themselves and puffed up with pride are a rarity these days. He never sent out mixed signals as he humbly walked the talk, nor did he veer from the true message of the Gospel according to the way it's written in the New Testament. What a testimony. Great job all around to all involved.",1388534400,,856,4.041176470588235
4062914,5,B00332DBK8,"I will never forget what Billy Graham's pianist of many years, Tedd Smith, said about him in the early 1970s: Wherever Billy Graham was, whomever he was with, at home or while traveling, even when it was ""just the guys,"" he was always the same--the most consistent Christian-mannered person Mr. Smith had ever known. I was a counselor at a Billy Graham crusade while on staff with a Christian organization in the San Francisco Bay Area, and my organization's president sat on the platform during the crusade and got acquainted with the team. Mr. Smith told him what a consistent Christian the Rev. Graham had been over the years, and later my president relayed this to us staff members. I remember hearing elsewhere about Billy Graham being the best-liked person in the United States, having influence with Presidents, so I was glad to get this DVD about the early years of this historical figure. It's very good and inspiring.",1387324800,4,927,4.836477987421383

4062922,1,B00332DBK8,"I enjoyed the era, the theme, and the reminder of the amazing lady Ruth Bell Graham was. I was very disappointed that Templeton's anti-Biblical views were given such air time. This was supposed to be a film in honor of Ruth Bell Graham. She would be saddened to know that her God was dishonored so vehemently with Templeton's angry, strong contempt during his conversation with Billy. The point of their parting ways could have been handled less intensely for a film trying to uplift the God of the Bible Whom Billy and Ruth dearly love and have given their whole lives to honor and exalt.",1382400000,4,589,4.619047619047619
4062923,5,B00332DBK8,"This is a wonderful movie on so many different levels.  In many ways it is the story of two men, Billy Graham and Charles Templeton, and highlights the consequences that each man has as a result of his faith choices. Providing a contrast between the two men's lives made the main message all the more meaningful. One of its strengths is that it does not water down the faith elements and beautifully presents Billy Graham's call to the ministry.  The balance of faith, humour, romance, and dealing with real issues, makes for a very well-rounded film.  One of the strong messages of the movie is that God will never leave or forsake us, and it encourages people to come to true faith in Jesus Christ through its accurate portrayal of the Gospel message.

First of all it is well acted by the entire cast from major to minor characters. Armie Hammer portrays Billy Graham brilliantly and is careful not to overplay the role.  He is also an actor with impeccable comedic timing and this adds to the story as well by presenting Billy as just a regular fellow with a calling to preach the Gospel. The only weakness is with the portrayal of his mixed, and rather complex, accent. However, Armie's presentation of Billy as a man, and not as a spiritual icon, is really well done.  Lindsay Wagner plays his mother and also has a standout performance.  I was surprised to see Scott Hamilton, the figure skater, in a minor role.  He does a good job as well!  I also like Cliff Bemis' performance as Dr. Ham and Kristoffer Polaha as the younger Charles Templeton.

*Spoiler Paragraph:  Part of the story is told through an aging Charles Templeton, who talks to news reporters about his friendship with Billy Graham from his hospital bed.  He also mentions his own spiritual conversion and as an aging man seems to have regrets about his life choices.  The real Charles reported seeing angels and said he missed Jesus before he died.  In the film, it shows Charles' journey and how he falls into unbelief as a younger man.  He becomes disillusioned after the war as he can't understand why God allows such horrible things to happen to innocent people, and he also begins to doubt the Divine inspiration of Scripture.  I find the scenes with Billy Graham's conversion at a Dr. Mordecai Ham crusade and the spiritual climax in the film to be extremely moving and well done.  The romance between Billy & Ruth is very sweet.  Although it may not have happened exactly like that, it makes for a good story and is respectful of both of them.*

Reactions from the Graham family have been mixed. Billy Graham's oldest daughter, Gigi, and Ruth Bell Graham's sister have both said that they love the film, and I have to say that their characters are both in the film as well. Apparently Ruth Bell Graham never threw a baseball? However, to me this is small potatoes and not at all what the film is about. I feel the screenwriter was just trying to connect Billy's love for baseball at the beginning of the film, with an activity that many couples do together. She was a strong woman and this was nicely presented in this way. The scene when Bob Jones tells Billy he will not amount to anything, which was the one thing that apparently caused some embarrassment for the Graham family, was not included on the dvd. However, Billy Graham mentions the occurrence in his auto-biography himself, so perhaps sometimes the truth is harder to take than fiction. My feeling is that the Graham family could come out with a more accurate biographical film, but I for one will keep coming back to this charming film. Its sweetness, and moving portrayal of Billy's calling to preach the Gospel and his Faith to believe the Bible as the inspired Word of God, will always make it a favourite of mine.",1380931200,3,3763,4.623123123123123

4062936,5,B00332DBK8,"Today, almost everyone has heard of Billy Graham, but not everybody knows his early history--or ""the rest of the story"", as Paul Harvey liked to say.  This DVD tells the rest of that story, and it was very interesting.

The narrative begins with Billy Graham as a young man living at his parent's home, and how he came to be called into the ministry.  We also learn about the person he almost married, and the one he did--and how he met her.  We see how one of Billy Graham's very best friends in the ministry lets him down, and then ridicules him publicly.  It is very easy to identify with Billy Graham in the different situations portrayed.

This movie definitely keeps your interest, some parts are funny and some are sad.  Even if Billy Graham were not a public figure, this would be an account worth watching.  Even though there were not any big name actors in this film, it was well done and enjoyable.  I am a long-time admirer of Dr. Graham, and came forward at one of his crusades when I was twelve years old.  Learning Dr. Graham's history made me respect him even more.

The movie is suitable for all ages and clean.  Our family highly recommends this, and gives it five stars.",1360281600,,1189,4.453703703703703

Armie Hammer does a fantastic job of portraying a young farm boy who believes God wants him to preach; along the way he stumbles yet grows while learning how to preach.  One of the finest scenes for me was him preaching to a passing crowd while only one man responds, 'no one wants anything to do with me' and Billy says ""God does"", and embraces the black man pouring out his heart.  Then the wonderful scenes of a nervous lovestruck college student hopelessly falling for Ruth, who becomes his one and only the rest of her life.  So many other poignant scenes with Charles Templeton, becoming youngest president of a Bible college, and ending with his famous 1949 Los Angeles Tent Crusade (which both of my parents attended).  This is fraught with emotion, laughter, tears, and all because of love for God who first loved us.  A wonderful film I'd recommend to anyone!!",1356825600,11,1027,4.52972972972973

I appreciated that Billy was unafraid of the truth, but at the same time not trying to prove something to someone who is unable to understand or accept faith. It was enough for him and it's enough for any person who humbly seeks God. The story spanned the years up to the first crusade in Los Angeles in 1949 and being only about 90 minutes, could not go into a lot of detail but it was still enjoyable.

4062951,5,B00332DBK8,"I bought this movie at my local Lifeway Christian Bookstore and watched it that very same evening.  Much to my delight it is an excellent movie.  The story of Billy Graham's early years is told through the eyes of Dr. Templeton, a friend turned harsh critic of Billy Graham's.  He is being interviewed in the nursing home and the actor portraying him is most convincing.  As the story goes, Billy Graham aspired to be a baseball player.  His family had a dairy farm so while not starving during The Great Depression as many were, they weren't a gilded age family either.  He goes to a revival led by Dr. Ham and feels drawn to a higher calling of serving The Lord.  The actor portraying Billy does a good job of being the young love struck fellow.  And the romantic story is a sweet one.  Incidentally, I didn't know Ruth Bell Graham had a little bit of a feminist streak in her until this movie.  That was neat to discover!  We are led through the story of how Templeton hits his crisis in Faith and Billy hits a stumbling block in preaching The Word.  But eventually he realizes that Faith is the key and his evangelizing soars.  The actor portrayed the preaching a little bit more animated in nature than I've heard Billy Graham do.  But then I don't know much about his early years.  In the end, the movie leaves one wanting to watch more, it is that good of a film.  There is only one swear word in the movie and other than that, it is a very clean and family friendly motion picture.",1329350400,,1489,4.36

4062957,5,B00332DBK8,"Background:

William Franklin ""Billy"" Graham, Jr.  was born on November 7, 1918 to William Franklin Graham I (1888-1962) and Morrow Coffey (1892-1981). He grew up on a dairy farm near Charlotte, North Carolina. He was raised in the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. However, it was only when he attended a series of revival meetings in Charlotte which were led by evangelist Mordecai Ham in 1934 that he truly accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal Lord and Savior. He was 16 years old.

He attended Sharon High School until May 1936. He then went attended Bob Jones College (Tennesse) for one semester before transferring to the Florida Bible Institute in 1937. It was here that he received his calling to preach the Gospel. Subsequently in 1943, Graham graduated from Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois with a degree in anthropology. In August of that year he also married his classmate Ruth Bell (1920-2007). They had five children together. While attending this college, he became pastor of the United Gospel Tabernacle and also had other preaching engagements.

Storyline/Presentation:

This movie is unfolded by the recollections of Billy Graham's early mentor in the ministry, Charles Templeton (Martin Landau). These two men became very good friends as they ministered the Word together. However, at the end of World War II, as Templeton views the images of the Holocaust, his faith in God starts to diminish. Hence as Graham starts to be more well recognized and established, Templeton, turns his back on his flock and takes up a secular position instead.

This film obviously, is not your typical 'white wash' Christian movie, but it delves into the heart of man, and their frailties. No punches are held back, in doing so, we begin to comprehend how some ministers of the Gospel fail and do not finish their race successfully.

Conclusion:

This film appears to be a true reflection of the early years of Billy Graham, however, without some background information you may find it difficult to follow the story along. I feel that the producers could have lenghtened the film a bit so that the reasons for his college transitions could have been presented more clearly.",1293408000,13,2194,5.041436464088398
