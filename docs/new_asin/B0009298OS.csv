8056619,1,B0009298OS,"I'll be honest. I love El Cuerpazo Del Delito(1970)! It's a fun Mexican comedy told in three episodes. That's the problem! The people at Ground Zero cut the third episode out of the movie! The DVD abruptly stops at the Angelica Maria episode. Don't pay money for an incomplete movie! In the first episode of El Cuerpazo Del Delito(1970), Enrique Rambal plays a married man who covets his sexy, blonde, avante-garde artist neighbor(Silvia Pinal). Pinal also plays his brunette, blue-eyed, mousy wife!
He's exposed in front of his family during his attempt at seducing the blonde. In the second episode, Angelica Maria plays a rich, teenage girl who is kidnapped by criminals. A friendship develops between Angelica and her captors. Mauricio Garces, Roberto Gomez Bolanos, and Ramon Valdes play members of the gang. In the third and weakest episode, Elsa Aguirre plays a sexy, femme fatale who tries to seduce a rich, mild mannered guy(Fernando Lujan).  El Cuerpazo Del Delito has that early 1970's ""cool"" and good production values. The music score is good, too. Hopefully, a better DVD version will be released.
The DVD cover has a drawing of a sexy, well-endowed woman in a bathing suit. I can guarantee this film is 95% smut free.",1336435200,2,1232,4.951690821256038
