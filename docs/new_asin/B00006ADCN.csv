It also makes it a tad more mature than it started out as in the earlier DVDs.  No, no sex, but some situations that small kids may not understand.  Which is why I mentioned the heartaches.  I just wish there were more extras on the DVD.  Which is why I dropped a point.  I wish they had added something, maybe a extra feature on baseball or something?",1322784000,,517,4.615384615384615
7966004,4,B00006ADCN,"After Ryo feels better from that little hospital thing, she learns a bit more about her dad. She's proud, as well as thinking she's also finally made friends with Izumi. That all breaks down as Hiroki's birthday comes along. Izumi is angry with Ryo again, and now Ryo has to put up with that for four days in the mountains.
There's also some bonds with the secondary characters. I think that makes this DVD even more special, because the story isn't ONLY focusing on Ryo, Izumi, and Hiroki. It would be a complete drag if all they did with the secondary characters was have them play baseball and join the team... *yawn*.
I've noticed every DVD of this series has it's own theme of animation... Ryo has the biggest eyes I've ever seen in anime, which is kind of funny, as well as it really freaks me out. Anyways, that's beside the point.
The reason why I say ""Four stars"" is because it's accurate and all, but the time and extras are low. They should put in more extras, kind of like Steel Angel Kurumi. The last episode was about 14 minutes last time I checked. They could have put more effort into the whole Yuki thing, but not so much as to spoil the next episode, ""You're Not Alone, Yuki!"". Either that or the Seira and Coach Kido thing. But then again, it wouldn't really fit, would it? Haha!
It's Funny, Accurate, and has a wonderful Heart Taking story line. It even inspires other girls to play baseball. (Hey, it did it to me, lol!) The kids will love it. It has little swear words, and i think youngsters can handle animated beer. I see no reason why the whole bath scene should be a problem either (No, you don't see fifteen year old bare breasts). It's actually normal in Japan.
I have extreme high hopes for Grand Slam. It's awesome so far, great for kids and adults. So why ruin the last DVD? No excuse is excepted. I know it'll be great, and the day the story ends will be devestating (sp?). Well, for someone who has a huge obsession for it like me at least! ^_^ There. Enough Said.",1030752000,4,1998,4.373655913978495
