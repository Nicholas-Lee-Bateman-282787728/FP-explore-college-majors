The work shows both older and younger people to illustrate that one doesn't have to be a senior to get it.

I think many would think of Ali or Fox when the issue of Parkinson's is raised, but celebrities are not mentioned here.  This is unlike the cataract installment that mentioned a famous Impressionist painter.

The work pays attention to fundraising efforts and scientific research on this disease.  However, this may mitigate the fact that little is still known about the illness.  No medical student could watch this and do well on an upcoming exam.

I wish the work had spoken about pyschosocial matters.  Vitiligo is not contagious, but those with vitiligo have to face a public that assumes it is.  Similarly, many people may sympathize with Parkinson's sufferers and still find the unexpected and consistent jerky movements to be shocking.

The work implies that a whole community is needed to help these patients.  They show patients who have supportive families and good healthcare.  Since 41 million Americans do not have healthcare and many come from divided homes, that won't be a solution to many.  Where does those individuals turn?",1199577600,2,1329,5.0091324200913245
