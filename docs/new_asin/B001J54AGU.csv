8311920,3,B001J54AGU,"Webcam astrophotography by Mr. Miller is a good book for the very beginner who knows nothing about this type of imaging.  It is very generalized and covers only the very surface of this topic.  Although I recommend this book, a much better one on DVD is by the legendary webcam astrophotographer Damien Peach, and books by Martin Mobberley and Robert Reeves.",1228089600,2,358,4.852459016393443
