484901,5,630260494X,"I was on ebay earlier this year when i bought THE LAST VOYAGE on video, when i watched it i was on the edge of my seat! it starts off as a fire in the boiler room and it spreads to the 2nd class dining saloon on the S.S. clariden, After the fire is put out and the ship is back on track the boiler gage gets jammed and explodes causing a huge explosion through the ship and separating ROBERT STACK AND WIFE DOROTHY MALONE as well as THEIR DAUGHTER TAMI! MALONE is stuck beneath a sheet of steel and cant move, so he saves his daughter first { who is stuck on the edge of the giant hole through their cabin} and tries to save his wife! As the Ship takes on water the captain begins to not know what to do, as other passengers leave the liner Stack stays behind with Malone to try and save her, Many great special effects follow, Water pouring into the First class Dining saloon portholes, A wall of water bursting into the engine room, The forward funnel falling and trapping the captain, the Bow being submerged, a half sunken corridor, the cabin flooding, the staircase being exploded by water and when the survivors reach boat deck when waves of water pour over the ships deck as the liner sinks!! Wow what a movie, i have a book on how it was made and they sank the ship The ILLE DE FRANCE of the coast of japan and every scene showing water rising, fire, explosions and the sinking are real and was done by a team of profesionals!!!

484903,4,630260494X,This movie is so sharp and well put together. The opening scene starts it right off with the captain getting a note about a fire in the engine room. From that point on the ship is in trouble and the movie plays it out well. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are very good as is Woody Strode. Better than almost any other movie where a boat sinks!,999475200,2,344,4.149253731343284
484904,3,630260494X,"This movie gets an average rating from me because there really isn't much plot to it.  It seems that all they wanted to do was sink a ship, and show  some drama around it, and that's what they did, and it shows.  The great  Ile de France, a liner with a fine record in peacetime and war, was  disuised as the Claridon for this movie, and was subsequntly partially sunk  as well as completely destroyed inside.  All in all poor treatment of a  fine ship, which the French Line had hoped would have a quiet end in a  far-away breaker's yard.  But there's not much to the movie.  Ship sinking,  blowing up, and the like, woman trapped in her stateroom when the first  explosion came, and the captain being killed by the forward funnel.  No  real plot to it, but it does afford one a good look at the post-war Ile de  France at the beginning of the movie, though using the name Claridon.",967766400,,883,4.2926829268292686
484905,5,630260494X,"A dozen years before ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" and thirty-seven or so before a little movie about a real-life disaster at sea, ""The Last Voyage"" is a worthy forerunner to both films.  Starring Robert  Stack and Dorothy Malone, both fresh from their star-turns in the soap  opera ""Written on the Wind,"" the movie is tense, stunning and  realistic.
I recall viewing this as a lad and was impressed by several  scenes, especially Stack's attempts to rescue his young daughter who is  stranded precariously on a ledge created by a massive explosion.  This is  just one example of the production's well-crafted moments of passengers in  crisis.
Woody Strode, a former star athlete turned actor, is noble and  heroic in his role as the crewman who assists Stack.  Because of his  impressive stature and imposing eyes, Strode usually is remembered, no  matter how small the role. He had two parts in Cecil B. DeMille's ""The  Ten Commandments, battled Kirk Douglas in the famous arena scene in  ""Spartacus,"" and even encountered James Stewart as a menacing  Native American chief in ""Two Rode Together.""
His part in this  film is also significant to the on-screen events.  This is commendable on  the part of the film makers who looked beyond the times and cast the best  person for the job.",961200000,16,1283,4.906542056074766

484981,4,630260494X,"The Last Voyage is an American disaster film written and directed by Andrew L. Stone and released in 1960. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone star as a couple traveling on the SS Claridon en route to Japan with their Shirley Temple-like daughter. A fire starts in the boiler room and the damage leads to an explosion, which threatens to sink the ship. George Sanders plays the in-denial captain who thinks his ship is unsinkable and Woody Strode a crewmember who assists the couple. There are similarities in the story to the sinking of the SS Andria Doria, which sank four years earlier.

The trailer advertised the film as 91 minutes of the most intense suspense in motion picture history and its actually not far from the truth (up to that point anyway) as this is a very suspenseful film from beginning to end. Another plus is that they didn't use conventional sets and special effects; the movies shot on a real ship, the French luxury liner SS Ile de France, which was scheduled to be scrapped before Stone rented it for $1.5 million. The vessel was partially sunk in shallow waters and the crashing of the towering funnel into the deckhouse is for real.

Despite these impressive elements the film lost half a million at the box office and fails to break the threshold of greatness like 1972s The Poseidon Adventure and 1997s Titanic. Its more consistently suspenseful from beginning to end, but this reveals its weakness: The film lacks the establishment of characters of those other films, which isn't to say there aren't parts of mounting anticipation. Nevertheless, instead of a great build-up to disaster its more of an even-keel of suspense.

Moreover, The Last Voyage lacks the deeper subtext of those more popular sinking-ship films. Whereas The Poseidon Adventure potently addresses the universal question Why does a righteous God allow tragedy and death? and Titanic explores the corruption of wealth and the unbiased idealism of youth, The Last Voyage is simply a movie about a sinking ship and the people trying to survive. Of course, it doesnt HAVE to be anything more than this and its very good in its old fashioned way, but this one-dimensional approach also hinders it from greatness. However, the inclusion of likable Woody Strode in a prominent role well before the Civil Rights movement is indeed praiseworthy.

The film runs 91 minutes and was shot in Sea of Japan off the coast of Osaka, although the final lifeboat scene was filmed in Santa Monica, California due to the poisonous jellyfish in the Japanese waters.

She was on her way to be scrapped in Japan and was leased by the film company.  For those that love the old ocean liners this is one not to be missed. The interior shots are incredible.  It turns out the French Line did not know that the film company intended to partially sink the old liner and became very upset when they found out and insisted that the name be removed from the ship. But she is unmistakable in her beauty.  For those of you with long enough memories you will recall this was the ship that responded to the distress call of the sinking Andrea Doria and saved many of her passengers.

485014,5,630260494X,"In many ways this is superior to the Poseidon Adventure as the audience gets involved with the action and focuses on the attempts by Robert Stack to free Dorothy Malone. As the producers used a real ship, the Ile de France (renamed the Claridon), much of the explosions are authentic, though sometimes misplaced. The blowing up of the forward stack into a triangular slice does not seem possible. One problem is often the dialogue cannot be heard over the background noise. The Captain, George Sanders, seems to be more interested in saving face than being a hero. It is only through insubordination by his officers that anything gets done. Several of the crew are heroes, but not the captain, who dies. One interesting scene is when Dorothy Malone's character attempts to slash her wrists as she is full of despair over whether she can get out alive. I think it was a good idea to focus on the peril of only one couple and their child, as trying to tell the stories of others (as certain other disaster movies have done) would make the film too unwieldy. A tense drama, done in a realistic manner. From what I remember this film had been unable on video for the longest time, being released to DVD only in 2006. An excellent film, well worth seeing.",1397865600,,1250,4.609865470852018

485055,5,630260494X,"Excellent early disaster movie.  Plays partially in a documentary style.  An aging ocean liner's boiler (or some machinery) blows up, crippling the ship fatally.  The exodus from the liner plays believably.  The best performances are given by Robert Stack as the husband desperately trying to save his wife's life; Dorothy Malone as the trapped woman realizing she will most likely die and trying to convince her husband to leave so their daughter won't be alone.  You really feel their desperation and emotional pain.  Woody Strode as the selfless engineer/mechanic trying his best to aid the couple is nothing less that excellent.  Edmond O'Brien also comes off good here as the chief engineer trying to save some of his trapped men.  George Sanders is also pretty good as the obsessed, self-deluding ship's captain.  The only sour performance is from the little girl playing the couple's daughter.  Sadly, the beautiful liner Ille de France was destroyed to make this film.  Great movie.  Very highly recommended.",1393200000,,1016,5.1656441717791415
485056,5,630260494X,"this is as good in many ways as later disaster movies such as THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.  The cast is exceptional, including three Oscar winners.

485057,3,630260494X,"Oh dear, what have we here?  Apparently, after ""Titanic"" came out in 1953, and ""A Night To Remember"" (about the Titanic) came out in 1958, someone felt that one more ship disaster could still make some money so ""The Last Voyage"" was made.  Quit while you're ahead is the operative phrase, here.  While the two Titanic films were not great disaster films, or even all that accurate as Titanic movies, they were somewhat watchable, although they lacked the big budget drama of later efforts like ""The Posiedon Adventure"" or ""Airport""---which is a good movie even without the idea of Nebraska having the only airport for a Rome bound plane to return to after having a bomb go off.  ""The Last Voyage"" is not one of those films...

George Sanders plays the Captain, who is overly reluctant to acknowledge that his ship is indeed sinking.  He also narrates the film, after a fashion (sort of popping up, quietly, in odd moments), and you may well remember his altogether better effort to that end in (the altogether better film) ""All About Eve"".  The ship in question is the 38 year old tub, the Clarendon, which is not only old, but hasn't even been retired to the Siberia of all TransAt floating palaces that escaped the breakers, Greece;  no, she's been sent to the Wrong Ocean, and is in Japan service.  But, while she's supposed to have a few more cruises in her, in this one she blows a gasket, then she blows a hole, then things start blowing up and catching fire and she sinks!  Oh my gosh!

The thing is, none of it is special effects----the ship is the very real Ile de France, herself on the way to the breakers as a Very Old Ship.  Originally, she was one of the very first liners to be decorated in a modern fashion, and as a ship, rather than fitted out with rooms copied from castles and hotels on the Continent.  While never one of the TransAt giants---a wee bit shorter than the Titanic---she was always a giant with her passengers, popular right up until the end was wrung by jetliners.

To that end, I imagine that the greatest attraction this film has is as a record of the Ile de France for ocean liner aficionados.  The story is utterly ridiculous, to the extent there is one---aside from the crew trying to keep the ship from blowing up any further, or sinking;  and from the officers trying to get the Captain to admit the ship IS sinking, and get the passengers to the boat deck, nothing really happens, aside from an idiotic plot built around Dorothy Malone getting stuck beneath a girder that has collapsed onto her, when a hole was blown through several decks.  We almost saw one of the most irritating child stars dropped six floors, but after an improbable amount of film time wasted saving her, she spends most of the rest of her time in the film crying.  She can be forgiven for that I suppose, as her real life, after growing up wasn't all that pleasant, given the hopeful Hollywood start.  As plot devices go, I was reminded of ""the choppers"" scene in the ""Galaxy Quest"" sci-fi TV spoof.  This sort of nonsense was written into so many films it almost seems a rite of passage to get to the end.

Ah well.  If you could rent this film as you should, it would be worth watching just for the interiors.  But Amazon and Netflix aren't streaming it, so you have to buy it, and that is even worse than the movie itself!  This movie is not worth that kind of money!

485061,5,630260494X,"I have a weakness for two of the elements of this film:  disaster movies, and Robert Stack.  For his female fans, I have two words regarding his appearance in this film:  Eye Candy!  He is thoroughly hot in this one!

The plot involves a fire aboard an ocean liner, played by the Ile de France, a famous liner that was on its way to the scrapyard.  Her demise in this film, where they actually sank her, was more dignified than being cut up for scrap metal.  Robert Stack plays an American in transit to a new job in Japan, with Dorothy Malone as his wife, and his little daughter, played by the carrot-topped Tammy Marihugh, a latter-day Shirley Temple.  Dorothy Malone and the child become trapped in their room when a boiler explodes, putting a gaping hole several decks deep in the child's location, and trapping the mother behind a huge piece of steel.  Through the indifference of a glory-hound captain and the unavailability of other help, it is up to Robert Stack to rescue his family.  Finally, one of the engineering crew, played by Woody Strode, decides to help him.

Aspects of disaster movies can make us crazy.  The one ""offense"" I found here was the way the engine-room crew fight the fire.  They bring in both soda-acid and CO2 extinguishers, and play them over the top of the fire.  I sat in my chair yelling at them, ""At the base of the flame!  At the base of the flame!""  That was the one part of this one that brought me out of the story.  I got swept back into it as Dorothy Malone's situation, being trapped by a huge piece of bulkhead in their stateroom, goes from serious to downright hopeless.  I was, I will confess, on the edge of my seat.  Very few movies have actually put me in that position, but this one did.

And that was the surprise, that this rose above the usual level of disaster flicks.  The reality is heightened by the use of the actual sinking of a real ship rather than studio effects.  I love disaster flicks, mainly because they are usually cheesy, and I have a lot of fun laughing at them.  I didn't laugh at this one, being riveted by the developing disaster.

The ending was a bit too abrupt.  I would have liked a classier, more classic denouement than we are given.  Other than that, I found this an enjoyable film.",1377129600,,2265,4.423728813559322

Sometimes, as you all know, it's best to hang on to those memories because often the (present) reality doesn't stack up (pardon the pun).
This was not the case with this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was extremely impressed with the special effects. As I alluded to in my heading, there are obvious similarities with Titanic. This movie was made in 1959 yet the scenes showing the sinking of the ship and the flooding of the corridors compare very favourably with much later efforts. Dorothy Malone doesn't have to do too much, Edmund O'Brien is a little over the top but the great Woody Strode is always good to watch.

Anyway, this 1959 disaster film has an advantage over ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and even ""Titanic"": a real ship. Ocean liner buffs will recognize her as the fabled Ile de France, one-time flagship of the French Line and the liner that introduced the art deco style at sea. After 30 glorious years, it was time for this ship (which counted everyone from Hemingway to Marlene Dietrich as passengers and helped rescue survivors of the Andrea Doria) to retire. She was sold to Japanese shipbreakers, but a funny thing happened on the way to the scrapyard: she was chartered as a floating set to Andrew Stone, the Hollywood producer of this movie, for $4,000 a day. He promptly set about blowing up the cargo hold, flooding the first class dining room, knocking over the forward funnel and partially sinking the Ile in Osaka Bay. The French were furious and demanded that the name ""Ile de France"" not be seen anywhere (hence the fictional name ""SS Claridon"") With all this action, one barely needs a script and, indeed, you don't watch this to see Shakespeare. Stars Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (paired earlier in ""Written on the Wind, Malone's finest hour), old pro George Sanders and the magnificent Woody Strode do what they can with the dialogue, and by all accounts this was a difficult shoot (Stack suffered a back injury when he was blasted by water coming through a porthole) but let's face it, the Ile de France is the star, and gets to go out as one!",1284595200,6,1680,4.77319587628866

But, what really sets this movie apart is the ship.  The producers actually sank a luxury liner to make this movie.  It was the great French ship, ""Isle de France"".  This ship saved the passengers from the Andrea Doria disaster.  It was being decommissioned and sold for scrap to a Japanese company.  Before the ship was scrapped, the producers rented it, renamed it, refurbished and filmed it.  A very dramatic, controlled sinking was performed, and filmed.  The ship was then raised and sent to the scrapyards in Japan.  I have seen this movie MANY times, and find it very well done.  My only criticism is the very, very end, showing something swirling down amid sea spray, with the narrator voiceover.  Cheesy ending to a classy movie.",1271376000,,871,4.804054054054054

485154,4,630260494X,"The Last Voyage: 7 out of 10: Irwin Allen clearly took notes in 1960 when this film was released. The granddaddy of modern disaster films, it starts with an intense fire in the first minute and never gives up.

This is the first disaster film not based on an actual historical incident. (Though it clearly cribs from the contemporaneous Andrea Doria sinking). Using an actual art deco style liner being put out for scrap, The Last Voyage has some excellent real interiors as well as special effects. The fact that filmmakers partially sank the ship and blew parts of it to smithereens clearly helps their tale. Moreover, while some the special effects are weak, the advantage of using a real ship and real seawater over CGI or miniatures is obvious.

The film stars Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone as a couple complete with red headed moppet sailing to Tokyo. A boiler explosion takes out their cabin trapping Malone for the entire film while the water rises and Stack desperately tries to get help. Meanwhile Captain George Sanders ignoring some problems initially and with a less than helpful crew tries to keep the ship afloat. Sanders, Malone and Stack are engaging during the film and there is some surprisingly strong drama involving Malone's situation.

The red headed moppet, after a tense rescue, becomes one of those irritating kids in line at the grocery store and a viewer's patience for her histrionics may wear thin. Viewers may also lose patience for the numerous scenes of various crewmembers (not well acted mind you) peppering Captain Sanders with endless questions in almost an Airplane style parody, (The presence of Stack will put you in the mood).

On the plus side, the real hero of the film is black actor Woody Strode who gives a charismatic performance and whose central (and shirtless) role is a bit of a surprise for 1960.

On the negative side, the film has some of the most laughable, pompous narration ever seen on screen. Sounding like a drunken John Houseman, George Furness brings the action to a screeching halt with every ostentatious magisterial utterance.

Despite the narration, the film keeps a good pace for 90 minutes with scenes of disaster in almost every frame. Adult in tone and content it is a surprisingly fun and competent disaster movie.",1255910400,,2287,4.881443298969073

485156,3,630260494X,"This movie has it's good and bad aspects.

Good- you get to see the interiors of the Ile De France one last time before she went to the breakers.  The ship is fantastic with her art deco designs and woodwork.

Bad- most everything else.

The movie is narrated by the actor playing the second officer- who speaks like he has a mouthful of oatmeal while he's speaking.  It's difficult to understand him.

Stupid dialog- like Edmund O'Brien's character telling everyone that his Father had been lost on Titanic, and later one of the officers repeating it.  The officers continually pressuring the Captain to abandon ship and he not even wanting to mention to the passengers that there is a problem.  This is after a boiler explodes and takes out a large section of a dining room and several cabins.

The events surrounding the boiler explosion.  Instead of trying to crack the stuck safety valve, why didn't they just shut the fuel pumps off to the boiler and open the throttle valves.  There's always more than one way to do things aboard ship.

Look closely and you can see the French placards on almost everything in the engine room- although this is supposed to be an American or British ship.  Many of the steam gauges read zero, and the ship was supposed to be steaming at full speed when this incident occured.  Apparently only one or two boilers were actually fired to supply service steam to generators.

Another weird plot element is the forward stack falling on the Captain's quarters.  It's obvious that the stack was cut with a torch and WINCHED down.  The angle of the ship certainly would not cause it to collapse.

Often, when the shots are angled to represent the ship sinking, the actors are standing upright- and therefore seem to be able to defy gravity.

Most of the actors do rather good jobs- considering the script was not very good.

Again, if you want to see the inside of a classic superliner buy this movie- otherwise steer clear.",1250467200,2,1955,4.6608187134502925

This is yet still another one of those movies that my mom steered me to in an effort to get me interested in movies when I was younger (bless her spirit).

Robert Stack is being transferred to Japan along with his wife, Dorothy Malone and their whiney kid, Jill aboard the Claridon, a very old Ship that has an appointment with the scrap yard but it's an appointment she'll never keep because this is her LAST VOYAGE......A Brief Synopsis:

The movie wastes absolutely no time getting right into the action.  As the credits are rolling, the captain receives a message that there is a fire in the engine room so all hands or as many as possible, gravitate to the engine room to quell the blaze but then another blaze breaks out a few decks up in the dining room and THAT is quickly put out, all, mind you, while the passengers don't realize anything is wrong except a smell of smoke......So everything is hunky dory, all the fires out and........ well now pressure is building up in the boilers, well now this can't be good....this is where the action ratchets up a few notches and I tell you to get this movie because it is definitely worth it and I'll tell you something else, if Robert Stack wasn't in the position he was in and his wife wasn't in the position she ends up in?, there would be NO WAY I'd ever be able to put up with that whiney little brat kid of theirs but hey, she is cute as a button just the same.  Seriously though, some fine acting in this picture, Edmund O'Brien shines as the chief engineer, whose dad was lost on the Titanic and is very bitter towards the Claridon Captain, played by George Sanders. There are no extras to speak of on this DVD but who needs 'em, the picture is all the thrill you'll need. Don't Miss it",1209945600,,1931,4.397759103641457

485194,5,630260494X,"This is an incredible drama.  It is nothing like any of the Poseidon Adventures or the Titanic.  This is real.  The premise is this.  An old cruise ship is making one of its last voyages only to start to break down.  As more and more problems occur, the politically motivated Captain simply doesn't want to believe the ship is in trouble and won't listen to the crew.  Does the crew hang in there with their captain?  Does the Captain go down with the ship?  You have to watch this film to find out.

 Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are incredible as a married couple.  Their daughter, Tammy Marhugh making her acting debut made a believer out of me.  In fact, all the actors do a great job.

""The Last Voyage"" was released in 1960.  The effects are incredible for the time period and stand up against computer aided special effects used today.  The sinking ship is no model either.  It is the famed lle de France and was actually sunk for this film.  Talk about realism!  The special effects are simply fantastic.

I recommend this film for anyone who enjoys really well done drama.  ""The Last Voyage"" kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire film.  A must have for your DVD collection.",1188259200,,1193,4.430555555555555
485195,4,630260494X,"Disaster movies from this era are, in general, fairly forgettable, but ""The Last Voyage"" rises above the norm in several ways. The stars of this film are well cast with Robert Stack in fine form as the heroic husband out to save his wife, George Sanders excelling as Captain Robert Adams, and Dorothy Malone doing a generally good (though occasionally over the top) job as the imperiled heroine. Stack and Malone had worked together before, and have an excellent onscreen chemistry. While football star turned actor Woody Strode does an excellent job as a selfless crewman, the downside to the casting was Tammy Marihugh who played the daughter of Stack and Malone, and who is one of the most shrill and annoying child actors in memory. I gave this film four stars, and a good part of the reason it didn't get five was due to that one piece of casting.

The real star of the film, of course, was the ""S.S. Claridon"" which sank due to a fire, boiler explosion, and aged bulkheads. Most movies from the 1960s have poor special effects, but ""The Last Voyage"" is different because there are no real special effects here. The actual star of the film turns out to be no other than the beautiful art deco French Line ship, the ""Ile de France,"" a ship more famous than most people realize. The ""Ile de France"" was the first ocean liner completed after world war one, and served through many years of service on the Atlantic (including as a troop transport during world war two.) Her most famous accomplishment, though, was coming to the aid of the ""Andrea Doria"" which sank in 1956: ""Ile de France"" was key to the rescue operation, but was retired and this film was made just four years later.

The film was shot onboard the ship, which is why the sets look so realistic and why the sinking is so realistic (she was actually sunk for the film.) While the plot itself is a bit contrived (really, an acetylene delivery by rowboat?) the story is generally well done and the shots of the ship are magnificent, although the mechanics of the funnel collapse might be questioned by marine architects.

I recommend the film as an above average suspense drama, and especially for the beautiful shots of a magnificent liner in her final days.",1165449600,32,2224,4.625316455696202

I was sick at home with the flu and was so glad I didn't have to watch soaps! Yeccchh!  When I saw this on AMC not too long ago I was amazed to see how the movie has held up all these years.  The casting is great- first rate.  George Sanders plays a solid captain and uses just the right dramatic pauses at the right time.  Edmund O'Brien (who is probably the greatest character actor of all time)  is the blustery and defiant chief who has his fair share of run-ins with the captain.  All the other casting is great as well and the film builds in suspense throughout.  I especially like how the movie draws the viewer in immediatly with the opening shot of the captain holding a note which simply says ""fire in the engine rooom.""  This is a fast paced and well crafted movie that is a delight to any disaster film buff.  I especially like the scenes when the ships officers are peppering the captain with questions and you can see the captain slowly losing his confidence in his command (and in his ship).

The storyline is well done and I must say the actors do a very good job and I must say that storyline is so much more realistic then that phoney love story in Titanic.  George Sanders is amazing in the role as the power hungry and self-centered captain that takes the sinking of the ship as personal injury rather then a tragedy for all and does everything to make sure that he becomes the hero. Even at the expense of the lives of others. Robert Stack also plays his role well. The little girl is alright and she tends to whine about to much and this sounds a bit unrealistic and she looks way to old to play the role that she has been given and the clothes look silly and just out of place. The special effects are ok, but they do not take away the focus like titanic does. This is a quite good movie that gets the 4 stars that it deserves.",1130112000,2,935,4.081521739130435

George Sanders has a believable and restrained turn as the beleagured captain. Robert Stack is his usual no nonsense good guy.

What I liked most is the look of the film. Its not fake. The action is real because they really did burn the ship. This adds to the excitement and tension. This deserves to be on DVD.",1115424000,15,683,4.377952755905512

One scene though you will never see in real life is the Chief Engineer hammering on the safety valve of an over-pressurized boiler. He would have known that it was already too late!  Also check out ""The decks ran red"" directed by Andrew Stone, TERRIBLE story and acting, but it was all filmed on a WWII Liberty ship.

485201,3,630260494X,"THE LAST VOYAGE tells of a sinking cruise liner and the panic of the crew and passengers.  Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone star as a happy couple trapped aboard the sinking ship; they co-starred in ""Written on the Wind"" 4 years earlier and received Oscar nominations (Dorothy received the best supporting actress Oscar).  Their work here is far less impressive, but they acquit themselves admirably with the material.  Unfortunately, their young daughter in the movie (Tammy Marihugh) gives one of the shrillest child performances ever.
The reasons for the ship sinking are somewhat murky and unexciting (a small fire?).  Although some suspense is generated subsequently, the plot and characters are rather hackneyed.  Predictably, the Captain under-estimates the danger and his crew argue with him, and so forth.
On the plus side, the special effects are pretty impressive for the time.  The producers leased the S.S. Ile de France, which was a famous French cruise ship that was being de-commissioned.  Thus, they were able to partially sink the ship, and the results are some fairly realistic looking scenes, especially toward the end.
Overall, this film is an above-average 1960s film that compares favorably with similar films of the period, such as the 1953 version of Titanic.",1069545600,22,1283,5.229268292682927
