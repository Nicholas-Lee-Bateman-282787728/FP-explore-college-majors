8462545,5,B0058YPON6,"State of Georgia is a HILARIOUS comedy starring Raven-Symone, Majandra Delfino, and Loretta Devine.  Finally, ABCFamily has a funny sitcom.  I was FURIOUS when I learned that ABCFamily had cancelled this show after only 12 episodes.

Once again, ABCFamily proves they have no idea what they are doing.  They cancelled a fabulous show called ""Huge"" last year and this year they cancel ""State Of Georgia"".  The network renews trashy shows like ""Pretty Little Liars"", and introduce garbage like ""The Lying Game"".

State of Georgia is a great sitcom that throws back to the days of REAL sitcoms.  Unlike the rubbish you see on ABC or NBC.

Let's only hope that ABCFamily will release the complete series of State of Georgia on dvd as they did with Huge.",1317254400,2,749,4.84251968503937
8462546,4,B0058YPON6,"Raven at her best!  This is a throwback to sitcoms, in a reality tv world.  A clean, funny show for teenagers, tweenagers and adults who wants to watch some mindless fun.  Very funny!",1315958400,2,183,4.484848484848484
8462547,5,B0058YPON6,"this show is real entertaining and i love how the characters grow in every episdoe.
Raven is great as her character, as is Loretta Devine in her ""diva-ish"" role and
Raven's friend in the show is weirdly hilariou
