1900214,5,B0000A02X7,"I was impressed with the films brining to life the experience of ultrarunning, and its very detailed coverage of the Badwater. I have been aware of this race for some time, but this film puts color on the picture ""in my minds eye"". Highly recomended for any ultra runner wanabe (like me),or just anybody that is impressed with the human spirit.",1141084800,5,344,4.655737704918033
1900215,5,B0000A02X7,"As a long distance runner, this movie was extremely inspirational and made me feel not so wacky with my running distances. :)

The documentary starts out with snippits of some of the participants and then goes into the prerace meeting. Even before they reached the starting line i was moved by the movie. I have never raced Badwater, but have raced enough to know what emotions you feel at the start and to even begin to imagine how they feel starting off on the Badwater 135 is overwhelming.

The remainer of the film chronicles several runners from the front of the pack on back. Also you see a lot of interaction between the runners and their crews and their families. It is moving to see how different each person deals with the trials and tribulations of the ultimate ultra. To see them sweating in the desert before the race even started, wow.

Then, comes the end of the movie and it is emotional to see each and every runner cross the line and break the tape. Amazing.

The extras on the DVD were interesting too.

If you are a long distance runner, marathon on up,  you should definitly watch this. If you are interested in endurance sports or crazy athletes, this movie is a highly recommended one. Amazing. I finished it and wanted to watch it all over again.",1134086400,17,1270,4.524017467248909

1900217,5,B0000A02X7,"I loved this film. And I don't think you need to be a runner to marvel at what these folks put themselves through. The Badwater event has intrigued me for a couple years now. I've hovered over the ""BUY NOW"" button on Amazon for a while but I'm thankful that I finally made the purchase. I consider myself an ordinary distance runner. Nothing special. I simply try to go from point A to point B. But these folks are in a class all their own. The film is very well done with a good bit of backstory on some runners including some of their training strategies (which were incredible just by themselves). It also takes the viewer through the highs and deep lows of the Badwater experience, leaving nothing out. Highly recommend.",1127347200,8,724,4.492424242424242
1900218,5,B0000A02X7,"This movie is not just about a grueling 135 mile foot race through Death Valley and up the side of Mt. Whitney - it is a glimpse at what the human spirit is capable of.

I'm a middle of the pack ultrarunner and it has become a tradition that before races and some long training runs I watch this documentary. The people profiled in it (ranging from a young British woman who has ""always wanted to do a bit of running"" to a man who lost his leg and arm clearing landmines for charity) are all the models of courage and determination.

I've watched this documentary so many times I feel like I know the people in it.",1126915200,6,614,4.194915254237288

1900220,5,B0000A02X7,"A film by Mel Stuart

""Running on the Sun"" is a documentary dealing with the Badwater 135 Ultra-marathon.  While an ultra-marathon is defined as any race with a distance longer than a marathon (26.2 miles), Badwater is a grueling 135 mile race beginning in Death Valley (Badwater, California, elevation 282 feet below sea level) and ascending to 8000 feet by the race's end which includes an 18 mile stretch where the elevation rises over 5000 feet.  With temperatures reaching 125 degrees in the middle of the day, the Badwater 135 is perhaps the nastiest race in the world.  Only forty runners were invited to run Badwater in 1999.

This documentary focuses on a cross section of some of the competitors to give an accurate portrait of what Badwater is and what Badwater does to a person.  From a Marine to a man with a prosthetic leg to a 68 year old man to the current record holder of Badwater to a woman from England who put herself into debt to make it to Badwater, ""Running on the Sun"" has an interesting cast of characters.  But then anyone actually willing to attempt Badwater probably has to be an interesting person.  So many of these runners are just ordinary people with an extraordinary drive, passion, and commitment.  Very few runners are actually trying to win the race, or break a record, but rather they are seeking the incredible personal accomplishment of finishing (60 hours or less) and perhaps even chase the goal of finishing in under 48 hours and thus earning the symbol of pride: The Badwater Belt Buckle.  Only those few who can finish in under 48 hours can earn that belt buckle (and they do ""earn"" it).

""Running on the Sun"" touches upon why someone would run Badwater and what it takes.  We see graphic footage of the feet of some of the runners and it isn't pretty.  The film shows the joy, the pain, the pride, the disappointment, and the accomplishment of running Badwater.  This really is an impressive documentary about an incredible endurance race.  I'm impressed all the more because I'm currently training for my first marathon and while 26.2 miles seems like a long way, Badwater is 5 marathons back to back, plus a little bit more.  Not to mention the whole Death Valley thing.  It's beyond my comprehension as a runner.

There is something in ""Running on the Sun"" to recommend the movie to anyone.  Runners will get to see something that is probably beyond their dreams or even desire, but they will surely appreciate the effort.  Other endurance athlete can also appreciate what the competitors of Badwater are attempting.  Those who are simply curious will see a film about perseverance and accomplishment through adversity.  This is an inspiring and awe inspiring film, though I imagine many people won't get why someone would do this.

1900221,5,B0000A02X7,"I really enjoyed this movie because it shows what distance runners go through.  Highly recommended for those who enjoy long distance running.  If you're planning to run an ultramarathon one day, this is a good movie to watch.  It's interesting as well as motivating.  Rock it out!!!",1084752000,5,282,4.9361702127659575
1900222,4,B0000A02X7,"We're runners and would usually prefer to BE running, than to WATCH running.  But, this is an excellent film.  It's well-done and kept our interest throughout.  It was painful to watch at times as these folks suffered along trying to do 135 miles, but yet, we couldn't take our eyes off.  Highly recommended if you are a runner of any distance.",1068336000,28,344,4.590163934426229
1900223,5,B0000A02X7,"I absolutely loved this video!! The runners all have such unique personalities and I felt I was beginning to know them after watching this amazing run. The story was well told, music was very fitting, and the scenery was beautiful!  This is a film I will watch again & again.",1211932800,,275,4.5
1900224,5,B0000A02X7,I would recommend this movie to runners of all levels- or to anyone who just wants to be inspired.  It is a firsthand account into the lives and (some would say crazy) minds of ultra-endurance runners.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish. It really gives insight into how much passion these runners have for the sport and what the human body can endure.  I wish that they would make a sequel!,1209081600,,410,4.513513513513513
1900225,5,B0000A02X7,I run ultras so I've absolutely heard of the infamous Badwater.  It was amazing to see what those runners go through during the race.  Really interesting characters.  You'd have to be to run that race.  Nice documentary.  Not really any narration just shown from the runners' perspective.,1208736000,,288,5.042553191489362
1900226,5,B0000A02X7,"i first saw this video when darren worts (my colleague at a new jersey health club) was planning to do the badwater run about 6 years back.  i was mesmerized and humbled by the dedication and drive (and insanity!) of the runners.  i purchased the DVD and now use it as a motivational tool for my 4th semester physical fitness specialist majors at the college where i work. this is the last semester before they either ""go out into the world"" or continue their education.  they are blown away and a most interesting class discussion follows the film.  the purpose?  you can achieve your goal...no matter.  thanks for carrying the film. it took a few years to find it.
p.s. darren, in his first run, came in second: first male to cross the finish line.  we were so proud.

1900228,5,B0000A02X7,"Great movie. Awe-inspiring, particularly if you are interested in ultradistance events and the crucible associated with it. My only critique is that the scenes of runners piercing the blisters on their feet, and the foot juice shooting into the air, wasn't necessary to convey the message intended by the director!",1202688000,,314,5.3
1900229,4,B0000A02X7,"This movie shows many, if not all, aspects of running an extreme ultra race as Badwater. I found it both inspiring and frightning as the runners experienced different stages of physical and mental endurance. Although I never(?) intend to participate in Badwater, it inspired me tremendously to see ""normal people"" being able to finish this extreme race.",1199145600,,353,5.2105263157894735
1900230,5,B0000A02X7,"This is an excellent video of the Badwater 135, which I highly recommend regardless if you are a runner or not.  I've watched it several times and I don't think I will ever get tired of it.

It features several participants of diverse backgrounds and abilities, who share one common goal - to reach the finish line at the end of 135 grueling miles.  Through the course of the video, it highlights their personal sides, their training, their goals and their peaks and valleys during the race.  It does not gloss over the challenges they face.  Instead it clearly portrays each of their experiences unmistakeably to you, the viewer.  Some reach the finish line, some do not.  But after viewing this, you will certainly appreciate the effort that each of these extraordinary individuals put forth to reach their goals.  It might even encourage you to take on whatever challenges you face with a renewed sense of purpose and determination.  It certainly did for me.",1193875200,,961,4.810975609756097
1900231,4,B0000A02X7,"I'll be honest--my wife bought me this video for father's day in 2001.  Two years later I had my size 10 New Balance's on the starting line in Badwater, and ran the race of my life (with the help of my super support crew).  One of my crew members had a video made of OUR adventure through Death Valley, and as good as Running on the Sun is, the video of our adventure is just as intriguing.  Unfortunately you won't find it on Amazon.

Not yet, anyway.",1184457600,,452,4.160919540229885
1900232,5,B0000A02X7,"Extremely motivating... and a great metaphor in and of itself.  (Weird how some microchasm of society can easily represent life itself.)  At this point, you can do everything right-- and still something can go wrong.

I loved how it followed these ultrarunners and let you get true insight into what they were thinking and feeling... I teared up at parts, and even knowing the race was long gone and over, found myself cheering on the impressive finishers.",1183852800,,456,4.896103896103896
1900233,3,B0000A02X7,"I wish they had talked a bit more about their backgrounds, what they did to train, a bit more about nutrition. Having read Dean Karnazes's account of Badwater in ""Ultramarathon Man"" made this DVD fall a bit short of expectations.

I think there is an untapped market in Ultra-marathoning training material. There are many people out there who are intrigued by the idea of running these crazy distances, but are unable to find good resources to help them get there.",1179014400,4,464,4.8
1900234,5,B0000A02X7,"If you ever thought about doing an ultra but weren't quite sure, this movie will convince you either way. It comes as close as a DVD can to putting you out in Death Valley and letting you go. It's probably closer than many people want to get to the edge: raw, fascinating, and exciting. Don't make the mistake I did of lending it to a friend, you'll never get it back. A great movie.",1177286400,3,383,4.1891891891891895
1900235,4,B0000A02X7,"This movie is a 'must see' for those who aim complete the Badwater some day!

It is inspiring because you see that sometimes the tough-hero type of guy is not the one who reaches its goals. Rather you see a well humored old sir in his sixties or a humble material-poor and spiritual-rich lady crossing the finish line!",1174867200,,318,4.482758620689655
1900236,5,B0000A02X7,"I have watched this DVD over and over again.  While it doesn't have many of the races superstar's, such as Dean Karnasez, the stories are just as compelling.

  Highly recommend for anyone who wanders what's it's like to be obsessed.",1174780800,,233,4.75
1900237,5,B0000A02X7,"The stories are awesome by themselves but the producers did a great job of putting them together for the video.  I was interested, inspired and motivated from watching this DVD.  I wish they would put together more of them on different races and racers.  A must see!  There was plenty of the trials and tribulations that the runners they followed went through, in their training, personal lives and throughout the race.",1173312000,,419,4.859154929577465
1900238,4,B0000A02X7,"If you love running, you'll love these videos.  These people are fanatics.  It's a well-done documentary.  It moves well, asks the right questions, and it shows the suffering and achievement involved in such a race.  Very, very well done.  It's pretty much never boring, even for non-runners, who get to sit around and marvel that anyone would do such a thing.

It's about the 1999 Badwater 135, the 135 mile run through Death Valley that happens every summer.  It's not real long, but it's long enough to be interesting.

If moral things are an issue to you, like to me, then there's one old guy (the delivery guy who runs 20 miles plus three times a week) whose talking I always fast forward out because of cussing and crude comments.  Other than that, it's pretty clean.

There's also no chapters, which is pretty irritating for a DVD.  You have to fast forward or rewind to get anywhere you want to go like it's a video cassette.",1168300800,4,933,4.5602409638554215
1900239,5,B0000A02X7,"El documental muestra la dureza de esta prueba y hasta donde es capaz de soportar el cuerpo humano y la mente. Es increible ver como aguantan dia y noche en carrera, soportando temperaturas extremas, viento y desniveles. Se muestra sin escrupulos la fatiga, las ampollas, el agotamiento. Para m, que he participado en varios Ultras, es una pelicula que cualquiera que se adentre en este mundo debera ver. Es un ejemplo de tesn y de corage ver a dos corredores, con protesis ortopedicas de pierna y brazo, conseguir llegar a meta. Os la recomiendo.",1168300800,,547,4.829787234042553
1900240,5,B0000A02X7,"I never knew much about ulta races, the longest I ever raced was 10K but after seeing a north face ad in runner's world I thought how cool a person could run that long!...there was lots to read about ultra racing but nothing to watch, this was interesting, I'm motivated to try my hand at a marathon, it seems like small peanuts compared to ultra marathons. This film was interesting a real testament to what human's are capable of.",1167868800,,432,4.481012658227848
1900241,5,B0000A02X7,"I keep watching this documentary over and over, shedding tears every time. I am now obsessed with Badwater. I have volunteered to be on a crew next year. Even though some of the rules have changed since this was made, the documentary successfully recorded the battle one has with self to get thru 135 miles of insane terrain! I was surprised to see what kind of people run this kind of thing - such a wide cross section of runner types. If you think you ""can't"" do something, watch this DVD and see the handicap runners finish 135 miles in extreme temps!",1156204800,5,554,4.4411764705882355

7995008,4,B0000A02X7,"I thoroughly enjoyed this running documentary.  The viewer followers a select group of runners as they traverse 135 miles of the most grueling weather and terrain.  Most of us can't even imagine what it would take to not only qualify and train for an event such as this, but to also run in and finish (or not in many cases) something this serious and possibly life threatening.  I love to run and usually stick to the marathon and the 50k distance.  Those are difficult at times for me, now imagine running 5+ marathons in 120 degree heat in the beginning.  Unbelievable.

The runners themselves are captured beautifully.  You see them in the beginning as they are excited and pumped, then to them running and they are eager and happy to keep on keeping on.  Then you slowly see their attitude change in the slightest of ways.  Refusing to do some stuff their crew is asking, or talking less, smiling less.  Eventually they begin to alternate between moaning and complaining with smiles and hope.  The gruesome part is seeing their feet.  Their toenails falling off or turning a putrid brown.  One runner had huge marble size blisters that she proceeded to pop on camera as they squirted seemingly forever, over and over again.  Another runner was throwing up on camera.

Throughout it all you capture the essence of each runner as they go through the ups and downs of this grueling 135 mile race.  You begin to see their true colors and the determination that they have to make it to the finish line, even if all they can do is stumble across the finish line.  At times heart breaking, but most often heart lifting, I would recommend this to the running enthusiast.

It has runners with prosthetic legs and some with prosthetic legs and arms, very inspirational. The runners in this film are old,young,average people with normal jobs, dedicated, military member, a mom or dad, not professionals,men and woman, one of them powerwalked the whole thing. Funny moments and serious moments and everything in between. I have been running for eight years and take running seriously. I've ran XC and Track and have had some intence work outs. But these runners are the strongest runners. They run in 120 degree weather with sandstorms, they eat and sleep on their run. They have a team following them the whole way. They need resumes to qualify to run this race. To cut it short, WORTH buying, if you are a serious runner or need motivation to be your best BUY this film. I thought Pre Fontaine was tough, think again, he's just one of few strong and crazy runners. Great film.
