8464577,5,B005BYBZNQ,"I bought this mainly to use at our church's VBS this year to help teach kids to help others. The title is somewhat misleading, as the actual video portion of ""Bob Lends a Helping Hand"" is a short, but there are other stories on the DVD that supplement it well. The kids loved it and the adults enjoyed it too. Even my high school volunteers were glued to the screen. Keep up the great work, Big Idea!",1340668800,,400,4.207792207792208
8464578,2,B005BYBZNQ,"I purchased this for my kids for Christmas thinking it was a new story, but instead it was only a new song about Bob lending a helping hand and then two previously-released stories (Lyle the Kindly Viking and Big River Rescue) both of which we already had.  I find that very misleading.  I paid around $10 for a new song!!!  How disappointing! Buyer beware!",1326412800,9,357,4.546875
