8253135,1,B0013VBZHM,"First off I would like to say that I am a big fan of Master Adam Hsu. I have both of his books and have been reading his articles since the mid 90's. I also own his 2 Bajiquan dvds which is why I am so thouroghly disappointed in this awful Baguazhang dvd. According to Adam Hsu in the beggining stages of learning, after getting a firm grasp of linear bagua walking one must practice square walking before one can learn circlewalking. He wrote about this in one of his books. He stresses how sqare walking can significantly help in being able to walk the circle. That was one of the main reasons for buying this dvd as I cant find any video of square walking anywhere on youtube or any other website. I have a large Baguazhang video collection and Adam Hsu's dvd was the only one teaching this walking method. Unfortunatley the section of the dvd with square walking was about 5 seconds long as Adam Hsu walks a very small square ( the size of your typical kitchen floor tile) once with absolutly no explanation about it as its performed. Very frustrating.  The only other reason for buying this dvd was for the palm training section which I thought was the palm training excercises that was also taught in the begining levels of training that Adam Hsu mentions in his book. That part of the dvd was also very short and without much explanation done as a partner excercise not done solo. There is very little to no instruction in this dvd as things are only demonstrated for short amounts of time with not much explanation of what to do and how to do it. Definatley not a good dvd for learningBaguazhang.",1337990400,3,1604,4.437288135593221
8253136,2,B0013VBZHM,"I found it difficult to learn from this DVD. As with so many Masters who are proficient in the skills required to perform the forms, they don't necessarily have the skills to teach them well. By way of contrast and example, Paul Lam is an outstanding example of one who knows how to teach forms - especially to beginners. I suspect that after one learns the Ba Gua forms from a better teaching source, they could benefit from this tape - but I wouldn't recommend it for beginners with no background in the art.",1289779200,,510,4.4361702127659575
