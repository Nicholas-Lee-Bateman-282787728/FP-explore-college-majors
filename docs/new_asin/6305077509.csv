961387,1,6305077509,"okay... i rented this movie mainly because of its interesting title, and the things i read in ""Rolling Stone"" about it. but i found it to be a complete waste of time. i'll admit that the chaotic dialogue between  the three main characters is at some points pretty entertaining, and the  verbal revenge which the two girls exact upon the hapless bastard blake  gave me something of a feminist rush, but that's about all the movie has  going for it. i will conceed to the fact that robert downey jr. possesses a  lot of talent, and he definitely does the only good acting in this film.  however, the film itself seems to have no point whatsoever, and worse than  that, it has one of those really annoying inconclusive non-endings. it  might have redeemed itself if it had at least some good sex scenes... =D.  But it doesn't even have those. i don't reccommend it.",927849600,,862,4.545454545454546

961454,5,6305077509,"There's a reason I'm giving Two Girls and a Guy 5 stars- a BIG reason. It's not a chick flick!  At least not in the typical sense.  The comedy is actually of the darker variety, and the drama is based exactly in one setting the entire time- that being the boyfriends apartment room.  Not that being set in one location is a good thing, but focusing in one area the whole time allowed me to appreciate/pay attention to the writing more.

The story is very simple.  Two girls, Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner, are both standing outside their boyfriends apartment waiting for him to show up.  Natasha starts blabbing and bragging about her boyfriend, noticeably irritating Heather since she's barely acknowledging any of this which was hilarious, until Natasha reveals something that catches Heather's attention- that being, that they're both waiting for the SAME man!  Yup you probably know what this means- Robert Downey Jr.'s character has been dating two women unbeknownst to both.  Do they get angry?  Do they plot revenge?  Sort of...

Natasha comes up with this crazy idea to climb the nearby ladder to the second floor, break Robert's apartment window and let herself in.  She then lets Heather in through the front door.  From here, well the storyline STAYS inside this apartment room the entire time.  Both Heather and Natasha talk in tremendous detail about how much of a scumbag and liar Robert is.  ""How could he date and use two women at once"" is the topic of conversation for a looooong while.  Really memorable storytelling.  So far the story's entirely a drama.  The elements of dark comedy come in later when Robert attempts... you know what, I'm not going to spoil that part, haha.  It's too good to reveal!  He does *something* extreme later on but let's continue the story.

Anyway Robert eventually comes home and starts singing out loud in theatrical fashion assuming he's alone.  Turns out he's an actor which is an interesting part of his character because for the entire movie you're never really sure if he's acting or sincere when these two women not only confront but DRILL him extensively, in-depth, for the ENTIRE movie.  Is he lying or being honest?  Truthfully, sometimes it's hard to tell which is a fascinating part of his character.  The way he acts you just don't wanna believe a single word he says.  I won't reveal what happens at the end but if you've been paying attention the whole time, there are at least two major surprises.  I can't spoil either of them of course.  Two Girls and a Guy is clearly a movie where you don't want to give too much away.

Robert is such an arrogant jerk too.  Neither Heather or Natasha (who both get along well with each other by the way) buy into ANYTHING he says.  Robert's character is clearly the type that uses women to his advantage.  The only problem with this film that I can see is that the storytelling never ventures beyond the apartment room.  Otherwise brilliant.  Brilliant for the way it focuses/discusses in fine detail how wrong it is to cheat on your loved ones.  Tremendous and believable acting by everyone involved.  Basically the writing and the setting almost feels like you're in a psychiatrist's office, but the many emotions, wonderful characters and the way the story packs such a stronghold on the viewers make this movie a surprising classic.  Another interesting part of the story is Robert's mother who Robert confides in through phone calls whenever he feels overwhelmed by the two women.  It makes him look like a shallow mommy's boy which is hilarious.

Anyway just don't make the mistake into thinking Two Girls and a Guy is yet another poorly written, fast-moving typical chick flick that accomplishes very little.  Strong writing and characters and a memorable storyline focusing on drama elements brings it to life in a very different way.  Highly recommended for both girls and guys.",1429056000,,3904,4.819277108433735

You could have switched them out with any other moderately talented actresses and it wouldn't  have mattered.  This movie was a vehicle for him to shine, as is any movie he appears in. He was fantastic in Heart and Souls, Chances Are and ofcouse Chaplin.  Why has this man never gotten an Oscar for a lead role???  He does comedy, drama, sings, dances and the list goes on and on. He has racked up 81 awards. I looked it up.  Just hope the Academy realises this before it's too late.  And I'm not talking lifetime Achievement, as in lets give this to him before he croaks.

961539,3,6305077509,"At first glance, the premise of 1997's ""Two Girls and a Guy"" looks like an easy setup for a comedy, as two women unexpectedly met at the same door to their boyfriend's apartment.  The two women decide to confront the two-timer.  What follows is a little deeper than comedy, in the talented hands of Robert Downey jr as the guy and Heather Graham, and Natasha Gregson Wagner as the two girls.  The initial confrontation will turn into an intense reveal of the respective relationships.  More than one person may be lying, and the full resolution of the story, oddly, depends on a fourth person not present.  The setting of the movie is slightly claustrophobic, as virtually all the action takes place inside a single apartment.  There is some terrific acting here, and it is a bit of a shame the movie didn't do better in its theatrical release.  Recommended.",1405814400,,858,4.718120805369128

His portrayal of Blake is gut wrenching, funny, anger enducing, loving, sexy and he takes you through all of this with him as only RDJ can do  When confronted by his girlfriends, is he telling the truth or lying?  They don't really know nor do we but we want to believe because he is a nice guy even after the pain he causes and you find yourself wanting him to somehow come
out ok - all due to Downey's ability to convince you that, as ridiculous as his actions and lies are, he is the one who

The set-up is squirm-inducing uncomfortable. What IS amazing and memorable is Downey's performance. Not only does he deliver his usual tour-de-force acting, but he sings and dances. Downey, now apparently in permanent recovery, was still very much in the throes of drug and alcohol addiction when ""Two Girls and a Guy"" came out. When I saw it, I kept thinking, Downey has so much talent he can't deal with it. He's the Judy Garland of his generation.

as a huge fan of rdj i find the movie amazing. the film almost comes off as play with the constant dialogue and single location. if you're a fan of rdj, you will definitely like this movie, for his soliloquy in front of the mirror, hamlet recitation, piano playing and singing.

961652,4,6305077509,"First of all I'm surprised this went to Blu.  I remember seeing this in the theater when it first came out and instantly liked it.  Going in though, you have to be aware that this is a 100% dialogue driven film.  There's no action really, there's only three actors in the movie (well five, if you count the two in the very beginning for about two minutes).  If you go into this expecting anything but essentially a theatrical play, then you may be disappointed.

Personally I think this is one of Robert Downey Jr's best roles to date, along with Less than Zero.  I think roles like this, in which he shines so well as the perennial f*** up, doomed by his own inabilities to accept the fact that there are people who will not just abandon him at the slightest whim, hits too close to home for many people.  They can't separate the fact that he's acting, from his real life struggles with drug addiction and other things.

And as such, when he puts on a great performance, people toss it aside and say ""it's just him playing himself"".  Which is a great disservice, I think.

Heather Graham is very good in this, as is Natasha Gregson-Wagner (daughter of Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood), although Wagner can be EXTREMELY grating after awhile.  She comes off as simultaneously cute & sexy, and irritating.  Eventually you're waiting for someone to just yell at her to shut up.

But all three actors do a very good job with this, and from what I've read there was virtually no script.  It was all improv, and I think that speaks volumes to how good these actors are.

I've read reviews of this which say that it's a movie where people just talk about nothing.  And that's not true at all.  It couldn't be farther from the truth.  This film, while not a perfect film, is a great film as it pertains to relationships.  I think many people watching can relate to this predicament that Downey Jr. finds himself in.

Perhaps not the exact situation, but we've all lied to significant others.  We've all been involved with people and perhaps you don't feel exactly the same as they do, but you lie and say you do.  If only to make them feel better.  But that ends up hurting them anyway when they find out.

Here we have Downey Jr. who's dating two women simultaneously, all the while telling them that he loves them, and only them.  Neither have any clue that he's doing this with someone else other than just them, thinking he's a one woman man.

Very good film, and one definitely not to be missed by fans of Downey Jr.  Just know what you're getting into with this.  It's not a big budget fancy special effects flick, and it's not an erotic threeway Cinemax flick, despite the provocative title.",1257379200,8,2689,4.477366255144033

961699,3,6305077509,"Carla (Heather Graham) and  Lou (Natasha Gregson Wagner) are two beautiful women who have never met and didn't think they had anything in common until one fateful day in New York. Both women are standing outside a sprawling loft when they get into a discussion about what pigs men are after both have just been hit on  by one rather forward guy whose girlfriend catches him chatting up are two leading ladies. Lou does most of the talking describing her dream of a boyfriend Blake (Robert Downey Jr.). Blake is an actor and he can talk anyone into ""buying a house without a roof."" ""Sounds irresistible"" Carla replies. After more gushing from Lou something doesn't sit right with Carla. She realizes that her boyfriend also an actor sounds a lot like Lou's love and both women realize that Blake is stepping out with both of them at the same time. They break into his loft and wait for him to return where they plan to confront him and demand answers. Once the women break into the loft this film becomes like a stage play (a comparison that Toback hates as evidenced by his commentary track) taking place in one location and with a lot of talking. The acting has to be good to keep your interests with a film like this and fortunately it is. Graham is beautiful and great as the more self assured and forward of the two women but Wagner is given more of the funnier dialogue and has several rapid fire monologues. Of course Downey has the most difficult role having to be sympathetic and charming explaining his deception to both ladies. He is good though not perfect throughout. He is obviously playing Toback which he has done before to better effect in their previous collaboration The Pick Up Artist. Downey does have several funny moments though such as when he convinces the girls of what a great actor he is by playing Hamlet and when Graham asks him not to refer to her by name he replies "" What am I supposed to call you, Timmy?"" Of course Toback explores the same raw sexual material that he has explored in all of his work most notably the debate over ownership of the phallus that he first introduced in his debut film Fingers. Basically its eighty four minutes of talking that is occasionally funny, sometimes uncomfortable and truthful but ultimately leading to an ending that doesn't quite work. I would recommend that you check out the Pick Up Artist which is Downey's and Toback's first collaboration. It is PG-13 tame for Toback and is a sweet romance with Molly Ringwald as the object of affection and with a great supporting cast including Dennis Hopper, Harvey Keitel, and Danny Aiello.",1224028800,2,2607,4.628509719222462

Heather Graham was adorable as always and I liked the other girl too. Robert Downey Jr. did a great job as a typical womanizer and actually did manage to wrangle himself out of this one(somewhat) except he learned a few things he didn't want to know in the process. I am glad I watched it and had a good time....",1190073600,2,713,4.3283582089552235
961703,4,6305077509,"Why does Downey Jr. lie to the two girls? Here's my take on it. Not because he couldn't get both of them without lying: after all, neither of the girls are married to him, and he could've openly had two or three semi-serious girlfriends and a few groupies also as a bachelor and up-and-coming star-on-the-rise actor starting to get steady work. He lied because he wanted not just superficial sex but two serious and involved relationships at the same time, two real girlfriends at the same time, almost like bigamy; he didn't lie to get the girls to physically put-out, he lied to get them to spiritually commit a deeper part of themselves that they otherwise wouldn't. So when he says that he loved both of them equally (or almost equally), he pretty much means it; and when he had said to each girl that other girls now disgust him, he really meant that too, in the spiritual sense that is about all other girls except the two main ones he was involved with. He may have had a few mainly physical encounters but spiritually and romantically he's basically tied to these two women, one of whom will eventually have to go because of time constraints or a slightly higher level of incompatibility. The same would obviously apply if a girl had willingly put herself in this rather flattering dilemma (as the poster for Truffaut's `Jules et Jim' on the wall constantly implies, a film in which there was no deception but which ended tragically because Jeanne Moreau refused to give up her irrational desire to be loved by more than one man until she turned off both of them).

What I think Toback is trying to do is show people ways of communicating they haven't considered or have been programmed to overlook. He's trying to say that this situation doesn't have to end up negatively or in some kind of overblown melodrama, though it's definitely prime material for farce. Every attempt at taking it to that cliche area of hurt and shattered and devastated feelings, and overblown psychotic role playing imposed by half-baked and prejudiced societal rules is shown to be not only ridiculous but transcendable by only a little strength and street-or-book-or-other-wise perspective. Of course, the Natasha Gregson Wagner character is the one that shows the most strength because she gets the short end and refuses to stoop to fighting for her man with Heather Graham; not only that, she doesn't even break relations with Graham and asks her to call her. . In 99 out of a hundered other films as soon as Graham and Downey start getting it on in that other room, Gregson Wagner would've broken a whole bunch of Downey's bric-a-brac-furniture, stormed out the apartment cursing and slammed the door, or, barged in on them and had a tantrum wanting to kill both of them. But is that kind of impulsive over-reaction all human beings are capable of? No, and Toback shows that sex outside a serious relationship, even if it's with someone in an equally serious relatoinship who is a direct threat, is not the end of the world and it can be dealt with intelligently and calmly, not through some ridiculous tantrum.

What Toback is laying down here in this film isn't anything new but basically a variation on what many widely read books of the late '60s and early '70s dealt with, books like `Pairing,' `Open Marriage,' etc. They dealt with the fact that sexual desires don't go away after marriage or the attainment of a serious relationship and should not be restricted because that creates more problems than it solves. Desires are then only willingly & voluntarily not acted upon by the parties concerned because the time spent pursuing them could be better and more efficiently spent in the main relationship which is already a source of much joy. They emphasize the importance of the strength of the main relationship so that even if the desires are acted upon physically, that's where it usually ends and the level of intimacy achieved doesn't seem to be worth it compared to the main relationship, therefore further reinforcing the main bond. In other words, a positively re-inforcing circle instead of vicious one. If there's no strong relationship aside from the strictly physical to hold a man and a woman together, then that couple has no business pretending they have a real relationship anyway and traditional restraints will make cheating more attractive, not less. The problem, of course, is always TIME, all serious relationships in the end end up pretty much monogamous (in spirit if not exactly 100% in physical fact) because a serious relationship takes work, real work, and  there is simply too much time and energy required to carry on even as little as two serious love affairs at once on a high level. They based these theories on research into why so many traditional marriages failed. People sneer at these theories now without even stopping to think but very little has changed and much has been reversed since the days of the sexual revolution. It may even be worse now than the 50s and 60s. If you take a look around society at traditional marriages that have strict restrictions,  you'll probably find that for every relatively good relationship that hasn't gone sour yet, there are at least 10 happy-to-be-mediocre lukewarm ones maintained for the sake of appearances that can be seen through in two seconds, and 10 more that are already dead and headed for divorce or have gone beyond the stultifying effects of a 'closed relationship' to cheating and deception to find some 'happiness-fix' on the side. In Toback's film, Downey's deception leaves Natasha Gregson Wagner out in the cold but she's strong enough to not give too much of a damn about someone like Downey whose lying has put her in a position to get hurt because she happens to be a tad less interesting to him than Heather Graham who has just reclaimed him by giving him sex; she's strong enough to not show her hurt for his satisfaction or to stoop to wanting to fight for the little weasel with Graham. She stays above it, talks things over a while, wishes them the best and moves on. Not realistic? If we're talking in general terms absolutely not; but in individual terms, absolutely yes. There are probably 9 or 10 people out of a hundred strong enough to pull a Natasha Gregson Wagner exit. And the value of Toback's film is that it shows that rather than the 90 ways how it ought to end in farce and total disaster.

Therefore, despite some flaws, Toback's film is highly recommended because it breaks cliches at every turn in the dialogue and tries to promote intelligent ways as opposed to culturally pre-programmed ones of dealing with painful dilemmas. All you weak people out there with your love-hate over-reaction programming and jealous rages, watch and learn how to be more sophisticated, strong, considerate, compassionate, hip, cool and classy.

961741,5,6305077509,"I watched this movie through once and hit play again as soon as the dvd finished spinning back to the main menu. It's been years, if ever, since I did that with any movie. Considering that some of the scenes were obviously filmed when they'd barely had a chance to read through the lines, it says a lot for the successful emotional imagery in this movie.
You've probably seen plot synopses (or will if you scroll down) and seen plenty of zero-star reviews. If you decide to see this movie, be prepared for a few scenes that really do look amateurish. They're beatuifully shot and all the production values are spot-on, but Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner just aren't those rare gifted actors who can walk in and give a perfect performance after a day or two of rehearsal. Robert Downey *is*, though.
In the scenes with Downey, Graham and Wagner seem to wake up a little bit and show enough assuredness to really hit their lines. All the dialog is interesting -- provocative or funny -- but some of the readings clunk, especially in the early going. But Downey improvises, sings, plays piano, and hits all kinds interesting emotional changes. His soliloquy from Hamlet is so good that you will understand perfectly well why Mel Gibson was willing to mount a production of Hamlet with him at the Taper Forum (L.A.) even though Downey couldn't get insured at the time. And Gibson took a bath on it when Downey got arrested, and all he said to the press was ""you should have seen him in readings...good enough to break your heart."" Or words to that effect. Man, that would have been a Hamlet to see.
This movie really does its job when it finally gets moving. If you can imagine being in the mood for watching people talk to themselves in the mirror and talk to each other in long, hyper-animated, self-serving sentences, then it's hard to imagine a better movie to suit. Personally, I kinda think the people who hated this movie probably hated Lost in Translation because there ""wasn't enough going on"" and the characters ""didn't hit the town and see all that Tokyo has to offer."" Ignore the fact that this movie takes place in New York, and try to picture how you'd feel if you busted somebody for cheating on you, or got busted for cheating on them, and then see this movie and see how their responses measure up.",1077926400,4,2322,4.584134615384615

Simply put, two women meet while waiting for their respective boyfriends who, they quickly ascertain, is one and the same, a New York actor.  They lie in wait for him in his loft as he returns from a job in LA.  First one, then both women proceed to impel him to reveal and explain his deception and insist on forcing him to identify truth and meaning.  With the exception of one sexual scene in which both actors retain their clothing but which required 14 edits to get it down to an R rating, the action largely consists of changes in the wind of the dialogue, with segues often provided by telephone calls to and from unseen characters.  So it goes for 90 minutes.
For the most part, the characters command attention, making the 90 minutes pass without dragging.  This essentially comes off like a staged play, not a flaw in itself necessarily but the filmmaker invested energy in the concept and characters, not in actual filming techniques that might better define this as a cinematic art work apart from the drama.  The setting is a stunning loft that holds attention as much as the characters; it adds conceptual commentary and allows for some interesting blocking-but a stage play could have replicated it and made similar use.
Robert Downey, Jr., gives a remarkable performance as the guy lost in his deceptions.  Natasha Gregson Wagner completely owns her part and takes it to the core and back.

RDJ is excellent as the self-absorbed womanizer who is caught having an affair with two different women at the same time.  Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson-Wagner play the two girlfriends to perfection.  What amazed me about this movie was RDJ's ability to take what appeared to be a one-dimensional character who you want to hate for being such a jerk, and turn him into a three dimensional character who you feel sympathy for, like it or not.  My only complaint is that the movie is way too short at approximately 90 minutes.  See this one!",988243200,6,690,4.524193548387097

Downey was okay, he was a little on the annoying side because the character he plays is a two yiming drama queen who has yet to come our of the closet.  Graham amd wagner play his two girlfriends who meet accidentally when they both show up at his apartment to welcome him home from a trip.  They find out they are both dating him and decide to break into his apartment to wait for him.  Upon arriving, they both hide and listen to his arrogant preachings about himself  and the identical phone messages he leaves for them.

961853,5,6305077509,"""Two Girls and a Guy"" is among the wittiest and most realistic dramas I have seen n recent years.  Although it has been criticized for being too ""talky"" and not following a structured plot, this movie struck me by its realism.  The characters and their conversations are rich and engaging.  This is one of Heather Graham's finest performances.  Natasha Gregson Wagner is also impressive and successful as the other woman.  The relationship and comradery between these two characters--total opposites--is very enjoyable.  And then there is Robert Downey Jr.  Stealing the focus of every scene he is in, he is extraordinary.  He is flawless in his portrayal of Blake, the lying, cheating, needy, and defensive actor.  His interaction with himself is as captivating as the scenes where all three actors are conversing.  He invokes so much emotion and frustration from his audience, and creates one of the most complex and fascinating characters in modern cinema.",983577600,6,959,5.1688311688311686
961854,3,6305077509,"2 Girls and a Guy doesn't really come alive until Robert Downey Jr. enters the picture.  Until then, the conversation between the 2 girls seems endless, contrived and I found it hard to even find their acting believeable.  Robert breathed life into the film as well as the 2 girls.  It was an interesting study of relationships that I found quite disturbing at times.  And no matter how much of a jerk Downey's character was for lying to and cheating on his women, I don't think he deserved the verbal beating he received from the 2 of them.  He actually made me feel more for the guy than I felt for the 2 young women.  I ended up liking Heather's character a lot and finding her quite sincere.  But I found Natasha's character very flaky and I never knew if she was being honest or not.  I suppose that's what her character was supposed to be like, and I do like Natasha a lot.

961856,2,6305077509,"James Toback has failed in creating a black comedy about ""revenge, lust and the battle of the sexes"" in the flat, uninspiring Two Girls and a Guy. It is essentially a dialogue driven movie, which obviously necessitates the need for sharp, quick and intelligent dialogue; however, the end result is just a spree of bad language and name calling with no real resolution. Writers like David Mamet and Neil LaBute would have had a field day with a movie like this, but James Toback's effort as writer/director ultimately amounts to little more than a smarter version of The Jerry Springer Show, right down to the bisexuality.
  The premise of the film is quite clever: two women await the return of their respective boyfriend, only to find that they are dating the same man. Lou and Carla (played by Natasha Gregson Wagner and Heather Graham respectively) are these two women, and their characters are intriguing at first. Lou is a talkative, bubbly girl with a thirst for spontaneity; Carla is a more reserved woman bristling with a beautiful intensity. They are interesting characters, yet their development is truncated in the confusion of what follows.
  Neither Carla or Lou knew about each other, so they decide to hatch a plot of revenge against Blake (Robert Downey Jr.) - their two timing boyfriend. Downey plays his part very well - he is the most capable actor of the trio and he breathes life into the uninspiring dialogue he is given. His entrance is quite funny - whilst Carla and Lou hide (they broke into his apartment), he leaves messages for each of them to call him. Then, both women show themselves and the conflict begins. The film then takes a serious dive.
  What could have been a series of electrifying arguments, ala Glengarry Glen Ross and Your Friends and Neighbours, turns into a series of boring exercises in tedium... Also, Downey's self-absorbed Blake gradually becomes more and more annoying due to his penchant for mumbling and skipping over sentences.
Putting it simply: Two Girls and a Guy is not a very good movie, so don't waste your time on it.",980812800,,2079,4.809523809523809
961857,4,6305077509,"This movie plays like a long running one act play, with basically only three central characters.  Only two other people are actually seen in this movie, at the very beginning when the two girls are waiting outside, but they could have just as easily been written out and nothing of the movie would have been lost.  Everything in the movie takes place right outside an apartment house, for the first five minutes, and the rest of the time it all happens inside one of the apartments.  I'm not trying to be vague here, just giving the general layout of what's going on.
 The movie really begins when the two girls, both waiting for their boyfriend to come home so they can surprise him, are surprised themselves to find out they are both waiting for the same guy.  Heather Graham plays Carla, and Natasha Gregson Wagner plays Lou, short for Louise.  Louise breaks into Blakes, Rober Downey Jr's, apartment, and the two girls wait to confront him when he comes home.
 This premise sets up a mostly entertaining movie, in which the womanizing Blake lies, bluffs, and stumbles through arguments about why what he did wasn't so bad.  The women show much outrage and rail against his masculinity at his pathetic act, and call him just about every name in the book, and then some.  One of the best scenes is one where Blake stares at his own reflection in the mirror, chastising himself for what he is, and trying to promise himself that he'll change, but even he's not sure if he can believe himself.
 As time passes, more secrets are revealed, the girls spill the beans on their own infidelities, and we come to know these people better.  They seem to embrace the desire for love more than the actually conception of what love is.  None of them seem ready for, nor really expecting, the permanent meant for life type of love, as revealed by their confessions, and propositions for one another.
 The ending, unfortunately, is a little bland, and leaves things a little up in the air, but it would have been hard to have slapped a happily ever after ending onto this movie, so I guess it mostly fits the character of the story.  I guess I would have just liked to have known what Lou was up to at the end, and whether Carla ever takes her up on her offer.  In my mind, she does.",979603200,,2270,4.5024390243902435

The cast is impressive, the dialogue reasonably  intelligent, but it drags so, you'll be relieved when it finally draws to  an inconclusive end.

961900,2,6305077509,"""chicks"" simultaneously.  Many people watch this movie mainly because of Downey Jr. and they are right. He is good as always, but he can not save the film, no matter how hard he tries.
He plays a challenging  role of an almost schizophrenic, emotionally confused and  ""not-so-young-any-more"" actor. The actor, who is  ""struggling"", but somehow can afford to live the most gorgeous  and exquisite loft in NY city [what's up with that? ].  He is  the NORMAN  BATES of THE 90s.  He is a psycho, who is obsessed with his MOMMY. But,  instead of killing women, he prefers to keep them around for a lot of sex  [may be even some threesome].  Having a lot of sex, though, does not make  him any less sexually and emotionally frustrated.
The beginning of the  film is terrif... I thought, ""wow, this is gonna be good: a lying,  cheating actor gets caught in the trap of his own making..."".  But,  after all three  [the only three] characters had finally met up in the  loft, the plot just went nowhere. All that's left was a lot of streaming  monologues from Downey and occasional kinkiness from one of the  girls.
The only sex scene of the film is, however, very interesting.  I  think it is good and kinda unusual...not a typical Downey Jr. thing.
I  think this story could have looked much better in the theater. On stage,  however, Downey Jr. would not have a chance for re-takes.  In this film, he  looks as though he is on the very edge...",960681600,,1437,4.51171875

I sat through  the entire movie and thinking it might have not been the NC-17 version but  rather an R version.  This is not the only reason I disliked the movie.  We  were not given enough background regarding Blake Allen's (RDJ)mother.  Why  was he so unnaturally attached to her?  Also, who did he inherit his  magnificent loft from?
