8124114,3,B000FKP0UU,"This is part of the History Channel series ""Automobiles"" which focus on a particular make or model. In this case the brand that is front-and-center is Buick.

I'm sure many will be surprised to learn that Buick began as an affordable car along the same lines as the Ford Model T. Buick's were well-made cars that had a reputation for quality. The car brand took off as soon as it was combined with other brands under the General Motors umbrella by GM founder William Durant.

I think the video does a fairly good job of showing the evolution of Buick through the years and the kind of cars they built, eventually becoming one of the premier brands of GM. We did get to see a number of the cars make by Buick through the years.

Unfortunately, I found this was too infrequent for my taste. The video strayed quite often by delving into the times such as the roaring 20's, the depression, the go-go years of the 50's when everything was going well. It talked about union efforts to organize the auto industry, the war effort, etc. I think they wasted time (remember, this DVD is only 50 minutes) on tangential issues and topics that could have been used to show their engineering accomplishments such as the first modern automatic transmission, the first 12-volt system, the first 4-wheel brakes.

I felt the DVD did a fairly good job of following the Buick brand from beginnings to today, but wasted too much time on other things in a DVD already too short. I give this DVD three stars.",1394928000,,1485,4.550561797752809
8124115,1,B000FKP0UU,"I cannot recommend this video to any but the most diehard Buick fans.  I expected to see a history of Buick.  Instead I got a leftist commentary on unions, poor quality Buicks, etc.  The writers were clearly anti-business.  I could excuse the misidentification of various Buicks, year and model, but I didn't need social or historical commentary to put things into context.  I will make sure I do not order other automotive titles from the History Channel.  I wasted my money.",1303430400,9,476,4.814814814814815
