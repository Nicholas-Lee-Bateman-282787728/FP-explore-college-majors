8498625,1,B004AYCYEC,I bought this knowing full well this was an independant movie. And was on a micro budget. Just when I watched it I was totally let down. This movie was a big rip off!!!!! I mean you watch 2 woman most of the time naked. And throw in a little blood and call it a horror movie. Come on!!!!! I liked when you found out what the head actress is at the end of the movie. That I admit was a cool concept. Just the movie itself was trash. How this movie won awards is beyond me. Please people pass on this movie. And before I end my review yes this movie is only 16 minutes long.,1422489600,,572,3.8974358974358974
