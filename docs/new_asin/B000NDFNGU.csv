8177876,4,B000NDFNGU,"This is a pretty good book on the subject.  I gave it a four because I believe this is a worthy subject and needs more attention to details.  In other words, the book, as good as it is, needs many more and detailed photos.  Otherwise, perhaps, it could have added more info on the manufacturers and any history/interesting background on each model.  The photos, as they were in number, are quite good in quality.  I do recommend this book for anyone wanting a brief look at these samples of the toy boat.",1347926400,,504,4.434782608695652
8177877,5,B000NDFNGU,"I have been fascinated by ocean liners since I was a little kid, and this video had a great deal to do with that!  I used to watch Titanic In A Tub when I was home sick from school (probably as early as Kindergarten) and stole the tape from my folks when I moved away from home years ago. I just ordered the DVD and can't wait to see it in a high resolution format.  The shots of all the toy boats and the wonderful sweeping nostalgic shots of the real ships that inspired their design makes this a video I highly recommend.",1213747200,8,524,4.077669902912621
