8252910,5,B0013TO4PY,"This DVD is outstanding, Dean seems to be the only dude out there that is willing to provide an informative and detailed tutorial of tattooing basics.  You can search the web and gather everything that you can on tattooing but you will still be like, ""how the hell do I do this"", or ""is this the proper technique?"".  Bottom line... if you are beginning in tattooing and you have no idea where to start and nobody cares enough to help you, then spend the money on this, well worth it.  I just wish that I would have bought this prior to starting...",1371686400,,547,4.3431372549019605

8252912,5,B0013TO4PY,"this dvd was very informative.  The narrator didn't mumble, slowed things down a couple times to really show you the motion of the needle etc.  I was definitely pleased.

It would have been 10.00 less expensive, but I would say that it was worth the money.",1324252800,,256,4.521739130434782
8252913,5,B0013TO4PY,"I am really looking into tattooing. I don't however have an ""in"" into the ""Tattoo world"". I've been doing a lot of research; books mainly. This DVD was recommended on a tattoo forum. So I bought it. The production quality is first class! The info for a beginner (like me) is great. Even though I've been reading for the last year or more I still learned a lot. It's nice that someone of Dean Deakyne's caliber has made this incredible resource. It's also something you will want to watch several times. Its well worth the money. I will soon buy his other DVDs!",1296518400,,560,4.446601941747573
