7877439,5,6304794509,This is great.  Everyone should watch this so that we know things are not that serious.  I give it two thumbs up!,1313625600,,113,4.090909090909091
7877440,4,6304794509,"I purchased this video because its description said she helped people cope with stress through humor. I have a lot of stress in my life and began watching this video in the morning while getting ready for my day. She is truly enjoyable and addresses serious issues of stress and anger with gentle humor. She doesn't CURE stress, but she sure helps to alleviate it. She offers humor with a purpose. I would recommend any of her videos.",1298851200,,434,4.576923076923077
7877441,5,6304794509,"Loretta is a must have for those who want to share with groups who suffer from stress and burnout. Also, good at home if you are suffering the same. Some find her to be less than funny, but most people laugh and understand the message. It's a wonderful teaching tool and Loretta is a break from the traditional teaching style.",1223251200,,326,4.45
7877442,3,6304794509,"This is the third special that Loretta LaRoche taped for PBS pledge breaks.  LaRoche specializes in using humor to deal with stress.  Finding the humor in stressful events can make them seem less stressful.  Her first special ""The Joy of Stress"" is the best of the three; this special seems to me to be the weakest of the three, with sing-alongs bogging things down.  However, she still makes some good points, and humor abounds.  If you need a laugh break to de-stress, check out LaRoche!!",1193011200,3,490,4.7176470588235295
7877443,5,6304794509,"This video is just as good as the first two she made. It's more in depth of what she talks about, but still her sense a humor makes it very enjoyable.",1029196800,3,150,3.870967741935484
7877444,2,6304794509,"The Joy of Stress and Humor Your Stress are, each of them, quite delightful.  How Serious is This is a duplicate and her energy is lagging at the beginning.  I found that the last half was the most inviting to see.  I have shown the first two above many times to groups of people and they  have never laughed so hard as they did watching her.",936230400,18,342,4.136363636363637
