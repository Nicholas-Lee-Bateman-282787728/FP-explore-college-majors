8621578,3,B00GA9F3AC,"Just finished The Comeback, and actually enjoyed it. It was a little slow in places, but kept my attention due to some of the weirdness mainly, which brings me to a question: Was Webster (David Doyle) actually in on it? If you haven't seen the film, stop here: 1) Was it just a complete coincidence that he would set up his former star in a house with 2 goody toe-shoes, mourning parents who have a hatred against Conner? 2) Webster was very quick to dismiss his assistant, saying he got a letter on his desk that she had went away, but would the old couple be that saavy to sneak into a record producer's office and leave such a letter? 3) On the assistant again, Webster says something to the effect of ""Don't worry, you will see her again real soon and not to worry."" The way he says it implies that he's going to be joining her because he knows she's going to meet her demise. 4) Throughout the film, his character always had a layer of envy or hidden vendetta against his star, almost as if he wants him to fail. 5) The act with the trio of girls singing has another scene with a female prodigy coming to him asking why she has never been introduced to anything bigger after being just a back-up for 6 years -- the same amount of time Conner was gone from the spotlight. I didn't see any of this addressed in the commentary, but there was mention of another person adding elements to the script so I wonder if whether Webster was intentionally left out as to give the audience something to think about (I doubt that) or the director actually didn't pick up on these nuances to make the same connections -- either way, watch it for yourself. I think someone got away with it!",1397088000,3,1679,4.333333333333333
