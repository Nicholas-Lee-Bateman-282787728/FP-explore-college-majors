622031,5,6303307779,"A usual formulaic Roy Rogers, (Leonard Slye, born in Cincinnati, OH and raised in cities in the east.),  takes me back to the halcyon days of my youthno, I didn't see them in the theaters, I used to watch them on PBS when I was a kid. This is the first picture I've ever seen him in without Dale Evans. (This movie was made in 1938, when he was still married to Grace Wilkins.) Mary Hart was good, but no Dale Evans; and I wonder if Hart could really cold play banjo like she was shown in the movie. Thoroughly enjoyed the picture. Note: Jackson's Hole was not named for an outlaw, it was named for David Jackson who was a trapper and, later, majority stockholder, for the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. Jackson discovered the 'Hole' around 1800 (prior to 1807). It was called a 'hole' because the only way in was to descend the steep mountains surrounding it. I own a home there and don't recall a ""pass"" to enter the valley. The proper name of the area is Jackson's Hole, not Jackson Hole.",1421280000,,988,4.34054054054054

622036,5,6303307779,"For some reason this movie has alluded me over the years, and now I'm glad for the chance to see it. The ALPHA dvd is very good, or at least so by my standards, and I let you know if an ALPHA dvd is substandad (BELLS OF ROSARITA for example).
Great, and I do mean GREAT direction by that un-sung master of the REPUBLIC B-Western Joe Kane, who comes off unduly as a sort of low budget John Ford. Wonderful composition shots, well-framed with an artsy feel. You have to admire the skill and workmanship that went into shooting this low budget programmer.
As for the plot; like so many of Roy's by Kane from this era, it's almost surreal,or dreamlike with harsh reality mixing easily with cornpone humor and downhome songs.
Roy is co-owner of a ranch with Milt Brower whose former badguy cronies show up one day and want to involve him in a grand cattle rustling scheme. Milt refuses, gets framed then captured, and needs to be vindicated by Roy.
What we have here is Roy and friends singing carefree on a hayride, featuring songs by the then popular duo of LULU BELLE and SCOTTY, punctuated by the downright nastiness of actor Stanley Andrews (...later the TV old ranger on DEATH VALLEY DAYS) who would appear more comfortable in a Sam Peckinpah Western in the late 1960's. He's mean and nasty and chiding (as are his henchies) almost before his time in cinema. These are truly characters out of PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID or THE WILD BUNCH and they really offset the goings on with Roy and his picnic party crowd!!!
However, when Roy later sneaks up on the outlaw camp, climbs up the rock wall and shoots several of the outlaw guards from ambush (without fair warning), this almost comes across as even more disturbing than the viciousness of Andrew's (Pa Jackson's) gang!
So what you have here is probably something you've never really seen before (unless you're a fan of this stuff): comedy, songs, friendly down home people, murderous sadistic villians and cruel violence. Even vetern heavy Jack Ingram pops in for a few quick minutes as a paid bushwhacker out to shoot Roy in the back only to get blasted for his effort. Rather than bringing Ingram's body back into town Roy informs the sheriff that the body is lying back out on the trail.
These were weird times, and this is an example of REPUBLIC STUDIO's great output in the B-Western field of the mid 1930's. Gene Autry and The 3 Mesquiteers also provided essential viewing from the same studio...Try any combination of these Republic Roy/Gene/3 Mesquiteers series and I'm sure you'll be hooked!......Light years better than anything being offered on TV today.",1286668800,5,2621,4.675324675324675
622037,3,6303307779,"Shine On Harvest Moon, 1938 film

The film begins with a hay wagon going down a country road at night. The people are singing the song of the title. A man and his sons walk into a house and make themselves at home. This ranch has the best grazing land in Wyoming. It is also close to that pass. Jackson wants this ranch, even if he has to destroy it! But Roy Rogers and his friends show up just in time. (Jackson plans to steal cattle.) There is shooting and cattle stealing. Where are the outlaws hiding? The Cattlemen's Association will take action against this loss of productive property. They suspect an informer is tipping off Jackson. A song calms the disturbed cattle. Then the rustlers attack to steal the whole herd. Milt Brower decides to leave town. Was this the wrong thing to do? A song is useful here. Brower is brought to the Jackson ranch. Jackson boasts of his accomplishments: he doesn't pay taxes.

People celebrate the Fourth of July with fireworks [a lost freedom] and feasting. Jackson and his boys show up for the celebration. There is a turkey shoot, and another song. Later, we learn who is the secret partner of Jackson! [Not a surprise given the situation.] Is Rogers in danger? Not if he is the best shooter around. That note is a clue. Can they bait a trap to catch Jackson and his partner? The Jackson gang shows up at night to steal the herd. The ranchers are warned and gather. The guards of the pass are neutralized so the posse can enter and block the road. Jackson's men fall, can he make a getaway? There is a terrific fight, and Rogers wins. Jackson's partner is arrested by Sheriff Clay. The film ends with the title song for a happy ending.

Note how Jackson rubs his left eye before he shoots right-handed. Was this symbolism? There is a recurring theme in these westerns: the small rancher has to beware of a predatory big rancher. [Perhaps the concerns of a small movie studio about the danger from the big movie studios?] Wyoming was the state where such things happened. You won't find this in the schoolbooks, but you can read ""The Banditti of the Plains"" by Asa Mercer about the events in Johnson county.",1283212800,,2151,4.5244215938303345
