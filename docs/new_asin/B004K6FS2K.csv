8432458,3,B004K6FS2K,"Great to have in the Muay Thai martial arts collection.  I've watched it about 5 time this year.
There is about 20 minutes of Muay Thai theory that is interesting.",1334707200,3,163,4.433333333333334
8432459,5,B004K6FS2K,Another instant classic. A martial arts movie on the level far above The Karate Kid. In a way it surpasses Ong Bak.,1327363200,,115,4.2727272727272725
8432460,4,B004K6FS2K,"If this film says nothing else, director/writer Kongkiat Khomsiri seems to be a huge fan of Martin Scorsese. Using Scorsese's trademark storytelling techniques including voice over and flashbacks and the occasional slow motion, Muay borrows heavily if only thematically from films like Raging Bull and Goodfellas...

8432461,2,B004K6FS2K,"The movie as stated in the first review here is correct on every thing but i would give a extra half star. Since i cant it gets a 2 star. The movie does have action but is more geared on telling its story. The problem is at times the story is rushed and half way though the shooting style trys to be grimy after the 2 guys head of to the crime route. So the film is mixed and doesn't know what it wants to be.

I say rent if you can find it for rent or buy used...You might be able to rent from amazon and stream to your computer",1304208000,3,529,3.765765765765766
