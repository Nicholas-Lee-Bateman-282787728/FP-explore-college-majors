8659710,3,B00KLGGD90,True enough the movie was low budget  and no perfect A list actors but the whole real point of this movie was to show someones sturggles and depression  in there life u never know if someone out here in the real world is going thru this right now so it's basically more of a inspirational film and definitely for a mature audience who can take a real look and have a heart my heart really hurt for Kelly in this movie and there are some real Kelly's in the real world #have a heart and take a deeper look at things this is why ppl snap in the real world. It was a decent film,1487116800,,575,3.991304347826087
8659711,3,B00KLGGD90,One wonders how Kelly got hired to begin with.  Why would any boss send a completely untrained individual out to interface directly with customers?,1484179200,,147,5.125

8659713,1,B00KLGGD90,"I gave this one star because the acting was awful.  The point the film was trying to make was a good one, but it was very hard to focus on the point of the film when the acting was so bad.  Over exaggerated facial expressions on the part of pretty much every actor in the film but most especially from Kelly were extremely distracting.  Not sure I'd waste the time on this one, there are better films on this topic, has to be because it can't get much worse!",1462492800,,458,4.123595505617978
8659714,1,B00KLGGD90,"Terrible, extremely low budget, no talent waste of time. No redeeming qualities. The ""acting"" was absolutely just plain bad, the filming very amateurish.  I kept watching not believing anything put out could really be this bad.  I thought I was being punked.  Turn it off and stare at the wall... you'll get more out of it.  I have already spent more time on this review than this movie is worth, but if I can save one viewer, it will be worth it.",1442016000,,447,4.414634146341464

8659718,1,B00KLGGD90,"The acting was so bad I almost couldn't stop watching it!  I made it almost halfway through before I had to turn it off.  The main actor Kelly's facial contortions were ridiculous and constant...wasn't sure if she was about to have a seizure, laugh, cry, scream or all of the above.",1424476800,2,282,4.509803921568627
