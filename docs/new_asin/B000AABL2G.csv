8077065,4,B000AABL2G,"As all re-enacters say, don't be farby.  This Bio gives good history and what the era clothing looked like. He was a great soldier whom I would have followed thru Hell itself. (If I had been there).",1363996800,2,198,4.351351351351352
8077066,5,B000AABL2G,A very intersting man and a generals general. I've learned alot about Jackson over the years and it's hard to believe he never lost a battle. He has said a smaller army can beat a larger army every time by just hitting a piece of it. A born leader who had the talent to get the very best out of his army. Chanslerville was a masterpiece that is still hard to believe. It is also where Jackson was wounded by his own men and the hopes of the South soon faded.

8077067,5,B000AABL2G,"The DVD was wonderful.  A little boring for an 8 year old, whom the DVD was purchased for.  He had to do a Biography about a real person, and since Stonewall is an Uncle in our family, he wanted to do the report on him.  I thought the DVD would be quicker for him rather than reading a boring Civil War book, and it was.  It was very educational, very informative, had all the details we needed to know about his interesting life.  As an adult, I found it fascinating.",1273363200,,468,4.155555555555556
8077068,5,B000AABL2G,"Stonewall Jackson was perhaps the greatest military leader that the South had during the Civil War.  From Bull Run where he gained his famous moniker of Stonewall to Chancellorsville where he was wounded by his own frightened men, the South appeared to be the victor in a conflict which would shed the most innocent blood of the nation.

On the back cover, it says ""in an exhaustive investigation"".  This is a good introduction to Thomas Jonathan Jackson, aka Stonewall Jackson, but it is not exhaustive.

It is well done.  The historians adding their perspectives with tidbits tossed into the mix to bring flesh to the bones of a man who was feared by the North and revered by the South.

What drove Stonewall Jackson were his faith and his belief that he was his god's instrument on earth.  He lived by the motto, ""You may be whatever you resolve to be.""

This is how a simple farm boy without a formal education could go to West Point and graduate 17th in his class.  In the Mexican War he distinguished himself and was offered a teaching position in 1851 at the Virginia Military Institute.

He knew personal tragedy.  He dealt with loss as he did everything else-his determined faith in the divine purposes for his life and the nation.

The last battle of Stonewall Jackson ended at 3:15 pm on Sunday, May 10, 1863. At the age of 39, Thomas Jackson passed to his rest.  Shorty before this moment, his last words were-""Let us cross over the river and rest under the shade of the trees"".",1248480000,7,1490,4.577358490566038
8077069,4,B000AABL2G,Interesting background on historical and psychological profile of this important Confederate general.  I wish it was longer and deeper in content.,1231286400,,146,5.9523809523809526
8077070,5,B000AABL2G,"This is a man for had he not been killed by friendly fire the South would have gained in independence. Now i an not saying the south could have beaten the north Military but by 1864 the north was tired of loosing men and material to a war that was at the time going nowhere. This is a man in the spring of 1962 defeated three union army's a number of about 80,000 thousand men. Jackson with a force of men that never numbered more than 17,000 cleared them out of the Shenandoah Vally in one month. Had he been at Gettysburg There  would have been no way that he would not attacked cemetery hill and had it in the the south's hands before darkness. With the high ground now in the south's hands the union army would have no choice but to retreat. Who is to say after that what would have happened. I no what every body will say it didn't happen,and they are right.",1221350400,4,863,4.167664670658683
