8513530,5,B007ATHNG8,Interesting movie.  I enjoy independent movies especially when I know one of the actors or actresses.,1489536000,,101,5.3125
8513531,5,B007ATHNG8,"I feared this story would just be oppressively despairing, but it got better.
Well worth the anguish.",1485907200,5,101,5.0
8513532,3,B007ATHNG8,The movie is true to a certain extent but not that well acted or written. I've met people who were banished to Siberia in the prisons. Most did not make it out. This movie is just not that good. Not terrible but not worth renting.,1476144000,2,230,4.133333333333334
8513533,3,B007ATHNG8,Very interesting movie and I would have given it more stars but I just didn't really get it. Very much worth a watch tho.,1469923200,2,121,4.083333333333333

8513535,4,B007ATHNG8,"This little known gem was made on a shoestring, but the acting is great. It tells a story rarely told about the suppression of Christians under Stalin. Even more rare it speaks about the Russian Germans and how they were treated before the outbreak of WWII.

We hear a great deal about the Nazi persecutions, but no one seems to care that the communists killed in their camps 10 times more people than Hitler. There have been no Nuremburg Tribunals (where communists presided!) that took these monsters to task and the history taught in the schools strangely overlooks this.

Here you get a glimpse of the beginnings of the terror and how one man helps others to find strength to face the horror.",1388188800,15,696,4.650406504065041
8513536,3,B007ATHNG8,I bought this movie after finding out it was shot in the town I live in. Good little story and not bad for a low budget film. It's more a keepsake than a movie I'll watch over and over again.,1358208000,4,191,3.8
