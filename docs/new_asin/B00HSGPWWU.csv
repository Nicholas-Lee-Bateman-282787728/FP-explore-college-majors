8635400,1,B00HSGPWWU,"this isn't a proper dvd. it displays on a webpage and uses quicktime plugin to display the videos. problem is, quicktime hangs. note: i am running latest version of firefox and latest of quicktime. also, the explanatory text is barely related to the 'ethogram,' which consists of an alphabetically organized set of web pages consisting of photos, brief text and videos. the videos are mildly interesting, but like i say, the videos keep hanging, which renders this dvd virtually unusable. another problem: the text explaining fear, stress, and de-escalation is pretty good, but no attempt is made to relate the ethograms items to the explanatory text. in short, a big disappointment/waste of money. i was initially very interested in all three videos, but not anymore. around 30 bucks shot to hell",1417996800,4,797,5.091603053435114
