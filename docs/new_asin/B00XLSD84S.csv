8716270,5,B00XLSD84S,Hilarious and touching movie. I've watched this several times and plan to do so again as the characters are so well played.  Very funny right from the start until the end.  Enjoy the lamp post scene - probably my favourite.,1503705600,,223,4.55
8716271,5,B00XLSD84S,"I saw this movie at the Cinema Italy film festival in Atlanta, GA, the movie is an absolute delight. Fast paced humorous love story that you do not want to miss. In a similar style to ""Amelie"" notched up. From beginning to end you'll have a smile on your face, feel that life is wonderful, the sun is always shining, and love is always in the air. This might be tough to catch a screening in the U.S. as it only pops up at film festivals and hasn't been released in the U.S. so, buy it, you won't regret it.",1492905600,,507,4.08
