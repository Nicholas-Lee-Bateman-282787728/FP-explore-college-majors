8705951,5,B00UGPMB9C,"There were bound to be struggles between free grazers and ranchers as the West was being carved out and settled. This epic movie shows the plight of the last of the free grazers. The Spirit of the Old West has a charm about it, but it was inevitable that so-called progress would replace it. This movie lets us remember the charm of the old, free ways for a little while before encountering the new ways. It's a great movie to see.",1521504000,,431,4.333333333333333

8705955,5,B00UGPMB9C,"This is my favorite western, and has been since I first saw it. In my opinion, the gunfight scene is to this genre what the Bullitt car chase was to cop movies. I've turned multiple friends on to this movie and never heard a bad review. It's hard to believe this is the same guy that made 'Waterworld.
If you're a fan of westerns, this is one of the best modern ones.",1502323200,3,367,4.111111111111111
8705956,5,B00UGPMB9C,You don't see many Westerns any more. Thought Costner and DuVall were a great duo in the movie. Movie was filmed in Canada close to where I was in the Summer of 2003. Magnificent views there.,1492387200,2,191,4.333333333333333
