8077215,4,B000AABL3A,"This second installment was in DVD-R media,and seems to not be as crisp on screen as the first.  The subjects covered include: American and German rocket programs up until the Titan 4 failures of 1998/99, 1917 Chauchat machine gun failure, 1993 Thresher submarine sinking, 1943 Liberty ship losses due to weld breaks, 1956 Andrea Doria ocean liner sinking after collision with the Stockholm (pictured on the cover), 1978 Hartford Civic Center roof collapse, 1979 K.C., Mo. Kemper Arena roof collapse, 1928 St. Francis dam collapse above L.A., Ca., and the 1965 blackout over parts of N.E. USA and Canada.",1391904000,4,604,5.101010101010101

found in its entirety on the Modern Marvels-

Technology set. The Technology set is also sold

here on Amazon and has 7 more dvds and is only a

few dollars more than this. Don't make the mistake

I did...  Ok dvd but nowhere near enough content

for the price.",1348272000,,311,4.545454545454546
8077218,4,B000AABL3A,"This DVD basically just adds an hour to the full 14-hour Engineering Disasters collection.  As such, it's not as good of a value from a cost standpoint.

And as noted by another reviewer, they cram quite a few case studies into this hour, so the coverage of each case lacks some depth.

Despite that, the quality of the DVD is still good overall, so I think this is well worth getting if you have an interest in engineering disasters.",1335830400,,434,4.468354430379747

As a documentary, it is ""fair"" quality, and an interesting compilation.
CONs
It was not clear that it would only play in US-players. Taken to Europe, it would not play because of the zone difference. This was not obvious by the details prior to purchase.",1321574400,,259,4.6521739130434785
8077220,2,B000AABL3A,"This video is a real disappointment.  It covers at least twelve different engineering disasters in 50 minutes, and, as you might expect, gives each of them almost no depth.  The video itself is riddled with errors, such as the allegation that the MV Stockholm was a ""cargo"" ship, and showing at least eight different submarines (one of them a TRIDENT) as the Thresher.  The St. Francis dam disaster, which was the one I really wanted to see, is little more than ""the dam broke.""",1270252800,12,478,4.666666666666667
8077221,4,B000AABL3A,"This is an EXCELLENT series, but subtitles of my copy of ""More Engineering Disasters"" read ""unavailable,"" and I can't find captions either. This is a major shame because the series is so good, and the captions in other episodes are exceptionally good.

""More Engineering Disasters"" is a must-see, in my opinion. I found the mistakes, and the reasons for some of them, fascinating. For instance, the Andrea Doria sinking, which may have been prevented by a simple light bulb, and the use of the Chauchat in World War II.

I can't wait to see more ""Modern Marvels!""

edit: A&E's website says this episode is NOT CC; I've already submitted the correction to Amazon.",1219017600,9,662,4.84070796460177
