8476173,4,B005JZBPCI,"A collection of 10 movies on 2 DVDs. I'll be honest, some titles I've heard of many I hadn't but the quality is good although if you're needing it, and we did for my wife's father, there is NO closed captioning on any of these films. I guess that's the cost of an inexpensive movie collection!",1384992000,,293,4.25
8476174,4,B005JZBPCI,"I've bought value packs before, because I figure if I get 2 movies I like out of the pack, it was a value for $5.  Truthfully I found merit in each one.  Some were very good.  The rest were ok.  There wasn't a ""bad"" movie in the batch.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.",1378944000,,276,3.9454545454545453

8476176,5,B005JZBPCI,"... about an hour ago. Naturally it has not yet arrived. Under these circumstances, I can not comment on the quality of this DVD collection. I can comment on the fact that I have seen a couple of them when they were televised, and I enjoyed them enough to purchase this collection. I can also comment on the fact that Amazon does not provide sufficient information as to the contents of this DVD collection, so I took the liberty of posting this list. I hope it may be useful to others.

P.S. The DVD has now arrived and I've viewed three of the movies and spot checked the rest of them. This is a two disk set with five movies on each disk. That is a lot of information crammed onto each disk and frankly, I wasn't expecting much in the way of quality. However, I was delightfully surprise. The quality was quite nice, and far exceeded my expectations.",1336521600,25,2660,4.725108225108225
8476177,3,B005JZBPCI,"This is a weird set. I wonder if it's legitimate, as the films are given a 'public domain' release treatment, even though most are fairly new and must be copyrighted. 10 films, mostly from Miramax. They are on two disks. At five films per disk, you can imagine that the quality is pretty poor. The films are pixilated and are only worth watching on a smaller screen. Still, I picked it up for $5 and watched while I was on a sick day and it was fine for that. Not a bad selection: ""The Station Agent"" with Peter Dinklage, ""Comedian"" with Jerry Seinfeld and the late Greg Giraldo. ""Get Bruce"" is a fun documentary about comedy writer Bruce Vilanch. All in all, okay viewing copies. Just don't spend much more than $5. Bare bones DVD's with NO extras.",1334534400,13,749,4.434782608695652
