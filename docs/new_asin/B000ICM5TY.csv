8145119,2,B000ICM5TY,"More like In Ya Face records exposed. This ""film"" is as much about them as it is about Vida Guerra. You can find better crap on the Internet for free on Guerra rather than spending any money on this. It isn't worth it.",1189987200,4,218,4.093023255813954
8145120,2,B000ICM5TY,"First I want to say I'm a huge Vida fan ever since her first appearance in FHM. With that said, this DVD
doesn't delliver the goods, especially for a title called ""Vida Guerra: Exposed"". I would have called it ""A Little Bit of Vida Guerra, Tons of Her Friends: Censored"". That is the perfect title for this DVD. First, there is NO NUDITY. The feature, which is barely an hour, features Vida at some photo shoots, a car show, a party and info on her singing career. For most of the DVD, Vida appears in either a bikini top with pants, or dresses...not exactly any type of clothing that causes exposure. During one part of the DVD, Vida is at a bikini photo shoot and we do get to see some of her, but this scene is VERY short and dissapointing, thanks to the fact that the camera rarely goes in for any close-ups. There are a few booty shots and one frontal (with the camera in motion). It seems like Vida wanted to make sure this DVD didn't get to ""hot"" or ""revealing"", since she's starting a music career and needs to protect her image, by moving away from the sex symbol and toward being an artist...yeah, it sucks. You will see more of Vida's friends than Vida in this DVD, which is disappointing. One model, an Asian hottie, steals the show as she wears the most revealing bikinis out of anyone else here. I don't know her name, it's never revealed, but I saw her on episodes of ""Street Fury"" on G4. In the extras, there is a clip of her walking out of the dressing room wearing a micro red bikini with bottoms so small, that she needs to be completely shaven to wear them - extremely HOT. Unfortunately, Vida NEVER wore anything this revealing on the DVD.
One frustrating part of the DVD was where Vida goes to a car show and then the DVD focuses on the cars at the show! I'm sorry, but I didn't buy this DVD to look at dozens and dozens of cars at an auto show. This part was pointless and was clearly filler for a feature that's barely an hour in length to begin with!
Then, there's a part of the DVD where Vida's singing career is discussed. Even though this was interesting, and Vida does have talent as a singer, this didn't seem to be the type of content that should be included on a DVD titled ""Exposed"". Really the only exposing moment on this DVD involving Vida takes place at a photo shoot when Vida is walking off the set, and she lifts her dress so that she doesn't trip over it thus, revealing her panties in the process. Now, I'm not expecting an entire DVD filled with moments like that, but an entire DVD of sexy Vida footage would've been nice.
Unfortunately, you're gonna see more of Vida in her Playboy issue and any of her FHM issues than you will on this DVD. I would only recommend this DVD to anyone who has only seen Vida in magazines and wants to see her on a video and hear her voice, but don't expect any sexy footage or anything that ""exposes"" Vida. If you want a sexy DVD where you get to see every inch of gorgeous models, I highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CandyGirl-Video-Sweet-Satisfaction-Jasmine-Grey-Special-Edition-Includes-Mini-Jasmine-Grey-Pin-Up/dp/B0018SO39M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CandyGirl Video: Sweet Satisfaction Jasmine Grey Special Edition (Includes Mini Jasmine Grey Pin-Up)</a>(contains explicit nudity), but don't look for any explicit or exposed nudes here!",1170374400,38,3377,4.706081081081081
8145121,5,B000ICM5TY,"I'll be honest.  This is no academy award winning film here.  But it IS a pretty entertaining peek into Vida's life... and a pretty hot peek at Vida's body! (again, what would you expect?).

If you're looking to sit back for an hour and chill with Vida, this DVD is the best way to do it.

p.s. there are a lot of other hotties in it as well.",1165363200,8,342,3.985294117647059
