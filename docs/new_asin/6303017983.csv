537076,4,6303017983,"It's a movie that is cheesy in all the fun ways. The acting is pretty solid with quite a few actors you will recognize. The story line is basic high school aged drama, if you weren't young when this movie came out you'd probably hate it but it's just one of those movies I considered a guilty pleasure when I was younger. To me it beats modern movies of it's type. If they made this movie today it would have to be extreme X Games and underground fight clubs.",1464480000,,459,4.168539325842697

537188,5,6303017983,"One of my Facebook friends postings, yesterday about the old flat-iron building in Mt. Auburn, motivated me to look up the movie that was shot in Cincinnati in 1992 and 93, called Airborne.

I have a Roku1 plugged into the back of my TV, and I used it to rent Airborne (1993) from Amazon Instant Video.  So, last night, our whole family watched Airborne in the family room for the first time.  I was totally eating up this movie.  I could recognize almost every location scene and I had difficulty following the story because I was totally eating up the familiar location shots.  Watching Airborne was like celebrating my dating years from 1991-1994.  The night time scenes on the Covington Landing barge, old Newport restaurants near Pompilios, and the Western Hills and Prospect Hill scenes, along with shots around Longworth Hall, near UPS.  I loved the shots in Mt Auburn, Mt Adams, Eden Park, and the Flower Conservatory.

I was dazzled with the familiar sights and my kids enjoyed seeing me get excited about it.  The redheaded teenage cousin, Wiley, reminded me of house hunting for my first home in Covedale and Westwood in 1994  walking through beautiful charming old small homes that had at least one bedroom totally tricked-out, in decorum, by a young teenage sloth.  My first house on Veazey, Ave, between Ferguson and Boudinot, was just a couple blocks away from Western Hills High.

Watching this movie is like celebrating my courtship years in downtown Cincinnati, Covington, and Newport.  Im not qualified to judge this movie at face value because I was totally dazzled and engrossed with all the familiar sights and places that I have grown to love these last 30 years.

The film critics were wrong when they said there is no real Devils Backbone.  There is a Devils Backbone that runs off of Ebenezer Rd., on the West Side, near Rapid Run.  Devils Backbone is close to the large house that Pete Rose used to live in and the road does have some challenging grades and turns. Im thankful to one of my Facebook friends, from my Mt. Auburn years, for helping me discover Airborne for the first time.",1453766400,12,2113,4.747945205479452

537255,5,6303017983,"I'm almost saddened to say that this film is finally on dvd. One of the unique appeals of this film was that it was NOT easily found on VHS in the 90's, nor did it see a dvd release until it was well past over-due. Instead, this film would appear sporadically on TBS in the later 90's and early millennium, which is, I assume, how most people familiar with the film became acquainted with Airborne. I consider the tv time that TBS filled with Airborne to be a smart move, because this is one of those films that, when it did come on, would keep me glued to my set in anticipation of the climactic roller blading scene. Possessing this film is like finally catching my White Pony, or finally finding something I only saw in a dream.

The plot of the film is a fish-out-of-water story about Mitchell Goosen (Shane McDermott) as your iconic early 90's California teenager. Let's not forget that back in the late 80's and early 90's, kids loved the California surf-and-skate culture. When Mitchell's parents go to Australia for a lengthy work-related project, Mitchell is shipped to live with his cousin (played by Seth Green) in icy Cincinnati. Mitchell endures typical problems, such as fitting in at school, problems with bullies (one of which is Jack Black), dating the school hockey captain's sister, etc. It's a familiar storyline, but in this film it manages to work due to the caliber of the actors as well as the dynamite cinematography, which does a fantastic job of showing Cincinnati.

Where this film really shines is the stunts though. Roughly midway through the film, Mitchell, frustrated at not being able to surf, has his roller blades shipped to him. The ensuing scene where Mitchell starts doing amazing half-pipe tricks and then jumping from stair landing to stair landing on an enormous outside staircase is breathtakingly wild, and the accompanying Joe Satriani-inspired guitar riffs are perfect. You see a scene like this and your instantly and nostalgically transported back to the early 90's. But this is just a taste.

The climactic scene is akin to Grease; instead of the Greasers racing the Socs, it is Mitchell's friends racing the prep school kids in an extremely dangerous team rollerblading race through a part of Cincinnati known as ""Devil's Backbone"", which starts off as a long winding downhill road and then dumps out into downtown Cincinnati traffic, highway overpasses, and even Riverside Baseball Stadium (where the Reds used to play baseball). The scene itself is probably about 12 minutes long or so, and there is virtually no speaking, but it adds to the experience as you hear roller blades pounding on asphalt. Even the music is significantly toned-down in this scene to really immerse the audience in the dangerousness of the roller blading stunts. The sound effects during this scene are amazing, the cinematography that captures the stunts is top-notch stuff, and all the credit in the world to the LA Skate Team for their ambitious and fantastic stunts in downtown Cincinnati.

People might dislike this movie based on the simple plot or a number of other elements, but you would be hard-pressed to find somebody that was unimpressed by the Devil's Backbone. I've watched a lot of tv and films over the years, and I still have not seen anything that is beautiful and as amazing as the downtown Cincinnati rollerblade stunts.",1433548800,2,3368,4.8828671328671325

537360,4,6303017983,Cute and cheesy 90's movie.  The movie has a young Jack Black and a teenage Seth Green.  The movie circles around a teen who goes to live with his cousin (Green) and how he adjusts to a new school and new environment.  It's vastly different from the sunny California lifestyle he is used to.  Rollerblading is amongst his favorite hobbies and is how he eventually is accepted into his new environment.,1422489600,,401,4.605633802816901

This movie won't win an Oscar (not that that means anything ) it's a typical high school/teen movie full of your cookie cutter bullies, rich vs. poor etc...  However, I found the movie quite charming, the acting wasn't bad, the music was pretty good - for me what really made the movie was the race at the end, it goes on for a long time, but never gets dull-it's one heck of a race (if you inline skate you'll love it).  I found it to be a really fun movie, now that I see it is finally in stock on Amazon I'm ordering it (almost 20 years after I first saw it).

Of course Seth Green really shines as the dorky side kick cousin Wiley and we get the privilege of enjoying the talents of a very young Jack Black, but Airborne has more. Airborne has Shane McDermott in the lead as the ultra cool, smooth voiced Mitchell Goosen. The cast is perfect, and the writing is good.

538081,2,6303017983,"This IS NOT a five star movie! By any standard. 5 star movies are films like The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Psycho, etc. This is not in that family of films.

This is a classic 1980's fluff piece. The premise, characters, and plot devices are all formulaic; the acting is sub-par and the visuals are simple and uninspired. The humor is so sparse, poorly integrated, and ridiculous that it's hard to know if it's genuine or tongue in cheek (for example, why, after a moment of heroism, does Jack Black suffer a crotch blow on a tree, Benny Hill style?)

This movie is, however, fun and it is far from unwatchable (i.e. I have seen worse) so I'm giving it a generous two stars as opposed to one: there is nothing to gain from watching this movie, but it's also not going to cause mental anguish.

In one word, this film is ""bland"" and is only worth watching for Seth Green's regrettable hair (he looks like a straight ironed troll doll).",1370649600,,933,4.476470588235294

538083,5,6303017983,"Having only seen this movie on VHS full screen pan and scan, I have to say seeing this DVD in the original widescreen aspect ratio with DVD quality audio is like seeing it for the first time.  The video and audio quality is great.

The DVD is from the Warner Bros Archive Collection which are all ""DVD-Made to Order"" which means they make the discs in small batches on DVD-R media to reduce cost and overstock.  I've heard the media they use is Verbatim MKM. The DVD comes in a standard case with full paper insert and the DVD itself has a similar design as the case insert. The only extra on disc is the original trailer.  Unfortunately there are no close captions/subtitles so you will have to decipher the 90's surfer lingo on your own.

The one bad thing I have heard about these DVD's is that they use a CSS (Content Scramble System) type protection and some older PC drives won't recognize them.  I will say that I have a Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop with the stock DVD combo drive (Toshiba Samsung TS-L633C SATA DVD Dual Burner) made in September 2010 that plays it fine (Win 7 x64 Home Prem. Ed.).  It also plays on a Sony Blu-Ray BPD-S580 player as expected.",1369353600,3,1164,4.411214953271028

538334,5,6303017983,"I just want to start off by saying that I felt compelled to write a review about this movie after reading about why some guy thought this movie was ""awful, lacked substance, and was not creative.""  This person, who I can only imagine plays dungeons and dragons and has a collection of beanie babies goes on to say, ""There are plenty of movies of this sort that are filled to the brim with creativity. The Harry Potter series is a case-in-point.""  Really....you are comparing this movie with Harry Potter??  I would like to know what planet this guy is from considering the two movies are nothing alike; not to mention that fact that they were written in two very different decades.

First off let me say this movie is awesome if you were around in the 90s, which apparently this guy was not!  No wonder you don't think this movie is any good....you watch movies like Harry Potter dude.

I grew up watching this movie.  It's funny, entertaining, and great to see guys like Seth Green and Jack Black before they were ""somebodies"".  Of course it doesn't have the greatest plot in the world.  It was written for teenagers in the nineties.  It was totally exciting to watch growing up and brings back great memories today.  Even if you didn't watch this growing up, let your kids watch it.  They will love it.  I personally love it because it reminds me of the days when I used to race around on my rollerblades, hang out on the beaches of California, and engage in good old competition.  I have been checking on Amazon for the last year to see when, or if, this movie would ever make it to DVD.  It finally has!!!  I would pay $30 for this movie if I had to.

If you want to be reminded of simpler, better days (which we will probably never see again) with good entertainment value, watch Airborne.  If all you care about are special affects, casting spells, and nerdy kids flying around on broomsticks, go watch Harry Potter and leave the good stuff for those of us who are nostalgic and like entertainment.",1283212800,18,2004,4.488950276243094
538335,5,6303017983,"When I talk about this film with people who are completely oblivious to its existence may be hard for some to believe considering this film delivers quite superior entertainment with a subtlety spiritual and adrenaline inducing value. This is a valuable gem to have in one's collection and I am happy this has finally entered the dvd format because it has been long over due.

  In 1993, the birth of inline-skating just took off full throttle and was quickly adapting to fit the needs of your typical adrenaline junkie. The film Airborne was able to take advantage of this new popular action sport and turn it into a highly successful and entertaining film.

  Mitchell (Shane McDermott) is your stereotypical Californian; he is mellow, poetic, deep, pretty and extremely tolerant. After catching hours of intense waves, his parents deliver the awful news that he is to stay with his cousins in Cincinnati, Ohio because of the grant they received to explore wildlife animals (Go, figure). It is from this moment, we observe Mitchell struggle to assimilate into his new habitat. Ohio proves to be a difficult environment to adapt to as the extended cold winter months, the excessive snow, the childish behavior of the alpha male students, and his socially awkward cousin Waley (Seth Green) render the adjustment quite difficult indeed.  However, Mitchell is a charmer; he is a real lady killer and a true gentleman in the sense that he can effortlessly attract any woman at Cincinnati High, even Jack's sister, Nikki (Britney Powell). Mitchell's character is incessantly pushed to it's limits when the Alpha male hockey players, more notably, Jack (Chris Conrad) attempt to make his life a living hell at school by mocking his attitude and behavior in speech class or by pulling childish stunts such as putting sand in his locker or disassembling an entire desk for him to fall out of. (It goes to ridiculous lengths with these Ohio students)

Mitchell falls prey to their game, but does not participate in it for he knows he is much smarter and much too cool to demote his signature Californian character to the callow and childish Alpha male status. His acceptance into this group of Jocks may come off as quite sudden but is all the more appropriate and justified when he ""pants's"" one of the opposing hockey team players in a street hockey match.

It is after this event where Mitchell is broached by the same hockey jock's that initially gave him a rough time in school with an opportunity to really prove himself:
TO RACE DOWN DEVILS BACK BONE

Yes, this film boils down to possibly one of the most exciting, dangerous and entertaining rollerblade races in cinema history. Similar to the Jock's bullying and teasing of our beloved protagonist, this race goes to ridiculous lengths as well. If anyone were really to attempt a race like this, I would say you have a 95% chance of dying and a 5 % chance of dying twice. These guys are dangerous and utterly insane, but when you are 17 years of age in high school, the concept of acceptance transcends far beyond any young man's rational thought, and ultimately, acceptance becomes worth any price tag, even death.

I describe this movie very simply, and it is a "" a feel good movie""; moreover, it's conveniently timed, (85 minutes) the characters are likable (well,most of them), the plot is cheesy and appropriate, the ending is predictable but never falls short of its delivery, the sound fx are impressive, the soundtrack is consistent, and the friendships that follow are quite plausible. I highly recommend this film to be adopted into one's film library because this film deserves to be more than a mere rental, but a permanent and valuable addition. Maybe I am exaggerating, maybe I am going to ridiculous lengths in describing how good this film is, but as Mitchell describes his philosophical and poetic dream to Waley, ""I am what I am.""

I also totally loved the soundtrack which featured a great song by Jeremy Jordan called ""My Love Is Good Enough"".  What first struck me about this film, back when I watched it as a kid, was that it starred Shane McDermot from ""Swan's Crossing"" which was a teen soap I was totally addicted to. (It also starred Sarah Michelle Geller.)  Seth Green is, of course, in this film with other stars like Jack Black, Edie McClurg, Chris Conrad, and the gorgeous Britney Powell and sexy Alanna Ubach (Legally Blonde, Freeway). This film, for me, is one of those timeless classics.  What the Breakfast Club was to the 80's, so is Airborne to the 90's.  This film is a great teen classic of the 90's right along with other 90's teen classics like Clueless, and Buffy The Vampire Slayer (the original film with Kristy Swanson and Luke Perry).

Mitchell Goosen (Shane McDermot) is a typical California surfer living life in the sun and on the beach.  The biggest part of his day is spent looking for the next great wave to surf.  Circumstance intervenes in his life, Mitchell finds himself living a true teen nightmare when his parents ship him to Cincinati to stay with relatives while they embark on a big career expedition.  Mitchell rooms with his quirky and off beat cousin Wiley (Seth Green).  While trying to fit in, Mitchell crosses paths with Jack (Chris Conrad), the token ""tough"" guy.  Much to Mitchell's surprise he meets and falls for an innocent and sweet girl named Niki (Britney Powell), only to later learn she is Jack's sister.  Now, Mitchell has to decide whether to chose the girl and risk getting his butt kicked severely by Jack or to lay low until he can return to California.

This movie is fun, light-hearted, and serious all at once.  I defy anyone to watch this film and not be left feeling great afterwards.  If nothing else but for the nostalgia alone, you should get this movie on dvd.",1277337600,,2011,4.625352112676056

Sure the dialogue is a bit campy and dated, the whole cool of it is gone, but this is a movie driven on pure nostalgia. Come to think of it, this might be a movie for a certain crowd: those born prior to 1990.

Mitchell Goosen (Shane McDermott) is a California skater and surfer, who spends most of his times eating burritos or chasing waves. When his parents are offered an opportunity to study in Australia, Mitchell finds himself in Cincinnati, Ohio. Of course, this means: no waves. Instead, Mitchell discovers a whole new way of life.

With rising stars (Seth Green, Jack Black), ""Airborne"" is filled with a unique ensemble cast, that all work in the funny yet awkward scenarios. Shane McDermott is a likable protagonist and while his story is quite surreal, anyone who's ever been to high school or a small town can relate.

The score by Stewart Copeland is phenomenal and works with some of the breathtaking visuals, specifically the ending which involves an all out race between skaters down, ""The Devils Backbone.""

Hopefully this is released on DVD as the videocassette is expensive for such a dated platform. Nevertheless, anyone with cable or HBO is bound to catch this rare film. To be honest, they really don't make movies like this anymore.

It is pure, clean fun centered around a California surfer being the new kid in a Cincinnati high school.  They surf, rollerblade, play hockey, earn their driver's licenses, and try to impress girls.  The plot is basic, but the movie moves relatively quickly and keeps you constantly interested in the cheesiness.

The movie is highlighted by many memorable characters including early roles from Jack Black and Seth Green.  Both actors have hysterical characters, with several one liners from Jack Black that are regularly quoted at my college.

Again, the movie is sheer entertainment, great for anyone that likes to have fun.",1127174400,3,797,4.731884057971015
538539,5,6303017983,"This movie gets high marks because it succeeds in exactly what it tries to be: a meaningless B-movie about a bunch of stupid teenagers living in an adolescent fantasy world where no one studies, works, or needs a car. It never tries to be anything more than that, and anyone who was disappointed that Airborne did not turn out to be The Godfather needs to take this movie for what it is: teenage junk - but very entertaining junk.

Man, this movie is stupid. It's the guilty pleasure of Saved by the Bell, but packaged in movie-form. Every character is cheesy, and nothing is believable but you can't help but watch because you want to see how much stupider it will get. It's great. I first saw this on cable while I was in college, living in the dorms, when almost my entire hall - by accident - tuned in during the climactic race down Devil's Backbone.  That year, it seemed like Airborne was always on cable, and like Saved by the bell, I always watched.

The main character, Mitchell, is such a prissy-boy loser, that only a prissy-boy loser would root for him. The teenage bad guys, who fifteen years later STILL look older than I do, are so fake-macho that you can't help but laugh and cheer them on at the same time. In the end, this turns out to be a bad version of the Karate Kid on roller blades.

How excited was I when one day, I found this movie in a video store. Now when people ask me if I've seen Airborne (and ask me they do), I can proudly say, ""See it? I OWN it!"" And let's not forget that this movie spawned the acting careers of the great Seth Green and Jack Black.

I only wait on pins and needles, for the DVD `special extended version,' with deleted scenes and cast commentary. Sadly, I feel this is a day that will never come...

538540,5,6303017983,"In-Line skating movies are a lot like Matthew Modine... box office death.  Remember 'Solarbabies' or 'Prayer of the Rollerboys'?  No, of course you don't.  Moreover, the strange thing is, on paper at least, 'Airborne' would have had producers running for the hills.  Virtually every mainstream Hollywood cliche is in this movie.  You have your garden variety 'fish out of water' lead character; the lovable clown-prince secondary character; a quasi-Romeo and Juliet love connection (without the death of course); and the 'big race' for the finale.  Taking all of that into account - this is a good movie.  I repeat, I would rather watch this than the bulk of summer fare that emerges every year.  But, why?

First, 'Airborne' was filmed AND actually took place in Cincinnati, OH (normally flicks with no big stars are made in Toronto and/or Vancouver).  Its a nice touch.

Second, the characters are genuinely likable.  Seth Green plays his role of the hapless and dateless cousin to perfection.  A very very young Jack Black is also excellent.

Lastly, Rollerbading isn't necessarily the core of this movie.  You could could enjoy it simply by skimming over the skating scenes, but not recommended.  The 'big race' at the end of the movie isn't like a hockey game one would expect - but a surprsingly exciting free-for-all downhill event.  In fact, the race at the end of the movie is nearly 25 minutes long, but it is filmed so well and with just the right amount of sound effects that it flows remarkably well.  This used to be a staple on TBS but has waned in airings as the years have progressed.  'Airborne' isn't even a cult film - so pick it up, you'll watch it AT LEAST 3 times - that's worth a few bucks, right?",1093392000,17,1721,4.714765100671141

Rollerbladers shreding down ""Devil's Backbone"", crazy pranks and the ocassional jack black thrown in there really makes for a funny movie.  I love the story about a sufer that ends up in Clevland, smack dab in the middle of a snow storm, booya!  Mitchell tries to fit in but the guys don't seem to buy it but the ladies sure do. Snake also has a 1.1 GPA.  Always a good time with the sufer dudes, but don't forget the po dunk ghetto kids and then the preps.  Hockey is the sport, Wylie's dad drives a zambonie.  Wrong goal surfer dude, BAP!, gets creamed and then some.  Sand in the locker, wet tp and some iching powder can't hurt the mahurushi. So Mitchell gets his blades and then tears up the city making friends as he goes along, then aaaawww, there is the love of his life, better show off, oops cracked my skull, lets go look at plants and flowers, you better know your stuff because its a test.  Ladi dodi, its time to depants some preps...hmmm.  Crazy sufer kids!!

538542,5,6303017983,"For all of you 'nay-sayers' I got two words for you: Moral Fiber.  Yes, you heard me correctly. That is what Airborne provides, my friends. You may think I am a mentally deficient human-being for enjoying this movie, but lend me your ears.  If you look at it from my perspective you will see a whole new world of Airborne.
Quite frankly this movie is one of the most allegorical movies I have ever seen.  This movie is so intellectually jampacked with references to the second World War, I nearly wet myself during the first showing.  For example, Micthell is the U.S., and those bullys are the Japanese. Seth Green's character is obviously the British, and I will take a venture to say that Jack Black's character is probably the French.
The bullys also represent the Germans. I spent myriad hours examining the movie, and I can't truly identify who Hitler is meant to be.  I watched to the whole movie in reverse and discovered in scene 36, where Mitchell's toliet paper is sabotaged (this represents the German invasion of France, duh!)that the bully's say 'Axis freedom, down with the Allies'.  If you play it in reverse you will see as well.
The roller hockey game where Mitchell pulls down the bully's pants clearly represents the Battle of Normandy, where the Allied troops stormed the beaches.  The race down Devils Backbone is obviously the final battle of WWII in which the underdogs won.
I have one minor quibble: the guy who won the race.  ...? By the way, the man who made the analogies with Jack Black and shining after a shower- you are right on my good sir.
I hope you see the movie in a different light with my guidance.",1077753600,2,1637,4.582191780821918
538543,1,6303017983,"I don't understand why this movie has received such good reviews.  Airborne is, by any standard, awful.  I won't give a plot synopsis because it has been done by several other reviewers.  So, onto the review:
Airborne contains nothing of substance; it's plot lacks cohesion.  The main character (Mitchell) doesn't believe in fighting for anything... but later admits that there are some things worth fighting for.  He learns this lesson after being picked on by ""Jack"" (they really should've picked a younger actor for the part... this man was 15 years too old for the part.)  He finally has enough, and pulls down Jack's pants during a roller hockey match.  How very noble of him.  He COULD HAVE learned this lesson by protecting someone he loves ... but I think the writers were just too lazy to write anything of substance.
Fairborn's ending is yet another display of poor screen writing.  Mitchell's crush is angry at him because he exclaimed that he was leaving Ohio in three months, and that ""no one there mattered.""  Mitchell wins a downhill race; the girl is all-smiles and kisses him.  Apparently, that made everything better.  Some call it romantic... I call it a lack of character development.
OK.  This movie is geared toward the preteen/early teen group ... so I wasn't expecting anything profound.  But that doesn't explain the complete lack of quality.  There are plenty of movie of this sort that are filled to the brim with creativity.  The Harry Potter series is a case-in-point.
Airborne is just a series of teeth-gnashing cliches, crudely stitched together.  The screen writing, much like this review (sorry--it's late and I'm tired), is an unstructured mess.  Don't waste your money on it.",1073088000,,1710,4.940350877192983

538545,5,6303017983,"Good: Well, I had to give this movie a 5 because anyone who likes Seth Green and Jack Black today, really need to see this movie. You'll see both of them in early greatness.
  It's good to see the supporting roles moving on to become way more well known than any of the stars in these older films. You'll see some supporting roles in this film for years to come, such as Seth's parents and the girl he tries to impress. You'll have to watch it to see who I'm talking about.
Bad: It IS a bit dated and for lack of a better word, cheezy, (hangs head low) but it's funny and nostalgic.

What caught my attention to this movie was it's appeal it could have to teens everywhere if it were shown more abroad.  This was the first movie I had seen Seth Green in (to my knowledge then; I had originally seen him in ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and didn't know it.) and he did the movie MUCH justice.  HIL-ARI-OUS!!!  One amazing thing about this movie is, it has a smittenly tiny dark tone to it.  Maybe it was just that the weather was always overcast in the film, but you can decide.  Make sure you check this one out.  It's jam packed full of the genres we all like to watch. Drama, action, comedy. romance, etc.  Plus, there is a really excellent race bringing in the movie's finale.  Oh, and just one more thing.

538547,5,6303017983,"I grew up in Cincinnati, so in the Fall of 1992, when I heard that a major motion picture was about to start filming near my neighborhood, I jumped at the opportunity to witness a talented filmmaker at work.

While parts of ""Rain Man"", ""Traffic"", and the underrated ""The Public Eye"" (Joe Pesci) were filmed in Cincinnati, ""Airborne"" was the first big-budget movie filmed entirely on location in the Queen City (aka Cincinnati, Ohio).

""Airborne"" tells the story of Mitchell (played by newcomer Shane McDermott), a California surfer boy, that is sent to Cincinnati to live with his aunt (the DELIGHTFUL Edie McClurg), uncle (the very funny Patrick Thomas O'Brien), and cousin (Seth Green from ""Austin Powers"").

Mitchell quickly realizes that he's not in California any more.  Ha!  Sounds like ""The Wizard of Oz"", doesn't it?  Well, the similarities stop there.

Mitchell was the ""cool guy"" in school back in California, but now that he's attending school in Cincinnati, he is teased for his radical clothes, his tubular hairstyle, and his surfer lingo.  When Mitchell hears about an opening on the roller hockey team, he sees this as an opportunity to win over his fellow classmates.  Using his surfer know-how, and his charming Californian ways, Mitchell quickly becomes the hero of the team, and begins to attract the attention of the team captain's girlfriend.  UH OH!

When the captain finds out about his girlfriend's extra curricular activities,  he challenges Mitchell and friends to a death-defying Roller blade race down ""Devil's Backbone"".  Mitchell agrees to the dangerous challenge - anxious to impress his new love, and settle the score once and for all with his arch nemesis.

""Airborne"" is an accurate portrayal of what life is really like in Cincinnati.  When I was in high school, many disputes were settled with a challenging Roller blade race (although, in my day, they were roller SKATES), or at the bowling alley.

Filled with exciting stunt sequences, witty dialogue, and a breakthrough performance by Seth Green, ""Airborne"" is sure to please the extreme sports (and Cincinnati) fan in all of us!",1035417600,,2118,5.060518731988473

 Take it for what it is, a simple, popcorn film that you can sit back and enjoy, maybe even laugh a little bit here and there. Director Rob Bowman (better known for X-Files) attempts to try to make an angle at a light-hearted teen flick that relates to teen angst, and peer pressure.
 Airborne, if anything should enlighten you about the goods and the bads of life in general and that you don't have to change to impress anyone but yourself. So sit back with a bowl of Cap'n Crunch berries, a bean burrito, an honor pop or two and you'll be a pretty happy camper, and you'll be stylin'.",1002153600,,754,4.378571428571429

Without the ocean near him (or any friends that share anything in common with his surfer mentality) our protagonist finds himself trying to fit in an otherwise cold and indifferent high school atomosphere.  Luckily he shares a common interest in rollerblading and uses it to try and win over his enemies and the midwestern beauty that he has fallen in love with.
