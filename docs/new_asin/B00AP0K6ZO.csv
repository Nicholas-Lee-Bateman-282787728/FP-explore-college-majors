8555547,5,B00AP0K6ZO,"These two young women got the spirit, and soul and terrific musicianship. Great to be able to watch them on this DVD
as they perform. It's obvious that the videos of many of the songs are snippets of different takes because bits of clothing
change during the course of a single song, but the performance is smooth and without any obvious splicing. My favorites:
""I'll Fly Away"" and ""Occupy.""",1417824000,,391,4.681159420289855
8555548,5,B00AP0K6ZO,"I found these sisters on u-tube by accident, (all good things are accidental on u-tube). I wanted the lyrics to ""Cumberland Gap"", and while this isn't the best source for that, because they are really brief with the lyrics, the music is AWESOME!  Check them out. I think they are reincarnated hippies from my days in the Haight, but better and definitely modern. I think they are strong beautiful women who love their music.
