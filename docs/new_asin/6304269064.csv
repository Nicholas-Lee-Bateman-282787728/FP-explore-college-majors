818038,4,6304269064,"It's a great story that is just off the mainstream radar screen.  Ed Burns is so cool, but could be any joe random on the street, despite being the only English-speaking cabbie in NY.  The dialouge is genuine and it's not  your typical love triangle.  It's really about what we want and realizing  that it's different for everyone.  John Mahoney is excellent in a  character-actor role.",957225600,3,386,4.757575757575758
818039,4,6304269064,"The script is sometimes funny because of the conflict between two brothers from different worlds.  They are ""in love"" with the wrong woman most of the time. Cameron Diaz is beautiful but sometimes you feel that she  flashes that smile to cover her lack of acting skills. Jennifer Aniston is  just the opposite: she is pretty but she concentrates her energy on her  acting. The picture has more drama than some seem to pick up on. This is  not just a funny film. It says alot about our family and social values  today. Burns does a good job on this and his acting and Aniston's make it  worthwhile to see.",952905600,14,604,4.4363636363636365
818040,5,6304269064,"I love going to the movies and watching videos.  I thought I had seen it all.  But, ""She's the One"" exposed me to a level of elation I've never experienced.  My friends and I watched it nearly four times.  It's  one of the best movies ever made.",943056000,,245,4.127659574468085
818041,2,6304269064,"Two relentlessly sarcastic brothers reach an unpleasant but revealing turning point in their relationship after the elder brother marries a woman he has known only a few hours. The younger brother, driven by greed and  competitiveness, neglects his own marriage for a one-upmanship involvement  with the elder brother's faithless ex-fiancee. Their father shows his  affection for them by impugning their masculinity. Their mother is never  home. The inlaws openly discuss everyone's sex life.",914371200,3,492,5.698630136986301
818195,2,6304269064,"Kind of a weird little flick.  Had some well known actors but the movie was just mediocre.  The title ""She's the One"" and the cover image would imply that one woman is so attractive that multiple people want her.  Strictly speaking, that is true but the character does not come across as attractive at all.  She comes across as a selfish gold digger.  The men in the movie are largely messed up guys that most women would not want to date.  The movie really failed to engage me.  In the end, I didn't care what happened to any of the characters.",1482883200,,545,4.336633663366337

818199,5,6304269064,On of my favorites! I love Francis (Michael McGlone)!  I love the scene when he boxes his brother Mickey (Edward Burns) and calls him a loser cabby.  The dad (John Mahoney) is great (and funny) in this movie as well.,1474329600,,216,4.375
818200,5,6304269064,Love This movie Maxine Bahms is the real star. Jenifer Aniston and Cameron Diaz are supporting actors. But the love between Edward Burns and Maxine makes the movie for me.,1473897600,2,171,4.733333333333333

I kept looking at the clock just waiting for it to end, and when it finally did I jumped off of the sofa in joy.  I can't believe I wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this rotten piece of cinema.  Ed Burns did a stale job of directing this movie.  The characters have no personality.  The interactions are excruciatingly dull.  Usually, I like Ed Burns.  I like Jennifer Aniston.  I like Cameron Diaz.  I like John Mahoney.

I also loved how it ended, and did not have a ""sunset"" Hollywood ending.  A great romantic comedy that seemed to be about real people.  This is not the more modern romantic comedy with strange characters that are hard to relate too and seem unreal.

Eddie is an Indie guy, but this Studio  version of his store does not take too many great bounds from the themes of ""The Brothers McMullen"".  It simply beefs up the cast and makes the characters and story more ""Hollywood"" (easier to understand off the bat).

The dialogue is at times witty, ribald, and/or sarcastic; the character development is superb; the humor is understated.

Edward Burns, who wrote and directed the movie, plays the role of the most likable world-wise brother, Mickey. Mike McGlone plays his brother, Francis.

John Mahoney plays the narrow-minded, family-dominating father, who has only a superficial understanding of the other family members. Typical of the father's unsolicited advice to his two grown sons is that whether or not one believes in God, he should respect the Church and be a good Catholic.

The two female leads are Cameron Diaz playing Heather, and Jennifer Aniston playing Rene. The excellent acting gives credibility to all of the characters.

Viewers who are expecting torrid love scenes, pie-in-the-face humor, or gratuitous violence will be disappointed.

He stars as Mickey, a man that has been lost since he caught his fiancee cheating on him and hasn't really moved on since the incident. Enter Hope, the girl he would meet as he was giving her a cab ride to the airport, and he would marry the same day, much to the dismay of his older brother. His older brother is a rich man working wall street, married to Jennifer Aniston, many things make him lucky, yet he competes with Mickey the entire movie. The father of the two irish boys has his own problems, like he doesnt allow women on his boat. The major problem between the two is the older more successful brother is cheating on his wife with Cameron Diaz, who turns out to be Mickey's old fiancee who cheated on him.

Not giving anything away, we realize all of this within the first little bit of the movie, but the brothers take awhile to put all the pieces together. The older brother realizes there are some things money cant buy, and that success doesnt necessarily come in the form of a larger paycheck.

Excellent movie, three beautiful women star in the movie, and are set to make an example of the brothers for their various indiscretions.

Great movie, definitly worth watching, also see the movie Beautiful Girls for the same idea of beautiful women teaching men what sometimes they may not be able to learn on their own.",1207958400,,1383,4.437007874015748

821494,3,6304269064,"This film has a good script and much to recommend it - but only if you can ignore the appalling clichd expressions and deliveries of its three trophy actors, Cameron Diaz (Heather), Jennifer Anniston (Renee) and, worst of all, Mike McGlone (Francis).

It's as though the aspiring writer/director/actor Eddie Burns (Mikey) is overawed by the above-mentioned trio having deigned to appear in his debut mainstream production. Despite clichd pauses, hand movements and contrived facial double takes, Eddie does give a credible performance as a reasonably convincing character who brings common sense to the story. Micky's father, played by John Mahoney, is an original and delightful character ably portrayed.

The one very pleasant surprise is Maxine Bahns (Hope), who skilfully plays the major role of Mickey's wife. Her name isn't even mentioned in the DVD's Selected Features despite Diaz and Anniston being referred to ad-nauseam. Perhaps  Bahns just hasn't grown up in the TV sitcom school of over-acting and double takes. By contrast, Bahns' emotional responses are understated but nevertheless beautifully and meaningfully implied. She's a subtle and quiet delight and makes the film worthwhile despite its otherwise so called ""star cast"". The script does have some clever moments but suffers from the overuse of bad language. As with Bahns' portrayal of Hope, less is often very much more.",1190678400,,1394,5.385321100917431

From a guys point of view, no, they are not attractive, and they act like typical dorks who don't know how to react towards their girlfriend, or how to react period.  They are just ""grown men who have trouble taking a hint"".

Anyway, storyline-wise it's what you'd expect- guys sleeping with women, and women sleeping with men, and then they talk about all the problems with relationships throughout the film.  It's just a romance drama that's intended for adults.  My problem with these kind of movies is how they like to make being involved in a relationship look like the worst thing a human being could do.

I would just love to have a conversation with those who rated this film highly (first question: How many romatic comedies have you seen?). If romantic comedies were in short supply, then maybe you could kill two hours just to get a RC fix. But they're not, are they?

""She's the One"" appears to be written by someone who just really really wanted to write a RC and drew together a bunch of elements that a film of this genre should have. But the end product is not all that funny, not at all satisfying, not particulary romantic, and the dramas the couples get into are not particularly believable.

Of special note is the relationship between the couple that got married a day after meeting each other. Of all the scenerios, this was the most potentially compelling, because we are all interested in how such a spontaneous lifetime commitment works out. You have a cab driver scoring a ""trophy"" wife (Maxine Bahns, who is arguably even better looking than Cameron Diaz) for no good reason that's ever revealed to the audience. Why is this fox hanging out with this beer drinking near-do-well? We never find out. All we know is that after dumping him a few weeks into the marriage, she changes her mind and takes him back at the end of the film, just because he told her co-worker to tell her that he missed her. Give me a break. Pretty, famous faces and a Tom Petty sound track don't redeem this film.

ps - If you want to see Edward Burns direct a well done New York based story of people with inter-locking lives, check out ""Sidewalks of New York"".",1174089600,2,1624,4.498305084745763
821618,1,6304269064,"This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen! I thought this would be really good because it stars Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston, both of whom I really like. I was wrong. This movie is worse than a really bad soap opera. Both of these actresses have appeared in some abysmal movies, but this one takes the cake. There is rock bottom, but in this case you have rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, and then 'She's the One'! The only way the movie could be worse would be if Pauly Shore was a co-star (that's my husband's opinion)!",1171670400,3,537,4.2745098039215685
821619,5,6304269064,"Review for Simply Irresistible

A good cook is like a sorceress who dispenses happiness."" ~Elsa Schiaparelli

Sarah Michelle Gellar's softer side appears as she picks up the batterie de cuisine and tackles saving a restaurant from certain death. When it looks like Amanda's career is about to end as a chef, an angel appears in her life and gives her some sage advice about looking for a door that will open when another one closes. As the chef of a failing 70 year-old restaurant, the Southern Cross, she only has her loyal clientele who are not there for the food.

To say she is adorable as a chef is an understatement. She appears in a variety of fashionable outfits and weaves a sweet innocent spell on the viewer. Worth watching to see Sarah dressed up in a variety of outfits and different hairstyles.

There are also scenes of outdoor markets, beautiful orchids and of course restaurant scenes, Sarah shopping, cooking and crawling about on the floor chasing after magical crabs all to romantic music.

Instead of slaying vampires, ""Buffy"" bewitches Tom Bartlett (Sean Patrick Flanery) and entices love right into her life through cooking a variety of gourmet dishes. If every man has his weakness, Tom's weakness is luscious cuisine.

""She can cook things that make you crazy."" ~Tom

As every kitchen sorceress has discovered, the right food can create the right mood and can invite happiness and love into your life. I loved the dance scene and the scene where Tom and Amanda disappear into the scented mist. This movie emphasizes the aphrodisiac qualities of food.

Amanda Shelton (Sarah) only discovers her true cooking talents after meeting Tom. At first she seems unaware of her current fate while Tom seems to be trying to control his fate. He is disturbed by his lack of emotional control and when he falls ""in love"" with Amanda, his world seems to be spinning out of control.

""My whole life was ordinary and then we met and these amazing things started to happen."" ~Amanda

Is it love that makes Amanda a better cook and makes her cooking taste even better to Tom? Are their senses in a state of heightened awareness from the chemicals rushing through their bodies or is there magic floating about? Once she finds a recipe for caramel eclairs, Tom is even more attracted to her.

There are very few movies about cooking or chefs so this one is a treat. Tear drops in the food reminded me of Like Water for Chocolate. The emotions Amanda feels are somehow magically mixed into the food she is cooking. Either the dishes make people cry, stun them or make them lose their inhibitions. She seems to have a magical gift for culinary creations that have an effect on anyone who consumes them.

After watching this movie you may want to feed your lover oranges, invest in some expensive vanilla extract, get lost in a kiss or cook up some bliss. If you are looking for the best vanilla for your cooking, Bourbon-Madagascar vanilla is superior.

Deliciously cute, silly spells, sweet innocent love and a few hot and steamy kissing scenes in the kitchen. For romantics and lovers of kitchens and cuisine. Almost a culinary Cinderella story.

821620,3,6304269064,"I am not sure why Jennifer Annistan got top billing over her much better female conterparts (Cameron Diaz and Maxine Bahns).  This was a very different movie about two brothers and their father who they like to go fishing with.  One brother (Francis) seems to have it all (a successful Wall Street career with Jennifer Anniston as a wife) while the other brother (Mickey)lives in a dump of an apartment with no tv (his ex-girlfriend Cameron Diaz didn't give it back to him when she ended their relationship by cheating on him) and drives a New York cab for a living.  Francis doesn't seem to be satisfied and is constantly jealous of his poorer brother because his brother is the happier of the two.  He is also carrying on affair with Heather (Cameron Diaz, who he doesn't realize was Mickey's ex).

One day Mickey picks up Hope (Michelle Bahns) in his taxi, who is late to catch a flight to Tennessee or some state closeby.  There is a mutual attraction between the two right away and Hope is afraid to just let Mickey drive her to the airport so instead offers that he drive her all the way to her southern destination.  The two end up getting married on the trip.

When Mickey and Hope get back, Hope's friend reminds her that she is supposed to move to Paris and did she mention that to Mickey before getting married?  Hope says that she is waiting for the right time to let him know.

Things get dicey as Mickey meets up with Heather one more time.  She thinks it is to re-kindle what they had.  His only purpose is to get his tv back.

After Mickey get his tv his brother starts to figure out that Heather was in fact Mickey's ex-girlfriend and this makes him boil.

The story then has to resolve all the strained relationships if they can be.  The story seems to break down some towards the end and that is why I did not rate it higher.  Also, I was not sure if this was supposed to be a romance, a comedy or something else.",1165795200,3,1932,4.354748603351955

Its funny, thought provoking, and shows how a family really works, with all the pimples and grime.  This is the second movie in the series (with the Bro. McMullen being the first) and I found this to be just as entertaining and a nice segue from the previous movie.  In fact, 'She's the One' seems slightly more upbeat, more colorful, and in a way, jumps out at you more than 'The Bros.' did.  Fantastic acting too.  The ladies were good, but the main characters, Ed Burns and Mike McGlone were multi-dimentional, yet subtle at the same time.  The father was perfect for the role.  If you like real stories and like to have a grin on your face every 10 minutes, you will enjoy this film.

821721,4,6304269064,"Francis (Mike McGlone) and Mickey (Edward Burns) are brothers with different views on life and happiness. These views have been heavily influenced by their father (John Mahoney) through the years, with his, ""you come first"" attitude.
Mr. Fitzpatrick lives near the ocean and owns a boat, wherein the father and brothers visit and go fishing often.
Mickey is an down to earth and likable guy without much ambition who drives a cab. Brother Francis is not so likable. He is a successful stockbroker whose standing joke is that his brother is the only English speaking cab driver in New York.
Francis is pretentious and conniving, the opposite of Mickey, who is easy going and modest. That they were raised by the same parents seems to be a fluke.
Francis also is a cheating husband. He is married to and bored with Renee (Jennifer Aniston), who cannot figure out why Francis never wants to have sex anymore. Francis, nice guy that he is does not want to cheat on his mistress with his wife.
However, the same can't be said for his mistress, Heather (Cameron Diaz) who doesn't even try to hide the fact from Francis that she is sleeping around. The naughty Heather, for the record, was once engaged to Mickey, until he caught her naked asleep with another man in their apartment.
Meanwhile our happy go lucky cab driver, Mickey, surprises everyone when he marries one of his fares, a mere twentyfour hours after meeting her. Her name is Hope (Maxine Bahns) and Mickey and Hope have every intention of making their marriage work, despite what everyone, especially Francis thinks.

But definitely, she faired much better in the other film.  I agree with one reviewer, Cameron flashed her smile quite often in this film...maybe not because she really lacked the necessary acting skills...but maybe more of being a novice in the field & still did not know what was exactly expected of her.  (But look at her now!)  She was also more chubby back then but cuter.  Jennifer Aniston looked the same, acted the same (e.g. Friends stints)but just as foxy & sophisticated.
As for the plot itself, it was sensible.  It focused on relationships --- between brothers, between father & sons, between married couples & between ex-es.  I guess the moral fiber was there & the conversations were the backbone of the movie.  Maybe the reason why other viewers felt this movie was a bit dragging is because they expected a lot of senseless twists - whether it be funny, sexual or what have you.

Cameron Diaz is delightfully evil as his ex-fiancee, certainly a much different role than the loveable girl next door roles she played in ""My Best Friends Wedding"" and ""There's Something About Mary"" Although she has only a small role Jennifer Anniston is also great as Renee, a wife who looks for a reason as to why her husband is no longer interested in her.

Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

Anyone out there remember Ed Burns films? Well, to protect his feelings, Im sure lots of you out there raised your hands.

Ed Burns was the Irish Catholic Woody Allen of the 90s, and while he still makes movies, hes not in his heyday anymore. Shes The One was his best film, in my opinion, and if you rent it, youll get to see the young, promising actresses Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston, as well as Frasiers dad without his cane! (I told you this was a 90s flick)

An Irish Catholic family with a gruff father, a particularly religious mother, and two competitive sons is thrown for a loop when both sons fall in love with the same woman. Shes the one! The plot moves fast and has lots of twists along the way, and the 90s banter is priceless.

I have a soft spot in my heart for this film, but I will admit its a tad dated, so it would be best to put on your 90s goggles when watching it.",1497225600,,949,4.113513513513514
