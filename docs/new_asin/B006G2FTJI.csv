4985688,3,B006G2FTJI,"I really didn't learn much from this documentary, other than getting to see images of some of the areas where Turing did his work.  I read the Andrew Hodges book a few years ago and remember it as being excellent.  Once you've read the Hodges book, I'd recommend Neal Stephenson's ""Cryptonomicon"" where you get a fictional account of meeting Turing that evokes much of the nerdy satisfaction that a student of Turing seeks.",1374969600,,423,4.780821917808219

I Have enjoy reading books and watching movies about a man who is undoubtedly one of the greatest minds of the 20th century, but this was not worth my time. . This video was more about his life style choices than the mans work. His choices in love are not my concern, but it was the main concern of the producers of this tripe. What a waste of time about a great man.",1421712000,8,490,4.212765957446808

4985726,2,B006G2FTJI,"I got only halfway into the film but it appeared to me to be more focused on homosexuality than on the accomplishments of a key person in history, how he affected history, help to create cryptography, and clarified Babbage's work.  I might give it a second try but I doubt it.",1406073600,5,276,4.411764705882353

4985728,5,B006G2FTJI,"When I first found out that Alan Turing was the actual father of modern computing, I was puzzled as to why he wasn't more widely recognized and celebrated for his achievements.

Then I found out he was gay.

That in a nutshell explained why his legacy was buried. The Brits, in their liberal, anything goes society, buried one of the greatest scientific minds in history all because of his personal choices and habits. It's rather humorous and also sad that Turing's life was flushed down the tubes and now decades later, Sir Elton John is considered one of the ""greatest Brits to ever live."" I guess it is all about when you live in time.

But I found this video to be revealing and insightful on the scientific level as well as the homosexual level. The people featured in the video showed a keen understanding of the situation Turing faced, and focused on it without yielding to the ""angry gay"" rhetoric of times gone by.

Certain segments of society are more accepting and understanding of the gay life. Progress will be made as time goes by. And we all owe Alan Turing an incredible debt of gratitude for his achievements. We should all work to tell his story to the world, and try to bridge the divide between gay and straight. Let this video help you understand the perspective from both sides, until there is no more divide.

(PS: I struggle with descriptive words for the ""non-straight lifestyle."" So many words like ""homosexual"" and ""gay"" sound so pejorative and of course the viscous slang terms are totally unacceptable. Even the terms the mainstream media uses, ""alternative lifestyle"" or ""same-sex relationship"" and such seem to categorize people unnecessarily. People's lives and choices are just that, their lives. Just let people live the way they want, and quit trying to categorize them.",1390003200,,1806,4.812903225806451
4985729,4,B006G2FTJI,"Insightful, but short bio doc on Alan Turing. Would have liked more content, and more anecdotal recollections of Turing, his work, and his legacy.",1389225600,2,146,5.125
4985730,5,B006G2FTJI,"If you don't know who Alan Turing was, please take the time for an introduction! He is one of the 'masters' of computer science and the Turing Machine is considered a model of the general purpose computer we take for granted. This short video offers a quick overview of Alan Turing's adult life that includes his involvement  with code breaking and the creation of the computers used at Bletchley Park. An introduction to the Enigma machines used by the Germans during WWII and his approach to solving the problem. Recommended? Yes, especially for those who are not familiar with his contributions to computer science. The information includes his private life and eventual *suicide. Unfortunately,there is too much information that is not included in this overview. Definitely worth the time!

*An interesting footnote:  Scholars disagree about whether it was suicide or an accident. Turing had a laboratory in his home. Cyanide was used and Turing was not meticulous about  washing his hands after using chemicals. There was no suicide note so did he accidentally eat an apple that was contaminated with cyanide?",1387843200,7,1114,5.138121546961326
4985731,2,B006G2FTJI,Was this a college project?  Felt like it.  Nothing much there really.  They talked to 4 people; 2 tour guides and 2 other people.  There was more about him being gay than about the man and what he did.  I know a bit about him and I found this to be pretty disappointing.  I'd look elsewhere.,1381449600,8,292,4.125
4985732,4,B006G2FTJI,"This short documentary about Alan Turning was very informative. It brought out many aspects about the man most know for decoding Enigma...the impossible code to all, but very possible to Mr. Turing. However, rather than focusing on this accomplishment, don't expect this film to concentrate on it...it's more about the man, not the Enigma. It was about ""Who"" Alan Turing was. He became a hero to many due to his accomplishments, as well as an icon to many because he was an openly gay man serving in the well-known 'Hut #8', (Intelligence decoders) in Britain during WWII.
This short, insightful film links Alan Turning's accomplishments to modern day computer technology, and even to Mr. Steve Jobs! Why is the apple the logo and name...where did it really come from?",1379721600,5,768,4.961240310077519
