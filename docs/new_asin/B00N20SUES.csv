8675761,2,B00N20SUES,"I love ""Love Live!"" so much and wanted to support it by buying the Bluray but I was extremely disappointed by this purchase. Mainly, it's the English subtitles. The subtitles were poorly translated, overly complicated, and misinterprets the characters. I originally watched the show online and it had perfect subtitles. ""Love Live"" has a very specific tone that's light and heartwarming and I didn't get that with these subs.

I understand this is a personal preference and it might seem like I'm exaggerating, but it really ruined my experience! I had to return it. If you feel as strongly about subbing, If you prefer dubs, go for it. But if you prefer subtitles, I suggest you buy the Bluray from Japan or stick to watching online.",1494720000,7,734,4.825396825396825
