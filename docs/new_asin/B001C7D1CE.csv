8286213,5,B001C7D1CE,"I fell in love with this series in it's third or fourth incarnation dubbed in Spanish. As I wanted to improve my German, I bought the first DVD of the series, then the 2nd, 3rd and 4th. Moser (Tobias Moretti) is my favorite inspector, but Brandtner is not a bad replacement. This is the season in which Moser is killed and Brandtner comes in. Rex is the same  incredible dog.",1387756800,,375,4.357142857142857
