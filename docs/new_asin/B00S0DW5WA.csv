6938254,3,B00S0DW5WA,Not groundbreaking by any means but I did not regret the 80+ minutes I spent with it. If you enjoyed movies like ATM or Phone Booth then give it a try.,1430265600,2,151,3.903225806451613
6938255,1,B00S0DW5WA,"Probably the nicest thing I can write about Roadside is that its mercifully short, clocking it at just over 80 minutes, about a quarter of which is devoted to credits.  Id typically bemoan this fact, but seeing the the title sequence is the best part of the movie, I cant help but wish in hindsight that it had gone on a little longer.  Following the aforementioned titles (reminiscent of Vacancy), were introduced to our protagonists, Dan and Mindy Summers, played by Ace Marrero and Katie Stegeman (both equally inept).  After visiting a gas station populated your run-of-the-mill creeps, weirdos and red herrings, they come across a branch in the road and soon find themselves held at gunpoint.  The set-up reminded by of the halfway decent British import ATM, right down to the Christmas Eve eve setting, but the characters are far more grating here and the writer makes the fatal mistake of giving his villain a voice.  I suppose this couldve worked had the dialogue not been so wooden or the delivery so awful.  Brad Douglas supplies the voice and Ted Levine he is not (Levines voicework made Joy Ride the delightful guilty-pleasure it turned out to be), sounding so much like the voice on my answering machine that when I wasn't giggling at his delivery, I was trying to work out a plot twist that could redeem this mess of a movie.  I won't give away the ending, but I will say that the twist never comes.  So what you're left with is a terrible script, competent if unspectacular direction, bad acting and even worse voice acting, all of which amounts to an hour and ten minutes of your life you can never get back.  Dont say I didn't warn you.",1429401600,2,1653,4.633561643835616
6938256,3,B00S0DW5WA,"Being an Eric England fan I've known and heard about this film for a couple of years. I finally got to see it.(Ace Marrero) and (Katie Stegeman) who are no strangers to England's films play Dan and Mindy Summers. A married couple with a baby on the way.

They're on the way to Dan's sisters house when they are trapped in the clutches of a madman with a high powered rifle. When asked why ? by Dan,the man says. Why not! From here they have to do whatever it takes to try and survive which includes not freezing to death as it is Christmas eve.

While I found it entertaining and the acting quite good it just felt a little hollow. I thought seeing as it was mostly dialogue, the dialogue could have been sharper .It did had some very tense moments a feeling of dread and some nice camera angles.

This is definitely not England's shining moment but it's better than a lot of low budget thrillers I've seen recently.

 As far as gore, it's not that kind of party but there is one scene with a splatter! If I were flipping channels and started watching this, I have to say I would stay on that channel to see the outcome. I also loved the song during the end credits.",1429315200,2,1166,4.257918552036199
6938257,1,B00S0DW5WA,"Dan Summers (Ace Marrero) and his expecting wife Mindy (Katie Stegeman) are traveling the holiday season to spend Christmas with his sister. Along route 16, Dan stops to remove a tree from the highway, only to be held hostage by a man in the dark woods we can't see but only hear and unfortunately the conversation is boring. Yes there is a gun that fires. Sometimes people get hit, but basically it is more boring than that film about a guy with a cell phone buried in a wooden box.

Not much horror. Just a guy complaining that it is cold. Go watch paint dry.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1425686400,6,595,4.351351351351352

8696787,2,B00S0DW5WA,"If you are a true horror fan this will be a snore fest - and if you must watch it, get it on prime only, it's not scary at all, it's a worn out plot that has been done way better. ATM for example - great flick. Watch that one instead.

 If you like average(non scary)  and need a way to pass time - go ahead pay 4.99",1442534400,,316,3.6176470588235294
