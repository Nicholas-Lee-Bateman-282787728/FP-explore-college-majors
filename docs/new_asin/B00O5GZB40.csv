8682279,2,B00O5GZB40,"I like the Ritz Bros, but this one was a chore to sit through.  A really weak script and the songs aren't so hot either.  And at 94 minutes, it seems to go on forever.  Poor Gloria Stuart. Poor Nat Pendleton!  I've enjoyed most of director William Seiter's work, but he can't help this one.

Lots of wonderful character actors wandering through the film are a plus.  Also the transfer to disc is absolutely gorgeous!  One of the best looking Fox Cinema Archive titles.  That's why I'm giving a 2 star rating at least.  Too bad the film isn't as good as the picture quality.

For major Ritz Bros fans only.  All others buy STRAIGHT, PLACE AND SHOW instead, it's a much better film.",1437609600,,680,4.403225806451613
8682280,5,B00O5GZB40,"Less than a month after the release of ""Straight, Place and Show"" Fox releases another Ritz Brothers film. Beautiful picture and sound from 35mm masters, and this is the complete print running 94 minutes. When these films were first released to television by NTA many prints were tampered with. This films suffered the worst having 14 minutes edited from the film. Fox has used a complete master and restores the film to it's original glory.
The Brothers have enough material in this, their first starring film, and it's a riot.
Two more to go, ""The Gorilla"" & ""Pack Up Your Troubles"". Now only if MCA/Universal would cough up their prints....",1413072000,5,643,4.8545454545454545
