5646908,5,B00BLXAJWO,"With all of the usual special effects in movies nowdays, it is refreshing to see a movie that brings us back to interesting dialect as well as genuine human idiosyncracies. Dorfman in love has so many personality types we can realate to, that it really makes the movie fun.
Take a break from smashing up motor cars and view somthing with human interest and insight.",1365552000,,365,4.630769230769231
5646909,5,B00BLXAJWO,"I originally viewed this movie on Direct tv and was instantly hooked on this movie for the duration. Ms. Rau really surprised me with her acting chops and so did everyone else in the movie. Its like the movie Ghost, no one expected what they got. Please watch this heartwarming story about a young woman who always does everything for every one else and nothing for herself.
I know this is a common story line but this one will fool you and Elliot Gould is just excellent. The writing and directing is top notch.
You won't go wrong watching this. enjoy!",1365120000,,553,4.485148514851486

5646911,1,B00BLXAJWO,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It just made me feel so bad for no reason because the movie was just SO BAD. I genuinely regret wasting my time with this pile of garbage. Terrible acting. Terrible plot. Terrible everything. Save yourself the misery and go pluck your eyebrows.,1515974400,,284,4.588235294117647
5646912,5,B00BLXAJWO,"I originally enjoyed this film on Netflix. Another good film hopeless romantics will adore. Every story like this has a bit of truth in it. Oftentimes, the most important person in the relationship you must believe in, is you. Everything else will step into place.",1515888000,,264,4.888888888888889

5646914,5,B00BLXAJWO,"A warm and funny, well written, romantic comedy whose real strength is in character development. Yes it is predictable, but the acting and character development are a cut above typical romantic comedies, Sara Rue is very good and believable in her role, and Elliot Gould made me bust our laughing in several well-timed sarcastic quips. Go into this with modest expectations, and youll come out of it smiling, entertained, and with warm and fuzzy feelings. Bonus: Indie music soundtrack of artists and songs Ive never heard of but now will likely add to playlist.",1515542400,,562,4.98936170212766

5646916,4,B00BLXAJWO,"Good story, great acting.  Funny!  The sound track was done well.  Dorfman's two neighbor ladies were quite entertaining.  Elliott Gould does a great job as her dad.  I haven't seen him in years, and he's still great.",1514592000,,217,4.756756756756757

5646923,2,B00BLXAJWO,"I have a hard time believing this movie has so many positive reviews....and I'm not even a negative person. This brother, ""Daniel"" character is such a major turn off. The whole movie is just blah. Nothing special.",1504915200,4,213,4.783783783783784

5646928,5,B00BLXAJWO,Very cute and entertaining movie; I have watched it several times.  A transformaton story is always fun and I really appriciated that the lead character did not have to get skinny or dye her hair blond to become a swan.,1501459200,2,219,4.475
5646929,5,B00BLXAJWO,Deb is your average  woman and she tries to make everything better for everyone....taking care of her father and brother but then she finds out they need to take care of themselves and they CAN.

5646933,3,B00BLXAJWO,"Just OK. Am I the only reviewer who loathed the cheating porn-addicted brother storyline? Everything was predictable. What could have been a little more in-depth story about family dynamics, loss of a loved one, standing up for yourself, etc. was shallow. Enjoyed Sara Rue.",1496966400,2,273,5.2272727272727275

5646935,4,B00BLXAJWO,"There is no super hero, no unnecessary violence or sex. I agree with some reviewers if they're looking for excitement, then this is not a film for them. But I like how a movie can be pure clean fun great for all ages. Sometimes it's hard to act without all drama up. So I think acting was actually natural and pretty good.",1496707200,2,322,4.209677419354839

5646939,5,B00BLXAJWO,Romantic and uplifting.  It's a really cute way of showing us sometimes what we're looking for is something we've created in our minds. And we have to be open to things that are really there for us. Cute and very well-done movie,1496275200,,228,4.428571428571429

5646947,4,B00BLXAJWO,"Very well done. Great acting. Snappy dialogue. Spoiler alert: OK so I came back to this review and took away one star for the selfless nice reporter doing a 180 at the end and suddenly becoming a money hungry, sex-crazed maniac. I liked the story choice that she chose the wrong guy but I wish there would have been a more plausible reason that she realized she chose wrong. But overall I really enjoyed the movie.",1494720000,,414,4.4605263157894735

5646955,5,B00BLXAJWO,"Don't care what others have said about being ""predictable"" it was a great feel good movie.

5646965,5,B00BLXAJWO,"I moved from So California as a teen to Northern California so it was like going home for me. I could relate to always saying I'm Sorry and it took a friend from Burbank to break me of that habit. (I still slip now and again) Sara Rue was amazing in lead role and I loved seeing her stand up for herself. It may be considered a ""chick Flick"" but I think guys might relate with a bit of both male leads. Actually there were 5 male leads all were cast perfect in their roles. Haaz Sleiman who played Cookie reminds me of that friend that figured out why I said I'm sorry all the time. Luckily the reason and I are now divorced. lol  It was great seeing Elliott Gould play Deborah's Dad. I'm glad I took a chance on Dorfman in Love. I hope you like it too.",1493164800,3,753,4.02

5646978,4,B00BLXAJWO,"After watching some poor movies I have changed my mind on this one. One of the problems here is that there is about 60% of the movie that shouldn't be in the movie and tested my patience.  Sara Rue stars, again, as the quasi fat people pleaser who is supporting her family and not living her own life.  She works for her brother who is a jerk and sort of mean to her... and cares for her dad who is Elliot Gould. So the writers of the movie like to put him in a lot of scenes. Dorftman has an unrequited crush on a douche. The blonde guy. So enamored is she -- she agrees to pet sit his cat when he is away. His home is in an ultra hip loft in down town LA.

It is there where Deb meets ""Cookie"". A complete babe who, weirdly, at first tells her he is gay. But he isn't he just wants to paint her and not seem weird. Cookie is an artist and instantly seems drawn to Deb. Deb doesn't really notice him but likes him too. This relationship has some serious UST... and their growing affection is realistically done. But Deb continues to obsess on the douche guy that she had a crush on, until that is, he returns from wherever he was and she sees what she has in Cookie.  The best way to watch this movie is with the fast forward button.",1473724800,3,1234,4.024489795918368

5646981,2,B00BLXAJWO,"Predictable characters and scenario.  A  plain but pleasant, young-ish woman who lives at home with her father in the San Fernando Valley, and works as an accountant for her brother, listens to romance novels when she isn't pining for an impossibly good-looking, successful, overseas news journalist.  She takes care of all of these men in one way or another and gets taken for granted..  The impossible cutie gets another great overseas assignment, but, boo-hoo, has no one to watch his cat in his new, impossibly hip new loft in a new, impossibly cool area of L.A.  So, of course our heroine volunteers...not just to watch the cat but to unpack all of his stuff (he's just moved in) paint the walls and decorate. She really really loves this guy.  Enter a pair of .floozies who decide that Plain Jane needs a makeover.  So sporting a new dyed red hair do and lots of makeup, and with the help of a neighbor guy who boosts her self-confidence she starts her new life.  I stopped watching here because it was all too apparent where this was going.  The only good thing in the film was Eliot Gould who played the cranky dad.  Maybe he was just expressing his real attitude towards the script.",1440460800,2,1191,4.601895734597156

5646983,3,B00BLXAJWO,"Sarah rue gives a solid performance, but the supporting factors let her down.  The writing and budget for this film don't allow it to take form in an honest or likable way.  Eliot Gould is always good, but his performance isn't allowed to reach the depths that it thematically is reaching for. Johann Urb isn't really a hidden weapon since he's all over the place, but I almost always feel he gets the shaft in his roles and this fits the mold.  I guess it's hard to write for a guy who's really good looking. Who knew?!? At first he's presented as a cocky, but well meaning guy who may or may not be stringing her along. The ending throws all of that in the trash for a complete douche makeover and it just feels like lazy writing like most of the movie.  There's lots of good pieces here that don't add up.",1431993600,2,808,4.261437908496732

5646995,5,B00BLXAJWO,"I just finished watching this movie on Netflix. My mom recommended that I watch it. Dorfman in Love is about a woman named Debra who is madly in love with her older brother's best friend (who only really pays attention to her when he needs her to do something for him, and she is so blindly infatuated that will bend over backwards to make him happy), she is an accountant for her bonehead brother, and she takes care of her mourning widower father who refuses to eat, constantly wears black, and watches infomercials all day. Debra juggles all of this without complaint, even though it is clear to the audience that she is unsatisfied, overlooked, feeling lost, and missing her deceased mother.

When Jay, the man she is in love with, leaves town for work, she travels from her quiet life in the Valley to bustling Los Angeles, where she babysits Jay's cat and is forced to unpack his belongings and decorate his new loft. She is determined to accomplish all of this by the time Jay returns home because she thinks he will return her feelings if she manages to impress him enough. Over the course of a week, she befriends an artist named Cookie and begins to explore everything that Los Angeles has to offer. Over the course of a week, Debra begins to figure out who she is, what she wants from life, and is able to tap into her inner spunk to prove to her family and friends that she is a force to be reckoned with. A lot happens in this movie, but I'm not going to rehash it here.

What I thought of Dorfman in Love: This was a really, really pleasant surprise! In fact, I think the cover of the DVD is a little misleading. This isn't a corny chick flick; it's a very well-made movie that is relentlessly funny, hilarious, touching, inspirational, empowering, and relatable. Debra Dorfman starts out as this cute, though rather plain and frumpy, girl who listens to romance novels on audio on her way to work, snorts when she laughs, and is totally socially awkward. She is adorable and endearing, and the actress who brings this character to life did such an amazing job. Even prior to Debra's transformation, when she is a kind of a doormat, the audience can recognize her sass, charm, and vivacity. These qualities just become more apparent as she leans to quit apologizing for things that aren't her fault, to stand up for herself, and to assert herself as a human being with wants and needs of her own.

Also, the supporting cast was fantastic. Everyone played their role so well. Other characters in the story, such as the father, grow and change as well -- not just Debra. I got a real kick out of the dad. Another thing I really appreciated about this movie: there was a lot of diversity, in terms of people, which I feel more accurately represents life. Most of the time, I watch movies where everyone is White, except for one random ethnic minority, or vice versa. There never seems to be a real in-between of this in movies, and I understand that filmmakers do this because they are trying to make their movie marketable for who they think will most likely watch the movie. Maybe it's just me, but that has always been a real pet peeve of mine. In this movie, however, there is a whole melting pot of people coexisting and intermingling with each other, which I think is more realistic and simply fills me with joy to see.

I definitely recommend this movie; it's simply awesome -- and not just for women! :)",1405296000,,3422,4.514516129032258

Sara Rue is fantastic, and I very much appreciate that her character doesn't have to get skinny as part of her transformation into a swan.  Haaz Sleiman managed to make it believable that a totally buff and hot ""player"" could reveal himself to be kind and somewhat shy in the face of a real relationship, and one who would fall for Rue's goofy character.  All supporting actors were perfect in their roles.  This movie is not rocket surgery, but it is a wonderfully easy to watch feel-good movie that I'll revisit again and again.",1390435200,19,578,4.693069306930693

This is what romance is supposed to be like.  The ending is so powerful that I watch it over and over.  It makes me cry each time.  Whoever made this movies is a genius.

5647008,5,B00BLXAJWO,"This movie is about changes.  When the main character, Deb, goes to the newly re-built downtown Los Angeles area to cat-sit for a friend, a new world opens to her.  She meets new people, different people than she knew back in the San Fernando Valley. She reluctantly gets a makeover, and she gives her friends loft a makeover.  She learns to ride the Metro.  She undergoes changes, and she finally becomes comfortable with herself.

Dorfman in Love has much to recommend it. The main character is adorable.  The audience wants her to get what she wants from life and is delighted when she does.  The downtown L.A. scenery is an interesting part of the story.  I lived in the L.A. area nearly all my life and I never saw the rebirth of the city like I did in this film.  I also enjoyed the music, which came up in just the right places and enhanced the visuals.

This is a feel-good movie in the sense of Georgie Girl and My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  Is it a chick-flick?  Yeah, but so what?  She watches sports with you, doesnt she?  Rent or buy the movie and watch it with her.  Youll make her happy.  Who knows what will happen next?",1389398400,5,1133,4.349282296650718

5647015,5,B00BLXAJWO,"Most romantic films I find to be stupid and the women in them pathetic because they are so desperate for a man. In ""Dorfman in Love"", Deb Dorfman pines after Jay Cleary but not in a pathetic desperate way. So many women in romantic movies seem to feel they must have a man to feel happy in life and to have self-worth, as if not having a man makes them nothing. But in the case of Deb Dorfman, she goes about her life without feeling she has to have a man. Yes, she says she wants love, but who doesn't? Deb's lack of confidence isn't because she doesn't have Jay as her boyfriend, but because she sees herself not as someone who is fun, sweet, intelligent and beautiful. In this movie Deb eventually learns to live her own life instead of living it for others. She also learns to see herself as someone who is fun, sweet, intelligent and beautiful and although she didn't need a man to show her this about herself, it was a man who did. It wasn't because he's a man, but because he's the type of person who sees beauty and is able to turn it around for others to see. Haaz Sleiman as Cookie I think really stole the film; he truly shines in this movie. Sara Rue is adorable as Deb as well. The film is well acted and not too cheesy or too slapstick like so many romantic films are. I enjoyed seeing Los Angeles as I was born and raised in Southern California and I am homesick and miss my old stomping grounds. The only down side to this film are two things: 1. Having Haaz Sleiman's character, Cookie, go from saying he's gay to falling in love with a woman. In real life, this typically doesn't happen. I have had several gay friends and they don't suddenly just switch sexual orientation; and 2. The makeover of Deb. Before the makeover she looked like an average person. Then she was transformed into this model looking creature that barely resembled the first Deb. That's all well and good, but doing the makeover shtick is not only a tired romantic clich (remember Toula Portokalos's makeover in, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding""?), but it implies that an average looking woman can't find love unless she's turned into someone who's pictures belong in Vogue magazine. But for what it's worth, this is a pretty decent movie. I really liked it. As far as romance movies go, this is one of the better ones I've seen so I'm giving it five out of five stars.",1382745600,2,2354,4.364464692482915
5647016,1,B00BLXAJWO,"I am not trying to sound too sarcastic here, but all the 5 star reviews for this movie make me think they are plugs.  This movie was slow, boring, and was ill suited for even a background movie when it became overly formulaic.

The main character - Deb Dorfman (played by Sarah Rue) gave this movie a very realistic touch.  I was surprised to see Eliot Gold in this.  The romance is a bit predictable but the plot is good.  The comedy is good and doesn't push to the obscene (although Deb's brother's plot almost went there).

I rented this for instant video rental.  To be on the safe side of not having to rely on WiFi streaming, I downloaded the video first.  In doing so I was able to watch this on my kindle fire with the WiFi off too.  Rewinding and fast-fowarding works 10 times better this way.  There was no buffering needed at any time.

She has the opportunity to cat sit in a downtown LA loft (which I had the very fortunate opportunity to visit when I won a contest with the writer and producer through LAEMMLE theaters!!) and there she begins her personal transformation. At first she can't say no to people, is pretty insecure, and she is afraid to do things on her own (like ride the metro, shop in the area, etc) but she ventures out and becomes more independent and learns how to have boundaries with people in her life.

5647045,2,B00BLXAJWO,"""Dorfman in Love""  is a romantic comedy about San Fernando Valley girl Deb Dorfman (Sara Rue), who has no special guy in her life though she spends lots of time taking care of men.  They include her demanding widowed father Burt (Elliott Gould); her vain, stingy married brother Daniel (Jonathan Chase), for whom she works as an accountant; and her journalist friend and secret crush, Jay (Johann Urb).

When Jay has to leave town for a week on assignment, wallflower Deb happily offers to cat-sit at the cool downtown Los Angeles loft he's just moved into.  Deb busies herself giving the loft a makeover while Jay is away and, with the urging of Jay's neighbors, gives herself one, too.

Ms. Rue does a commendable job with a role that locks her into stereotypical behavior and predictable outcomes.  She's has a pleasant personality, and that makes this otherwise bland film watchable.  Elliott Gould -- like Alan Arkin -- has entered that phase of his career in which parts call for cantankerous, kvetchy codgers.  His scenes enliven an otherwise uninspired movie.

5647054,5,B00BLXAJWO,"Dorfman in Love is a very charming and funny film. Its got a superb cast and Sara Rue is wonderful as the lead. The film is also sort of an hommage to downtown LA. Growing up in LA myself, I never had much need to spend time in downtown. But over the past couple of years, a lot of cool bars and restaurants have opened up and with public transportation improving its quickly becoming the highlight of the city. It's cool to see Dorfman showcase that. I highly recommend checking it out! It's a perfect pizza and a movie night, kind of movie.",1367712000,,542,4.271844660194175
5647055,5,B00BLXAJWO,This is a loving and funny look at the challenges and rewards of making changes. The locales and visuals add a great deal. The best part is the courage and caring the characters bring to their own lives and learn to share with each other.,1367712000,,238,4.311111111111111

5647057,4,B00BLXAJWO,"I wasn't prepared to like this film as much as I did. The performances were great, it was well cast and the story, though sometimes predictable, was told in a very fresh and enjoyable way. It was also a love letter to Los Angeles highlighting the wonderful and diverse looks about the city. It's one of those little indie films that is completely worth seeing.",1366761600,,360,4.553846153846154

5647061,5,B00BLXAJWO,"Who says romantic comedies are dead? Dorfman in Love proves that the genre is alive and well when in the hands of a producer, writer, director and cast who know what they're doing. It's a romantic comedy in the best sense: heartfelt, observant, and yes, romantic and comedic. No easy task to pull off these days. But more than a romantic comedy, Dorfman is a touching story of a woman's self-discovery. Her growth is measured in tears, laughs and the love she deserves. As a bonus, her personal journey takes place in downtown Los Angeles, the most interesting part of the city, which has never looked better on film. You'll be in love Dorfman.",1365984000,,644,4.657894736842105
5647062,5,B00BLXAJWO,"Amusing, funny, hip, and believable short transformation of valley girl who reluctantly but charmingly becomes a city girl with some backbone and great self deprecating observations of herself then goes into the bigger world to find more than she ever expected.  Worth nearly all the 90 minutes and you get a true inside sense of LA's emerging downtown while you are at it.",1365897600,,373,4.920634920634921

I love Sara Rue and thought the movie was one of the sweetest and most uplifting rom-coms I have seen in a long time. Not to mention the hotties! I recognized Haaz Sleiman from another great flick, The Visitor, a few years ago and he just smoulders in this one! And the other love interest?! Yes please!!!
