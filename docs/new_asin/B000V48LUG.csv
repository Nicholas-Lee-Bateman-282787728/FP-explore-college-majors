8216427,5,B000V48LUG,"Showed program to a ladies' group.  Very well received.
Melissa Soalt is a great teacher, and gave tons of
practical advice and showed all moves slowly and quickly.
Two people already purchased their own DVD copy!",1446076800,,213,4.916666666666667
8216428,5,B000V48LUG,"I watch this dvd set once every year and a half to two years.  Hands down it is the single most  viewer friendly and
immediately useable self-defense video on the market today.  I have over 20 years of training in martial arts and
combat arts and firmly believe this is the single best dvd set on the market.

Meilssa Soalt is a very generous individual and sent me the dvd set before my deployment.  And in her own words,
she asked me to ""SHARE IT"" with my fellow soldiers.  It's more important to her to keep people safe rather than get
more people to buy her product.

Finally, it is also a GREAT product for smaller children or men who are victims of bullying.",1355875200,2,664,4.306451612903226
8216429,4,B000V48LUG,"I have about 15 years of experience in martial arts - I am defenitely not any kind of expert, but I know first hand what does and does not work in a street fight/self defense situation. This DVD is literally the only one I have seen that does NOT teach worthless theory, sparring techniques, or MMA (which I love) - it teaches SELF DEFENSE - there is a major difference!!! It is also taught by a woman and that is very important, because it is a self defense DVD for women. However, anyone can benefit from these practical self defense techniques: men, women, or children. It is the only DVD for women's self defense that I have seen that I would recommend.
