2204983,5,B00078FAOQ,"Hey! Whas up people! What I gotta say is that I thought that the mini movie was great. It's just Usher doing what he was born to do. he's just a great all-around entertainer. He has great acting skills to me. I think he really knows how to put you in the character and make you believe it. I loved the cameos in it.  That scene in the beginning with Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs and Naomi Campbell was hilarious to me. Actress Joy Bryant was on point. The dances in between were hot. I'm telling you... if you do not have this DVD, it is a must have. Check it out y'all

2204984,4,B00078FAOQ,"If you a fan of Usher, you got to get this DVD. I seen it on MTV and it's corny like this other cat say, but I still ordered it. If you like seeing Usher dance and seduce the laydeez then you gonna like this. He acting too.",1109548800,4,223,3.6666666666666665
2204985,2,B00078FAOQ,"Usher's new DVD movie thing is absolutely horrible. I downloaded it from an Usher fansite and watched it and deleted it. The video is so dumb, Usher can't act but hey he's still sexxy!",1107388800,2,184,4.4411764705882355

8045844,5,B00078FAOQ,"I chose the cheap new one, not direct from Amazon, only cost $6. The quality is excellent!!! The movie is kinda short but there are also Usher's MVs in it!!! Bonus! And there is a Audio CD with 4 songs - great value, a must buy if you are huge fan of Usher!",1333756800,,257,3.8679245283018866
8045845,1,B00078FAOQ,Sound quality at start of video was very poor. Audible crackles. Also there are only 3 videos. Did not feel as if I got my money's worth.,1289865600,,137,4.111111111111111
8045846,5,B00078FAOQ,"I first saw this video at my sister-in-law's house and loved it so much I went on the hunt for it.  When I finally found it, I bought two extra for some friends who I knew would love it also.  It is entertaining and well made.  The cast of characters is great.  This is one of those videos you can put on during a party to add to the party vibe.  GREAT VIDEO....",1288656000,,362,3.904109589041096
8045847,1,B00078FAOQ,"this has to be the dumbest thing usher could have done. why does he want to be like michael jackson so much? smh, even michael jackson pissed me off this this kind of crap. some people just love to much attention.",1129248000,,213,4.219512195121951
8045848,4,B00078FAOQ,Usher - Rhythm City Vol 1:Caught Up is a long form video with four singles from Usher's Confessions album which are all linked together. My favorite segment of the DVD was the Seduction video.,1113955200,,192,4.676470588235294
8045849,5,B00078FAOQ,"Overall the mini-movie part of the DVD was alright, but not grip-to-the-edge kind of seat interesting. It's just what he said it was in the making of the mini-movie: making videos for the bonus tracks on the Confessions special edition CD and joining them into one small movie. I give it 2 stars. It's also wonderful that Usher included all the music videos from ""Confessions."" That saved me a lot of VHS tape and time.

Now the bonus audio CD is easy listening. I give it 3 stars. It's really nice how the first couple of songs show how much he loves a special someone (or USED to love *cough* but I'm not getting into that part right now).  In ""Dot com"" Usher compares body parts to computers and in ""Doin The Most"" he shows his appreciation and gratitude for the lady he loves.  ""It Is What It Is"" the relationship has gone sour and Usher won't admit he made a mistake and ends up faulting his lady for it- which I think is not fair at all. Love is a just a chance we take.  Jermaine Dupri helps end the CD with the club track ""What You Need."" This song has a good beat to it, good lyrics (I love the Ooo la la la at the end part), and helps end this whole audio CD on the positive note that it started out on.",1113264000,7,1213,4.127118644067797
8045850,3,B00078FAOQ,"I love Usher in ever way. Eyes,body,voice,teeth,lips,
everthing. But this DVD and music video (or mini movie) don't work for me. I love all his video but this one the video that I don't like in
""Caught Up"" is the video ""Caught Up"" and when I saw the video on t.v on New Years I said ""this is stupid, if Usher know me it would 1,000 % better.'Cause the beginnin' of the ""mini movie"" the song "" Take My Hand "" wasn't the way I so in my mind, I didn't picture it in a ""modern club"" I thought I would be tight if it was in black & white, oldy type of tape, and dress like in the 20's or 30's. That is how I feel people might think she ain't a true Usher fan but this my opinion. I think he his acting more like Michael Jackson. Come on not a lot of people can make music video like ""Thriller"". Don't even think about getting this one. It ain't worther it .AND I'M STICKIN' 2 IT!",1111795200,2,874,3.9157303370786516
