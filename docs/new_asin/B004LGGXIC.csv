4401385,5,B004LGGXIC,"I bought the DVD as a present for someone who was unable to see the Planet Green series.  It was a reminder of my earlier years on a semi-self-sustaining farm in Upstate New York, albeit sans goats.  If you've ever gardened, farmed or had an urge to go back to your ""roots"", this series will either cure you or encourage you.  Funniest stuff on the telly, and I hope they're back for a third season.  Right now, I'm trying to find one of those rare black sheep.  I also bought Josh's book ""The Bucolic Plague"" on Amazon.  Now I'm trying to decide to whom I should send both the book and the DVD for Christmas.",1317254400,2,609,4.252173913043478
4401386,2,B004LGGXIC,"Having first becoming acquainted with Kilmer-Purcell through his hilarious memoir, ""I Am Not Myself These Days"", I was disappointed to find there to be almost no evidence of the same witty, acerbic and wildly inappropriate voice prepared to go anywhere/say anything in the series. A decent enough show, it struggles to find a genre, settling uncomfortably (for me, at least) on a strange concoction that tries to teach ""gays are people too. Now buy our soap"". Crafted by a team clearly aware of the high stakes involved and with deep experience in branding and marketing, it does not deliver on its implied promise of a warts-n-all documentary of Green Acres style, fish out of water living. In what feels like a single-camera production, the dialogue between Brent and Josh comes across as stilted and rehearsed - this sense of two people checking off talking points for the camera only intensifies the uncomfortable feeling one has watching the couple. The financial and psychological pressures of taking on such a property as the Beekman must be immense, and one must question of the wisdom of adding in a camera crew to their daily lives, especially when at least one half of the couple appears to be a perfectionist who needs to be in full control of his environment. Thus, most sequences with the pair seem either highly contrived, or create that same, uncomfortably tense feeling you get when watching a couple ""not"" have an argument in public.

That's not to say that there is nothing good about the series. There are some truly touching moments, and some genuine laughs, and unsurprisingly they are those that are allowed to happen and develop naturally. I hope that the show does well and lasts for a number of seasons allowing Brent and Josh to learn to relax around the cameras. Because once that happens, you have the makings of a great show.",1316563200,5,1855,4.851735015772871
4401387,4,B004LGGXIC,"Having read the book ""Bucolic Plague,"" I followed up with the first season DVD by the Beekman Boys and loved it. Can't wait until the second season DVD is available.",1311379200,,165,4.533333333333333
4401388,5,B004LGGXIC,"LOVE IT! Great, I can't wait to buy Season 2! I highly recommend this DVD. It is really a good show.",1309996800,4,100,3.8095238095238093
4401389,4,B004LGGXIC,"I finished the book in one day.  It's light, frothy, filled with laughs, confusion, bills, miracles; in short a lovely experience.  I've see the Beeman Boys on TV, but the book filled in a lot of details.  Very enjoyable.",1308960000,,221,4.615384615384615
4401390,5,B004LGGXIC,"I found myself smiling a lot,(sometimes laughing, and sometimes tears,) while watching Brent and Josh in their daily lives. Totally worth the price! Love it!",1308787200,,157,5.32
4401391,5,B004LGGXIC,"There is Brent and Josh in all of us and it's our own dream to have a Beekman to call our own!  I have seen the Beekman, the store and the great village of Sharon Spings, NY.  Take the time to view this masterpiece, visit the town and I'm sure you will be hooked!  This whole idea is so very contagious!  You will be back!!!",1306972800,6,324,3.9384615384615387
4401392,5,B004LGGXIC,"Quite possibly one of the most engaging, insightful, funny - and yes, for these new emerging times, profound reads ever.  I never reread a book.  Ever.  But, I can't part with this one until we have one more 'dance...'  You will be surprised at this gem.",1303344000,4,254,4.456521739130435
4401393,5,B004LGGXIC,"This is the funniest, most realistic show on TV.  It's a laugh out loud, tender, touching series that anyone can relate to.  I look forward to every episode, tape them, and watch them over and over.  From Polka Spot the llama stealing scenes, to the goats giving birth to the next generation, and slaughtering the pigs, this is a no holds barred look at farm life.  The new season just started, and I can't wait to see what happens next!",1301529600,12,437,4.425
4401394,5,B004LGGXIC,"Ummm, don't know whats going on at Amazon. Selling too many products perhaps? Their names are Josh Kilmer-Purcell and Dr. Brent Ridge, not Josh and Brent Beekman. Teriffic show, however!",1299456000,4,186,5.233333333333333
4401395,5,B004LGGXIC,love the dvd,1411430400,,12,3.3333333333333335
4401396,5,B004LGGXIC,"This show was my favorite when it aired.  I am disappointed it did not go farther than season 2.

I think it was one of the first TV programs that showed that gay couples are just like straight couples.  The fact that they are gay is not stressed in the show. The show is more about a couple embarking on an interesting adventure and trying to follow their dreams.

I also recommend that you read Josh's book The Bucolic Plague.  It is absolutely hilarious.",1405555200,,457,4.392857142857143
4401397,5,B004LGGXIC,"What can I say? I love The Fab Beekman Boys, so having any of their DVD's is a real treat!",1396742400,,90,3.55
4401398,5,B004LGGXIC,I saw the Beekman boys on TV and fell in love with them and if you want a good laugh then this is a must see as two city boys learn to farm.,1392681600,,140,3.272727272727273
4401399,5,B004LGGXIC,"We need more - come one, we are ready for more fun and drama.  Very well produced and a great escape into bucolic living.",1389398400,,121,4.041666666666667
4401400,5,B004LGGXIC,"If you didn't catch this when it aired on the now-defunct Planet Green, you need to watch it here.  Unlike the current television programs that purport to show the changing American family with stereotypes, straight actors in gay parts, gay actors in straight parts, and foul language that isn't funny, the Beekman Boys are real, really gay, farming in a village of 500 people who think they are nice guys, and have the same laughs and arguments and throw the same hissy fits we all do.  In short, they are Real.  And we know for a fact they are generous friends, great neighbors, and funny smart.  They won the Amazing Race last year on CBS, paid off their farm and built a business that is benefitting this small town in upstate New York, so for that alone, they are living the American dream of life with love and happiness.  Good on them!",1382745600,4,842,4.5131578947368425
4401401,2,B004LGGXIC,The cookbooks recipes are very difficult to follow and did not turn out. They are a great disappointment to what I was expecting from two fine individuals.,1382140800,,155,4.777777777777778
4401402,5,B004LGGXIC,"If you saw them on the Amazing Race you already know how much fun The Beekman Boys are... they are two sweet guys and one very cute couple. I discovered them the best way possible... via Josh's fantastic book ""The Bucolic Plague"". This is one of thos ""laugh out loud"" reads. I would read the book before ordering this DVD.",1381968000,,322,4.383333333333334
4401403,5,B004LGGXIC,I watched this show from the beginning and wish with all my heart that someone would pick them up again. They are the two mos wonderful human beings on this earth!!!,1371340800,,165,4.354838709677419
4401404,5,B004LGGXIC,"I Love these guys! The story is everyone's dream of running your self sufficient lifestyle away from the daily grind - or is it?
It's a delightful story of two deep thinking men. I give this to friends when they need a cheer up  - it's dleightful kust like Josh & Brent.  PS throw in Martha Stewart - and people with flair at everything - it's gorgeous.

Since then I've watched their tv Show, and win the amazing race. i have their soap and recipe book.  I'm a fan..",1368144000,,467,4.213483146067416
4401405,5,B004LGGXIC,Really an enjoyable DVD! I've even shared in with a friend who had never heard of The Fabulous Beekman Boys.,1361145600,,108,4.45
4401406,5,B004LGGXIC,This show is so much fun!  I'm very glad that I bought this; it has humor and drama and a whole lot of love!,1360022400,,108,3.5
4401407,5,B004LGGXIC,"We love Season 1 of The Fabulous Beekman Boys.  But where is Season Two???????? Does anyone have any information about this?  Why it hasn't been issued?  Season 3 is currently being televised, right?",1357430400,,199,4.96969696969697
4401408,5,B004LGGXIC,Josh and Brent are so incredibly likeable.  I'm under the weather and watched all of Season 1 in one evening.  I can't wait to move on to Season 2.  Farmer John makes ME cry when he cries and gets emotional over his goats.  Highly recommend.  I want to see these guys succeed!  I had been rooting for them all season on Amazing Race and was so happy they won - it wasn't until the show was over that I knew they had their OWN show.  I'm glad I didn't know because it just proves that my liking and rooting for them was for all the right reasons - they're genuinely good people.,1356825600,,577,4.098214285714286
4401409,5,B004LGGXIC,I got this last year as a present and the person just loved it. I might even get another one.,1355616000,,93,3.7
4401410,5,B004LGGXIC,"Capivating, interesting, funny and I couldn't put the book down. You can tell they really love each other and they make people like them because of the way they are.",1350950400,,165,4.533333333333333
4401411,5,B004LGGXIC,"I loved Josh and Brent's sharing of their life on a goat farm, city boys who took on the challenges of living in upstate NY and beginning/growing a business to make the farm profitable.  Josh's commute by train to and from Manhattan to work at his advertising agency, to Brent's bringing his expertise from the Martha Stewart show, give the viewer an honest and realistic look at farming, and the strains on their relationship from being apart during the week.  I admire their hard work and devotion to growing heirloom fruits and vegetables, canning and freezing the produce, caring for their animals, running a mercantile with goat's milk products, etc.",1349568000,,655,4.945454545454545
4401412,2,B004LGGXIC,"Comedy is such a subjective thing, isn't it? I mean, some people love dry wit and other prefer slapstick. My own tastes must be out of sync with today's television since I'm definitely in the minority here. I just didn't care for this show -- I didn't find it at all funny.

First of all, I don't care for ""reality"" shows to begin with, so that was an issue from the start. But this never seemed ""real"" at all -- it was stagey and the dialogue was stilted. When people are obviously aware they're on camera, their actions are seldom authentic.

Also, watching two apparently fairly wealthy guys play at being farmers wasn't for me. The guy (can't remember which was which) who had to line up the farm machines all neat in a row wasn't funny or even quirky. He was seriously neurotic. It was almost as bad as watching Paris Hilton trying to act like a ""normal"" middle class person.

I think the premise of two city folk (gay or straight) moving to the country might have been funny as a scripted sitcom, but this didn't work for me at all. I'll think I'll go and watch reruns of the old British comedy, Good Neighbors.",1344988800,,1117,4.386473429951691
4401413,4,B004LGGXIC,Interesting first season of this series and fun to watch how they went from city slickers to country farmhands and turn their little goat soap into a gigantic money-making endeavor now.,1338595200,,185,5.0
4401414,5,B004LGGXIC,"After reading The Bucolic Plague, I became a Josh Kilmer Pursell fan...maybe fanatic. So I purchased his other two books at the first season of The Fabulous Beekman Boys.

The Fabulous Beekman Boys is very entertaining and really makes me want to visit Sharon Springs, NY. These two guys are wonderful. I can't wait to pick up the second and final season.",1317859200,,355,4.725806451612903
8434367,5,B004LGGXIC,First I read their book. Then i bought this dvd. Then my friend and I just had to drive to New York to meet these guys and see their farm. I wish there were more seasons. Love the Beekman Boys!,1512518400,,193,3.85

8434372,3,B004LGGXIC,"I read the book first and it was wonderfully humorous.  Looked forward to seeing the guys ""up close and personal"" on the DVD.  The DVD I found to be depressing, full of discontent and back biting.  I do rather wonder if the network put them up to the constant disharmony and bickering in front of the camera in an effort to keep up with the expected flavor of other reality shows.  A lot of the reactions were repetitious and felt staged.  I would love to see the ""Beekman Boys"" do it their way, I think it would be a hoot and a half.  Sadly did not see much of Bubba and his lovely golden orbs and I hear that he has now passed.",1439769600,,629,4.073170731707317
8434373,5,B004LGGXIC,Fabulous! Really.  Two genuinely good guys. Wish the series was still on.,1439164800,,73,5.083333333333333

They don't grow their own crops or raise their own pigs or make their own cheese.
They just organize parties. If I were a young man just getting started, I would be
disappointed stereotypes of cross dressing and odd behavior can be this real world.
