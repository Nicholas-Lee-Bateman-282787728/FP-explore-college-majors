Marlon takes at least twice as long to say something as anyone else would.  He often says, ""We're not uh, uh, uh, going to cover this because, uh, uh, we did in our, uh, previous episode.""  The other problem is that it is a very odd form of Salsa.  He doesn't use the the standard 1-2-3, 5-6-7.  He also will do something rediculous like bending over and turning in circles.  He will spend at least 10 minutes on this, and then go in the other direction for another 10 minutes.
  For a real salsa dvd, check out Juan & Diana, or Al & Edie.",1082851200,3,682,4.184615384615385
