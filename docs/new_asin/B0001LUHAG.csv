8014190,5,B0001LUHAG,It is  unsettling how a show like this is really around the corner in our world . I have a multi- region DVD player. Glad I found this movie.,1504656000,,141,3.8620689655172415
8014191,5,B0001LUHAG,"Plot:  in a a very near time, a government-run game randomly pulls the serial numbers of five ""contenders"" to play a game of death.  The sixth player, in this case, is the returning champion - Dawn - back for her seventh series, the make or break where if she win, she breaks out of the cycle and retires.  Eight months pregnant, she fights as much fro her unborn child as her freedom.  For this, her final series, the show brings her back to her home town, and one of her ""randomly selected"" potential victims is the ex who abandoned her after high school.

The movie plays hard with the reality show tropes - each contender is followed by a cameraman, who sometimes get in the way; there are interviews with friends and family; old home movies and photos; and nothing is sacred.  There are also hints at more going on in the world outside the show, with the possibility of escape from the system and the chance of survival that would offer.

A funny movie, the humor is strictly of the dark kind, coming from the absurd juxtaposition of the utter banality of a reality show with the all too real force to murder.",1454630400,,1114,4.431372549019608
8014192,5,B0001LUHAG,"Any fan of Battle Royale, or anyone who enjoys dark, cynical, anti-pop culture humor will truly appreciate the Series 7 take on a brutal blood-sport-turned-reality TV. I wish there was a Series 8 and I wish there was a DVD!",1168300800,,223,4.6
