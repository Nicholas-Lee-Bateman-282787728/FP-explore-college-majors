5495172,4,B00ARWXFBC,My little girl gave it the rating.  I asked her how she liked it and how many stars it should receive.  Four is what she said!,1388102400,,126,3.8076923076923075
5495173,5,B00ARWXFBC,"These are the cutest toys.  A little over an inch tall, perfect size bc my son loves to take them everywhere he goes!
absolutely overjoyed with my purchase!",1388102400,,156,4.571428571428571
5495174,4,B00ARWXFBC,Great DVD for children. Teaches the little one to value friendships and respect each other through a good storyline. This show should be picked up by one of the children networks.,1372550400,4,179,4.806451612903226
5495175,5,B00ARWXFBC,"Care Bears are some of my all time favorite characters that I grew up on in the 80's. I was thrilled to receive Totally Sweet Adventures to share a little piece of my childhood with my children.

The Care Bears are exactly as I remember them. Super cute, fluffy and adventurous! The graphics are amazing and make the bears and their surroundings look so lifelike it's easy to get lost in. I love the camera angles that were creative and enhanced the experience.

This DVD is perfect for my three year old. There are great life lessons to be learned that she could understand. I like that there are ""bad guys"" even though Beastley is pretty darn cute and cuddly himself. It's nice to have someone that represents a bad example without being scary enough to give my kids nightmares.

Cheer Bear was always my favorite between her plush pink color and rainbow emblem. Paige liked Share A Lot the best because she's purple. It was fun talking to her about the different characters and who she liked and didn't and why.

Care Bears Totally Sweet Adventures was a fun blast from the past for me and is a new beloved DVD with love able characters for my daughter.",1369785600,4,1156,4.516746411483253
5495176,3,B00ARWXFBC,"This new CGI animated series based on the well-known cartoon characters the Care Bears is good and has important messages and morals for the children it's aimed at, but it's also a bit to childish and immature for my tastes. It can be a bit cheesy at times, but I really enjoy the characters, all of whom are very likable, and yes that included Grumpy. They are also very cute, especially Share Bear. A great series for kids, but not really my thing.",1368230400,2,450,4.433734939759036
5495177,3,B00ARWXFBC,"It's not bad - my daughter likes it. BUT, I was kind of bummed to see that ALL the Care Bears aren't represented in the episodes. I like that it seems to be the ""same"" type of Care Bear from The Big Wish movie (the cartoons scare her), but really, among 4 episodes, they couldn't include more than like 6 of the same Care Bears again & again? Bummer.

UPDATE: I looked on the Care Bears website, and it looks like the ""new"" version of the Care Bears ONLY includes the ones shown in these episodes. Double bummer. The majority of the original bears are gone. Cheer, Funshine, Tenderheart & Grumpy are the only ones left. :( Oh well.",1368144000,,631,4.302521008403361
5495178,5,B00ARWXFBC,"I grew up knowing the Care Bears when I was young, and I remember the original series when it was out, I believe, in the 1980s. Now it is fun for me to be able to see my girls enjoying the same series (with some definite differences in art and computer graphics) that I remember from being young. This DVD was a lot of fun and brought out most of the main characters that my daughters already knew and put them into a fun storyline that the whole family can enjoy. My youngest daughter's favorite part of the DVD was just a sing-along that was a part of the DVD, which I found to be funny because she also seemed to really enjoy the actual plot of the story itself. All-in-all this was a fun DVD for the whole family and shares some great messages about things like friendship, caring and teamwork - all things that I want my daughters to learn!
