7945391,3,B00005MEVP,"This sounds like the premise for another series entitled ""Acapulco H.E.A.T."" and ran for two or three years. I enjoyed that show.  Amazon sells the complete series or just Season 1 and Season 2.  I have never seen Season 3 by itself although I think there was a Season 3.",1359849600,,271,4.4
7945392,4,B00005MEVP,I got the movie cause Jeff Kaake was in it. Thinking that wahoo I finally got something good. But I wouldn't give an A+. It's mostly a B cause we'll the action isn't at all real,1350172800,,177,3.9444444444444446
7945393,2,B00005MEVP,"DREAM TEAM is the pilot for a television (READ: no nudity) show about three beautiful but dangerous, action-hero type women who form a... I don't know, what are all of these things?  ""Super team,"" I guess, to fight bad guys while pretending to be a modeling / marketing / promotions firm.  Not the worst idea in the world, but this movie is just not executed all that well.  The action isn't all that exciting, the girls aren't all that likable, and the villain isn't all that charismatic.  You can see why this didn't catch on and become a success.  I got this because I was curious about the show, whose premise I liked, but... no.  I don't remember anybody of note being in the production credits, though the cast boasts Martin Sheen.  Girls look great, but they don't even do anything sexy, so... no.",1280880000,7,804,4.541666666666667
7945394,3,B00005MEVP,"A thinly disguised Charlie's Angels Rip off made for cable and turned into a shortlived series.
The girls are gorgeous, the guys are gorgeous, so there is something to stare at, but the plot, direction, and acting is a yawner.  An excuse for models posing.
Pleasant enough, but I suggest getting it used!!!
Gave it for 4 stars, and that is for McShane's performance the was the only bright spot in the acting department.",1020556800,9,420,4.675675675675675
7945395,4,B00005MEVP,"I really enjoyed this movie, the tropical location and fast paced action were great. I hope there will be more movies like this one, maybe even sequels. I didn't see the TV show, but would like to order those when they become available.",1007769600,5,236,4.511627906976744
