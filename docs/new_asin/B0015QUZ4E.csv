3146807,5,B0015QUZ4E,"A brilliant show, way up there with The Dick Van Dyke Show, Cosby, Rocky and Bullwinkle, Seinfield and West Wing.  The original stories were clever and charming in a unique way.  The TV show captured the spirit and style very well, and the beautiful artwork was consistently represented.  Windom was brilliant in it, somehow expressive and understated all at once.  Can't wait to see it on DVD.",1341878400,10,394,4.835820895522388
3146808,5,B0015QUZ4E,"Like The Westerner, Slattery's People, East Side/West Side. He and She and a few others, this is a wonderful TV show that suffered a premature death. Literate, whimsical. unsentimental and superbly acted, My World And Welcome To it was a favorite show of my youth. It was a pioneering blend of live-action and animation, and one of the few shows for adult people. PLEASE...like Slattery's People, Like The Westerner., like a half dozen others, RELEASE THIS ON DVD!",1315958400,24,464,4.961538461538462
3146809,5,B0015QUZ4E,"""My World and Welcome to It"" was the sort of show that required a bit of wisdom to appreciate, not high education or heightened intelligence, just wisdom (something notably absent in Burbank--Money? Yes. Babes? Yes. Drugs and booze? Probably. Wisdom? Well...). Thurber's work keyed off average people and everyday life. The sort of life that moves in a predictably straight hum-drum way that can include finding a seal (or is it a sea lion?) in one's bed. In one episode, ""Seal in the Bedroom,"" Windom's character hands in just such a cartoon. His editor, Hamilton Greely (well played by Harold J. Stone), has no problem with the cartoon except...the whiskers just aren't quite right somehow. From there it takes on a life of its own. Anyone who has worked in the creative field will recognize the situation; which may explain why the suits at NBC didn't ""get it.""

If a DVD of ""My World and Welcome to It"" and its 26 episodes does eventually show up, grab it before some nincompoop cancels it again.",1296432000,19,1000,4.747126436781609

With all the other inconsequential shows that have been brought to video and DVD, why not this one? Here we have quality writing and acting. I have seen a couple of episodes on YouTube and the passage of time has not altered or diminished the humor and wit of the writings of James Thurber, and the genius of Melville Shavelson and Sheldon Leonard. Please, please, please find a way to bring this show back to us who love and treasure it.",1289433600,19,535,4.36

I am anxious to be able to purchase a DVD or Blue Ray of this series.

William Windom accepts the award, and without batting an eye, says, ""I'd like to thank NBC for taking us off the air."" Then he walks off. A classic moment in television history, and a classic embarrassment for NBC. This embarrassment ranks right up there with the cancellation of Star Trek.",1241049600,42,457,4.518072289156627
3146815,5,B0015QUZ4E,This is a wonderful series based on the cartoons of James Thurber.  William Windom is the cartoonist with a studio in his attic and a fantastic imagination.  Thurber cartoons become animated as his thoughts wander.  His daughter is a wonderful foil for his curmudgeonly nature.  Very highly recommended.,1237334400,37,303,5.25

3146817,5,B0015QUZ4E,"If my memory serves me well, 'My World and Welcome To It' was the only show that exhibited real life and a hint of intelligence. William Windom played the perfect husband and father who told it like it is. Seeing the humor in your family and the ironies is nothing to be ashamed of. Love and caring can still exist, very well portrayed in this series. I couldn't believe it was taken off the air. Perhaps the public was bothered by the honesty. What a shame! I hope they make a DVD sometime in the future.",1417737600,8,505,4.270833333333333
3146818,5,B0015QUZ4E,"Having read so much of Thurber's terrific tales, I was dumbfounded by how great this TV show was.  William Windom was perfect in, oh, so many ways.

Then the predictable happened.  For whatever reason the powers at NBC cancelled the show after all to brief a life.  UGH.

Hey, Hollywood.  Why not revive this great show.  The writing is all there, laid out for you.  The original series can be virtually copied word for word.  Get the right cast and off you go.  Guaranteed hit.  Much better than the endless ""unscripted"" (ha, ha) junks and zillions of murder shows thrown at us.  How about some real quality for a change.

As a matter of fact, I bet PBS would be a wonderful place to make this happen.",1409443200,11,702,4.433070866141732
3146819,5,B0015QUZ4E,"Ditto here. When it was showing, I too looked forward to it each week.  A warm and intelligent extraordinary show and if it comes to DVD I will certainly get my copy.",1402617600,7,166,4.1875
3146820,5,B0015QUZ4E,"Who do you have to bribe, cajole or murder to get DVD's made of this wonderful show? There never has been nor will there ever will be anything like it on TV because there never has been nor will there ever be a humorist like James Thurber. Those who are not aware of this very clever writer will never know what they have missed. What better way to bring Thurber's whimsy to them than this brilliantly acted TV tribute to his writing.

The show is true to his words and ideas. The actors are those I could visualize when I read his stories even before I ever saw any of them. What a wonderful series this would be today as a respite from all the copycat sitcoms on TV where with little exception, characters in series are interchangeable.

I fervently wish that someone would please put the original show on DVD. Amazon, you are now dabbling in such media, you have an audience, are you listening?",1400889600,14,897,4.397590361445783

For some reason, we both started reminiscing about ""My world"" and how much we loved it as older children.  It was so much smarter than the TV competition of the day, way ahead of its time.  We'd love to show our adult children that we had smarter TV influence than Gilligan's Island.

3146824,5,B0015QUZ4E,"With the recent passing of William Windom there could be no better way to remember him and pay tribute to his career then to finally release ""My World And Welcome To It"". I first became aware of William Windom from his starring role on this wonderful little sit-com. The series was so different from any other TV show on the air at that time. At a time when TV sit-coms were dominated by shows like ""Beverly Hillbillies"", ""Gilligan's Island"", ""Green Acres"" and such (and before anyone gets upset let me say I use to watch those mentioned shows and loved them as much as anyone else) ""My World"" offered something that none of those other sit-coms could offer. It was a combination of wit and imagination. Of course a lot of that came from the writings of the great James Thurber that the show was based on. Thurber through his writing had a knack for looking at the most mundane or particular aspects of everyday life and bring out the humor in all of it.

Just about all of the episodes if not all of them were based on the short stories and writings of Thurber with Windom in the lead part. One of the things that made the show stand out as being so different was the use at times of animation along with live action to help tell the stories. That was pretty much unheard of in sit-coms at that time. I also think a lot of people didn't get the subtle humor of ""My World"", especially the executives at NBC and that's why the show was cancelled after only one season. Problem was while the execs at NBC didn't get it there were many out the in homes everywhere who did get it and were faced with the frustration with the cancellation of a truely unique show.

Why the show has not been released yet on a box set I don't know. A good possibility is there is some legal tie up that needs to be iron out between the survivors of the series and/or their families and the studio before the show can be released. We can only hope that it will be worked out. If it ever is and the show gets released on DVD then we all who remember this gem of program need to get out there and purchase the series. This will be a wonderful addition to anyone's film collection. While I would hope if it is ever released that the set would include some great extra features at this point I would just be happy to see the series out on disc.",1345593600,12,2316,4.249433106575964
