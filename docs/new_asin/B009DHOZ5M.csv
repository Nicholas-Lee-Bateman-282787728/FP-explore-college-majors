5320088,5,B009DHOZ5M,This arrived very quickly and was excactly as described.  It is a European bluray and does not play on North America machines.  Keep this in mind.  I have a player for this and so was prepared.  It is an excellent disc and the delivery was perfect.,1373241600,,248,4.326086956521739
5320089,5,B009DHOZ5M,"I have had the distinction of seeing various staged presentations of Jesus Christ Superstar that range from Broadway revivals to dinner theater presentations. For the most part, the staged versions have adhered to the time period in which the events unfolded historically. With that being said, there have always been hints of the contemporary strewn throughout, Be it a giant inflatable Jesus blowing up on the stage, or paparazzi flashing cameras at Christ.

This new version though takes the story and sets it firmly in the present amidst a political backdrop that references church scandals, Occupy Wall Street, and even pop culture phenoms like Pop/American Idol.

The performances in this show are hit and miss with Tim Minchin's portrayal of Judas easily stealing the show. Ben Forester's Jesus lacks the vocal chops to successfully pull of the powerhouse notes in the showstopper Gethsemane.

The stunt casting of Mel C in the role of Mary Magdalene may look good on a playbill,but her hoarse and flat affect delivery of ""I don't Know How to Love Him"" and ""Everything's Alright"" left these numbers feeling cold and distant.

Still, this is a great production of an amazing show and is not to be missed.

As other US reviewers have pointed out, this particular blu ray is encoded for the UK. I am lucky to have a region free player and was able to enjoy the show in all its high-def glory. It looks and sounds amazing.

I am not sure when the US will get a proper release of this film, hopefully soon so that more people this side of the Atlantic can enjoy this rock spectacular filmed live at the O2 arena.",1367452800,4,1614,4.746428571428571

It will play on your computer or laptop, or just HDMI cable it to your big screen TV. This is a mind blowing exciting version produced by Weber himself the way he thought it should be done. The performers and choreography are first class. This sell out show was performed in 12,000 seat arenas at $121 a ticket. This is, in my opinion, the best presentation of this event ever.",1355961600,17,493,4.428571428571429
5320092,5,B009DHOZ5M,"Please note, the region encoding for this is B/2.  That means it is viewable in the European region, NOT the US!  It's a great show, but a little difficult if you can't watch it.  They should include this warning when they post it for sale.",1355529600,40,240,4.288888888888889
5320093,5,B009DHOZ5M,"Big fan of all the well known versions.  Loved the 1973 movie.  Saw the 2000 revival on Broadway live.  And I LOVE this version as well.  Everything that makes JCSS such a great experience is here.  Unique and powerful Judas, conflicted and complicated Jesus, great energy from the band, etc.  I was thrilled with Mel C performance as Mary as well.  The motif of the modern businessmen and the props for Pilate as an English judge, etc were fantastic.  It goes to show the power of what I have read Ted Neeley talk about with JCSS.  When you portray Jesus as this human, it allows people to connect and understand him more.  If anything it strengthens the spiritual ties. Great way to start passion week.",1522108800,,704,4.56

5320098,5,B009DHOZ5M,"I can't get over how good a staging this is. I've seen so many versions of this show, each radically different, but I was totally sold on this by the time they got to Heaven On Their Minds. It's a modern take, not in the way-too-artsy sense but in the totally-relevant-you-know-what-they're-getting-at sense.",1521072000,,308,4.9423076923076925
5320099,5,B009DHOZ5M,"Loved this version. We are big fans of Tim Minchin and really bought it to see his performance - and of course it was incredible. However, we were very pleasantly surprised by other performances. Especially surprising to us was the performance of Melanie C (formerly of the Spice Girls). We were never particular fans of the Spice Girls, but found her voice, acting and performance amazing. Several of the other supporting roles were very good, but were picked for their stage presence and performance but not necessarily for perfect singing. Plus they are singing live in a stadium.

The first 15 minutes or so give you an impression that they changed the play to be solely about Capitalism [bad] versus Anarchy/Occupy-Wall-Street [good]. However, as the performance moves forward, it becomes much more nuanced and interesting.",1520380800,,828,5.133333333333334

5320101,5,B009DHOZ5M,"I began viewing this video through Prime a few nights ago, but didn't get too far into it. I decided to revisit and finish watching, and whoa! am I glad I did!!

I had always been turned off by the campy 70's motion picture, though even cows ""mooing"" the score would be better than that miscarriage of justice.

With THIS adaptation, I've found my ""Superstar""! The entire vehicle is like a locomotive-picking up steam-more & more, as it goes. I had to 'rewind' ""Herod's Song"" & ""Superstar"" twice, as I would go out on a limb and rank them as two of the best stagings of ANY live (Musical) performances.

The entire Cast complimented each other superbly, with no 'weak links'. I cannot recommend this ENOUGH to any fan of just damn good -> music, performers, ALW followers, & theater/concert aficionados all!",1519948800,,807,4.669014084507042

5320117,3,B009DHOZ5M,"It's certainly preferable to the appaling Johnny Farnham Aussie version from the 90's but there are planty of flaws in this recent UK version.
Chris Moyles stunt casting is horrible and annoying, and Forster struggles horribly with the high notes, fixing his voice into some kind of manic, tortured squeak rather than the stirring guttural screams of Ian Gillan or Ted Neeley. Minchin is good although at times it's obviously his vocals have been either fixed in post or he's simply lip synching the more energetic parts. Mel C (with her strangely prophetic crucifix tatt) is excellent as is Hanson and all the Jewish Priests. Unfortunately Spano looks like the bad guy from The Incredibles and is impossible to take seriously. Overall is spectacular & flashy and the staging overpowers the music which is a shame. Treat yourself to the 1973 instead.",1504656000,,850,4.992957746478873

What I saw was Mary Magdalene in combat boots, a leather jacket and multicolored dreadlocks with feathers in them! Really?! It was terrible. She had on so much makeup, she'd need a hammer and chisel to take off. they updated it so much that it was unrecognizable.

5320125,3,B009DHOZ5M,"I was a little surprised that the casting of all the major roles didn't obviously include people of color.  Given that the translation to modern times would seem to necessitate more racial diversity, it seems like a MAJOR oversight.

Ironically, the actor playing Jesus has so little charisma that you find yourself rooting for Judas who is played more as the wild outsider that would have served better as Jesus.  I couldn't escape the unfortunate association that Jesus was Jimmy Fallon in a wig.  Additionally, his voice isn't as earthy and soulful as one might expect from Jesus.  Rather, it would be more at home in a boy band.  While I've never been a huge fan of Ted Neeley as Jesus, this Jesus seems like a whiny, trust fund baby, art student who is getting off hanging in the bad part of town.  When things start to go sour, you do get a bit of a perverse, ""Oh, well!"" feeling.

The staging is clever and with the video screen feels very contemporary and distracts from the claustrophobia of having the entire thing staged on steps.",1488585600,,1041,4.589189189189189
5320126,5,B009DHOZ5M,"I'm torn on this, because we absolutely loved this performance.  Ben Forster's portrayal of Jesus is incredible; he positively nailed Gethsemane! In fact, after watching it once we immediately backed it up to watch that scene over again; it was that good. Tim Minchin did well as Judas, although we still prefer Jerome Pradon's version.  Although Minchin's version of Jesus Christ Superstar was excellent and redeemed what we thought was a somewhat flat performance.

Melanie C's Mary Magdalene was very well sung and we liked Alexander  Hanson's Pilate much,  much more than Fred Johanson from the Glen Carter version, although I also like Barry Dennen's portrayal from the original movie.

This version humanized Jesus more, especially during Gethsemane, which Forster sang as a son racing at his father rather than an acolyte raging at an overlord as the Glen Carter and Ted Neeley rendition did. A key line was changed,  from ""God, thy will is hard.  You hold every card,"" to ""God, thy will is done; take your only son."" It was a very slight change but it totally altered the relationship-- From being a Messiah, Jesus became a son trying to please his father.

The only criticism regarding the performance,  other than Minchin's flat portrayal, is that the characters just didn't seem to connect with each other but were all performing independently.  One of the strengths of the Glen Carter version was the interplay between all of the characters,  especially Judas and Jesus.

I could easily give this a 5 star review, however,  we put the DVD in to watch it for only the second time, and it skipped so badly that it was unwatchable.  We took it out and cleaned it to no avail.  We are outside the window for returning it,  so we are left with an absolutely wonderful version of Jesus Christ Superstar that is completely unwatchable.  So how should I rate this?

I'm giving it 5 stars anyway,  because the performance itself was fantastic.  To penalize the content because the medium was defective doesn't seem fair.  But I am flagging the title so others can be aware that it is possible there might be other defective DVD's out there.",1488067200,3,2143,4.829670329670329

5320130,4,B009DHOZ5M,"This production is quite good, however, I was a bit disappointed at a few of the cast choices.  The set does not change and it tends to get a bit boring at times.  The 2000 ""stage-movie"" performance is much better.",1484092800,,214,4.325
5320131,5,B009DHOZ5M,"Jesus Christ Superstar is one of my favorite musicals, and certainly my favorite of Webber's shows. This production is incredible - there wasn't a single cast member I didn't like. I was particularly fond of Ben Forster and Tim Minchin, in the roles of Jesus and Judas, respectively. They played off of one another extremely well. Ben's rendition of ""Gethsemane (I Only Want to Say)"" was definitely the best number in the performance, in my opinion. I played it back a few times, not only because I was in such awe of not only the vocals (which were astounding), but also because of Ben's acting choices. I'd never seen anyone play Jesus so angry in that scene before, but I truly enjoyed it. In general, the story lent itself well to the modernization. I laughed so much during Herod's Song (I won't spoil it for anyone, but this is probably my new favorite performance of that song), and just... ugh, I can't recommend this production enough. Superstar the way it was always meant to be performed: in a rock and roll arena, with a fantastic cast and a live rock band.",1483920000,3,1069,4.602094240837697
5320132,4,B009DHOZ5M,"So, overall this is a good interpretation of the original two-disc concept album in September 1970.  The Actor Playing Jesus is certainly no Ian Gillian (from Deep Purple) and the actor playing Judas is no Murray Head.  These new actors have trouble hitting many of the notes and sustaining them.  The visuals are just ok, and the other actors do an ok job in their parts.  I don't mean to sound at all negative, the show was a lot of fun, of course I know all the songs by heart, and the choreography was good as well.  I do highly recommend this to everyone, of all ages, you will enjoy it.

5320143,5,B009DHOZ5M,"Saw this as a stage show back in the 1970s.  It points up the infidel/skeptic nature of modern society, as the crowd demands that Jesus walk across a swimming pool to prove he is ""who they say he is.""  But to me, the highlight of the show was the plight of Judas--because caused by God to betray Christ yet condemned by God to everlasting hell for doing so. This is a show we should all watch frequently.",1482105600,,404,4.233766233766234

Loved the production set in this film, but the singing could have been a lot better and was the big disappointment for me.  A lot of the singers didn't seem to bring any life to the music with a lack of vibrato, range, and feeling.  Wasn't the worst production, but close.",1481932800,,351,4.057971014492754

5320155,5,B009DHOZ5M,"This review is for the Jesus Christ Superstar Live Arena Tour [Blu-ray].  I purchased this for my girlfriend who is very much into musicals and theatre.  She loves this musical in particular.  She said this is one of the best performances she has ever seen of this musical and is in her rotation of Blu-rays that she watches.  We have a great home theater setup with some awesome surround sound speakers and this musical takes full advantage of both the superb picture quality and audio quality.  We did get the multi-format version so she can also watch it on ultra violet on the go from her iPad or iPhone and laptop.  Adding the ultra violet version was very simple and she had it in her account in less than a 5 minutes.  If there is someone in your circle of family or friends who enjoys musicals and theatre then this Blu-ray is a must own.  This makes a great gift for birthdays, christmas, holidays etc.  If they will not use the digital copy for themselves then you are essentially getting two for the price of one and you can use the digital copy for yourself or to give to another friend or family member.  The are some scenes that may be not suitable for small children so viewer discretion is advised.  I will most certainly be buying this again for some other friends of mine who I know will enjoy not only the great performances but the amazing quality of the blu-ray itself.",1473552000,,1390,4.454545454545454
5320156,5,B009DHOZ5M,"I wasn't sure about this because it is a restaging of the recently updated (Y2K) stage show revival of this classic. This production is very simple and is not as ""heavy"" or broad in staging as the version that aired in the US on PBS. Once.

I'm divided on the performances. This is a more adoring direction choice for the players and Jesus' character is a bit more subdued yet direct than in the Gale Edwards production, though the staging itself is extremely simple but effective. I've seen many minimalist productions on stage and this is not ultra-stripped down, but it's pretty simple: A very large, high riser steps setup that is adjustable is able to provide depth and space for action without much in the way of props or set dressing. Very cleverly done, the lighting is good and most of the perspective you have as a viewer is more as a member of the audience in front of which this was recorded.

I would have made some other choices for audio, but it's all live, not really anything done in post beyond the mix and all that normal stuff for live recordings. I detected no adr or redubbed music.

A bit distractingly, especially considering this was a British audience, was the reaction to a couple of players as they came on stage. I was hoping to not have any of that nonsense in a UK production in front of a UK audience. Ah, well.

The soundtrack is well done though I would have mic'd the performers differently, but I'm picky like that. You are definitely aware that this is a stage show.

This production is not dripping with the dread and doom of the Edwards production and, for some reason, I could not find myself as emotionally invested in what I was seeing as with the Edwards production, but the soundtrack is terrific.

Some people greatly prefer this version, some, like myself, prefer the Edwards version. I think they are both similar in some ways (orchestration, for example, some stage direction) but are very different stylistically and the characters are played quite differently.

I'm sure that in another ten years, there will be yet another good new production, though I think it's worth pointing out that Sir Andrew Lloyd Weber himself was ""all up in this jam"" and that this production involves many of the details HE had envisioned even back in the original run nearly 50 years ago.

This is shot in video, not on film, so it's very clean looking. That may be part of what I don't like about this, I don't know. Overall, well done and you may prefer it to the other versions. Worth getting, especially at this price, for your collection.",1472256000,,2572,4.588235294117647

It is not set in the first century, but some time more contemporary, and the scene in which Herod questions Jesus, ""I only want to know"", is a great parody of Caesar Flick in the ""Hunger Games"" videos.

I love it because it shows the humanity of all the characters involved in the the story.  This version loses everything good about the music and the story.  By making Jesus and his followers ""Occupy Wall Street"" protesters,turning the Council into ""academics"", Herod into a game show host, and Pilate into... a guy in a suit with no identity, the story loses all context.  Yes, I know it is all allegorical, but why take a historical drama and turn it into a modern allegory.  Jesus was not protesting the economy of Jerusalem or even challenging Rome.  This version of the story is so twisted that I do not think that person familiar with the story of the last few days of Jesus would have any idea what of significance of what they were seeing, who the character were, and why they are doing what they are doing.  I will say this, however, the two guys that sing Judas and Jesus are excellent rock singers.  Musically, I think this is a good production.  Visually it is impressive.  A mess, but an impressive mess.",1459209600,,1166,4.5311004784688995

5320179,3,B009DHOZ5M,Different interpretation than ALW original intention to tell the story of Christian movement from Judas' perspective as the protagnonist that facilitates the prophecy. ALW envisions  Jesus as more a supporting character and catalyst but not the main character. This arena production pits Jesus and Judas against each other ignoring the complex dynamics between them to fulfill God's promise to send a Messiah.,1453075200,,409,5.596774193548387
5320180,2,B009DHOZ5M,"I am a huge fan of this rock opera. I've watched many filmed and live renditions. This one was disappointing.

The ideas and route this production took had a lot of promise, and I was originally excited to see how they modernized the idea. But the acting was some if the most uninspired I've ever seen. It was all one note. I didn't feel any of Judas' anguish and pain. Jesus did a great job at Gethsemane, but at that point, it meant nothing as he portrayed the character as a pompous jerk up until that point. I loved the idea of portraying Herod as a talk show host type, but that had no excitement or sense of fun. Mary sang beautifully, but you never fully understand the many sides of her personality. Plus the whole sexual tones between her and Jesus missed the mark completely.

I don't recommend this. If you want to see a more genuine and deeper version, get the 2000 one.",1449360000,,882,4.33939393939394

The rest of the cast seemed to relish their roles as well. The only thing keeping this from being a five-star review is some IDIOT decided to autotune it. Very minor autotuning, but annoying nonetheless and completely unnecessary as everyone here can sing (why cast them otherwise?).",1434326400,,430,4.986111111111111
5320193,1,B009DHOZ5M,"I was astounded at what a lack of imagination they put on the stage.  The actor who played Judas was outstanding and had a great voice with an excellent range.  But there are so many negatives to this filmed stage musical that I hardly know where to begin.  We all know the signature song of Jesus Christ Superstar is ""I Don't Know How to Love Him"".  You need a beautiful voice to make that song meaningful.  The actress who played Mary, who sang the song, had a terrible voice.  It was raspy, off-pitch, and was such a huge disappointment.  You think in all of England they could find one actress who can sing.  There basically wasn't any choreography other than people switching positions on the steps, and walking back and forth.  It was ridiculous.  I've never directed Jesus Christ Superstar, but I have directed Godspell twice, and know there was sooo much more they could have done.  But this seemed like a full-fledged British production, which means not nearly as good as Americans would do.  There was no imagination in any sense of the word.  The most done was a few back-flips just thrown in there for something to do I suppose.  It's almost impossible to make JCS boring, but they pulled it off.  The male voices I must say were good to excellent.  The choice of the actor to play Jesus however was another disappointment.  Average voice, average acting, and didn't look anything like we would portray as Jesus.  The female voices didn't cut it.  I could go on and on, but you get the point.  Don't waste your time or money.",1434240000,2,1537,4.56043956043956

I was in my teens when the movie came out in the early seventies, and though a good movie, it lacked the great singing talent of the original soundtrack...with the exception of Yvonne Elliman of course. I've seen most of the other broadway versions since then and though some were merely ok, they certainly lacked depth in singing talents. Until Jesus Christ Superstar live arena tour came out. Who would have guessed Tim Minchin could do such a brilliant job as Judas or Melanie C play such a talented Mary? And what a find to play Jesus with Ben Forster leading the way! The acting and singing talents of this cast as well as choreography and directing has taken this 45 year old musical or ""rock opera"" to a new height.

I'm not saying it is without flaw, the most notable of these being the only somewhat talented Ben Forster who plays Jesus. Forster's ability seems to be limited to hitting high notes, but without any of the edge of Ian Gillan. However Tim Minchin as Judas and more than makes up for that and the other principle characters are also brought wonderfully to life wonderfully.

The arena stage is creative and powerful and the modern conceptualization brings the excitement to a new generation. The show literally ""rocks"", with a live rock band on stage during the performance. It hits the highs and the lows without squashing it from a ""rock opera"" to a ""pop opera"", as some other versions have done.

The modern-times staging is a nice change of pace, but isn't so radical that it takes you out of the story. A giant, wide staircase serves as the entire set, with video screens behind and musicians in the scaffolding ""wings."" Fear not, you aren't just staring at one thing as if you were at the arena---the film production cuts between long shots, close ups, and multiple-shot collages.

The music itself will always be the star of this show for me, and they are faithful to the original work (my go-to for the music is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesus-Christ-Superstar-Cast-Recording/dp/B000002OCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesus Christ Superstar Cast Recording</a>). I was never that enthusiastic about Ted Neeley in the 1973 movie as Jesus, so Ben Forster in this version was an improvement from my perspective. Great performances from everyone in the cast, really.

NOTE: I streamed this on Instant Video, with no access to the extra features. Just something to consider, as you might decide as I did that this version is a ""keeper"" to get on disc.

They had Mary M. having a thing for JC, fact or fiction, was the only part I didn't enjoy, just awkward to watch, and I'm not very religious either, not in the least bit. Fortunately, my 11 year old could watch much of it, we fast forward through the death at the end because she's sensitive, but knows the story of what happens. But, overall, I think all the performers did a GREAT job! Good to see Mel C. I can understand why the tour didn't sell well in the US, people aren't that religious, less and less people attend church, or are religious, or just not interested in Bible-based stories in a arena setting, television or film, yeah, has a wide audience.

Tim Minchin is very impressive and gut wrenching, then pithy in his delivery. It's a given that he fits the role of Judas. I could live without Mel C as Mary Magdalene, but she's not terrible, just not terribly real either. And as Jesus -- a difficult pair of sandals to be sure -- Ben Forster does a smashing job.

Christ is undone by one-dimensional acting and a complete lack of charisma, despite an ability to hit the notes (girlish shrills and all). You'd be forgiven for wanting to see him crucified sooner than later. It's not entirely their fault. The whole thing is undone by the arena setting, which demands spectacle even on the occasions that the show's book and music requires intimacy and poignancy rather than bombast. The nearly visionless director doesn't help by only knowing how to use multi-media technology to set a scene, but hasn't a clue as to how to position his actors and stage his enormous cast to optimal visual effect. Instead, he just knows how to choreograph chaos and big, bigger, biggest emotions. Buy if you're a completist or just want a chuckle at all the unintended camp and shrill performances. Otherwise, go get the brown concept album and your Bible. It's cheaper and easier on the ears.",1403654400,,978,4.862275449101796

5320310,5,B009DHOZ5M,"If you're as big a fan of Jesus Christ Superstar as I am, my guess is that the only real version that has ever satisfied you is the initial recording with Murray Head, Ian Gillan and Yvonne Elliman (the Norman Jewison film version was a grand vision, but a little clunky in the execution). Well, now you're in luck - I've come across the amazing DVD of the UK Live Arena Tour version overseen by Andrew Lloyd Weber which incorporates modern-day media and news events, and it rivals if not overtakes the original version in both style, originality and vocal chops. Tim Minchin as Judas, Ben Forster as Jesus and Melanie C as Mary Magdalene totally reinvent their roles in amazing performances which blew me away! When Melanie C started singing ""I Don't Know How to Love Him"", I almost wept with nostalgia and was touched to the soul by the beauty of her voice wrapped around that haunting melody. Let me just say that if you love Superstar as much as I do, you must get this DVD immediately!",1397865600,4,990,4.5055555555555555

Updated for the 21st Century with today's technology, modernized lingo and movement, rarely does a musical age so gracefully.  Of all the versions of this show I've seen, this one seems to most clearly present the idea of Jesus having allowed things to ""get so out of hand"", forcing an unhappy and disillusioned Judas to make the heartbreaking choice between his best friend and mentor or seeing the mission he's helped establish and been so devoted to continue.  All leads are well played, but Tim Minchin's Judas is absolutely phenomenal.  The role is just plain hard - both in emotional and vocal range, and Minchin manages to make it look easy.

5320322,4,B009DHOZ5M,"I am such a stickler for the originals, especially if they were done well with iconic performances, so I really really had my doubts on seeing this production, especially since I saw brief clips, and was caught off guard by the look of the actors not set in period pieces much like the Ted Neeley version. They were all dressed in modern attire, I'm thinking I really have to sit down and watch this.
The first thing is the score, the beloved masterpiece score was cradled with affection for the true genius that it is, and performed with much gusto by the singers, dancers, and actors. There was no liberal let down, I was truly impressed. The matter of dress can be dealt with when you figure that parallels are being delivered to modern society and what it would look like if the ancient corporate honchos of yesterday would look like today, as well as the peasants and followers of Christ. All in all, the energy was there, I am impressed. In many ways it's sort of the Michael Jackson ""This Is It"" tour that never had a chance, finally come to pass in the JCS mode, fancy back drops and all!",1396742400,,1096,4.430693069306931
5320323,4,B009DHOZ5M,"My title for my review is a nod to the fact that noted Spice Girl, Melanie C, was given the plum role of the female lead, Mary Magdalene (in Scripture, Christ's closest female disciple who witnessed the Crucifixion and was the first to see and speak to Him after the Resurrection).  I might add, she acquits herself quite well, dreds and tattoos and all, as do the rest of the cast.

This is an ultra-modern inerpretation of the Biblical story, with up-to date references and technolgy.  Jesus and his followers are portrayed as gnarly-looking young protest-everything types, while the Sanhedrin (the court of Jewish priests that ultimately captured Jesus, turned Him in to Rome, and had Him crucified by the Romans) are suit-and-tie types.  Herod is portrayed as the host of a cheezy talk show who, after his musical number, invites his viewers to text their vote as to whether or not Jesus is the Son of God.  The scene in which Jesus drives out the ""moneychangers"" has the feeling of decadence and corruption, with scantily clad male and female dancers, the kind of thing that would have driven Him to that level of anger.  During the flogging/Crucifixion scenes, Jesus wears not a loincloth but a modern orange prison jumpsuit.

For all this, the story remains reverent to the original source material, if it does not explicitly depict the Resurrection, thereby stating definitively that Jesus was/is Son of God.  The actor/singer playing Jesus is particularly effective in his ""Gethsemane"" number and as he hangs on the Cross for his final moments.  Tim Minchin, the actor playing Judas, is also worth an honorable mention, especially for his performance leading up to the moment his character hangs himself (which is very powerfully portrayed).

All in all, if you are open to a fresh but still respectful depiction of the Biblical story of Jesus the Christ, and you appreciate the musical rock-opera score, this is worth adding to your collection.  A nice alternative to the usual Bibical epics that one commonly finds during the Passover/Lent/Easter seasons.

Enjoy.  Cheers.",1395705600,,2083,5.0028985507246375

I really had no expectations of this show except that I had hoped the music that I remembered from the 1973's version would still be good. It was. I also choose it because I like musicals/broadway type productions. Visually it was excellent. I loved it! As soon as I watched it a 2nd time I knew I had to buy it. Cast was great! It was a modern version linking the media into the Christ story. It is perfect way for people to remember the basic story and not get bogged down by all the small details. Tim Minchin as Judas HAD A VERY COOL LOOK. The energy he put into the performance and his voice was great. Ben Forester was great as Jesus. Very good ending. I like how the character of Mary Magdalene was portray by Melanie C.  Over all Webber did a superb job of putting it back into an arena show. I have since passed this movie around to friends to watch and discuss what they think. So far they all enjoyed the movie as well. Watch it. jj",1394064000,,1055,4.2227722772277225
5320328,5,B009DHOZ5M,After seeing multiple live and filmed versions ...this one stands out due to the authentic version of the score. Everyone sings and plays the music the way its supposed to be. Tim Minchin as Judas (Californication) is a pleasant revelation and sings beautifully. Ben Forster (the winner of the UK Television competition) really acts the part. He won the show due mostly to the high notes he could hit and he delivers the rock shriek where needed. Mel C from the Spice Girls sings a perfect Everything's Alright and I Don't Know How To Love Him. Highly recommend this return to JC Superstar.,1393977600,,590,4.737864077669903
5320329,5,B009DHOZ5M,"As a fan of the original cast recording, I enjoyed the movie version for it's take on a classic but it never quite did it for me although it has its moments.  This Arena Concert version, produced by Andrew Lloyd Weber, is JCS as he intended it to be.  The voices are similar to those in the original cast, and I especially enjoyed Caiaphas' resonating baritone, with every note hit to perfection.  The roles of both JC and Judas are sung true to the originals.  The production uses a modern backdrop for the story, and the religious aspects are homogenized somewhat, but for me its really the music that counts and this version is very strong in that respect.  This is a recording of a arena/stage show, which was fun to watch as I'd never seen the musical stage version.",1393632000,3,771,4.478571428571429

5320337,5,B009DHOZ5M,"This was an extraordinary production of Jesus Christ Superstar. It had a very good design and amazing execution. Everything about the production felt very real and modern. I know some people probably dislike the modernization and prefer the biblical versions with modern or 1970s elements, but I felt the modernization added to and updated the story for an audience that might not otherwise see this show unless they were already musical theatre fans.

I also thought the cast was wonderful too. Ben Forster's Jesus is done very well vocally and was also very good acting-wise. I know some people felt his Jesus lacked charisma, but I was very happy with his performance. Tim Minchin does an amazing job as Judas. The only real problem with his performance was that the audio editor thought that Minchin needed a heavy dose of auto-tune to help with his pitch. Tim Minchin is a very talented performer, and all of the pitchy, screechy moments were just artistic choices to help convey emotion, and doing that is especially effective for the role of Judas. Mel C did very well as Mary Magdalene. She didn't give the absolute best rendition of ""I Don't Know how to Love Him,"" but it was still very good and it was the right way to go about singing it for this production.

Overall, this was an amazing experience, and I highly recommend buying it.",1390608000,,1345,4.743589743589744

5320349,3,B009DHOZ5M,"OK the music and singing was very good. Of course one does expect a somewhat worldly view of the gospel going in. But the most ultra-important thing of all, Jesus' resurrection, was just left out. In this rendition, Jesus dies horribly and then a minute later walks out on the stage with Judas who had hung himself, as if they were some kind of co-equals!
Also We know Jesus had both a human and divine nature, and he had to resolve these two natures within himself. However Jesus knew who he was and what his purpose was and there surely was an assurance and confidence in the man. Therefore it is incorrect to portray him, as was done by this particular actor and director, as so angry, and this to me, anyway, detracts in no small way from the musical performance.",1387238400,,767,4.446808510638298

Since the first time I heard the brilliant score of Andrew Lloyd Webber and the equally brilliant lyrics of Tim Rice, this rock opera has remained at the top of my list of inspirational music and has always seemed to be there when times were bad for me. I loved the original Broadway recording, the Norman Jewison film, have starred as Jesus in a private production myself, and went to see the the live theatrical shows featuring Ted Neely as Christ at least five times. I wanted to be as openly minded about this new version as I could and gave it my undivided attention throughout the playing of the DVD without voicing too many opinions until I could form what I would consider a fair representation of my feelings of this rendition.

I'm not a big fan of remakes or reboots of movies or shows, and most of the time I feel that an artists work should reflect the times of its inception, and was not too impressed with the settings of this show.  I can appreciate the cell phones, tablets, three piece suits and other modern trinkets which reflect the modern way of life, but when you depend on the characters to pull the show, this is where I found this performance to fall very short.  Having played Jesus myself (and I never would put myself on a par with some of the brilliant performers who have played this part), I was hoping for a sterling performance out of Ben Forster's Christ.  I was greatly disappointed. His portrayal was more of a spoiled kid rather than the Prince of Peace.  At times his high notes were more of screaming than effective singing, and he severely lacked the caring and empathetic nature that would normally speak for Jesus. I found his character cold and his performance close to that of a high school kid who was trying for the part, but not successful. His climactic scene on the cross was almost laughable complete with... red confetti?. Tim Minchin as Judas started off extremely effective and I was looking forward to each of his numbers, however it seemed his rendition of the traitorous apostle continually spiraled downward until his ultimate demise (surprisingly well produced visually).  Melanie Chisholm's Mary Magdalane was spot on note wise, however again I failed to feel the empathy I was hoping to achieve from a character who was confused in her feelings for Christ, and wanted nothing more than to understand what this man was all about.  It seemed she just sang her songs, and that was about it.  When it came time for emotion, it just wasn't there.

What annoyed me the most were the smaller character parts going over the top to try and gain their few minutes of fame on the stage.  The worst was Gerard Bentall who played Annas.  It seemed every line he sang was way overly done in his hopes that his statement would be, ""hey, look at me!.""  Pete Gallager's failure at the low-singing Caiaphas was also a disappointment, where I have seen much stronger performers not only handling the low notes much more effectively, but also convey the power of the high priest. Gallager simply toddled across the stage shifting is octaves from low to high to attempt to pull the part out of the ashes.  Alexander Hanson's Pilate could have been played by anyone.  Appearing as a tennis bum fresh off the court, his talking of several lines left the part of the Procurator with much to be desired.  This was topped off by his poor efforts during the trial.  It seemed he just wanted to get through it and get back on the court.  Herod's number, attempting to be more of a TV show, was a farce.  Texting, while a major part of today's society did not belong in this performance.

The full company, when they sang in group numbers were fantastic.  Great harmony, incredible voices, and a very smooth rendition of the songs with ""Hosanna"" being the highlight of the entire show.  The live orchestration was also a great tribute to the musical score.  So often the musicians are taken for granted, and in this case, if so, they accomplished their job extremely well. I didn't care for the appearance of the guitar player before ""Damned for all Time,"" but I believe I understood the metaphor behind it.

As time marches on I guess the creators of this show figure that this work of art must change along with it.  I'm not sure why they feel this way, but as versions go, this was not the ""greatest one ever"" as many of the reviewers here may state.  It was hard to ""feel"" any emotion during this performance, and hard to mourn for a Christ who looks more like Charles Manson and fails to carry the part to where it should be.  For you die hard fans of this score as I am, give it a fair shot, but rent or download it.  I don't believe this will be one you will be viewing over and over again as I did Ted Neely's movie, or the money I spent on seeing his stage performances the many times I did.",1384819200,3,4964,4.491657397107898

5320369,5,B009DHOZ5M,"I saw Jesus Christ Superstar when it first came to Broadway in the early 1970's and was bowled over by both the production and the music. I greatly anticipated the movie (1973) but was somewhat disappointed. At that time, I did not like the addition of the modern elements to the film, but I have mellowed my aversion with age and wisdom.

The music is the thing in Superstar, one really doesn't need visuals, but they do add to the pleasure of the rock opera. On Broadway, the visuals relied upon costumes and innovative stage operations which featured a three-piece stage that rose and fell to accentuate the action. In the film, the authentic locations played the key role in the setting along with some inventive physical constructions. In Jesus Christ Superstar - Live Arena Tour the whole of the action takes place on a huge staircase with an enormous video screen in the background. As described by the set designer in the DVD extras, he chose this setting because it represents what the powerful in society have always done to express their power - build huge staircases in order to elevate themselves from the normal man.

My opinions of the setting and costumes, for me, express my maturity of thought from the time I was a man in his mid-twenties to today, a man in his late sixties for the whole production is staged in modern times against the background of political and financial unrest in Great Britain. This period is perfectly expressed in the lyrics and emotions of the score even though it is separated by more than two-thousand years from the actual events. Man is still not learning a thing from history.

Of course, for Superstar, the performance is the thing, and this arena version has extraordinary interpretations of Jesus and Judas by Ben Forster and Tim Minchin - especially Minchin. The power of their performances put this video over the top for me. The only performance I found to be lacking as opposed to the play and the movie was that of Alexander Hanson as Pontius Pilate. Hanson is an accomplished actor and certainly played the part very well, but his ""singing"" was more of spoken word accompanied by music. I remember reading somewhere that the original Broadway Pilate - played by Barry Dennen was given the additional song, ""Pilate's Dream"" that was supposed to be sung by Pilate's wife because of his impressive voice. Dennen makes the song a highlight of the play. He also reprised the part in the film. Hanson is good, but his scenes are not highlights as were Dennen's.

The arena version of Superstar is a feast of music and visuals. The cameramen and editors did an excellent job of showing the elements of the production on the television screen. It is a must see if you enjoyed the music, the play, or the movie - or as I, all of the above.",1381276800,,2789,4.662601626016261

At times painful to watch. And it's almost as if the writer had anticipated 2013. This SO works. Seriously. And contrary to naysayers, I think Tim Minchin makes a great Judas. Actually, he's the only one with any emotion, the only one who does any real acting. Is Judas a bad guy or a good guy? Without him the whole prophecy wouldn't have happened, now would it?

Yeah maybe the original was produced 40 years ago, but this version really gives the production a feeling of timeliness and depth.

I was even holding out hope that the curtain call would be the resurrection. But it puts Jesus and Judas on the same level. Disturbed thinking from the 70s, trying to get Judas off the hook. With a proper ending, this is 5 stars, easily. Without it, it is the most tragic story in the world.

5320373,5,B009DHOZ5M,"Whenever I see a Stage Musical like this, what I usually see is that not only does it run in 2 Acts, which is what THIS one does, in fact, but the length I would usually see it in would be a total of 2 hours.

This musical, present in a Live Tour Performance,  seems to run in a total of a bit less than that. A little bit over an hour, in fact. Despite that, all the songs that appear in this musical, including my most favorite, the one called ""Superstar"" are still there, and it's still, none the less, a two-act musical. And a great one at that.

I've seen movie-formatted versions of this movie, as well as Cats, Joseph, and the most popular ""Phantom of the Opera"", along with 2 movie-formatted versions of this one, including the 1970's version, and the 2000 Remake, but this version helps me to see what I always would like to see; the original stage version of a great musical, even if there is a slight change, or two.

If there is a downside, if any, it's just the fact that they don't show the Jesus's rising up into Heaven which is actually, in fact, what happened after he died on the cross.

All in all, I still like this musical, even if anyone else does not. If you like Andrew Lloyd Webber 's work, even his latest adaptation of The Wizard of Oz, then THIS musical is the one you must add to your collection.

If the big screen were not there, I expect the live audience (you know, the folks they should be performing for?) would get as much (or as little) from this with their eyes closed.

However, I do suggest watching the extra features first, mostly because of an interview with Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber in which he explains it was originally written to perform to an arena/concert size audience,wish I had. Tim Minchin has an astoundingly strong voice and range as Judas (my favorite).

Yes, yes, and yes, I recommend buying this version, if you are a JCSS and/or Tim Minchin fan.  I'm a new Minchin fan after watching his performance on Showtime at the Royal Albert Hall in London with the fabulous Heritage Orchestra.. Unfortunately, I can only find region 2 versions of his other DVDs.

You can watch many of his songs and interviews at TimMinchin.com  and YouTube.",1379462400,11,805,4.977611940298507
5320378,4,B009DHOZ5M,"I'd do 3 1/2 stars if Amazon let us do halves, but Tim Minchin largely tips the balance between pros and cons. This is not me speaking as a fan (admittedly, he is why I bought the DVD), but because as Judas is the emotional center of the play, they gave the role to by far the strongest actor and singer in the cast. Ben Forster as Jesus holds his own next to Minchin, but if the roles were reversed, the emotional weight of the characters would have been atrociously off-kilter in my opinion.

I've seen some truly amazing Herod performances in past productions and one with Dennis DeYoung from Styx as Pilate that brought that role to a whole new starring level. So perhaps the bar has been set too high for those two roles for me? Mel C - I didn't quite feel the connection between her and Forster, but she's still a great singer and takes the ""sacredness"" of the classic role seriously. The whole play remains a timeless masterpiece whose music easily translates 40+ years later.

The theme (and I say ""no spoilers"" because it is not at all a surprise, established first thing, before the music even starts) is setting the play against the backdrop of contemporary progressive, socio-political protests along the lines of the Occupy movements born in the US. Positively brilliant! As if having one of the world's most outspoken anti-theism atheists in a starring role isn't enough to hint that this isn't a play meant to bible-thump and preach religion.

Let's face it: If Jesus of the canon gospels existed as a living, historical person - the man, not the god-man, and that is explicitly what the play has always centered on - and if that person were alive in the West today, he'd be in the 99%, not the 1%. He'd be one of the protesters holding ""People before Profit"" signs, not a Republican in a business suit demonizing the poor and whining that health care is akin to Nazism.

The set theme here in that regard is brilliant; putting the Pharisees and Pilate in rich/conservative power roles against the street-demonstrators look of ""The Twelve"" and the rest of the Jesus followers. It builds well in Act I on mob mentality and how demonstrators can easily get caught up in the frenzy and lose sight of what exactly they're protesting, of holding up a cult of personality ahead of an ideal. Again; this is what the play itself has always been about. Again, absolute brilliance.

Which is why it's frustrating to see that theme dissolve throughout Act II into virtual non-existence by the end.

But then again, isn't that also an underlying theme of the play? (If you've never seen/listened to a production of Superstar before and are completely new to the play, then the rest of this review could constitute a spoiler).

Open with the populist, moderate-Christian message of power-to-the-little-people, brought to climax by ""Hosanna,"" but juxtaposed by several contradictory acts and ideals which, by the end, have the godly aspects of the Jesus story making little to no real sense. At least, that's how it always struck me as a child and, though raised Christian, I credit Jesus Christ Superstar as one of the elements in my life that always kept me questioning the faith and eventually led to my own admission that it held no more credibility than any other god-hero mythology wielded as a tool to control the masses (if a fascinatingly, frighteningly successful one). By the end of the play, as by the end of the Jesus story itself in canon scripture, it all just kind of runs out of steam and you're left trying to reconcile why forgiveness can't be just forgiveness without a blood sacrifice.

Which brings us back to the brilliance of the role of Judas as not only emotional but rational lynchpin of the play, and having that underscored about as hard as one can by putting Tim Minchin in the role. The aforementioned show I saw years ago with Dennis DeYoung as Pilate - he gave me chills in the role, bringing the social angst of the character to all new levels. Tim Minchin gives me similar chills here. You can positively see his character sussing out the contradictions in the Jesus story, connecting the dots between man and myth and painfully frustrated that no one else among the followers seems to comprehend what is right in front of them.

Bottom line: This production is well worth seeing for the brilliance of the theme through Act i and Mincin's performance throughout, even if that theme and so much of its potential to connect has fizzled out by the end.",1379030400,4,4485,4.681472081218274
5320379,4,B009DHOZ5M,"This has been my favorite rock musical since the original album was released when I was a pre-teen. I have followed most every available version since, and so picking up the blu-ray of this production was pretty nearly obligatory.

Overall I enjoyed this production, I was a little concerned early on that they were going to take huge liberties with the material because the first couple minutes were pretty heavily saturated with occupy wall st-esque graphics, but things settle down after that and they perform the show in a manner respectful of the original, with some inventive staging.

The cast was a bit of a mixed bag for me. I really enjoyed Tim Minchin (Judas), Melanie (Mary Magdalene) and the supporting cast playing Pilate, Herod, Caiaphas, Annas, etc. Where I ran into a bit of difficulty was Ben Forster's portrayal of Jesus, which just didn't connect with me personally. I know many people find him a fantastic performer, but for me he was just a little subdued and lacking the charisma to offset Minchin's Judas when they were on stage together. Let's face it, Judas gets the best lyrics, the Jesus role really needs to be carried on emotion and sincerity. For me Mr Forster just didn't bring it off. Your mileage may vary.

Immediately after finishing viewing, I got the urge to toss the 2001 DVD version in the player. While the new arena show has much to recommend it, honestly, I feel this was a superior version overall, in almost every area except of course video/audio quality.

5320381,5,B009DHOZ5M,"This staging of Jesus Christ Superstar is so fresh and powerful, it hardly seems like the same musical as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesus-Christ-Superstar-1973/dp/B002NWWHOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesus Christ Superstar (1973)</a>, the venerable and well-intentioned hippy version. Live Arena JCS is for our times, set in our time, with real-world concerns and references (texting, reality TV, One Direction, corruption among the power elite, surveillance, etc.). But it's the music that really ups this JCS's game, from a harder-edged, less strings-driven instrumentation to vocals that run a gamut from wispy and crooning to primal scream and rabid growl.

I ordered this DVD right away because I'm a big Tim Minchin fan, having seen him in concert in Minneapolis a couple of years ago and at his performance at last year's Reason Rally in Washington, D.C., and Minchin has the key role of Judas. Minchin does a terrific job with that role and gives dramatic voice to the character's ambivalence about who Jesus is and how to respond to the unfolding story.

Two slightly false notes in an otherwise sterling experience: I didn't care for the staging of King Herod's song (but to be honest, the campy, comedic song has always seemed a little intrusive given the dire events that surround it--still I've seen it done better in other stagings); and the ""Superstar"" production near the end, with Judas posing that all-important question, ""Are you who they say you are?"" to the crucified Jesus, was so glitzy and glittery with twerking angels (well--almost twerking) that the seriousness of the song's intent is easily lost.

But maybe that's OK. The effect of JCS is to humanize Jesus, and to reclaim what amounts to a kind of folk hero from theologians who seem more intent on creating finely crafted, almost algebraic, dogmas and doctrines ABOUT Jesus, than to let his story wash over them with all its power and drama. I am proudly and happily an atheist. But I have never been immune to the appeal of a person who tries to stand against the oppressors of his or her time, to identify with vulnerable people, to love and lose and feel betrayal and denial, and to courageously face an uncertain destiny with defiance and courage. Stripped of some frankly irrational and unappealing theological elements, the Jesus story presented in Jesus Christ Superstar--and especially, THIS Jesus Christ Superstar--is one for the ages.",1378944000,7,2476,5.311224489795919
5320382,5,B009DHOZ5M,"In a word, FANTASTIC!  It's easy to tear apart new interpretations of existing work simply because there's such a fondness for the original.  Gratefully, this show in particular stands up well to re-interpretation... re-imagining, if you will.

Andrew Lloyd Weber emerges from the wings after the show with a very brief speech in which he indicated he was so pleased to see his production mounted in a Rock 'n Roll arena, as it was originally intended.

In that venue this production sparkles with originality and new relevance, weaving into the story elements of current social issues and pop culture of which modern audiences will be able identify far better than bell bottoms and other 70s sensibilities.

The score, presented hear in glorious 5.1 makes use of tried and true orchestral arrangements, but also breaks ground with new rock instrumentation.  In that vein, the Overture and ""The Temple"" are true breakout scenes.

The performances are stellar!  While some vocal purists will point out technique is all over the map, this is after all, a rock opera, and the screaming/wailing is part of the idiom and lends itself perfectly to telling the story.  Tim Minchin (Judas) can place his notes, but no one will confuse him with a Bel canto vocalist.  Likewise, Ben Forster (Jesus), while clearly a superior tenor, has a strident sound and also succumbs to vocal fry, but again... the material doesn't suffer.  His version of Gethsemane (I Only Want to Say) is gut wrenching.  Bottom line the voices serve the acting, and isn't telling the story ultimately what this show is about?

Last to mention, but certainly not least is the staging.  While the filmed 2001 production with Glenn Carter makes use of scenery that evokes interior grandeur, the sets and props here are designed to create less a sense of place and space, but rather, atmosphere.  They are evocative not visually dictatorial, leaving it to the imagination to fill in the blanks.  Brilliant use of a wide staircase can be made to represent a game show set (Herod's Song), the Gardens of Gethsemane, to ultimately the barren land in which Judas flies in on what will be Jesus' crucifix.

The bottom line:  If your mind is open to the malleable nature of Jesus Christ Superstar, you will likely not be disappointed, but if you're like me, you will be blown away!",1378857600,3,2334,4.880710659898477

I recommend the interview with Andrew Lloyd Webber where he talks about this, his first major work, and how he is so happy it was produced as it was meant to be.  Spectacular.  Awesome.  You will be carried away.",1378771200,,306,4.224137931034483
5320386,5,B009DHOZ5M,"This new and MUCH improved update to Jesus Christ Superstar is amazing. Brought into today's culture, Jesus and Judas and Mary and the rest have a new resonance, a devastatingly deep connection. The vitality and talent of this cast far surpasses the original, which was good. It was a stroke of genius to cast Tim Minchen as Judas, and Ben Forster makes an absolutely perfect Jesus.",1378771200,,382,4.803030303030303
5320387,5,B009DHOZ5M,"I was really excited about this version of the musical!  I had never seen previous versions until last Summer, when I had the opportunity to go to London.  Since I love the Spice Girls (Sporty Spice Melanie C is in this version as Mary) I went to a live taping of the Jesus Christ Superstar reality show that she and Andrew Lloyd Webber were judges for.  All I can say is: WOW!

The performances to find the new Jesus were spectacular!  I've been to reality talent show tapings in the US, but this one ran like clockwork, which amazing sets moving in and out.  During the commercial breaks the audience got to ask the judges questions, and Andrew's comments were really fascinating.  He said how JCS was a huge hit in American back in the 70s, but flopped in the UK!  In the 70s it was playing arenas and hitting the top 40 with their music, but the UK never got to experience it in an arena as it was intended to be.

This production does have a new age look to it, but you get that same arena experience that the author intended it to play in.  The songs are really incredible, and Melanie does a fantastic job with all of her parts!  For fans of the old version: of course that's better!  It's the original!  But this version truly made a fan out of me and I know it would be a great version to introduce to a new generation, as it appeals more to things going on now (like a feeling of social revolt against corporations) and is visually and musically stunning!",1378512000,11,1465,4.283636363636363
5320388,3,B009DHOZ5M,I would just like to point out to an earlier review that JCS is a rock opera and has no dialogue. I'm sure this is the complete production.,1377907200,2,139,4.0
5320389,1,B009DHOZ5M,"I just watched the UK release version on Blu ray. Granted: Picture and sound are perfect! The dialogues have been reduced to an absolute minimum leaving just one song after another. Apparently wanting to get a more ""hip"" audience the story has been modernized to a Grunge/Punk look which is too cliche to put in words. We get the whole ""industry vs the people"" thing, but its just been put too much into black and white for me.

 The voices, all good, but on the whole hard to listen and watch for the whole concert. If you don't know the story, it gets a bit confusing without the dialogue to keep the story together. Its a matter of taste, I guess, but the cast is also on the verge of nerve-wrecking. Mel C is surpisingly good as the role of maria, but due to the lack of story, goes almost unnoticed. Jesus himself is the blandest of the characters and the role of Judas (tim minchin) gets soooooo ""uber-rock-voice-high-pitch"" that i had to fast forward a lot of his scenes just to get through the Blu ray.
Overall: For hardcore JCS fans...go ahead...you know the story and this is something different and expectations are different for everyone.
For musical newcomers: Skip this.",1377820800,6,1184,4.580188679245283
5320390,1,B009DHOZ5M,"After watching this once. I didn't even bother sending it back. I simply threw it into the dustbin. The cast is the most unattractive, untalented and marginally singing group I've ever seen perform this production.

The producer of this tour seems to want to make a political statement rather than produce a quality, entertaining piece of work. I can't express in words how bad the singing is, not to mention the bad lighting and all of the issues with the crappy set.

Do not buy this version. Stick to one of the other video versions! Please!!!",1377734400,9,546,4.677083333333333
5320391,5,B009DHOZ5M,"I just watched my Hong Kong, Area 1 version of this blu-ray and it is spectacular in sight and sound. If you wanted to see Jesus Christ Superstar as a stage production,this is the one you have got to buy. The sound is DTS 5.1 HD and the vocals and music score are first rate. This was recorded LIVE onstage and watching the show and stage work is spectacular,not simple or cheesy looking. Universal is the producer and they made a definite 10 on a scale of 1-10 for both sight and sound on this work! Too bad their movie version of the sound wasn't this good. IF you just like the music only,go ahead and get this disc and enjoy anyway! some little extra stage action is added by the actors and helps the situation seem real. Don't try to compare this show with the movie version,there both different in style.",1373673600,19,810,4.3355263157894735

8540304,3,B009DHOZ5M,"I have four versions of JC. I so wanted to see this while it was touring, however the producers found the production costs v ticket revenues unsustainable. It would have been an experience.

Of all of the versions I have this however is my lease favorite. The actor playing Judas is the weakest I've ever seen , and since he's the main player it distracts from the performance. The other actors are adequate, with no stand out performances.",1524873600,,440,4.641025641025641
8540305,5,B009DHOZ5M,Best version of Jesus Christ Superstar ever! We have watched this over and over. The rocker voices are fantastic. The production is top notch. And a Spice Girl as Mary Magdalene? Perfect!,1524441600,,187,4.875
8540306,5,B009DHOZ5M,"When I saw this show live for the first time, I thought it was great. But there were two things I hated about it: Judas and Gethsemane. Huge parts of all of Judas' pieces sounded like shouting, and Gethsemane was much the same. I thought that since this was a rock musical, that was just the nature of the beast, especially since Judas also doesn't sound so great to me in the original recording. Since the show overall was great, I figured I'd just try to ignore those issues.

Then I found this version.

It's wonderful. I cringed a little in anticipation of Heaven on Their Minds. I actually really enjoyed it. There was a lot of beautiful sound! It gave me a whole new appreciation for the role of Judas. I was very pleasantly surprised! And Gethsemane was just wonderful. Powerful acting and some spectacular singing. The ""see how I die"" before the falsetto is stunning.

This version is sung so much better than others I've heard. I used to watch Jesus Christ Superstar once a year, during Holy Week. I rented this version on Good Friday, figuring I'd watch it once and then put it away for a year again. I ended up buying it and played it multiple times just in the last month.

I'd highly recommend checking this version out. I also found the updated staging very compelling.",1524268800,,1283,4.517241379310345
8540307,5,B009DHOZ5M,"Terrific production of Jesus Christ Superstar, loaded with dramatic power and especially impressive on blu-ray. Previous to the blu-ray, I had only seen it on the Broadway channel at amazon video. I loved it there, but wow! The blu-ray is a total knockout. This is something you can watch again and againI'm going to have to put my copy under lock and key for a while.

Everyone in this version blows me away. I particularly love the intensely passionate performances by Tim Minchin and Ben Forster, both perfect as Judas and Jesus, respectively. The rock opera is rightfully a passion play - and the production sure does live up to that moniker, conveying the pain of betrayal for both Judas and Jesus, and the integral role of despair, doubt, fear, and (for Jesus) acceptance of death in the unfolding of humankind's salvation. (Talking there in terms of the Christian belief.)

No matter what production of JCS pleases you bestand the recent NBC Live production was excellent too, altho not quite as dramaticit is worth being thankful that JCS has been so revived. I saw the original stage production in the early 1970s, and after the early 1990s revival, I quite sadly thought JCS would never return to high popularity again. But ... seems right now that it will, just in time for a new and incredibly bright generation of young people. A good thing, indeed!",1523232000,,1362,4.791489361702127
8540308,5,B009DHOZ5M,"Without question, the best yet performance of this timeless rock opera.  The newer TV version with Jon Legend pales by comparison.
