8075999,4,B000A7XJYW,I found this to be a decent video. It is not for those who are just starting out. I found that the guy giving the lesson is a lil bit hard to pay attention to. a lil bit dull and his big fingers makes it a lil bit harder to follow what he is doing. But with a couple rewinds and a lil patients you will get it. For what I paid I feel good about my purchase. I found the 50 rockabilly licks you must know video better and more entertaining to watch. But still not bad.,1462406400,,467,3.7755102040816326
8076000,5,B000A7XJYW,Beautifully presented material. Unlocked several things that puzzled me for years. Highly recommended.,1425513600,,102,6.923076923076923
8076001,5,B000A7XJYW,"Steve Trovato's teaching style is very easy to follow and really gives you a sense of accomplishment. Always wanted to learn Rockabilly, and this will get me on the right path. Hope there are more advanced courses available from Steve, when I'm ready.",1394409600,,251,4.8604651162790695
8076002,3,B000A7XJYW,"Ya, we get to learn another group of lics. Wow, anyone know a good dvd or book to actually teach you theory of Rockabilly?

Ya, you learn a bassline riff, a solo, and a couple of other things, big whoop. You won't be able to understand how to come up with your own licks or theory for innovation.",1309478400,4,296,4.103448275862069
8076003,5,B000A7XJYW,"This DVD like most other rockabilly lessons has a stint for Mr. Setzer.  Short and sweet.  Not the best quality but I give it 5 starts because it can help you get your hands around the feel of the genre. Cost me 13 bucks I think, worth every penny, so Why not?",1286236800,,260,3.980769230769231
8076004,5,B000A7XJYW,"Steve Trovato is possibily the fines guitar teacher in the world.  Wish he would make more of these DVDs.  His demostration is very informative, he explains everything so carefully, and you don't even need the tabulature. GREAT STUFF!

Please inform me of any other DVDs that Steve Trovato that might have.

Sincerely,
Wayne Cates",1224288000,2,330,5.055555555555555
8076005,3,B000A7XJYW,"Previous instructional DVDs I've purchased came with a TAB version of the music (or at least the ability to d/l if from a website) so I could clearly see what the instructor was doing and then practice without the DVD playing. This DVD did not come with anything. It mentions 'web support', but this just an ad for the site, for which you have to pay to d/l jam tracks. So the Jam tracks mentioned are only found on the DVD, not in any form you can play on an iPod, so you have to play the DVD to listen to the tracks. I wasn't even able to find mention of the DVD on the site, forget about being able to d/l the TAB.

The instruction seems sound so far, but without anything to accompany it, it makes it much more difficult to follow.",1216684800,10,735,4.104166666666667
8076006,5,B000A7XJYW,"I have looked at a lot of rockabilly instructional DVDs, and this is one of the better ones.  Trovato takes you through some basic rockabilly rhythms (boogie woogie and finger picking-type stuff), and he walks you step by step through three solos: one Carl Perkins flavored solo, and two Brian Setzer flavored solos.  The solos are long, but he breaks down the licks so you can shorten them, pull isolated ideas out, etc.  The solos have some meat to them, so there are some good ideas to take away.  Oh, jam tracks are included that cover the solos.

This is a good follow on to the Jim Weider rockabilly series (my number one recommendation).

My only complaint - no tabs with the DVD, either printed or in pdf format.",1169164800,22,720,4.542635658914729
