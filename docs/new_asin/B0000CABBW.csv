1917304,4,B0000CABBW,"Until Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings arrived on our shores movies like Whale Rider were typical of the sort of movie New Zealand has been traditionally making. Whale Rider is based on a book by well-known New Zealand author Witi Ihimaera. Set on the remote and beautiful, but impoverished East Coast of New Zealand Whale Rider deals with themes alienation and not belonging; the importance of the family; and the struggle of the Maori trying to keep one foot firmly grounded in their traditional ways but at the same time desparately trying to come to terms with the modern world. A deeply moving and uplifting movie, especially if you have empathy with the plight of indiginous people anywhere. Director Nicki Cairo has done a superb job of capturing the essence of the stunning wild scenery and it's people, Weta Workshop (of Lord of the Rings fame) have produced a pod of very realistic whales, but a standout performance of Keisha Castle-Hughes as Paikia with a supporting cast of many locally well-known actors gives this story it's real heart. This is an intelligent, uplifting movie which, at the same time, does not flinch from some of the less savoury aspects in life.",1050624000,9,1180,4.846534653465347
1917305,4,B0000CABBW,"Wale Rider is a beautiful - pure and innocent.  This is a New Zealand film and unlike previous well known kiwi films I.E Once Were Warriors - the acting is above par - OR Lord of the rings - it is pure and simple.  It is the tale of once girls search for her koro's (grandfathers) acceptance and his stubborn hold on his own beliefs.  If you ever have to watch a New Zealand film - you must watch this film.
It reveals the true culture of the Maori people and their struggle to hold on to their belief system.  It shows that New Zealand is more than just grass skirt wearing sheep tending zombie flesh eating country.  As you watch this film remember it is only a small fraction of the diversity that is New Zealand.
For any man, woman or child who knows what family is or struggles to realise it.
Not an action film granted but bring your tissues garanteed.",1050624000,,858,4.2392638036809815

1917312,5,B0000CABBW,"Great Maori film about their ancestral connection to whales. A story about a little girl- the real leader of their people and her stubborn grandfather who refuses to accept her. The film begins a still birth, like the god Maui. A tear jerker with powerful acting.",1510876800,,263,4.739130434782608
1917313,5,B0000CABBW,"The movie begins with the main character Pai, a girl from the Maori tribe of New Zealand, telling the story of their oldest ancestral leader Paike finding their land and bringing their people to it on the back of a whale. She goes on to hence the wait for their newest leader- a boy, her brother. However, at birth, she survived her brother who was next in line to be her tribes Chief. In spite of the death of Pais brother and mother at birth, Pais very traditional grandfather does not take the time to mourn the loss of his daughter-in-law. Instead, he immediately asked about the boy who was to be born, the Cheif heir. Pais father insisted that what had happened happened because it was supposed to and that the child who had survived (Pai) was Paike -and that was to be her name, no matter if his father forbade him. The movie goes on to show how Pai and her grandfather grew close with time in spite of his strong wishes for a grandson which his son had not ever given them. As Pai aged, she was sure to incorporate her Maori tradition in everyday life and always being sure that those around her did not ever forget the ways of the first of the Maori. In addition, it was often that Pai heard whales calling and singing. This was how she knew, without a doubt, that chiefdom was her birthright.
Pais grandfather insists that the death of Pais brother was some sort of punishment. Because of this, he decides to try to find another way to elect the new chief. In an attempt to do so, he decided to gather boys from their local community in order to teach them the ways of their ancestors. Pai was sure to be there. The chief was not fond of this and grew livid because of it. However, this all subsided. Pai completed the last task that the boys under her grandfather's training failed- retrieve the tooth of a whale. Furthermore, Pais birthright to chiefdom was affirmed when her grandfather saw her ride the back of a whale

Like with most indigenous religions, the Maori use mythology and narrative as well as written and oral history to provide their communities with a religious platform built on the teachings of their traditionally true definitions of life and its many aspects. Like teaching, learning is also valued greatly and those who have knowledge are highly respected. For, those who acquire it also acquire the ability to pass it on to future generations. Thus, keeping their ways of life and beliefs alive. However, in Whale Rider, the learning of certain traditions was strictly prohibited for women- as in other indigenous religions as well. Furthermore, as with many native peoples around the world, the lives of the Maori drastically changed the Europeans -as a result, in time, many religious-based practices and beliefs of the Maori were not known amongst the locals in Whale Rider.",1510444800,,2812,4.612774451097804

1917316,5,B0000CABBW,"whale rider is an extraordinary movie about a chief's daughter. When she was born her mother died along with her twin brother.  Her grandfather does not believe in her to take the chief's role, so he makes a school for all boys in the community on how to be a chief. She proves her grandfather wrong.  IT's a slow paced movie but very exciting and beautiful to watch.  I loved it because the girl is strong and doesn't care about what other people think.  It shows the indians in New Zealand.",1507939200,,492,4.373626373626373

1917318,5,B0000CABBW,I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it on TV.  A mixture of 'coming of age' and cultural traditions.  Keisha Castle-Hughes is a treasure.  All of the actors were perfectly cast in their roles.  Keep a tissue handy!,1507680000,,229,4.380952380952381
1917319,5,B0000CABBW,Powerful movie I first. Saw at a movie festival 15 years ago. It has multiple plot lines: cultural mandates that are fading among  a Maori fishing village & what this does to the soul of the village & a deviated & powerful girl who wants to save it.,1507593600,,249,4.1875
1917320,5,B0000CABBW,"A perfect film. I wholly became the girl. All the characters are so alive as to feel someone I've intimately known for years (and I will). The tension surrounding relatives, lifestyles, and tradition are present enough to sweat and gnash.

1917323,5,B0000CABBW,"Incredibly powerful movie, extremely well told and acted.  Keisha Castle-Hughes is amazing as Pai.  The story is well developed, not too fast, not too slow, and builds to a very powerful climax at the end (nuff said so no spoiiler alert).

Unfortunately, the sound is not very good. I'm not sure if it is a problem with my TV (which it could be, even if it is new) or the disc.  The disc was loose in its case and came with scratches - either before it made it into the case, or because it was sliding all around inside the case. Wish the sound was better.

1917337,5,B0000CABBW,"This is one of the better family films and I highly recommend it for preteens and up. Pai is largely ignored by her grandfather, who wanted a boy, and when she attempts to learn the skills of a chief is rejected forcefully (but not psychically) by him. Her persistence to become what ""fate"" destines for her part of the stubbornness she inherited from him, although it is not recognized.

The cast is outstanding, most of whom are actual members of the coastal villiage where the film was made. Young Keisha Castle-Hughes was selected to play Pai and is remarkable. Some of the scenes brought both my wife and I to tears, they were so powerfully portrayed.

The extras on this special edition are a treat and include cast interviews along with deleted scenes. I wish a cut was available with the deleted scenes included where they were cut.",1479772800,5,840,4.668918918918919

1917355,5,B0000CABBW,"I want to go to New Zealand now. When you go to the video store looking for films with positive role models for kids (and adults!), with an inspirational message that you can accomplish something if you put your mind to it, you typically will find almost nothing. Worse, even movies with a fraction of a positive message will be so silly or idiotic that watching them as an adult is torture. With ""Whale Rider"" you get a movie that adults and teens (and many pre-teens) can both watch and enjoy.

As Roger Ebert pointed out in his review of ""Whale Rider,"" something is horribly wrong with a ratings system that gives a movie like this a PG-13 rating. Just watch this next to a movie like ""Dodgeball"" with its objectification of women, toilet humor and sexual innuendo. Both movies have the same rating! Don't be fooled. The average 12 year old _should_ be watching ""Whale Rider"" while ""Dodgeball"" shouldn't be viewed even by 14 year olds. All of this has me wondering about about the sanity and intelligence of the ratings board.

As many have pointed out, Keisha Castle-Hughes puts in a superb performance. Ditto for the rest of the cast.

Perhaps even better than the performances are the positive roles played by most characters. The kids are intelligent, confident and curious. The adults are generally supportive and wise. While the males in the movie have obvious faults, this movie is about them as it is about ""girl power."" There's a scene where Keisha's character is riding a bike with her grandfather and a loving glance passes between them. How rare it is to see such imagery - a father figure bonding with a child - in movies or TV! ""Whale Rider"" isn't just about celebrating a girl's empowerment. It's also about showing the love between male parental figures and their own personal growth as their children mature.

One caveat: ""Whale Rider"" is not typical Hollywood popcorn fare. Viewers with short attention spans or those who hate all foreign film style films will likely not like this movie. Still, ""Whale Rider"" is an excellent start to open the eyes of a youth (or an adult) to ideas outside of what the studies usually throw at us.

Bottom line: We'd all be better off if we had more movies like this.",1463270400,,2222,4.672634271099744

1917393,4,B0000CABBW,"This was a movie I was told to watch as part of research for a project I am working on. I wasn't particularly moved to watch it, but I can say now that I am very glad I did.

Although the film did not boast any actors that I was familiar with, Keisha Castle-Hughes as the young protagonist Pai, and Rawiri Paratene as Koro, her grandfather, carried the film beautifully. I completely bought their relationship and I was heavily invested in it.

For those unfamiliar with this story, in brief it follows the life of a group of Maori villagers in New Zealand, with the grandfather as leader of the ""tribe"" eager to pass the torch to a new leader. He just did not anticipate that the new leader could possibly be his granddaughter. The story follows the trials and tribulations of her trying to prove to him she is as capable as a boy and him trying to thwart her at every turn. It has the built-in conflict right from the start and with the addition of the voice of reason, Nanny (Grandmother), played by Vicky Haughton, you have a beautiful coming-of-age story about a girl who tries desperately to win her grandfather's love, despite all odds.

The story is not perfect. Other than the three actors above, I did not sense any high level of professionalism from others, although there were humorous moments with one of Nanny's chain-smoking gal pals, and some truly sad moments between Hemi (Mana Taumaunu), one of Pai's classmates, and his obviously low-life druggie dad, Roi Taimana. But otherwise it looked like local townspeople were used to varying effect.

Also, IMDB says the movie is 101 minutes long, but I felt a good 20 minutes of it could have been trimmed. If I had watched it in a theater, I would have started to get antsy, as much of it is very slow moving. Also, there are a number of Maori chants, most of which are not translated and so I'm sitting there listening to people chant in another language and not having a clue in hell what they're saying.

But all that is forgiven because of the two main actors and also the stunning cinematography. The first thing I wanted to do was jump on a plane and race to New Zealand to embrace all its natural beauty. In addition, without giving away important story points, let's say there are several realistic scenes with whales that looked totally real to me, as well as some other special effects which were used sparingly, but well.

So, despite being a bit slow, and having a number of actors who are limited in range, Keisha Castle-Hughes has the ""it"" quality of a movie star and I was completely on her side the entire film and rooting for her throughout.

There are bits that are predictable; but there are also surprising, even shocking bits. If you can will yourself to get past the slow, awkward moments, you will be left with a moving emotional experience that should stay with you longer than you think it will.",1419638400,,2883,4.543352601156069

Expecting it to be very bad, I sat through it and humiliated myself because of it. I had heard about it and that it was an art-house favorite, one can't begin to see why, it is really amateurish and doesn't tell anything new which hasn't been done in some extent by American films and most of the script is extremely weak and simplistic.

Most everyone has been saying that this is so ""original"" but if you look at the history of American film, you can find many things which were borrowed. The film itself is unbelievable, and incredulous considering the lead role is played by a white little girl who doesn't really emphasize enough about the Maori culture, all she does is mop around in her sad state because her grandfather doesn't respect her because she is a girl. Not only is this film an aberration, but it insults all previous Maori culture because it pretends to be an modern artifact which wants to unite the past and the new, thing is, erasing the old ways isn't the way to do it.

Males and females had distinct roles in early cultures and there was nothing wrong with that, that is how they survived until the modern world caught up with them and started removing pieces of their structure and eventually, they became integrated into the European world, which was quite a mistake, considering that is where Feminist theory had surfaced its ugly head. Most of the cast is played by annoying people who can't act, one example is the little stoner boy who is being trained in the martial arts by the grandfather, he doesn't even look like he should be there, he fights the little girl with sticks and it is the most contrived scene I have ever seen. Most of the film, if not all, is contrived in such ways. Because it is so simplistic and absurd, this film will move many simple minded dullards who can't see beyond it's pretensions, this film is evil in its most evident nature because it wants to be 'feminist' and contort the meaning of the past, so much like totalitarian states. I should warn everyone that most of it is very boring also and the ending is one of the most ludicrous things I have ever seen. Grade: D",1391040000,,2440,4.493243243243243

1917459,4,B0000CABBW,"The plot of ""The Whale Rider"" follows the story of a young Maori girl named Paikea Apirana, Pai for short.  The story begins in the hospital the day of her birth where both her twin brother and mother have died during child birth.  Her grieving father, Poro, is being pressured by his father and tribal leader, Koro, to try again for a male child as soon as possible.  This is important to Koro because according to tradition leadership is handed down to the first born male child.
Poro defies this tradition in two ways.  First, he refuses to accept the leadership which should traditionally be his as he is Koro's eldest son, going so far as to leave the tribe to live as an artist in Germany.  Second, he does so by naming his daughter Paikea.  Paikea is the name of the Maori ancestor who according to legend led his people to their current land while riding on top of a whale.  Koro and all the past leaders of the tribe are direct descendants of this legendary leader.  Since Pai is female she cannot traditionally inherit tribal leadership. Koro and his wife raise Pai and although it is clear he loves her, also condemns her and blames her for conflicts happening within the tribe as she is a break in traditional line to the leadership of the tribe.
To fill this gap in leadership Koro starts a cultural school for the first born village boys, hoping a new leader will emerge.  He teaches the boys traditional chants and use of a taiaha, a fighting staff, which are traditionally reserved for males.  Pai feels that she could become the leader and should be allowed to take part in the school; she secretly follows Koro's lessons and seeks out her uncle, Koro's second son, to teach her the use of the taiaha.  When Koro finds outs his relationship with Pai further erodes.  This becomes exacerbated when none of the boys succeed at the traditional task of recovering a whale tooth, the symbol of tribal leadership, which Koro had thrown into the ocean. This was the final task which would identify one of them worthy of becoming leader.  Koro falls into despair with the loss of the tooth and with it no one identified to take over as leader.  He calls out in chant to the ancient ones to help resolve his conflict, while unbeknownst to him Pai is calling out in chant as well from down the beach.  Shortly thereafter, while on a boat outing with her uncle, Pai is told where the whale tooth had been thrown and she dive out of the boat and down to retrieve her grandfathers symbol of leadership.  The family hold on to the tooth, not certain of how Koro would take to the fact that it was recovered by Pai.
In an attempt to mend the relationship with Koro, Pai invites him to be her guest of honor at a concert of Maori chants her school is putting on.  During the contest it is revealed Pai had won an inter-school speech contest with a touching dedication to Koro and the traditions of the village calling out that leadership should be shared among the people thus reducing the burden on one person.  Koro misses Pai's speech. He was late, and while walking to the school, he comes upon many whales which are beached near Pai's home. The entire village attempts to get them back into the water, but all efforts fail.  Koro sees it as a sign of his failure and admonishes Pai against touching the largest whale because ""she has done enough damage.""  The largest whale traditionally belongs to the legendary Paikea.  When Koro and the other members of the tribe walk away in expiration and exhaustion, Pai climbs onto the back of the largest whale and coaxes it back into the ocean.  The entire pod follows Pai and the large whale back into the ocean.  As Pai is going out into the ocean on the back of the whale the family shows Koro the whale tooth which had been recovered by Pai. It is only then that Koro realizes he has been ignoring the true leader the entire time. Pai nearly drowns and is lost at sea for a good duration.  When Pai is found and brought to the hospital, Koro asks her forgiveness and acknowledges her as his successor.  The film comes to an end with the tribe, including Pai's father, uncle, and grandparents, celebrating her status as leader, as the newly finished ceremonial boat is hauled into the sea for its maiden voyage.
""The Whale Rider"" is a poignant movie which entwines many themes of traditional Maori religious beliefs.  There is a strong sense of the interconnectedness between the past and the future.  Koro and Pai both call out to the ancient ones, their ancestral leaders, for guidance and help.  While they are calling out images of whales are shown to symbolize the connection between nature and humanity. This connection is also illustrated in one scene when Pai's father comes to take her away to live with him.  On the way to the airport, on a seaside highway, Pai sees the whales off in a distance swimming parallel to their vehicle.  Pai interprets this as a sign from the ancestors for her to return to Koro's home and to pursue her rightful place as leader.  She has her father turn around and take her back.
Another theme of traditional Maori religious belief in the movie is the legendary Paikea who is shown riding his whale in a carving which sits atop the pavilion Koro uses as the site of his school for teaching the old ways",1379980800,,5294,4.517819706498952

1917461,4,B0000CABBW,"Whale rider is a heart-wrenching story of a girl, Pai, who believes that she was born to be the next leader of her tribe.  The story takes place in eastern New Zealand among the Whangara people.  They believe that their ancestor, Paikea, rode to shore on the back of a whale when he encountered trouble at sea.  This is a patriarchal tribe that believes the first-born son is a direct descendant of Paikea and that they are destined to be the chiefs of the tribe.  When Pai was born there was a twin brother who died along with her mother.  Her brother was destined to be the next chief.  Pai lives with her grandmother and grandfather, Koro.  They have a special bond and love each other dearly.  Koro is very traditional and will not allow Pai to learn the ways of a Whangara chief.  Instead he gathers all of the first-born males to teach them and then test them to see who will be the next chief.  When he finds out that Pai has also learned all the boys are learning he gets very angry and will not speak to her or rise from his bed.  One night whales start beaching on the sand in their village.  The villagers try to make the whales comfortable and to coax them back into the sea.  There is one whale apart from the others, the biggest whale.  The villagers believe that this is Paikea's whale and they know that if he goes back into the water the other whales will follow.  The villagers cannot get the whale to go back into the water.  After the start leaving the beach to rest, Pai goes over to the whale and the whale goes back into the water with Pai on his back. Pai rides the whale into the sea and is found and rescued a day or so later.  All of the other whales follow.  Koro realizes that Pai is gone and at that moment accepts that she should be the new leader of the tribe.

 This movie is very reflective of the indigenous tribes we have studied in our World Religions class.  The tribe has the story of how they came to be through the story of their ancestor Paikea.  They are very strict in their traditions as to the roles of men and women and they have rituals and chants for different ceremonies or occasions.  The indigenous religions we have studied in our class also have their different creation stories and their rites of passage for certain stages of life.  They have songs or chants for all reasons, be it death, birth or a coming of age.  The movie Whale Rider gives the viewer a feeling of how these tribes continue to keep their traditions even in a more modern age.

1917464,5,B0000CABBW,"The Whale Rider was a beautiful movie about a young girl by the name Pai looking for approval from her grandfather, Koro. Koro, the tribe leader, is a descendant of proud a Whangara chief. In this culture, the first born son becomes chief, prophet, and leader of group. The Whangara legend states their people come from Paikea, a brave man that rode to their from Hawaii on the back of a whale. Pai's father did not follow the same teachings. During childbirth, Pai's mother and twin brother were both lost. The loss took a toll on the family. Pai's father left the country for Germany and her grandfather was disappointed she was not a male and savior of their people. Over the years, Pai and her grandfather built a special relationship, but he still held on to the pain of not having a grandson.
 Koro built a school to teach the young boys, the ways of their ancestors in hopes of finding their new leader. Pai spent time trying to learn to old ways and continually looking for the approval of Koro.
 The film is a great representation of how people try to hold on to the culture of their ancestors while living in today's world. At Pai's school presentations, she showed the family and her ancestors respect with native dancing and chants. She even knew some of the language. Koro teaching the young men the fighting styles of the ancestors represented leadership, strength, courage, and intelligence. In his old age, Koro understood someone needed to understand the old ways and teachings of the ancestors to help bring the tribe out of struggle.
 The Whale Rider is an excellent example of a world religion most are not familiar with. The film is simple and beautiful representation of Whangara culture.

The young always want to take risks, cut corners and have fun. It is also about death, the natural order of the dying of the light. The erosion of communities that disintegrate under the pace of 'change'-and the loss of things which will never be so again. But will the challenge put down be picked up and what will it look like for the next generation? I much preferred Ngati- a rougher, low cost production and set in an older time-well a time when New Zealand appeared to stand still but more in keeping with the story of my own community. The loss of industry, the shafting of workers for no better purpose than greed by those so far away from the damage they caused it was an obscenity. But whale rider-is uplifting. The cinematography is superb; the acting pretty damn good. The humour-a blessing and in plentiful supply.

1917483,5,B0000CABBW,"Whale Rider is a wonderful tale from New Zealand of 12 year old Pai, born into a Maori culture in which only males are allowed to rise to tribal leader. Sound familiar? Pai believes that she can become tribal leader and sets out to become the legendary Whale Rider, who Maori legend says led them to New Zealand riding atop a whale leading his people. She is determined to make his grandfather proud - in spite of his disappointment at having a daughter for a grandchild instead of a son. The movie explores contemporary issues in a lyrical magical realism context that is captivating, thrilling and brings audiences out of their seats. Winner of multiple awards, this is the perfect parent-daughter movie that portrays Pai as a wonderful role model for young women, and tells a terrific story with lavish photography. A worthy partner to Life of Pi [Blu-ray 3D], and Beasts of the Southern Wild [Blu-ray], both of which deserve to be seen on BluRay. Bring your daughter!",1365724800,,971,4.7514792899408285
1917484,2,B0000CABBW,"The Whale Rider is the story of a young Maori girl and her family.  It could also be described as the story of an indigenous people being forced to adapt to modern society while trying to retain their beliefs, traditions, and identity.  The Maori are natives of New Zealand.  The story starts with the birth of Paikea, the granddaughter of a Maori chief.  Both her mother and her brother die during childbirth, leaving her grandfather very disappointed.  He truly believed that the grandson that died was going to be the next great chief and a powerful leader for the Maori people to usher them through this disjointing time.
 As time passes, her grandfather does come to care for her, although still wishes for a male heir.  Meanwhile, Paikea's father has moved on with his life, starting a new family far from the Maori heritage.  When Paikea starts to leave with him, she realizes that she can't.  Her grandfather and other elder Maori decide to do something to save their heritage.  They build a school to teach their youth the past and rituals of their people.  This school is supposed to be only for boys, but Paikea refuses to let this stop her.
 Paikea sits in on most of the lessons, albeit hidden behind the house.  When her grandfather catches her using the taiaha, an ancient fighting technique using a stick, he becomes very angry and bans her from the house.  She starts living with her uncle, who continues to teach her the taiaha.  Paikea continues to try to become a part of her heritage.  Meanwhile, her grandfather tests the youth in an attempt to find an old relic.  The boys all fail, but later Paikea succeeds.  All the while she calls to the whales.
 As stated earlier, this is just as much a story of a young girl trying to get to her heritage as much as it is a story of indigenous people suffering displacement.  The Maori try hard to keep as close to their native land as possible.  The culture is very male dominated.  They try hard to pass along the ancient ways, like the use of taiaha.  Paikea shows an extensive knowledge of her ancestors, revering all they had done for her and keeping them with her, another aspect of indigenous sacred ways.  The respect for animals is apparent, especially in the way the Maori have such respect for the whales.",1365206400,,2279,4.584158415841584

1917491,5,B0000CABBW,"'Whale Rider', directed by Niki Caro, is a GREAT story about the struggle of the Whangara people of New Zealand to hold onto their roots in a modern day world.  Koro (played by Rawiri Paratene), the chief of the current-day Whangara people comes from a long bloodline of chiefs leading back to Paikea, the ancient ancestor who survived when his canoe capsized, by riding to safety on the back of a whale.  Since that time it was the first born male to the chief that became the next chief of the people.  Koro struggles throughout the movie to accept that his first born son gave him a granddaughter, Pia (played by Keisha Castle-Hughes), and refused to try for another child when his wife died birthing her.

Throughout the movie Pia (Paikea) struggles to gain the trust and affection of her grandfather as he desperately seeks a worthy male in the village to become the next chief of the Wangara.  Through many trials and tribulations the chief is finally revealed . . . but not they way Koro expected it.  This heartfelt tale speaks of the fight Koro and the Whangara people face as evolution changes the ways of their sacred history. Great story, great acting. :)

As a student of world religions I appreciate the depiction of an indigenous people struggling to keep alive the traditions of their heritage while living in a modern day world.  Not only do they face the struggle of their day to day lives, but they have a history with traditions and Koro, the chief, will do anything to keep it alive in his people.  From they way they are taught in school to Koro teaching the young boys of the village to become chief, this story has it all.  It speaks too clearly of the problem many indigenous people are facing today as the modern world steps in on their ways without a second thought to what might actually be going on.  Maybe stories like this can open the eyes of those who are still naive to this way of life.  That they are real people with real lives, even though it may seem different than ours.",1359244800,,2010,4.506887052341598
1917492,4,B0000CABBW,"The movie Whale Rider was extremely interesting. It starts out in New Zealand, where twins are born, a boy and a girl. During childbirth, their mother dies, and not to long after being born, the baby boy dies also, leaving the little girl, whose name is Paikea. Paikea's grandfather is extremely disappointed that the boy had died, because he was hoping to make him chief once he was older. Distraught over his wife and son's death, Paikea's father leaves to Germany to become an artist, while she is being raised by her grandparents in New Zealand. The rules over the village state that a girl cannot be a chief or prophet, that it can only be a male, upholding the sacred belief that the whales and their ancestors are interconnected. Paikea, though she is just a young school girl, shows signs of leadership and strength, putting her at odds with her grandfather, who refuses to admit that she shows signs of a chief. At the climax, multiple whales are washed to shore, because of a sacred prayer Paikea prayed. All the local villagers try helping keep the whales alive, but there seems to be no solution, not even from Paikea's grandfather. Come to find out, only Paikea can make the whales go back into the ocean, because she is the chosen one. So she rides on the back of one of the whales, leading them back to safety, but harming her own life. Once she is recovered, she is sent to the hospital where her and her grandfather reconnect their bond. After that she is held high in the village, even though she claims not be a prophet, but she will give people hope.
 This movie had a lot of undertones about indigenous religions, or older religions that have no changed over the years. The upheld their beliefs of old. They believed in the power of their ancestors watching over them in guiding them through life. They had a special connection with the whales, believing that human and animal life have a special spiritual bond. They also practiced the belief of women not being in a leadership position, which was broken because of Paikea's special gift. They also showed that they would not be changed by the urbanized ways of life, by showing respect for their elders, and practicing in religious rituals, which involved singing and dancing.",1359158400,,2249,4.664987405541562

1917497,4,B0000CABBW,"This was a great movie. It was about a Maori Tribe in New Zealand. The 1st born son had a set of twins a boy and a girl, but the boy and mother dies at childbirth only leaving the girl. Her name was Paikea(Pai) and her grandfather(Koro) was very upset that the boy died because he would have been the 1st born of his son therefore able in their tradition to become the chief of their tribe. Pai does everything she could to win her granfather's love and acceptance, but he was distant towards her. Koro started an all boy school to teach the boys all about the tribe and to teach them the songs and dances. Pai was very upset when Koro would not let her attend the school. After watching Koro train the boys and her uncle helping train Pai she felt she could be the chief of their tribe.  This was a little difficult because in the Maori tribe only males can be the chief. Pai's father refused to be the chief that's why his father Koro was looking for a male leader. After training the boys Koro took them out to sea in a small boat and threw his necklace with a whale tooth on it (from the whale their ancestors rode to safety on). None of the boys could get the necklace from the deep waters. Koro was very hurt and upset. One day Pai was near where the place where Koro threw the necklace, she jumped in to get it. She came back up with the necklace and a lobster. Her grandmother and uncle did not tell Koro at first that Pai retreived the necklace. Pai said a prayer for Koro that made the whales wash up on the shore by their home. Koro was angry and blamed Pai for it. Koro and the tribe tried to get the whales back in the water but was unsucessful. Pai went out to the water and the biggest whale she went over to and started praying and then she got on his back and the whale started going back into the sea with the other whales following. Pai was on the whale's back and rode out into the sea. Pai almost died. Her grandmother then told Koro Pai was the one the got his necklace out of the sea. Koro felt very bad for ever doubting her. She then became the chief at 12 years old. She was the first female ever chosen. Koro was very proud of her and then they rode a giant canoe out to the sea to celebrate her new position. This relates to World Religions because they were part of an indigenous religion and they also had many statues that they worshipped and they also had certain ways to greet each other. The main way was when they seen another member of the tribe they touch noses.",1353110400,,2499,4.1419753086419755

1917499,2,B0000CABBW,"Unlike other viewers, I was not enchanted by the little girl or by Maori culture. The men are obnoxious, overbearing, hateful, selfish, aggressive bullies who do nothing but strut, bellow and play-fight with their big sticks; while the women are cattily passive-aggressive enablers of the abusive men. What's enchanting about that? If that's what Maori culture is really like, then it's good it's mostly been abandoned for the civilization of the English settlers. Good riddance.

The little girl is okay, and she can cry on cue, which got her an Oscar nomination; but she's not interesting enough to overcome the overbearing melodrama that alternates with cloying cuteness and phony sentimentality to make watching this movie an annoying experience. It seems to last MUCH longer than its supposed 101 minutes; by the time I got to the sappy, absurd end of this movie, I felt like I'd been watching it for weeks.

This movie may seem good to TV-bred children, or to fans of soap operas, or to people who for some reason are interested in the abusive culture of the Maori, or to people who miss the awful Disney live-action movies of the 50s like Old Yeller, but I didn't like it at all.

The DVD has English subtitles for those of us unfamiliar with the Maori version of the New Zealand dialect of English, but for some stupid reason the subtitles do not translate the fairly extensive parts that are in the Maori language. The subtitles just say ""[Speaks in Maori]"", etc, as if all we need to know is what language they're speaking (and are too stupid to remember what language it is from one speech to the next), but that we DON'T need to know what they're saying. That's just plain dumb, and it's irritating. If what they're saying doesn't matter, why are they even speaking a language? Why don't they just grunt?",1351296000,2,1816,4.7405063291139244

She loves her culture, traditions, and her tribes religious views. She wants to learn more and more about her ancestory and the religion that has been passed down from generation to generation so she can honor the teachings of those before her. The end of the movie the whales come to the shore and are stuck on land. The biggest whale of all believed to the be the mighty one was unable to be moved back into the ocean by the entire community, but when the young girl went out on her own she climbed on top of the whale after speaking to it and he moved himself back into the ocean where she rode him into the deep blue. Because this happened she is believed to become the ""Great Leader"" and is now the tribes new chief.
This movie is not only based on the life of a child but shows us and teaches us about a religion of another part of this world. They believe that the whales are their ancestors and the great chiefs and spirits that look over their tribe. They have many spiritual rituals and dances. The tribe has their own language and have chants and songs in which stories are told and prayers are prayed. In one part of the movie the young women put on a show for the others in the tribe.

1917502,5,B0000CABBW,"This movie starts off with a woman in labor with twins. Unfortunately the male twin and mother do not survive.  We learn that this story is taking place in a Maori village in New Zealand. The father (Porourangi) is left with Pai (the female twin) and a very disappointed father. Koro is Pai's grandfather that along with her grandmother takes care of Pai while Porourangi goes away after realizing that he cannot make his father happy now that he did not have a son. Koro is in need of a grandson to take on the leadership he holds as the chief.  Pai is now 11 years old and is trying very hard to empress her grandfather and make him believe that she is the leader he has been searching for all along. Koro starts a school for boys to find the new leader. Pai is secretly learning fighting and other skills that are needed to be the chief. Koro simply cannot see that women could ever be a leader because he cannot see past his indigenous ways. When all the boys fall short of the tasks Koro introduces them to, Pai ask for help from their gods. Several whales wash themselves ashore and Koro and the village try to get them back out to shore. After Koro tells Pai that she has done enough damage by her bad karma, she gets on the biggest whale and guides him back into the ocean. Everyone watches her as she rides the whale out and then down. The whale went down for a long time and everyone knows that Pai is not okay. When she is recovering in the hospital is when Koro realizes that Pai is the natural born leader that she has been trying to prove to him.

1917503,5,B0000CABBW,"Whale Rider was a wonderfully directed movie with a powerful message.

 The movie centered on a teenage girl, Paikea, whose mother and twin brother died during the childbirth/delivery. Paikea's father obviously devastated at the loss of his wife and son- was interrupted by the arrival of his father and mother, the father obviously not caring about the sensitivity of the situation instead he insisted upon seeing the boy.  The grandfather, Koro, after learning of the boy's death shunned his granddaughter and insisted on chanting over the poor little angel who had passed away.  Koro had believed that his grandson would be the heir/chief for their tribe who would bring about change as we found out later in the story, once the boy died the grandfather was distraught over who would lead his people. Paikea in the mean time grew up living with her grandparents because her father had taken off not long after the death of his wife and became an artist.  He traveled extensively throughout Europe and only visited occasionally- mainly because of the strained relationship you saw between the father and son.
 Koro eventually grew to care for Paikea but insisted on embracing the old ways that the next chief should be a man as with many traditions he was rock solid in his beliefs. Koro eventually set up a school to teach the first born young men the traditions and customs to hopefully choose a new chief among the families of the tribe.  Paikea who only wanted the approval and love of her grandfather sought out to learn these traditions unfortunately Koro was disgusted by this and sought to dissuade Paikea every chance he got.  Paikea eventually learned each part and excelled at every turn with the help of her uncle, Rawiri.
 Towards the later part of the movie, we learn that whales which were a spiritual symbol of the Maori tribe as it is believed that their ancestors rode on the backs of whales when they entered our world so whales were a revered symbol for the tribe.  A few beached whales were discovered by Koro who insisted that someone were to blame for this and wouldn't let Paikea help in the efforts to get the biggest one back out to sea.  Paikea ended up riding the whale for some time and was later found unconscious, she recovered and the entire tribe celebrated the announcement of their new chief, Paikea even her grandfather looked proud as they rowed into the ocean together as a tribe.
 Whale Rider demonstrates how in many older religious beliefs that were male dominated, fought and resisted women being allowed to serve in seats of power.  Through this story it is demonstrated how a teenage girl who strives to be this chief/leader of her tribe, mainly to prove her significance to her grandfather.  Also shown is how as generations evolve and change certain ideals among indigenous religion view such as in this story when Koro establishes that the heir must be male- as it was told in ancient oral histories and through traditions.  The progression of the views and beliefs are a common side effect to mainstream modern times to influence some indigenous views that can be interrupted in a fluid manner.",1347753600,2,3144,4.796296296296297
1917504,5,B0000CABBW,"As legend has it, Paikea, an ancestor of the Maori tribe, rode to their sacred land in eastern New Zealand on the back of a whale.  The leader of the Maori tribe has always been the first born son, but when the Chief's son loses his wife and newborn son during childbirth, only the twin sister, also named Paikea, survives.  Her father leaves Paikea to be raised by her grandparents, including the chief of the tribe Koro.  As she grows she learns the Maori traditions, but her grandfather will not allow her to lead the tribe because she is a girl.  He sets out to teach the rest of the young boys the Maori way of life in hopes of finding a new leader.  Paikea is not allowed to attend the training, but secretly observes their sessions.  The final test is when Koro takes the boys into the ocean and challenges them to retrieve the whale tooth he throws in the water, but none of them are successful.  Later Paikea recovers the tooth. It's not until a pod of whales beach themselves, and Paikea is the only person able to coax them back into the water after the entire tribe has tried for hours, that her grandfather finally sees her as the true new Maori leader.

The Whale Rider exhibits several features of indigenous religions.  The Maori people held their beliefs and traditions as sacred and they revered whales and their ancestor Paikea above all others.  They were very connected to the land on which they lived because of the legend of Paikea and the whale.  They had many rituals and ceremonies, which included dances and songs.  When in trouble they would chant to the ancestors for guidance.  The Maori acknowledged gender roles by struggling against having a female as their leader.  Young boys were initiated into the tribe by being taught to fight with long sticks.  Whale Rider is an excellent example and an accurate depiction of an indigenous religion for those interested in the learning more about the subject.",1347494400,2,1933,4.627565982404692
1917505,4,B0000CABBW,"Whale Rider is an inspiring film filled with hope, courage, and perseverance. Twelve-year-old Pai seeks desperately for approval and acceptance from her stubborn grandfather, whose feminist behavior rejected the thought of having a granddaughter. Pai's family waited anxiously for the arrival of their new descendant, Pai's twin brother.  Her brother was expected to be the next leader in line; however his death after birth left only Pai to be the most recent descendant. Women were not leaders in this tribe, and Pai's grandfather refused to accept her, claiming he has no use for her. Pai on the other hand knew what her destiny was and would not give up on it or her grandfather. She trained herself just as the boys in her village were being trained by her grandfather. In fact, she was able to do things that those boys had failed at. At the climax, Pai fulfills her desire to make her grandfather proud when she climbs up on a dying whale and leads it back into the water to live. By proving herself worthy and courageous, young Pai changes the hearts of all those around her, especially her beloved grandfather.

  Whale Rider relates to World Religion in that they are a native tribe filled with culture. They can easily be compared to indigenous religions. They have a great respect for their ancestors, as mentioned multiply times in the movie. Their tribe displayed singing and dancing rituals, and opened a ""sacred school of learning"". Also, the women's role plays a big part of the movie and can relate to World Religion. Pai's grandfather did not accept her as a descendant because she was female, and females were not destined to be leaders. The women's role was to stay at home, bear children, and raise their families. Males were seen as dominant and chief leaders.",1347235200,,1783,4.816993464052287
1917506,5,B0000CABBW,"Whale Rider was a great movie. It really captures the feeling of never giving up. From the beginning the movie grabs your attention with the hardship of the family facing a terrible lose and gaining a true blessing in disguise. The first born little boy of the new generation, the profit who they expected would take them out of the darkness and make everything better again, and instead his twin sister survived, Paikea.
The family in this movie captured a lot of traditional values that had been handed down from generation to generation. Traditions that were hard to allow change but it happened and taught the family that change is not always a bad thing to accept. This little girl was looked upon by her grandfather as being a curse.  He loved her in a way that the only thing she lived for was to please him. But his traditional values were too strong to let her in that he pushed her away to venture things on her own. The teachings to the younger boys about the old ways were stick and enduring. These were to test their strength, fighting skills, learning and leadership ability, to produce future warriors and future chiefs. Through it all the one that was looked at as being a curse the one that broke the line back to the ancestors was the one who lead them all back together through to a new beginning.
Overall, this movie had memorable moments and relatable moments were it teaches you about strength, endurance, the ability to allow things to change, and to never give up. Family played a big part in this film along with family traditional values that they all valued and held high, but we all learn that things change over generation and in some situations it only takes one to make a difference and to help start a new tradition.",1347235200,2,1748,4.549206349206349
1917507,3,B0000CABBW,"""The Whale Rider"" is a movie that is one of great interest to people who are big into primal religions. This movie hits the nail on the head per say, when dealing with an local, and ancestral religion. ""Pai"" must overcome resistance as she tries to assume her destiny, as the leader of a tribe on the New Zealand coast -- is quickly absorbing. The film starts off with her mother and father in the Hospital where Pai and her brother are being born. But with birth complications Pai's brother dies and takes their mother with him.  This is upsetting to the grandfather because the tribe needs a boy to be born to learn the ways of a chief to lead them out of the darkness they are in. Pai lives with the family on the coast where she attends school and is constantly rejected by her grandfather. He loves her and treats her well at times but he tends to hate the fact that the boy did not survive the birth. When Pai's father comes back from Germany he. Is not pleased with how the grandfather is raising her and asked Pai to come live with him in Germany. She says that she will go and on the way to she stops him and says she cannot go. Her grandfather not pleased with the fact that she did not leave starts a school, where he will train the children to be leaders. Pai does not follow his command and he kicks her out of the school for not listening to his ridiculous commands. Pai asked her uncle to train her to fight with the pole all the kids are forced to learn how to do. Pai's grandfather has task for all the young boys to complete but they all always fall short. While Pai is with her uncle she completes all the task her grandfather ask of the boys. Then one night that her grandfather called to the whales she called also and they came, and got beached on the shore. The whole tribe tried and tried to get the whales back in the water but they were not able to do so. Pai went out to see the main whale and motivated it to get back in the water, and in doing so she gave up her life. The tribe rescued her drowning body and took her to the hospital where she was revived and her grandfather accepted that Pai a girl was the chosen one.",1347235200,,2149,4.141148325358851
1917508,4,B0000CABBW,"Paikea, an ancestor of the whangara people of new zealand, escaped death thousands of years ago by riding to shore on the back of a whale when his canoe overturned. This created the tradition within the whangara people that the first born male in each generation was thought to be a direct descendent of Paikea and was given the title of chief. Pai, an 11 year old girl, who's mother and twin brother died during child birth, believes she is destined to be new chief leader. She must go against her grandfather, Koro, and more than a thousand years of tribe tradition to fulfill what she believes to be her destiny. I found this movie to be very uplifting and inspiring. It can be related not to just this one, small, tribe of people, but to so many other religions and people as well. It's truly enlightening to see such a strong transition of female roles within traditional, customary belief systems. I think this film is a must see for all people. Tradition is only tradition until someone breaks the rules...then it becomes a new tradition. Culture must change according to the people that are in it, and this film portrays that beautifully!",1347235200,,1146,4.650246305418719
1917509,4,B0000CABBW,"The ""Whale Rider""(based of a novel written by Witi Ihimaera) is a well written story with a blend of tradition mixed with modern times.  When growing up in a Maori tribe off the coast of New Zealand, twelve year old Pai, the youngest decendant of the cheif, deals with being a young girl but knowing she has something special to offer her tribe.  But the Maori tribe has never had a female leader, so after the death of her twin brother at birth her grandfather started a school for youngmen in the tribe to find the next chief of the Maori tribe. Koro, Pai's grandfather, refused to think of Pai being the leader of the tribe, to him its a mans job and its tradition.  In small tribes and cultures tradition is imperative, and breaking traditions in a culture is not thought of as normal. So though you'll not like what Koro does at times, it's understandable to see him not want to change in their traditions. ""Whale Rider"" shows that with modern times and globaliztion of modern cultures, change in traditions is not at all a bad thing.",1347235200,,1039,4.4867724867724865

1917511,5,B0000CABBW,"I found this movie to be quite stunning, not only visually, but emotionally, as well.  It was quite touching and moving, and I found myself very much connected to the lead actress, Pai.  Learning about indigenous cultures and their struggles to maintain their traditions and morals in an ever-changing modern world really helped me to see the depth of this film.  For me, the inner turmoil of the Maori tribe that is depicted on screen is the result of them trying to hold on tightly to the foundation that their ancestors built.  I think there is meant to be a subdued understanding that modern ways-of-life are gradually taking hold of their own private society.  The only things you see in the film to suggest this is the music blaring from a stereo and the graphics on the clothes of the children.  Basically, this is telling us that there is a world outside of the Maori civilization that is threatening to take over if they are not able to fight it off.

The young actress, Keshia Castle-Hughes, gave an Oscar-worthy performance as Pai, a young Maori girl whose mother and twin brother died during birth, and whose father left her with her grandparents so that he could venture out on business.  Pai's grandfather, Koro, is very resentful of the fact that there is no male heir to take his place as leader of his Maori community.  To remedy the situation, he starts a school to teach the young boys of the community the ways of the Maori.  Pai tries to take part in the education, but is harshly refused because she is a girl.  Pai never gives up the fight for equality, and is encouraged by her loving grandmother.  Although her grandfather also loves her very much, he is unable to see past her gender to see that she does, indeed, possess the perfect leadership qualities he has been searching for.

I watched this movie as an assignment for class, but I am taking much more away from it than that.  It really opened my eyes to the differences between my modern world and the modern world of indigenous tribes.  I give this film two big thumbs up and I recommend it to everyone.",1335052800,3,2087,4.557640750670242

1917513,5,B0000CABBW,"As a granddaughter born to the tribal chief, Pai seems to be resented by him due to the fact she was a girl.  Her twin brother and mother died during childbirth, leaving no male to carry on as chief.  Her grandfather begins to teach other boys the ways of their ancestors.  He completely ignores the fact that Pai possess many of the traits he is currently teaching the young boys.  When his final test to determine who will be the next chief fails, her grandfather begins to feel that he too has failed. Pai is able to complete that test, but her grandfather does not know.  She chants to the whales and they listen and come to the shore.  With so many whales beached, they find one that they believe is that of their ancestor.  The whole tribe fights to get him back in the water, with no luck.  It is Pai who climbs onto him and rides him back into the ocean.  It is then that her grandfather truly realizes her potential, but it might be too late.  Pai ends up in the hospital, but thankfully she ends up okay.

This directly relates to indigenous religions because they follow many ways that their ancestors set before them.  They have chants that they perform depending on what is needed.  Their tribe is mainly male dominated and they have a hard time accepting a woman who steps out of her role.  The follow traditions to a T, and Pai's grandfather gets very upset when things are disrupted.  He believes that each ritual much be performed just as their ancestors had previously done so, or it may have very harmful consequences.

1917514,5,B0000CABBW,"Whale Rider is a touching story about a Maori girl, coming-of-age in modern day New Zealand. The girl, Paikea, struggles with the feeling that she is meant to be part of the Maori tribe and she desperately wants to please her grandfather. Paikea's father, Porourangi, was the first born son of the tribe leader, Koro Apunahni; the role of leadership had been passed down from father to son or grandson for many generations. When Porourangi refused to take leadership, the role fell on his first born son. In the first scenes of the movie, we learn that Paikea's mother and twin brother both died at Paikea's birth. In a struggle with tradition and bitterness towards his granddaughter's position, Koro sets out to find the next great tribe leader. He calls on the first born sons of the tribe and begins to teach them the old ways. Paikea tries to leave with her father to go start a new life away from the tribe, but as they were driving away, she felt the whale calling to her. She could not leave, so each day she went to the meeting house and watched from a window and learned the traditions of her ancestors. What she could not learn from the window or from afar, she learned from her uncle. Paikea tries to gain the acceptance of her grandfather as she learns the ways of the ancestors. The final test of the first-borns' turns up a failed attempt to find the next leader, sending Koro into a state of meditation and reflection. He calls to the ancestors. In feeling his sorrow, Paikea calls out too. When a pod of whales swims ashore, it is believed that the ancestors have answered them, though it is unsure what they were saying until Paikea climbs atop the largest whale and coaxes the pod back into the water. When Paikea is seen riding the whale, the test of her spirit and the message of the ancestors is clear. Paikea will be the next leader and the first girl to ever lead her people.

 Whale Rider portrays many cultural themes of indigenous tribes including the importance of tradition, animism, ancestrism, initiations, and - most importantly - women's roles. It paints a beautiful portrayal of the life of Maori people and how they carry on the traditions of their forefathers with the utmost respect and diligence. The film captures the essence of their people and colors a portrait indigenous sacred ways. Through animism, the whale is their animal totem, a symbol of their heritage and a reminder of their ancestors' journey. The initiation depicted in this story follows the passing down of tradition from fathers to sons, the ""coming-of-age"" struggle. Tradition is the most important factor in the lives of many indigenous cultures. Tradition is what determines destiny and also what determines the role one will play in their everyday lives. For the Maori, the tribe leader had traditionally been male, going back in time all the way to the ancient ones. Maori women also played a key role in teaching the traditions to their children. Paikea's grandmother shared with her the stories and calls of their ancestors. Tradition may have been broken with Paikea in becoming the chief, but tradition also took a step forward by helping them create a new tradition. The messages that her ancestors sent were through the death of her brother, her name, her strong will, her determination, her respect for everyone and her ride on Paikea's whale. In the last scene of the movie, when the waka is hauled into the sea, it is an inspiring observation that there are also women rowing alongside the men. I would assume that, traditionally, the waka would have also been reserved for men only. Learning to embrace changing a tradition while keeping the essence of their culture the same is a powerful message in the progress of a people - a new story that can be passed down for generations to come.",1327708800,2,3811,4.7207207207207205

1917516,2,B0000CABBW,"The normally impeccable Roger Ebert said ""The genius of the movie is the way is sidesteps all of the obvious cliches of the underlying story and makes itself fresh, observant, tough and genuinely moving."" He was not alone in extolling the virtues of this film. At Rottentomatoes, it currently maintains a 90% ripe rating. How did the critical community get this so wrong? Contrary to Ebert's claim, Whale Rider is brimming with cliches, is absent a single genuine observation, and is unable to provoke any real emotions. It is a very bad film.

Whale Rider tells the story of Pai, a 12-year-old Maori girl whose lineage traces back to Paikea, the whale rider. According to Maori tradition, the male in this line of descendants is supposed to inherit leadership. However, Pai's twin brother died at birth, leaving only her. Koro, her grandfather, is the current leader and is adamant that she cannot lead the tribe, that the appropriate tradition must be followed, and that only a male may inherit the role of tribal leader. You can guess where this goes. Pai and Koro struggle. Fate is on her side; the film makes her future ascension clear, and the only mystery is when.

Formulas are not always bad. Casablanca, for example, provides little in the way of surprise. But Whale Rider fails in two spectacular ways. First, it seems unaware of its utter predictability and mediocrity and strives for a tone and look of elevated art. Pretentious shots of whales and water are common, despite their utter vacuity. And second, Koro's character is so despicable that the struggle between tradition and modernity, between Pai and him, is emotionally anemic. We are supposed to understand Koro despite his obdurate adherence to tradition and sympathize with his position even if we disagree. But we don't. We simply despise him for being obstinate and unfeeling and wish that Pai would curse him and leave. Since this is the main thread of the story, its maladroit execution ruins the entire film. At the end, I was actually more sorry for Pai than I was during the rest of the film; however, I also resented her for her own stodgy adherence to tribal traditions (despite the ""subversiveness"" of a female leader). More than anything, however, I felt relieved that I had finally finished the film.

I should note that there is one exceptional element to the film: the acting of Keisha Castle-Hughes. She is charming and amazing. Her performance, unfortunately, is wasted. Just as the stars are dimmed by the distracting lights of the city, so her performance is dimmed by the distracting spectacle of bad story telling.

Final say: Critical opinion was very wrong about this film. It is a poorly executed and poorly written film. There are many superior versions of this story; stream one of those and leave Whale Rider alone.",1327190400,2,2816,4.884937238493724
1917517,5,B0000CABBW,"I've shown this movie to one or more of my classes probably a dozen times and it's still enjoyable.

The story is set among a group of Maori in present-day New Zealand. The two main characters are the chief of this group (""Paka"") and his troublesome 13-year old granddaughter (""Pai""). The grandfather loves Pai as a granddaughter but also blames her for ""the troubles,"" which he believes started the night she was born. (Her brother, who should have become the heir, died at birth, as did the mother; the father, Paka's eldest son, was so distraught that he fled New Zealand and established himself as an up-and-coming artist in Europe -- abandoning his people, in Paka's view.)

From the beginning, Pai shows unusual talents and interest in ""the old ways,"" but Paka cannot see it because of his obsession with a male heir. At one point he gives up on his family and starts a school to find the potential heir among the first-born sons of the tribe -- with rather unpredictable results. If Amazon had a 6 star rating, I'd give this movie 6.

The casting of this movie is brilliant. The conflict between Paka and Pai sizzles and the supporting characters (notably Paka's wife and Paka's two sons, the father and the uncle) are brilliant. Even the walk-on characters, like the other tribe members and the boys who attend the school are great.

The scenery is fabulous and the story unfolds in a beautiful way. The movie is enjoyable on so many levels -- as good entertainment, as an inspiring story, as an interesting perspective on a different culture, or as a story on the generational conflict, families, and love.",1326240000,8,1615,4.716312056737588

1917525,4,B0000CABBW,"I can get rather insulted when I read reviews from people who are too ignorant to fully assess the meaning of a film before they make a blanket statement that really doesn't apply whatsoever.  It's infuriating because you can tell that the individual taking the time out of their day to review and persuade others of their opinion don't even really have a legitimate opinion because they don't really understand what they are talking about.  That isn't to say that someone who doesn't like this movie is wrong (I don't particularly love it either) but if you are going to discredit something you should be able to give a legitimate reason as to WHY you don't like it; right?

So if you make a statement like `if you hate men this is the flick for you' you better be able to back that up with a reason as to why this film promotes the hatred of men.  But, Nor (yes, you), you missed the point of this film entirely (although I will credit you with at least raising the concern that this film is predictable, and you are right since it does take the `politically correct route' as you state, but please think your thoughts thoroughly for you make claims that hold no weight and make your entire review lose authenticity).

`Whale Rider' is not a film set to diss tradition, nor is it a man hating bash against the elderly committed to their heritage.  `Whale Rider' is a beautifully told tale of a young New Zealander named Pai who is seeking love and affections and mutual respect from her grandfather.  Pai is facing great obstacles when dealing with the man.  Being practically raised by her grandparents after a fatal birthing leaves her twin brother and her mother dead, and her father emotionally unstable, Pai has faced a resentment from her grandfather for saddling him with unwanted responsibility.  Although she was considered a burden, he grew to love her.  But, due to traditions, Pai could not be groomed for future leadership (a privilege exclusively for firstborn males) and so when Pai attempts to train as well, her grandfather begins to fall back into his resentful feelings towards her.

While I am not one to wholly embrace the overabundance of `girl power' (not because I don't believe in strong females or their empowerment but because I don't feel that Hollywood ever gives the subject any real dignity), I must say that `Whale Rider' understands how to make the subject feel heartfelt and moving.  That has a lot to do with the powerful performance given by Keisha Castle-Hughes.  She really delivers a wallop of a performance; one with depth (her eyes are so piercing) and just purity of soul.  She never forces it, for every emotion spills with a feeling of genuineness.

When she cries, you cry.

In the end I must say that `Whale Rider' is a beautifully made film.  It does have a predictability about it and an overwhelming feeling of manipulated emotions, especially on the outset, but they are never gratuitous and never take away from the overall impact of the film; in fact, in a way they aid it.",1313971200,2,3027,4.670433145009416

The Whale Rider

Whale Rider review
The movie starts off with a girl speaking of a man that rode into the village on a whale. His son was to be the next chief but instead a girl was born and the twin boy died taking their mother. Her name was Paikea. She belonged to the Whangara people on the coast of New Zealand. Her grandfather resented her at first but then changed his mind as she got older. Her father was absent throughout her life because of the devastation of his losses. These people believe they are all descendents of the man that rode the whale to shore. They all rode the whale in.  As the movie continues and Pai's dad comes back he brings news that he found another woman and they are expecting a child. Her koro which is her grandfather is supposed to find a male leader to lead the tribe out of darkness and believed Pai's brother was the one. She leaves to live with her dad so her grandfather decides to get all the first born sons together to try and find a leader. As they leave for the airport Pai decides to stay. Her grandfather will not include her in the training to be a leader but her family does. While swimming she finds the emblem of the whale rider. When Pai calls for the whales they came but they were beached and dying. When the people could not save them Pai went out and rode the ancestors whale out and the rest of the living beached whales followed them back out to sea. When she comes back and lives she becomes the leader.
 This movie relates to world religions because it is that of a primal religion. They have their own beliefs such as being brought by a whale and they do not wear shoes in most places. They have special ways of greeting each other and practice traditions in ancient languages. The people believe more in spiritual aspects and of the world around them rather than a god. They believe in a tradition.  They believe in ancestors watch over them and will be there for them.  They also chant and dance and pray.",1303603200,,1987,4.316353887399464
1917529,4,B0000CABBW,"I really liked this movie. I thought it was a cute movie, and a family movie. I think this movie is a great movie to teach young girls about traditional gender roles, ""girl power"", and also for parents to learn about accepting and embracing our children for who they really are or aspire to be.

This movie is about a young girl named Pai (Paikea). Her twin brother who died at birth (along with their mom) was supposed to be the next leader of the tribe. Her dad left her and went to Europe to pursue his art career with his pregnant girlfriend. It was tradition that the first born males of the family became the next chief. However, her brother died, so they began training a group of boys to find out who would be the next one. Pai secretly trains with them, hiding the whole time because she is a girl.

At the end, her grandpa knows she is supposed to be the next chief. A bunch of whales get stuck on the beach and no one knows what to do with them. Pai is able to ride one of the beached whales back to sea, and the rest follow. Everyone knows she is supposed to be the leader of the tribe, and she deserves it.

This movie has a lot of examples of indigenous religions. For example, they are very connected with nature and respect it. Also they have chiefs which are common in indigenous religions. It also seems to be a very male-dominated world that she lives in, which is common in indigenous religions. Also, they chant, sing, have oral history through the telling of stories, and calling on spirits.",1303603200,,1513,4.320422535211268
1917530,5,B0000CABBW,"When I first came to this movie, I thought it was going to be like Free Willy. Honestly, the poster showing a happy young girl with a whale, and the movie being called Whale Rider...I was expecting a bunch of hokey Free Willy type stuff. But boy was I wrong.

First off, the Maori culture is an amazing thing, it has always fascinated me and I wish I had seen this movie earlier to appreciate it at a younger age. But, as it is, I don't mind just now seeing it. Cliff Curtis was a welcome addition to the cast, but the rest were all unknowns to the typical Western viewer. Keisha Castle-Hughes was brilliant in this movie, providing a performance that rivals many Oscar-nominated young actors in Hollywood. I was blown away at the wisdom and emotion this young girl brought to the movie, and she held it together when I was ready to give it up in frustration to Rawiri Paratene's cruel grandfather role.

The overall theme of the movie is hard to follow if you are not familiar with how indigenous religions are; it might end up seeming silly to you that this much effort to carry on a legacy about a man coming from a distant land on the back of a whale and having a spiritual connection to the beasts, if you are not familiar.",1303603200,3,1228,4.334782608695652

1917533,4,B0000CABBW,"I found the Whale Rider a movie the entire family would enjoy.  It is about the Maori tribe, an indigenous tribe living in New Zealand.  The story is about the Maori leader Koro, trying to save the sacred ways of his ancestors.  Koro expected his eldest son to be the next leader, but Porourangi did not want to follow in Koro footsteps.  Koro had hoped when Porourangi's wife became pregnant with twins a boy and girl.  Unfortunately the mother and the boy died, and the baby girl was named Paikea.  Koro was furious this was the sacred name of their ancestor, the boy who rode on the back of a whale's tale to save the village.  This name was not to be given to a female.  Koro, only thought is his son can have more children, another son.  Koro, showed no love for Pail kea when she was born.  Pai, (her name was shorten by Koro), was left to be raised by Koro and her Granny, and eventually Koro's heart soften towards her.
When Porourangi returns home for a visit, Koro think he is back, but learns he will soon be leaving to go back to Germany to be with his new girlfriend who is pregnant.  Koro argues with him about his responsibility to be the next leader and to teach the boys in the village.  The argument gets heated and Pai over hears Koro, tell Porourangi to take Pai, she is useless to him.  Porourangi explains to Pai, that Koro, wanted him to be the next leader, but what he wants no longer exist.  Porourangi ask Pai to come back to Germany with him.  When they are leaving Pai experiences a connection to the ocean and the whales, but doesn't know what it means.  She tells Porourangi she has to go back.
In his efforts to keep the sacred ways alive Koro tells Granny he needs all of the first born boys, so he can start a sacred school to teach them the sacred ways and to teach them to be chiefs.  He feels all of their problems started when Pai was born.  The boys are taught how to fight with a Taihai and all the sacred chants.  Pai learns the chants and how to use the Taihai by spying on the classes.  When Koro finds out what she is doing he accuses her of disrespecting the sacred ways.  One of the initiations to find out who would be chief was to take the boys out on the ocean in a boat and throw the whales' tooth that Koro wore around his neck into the water.  The one who brought it back would be chief.  When no one retrieved the bone, Koro he blames Pai, for her interference in the sacred ways.  He does not know the Pai, when out on the boat with her uncle retrieved the tooth.
Koro feels hopeless, he calls on the ancestor for help, but they do not answer, Pai, calls out to the ancestors and they answer.  The answer is the beaching of whales, one which is the whale of their ancestor Paikea.  The village tries to save the whales, but can't, when Pai, tries to help, Koro tells her to go away, she done enough.  When everyone realizes then can do no more, they walk away.  Pai, touches the whale and they become one in spirit.  Pai rides the whale into the ocean, it is then when Granny gives him the tooth and he say ""which one"", she say"" what do you mean which one"", it is then that he realizes she is the chosen one.  Paikea, eventually takes her place as leader, but I would suggest to all to rent or buy this movie.  It is one you will watch more than once.",1296345600,,3304,4.180379746835443

1917536,4,B0000CABBW,"The Whale Rider is a film that is about the Maori's cultures and traditions and about how the Maori people are trying to fit into the modern world that exists today. Pai is the young girl and she is faced with many challenges in this movie. She is a wonderful girl who has a great personality but she is hated by the males that surround her because there was an accident and her male twin died but she lived. According to culture the first born will become chief if he is male. Pai feels like she has let down her tribe because she survived the accident and because she is female. She believes that everyone would love her if she was male. Also that everyone wishes that she would have died instead of her male twin. Drama plagues the young girl when her grandpa is being very difficult when her twin brother dies and he treats the girl very harshly as if saying that he wished she would have passed away and her brother would had lived so that he could be chief and pass on the family name and make the grandpa and the whole other family proud by making things better for the life of the tribe's people. The Maori people believe that their ancestors have lived on the land that they now live on for over a thousand years. Pai is a girl who is filled with happiness and glows. Everyone around loves her for her upbeatness. Everyone except her grandfather who shows her no mind because he is too busy being depressed because Pai's twin who was a male and who was suppose to be the chief had died when he was born. The males around Pai have made her feel so bad because she lived and her male twin died. Overall this is a great movie for people of all ages. It encourages young females to never give up and to always chase their dreams.
This movie relates to world religions because this tribe in the movie relates to indigenous people and the native people. They are a tribe that inhabits the very same land that they believe their ancestors once lived on. Their culture and traditions were passed on from their ancestors and they still live this way of life even though they are faced with the common issues that modern day society throws at them.",1283644800,,2147,4.343283582089552
1917537,3,B0000CABBW,"Whale rider is an interesting movie that takes a glimpse into the world of the Maori people. The Maori are an indigenous people that live in New Zealand. Whale Rider centers on a chief (Koro) that is filled with disappointment because his son Porourangi doesn't want to follow in his footsteps and become the next chief of the tribe.  Hope is found when Porourangi's wife becomes pregnant with twins, a boy and a girl. The boy and the mother die during child birth, but the girl lives and is named Piakea by her father. This is a sacred name to Koro and in his anger shortens the child's name to Pai. Porourangi is in grief and goes to Europe leaving Pai to be raised by her grandparents.  Pai knows about her grandfather's disappointment as she grows up but in time they do form a bond.  Nanny Flowers who is Pai's grandmother adores the child and raises her as her on.
 Porourangi returns home and refuses to take his place as the next chief and offers to take Pai back to Germany with him, she goes but soon turns around to go back.  In an attempt to find the next chief Koro rounds up all the 12 year old boys and starts to teach them the sacred ways of the tribe. His hope is through all the chants and lessons the next chief will emerge from the group. When Koro finds out Pai has been listening in on the lessons he is enraged. Nanny Flowers then tells Pai that Koro's other son was a fighting stick champion; Pai is intrigued and starts taking lessons from him. After a battle with another boy that Pai wins Koro explodes with anger causing a rift between himself and Pai. Koro drops a whale tooth in the water in hopes that the future chief will retrieve it; after everybody fails Koro loses hope.
 In an attempt to help their relationship Pai invites Koro to a play at the school, Pai has something special planned for Koro. Running late Koro notices a number of beached whales on the way to the school. The village attempts to coax the whales back into the ocean with no luck. Pai is then yelled at by Koro for touching the largest whale and tells her she had done enough damage. After Koro walks away Pai climbs on the back of the largest whale and gets him back into the ocean. The other whales follow but in the process Pai nearly drowns.  Koro sees this and is handed the lost whale tooth that Pai had retrieved, Koro breaks down.  At the hospital Koro declares Pai the future chief of the village which is the first for a female. The movie finishes with the entire village pushing a newly finished waka into the ocean to celebrate the new chief.
This movie was intriguing as it showed the daily culture of the Maori people and the struggle that comes with an ingenious tribe. Starting off the movie really gets you involved with the struggles of Pai and her father over the death of Pai's mother and her twin brother. This is where the movie becomes a clash between modern times and ancient traditions. With the grandfather so persistent to find his next replacement, Pai seems to be overlooked and despised because she lived instead of her brother, who would have been the first born grandson. Even when Pai showed excitement and willingness to learn the chiefly ways she was cast aside because she was a girl. This all changed when Pai who never gave up, rode the biggest whale back into the ocean and nearly drowned. This action saved the ways of the tribe and helps the tribe move in the right direction by making Pai the new chief.  This movie showed me the power of being persistent and never giving up, that one child can in fact change the world.",1283644800,,3570,4.413373860182371
1917538,5,B0000CABBW,"Whale Rider is a great movie, well worth watching, it takes you in a magnificent journey with Paikea, a young Maori girl, as she learn the Maori traditional sacred way to become the next clan leader, a role reserved for men.

Paikea is the descendant of the Whale Rider, in their tribe the chief's first born son becomes the next leader, sadly Paikea twin brother, died during his birth. She now try to become the next tribe leader, a traditionally men role within their tribe, her grand-father (Rawiri Paratene), Koro who's currently the tribe leader, and who lives by the ancient ways does not agree. Koro then decide to open a cultural school in order to form the next tribe leader, and asks all the first born sons of the tribe to attend those lessons and forbid Paikea to participate. Hemi (Mana Taumaunu), a boy sympathetic toward Paikea and the most likely candidate to become next tribe leader, is caught teaching Paikea how to use the Taiaha, at this moment Koro starts to think that Paikea might be the reason for the tribe misfortune. Aware of Koro refusal to teach Paikea the old ways her grand-mother (Vicky Haughton) takes upon Paikea's learning of the old ways. Paikea then ask her uncle Riwiki (Grant Roa) to teach her how to perform the Haka, and how to use the Taiaha, a sacred weapon in the Maori culture. Paikea sneaks into the school to learn the sacred chants taught to the boys by Koro, chants that he will use later to call upon the Whale spirit to help his tribe. Seeing no answer from the spirits Paikea then use the chants to call upon the spirits herself. Getting ready to attend Paikea's school play Koro finds many whales on the beach, he is then convince that Paikea is the reason for the tribe misfortune.  Seeing Paikea riding the biggest whale back to the ocean Koro then realize his mistake and acknowledge Paikea as the next tribe leader.

This movie contains many sacred ways from the Maori people that can also be found in many other indigenous cultures around the world. Such as the animal spirit who is often used as a guide is present in this movie as the whale, the initiation that the young boys must go through to become the next leader, the sacred chants used to pass down knowledge from generation to generation, the prayers to their ancestors and the dances present in many indigenous cultures.

Whale Rider directed by Niki Caro is a movie based on Witi Ihimaera book that will take you into a journey with Paikea (Keisha Castle-Hughes) the latest descendant of Paikea, the whale rider, he who rode the whale spiritual guide of their tribe from Hawaiki. Director Niki Caro did a magnificent job with the cast of this movie; we believe and feel Paikea joy, pain and sadness throughout the movie. He also gives us a glimpse look at the Maori sacred ways.",1283558400,,2800,4.616465863453815

It brings to the general viewing audience a tale about the ancient Maori people and solidified in my mind how great people like the venerable Maori soprano, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, really are to have made it in the face of great odds.
But what I think would have brought tears to a stone was the tenacity of the love which the central character, Paika, had for her grandfather (her true father figure), Koro, despite all his efforts to discount her and the great value she brought to that relationship. And that is a struggle so many of us have, the struggle of a child to gain the approval of a parent. Some give up, but she never did, and they both gained. It is a redemptive tender story which I recommend highly.",1269907200,,761,4.442857142857143
1917541,5,B0000CABBW,"I've heard good things about 2002's ""Whale Rider"" for years and put off seeing it, likely because it appeared to be some type of trite Disney flick with a kid (or kids) winning at a competition against all odds, etc. (not that there's anything wrong with that), but that's not what this film's about at all. ""Whale Rider"" is a serious drama with a very spiritual & moving air and realistic tone.

THE PLOT: A small tribe of Maori in modern-day New Zealand believe their presence there dates back a thousand years or more to a single ancestor, Paikea, who escaped death when his canoe capsized by riding to shore on the back of a whale. From then on chiefs of the Whangara tribe have been Paikea's direct descendants, always the first-born and always male. There is reoccurring evidence that Pai, an 11-year-old girl in a patriarchal culture, is destined to be the new chief. But her grandfather Koro is bound by tradition and stubbornness and insists on choosing a male leader. Pai loves Koro more than anyone in the world, but she must convince him and fight a thousand years of tradition for her calling to come to pass.

""Whale Rider"" is an independent film with none of the trappings of modern blockbusters; the story is dialogue-driven, slow and not all that eventful, which can of course throw off those used to a steady diet of the latter. Take note before watching.

I'll be perfectly honest with you, ""Whale Rider"" was a veritable religious experience for me. I had the DVD lying around for a few weeks and then one day I just knew the time was right: I put it in, not really intending to watch the entire film, and I was captivated from beginning to end (just over an hour and a half without credits). I was in a very spiritually-sensitive mode and literally cried through about 70% of it. The movie actually spoke to me in a sense, if you know what I mean, and I received clear direction in one area of searching/need. Don't dismiss this on the grounds that I'm some sentimental whack job; I'm just a regular dude.

The thematic clash of the film is not granddaughter against grandfather but rather truth v.s. traditionalism, spirit of the law v.s. letter of the law, and true calling v.s. stubborn opposition.

There's also an interesting sub-theme about a culture losing its identity and languishing in drugs/alcohol, crime and meaningless despondency. How can they, as individuals and as a people, escape this? They must know their identity -- who they ARE.

Some have criticized the film as too predictable, but I'd rather watch ""Whale Rider"" and it's predictable play-it-straight plot than moronic 'twist' films like ""A Perfect Getaway"" (2009) where the story is essentially a lie, leaving the viewer feeling hoodwinked and ripped-off. ""Whale Rider"" is refreshingly honest by comparison. Besides, 'twist' plots have become so common that playing it straight is now 'cutting edge.'

Keisha Castle-Hughes, who plays Pai, is precious.

The film was shot on the North Island of New Zealand (Whangara, Gisborne & Taupo, Waikato). It was directed/written by Niki Caro from Witi Ihimaera's book.

FINAL WORD: If what I've said piques your interest don't miss out on ""Whale Rider."" But wait for the right moment when you know you'll be receptive to such a reverent piece. It will move you and maybe even speak to you.

1917543,2,B0000CABBW,"The beginning of the movie starts out with Porourangi standing by his wife as she gives birth to two children.  Unfortunately, both the wife and son die, leaving a girl behind.  The grandfather, Koro, is upset because he was hoping the boy would be the new village chief since his own son Porourangi wasn't interested. To make matters worse Porourangi gives the child the same name as the legend Paikea, who rode on the back of an ancient whale bringing their ancestors to New Zealand. Koro is furious, because he knows a girl could never have the right to become what her brother would have been, the new chief. He says he wants nothing to do with her.

The next scene is when Paikea is older and attending middle school.  Despite her grandfather's anger, we see her riding on a bicycle with him. Her name has been shortened to Pai and she has been raised by her grandfather and his wife Nanny since her dad left her to go to Europe to pursue a career as an artist. Her father comes back to the village though for a visit. Father and son embrace closely in the way of the Maori, by touching noses. Anger erupts though when Koro learns that Porourangi is expecting a child with a woman he met in Germany. Porourangi asks Pai to return to Europe with him, but she changes her mind as they're leaving.

Pai knows that Koro is always looking down at her as unworthy and he seems to stay angry with her through most of the movie. Despite his attitude though she feels that she is meant to be the leader of the village, and tries desperately to prove this to Koro. We are constantly seeing the self determination in Pai set against Koro's inability to question his beliefs. She loves her grandfather, but she also has the courage to speak through her actions, in an attempt to show him that she is the future of the tribe.

Koro disciplining Pai is something that occurs over and over, especially when she is interfering with his goals of finding a new leader among the boys of the village. In one scene they are working on the engine of an old boat and Koro explains how the twines of the rope used to start the engine together represent the strength of their ancestors. When the rope breaks Koro goes off to find a new one and Pai re-ties it and starts the engine. This angers Koro and he reprimands her.

Koro decides to form a cultural school for the village boys, hoping to find a new leader. Pai secretly follows the lessons and with the help of her uncle Rawiri learns how use a fighting stick. Her grandfather, once again is enraged when he finds out. As a final test for the boys to see who will become chief, Koro takes them out to a spot in the ocean and tosses his whale tooth necklace into the ocean. The boy who retrieve's it will become the new leader of the future. Unfortunately none of the boys are able to bring it back and this causes Koro to fall into a great state of depression.

Uncle Rawiri, returns to the spot in the ocean that the necklace was thrown into with Pai. She jumps in, and returns not only with the necklace, but also a lobster. She didn't seem to realize what it meant to find the whale tooth necklace only that it would make her grandfather happy again.
.
The climax of the film then takes place at a school ceremony, where Pai is honored for winning an essay contest. She wrote about the pride and love she has for her grandfather.  Koro wasn't there when it began and he got even more delayed when he found himself on the beach when he discovered whales stranded in the sand. The whole village tries to keep the whales alive, especially the largest one. They try using a rope and tractor to turn it towards the ocean in the hopes that it would be able to swim.  The rope snaps though and they decide to give up. Pai stays behind though and climbs up on top of the whale. The giant creature finds the strength to push itself back into the water with Pai on its back. Nanny realizes that Pai is no longer with them and the whale is gone. The crowd is immediately overcome with horror. They finally see her on the back of the whale, riding up and down in the water like the ancestors of long ago did. The water eventually overcomes her and she is forced to let go. The next scene shows her in the hospital with Koro by her side asking for forgiveness. He has finally acknowledged that she is the ""wise leader"".  She opens her eyes and smiles.

The final scene shows the canoe that Pai frequently went to when she needed to be by herself. The villagers were pushing it together, towards the ocean with Koro and Pai sitting in the center.",1264982400,,4571,4.339578454332552
1917544,4,B0000CABBW,"The movie Whale Rider is about a young girl named Pai who lives in a small Maori village with her grandparents after her mother and twin brother die in childbirth and her father leaves to travel around the world.  Pai's twin brother was supposed to be the next leader of their village and his death causes Pai's grandfather, Koro, much distress.  After realizing that there is no hope for another grandson, Koro begins to train the first-born males in the village in the traditions of their people.  Pai desires to learn with the boys, but Koro does not allow this, as only males can be chief.  Pai is not discouraged and turns to her uncle for help.  After all the boys in the village fail the final tasks of retrieving Koro's whale's tooth from the ocean, he becomes very depressed and feels there is little hope of finding a new leader for his people.  Koro calls to the spirits for help, as does Pai because she cannot stand to see her grandfather depressed.  Soon the spirits answer and send the whales that help bring their ancestor Paikea to help.  The whales become beached and the village people attempt to help them back into the ocean but are unable to.  Pai however communes with the leader whale's spirit and climbs atop him to try to convince him to go back to sea, as her ancestor had done.  The whale responds and swims back to sea, with Pai atop, a vision of the Maori ancestor Paikea is seen by the villagers.  Koro then realizes Pai's destiny as the next chief and accepts her for who she is.
 This movie relates to World Religions because it demonstrates many aspects of indigenous cultures through the Maori village.  The movie shows the importance of family and heritage to the people.  It also shows the importance that the Maori placed on their beliefs in the spirits as helpers.  The whale spirits showed the village who the next chief was, when they were unable to see it.  The movie displays traditional ceremonies, such as the one at the end with the dancing and chanting.  The education and initiation process for the new chief of the village is also shown in the movie, and most indigenous cultures have some form of education and initiation of the spiritual leaders for the next generation.  The movie also shows how important the customs are to the people.  There is also insight into how the modern world is influencing and changing the indigenous people.  During the movie, many of the women smoked which was a big issue to Pai.  Also, some of the Maori people had abandoned their traditional ways and moved away or joined gangs.  This is causing generational gaps and history is being lost.

1917545,5,B0000CABBW,"In a native Maori New Zealand tribe, a set of twins are born into a long line of chiefs, the boy being the one  destined to carry on the lineage of warriors, but fate takes a hand and alters the future. Both mother and her newborn son die shortly after the birth and a baby girl is left behind to fulfill a legacy. The father, too distraught over the loss of his wife and newborn son leaves his daughter in his parents' care. From the moment she was born Paikea was a reminder to her grandfather Koro that there was no male to carry on generations of Maori chiefs. Paikea struggles to convince her grandfather that she does not have to be a male to be a great leader and that she is the one who is meant to carry on the tradition and will lead their people forward into the future. Her father returns home with news that he is an expectant father and asks Paikea to go back to Germany with him. When she hears the distant sounds of the whales, it was a call to turn around and go home to her village. Still she was unable to stir emotion in her sober-faced grandfather. When Koro gathers a group of young boys for training to seek out the next one who was to be the leader, Paikea seizes the opportunity to prove herself worthy to her grandfather. Koro refuses to see her as anything other than a 12 year old girl. She only succeeds in angering him further in her futile attempts to become a fighter. Koro's spirit is broken when neither of the two potential boys who were chosen to find the whale's tooth he tosses overboard is able to deliver. Paikea, who senses her grandfather's pain and disappointment, takes it upon herself to call to the ancestors when Koro's attempts fail. Paikea tests her faith once again when she invites her grandfather to a school production only to leave heartbroken with trophy in hand and tears in her eyes. There is a very strong sense of tradition, family, togetherness and spirituality that bonds the people of the Maori tribe. They are an indigenous group of people that all bans together for celebrations and share a close knit relationship and profound belief in their heritage and rituals. Their primal instincts give them the strength of one and a true sense of brotherhood. When  the next morning comes the village is awoken in horror at the sight of multiple beached whales on the shore.  In her final, desperate attempt, young Paikea risks her life and sets out to prove once and for all that she is brave and can be a great leader. She is determined to fulfill her destiny in spite of the odds, ready to join the ranks of her ancestors and become the next generation Whale Rider.",1264636800,,2624,4.428571428571429
1917546,4,B0000CABBW,"This coming of age story follows the incredible and abstract Paikea. The sole survivor of her birth, she left behind her mother, and twin brother who would have been the next chief of the Maori tribe in New Zealand. The story jumps right into the disapproval of her grandfather, the chief of their tribe, who feels little hope, and very little want for Paikea, immediately after Paikea's father leaves the tribe. The story follows Paikea through her late adolescent years, watching as she, despite her gender, intends to be the person or prophet her grandfather is looking for, the person he feels he lost with when her twin brother died at birth. Through trial and error, and much shunning from her grandfather's presence Paikea teaches herself the ""old ways"" and learns how to become chief of the Maori tribe, with the assistance of a young male friend, her grandmother, and her black sheep uncle. Paikea learns the ways of the warrior, her heritage, and the ways needed to connect with her ancestors, in order to win her grandfather's attention and trust, and continually fails miserably.
This movie focuses much on the idea of indigenous sacred ways from myth-based religions of early native tribes. The sole idea of the tribe, is that a warrior Paikea, for which our young heroine Paikea was named, saved their tribe when they traveled to New Zealand. He was tired and scared, but was then able to catch a ride upon the back of the whale and came to their new destination to live. Paikea's twin brother, being the first born son of the first born son of the chief was intended to fill the role of chief and ""whale rider"". Throughout the movie, you are able to see the greetings in which people of this tribe greet each other, mimicking the breath of a whale into each other's face, rather than a hug or a kiss. You can see native body art, and dress, and see the hierarchy that exists between all of the tribe. But I think the most incredible of these sacred ways is the way that they turn to their ancestors, who are now embodied as whales, for guidance.
I was skeptical when renting it, but very pleased at my choice. This movie kept me captivated, both with suspense of what would come next, and with the heart strings it pulled at throughout the movie. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.",1264636800,,2308,4.618004866180049

The acting is superb.  A wonderful change from some of the crap we see in movies these days.,1255219200,,255,3.9607843137254903
1917550,4,B0000CABBW,"The whale rider is a movie possibly placed in New Zealand based on the language accent I heard in the movie and by seeing the kitchen tapestry with New on it. The plot has to do with a Patriach/Chief of the village towns people wanting desperately to follow in the sacred spiritual ways of the spiritual ancestors and fulfill his duty of passing the history of the people and the responsibility of leading the people to an heir preferably a male.  He is set in his ways and tradition and doing so with such a tunnel vision perspective that in his attempts to fulfill this leadership void he fails to see the special gifts and destiny of his grandaughter a true bloodline decendant of Paikea.
The chief's name is Koro and he has pushed his eldest son so hard in trying to get him to accept this role and responsibility to the point of running his son away from the village and the people.  The son's wife died in childbirth while delivering fraternal twins where the male child died with the mother but the female lived.  The female child was named Paikea nicknamed Pai.  This is where Koro believes the trouble starts.  Koro loves his granddaughter however, with many of the world's customs unfortunately the men tend to make the women take back seats to the males and this is very unfortunate.  Koro rejects the idea of his grandaughter being the next spiritual leader even though she is of the bloodline of their ancestors and well God Paikea.  Tradition says that Koro has to pick a male.  Koro attempts to school several young boys in the ways of the ancestors and they failed so Koro has failed. All the while Paikea is trying to tell Koro, in her actions, she believes she is the next chief.  She even retrieves the chiefs well tooth that he throws in the ocean for the boy trainees to retrieve to show themselves brave, strong and approved by the ancestors.  Pai actually retrieves it and summons the ancestral whale Gods for help.  They listened and came to her aid even after Koro, in a state of failure and distress, failed to do so.
 A pod of whales supposedly beached themselves but they were actually an opportunity for Koro to see that Pai had spiritual power and connection to get the entire herd back into the sea. Koro saw Pai riding the whale and then he believed.  This movie also showed the breakdown of predjudiceness, tradition, and familiarity with love, determination, diligence and destiny.  Pie helped to heal her people and her father returned home.  This movie relates to world religion by showing how tribes and cultures have continued ancient ways and beliefs in connecting with those whom have passed on. They have given them power and spiritual significance by labeling them supreme beings.  This significance and power have also transcended to the peoples every day lives.  World religions have taught people that the ancestors are in control of their everyday lives and futures and that the ancestors should be respected and consulted for directions.  In the Whale rider the supreme being was Paikea ironically the same name of the girl descendant and main character of the movie.  Pai, even though at the end of the movie proclaims that she is not a prophet (probably at the behest of Koro), does in a way assume the role of a Shaman.  Not that of a medicine woman but that of a healer because Pai healed her people.",1252195200,,3351,4.647457627118644
1917551,3,B0000CABBW,"For my assignment I decided to watch The Whale Rider. After reading a brief synopsis on the movie I figured it sounded interesting enough, and decided to watch it. The movie is set in an old Maori Village in New Zealand.  The Maori tribe believed that their ancestors arrived on a whale. The whale is seen by the Maori tribe as sacred and wise. They pray to them and look to them for guidance.  One of the leading characters is a little girl who lives with her grandparents. Pai's twin brother and mother died at birth, so only Pai was left. This deeply disturbed her grandfather who was distraught because her brother was to become chief one day and be the new leader of the tribe. It was as if he blamed Pai for the death of her brother. Pai's father left and went to travel the world, leaving Pai behind with her grandparents. Although the years following Pai's birth, her and her grandfather developed a relationship, she always knew her grandfather still resented her for her brother's death. Pai's father returns for a visit and to the families surprise has a begun a relationship with another woman who is now carrying his child. He and his father get in a fight over bringing them to New Zealand. He insists they will stay in Germany where the mother is from, and to make his father even madder, he tells him they will probably be having a girl. He tells him to take the girl with him (meaning Pai) so he decides Pai is to go with him. Pai reluctantly goes, but does not get very far before she makes her dad turn around and take her back. Meanwhile, her grandfather has decided the tribe has been cursed since the arrival of Pai, and decided he is going to get all of the first born sons of the tribe together, so he can train them, and choose one to be a leader. When Pai returns, hoping her grandfather will be happy she is back, she discovers he is not too happy to see her. Her grandfather starts teaching and training the young boys to see who will be the next leader. Pai stays close, always watching and trying to learn, hoping to get her grandfather's approval. She gets her uncle to train her, but soon is discovered when her and one of the little boys are caught by her grandfather sparring. He of course is none too happy and scolds both of them.  He takes the group of boys out in the ocean (all but the one he scolded) and throws his whale tooth necklace in the water and tells them whoever can bring it back will be the new leader. None of them succeed and the grandfather is crushed. He is deeply depressed and disappointed, and having Pai around seems to make things worse, so her grandmother decides she should go stay with her uncle for a little while. Pai decided to pray to the gods for help, and little does she know they will answer in a big way. While out in the boat one day with her uncle, she decides she is going to get her grandfather's necklace back, and she does. Her uncle gives it to his mother, who decided it is not the right time to give it to him. Pai has a concert at school that she hopes her grandfather will attend because she has named him her hero, on his way there he looks out on to the beach and sees that there are a lot of whales that have beached themselves on the sand. All of the tribe tries to get them back into the ocean, but only fail. Pai tries to help, but her grandfather tells her this is her fault and tells her to go away. As the tribe is walking away to take a break, Pai gets on one of the whales and begins to ride it back in the water. People soon realize the whale is gone, but her grandmother also realized Pai is gone, knowing how much she wants her grandfather's approval, she knows Pai is with the whale.  She gives him the whale tooth necklace and he realizes it is Pai that is the chosen one. Next thing you know they are at the hospital waiting for Pai to wake up. While sitting at her bedside, he prays to her, calling her his leader. At the end of the movie the tribe rides off in a boat that was finally finished (they had stopped building it when Pai was born, because the new leader was to lead the ship). Sitting with her grandfather, Pai leads the tribe out to sea.
 One of the key concepts of religion is tradition. All religions revolve around traditions. One of the main themes of this movie was tradition, in the Maori tribe the first born son is to take over as leader of the tribe; this was a tradition that had been passed on from ancestors from many years ago. Along with tradition, there are rules and guidelines that the religions' followers are to adhere to. These rules and guidelines are passed down from ancient ancestors.  The whole movie revolved around this theme. No matter what the religion, there are main themes and concepts. Most religions are started by a group that has similar ideals and beliefs; the Maori tribe was no different. The movie was based on a set of ideals that their ancestors had chosen many years ago, which is a major component in any religion, because of these traditions, ideals, and rules, this movie very much relates to World Religions.",1252195200,,5071,4.321428571428571
1917552,4,B0000CABBW,"Whale Rider involves a young girl, Pai that survived the birth after the passing of her twin brother and mother. Due to being a girl, she is disowned by her grandfather for not being able to obtain the ritual inheritance of the Maori tribe, descendants of the legendary Paikea, who arrived from Hawaaki `riding on a whale'. In desperation for acceptance she sneaks around her grandfather's all male initiation camp to learn the ways of becoming a wise leader. Through her grandfather's failure as ""wise leader"" to pass on his inheritance to any one boy in the camp, the sacred symbol ""whale tooth"" is lost for what he deems forever. Now it's up to the whales to decide who will be the chosen leader.

Out of desperation to be accepted by her grandfather and following descendants, Pai so skillfully calls on the whales in asking for acceptance. A large herd of whales answers by fleeing to the shores of this coastal, fishing community. The whole Maori tribe flees to save these symbolic creatures. The grandfather, still not understanding ""who's to blame"" seeks to remove them from the mainline shore. When all attempts fail by the whole community, Pai finally realizes that her time has come. Through faith of her eternal calling she is given the opportunity to save the whales and the heritage of the Maori tribe; thus turning her grandfather's disregard into acceptance. A very informative film on the customs and rituals many even today still strive to overcome.

In relation to our world religions, it shows the comparison of how male dominance is still such as issue for many beliefs yet how far we've come even in today's society. Norms of marrying within your `tribe or race' is dominant even today as this movie will show. All people of different faiths are striving to become accepted in some form or another. With time and dedication this movie will show the important relations in applying what one can learn to everyday world religions.",1252108800,,1950,4.835329341317365
1917553,4,B0000CABBW,"Nice tale of courage, triumph over adversity, and coming of age. Keisha Castle-Hughes is endearing in her role as the young Pai. She keeps her spirits high and doesn't let even her ultra-grumpy, ultra-traditionalist, anti-girl-power grandfather keep her down. She really does seem like she has a destiny to fulfill. Her tribe needs somebody to ride the whale, which is their ritual tradition the next leader must pass. Problem is she's a she. No dudes there to do it. She's a natural leader and can ride the wale, so like so-what if she's a girl and her being female breaks with tradition? Her tribe and in particular ole grandfather must struggle with this.

1917560,4,B0000CABBW,"I have seen this movie once before, and it was nothing short of inspirational the second time around. The Whangara tribe's faith derives from Paikea, the first Whale Rider. Like many tribal religion, their tribe faces the threats of extinction when the Koro's son fails to give him a male heir to the tribe. Pai, his only daughter, not only faces being orphaned by her father (who left the tribe not being able to face his wife and son's death), but the rejection of her grandfather as the one who would carry on their tribe's legacy. When Pai's father returns, Koro hopes he would become the next chief, but he is gravely disappointed. Pai's father leaves the village once more, this time taking her with him. But, Pai returns. However, Koro continues to become more and more distant towards Pai, believing that she will never be able to fulfill the roles of a Chief in their tribe, even though his wife continues to tell him so. Koro becomes more stressed with the emergence of a beached whale, thinking that it is a sign for the worse. He and the other tribe's people struggle to save its life, but they are unable to. Pai's ability to lead the whale back to safety is finally tested, and with it she gains the title of the Whale Rider, as well as the respect and adoration of Koro.
The Whangara people focus on their ancestral values, animism, and they also embody earth-focused beliefs. This movie not only shows these beliefs in action, but also embodies the struggles that many tribal religions have to face in the world today; movement of their people into the outside world. People leave to find better lives and quickly become accustomed to the lifestyle, never to return to their homes. It also shows the struggle to survive and maintain tradition with the daily threats of the outside world. It is a great movie that enlightens the audience about the many problems faced by people today. However, it still remains deep rooted in the morality and ethics of faith and its existence.",1220400000,,1992,4.661931818181818
1917561,4,B0000CABBW,"Whale Rider is the story of a young girl whose mother and twin brother died at her birth.  This tragedy has profoundly affected her family, which includes her grandfather, who is chief of a long lineage going all the way back to the Maori ancestor called the Whalerider.  Her grandfather is strong but stubborn that only a male can be the next chief.  He cannot look to his two grown sons for this, and so he creates a school to teach the first-born boys in his village the secret ways of the Maori warrior, in hopes that one of them will emerge as the rightful chief.

The movie is slow and drawn-out, and that is why I rated it four stars instead of five.  And, I expected much more at the climax.  The performances, setting, music and acting are outstanding.  The little girl , her character and the actress, is so inspiring for her courage to follow her own path in the face of constant, withering criticism from the one person she wants to please - her grandfather.  Truly, some of the things he says to her are horrible.

I do recommend this film, but younger children might lose interest because of the lack of action.  Also, there is some brief, but very crude and inappropriate ""guy humour"" in one scene at the grandfather's school for boys.

Whale Rider is worth seeing for the outstanding performance of this young girl.  I can't wait to see her future projects.",1214438400,,1373,4.491935483870968

1917563,5,B0000CABBW,"This is a story about the Maori tribe's struggles to carry on their traditions as they have for the past thousand years.  However, when the first born son dies during birth and his twin sister, Pai, survives, it creates much tension in the tribe since females are not allowed to be chief under any circumstances.  She is constantly shunned as an outcast by her grandfather and most of the tribe.  Her grandfather attempts to train their indigenous ways to the other boys while Pai secretly watches from afar.  With minimal help from her uncle and from watching the other boys, she learns all of the traditions and performs better than any of the boys trained by her grandfather.  With the final test, retrieving the whale tooth, the boys each came up empty handed.  While out on the ocean later with her uncle she asks about the tooth and then immediately dives deep to the bottom and finds it much to the dismay of the others.  Her grandmother keeps it from her grandfather knowing it would hurt him further and he would never accept it.  After her performance one evening, they find the beach covered in whales refusing to return to the sea.  Their efforts are useless and Pai, watching from afar, knows why.  As the rest of her people begin to leave, she confronts the largest whale and magically returns it, as well as all the others, to the ocean while riding on its back.  It is at this point her grandfather finally accepts her special powers and abilities to lead their tribe.

Additionally, this movie reflects many aspects of indigenous people and their religions.  The tribe is a very close knit community, typical of many indigenous ways.  Pai's beautiful chanting in the Maori language is magical itself along with her emotional storytelling of her family's past.  While Pai's grandfather is unable to get the spirits to listen to him and guide him, they do listen to Pai and help guide her through this journey.  Pai acts as a shaman with her abilities to return the whales to the ocean.  Other examples are the grandfather teaching the other boys a sacred dance and how to fight with the sticks like a warrior, and his token of a whale.  The many references to the whales guiding the family are made even with them preventing Pai from moving to Germany with her father.  The clash between the tribe's indigenous ways and modern influences are also apparent especially with Pai's father moving away to pursue his artistic talents, thus, leaving his parents to raise her.",1204934400,,2484,4.708333333333333
1917564,5,B0000CABBW,"The Whale Rider is fundamentally a beautiful and sad rendition of what happens to men and women when their culture is overcome by a more complex and expanding new culture. What makes this film special is the certainty of the love among all the generations in the community and family, even when individuals are making bad mistakes in how they treat each other. No matter these mistakes, the deep love remains and somehow enriches everyone's lives.

There is a feminist message in the story, but not a bitter, 'men are the enemy' one. There is also a message of how destructive the decline of a traditional culture is to men, how it degrades them and leaves them struggling to maintain honor and decency. All of this is easily accessible to children and adults, and reinforced with magnificent Maori carvings and symbols.

The actors are so exceptional that they do not seem at any time to be actors. You expect that like neighbors they will come knock on your door for tea or coffee, or just to take a walk on the beautiful and yet often gray and cold beaches. You care what happens to these people who seem so real.

This is an international story, a common human story intermigled with the lives of whales in a spiritual and practical way. The resolution of the film is a bit too optimistic and sweet, and contrary to what is likely to happen. Still one hopes it will end that way. In reality, of course, the traditional culture will continue to be overwhelmed because it has not grown and developed, locked to the main islands of New Zealand and not wishing to engage the world any longer. And yet, the carving of the Whale Rider, and the inspiring art work of the canoe, bear testimony that once a very enterprising, adventurous and brave society set out across the uncharted ocean, like cosmonauts across the waters of space, and colonized new lands. The spirit was once there. It will need more than the little girl named after the first Whale Rider to fan its fires for another time. This film makes you wish it would light a fire against the watery fog of the ocean and bring Maoris back to the front lines of growth.",1203638400,3,2125,4.557591623036649

These stories are important to experience, a point of view that only can expand the myopic mind of so many of those who only have a white man's eye view of the world. Such a view is a very, very limited view indeed.

The Maori are a proud, warrior like people with a history that risks getting lost in this increasingly modern world. Faced with accepting a girl as the potential inheritor of sacred power, the proud grandfather who lost his daughter and twin grandson of the young girl is bereft almost beyond hope. He cannot see the gift he has been given through his grief over the gifts he has lost.

Yes, there are whales - and yes, they need help. And they get it, in an incredible scene that is almost beyond belief.

1917584,5,B0000CABBW,"Note:  This review is by a high school English teacher.

First, the objections of some other viewers are correct.  The plot IS predictable and the message IS politically correct.  A little girl who is destined to be the new leader of her patriarchal tribe has to prove herself against the stubborn resistance and willful blindness of her grandfather, who is the current tribal chieftain.  Obviously, the film is not going to end with her being packed off to a nunnery.

Now onto the real meat of this film - stupendous spirituality, near perfect story execution, hauntingly magical presentation, rich cultural content and of course, Keisha Castle-Hughes, who was apparently born to light up a movie screen with her eyes.

If you are teaching world literature, I would honestly put this film in my top 20 of all time for that purpose.  One writing prompt I used was, ""What cultures do you claim as your own, and what can you tell me about them?""  This prompt caused such an animated discussion about culture, especially in the wake of the film, that it had to spill over into the next class.

BTW - in my opinion, the ""PG-13"" rating is completely unwarranted, and ""PG"" would have been spot-on.  However, I can't speak for your own cultural or personal sensibilities, and I would certainly recommend a complete pre-viewing before you show it.",1169683200,3,1340,4.807860262008734

1917590,3,B0000CABBW,"""Whale Rider"", a New Zealand film, is a story about a Maori tribe in modern times, with a twist of their tales and tradition thrown in. It's based on the 1987 novel of the same name. I thought I'd like it much more than I actually did, unfortunately.

Pai is a twelve year old Maori girl, the latest in a line of chiefs, an only daughter, very passionate about her people and culture, and who loves her grandfather, the chief of their region, very much. Daughters cannot go on to be chiefs, no matter how passionate they are, that is the tradition, and a tradition Pai's grandfather is determined to keep. Deciding to ignore his daughter completely, the old chief calls together all the Maori boys in the community, teaching them the old ways, the whats and the whys. In secret, Pai spys on them, learning the old ways too, creating an even bigger rift between her grandfather, a rift he refuses to mend.

I found it was rather serious and melodramatic (the dialogue, the shots, the music, the acting) like there was (or had to be) significance in everything that happened in the story. There was very little humour, which is a shame, because I'm sure I would have enjoyed the film a bit more if it had. The Maoris have a great sense of humour in real life, and its lacking a bit here. This film makes them out to be very stressed and intense, for the most part. Ah well. Through the film, I learnt a little bit about the culture of the Maoris, but considering it was one of the central parts of the film, it didn't seem to get too deep or detailed with explanations. Also, the title of the film is a bit misleading. There isn't an awful lot of whale riding, and I was looking forward to that. Where there is some, it's pretty well done, I thought.

Keisha Castle-Hughes gives an oscar worthy performance (maybe that's why she was nominated) and the film as a whole, while far from perfect, gives a whallop of a punch in the end.  The story of Pai, a young New Zealand girl who is hated then loved then hated again by her grandfather, is a truly heartfelt and moving story to say the least.  In their culture they believe that a firstborn son will become leader of the people.  The problem is that Pai's twin brother (who would in essence be the firstborn) died at birth and Pai, the daughter, was all that was left.  Her father, in haste and depression for losing not only his son but also his wife (she dies giving birth), leaves her in the custody of his parents.  His father is burdened by this and resents Pai for it, but as time passes he falls in love with her, until time comes for him to train the other firstborn SONS in the village for leadership and she tries to succeed herself.  The story is more a story of love than anything else.  Pai doesn't want to hurt her grandfather or defame her culture, she just wants to earn love and respect from her grandfather, a man whom she honors and respects and values dearly, loves as a she would love a father because he is the only father she's ever known.  There is a scene where she relates a spoken word essay about her culture and about her grandfather, and as she speaks in broken words and short breaths as tears fall down her face I (as well as my wife) were brought to tears for this beautiful girl, beautiful in both spirit and soul and that's what brings me to my title, Keisha Castle-Hughes, because simply put this young actress is astounding...she gave more heart in her performance then I've seen from a lot of leading ladies these days and so I am glad to see that she was honored by a nomination at such a young age.",1145836800,2,1884,4.314447592067989

The truth is that every single scene is utterly predictable, given the politically correct theme.  The truth is that old people are not bad just because they love their culture.  The truth is that tradition is not inherently evil.  The truth is that girls are no better or worse than boys.  Basically, if you hate men, this is the flick for you.  But it is not good.

1917605,5,B0000CABBW,"Two of 2003's best movies were filmed in New Zealand. Both featured great creatures and small heroes, and both ended with exotic ships sailing into the sea.  But there the similarities end.  For one was the grand, multiple-Oscar winning, special-effects laden, fantasy epic ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.""  The other was ""Whale Rider,"" a relatively low-budget picture about a Maori girl coming of age. Both films are equally astonishing in their own ways.

Paikea (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is a girl who survives the deaths of both her mother and twin brother during childbirth.  While the family grieves, Paikea's grandfather, Koro, suffers an additional loss, for Paikea's twin brother was the expected male heir to the family's noble line of prophets, who descended from a legendary ""Whale Rider.""  The rest of the film deals with the complicated family dynamic between Paikea, Koro, and Paikea's father, Porourangi, who resents Koro's old-fashioned ways and flees to Germany to pursue a career as an artist.  Paikea comes to realize the importance of her family's legacy, and struggles to achieve it while also striving for the affection and acceptance of her grandfather.

The driving force behind ""Whale Rider"" is a brilliant performance by first-time actress Keisha Castle-Hughes as Paikea.  Before seeing ""Whale Rider,"" I was astonished that she was nominated for an Oscar; after seeing it, I wished she would have won.  The supporting cast is uniformly strong; special mention goes to Rawiri Paratene, who deftly navigates Koro's conflicting feelings for Paikea.  The story is simple enough, but populated with profound themes on familial relationships, issues of gender equality, and environmental concerns.  Director Niki Caro wisely avoids overindulging in location photography; she captures the Maori milieu as much from the faces of her actors as from their surroundings.

""Whale Rider"" succeeds on many levels: it's epic and intimate, exciting and educational, humorous and heartbreaking. I can't think of anyone whom I wouldn't recommend it to.",1130889600,10,2074,5.364197530864198

Somehow this movie made it to my DVD player, and it has become one of my top 10 movies of all time, and I'll tell you why.

Powerful Drama.

Incredible Story.

Stunning Performances.

Cultural Experience.

It's that simple, really.  Without getting into the plot and all that has already been written, understand that Whale Rider is a deep, powerful story (I'd say for ages 12 and up) and is NOT a ""kid's movie""; it just happens to center around a child.  Whale Rider is about familial relationships, trust, respect and honor.  As composer Lisa Gerrard put so well, ""A sometimes dark but self effacing world of young Pai's (the main character) beautiful and difficult relationship with her grandfather that is heart rendingly defined by her awareness of her own identity, the depth of which we so often underestimate in our own children.""

The cinematography is incredible... beautifully shot, and CGI-free.  Lisa Gerrard's score is not just an added layer or an underscore, but it becomes an integral part of the movie's power.

Take a journey into this magical adventure you'll never forget.  Congrats to Niki Caro on taking a story I had never heard of, and bringing this fascinating cultural history to life.  Thanks also to all the people involved in the movie (the majority of the cast were the actual people from New Zealand with no acting experience).  Hats off to Keisha Castle-Hughes, the new young actress who truly made the picture believable.

The DVD has an informative behind-the-scenes documentary worth seeing as well.",1121644800,15,1719,4.852233676975945
1917617,5,B0000CABBW,"When you go to the video store looking for films with positive role models for kids (and adults!), with an inspirational message that you can accomplish something if you put your mind to it, you typically will find almost nothing.  Worse, even movies with a fraction of a positive message will be so silly or idiotic that watching them as an adult is torture.  With ""Whale Rider"" you get a movie that adults and teens (and many pre-teens) can both watch and enjoy.

As Roger Ebert pointed out in his review of ""Whale Rider,"" something is horribly wrong with a ratings system that gives a movie like this a PG-13 rating.  Just watch this next to a movie like ""Dodgeball"" with its objectification of women, toilet humor and sexual innuendo.  Both movies have the same rating!  Don't be fooled.  The average 12 year old _should_ be watching ""Whale Rider"" while ""Dodgeball"" shouldn't be viewed even by 14 year olds.  All of this has me wondering about about the sanity and intelligence of the ratings board.

As many have pointed out, Keisha Castle-Hughes puts in a superb performance.  Ditto for the rest of the cast.

Perhaps even better than the performances are the positive roles played by most characters.  The kids are intelligent, confident and curious.  The adults are generally supportive and wise.  While the males in the movie have obvious faults, this movie is about them as it is about ""girl power.""  There's a scene where Keisha's character is riding a bike with her grandfather and a loving glance passes between them.  How rare it is to see such imagery - a father figure bonding with a child - in movies or TV!  ""Whale Rider"" isn't just about celebrating a girl's empowerment.  It's also about showing the love between male parental figures and their own personal growth as their children mature.

One caveat: ""Whale Rider"" is not typical Hollywood popcorn fare.  Viewers with short attention spans or those who hate all foreign film style films will likely not like this movie.  Still, ""Whale Rider"" is an excellent start to open the eyes of a youth (or an adult) to ideas outside of what the studies usually throw at us.

Bottom line: We'd all be better off if we had more movies like this.",1118361600,24,2206,4.704960835509138
1917618,5,B0000CABBW,"This picture is a sublime ode to the sea nature and it exemplifies as any other else, the nature's purposes may be far beyond of the tradition or established principles conceived beforehand.

According the dynasty of ancient ancestors, Paikea must be a male leader, but there 's a twist of fate when two twins are born and one of them dies: the male. So this female survivor is never seen with any drop of tenderness of sympathy by her grandfather. She intends by all her means to win the trust and respect but she does not  get it.  But slowly there will be a curious events chain and slender facts that will convince him to this honorable but narrowed mind master he is wrong.

The film elapses between rituals and touching but effective anecdotes. She never gives up in her courage to reach her place. She will break the rules and her character will face the authority more than once.

The midnight sequence in which we watch the whales in the sand is visually poetic and extremely haunting.

Niki Caro threw once more her hat to ring with this admirable film, plenty of metaphors and mythological learning in which the nature is present ominously, through the greenness, the wind and the sea: the symbol of the life, according the mythical gaze.

Few times the cinema has been under the nature's service as in this case. There are other notable films as Flaherty's Nanook of the North, Herzog's Fata Morgana or Roeg's Walkabout for instance, but this film shines with resplendent brilliancy.",1117238400,5,1495,4.704980842911877
1917619,5,B0000CABBW,"This wonderful film was based on a novel by Witi Ihimaera, and directed by Nikki Caro. Shot in New Zealand, the film is about a girl who must fulfill her destiny as the leader of a Maori tribe in spite of the strong opposition she faces from her grandfather, a man with inflexible beliefs about the traditional roles of women in his society. Love and rejection are the main topics of the film, as the girl struggles to convince her grandfather that she is the one destined to ride the whales, the spiritual guardians of the tribe. The acting in Whale Rider is excellent, and the music, photography and sets are simply superb.

Keisha Castle-Hughes provides a very strong performance as the determined girl. You can see her next in Star Wars Revenge of the Sith.",1116460800,,761,4.595588235294118
1917620,5,B0000CABBW,"Maori mythology comes to life in the form of Pai, granddaughter of the tribal chief. Tradition demands the next chief be a grandson, but Pai's twin brother and Mother died during childbirth. Left to live with her Grandparents Pai tries to prove her worthiness to her Grandfather but he insists his successor must be a male.

The Maori claim to be descendants of the legendary Paikea who came to New Zealand riding on the back of a whale. This coastal, fishing community has maintained their close spiritual tie with whales for over a thousand years, their mutual destinies forever linked.

When Koro (Pai's grandfather) decides to gather together all the young males of the tribe and teach them the ""old ways"" in the hopes of finding the next chief Pai tries to join the group but, is rudely dismissed by Koro. In desperation she cries out to the whales, asking for their assistance in her quest for acceptance.

Now it is up to the whales to decide who's to be the ""chosen one."" A massive herd answers her plea by grounding themselves on the beach. The whole community unite in an attempt to save these sacred giants, seeing their impending deaths as an apocalyptic omen for the Maori people. All their efforts fail and hope is lost until Pai realizes the moment of truth has finally arrived.

What a beautiful, poetic movie. Keisha Castle-Hughes is brilliant as Pai as is the whole cast. It might be a little slow for younger children, but overall a wonderful experience for a family to watch together.

1917621,5,B0000CABBW,"A young Maori girl Paikea (newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes) in New Zealand is reared by her grandparents. Her father (played by the excellent Cliff Curtis) leaves New Zealand after he loses both his wife and Paikea's twin brother in childbirth. Pai's grandfather is the strictly traditional Maori tribal chief whose hopes for the future of their tribe rested with and died with the birth of the baby boy. The grandfather is struggling against modernism, struggling to maintain tradition and to educate a new generation of young Maori men. He is resentful that the baby who was born to be leader of the tribe has been taken away; his own son cannot face the reality and runs away, leaving the resentful grandfather to rear Paikea. The son has not only shirked his family responsibilities and tribal responsibilities, he has left behind his useless daughter. The baby son had been ""the chosen one"", the grandfather believes, as the ""whale rider"" and uniter of the tribe must be male. Paikea, in stark contrast to her grandfather who barely tolerates her, loves and reveres her grandfather more than anything, but is strongly drawn to the Maori traditions and customs, constantly defying her grandfather's stubborn opposition to her learning or participating in men's Maori customs. When Pai's father returns from Europe, the grandfather sees a glimmer of hope, trying to unite him with a Maori woman- only to have his son Porourangi reveal that he has a pregnant German girlfriend back home. The grandfather is livid, and Paikea is going to leave to go to Germany to live with her father. New Zealand, though, mysteriously beckons her to stay. She continues to defy her grandfather, enlisting her uncle to teach her the warrior ways. Eventually her grandfather shuns her entirely; Pai is heartbroken. His stubbornness not only hurts Pai deeply, it stands in the way of progress, acceptance and the dreams he holds dearest for the future of his people. The storytelling in this film is subtle, beautiful and heartbreaking. The cinematography is grippingly beautiful, and the relationships between people ultimately heal all wounds.",1111881600,6,2126,5.112068965517241
1917622,5,B0000CABBW,"How refreshing to find a film that feels more like you're observing a slice of life than a watching a big Hollywood blockbuster.

WHALE RIDER is the story of Paikea, the female surviving twin and most recent decendant of her Maori tribe's line of chiefs.  But leadership does not extend to girls in their tribe, and her grandfather tries to find the ""true chief"" among boys in the village by conducting lessons of strength and endurance.  Pai (played extremely effectively by first-time actress Keisha Castle-Hughes) is not allowed to join in these lessons, but her indomitable spirit is not crushed by her grandfather's rejection.  There are excellent supporting characters, such as Pai's grandmother, uncle, and often-absent father.  Each of these supporting characters help play a part in molding her character into a young woman with the leadership qualities her grandfather is looking for in others.

This is a very well-made movie because it doesn't feel like a movie.  You are simply watching these colorful characters live their lives, exert their beliefs, and become one with their beautiful New Zealand surroundings.  It is a treat for anyone who likes a quality film as well as for young people who can appreciate a fine story.  Enjoy--",1111708800,5,1247,5.073529411764706

1917625,5,B0000CABBW,"This is another classic New Zealand film with amazing performances from all the cast.  I dropped lucky with this movie, I got it for a dollar would you believe!  Blockbusters was selling ex-rental copies to raise money for an appeal and I happened to be in the shop on that day, lucky or what?

The plot is not complex, the Whangara people have long believed their presence in New Zealand dates a millennium, what is more they can trace their origins to a single ancestor who was lucky enough to escape death when his canoe capsized in the ocean and he rode to shore on the back of a whale.

From that time on the Whangara chiefs, have been considered this man's direct descendants as their natural born tribal leader.

Jump forward to the 21st century and we meet Pai played by the understated Keisha Castle-Hughes, an 11-year-old girl who comes to believe she is destined to be the new chief.

However Pai's grouchy and somewhat bitter grandfather Koro, (Pai's male twin died at birth) played fantastically by Rawiri Paratene is bound by tradition to pick a male leader and he cannot see that Pai is in fact the next true leader of their tribe and it is his stubbornness and anger that just might lead to a terrible tragedy if he does not open his eyes before it is too late...

This is one of the best films to come out of the 21st century; the scenery is breath taking, the acting first class and the sound-track spot on.  What more can you ask for?

One of the most wonderful scenes for me is when Pai takes to the sea on the back of whale, at that moment she knows she cannot change her Grandfather's mind so she gives herself to nature and rides on the back of a whale, letting it take her down into the depth of an ancient ocean.

It happens to turn on the question of whether the old school can accept a girl in a boy's traditional role, but I think it's more about tradition in general than about sex roles per se.  It also has a significant theme about difficult love within a family.  I guess I'm one of the simplistic dullards one reviewer refers to who were caught up in this film, from the early metaphor of the broken rope on the outboard motor, right through the ending.

Desiring to be accepted by her grandfather, the young girl learns the tribal arts by her somewhat ne'erdowell uncle.  This still does not sit well with her grandfather and it is only when it is learned of her ability to commune with nature, particularly the whales, is she accepted as an equal among the men of her tribe.  As stated before, Castle-Hughes gave a performance that was deserving of the Oscar nomination that she received.

When his canoe capsized a thousand years ago, Paikea escaped death by riding to shore on the back of a whale. On the east coast of New Zealand, the Whangara people honour this great ancestor and the Whangara chiefs are accepted as Paikea's direct descendants.

Pai believes she is destined to be the new chief but her grandfather Koro knows he must choose a male heir. Although a thousand years of tradition and a deep love for her grandfather battle in the 11 year old Pai, she must fight to fulfill her destiny.

The mythic whale rider, ancient symbol of Maori spirituality and connection to Nature, also brings that destiny and Pai's spirit is drawn throughout the film to these great creatures. There is a magnificent scene with beached whales where Pai greets one in Maori fashion, passing breath through her nose to symbolise the passing of her spirit in the breath of life. The extraordinary Keisha Castle-Hughes as Pai truly does breathe life into every scene with a commanding vitality and astonishing power. The story is elegantly told with Maori music and rituals bridging the spoken dialogue (mostly in English, some in Maori with subtitles).

This is a story of family relationships, of torn loyalties, of generational conflict, of love and rejection, of hope and a lesson in acceptance. It's also a gripping mystical fable and simply one of the most beautiful films I have seen in my entire life",1097020800,12,1629,4.721830985915493
1917635,1,B0000CABBW,"I was forced to watch this film because my friend said there was nothing else to rent at the small video place, suffice it to say I would have liked to watch a cartoon better because that is exactly what this film was, nothing but an empty regurgitation of history which wishes to substantiate its greatness. Expecting it to be very bad, I sat through it and humiliated myself because of it. I had heard about it and that it was an art-house favorite, one can't begin to see why, it is really amateurish and doesn't tell anything new which hasn't been done in some extent by American films and most of the script is extremely weak and simplistic.

Most everyone has been saying that this is so ""original"" but if you look at the history of American film, you can find many things which were borrowed. The film itself is unbelievable, and incredulous considering the lead role is played by a white little girl who doesn't really emphasize enough about the Maori culture, all she does is mop around in her sad state because her grandfather doesn't respect her because she is a girl. Not only is this film an aberration, but it insults all previous Maori culture because it pretends to be an modern artifact which wants to unite the past and the new, thing is, erasing the old ways isn't the way to do it.

Males and females had distinct roles in early cultures and there was nothing wrong with that, that is how they survived until the modern world caught up with them and started removing pieces of their structure and eventually, they became integrated into the European world, which was quite a mistake, considering that is where Feminist theory had surfaced its ugly head. Most of the cast is played by annoying people who can't act, one example is the little stoner boy who is being trained in the martial arts by the grandfather, he doesn't even look like he should be there, he fights the little girl with sticks and it is the most contrived scene I have ever seen. Most of the film, if not all, is contrived in such ways. Because it is so simplistic and absurd, this film will move many simple minded dullards who can't see beyond it's pretensions, this film is evil in its most evident nature because it wants to be 'feminist' and contort the meaning of the past, so much like totalitarian states. I should warn everyone that most of it is very boring also and the ending is one of the most ludicrous things I have ever seen. Grade: D",1096848000,5,2440,4.493243243243243

1917637,5,B0000CABBW,"Before I write my glowing review about Whale Rider below, I want to talk about Keisha Castle-Hughes and Niki Caro. As a frequent viewer of all types of movies, there is no doubt that Keisha gave the best performance as an actress in 2003 and was robbed at the 2004 Oscars - simply because she was a child.  Keisha is the most naturally gifted young actress to be seen on the silver screen in years. The camera loves Keisha's screen presence, her beauty and expressive eyes. I was blown away when I read in 2003 that she didn't have previous training as an actress. She gave an astonishing performance. Keisha's cameo as the Queen of Naboo in Star Wars: Episode III should be a treat to behold as well. It is the hope of millions of her worldwide fans that Keisha makes the correct decision to continue to pursue an acting career along with her high school studies. She has had offers, but she's seems to be postponing them at this time. Niki Caro is in that elite group of exciting new female directors along with Sophia Coppola, et al. However, what distinguishes Niki from the rest of he contemporaries is her ability to let her actors develop their characters as they overcome obstacles in the story and as they come to grips with their character's emotions leading to the character's growth. Keisha has stated, ""She [Niki] didn't just direct me, she gave me options."" Check out the Director Commentary section of the SPECIAL FEATURES of the Whale Rider DVD. Niki will be seen next director Charlize Theron [Best Actress Oscar Winner 2004] in ""Class Action"" for Warner Brothers. Ironic that Niki's next directing assignment would star Charlize who was given the Oscar over Keisha.

As for Whale Rider, not only was was it IMO the best movie of 2003, but it is the best all around movie to hit theatres in many years. This tiny, low budget plays like a BIG MOVIE. Yes, it introduces many of us to the Maori culture and the beautiful New Zealand coastline, but the real themes of this movie are about REJECTION, UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, BELIEVING IN WHAT YOU KNOW TO BE TRUE (DEEP INSIDE YOURSELF), AND EXERCISING THE TRIUMPH OF THE WILL TO OVERCOME TREMENDOUS OBSTACLES TO REACH YOUR GOALS. This isn't just a story about Pai's [Keisha Castle-Hughes] triumph or about girl power. It's a universal story that occurs every day with heroic children and adults around the world. Whale Rider gracefully portrays these attributes of the human spirit in a beautifully scripted, beautifully acted, beautifully directed, beautifully photographed movie. Many terrific reviewers have mentioned the school speech scene as the most memorable. Yes, it is. But, I feel the scene that hits the core of the movie's emotion is when Pai has decided to live with her father Porourangi [Cliff Curtis] and is saying goodbye to her grandfather Koro [Rawiri Paratene] who has love/rejection mixed feelings about her. Pai also says goodbye to grandmother, Nanny Flowers [Vicky Haughton], who has always protected her. Pai's sad, tear-swollen eyes embody a myriad of deep emotions - love, rejection, hurt, disbelief, reluctant resolve [she's agreed to leave], bravery, et al. In acting, the eyes are the ""windows to a character's soul"" and Keisha, like all great actors (e.g. Mel Gibson), has actor's eyes. I initially screened Whale Rider in the summer of 2003. I've seen it numerous times on DVD, and each time this magnificent film gets better and better.",1096070400,13,3428,4.848122866894198
1917638,5,B0000CABBW,"This film of a Maori chieftain's search for a successor who will keep the rural community's culture alive is also an appraisal of the culture itself and the values it represents.  The community is dying as its young people leave for the city and do not return, except briefly as visitors, and the chief, Koro (Rawiri Paratene) has no successor.  His own firstborn son, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis), who would normally have succeeded him, has left the community after his wife died giving birth to twins--a son who died, and a daughter who lived.  Naming the surviving daughter (Keisha Castle-Hughes) Paikea, after the whale rider who formed the culture a thousand years ago, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis) abandons her to the care of her grandmother and the community and goes to Germany to promote his artwork.

Paikea's difficult relationship with her grandfather, who scorns her because she is a girl and not the male heir he needs, is beautifully played here, and Keisha Castle-Hughes is a sensitive and winning actress who endows Paikea with the ""strength, courage, intelligence, and leadership"" which are the hallmarks of the culture.  Always trying to learn the old ways so that she can win her grandfather's love, she is, instead, constantly berated for trying to break the taboo of the marai by assuming a boy's role.

The striking cinematography (Leon Narbey) captures the spirit of the land, while the underwater photography of whales, as Paikea's spirit is drawn to them throughout the film, is stunning.  Maori chants and ceremonial dances convey many of the Maori cultural traditions and illustrate their similarities with those of the Hawaiians, who share a common origin.  The exchange of breath between Maori as a greeting represents a sharing of each person's essence, a factor which achieves tremendous symbolic significance in a climactic moment at the end of the film.

Because this is a film which conveys a message, it is not surprising that some of the characters here are two-dimensional, especially Koro, the grandfather, so consumed with the need to find a successor that he is unable to be a person.  But Paikea and the other children in the film more than make up for some of the adults' predictability with their palpable delight and pride in their culture and the fun they have learning the old ways.  A fascinating glimpse at a vanishing culture, this magnificent and moving film will itself help preserve its history and traditions.  Mary Whipple",1095897600,5,2471,5.029411764705882
1917639,5,B0000CABBW,"Yeah, this little girl has alot of power, but I think sometimes this movie is interpreted by our own cultural filters-ie, girl power vs. bad, old patriarchal grandfathers- too often.  This movie to me is more about being ""called"" than simply ""girls can do everything boys can do!"" Pai has been ""called"" to the role of leader, you can see it in her being really-and it simply takes time for her Grandfather to see it. I think Koro's actions in many ways are understandable-he is watching his people drown in poverty and the effects of colonization. It is THROUGH tradition and heritage that he sees a solution for his people's demise. And at the end when he says to Pai, ""forgive me, I am just a fledgling, new to flight,'"" it is then that we fully understand that Koro recognizes that calling too. Also, I have a Maori cousin who gave me a good insight regarding the part where Pai is nuzzling the whale-in Maori culture, when you pass breath through the nose as a greeting, you are in effect symbolically inferring that you would give your life-in the form of the breath-for that person. So, when Pai does exchange her breath the whale, she is ineffect saying she would exchange her life for that whale. Thus the whole part where she says she wasn't afraid to die-because basically she had already made that commitment earlier with the ritualistic breath exchange. AWESOME MOVIE-all kids should see this movie, as well as adults!

Although he's eventually come to care for her, he's always been somewhat distant and indifferent to her special capabilities, so time and time again she tries to win his affections - to make him proud of her - but she was not the son her grandfather was expecting and a part of him loathed her very existence because of that. However, despite his anger directed toward her constant defiance as she starts bending the rules, she also stuns the people of the small village she lives in as she practices and excels in the ways of the ancient custom.

I haven't read the novel by Witi Ihimaera in which this movie is based on yet so I can't compare the two but whether they stuck to the book or not, ""Whale Rider"" is a sensational cinema experience all should see. Even if this isn't your thing, anyone with any sense at all will surely recognize this as a true work of art... A masterpiece, if you will. The acting is superb with riveting performances from the entire cast (most notably young novice Keisha Castle-Hughes who, IMO, should have won the Oscar for best actress!) in this compelling drama that overflows with boundless spirit...unlike many films these days that rather rely on big effects and hideous amounts of violence, or plenty of action to draw viewers in.

The story of a leader among a people who can't see past her sex, a tale of remembering and returning to what you came from, and a lesson in acceptance.

Director Niki Caro simply presents Maori culture to the audience without any bulky explanations or excess subtitles. While some of the symbolism was a little heavy-handed, Caro nicely shows the decay of the people and where Koro's (the main character Pai's grandfather) motivation comes from.

The characters are portrayed with refreshing realism, the narrative is fantastic, and it's well shot. While it may be a bit slow going for some people, the film offers hope and leaves the viewer with a satisfied feeling few films offer anymore.",1093305600,2,844,5.0647482014388485
1917644,5,B0000CABBW,"I loved this film.  There is not one wasted moment or scene you will see in this entrancing and extraordinary film.

When you watch it you will be moved to tears by Keisha Castle-Hughes performance.  She will transform your thinking of a culture rooted in ignorance and deaf to the understanding of humanity.

You will see and experience through her eyes the pain and suffering women, or in her case a young girl, has to endure for no reason, but the necessity to not change customs in an intolerant culture.  When you first watch Keisha Castle-Hughes act you can't help but notice the innocence in her eyes.  Later in the film the innocence we saw turns into a sadness and hurt.

There are moments in the film where she brings you to your knees.  We really care about everything that happens to her and everything she does.  It's that heartfelt of a performance and quite simply one of the finest I've seen in many years.

Expertly directed and written by Niki Caro this film should be a must see for every teenager or adult who has a teenager.  They will and shall be enlightened...I was.  Easily, this film is the best of the past year.  My last departing words are this...DON'T MISS IT!!!",1093219200,8,1192,4.539906103286385
1917645,5,B0000CABBW,"OK, it's been a while since this movie came out, but I finally felt I had to put in my 2 cents because of some of the more recent reviews which are just plain ignant in places.

First of all, the capsule: This is one of the great, great movies of all time.  It's much more subtle (and kinder) than Once Were Warriors but perhaps translates a little less immediately for people outside of Polynesia because Niki Caro, herself a Pakeha (British-descended, non-Maori) New Zealander, doesn't feel compelled to explain Maori culture to outsiders.  This reflects the increasing familiarity of many New Zealanders of all races and cultural backgrounds with Maori culture and in this respect it is the most mature bicultural film to come out of Aotearoa. However, at the same time, this does make it a bit harder for the poor old foreigners to understand or feel the more nuanced parts  of the wairua (spirit) of this movie.

This is a movie that is uplifting, humane and deeply emotional. Anyone who thinks there is a ""man-bashing"" agenda here must have brought that particular mindset in with them. There are plenty of men who support Pai in the movie: her dad, her uncle, her friend Hemi (in an ungainly, preteen kind of way). Anyway, I digress.  This movie rocks, and Niki Caro, the cast, and especially Keisha Castle-Hughes (Pai), Rawiri Paratene (Koro) and Vicky Haughton (Nanny Flowers) deserve huge praise for their wonderful work.

On to the more cultural stuff: First of all, if anyone has said this before then my apologies, but Koro is a modern Maori even if he has some old-fashioned ideas. He lives in the 21st century and is dealing with 21st century issues.  This idea that only white people or people who live in cities are modern is something that continues to annoy me intensely.  Although the movie doesn't hit you over the head with it, there are plenty of reasons why Koro is so desperate to find ""the one"": The hopelessness of the young people in the community, the lack of opportunity and an aimlessness that leads kids to drugs, gangs and to a systematic loss of faith in themselves and in their future.  These things are at once familiar to anyone who works with rural young people in almost any industrialized country and also specifically a local issue because of the idea among quite a few people (including, sadly some of the kids themselves) that Maori youth and in particular rural Maori youth are expendable in the market-driven, vacuous, ad-saturated world of  mainstream consumerist New Zealand society. Having spent some time in the far north of the country (in and around the Hokianga), I could recognize a lot of the kids and the older young people in the secondary characters of the movie.

That said, Koro is a traditionalist within the context of his particular part of the world and he does hold to the notion that women don't have the nature to wield the kind of mana (spiritual power) that is required of a chief.  Nanny Flowers on the other hand, comes from the Arawa people where women did and do hold political power.  Moreover she herself is descended from the great chiefess Muriwai,  This is one of the reasons why she continually helps Pai and resists Koro's attempts to demean Pai just because she was born a girl.  Flowers' stance is just as ""traditional"" as Koro's so this movie (in its typical, quiet way) challenges us to not to get too comfortable with easy pigeon-holing.

I also want to take issue with the people who felt the whole thing with the whales was too ""New Age-y"".  In traditional Maori understanding, specific groups of people are connected by genealogy to landscapes, rivers, mountains and other natural resources including animals and plants.  The original Whalerider, Paikea, established the link between the Ngati Konohi (the community shown in the movie) and the whales. As relatives, the whales are bound by obligations to the people, just as the people are bound by obligation to the whales. Koro's inability to call to the ancestors reflects the fact that he has lost some part of his mana as a descendant of Paikea because of his foolish adherence to the form of tradition, rather than its spirit.  The whales beach not because Pai called them too close to the shore, but because their plight mirrors the plight of the people (directionless, failing and blind).  This issue was downplayed by the director, and is the only place where, in my  humble opinion, Niki Caro's instincts as a film-maker perhaps over-rode the need for an explicit narrative to the detriment of the film as a whole.

The whole issue of how to blend the ""traditional"" with the ""modern"" is the central axis of this movie.  It's just a guess but I think that the reason why this movie was so incredibly popular when it finally made it here to Hawai`i was that it suggested that you can marry the two (tradition and modernity) together.  That traditions can be changed without losing their ability to keep people strong and moral. That while traditions are the root that makes the tree strong, the branches of the tree should adapt to their own specific situation.  The question of how to apply traditional ideas to modern contexts is one of the big issues facing colonized and disenfranchised peoples everywhere.

However, (and let me be clear about this) this is a different issue from the idea of cultural authenticity and cultural identity. No-one would argue that Europeans (or Euro-Americans, or Euro-New Zealanders) should practice 18th century European culture in order to be considered ""authentic"" white people.  Why the heck should native people be held to a different standard?

One thing that might make some of this clearer, is to watch the ""making of"" documentary in the special features part of the DVD. This is a really nice piece of documentary film-making and it gives a much better sense of the real Maori community who hosted the film crew but also the tremendous pride and sense of connection that the actors and crew (both Maori and Pakeha) felt to the community and to the wairua that lies behind the film.  Without the real people and the real culture, this would have just been a pretty story in a beautiful landscape.  The reality is much, much deeper.

One other thing that might help people understand Whale Rider a little better is to learn a bit more about Maori culture.  Some suggestions are:  novels: ""The Bone People"" by Keri Hulme; anything by Witi Ihimaera (including the book the movie was based on ""The Whale Rider"" although for my money, ""Tangi"" is better), and Patricia Grace's ""Potiki"". In non-fiction:  ""Making Peoples"" by James Belich, ""Two Worlds"" by Anne Salmond, ""Tikanga Whakaaro"" by Cleve Barlow (fairly rare these days but a great resource as is Hiwi and Pat Tauroa's ""A guide to customs and protocol""), ""Tikanga Maori"" by Hirini Mead which is also very good but much denser and Linda Tuhiwai Smith's ""Decolonizing Methodologies"".  Avoid anything by Alan Duff until you have some familiarity with what's really going on in Maori culture.  Once you know something, you can also go back and look at movies like ""Once Were Warriors"" and ""Utu"" and appreciate the things they say (and don't say).

Niki Caro, Witi Ihimaera and the cast and crew of Whale Rider have made a beautiful and memorable addition to world literature.  It's great as a story about an individual, but it's true greatness comes as a story about a people.",1092960000,50,7412,4.797169811320755

The people? Diverse (with pretty cool accents). This one is heavy on tradition. The old ways mingled with some modern conveniences. One family's tragedy taken to an enlightening conclusion. It's an interesting film. Through most it, I just wanted to give that little girl (Keisha Castle-Hughes) a big hug (i.e., she's a good actress). Funny how the most stubborn and seemingly uncaring individuals somehow end up being the ones who care the most. It's just a shame that to realize it, an exceptional event must take place, which isn't so typical, but certainly entertaining. Expectations based on potential is one thing. But governing a life (and those to come) based on gender and family tradition alone is another matter altogether. Oppression sometimes inspires miracles. Such is the case here. A rather beautiful one at that. Time to break the barriers and allow a new tradition to evolve. I definitely recommend this movie. If nothing else, it's a poignant reminder of how differently people in other parts of the world live.",1091145600,10,1202,5.045226130653266

BUT do not let that out you off from this film, you do not need to know about the Maori traditions to enjoy it.

Anyone who likes the philosophy that girls can do anything that boys can do will love this film for it's strong female lead by little Keisha Castle Hughes who does an outstanding job, especially when she gives her speech about her grandfather.

The girl survived and was discouraged from becoming a chief. Yet she persevered and trained with the help of some other villagers even though  her grandfather wanted a male heir. Her grandfather's goal was to recruit one of the boys from the village school. There were tests of fighting skills and retrieving a whale medallion that the grandfather threw into the ocean. I would highly recommend this movie because it made me feel very good to watch it.

1917651,5,B0000CABBW,"We live in an age where moving stories of courage and determination just aren't enough. Those tales have to be accompanied by Oprah Book Club moments of overcoming handicaps and tragedy or dealing with racism and sexism. Many a great story is ruined because the real drama of life takes a secondary role to the politically correct lens through which it is told.
In Whale Rider, it is the Lifetime-esque melodramatic subplot dealing with the evil old men who run the world and try to prevent little girls from reaching their life's destiny. The story takes place inside an aboriginal whaling community, seemingly untouched by the modern cultural advancements of the past one hundred years. Of course, our liberal filmmakers decided these people needed to be lectured in gender roles, and thus the little story of a young girl over-coming an oppressive and chauvinistic world is born.
Now, that all sounds like criticism for this film, and I do admit I wish this Steinam-like depiction of men was toned down a bit. But that one flaw doesn't change the fact that this is a wonderful film, a truly remarkable achievement. Forgetting all the male-bashing, at the center of the film is a touching story about a young child who so wants to be loved, especially by her grandfather. She latches on to a story from family's her past about a great voyager who arrived at their island on the back of a whale, a great warrior whose soul will someday return in a ""chosen one"". The young girl decides she has as much claim to the birthright as any of the boys and attempts to prove to everyone (especially her grandfather) that she is worthy.
We seldom see young people depicted in such an honest manner. This touching story will be loved by almost everyone (and the feminists may take steps to have it canonized).",1089763200,2,1799,4.714285714285714

1917658,5,B0000CABBW,"Beautifully blending mystical Maori tribe beliefs with modern day 21st century, ""Whale Rider"" will have even the most hard-hearted cynics wiping their tear-stained eyes.
According to a long-standing Maori legend, of which ""Whale Rider"" is much hinged upon,  the tribe's male warrior and leader, Paikea rode to New Zealand on the back of a whale thousands of years ago. Since that time, the first-born male heir to the Maori chief has always assumed the title of whale rider at adolescence. At the opening of ""Whale Rider"" however, the designated male heir dies in infancy. His twin sister, although is spared and thus is born the strong, little precocious girl-cum-warrior ""Pai"", played by a luminous and stunningly beautiful, Keisha Castle-Hughes.
Old chief, grandfather Koru, steeped in the ""old Maori ways and traditions"" however, refuses to accept Pai as the true ""one"".
What is most extraordinary about this book and film is instead of a ""coming of age"" tale being solely about a child's first love, the loss of a young girl's virginity or total child-like innocence lost, ""Whale Rider"" takes a sort of moral highground.  This story is a ""coming of age"" rarity for the plain and simple fact that it shows a young girl asserting herself in a traditionally male role, much like ""Bend It Like Beckham"", ""Mulan"" or even ""National Velvet"".
""My name is Paikea Apirana, and I come from a long line of chiefs...""

1917659,4,B0000CABBW,"When I first saw this movie, I was enchanted by the performance of Keisha Castle-Hughes and fully appreciated her struggle to be recognized as a leader of her Maori community.  Upon seeing it again a year later I realized how abusive Pai's relationship with her grandfather is.  When a twelve-year old girl feels she must sacrifice her life in order to realize her destiny and win the respect of her grandfather, this is not a vision quest but suicide.
So many young girls today sacrifce who they really are in the name of societal beauty and cultural acceptance.  Thousands of years ago, in the story of Abraham and Isaac, Abraham was stopped from sacrificing his own son to fulfill his destiny with Yahweh.  This was a crucial mark of difference between the early Hebrew faith and other tribal religions in Mesopotamia, that there would be no child sacrifice to appease gods or ancestors.  Children were now the vessel through which the promise of God would be fulfilled.  Later a man named Jesus of Nazareth would be crucified for his passion to live in the love of God the Creator so completely.  But he was a man, an adult who could make decisions for his own life.  A twelve year old girl is still a child; on the brink of womanhood but a child nonetheless.
To uphold this movie as a role model for other young girls (and boys) is wonderful up until the last few scenes.  I apologize for the spoiler content in this review but I feel strongly about the mixed message this movie gives.  Perhaps I am imposing my Western, 21st century point of view upon an indigenous culture, but how does this message translate to young teens facing adversity and lack of acceptance from peers and possibly family?
This movie is all about keeping tradition but also about making changes to move into the future. Yet Pai's sacrifice is something of the ancient world, not the one she hopes to lives in.  When watching this movie with your teenage children, talk with them about how they see Pai and could there have been an alternative ending, another solution to the impass between Pai and her grandfather.",1087171200,3,2095,4.650406504065041

I rarely care about the Oscars but I really wanted Keisha Castle-Hughes to win her category.  True to form, the politics of Hollywood prevented her from winning, but no matter.  This movie was wholesome and entertaining.  It covers the social stigmas that will inevitably arise in any culture and does its best to break down barriers.
Hopefully there will be no sequel because the point was made in this movie.  Any future movie will just try to cash in on the finanical laurels of the first and will likely be just an attempt to make money.",1087171200,2,813,4.445945945945946

Poor little Pai, the unfortunate female twin who survived their birth, is practically abandoned by her dad and nearly disowned by her proud, heritage-obsessed Koro, until he gives her a chance. Despite the closeness they accomplish, her granddad will never allow her to fully experience her tradition, simply because she is a girl. He denies her the chance to become the leader of her people, as she thinks she might be, and instead looks to the other boys in their community for their new leader.
The girl power is not over-emphasized, and we get a rich, emotionally complex story about a girl's realisation that she has the power to communicate with their ancestors and become a much needed leader for their people.

1917662,5,B0000CABBW,"Whale Rider is a relatively simple plot that provides extensive depth. The main character is a young girl, a member of a tribe between tradition and change. The story revolves around her relationship with her grandfather. The grandfather is a chief who wanted a grandson to carry on. He is losing his sense of identity as his traditions slip away. He manifests his fear and loss by ostracizing his granddaughter because of traditional gender roles. Pai, the granddaughter, is in turn seeking her own identity within the same paradigms that her grandfather is losing his. She persistently seeks her grandfather's guidance and love but is turned away. Her ordeal is painful, her patience inspiring, and her strength unequalled. In the end the roles of teacher and student are reversed with great emotion, triumph and discovery.
  The story is slow at times but character development and the overall plot more than compensate. The plot is easy to follow but it does require dedicated viewing to be appreciated. This is not a movie to watch concurrently with other activities.  The performances, soundtrack, and settings are all enjoyable.  Keisha Castle-Hughes delivers a stellar performance in the role of Pai. This alone is enough to make the movie worth seeing.

1917664,4,B0000CABBW,"It is always interesting to get a slice of indigenous life, and Whale Rider offers a compelling look into Maori culture in New Zealand.  Keisha Castle-Hughes stands out as Pai, a teenage girl determined to take part in the coming-of-age rituals which she feels is her birth right.  The only problem is that she is a girl and has to get past her rigid Grandfather in order to do so.
The movie tries to balance modern-day realities against age-old customs, while offering an optimistic view of Maori life. It builds slowly to its dramatic end. Pai is dealt a cruel blow when her grandfather refuses to train her in the ancient rituals.  Her grandfather is the spiritual leader of the village and hasn't been able to overcome the fact that neither of his sons have been able to give him a grandson.  She had chosen to stay in the village rather than go off to Europe with her father.  Pai's grandmother offers some solace, but ultimately Pai has to take matters into her own hands when a pod of whales is left stranded on the beach.  She had learned the rituals from her uncle, who sees in Pai what her grandfather is unable to.  Pai has a natural calling for whales and feels it was her fault that the whales beached themselves.
The scenes are evocatively handled and one sees much of the beauty in Maori culture with very little of the harsh realities.  Niki Caro gives the movie the feeling of a parable, which should play well with young audiences.",1085788800,2,1449,4.524904214559387
1917665,5,B0000CABBW,"I found ""Whale Rider"" to be a nice surprise.  It doesn't cater to our lower nature at all ... quite rare in today's movie making ... but concentrates on family and tradition instead.

It is the story of a Maori family living in a New Zealand village ... a family that had, for generations, provided the local Maori population with its spiritual leader ... always a male ... who, as tradition has it, is able to ride, yep, whales.  The youngest generation has no male to offer, only a young girl.  Strife naturally occurs, and the story is an unfolding of the initial resentment and then begrudged acceptance of this girl ... after it is demonstrated that destiny is on her side.

Keisha Castle-Hughes plays the young girl, and she is excellent.  Rawiri Paratene plays her grumpy grandfather, and he is good too.  All the characters are true-to-life ... nothing is sugar coated ... and this is quite a departure from your normal cinematic fare.

There is quite a bit of ... psychological violence ... coming out of the grandfather character.  He is quite mean to the girl ... all in the name of tradition ... and I didn't go for that at all.  She takes it like a little champion, however, and prevails in the end.

It would have been a much better movie if the grandfather had had ... love in himself to give ... instead of the rigid (and senseless) demands of ancestry.  A nice balance (between his love for his grand-daughter and his concern for tradition) could have been maintained ... and this would have made the final victory all the more sweet.

As it is, there are quite a few scenes that are unsettling ... not the least of which is the opening one.  But it is an inspiring movie at heart, and yes, she does actually ride a whale.",1085011200,,1739,4.479365079365079

1917667,5,B0000CABBW,"In 2002, Niki Caro directed and co-wrote the screenplay for the endearing New Zealand film ""Whale Rider"", which was based upon novel of the same name written by Witi Ihimaera and published in New Zealand in 1987.  (In Maori, the title is ""Te Kaieke Tohora"".)  The story is about a young Maori girl named Paikea 'Pai' Apirana (Keisha Castle-Hughes), who is a direct descendent of the Maori chief Paikea who arrived at Whangara, New Zealand on the back of a whale many generations ago.  From that time forward, his first-born male descendents were each named after him and became chiefs; that is, until Paikea Apirana's parents gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, as their first-born children.  Sadly, the twin's mother died during childbirth, as did the boy; but the girl survived and was named Paikea.  Disgraced, her father, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis), leaves for Europe, so Pai's grandparents raise her instead.  Her grandfather, Koro Apirana (Rawiri Paratene), views Pai as a bad omen for the tribe and embarks on finding a Maori boy worthy of becoming the next chief since he can't accept the possibility of a girl becoming chief.  However, Pai's grandmother, Nanny Flowers (Vicky Haughton), loves Pai very much and encourages her to learn the ways of a chief in spite of Koro's objections.
""Whale Rider"" was first released at the Toronto Film Festival in September, 2002, where it won the ""People's Choice Award"".  As it was shown at various independent film festivals that followed, including the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, it continued to win awards and was finally released for general cinema in May, 2003 in Australia and in the U.S. one month later.  Shortly thereafter, the Keisha Castle-Hughes received serious attention from film critics.  She was rewarded for her performance in ""Whale Rider"" with an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.  Though she did not win the Oscar, she will hopefully continue to develop her acting abilities and continue to be a superb member of her generation of actors and actresses.
For its superb acting, wonderful story and incredible cinematography, I rate ""Whale Rider"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  Other memorable characters in the film include Uncle Rawiri (Grant Roa), Hemi (Mana Taumaunu) and Shilo (Rachel House).  Memorable scenes include Pai trying to clandestinely learn from Koro, Koro taking pupils out on a canoe, Pai finding the necklace, Pai reciting her history at school and the whales.  I highly recommend this film to everyone.",1083801600,5,2500,5.036407766990291

There are so many wonderful points to be learned in this film, but the most important of all is to be true to who you are. Pai, the main character, is convinced that she is to be the next leader, and sets out to become just that. It isn't an easy road, which I am glad to see, because it mirrors true life, which is never that easy. However, she stays true to herself, and overcomes a big obstacle to achieve her goal.

1917672,5,B0000CABBW,"This is a beautiful, sad but eventually satisfying story of a young girl who survives her mother and twin brother when they die in childbrith, and is born into a Maori family in remote New Zealand.
Distraught at the death of his wife, the father leaves her with the grandparents, of which the grandfather has problems bonding with her, as traditionally a boy was needed to succeed him as tribal chief.  (His son is obviously not interested as he is more interested in modern society than a traditional Maori lifestyle)
The film concentrates on her trying to prove to her grandad that she is the natural successor, and the pain she goes through to get it through to him. (Though I she is simply trying to impress him to earn his love, rather than consciously trying to become Chief)
This film is stunning, emotional and beautiful.  All the performances are excellent, especially the young girl (who was oscar nominated) and I personally found the cultural differences fascinating.
I suggest putting the subtitles on before watching the film as I had some difficulty picking up the accent at times which is very strong with some characters.

1917676,5,B0000CABBW,"Whale Rider is an outstanding film. It is a well written, well acted film dealing with many issues, such as survival of a tribal culture in the ""modern"" world, generation gaps, gender gaps, and family members understanding and supporting each other. It also deals with leadership and the difficulties involved in trying to chart a course for a group of people for whom you are responsible.
The central story of the film is the struggle of a young woman to gain acceptance from her grandfather. Wrapped around this is the story of tribal bloodlines and gender expectations. I can't really go into detail without spoiling the ending, but suffice it to say that Keisha Castle-Hughes did a great job as the courageous young woman, and all the actors gave very believable performances. I was drawn into the story easily, and it kept my attention through to the end.
It is really nice to see more movies where women and girls are the heroes and get to show strong character development and great depth. Women have played very important roles in virtually every aspect of human history, and I feel cheated by the way they have been left out of historical tales. It is a never ending source of inspiration to discover yet another episode of women's contributions, and it is gratifying to see fiction giving them more due as well. Highly recommended.

1917677,5,B0000CABBW,"Based on a book by Witi Ihimaera, the story is set in a small Maori community on the coast of New Zealand. Leadership of the town is passed down from from eldest son to eldest son, tracing all the way back to Paikea, their ancestor who rode to shore on a whale after capsizing in his canoe. This hereditary line is broken, however, when a girl is born to Porourangi Apirana, the eldest son of the current community leader. The girl's mother and twin brother die in childbirth, leaving Pai (her father names her after their heroic ancestor) the sole heir. Her grandfather, Koro, is disappointed, and though he loves his granddaughter very much, and she him, he shuns her and refuses to train her as the next leader. But Pai knows who she is and takes it upon herself to learn the ways of her people and fulfill her destiny.
This is an amazing and touching story, made even better through excellent film-making. 12-year-old Pai is played by Keisha Castle-Hughes in a wonderful debut performance. One would never guess it was her first acting job. She manages to convey a great depth of emotion, and her crowning moment comes in a scene near the end, where she tearfully dedicates a speech to her beloved grandfather (Rawiri Paratene), who failed to show up for her recital of it. The whole film focuses on the conflicts between the great love the characters feel for each other, and the obligations of tradition. It is about a clash of generations and the struggle to reconcile the old world with the new. Pai's father (Cliff Curtis) is also at odds with Koro, so much so that he flees to live in Germany. And Pai's grandmother Nanny Flowers (Vicky Haughton) loves them all and tries her best to help then all make peace with one another.
The movie is fairly short, clocking in at 101 minutes, but the slow pacing of the story makes it seem longer. There isn't really any action, yet somehow the viewer remains captivated by the story. The beautiful, haunting soundtrack also adds a great atmosphere to the film. Every main actor turned in a spectacular performance. If you aren't familiar with the New Zealand accent, however, it may take a little while to understand everything the actors say. The realism of it all is heightened by the fact that the movie was filmed in a real seaside Maori village, and all the ""extras"" are drawn from the town's own population. This lends a great sense of community, particularly in the emotional scene near the end where the people gather to aid a pod of beached whales (which, despite being replicas, look amazingly authentic). This scene ultimately leads to Pai, in an important symbolic role, riding on the back of one of the whales.
The DVD also offers some nice extras. There is director commentary and the theatrical trailer. A great ""Behind the Scenes of Whale Rider"" featurette provides many insights into the filmmaking process, including how they selected Caste-Hughes for her role, how the whale replicas were constructed, and more. ""Te Waka: Building the Canoe"" follows the entire construction of the canoe that features as a major symbol in the film. Fittingly, the canoe was given as a gift to the people of the town in which the movie was filmed. There is also a featurette on the soundtrack, an art and photo gallery, and some deleted scenes. All in all I think this is one of the best films of 2003, and I recommend it highly. Though the main character is a 12-year-old girl, this is not a children's film, and should be enjoyable for viewers of all ages.",1079740800,7,3509,4.661290322580645

Her acting was flawless - actually, it didn't seem as though she WAS acting, which makes it all the better.
The movie made me cry, laugh and learn quite a bit about a different culture.
The relationship she has with her grandfather was facinating to me and the encouragement from her grandmother and rest of the family was heartwarming.

1917684,1,B0000CABBW,"How on earth has THIS garnered so much critical acclaim? I must have been watching the wrong film. I wanted to like this. I really did. After reading so many great reviews in so many publications I was looking forward to a non-Hollywood uplifting tale. What I got was a slow and dull borefest.
First of all, I cannot fathom how Keisha Castle-Hughes is nominated for an academy award. Her performance is minimal. Perhaps this is supposed to be her character but I have not seen a more monosyllabic display since Sylvester Stallone took on the role of John Rambo in First Blood. All she does is stand around, looking detached and sullen. Anybody can do that. I do admit that she did a good job crying during the scene with her speech. But big Arnie cried in End of Days and I don't see anyone handing him and Oscar.
In regards to the rest of the cast, there is NO character development. There are some hints but nothing is ever explained. Like why does Pai love her grandfather so much when he is horrid towards her? What's the deal with her uncle smoking crack? Hardly the kind of thing appropriate for a family movie? What does being the leader of the tribe actually mean?
According to her grandfather's 'leader lessons', being a tribe leader means nothing more than practicing for war. That's all he teaches. War, war, war. What's that got to do with sitting on the back of a whale and riding about the ocean? I don't know much about Maori tribes but I think that this is a completely outrageous representation of them. This could be intentional as the grandfather is supposed to be out of touch with his true tribal senses but nothing excuses the scene in which he tells a group of 10-year-old boys to place their severed enemy's heads on a stick as an example to others. I'm sorry but there is a word for that kind of behaviour. It's called 'WAR CRIMES'. Another thing I think is totally inappropriate for a family movie. And it's also pretty Xenophobic.
What boggles the mind is how I've heard of so many people telling me they cried at this film. Cried at WHAT exactly? There is no major emotional revelation at any part of the film. The ending is totally inconclusive. Just a bunch of guys in a big boat, chanting. Why would I cry at this? And where are they going?
I will give the film credit for having a few brief (very brief) atmospherical moments during the narration scenes. But nothing ever becomes of them. There is no complication or sophistication to this film at all. It builds and 'resolves' in the most simplistic and dull way. I would not recommend this as a family movie. I was hoping for something better than mass-produced rubbish such as 'Cheaper by the Dozen' and I did not get it.
Don't be fooled or brainwashed by the inexplicably positive reviews this film has somehow garnered. That is my most crucial advice.
The DVD is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a Dolby 5.1 soundtrack (that might as well be Mono for all it's worth).",1077926400,26,2968,4.528864059590316
1917685,5,B0000CABBW,"'Whale Rider' was a shock for me.  I had no expectations for it, other than knowing that (a) Keisha Castle-Hughes got an Oscar nomination for it; (b) it had been very well-reviewed by the mainstream movie press; and (c) the track record for New Zealand filmmaking over the last couple of years (as exemplified by Peter Jackson) has been very, very strong.
Even with all that factored in, 'Whale Rider' was still a complete shock: it is nothing short of wondrous filmmaking.  If you liked the message of empowerment carried by films such as 'Bend It Like Beckham,' then 'Whale Rider' will make your spirits soar.
Oh, and believe it: Keisha Castle-Hughes - born of an Australian father and a NZ Maori mother - deserves that Oscar nomination.  It's very hard to believe this was her first time on a movie set.  She is electric.  You will have no problem envisioning Castle-Hughes' ""Pai"" as the next Maori 'great leader.'  In fact, everyone in the movie has it figured out, save the one that matters: her grandfather and current leader, Koro (in a fierce portrayal by Rawiri Paratene).  What will it take to get him to see it?  Nothing short of a simply amazing event.",1077580800,6,1164,4.671568627450981
1917686,5,B0000CABBW,"I'm in the process of moving and packed up and shipped off all my DVDs.  Except for one.  I wanted to rewatch this- and it was even more moving the 2nd time around.

Cinematography is wow.  The acting by all characters moving.  The writing, the storyline...I cried.  Niki Caro takes us through the emerging culture of the Maori, struggling to keep the old ways, as nearly every culture today does, yet in the midst of technological change, and the import of Western values.  And perhaps not all those values are bad... In no way is the culture of the Maori denigrated in this- rather the opposite, it is revealed in new ways to the outside world, as something valuable and worthy to be followed.  But it is also evolving, emerging, as is every culture, in every time.

It is Keisha who makes this movie work most of all.  She is cute without being pretentious- she is honest and open in her acting, and so creates a character that desires goodness, and yet on terms of what is right for her soul, not necessarily what is dictated for her.  She is an Idealist NF dealing with an often absent Artisan SP father and a very strong Guardian SJ grandfather.  Her world is controlled by the Guardians, and she seeks to break free, and bring freedom, as an authentic Idealist.

Benefits to the DVD:  Cut scenes were really great, especially the dinner scene, though I'm still trying to figure out why the scenes were cut.  And the section on some of the cultural background of the Maori people was very enlightening.",1077408000,,1508,4.553903345724907
1917687,5,B0000CABBW,"First of all, Castle-Hughes is indeed the youngest Best Actress nominee (Tatum O'Neal won a Best Supporting Actress oscar), and it is well deserved.  Her performance is nothing short of mesmerizing.  Many reviewers here have said that her motivation in this film is to become the new tribe leader and her actions are all intended to prove to her grandfather that she is worthy.  Nothing could be further from the truth.
Pai does not crave power or leadership.  She only wants what all children - what all people - want: love and acceptance.  The power in this film lies with the fact that Pai is humble and selfless, and this is what ultimately leads to her ascendance.  When she sings to the ancestors (the whales) to come to them, she is not doing it to prove she is the leader - she is doing it to help end her grandfather's suffering.  She doesn't care about herself - she just wants her grandfather to be happy.  She also cares about her tribe and its traditions - she is far more interested in Maori history than anyone else her age, perhaps more than anyone other than the tribal elders.  She loves her heritage and her grandfather, and when she sees an opportunity to make a difference she doesn't want to be left out.  She is not driven by a desire to lead.  She only wants to help and to belong, and in so doing she changes the lives of everyone around her.
There are so many emotional moments in this film it is impossible to think through them all without getting choked up.  I knew very little about the film going into it and was really blown away by the masterful storytelling by these relatively new filmmakers.  Frankly, I'm surprised this film wasn't nominated for more than just the one nod to Keisha Castle-Hughes.  At the very least it deserved a nom for Adapted Screenplay (RETURN OF THE KING was the Best Film but as an adaptation it was lacking).  I think it deserved a Best Film nom ahead of SEABISCUIT, which I thought was fine but nowhere near as good as this.  Going by the oscars alone WHALE RIDER is certainly an extremely underrated film, and deserves to be seen.  If richly-drawn characters and simple but engaging human dramas are your bag, don't waste the money renting it - this one is a must-own.",1076976000,3,2232,4.4987593052109185
1917688,4,B0000CABBW,"""Whale Rider"" is not your everday girl power movie.
The heroine, Paikea(Keisha Castle-Hughes), is the granddaughter of a New Zealand chief and the descendant of the famous Paikea, who supposedly rode a whale through the South Seas to New Zealand. Her grandfather has been awaiting the next male chief: alas, his oldest son (whom it has to be) becomes an artist and his oldest son dies at birth. But he leaves a twin sister...and that is the lovely Paikea who wants nothing more than to be the next chief.
Ah but her grandfather has different ideas. THough he cares for her, he grows to believe that since her birth (she's about 13 in the movie), everything bad has happened. He tries to establish a school for boys to teach them ""old ways""; Paikea learns these ways on the sly. The more she tries, the angrier her grandfather becomes.
Though this movie deals with such noble themes as leadership and the mystical relationship humans can have with animals, its settings are quite mundane. The families live in modest though modern houses. The school is adequate though threadbare. Children are born in hospitals. The grandfather is a chief by night but seems to clean sewers or set up septic systems by day.
The movie also moves slowly. I still enjoyed it but I can see how the pacing could bother some viewers.
Yet I would recommend this movie to nearly everyone who enjoys art house fare or coming of age pictures. You'll also witness an astonishing performance from Castle-Hughes.

1917689,5,B0000CABBW,"Whale Rider is a rare and wonderful film.  It is set in a small seaside Maori village in New Zealand and concerns the chief, who has no first-born grandson to carry on the old ways.  He does have a loveable and plucky granddaughter, Pai, named for the legendary founder of the Maoris who came there on the back of a whale.  Pai adores her grandfather, but he has forbidden her to study the old ways because she is a girl.
This is one of those movies that draws you into its world completely with its honesty.  The Maori world comes alive thanks to the Maori cast and one can easily relate to the universal themes of love, rejection, disappointment, and courage.  The 12-year old star, Keisha Castle-Hughes is so genuine and charismatic, it is no wonder she has been nominated for a Best Actress Oscar.  She is a natural talent, beautiful, inspiring, and delightful to watch.
Whale Rider has the art-house feel to it, because it deals almost exclusively with emotions.  Village life and underwater scenes of whales are lovingly photographed and accompanied by a haunting score. There is a lot of Maori culture in it, but the desire for acceptance and respect are universally understood.  If you like character-driven stories with heartwarming elements of the supernatural, you'll enjoy Whale Rider.",1076716800,3,1297,4.83710407239819
1917690,5,B0000CABBW,"""Whale Rider"" is a great 2003 drama release from New Zealand.  Unfortunately, it was also one of the most underrated films of that year.  Its powerful message catches many audiences' hearts, especially the theme of twelve-year-old Pai being ignored by her live-in grandfather.  The writing wonderfully expresses every emotional aspect.  It doesn't miss a single drop of it for a second.  This film becomes an emotional rollercoaster as Pai struggles to find her place in life on her own.  As she overcomes many odds, the dramatic theme arises while the sense of hope feels closer.  The film becomes more interesting as Pai breaks the gender barriers, namely when her grandfather says, ""only boys allowed.""  Such happenings deserve tremendous respect for the writers.
Talented child actors are very rare.  Keisha Castle-Hughes proves in her role as Pai that she is truly talented.  This emotional role earns her the title as the youngest Oscar nominee for Best Actress at age 13.  Her heart and soul is present through every scene.  Her hardhitting emotional scenes are incredible.  All other performers also portray their characters wonderfully.
""Whale Rider"" is a great movie for those looking for a powerful drama.  This will keep audiences interested and pleased for a long time.",1076716800,5,1282,5.160194174757281

1917692,5,B0000CABBW,"This is the fourth movie I've seen in the past two years about women standing up to ethnic cultural barriers to their growth and realization of who they are and who they can be.  (And let's be fair: it's not just ethnic cultures that have put women down. Our own American melting pot culture still does to a large degree.)  The others:
* Bend it Like Beckham
* My Big Fat Greek Wedding
* Real Women Have Curves
All four are excellent.  Whale Rider is the most serious of the bunch.  It also presents a culture (New Zealand Maori) that is probably the most foreign to Americans.  And that was intriguing to me for its own sake.
Whale Rider is about a group of Maori's waiting for a leader to be born.  That leader must be a man.  When young Pai, a girl is born, her grandfather largely rejects her because she is not the boy he wanted to come out of their kingly bloodline.  Pai secretly learns the ways of the Maori, including the ways of Maori warriors.  She learns and loves these things far more than the boys her grandfather identifies as potential leaders, including her own father and uncle.  She becomes the leader, and her grandfather finally realizes he has been wrong.
One of the things I love about all of these movies is that the women reject the denigrating aspects of their cultures while still being present and choosing to love their families.  They embrace the noble and beautiful aspects of their cultures, while overcoming that which would keep them down.  In doing this, they show that culture can adapt and grow and still be beautiful and relevant.
This is a beautiful movie.  It says much without a lot of words.  The actors, including and especially the actress who plays Pai, are excellent.",1076544000,,1714,4.54071661237785
1917693,4,B0000CABBW,"""Whale Rider"" is not a typical film in the Hollywood tradition.  It has no big name stars, is filmed entirely in New Zealand and often dwells in the darker side of people.  Although, having said that, the film does have a happy ending and thus ends on a positive tone.
I cannot truly say that I enjoyed the film and although Keisha Castle-Hughes has been nominated for an Oscar as best actress, I think this, in itself, overstates what is a worthy film without ever being great.  In fact, although the characters are quite believable, I had some difficulty empathising with them.
For Americans, which is where all films try to succeed, I would recommend another New Zealand film as an introduction to this genre.  That is, rather than see ""Whale Rider"", try to locate a copy of ""Once were Warriors"".

This is a classically constructed 21st-century fable of generational and gender conflict in which the old ways compete with progressive ideas and an individual female voice attempts to be heard in a patriarchal society. As the heroine, Pai, Keisha Castle-Hughes is a real find - possessed of a glorious screen face, with her dark unruly hair framing strong features and piercing eyes locked in concentration or scowling at the weight of her destiny. In a film of many delights, her mesmerising performance carries the conviction not just of a natural born leader but of a natural born star.",1075593600,2,715,4.868852459016393

1917696,4,B0000CABBW,"WHALE RIDER is one of those independent sleepers that happens to catch the hearts of the movie audience, much like MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING etc. Simple stories with universal truths told well.  This could easily be a National Geographic documentary for all its beauty of New Zealand. But it has much more: the little known Maori people of New Zealand have been celebrated by such well known descendants as soprano Kiri Te Kanawa who introduces Maori folksongs on her highly lauded performances throughout the world, but rarely have we been given the insights into a wondrous strange reflection of our tribal beginnings as we have here.
WHALE RIDER is a simple tale of a tribe who are dependent upon the firstborn males to carry on the wisdom of the ancients. When Piakea (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is born her twin MALE brother dies as does her mother.  Paikea's claim to the line of chieftains is denied by her grandfather and the townspeople, only serving to encourage Paikea to prove that she is deserving of the role to which she feels she is born.  The means by which she gains her rightful place fill out this story.  There is a tearful speech about her history and beliefs that brings tears to everyone's eyes, and there is a panoramic miracle of whales beaching that is staggering in its impact.
To this reviewer's eyes it is the skill of the Director Niki Caro that deserves the accolades being heaped on Keisha Castle-Hughes.  Yes, she performs well and is directed keenly and sympathetically by Caro through some lovely scenes, but is this ""performance"" really deserving of an Oscar when such brilliant actors such as Cate Blanchett, Nicole Kidman, Frances McDormand, etc etc have polished their craft through long commitment?  I wonder why all the need to grant an award to a child who hopefully will grow into such company.",1075334400,,1832,4.818471337579618
1917697,5,B0000CABBW,"I watched the movie on a plane. I happened to have read about the film on some Internet newspapers, which was fortunate, as I would have picked ""Pirates of Caribbean"" if I had not known anything about this film.
I was practically blown away by Keisha Castle-Hughes' performance. I was mesmerized by the Maori backdrop and the tale of the whale rider. I was moved to tears when I watched Castle-Hughes dedicate her tribal dances to her stubborn grandfather. I held my breath when I awaited to know her fate as she became associated with the ""whale rider"". The main theme for the first two-third of the movie is about the suffering of Castle-Hughes' character because of the rejection by her grandfather, who, although in fact loved her a lot, just could not contemplate a female should become a leader as he was so stuck with traditions, and her determination to prove herself again and again. She wanted to prove that she could do as well as (maybe even better than) other body, but she never did it in an aggressive or assertive way. I think this is a major difference between this movie and some other ""teenager strive for success"" movies. It shows the inner strength of Castle-Hughes' character, which will be an important asset if she ever becomes the tribe's leader.
The movie also provides a realistic picture of how the life of the Maori is like in modern-day New Zeland when they choose to stay together as a tribe community. Their life is simple, and material comfort is never rich but not primitive. And children go to schools in town.
Keisha Castle-Hughes carried the movie from start to finish, and left an unforgettable impression to the viewers. The grandfather and grandmother characters also gave terrific performance.
I ended up watching the film twice as it was replayed again on the plane. I never regretted missing ""Pirates of Caribbean"" -- I later watched ""Pirates"" in a full-fledged home theater environment but even so, I still judge ""Whale Rider"" to be a far more memorable film in 2003. Yes, ""Pirates"" got multiple Oscar nominations including best film, but I truly believe Keisha Castle-Hughes deserves her BEST LEADING ACTRESS OSCAR nomination, and the youngest nominee to boast (just 13, can you believe it?!!)
I bought this DVD and plan to watch it many times in future. I sincerely recommend you to do the same.",1075248000,7,2341,4.797029702970297
1917698,5,B0000CABBW,"I am so glad I bought the DVD!  The behind the scenes commentary is interesting all by itself.  Keisha Castle-Hughes was chosen by the same person who chose Anna Paquin, and she does not disappoint.
Whale Rider is, in part, about the struggle for acceptance and respect.  Here is Pai, a small 12 year old girl, always trying to please her Grandfather.  Yet she knows the story of her tribe.  Her mother was to give birth to the next chief in the family.  Instead, they got her.  This story transcends the Maori culture, for every child strives to be accepted by their parents.  Be it the first born, who has to live up to the parents expectations.  The middle child, overshadowed by an older sibling.  Or the youngest child, often overlooked for anything great.  Pai, though often rejected, stayed strong to her intuition that she could be great.  Her esteem, in the face of non-acceptance is what makes this film so worth seeing, for any young girl and boy, and adults as well.
Whale Rider also has a beautiful score.  Music of the ocean, of whales, haunting.  Peaceful as the New Zealand landscape.",1074816000,,1100,4.632124352331606

It is a slow-moving and some would say somewhat predictable story of self-discovery (though one set in an unusual cultural environ for most) but it's an absolute joy to follow the lead character on her journey none-the-less. Given the outstanding quality of her acting, there's no question you will be emotionally moved (probably to tears) before the end. Highly recommended.",1074470400,4,559,5.222222222222222

1917701,4,B0000CABBW,"This is a beautiful movie, and it has the kind of balance one finds in well written literature. Whale Rider could of easily fell into a politically correct trap -- with the Maori tribal traditions as partrichal as the Catholic Church, and, when frozen in the past, as close-minded.  But the movie's approach is understated.  It is also gentle and wise, suggesting that tradition does have a great deal to teach, but it is best understood when past, present, and future are equally considered when searching for wisdom. In other words, by maintaining a healthy tension between the three, only then can we hear the quiet voice that seeks to guide us, whether it be through whales, the Ancients, or God.
There is a point in the movie when I felt a powerful, but tragic, ending could of been chosen. (You will know it when you see it.) And what follows that moment is to some extent a feel good ending (leaving me with a few questions as to How?). But that, in this case, is nitpicking. Whale Rider is truly about heart -- and hope, and not about cold art. Whale Rider is one of those rare movies that can teach lessons, and in the best way, with gentle nudges.",1073606400,3,1157,4.478672985781991
1917702,5,B0000CABBW,"Whale Rider is a powerful and lovely film made by a insightful director, hard working cast, and a star-in-the-making, Keisha Castle-Hughes. Where has she been hiding?! I saw this movie three times within three weeks, once driving to Santa Monica (an hour trip) to see it with my sister and her two daughters. I suggest, no urge, anyone with daughters to see this movie. It is a strong, positive role model for women.
This movie affected me very deeply. Last summer, I seemed to be surrounded by blow'em up and kill'em movies, and I was waiting for a more hopeful film. I got it with Whale Rider. HOPE is the operative word. I'm reminded of Bloom County's dandelion break - remember the cartoon strip? - WR was the best dandelion break I've had in years!
The film is quite different than Witi's book, but very dramatic all the same.  Especially interesting were the cultural scenes of the Maori. I found their tribal hall fascinating. The singing scenes were also haunting. What beautiful rituals!
Keisha Castle-Hughes was a wonder in front of the camera. Her debut no less! I was stunned. I have never seen a young performer so comfortable with her emotions. She had such a sense of presence in such a young person, it was almost scary to watch. You couldn't help but feel her despair, happiness, pride. She was so on, so believable! She will be a breakout star.  All the cast members were also great. The ensemble cast worked seamlessly together. I fervently hope this film does well at the awards - then maybe someone will make more like this. The soundtrack CD is also good!
I can't say enough about this film without sounding like a blithering idiot. GO SEE IT, in the theater is best, but if not, on DVD or Video. Just see it! You will come away with a hopeful wish for all life.",1073520000,7,1784,4.554517133956386
1917703,5,B0000CABBW,"Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is the only grandchild of a Maori chief, and when he states that he will begin training the male first-born of the tribe to replace him, she doesn't accept this verdict, but quietly and confidently sets about learning the skills she will need and proving to everyone but him that she is the right person for the job. Will he eventually come around? Considering this is considered a ""feel good"" movie and ""female empowerment"" film, chances are he will, but how this comes about is worthwhile and entertaining. Castle-Hughes is outstanding at the head of a great cast. This is a great film for the family or anyone interested in other cultures.

DVD extras include featurettes about filming, building the waka (ceremonial canoe) and the soundtrack; commentary with writer-director Niki Caro; 8 deleted scenes; trailer and tv spot; and stills.  The film can be heard only in English but subtitled in English or Spanish.",1073347200,3,943,5.0
1917704,4,B0000CABBW,"A magnificant little odyssey that will warm the heart with genuine sentiment and delight the senses with gorgeous New Zealand oceanic scenes. Thankfully, this 'feel-good-movie' accomplishes just that through a compelling simple story, wonderful performances, and a high regard for the indigenuous peoples of New Zealand. Keisha Castle-Hughes is brilliant as the young girl, even a tear-jerking speech in an emotion packed scene is delivered with great deft and restraint and she has a beautiful singing voice, bringing much clarity and exposure to indigenuous tribal songs. So real was the traumatic beached whales scene that I was scrambling through the end credits to insure no actual whales were harmed, and of course it was all a brilliant special effect. For fans of this film, the DVD offers a ""Making of Whale Rider"" documentary in which cast and crew deservedly talk about the wonder of this beautiful film.",1072915200,2,915,5.2312925170068025
1917705,5,B0000CABBW,"When this film first came out, I bypassed it in favor of films with well-known casts and lots of marketing. When I eventually got the DVD (rental), I was disappointed -- in that I did not take the time to see it sooner.  And while I've been told that the movie is quite different from the book, and that as a coming of age film, it rehashes over-used themes, it is still a film well-worth seeing.
In presenting us with how a headstrong young girl tries to find her place in her Maori tribe against the wishes of her stubborn grandfather-chief, Whale Rider shows how tradition need not clash with modernity, but can meld with it to create new ways of living and being.  And that change can bring hope and not necessarily calamity.  The artful use of foreshadowing and juxtapositioning of the old and the new, of various motifs, to make this and other points is elegant.  Take, for instance, the temporal symbols of transportation: the unfinished waka (an ancient maori boat) used by the ancients, the bicycle used by Pai and Koro (a mildy sophisticated invention), the tractor used by Uncle Rawiri (a deleted scene, but later it is used to try to free a beached whale), and Pai with her father in his (rental) Ford Focus (a symbol of modern 21st Century technological prowess). And there are a myriad of others.  There is an underlying feminism here, too. The girl Pai (short for Paikea, a boy's name) striving to assume the role of tribal leader, a position reserved for the first-born males.  And Nanny Flowers as the only woman who can say no to grouchy paternalistic Koro.
There are also subtle references to the social and economic plight of the Maori.  A careful view of the film will easily reveal all the nuances and references to problems that the Maori -- like so many cultures face: of absentee fathers, of crime and jail (Hemi's dad), of the troubles of the working class versus the elite, of outmarriage, the abandonment of tradition, disrespect for elders, etc.  (I later found that some of these points are spelled out in the deleted scenes, but the editors were wise to delete them.  The subtleties in the plot and script say it all.)
In some ways, this film is a treatise on the tough choices that so many indigenous groups have to make: stick to their old ways and risk death, or adapt to the new, the different, -- and prosper and survive.
This, then, is a wonderful film, for both adults and children, engaging, witty, poignant, beautfully written and filmed. Hats off to all involved, especially Ms. Caro for the script and Ms. Castle-Hughes -- believable as Pai, an unbelievable feat for an 11-year old girl (now 13) with no prior acting experience.
If there are any flaws in the film, it would be that things go too well for Pai, that things are too predictable; but, perhaps, that is the beauty of this film, that, like fairy tales, happy endings usually are the norm.

1917706,4,B0000CABBW,"This film is wholly dedicated to the Maori people, serving as a tribute to their culture and combining myth, folklore and the current status of its people; also the (fruitless?) effort to preserve the Maori culture for the future. I finally understood the ""sticking of the tongue"" act of war, and not only that. I think that on a broader scale the film deals with what seems to be the main problem of the Maori, the conflict of the past and modern times and the next generation trying to find its place in the world.
However, first and foremost the film deals with the issue of the successor. Who is a true successor? Is it destiny that decides or can one prove himself fitting? According to tradition the male son born to the Maori leader will continue its ways. The girl, Pai, although fitting by nature cannot take its place until she proves herself right through hardships and pain and the aid of some supernatural forces. I was bothered by the fact that in this film there is the same problem as other movies or stories dealing with a ""different"" child (slow, handicapped, etc.) which cannot be accepted by society until he does something extraordinary - saves the day in some way.
Only after an act of great courage and sacrifice does the different child (or girl in this story) can be accepted for what she is. Here the ""accepting"" needs to be done by  Kuru, the grandfather as she is only a girl and he is fighting so hard to preserve the culture. Contrary to other viewers, I do not think that Pai was totally rejected by her grandfather. It seems that he has been spoiling her for years (the bicycle scene) and thus has given her a very confident nature. At a certain phase (after his eldest son leaves) he seems to reach a decision to harden his heart and ""do the right thing"" according to his belief (train a male heir). At least this is the way I understood the movie and I felt it does a good job in delivering Kuru's torn heart.
Several problems are briefly hinted about but not really dealt with: Rawiri, the second son grows fat and lazy over the years. Movie shows that his life style includes lots of drinking and billiard playing. His mother explanation to his deterioration is the fact that he is the second son. Is this enough? On the other hand his father says to him on another occasion: ""The people will do this for you"" hinting that Rawiri does have leadership qualities. This is not further investigated and Rawiri (contrary to Pai) does not fight for his place. Another issue is one of the first sons (Heime?) that seems to be ""marked"" by Kuru as his successor however is rejected at a certain stage (before the necklace picking test) why? I did not understand (is it his father? The fact that he liked Pai?. Another issue is the husband-wife relation: ""I have my ways over him"" says the strong opinionated grandmother but this too is not fully materialized.

The story is just amazing, powerful. And the soundtrack score is so perfectly matched and subtle that one barely knows it's there (reminds me of the soundtrack to ""Monster's Ball"").

His first-born son refused this role, and so he awaited his first-born grandson.  However, this grandson died at birth, as did the mother.  Pai - the twin sister - survived.  And while she had enough spirit to win over her grandfather's affection & love, she could never erase his blame & disappointment that she was the one that lived.

1917709,4,B0000CABBW,"Based on the novel by Witi Ihimaera, Whale Rider is an intelligent independent film by director Niki Caro. This is a poignant and powerful coming of age tale and also the story of a people who are struggling to maintain their identity and the old ways. There are strong mythical components to the film. The underwater shots of whales, and a young girl who seems to sense their presence and commune with them, are mystical and breathtaking. And the scenes of Maori dance and the narration of their mythology are extraordinary.
The film is set on the eastern coast of New Zealand, which is inhabited by an ancient people, the Whangara. The narrator is a wonderfully expressive young actress, Keisha Castle-Hughes. She gives a riveting performance as Paikea, (called Pai), a twelve year-old Maori girl with the blood of royalty in her veins and the heart of a warrior in her chest. The movie opens with Pai narrating a Whangara myth. Legend has it that the native people came to New Zealand following their leader, Paikea, (who Pai is named for), a boy who heroically rode on the back of a whale. Traditionally, tribal leadership has always gone to the direct descendants of that first leader and always to the first born male of the noble line. Tragedy occurs, however, when fraternal twins are born into that line, a boy and a girl. The girl lives, the boy does not, and the mother perishes along with her son as a result of a difficult birthing. The chain of leadership is broken with their demise. Pai's father, an artist, can not come to grips with the deaths of his wife and son and so he leaves New Zealand, and Pai, who is cared for by her paternal grandparents.
Years pass and Pai, at age twelve, has absorbed as much Maori knowledge as she is able from her grandfather Koro, (Rawiri Paratene), who is disapproving of his granddaughter's seemingly insatiable appetite to become a Maori leader. He has never quite forgiven her for being born a female, nor for living while her brother died. She exudes a true warrior's spirit and courage, which her grandfather refuses to see. Koro is desperately searching for a prophet - someone to lead his people ""out of the darkness and who will make everything all right again."" When Koro starts a school for young boys, all first-born, to teach the old traditions, Pai is forbidden to attend. She desperately wants her grandfather's love and has some pretty tough abandonment issues to deal with - her father, who left her when she was an infant and her beloved grandfather who is emotional unavailable to her. I will not spoil the plot by revealing more. This film is must-see.
The photography and landscapes, both underwater and above, are absolutely magnificent. The acting is marvelous and from the heart. Pai's and Koro's love-hate relationship, the tension between them, is nothing short of powerful. And I guarantee you will need a pack of Kleenex at the film's end.

1917714,4,B0000CABBW,"""Whale Rider"" is a wonderful film about a young girl, Paikea, named for, according to the legend of her Maori people, rode a whale to New Zealand, and is the father of all Maoris. Paikea was meant to have a twin brother, who would have been the firstborn boy in the family, but he, along with Pai's mother, died seconds after he was born. Pai's father leaves the hospital, and his family, leaving her sympathetic grandmother, and her disappointed grandfather, the current chief of the tribe, to take care of her.
As Pai grows older, she becomes more and more interested in her roots, and believes that she is destined to become a leader. This becomes even more apparent to her when a visit from her father reveals that he is starting a new life and a new family in Germany. However Pai's grandfather, Koro, has very different plans in mind. Girls are not allowed to become Maori leaders. So he begins training young local boys to be cheifs, bringing an end to his family's reign as cheifs. But Pai continues to try and prove herself, ending with an amazing sequence that leaves you with the question ""How on earth did they do that?""
Despite the plot, ""Whale Rider"" is not necessarily a girl power film. Nor is it just a coming-of-age film. It is a story about the conflict between old traditions and modern development, and finding a compromise in which the two can meet. The score is really haunting and beautiful, and the filmmaking is seamless. Even the story is well developed, and very believable. And, if you really want to know the answer to the question ""how on earth did they do that?"" there is a wonderful behind the scenes segment on the DVD that will surely answer all the questions you can pose, and more.

1917719,4,B0000CABBW,"This year has been marvelous in the theatrical release of movies that aim to enrich and encourage young girls to bypass cultural boundaries that hold them back from the biological aspect that they were born female. In a similar fashion to BENDING IT LIKE BECKHAM, WHALE RIDER is a story of a young Maori girl living in New Zealand who desires to become the new tribal leader. But because Pai was born a girl her grandfather prohibits her from learning the cultural traditions. Pai is then forced to sit on the sidelines while other first-born boys are taught the ancient ways of their ancestors. Her stern and strict grandfather often reprimands her and she is determined to prove herself worthy of the post of the new chef.
Although there are obvious similarities between these two films, WHALE RIDER contains a more richly textured and nuanced plot. The most compelling part of the story is the anthropological plotline whereby a culture must face its own mortality in a modern world. When old customs and traditions have lost their meaning for every day life, why keep them going? The surprises in the script are not in how it will turn out, but in the matter-of-fact honestly of the characters. Interesting view of a different culture, and well acted.

1917721,5,B0000CABBW,"Twelve-year-old Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes)is the only surviving heir to the chief(Rawiri Paratene)of a Maori tribe that is losing touch with its traditions.  As a girl, however, she is not qualified to assume this position.  Pai feels a tremendous load of guilt and responsibility toward both her people and her stern grandfather as a result--she feels that she can be the kind of leader her people need if only she were given a chance.  This fine film explores the tension between the necessity and inevitability of change as well as the importance of respecting tradition.
The cast of this film is magnificent.  Castle-Hughes gives the finest performance by a child actor that I have ever seen--even better than Sean Nelson in ""Fresh.""  Her Pai seems completely natural, strong yet vulnerable.  Paratene and Vicky Haughton, who plays Pai's grandmother, also deserve special mention.",1068249600,,884,5.23404255319149
1917722,5,B0000CABBW,"""Whale Rider"" is a remarkable and exquisite movie from New Zealand. Disregard the MPAA's clueless ""PG-13"" rating. This film is suitable for viewers aged ten to a hundred. And, for once, we have a movie which lifts one's spirits - indeed, makes them soar - without resorting to gross sentimentality, banal, manipulative dialog or predictable plot turns.
This is the story of a young girl, Paikea [Keisha Castle-Hughes]. and her family, all of whom are part of the Maori population in New Zealand. The Maori were the original settlers of the island. They arrived many hundreds of years before the British, and in the remote part of the country where Paikea lives, they have retained much of their culture. One of their legends is that the original chief arrived in New Zealand on the back of a whale.
Paikea is born in tragedy. Her mother dies in childbirth, and her twin brother is stillborn. Her grandfather, Koro [Rawiri Paratene], is a local Maori chief who begs the baby's father, Poro [Cliff Curtis], to start another family as soon as possible, but the heartbroken Poro decides to leave the country and pursue his ambitions as an artist. This leaves Koro and his wife, Flower [Vicky Haugton], to raise Paikea.
The movie moves quickly forward to Paikea at age twelve. It is obvious that the girl and her grandfather have closely bonded. Their rift is simple: Koro can not accept the idea that a girl could ever be a Maori chief, but Paikea otherwise embodies everything that is Maori. She is almost literally the whale rider reborn.
Castle-Hughes is the center of the movie, and she is, as other critics have noted, a star in the making. I have not seen a child carry a movie as well as she does since Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"". Hers is a stunning performance, and one can only hope that she can build from this role, as opposed to being defined by it.
The photography is magnificent, as is the music score. All of the movie's elements work together to produce a work that is both magical and meaningful.",1068163200,2,2021,4.663865546218488
1917723,5,B0000CABBW,"I hate to call this a great family movie because of the connotations that term has acquired.  This is a very fine film for adults, kids, and teenagers.  Some make a great deal out of the ""girl power"" or feminist aspects of the story.  I don't see that as much as I see ""people power"".  The hero of the story is a heroine.  She happens to be a girl in a dying male dominated Maori.  Her being a female excludes her - but it could have been anything that made her an outsider.  And this otherness blinds the grandfather to all her magnificent qualities.  And the blindness creates more hurt and loneliness than should be borne by anyone.  The young girl, Pai, has such strength that her ache is not a burden so much as it is a furnace that heats her passion for the sacred in her culture.  She will not stop or quit.  She cannot be discouraged by the hurt and pain in her life because she has never known anything else.  She demands her own place and her own life not be defeating anyone else, but by simply taking her own place without asking permission.  She becomes a source of strength and uplift for everyone else.
Pai's is a quiet determination.  She cannot be dominated, but she doesn't destroy that which rejects her.  She ignores that which rejects her while embracing and nourishing herself on the Maori legends.  She is just a magnificent person and the actress who plays her is superb.  Well, the whole cast is superb.  You will want to watch it with your whole family because of the strength of this child and the way it handles family pain.  It can spark some wonderful discussions.
The photography is beautiful and adds to the poetry and mystery of the story.  It is worth watching many times.",1068163200,4,1706,4.42443729903537
1917724,5,B0000CABBW,"A film by Niki Caro
This movie opens in a hospital.  A Maori woman is giving birth to twins.  The grandfather of the children has been waiting for the birth of a child to be the new chief of the tribe.  Two children are born: one male, one female.  The male child dies along with the mother.  The grandfather is disappointed and already starts on his son to find a new wife so that the son can have another male child.  The son rebels and runs away from his family.  The baby girl that the grandfather resented is left in his care.  We skip forward enough years to get us into the present and the baby girl has grown into a young girl (early teenage years, perhaps) named Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes).
With the tribe needing a chief, and Pai not being a boy, Pai's grandfather decides to train the tribe's youth in the old ways, in the hopes that one of them will grow to be the next chief.  Pai is the closest to living the old ways as any of the children of the tribe, but the little problem of her being a girl keeps coming up.  She is forbidden to train with the boys, but practices on her own.  The movie is mostly the conflict between Pai and her grandfather and how she fits into the tribe.  We all know how this movie has to end, but there is little (or no) clich in the journey Whale Rider takes us on.  The movie succeeds on the strength of young Keisha Castle-Hughes' performance.  With a theme that suggests the movie will be nothing more than yet another ""uplifting"" story filled with emotion and cheese, Whale Rider turns out to be one of the year's best (and I say this with confidence) as it rises above the cheese-potential and succeeds as a powerful film.",1068076800,,1671,4.280254777070064
1917725,5,B0000CABBW,"This film is simply astonishing. It is so simple, and yet, sweet, and ultimately, profound. Somehow, it encapsulates in a timely fashion what has become the greatest challenge to ALL of our tribes, the painful and challenging encounter between the modern world, and the archaic realities.

Each of us blindly and steadfastly carries on the traditions of the culture into which we were born. For many, loyalty and adherrance to tradition and ceremony give them their most important sense of identity and the greatest meaning to their lives. To suggest that they abandon these traditions, or alter them, can be the most threatening experience they can know.

And yet...A crab, a snake, even a toad must shed its skin in order to grow larger. If evolution and growth mean constant change, how can one be rigidly loyal to a tradition and yet nurture and support helpful, healing growth? This issue lies at the heart of this story.

When one is deep in a tradition, it is easy to forget the original, monumental events that gave rise to the perseverance of the tradition in the first place. These events are always seminal. They are primary. They frequently define the prevailing fashions in terms of shock! and awe! They are generally a significant and dramatic breakthrough of some kind. Then comes the repetition of blind submission to the symbols of the original events.

In this film, the conflict between hide bound adherance to the old, and natures attempt to create something new and fresh, give rise to a great struggle between the present and the past that ultimately is only reconciled when the mighty voices of the Old Ones speak, with ultimate authority, what can only be the final word on the subject.

There is so much to be enriched by, spiritually, in this film that it is almost too much to bear. Exquisitely beautiful, haunting, there are subtle lessons upon which one may reflect at great length.  It is a film to drink deeply.",1067817600,3,1942,4.816816816816817
1917726,4,B0000CABBW,"Niki Caro's Whale Rider is one of the small films that makes you think about your place in the world. The film delves into the hard questions with such ease that the casual viewer finds himself swept up in the story without really thinking about its implications.
The story follows the Maori legend of the Whale Rider who came to New Zealand on the back of a whale and established a colony for his people. Every generation chooses as its chief the first born son of the current tribal chief. Problem is that the current son of the chief is an artist in Germany and hisd first born son died at birth leaving only his daughter Pai (Keisha Castle Hughes). What develops is a conflict between Pai and the old ways of the tribe represented by her grandfather. Maori actor Rawini Paratene in what should be an Oscar nominated performance plays the old chief with great power.
The principle issue is empowerment and the film deals with the young girl who would be chief with great emotion. This is family filmaking of the highest order and a great film to watch over again. All in all this is what independent filmaking is about: its smart, friendly and not afraid to embrace the larger questions of life.
The DVD offers a director commentary, deleted scenes, two featurettes on the making of the film and a neat soundtrack feature featuring highlights of the score by composer Lisa Gerrard.
Do yourself a favor and see this one. You'll be glad you did.",1067817600,,1446,4.586872586872587
1917727,5,B0000CABBW,"One of the rarest things in movies is a kid who comes across as a real kid on screen.  The performance of Henry Thomas in ""E.T."" had even more to do with that film's success that the animatronic alien and ""Whale Rider"" is graced by a similar performance by young Keisha Castle-Hughes.  But there is also a captivating story that challenges the audience rather than simply following convention.  No wonder this film kept winning audience awards from Toronto to Sundance.
The story is of young Paikea Apirana, a Maori girl of New Zealand.  The day she was born both her mother and her twin brother died.  Her father, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis) is the eldest son of the chief, Koro (Rawiri Paratene), who has been awaiting the birth of his grandson, convinced the boy will grow up to reunify the Maori and lead them into the future.  But Koro has no need for a granddaughter.  His son, who is an artist and not a leader, leaves New Zealand, his father, and his daughter behind, but not before one final act of defiance: he names his daughter Paikea, after the legendary ancestor of their people who rode the whale from Hawaiiki to this land.  Koro tells his wife (Vicky Haughton) to take the baby away, but she thrusts the baby into his arms, demanding he acknowledge his granddaughter, telling her husband, ""She likes you.""
The story continues a dozen years alter.  Pai's father returns for a brief visit to renew the ancient conflict with his father by bringing news of a pregnant girlfriend in Germany.  In a burst of anger Koro tells Porourangi to take Pai with him when he leaves because she is of no use to him.  Pai overhears this and while we would expect her to be devastated, she is not: she knows her grandfather's heart better than he does himself and even to be with her father she will not leave Koro and her community.  Without ever forcing the matter director Niki Caro, who also did the screenplay from Witi Ihimaera's novel, makes it clear that young Pai is the future of her people and wise beyond her years.
At one point in the film Pai says recalls her family history and adds, ""But I was not the leader that my grandfather was expecting.""  This is certainly true, but the great irony of this 2003 film is that Pai a leader beyond the old man's expectations.  She proves this not only in the wonderful climatic scene of ""Whale Rider,"" but during the most poignant and heartrending scene, when she gives a speech at a school concert that makes it clear that before she becomes a teenager she already knows exactly what her people need in terms of leadership for the future.  She also knows that she is keeping faith with her ancestors and her ancient namesake.
It is clear from the start that ""Whale Rider"" is a very good film.  It has the tone, the characters, and the story line of one.  But where it becomes a great movie is where it sets up the pivotal moment in the film, the point at which Koro will recognize the truth about his granddaughter and acknowledge that she is the leader he has been awaiting.  All of the pieces are in place and I would not be surprised if many viewers already have tears running down their cheeks.  But instead of the providing the obvious, ""Whale Rider"" transcends the awaited moment and gives us something larger and more wonderful.  We should not have been surprised because the film had an earlier opportunity to bridge the gap between Koro and Pai, as she has been successfully completing on her own all of the tests her grandfather is giving to the young boys of the village in his search for a new leader, but her grandmother, in a moment of understated epiphany declares, ""No.  He is not ready yet.""
The obvious impulse is to call this a magical film, but that misses the mark for me on two scores.  ""Whale Rider"" is not only mystical instead of magical, it has a grounded sense of reality as well.  Both Pai and Koro speak of their family and their people as going back countless generations to the ancient ones.  How else do you explain a climax that transcends mere metaphor and visual beauty?  ""Whale Rider"" should not be considered a children's movie, because few children of Pai's age would be able to appreciate the depth of this exquisite film.",1067644800,8,4212,4.547019867549669
1917728,5,B0000CABBW,"In a New Zealand coastal community, the long-awaited arrival of a Maori tribe's next leader is frustrated when the male grandchild of the Maori Chief dies in childbirth, along with his mother, leaving a surviving twin sister. The infant's father, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis) names the girl Paikea after the first Maori of legend who came to New Zealand on the back of a whale, the name intended for her deceased brother. Unable to face his father's expectations and tribal life after the death of his wife and son, Porourangi leaves New Zealand to pursue a  career abroad and leaves his young daughter in the care of her grandparents, Koro (Rawiri Paratene), the tribe's Chief, and Nanny Flowers (Vicky Haughton). The precocious and fearless child, whom everyone calls Pai, wins the heart of her grandparents. But her grandfather still openly laments that Pai is not a boy who could inherit the responsibilities of chief, and he is anxious about his people's fate without a leader to guide them. When Pai  (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is 12 years old, she begins to think that she might be that leader, in spite of her gender. And her refusal to yield to the traditions which prohibit her from assuming a leadership role threaten to irreparably damage her relationship with her grandfather.

""Whale Rider"" is inspired by the children's novel of the same name by Maori novelist Witi Ihimaera. It was adapted for the screen and expertly directed by New Zealander Niki Caro. This is a very lyrical film that is perfectly paced, so the audience never has a chance to get bored. The characters are all down-to-earth people who are nevertheless not simplistic, and each is sympathetic in his or her own way. The beautiful imagery of the New Zealand coast and the Maori traditions are a pleasure to watch. But the film deals with the universal themes of the traditional coming into conflict with the new and the younger generation with the old. The entire cast is excellent. And newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes is nothing short of astounding. Her portrayal of Pai is luminous and completely convincing. She pulls the audience into this story the minute she appears on screen. ""Whale Rider"" is an enchanting film which both children and adults will enjoy.

The DVD: Bonus features include: theatrical trailers, tv spots, deleted scenes, a ""behind the scenes"" documentary, a documentary of the construction of a Maori war canoe for the film, 5 tracks from the film's score, and a photo gallery. I recommend both documentaries. One is a ""making of"" sort of thing, with interviews with the film's director and cast. The other is called ""Te Waka: Building the Canoe"" and explains how artists used both traditional and modern methods to construct a ceremonial Maori war canoe for the film in less than a month. The 5 complete tracks from the film's score are also a very nice bonus and may help you decide if you want to purchase the film's original score by composer Lisa Gerrard.",1067644800,29,2958,4.886454183266932
1917729,5,B0000CABBW,"We are told at the outset of the story that a young girl's ancestors came to her land on the back of a whale, and that all the chiefs of her people are therefore descendants of that first early whale rider. Problem is, though, that the chief has to be a male, and this young lady is not, much to the grave disappointment of her paternal grandfather. Over time, the older man learns to love his granddaughter, but her femalehood is a bitter reminder of the endangered nature of their clan. He refuses to consider the girl as a possible chief in her own right, and begins to train all the boys nearby in the old traditions and rituals, looking for the next chief and protector of the the people. The young girl, however, is not to be outdone, and thereby hangs our Whale of a Tale.
""Whale Rider"" is a great entrant into the annals of the ""when old folks have to learn a lesson from young folks"" genre. The cast was unfamiliar to me, but every member gives a sterling performance and is utterly believable, whether as the young girl, the curmudgeonly grandfather, the more liberal-minded grandmother, or the goof-off uncle. The culture of these indigenous people is treated with reverence and respect, and the scenery Down Under is absolutely fabulous. The screenwriters do a creditable job, as well, in demonstrating that the grandfather's reaction to the girl is complicated: he has long ago learned to love her, but the concerns of his people and the lack of a male chief to take his place after him are causing him to reject her on many levels. Though we almost cry for her many times as the story goes on, we always know at the outset of such films that a happy ending will be pulled out somehow, and we are not disappointed in the end. ""Whale Rider"" is a great bildungsroman piece and I heartily recommend it to all takers.",1067558400,,1826,4.503012048192771

1917732,5,B0000CABBW,"The first time in a longtime that i can remember the audience clapping after a movie. nice.
It is a good tearjerker. Thoughtful with a good plot and character development underneath the extraordinary natural scenery of New Zealand.
It has two people's stories intertwined, the older Maori chief and his grandaughter. Simply it is how the two of them grow up and challenge the male-only tradition of chiefs.
Talent and ability don't know genetic boundaries as in a  hereditarial chiefship. Nor does it know gender boundaries, these are imposed on top of ability, motivation, and costs societies that depreciate women half of the available talent(at least, i bet more). but as long as everything is ok, throwing away women's contributions seems a small price to pay for male dominance. But the story is about a culture in decline and facing extinction, the Maori's can not afford to throw away talent and ability. And that is the plot.
Times change, so do the people if they wish to survive. But holding onto the past can help if the past greatness is re-interpreted anew for each growing up generation. And this is the big picture of the movie, this re-interpretation. Or as the movie puts it, the prophetic.
It's a good movie, bring a handkerchief and stop for coffee afterwards and discuss the meaning of your life, before the moment pass and the real world pushes ideas out of your head and substitutes the common boring everyday world-affairs.",1066953600,,1446,4.878048780487805

Her grandfather is the village elder who believes the chosen one will come and lead the people. Pai is a remarkable young girl who loves her grandfather and lives to please him and her people. Pai's grandfather is stubborn however and shuns her, believing that only a male can lead the people he schools the young males of the village in hopes of finding the one.

The film features a beautiful score and excellent performances by Keisha Castle-Hughes and Rawiri Paratene.
The DVD is presented in widescreen and features Dolby surround. The picture is clear and the sound is adequate for the film. There is a director commentary and a short making of as well. There are eight deleted scenes one in particular deals with a youth in trouble for breaking windows. I enjoyed the deleted material and the film works well without them. There are several TV spots and one theatrical trailer. Scene selection and menu access are easy and nothing of note.

Whale Rider explores race, religion, sexuality, culture, gender issues, family, loss, and love. But somehow the social issues are perfectly approached, not over-powering, and met with a understanding and realistic eye. The director, Niki Caro, has done such a remarkable job portraying the wide range of emotions capable of human beings. And I must say, the cinematographer of this film deserves a cookie.

1917735,5,B0000CABBW,"Whale Rider is a wonderful film. It captures the struggle of people at the edge of losing their distinct culture in a way that everyone can relate to.
The grandfather is very traditional, keeping alive the Maori legends and beliefs. However, his insistance that everything be as it always had been almost causes the community to become lost entirely. It is only the strength of soul in his granddaughter that rescues their history while, at the same time, taking it in a new direction.
The performances of all of the actors are noteworthy but it is Keisha Castle-Hughes (Pai) and Rawiri Paratene (Koro) who stand out the most.
So many times morals are banged over our heads but the messages in Whale Rider are much more subtle, despite being extremely powerful. There is no denial of the new way of doing things but a celebration of traditions and history.
This is definitely one of the best films I've seen.",1066521600,,908,4.716981132075472
1917736,5,B0000CABBW,"11 year-old newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes literally shines in this endearing and moving tale about a Maori girl Pai, whose belief conquers every obstacle before her.  You don't have to know the original book; you just have to see the radiating charm of Keisha as Pai.
When Pai was born, her twin brother was dead.  Though this misfortune didn't alienate the chief of the family Koro from his granddaughter, it is painfully obvious that he wanted a boy, not a girl.  Among the male-donimating tradition, Koro still seeks for the one to inherit the tradition of the people among the local boys, and starts to teach it in school.
But it is Pai, now grown up a lovely girl, who thinks that she is Paikea, the decendent of the Whale Rider who arrived there from the sea a long time ago.  Her zeal, however, unwittingly causes the wrath of her grandfather, who would not admit any female succeeding the name.  But Pai knows that she is right, and we too.
The simplicity of the story does not damage the film; it rather enhances it to the level of myth, and with the director's skillful descriptions of the Maori society where not everybody is happy to live, the film is given a colorful characters and some of the amusingly wry humor.
But it is Keisha Castle-Hughes who will impress you with her charms.  She is sweet, she is amiable, and most of all she is natural.  Castle-Hughes, who is 'discovered' by the same agent who found Anna Paquin, is a good testimony that you don't have to attend the acting school to be a star.
There are also great performance from Rawari Paratene as Koro, whose character might at first be looked at in the negative light.  He succeeds in raising his portrait of the grandfather to tragedy, and we are not angry with, but sorry for him.
Pai's speech given at the latter half of the film is one of the greatest moments in the movie history, easily matching the Auden quotations by John Hannah in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral.""  Her sincere words would never fail to move you, and that part alone is worth the time of your life.  In short, a must to see.",1066262400,3,2079,4.50531914893617

But I always watch a movie with an ear open for the kauna- the hidden meaning. Whale Rider touches my heart because it acknowledges those who are adrift in the ocean of change....not able to return to the past and unable to live in the present without numbing the pain of separation from ""something missing"". In this movie, the protagonists are able to make the leap from a traditional form or ritual to one that evokes the underlying spirit in a new form- a form that fulfills the needs of the changing times. This leap is one we must all face sooner or later. Whale Rider demonstrates the power of forgiveness over pain...a valuable tool for every seeker.

1917739,4,B0000CABBW,"I have invariably found that contrary to expectation, movies from New Zealand have a grim, dark aspect that belie the gorgeous pastoral landscapes which they also offer. This movie is no exception.
The movie is based on an creation myth of some of the Maori people who believe that Paikea, their ancestor,  came to the area on the back of a whale which rescued him when his canoe overturned.  Drawing on this myth, New Zealand writer, Witi Ihimaera, wrote the book on which this movie is based while he was living in New York, when he saw a whale spouting in the Hudson River. The movie has come about eighteen years after the book.
The movie centers on the relationship between a twelve-year-old Maori girl, Pai, who is cared for by her grandfather, Koro, a tribal chief, and his wife Nanny Flowers. Koro, who is eager to ensure tribal succesion, trains the first-born twelve year old boys of the community in the requsiite Maori traditions for leadership, but refuses to admit Pai to these classes over her vocal protests. Pai nonetheless secretly eavesdrops on these classes and begins to master the use of the traditional Maori club.
I will sparing some other details which should however not be missed when you watch this. The movie reaches a dramatic climax after a group of whales are beached and are doomed to languish until Pai attempts a dramatic feat which nearly costs her life. After this ordeal, she is finally accepted as heir to the tribe which finds renewed strength after this.
There is a palpable emotional depth to this movie which comes across not in the dialogue, but in the moving facial expressions and the silent language which binds this community.",1063497600,2,1674,4.768965517241379
1917740,4,B0000CABBW,"""Whale Rider"" is certainly a different kind of film, both in its setting among the modern Maori of New Zealand and its emotional story of a young girl facing the prejudices of her traditional grandfather, an elder chief. Grandfather hopes his grandchild will be a boy to carry on the chiefdom, but is disappointed when the child is born a girl. Already disillusioned by his own sons who live a more relaxed modern existence, Grandfather sets out to find another worthy lad among the village youth (some of whom are troubled by absent parents and near-poverty.) Despite angry rebuffs, the granddaughter persists in attempting to assert herself as a candidate to carry on the town's ancient legacy. There is a haunting spiritual undertone to the actions of this brave girl; if all this sounds like a far cry from slick and frivolous Hollywood, it is. I think it would be a mistake to pigeonhole the film by calling it ""charming"" as many have done, because in actual fact it's not all that charming - this is a gritty film full of strong sorrows, painful conflicts, and awkward situations. Indeed, the burdensome tone of heavy sorrow which covers most of the middle part of the film seems unrelenting at times, and just when you think and pray that things are going to get better, they keep on getting worse. The human inspiration which we have come to find takes a long time to get there, but when it does at last, it is moving and memorable.",1062115200,5,1440,4.650980392156863

Pi's grandfaher is awaiting the birth of his grandson so he can lead his people once again, like the legend of the Whale Rider led thier people to New Zealand. The child was born dead and thus only his twin sister survived, and, in her grandfather's eyes could never be the leader that the Maori People needed. The young girl loved her grandfather, and her heritage, and forgave his narrow mindedness because she understood his frustrations and wishes she could be the grandon he wanted. The girl ( Keisha Cstle-Hugess ) gives the most touching performance I have ever seen, worthy of an Oscar nomination. Also, the scenery is beautiful and witnessing some Maori dances customs was an added bonus. Great for a family or a date!",1061337600,,960,4.554913294797688
1917743,5,B0000CABBW,"This is the kind of film we need more of.  Not smarty-pants indies about losers spewing pop-culture reference, not four-way split-screen showoffs, and not jaded Gaspar Noe-style gorefests.  Rather, Whale Rider is an intimate, heartfelt story told with complete earnesty with skill and expressiveness, with acting to die for.
The enchanting Keisha Castle-Hughes deserves an Oscar nomination for a soulful, rich performance as Pai, the last heir in a long line of Maori chieftains, and an end to the bloodline according to tradition, by virtue of being a girl.  The heartbreaking opening sequence immediately sets the acting and emotional bars high, gripping the audience right off the bat.  One of the best openings of any film I've ever seen.  And when Castle-Hughes launches into the monologue that is the emotional core of the film, it's a moment of pure magic.  The last child performance with this level of emotional depth that I can remember is Jena Malone in Bastard Out of Carolina -- all the more impressive considering it's Castle-Hughes' first film.  She is definitely a star in the making, an actor of rare gift.
The rest of the cast is equally stellar:  Rawiri Paratene achieves just the right balance between gravity and likeability as Pai's grandfather Koro, making him the best kind of antagonist -- the one we sympathize with.  Vicky Haughton as Nanny and the incredibly versatile Cliff Curtis as Porourangi offer stirling supporting performances.
Aside from one or two minute editing choices in the dialogue scenes, I really find no flaw in this film.  The pacing slows down greatly near the end, but all to good effect; the cinematography is beautiful; director Niki Caro's shot choices and writing are both sharp and engaging; and Lisa Gerrard is in her element her, offering a minimalistic and repetitive, yet perfectly tailored score which serves the film well.  I'm not a big fan of all her work, finding her tendency to always use exotic music styles sometimes irritating (especially in The Insider, whose specific American angle was compromised by Gerrard's chants), but in Whale Rider, Gerrard is the perfect choice for a composer.
A gripping emotional experience, and a truly fine film that scales the heights.",1061164800,,2236,5.081967213114754
1917744,5,B0000CABBW,"Don't let all the ""tribe"" talk turn you away.  This is a modern day movie, about the remnants of a tribe of people in New Zealand.
Pai is the grand-daughter of the tribal chief.  He wanted a grandson.  Pai's twin brother died at birth, so there's just Pai.  The grandfather spends the whole movie trying to keep Pai from becoming what she must...
It's a struggle on many levels: the young tribal members who think the old ways are silly and stupid, but in the end embrace them anyway; the chief who wants to groom one of the first-born sons to be the new chief, but winds up with a little girl; the father who failed to produce a son to further the line of chiefs, and runs away to start a new life.
This movie is drama at its finest.  Pai, played by the adorable Keisha Castle-Hughes gives a fantastic performance.  All the performances are strong, the Niki Caro's directing is superb.  The story will pull you and and not let go.  I didn't look at my watch once.  If you're looking for fast action or thrilling adventure, go somewhere else.

1917746,5,B0000CABBW,"Niki Caro's ""Whale Rider"" (based on the novel by Witi Ihimaera) is an uplifting tale of tradition and inner strength. Twelve-year-old Pai (talented newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes) lives with her grandparents in a rural New Zealand town. Pai's mother and twin brother died in childbirth, and her artist father took off for Europe, where he now has a new (pregnant) girlfriend. Pai's brother was supposed to be the next chief of her tribe, and with his death Pai's grandfather Koro searches for a new (male) leader, failing to see that it is Pai that possesses the courage and talents of a chieftain.
The movie is filled with a haunting soundtrack by Dead Can Dance's Lisa Gerrard, including samples of traditional Maori music by Hirini Melbourne. The cinematography beautifully captures the many moods of light and shadow on mountains and sea, as well as stock footage of majestic whales. ""Whale Rider"" is an uplifting tale of love, loss, and courage, about tradition in the face of change, and believing in yourself.",1059868800,97,1015,5.011834319526627

It is Pai who shows him and her community the way to live, love and grow stronger with each other.
The scenery is beautiful and awesome.
Maybe at times, the movie was a little slow, but does show the passage of time within the faces and actions of its characters.

Of course the film is not the book, but a book is not a live performance, nor a reading, nor a conversation. If you have not seen this movie, you have missed something. If you have seen it you have been introduced to myth, to characters, to storytelling, to the Maori people. It is a brief introduction. You will want to know them better.

Not only do you get to see a glimpse of another culture, but you get to see a glimpse of your own. The heroic cycle in world mythology is followed pretty closely here, but in a different, even more triumphant way. A young girl overcomes gender stereotypes in her own culture (Maori), by ascending the social stratigraphy. The moral the movie teaches is GREAT for children, and also refreshing for adults such as myself. With all of the junk that is in the movie theaters these days (even in Art house theaters as of late), it is nice to see a movie such as this one.
""Whale Rider"" deserves AT LEAST a nomination for Picture of the Year, though it probably won't get it. The acting is superb, the directing is superb, and the visuals are breathtaking.",1059177600,3,849,4.483870967741935
1917752,4,B0000CABBW,"I find myself agreeing with the other reviewers. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film keeping me captivated from beginning to end. While the basic premise of the story line is retold in many stories (person overcomes a perceived ""handicap"" to flourish), the way it is told is a breath of fresh air and a good lesson in the basics of humanity that transcends all cultures. It was a delight to see that the culture of these Maori (indiginous tribe of New Zealand), particularly how their struggle is insync with the struggle of many cultures today who are losing their identity and roots to the ever emerging new world order. This movie is based upon fiction mixed with mythology and legend and should be perceived as such - failure to understand this might lead one to think the spirituality of it is overdone. This was the same plight for desenters of ""Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon"" who complained about the unrealistic martial art moves.
""Whale Rider"" is so much more than just a young girl who would become leader. This movie will not disappoint. BTW, I reserve full five stars for what I consider best in genre and this is very close but I still think ""Ran"" has this one beat.

1917754,5,B0000CABBW,"The psychic and social pull of assimilation is very strong. We all want to belong, to be like everyone else-hide from our roots, take on the identity of the majority, the whole.
Niki Caro takes on the mantle of the Maori of New Zealand in the sad, melancholy, unrelentingly tragic yet ultimately positive ""Whale Rider.""
Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is a young girl brought into Maori life with a couple of strikes against her: she is a female and she has survived the child bearing death of her mother and her twin, a brother who was destined to become a Chief. Her father leaves her with his parents and as she matures, she begins to develop the mystical, physical and leadership qualities of a Chief. But this is against nature says her grandfather, Koro and so begins the struggle between a grandfather and granddaughter; the struggle between the old ways and the new, the religious and the secular.
The performances are very truthful and appealing especially Vicki Haughton as Pai's grandmother, Nancy Flowers whose expressive eyes hold not only a bottomless well of love and caring but a world weary realization of the world as it is and not as her husband, Koro wishes it to be. Castle-Hughes's Kai is a marvel: all jumbled up emotions, gangly legs yet steadfastly committed to what she feels is her right and destiny. Her scene in which she recites an essay written for her grandfather will be remembered as one of the most emotionally open and tragic scenes in recent memory.
""Whale Rider"" is a view of a world to which we are not often privy. It is about tradition and family and roots. It is a glorification of and a return to a time and a place where the most basic emotions of family and fraternity are exalted.",1059004800,4,1721,4.645901639344262
1917755,5,B0000CABBW,"Set in modern day New Zealand, and yet of mythic proportions, this is a story of a 12-year old Maori girl who yearns to be come a chief of her people.  She's descended from a long line of chiefs, but the problem is that she is a girl.  Her grandfather loves her but dismisses her interest and tries to teach all the old ways to the boys of the village.  When she tries to learn too, he forbids it.
However, the girl, played by Keisha Castle-Hughes is very resourceful.  She gets an uncle to teach her what she needs to know and learns all the old customs and chants.  Eventually, there is a crisis.  And with the help of a little magic realism, she finally gets the recognition she has struggled for so much.
It's a beautiful story.  I learned about Maori culture and enjoyed the wonderful scenery of New Zealand.  I also loved the characters and rooted for the girl to finally get her dream.
However, the plot was a little too clear right from the beginning.  In spite of the obstacles the girl had to overcome, there was no doubt she would eventually win.  This kept the tension a little too low for my taste.
And yet I have to recommend this film.  It cannot be dismissed as just another story.  It has deep meaning and a lesson about going for a dream.  It's beautiful and touching.  And politically correct in a natural way.  You'll be glad to have seen it and walk out of the theater inspired and smiling.",1059004800,6,1411,4.3320610687022905
1917756,4,B0000CABBW,"Although I did not share the unbridled enthusiasm of several other reviewers for this film, I still strongly recommend it and understand why it strikes a responsive chord in so many people. It is a wonderful fable for our times, and simply yet emotionally tells a story that can deeply reasonate. However, while allegories such as WHALE RIDER allow the expression of powerful truths about our actions and existence, but also contain the problems inherent in the simplification engendered by such generalizations. The reviews of Shashank Tripathi (6/8/03), Joe Haschka (6/26/03)  and Laon (6/23/03) discuss this movie so articulately and mirror many of my feelings so well that I refer you to them and for for a more lengthy discusion of this film and the insights which they provide and with which I generally concur.
Keisha Castle-Hughes is Pai, a young girl whose mother and twin brother (and presumptive male heir who would revive his Maori's tribes fortunes in the tradition of the legendary WHALE RIDER) die in childbirth. Her grandfather, the Maori chief Koro (played by Rawiri Paratene), cannot see beyond his grief and bring himself to realize that the hope he had for his grandson to become his tribe's leader could be fulfilled by Pai. He loves Pai but is continually frustrated by her desire to step outside his traditional conception of her role; and she is deply hurt by his rejection of her attempts to learn the skills he wants her contemporary male counterpatrs to master. Koro and his wife Nanny (wonderfully played by Vicky Haughton with some of the real moments of humor coming from her performance) are raising Pai because her father and Koro's eldest son (Cliff Curtis) left New Zealand to escape the weight of his father's disappointment and his wife's death. The story is told as a straightforward narrative, but all the performances are very powerful. Castle-Hughes is amazing in her film debut, the moviegoer clearly is drawn into the story through her ability to seemingly relate to you from the screen. And the backdrop of the magnificent New Zealand coastal countryside is a visual treat.
At its simplest, this is about the universal themes of Girl Power, societal changes and the intergenerational conflicts that often result, progress vs. tradition, the nature of love, and the role that fate plays in our lives. However, my enthusiasm was tempered by a few factors. First, I found a liitle of the dialog difficult to understand, which both made the film slightly less enjoyable and meant that I might have missed some of the subtleties involved. Second, while it is a wonderful story the stubbornness of Koro seemed somewhat overdone in order to dramatize his conflict with Pai; the viewer understood the point without constantly being beat over the head about it. Last, the climactic ending seemed a little contrived and perhaps not totally true to the story, both to make writer-director Caro's point and perhaps also because messages of uplift, hope and redemption have a wider audience appeal than ambiguous or downbeat endings. But despite these criticisms I want to emphasize that this film suceeds in its goal; it is an enjoyable story with excellent performances that leaves the audience uplifted as it exits the theater.",1058918400,4,3260,5.0258780036968576
1917757,5,B0000CABBW,"this movies is deinitely ranking among one of the best movies of the year right now.  this is the kind of movie that makes drama wonderful.  the message that comes across the strongest is the message of love within the family.  the main character played by keisha castle-hughes is top notch and is incredibly impressive considering her young age.  you see every emotion come across her face i this movie and she is utterly believable.  this is a story about generational gaps and how the older generation holds on to beliefs so hard that they are willing to disregard family over tradition.  this movie has many female equality issues weaved into the story and each of them is well founded.  when the young girl's grandfather repeatedly tells her that she cannot participate because she is a girl he often pretends that she does not exist.  however on each of the tasks he teaches to the first born boys she is able to outdo all of them.  on more than one occasion she defies the odds and proves that she is the whale rider that the old traditions have spoken of, and the fact that she is female is just unacceptable to her grandfather.  there are many very emotional moment sin this film that could bring a tear to your eye.  i won't talk about them here because they are best experienced in the movie.  go and see this film it is well worth the time and money.  this is a nice glimpse into a people that are very unique and have ways that are not our own but still hold meaning for the people who descended from the whale rider.  it is also a story about love within the family and how almost losing something can make a person realize how much somethiong really means to them.  there is a lesson in this movie that reveals differences between the generations and how in actuality the opposing generations have equal leesons to learn from each other.  excellent film go and see it!",1058745600,,1883,4.478005865102639

1917759,4,B0000CABBW,"""Whale Rider"" was released on June 6th 2003, it is rated PG-13, and is 1 hour 45 minutes long. Whale Rider is directed by Niki Caro and is based on the book written by Witi Ihimaera. The main actor in this film is newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes who was selected from many hopefuls to play the role of Pai. Keisha performs her role extremely well and makes the film complete. Her performance is well balanced by that of Rawiri Paratene who plays Pai's grandfather Koro. Other actors in the film are Vicky Haughton who plays Flowers, Pai's grandmother, and Cliff Curtis who plays Porourangi, Pai's father.
Whale Rider is set in the coastal village of Whangara, New Zealand. It is the story of a young Maori girl, named Pai, and her fight to defy the hard set traditions of her people. The film is told through the eyes of Pai and begins tragically when her mother dies while giving birth to her twin brother. Porourangi is disgraced, as his son was supposed to carry on the line of chiefs, and so leaves the village indefinitely. Pai is left in the care of her grandparents, her grandfather, Koro, being the current chief of the tribe. Once Pai turns twelve Koro rounds up all the boys in the tribe and begins to teach them the ancient ways in hope of finding a new successor. Pai is not allowed to train as she is female so she seeks out the help of her uncle to teach her the customs. Her struggle begins, her aim being to break tradition and take her rightful place in the tribe.
The gorgeous scenery of New Zealand makes a perfect backdrop for this film and the carved meeting houses help to intensify the Maori culture; the visual quality is excellent. The acting in the film contributed to making the characters exceptional, they are very believable and the audience is able to relate to how they are feeling. Much of the music used in Whale Rider is traditional of the Maori people and incorporates song and dance; it has specific cultural significance and is characteristic of New Zealand.

A tale that is close to the heart of the Maori people, but one that can easily get audiences all over the world hypnotized by its beauty. Director Niki Caro brings to the screen the story of Pai (played by young actress, Keisha Castle-Hughes -watch for the next Anna Paquin), a Maori girl that descends from a mythical lineage, and is determined to challenge some traditions that are deeply rooted by her tough grandpa, who is frustrated at the lack of a prophet to help his people out of their situation.
In the process of telling the story of Pai and her indomitable spirit, the movie presents some of the most beautiful underwater and coastal landscapes, accompanied by the incredible music of Lisa Gerrard (ex-Dead Can Dance, and singer behind the music of Michael Mann's ""The Insider"" and ""Gladiator""). All in all, I haven't seen a movie that has touched me in so many different ways in a very long time.

1917766,5,B0000CABBW,"""Whale Rider"" is one of the best movies this year, and probably will be remembered as such at the end of 2003. It's full of haunting imagery, thought-provoking handling of universal themes, and family conflict. And there's a bit of the awe-inspiring and magical near the end as well.
When Paikea (Keisha Castle-Hughes) was born, her mother and twin brother died. Her heartbroken father fled to Europe, leaving her in the care of her rigidly traditional grandfather Koro (Rawiri Paratene). Years later, Pai longs for her grandfather's approval, but he secretly blames her for the troubles plaguing the Maori -- especially since there is now no heir, as girls can't lead. Koro, we're told, wants a savior for the Maori tribe of Whangara-Mai-Tawhiti. Now Koro begins training young boys in how to be chiefs, and Pai secretly learns as well (against Koro's orders).
When the final test of the boys fails completely, the heartbroken Koro calls out to the Ancient Ones (whales), one of which, according to legend, brought the first person to New Zealand. But they don't come for the old chief. Pai calls them as well -- only to bring disaster when the whales beach themselves near her home. To save the Ancient Ones, an old teacher must learn to break traditions, and a young one learns her true place.
Though the lead of this movie is a child, there is no cuteness, no dumbness, no talking-down. The moviemakers clearly respect the cast, the people it represents, and the wealth of legend and myth behind them. It feels so real that you could reach through and touch them. But the content in it is universal -- sometimes traditions should bow to what is needed, and they need to change for the people who honor them to survive.
Neither Pai nor Koro will leave you untouched; Pai hurts Koro by breaking the rules, while he hurts her by treating her as unworthy. The scene where she makes a speech praising him and their culture is heartbreaking, as she struggles to speak through her tears. Similarly, the moment when Koro realizes that he was wrong about Pai is amazing. This careful attention to the characterization shows the care that went into ""Whale Rider.""
Direction is outstanding -- simple lines have great weight, dialogue is entirely believable, and the scenes are often carried just by the look on the actors' faces. There's a feeling of purity to the way it's directed, a freshness and beauty that shows in full near the finale. New Zealand is shown off at its best in wide scenic shots. And the climactic scene with the whales is nothing short of brilliant -- it will take your breath away.
Keisha Castle-Hughes is absolutely priceless; she has genuine talent, rather than the hamminess or woodenness that many young actors have. Rawiri Paratene is excellent as a man with a heavy burden who is getting more and more desperate; you won't like all he does, but he's an incredibly sympathetic character just the same. The supporting cast is also amazing, including Vicki Haughton as Pai's strong-willed grandmother and Cliff Curtis as her dad.
With remarkable performances, a simple, powerful message, and a brilliant storyline, ""Whale Rider"" is a film that should be seen again and again.",1056758400,21,3195,4.842778793418647
1917767,4,B0000CABBW,"WHALE RIDER comes from New Zealand, and opens with a Maori mother giving birth to twins, a son and a daughter. Unfortunately, the mother and son die in the delivery room. The father, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis), is left with only his infant daughter, Pai.
A dozen years later, Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes) lives in a Maori seashore community with her grandparents, Koro (Rawiri Paratene) and Nanny Flowers (Vicky Haughton). Koro is the tribal leader, the direct descendent of the original leader who, according to legend, came with his people from a faraway place on the backs of whales. Koro and hoped that his eldest son, Porourangi, would become chief, but the latter, after the death of his wife and son, left for Europe to become an artist. Koro is devastated by the loss of his male descendents. Though he loves Pai dearly, he consciously and deliberately excludes her from consideration as his successor. She is, after all, but a girl. So, Koro must select another heir apparent from the community after weeding out the teenage, male candidates. Pai is crushed; she loves her grandfather, and feels she must make up for the loss of her brother. Besides, she knows she's up to the job.
I liked WHALE RIDER - up to a point. It incorporates so many of those social and personal struggles that make a good touchy-feely tear jerker: generation gap (Koro vs. Porourangi), gender bias (Koro vs. Pai), and coming-of-age (Pai vs. herself). Paratene as Koro is alternately likable and hateful as the amiable grandfather/stern traditionalist who doesn't have a clue. Haughton is a most pleasant surprise as Nanny Flowers, Pai's ally and Koro's chief critic. As Nanny puts it to her husband one night during a period of domestic tension, he may be the boss outside, but in their home she's in charge (and he'd better not forget it!). Castle-Hughes is winning as the plucky Pai.
I won't award five stars because I left the screening feeling overtly manipulated. Whales have a significant part in this film, and indeed catalyze the outcome of Pai's struggle for recognition. And everybody is supposed think whales warm and cuddly, right? Also, the film's focus on a society so different from that of American audiences will perhaps arouse in the viewers a self-satisfying sense of politically correct, cultural sensitivity. I've had it up to here with the concept of political correctness. And the circumstances of Pai's triumph transcended plausible reality just a wee bit.
Finally, I was left fidgety with the nagging feeling that the Maori teenage boys being tutored by Koro would have been better off learning, say, computer skills, rather than traditional chants or how to fight with big sticks. At the end of the day, successfully recovering the chief's whale's-tooth amulet from the sea bottom is unlikely to get you off the reservation, so to speak. Indeed, the only major character who's coping with the larger world, Porourangi, comes across as diminished by the attempt. I'm doubt that's the right message for any culture.",1056585600,3,3022,4.986138613861386
1917768,5,B0000CABBW,"An unusual strength of this film is that though it's a film for adults it's also a movie to take children to.  They may not understand all of it, but they'll understand enough.  And you may discover things about those children, too, from their reaction to this film. But this film will move you, even if you don't have any children (even borrowed ones), to bring along.
Don't let me put you off, if ""child-friendly movie"" sounds to you like something with a Robin-Williams-voiceover from the lowest pits of Hollywood hell.  I feel that way about most movies ""suitable for children"". But this is something else; an emotionally honest, intense, and (I'm sorry; I'm not much good at this) life-enhancing film.
This is not a children's movie in any ordinary sense: there is absolutely no pandering, no cuteness, and no cheap manipulation.  Nobody hurts another person in a clever and amusing way and milks applause by putting up one fist triumphantly and saying, ""YESS!!""; and though the cast is not white, no-one looks at the camera and says, ""Well, shee-it!"", by way of comic relief; and no-one ... well, you get my drift.  In short, this film respects its cast, its story and its audience; it respects childhood and it respects age; and so it earns your respect.
Here is a human story, about age and loss, youth and finding a way; and the preservation of an ancient way of life by allowing traditions to change and adapt.  In structure it's a fairy tale.  Koro, an elder of the Whangara-Mai-Tawhiti people, a Maori tribal group on the beautiful and isolated East Coast of the North Island of New Zealand, is concerned that younger leaders should be appearing.  But his own two sons have rejected that path; one to become an amiable dope-smoker with nothing in the way of ambition, the other to leave his home and people to make a career as an artist in Germany.
His only mokopuna, or younger descendent, is his granddaughter Pai.  Pai shows over and again that she meets all the ancient tests of leadership, but Koro cannot see it, because she doesn't meet one of his criteria: she is a girl.
The story is predictable, in its way, as any European tale about a younger son who becomes a clever tailor and marries the princess.  It's not Pai's eventual ascension to her rightful place that fascinates and involves, but the process; her own understanding that she has more to give than she knew, and that she has a duty to give it, and the slow realisation of those around her that she is someone special.  And the pain, on both sides, caused by her grandfather Koro's failure to see what he needs to see, the truth that stares him in the face.
The pain the child and the old (not very old) man cause each other is intense, and sometimes unbearably moving to watch.  One scene where Pai makes a speech in honour of her grandfather Koro at a school cultural night, and realises that Koro refuses to come to listen to her, will certainly have you in tears, and the people around you. And yet this emotion comes naturally from the characters, who have earned your sympathy. There is no shallow Spielbergian audience-manipulation here.
But Pai also hurts Koro.  The chief of Whangara-Mai-Tawhiti should have the power to call the whales, who have an ancient relationship with the Whangara people, whose ancestor Paikea rode to New Zealand on a whale.  And Koro is driven in despair to calling on the whales, only to have his despair deepen with the realisation that he cannot make the whales answer.  But when Pai calls, and the whales come, she only brings disaster; they beach themselves, and even with the efforts of the whole people to rescue them and return them to the sea, some of them die.  The arrival of the whales is a remarkable scene, involving computer imaging every bit as remarkable, but more subtle, as that in _Lord of the Rings_.
The acting in this film is extraordinary; veteran actor Rawiri Paratane dominates the screen as Koro, a tough and uncompromising character who is very easy to hate.  But at the same time Paratene lets us know that Koro loves his granddaughter Pai, and that some of his toughness is because he believes it is in the interest of his people's future.  While 11-year old Keisha Castle-Hughes, as Pai, doesn't just dominate the screen; she lights it up.  Many superlatives have been directed at Castle-Hughes' performance, as a first-time actor.  She deserves all of them.  The rest of the cast are also superb, especially Cliff Curtis as Pai's father, who has abandoned much, though not all, of his Maori heritage, and Vicki Haughton as Pai's grandmother, Koro's wife, who heroically puts up with (mostly) Koro's stubborn blindness.  The other performances are also spot on, especially the non-actors. A highlight is the trio of older women, who make a splendidly rude joke about Pai's idealistic insistence that smoking is ""bad for their womanly properties"". The film is often very funny, sometimes quite earthy.
Director Nicki Caro makes an impressive debut.  The score by Lisa Gerrard is another highlight.  I should also give credit to New Zealand, not only for its wild beauty, but for being a part of the world where indigenous people and newer arrivals have fought but also forged a way of living together, one that may be unique. There are things about the telling of this story, in the cooperation of the film crew and the people of Whangara, that have almost as much emotional resonance as the story on the screen.  New Zealanders have taken this film to their hearts because it says something about the people they are, and they're proud of that.  They're quite right to be.
Cheers!

1917770,5,B0000CABBW,"In line with ""Bend It like Beckham"" and ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"", brilliant works about girls of color in the Anglophone diaspora are being made that are worth every ounce of praise they receive.  This film has broad-based appeal because every woman or girl who has ever been told she is not worthy due to her gender will relate to the main character here.  Further, tomboys and sensitive guys will relate to the main character's tribulations over ""not acting right"" again based on rigid societal restrictions.  Interestingly, this movie says nothing about the white or ""Pakeha"" New Zealanders.  In the US, there is no film besides ""Smoke Signals"" where Native Americans just deal with each other.  Natives are almost always only portrayed dealing with white colonial contacts.  ""Whale Rider"" recognizes that indigenous people have interesting stories to tell outside of their contact with non-Natives.  This film made New Zealand look as beautiful as everyone says it is.  After seeing this movie, ""Once Were Warriors,"" ""Utu"", and even the Maoris in ""Star Wars II,""  I totally wish I could see more films with Maoris or read more books about Maori culture.  I welcome any recommendations from amazon readers.",1056240000,3,1205,5.133333333333334
1917771,5,B0000CABBW,"This is a thoroughly satisfying but very, very unusual movie.  Set in Auckland, New Zealand, in the present among members of a Maori tribe struggling to find a new leader, the movie is primarily about acceptance and rejection, and the difficulty of meeting expectations.  The central character is an eleven-year-old girl, Pai, marvelously portrayed by newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes.  Life starts off badly for her, with her mother dying in childbirth giving birth to Pai and her twin brother, who is stillborn.  Her father more or less deserts her, partly because of the pain of losing his wife and son, but partly because of the strained relations with his father Koro, who was convinced that the infant boy would become the new leader of their tribe.
Pai wants to take a place of leadership within her tribe, but is prevented by her rigidly traditional grandfather.  Although smart and respectful of her ancestors and the traditional ways and beliefs, she is denied any potential role because of her gender.  The film focuses both on her attempt to fulfill the role she feels calling out to her, and her attempt to win the affection and acceptance of her grandfather, whom she loves despite his hostility.
This is a beautiful film, and the climax is as satisfying as one could hope.  One must allow oneself to become a bit of a believer in things mystical and magical, else the film won't work at crucial moments.
The film is populated with complete unknowns, except for Cliff Curtis, who plays Pai's father.  He has appeared in a large number of big budget Hollywood films, frequently as heavies, including THREE KINGS, COLLATERAL DAMAGE, and TRAINING DAY.  Just about everyone does an excellent job, though Keisha Castle-Hughes and Rawiri Paratene as Koro stand out.
Although many of the houses are inexpensive looking and even in some instances mildly dilapidated, nothing can disguise the extreme physical beauty of the locale.  With a large bay and sandy beach facing the ocean, and striking, magnificent mountains ascending behind the houses, the location is strikingly beautiful.
This is not always an easy film to watch.  Some of the scenes in which various individuals are expressing their feelings can be very hard to take, and Rawiri Paratene can express anger that is extremely realistic.  Nonetheless, this film as a whole is one that deals with the possibility of healing, of acceptance, and of learning to expand the boundaries of one's conception of the world.  I recommend it highly.",1056240000,8,2502,5.0

1917774,4,B0000CABBW,"Just like ballet is not ""meant"" for boys, leadership is not meant for girls. Not an altogether seminal theme. But contrary to what the blurbs going around for this latest offering from NZ had me believe, this is not your average run-down feminist movie. You'll be pleasantly surprised, there is a good reason why this has astounded audiences at top international film awards...a wholesome fare in every sense.
To begin with, Lisa Gerrard is easily the top contemporary musician around (Insider, Gladiator) and to say that her soundtrack here is gutwrenching is an understatement. Couple that with some mindblowing imagery of whales and it's easy to figure why NZ has been featuring so prominently in international minds of late (Once Were Warriors, Lord of the Rings etc) with their other-worldly yet identifiable themes.
Speaking of which, despite the parochial nature of the setting the overall undercurrent of the movie represents a wide universal appeal -- the message of endurance, filial bonds, breaking of tradition molds, reverence, learning. One of the most enthralling aspects of the education theme comes off in a contrast between the movie's two ""teachers"" -- Pai's Koro (played wonderfully by Rawiri Paratene) and Paikea (played by Keisha Castle-Hughes, in a surprisingly mature performance coming from a child actor, a la Haley Joel in the Sixth Sense).
I reluctantly pull off one star for the occasionally overdone and mildly ambiguous spiritual takes, whales not being the most emotive of mammals. But this is required viewing if you care for moving, meaningful cinema.",1055030400,61,1585,5.244094488188976

7998576,3,B0000CABBW,"This was my first time seeing this movie and I have to admit that it was not half bad. I had to watch this movie as a part of an assignment for my world religions class that I am taking. I was a bit skeptical at first since this was not a movie that I had heard of before but then again there are tons of movies out there and far too many to know much about.
There were two main characters in this movie Paka, who was the chief, and Pai who was his granddaughter. Pai had always been labeled as a trouble maker basically from birth. As a part of tradition, Paka was focused on his male heir, so he had not had the opportunity to see all of the abnormal talents and interests that Pai possessed. After many struggles, and even her grandfather looking outside of the family, the movie ends with Pai becoming leader of the village and making her father uncle, and especially grandfather, proud.
When I look into my world religions class, I can see how this movie ties into a lot of the Indigenous Religions that we have examined this semester. With the culture and way of life preferences, such as the male being the heir to everything and the men being looked at as the superior beings of the religions. This movie can definitely be used to exemplify to young women the determination, consistency, and pride that they should possess in themselves. Although it can be used as a motivating film, I can also see how this would cause controversy in those religions where women having any type of leadership role is frowned upon. I think the movie could be used as a good source and center of debate within religion as well.",1523145600,,1617,4.3754152823920265
