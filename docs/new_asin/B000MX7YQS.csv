8173436,5,B000MX7YQS,"If you are interested in the American Musical and the major people behind what is now being called the Golden Age of American Musical this DVD is a ""must watch.""  It is relatively short.  I wish they had spent more time showing excerpts from his various stage productions and more time discussing the evolution of Mr Loesser's musical forms.  But it does go through his life and provides some insight to the man, his lyrics and his music.  The sound is good, the color and images very good and the pacing very nice.  The director made some very nice choices of subject, images and interviews.  There are extras including a very nice audio track by some of the people involved in making of this excellent documentary.",1300492800,2,716,4.642857142857143
8173437,5,B000MX7YQS,"This is a fabulous overview of the life of one of America's great composers, responsible for ""Guys and Dolls"", ""Hans Christian Andersen"", ""The Most Happy Fella"", ""Where's Charley?"" and the Pulitzer-Prize-winning ""How To Succeed in Bussiness Without Really Trying"", not to mention several readily recognizable songs including ""Baby It's Cold Outside"". This video traces Loesser's fascinating life from childhood to his sadly premature death. You will learn so many things about Frank Loesser that you probably didn't know all packed into this retrospective.",1247097600,3,556,5.710843373493976
8173438,4,B000MX7YQS,"This is the story of the genius the brought us ""Guys and Dolls"". However, much more than that, this is tale of a street wise, knock-around New York guy that simply had a gift. A man of the street that wrote music for the people. I recommend this to anyone that loves musicals or great songwriters. I have watched it at least 10 times. What a documentary and what a man.",1234396800,,369,4.211267605633803
8173439,5,B000MX7YQS,"This is a very enjoyable documentary. Loesser has given Broadway his deep touch of sincere humanity. I know of an extremely beautiful production shown on television, with Giorgio Tozzi,  of his great musical THE MOST HAPPY FELLA (I love it so much!) and hope a Dvd Company may soon release it on the commercial market; many Broadway (of the real great Broadway of yesteryear)fans will run to buy it.

8173440,5,B000MX7YQS,"Frank Loesser lived three musical lives, all nicely depicted in this video. Until WOrld War II he was solely a lyricist. Then during WWII, after the success of ""Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition,"" for which he wrote words and music, he transitioned to his Broadways phase.
There for ""Where's Charley,"" ""Guys and Dolls,"" ""Most Happy Fella,"" ""Greenwillow,"" and ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,"" he was composer, lyricist, and in several cases, wrote the storyline. All of this, plus his fascinating persona, emerges clearly here.",1191974400,11,551,5.202247191011236
8173441,5,B000MX7YQS,I've been a great Frank Loeseer fan all my life and when I saw this on TV (I was not aware that a documentary on Frank Loesser existed) I knew I had to have this in my library.,1182816000,3,176,3.6578947368421053
