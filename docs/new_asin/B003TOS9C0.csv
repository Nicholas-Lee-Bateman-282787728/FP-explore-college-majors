8405337,3,B003TOS9C0,"THIS DVD SMELLS OF GREED. I STARTED WATCHING THE 1991 CONCERT AND QUICKLY REALIZED
THAT MY BOOTS OF THESE SHOWS ARE BETTER SOURCED THAT THIS RELEASE.THESE SETS HAVE
BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME AND IF YOU'RE GONNA RELEASE THESE CONCERTS, THEN CLEAN THEM UP
AND CORRECT THE AUDIO.AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST SONG, ON THE 1991 CONCERT, THE
AUDIO ON THE VOCALS DROPS OUT AND BACK IN SEVERAL TIMES.NOT GOOD...THAT SAID THE CONCERTS
THEMSELVES ARE VERY GOOD.NILS PLAYS AND SINGS HIS BUTT OFF. 5 STARS FOR THE PLAYING,1 STAR
FOR THE PRODUCTINN.",1283126400,9,535,4.763440860215054
