2726850,5,B000M8NMVE,"From 1966 comes Cool McCool, the witty, limited- animation SatAm King Features/ Hearst 'toon that parodied the '60s spy craze. Created by Bob Kane, creator of Batman, and Al Brodax, creator of the Beatles Cartoon Show and Yellow Submarine, this fast- paced, rollicking, slapstick cartoon has all the right stuff. Fast, funny and frenzied, it also features voice actor Chuck McCann, who provides play by play commentary on many of the shows as a bonus feature.

This set also marks the strong entry into the DVD- making field of Ink and Paint, who have here produced a beautiful set, with three one- sided discs in three slip cases in a box set. There's a subtle tip of the hat in the cover blurb: ""That suave secret agent from the swingin' sixties is back...for 2007"", with the OO7 enlarged through a magnifying glass. This box set includes the full run of Cool McCool with twenty episodes, each consisting of two Cool segments sandwiching one Harry McCool 'toon (My pop the cop), who with cohorts Tom and Dick make up a very limited animation Keystone Kops team.

The show was also unique for its cool jazz theme, which starts ""OO"", another way of almost saying ""007"". Cool's tag line was ""Danger is my business"". Like Bond and Maxwell Smart, he had an array of super gadgets, and can whistle for the Cool Mobile, but they usually foul up and he winds up stammering the recurring line, ""Sorry Number One, that will never happen again"". Don't expect lavish Disney animation, but if you want to see an imaginative cartoon played for laughs, made, as were all of King's 'toons, on an extremely limited budget, it doesn't get any cooler than this.",1175126400,13,1644,4.704861111111111
2726851,4,B000M8NMVE,"Batman creator Bob Kane sent up Batman and Robin in his cartoon series ""Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse"" in 1960, which is well worth buying too, by the way.

A few years later, he sent up James Bond very well with Cool McCool. Courageous Cat voice artist Bob McFadden returns to voice Cool McCool himself.

Chuck McGann (voice of Thing and Blizzard in Marvel Action Hour in 1990s) voiced most of the other characters, including 2 out of the 3 cops in the Harry McCool segment.

Enjoy the laughs, the music, and some great extras including live convention footage of Chuck and interviews.

Packaging is great, with 3 indidvidual slimline cases, and all the episodes itemized with brief story synopses on the back covers. Click on ""Buy"", and have fun.

2726852,5,B000M8NMVE,what can i say you have to to watch an see if you like them for yourself. i  guess you have to like the humor or not,1258329600,,116,3.2962962962962963
2726853,5,B000M8NMVE,"What I love about the DVDs
*  single sided DVDs

*  bright colorful fun packaging (each DVD has a different pic on it too)

*  Full episodes (including the theme song, which is what I usually remember and loved from cartoons, and which is sadly missing on most of the old cartoon DVD's we buy these days). This in itself is a huge feature and is worth 5 stars!!

*  Music and Cool McCool's singing during the show - classic stuff and so ""Cool McCool""

There are two Cool McCool episodes and one Harry McCool episode per show. Villains include the Rattler, Hurricane Harry, Greta Ghoul, the Owl, Jack-In-The-Box and Dr. Madcap.

Only one negative - some of the coloring is bad - eg Cool McCool is bright fluro green as is his car, and other characters at times and background.  Sometimes can go from a normal colored scene to a bright fluoro colored scene.

That'll never happen again Number One
What did he say Harry, What did he say?

Overall I gave it 5 stars, it's great value and really fun to watch and I am enjoying watching it for what it is.",1249603200,2,1049,4.350515463917525
2726854,4,B000M8NMVE,"Brought back lots of good memories of Saturday Morning cartoons.  Good stuff, not the crap that is on today.  Extras were good as well.  Lots of background info.",1229040000,,161,4.678571428571429
2726855,4,B000M8NMVE,the dvd set was like new i  haven't seen this since i was a kid,1223337600,,63,3.2
2726856,5,B000M8NMVE,This was so funny to see again and the theme song was such a blast from the past.  The episodes are still good to watch even when I'm not 10 years old anymore.  If you are a fan of your old Saturday Morning cartoon shows then you will love this one.  Quality and packaging is excellent so go for it.,1221436800,,299,3.95
2726857,5,B000M8NMVE,After so many years it sure is good to see Cool McCool back. This is a truly superb series,1198972800,,90,3.789473684210526
2726858,5,B000M8NMVE,"I remember watching this show before school. Only in B&W, (okay, so I'm old) and never missed an episode. Now, finally, I can re-live those early mornings in color, and in pristine clarity. I have to say, as soon as the menu came up with the theme song, my old grey cells kicked in, and I had a smile from ear to ear.

Like ""The Archies"", ""Groovie Goolies"" and ""Top Cat"", the REAL openings are there, captured in their FULL format. Unlike ""Magilla Gorila"", ""Batfink"" and ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"" where they've cut them or re-edited them and changed the theme.(very disappointing indeed)
But you'll be very happy with Cool McCool, restored in its entirety.

You get 20 FULL 25 min episodes(over 8 hours) on three single sided discs. Great value!
Packaging is excellent.
Menus are animated with music. Realy good.
Episode menu has great chapter selection through the episodes, and has some great special features.

Brilliant picture and sound, and in perfect sync.

Do yourself a favour, you won't be sorry. (Well worth the money)",1190937600,17,1024,4.8342857142857145

2726860,5,B000M8NMVE,"the show is just as I remember,even though Mc cool brings in the bad guys it seems he can't win  points with his boss.  but hey, that's the way the cookie crumbles for our bumbuling hero.  it wouldn't be the show as I know today, without the antics of the villans and Mc cool tring to do his job to bring them to justice  :))  it just wouldn't be funny",1182297600,,352,3.9714285714285715
8167127,2,B000M8NMVE,"It is really dumb. Many of the cartoons from the 60's was primitive animation and dumb. That includes Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, but I loved that show then and I love it now. Since I don't remember this cartoon series, I must not have liked it  back in 1966. From the reviews, others seem to be fond of it",1510099200,,305,4.169491525423729

8167132,4,B000M8NMVE,"COOL MCCOOL-THE COMPLETE SERIES: When BATMAN became a boob-tube phenomenon in 1966, its creator BOB KANE also launched his zany animated spy spoof COOL MCCOOL, a bumbling secret agent who spoke in JACK BENNY-esque tones and gave headaches to both the underworld and his excitable (though never fully revealed) boss, NUMBER ONE. Other than human wind machine HURRICANE HARRY and the slithery, plant controlling RATTLER, the colorful cast of cackling criminals were reminiscent of Gotham City's baddies, from PENGUIN knock off THE OWL and JOKER-like prankster JACK IN THE BOX to MAD HATTER clone DR. MADCAP. Voice pros BOB MCFADDEN and CHUCK MCCANN provided the show's punchy personalities; MCCOOL's oft repeated ""That will NEVER happen again, Number One!"" and ""Danger is my business!"" smacked appealingly of Agent 86's best known tag lines. Featuring high tech gizmos including the mustache phone and Lassie-loyal Cool Mobile, this inventive, gag heavy toon (with its snappy guitar driven theme song) was a notch above most Saturday morning fare of the era...a fun filled free for all that will NEVER happen again.

RATING: FOUR TRENCH COATS",1388966400,,1140,5.298342541436464
8167133,5,B000M8NMVE,"For those of us who were kids in the mid to late 60's, this is a wonderful set of a hilarious series that is of the style of Rocky & Bullwinkle and George of the Jungle. This has some great extras involving Chuck McCann, who introduces each episode (though I don't know why he refers to the middle cartoon as The Comedy Cops, when their title is Harry McCool). If you long for the great cartoon shows of the mid to late 60's & early 70's as I am, you must add this to your collection.",1376265600,,484,4.052083333333333

8167135,3,B000M8NMVE,"My memory certainly was more kind to this series than it deserves. The graphics are terrible, the sound production is bad, the writing and voice characterizations are poor, so I may be unable to force myself to watch all of the episodes. I think the bonus materials glorifying Chuck McCann are sappy and excessive. I think the other reviews that convinced me to purchase this series were overly generous in praise. Thank God I only spent $10.",1305763200,,442,4.753246753246753
8167136,5,B000M8NMVE,"You gotta admit that TVs in the 60's were not that great. Well this show had me stuck to it every time it was on. Now here it is as an adult! Wow this is weird humor for an adult to watch but it does bring back memories. When the kids hear that this is a cartoon daddy watched they ran to the TV to watch it. I think I left them wondering. :-)  Good memories, great quality DVD.",1295481600,,378,3.7848101265822787
