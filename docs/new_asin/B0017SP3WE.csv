8267115,4,B0017SP3WE,"A good CD to watch and learn about the functions and operation of the Olympus 420
, sometimes I have to replay a section several times because the presenter speaks and demostrate certain function before I can locate it on the camera and try to keep up with him. It is a good reference to have for your E-420 camera.",1367452800,,315,4.266666666666667
8267116,4,B0017SP3WE,I found this tutorial very helpful and worth the price paid.  My Olympus e-420 has several features that were not clear in the limited printed owner manual. The tutorial walked me through all of the camera features.  I will enjoy using my Olympus more.,1354060800,,252,4.704545454545454
8267117,5,B0017SP3WE,I can understand the camera's owner manual better now.  I converted it and loaded it to my ipad.  Now I can view it on my way to the office.,1317513600,,140,3.793103448275862
8267118,5,B0017SP3WE,"I am very pleased with my purchase of the DVD on the operation of my newly acquired Olympus E-420.  It would be helpful with any camera or for any beginner to learn the primary importance and general knowledge of taking photographs.

I would highly recommend this for anyone is who confused with all the camera lingo, as it explains the meaning and the use of those words and most of all the importance of settings and what they do...

You may stop, start or pickup anywhere on the DVD to rewatch or come back to a lesson.  This is so nice for reviewing what you just don't grasp the first time around.  On eBay this item was priced at $15.96 plus another over $5.00 shipping charge so this is what lead me to Amazon.  At almost a bargain price this item is well worth the purchase!",1294963200,,782,4.321917808219178
8267119,2,B0017SP3WE,"The guide tells you to read the manual. If you do, you won't need the guide.

Too much of the dvd is not specific to the camera, and a poor summary of photography. Then for example, there's nothing about the noise settings, not even listed in the index.

The dvd doesn't even tell you that there is a superfine option for your jpegs.

Plus after a while it gets infuriating to watch the speaker talk.",1212624000,2,400,4.306666666666667
