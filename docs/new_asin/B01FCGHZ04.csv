7749795,1,B01FCGHZ04,"The subtitles in the second movie are HORRIBLE.  They are not coherent.  The first was fine, but when spending this much money and waiting this long, both movies should be watchable.",1466899200,6,182,4.838709677419355
7749796,5,B01FCGHZ04,"VERY unique movie and was overly happy to see Amazon located a Market-Place seller that carried parts 1 & 2 on one holder, and they were USA region playable and English subtitled.  Check out the trailers on YouTube to get a feel for this - best way to decide if you'd like it......one comment, the best is part 1 as to dark and gruesome action.  Part 2 - focuses more on the GIANT Titan like you see on the cover or similar and is not as monster-action packed as the 1st disc, but you learn the origin of the Titans and some good heavy plot twists towards what I felt was a solid ending.  NO real way to say much here w/out bad spoilers - but the trailers on YouTube are REAL good for letting you know what the movie is like.",1465084800,12,725,4.091549295774648
8760636,3,B01FCGHZ04,"As a colossal (pun intended) fan of attack on titan, I was really looking forward to this live action adaptation.  The thing is I enjoyed part one ALOT more than part two, and this comes down to one factor alone : the subtitles.  In part one the subtitles at least make sense and allow me to keep up with what's going on.  The subtitles in part TWO however, make me think the translator either doesn't know Japanese, or is trolling the audience hardcore.  It was funny at first but quickly that feeling fades into frustration. I have since bought the official blu rays from best buy, and having watched part two again I can honestly say that the subtitles are night and day when compared.  Bottom line: part one gets 3 stars, part two gets none.",1489881600,,745,4.448529411764706
8760637,3,B01FCGHZ04,"These movies are decent.  Not the best live action anime adaptation but not the worst.  I did like how they used real actors to portray the titans.  If you do want to get these movies, then I recommend you buy the official funimation video releases.  The video release you see here has terrible English subtitles on the second movie.  Very poorly translated.",1484784000,,358,4.709677419354839

8760639,5,B01FCGHZ04,"I loved both parts of this movie.  Although some of the characters were a little different, all in all it didn't affect it too much.  I just wish the female Titan was there instead of his fellow male fighter.  Those who follow the anime stories know what I'm talking about.",1478476800,,273,4.42
8760640,5,B01FCGHZ04,"I loved the anime even though this live action veers away from it a little bit. Quality is pretty good and the acting is not bad either. For true fans, you may have mixed feelings because of the story line which I can understand but nevertheless, it's still a good movie.",1478390400,,271,4.333333333333333
8760641,4,B01FCGHZ04,"My boyfriend and I watching these movies at the theater and greatly enjoyed them. While they aren't quite like the Anime, it at times we found to be very comical and like this version of things.
When I saw they offered both dvds in a pack, I decided to order it and surprise my boyfriend with it .
The dvds came very well wrapped and neatly packaged. We didn't find a problem with that.
However I will note the first DVD sits on top of the second DVD so it isn't protected and if you want to see the second, you have to remove the first. We didn't find this a problem, but for those who might, I figured I'd leave a note.

Now both dvds did play, but the issue we encountered was the subtitles on the second DVD were not an accurate translation. I've taken classes in Japanese and while I'm not fluent enough to watch the entire movie as is, I can tell you these aren't accurate. Some times the sentences were not formed correctly, but the words were right, and that is fine. (e.g. Brown is dog)
But there were long words of complete gibberish throughout the movie and many of the sentances were gibberish. It was as if someone took the Japanese subtitles and just ran them through Google Translate.

So for those who don't understand Japanese,  and have never seen this movie, I do not recommend this DVD set.",1477612800,,1310,4.338775510204082
8760642,3,B01FCGHZ04,"The movie is well performed, has good action, and the special effects aren't bad considering some of the combat flying really only ""works"" in an anime context.  Kiko Mizuhara as Mikasa is all at once sweet, charming, brutal, and strong. I love you Kiko!

HOWEVER...

This is a two disk set and the english dubbing on the second disk is TERRIBLE. It's barely coherent. If you only speak English, you are apt to find the story nearly impossible to follow. Fortunately ""part 2"" is mostly action and resolution...but much of the character and plot motivations must be inferred from what you see and hear in vocal tones -- not what you read in the (almost laughable) subtitles.",1477353600,,672,4.726495726495727

8760645,4,B01FCGHZ04,I thought it was pretty good to the story but my daughter was not happy with the casting...if you like AOT then you will like this movie,1471478400,,136,4.074074074074074
