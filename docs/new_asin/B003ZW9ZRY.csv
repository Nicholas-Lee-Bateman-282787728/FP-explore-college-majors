4236392,3,B003ZW9ZRY,"Well, if you enjoy B-movies, crappy dialogue, bad acting and groovy music...this will be your movie; however, there is a little problem: pacing and blood. Pacing, because the movie is very slow, and it gets boring after the first 60 minutes; blood, because there isn't as much as say, Lewis' films. So if you can stand tedious narrative and just two decent murder scenes, you'll like it...in my case it wasn't enough. Rent it before buying it...life can't be complete without watching a movie in which the hero is a guy with a turkey head on acid!!!",1140652800,,549,4.670103092783505
4236393,2,B003ZW9ZRY,"Blood Freak (Steve Hawkes and Brad Grinter, 1972)

Hawkes, star of a couple of obscure Italian Hercules films and the preposterously bad The Walls Have Eyes, a 1964 short which exists only to show Miami stripper Jody Baby naked, decided he hadn't quite made it into the stratosphere of cheesiness yet, so he, along with Grinter (whose best, and I use the term very loosely, film was Flesh Feast, Veronica Lake's final picture), came up with this turkey. And I use the term ""turkey"" literally. Blood Freak is a cautionary-drug-tale picture that makes Reefer Madness look like Oscar material. Without doubt, it propels Hawkes, and everyone else involved with it, into the Limburger Hall of Fame.

Herschell (Hawkes), a motorcyclist, meets and befriends Angel (Grinter favorite Heather Hughes) when her car breaks down. The unsubtly-named Angel, a Jesus freak in hot pants, lives with her sister Ann (Dana Cullivan, in her only screen role), who's more of the party-girl type. Herschell, as it turns out, is looking for a job in town, and nets a handyman position at the local turkey farm through Angel's church group. Meanwhile, Ann, who's fallen hard for Herschell, is trying to figure out a way to get him into bed. She uses what comes to hand-- drugs. These, combined with experimental turkey meat, turn Herschell into a bloodsucking freak, if you'll pardon the pun, with the head of a turkey. I kid you not.

I can't call it the worst movie I've ever seen-- while it was obviously a basement-budget production, it was enthusiastic, the acting isn't quite as wooden as one usually sees in these efforts, and Dana Cullivan is far too easy on the eyes. While it's silly and predictable, so is Night of the Lepus, released the same year, and it's one of the best B-movies ever made. If you go into this expecting utter silliness, you'll get a lot out of it. * ",1134691200,,1858,4.760869565217392
4236394,4,B003ZW9ZRY,"Seeing this masterpiece has made me a better person.
Plot: Herschell, A Vietnam vet,gets involved with a woman, and gets a job with her father at a turkey farm.  At the farm they administer drugs to turkeys where it's Herschell ""job"" to eat said turkeys.  Unfortunately, this turns him into a turkey man-monster ( but it gets better, he's not a full monster, as he's still clad in jeans and nifty plaid button-up shirt!) His grotesque looking paper-mache turkey head with giant ping-pong ball eyes will leave you amazed- lol!  And I thought Plan 9 From Outer Space was bad!  This is so bad it's a cinematic work of excellence!  You'll delight in the screams of victims without anyone's lips moving, and they loop the same ""scream"" sound effect for different people :) I'm leaving out quite a few details to this gem.
Something Weird Video comes through again with tons of extra material to fluff up this turkey.",1127260800,2,911,4.70440251572327
4236395,1,B003ZW9ZRY,"I guess I'm the lone reviewer here to date that found this film just bad/boring, not bad/fun.  The production qualities (bad lighting, sound, ""special effects,"" etc) are, for the most part, just annoyances.  In ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" it's fun to watch a scene turn from day to night and back -- or to see the strings the hubcap spaceships are dangling on.  In ""Blood Freak,"" the cheap plastic prosthetic leg that gets chopped off looks bad enough to elicit some laughs, but other mistakes (such as a long scene shot with such insufficient light that you can't see what's happening) are just poor workmanship, not fun.  Am I supposed to keep laughing for several minutes because the director didn't know how to light a scene so he could capture it on film?  I think not.

Sorry, but this movie is just not in the same camp league as Russ Meyers, John Waters, or Ed Wood.  If you're a fan of camp movies, I suggest renting this before buying it so you can decide for yourself whether this is is bad/good or just plain bad.

The dvd is packed with lots of extras.  I watched probably 3/4 of them and cannot say that I found any of them particularly fun, either.  There is a soft core porn movie masquerading as a moralistic tale about the dangers of being a [...].  There is a very lame nudist colony movie which is neither funny nor titillating.  Obviously compiled by someone who likes terrible ""B"" movies, most of these extras miss the mark by a wide margin as well.  All in all, this dvd was enough to put me to sleep on my couch early.",1104192000,,1541,4.402826855123675
4236396,5,B003ZW9ZRY,"This movie is absolutely sublime. If you appreciate truly terrible cinema, you MUST order this turkey now! Right now! This movie has it all! Terrible plot, awful dialogue, wooden acting (I am convinced some of the actors are actually made of wood), and THE most ridiculous monster in movie history, period. The plot revolves around Herschell, an ex Vietnam vet biker who gets involved with some pretty unsavory situations in the diabolical and powerful poultry industry, but thanks to the Grintner treatment, we never quite understand what is going on, and confusion reigns.
As bad as this sounds there is so much more that combines on so many levels to make this one of the very worst of the worst. This is worse than anything by Ed Wood or Al Adamson. My favorite diversions in the movie are twofold. First, director Brad Grintner (you see a lot more of him in the DVD extras) narrates this whole mess with a pro-religion, anti-drug, anti-giant mutant murdering turkey monologue, which I could make neither heads nor tails of. In the manner of William 'One Shot' Beaudine and Ray Dennis Steckler, he clearly did the narrative all in the first take, so you get a bonus of Grintner lighting cigarettes, smoking, and having horrible hacking coughing fits on camera. The second delicious diversion in the film is the scene right after Herschell becomes the turkey monster when he reunites with his girlfriend. I won't spoil it for you, but it's certainly a scene that you will never forget. I won't say more on the subject other than that I guarantee that you will love this film.
Also of note are all the extras, including a documentary on poultry farming, and other short subjects, two of which must be singled out for special mentions: ""Brad Grintner: Nudist"" is a short featuring Grintner and pals frolicking in the buff (note: this will NOT arouse you in any way); and, ""Narcotics, Pit of Despair!"" starring Kevin Tighe, future star (as Roy DeSoto) of TV's hit show ""Emergency!"" from the late seventies. Here he plays John Scott, a good looking high school student hooked on all sorts of bad stuff. Of course drug addiction is a terrible thing, and not to be mocked, but you are allowed a few smirks in this heavy-handed anti-drug film.
Just say no to drugs, but say yes to this movie. It is an inspired work of utter brilliance; in its own fowl way.",1075507200,26,2353,4.713592233009709

A friend of mine had thought to bring PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE because he thought it was bad, but quickly yielded.  This was worse.  Obviously.  And therein lies its beauty.

4236407,2,B003ZW9ZRY,"Blood Freak (1972) is a strange film that takes some odd characters, puts them in some weird situations, exposes them to illicit drugs, adds some crazed bloodletting by a guy in a turkey head mask, then wraps things up with a twist ending that apparently is supposed to serve as a warning about the dangers of drug use.

Is it worth your time?  Well, if you are interested in conventional cinema with a coherent plot, reasonable sounding dialog, halfway decent special effects, and in focus camera work . . . probably not.

The `so bad that it is good' factor, the gore (which is substantial for the time), and the ridiculous looking turkey-headed killer, contribute to the film's cult appeal.  Steve Hawkes, stars in the film that he co-wrote and co-directed with Brad Grinter, who appears as a cigarette smoking narrator.

If you find your curiosity peaked by a man who eats chemically altered turkey and is transformed into a crazed turkey-headed killer, slaying young women to drink their blood, you might try renting Blood Freak, or look for it on TMC Underground, before you consider shelling out the big bucks for the currently discontinued DVD release.  The DVD does have a number of extras that may add to your appreciation of this oddity.",1243296000,5,1248,4.808411214953271
4236408,5,B003ZW9ZRY,"If you like really bad, I mean really, really, really bad B-movies then this is the one for you. This tops them all! This is the absolutey best worst movie ever. It is wonderfully horrible. But why does it cost so much?",1242864000,,219,4.238095238095238
4236409,3,B003ZW9ZRY,"I've watched and reviewed a lot of really bad cinema, and have often said ""this has to be the worst film I have ever seen""...well ""Blood Freak"" has now taken over the honour as the bottom of the barrel to date. If you like this kind of thing you'll get some laughs out of the blatant trashiness of it all, but the sheer endurance needed to sit through the whole thing might be beyond most people.

The plot was goofy enough to draw me in, so see if this sounds like fun to you... A hunky but withdrawn drifter called Hershell runs into a pretty girl on the road, who introduces him to her family. Most of the relatives are crazy drug-fuelled drop-outs, but one of them at least offers our hero a job on a turkey farm. The rest of the family seems intent on corrupting Hershell with strong drugs but unfortunately he is also being fed experimental substances by the guys responsible for feeding the turkeys (don't ask) , so it isn't long before something horrible happens and Hershell takes a very severe turn for the worse by having a kind of fit and transforming into ..the Blood Freak! Bearing in mind that Hershell works at a turkey farm, I'm sure you can guess the nature of the transformation.

So far so good, because as plots go, that has to be whacky enough to make a pretty crazy movie. But in this case, nearly everything else work as hard as possible to ruin the entire venture. For a start, the camera work, editing, direction, sound and lighting all really honk to high heaven. Many significant shots are totally out of focus. And I mean serious, long close ups that you can't believe were actually left in the film, they are so bad. We're talking worse than Doris Wishman bad, and that's saying something. The editing is the second biggest offender. Scenes are often cut together so haphazardly you'll think big chunks of celluloid must have dropped on the floor while the glue was drying. Scenes just leap all over the place. The sound is also very poor. Music and dialogue are a disaster, with hopelessly mis-matched sound levels. All in all, it's the kind of film that you might resent actually paying money for, as things are that bad.

That aside (although it's a big aside!), there are a few bright spots. To my surprise, the acting of some of the lead players wasn't that bad. Some of the banter between Hershell and his female love interest was actually rather sweet (watch the scene when she persuades him to take a few puffs with her...it actually looks very natural). On the other hand, all of the supporting cast are truly dire. There is a kind of on-screen narrator who smokes all the way through his delivery, reads his script from cards on the table in front of him, and ends his final soliloquay with a fit of coughing! He's not the only one to need prompting...several of the other supporting artists are clearly doing the same.

Sorry, I was supposed to be dwelling on the good points! Well things do pick up when Hershell turns into the Blood Freak and starts causing mayhem. Blood (which looks like water with food colouring in it - and with the same consistency!) is soon flowing freely from the victims. There is one rather shocking scene involving a circular saw which made me sit up rather unexpectedly, but apart from that its all very routine, with extras who don't know how to play dead and dubbed screams that play while the victims mouth is opening and closing at completely the wrong times.

If I had paid money to see this at the cinema I would have walked out after 20 minutes. If you pay to actually own it you only have yourself to blame. But then again, the sheer terribleness of it does give it some charm. It even has a kind of anti-drugs message - and the worst, most ineffectual ""happy ending"" I have ever witnessed!!

Sadly, while very strange, the film isn't really ""out there"" enough to rise above the shoddy production. It only has one big trump card (the monster) and once you've seen it and laughed, you get over it very quickly (I mean how long did they spend making that costume?). What's really disappointing is that for this stretch of the films running time, when you'd think they would be putting their biggest effort into the monster's rampage, the watchability drops to probably the lowest of all. I mean, the scenes showing characters sitting on the sofa at a party, or just Hershell feeding the turkeys are filmed more professionally than the film's actual marketable highlights. I guess you have to see ""Blood Freak"" just to believe that somebody actually made it.",1215993600,,4534,4.557055214723927
4236410,5,B003ZW9ZRY,"If you ever wanted to see an anti-drug, pro-jesus, giant turkey monster that sucks the blood of drug addict's...have I got a movie for you.

Now as a 6 ft. tall giant turkey he wanders around town looking for tainted blood to satisfy his turkey need's, hanging his victims upside down and sucking their blood with his giant turkey beak! (All while gobbling profusely!)
