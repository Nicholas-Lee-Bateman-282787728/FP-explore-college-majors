3919636,5,B002EWD0DG,"I bought this set mainly because it was the only way to get a DVD of the 1947 ""Fiesta"" with the torrid flamenco of Ricardo Montalbam and the deeeeeelicious Cyd Charisse.

But, all in all, it brings back great memories of the Fab 50s and all those swimmy Esther Williams flicks, and of course, Esther Williams was a gorgeous, athletic, and easy to look at lady and a fine actress in the fun roles she played.  Colorful, smashing routines and spectacular water dancing. Great fun to relive.  AND...my sister went ape at seeing the bare-chested baritone, Howard Keel.  Somethin' fer ev'ryone!",1257292800,4,589,4.801980198019802

The movies included have already been more than adequately reviewed so I will not attempt that. I did noticed that one of the movies (and now I can't remember which one) had a couple of spots where the picture seemed a little blurry. It didn't last long and was not a great distraction. Here's hoping there will be a volume 3 and that it will include SKIRTS AHOY.",1256860800,,528,4.237623762376238

3919642,5,B002EWD0DG,"Thanks so much to TCM and Warner Home Video for producing the long overdue and much anticipated second volume of Esther Williams films.

I am thrilled that ""THRILL OF A ROMANCE"" (no pun intended) is included - my all-time favourite Esther film.

This lady has brought continuous joy and pleasure to millions of people with her warm, engaging personality and excellent swimming and athletic talents and the films all boast lovely music scores and songs, and many other talented players.

The films were originally produced when Metro Goldwyn Mayer was at its zenith, providing the world with delicious family and general entertainment.

Much appreciation also to the previous Reviewer who has provided us with all the feast of information about the very generous extras on the individual DVD pressings.

WELL DONE!",1246406400,31,813,5.175572519083969
3919643,5,B002EWD0DG,"It is good to see that Esther William's films that did not make Volume 1 of her DVD collection are being given a general release with lots of extras rather than being put on DVD-R into the Warner Archive. The Archive is a good idea for obscure films in which visuals are not that important - Marie Dressler's films of the early 1930's are good examples of such films - but Esther's Technicolor musicals needed to be restored to their original visual splendor to be appreciated. The following is the press release for this film indicating extras, costars, and brief plot outlines.

Million Dollar Mermaid (1952)
Esther Williams portrays real-life Australian swimming champ Annette Kellerman. Directed by Mervyn LeRoy and costarring Victor Mature, this film was nominated for Best Color Cinematography. The movie includes a Busby Berkeley choreographed water ballet extravaganza. This is considered to be Esther's signature film.

Van Johnson and Esther Williams star. The film include performances from Tommy Dorsey and his Orchestra and operatic grandeur from famed Wagnerian tenor Lauritz Melchior in his film debut.

Newlywed swimming teacher Cynthia Delbar (Williams) has everything a girl could want for her honeymoon in the mountains. The only thing missing is her tycoon groom, who is in DC closing a deal. A pretty sorrowful situation - until a good-looking war hero staying at the hotel decides he needs swimming lessons.

Easy to Love (1953)
With the Cole Porter classic as the title tune, Esther Williams and Van Johnson star in their fifth film together. Julie Hallerton (Esther Williams) knows how to win the affection of indifferent Ray Lloyd (Van Johnson): Be his office secretary; be the star of his Florida aquacade and the heart's desire of a Manhattan crooner to make Ray jealous. Tony Martin lends his smooth vocal styling; Busby Berkeley guides Esther's aquatic routines, including a legendary sequence involving Florida's Cypress Gardens, dozens of water skiers, ramps, pyramid formations, gushing geysers, a helicopter, a trapeze and Esther in the air. Also note that this is Carroll Baker's screen debut.

End of press release.

These six musicals are usually very light in plot, involve exotic settings, and have plenty of opportunities for musical interludes besides Esther's water ballets, which are beautiful. The time of Esther William's peak popularity was a time of upheaval for MGM, which is where these films were made. After the war, MGM began a downward spiral brought on largely by the competition of TV but also by MGM's inabilities to conform to the public's changing tastes. One place where MGM continued to do well was in their musicals, at least until the late 1950's, and Esther's films were among their peak product in this department.",1246147200,53,5323,5.372148859543818

3919672,5,B002EWD0DG,"This is a very lovely collection of Esther Williams movies, a swimmer who was the darling of the sea in the old timey movies.  This set features six films, all of which are very good in their respective ways.  There is a biographical one, Million Dollar Mermaid, which is serious.  And then a very light-hearted one in ""Pagan Love Song.""  All of these movies are very clean and suitable for family viewing.  Some of her movies are just a tad bit long, but not unbearably so.  And just overall, this set contains six very nice movies that everyone is sure to enjoy.  A nice feature for the elderly is that they all come with subtitles.  So everyone of all ages can enjoy these beautiful films replete with swimming, singing, and beautiful scenery.  I was not familiar with Esther Williams prior to purchasing these movies, but I've found that I really enjoy them.

3919688,5,B002EWD0DG,"In Volume 2 of TCM's spotlight collection, Esther branches out from swimming to explore other forays.  Still, many of the films contain those wonderful synchronized swim sequences.  This volume also contains my favorite Esther Williams film:  ""Thrill of a Romance"" with Van Johnson.  Esther is engaged to and weds a wealthy elitist businessman but the marriage is never consummated.  Meanwhile, she meets a down-to-earth serviceman who steals her heart...

3919691,2,B002EWD0DG,I wanted to view the film primarily for the scenes on the Mackinac Grand Hotel.  It was not available for rent so I bought this.  The film is somewhat dated but fun to watch as a period piece.,1381536000,,192,4.026315789473684
3919692,5,B002EWD0DG,"""Thrill Of A Romance"" and ""This Time For Keeps"" are the absolute best films in this box set because they also feature Metropolitan Opera star Lauritz Melchior (""Romance"" was his film debut -- and also stars Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra).  Melchior is adorable and manages to make opera music accessible to the masses.  I recently met a new rising star in opera who counts Melchior as one of his heroes, so that's another reason to love these two films. Plus ""Thrill"" has Van Johnson.

There is only one film here which is a real head-scratcher, but it's still fun in its ridiculous way:  ""Fiesta.""  In that film Esther and Ricardo Mantelban are twins -- but he speaks with a Spanish accent while she does not.  Must be something in the water. The other films are all a lot of fun -- gotta love Esther -- the girl who inspired the entire world to swim!",1381449600,,853,4.470967741935484

The focus is more on Howard Keel, and he is in fine voice. Unfortunately, the songs he has to work with are completely forgettable. Nice Hawaii photography (even though the film is supposedly set in Tahiti). Pretty predictable story (granted, most stories behind most musicals are pretty predictable). In light of the better Esther Williams showcases (Neptune's Daughter, Million Dollar Mermaid) and the great MGM musicals, this entry, unfortunately, seems like a poor country cousin.",1343001600,2,619,5.138613861386139

Esther Williams showcases her impeccable diving and swimming skills as well as the skills of  many musicians and singers.",1276992000,2,400,5.435483870967742

Esther was the first swimmer to syncronise swim, and started a new sport which is now an Olympic event.

3919733,5,B002EWD0DG,"I've always been a fan of classic Hollywood, and the MGM era with Esther Williams is my favorite. One doesn't view Esther Williams films for great plot and story, but for sheer entertainment, they can't be beat. You're hooked from the opening credits with their stylized technicolor brilliance. And the colorful water ballets are spectacular. What can be more beautiful than Esther Williams in a hot pink swimsuit in that crystal clear blue water and flashing her wonderful smile.  If you're a fan, it's a must have. I hope there's more to come.",1271203200,,545,4.860215053763441
3919734,5,B002EWD0DG,"I grew up watching Esther Williams' movies and this collection is a good sample of her work.  They are not all great, but they are all watchable.  ""Thrill of a Romance"" is light and enjoyable with some good music and some laughs. ""Fiesta"" is OK but not her finest hour with a fairly weak story and only about 30 seconds of Esther swimming. ""This Time for Keeps"" has Jimmy Durante along for the ride and is fun to watch.  ""Pagan Love Song"" is a little offbeat but pleasant enough.  ""Million Dollar Mermaid"" was, to me, the best of the collection.  ""Easy to Love"" has good music and a fantastic water ski show as a highlight.  All in all I enjoyed the whole collection and you will too.",1270684800,,684,4.346456692913386
3919745,5,B002EWD0DG,"At a time when there are really no classic films being released on DVD, it is refreshing to find this TCM set of Esther Williams films.  This one is nicely packaged, full of extras, and generally includes good prints.  These films are not some of the finest movies ever made, but they are entertaining and lavishly produced.  If you are a fan of Esther Williams, you will be totally satisfied.  If you are curious about pop culture in the 40s and 50s, and wonder what drove people to theaters by the thousands, this is also for you.  Esther Williams is one beautiful lady, and no one looks like she does in the water, or walking into a night club!  Check out her entrances in ""Thrill of a Romance.""  Wow!  Only disappointment was the picture quality of ""Fiesta.""  Other than that, perfect!  Thanks, TCM!",1269216000,2,803,4.5524475524475525

Only wish the Duchess of Idaho was on this one as it wasn't on the first set either-wonderful movie they forgot!!!Enjoy I truely do!!!You won't be discouraged",1265328000,2,414,3.8255813953488373
3919748,5,B002EWD0DG,"This second ""pool"" of great Esther Williams films are just plain old fun! I'll admit, these aren't great classics, but if you liked the original set, there's no reason to get this one. Thrill of a Romance is beautifully filmed in Technicolor and has Van Johnson. Fiesta is a rare Williams movie in which involves no swimming, but still enjoyable. This Time For Keeps might be the weakest of the bunch, but what the heck! Pagan Love Song is wonderful and hilarious, Just like Easy to Love. Million Dollar Mermaid might be one of Esther's best movies and is actually a biography of Annette Kellerman. Each comes with ""laugh your head off"" cartoons and shorts. 5 out of 5!",1263772800,,669,4.630252100840337
3919749,4,B002EWD0DG,"It's been a long time coming, but finally volume 2 has arrived and hope it's a great seller so Warner's will release a third and final volume which would include the underated SKIRTS AHOY.  Also included should be TEXAS CARNIVAL; JUPITER'S DARLING and the very good DUCHESS OF IDAHO.  Howewver, because Warner's has taken a new stand of releasing their classics in a burned edition and at a ridiculous price of $20.00 each plus shippping a tax, I doubt that they will release this third collection.  For shame.
But back to tis volume.  Very impressive titles here except for PAGAN LOVE SONG.  Good that it has a short run time.  FIESTA isn't really a SWIM movie, but good just the same.  The others are typical fun comedies with some wonderful water ballets.",1258761600,12,758,4.696969696969697

But I have also enjoyed other movies in the set which I didn't remember.  The only thing missing is Robert Osbourne's introductory comments on TCM!  It's interesting that I have shared some of these movies with people in their 40s and 50s, and they too have enjoyed them even if they didn't remember the originals.",1258156800,,482,4.647058823529412
3919751,3,B002EWD0DG,"This is a package of difficult to find and/or previously unavailable movies.

The Thrill of a Romance is a unsavory and unsatisfactory tale wherein Williams character is naive enough to believe the villain of the piece enough to marry him within a month, but when left alone on her honeymoon she quickly switches affections to the war hero played by Van Johnson.  Judeo-Christian guilt abounds, and the mediocre acting bring the movie to an ending that will have modern viewers snickering.

Fiesta has been previously unavailable.  For some unfathomable reason the movie makers thought that casting Esther Williams as the sister of Ricardo Montalban might be believable.  Montalban is convincinag and appealing as the son of a famous mexican bullfighter who is more interested in music.  Montalban shines, while Williams is used as a vehicle to advance the plot.  In spite of this she manages to make her character appealing.

This Time For Keeps pairs Williams with Johnny Johnson.  Johnson is passable as an war hero and potential opera lead who dreams of being a crooner.  Throw in Mauritz Melchor (opera sensation) , Xavier Cugat (latin band leader)and Jimmy Durante (vaudville comedian) for an everything but the kitchen sink movie.  Watchable, but unispiring.

Pagan Love Song has Williams playing a tahitian beauty willing to do anything to escape the island until Howard Keel arrives.  Johnson plays a full-voiced but boyishly charming off-islander who is bent enjoying life as a beach bum.  Fun but not always P.C.

The last two movies in this collection are the biopic Million Dollar Mermaid and Easy to Love.  In Million Dollar Mermaid Williams plays australian champion swimmer Annette Kellerman.  The swimming is stunning and the movie appealing.  Easy To Love pair Williams once again with Van Johnson who in this movie plays a bit of a lout.  Set at Bush Garden, this is a dare-devil water-skiing extravaganza.",1258156800,7,1925,5.112179487179487

3919753,5,B002EWD0DG,"Esther, Esther, Esther...what a unique joy you brought to the movies.  There was never a more spectacular genre than that fashioned around this talented swimstar.  She cheerfully lived in a world inhabited by man-hungry younger sisters, opera stars and leading men who'd burst into song at the drop of a cliche, and prestigious family members and friends like Jimmy Durante, Walter Pigeon, Mary Astor, Rita Moreno and Cyd Charisse.  By day, she was in the water but always managed to dry off before moving to night clubs where, inevitably, some big-name band conducted by Xavier Cougat or Tommy Dorsey was playing the latest hits.  Collection Number Two doesn't let us down.  Here, we have her chemistry with Van Johnson demonstrated yet again in ""Thrill of a Romance"" and ""Easy to Love""  I lunched with Van on his last visit to Australia, and still boyish at 80, he made it quite clear that the best years of his career were spent at MGM, and some of the most enjoyable movies were with Esther Williams.  There are two diversions from the formula.  In ""Fiesta"", Esther gets wet for just a moment, but still has the lush technicolor treatment in a crazy mix of sibling devotion and bull-fighting in Mexico, and - like ""Million Dollar Mermaid"" -  is not strictly a musical.  But by ""Million Dollar Mermaid"" Esther had learned her chops as an actress and as the world's first mermaid, Aussie Annette Kellerman, gives a creditable dramatic performance inbetween the Busby Berkeley aquatic spectaculars.  I have to admit ""Pagan Love Song"" is my favourite.....Esther in Tahiti (shot in Hawaii), sun-drenched, splashing around in the ocean, serenaded by Howard Keel at his handsome best...it's like taking an utterly carefree vacation with people you love.  So.  Is there to be a Volume Three?  One hopes so.  We still await ""Texas Carnival"", ""Skirts Ahoy"". ""Duchess of Idaho"" and ""Jupiter's Darling""...surely enough reason to complete the trio.",1257897600,7,1939,4.996884735202492
3919754,5,B002EWD0DG,"This second set from TCM/Warner Brothers once again displays the timeless, technicolor magic produced by MGM and their swimming superstar Esther Williams.  All the films have been wonderfully restored and the vintage extras on all of the discs are a nostalgic delight. When we were kids in pre-TV Australia, our one weekly visit to the movies was to the matinee on Saturday afternoon at the local theater. I saw every feature Ms Williams ever starred in during that period. She was by far my favorite performer and I wondered when I bought the first volume if the magic would still be there. I need not have worried. Esther Williams was simply the best there was and I can't wait for the rest of her movies to be re-issued.",1257638400,2,723,4.6484375
