2019065,4,B0001NBM3A,"I don't own this set, and I haven't seen Sub-Zero, but I'm not writing to talk about the movies themselves. I see a lot of people complaining about how misleading the title is, but what is so misleading about it? It lists the movies it has in it very clearly (Phantasm, Sub-Zero, and Return of the Joker), and anyone who already owns or has heard of them should know what to expect.

The reason Mystery of the Batwoman isn't included, I'd imagine, is because this set was probably assembled before MotB came out. And for those of you complaining that ""Return of the Joker"" wasn't really a Batman movie just because it starred the ""Beyond"" Batman, bite me. Batman Beyond was an excellent show. Now, if it had been an hour long movie starring ""The Batman""  (the more recent Year 3 version of Batman), then there'd be a reason to complain, but there's nothing wrong with Terry Mcginnis.

And BITE me, John Q. Public! Kevin Conroy is THE greatest Batman ever! If you didn't like it, fine, that's your opinion. Keep to yourself!

Besides, if being an internet geek is such a bad thing, then what are you doing here?",1116547200,6,1110,4.535
2019066,3,B0001NBM3A,"I want you all to know that my 3-Star rating is not based on the movies themselves. I personally find all three movies to be great. Here's the reason for my mediocre score. The movies included in this set are:

Batman: Mask of The Phantasm

Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub-Zero

Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker

  Did you catch that last one? The third movie in the Batman Movie collection is not the third true Batman movie, Mystery of the Batwoman. Amazon makes no mention of this in any product description, and the photo for the set shows the one side of the box that does not list what movies are inclided. I admit, I could have done more research to find that out before purchasing this set, although I figured 3 actual Batman movies coming in the Batman movie collection would be common sense. Apparantly not.

  So, long story short, 3 great, highly reccomended movies... just be aware of what movies you are buying.",1091145600,59,920,4.527272727272727
2019157,4,B0001NBM3A,"I gave this to my son a few months ago and he is still pulling it out to watch the dvd's.  I like the stories, but, frankly, I feel like they can be a little too mature for a six year old.  Apparently, the Return of the Joker is the abridged version (less violent).  I can't imagine what the original version would be like because it seems like it would be perverse considering what the 'kiddie' version is like.  So, my review would be this: your child will definitely like this more than a concerned adult.  Entertainment value is high, but so is the violence meter.",1197936000,,568,4.320754716981132
2019158,4,B0001NBM3A,"Kind of confused why Batman Beyond is in this set, and not the mystery of the batwoman. Also the Batman Beyond movie is the edited version of the movie, not the uncut one.

Great movies, for fans of the show. Pick it up.",1197331200,,220,4.116279069767442
2019159,4,B0001NBM3A,"While all three DVD's are good, The Mask of the Phantasm is a very good movie.  The best of the Animated Batman films.  Hopefully, DC will make another animated Batman film on the level of the Superman: Doomsday DVD from Fall of 2007.",1195948800,,234,4.4186046511627906
2019160,5,B0001NBM3A,"I loved these as a Kid, and now as an adult I still enjoy these.  Good stuff.",1179187200,,77,3.5294117647058822
2019161,5,B0001NBM3A,"Mask of the Phantasim is an oustanding Batman movie. Good plot, great animation, and action. Just like the animated series, but this is an original movie. The fight scene in the end when the Joker tries to escape on a jet pack is pretty cool.

Return of the Joker is an original movie from the Batman Beyond animated series. I prefer the original Batman, but this is a pretty darn good animated movie. It shows the last battle between the original Batman and the Joker, and the Joker returns from the dead to cause problems for the new Batman, and his mentor Bruce Wayne.

Sub-Zero is pretty decent. great explosion scenes in the end when Batman and Robin rescue Barbara Gordon (Batgirl) from Mr. Freeze.

This is a MUST for Batman fans!!!",1173312000,4,739,4.583333333333333
2019162,4,B0001NBM3A,"alright, this is getting a bit confusing...
so we finished watching the 3 films from the batman original movies box set, excellent stuff, especially Return of the Joker

now i was annoyed at the DVD being full screen
so we went online and did a little research... then outpopped all these questions we can't seem to find true answers to:

1. the RotJ that comes with this boxset... is it CUT or UNCUT?
cuz according to amazon, the separately sold UNCUT disc is 77 min, while the separately sold CUT disc is 70 min.  and when i checked the info on MY disc?  it says 76 min
so then i checked amazon for the box set info, and it says it contains the PG-13 director's version (so i'm assuming it's the UNCUT version?)
THEN i read reviews and have seen several folks saying the RotJ included in this boxset IS the CUT version?
THEN i read several other more reviews & i see someone saying the UNCUT is 4 min longer than the CUT (PG13 vs PG) instead of the 7 min i saw earlier (77 min vs 70 min). but my disc from the boxset says 76 min?  so wHAT IS what?

needless to say,  all these conflicting infos just left us confused as hell...

***so WHAT EXACTLY is shown on the UNCUT disc that is gone on the CUT disc?
how long r the actual movies from both versions?
if someone can please inform us THE CORRECT INFO then we can finally know for sure if we're missing out on the UNCUT or not...

2.  was this film shot in widescreen at all?
what we saw on ours was fullscreen, but then i also read that if it is shown in wide-screen, it's a fake widescreen with added black bars on top/bottom, and by releasing the picture that way it actually makes the image smaller...  so then why do we see full screen on our version (from the box set)...??

PLEASE, someone plz clear this up for us, many thanks!",1165622400,,1788,4.195906432748538
2019163,5,B0001NBM3A,"If you have the cash, why not purchus all three of these hit movies together in one package.  Two of them are set during Batman the animated series.  In Mask of the Phantasm, the past and present collide for Bruce Wane.  Several gangsters in Gothum are being killed by a terrifying figure known only as the Phantasm.  And Batman is accused of being the murderer.  Now, he must discover the identity of this mysterious assassin, and keep one step ahead of the Joker as well.  As far as I know, this movie may be set some time around the first season of the animated series.

  In Subzero, which seems to take place directly after the events in episode 84(Deep Freeze), Mister Freeze is desperate to find a blood transfusion for his beloved wife, who's stasis tube was shattered.  The Comissioner's daughter, Barbara, has the appropriate blood type.  Now Batman has to rescue her.

  Return of the Joker is set during the Batman Beyond animated series.  It seems as if Batman's greatest nemesis has returned, but an aged Bruce Wane refuses to believe that this clown is the real deal.  Now Bruce's successer Terry must do all he can to find the answers.  Fans of the series are in for a real treat along the way as well.  This one's one of my favs.  So enjoy this set if you choose to purchus it.",1154995200,,1294,4.476394849785407
2019164,5,B0001NBM3A,Just ignore the John Q rating all he does anyway is leave bad reviews. These movies are great they are what Batman is about. One of my favorites is Return of the Joker simply because of how twisted Joker truly is.,1138752000,3,213,4.219512195121951
2019165,5,B0001NBM3A,"Just so everyone who is curious about buying this set knows, the 'Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker' is the CUT version unfortunately. This is a really great value otherwise to get three films. Only one you would need other than these to complete the movie set would be the 'Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman' DVD which came out the same year as this set I believe which might be why it wasn't included.",1138579200,35,402,4.445945945945946
