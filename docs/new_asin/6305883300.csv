The video is really inventive...the babies look like they are  really singing!  I have not found any video like it.  My kids and I love to  sing along with the babies (which is great given their difference in ages).  When I ask them what they want to watch on t.v., they ALWAYS request this  video.

Like one of those TV commercials where they have the baby saying adult things through digital superimposing somebody else's lips.

It's very cute.  They sing all the time-loved songs and the lip-overs are done very well considering how awkward those things are, and they are singing perfectly with the songs, so it's not some synchronization confusion to a baby watching.  So, I say it's a winner.  My daughter enjoys it very much and it's pretty well done.

1107539,1,6305883300,"I wonder about the reviewers praising this, and you should, too. I wish I had read all the 1-star reviews before picking this up at Babies R Us. It says ""research shows babies learn to speak  from watching the human mouth"". What they choose to say is how they superimpose an adult mouth singing over the baby, with TRULY CREEPY results.  If you've seen this done on Conan O'Brien's show, where they put a photo of a celebrity and pretend to interview them, you get the picture. And the children used for sound are badly out of tune, which will set the bar low for your child's musical ear. I am insulted by what they did in this production and by the false advertising on the cover.

SAVE YOUR MONEY. If you must have a baby video, we checked out excellent ones from the library: Baby Signing Time (baby sign language learning with kids, and a good singer teaching the signs); also Brainy Baby which is superior to Baby Einstein, although. Baby Einstein is still appropriate. This ""singing babies"" DVD should be banned.",1395964800,,1019,4.557377049180328

Adults, however, find these performing babies just a little creepy, but we are a much harder audience to please.

I like the idea of a video of babies and nursery rhymes so I bought the video in a dollar bin somewhere.  My babies actually did enjoy watching it.  They like the babies and the movement is slow so I feel okay with them watching it.  But the video morphing the the mouths moving is awful.  At least get a mouth that is the same skin color as the baby please!  and the video is just a still picture of a baby with the mouth moving, the eye blinks are animated and look very unreal.  Plus the music is not good.  The melody is fine but when they add harmony it is HORRIBLE!!  The two singers aren't even singing in the same key and it hurts my ears to listen, and I don't want my babies hearing that awful singing either.  I will never buy another video from this line again, I'm very glad that I didn't pay a lot of money for it.",1316131200,,899,4.056818181818182

The fake mouths on the weird looking babies are bad enough...the eyes actually blink occasionally.  The out of tune voices make ""cute"" mispronunciations at times.  This is supposed to for young children who are just learning to talk.  How is mispronouncing the words supposed to help with talking.  If you want a dvd with music and cute kids go with Baby Songs....yeah they are a little dated but sooooooo much better than this piece of trash.

They were cute babies in the video but they are not old enough to sing those songs yet.  Somehow, the producers felt that they have to sing so visual was doubled with older kids' mouth?  It looks so unnatural and creepy.  I don't know if I want to see the dvd again.  Music was ok but it was not the best singing or anything.  Sound was sort of manipulated too to make it sound like children are singing but they are not really children.  I don't know why film makers wanted to make it in the way and it's impossible to understand the concepts.",1290643200,2,716,4.2518518518518515

1107694,3,6305883300,"Parents have to make wise decisions with their limited time and resources. It seems before we look the other way some annoying entertainment feature (Elmo's worlds) or performer (Barney the Dinosaur) has captivated our little one and we have to suffer through it while they sing along, ad infinitum. My nephew was partial to ""Hakuna Matata"" from the Lion King. It means no worries!!!!!

I found this video linked to the outstanding 'My Baby Can Talk' signing video series. My baby and I were so pleased with that I wanted to find something similar to move on to as the series is limited to 3 titles. I saw all the positive reviews here for Singing Babies and, being the spendthrift (or cheapskate, depending on your view), I searched my local library for a copy to preview before buying. Luckily, they had several and I had time to preview while my little one was in day care.

First, I think this is probably good fare for babies 18months and under who get a kick out of seeing other babies. The sets and baby models seem geared to that age group. I like the songs, I don't mind the off key singers (that's pretty much how toddlers sing) but I have to admit, these kids 'singing' via that Conan O'Brian mouth video trick is creepy to me. I'm not sure whether to laugh, be troubled or both. The sets (some are just pictures with babies superimposed over them) are cheap and the bad lighting is depressing. There just doesn't seem to be much imagination and warmth in this so much as computer manipulated video trickery and that bothers me the most. I don't want my baby to inadvertently pick up bad taste, no matter how entertaining. As the gatekeeper of what my tot watches I say 'no', but this might appeal to others so I'm not entirely going to knock it. Like I said, this might be just the thing to captivate younger babies and give parents a welcomed breather- just beware the cost (i.e. your little one starts to prefer WWF wrestling to PBS, smoking generic candy cigarettes when you're not looking and staging illegal Clifford the Big Red Dog fights on the day care playground).",1264550400,2,2085,4.557333333333333
1107695,5,6305883300,Since my son turned two I have been looking for a nursery rhyme DVD we can watch and sing along with. I have purchased one before this and it was awful. I am glad I found the Singing Babies Nursery RHyme time DVD because my son absolutely loves it. He now knows the songs and even though he has difficulty with the lyrics on some he improvises which makes it more fun for us. The husband said that the idea of using adult mouths on the babies is ridiculous and creepy but I don't really mind. As long as my son is happy. The bonus CD was a plus too.,1261526400,,549,4.0
1107696,3,6305883300,"I got this for my daughter when she was 6 month old.  Ok, I confess that also got it for myself because I am lyrics challenged and I don't know nursery rhymes.  Here's a breakdown of grades that I'd give:

Set Design: B-

A bit amateurish.  The babies are stationery, so the producers are a bit limited, I guess.

Animation: C:

Some babies' mouths are animated more realistically than others.  The overall effect is kind of creepy to adult viewers.  For this reason, I don't think this video will have a long viewing life for most purchasers.  As parents, you probably want to find something better/less disturbing when your kid is >1.5 because you can't bear to watch more of this.

Song Selection and Arrangement: A-

Probably not their fault that some nursery rhymes' words are really not age-appropriate, like Three Blind Mice.  I did like their rendition of these familiar songs.  Not boring.

Singing Quality: B-

As other reviewers have noted, some ""babies"" are better singers than others.  I certainly didn't expects these ""babies"" to sing in perfect pitch.  What really irritates me is that the producers knowingly set one of the baby's voice consistently off from the rest of the singers for the entire DVD.  It's very grating and pointless.

Entertainment Factor for My Little One: A

Oh, she was entertained alright.  She was transfixed.  Babies love watching babies.  As soon as she can sit well enough, she clapped and even lifted her heel to tap to the songs' beats.  She learned her songs.

Final Comments:

I know that I should probably rate the product from my kid's perspective as this is a product for her.  That said, I am giving it a 3 and not a 4 because I would seriously think twice about buying this for a friend's child, not wanting to subject my friend to this slightly weird video.  But, if you're looking for something that entertains your kid but not planning to watch it with him/her, this is a fine product.",1260230400,,1941,4.6765578635014835

1107698,3,6305883300,"The good review attracted me to this DVD. My 14 month loves it. It is able to capture her attention during feeding times. But personally, I found it very disturbing to watch some babies sitting there singing with a computerised mouthing motion. That most ghostly part is the lullaby song. There was this lady rocking the crib in the dimly lit room, and there was a ghostly baby face singing at the corner! I usually skipped this song!

The babies appear to be singing, which seems to mesmerize my Connor, who stares at the screen as if to say, ""How do they do that?""  Other times, he smiles, jiggles, and laughs.  He makes sounds (more grunting than singing) but such vocalization is wonderful to witness.  Perhaps, the tune will come to him later.  My only criticism would be that I wish the babies in the video were more mobile, but this hasn't dampened the spirits of Connor with his favorite new DVD, ""Singing Babies Nursery Rhyme Time.""",1153699200,2,671,4.40650406504065
