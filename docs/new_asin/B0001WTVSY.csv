8017109,4,B0001WTVSY,"It's not cheap to get good Chaplin shorts but this set is still very good. It's weird because I have a few other dvds of Chaplin with the shorts on them and they are very good quailty while these prints are passable. I watched these on a Hi-Def tv and these shorts look very good; I don't have a Blu-Ray player yet but I wonder what it would do for this movies. The extra disc that is placed in a slipcase on the side is The Chaplin Puzzle narrated by Burgess Meredith, and it's a very well done film with a remastered version of Police. Overall, a cheap set but still very good considering the shorts are almost 100 years old.",1264291200,2,627,4.190082644628099

8017111,2,B0001WTVSY,"The two stars given are only because I love Charlie Chaplin. As for this collection, most of the pictures are in bad condition and the heads are cut off of the majority of Charlie's earlier classics. It makes it very frustrating to watch. I would pay a bit more and go for a company that cares, not one that just wants a quick buck!",1245456000,,332,4.203125
8017112,4,B0001WTVSY,"CHARLIE CHAPLIN 57 CLASSICS is a five doubled-sided DVD set of comedy shorts and features made during the first five years of Charlie Chaplin's screen career. Highlights include ""The Kid,"" a six-reel fan favorite co-starring little Jackie Coogan, who worked with Chaplin two years earlier in a short called ""A Day's Pleasure."" In ""Kid Auto Races at Venice,"" Charlie is seen for the first time in hobo rags, although he is not yet playing his famous ""Little Tramp"" character.

This extensive collection also includes ""The Immigrant,"" one of C.C.'s famous early films. ""The Bond"" is a 5-minute short Chaplin made in 1918 to promote War Bonds, and another WWI related item, ""Shoulder Arms,"" has Charlie's half-brother appearing in a dual-role: as a sergeant and as the Kaiser. Finally, a unique and daring film is ""One A.M."" Chaplin is all alone here, except for a brief appearance of a taxidriver at the movie's outset. It's a tour-de-force performance that only this master funnyman could pull off.

An added bonus are two parts of a TV documentary narrated by Burgess Meredith. In one episode, Chaplin's first full-length movie (it was also his last work at Keystone) is reconstructed from the short ""Police"" and a reel of material the studio edited out in order to create ""Police.""

8017113,3,B0001WTVSY,"a good set for the money. there are 5 double sided discs and one single disc with a Chaplin documentary hosted by Burgess Meredith. There are shorts from 1914-1918, mostly of low to medium grade quality with less than satisfactory music scores. and also, features such as ""the kid"" and others. if you want quality, i suggest the restored sets from ""image"" and the like.

but this is a lot of Chaplin for a little money. not bad.",1111968000,23,428,4.487179487179487
