I remembered him from the Devil Woman, We Don't Talk Anymore days but was unaware that he was still making music until about a year ago.  I have a lot of his music to catch up on.  His versatility is astonishing.  I have since collected several of his concert DVDs and enjoyed them thoroughly.  This one is a little different from his others.  This first part of the concert is some of the music he has performed over his pop music career and the second part of the concert is music from the big band area, or the Great American Songbook as they call it.  He ""changes gears"" easily and flawlessly handling both genres of music like he has been doing it all his life.  Pretty amazing.",1440460800,,739,4.343065693430657
