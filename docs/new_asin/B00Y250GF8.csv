8717427,3,B00Y250GF8,"King of the Gypsies stars Eric Roberts in his film debut as David Stepanowicz, a young man torn by three forces: his desire to abandon his gypsy roots, the hostility of his father (Judd Hirsch), and his grandfathers (Sterling Hayden) wish that he follow him as King of the Gypsies. Previous movies featuring gypsies depicted them as broad stereotypes. This picture takes a look into the fabric of the gypsy society, showing the conflicts of an ages-old race in modern society. The film is based on Peter Maas (Serpico) non-fiction book of the same name.

Though David tries to make a life for himself in New York City with WASP girlfriend Sharon (Annette OToole), he is drawn back into family melodrama when his mother (Susan Sarandon) calls on him to save his sister (Brooke Shields) from an arranged marriage. Unfortunately, director Frank Pierson (1977s A Star Is Born) meanders his way through the film, taking too much time with exposition. Mr. Hirsch tends to play to the balcony, and doesnt really convince, and Mr. Hayden is completely unrestrained as the old gypsy king. These actors could benefit handsomely from restraint. Made six years after The Godfather, the film has many elements of that film, most notably emphasis on the bond of family and its multi-generational conflicts. Whats missing is the layered texture.

Worthy of note is the production design and Sven Nykvists photography, which contribute to the pictures atmosphere. David Grismans score is lively and provides appropriate accompaniment to the unconventional gypsy culture.",1436659200,2,1554,5.138339920948616
