8244870,5,B00129PUW6,"Unique, funny, brave look at capitalist bureaucracy slowly destroying Swedish society, told through a series of beautifully photographed absurd and surreal vignettes. (Organized religion takes some lumps as well).

The camera never moves, and each scene is a story told in a single wondrously composed and art-directed shot. Some pieces are more powerful than others, some funny, some tragic. But this is bold, adventurous filmmaking. Even it's failed moments are more interesting than most modern 'successes'.

It's fascinating to see how much Andersson's style changed since his great first success 'A Swedish Love Story' 30 years earlier. That film was a subtle, naturalistic, wonderful look at young love. Here he creates what one critic aptly labeled 'Monty Python meets Ingmar Bergman'. I'd throw in ex-Monty Python Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' as well. If that sounds at all interesting to you, check this out, as well as Andersson's equally terrific follow up, 'We, The Living'.

(Note, the pace is very slow by modern cinema standards. but I found myself pulled into it, the way one is by good poetry).

Sadly, this now seems out of print (as are so many great movies), so I advise you to grab it while you have the chance.",1290556800,,1228,5.064356435643564
