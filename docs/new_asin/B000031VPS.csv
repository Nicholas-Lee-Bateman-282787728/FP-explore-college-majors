1256753,3,B000031VPS,"The first film in this anthology is the classic French short La Jetee, a chilling haunting film that you won't be able to get out of your head for days.  All the more remarkable because it is composed almost entirely of stills (there is a brief moving shot about 18 1/2 minutes in that is both startling and deeply moving).  A masterpiece not only of French cinema, but of cinema itself.  Unfortunately, things go downhill fast after this.
Cafe Bar is a brief short of two people who fail to connect in a cafe and fantasize about each other.  It plays like it was written by Jules Feiffer on an off day.
Depth Solitude is visually striking, but the story is labored and obvious.
A Guy Walks Int a Bar stars Fred Savage as a naive young man headed for Hollywood who interacts with various seedy stereotypical characters in the desert.  A bit too long at 27 minutes.
Bride of Resistor-- visually inventive, but the story is a yawn.
Eye Like a Strange Balloon gets my nod for second-best of this DVD.  There are some incredibly surreal images, but damned if I can figure out what it's about.
Vincent: The Junkie Chronicles is a 9 minute excerpt from an interview with a junkie about the damage he's done to himself.  Sad more than shocking.
There are two brief shorts on filmmaker George Hickenlooper's attempts to film an Orson Welles screenplay, which are of interest to diehard film fans only.
And finally there is the aptly named Junk Drawer, a bunch of pointless and juvenile fragments that are not worth your time.
WARNING: one item on the main menu is actually a collection of commercials!
Verdict: La Jetee and Eye Like a Strange Balloon are the only ones worth repeated viewings, a few of the others worth a look, and Junk Drawer is best avoided.",1058918400,11,1752,4.560509554140127
1256754,3,B000031VPS,"One of the loveliest love stories ever acted, crafted and filmed, ""La Jetee"" is a one-of-a-kind masterpiece. Everything about it is precise, effortless, surprising, moving. How a sequence of still frames can create such a sense of coherent narrative and sequentiality is simply bewildering. There is one obvious component, though: the original French narrative. Masculine and vulnerable, coherent and nuanced, it is a major part of the film's sense and aesthetic logic. Even if the claim that Marker ""prefers"" the English version is true, as the filmmaker he is not necessarily its best critic. The English voiceover is not terrible, but it takes away a lot from the piece - not just because the French narration suits it better (it is a very French film) but also because it is simply executed better. Dvd is a format that's supposed to offer precisely these options to viewers, and I'm disappointed that, while every commercial flick is offered in 15 different formats and languages, such a vital aspect of ""La Jetee"" is ignored. It is still worth your while, but waiting for the complete thing (or catching it on screen) is preferable in my view (a view that draws on having followed ""La Jetee"" in different formats about two dozen times, indulges in the cineroman and script, and for a brief while lived in it.)",1052870400,9,1315,4.901345291479821
1256755,3,B000031VPS,"I bought this DVD hoping it would give me La Jete with the original French soundtrack, having already bought the VHS version with the awful English soundtrack (whatever the director may say about it! -- see other review).  Sadly the DVD does not provide alternative sound tracks for La Jete -- it's in English only.",1051488000,3,315,4.7272727272727275
1256756,4,B000031VPS,"....Though many models apparently degrade through ill use or neglect.
Hello?? Are we thinking yet??  Whilst it is a great shame that La Jetee is not presented in both English and French on this DVD release, a measure which would have been inexpensive, simple and after all one of the great things about this technology, it is absurd and ignorant of the reviewers here to complain on the grounds of it being some dumb hollywood machine decision and disrespectful to this wonderful film.  Just to reiterate what has already been stated plainly...
THE ENGLISH-VOICE VERSION IS THE ONE PREFERED BY CHRIS MARKER HIMSELF. now shut up. think before you speak. take the time to know what you're talking about.
And anybody considering buying this film...how can you not?  It's quite simply beautiful.",1046390400,2,791,4.9772727272727275
1256757,4,B000031VPS,"When i ordered this DVD, i thought it would be in english and in french. I was not disappointed because i am French (in fact I watch all movies in their original version), but i had the feeling that the sound of the narration was not good. I'll tell you when i'll get the French version on the 18th of February!(French release)
Nevertheless, i think it is a really good thing that english native speakers can discover this english version. And even if we may prefer the French version, the English one is also an original version, prefered by the director himself, Chris Marker!
Concerning the DVD, do not forget that there is not only ""la jetee"". It contains other shorts which are very creative and interesting! That is why i put a good mark.",1044316800,8,744,4.518518518518518
1256758,1,B000031VPS,"I had first heard of La Jete way back in college from a buddy in film school.  When he asked if I had seen it, I thought he said ""le j'etais.""  I used to be it? I asked.  He kind of freaked out (in the style of film students) at the realization of the cleverness of the dual meaning of the title.
This the kind of subtlety that's lost when a film is dubbed.  While I can understand a studio's decision to dub a film that may achieve a wider audience if the soundtrack is in English (i.e. Life is Beautiful, Jackie Chan's Hong Kong films) I am puzzled by the release of this film in a dubbed version only.  It is not as if this film will ever have a wide following and the DVD format is such that the inclusion of the original naration would not fit on the disk.
If you really want to see La Jete and refuse to see it in it's original French, rent 12 Monkeys (a fine film) in 4:3 instead; you'll be happier.",1017014400,2,906,3.983425414364641
1256759,4,B000031VPS,"I notice that a lot of people are slamming this disc's presentation of La Jetee because of the english dubbing.  Call me a redneck hayseed bumpkin, but I don't speak french, and the subtitles on the french versions I've seen obscure the equally important visuals.  Thank the lord that someone has made a version of this film that the average joe can enjoy without distracting french murmuring and obscurative subtitles.",1013644800,2,419,4.9714285714285715
1256760,1,B000031VPS,"Although I read the review which lamented that ""La Jete"" was dubbed into English, I took a chance, hoping that the default audio track was in English and that an alternate track in French was present.  I was wrong.  This is appalling.  If I could send it back, I would.",975974400,15,269,4.34
1256761,1,B000031VPS,"Okay; I'll admit it. I bought this DVD solely so I'd have a copy of La Jet&eacute;e that doesn't degrade every time I watch it. Unfortunately, this version of La Jet&eacute;e is narrated in ENGLISH. Huh?
The cadence of the  original French narration is hypnotic -- and its meaning filled with  subtleties that get lost in translation. It's a FRENCH thing.
One of the  major perks of DVD ownership is the wondrous world of alternate audio  tracks and a wide selection of subtitles. (You haven't lived until you  watch Groundhog Day subtitled in French!) Evidently, Warner's thinks the  babble of Chris Marker wannabe's is interesting. I certainly don't. I'd  rather listen to the soundtrack of my childhood.
We all have defining  moments. We all walk along one pier or another. La Jet&eacute;e is an eerie,  magical film whose importance in my life cannot be described.
I'll stick  with my ancient, fuzzy VHS version in the original French,  thank-you-very-much.
Yes, Warner's, there IS a difference.",955584000,95,999,5.030487804878049
1256762,3,B000031VPS,"Warner's, in reissuing this excellent disc, has added some audio commentary, but deleted some material.  I imagine most people will buy this to see La Jetee, but they will miss the excellent documentary ""The  making of Portrait of a Lady,"" which was included on side 2 of the old  version.
Oh well.
Warner's has also redone the menus and removed some  fairly humorous interstitials.
Oh well again.  Warner's are not known  for their aesthetics (see the Eyes Wide Shut censored disc, for example) as  much for their attention to the bottom line.",948240000,17,544,4.8478260869565215
7916453,5,B000031VPS,"La Jetee transcends language (and time) so the English version will in no way disappoint.  Moreover this is in no way ""12 Monkeys,"" just an inspiration for the movie.  La Jetee takes one even deeper into the imagination and soul of science fiction.  And you will get it.

If you think you don't like science fiction then see La Jetee, one of its most enduring measuring sticks.",1264896000,,377,4.582089552238806
7916454,2,B000031VPS,La Jete is one of the most incredible science fiction films ever made. See it the right way with the Criterion Collection release. This short series sucks too because the disc is loaded with annoying ads.,1247788800,2,204,4.694444444444445
7916455,4,B000031VPS,"Just to let everyone know who have been disappointed with the DVD versions, that Criterion are bringing out a hi-def version with new and improved English subtitle translations in June, 2007.",1174003200,3,191,5.193548387096774
7916456,5,B000031VPS,"You have heard of the cult-classic La Jette, and either you are dying to see it, or have seen it and are dying to have it. Now you have finally found it on this collection, but are probably having serious second thoughts after looking at the price-tag, and reading all these other pretentious, snobby reviews.

Well, if the price-tag is getting in the way of you buying this, I can empathize. Short Dreams 2 may be a collection, but know before purchasing that La Jette is the only remarkable movie-short on this collection. So only you can decide if a 26 minute movie-short is worth that price. But if money is for the mort-part no object for you in this particular decision, and especially if you have not seen La Jette before, PLEASE do NOT let these detractors on the other reviews turn you away from purchasing Short Dreams 2!

I have never considered myself an American-rube. I lived in Europe twice before (Germany and Switzerland), and among other countries, I have been all over France. I love France; I love her history, culture, food, and landscape... And I think French is the most beautiful-sounding language in the world by far. Taking all of the above into consideration, I think that THIS VERSION OF  La Jette  IS ABSOLUTLEY FINE IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE!

Undoubtedly, the original French version was probably more poetic (and in all fairness, the producers should offer that version too). BUT if one is not fluent in French, subtitles would not work, because this is (except for a very small segment which is live-action [look closely]) an artsy, still-photograph movie-short. If you would watch the original French version and it would have subtitles, you would most likely miss some of the (at times) rapidly changing still-pictures as the film progresses, and consequently not be able to truly experience [or should I type feel?] all of the film at once. And I will not even entertain the notion that the film should only be produced in French with no subtitles- that is elitist, and also not in the spirit of European countries, like France, who often have English and American films dubbed-over in their native language. It is narrated by a Frenchman in English, and I like his mild-accent and his choice of words very much. By the way, most of the people on the other reviews FAIL to mention that this is the PREFERRED version of Chris Marker, the director of La Jette! Case closed. The English version of La Jette works wonderfully, and for me was worth the price. La Jette will make a fine edition to your movie-collection, and I can almost guarantee that most of your friends or family will have never seen it before, or probably never have even heard of it- and if they have any poetic or artistic sensibility, they will love this version of La Jette. Enjoy. :-)",1172880000,3,2789,4.706967213114754

7916458,2,B000031VPS,"I agree with the majority of the opinions expressed here so no need to go into detail - the English narration for La Jetee does a serious disservice to this remarkable film. I have done a fair bit of research to determine a source for the claim that Marker 'prefers' this version but cannot find verification and therefore choose to disbelieve it. I have a fuzzy old version on VHS of the original French version and it is by far preferable. Also the English version suffers seriously in some places from a different mix balance between the narration and the music/sfx - very noticeable at the climactic final scene at the airport - the French one has a tremendous emotional response to the story's conclusion partly because of the soaring music and screaming jet engines, in the English both music and effects are mixed far lower under narration resulting in a very muted concusion. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT ALL ROUND.",1122336000,6,914,4.791139240506329
7916459,2,B000031VPS,"This DVD contains one of non-mainstream cinema's most haunting (there's that word again) classics, ""La Jetee"". A French short done (almost) entirely in B&W stills.

The problem is that the DVD has the 1962 narration, originally done in French with English subtitles, changed to ENGLISH narration.

This is NOT snobbery, but this really hurts the mood of the picture. It's not simply that they dared translate it, but (as one poster points out below) the English narration, aside from changing some of the meaning of the phrasing, is just not as well done as the French. The original French narration was as stark and ominous as the film itself, and the new English narration lacks this, altering the effect of the film, taking it not simply out of France but out of the era in which it was filmed.

Mistake!!! Allegedly, Chris Marker gave his thumbs up on the new narration. If true, that doesn't mean that much to me (Peter Weir cut 7 minutes out of his 1975 film ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" years after the fact and, in so doing, ruined it!) Besides. Marker probably thought the English narration would make the film more accessible to American audiences.....

Well (and this WILL sound snobbish), film fans who are going to appreciate ""La Jetee"" are not the same folks, frankly, who will demand such changes. To do so, panders to an audience that ""La Jetee"" is never going to have anyway.

Find a fuzzy cassette copy with the original French narration: otherwise, you haven't really seen the film.",1098057600,30,1497,4.764478764478764
7916460,2,B000031VPS,"Please note:  I bought this DVD solely for La Jetee and had to return it when I found out that the version on ""Short 2: Dreams"" is the dreadful English language version.  I have read elsewhere that Chris Marker approved this version as well as the French one, and that he allegedly liked this one better. I only hope this isn't true, since I consider La Jetee in French to be one of the great masterpieces in all of film and I have no use for the English-language version. Buyer beware!
La Jetee in French is hard to find on DVD in the U.S., but worth the search.",1085356800,16,563,4.203703703703703

7916462,2,B000031VPS,"Short 2 - Dreams was overall a disapointment.  I bought it strictly for La Jetee (Chris Marker) which, naturally, loses a great deal of eloquence in English, as it appears on the DVD. But it remains an incontrovertably wonderful film. Other than the section by/about Gary Hickenlooper, nothing on the DVD deserves a second viewing. The Hickenlooper pieces, while of interest, are not really engrossing, although I may venture into watching The Big Brass Ring at full length. The long and short of it is this: if you know and love La Jetee enough to want an English version, this is a good buy. Otherwise, don't bother.",1067040000,7,618,4.775700934579439
