8049492,4,B0007ODIF8,"My general feeling after watching the content of this dvd was of satisfaction, i got my money's worth for what this dvd left  me with.

The journey you take trough the HISTORY OF GOLF is well documented and carefully ""chosen"" so no big ""event"" is missing.

The only downpoint of this dvd (and the reason i do not give it the 5 stars) is that there is not a quality MENU to work with, no diferent languages, audio options or subtitles.

This dvd has (as a ""plus"") a ""section"" (that is the only other choise you have at the menu) where you get ""instruction"" as how to swing with what they call : ""follow trough"" , i think this material could be of some use.

I recomend this dvd.",1120608000,16,677,4.217054263565892
