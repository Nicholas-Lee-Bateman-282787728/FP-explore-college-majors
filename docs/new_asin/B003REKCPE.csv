8403594,1,B003REKCPE,"Workouts are okay for someone trying to get back into an exercise program. However, I didn't read the fine print when ordering and was surprised when I was charged for additional DVD's. I cancelled membership today but was even more shocked that it was going to cost about $50 every two months (divided payments) if I hadn't. Glad I caught the charge on my bank statement. Very annoying.",1415664000,11,387,4.705882352941177
8403595,1,B003REKCPE,"Dont waste your time or money with this system. Customer service is horrible, product is boring and cancelling is a chore. Very dissapointed, I should have checked out the reviews before succumbing to this. Lesson learned.",1372636800,17,222,5.194444444444445
8403596,1,B003REKCPE,The wording when you order is deceptive. They are over charging for this product. Very Sad rip off. YOu are auto in rolled in a monthly service that is way to much money and the website lies about it. Workouts are just okay not worth the trouble of dealing with customer service to get out of membership.,1366416000,18,304,4.350877192982456
8403597,1,B003REKCPE,"I rely heavily on the customer reviews I find them very helpful in making my order determination. At the time of my order only 2 reviews were posted.  The reviews cautioned to beware of subscription scams when ordering from the product website.  I classified that as good advice and knew that would not be a problem when ordering through Amazon.  I was still deceived however as the quoted price and the advertisement description lead me to believe I was receiving a set of DVDs.  The quality of the product was poor and a single DVD vice a set.  I was disappointed and unhappy in not receivingwhat I expected, and contacted Customer Service.  They were very cooperative and gave me a full refund.  Their great, friendly and courteous Customer Service restored my confidence and faith in Amazon.  I remain a happy and loyal customer.",1359072000,25,833,4.776223776223776
8403598,1,B003REKCPE,"My experience with this company is negative...as I placed an order over the phone.  There was no choice to speak to a live operator there was only a recording...after the order than came all of the upsells...one after another...and no out other than me pressing the number zero...and still than on some of the upsells there was not out...than came the free trip to some place for two days and than I got an operator ... I had to be almost rude to get her to understand I was not interested in a free trip that was going to cost me money...as far as I am concerned the whole experience with the phone order was a nightmare...the next day I called customer service they told me it takes 24 to 48 hours to find my order...I told the operator that I wanted to cancel my order all she could offer was a cancel note to my info which she told me at first she could not find...and I am to call back within 24 to 48 hours...DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT OVER THE PHONE...I will add to this review after I know for certain that my order was cancelled.

Owe and the price of $9.98 is only for a vhs not the dvds it cost more to order the dvds...another upsell...to me this whole process was dishonest selling...and frustrating.",1338422400,44,1212,4.288209606986899
8403599,2,B003REKCPE,"The workouts are ok, but be very careful where you buy it. The official website automatically enrolls you in a workout every-two-months scam and continues to bill you indefinitely.  Better to purchase a used set and be done with it.",1335830400,40,232,4.8
