Since this company is best known for comedic pieces, I was intrigued to find out of they would be able to handle a serious drama.

I was pleased to discover, that indeed they can.

It is apparent this is early work of those involved, paving the way for future projects to come, so any mistakes made are certainly forgivable. No one makes a gem their first time. This evidences they have made great strides since their first endeavor.

This company is off to a good start. Eagerly awaiting what's next.",1282176000,,699,4.3538461538461535
