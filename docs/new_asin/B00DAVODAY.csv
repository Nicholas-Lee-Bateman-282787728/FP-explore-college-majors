5785793,5,B00DAVODAY,"The Little Mermaid {UK Import: Region Free} Blu-Ray has been in my cart with much hesitation. I can either spend $60+ on the version locked up in the Disney Vault or buy this. Its simply a Choose Your Own Adventure book, I thought? Will it work on my X-Box One? So many questions, despite the items description.

I bought it and with much success it works like a charm. The disk works on all Blu Ray players (including your gaming systems) ... Theres no digital copy or DVD included. For me thats okay!",1525910400,4,502,4.397849462365591

I bought this in July 2017 and found that the movie started stuttering and pausing at about the beginning of the ""Part of that world"" song, and had problems thereafter.  I returned it and ordered another copy, which had the same problem starting at almost the same spot.  Perhaps they're being produced from a bad master version?  or the batch of blanks had a manufacturing defect?  f",1502064000,4,491,4.597701149425287

5785864,1,B00DAVODAY,"A while back I purchased the little mermaid and the lion king, I returned the lion king because it worked once and never again. The same thing happened with the movie the little mermaid. I was then deciding if I need a new DVD machine, but with Christmas and all I had put it off. Last night I found out from my daughter the reason I can't play my dvds are because they are for the U.K. Only. Now I'm stuck with two videos I can't even play and I'm out more than $50.00. Somewhere there should say that these videos can't be played in the USA.

5785877,2,B00DAVODAY,"I made the mistake of showing this to my five year old without watching it first. I learned the lesson to always pre screen a movie for him and not assume ""it's fine"" based on the experience of others. There are several scenes that are extremely negatively intense. Also, a child defying her parents who are doing their best to protect her and, in general, the take away from that was, well, sorry but it's a good thing I did or I wouldn't live happily ever after, and a woman losing her voice in trade off for male affection, then said male winning it back for her...what crappy messages.
