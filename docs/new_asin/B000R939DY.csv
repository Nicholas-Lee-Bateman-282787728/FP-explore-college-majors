2862648,4,B000R939DY,"Their first film together--'Humko Deewana Kar Gaye' (2006)--was a disappointment, but Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif sparkled in 'Namastey London'--her first major hit and his first of four hits in 2007, including another with Kaif later that year, 'Welcome.' They co-starred in the blockbuster 'Singh is Kinng' the following year. But 'Namastey London' remains their best outing together--and one of Kaif's best films.

In only her fifth Hindi movie, Kaif's still a little green, but her promise starts to show here. She plays Jasmeet, who goes by the nickname ""Jazz,"" a London-born girl with India-born parents. With her mother's encouragement and to her father's dismay, she's thoroughly British--in the way she thinks, dresses, and socializes. The role was likely not a stretch for Kaif, who is half-British herself and was raised in the West.

Actor Rishi Kapoor as Jasmeet's father, Manmohan, nearly steals the show. He's no stern villain who only sees his daughter as a reflection of his own honor. Rather, he's like most dads--caring, concerned, struggling to let go of his adult child, worried she's making the wrong choices (which she is), and completely at a loss about what to do about it. Sick of dragging his drunk daughter out of clubs and horrified that she's engaged to her thrice-divorced boss, Charlie (Clive Standen), Manmohan tricks Jazz into going on a family vacation to India with the intention of marrying her off to an Indian while they're there. He thinks he's doing what's best for her when he betroths her to a rural rube, Arjun (Akshay Kumar).

Back home, Jasmeet's friend Imran (Upen Patel) is disowned by his Pakistani father, Parvez (Javed Sheikh), for moving in with his girlfriend Susan. When Imran gets a desperate call from Jazz in India, he advises her to go along with the wedding--because God only knows what her brutish fianc might do to her if she refuses--return to London, and point out to everyone that the marriage isn't legal in the UK, and then no one can force her to do anything. Which is exactly what she does--and then proceeds with her wedding plans to Charlie.

But it turns out that Arjun is a good guy who really loves her and he sets out to win her heart by letting her go and being her friend, with the hope that she'll pick him once she gets to know him. Charlie is such a jerk that even his own father tries to warn her off and Arjun cherishes her so honorably that it's hard to understand what takes her so long to make up her mind.

2862649,2,B000R939DY,"... This is the first movie within my recent Bollywood binge that was a real disappointment. And I wanted to like it as I've loved other films that I've seen with Akshay Kumar, Rishi Kapoor, and (especially) Katrina Kaif. But there's a real problem with Namastey London. Namely its pervasive sexism. It can be seen in the contrasting stories of Jazz (Katrina Kaif) and her best friend, Immy Khan (Upen Patel). Immy's disowned (more or less) by his father for advising Jazz on escaping a marriage that she's outright being forced into, because, apparently, the only thing wrong in the situation was his advice, and not the boorish behaviour of Rishi Kapoor's father character (or even Akshay Kumar's prospective husband for taking advantage of the situation). The elder Mr. Khan even hits his son in the confrontation, outraged over the tragedy that's befallen Arjun (Akshay Kumar). He can't seem to spare a thought for Jazz's tragedy (stranded in a corner of the world where she has no protection and forced into an unwanted marriage), just the husband that exploited the situation. The filmmakers invite the viewer to sympathise with Arjun's plight (which is the mirror image of Jazz's), but not Jazz's. In fact, in the ultimate irony they invite us to be angry with Jazz for her clever escape.

The plot's simple enough, Jazz was born in the UK and her mother has raised her to be as British as she can be. As a result she enjoys her life as a typical twentysomething Londoner. Drinking, partying, carousing, dating Englishmen. We see her doing her level headed best to drive away all the prospective Indian husbands that her parents arrange for to meet. She's dating her wealthy boss and has plans to marry him, a thought that the filmmakers find unacceptable (given the heavy handed commentary inserted into the mouth of Rishi Kapoor's father). The father decides that what Jazz really needs is a good Indian husband, and talks her into accompanying he and his wife on a vacation trip to India. Once they arrive in Punjab, ostensibly to visit relatives, he springs upon her an arranged marriage with a Punjabi farmer (Akshay Kumar). She initially wants to flee the situation, but her best friend instead lays out an escape route for her, namely go through with the ceremony, but insist that the reception be held back home in London, and make certain that the marriage is unconsummated. Once back on English soil, no British court will recognise the marriage. This break (with the usually overly melodramatic music) starts the quest of Akshay Kumar's character to win Jazz's heart in earnest.

So, back to the sexism, Immy is uninterested in Indian women, living instead with an English woman that his father despises. Her parents expect him to assimilate to their way of life, but ultimately Akshay Kumar's character sets him straight. If she's marrying into his family, then she needs to learn to compromise. Immy has his own life, faith, and culture, and the family will need to learn to embrace both traditions. Good advice, marriage is all about making compromises. But it's a one way street in the movie. Because ultimately Akshay Kumar has no interest in making any compromises with British born & raised Jazz. The movie ends with Immy's father embracing his son & daughter-in-law after she agrees to submit to his conditions, and Jazz returning to India to be a Punjabi housewife, which leaves the viewer with the impression that the filmmakers believe that marriage is really about women learning to compromise with and accommodate their men. Or maybe that what every woman needs is a good Indian husband to teach them their place (as marrying a white woman is acceptable for Immy but marrying a white man is unthinkable for Jazz). The entire third act of the movie was a complete betrayal of the character of Jazz as we've come to know her and like her. A strong willed professional woman throws it all away to run off to India to be an obedient wife. I would have had more respect for the film if it ended with Arjun removing to London to make a new life with his wife. But, alas, Indian men don't need to compromise with their wives, apparently.

So while there's a lot to like about this movie, the pervasive sexism is really offputting. Rishi Kapoor's father is outright obnoxious & overbearing throughout most of the movie (which, admittedly, is a stock character for him, but at least in other movies the filmmakers recognise it as a character flaw), and yet the filmmakers see nothing wrong with him as one of the ""good guys"". Indeed, outside Upen Patel's best friend, the male characters in this movie are a pretty shabby lot. Javed Sheikh (as the elder Mr. Khan) spends the movie stomping about yelling at, and occasionally physically abusing his son. Clive Standen's English fiance is a rich boor (and one wonders what the engaging Jazz sees in him at all). Maybe they should have entitled the film ""Men Behaving Badly and the Women that Obey them"". What shocked me about this movie was its stone age ideas on male/female relations, and I haven't seen these sorts of reactionary views on women in other Bollywood films that I've watched recently, such as Jab we Met or Hum Tum. However, I will say that I would watch Katrina Kaif fold laundry for two hours, so an actual movie where she spends most of it being charming is a bonus.",1261180800,6,5355,4.774541531823085

2862655,5,B000R939DY,"For unabashed, expansive love stories which dwell in that exalted state of heartbreak, go no further than a Bollywood film. NAMASTEY LONDON, which came out in 2007, is only the latest example of this Indian cinema's penchant for giddy, achy romance and go-all-out musical numbers. I happen to think that this picture is a Bollywood gem and shouldn't be missed.

Jasmeet (Katerina Kaif), who prefers to be called Jazz, is a bright and beautiful Indian girl who was born and raised in London and, thus, has picked up westernized sensibilities and a modern attitude. Jazz insists that she is British and scoffs at the idea of marrying a nice Indian boy, even going so far as to sabotage her parents' attempts to introduce her to one. Instead, she hooks up with her British boss, the urbane Charlie Brown (yes, Charlie Brown), who boasts Prince Charles for an acquaintance. Finally, Jazz's partying lifestyle becomes too much for her father and he acts. He convinces his daughter to go along on holiday to India, where he has Jazz run a gauntlet of prospective husbands. But the suitors prove to be hopeless and weird. At this time, enter Arjun.

Arjun (Akshay Kumar) happens to be the son of a friend of Jazz's dad, and Arjun fancies Jazz. Soon, a marriage is arranged, to Jazz's vehement objections. But Jazz tricks Arjun into flying to London on their wedding night. Once in London, she refuses to acknowledge the wedding's legitimacy and proclaims herself a single girl, with the intent of marrying her British boyfriend. Arjun is heartbroken but decides to remain in London until Jazz's wedding to Charlie. In the limited time left him, Arjun hopes to win his wife's heart.

Let me say this, I love this movie. It's breezy and delightfully contemporary. At 2 hours 12 minutes, this one is shorter in length than the Bollywood norm and that, perhaps, helped the film as, this time, the script had to be trimmed of fat, leaving no room for non sequitur subplots. Whoever wrote the story knew how best to tug at your heart strings. There are tiny but perfect romantic moments here which provide intoxication for the soul. Attractive leads Akshay Kumar and Katerina Kaif provide sizzling chemistry as they turn in performances which I soon won't forget. True, it took me a while to like Akshay's character as his Arjun seemed to be too much the laughing, rustic Punjabi yokel who guzzles milk straight from the cow. And yet, once in London, he reveals his true mettle. Out of his element, unable to speak English, Arjun remains steadfast and clings to his love for Jazz. This love is the primary driving force which enables him to accomplish all that he does in his stay. Accomplishments which seem ordinary. But, on closer look, the things that Arjun does for Jazz are quite remarkable. This is the best I've seen of Akshay Kumar. As much as Katerina dominated the first half of the movie, Akshay owns the second half. Just watch this man, the ache in him as he gazes at Jazz. The wistful, self-mocking grin he flashes. Arjun is perfectly aware of the situation and its implications (his family in India thinks him still happily married) but what else can he do but try his best to win the unattainable girl? And if he can't win her love, then, at least, be in her company for as long as possible. Yup, this is good acting by Akshay.

Katerina Kaif complements him wonderfully. Katerina is still fairly new to acting. NAMASTEY LONDON is her second film with Akshay Kumar, the first being the 2006 release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Humko-Deewana-Kar-Gaye/dp/B000G1IKLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Humko Deewana Kar Gaye</a>. Born in London in real life, of a British mum and an Indian dad, she was dubbed by other actors as it was felt her skill with the native Indian tongue wasn't nearly proficient enough. Here, for the first time, she gets to dub her lines in Hindi. Acting wise, Katerina hits all the right notes. She integrates personal growth into her character. Initially a spoiled, hip girl who only wanted to have fun and who scorned the Indian lifestyle, Jazz matures in her ways and eventually changes her outlook and her preferences, thanks to Arjun's presence and influence. Yet, even with this maturity, Jazz retains her vibrancy. The camera wonderfully catches the expressions on her face every time she looks at Arjun, expressions which transition from bemusement to confusion to appreciation, and, finally, to tenderness.

NAMASTEY LONDON does engage in unsurprising nationalism here (the film even momentarily becomes a travelogue for India) and portrays several of the Brit characters in less than complimentary light. From Charlie's making fun of Indian dances at a rugby match to old Mr. Pringle's civilized racial slurs to English parents who, before they allow their daughter to marry Imran, Jazz's Pakistani friend, demand that he change his name to Ian or Immanuel, give up his religion, and sign paperwork indicating that he isn't involved in terrorist acts. Now that's cold.

The sub-title work stumbles in places, never more glaringly than when it butchers the Pussycat Doll's ""Don't Cha"" lyrics as ""Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?"" becomes ""Don't you wish to gulp Haywards hot like me?"" On the positive side, there's an extensive ""Making Of"" segment, gratifyingly sub-titled in English for us who are Hindi-challenged. The songs are all fantastic (and how rare is that?), from the hip, disco-trendy ""Dilrooba"" to ""Rafta Rafta,"" with its explosion of brilliant colors, and to the wistful and hopeful ""Yehi Hota Pyaar."" There's also the brief, heartachy interlude of ""Veeraniya,"" but the most effective and most fun track is ""Chakna Chakna"" which showcases a riveting performance by Akshay. The songs in London, by the way, are an even bigger hoot when one factors in that these numbers jarringly utilize British back up dancers.

I've a few favorite moments in this film. The amusing bit with the ridiculous suitor obsessed with Indian soaps is one. Then, following Arjun's quiet declaration of love to Jazz, the song ""Yehi Hota Pyaar"" shows fleeting scenes of Arjun running into her all over London, which includes a moment I particularly cherish (I dunno why, exactly), of Jazz having a footwear malfunction and Arjun helping her out. I also enjoyed Jazz's discomfort in India (which is presented humorously), the rugby match, Rishi Kapoor's droll supporting turn as Jazz's dad, the dancing in the dark, and Arjun's patriotic speech, with Jazz translating, to the condescending Mr. Pringle. Most of all, I enjoyed the romantic essence of the film. Really, is there anything more elegantly heartbreaking than unrequited love? NAMASTEY LONDON would have you believe: no.",1180828800,17,6760,5.0303571428571425

2862657,5,B000R939DY,"I watched this with multiple young ladies and it really opened up some good conversations about suitable and unsuitable men. Jazz was so blind to her playboy boss's behavior, even when warned by his family and father. It was a good example of blind infatuation and rebellion for the sake of rebellion. It was interesting that Jazz's parents had actually chosen the better man and that he was kind, patient, and wooed Jazz. He showed sacrificial love, rather than selfish, possessive love. There were multiple couples faced with cultural differences and how they were handled was very well done. I wish Jazz had not been such of a brat, but I guess that's what allowed her to grow over the course of the movie.

This movie was well done, was a bit typical Bollywood, and yet that's what made it work. All the actors fit their parts so well. In a way, it reminded me of Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi in what a great example it was on how a man can court a woman, and it's the

Katrina rubs me the wrong way in real life, but there is no denying that she is an excellent actress for this type of film.  This is Akshay Kumar's forte, with his mixture of gullibility ""aw shucks ma'am"" and amazing good looks.

I also love the actors in the movie. He is one of my favorite Indian actors. Enjoy!",1386979200,,370,4.013513513513513

2862695,5,B000R939DY,"I love this movie!  For the sweet patient and unabashed love of Arjun, for the hilarious dance in the rugby game, for the speech about India at the party, for the Bollywood flavor that was tamed a bit for a more ""western"" audience.  Though sometimes over-the-top (which is pretty much a prerequisite for any Bollywood film), it still captured my heart and acknowledged real issues.  I enjoyed the subplot of Imran and Susan's relationship.  I was already a fan of Katrina but am now going to seek out more of Akshay's films.",1381449600,,524,4.663043478260869

2862698,3,B000R939DY,"Not well acted. Perhaps 'ok' entertainment value. I wasn't impressed, but probably ok for the diaspora audience, towards which, it is designed anyway..",1373414400,,151,5.608695652173913
2862699,5,B000R939DY,"I first started watching this movie when I had Netflix. I watched the first hour and I could not get into it. Usually I watch Shahrukh Khan movies, but I thought I would give Akshay Kumar a chance and I am glad I did. This movie is so cute, sad, and sweet. I heard there will be a Namastey 2 coming out in 2015. I can not wait.",1371686400,,327,3.823529411764706

Absolutely lovely story...sweet, sad and after all, beautiful!",1358208000,,367,3.8533333333333335
2862702,5,B000R939DY,"This movie is really quite funny and entertaining. However, it also offers real drama balancing the movie out. The story takes place in London, with a semi-traditional Hindi family trying to reel their daughter in from British influence. The family then takes a trip to Punjab India where an arranged marriage happens out of the blue. The daughter plots to go along with it until she gets back to London to marry her love interest. However, reality soon sinks in that her family chose the better man for her after all. Definitely, worth the watch and purchase.",1355443200,,560,4.783505154639175
2862703,3,B000R939DY,"This is a light hearted movie, that is worth a one time watch. The movie does drag in the end and has the typical wish-washy Bollywood end, but Akshay Kumar carries the movie quite well in the first half. The video and sound quality is excellent as well.",1348531200,,254,4.3125
2862704,5,B000R939DY,"Great for the whole family. I watched this on instant stream and loved it. It' is touching , funny , unashamedly patriotic and just plain romantic.  I'm quickly becoming an Akshay Kumar fan. His characters  simple self respect, his love for Jazz , his pride in his country are something all nationalities can relate to.  Never walk away from this film till the credits are done because you will miss a few very important things.  Keep up the good work Amazon. Enjoy the movie . Bought this one..watch it often.",1329696000,,510,4.633333333333334

8199516,2,B000R939DY,Katrina Kaif is gorgeous. I enjoy bollywood movies I really do but I just couldn't stand the entire FORCED MARRIAGE being put on as a good thing for Indian women. The ending completely betrays Kaifs character if she was truly a free spirited independent new aged indian woman she would have never gone back to India for a man regardless of whether or not she fell for her forced husband. The entire message from this movie was that Men can do whatever they want but  women do as they are told,1523491200,,492,4.406593406593407

8199521,3,B000R939DY,"Jasmeet (Katrina Kaif) was raised in London and has turned into a wild young woman, rejecting her Indian roots and going by the appropriate name of ""Jazz"".  Her father (Rishi Kapoor) takes her on a trip through India, ending in his hometown in Punjab.  While there, he marries her (not willingly) to his best friend's son, Arjun (Ashkay Kumar).  When the couple returns to London, Jazz announces that she doesn't recognize the Indian marriage, and proceeds with her plans of becoming the fourth wife of her boss (Clive Standen).  Arjun, must either give in gracefully and lose his wife, or find a way to fight for his marriage by showing Jazz that true love can win.

The plot is cute and fun, and I enjoyed it. Kumar is a good actor and played both comedy and serious well.  I'm not fond of Kaif, and don't feel that she is a particularly good actress, but she was well suited for this role.  The supporting cast (especially Nina Wadia) are excellent. The locations and cinematography were great.  However, I actively disliked the club music/dancing (though the other music was good), and for me that lowered the movie from four stars to three.",1508544000,3,1145,4.69
