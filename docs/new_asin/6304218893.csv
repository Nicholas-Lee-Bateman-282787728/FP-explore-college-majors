824314,5,6304218893,"After seeing this movie as a rental, I decided that I had to own it. I first came across the story I believe on Crimelibrary.com. which told the tale of the young poisoner. Curiously smitten with the story, I dug aroung and came across the film.  The movie is dark and sinister with a touch of humor to lighten the subject matter, which is not laughable at all. The YP, has a serious fetish with chemicals, especially deadly ones. He then decides to start testing these products on other people, and not strangers mind you. I don't really want to explain too much, but I will say the unbelievable thing about the young man, was he showed absolutely no remorse for his actions. Which were pretty extrordinary and unforgivable to his test subjects.(One in particular) Overall, this is definately a must see even if you are not a fan of foreign films.",1143590400,2,848,4.578947368421052

MY OLD VHS COPY LOOKS BETTER THAN THIS TRANSFER. if you still have a vcr at home then do yourself a favor, buy a vhs copy & enjoy... otherwise, this is a great movie w/ lots of style & a nasty sense of humor!!! would be 5 stars if not for the lack-luster, seemingly 3rd generation video tape transfer picture quality... this movie deserves a proper dvd release(i.e. picture restoration, orig. aspect ratio, sound restoration, etc.)  WATCH IT!!!",1141689600,3,494,4.613636363636363
824316,4,6304218893,"Although this movie is based on fact, it still however is very worth the viewers time to watch.  British films are often hard to watch or comprehend by Americans, but this movie does not fall in this category.  I wish more films such as this were available to Americans.",1126656000,,270,4.489795918367347
824317,4,6304218893,"This movie is all from the point of view of a young man who poisons his family, schoolmates, and a lot other people who he runs into. Even though he is a horrible person because you see the movie through his eyes you almost want him to get away with it. Because you see his reasons for why he does what he does you almost understand him. At one point of this movie, I was like ""Oh yeah you gotta kill him."" This movie is great but not all people I think will enjoy it as much as I did.",1117324800,,485,3.86
824318,4,6304218893,"Graham Young (played by Hugh O'Conor) is a very intelligent British teenager who finds an affinity for chemistry and none for social skills.  As a step-child he finds himself buffeted about by his new family.  Believing himself capable of great things, he fancies himself a king who needs a queen.  Unfortunately the queen of his choice already has a relationship with a classmate-buddy of his.  When an experiment with antimony sulfide goes awry, Graham changes strategies and puts the antimony (and later, thallium) to a less acceptable use.  Eventually he goes to a prison for psychopaths.  There he is clever enough to work through a psychologist, Dr. Zeigler (played by Antony Sher), to win a release and a new life.  But what happens then?

The joy of the movie is strong supporting cast who react in  quirky, British ways to Graham and the mysterious illnesses going around.  O'Conor gives an intense but restrained portrayal of the troubled lad and provides some good skin shots as well.  Sher is a convincing professional trying to salvage some good from the unpromising inhabitants of the hospital.  The acting is witty throughout.

It is a shame the DVD has no extras at all, other than a scene list.  Still, the low price makes the DVD a bargain.  Recommended.",1113264000,7,1272,4.878504672897196
824319,4,6304218893,"Based on the exploits of a real young man who poisoned his way through life, this film by writer-director Benjamin Ross is clever, sharp, and simultaneously disturbing.  As introvert loner Graham Young, Hugh O'Conor captures just the right mix of intelligence, emotional distance, and nastiness that made up the character of the real poisoner.  But Ross is witty and imaginative as well as faithful to the facts; he livens up the tale with some punchy black comedy, dream imagery, and creative cinematography that makes this much more than a conventional film.
His first victim is his stepmother.  This is one of the most disturbing sequences in the film; we watch her disintegrate before our eyes and it is painful viewing.  But by that time, Ross how shown how a crude, dysfunctional family can produce someone like the young poisoner and it's a strong portrayal indeed.
Graham does not stop with his stepmother, of course.  His relentless quest for the perfection of his craft has its consequences, not least of which is 'treatment' by a well-meaning psychiatrist who insists on Graham sharing his dreams.
For those who like disturbing British black comedy-drama--one of the real fortes of British cinema--this one's for you.",1038614400,14,1228,5.08955223880597
7866526,4,6304218893,"This film seems to be a homage to Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"". It has a lot of deliberate ""quotes"", and shares similar themes and music. It's a kind of dialogue between the two directors, a reply. Clockwork Orange was speculative fiction, suggesting this is how society could become, whereas The Young Poisoner's Handbook is retrospective, and based on a true story, in effect saying we are already there, and were so ten years before Clockwork was made.

The story is based on the actual life of homicidal poisoner Graham Young, and doesn't do too much to hide that this is a biography, not some grim fictional noir. Graham narrates the entire film, and talks about how from childhood he really had nothing in common with his working class London family, but early on determines he has a talent for chemistry, and uses his experiments as an escape. By the time he is a teen, humankind consists of just so many lab rats as far as Graham is concerned. And Graham isn't interested in curing people, instead he wants to poison them. He turns his attention first to his stepmother, not that his sister Winnie escapes his chemical wrath entirely when her prying eyes get to be a problem as he slowly poisons dear old mom. Graham's solution - poison her eye drops and blind her. Fortunately he only disposes of one eye. Like the Mafia, none of this is personal for Graham, it's really just an experiment.

The great irony is that the law actually does catch Graham after he kills his stepmom, and he ends up in a place for the criminally insane, probably to be there forever as he is judged a sociopath. But one psychiatrist has other ideas. Graham interests him, and he decides to ""cure"" him. The doc overestimates the ability of science to defeat sociopathy, but Graham, at first intending to con the doc just to get out, gets tragically conned himself into believing himself eventually cured.

So after nine years Graham is released. But that's the thing about prison. Inmates - even in psychiatric prisons - usually do well as long as you supervise their every move - when they sleep, when they work and what they work on, when they eat. The problem is when they get out and have freedom of choice as to their own path. I'd normally say watch and find out what happens, but Columbine and cultural cowardice means you probably never will. After 1999, when some teens began to become lethal and to use the popular culture as a model for what form their killing would take, the movie industry began to fear giving them ideas. Thus I have not seen this film on TV for 20 years and the DVD is long out of print and something tells me this is NOT on Criterion's short list.

Artistically, this film is full of good performances and the art design gets the drab look of early 60s London just right. From the crowded housing, to the local pub, to the frumpy furnishings meant entirely for utility not for decoration, to the cheesy act that passes for early 60s British TV, this film has England of the period nailed. It even hints of the sexual revolution that happened while Graham was in jail and thus missed out on that just increases his social isolation and misreading of social cues.

I'd highly recommend this one if you can ever find it. It does pop up on youtube from time to time.",1514160000,,3283,4.557627118644068

7866530,4,6304218893,"1950s Britain never looked so dystopian and between his grotesque family and idiot prison psychiatrists, you find yourself wanting young Graham to keep getting away with it.",1416182400,,173,5.444444444444445
7866531,2,6304218893,"I am of the distinct opinion that stories like this shouldn't be produced unless there is some real attempt to understand what went wrong.  Otherwise it just becomes ""fan fiction.""  The entire script seems cobbled together from newspaper quotes, then further details fabricated out of thin air.  Not once do we get the slightest glimmer of ""why"" any of this happened but only ""how.""  It even begins with text that says none of the characters outside his family bears any resemblance to real people and that the poison was not obtained at his workplace as shown.  A documentary with interviews from people who actually knew him would have been infinitely more revealing.",1408492800,,669,4.9375

7866533,5,6304218893,"If you liked A Clockwork Orange, or the old film noir movies (like A Touch of Evil), then this is for you. Graham is a teenage social outcast with a brilliant mind but no social skills, growing up in a dysfunctional family. Chemistry is his only true love.  Sadly, he uses it for malign purposes.  Inspired by a true story, this is one of the best of the genre.",1299974400,,361,4.217391304347826
7866534,4,6304218893,"Benjamin Ross's gruesome but hilarious The Young Poisoner's Handbook is based on the true story of Graham Young. Played by Hugh O'Conor, Graham is a teenage genius whose fascination with chemistry doesn't bode well for those who rub him the wrong way. The movie's cast of cartoonish characters are as unlikeable as Graham, though not nearly as intelligent. Graham's awful family is a macabre parody of an ideal British 1960s household. A psychiatrist played by Antony Sher is the only character with any sign of subtlety or decency. In spite of its disturbing content, this fast paced film is filled with humorous juxtapositions and ironies. Still, The Young Poisoner's Handbook is, at the end of the day, a strangely believable portrait of cold madness.",1289692800,,754,5.088709677419355
7866535,1,6304218893,"Pay heed to the New Yorker's review above--this is so drab and dull my husband and I didn't finish it. The tone is confused and the spots of melodrama undermine both the sinister aspects and the parts that would be funny. The characters are merely grotesque and impossible to either sympathize with, or despise. Also, the plot moves forward largely because everybody--including the ""young poisoner"" himself--is a moron. Hard to find something to like here.",1252368000,,456,5.093333333333334
