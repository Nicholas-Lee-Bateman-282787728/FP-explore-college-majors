8492657,5,B0064NTZ8K,"ACHTUNG BABY is without any doubt in my list of the MOST RELEVANT ALBUNS OF ALL TIME!!!This is a high quality album where i trully think ALL the songs ARE AMAZING!!!! UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD, THE FLY, ACROBAT, EVEN BETTER THAN THE REAL THING.....These songs are sooooo brilliant! By this time, U2 incorporate a more funky spacey sound, which i think brings the best from THE EDGE...His guitars in ACHTUNG BABY are unique! BONO's lyrics are powerful here! BONO bring some true poetry to music here...Well, this is really a classic album! ENJOY!",1332979200,2,546,4.757894736842105
