7951867,3,B00005R86W,"I showed this, and lectured from it, to my 8th grade classes.
The concepts presented were fine.  They were of course juvenile, so my students enjoyed them, but when it came time for the math portion, they were lost.
It wasn't that the math was that difficult, it's just that this program beat it to death, drug it outside and beat it again.  Even I just wanted it to end and had to keep encouraging my kids to hang in there.",1241308800,2,424,4.222222222222222
7951868,5,B00005R86W,"There may be some confusion about the purpose of Standard Deviant videos.  The stated goal of this series is ""enhancing the academic SUCCESS of students everywhere"".  Each video is designed with the college student in mind, for review in preparation for exams, or as an introduction to a tough subject of study, and they accomplish that purpose AMAZINGLY well!

These excellent overviews present important concepts in a memorable way.  Yes, they can be silly and irreverent (hence the series title, a delightful play on words) but it's all to make your retention stronger during those stressful testing moments.  Videos cover lots of crucial material fast, with the idea that you can replay any section as often as you need to, until you ""get it"".  All videos contain study techniques and reference cards to make test prep easier.

These videos are NOT designed to be used by an instructor as ""additional support material"" to be shown to their students, either in the classroom or out.  Nor are they a replacement for a good teacher/textbook.  You will not find collections of demonstrations or experiments here, we are moving too fast for that.  Nor will you find any examples or explanations a good teacher wouldn't have given already.  These are a STUDY TOOL, not a TEACHING TOOL.  Rating these useful and effective videos as a poor teaching tool is like rating an orange badly because it doesn't taste like an apple.  It's unfair and misleading.",1141084800,17,1449,4.93801652892562
