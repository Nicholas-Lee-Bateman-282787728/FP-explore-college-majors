1059566,4,6305710465,well this event could of been a little better but still good. It started out with the hardy boyz and lita against t@a and trish stratus (7/10).  perry saturn against eddy gurrero was average 7/10.  acolytes against edge and christian was a snooze fest 4/10.  Kurt angle vs. undertaker was better than i expected 8/10.  y2j against hhh in a last man standing was the best match 9/10. The main event was chris benoit against the rock in a pretty good match 8/10.  I would pass on buying but it is good for a rent or two.,969926400,4,518,4.298969072164948
1059567,1,6305710465,"ok well yall are losin it cuz teh best ppv of the year so far was either no way out or king of the ring.............the main event was ever so  predictable, taker was so easily going to win and last man standing was  stupid cuz hhh didn't tap i mean what are they all supermen now woulnd't  you like to see some realism n have some1, any1 tap out!",968112000,2,347,4.0
1059568,5,6305710465,"I was there live and it was great.  The only disappointment was only one title changed hands and that was Perry Saturn defeating Eddie Guerro for  the European title.  The best match was Rikishi vs. Val Venis in a steel  cage for the Intercontinental title when Rikishi did the Jimmy Snuka off  the top of the cage and onto Val Venis's ribs.  I loved watching The Hardy  Boyz w/Lita beating T&A w/Trish, especially when Lita kicked Trish's  ass.  As usually Edge and Christian kept the belts after getting themselves  disqualified after using  the belts on the Acolytes.  I was pretty sure  Tazz was going to choke out Al Snow.  Lot of blood in the Last man standing  match when Triple H beat Chris Jericho by one second.  The Undertaker vs.  Kurt Angle was the funniest because Angle just didn't stand a chance bsides  he was still too paranoid.  I was proud of Mick Folly when heordered the  main event to continue after Benoit thought he won the belt from the Rock,  but the Rock won in the end.",966297600,4,998,4.49438202247191

The matches were all of high quality and very  entertaining.  The bloody Last man standing match between Jericho and HHH  was one of the best matches this year.  The Benoit vs. The Rock Title match  was full of entertaining moves blood.  The cage match between Rikishi and  Val Venis for the Intercontinental Title involved one of the most awesome  things I've seen for a long time, as Eikishi climbed to the top of the cage  and splashed Venis who was 15 feet below in the ring.  This ppv included  many more exciting matches also, like Kurt Angle vs Undertaker and Tazz vs.  Al Snow.  I am definately going to buy this video on September 19.",964483200,2,806,4.462068965517242
1059687,5,6305710465,"Nearly every match was good on this one! Even the weaker bouts had memorable moments in them. The opener was The Hardy Boyz & Lita Vs. Test, Albert (now known as A-Train) & Trish Stratus! This is one of the best mixed tag team matches I've ever seen. From a male standpoint, I have to say that Trish was looking hot in hot pink! Not much from a wrestler standpoint though she's improved greatly in that area since this match. I think this was Lita's big break as a figure in WWF as well.
Eddie Gurrerro Vs. Saturn was average at best. Disappointing since both men are great performers. TAZZ Vs. Al Snow was more of a display for TAZZ and his skills. Rikishi Vs. Val Venis wasn't good except for seeing Rikishi splash Val from the top of the cage! That made the match for me!
The triple main event pretty much lived up to expectations in my view. First, The Undertaker (in his American Badass form) Vs. Kurt Angle. This was pretty much a squash for UT though you see flashes of the greatness we would see later on from Angle. Not bad.
Next was Triple H Vs. Chris Jericho in a Last Man Standing match! I still watch this match as this is when ""The Game"" put on great matches (though lately he has been getting back to that form and I am glad)! Jericho was great in this as well! Lots of blood so if you are squemish, don't watch!
Now, The Rock Vs. Chris Benoit was a pleasant surprise! I love the Rock but even I'll admit that Benoit is superior in terms of technical wrestling but The Rock kept up with him pretty well! The false ending with Mick Foley was a nice touch as well as The Rock (barely) held onto the WWF Title after it looked like Benoit had won!
Overall, its worth the money. WWF/WWE PPV's were generally good throughout 2000 but this one was one of the top five in my view!",1088467200,,1787,4.228070175438597
1059688,5,6305710465,"As far as pay-per-views go, 2000 was a very solid year for the WWE. Another great PPV that you can add to the list for 2000, is Fully Loaded. The show was well rounded for the most part with 5 out of 7 matches being enjoyable. The best match of the pay-per-view, and one of the best of the year, was Chris Benoit vs The Rock for the WWE title. Benoit and The Rock had suprisingly good chemistry together considering the fact that Benoit is much more technically sound than The Rock. Another excellent match on the card was Triple H vs Chris Jericho in a ""Last Man Standing"" match. Both Jericho and Triple H were at the top of their games in this one. The Undertaker vs Kurt Angle was a little short for my tastes, but the match was still satisfying because of how the feud had been built up. It was very funny seeing Kurt trash The Undertaker's motorcycle. The two other stand out matches in my opinion were Val Venis vs Rikishi in a ""Steel Cage"" match for the IC title, and the European title match between Eddie Guerrero and Perry Saturn.
Overall, Fully Loaded was a very enjoyable pay-per-view. The majority of the matches on the card were fun to watch, and all of the performers involved put on a good show. If you are a WWE fan, I highly recommend picking up Fully Loaded 2000.

Lita and Team Extreme vs. T&A and Trish 5/10
It was an ok opener, could of been better if Lita and Trish got at it more
Perry Saturn vs. Eddie Guerro European title match 6/10
This match was boring and the little Chyna, Terri thing was dumb and pointless, but Perry and Eddie put on a good match
Rikishi vs. Val Venis IC Title Cage Match 6/10
RIKISHI OFF THE TOP OF A CELL??? WHAT! Yes Rikishi does fly off the cell but still loses the match because of Tazz??
Tazz vs. Al Snow 3/10
BORING! Both of them should just stick to Tough Enough, and Commentary
APA vs. Edge and Christian 4/10

Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle 6/10
Again this match blew by fast also, but Taker put on a show
Chris Jericho vs. Triple H Last Man Standing 8/10

1059691,5,6305710465,"This was the best WWE PPV of 2000 in my opinion. You have Rikishi taking on Val Venis in a steel cage match. Watch as Rikishi hits Val with a dangerous frog splash from the top of the 12ft. cage! You have to see it to believe it! Also, Kurt Angle takes on The Undertaker in a fairly good matchup that could've been a whole lot better than it was, but I still liked it. The Rock takes on Chris Benoit in the WWE Championship main event. This match was pretty good, but didn't blow me away too much. The Last Man Standing match between Triple H and ""Y2J"" Chris Jericho was the best match on the card. It wasn't for the faint of heart, as ""The Game"" and Chris Jericho tore into one another like dogs and attempted to keep the other man down for the 10 count. Triple H takes an extremely hard chair shot to the fore head by Jericho and, as a result, is busted wide open BIGTIME!!! Blood begins pouring from a deep gash in his fore head, so be alert gore hounds! You'll love this match. Also, one of the best darn six person intergender tag matches ever--the Hardy Boyz and Lita vs. T&A and Trish Stratus! I love this matchup!!

1059692,3,6305710465,"WWF Fully Loaded was a Hyped up PPV held in Dallas Texas. This event had an awaited triple main event.
-Trish Stratus and Lita rivalry
-The show opened with a 6 person intergender match up featuring the Hardyz and Lita against Test, Albert and Trish in a very GOOD opener which got the crowd PUMPED.TnA takes most of the control in this match by throwing The Hardyz around in and out of the ring, but The Hardyz do make a few come backs with the advantage of speed and charisma. Lita puts on a nice performance aswell.
-Mick Foley & Edge promo ""Christians got food poison""
-Undertake rides his bike in the arena and spots angle (funny face) and chases him to the locker room.
-Tazz vs Alsnow was nothing special at all. I really think this match should have been NO DQ as alsnow was WWF Hardcore Champion and Tazz was made famous in ECW by being Hardcore.
-Edge and Christian promo "" Dr checks out Christian""
-HHH & Stephanie promo
-European gold is on the line when Eddie Guerrero takes on Perry Saturn. Now this could have been a great match as these 2 stars know each other well. Saturn walks out with a weird look on his face, but they get into it, i rekon it could have been faster but still a nice effort with a not great ending.
-Edge and Christian and Mick foley promo ""Totally Busted"" it was a funny shoot.
-Undertaker interview
-Edge and Christian vs Aqualites for the WWF tag team championship. Edge and Christain are 1st in the ring and start knocking Dallas but The Aqualtes soon run in and Bradshaw stands up for his people in a powerful confrontation and Bradshaw was pumped in his home state. Starts off with brawling, the match it self was average and ending was pathetic. I know it is Edge and Christian style ending but they should have done it on a Raw or Smackdown not a PPV.
-Bossman in WWF New York
-Stephanie and HHH promo
-Kurt Angle attacks Undertaker with a wrench
-Steel cage match for the Intercontinental Championship featured Rikishi against Val Venis in a below average cage match with an above average ending. The match was nothing special but the ending was as we thought we would see Val Venis do a money shot off the cage, we see a 424 pound Rikishi do a splash off the cage. If you want to see a classic cage match check out Summerslam 1997 and Summerslam 1994

A brawl at first where Undertaker controls the flow of the match but Angle makes a come back to the injured leg of the Undertaker and just focuses on the leg making it a dissapionting main event.
-HHH and Jericho's heavy rivalry
-HHH vs Chris Jericho in a last man standing match makes this the most awaited main event of the three. This was only the 2nd last man standing match in WWF history and will be remembered. I wouldnt quite call this match brutal but was deffanatly INTENSE as there are alot of submission hold at first by HHH, slowing the pace down until Jericho turns it up a notch by slamming a steel chair over HHH causing him to wear the crimson mask for a while. At one point Stephanie gets a taste of the walls of jericho. The ending was cool which involved a backdrop from the time keepers table through the Spanish anouncers table. This was the best match of the PPV also a match of the year candidate and proves Jericho is now a main eventer.
-Rock & Benoit's heated rivalry
The Rock puts his WWF championship on the line to show Benoit a thing or two about how the big boys play, well Benoit shore proved Rocky wrong. The match did have some slow points and could have been better but still a decent outing none the less. Benoit did come out with Shane so yes there were alot of interuptions and 1 of them nearly cost The rock the gold as referee Hebner mistaken Shane as the rock for smacking him with a chair and called it a DQ.But foley comes out and orders the match to continue and the Dallas crowd loves it as The Rock retained the WWF World Championship.

All in all this was a decent WWF outing that could have been better, it was in other words a PPV that didn't live up to its hype but featured a few good matches such as the last man standing match. Rock and Benoit was too Hyped up and couldn't beat it but like i said it was a decent bout. If you are a WWF collector get this one, if you are a Jericho or HHH fan you should get this but if you are just looking to buy a WWF tape there are better so search around a bit more.",1013990400,,4808,4.325581395348837

The Hardy Boyz and Lita vs Trish Stratus and T&A
Great opening match, but it was then booked two weeks later on Heat, and that really diminished the credibility of the card.
6 out of 10
Now, the next two matches I don't remember the order because I was up at the concession stands but I did watch them on the monitor.  They remind me of Rock Bottom, the WWF pay per view in Dec. of 1998.  It was a pay per view that had a lot of unhyped and television-type quality.  These matches were not pay per view quality!
WWF EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP
Eddie Gurerro (C) vs Perry Saturn
Eddie lost, and that is always good

Taz(z) vs Al Snow
It is an Al Snow match.  The Jerry Lawler vs. Taz(z) match was more interesting.  Don't get me wrong, I love Al Snow, but this was a match that someone just pulled out of the air one day.
3 out of 10
WWF TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP
Edge and Christian (C) vs APA
OH MY GOSH!  This was a total waste of time.  I would have rather seen the Al Snow match and gone to the concession stands during this match.  The hated champions get themselves disqualified so they can keep their championships.  I realize that the WWF was saving them for the next ppv, but why would you book the match then?  This match was a match that WCW would be embarrassed to air.

WWF INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP
CAGE MATCH
Val Venis (C) vs Rikishi
2ND BEST MATCH OF THE NIGHT.  Excellent match, especially the big bump from the 480 pound Rikishi when he jumped off the top of the cage.  The only bad part was the ending.  It ended when Taz(z) came down and hit Rikishi with a big camera when he was about to win.  This match ended in typical WWF fashion and a feud that went no where.
8 out of 10
TRIPLE MAIN EVENT
The Undertaker vs Kurt Angle
Well, at least Angle lost.  His biggest offensive move was that deadly and dreaded knee lock!  I know, you are so horrified.  If you would have blinked, you would have missed the match.  Undertaker did hit the last ride and the chokeslam, and Angle did act like an idiot, so all was good.  The worst thing was the fact that they had a rematch the next night on Raw.
6 out of 10
LAST MAN STANDING MATCH
Triple H vs Chris Jericho
AMAZING MATCH!  One of HHH's best (as well as Y2J's). I would rank it right up with the matches against Cactus Jack and Stone Cold Steve Austin (at No Way Out 2001). Seeing Steph put in the walls of Jericho was cool, as well as all the blood.  Those men gave their souls that night, and the crowd loved it.  It is without a doubt the greatest match that I have ever witnessed live.
10 out of 10
WWF CHAMPIONSHIP
The Rock (C) vs Chris Benoit
A very hyped match that was meaningless the next night on Raw.  It was a good match until The Rock used the Sharpshooter.  THAT IS BRET HART'S MOVE!!!!  He also used the crippler crossface way too much.  Frankly, the only good part of the match was when Foley came out because it is always cool to see Foley and it would be my last time to see him in person.  It ended with The Rock winning and leaving about 2 minutes after Benoit and didn't even get pops from the crowd.  Foley stayed longer.
Overall, the PPV was pretty good.  The HHH vs Y2J match stole the show and could be considered the best match of 2000.  Buy it if you like good wrestling.",1010275200,2,3569,4.133526850507983

7892969,5,6305710465,"1.) T&A and Trish Stratus vs Team Xtreme (The Hardy Boyz and Lita)

This match seemed to be happening more due to the on-going heated feud between Lita and Trish than anything involving The Hardyz and T&A. But it all made for good story-telling and a good opening match, nonetheless. In my opinion, the highlight of this match was Lita suplexing Trish off the top turnbuckle. For 2 girls who were still in the beginning stages in their career, it was certainly a nice move to see. Lita pins Trish with a Moonsault for the win. Team Xtreme get jumped afterwards and Lita sufferers some nasty welt-producing belt whips. Nice match to see the women and the men mixing it up with each other

3.) WWF European Championship Match: Eddie Guerrero (c) w/Chyna vs Perry Saturn w/Terri

Two former Radicalz members and WCW superstars battling it out for the European title, meaning it's time for a great technical and athletic match. Saturn and Eddie make the best out of the few minutes they're given here and provide an excellent technical brawl. Saturn ends up hitting a diving elbow drop on Eddie to win the European Championship. I always kind of liked Saturn. WWE should've used him better in the company

4.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: Edge and Christian (c) vs The Acolytes

After pre-match promos from both teams, a decent Tag Team Championship match is underway. It's a short one and wish it had gone on a bit longer. Edge hits Bradshaw with a championship to get the DQ but Edge and Christian get beat up afterwards

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Steel Cage Match: Rikishi vs Val Venis (c) w/Trish Stratus

This was an awesome one folks. One of the lesser known brutal Cage matches to be honest. Rikishi and Venis cook up what can probably be considered an underrated classic from the Attitude Era. This match will always be known for Rikishi taking his 15 foot high Superfly Splash off the cage onto Venis. Lita interferes and whips Trish to the back with a belt of her own and not too long after, Tazz interferes and attacks the Kish with a camera, allowing Venis to retain the title

6.) Kurt Angle vs The Undertaker

Decent match for the most part. I loved the build-up for the match though. After chasing Angle down with his motocycle, Angle sent Taker on a wild chase backstage that ended with Angle jumping Taker with a monkey wrench. Angle works over Taker's knee for most of the match. Taker comes through with the Last Ride on Angle for the win. I think their rematch at Survivor Series later that year was a bit better than this one. But as mentioned, the booking was fantastic.

7.) Last Man Standing Match: Triple H w/Stephanie McMahon vs Chris Jericho

As J.R. would say, this match got bowling shoe ugly! Speaking of J.R., hearing he and Jerry's conversations with each other during this match is hilarity at its best. I loved these two on commentary back in the day. This match got mega-macho brutal---and bloody in a hurry. This match is easily one of the best of both Jericho and Hunter's careers, as both display a great, athletic match throughout. Triple H bleeds a great deal midway through this match and the ending to the match was a clever one to give the feud a proper ending without anyone looking truly stronger over the other. Triple H and Jericho would go on to have another PPV classic in their 2002 Hell In A Cell bout

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

9.) WWF Championship Match: Chris Benoit vs The Rock (c)

Awesome main event to close the show! Nothing like a great technical wrestling match to close the show. And while this was no Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart, it still delivered and both Benoit and Rock did not disappoint to put fort a great match to close out a spectacular night. After a controversial ending, the match is restarted and keeps going until The Rock slams Benoit with a Rock Bottom for the win

Overall: Amazing! Not enough words can describe how fascinating this PPV was. In the 3 years Fully Loaded was a PPV, this was by far the best one yet. Marvelous undercard/mid-card matches, followed by the ""Triple Main Event"" with the Angle/Undertaker, HHH/Jericho, and Benoit/Rock matches. The only thing that would've made this PPV even better than it already was an appearance from Stone Cold Steve Austin, who's face was on the promotional poster for this PPV.

7892970,5,6305710465,"Fully Loaded 2000 is one of those events that doesn't really get mentioned much which is a shame considering that this was one of the best events from 2000 with some standout matches that have not been released onto to DVD or have been forgotten about over the last few years. For those don't remember, the main feud here was between WWF Champion The Rock & Chris Benoit who along with Shane McMahon pushed this match to be more than just the title. Speaking of personal issues, the Chris Jericho feud with Triple H started to get intense here in a match that you really need to see.

Hardy Boyz & Lita vs Test, Albert & Trish Stratus. This was during the time that Trish was just hired in the WWF for her looks than her wrestling ability but for those history fans, this was the beginning of the Trish/Lita feud. Anyways, this was an exciting opener with the Hardys using their speed & quickness to combat the power of Test & Albert but the real highlight was the interaction between Trish & Lita as even though Trish wasn't the performer she would become later on, she did just enough while Lita was just on fire with her offense. Moments include the triple vertical suplex along with the aftermath showing that Lita won the battle but not the war.

Tazz vs Al Snow. This was Tazz's return match from injury as throughout the weeks he had been attacking random superstars & the most recent was Al Snow. Snow came into this match with a more serious approach & brought the fight to Tazz while Tazz regained control with his different set of suplexes. This was a good match overall.

WWF European Champion Eddie Guerrero vs Perry Saturn. The issue here was between Chyna & Terri based off what happened on the previous SmackDown that actually lead to Saturn putting Chyna through the Spanish announce table. Besides that, this was just another good match that was better than the previous match but again was nothing special or memorable past that.

WWF Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian vs Acoltyes. Throughout the night, Edge & Christian were being their entertaining selfs to get out of this match that even lead to them cutting a hilarious promo attacking the fans in Texas that even brought Bradshaw to shoot a promo himself. However for all the build-up, this was easily a forgettable match as it just continued to tell the story of Edge & Christian being the cowardly champions.

Steel Cage Match: Intercontinental Champion Val Venis vs Rikishi. These two picked up right where they left off from the previous match at the King of the Ring as both men were more aggressive than usual with Val getting busted open at one point. Trish did become a factor in the match but she was given a receipt for what had happened to Lita earlier in the night but the real highlight here was Rikishi's dive off the top of the steel cage right on top of Venis that was really something. Good match by cage match standards with the other story being Tazz once again costing Rikishi the title in the end.

The Undertaker vs Kurt Angle. The first of the three main events but unfortunately this match was not give the proper build-up that it deserved as Kurt at this time was still portrayed as a cowardly heel. This was one of those matches that was good for what it was but Taker & Angle would gone on to have classic matches right after this including a couple of months later at the Survivor Series. It was mostly a brawl as Taker attacked Angle during his entrance with Kurt working on Taker's leg at one point before being overpowered by Taker.

Last Man Standing Match: Triple H vs Chris Jericho. This was the match that pushed Jericho into the main event picture while at the same time, showed how primed Triple H was in 2000. Both of these men are great workers as they gave it everything they had & beat the hell out of each other with Triple H being a bloody mess at one point with a steel chair being used for impactful moves. With Stephanie getting involved in the action a couple of times along with a sick table spot, this was the first main event of the night that actually lived up to the hype that it had going into this match.

WWF Champion The Rock vs Chris Benoit w/Shane McMahon. Due to The Rock's actions on the previous RAW, Mick Foley added a stipulation to this match in which The Rock would lose his title if he got disqualified. I would call this a lost classic as this was one of The Rock's most unique performances as Benoit brought out the stiff wrestling side out of him that we hadn't seen in quite some time while Benoit was more aggressive here than I can remember in previous matches. With Shane McMahon constantly interfering & even a ""dusty"" finish involving Mick Foley, this was an awesome wrestling match & one of The Rock's best matches throughout his whole career.

Overall, this was one of the best shows from 2000 as two out of three main events lived up to the hype with each match (besides the tag title match) delivering in some way as well as a hot crowd to go with the action so I would highly recommend.",1210550400,,5043,4.4728260869565215

It's not perfect; but sometimes pacing and energy are all you need to forget the missteps.  I'm psyched to type about this, so here's what we got:

1) T&A and Trish Stratus v. The Hardy Boyz & Lita
---There are few openers better than this 6-person Tag Team Match.  It clocks in at about 15 minutes, and the crowd was at an unbelievable fever pitch.  The physicality is stiff, the women don't resort to catfight tactics, and the action just never stops.  A textbook definition of how to get a show started!  (8.0 / 10)

2) Tazz v. Al Snow
---FULLY LOADED loses a bit of steam, starting with this one.  I think fans' expectations were high because both of these guys were ECW veterans.  It's really not as bad as some say, because Snow & Tazz are working their butts off to put on a good show.  But Snow & Tazz don't make us care as much as we want to.  (5.5 / 10)

3) European Title - Eddie Guerrero (champion) v. Perry Saturn
---Considering these guys have worked in Japan, ECW, and WCW...they should've done better than this.  When they go fast, moves are botched and it takes us out of it.  When they go slow, it's not slow in a good way.  Not a terrible match, but very disappointing by Saturn & Guerrero standards.  (5.5 / 10)

4) Tag Team Titles - Edge & Christian (champions) v. The Acolytes
---Easily the worst match on the PPV.  The Canadian champs always knew how to get a crowd to hate them, but Faarooq & Bradshaw were better characters than they were wrestlers.  Frankly, this one doesn't deliver.  Don't get me started on the cheap finish, either.  But have no fear, the PPV is going to get much better from here.  (4.0 / 10)

5) Steel Cage Match for Intercontinental Title - Rikishi v. Val Venis (champion)
---The Samoan Butt Man in a Steel Cage?!  You read it right, and the bout is more brutal and entertaining than any review could explain.  It's fast-paced and stiff.  Venis and Rikishi had a good match at KING OF THE RING, but it's got nothing on this one.  To top it off, Rikishi performs a high-risk move that will make you gasp!  I don't wanna give it away (though other reviewers have), but you won't believe it.  Overall, surprisingly one of the year's better PPV matches.  (8.0 / 10)

6) Kurt Angle v. The Undertaker
---FULLY LOADED 2000 advertised a Triple Main Event, which starts here.  To be honest, this one's hard to call.  On the positive side, the match features some good counters and brawling from the two rivals.  However, the downside is that Taker and Angle went on to have masterpieces in the years since.  Forget ""years since"" --- their SURVIVOR SERIES 2000 contest wipes the floor with this one.  Plus, the WWF would make Angle a superstar one month, and then embarrass him the next.  Talk about a weird character development.  This Angle/Taker encounter is pretty solid, but time hasn't been kind to it.  (6,5 / 10)

7) Last Man Standing Match - Triple H v. Chris Jericho
---This ""WWF BEST OF 2000"" entry is arguably the greatest Last Man Standing Match of them all.  There's really not much else to say, other than Y2J & HHH were never in better physical shape than they were tonight.  Seriously, these guys just beat the crap out of each other, and then some.  Anyone who thinks Triple H does nothing but ""use his political power"" better watch this one to find out why earned it.  Weapons, physical wrestling, blood, Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, Spanish table......it's all here for out sadistic enjoyment!  (8.5 / 10)

8) WWF Championship - Chris Benoit v. The Rock
---Let me first admit this: I hated The Rock in the year 2000.  When he first became a face, I his matches' quality suffered.  He barely had any creative offense or storytelling; might as well have put bright red 'S' on his chest.  Now that I got that rant out of the way, this main event is a masterpiece!  Rock and Benoit were perfect opponents, and I wish they squared off more.  Rock is forced to compete in a technical match, which is a treat for anybody to watch --- he's really entertaining when he throws in some old-school grappling.  Benoit was as tough & aggressive a competitor as anybody.  I would probably call this his first WWF/WWE classic, even though he'd already entertained me plenty before.  Throw in a ""Rock-Loses-Title-If-DQ'ed"" stipulation, and you've got the only reason needed to buy this videotape.  (9.0 / 10)

OVERALL
---WWF FULLY LOADED 2000 never got a DVD release, and it probably never will.  Unfortunately, the Benoit murder/suicide jeopardizes the main event from ever being re-released.  HHH/Jericho is available on the ""THAT DAMN GOOD"" DVD, but that's it.  Every other match is only on this tape, and if you pass it up, you're missing a awesome Tag opener & Cage match.  WWF FULLY LOADED 2000 has some of the year's best matches, and remains the year's best overall PPV.",1210204800,2,4955,4.5436013590033975

Intergender Tag Match

Hardyz and Lita vs. Test, Albert and Trish Stratus - Thought this match was going to be bad but it was brilliant! You get everything in this match high flying, power moves and women going at it, although Trish couldn't really wrestle at this point she does really well with Lita and this turns out to be a cool match. 9/10

Al Snow vs. Tazz - Just a filler match and wasn't really that good. Both have been in better matches, they should have made this a hardcore match which both could have done better in. 4/10

European Title

Eddie Guerrero (c) w/ Chyna vs. Perry Saturn w/ Terri - Good technical match from both guys but bit with Chyna being clotheslined through the table looks awful and sort of spoils the match. Besides that this match went well and shows how Saturn should have got more of a push. 7/10

Tag Team Titles

Edge and Christian (c) vs. APA - Good promos at beginning of this match really heating up crowd but the match just doesnt deliver the excitement. Ok action but this match just went too quickly and the ending just made it worse. 5/10

Steel Cage for Intercontinental Title

Val Venis (c) w/ Trish Stratus vs. Rikishi - Your typical steel cage match most of the way through with blood and running into the cage. The thing that sets it apart from the rest is you have the 400 pound Rikishi jumping off the cage onto Venis WOW! 8/10

Kurt Angle vs. The Undertaker - I thought this match would be excellent but it wasnt. Very poor hardly any wrestling just a few holds then some punches, more holds, punches THEN a chokeslam - last ride FINISH! 3/10

Last Man Standing

Triple H w/ Stephanie vs. Y2J - BRILLIANT! Match of the night with blood and an arrogant HHH beating the crap out of Y2J at the beginning,this is before Y2J making a massive comeback busting HHH wide open. Not the match of the year like some people said (that is HHH vs. Cactus at the rumble) but is certainly one of the best, this is Y2J's first major push to the main events. 10/10

WWE Title

The Rock (c) vs. Chris Benoit w/ Shane McMahon - Not the match of the night but still good. Lots of holds and wrestling moves with Rock showing he can wrestle good matches, Benoit at his best makes this a excellent Title match with a good twist at the end. 9/10

One of the good PPV's in 2000 and makes the ones today look poor, the two great matches at the end make Fully Loaded worth buying.",1124323200,,2548,4.323529411764706

Steel Cage Match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship:
Val Venis (Champion) V. Rikishi

Kurt Angle V. Undertaker
This match was a disappointment. Taker dominates Angle. However, Angle did get some good shots in. Taker wins. ***. Yes only 3 stars. Their match at the 2000 Surivor Series was alot better.

Last Man Standing Match:
Triple H V. Chris Jericho
Somewhat disappointing but still awesome. I have been told that this match was simply amazing so when I watched it, I thought that people overhyped it. It's still great with Triple H winning. ****

WWF Championship:

YES!....Benoit is the WWF Champion!...YES...wait a minute. Damn Mick Foley! Awesome match with a Dusty ending and restart and the Rock retaining. ****1/2

Hardy Boyz & Lita vs. T&A & Trish

This is well before Trish became a decent women's wrestler.  Fast pace with some great spots.  Not a single boring moment.  The crowd was hot for the rest of the night.

Tazz vs. Al Snow

The WWF tried to repackage Tazz as he was in ECW and this match was his ""coming out"" of sorts.  Decent match and kept to a good length.

European Championship

Eddie Guerrero vs. Perry Saturn

Saturn never got his respect in the wwf.  He was a great performer and this match is too.  Lots of action.  Only skidmark is having Chyna and Terri go at it.  No one seemed to care much about that.

Tag Team Championship

Edge & Christian vs. Acolytes

There was great heat going into this.  Christian made some really inappropriate comments about JFK,(this was in Dallas).  Bradshaw, looking pretty sloppy in his pre-JBL days, cuts what feels like a shoot promo and from there it just doesn't stop.

Steel Cage Match for the Intercontinental Championship

Val Venis vs. Rikishi

Ok match but just sit through it until the ending!! That make up for it.

Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle

The WWF realized they needed to groom more main eventers and this is just the beginning of Angle's career really.  You can see some bright spots of future greatness here.  Great build up and some funny moments from Angle.

Last Man Standing Match

Triple H vs. Chris Jericho

Wow! Look at Trips now and tell me he isn't a bit chubbier.  This is when his character was fresh and a real bad ass.  Lots of intensity here.  Match of the year candidate.

WWF Championship

The Rock vs. Chris Benoit

Oh if only the Rock could've wrestled like this all the time!  Some flashes of greatness from Benoit too.  Great match, hold/counterhold and great finish cap a 5 star ppv.",1104969600,,1849,4.521341463414634
