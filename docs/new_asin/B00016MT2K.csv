With this new DVD, even my wife and kids can experience the thrill of the best Anime series ever made.  Since my family members do not speak Japanese, they can watch with English subtitles.  (And I don't have to spend my time translating every word).  I do wish that the subtitled translation were more literal and that the English voiceover sounded differently. (The voiceover sounds horrible)  But, all I really care about is the ability to watch this classic piece of anime.",1358985600,2,616,4.554545454545455
8007276,5,B00016MT2K,"I love this series!! ^_^ It's really cool! I just think it's awesome! However, one thing to say. You should buy the one that says, ""Saint Seiya"", NOT the dubbed American one which goes by the title of ""Knights of the Zodiac"". The reason I say that is because that's closer to the original series, probably at least. ^_^

Bseides, you get lots of cool extras on the Saint Seiya DVDs. ^_^ Also, if you like old anime, like, Ronin Warriors, you'll love this.",1167955200,,455,4.416666666666667
