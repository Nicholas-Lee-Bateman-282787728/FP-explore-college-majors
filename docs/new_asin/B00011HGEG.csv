1964814,5,B00011HGEG,"There is a special intimacy & fineness to things made with love. This video is an unexpectedly tender love-valentine. Rob & Lisi made it for their baby boy because they loved him. They wanted to share things he loved -- menorahs and alephs and his baby friends -- with music he loved, at a pace which he could absorb. The songs are also born in love. The music is three sisters singing, as they have sung together all their lives.

""Well, I learned not to take all the babies to the video-shoot at once,"" said Rob afterward, laughing. ""Three or four at a time is plenty.""

The imagery alone is lovely. I have given two copies to Christian friends, just because its pace is so baby-perfect; think ""Sesame Street from the Rebbe."" But the soundtrack is what lifts it to the divine. These three women's voices ARE a temple. Showered in their harmonies, watching the beautiful sacred things unfold at baby pace, one is healed.

""Sparking a lifetime of Jewish wonderment through sight and song,"" say Rob & Lisi ([...] Wonder is the right word.

A great gift for Hanukkah or birthday. Made for Jewish babies, engaging for all.",1099872000,5,1119,4.608040201005025
1964815,5,B00011HGEG,This DVD is a wonderful addition for a Jewish household. My young kids love it and I really appreciate the Jewish content and music. I'd much rather add a little culture to their TV viewing. Its incredibly well done! I *highly* recommend this DVD and the CD as well for car rides.,1099872000,5,280,4.403846153846154

8005082,5,B00011HGEG,I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this DVD. My daughter loves it and asks to watch it 6-8 times a day. I only wish there were more DVDs in this series. (More for my sake than my daughters. I know the whole DVD by heart!) We just ordered the second one and are looking for more shows like this one. I would absolutely recommend it!,1441324800,,345,4.088235294117647
8005083,5,B00011HGEG,LOVE IT and awesome memories w grandparents and parents watching. beautiful and lifechanging music. All the songs I grew up with and more.,1420502400,,138,5.043478260869565
8005084,5,B00011HGEG,"I bought this for my daughter before the age of 1 she is now 2 and still loves this DVD, she sings along to the blessings & songs, and tries to follow the Hebrew alef bet and other Hebrew words. I normally have this playing on preparation day for Shabbat.",1414972800,,255,4.12
8005085,5,B00011HGEG,"This is a wonderful DVD that my 17-month-old toddler loves dancing to. He tries to sing along and repeat the Hebrew letters and colors between the songs. The music is beautiful and catchy, and the scenes are very well done to keep the attentions of little ones. My favorites are the puppets. I find myself listening the the Oy Baby! CD in my car even when I am driving alone.",1268092800,,375,4.371428571428571
8005086,5,B00011HGEG,"Must buy all of these DVDS!!!!  I never write reviews but I have to say that as a mom, I never get sick of watching all of their DVDs and believe me, we've watched them over and over and over again.  Each time we put it on, my now 20 month old gets so excited - especially when he hears Dayenu.  It's a great present for new parents as well . ..  I just wish they'd make more!",1249516800,,376,3.782051282051282
8005087,5,B00011HGEG,"I think the only negative thing that I can say about this video is that OyBaby2 is even better.  The songs are all great, the graphics are nice (be aware, they're not high-tech as this is clearly a fairly low-budget production, but that doesn't diminish them at all), the kids are all adorable, and the puppets are the best.

I especially liked that it wasn't the least bit ""preachy"" about Judaism. Sure, it's all about Judaism, Jews, and Judaica (it IS called OyBaby after all), but it never even comes close to saying that anything is right or wrong; it just sings songs, shows the Hebrew alphabet, etc.

We got it for our son when he was about 1 and he loved it; he still enjoys it at 2 and my wife and I both like the songs so we suspect he won't get bored anytime soon; OyBaby2, however, is probably better for a child a tiny bit older than this one (say, for a child one and a half or older).

I'm sure your little one (and you) will enjoy this as much as ours did.",1181520000,,971,4.176470588235294
8005088,5,B00011HGEG,"My son Noah loves this dvd. He is just a little over one and is mesmerized by the singing, the puppets and the nature imagery. I absolutely love the music in it. We have a lot of non-Jews in our lives and they all love it as well. Everyone that has come in contact with it has been very impressed. The music really makes the whole thing. I stumbled across it on accident and I am so happy for this wonderful discovery! I can't wait to hear Noah singing ""Dayenu"" at Passover in a year or two and it will because of 'Oybaby.'",1171843200,,523,4.087378640776699
8005089,4,B00011HGEG,This is a fun product and highlights some basics in Hebrew and Jewish traditions. I often turn the DVD on in the background without the video so we can listen to the songs while playing.,1168387200,,186,4.3428571428571425
8005090,5,B00011HGEG,"I bought this for my 1 year old because we wanted a Jewish alternative to all of the 'Baby Einstein'-type videos that are on the market.  We love that the songs are all well-known Jewish songs, and the video includes blessings and Hebrew numbers and letters.  The production values are great, and my toddler loves the music and the imagery.  He claps his hands during his favorite songs and studies the puppets and children with rapt attention.  I absolutely recommend this for Jewish parents looking for a baby video that provides Jewish culture while also entertaining baby.",1107648000,4,576,4.907216494845361
