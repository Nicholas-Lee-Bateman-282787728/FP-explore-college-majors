8069581,4,B0009XFV2A,"This is a very low cost compilation of episodes from four adventure series of the 1950s from PC/DVD Treasures, a company specializing in inexpensive releases of public domain material.  The DVD is packaged in a cardboard box, so you might want to buy a more durable case for long-term storage purposes.

This compilation is a little unique in that two of the four series were produced outside of the United States.  ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" was produced in England and was broadcast on CBS from 1955-58.  The episode included, ""Queen Eleanor,"" is from the series' first season; there are a few digital blips that mar an otherwise good looking episode.  ""The Adventures of Long John Silver"" was the very first television series to be produced in Australia and was filmed in color, making it one of the very few series from the 1950s to have been filmed in color.  The episode included is in good shape and the color is fair for a 50 year old series.  Although set in Africa, ""Ramar of the Jungle,"" was produced in studio jungles, and included some authentic African (and later, Indian) wildlife footage.  The episode included is fairly typical of the series and those who want more ""Ramar"" will find that 40 episodes of this series have been released by Alpha Video (available from Amazon).  Rounding out the disc is the early Brian Donlevy foreign intrigue series ""Dangerous Assignment"" that sees agent Steve Mitchell (Donlevy) traveling around the world on his various assignments . . . in the episode included here, to the Alps.

""TV Compilations: Adventure & Intrigue"" will appeal to those who enjoy classic/vintage television shows from the 1950s, especially those of the action/adventure variety.  The visual quality is reasonably good for these old shows and the price is right.",1119571200,3,1790,4.933333333333334
