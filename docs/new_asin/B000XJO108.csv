8228712,2,B000XJO108,I was interested in Borobudur because (1) I have been there and (2) knew the Dutch family that restored it from jungle ruin. The movie narrative lacked both the history of Buddhism replaced by Islam in Indonesia and the history of its restoration. The movie was very short. The images and brief narrative were excellent.,1336003200,,320,4.836363636363636
