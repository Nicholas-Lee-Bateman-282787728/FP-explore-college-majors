8039949,4,B00067TVDY,"This 1993 flick (featuring a much younger Ron Perlman) has a good bit to offer. Mysterious live-forever gadget with dark secret, unseen conspiracy to acquire same at any cost, and a creepy little girl. Really, Aurora could give Wednesday Addams some pointers.

It moves along well, but I'm not sure why that vampire-like bit was thrown in. Popcornworthy, but not memorable.

Nice extras but the Bleak House is on the Criterion Collection edition with the three-color ""Cronos"" device on the front cover.",1388707200,6,256,4.976744186046512
