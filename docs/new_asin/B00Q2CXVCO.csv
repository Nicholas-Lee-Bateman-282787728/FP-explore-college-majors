6853238,2,B00Q2CXVCO,It's a short (I think 26 minutes is being generous) travel promotional film on Paris. I was thinking there might be a bit a more of a documentary aspect to this. You could have downloaded something like this and saved yourself the money.,1445126400,,237,4.534883720930233

6853240,3,B00Q2CXVCO,"nothing more than a travelogue promoting tourism; although in the case of Paris, that is not a bad thing at all.

It is indeed a magnificent European capitol, but as with all things touched by modernity and globalism, there are drawbacks; although in the case of Paris, these shortcomings are only minor trivialities and would not be un-expected by any tourist, especially if they are already from another large city such as London or New York.

As with any large city, it is best to go once and mrs ore less, get your bearings; but having done that, you must go back at least a second time.

The French are said to be impolite, haughty and rude; well, that's what they say about  NY'ers and for the most part I personally found the Parisian temperament and attitudes to be very welcoming and familiar.
For the most part, I found most Parisians to be quite helpful and very accommodating; of course it does help being originally from New York, born and bred for most of my life. It seems that people who are infused from the time of inception with that indescribable urban collective consciousness
would do well in any major city.

Having said that, Paris truly is one of the world's most beautiful cities; having been spared the dreadful bombings of WWIIl; it is a city of architectural splendor and cultural sophistication that is legendary.

Once you get over the disappointment of the Champs-lyses being turned into a way overcrowded tourist destination, just get it out of your system and boldly go exploring on your own. don't depend on following the crowds or tourist guides; if you do that, you may as well stay home and watch a travelogue program on cable and save yourself the airfare and hotel/motel expenses.

there is a small and incredible patisserie near the Eiffel Tower, the name and address I don't remember.
I remember just enough to know that if it's still there when I go back, I will find it.

Even in Paris there are patisseries and then there are patisseries; some are God awful, others strictly commercial and there are some that are exemplary old school wonders. Explore, explore, explore. Use your God given feet and learn the bus and train system.",1438905600,,2175,4.705263157894737

8690077,5,B00Q2CXVCO,I plan on visiting Paris next year for vacation with my roomate and it was great to see all the places I could go. I went to Paris over 10 years ago and only went to three of the places on this video. I plan on watching it again when the time comes so I can do more research on it.
