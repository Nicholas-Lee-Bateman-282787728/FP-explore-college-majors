2193491,5,B0006SCQDA,Great Work-out!  I loved the performances and I learned some new great moves!  Highly recommend this dvd!,1137456000,3,105,5.117647058823529
2193492,2,B0006SCQDA,"I'm sure this was a fun video in its time, but the moves are just too 80's.",1127520000,15,75,3.4705882352941178
2193493,5,B0006SCQDA,"I recently bought this video for my son for Hanukkah, and am so happy I did.  Every day when he gets home from school he puts in the tape, and will play it over and over.  He loves this movie so much, that he recently asked me to purchase it for his cousin!  I reccomend every parent buy this tape for their young ones if they love to dance.",1102550400,3,341,3.9130434782608696
2193494,5,B0006SCQDA,So glad I ordered early!! My tape just arrived and I can't believe it.  I've already owned the first dvd and this isn't even comparable.  This dvd has much more instruction and goes form the lowest levels for litte children up to breakin and advanced steps.  The crew is much better and this was clearly directed for learning as well as a fun watch. It's worth every penny!!!!,1101600000,8,376,4.5
8042615,2,B0006SCQDA,So sad. They did great moves but I myself was not interested in rewinding it over and over. Just show down the moves. Perhaps they should've done the preforming afterwards instead of in between the teaching off and on. I just wanted to get to learning but everyone has a different learning style. I particularly didn't like how fast they taught. If you don't allow time break down the moves for beginners then maybe it's more for entertainment purposes and the instructional part is not very beneficial. One star for the teaching effort plus one more for the entertainment.,1441152000,,573,4.797979797979798
8042616,5,B0006SCQDA,My 7 year old daughter loves Roger G. videos. Him and the kids does an excellent job on breaking down the moves. It is a video that a child will have to watch over and over to understand and learn the technique of Break dancing.  My daughter has gained a lot of confidence in her break dancing from this video. She also uses the choreography to teach her friends how to do it,1440892800,,375,4.136986301369863
8042617,4,B0006SCQDA,ok,1412812800,,2,2.0
8042618,1,B0006SCQDA,Crap!!! Is not a well put together video..no way a child could learn a thing from it!,1409788800,,85,4.0588235294117645
8042619,1,B0006SCQDA,"It's poorly put together and doesnt walk through the steps very well. Don't waste your money, time or thoughts on this",1395878400,,118,4.666666666666667
8042620,1,B0006SCQDA,please don't waiste ur money this movie is nothing but some older kids i guess dancing in baggy clothes whats that about anyways it waiste have the time with streching not fun better of gettin hghschool musical or something like that,1382140800,,233,4.7073170731707314
8042621,2,B0006SCQDA,I was really looking for a video to help my 5 year old by learn some simple break dancing moves. All he wants to be right now is a B-Boy. Unfortunately I have not been able to find anything that is basic enough for him to follow along.,1377993600,,235,3.9166666666666665
8042622,1,B0006SCQDA,"This DVD is not designed for children or even me for that matter.  The initial stretching sequence wasn't too bad, but when we got to the Beginning Pop and Lock section, there was no break-down of the moves that would allow us to learn, step-by-step.  Neither my son nor I could follow it at all.

If we wanted to use the dvd effectively, we would have had to continuously stop, rewind, and start it.  A good instructional dvd is designed so you don't need to do this.  ""Hip Hop for Kids: Pop! Lock! and Break!"" is not a good instructional dvd.  I'm glad I only checked it out from the library so I didn't have to waste my money.",1314576000,,629,4.243697478991597
8042623,2,B0006SCQDA,"This video was fun to watch, but as a how-to video, it's terrible.

The moves are never broken down; in most cases, they aren't even SLOWED down.  The camera often moves so close to the lead dancer that he's blurry.  Even when he's in focus, sometimes you can't see his whole body (to see, for instance, what his feet are doing).  On occasion, they don't even show you the current dancers at all!

Each section has a ""fancy"" intro, with one or two of the dancers doing some more advanced hip hop dancing.  It's fun, but it takes up a lot of time, overall, that I would rather not be wasting during workout time.  Once or twice, they played these same segments during the workout itself (so I, as the viewer, couldn't see what I should be doing), or used the same style IN a segment so that I didn't realize until afterward that we were back to the lessons.

It was enjoyable - I especially appreciated how each of the dancers had a visibly distinct style - but I'll be finding something else to use for learning.",1304380800,4,1012,4.345744680851064
8042624,1,B0006SCQDA,"I am so sorry I wasted my money on this DVD.  I was hoping my kids could get some exercise and have fun learning the dance moves.  They never teach the moves.  They are just dancing in front of you calling out steps.  The quality is poor, too.  The camera will focus in on a move and then jump frames into a totally unrelated dance and then back again.  It was just horrible.  What a disappointment.",1165968000,42,399,4.171052631578948
