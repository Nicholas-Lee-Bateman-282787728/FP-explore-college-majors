7999549,5,B0000CNY52,This is a very entertaining film. I saw it under the title Death Force. JK was as beautiful as ever. Leon played a creepy villain in this film. A must see for all JK fans.,1525046400,,171,3.914285714285714

7999551,5,B0000CNY52,"I enjoyed it very much. I love the movies from the seventies, seeing how people dressed back then. I have seen other James Iglehart movies, I thought it was one of his  best.",1426636800,,174,4.2727272727272725
7999552,2,B0000CNY52,This one is not the Peter Fonda movie.  Very disappointed by the misleading representation.,1411171200,,91,5.5
7999553,4,B0000CNY52,"FIGHTING MAD (aka: DEATH FORCE) concerns a trio of Viet Nam vets who smuggle a fortune in gold back to the States. After selling it, they set off for the high life. Unfortunately, two of the ""friends"" betray the third man named Doug Russell. They stab him and dump him into the ocean. Miraculously, Russell survives and washes up on the shore of an uncharted island. Doubly miraculously, it is inhabited by Japanese soldiers who don't know WW2 has been over for decades! Back home, Russell's two ""friends"" are muscling in on Russell's turf, torching his businesses, and killing his business associates (aka: mob types). Luckily, the soldiers train Russell in the art of combat, especially combat involving karate and the samurai sword! Once his training is complete, Russell is ready for action. Another miracle occurs when a military boat comes ashore. After a short struggle, Russell's on his way home. It's payback time! Many bodies are Shish Kabobbed, and much karate is displayed. Oh yes, Doug Russell will have his satisfaction! If you crave your urban action w/ heavy doses of revenge, then FIGHTING MAD has got you covered... P.S.- Watch for the breathtakingly beautiful Jayne Kennedy as Russell's wife Maria!...",1396310400,3,1220,5.044554455445544
7999554,2,B0000CNY52,"It's a good movie and story of revenge. My only issue is the audio is out of sync with the video and the video skips when the audio is still going. I don't know what source they used to make the DVD-R but, they need to do some serious quality control. Bottom line, it's still watchable and you are getting what you pay for.",1323216000,3,323,4.0625
7999555,1,B0000CNY52,"This is NOT the (1976) ""Fighting Mad"" with Peter Fonda, Lynn Lowry, John Doucette.  Do NOT Purchase",1281484800,2,99,4.823529411764706
7999556,1,B0000CNY52,"This movie, ""Fighting Mad"" is NOT the movie directed by Jonathan Demme staring Peter Fonda - the picture on the jacket leads you to believe that it is, but the movie inside is something entirely different....so, if you're looking for Jonathan Demme's ""Fighting Mad"" DO NOT ORDER THIS MOVIE.",1257120000,6,290,4.938775510204081
7999557,1,B0000CNY52,"The movie I recieved had Peter Fonda's picture on the packaging and CD.  However, once I played the movie it had some other movie in it.  Peter Fonda was not in the movie I recieved. Bad move, I would not recommend this seller.",1254182400,5,227,4.255813953488372
7999558,1,B0000CNY52,"The original Amazon listing represented this DVD as the 1976 Jonathan Demme classic with Peter Fonda.  I ordered the DVD thinking that I had finally found the movie I have sought for years.  No such luck!  The movie recorded on the DVD is a very poor quality copy of ""Death Force"" (1978) which was later retitled ""Fighting Mad"" (apparently for TV release).

After I bought the movie, Amazon appears to have changed the listing to reflect the correct movie, but the quality is still that of a DVD-R copy of a VHS tape, so if you are looking for ""Death Force"" aka ""Fighting Mad,"" don't buy this version.",1197763200,,601,4.537037037037037
