5832241,3,B00DLX76GY,"I bought this because I LOVE Tracy Anderson, and according to the front cover it is 4 cardio routines, which I was excited about, but it ended up being just muscular structure work?!",1378944000,9,182,4.545454545454546
5832242,5,B00DLX76GY,"I also thought it was a cardio workout but I'm really glad I bought it, it's really thorough workout with all the Tracy moves that are really very effective.
The only thing that I missed from this workout was the standing abs. Those are the best most effective moves from Tracy that I have ever tried, and there are no standing abs on this DVD, I still don't know how effective her ab work will be, I'm guessing that it will be brilliant, but I still miss it...",1378944000,10,461,4.25
5832243,4,B00DLX76GY,"Although the cover of this bills it as having ""4 complete cardio workouts,"" it really is a toning/muscular structure workout, similar to Tracy Anderson's Mat, Perfect Design, and Metamorphosis workouts.

The workout is broken down into segments that cover arms, legs, butt, and abs.  You can choose to do just one segment, or you can play all of them together, for a 60-minute workout.

To do the workout you'll need the following equipment:

*  a yoga mat
*  a pair of 3-pound and 5-pound dumbbells
*  a chair
*  ankle weights (optional)

If you're new to Tracy Anderson, I would definitely get this and/or her new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Method-for-Beginners/dp/B00D2UMHC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Method for Beginners</a>&nbsp;workouts before jumping into her other programs.  In these two new workouts, Tracy takes more time to explain proper form and she cues much more than she does in her older ones.  She even counts the reps on this one, and explains all of the various angles that she uses to target your legs and arms.  In fact, this would be a great one to get and do a few times before doing one of the Metamorphosis sets since she explains the positioning of your body so much better.

The music was a disappointment since some of it (in the legs segment) is from Metamorphosis, and I've heard it so often that it made me a little insane!  :-)  I love the music on her Mat and dance cardio workouts, and had been hoping for similar music on this one since she has such great taste in that area!

Tracy's method is very different, and I've had mixed results with it.  (I've posted lengthy reviews of my experiences with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracy-Anderson-s-Metamorphosis-Glutecentric/dp/B00BPDJHUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracy Anderson's Metamorphosis - Glutecentric</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracy-Anderson-s-Metamorphosis-Hipcentric/dp/B00BPDI5DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracy Anderson's Metamorphosis - Hipcentric</a>&nbsp;in those links.)

Because of my experiences, I'm not sure if I would do an entire TA rotation again, but I really like mixing in her workouts with other instructors, and I've found the arms segment on Mat to be one of the best arm workouts I have.  The arms segment on this new DVD is equally good.  (On Facebook recently, someone in a fitness group I belong to posted her results from doing 30 days in a row of just TA Mat arms, and her arms looked amazing!  Now that I have this second DVD, I might try alternating the two segments to see if I can get similar results.)

Overall, this is a good workout to start with if you're curious about trying Tracy Anderson's muscular structure work or if you want to add something new from her into the mix.  It's not for beginners, and I was pleasantly sore the day after I did this for the first time!",1378598400,34,2961,5.473568281938326
5832244,5,B00DLX76GY,"Yay! I am not at all disappointed with this new video! I own Tracy's mat DVD, metamorphosis glutecentric, perfect design series, n post pregnancy. So obviously I'm a fan.
It does say Cardio on the cover, which it's really not, it's more toning. Personally tho, I was happy about that. And each 15 minute segment is at a pace which gets your heart rate up and sweating. The Leg portion is challenging and different (done standing with a chair) the Butt portion has some new on all fours moves, she does 40 reps of each and suggest ankle weights which I use. Really liked the Ab section, it's a great AB workout. Where some of her other routines are a little fast, she does 20 reps of each Ab move, then some plank stuff at the end. I didn't do the Arm section yet because of time.. But I'm looking forward to it. Tracy is definitely unique in her approach but I find her method more effective than many other workouts. And she is no bs.. She doesn't come off bubbly and annoying. I am grateful to Tracy.. And she really does provide plenty of content for people to use her method at home. I was so excited for a new TA workout and it didn't disappoint at all.",1378512000,22,1158,4.292237442922374
5832245,4,B00DLX76GY,"I have Tracy's Mat workout and I have tried her Metamorphosis Abcentric. I think this is a great step after her Mat workout. It's harder but it still has a familiar elements of both. It has 4, 15 minute sections focusing on Arms, Legs, Glute and Abs. In the Arms she warms you up with no weights and moves you into weights. She uses 3lbs and briefly 5lbs. This was challenging and fatigued my arms. The 5's topped it off! In the Legs, she uses the chair for standing and floor work. This was challenging and really fatigued my legs. The Glute section was on the floor with the option to use ankle weights. She uses 1.5 lb each and doesn't recommend using anything heavier. I tried 2.5 and humbly and quickly took them off! In the last section, Abs, is done on the floor. I like the option to do just one section or play all. Even though they are 15 minutes each they deliver a good burn and fatigues the muscles. They are challenging! I was sore the next day which is hard to find sometimes! I enjoyed it!",1378425600,206,1005,4.267015706806283
5832246,4,B00DLX76GY,"I thought this workout was going to be cardio be in actuality it is a segmented toning workout (lost one star for the implied cardio).

It reminds me of Tracy's mat DVD, it is about an hour to do all 4 segments which are:
1.  Arms
2. Legs
3. Butt
4. Abs

Tracy actually talks you through the moves in this DVD and she COUNTS THE REPS.  This is one thing I found lacking in some of her other workouts like Metamorphosis. I have done metamorphosis and this is more difficult then some of the first few levels and less difficult then the last few levels.  The pros are that the arms really get a workout here, that is a huge bonus to me.  I also appreciate that you don't spend a lot of time on all fours as in the meta videos.  That was my least favorite part of meta and I appreciate that it is minimal in this DVD.

You will need the following:
Mat, 3 pound weights, 5 pound weights, an armless chair, and 1.5 pound ankle weights

You can either play the entire workout or pick the section that you want.  This will be a nice add on to any other workout and especially nice if you want to focus on one area.

I would imagine you could do this DVD and then follow it up with the perfect design series, although she states that this will prep you for meta.  For those that aren't ready/willing for the meta commitment this is a good DVD.",1378339200,140,1335,4.111969111969112
5832247,1,B00DLX76GY,"I purchased this DVD thinking that it would be ""4 complete workouts"" as stated in the photo on this site which to me suggests 20 - 30 minute challenging TA workouts.  I received the DVD today and the box says 4 complete ""15 minute"" cardio workouts which is not what the picture says on this site.  I've decided to return the DVD without opening it because I don't need another short beginner's workout DVD from Tracy Anderson...I thought this would be something different.  I'm disappointed...her Method for Beginners DVD is beginner enough for me and way too much talking.  I don't want to risk having yet another chatty, beginners workout...should I keep it?",1378339200,11,660,4.814159292035399
5832248,5,B00DLX76GY,"I do like the previously released Tracy Anderson Method workouts, but if I had one criticism, it's that there was never real cueing or coaching on form (at least on on Metamorphosis or Dance Cardio ones; the Perfect Design series does provide good form pointers) which can make it difficult to achieve proper form especially since her moves are usually unconventional.  This DVD is perfect for those of us that would like more schooling on what goes where.  She states in the warm-up that it's meant to prep you to go onto Metamorphosis workouts.  It's not done via voice-over; she instructs while she is doing the workout, including repetition counts. Of all her workout DVDs this is her most conventional as far as presentation goes but the moves are still pure Tracy Anderson.  It still hits all the muscles from a variety of angles, using a mat, chair, dumb bells, and optional ankle weights. The box says ""Cardio"" but it really a toning workout.  I would recommend it for beginners, people who might have been frustrated with previous TAM workouts, and those of us who could work on proper form.",1378252800,68,1100,4.768421052631579

5832251,5,B00DLX76GY,Great workout! works all those small muscles that most workouts don't hit...will change your body if you're consistent with it. Not as easy as the Mat video but good. Reason I bought it was she actually counts the reps in this one so  you don't have to watch her to do it. I wish she would do that more in her other videos.,1500940800,,323,4.126984126984127
5832252,5,B00DLX76GY,"As a longtime fan of Tracy, I have to say this is one of her best:

- very, very challenging (I didn't think it would be at the beginning, but whoa! by the end)
- fantastic explanations of moves (very helpful since I think I sometimes do the wrong angle)
- broken into 4 15 minute workouts for a full hour or less depending on time or areas you want to work

She does count out loud throughout, so if that annoys you you won't like this (I liked it). Also, the music is lame if you are used to her live streaming class.",1500076800,,519,3.980769230769231

5832260,4,B00DLX76GY,"I like this video alot. I go to the Tracy Anderson studio in NYC which is very expensive and not always easy to get into the classes. This is a decent substitute when I am not able to make it to the studio. Plus, Tracy explains the moves in a lot more detail than they do at the studio. It's a bit like a 1980's aerobics and toning, but I love it.",1483401600,2,347,3.8333333333333335
5832261,4,B00DLX76GY,"I'm a huge Tracy Anderson fan, but not a huge fan of all the ""all fours"" stuff. This workout is great because the legs portion uses a chair instead of being down on the ground for a half hour. Once I memorized the exercises I could literally do them anywhere there was a surface and enough space. It's nice to be able to skip through the different sections but wish there was a menu (I stream on amazon which only lets me fast forward, but not a huge deal).",1482883200,2,457,4.146067415730337

5832267,5,B00DLX76GY,"great TA workout.  4-15 minute segments: arms, legs, glutes, abs.  no cardio.  This is tough but effective.  I'm about 40 lbs overweight.  I alternate TA workouts with Jillian, Gilad, Slim in 6, walking, running and basic stretching.  Tracey's workouts have given me visible results.  I started working out with her tapes around January 2016.  When I started my knees creaked, but they have improved.  I can squat without horrible noises; it's no longer a big deal for me to bend down and get back up.  I do miss the more eclectic music that she plays in her MAT workout. She seems to have taken her mainstream criticisms to heart.  It's a bit annoying that she counts every rep, but I can live with it.  Also, as far as her controversy with weights, I believe you can use 3lb weights, or lift as much as you can safely.  Why be so mad at Ms. Anderson?  Do what works for your body.  Some of her exercises aren't designed to be done with 10 lb. weights.  When I feel I want to lift more, I do a different program.  As for the number of reps she does in this video, I just do what I can.  I started  out doing 15 of each leg rep and now I've worked up to 20.  Don't beat yourself up if you can't do them all the first time.  She is incredibly fit for her own workouts.  I can say though that I do have nice lines starting to appear in my abs and my stomach is starting to get really flat.",1476144000,9,1387,4.154716981132076

When I take a break I can resume with any routine that feels right.  I feel amazing every time I do any of her routines and I LOVE her method of teaching.

There's no jumping around/high impact moves, and she explains the exercises better than in past dvds, if that is important to you.  Her moves are unique, which I enjoyed when I first discovered Tracy Anderson's workouts.  If you don't mind hearing relentless counting, then you won't mind this program.  For me personally, when there are 10 sets with 40 reps each, I don't need to hear each and every tiresome count....""27, 28, 29,30..."" You get the idea. It gets old pretty quick. This program is divided into four parts, and I like that I can easily pick and choose what section to do by using the dvd menu option. However, I no longer use this program often, and here's why.  While at first I loved the arm work, I found that for the first time ever, after using this dvd for a few months I had a bad burning/sharp pain in my shoulder.  I later read on another review that someone tore their rotator cuff from doing Tracy Anderson's workouts, and I believe it.  WAY too much emphasis on the shoulders.  My dad had rotator cuff surgery and I wouldn't ever want to go through that, so I stopped doing it and my shoulder was better almost immediately.  The ab section is very challenging and if you have strong abs, you will like it.  The leg section is not for those with knee trouble, as there are deep bends at the beginning.  My favorite is probably the glutes section, but I don't like the 40 reps and all the counting.  In all, I wouldn't recommend this dvd.",1430092800,8,1511,4.434782608695652

Well... let me say that I've been into Tracy Anderson's Method for five years now, that I've been doing Metamorphosis Hipcentric for the last two years and, however, this DVD is challenging. The leg-butt sequences are killer and that's why I love Precision Toning so much. If you never tried Tracy's programs maybe this isn't the right one to start with: her Beginner workouts will suit you better.

I am not disciplined enough to utilize the diet TA recommends in her book but am very happy with the results of the DVD on a bi-weekly basis.

To me, there is nothing worse than a chirpy, continuous voice telling you what to do during your workout :) She gives instruction, never stop moving and is easy to follow.",1428451200,4,745,4.109589041095891

But I have to do the ab section first because this dvd starts out with arms and my arms are so fatigued after I can hardly do the planks on the ab sections. If I start out with the ab section first I am able to do the entire circuit fine. It's a great workout and burns in all the right places!,1428278400,4,327,3.823529411764706
5832330,4,B00DLX76GY,"Bottom line: this DVD works. I have been using it off and on for the past year and really enjoy it. As other users have mentioned, this DVD is split up between 4 parts of the body and you can pick and choose which ones you want to do. This differentiates this DVD from most other TA DVDs, where you would have to fast forward through parts you don't want to focus on. I really like using this DVD as a supplement to my other workout routine (elliptical at the gym, hiking, skiing, yoga) to focus on toning. After a year of supplementing with this DVD, as well as several other TA DVDs, and without significantly altering my diet or cardio routine, I have noticed significant changes in the definition in my arms, abs, and thighs.

I understand that many users are turned off by TA's inability to queue and poor editing. This may make the DVD challenging for the first few times you do the workout, but those issues have no bearing on the DVD's ability to change your body, which is why you are probably interested in buying a workout DVD. So let me address these concerns further:

1. With regard to the lack of queueing:
TA will never queue well because she wants you to pay attention to what she's doing. Her moves are subtle and if she were to queue ""Now cross your leg over your other leg"" you might miss the point in her toe, the bend upward of her knee, etc. However, it's difficult to know without a queue if she's changed the move when you're on your knees looking downward and that's a legitimate concern.
2. With regard to the poor editing:
Sure, the camera could do a better job panning out at times or changing position, and sometimes her moves are inconsistent, but that's more an issue with her design/QA/QC team than her and her workout. This is humorous to me because the TA brand is very successful and has the funds to do a really clean edit. It's common in workout classes for one side to get missed on a move occasionally, or for the arms to be held differently, but it's a challenge in a workout DVD because you watch the same edit over and over again. The best example of this is the first move of the glutes section, where TA says you need to do a certain move with your arms and explains how important it is. Then, when she moves on to the same move on the other side, she forgets to do that arm move. This happens, she's a human and humans make mistakes, but she's also paying probably a half dozen or more people to double check her work and their job is to catch errors.

In sum: You as the consumer should definitely buy this DVD and learn the moves. TA as the brand and designer of this method should fire her QA/QC team.",1428192000,5,2650,4.296
5832331,2,B00DLX76GY,I'll start of by saying that I purchased her Mat workout and absolutely love and do it a few times a week. I figured I would try another of her DVD's and decided on this and I have such a different opinion. I really dislike this DVD - the only part that I tolerate is the arms section...I found the other parts too fast and there is absolutely no information on proper posture and alignment and the moves just seem complicated and chaotic..I gave this two stars ONLY because of the rather okay arms segment. I think I will likely give this DVD away because I just can't see myself ever using it.,1426118400,5,595,4.274336283185841

The first week is absolute misery and Tracy's personality kind of annoys me, but this routine works. It's not complicated like some of her other DVDs. You can do it anywhere. Also, when I ordered it on Amazon, I got a free kindle edition and now I have it on my iPad and squeeze it in when traveling.
Another thing - it's divided into 4 sections - arms, legs, butt, abs. Each roughly 10-15 mins. You can squeeze in a section thru out the day. If you are skeptical - get the dvd, do the 15 min arm routine every morning and see the results. Then know that  you will get the same results for the rest of your body if you do the rest of the DVD. The arm section doesn't make you sweat - so you can do it waiting for the coffee to brew or during your lunch hour. You don't need workout clothes to do the arms.

5832361,5,B00DLX76GY,"I love this dvd.  It's somehow both really easy.... and yet really hard.  Making it great for non-fit and fit people alike.

It's easy in the sense that it's easy to follow.  Tracy goes into detail on how to do the moves precisely and she doesn't go too fast (except in the ab section which I'll get to later).  If you're just starting out you can just do the workouts without weights or pick and choose from the 4 sections to move more slowly.

If you are very fit you will still get your butt kicked though as she will recommend you use weights and you can do more than one section at a time.  My butt and lower back muscles have always been weak so the butt section is something I could not go move through all the way even without weights.  Only after 2 1/2 weeks of doing the butt section every single day was I FINALLY able to move through that 15 minute workout all the way through (although I still get out of breath by the end of it).  You really get to appreciate just how friggin' strong this petite little woman is watching her do all these moves without breaking a sweat AND while using 1.5 lb weights on her ankles!

The ab section moves really fast.  She warns you of this when she starts this section.  I'm guessing she was running out of time on the DVD or something so she tried to cram the Ab section in there by moving super fast.

5832372,5,B00DLX76GY,"This is an excellent product.  There are 4 sections, and each is 15 minutes.  nice, clear menu choices.  You can pick one, and go, or do all 4 in any order you like, or the way she has them set up (for a reason)..

  She uses basic Kung Fu / Dance element of Chi and using all the body, and the smaller muscles to tone and get the body working at its peak without building extra bulk or large muscles that just block blood flow and ""chi""....  I have used it daily for a few weeks and notice HUGE changes in my energy level, attitude, body..

She explains that you do need to watch carefully and follow her movements and angles, (and focus on your own body, find your own rhythm, and what you are feeling) which is often not easy, because of the camera (men, no doubt) filming their favorite parts of her anatomy.. But after a few days of doing it over and over, the natural flow of ones own body makes sense...  The moves are small, and precise, flowing, and not the vigorous ""western"" movement and usual waste of energy...  this is a great product.  It took me a while to get used to her style, and the whole feeling of it, but I am now hooked!!!  you can use weights or not...  (very light weights) and I have fibromyalgia and a few other things, and this DVD never leaves me in pain , even days after..

purchased Jan16.2014
used once or twice.  until this week Aug. 16.2014- Sept 7, 2014, have used now almost daily since the 16th, and my body, mind, emotions, energy have not felt this good since my 20'3 - 30's!!! The inner (qi) chi balance of my own body's energy (as happens in martial arts training) ... is transforming me into my best self!!  (Of course, along with calorie counting, and watching what and when and how much I eat... mostly raw / vegan.. but I splurge now and again, getting enough rest, etc..  )

I have many other ""exercise"" tools that have traveled with me over the years, that I was just ""not "" ready for, but now I am..

My background - wide - gymnastics, dance, ice skating, ballet, martial arts,  personal trainer, runner, resistance training, kickboxing..loved the cardio class..

 female, but always felt the more powerful, strong, tough energy - rather than the soft flowing energy in this body.

her lack of ""real"" formal instructions (like my brain is used to with ""western exercise""/  result driven, specific muscles or goals  - perfect form - become a 'rock'.. a 'machine' ) was frustrating, yet refreezing, because ""been there, done that""..  plus, since I'm getting older, and the heavy body building, running a mile or 2 a day,  days are gone..  Being a ""hard body "",  was fun, but now I want to learn to control my ""chi"" energy qi -  and flow , and still be strong as I get ""up"" there in the earthly numbers

I have started using this DVD daily now this week, and can feel and SEE the amazing changes in my energy flow, relaxation,  and the body itself.  Glad I am finally ready to push through the learning curve (of learning any thing new) and just ""do it""...  it ""comes' after we just repeat something over and over.  which is exactly what she says.

precision toning which is 4-15 min. segments, with a clear menu choice  which is great, you can ""stir up and activate your ""chi"" quickly and go.. don't even really need any ""tools"" weighs or workout ""outfit""...  if you are in a rush..

arms  15min
legs (standing) 15min
butt (mat) all 4's (15min)
abs (mat) 15 min

I feel my energy flowing in my body like never before after just a few uses this week.. I do 30 minutes a day usually of something ( I have a wide collection of DVD's on all the disciplines I still enjoy - and the only other one that comes close is KATA in the Combat DVD collection.

This is like learning how to use my wings in the arms section, and bring in energy I want, and push away energy I do not want.  Same with the legs , butt and abs... Her angles are hard to see often with the camera guys (I bet) focusing on certain areas of her body, but I thought maybe she wants that , so we focus on our own energy, and not outside comparison...  To feel what is happening in my own body, rather than try to look just like her.  She explained the angles very clearly, and to learn those take time, but by doing, we learn, and we learn by doing... its very TAO - energy flow, opening blocked areas of the body -  I did arms twice yesterday  -  I've always had long arms , large scapula and shoulder bones, and also tend to build muscle very quickly there with traditional pushup / weight type exercise, which actually has limited my ability to use my energy correctly my whole life...

so this is transforming, if you are ready for the ride, or have that flowing, soft, energy already, and just want to get in shape - this is great for you...  No matter what, I believe if you don't like it, wait, and maybe you'll be ready one day, or gift it to someone

If you're ready to spread your wings and fly - and learn to ""feel"" your body, and feel the energy flowing in your body, and start getting really comfortable from inside out - -  from the energy -- flowing - this is for you...

I have a few of her other ones as well.. and they are different but similar. I know now why she calls them metamorphosis..  it's spiritually mentally and physically calming - I have felt more peace and a grounding relaxing sense of my energy than I can ever remember!!",1409011200,9,5365,4.296111665004985

5832378,4,B00DLX76GY,"I have been working with Tracy's dvds for about 4 months and have seen noticable differences in my muscular structure. She definitely knows what she is talking about - proof is in the pudding, so to speak. She very clearly states that it is essential to ""learn"" the workouts, and she also states that the results are in the details. So, even if she isn't giving constant instruction, paying attention to the subtle angles and placements of limbs can and does make a difference in results. I have a dance and fitness background and I can attest to the fact that Tracy's method is different because it doesn't bulk. I have a problem with this big time, and I'm not bulking! Having said all this, Listen to your body - be smart! Start slow, if you need to, to avoid injury and to get used to the movements. If you need to, watch or read tutorials on movements or excersises you don't understand. Also, if you have low back pain, make sure you are supporting with your core (center, abs). Try starting with less reps and always stop if you feel ""bad"" pain. I have suffered for a long time from sciatica, so all her hip and glute work is challenging for me, but having strenth around the lower back is important for stabilizing the hips, so I do what I can and I am definitely getting stronger (no bulk) and defined. My arms are finally looking slim again - yay! So, I am saying that any result worth getting takes time and diligence. If Tracy's method isn't your cup of tea that's fine, but for me it is delivering what it promises, so it's worth the effort of making sure Im doing the excersises how she intends them to be done. Otherwise, i have noone to blame but myself ;-)",1407369600,16,1673,4.382636655948553
5832379,4,B00DLX76GY,"Although I'm not a huge Tracy Anderson follower like some, I have and enjoy her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mat-Workout/dp/B00JJH2RGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mat Workout</a>.  I particularly like the arms segment from that DVD and often do just the arms work alone, which is a bit of a pain since Mat Workout is unchaptered.  I was interested in Precision Toning because it also offered short workout segments, but this time, in a chaptered format.

Oddly, the DVD case for Precision Toning says ""4 Complete Cardio Workouts.""  These are sculpting/toning routines, NOT cardio, although it is possible that your heart rate might increase to an aerobic level on a few occasions, such as during the standing leg work.  The Main Menu of the DVD simply lists the four segments, and so I have provided an overview of each below.

ARMS (16 minutes)
Anderson begins here with a brief (2-minute) introduction.  This is followed by 7.5 minute of unweighted arms work similar to Anderson's Mat Workout.  Unlike in Mat, however, here Anderson cues EVERY move, frequently counting all the reps as well (usually 8 total).  After the unweighted series, Anderson comes to a kneeling position on the floor, picking up 3# weights for additional arms work.  She then actually increases the weights to 5# for a few more moves, with the entire weighted arms sequence being about 6.5 minutes.

LEGS (14 minutes)
This segment involves standing leg work using a chair.  Unlike in Mat Workout, however, where Anderson stood behind the chair, this time she has the chair to the side.  She performs 25 reps of each exercise before switching to the second side.  The standing moves are as follows:  1) deep squat with side kick, 2) fast side kick, 3) attitude side kick, and 4) deep twisting squat with attitude lift.  Anderson then kneels to the side of the chair for two additional moves:  1) kneeling side kick and 2) kneeling back kick.  This segment was TOUGH--I was winded by the end--and Anderson says that it's just to prepare you for the Butt work!

BUTT (15 minutes)
This section works the behind from an all-fours position.  I found this segment VERY challenging, not only because I don't particularly enjoy all-fours work, but also because Anderson does FORTY reps of each move, which really seemed like overkill to me.  She has a brief introduction (1-minute) in the beginning, and she explains that she will be using 1.5# ankle weights.  (OUCH!  I skipped those.)  Here are the moves she includes:  1) inverted knee to straight side lift, 2) straight leg side to bent leg kick, 3) side straight leg to crossover attitude, 4) attitude lifts, and 5) inverted kicks.

ABS (13 minutes)
The first 8 minutes of this segment starts off with Anderson's version of crunches.  These are general performed with the legs straight, lifting the head and shoulders in a straight line, although Anderson adds various leg movements (e.g., attitude, windshield wiper legs, etc.).  I find that keeping my legs perfectly straight strains my back, so I tend to modify by bending them a bit.  Anderson concludes this section with the following four plank moves (performed at a fast pace):  1) side touch and kick, 2) front touch and kick, 3) alternating hip drops, and 4) running knees.

Overall, I like this DVD.  For awhile, I was doing the Arms work every other day--alternating with Anderson's arms work on her Mat Workout DVD--and I think that helped to tone up my shoulders after they had gotten a bit bulky from a particular weight training program I was doing.  I also find the Legs a doable challenge for me.  As noted, working on all-fours is not my preferred way to train, so the Butt segment isn't something I will use, but others are likely to love it.  Finally, I am still trying to decide if Anderson's abs work is for me; I can't yet tell if my body responds to it yet.  Still, I am glad to have this well-cued, well-chaptered Tracy Anderson DVD.",1406937600,5,3975,4.924812030075188

Its also really convenient that I can choose which area I want to work on. Let's be honest, some days, a butt or leg workout is the last thing you want do, and this dvd makes it easy to click on the workouts I feel up to, rather than fast forwarding or just skipping out on the workout all together.

5832397,4,B00DLX76GY,"This is the second TA video I've used. My first was the mat workout, which I truly love and still do every once in awhile. If you are new to Tracy, definitely do the mat workout before Precision Toning. PT is not a ""cardio"" workout like the cover says, but even after 8 weeks of doing the DVD I am out of breath and really sweaty when I am done.

Unlike many of the other reviewers, I could live without the cueing in this DVD. Tracy explains some things well but mostly interjects in a way that is disruptive to the flow of the routines and it feels like a waste of time. I love her and she's obviously good at what she does but a lot of what she says doesn't make sense (rough example ""by moving our arms in this precise way we are accomplishing the same task as lean toned arms."" What..?). For me, her counting every single rep just makes everything feel more tedious. The counting is also a voiceover, so sometimes it's not totally in sync with what rep she/you are actually on and it can make me feel rushed to catch up when I'm actually on the right move. I should also note that the music is really boring and typical (not at all chill like the mat workout) so I just listen to what I want to drown it out.

I definitely wish there was more of a warm up and a cool down portion. Tracy says the arm series incorporates the warm up, but the arm portion has the least amount of flow of any part because she keeps stopping to explain basic movements that most people could easily follow along with if she just continued. I have found far less benefit from the arm section than I did in the mat workout's arm series, and I have actually felt the burn more as I keep up with the PT arm section because I think I was stronger when I first started the DVD. Otherwise, the PT DVD is a fairly tough full-body workout.

The leg section, with a chair like the mat workout, is supposed to exhaust your thighs so that you can maximize the butt series that follows. Four out of the six sets require either bending at the knees or kneeling on a knee, so if you have knee concerns like me I definitely recommend using extra support when you're kneeling. I use a cheap kneeling pad for gardeners that works great. I have naturally toned legs but I am pleasantly surprised that this has made my thighs look leaner.

In my opinion the butt section is really hard, but so worth it. You are on your hands and one knee for this entire part, so I use support for my knees here as well. You're doing 40 reps for each move on each side which makes it super tedious but the results are undeniable. Tracy uses ankle weights in this section, which I naively did the first time. Now that I can finally do it all the way through without wanting to collapse I feel ready to use them again. In both the leg and butt sections I could use a little bit more info on where I should be feeling the burn during the moves. Sometimes I feel it in the leg or cheek that is moving, and other times I feel it most in my support/stationary leg and I just want to make sure that I'm aligning myself correctly so I don't get injured.

The ab section, which is one half crunches and one half plank moves, is also intense. I love Tracy's variations on crunches and these are similar to those in the mat workout. Before this DVD I had zero experience with planks so I'm still struggling to master these as my core is not nearly as strong as most of her viewers' are. With that in mind, her own description of this DVD says it is for beginners so I think she should give a little more guidance on proper form besides not sticking your butt in the air since that's kind of obvious. Research how to do a basic plank if you're new to it like me.

Overall, there are a lot of little things that I don't like about the Precision Toning DVD, but I still give it 4 stars because most of the workout is great and I love the results.",1400716800,9,3880,4.159786950732357
5832398,3,B00DLX76GY,I workout quite often and found that this wasn't challenging enough to get anything out it. The arm section was decent but the legs and butt sections were way too easy.,1400630400,,168,4.451612903225806

However, I'm dissapointed that after the 30 day return window was closed, the new DVD had issues again with the Abs Section.  I cannot access by ""Play All"" or separately by clicking on Abs.

On a positive note, I love Tracy Anderson's workouts.  She really has developed a method that works for me.  I no longer feel like I have bulky biceps or thighs.  I feel my muscles are getting more slender and I feel better about my body.  I think the workouts are a bit challenging at first but become easier.  I think the only criticism I have of the workout is that it feels like the reps take forever, especially when you're on the Butt workout and she ups the reps to 40 for each exercise.

5832407,2,B00DLX76GY,"Ok, I will have to admit, though a daily exerciser I do have to ""like"" what I'm doing in order to keep at it and make it a part of my routine.  After losing 40#'s 9 years ago, the big ""take away"" was I won't do what I don't like, no matter how awesome it makes you look/feel, etc.

Tracy's precision toning workout falls in this category for me.  Likes:  effective, yes, I do feel all of the parts I worked on today-today I did the butt and abs (Yesterday was arms and legs) + a ten minute all over toning routine from another dvd.  So effective?  Yes!  Here is where I come into an issue.....leg lifts etc, that seemingly go on forever, counting up to 40 repetitions.....don't people in hell do this?  Yeah, I was not a fan.  It was very cut and dried and I just am not motivated enough by looking at how awesome she looks at 40 to add this into my rotation.  I prefer exercise that is more ""fun"" which for me is anything dance oriented, kickboxing or yoga with the occasional pilates thrown in for good measure.  The seemingly endless repetitions just were too much for me.

On an off topic, what is with the workout pants....I'm working out thinking ""Is Tracy really wearing pants that say ""I Love Tracy"""".....sorry, weird and also very distracting.

So, I would have to say from an exercise standpoint if you do not mind repetition, this is definitely effective.  If you need more to inspire you, this probably is not it.  Fun factor on this one is a 0 out 5, effectiveness is a 4 out of 5.  Overall, I would not purchase this video, and after borrowing it once I don't plan to borrow it again.  There are too many dvd's that I truly enjoy that also give me great results.  As far as cuing and good technique she gets an A, but still, not enough for me to actually want to do this again or purchase it.",1397606400,19,1806,4.24633431085044

5832410,5,B00DLX76GY,"So I had been doing the Tracy Anderson Method for almost two years when I became pregnant with twins in the Fall of 2012. She got me in the best shape of my life, and then BAM! Pregnant with twins!! I took about a year and a half off from exercising, and just took it easy with slow walks and stretching. Fast forward to February 2014.... So when I tried to dive back into her craziness (but you gotta love it, the girl gets you RESULTS) I almost DIED doing this DVD. If you are just getting into fitness or have been away from her method for a long while, I would definitely say WORK UP to this one. Feeling a bit defeated but unwilling to give up, I decided to order her newer ""Method for beginners"" DVD and also her Post Pregnancy DVD, to use and work at to be able to build up to this one. I don't have a bunch of time during the day with two 12 month olds crawling around, so I devoted 30-45 min to her Method, and did the beginner DVD faithfully for a month as the first program, than month two I devoted to her Post pregnancy DVD (GREAT FOR ABS after pregnancy!!) THEN, this past week was the start of month 3, and I popped this one in my DVD player and I am happy to say, it's still classic Tracy, meaning, super challenging, but do able if you set your mind to it. I will probably work at this one for another month or so, then move on to another DVD of hers.....she is not for everyone, and her moves Will seem strange at first, but if you stick with her for at least 60 days, no matter what your fitness level, your body WILL change. She got pretty rich doing what she does cause her stuff works. I don't do her Method exclusively, but I will say that her programs comprise at least 75% of my exercise time. She is the only fitness personality that has been able to capture and hold my attention for a long period of time, because I get results and she encourages you to constantly change it up.  Now, whether that's because she wants us to constantly buy new DVDs, who is to say, but it's not good to keep doing the same moves over and over again anyway. ...I find that too boring, especially if you are an at home exerciser like me. Oh....I also recommend reading her Book if you are completely brand new to her method. I feel like all her diet advice is a bit too crazy and restrictive, but the book is a GREAT  Primer to her exercise philosophy and gets you pumped to try her new ""wicked"" ways.....try it and you'll see! More than likely, you will come back for more like I did.",1395792000,91,2493,4.127572016460905

I like that she counts and talks through all the moves, which is often lacking in the metamorphosis series.  I think the difficulty level can go anywhere from beginner to advanced, even though she really seems to gear this to a more beginner audience.

It really is cardio wothout stressing the joints. As for some of the bad reviews I noticed they either did not open package or stopped it at the first sign of talking. Yes, when she started talking and stopped I ""almost"" turned it off, but I didn't because Im not a quiter! Then I finished the DVD. All 4 15 minute workouts. I was breathless after the first 15 minutes and I do hot yoga, run, and bootcamp classes. I felt my arms weak and my legs tremble. Definitely, need to play the whole video before reviewing. Or its simply an unfair review! I cant wait to do this everyday. I also bought the book, so it makes sense that these are repitive movements.

5832418,5,B00DLX76GY,"Either you love her or you hate her.  I personally really enjoy her workouts and have many of her DVDs (Post Pregnancy, Mat Workout, Design Series 1 and Ab-Centric Metamorphosis).  I have been waiting for a very long time for her to put out a DVD that breaks out the Arms, Abs, Legs, etc. into distinct sections so that I can pick and choose which order I want to do the workout and also on days where I want to only do a specific section I can easily do so.  I hope that going forward she will allow for this in all her DVDs.

Interestingly she uses 5 lbs. weights in this DVD which is odd since she has always said ""NEVER more that 3lb weights because you will create bulk and cause loose skin later!""

She does provide much better instruction in this DVD and she also seems to do a better job of counting, which seems to me a problem for Tracy in many of her other DVDs.",1393804800,5,873,4.1117647058823525
5832425,4,B00DLX76GY,"No matter what weird exercise phase I get into, I always, always go back to the TA Mat Workout. I heart that DVD so much. In light of that, I took one star off for Precision Toning b/c it is not as friendly to my bad wrists and knees (ie, I have to take breaks and/or modify) like the Mat video is.

In terms of clear direction, this DVD is amazing. I've never minded the lack of counting or direction in her other DVDs (exceptions: Teen Meta, which is pure torture, and Metamorphosis, which is also torture in a repetitive way--and therefore, I can't stick to it).

Also, for those who say this isn't a cardio DVD--well, ok, there is no dancing or running around, but holy crap, if you are ACTUALLY doing the exercises (not half-*ssing it, which is what I suspect a lot of complainers are doing, no offense), you will be gasping for breath by the time you get to the middle of the legs section. I was dripping sweat everywhere by this point (and also frequently cursing. The pain!!!). You will feel your heart racing for hours upon finishing.

This DVD is way harder than the Mat DVD (which I can actually get all the way through, in spite of being 15 lbs. overweight), which comparatively is like taking a 10 minute walk. It's been 2 days since I first did this workout and I am still walking bowlegged and jangly. My thighs are on freaking fire. I am going to try to get through it again tomorrow even though I'm practically tripping over myself from jangly-leg syndrome.",1393632000,73,1474,4.411764705882353

5832427,4,B00DLX76GY,I'm new to TA so was thinking it would be harder than her mat workout. I found her mat workout to have a better arm series. She uses 5# weights briefly in this one that goes against what she's said in other videos of only using 3# weights. The ab series is similar to her mat workout which I like. I have a hard time doing the ab part on your hands and knees though. I don't like all the deep knee squats. I'm worried it will hurt my knees that I tend to have issues with. I was expecting the 20 reps for her leg series but on your hands and knees you have 40 reps of 4-5 exercises each leg. I can't finish them it burns so much. It's hard to know if you're at the right angle sometimes even though she explains it. Often my stabilizing leg is burning more than my moving leg and she never seems to say whether that's normal or not. If you're new to TA and like to integrate her workouts like I do on your low energy days in place of a higher intensity workout- I'd stick to the mat workout. This is a little too intense for me.,1393113600,12,1028,3.9471153846153846

One thing that does annoy me is that Tracy (although a beautiful girl) really should pull her hair back. It seems to just get in the way of my focus. Another thing that I have noticed is that the chair she uses seems to have very long/tall legs next to any regular chair most of us would use. So it feels kind of awkward. Maybe i am being too picky?

But this DVD is great because she walks you through - unlike her previous videos.  And for this particular DVD, she breaks it up into 4 segments @ 15 minutes each; arms, abs, butt, legs ......with instructions that go at a pace that you can follow.

However the instructor has worked out so much and starved her self so much even though she works out for about 3 hours a day and only eats 1000 cal. She has an obvious thick layer of fat on her body and her butt is saggy. :( I do feel this workout will be effective used in moderation but her crazy ideas about women not lifting more than 5lbs is just ignorant. So if you like pilates but need more reps this is great.,1391472000,,458,4.1
5832452,5,B00DLX76GY,"This DVD is broken into four workouts- arms, thighs, butt and abs. You can mix and match, but they're really designed to be done together as the warm up is included in the arms workout. The contents of each workout are quite similar to her Mat dvd from the Tracy Anderson Method, but there are enough variations to make buying this DVD worthwhile. The arms section is quite fast-paced, and has the addition of 5 pound weights. This is pretty weird in some ways as Tracy used to be so insistent that women never use more than 3 pound weights. EVER. She doesn't explain this sudden change in her beliefs, but whatever. Your arms get an amazing workout.
The thigh and butt workouts are extremely challenging. In the thigh workout, you rely on a chair for balance the whole time as you do 25 reps of every move. Your leg muscles are completely exhausted by the end. The butt workout is on the floor, on all fours. Tracy's thinking is that if she exhausts your leg muscles in the thigh routine, by the time you do the butt the correct muscles will switch on. This is probably true, but you can really feel your legs screaming the whole way through the butt section. Your glutes also burn so much as you do 40 reps of every move. It's extremely sweaty work, and you pant the whole way through. Great workout.
The abs section is also very difficult with lots of small range of motion sit-ups and leg raises. You also do plank twists which are super challenging.
Highly recommended DVD for anyone who wants to get super toned and lean. Tracy will not bulk your muscles!",1391212800,12,1561,4.461538461538462

I didn't feel anything in my arms the next day but my quads and butt were killing so bad I seriously could not walk up or down stairs for 3 days!!  That told me 1) it's definitely a decent workout (or possibly I'm in worse shape than I thought) and 2) definitely need to do more stretching on my own afterwards!

I have been doing the TAM (Tracy Anderson method) for a few months--Metamorphosis specifically--but today I did this workout after not doing it for months, the full hour, and I am shaking it is so hard.

With this DVD in particular, there is no room for confusion. She walks you through every step, explaining how to do a move and why its beneficial. In addition, the dvd is broken into parts, so you can pick and choose what body part you want to work out. This is hands down my favorite TA workout yet. Its fast, clearly explained, and she is more engaging in this video.  love doing this workout and like with all of her workouts, I have seen tremendous results in the just the 1 month i have been doing it. Next is Meta!",1384992000,6,811,4.10062893081761
5832497,4,B00DLX76GY,"Tough workout, but maybe a little awkward.  I wonder if I'm doing all the moves correctly...it's a bit hard to tell despite the fact that Tracy gives more instruction in this video then in any of her others...",1384819200,3,209,4.5
5832498,5,B00DLX76GY,"All I can say is Tracy knows her stuff she is awesome. I love her kick butt workouts. I own her beginner method and I love it, she is my favorite trainer of all time!",1384646400,5,166,3.7714285714285714
5832499,3,B00DLX76GY,It is a nice workout when I don't have time and want to squeeze in a quick workout.  I like that it is broken up in four fifteen minute workouts.  It is not difficult.  I was under the impression this was advanced and I would call it a beginner workout.,1384300800,5,253,4.02
5832500,3,B00DLX76GY,A little odd but hits the spot. The divisions are also awkward and I guess you have to like the solo teacher style. Add to a cardio program,1384300800,2,139,4.0

Good value, can be a good gift for Xmas.
For all women",1384300800,,112,4.136363636363637
5832502,5,B00DLX76GY,Great workout!  I love Tracy Anderson and her Method! This is a dvd to grow with. I still can only do the first 10 minutes of the ab workout.,1383782400,2,141,3.8620689655172415
5832503,5,B00DLX76GY,"Let me start by saying I love Tracy Anderson workouts and have been doing her metamorphosis / continuity for close to 3 years now.  When I got this in the mail, I had it in the DVD player, ready to work out in a flash.

This DVD is broken up into four 15 minute segments of Arms, Thighs, Butt and Abs.

For the arm workout, she uses 3 and 5 lb. weights.  Good stuff, but tough! I kept wanting to take a break, but I stuck it out all the way through.  I love how in this workout she actually explains the arm movements, such as ""Pretend your handing me something and then push it away.""  It's nice to have verbal cues because sometimes her arms move so quickly it's hard to see where her hands are and what they are doing.

The thigh workout was another toughie.  There are quite a few deep squat moves, so if you have knee issues, this might need to be modified.  My quads were still screaming at me two days later.  She does 25 reps of each move, and 7 or 8 exercises (can't remember now), first on the right, then the left.  She uses a chair for balance on the standing exercises and then drops to the mat for kneeling / all fours exercises.  She counts every single rep.

For the butt workout, she uses ankle weights.  I can't remember if she mentions the weight, but I used 1.5 lbs.  This was my favorite section. I was surprised at the difficulty.  In this section she does 40 reps for each move, with 5 exercises, first on the right and then on the left.  Again, she counts every single rep.

And then the ab section was wonderful, as I love TA ab work and find it to be super effective. I was finding it to be the easiest section, now that I was laying down, but then she does a bunch of plank work in different variations, with a lot of twisting and resting the hip on one side, then lifting up and twisting to the other to rest the hip.  It was very challenging and I had to ""rest"" a few times by just holding a plank and taking out the twists.

I kept with TA on every rep and did the entire workout without pausing the DVD, which makes it a winner in my book.  I appreciate knowing that this is exactly 1 hour (or 15 minute segments) without the need to pause.

I personally found it to be a nicely challenging workout.

I also loved how she explained all the angles and moves. I had a lot of ""ah-ha"" moments throughout.  Her personality shined on this one and she smiled a lot.

All in all, this is a winner for me.

My one con: Can we get some new music already? Thank goodness for music off option.",1383696000,18,2512,4.1067761806981515
5832504,5,B00DLX76GY,"I have been following and collecting Tracy Anderson DVDs and programs since she's been around in the early 2000s. Her cueing in this video is by far the best, she tells you what you should be doing, rather than what you think you should do. It's great to be able to select what part you want to work out(in case you want to finish one part and later move on to another), since in all of her other video you have to watch the whole thing or skip to a certain part to work just one area.

 I did the arms first and I definitely felt the burn! I have her metamorphosis DVDs and I don't feel like I get enough out of the arms segment.....this really works them. And the best part is that she counts so you know you are doing the same amount of reps on each side.

 This is a great introduction to Tracy Anderson's Method and I would recommend it to those who maybe weren't too fond of her other DVDs or just trying her out for the first time. It takes time but you will see results.",1383609600,6,978,4.051813471502591
5832525,5,B00DLX76GY,"I have most of ther dvds including the meta programm - they are all great but none of them are as tough as this one! She explains precisely how to make the moves and motivates you through the hour. If you don't have the time for the whole hour you can choose between the sequences arms, butt, thighs and stomach. I really love it :-)",1383091200,3,333,4.138461538461539
5832526,5,B00DLX76GY,"This one is different in the way Tracy talks you through each exercise, however this is one of my favourites that I do regularly to really ensure that I am working my muscles correctly and I feel it working and see the results! Recommend highly!!
Tracy has a wonderful presence!",1382918400,,278,4.58
5832527,5,B00DLX76GY,"I am really happy with this DVD.  Her previous DVDs left something to be desired, but it would seem that she took reviews from those workouts to heart and modified accordingly.  On this DVD, she gives better instruction, counts, and SMILES!  I like that there are four mini-workouts so I can pick and choose and create a sequence that fits into my schedule.",1382832000,2,357,4.634920634920635
5832528,5,B00DLX76GY,"After completing nothing her Abcentric and Omnicentric 90 day DVD programs, I expected more of the same exercises and I was right. However, this tape was much better because she gave clear instructions and counted for every single movement. Yes her exercises are challenging and work muscles I don't get with the Beachbody routines I've been using.
I believe in mixing up my exercise regime with Zumba, Pilates, P90x. 10 minute trainer, the Core, Urban Rebounder. Fluidity, Brazilian Butt Master Series, Malibu  Pilates, Ab Rocket, Slim in 6, The Ab Circle, Rock'n Body, Hip Hop abs Jillian Michael workout DVDs and currently the T-25 workout series.",1382745600,,650,5.132075471698113
5832529,5,B00DLX76GY,"I have a few TA dvds in my collection which i use every second day.  This is great to add a bit more variety to my workouts.  I like the fact that its broken up into 4 fifteen minute segments.  If im short of time I can do just 2 or 3 of the segments and I can choose the segments for the areas of my body I want to concentrate on that day.  The only thing I don't like is the lack of music.  Its nice for Tracy to  be more vocal and give instruction but I would prefer music instead of her counting out loud.  As usual, Tracy gives you a killer results driven workout.  I'm a big Tracy Anderson fan and push myself through her workouts because since I started on them, I'm in the best shape I have ever been in.  If you commit to doing the hard work, you won't be disappointed.",1382659200,2,778,3.9044585987261144
5832530,4,B00DLX76GY,I like that she explained and took her time to show the right steps.  It got the work down but Ididn't feel like I had to rush to keep up with her. All the exercises are great and the arms segment really burns so you know it's working.,1382486400,4,235,3.8958333333333335
5832531,5,B00DLX76GY,Bought this for my girlfriend who is a Zumba instructor.  She likes the content and the movements on the DVD very much.  Hope this review useful!,1382313600,,145,4.538461538461538
5832532,5,B00DLX76GY,You can notice the difference in this workout immediately.  It definitely works on a leaner look rather than a bulky one.,1381968000,2,121,4.761904761904762
5832533,5,B00DLX76GY,I really like this cd workout! I really can fe which muscles get targeted during the workout and can see the difference in my body while my clothes feel looser too!,1381795200,,164,4.32258064516129
5832534,5,B00DLX76GY,I enjoy the different sections on this toning tape. The exercises were easy to follow and the music was upbeat. I would recommend to anyone.,1381708800,,140,4.64
5832545,5,B00DLX76GY,"Awesome workout, not just for beginners... But this is NOT what I would consider a cardio workout. At all. First time I did it I planned it on my ""cardio"" day and I was sorely mistaken. But GREAT workout.",1381449600,2,204,4.256410256410256
5832546,3,B00DLX76GY,"I have the Mat workout and I absolutely love it.  It's pretty comprehensive and most of the leg and bottom exercises are doable.  I like the format in the Toning CD since you can choose which workout you want to do, i.e. arms, legs, etc. and just go there, so that is an improvement. Also, she marks the transitions really well. Liked the arms and abs.  Don't care for the legs and butt exercises, it's just too much work and it becomes boring after a while.  I remembered my ballet days of constant repetitions (not fun!).  I think I'd like more music and dance like exercises.  I'd suggest having another trainer, who can show a less advanced version for the legs, especially plank poses since you can really injure yourself if you don't know what you're doing. The same would apply for being on your knees for a long time. Didn't like that at all, pretty boring. There are other exercises that can achieve the same results and can be done standing up or with the chair. I think exercises have to be fun and easy to follow so you look forward to doing them. Otherwise, they are just torture, and don't have the time for that :-). I don't believe in ""no pain, no gain.""  That's for masochists :-) and I have been exercising most of my life.",1381276800,5,1241,4.393013100436681
5832547,5,B00DLX76GY,"Great DVD. Easy to follow and it makes you sore, so you know it's working. I love how it is broken into segments so you don't have to do the whole DVD if you don't want to.",1381276800,,172,3.675675675675676
5832548,4,B00DLX76GY,I have several of Tracy's DVDs and they can be a challenge to follow the first few times through. This one was really easy to follow along with and still provided a challenging workout. My favorite of her videos so far.,1381276800,,219,4.365853658536586
5832549,3,B00DLX76GY,"I was really looking forward to this DVD as I read that she corrected herself by counting reps and explaining the moves.

While Tracy does explain things better in this one and she counts (even if the rep counts are voice-overed in (if that's a word)), these 4 workouts are boring as she does 20-40 reps per exercise.  I've done it twice now and I'm already not looking forward to doing it again as I find myself bored counting doing all of the reps!!!

There are 4 fifteen minute sections - Arms, Abs, Butt and Thighs.  You need some light weights (3 and 5 lbs), ankle weights, a mat and a chair.

At the end of the workout I'm sweaty and my abs have been sore the next day but again, zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.",1381104000,4,707,4.325757575757576

5832551,5,B00DLX76GY,When I first saw tracy new dvd I thought what the heck I have metermorphise and the mat workout so why would this be different. I in for a rude awakening. I think this is her hardest workout ever and very effective i was dripping sweat by the time i was done. I'm in good shape but want to tone up a little bit more so I will update after a month. I highly recommend this.,1379548800,20,372,3.9078947368421053
5832552,4,B00DLX76GY,"I received the DVD on a Monday, did it on Tuesday and two days later I'm still in pain. The squats that she makes you do with the leg series really, really burn your thighs and legs. I still can't walk properly! I'm sure the muscles will eventually get used to this, but I can't see doing this 30 days straight without a lot of pain the first week or so. I've always loved her arm series so that part is pretty easy for me, but the legs and butt series is tough! It is a great workout though, sweat-wise. I was sweating bullets after I was done, like I'd been in the gym for an hour.",1379548800,3,583,3.9914529914529915
5832553,5,B00DLX76GY,"I ordered this DVD after reading positive reviews on Amazon.  I own the Mat Workout and Meta Omnicentric.  This is a great addition to my Tracy Anderson collection.  As other viewers mentioned, Tracy offers cues / instruction throughout the entire DVD.  It allowed me to ensure my form was correct and I can apply what I learn from this DVD to my other DVDs.  The ab work (especially the planks at the end) was more difficult than the Mat workout and a welcome change.  Tracy's suggestion to add ankle weights to the butt section is a great idea and her use of 5 lb weights at the end of the arms section was surprising and effective.

It is clear from this DVD that Tracy read other reviews complaining of the lack of instruction ... she nailed it with this one.",1379462400,10,763,4.4071428571428575
5832554,4,B00DLX76GY,"Love the Tracy Anderson method! I like the way her method tones the arms without leaving you with bulky, manly arms.. However, I wish there was a way to go straight to the workout rather than having to fast forward through the talking parts. After 1 or 2 times, you don't really need the instructions any longer.",1379376000,9,312,4.491228070175438

I have tried hundreds of workout types and Tracy is the best for me and her method works to keep my figure lean and feminine- even after having three children.  I bulk easily even though I was told over and over by ""experts"" that there is no such thing! (I eat a moderate diet mostly lean meats and high fiber: rice, oatmeal, granola.  Occasional pasta and potato, lots of fruits and veggies and usually allow myself two serving of a treat each day.)",1518134400,4,613,4.304347826086956

she takes time to explain actually.

then arms have tough and effective moves ( I don't prefer much the arms of the omnicentric metamorphosis) and long enough to feel challenged.

The legs and butt is TOP..I ADOOORE that the pegs are worked out standing and on the mat..

the butt section is with ankle weight ( unlike the metamorphosis) and is TOUGHEST moves i have ever done..after 1session i saw already a lifted shape !!!!!! no joke

Finally i really like the abs and it is tough.
