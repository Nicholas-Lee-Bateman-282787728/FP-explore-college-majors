8655513,5,B00K317MV6,I love this sketch comedy group. The show is great...and yeah. Bummed it only lasted 2 seasons. Check out the video they made of their response to not getting a 3rd season. It is hilarious.,1455926400,,189,4.428571428571429
8655514,5,B00K317MV6,Perfect comedy. The Birthday Boys are a stellar sketch group and the 1st season here has some amazing sketches and concepts. Very re-watchable.,1453852800,,143,5.260869565217392
8655515,5,B00K317MV6,"This is a group of some of the funniest guys on TV I swear.  I got a real kick out of each of their topic's they mock. This DVD just didn't last long enough for me, I wanted more! Can't wait for next season. VERY innovative comedy that will have you laughing anytime you think of an episode. One of my favorites was ""Goofy Roofer's"", these guys flat crack me up. Give them a shot and you'll be glad you did.",1421539200,,407,4.0246913580246915
8655516,5,B00K317MV6,"""Are there too many shows? Yes. Do you have to watch them all? ..... Yeah. So get started"". There is no better place to start than The Birthday Boys. This sketch comedy series is the funniest new show out there, and definitely in the top ten funniest shows of all time. The Birthday Boys is a MUST for fans of Mr. Show, Comedy Bang! Bang! and The Ben Stiller Show. I watched the entire series on IFC when it aired, then re-watched it when it was added to Netflix. My main reason for buying the DVD, aside from supporting an excellent comedy team, was to listen to the episode commentaries. I have always thought that the Mr. Show commentaries are just as good (and sometimes better) than the episodes themselves, and was hoping for something similar from The Birthday Boys. I was not disappointed. The commentaries are hilarious, informative, and more than I could have hoped for. Visit Tim's Sweat Corner, learn which sketches were ""too Birthday Boys"" for Comedy Bang! Bang!, and discover why Mitch is everyone's least favorite (j/k, I love you Mitch!). In addition to excellent commentaries, the DVD has deleted scenes and live stage versions of sketches which are worth watching multiple times. You may be thinking that this show is just TV versions of Birthday Boys live shows, but guess again. There are tons of ""freshies."" I strongly recommend that all fans of ""alt comedy,"" sketch shows, and all-around-awesome things get this DVD as soon as possible. I can't wait for season two!",1408406400,8,1487,4.767441860465116
