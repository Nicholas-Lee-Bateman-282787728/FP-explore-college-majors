Waited for this DVD for over a year because it was hard to get but wow! What an amazing rendition .
If you never heard or saw this, is time for any music lover to get their hands of a copy while you can.
You won't regret it!",1489449600,,380,4.148648648648648
8199826,5,B000RA85Q4,"Amazing show.  This band is one of the best ever and they do a spot on job of covering one of the best albums ever.  I do wish the video would have been a bit better, but it's still a 5-star review",1427155200,,197,3.6666666666666665
8199827,5,B000RA85Q4,"What can I say, they nail it. These guys are so professional , great choice of albums to cover.",1422662400,,95,4.052631578947368
8199828,5,B000RA85Q4,Awsome Dvd i think Dream Theater did great job doing cover band Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon!!!,1405209600,,99,4.2631578947368425
8199829,5,B000RA85Q4,"As lifetime Pink Floyd fan 68 yrs old. And a dream theater fan, I was blown away by this dvd. The almost exactness of their playing is superb, and is a tribute to Pink Floyd. The playing was great, and vocals both by the female singer and James is superb. Only wish they would do more Pink Floyd albums. ""Pulse"" and ""The Wall"" come to mind. Highly recommend.",1394409600,2,358,4.279411764705882
8199830,4,B000RA85Q4,"This isn't so much Dream Theatre version of dark side of the moon. as a re-enactment of Pink Floyd. It is so close to the original as to show none of Dream Theatre's own quite impressive interpretation and ideas.

Put it this way, this is closer to the original Pink Floyd album than entire rendition of Dark Side of the Moon on Pink Floyd's own Pulse DVD.

So what we have is an excellent band proving they can make an almost prefect performance of a Pink Floyd album.  It sure shows their respect for the album and Pink Floyd, but it is just a recreation not a new interpretation.",1365120000,6,582,4.321100917431193
8199831,5,B000RA85Q4,"very well done
after the normal concert, another  unbeleiveable 45 minutes, showing what inspired Dream Theater
(amongst others)
instead of over the top, a very accurate interpretation of  ""the dark side""
including vintage  synths and  drums
guest performers on voice and sax",1355702400,3,275,5.476190476190476
8199832,3,B000RA85Q4,"It wasn't quite what I expected but it's still Pink Floyd Music, and you just can't beat that.  Must have been DreamTheatres favorite music too.",1301443200,,144,4.76
