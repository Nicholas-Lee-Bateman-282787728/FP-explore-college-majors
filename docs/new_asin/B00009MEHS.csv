7991493,3,B00009MEHS,"The movies are decent quality, and fine for wasting an afternoon. None of them are really stand out classics though.

My main complaint about this DVD is the false advertising on the case. Not malicious, but obviously the company put no effort at all into this product. The case lists the 1938 Tex Ritter classic ""Utah Trails"" including its complete cast and summary. Unfortunately the movie on the disc is the 1945 Roy Rogers movie ""Utah"" which is unrelated. There are other similiar mistakes as well.

It isn't enough to condemn this DVD, but it shows the sort of effort that this company puts into these releases.",1092528000,3,616,4.747663551401869
