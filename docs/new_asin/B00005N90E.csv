7946481,5,B00005N90E,"Three reasons why Jack Nicholson is regarded as one of the all time greats.  ""The Pledge"" was the reason I bought this package of three.  It not only showed Nicholson in an edgy role, the cameos were all outstanding.  I think his scene in the church during the ""Witches of Eastwick"" film is probably one of his comedic best, all time.  His role in the ""One Flew Over"" film has stood the test of time.  The triolgy is well worth the outstanding price.",1191974400,2,450,4.373493975903615
