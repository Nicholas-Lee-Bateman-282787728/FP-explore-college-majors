8278689,4,B00004STDY,"Hey guys Goku's back.  I recomend that you see this tape as confortable as posible. Because our mysterious friend will revele to Goku why is he here.  Not only that he will tell him about his origin (how is it posible, that he  is a Super Saiyan?)  Well, he will tell who his parents are..or is it will  be?  When you found out you will be shock to the core.  It really a tape  you are going to enjoy",955929600,6,400,3.9746835443037973
