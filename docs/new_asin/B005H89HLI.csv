4699090,5,B005H89HLI,"Well written, well acted, and well done. Even the painful ending is worthwhile and (on some level) satisfying. Obviously, if you don't buy and watch this one you'll never know what you're missing. However, you will be missing out because it takes you on a journey like nothing you could imagine. At every turn, just when you think you have things figured out, it takes an unexpected twist that leaves you stunned and surprised.

I recommend this one to those looking for a deep story with characters that grow and develop with every one of the forty-nine days.",1341878400,2,560,4.714285714285714
4699091,5,B005H89HLI,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this Korean Drama.  First, let me warn you - you will need a box or two of tissue nearby.  Yes, there are funny, lighthearted moments but you WILL shed tears.

Ji-Hyun has the perfect life or so it seems.  She comes from a loving wealthy family, her friends adore her, and she is days away from marrying the perfect man. On the other side of town, Yi-Kyung is a woman who cannot recover from the death of her boyfriend.  Suicide is constantly on her mind.  She works the night shift at a convenient store, while sleeping in the afternoons.

On a fateful day, Yi-Kyung gets off a bus and attempts to kill herself by walking into oncoming traffic, resulting in a massive car pile-up. However, before the bus can strike her, somebody saves her life by pulling her back. At this moment, Ji-Hyun, who is driving nearby, fails to hit her brakes in time and collides into a semi truck that is stopped in the middle of the road. Ji-Hyun walks out of her car in a daze and is shocked to see her body being carted into an ambulance. The only person who seems to notice her standing in the road is a young man on a motorcycle known as the Scheduler (aka the Grim Reaper). Ji-Hyun follows her body to the hospital where she now lays in a coma. Ji-Hyun meets the Scheduler again who informs her that since it was not her scheduled time to die, she is given the opportunity to recover from her vegetative state and live. That is, if she succeeds in her mission: she must gather three genuine teardrops from three people who truly love her (apart from her family) within the next 49 days. Instantly, she thinks of her fiance and two best friends and is certain she will live again. Ji-Hyun takes over the body of the suicidal Yi-Kyung in her quest to find three geniune tears. However, she soon discovers that what looks storybook perfect isn't always true.

I loved the Scheduler played by Jung Il Woo.  He was outstanding!  The interaction he had with Ji-Hyun (like getting annoyed with her for always pestering him) was hilarious and sincere. I also loved Han Kang (Ji-Hyun's friend from high school).  He was so distant and cold but you knew deep down he cared for her.  You wanted to protect Ji-Hyun because she was so trusting and truly a kind-hearted person.  And Yi-Kyung, you just wanted her to recover from her anguish over the loss of her boyfriend.  The other actors in this K-Drama were excellent.  There is loyality, lots of betrayal, and surprises in this series. I definitely will be watching this DVD set again.  But like I mentioned before, be prepared to weep.  You will be emotionally exhausted after each episode.",1341014400,6,2638,4.52
4699092,5,B005H89HLI,"I am cautious watching straight up melodramas these days because I've seen a lot of them... How many times can you go over the same typical plot and still manage to surprise? Well they finally presented something new in 49 Days with a twist of fantasy. It is unique where the main character gets into an accident and is given 49 days to borrow someone else's body. She needs to find three people who truly loved her so she can continue living. There are tons of sad moments that make you think about life, friends, family, and remind you to appreciate the time you have. All of the characters are excellent and there are no overly-pretentious, contrived plot lines (except maybe with the father). The soundtrack is awesome...many different ballads in here unlike some series that recycle the same 1-2 songs over and over. Jo Hyun Jae also sings one of the songs and he did a great job. I was surprised he could sing that well. If you're looking for a relaxing and interesting romance k-drama to watch, 49 Days is the one to get.",1332201600,3,1028,4.532258064516129
4699093,5,B005H89HLI,I bought this for my mother who loves Korean Drama movies.  I watched this one with her.  Scenery is beautiful.  Story is sad and happy.  It is a clean cut story with no violence and a charming way to deliver how life's moments just are.  I recommend this one.  Amazon is the best at delivering promptly and packaging is always superior.,1331337600,3,337,4.442622950819672
4699094,5,B005H89HLI,"I bought this drama based on the review of ""Lost Wanderer"".

I just finished watching it today at 3 a.m. after crying for quite some time.

It is beautiful because it goes really deeply into your heart and makes you think about a lot of things.

About life, about real love, about loyalty, about family, about friendship, about forgivness, about death, about the things that can never be. About sadness, about self sacrifice, about happiness. About the time we have to love, really love. Love truthfully.

If you are hesitating to buy this one or not, do not hesitare any more, buy it with your eyes closed.",1326585600,8,607,4.644859813084112
4699095,5,B005H89HLI,This product is amazing. It came in very good condition and i got it almost right away. I think that it was also priced reasonably and this drama is very interesting to watch. i really like it.,1325635200,3,193,4.243243243243243
4699096,5,B005H89HLI,"Ji-Hyun is a happy-go-lucky girl from a wealthy family who just got engaged. Yi-Gyung is an orphan whose boyfriend died in a car accident some years ago right after they had a big fight. On the anniversary of her boyfriend's death, Yi-Gyung tries to commit suicide by running into the highway traffic but her psychiatrist who was following her saves her. However that leads to a massive pileup on the highway and Ji-Hyun who was passing by gets seriously injured and goes into coma.

Ji-Hyun pleads her case to the grim reaper Yi-Soo and he lets Ji-Hyun take over Yi-Gyung's body while she sleeps, and then gives her 49 days to collect real tears from 3 people outside the family members. If she succeeds she can live but she cannot reveal to anybody that it is her in Yi-Gyung's body, otherwise she dies immediately.

However when Ji-Hyun turned to her fianc Min-Ho and her best friend In-Jung, she finds out that they are secret lovers and Min-Ho's marrying Ji-Hyun was just a part of their scheme to steal her father's business and wealth. Also she learns not many people were fond of her - even though she always really meant well, people were envious of her family wealth and her naivety often put others in awkward situations.

Devastated and helpless, Ji-Hyun ends up with an old high-school classmate Gang, who has been a secret admirer of Ji-Hyun all along. Reluctant at first, Gang starts noticing Ji-Hyun's behavior in Yi-Gyung. Meanwhile as she spends time as Yi-Gyung, Ji-Hyun learns about her past, and Yi-Gyung becomes aware of Ji-Hyun's presence as well. In the race against the time as Ji-Hyun tries to thwart Min-Ho and In-Jung's scheme, save her family and herself with help from Gang, Yi-Gyung and Yi-Soo, Ji-Hyun discovers unexpected ties that connect everybody and everything that has happened to her.

This is a wonderful, rare drama that should appeal to many beyond regular TV drama audience. It strikes the right balance of many things: It is a fantasy but never outrageous. It is serious but not depressing. There is comic relief but not stupid. There is no cartoon-like villain. Even the bad guys have their reasons and are tormented by their own demons. It has a lot of twists and turns but seldom feels contrived, and it does not settle with a Disney-like easy conclusion. But the best of all, the drama is about giving, helping others, making sacrifices for others, without being preaching. There is some very good music to boot.",1321833600,17,2460,4.808510638297872
4699097,5,B005H89HLI,"This is a sweet, albeit somewhat sad, Korean movie w/good acting, characterization, and storyline,  It ranks among my top 10 favorite, and should you purchase too ....you might agree!",1374796800,,183,5.310344827586207

I absolutely Love it.",1367798400,,196,4.324324324324325
4699099,5,B005H89HLI,"Not what I was expecting from Jung Il Woo at all.  This was hands down an AWESOME movie.  The entire cast not only Jung Il Woo, were exceptional at protraying grief, disblief, compassion, remorse and a host of other emotions.  I loved every moment of this movie.  Once you start watching, you will not be able to stop until you get to the last DVD.  Jung Il Woo, does it with his eyes. The way he looks at the other cast of characters when he's delivering his parts, really says it all.  The music was really nice for this DVD also. The English translations are very good, and you do get some behind the scenes with this DVD, which was a nice touch.  I highly recommend this DVD, you want regret it!",1365984000,,699,4.25

4699101,5,B005H89HLI,"My favorite Korean drama of all time. There are so many things going on within the storyline. I also like how all of the 'side characters' have background stories and real involvement in the plot. The acting is superb.

I've even given this as a gift. I'll use it to introduce friends/family to foreign drama and they can't believe that you can have such a good story that's something the whole family can watch.",1364601600,,412,4.5675675675675675

4699104,5,B005H89HLI,"First, I agree with about everything written about this amazing Korean fantasy-drama.

Yes, get the Kleenex box ready. I am a big, tough Tarantino-action-movie-kind-of-guy, but this series just melted me. It touched me so deeply that I was surprised at my own reactions to it. Sure, I cried... about 9 times at least. Proud of it...

Is this series perfect? Naw, not a bit. Our lead actress has that wide-eyed stare down so good she can kinda get on the nerves... but only for a second.

And that theme song, sometimes seemingly played at the wrong moments, was also played just a bit too often.

But those are minor distractions. This series is so powerful in its emotions, and its themes of love, spiritual strength, foregiveness and redemption that everyone should see it.

It is uplifting, and yes, at the same time heartbreaking.

The cast is amazing. I can't say enough for how well each charactor is played. I loved how the first 30 minutes of the first episode was such a deception - almost no one was who you thought they were.

I am rewatching it now, and believe me, it gets better with a second viewing. (Some of those subtitles, while very good for a Korean TV program, move by quickly).

There are plenty of good twists, turns and surprises here to satisfy anyone, and while 20 episodes of just over an hour each does seem a stretch... 49 Days rarely drags.

The message of 49 Days? There is good in all of us, and for all of us. And there is hope for all of us, no matter what our sins.

Highly, highly, highly recommended. Perhaps the best TV drama I have ever watched.",1357171200,2,1585,4.491289198606272

8472774,5,B005H89HLI,"A truly incredible and unforgettable miniseries. Make sure to purchase the YA Entertainment (unfortunately now out of print) release if you want full screen, good picture and sound quality, and good subtitles.",1412553600,,209,5.5625
8472775,5,B005H89HLI,"Is it not our inevitable death that gives our life some meaning? What happens if that inevitability turns imminent?

At its core, this drama is about love, forgiveness, and redemption. Don't all meaningful relationships involve all three?

This is perhaps the most original drama I have ever seen. There are situations in this drama which I have never seen before because of the nature of the characters. The main character for example, played so wonderfully by Lee Yo Won who is perhaps the most talented Korean actress of her age group, has two souls. But one soul cannot reveal herself. The result is everyone, including the main character, rationally concludes the main character has multiple personality disorder!

49 days itself has a deep meaning in Buddhism as they believe dead people's souls wander for 49 days on earth prior to going to the next life.

But 49 days also has a strong metaphorical meaning. Life is short. Achieving what are seemingly easy things, such as having 3 true friends/lovers in your life, can be very difficult. ""People would never want to attend their own funeral while having the ability to see the hearts and minds of others"", says the Grim Reaper, ""because people would realize how few really loved them"".

Maybe we should all live our lives as if we only have 49 days to live and strive to have least 3 people who truly loves us (outside of family) in order to prolong our lives.

This drama can also be hilarious. The comedy comes out of nowhere to delight the audience with laughter. There is no slapstick comedy here but of situational comedy where only the audience understands the nuances of each other's mindset and becomes aware of how ironic the circumstances are.

All the characters, even the antagonists, are highly likable at certain levels. There is no dumbed-down ""evil"" character for the sake of being evil. ""Why did you betray me?"" asks the main character to her best friend. The best friend replies ""You always thoughtlessly provided me things without regard for my feelings and needs. You never asked me what I needed or how I felt. You simply gave things you wanted and that always made you feel superior and better than me. You thought you were just being a good friend. But I felt humiliated that I had to rely on friends like you!"" The psychology of this drama is real.

This drama had high ratings in Korea. The only reason why it wasn't a major blockbuster hit was perhaps because the drama did not have strong star-power in its cast. But don't let that deter you from watching this gem.

Pros:
1)Highly unique drama with strong script and cast.
2)The situational comedy of this drama is some of the best I have ever seen. This drama can be quite funny.
3)The drama hits on all emotional cylinders. You will experience a lot of different emotions.
4)Highly likable characters. Even the antagonists are somewhat likable. It becomes really easy to care for the characters.
5)This drama makes you think about the deeper things in life. Are you sure you have your priorities in place? Watch this drama and you would know.

Pros:
1)The drama went about 2 episodes too long. But I am being picky here. Every episodes had its gems.
2)The drama doesn't start to get interesting until about the end of the 2nd episode.
4)The last plot twist (involving siblings) was both unconvincing and unnecessary.",1410393600,,3355,4.759036144578313
