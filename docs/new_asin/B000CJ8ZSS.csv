8099133,1,B000CJ8ZSS,"I think that is awesome that this item is out, but I have concerns that this is a copyrighted product, and that the seller could get into some major trouble selling this product, especially at that high of a price.  Just be careful.",1140480000,2,232,4.395348837209302

8099135,4,B000CJ8ZSS,"If you see an ad for ""all 190"" such as this, the picture quality will be as stated by the first reviewer. I bought this set elsewhere, and the menus, picture, and everything are exactly as stated here. This is NOT an official release(if you catch my drift)! Only about half of the episodes are available on commercial DVD, and those are copy protected, so even if one has a way around the security features when copying them, that still leaves half unavailable commercially, unless one copies them from TV, as all these sets were(at least in part). Mine was copied mostly from WPWR, Ch. 50 from Chicago, except for the ones that are out on DVD, which seems to be the source for most of the Curly, and some of the Shemp episodes. The picture quality is mostly better than one finds on commercial budget DVD's. One Joe Besser episode, ""Spaceship Sappy"", was below par(It was taken from TBS), but still very much viewable. All of the Joe Besser episodes were taken from TV, as they have never been released in any format.",1135641600,13,1018,4.538043478260869
