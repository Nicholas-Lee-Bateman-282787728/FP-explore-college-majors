811725,3,6304214421,"Two fun movies with a couple of over-the-hill but still funny classic comediens.  Ann Margret is great as the live live to the fullest new neighbor, and Burgess Meredith has a very funny small role as the  over-sexed father of Jack Lemmon's character.  Sophia Loren is classic as  the sexy new arrival, and good showings by Darryl Hannah and others you  will recognize.  Nothing new or great here, but fun movies for a Saturday  night in.",962236800,2,438,4.684210526315789
811834,5,6304214421,I love this movie as well as the first one... To see these 2 old man acting like teenagers is hysterical,1325808000,,104,4.0
811835,3,6304214421,I was looking for 2 discs in the collection like the advertising stated. This is a one disc set with a movie on each side. No widescreen format available.,1289692800,2,154,4.344827586206897
811836,3,6304214421,"Comon' Warner Home Video. Get out of the 1980s mentality of producing video products for VHS players and 19"" TVs and get into the age of DVD and large TVs. There is a huge queue of your customer's who are waiting to buy this movie in its original unmodified format.

Incidently, Warner Home Video also released the classic ""Arthur"" in full screen format only.",1139788800,8,359,4.609375
811837,4,6304214421,"This is a great pair of films.  Jack & Walter made twelve films together.  Grumpy Old Men was one of their best.  Grumpier was not.  But you should own both films as they make a nice set.

John and Max have been neighbors for years and enemies almost as long.  They have a passion in common, fishing.  In the first ice fishing and the second fresh water.

The first concerns the men competing for the attentions a sexy new neighbor (Ann-Margret).  The second concerns a woman (Sophia Loren) who is converting the boys bait shop into an italian restaurant.

Both films have more and you should look at the individual film titles for more details.  But if you like good comedy and Jack & Walter, then you should buy this pack.

The only negative for these DVD's are they are full frame and not widescreen.  But these are not spectacle films so you really are not missing much.  But I do wish they would have widescreen available.",1135728000,9,927,4.473053892215569
811838,4,6304214421,"This is a great film. I have both films on lazer disc in wide screen.

I am waiting for the DVD format in wide screen. Then I WOULD BUY them.",1134086400,6,141,3.7
811839,5,6304214421,"Jack Lemmon & Walter Matthau were awesome to watch over & over.  Just wish they would have made more movies like the Grumpy Old Men series & the Odd Couple I & II.  These movies you can watch over & over again. They still make you laugh over & over & over. It even means more now that both of them have past away.  The world has lost 2 wonderful actors. I would highly recommend these to anyone who likes comedies & needs to laugh-very funny. Out to Sea was another good movie.  These movies should be a part of your movie collection. You never get tired of watching these movies. They are a part of my collection & are worth it.
It is good to laugh after a long day. I would give it 10 stars if it was possible.
Make it a movie night & pop some popcorn-kick back, relax & get ready for a fun night.",1077062400,6,799,4.0062893081761
811840,3,6304214421,Amazon was the only place I found those films. Amazon sent the films to Sweden with a decleration upon package total cost 37$. I had to pay about 10$ extra for customs fees (customs even charged postal fees!!!). I shall never more order films from the US. (Unless I can find a ways to go round customs). Amazon was great and quick delivery - Swedish customs fees for private import SUCKS.,1072656000,3,388,4.47887323943662

811842,5,6304214421,I gave these movies 5 stars because you just want to keep watching them over and over again.  My favorite out of the two is Grumpier Old Men.  That movie is very funny.  Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau do a great job in this movie.  They both have a funny side but also some very sad parts.  These two movies have the combinations to make them my favorite moveies.,981158400,5,363,4.202898550724638
811843,5,6304214421,"Both of these ""Grumpy Old Men""  movies showcase two acting veterans at their best. Lemmon and Matthau have never been funnier in these  two very enjoyable films....they will make you forget the major dissapoinment of The Odd Couple 2....It's too bad that we will never enjoy a third enstallment of these grumpy guys, but what a legacy of work they both have separate and together that we can enjoy over and over again.....",969062400,4,422,4.767123287671233
7865251,5,6304214421,"Anytime Im feeling depressed or sad, these films are my go to cure.  Theres something about these movies that evoke feelings of happiness.  Underneath all the humor in these films, the characters remind us of whats most important in life -  laugh when facing adversity. Its the only way to remind ourselves that well always struggle sometimes, but it doesnt mean we cant make the best out of it.",1525392000,,395,4.695652173913044
