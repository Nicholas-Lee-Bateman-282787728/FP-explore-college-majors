7429349,3,B0157757NK,"I have no idea where they get this movie was 5 stars. 3/5 as being watchable once. The story is good, the demon makeup I thought was not very good. It was not scary at all. Sort of a Sci Fi / horror Drama with some sex and violence. There is full nudity in the flick and graphic violence but if it did not have those it would of been a ScyFy channel movie.",1446163200,,356,3.824324324324324
7429350,3,B0157757NK,Nice practical effects. Interesting premise limited by odd pacing and so-so acting. Still recommended if you want some fantastical horror noir.,1445817600,3,143,5.857142857142857

7429353,5,B0157757NK,"This film was recommended by a good friend of mine. I started following some of the ""behind-the-scenes"" stuff, because I was curious what went into making a movie (*I believe it is filmed in parts of L.A.) - which is really awesome! Firstly, the make-up & actor ""get-ups"" are really cool to check out. Reminds me of Face-Off - The show where people compete for make-up contracts & special effects. Like pretty much take the winners of that show, put them all in a room.. and design the amazing cosmetics for this movie. Smart script & entertaining too! I took a chance & just bought the movie on a whim, actually a pretty sweet investment. Perfect for Halloween parties too! Nicely done Fire City Crew!",1444089600,3,702,4.624
7429354,5,B0157757NK,"This movie is terrifying in the best way possible. I highly recommend for a movie night and especially for Halloween. The writing is smart, imaginative and refreshing...However, beware and sleep with one eye open (or two).",1443398400,6,222,5.194444444444445

7429356,5,B0157757NK,"Like Nightbreed meets Pans Labyrinth, what lacks in budget makes up in unique storytelling. Pacing is slow but so are noir films. A hidden gem.

7429363,4,B0157757NK,"There was something about this movie I actually liked.  First, I've never seen anything like it.  Yes, there's always a ""demon amongst us"" film somewhere.  But this isn't one of those lame flicks.  This actually has something going for it.

Not only is it unique in how the demon amongst us is presented but the acting is pretty decent and the script is much better than many ""big dollar"" films.",1503446400,,395,4.585714285714285
7429364,5,B0157757NK,"I saw the initial ratings and am now pretty surprised by how low they are. The characters are good and the story is interesting. I'm still rolling the ending around in my mind because it's not something that is easily understood. This may be why it has some negative reviews, but I think the depth of thought and feeling necessary to watch this movie is my main attraction to it. I even liked the prosthetics. I think they fit the feel very well. I didn't pay much attention to special effects because I don't think there were many, but this movie is good despite them being mediocre(if you think they are). The story alone drives it enough that I didn't even pay attention to them. I will watch this more than once and that is not something I would do with many movies.",1503100800,,770,4.391608391608392

7429369,5,B0157757NK,"Low budget films are not for everyone so if you value flawless costumes and special effects then chances are good that this movie is NOT for you. For the most part the acting was great and the story was interesting, with a few time fillers. If they had they dragged the movie out any longer using fillers I would have subtracted a star from it. This is a film I wouldn't mind watching again.",1499558400,,391,4.297297297297297
7429370,4,B0157757NK,I honestly have passed this one up multiple times...but today I watched it. Has some great meanings hidden inside the movie and even though it was low budget I thought it was not a waste of time...and I may watch again in the future.  IF you are looking for a blockbuster movie NOT it...but if you are looking for a rainy day movie and you do not go into it expecting tooo much then give it a try you may be surprised...,1497830400,,420,4.121951219512195
7429371,4,B0157757NK,"I will say this... don't let the cover fool you. Though there is action in this film, it's more just guys hitting each other and seeing someone shoot/slice someone and then the scene cutting over to the person bleeding. Also the makeup and special effects are a hit and miss. I like Vine's facial makeup, but I found his hands to be a little weird, because only three of his fingers on both hands were particularly long, and in some scenes it looks as though the makeup artists left them off for whatever reason. Some of the other characters looked really good, and others looked really bad (like the elephant looking guy and the horned demon at the club). There is a fair amount of light gore, that frankly looked very silly. The acting though I thought was pretty good, and though there were some plot holes, the writing wasn't bad.

SLIGHT SPOILERS: That being said, I did actually find this film interesting and liked it. Now, part of the reason I like this film is because I love stories with a redeemable character in it, which is what this film is about. The film tells a story about a demon who develops a conscious after ""saving"" a little girl from being raped by her mother's boyfriend; and coming to realize that that is what is happening to him throughout the film. I found the twist climax/ending was pretty interesting, though slightly predictable after a point. The plot is a little confusing at times, and you sometimes wonder why a particular scene was even included. But in a convoluted way it all makes sense to a certain degree.

In truth, this film is not perfect and is not for everyone. But if you like a film that is about a redeemable character and can forgive a film for it's flaws; then I highly recommend it. If you're not into redeemable character stories, or can't forgive a film for its flaws, then don't watch it; or watch it to say you watched it and be done with it.",1495324800,3,1900,4.472622478386167
7429372,5,B0157757NK,Very Very cool... It makes you think. Not at all what was expected and done well on the budget. A good watch,1494201600,,108,3.9545454545454546
7429373,4,B0157757NK,Great stuff. Atum Vine reminds me of a Daedra from Elder Scrolls video game. Cool make-up and effects given that it's a low-budget/indie film. Atum and Cornelia were believable characters and very expressionate. Cool story although you really have to pay attention or you'll miss it. 4 stars. Thanks.,1493510400,,300,5.142857142857143
7429374,5,B0157757NK,"What an interesting movie!

More than anything else, this film reminds me of some of the best fantasy/RPG video games I played as a kid.  This is not an easy movie to follow - you have to put effort into it; and if you do so, you will enjoy the movie so much more.

The characters are fascinating, the actors range from good to extremely good, and the overarching story is very cool.

So glad I got to see this movie!",1492214400,2,417,4.111111111111111
7429375,3,B0157757NK,"Don't know why I liked this film. The special effects were slightly above average. The actors makeup was limited to their faces and hands( for the most part.) That being said, the story line was interesting, Demons needed human misery to sustain them and something was changing the status quo. The characters were not one dimensional, and were somewhat engaging. I think this is one of the better free Amazon Prime horror movies.",1489104000,2,429,4.890410958904109

My guess is that the film is too difficult for most people to understand. Weird, huh? Interesting story line, creditable acting, excellent production values for a limited budget.

7429393,5,B0157757NK,The 1 stars must be from people who didn't bother watching the film.  I thought it was great.  Actors were satisfactory and the production worked within its budget.  The film is basically a detective/film noir movie with a demon twist.  Make-up reminded me of the demons on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and there ain't nothing wrong with that.  Pacing is typical of the genre.  The twist at the end is unexpected.  Worth at least the one hour and twenty or so minutes the movie runs.

I feel like people focused too much on one thing here or there, and while this movie probably didn't have the biggest super duper budget with millions of dollars I think it pulled through for a win. I think this movie was original, interesting, scaled (if that makes sense), and very entertaining. It also made me think a little. Aside from not 100 percent understanding the ending, as to who exactly the ""bad guy"" was, I feel that this movie was awesome and well worth my time.

I watched it on Prime, but will actually buy it to have. There are some flaws in the film- minor plot holes, inconsistent writing, but overall a solid effort. Much, much better than most of the SyFy (SciFi) channel movies. You could tell it was made on a small budget, but it still worked for me. Nice mixture of Lovecraft, Barker, Hellblazer, Sandman, and Noir. Another film with Vine would be cool.

But the film does t explain why the demons are in our world it doesn't give you any back ground on any of them. The demons are more human than anything. Vine the main character in this whole fiasco looks like a tree root. When he flexed his wings they look like a pop tent. I didn't take the movie too seriously.

Pushing a disturbing vibe. Like assaulting a child. I'm not a fan of such things, but the slaps and general menace are well portrayed. Real creature effects are always good to see, and there are a lot of them. But I felt like some didn't do well, like long fingers wrapped around gun grips, or faces not reading well in the dark lighting. In the end, it's ok. Effort was put into it, maybe crammed into it.

Monster masks being manipulated digitally because there was no money to make the mouth move practically. The red wings near the end looked like a kids Halloween costume.

7429557,4,B0157757NK,"Atum Vine (Tobias Jelinek) is the leader or feeder of a group of demons who live in an LA apartment complex that contains a lot of sin, fear, and misery which feeds the demons. Prostitution, drugs, domestic issues abound which allows the demons to sate. Then one day things change. All the fear and misery is gone. The would-be child rapist is reformed and out looking for a job. The demons are in a panic. They are not allowed to leave the complex, and their food supply is running low.

About 70 minutes into the film we find out what happened to cause the change and there is also a twist.

The production did a decent job on the make-up. That is what really made the film. Almost all the scenes were in the apartment building which played against the promise of the title ""Fire City"" a city that didn't play into the movie. Nor is this an end of days film or a battle for Earth. Those expectations will lead to a disappointment. It is about demons in an apartment complex. Human see them as humans, not demons.

A decent film for what it was and not for how it was marketed. The film is about overcoming your demons and finally becoming human.

7429686,3,B0157757NK,"I'm probably more forgiving than most moviegoers when it comes to cryptic and/or non-linear stories. Fire City is both.

These are demons, immortal -- as long as they can feed on human misery. With immortality comes a different timescape.

When we first meet Vine in voice over, he says something about the patron saint of lost children. Remember this for later. (In case you haven't noticed, I'm being deliberately cryptic.)

Vine then proceeds to come to the defense of a young girl who's about to be molested. Vine's a demon, but she sees him -- as all people do, unless pricked -- as a gun-toting human. Does he save her? It seems like he did, but maybe not. (Remember, it's not linear.)

Right after this incident, everything changes in the apartment building where Vine and his fellow demons live. Suddenly, this hell-hole of depravity and corruption turns ""nice"" and as a result the demons face starvation. Vine is convinced the change was caused by a powerful demon from the netherworld. The local demon-witch thinks it's a virus. A noirish detective story ensues as Vine tries to find the culprit. At the same time, the other demons try to induce more misery in the humans. Remember, unless they prick a person, they appear to humans as human.

In the end, Vine chooses between humans and demons. The big question is, when exactly did he choose?

There's a great line in the awesome movie, Jacob's Ladder, delivered by Danny Aiello, who plays the chiropractor. It goes something like this: ""If the demons that are frightening you are trying to scare you to a better place, then they're not really demons, they're angels.""

Demons. Angels. It's a fuzzy line.

What it lacks in big-budget effects it compensates with convincing acting and a solid plot that makes you want to be convinced.  3/4 of the way through I thought I would be giving this five stars.  A lot of solid talent and imagination went into this film.  You will enjoy it.  Mostly.

It's only a 3 because...well... it all just stopped. The story just stopped.  Who was the red bird?  Why Helo? What happened/will happen to the other demons?  What is an interpreter/interpretee?  These are all questions in the movie that you would reasonably expect the resolution to...resolve.  It's doesn't.  What few answers are given do not satisfy.  Maybe they ran out of money, or they had to cut the film down for release. Not sure.

It's still worth seeing if you don't need CGI thrills to enjoy your demons.  But in the end you are left disappointed by what could have been.  This film verges on cult classic.  Then stops.

Ours, human beings.  Are we worth redemption? Are they the monsters, or are we?  Is there a symbiotic relationship between us humans and our demons? What does it mean to ""feed our demons""?

7429835,1,B0157757NK,"This movie stunk!

I saw a preview of this movie and thought, this looks promising. Demons living among us, undetected by humans until they reveal themselves. It had the look of a good movie, but the plot and acting of a very, very bad movie. Spoiler Alert - I will reveal some of the plot next and my issues.

Here is the premise: there is 1 building, ONLY ONE, where apparently these demons live. But not everyone who lives in this building is a demon, just a few occupants. One is a drug dealer (the ""star"" for lack of a better term), one is a fortune teller, there are few roomate-lizards, a seductress?, a bookworm, and maybe a few more. The whole movie takes place in the crummy looking apartment building. Some backstory would have been good, but apparently the demons are not visible to the humans residents, unless you are ""pierced"" by a demon aka scratched.

From reading another review, apparently the demons feed off of bad human behavior? That's ridiculous already. Demons should feed on souls, not just bad deeds. Then for some apparent reason, never explained, the human residents just start acting like Ned Flanders from the Simpsons, all goody-too-shoes. This causes the demons to starve and some start acting weird. At first I thought the make-up/effects looked cool, but then they all started like liking rejects from the Star Wars bar. The fortune teller was bad at her job because she couldn't see everything that was about to happen. The ""star"" was somehow connected or attacted to a young girl (like really young) who lived in the building. That made no sense.

All of a sudden the story was all over the place, most of it not making much sense. Said lizard-roomates attack each other, the seductress just strips in front of a couple trying to seduce them and it didn't work, in the script and in real life, the star goes back and forth between trying to find ""a killer (IT IS NOT A DISEASE..is uttered several times)"" and continuing his weird relationship with the young girl. Not much makes sense or goes on throughout this film. There isn't any action, there isn't any suspense, there isn't any horror (just horrible acting and a horrible script).

The cover is the best part about this movie and all the other reviews have to be fake, because this movie stunk. You WILL get bored at just looking at the demons, basically doing nothing cool. A perfect example, the main demon pierces the young girl and she sees him as how he really is, while they sit on her bed. She isn't terrified and then he reveals his demon wings, to which she replies ""so you're like a bird-man"" and which he replies ""yes"". SLOW CLAPS. BRAVO....CRICKETS

This was the most deceiving of films. It started out looking cool, and just went downhill from there. I really didn't understand the plot. FYI the villain makes no sense either, what is he or her?..SPOILER...a little red bird...WTF

Anyone looking for a cool monster movie, I advise you to look elsewhere. Don't be fooled by all the positive reviews or the glitzy cover or preview.

7429838,4,B0157757NK,"This is one of the best non-comic book based comic book esque movies I've seen since Sam Raimi's Dark Man. The unique Horror Noir tone and stylized direction is very cool and fun to watch not to mention Tobias Jelinek absolutely kills it in this. Both as human Vine and demon Vine. Of course I can't go without out mentioning the amazing practical effects from ADI which is a big selling point for the film. Their are only a few scenes where the practical effects look shoty and one character in particular looks very cheap. This characters mouth peice actually doesn't move so they had to use computer effects to warp the film around his mouth to make it look like he's speaking and it looks really awful. Thankfully a lot of the times when he speaks the camera is away from him.
Most of the digital effects in the film look pretty bad too but there are only a few and you can look past them for the films sake. It has a very interesting premise and plot which I don't wanna give away at all since I went into it completely blind and loved it. The title is a bit clunky and non-discriptive along with the dvd cover art which makes the movie look like a cheap rip-off of Hellboy which it tooootally isn't. All in all Fire City: End of Days is a solid flick with a unique plot and a great noir atmosphere. The practical effects are astounding (aside from the one character I mentioned earlier) and the digital effects while pretty terrible can be forgiven.
I read on IMDB that this is planned to be the first installment in a 4 film series and I'm not sure if its true but I'd love to see a sequel to this. It's very aparent they had a low budget but they used it to its full extent and in creative ways. I'd honestly give this movie a 5/5 but the bad digital effects, the one characters poor design, and the obvious cheapness of the production are just to blatant. But I would highly recommend this film to anyone especially if you are a fan of comics like Hellboy, Wolf, BPRD, Hellblazer or Preacher or a fan of films like Castle Freak, the Puppet Master series or any other Moonlight films since they have the same level of Cheepness and creativity.",1449100800,,2151,4.3399503722084365

They feed off of negative human emotions and therefore live among the downtrodden and suffering. Things appear to be going swimmingly until their humans acquire grace and virtue, and, then, the protagonist demon starts getting empathy toward a young girl with a negligent mom and the mom's abusive boyfriend.

And then there's something about a demon prophet and red tarot cards that are supposed to be blue...or vice versa.

Ultimately, this is a confusing stewpot of a story.  The writers assume we know more about the backstory than we do, and I wasn't interested enough to try to deconstruct the whole thing.  The ending made no sense, in part because of the director's decision to use reverb for the voice of the character who reveals the story in a massive ""explain all"" infodump.

To me this was mainly about one demon's redemption and how he becomes infected with the love and goodness of one human girl. Since demons feed off of the negative human emotions and actions, they have to keep them in that state or starve. Upon slowly starting to care about humans and see how awesome humans can be, when not surrounded by demons, the demon called Vine, chooses to go against his fellow demons and starve himself rather than do evil to them and decides to protect them instead, deciding the rewards of love are much better.  What a wonderful unique idea for a movie.",1447632000,3,784,4.444444444444445

7429846,5,B0157757NK,"Synopsis: Vine is a typical demon that feeds off of the worst of human emotions, to get the widest array of food he lives in multistory slum building in an unknown city. Everything is going great, the demons are expecting a new Interpretee (their form of spiritual leader/diviner) when something goes wrong. The reading for the new Interpretee is ""red"", when it is supposed to be ""blue"". No one knows what this means, other than change is coming. Everything feels normal until the next morning when Vine awakes to find that all of the humans in the building are ""cured"". Not just cured, but they are ""perfect"", no greed, no want, no desire, which of course sets the demons in the building into a frenzy as they are no longer able to feed. The demons of the building take a vote and opt to send Vine out to the other buildings to see if all humans have been cured. Vine arrives at a sin club that is further in the city. Once he arrives he sees that all of the humans are normal as usual, it isn't until he stays there for a bit that all of the humans in the sin club also begin to be cured. All hell breaks loose and Vine and the rest of his ""tribe of demons"" are quarantined in their building sealed off from the outside world and forced to die a slow agonizing death. Will they find out what is behind this plague? Will they find out how they became infected with this disease that ""cures"" humans of all sins?

Selling points:Great acting considering most of the main characters are wearing masks or lots of makeup for most of the story. Interesting story line in the fact that it is told from the point of the demon and almost has the feel of a biblical rapture, though it isn't, it is much darker. Also the price of $7.99 isn't that bad.",1447027200,9,1741,4.307926829268292

7429851,3,B0157757NK,"Most of the other reviews are not....correct.  Written by people who did not watch the movie.  That is overwhelming flaw number one and perhaps one that should not ever be tolerated.....fake reviews to pump a movie.

Painful flaw numbers two and three.  The title.  The only place you see fire in this movie is on the movie poster.  Fire is not involved in any way at all.  I could have called this Taco Bell City and it would make as much sense. End of days?  Only in the last 2 minutes of the movie is that brought up and is seriously tacked on to the plot.

Painful flaw number three....the costumes are horrible.  Vine's is particularly awful.  It is explained in the movie that the demons come in various types....and then the movie does not go much at all into the various types.  Supposedly the types have something to do with negative emotions they feed off of.  The only time this is clear is with the prostitute type demon that feeds on lust.  Vine....not sure what he feeds on.

Painful flaw number four.  Vine and some of the other demons have razor sharp claws.  Yet Vine kills with a gun....cough.  And for immortal beings, the demons sure are....fragile.  Where did they come from?  No one seems to know...or to remember much beyond what happened a week ago.  There are obviously demons everywhere yet the movie focusses, not on a ""city"" but on a small run down apartment complex in the ghetto.

What exactly is going on..makes for some decent fantasy plot.  Decent acting.  Decent storyline.  Severely lacking in context.  Obviously, they ran out of budget and had to wrap it up without explaining much.  The movie is actually pretty strong right up until the last 5 minutes where it falls apart.

This was almost...almost, but not quite a good movie.  Somewhere there is a decent scriptwriter not at all happy with how this was developed.

My opinion....the move is guilty of a pretty serious crime....drawing me in and ultimately wasting my time.",1446336000,42,1964,4.657894736842105

7429854,3,B0157757NK,"If you took some talented  ""freaky costume"" designers and hooked them up with so so set designers then gave them 80 percent of a B movie budget this is the movie I would expect to get. If your a cosplay freak your most likely going to like this movie but if not not.
I wanted to give this 2 1/2 stars but didn't know how.
In the one regard it is much like the original star trek tv show in that its not that good but if you liked that kind of thing it was the only game in town.
Or as Eddie Murphy put it when your starving ""that cant be no regular saltine cracker no way that taste so good that's got to be a Ritz cracker"".
 About half way thru the movie I wondered if it was some type of reward. As in if you win the contest by making the best costume you get to be in a movie type reward. At no point in the movie did I think ""that's scary"". Its sorta like a porn movie for cosplay",1446249600,5,884,3.7989130434782608

Some weak points: Occasionally the acting got cheesy as did the FX. The makeup was spot on, but the more robust makeup job characters were way under designed to emote with their applications.

I didn't like the main hidden antagonist. Way over the top. However, the ending did resolve in a way that allowed for a sequel. I sorta want one.",1530403200,,398,4.364864864864865

It does have a unique story concept.

Combining too many different story points, can cause abit of confusion for some viewers.
