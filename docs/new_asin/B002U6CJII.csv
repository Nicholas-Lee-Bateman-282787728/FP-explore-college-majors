8381055,5,B002U6CJII,"This film breaks away from the norm of Hollywood main tream films.
It just goes to show what can be done outside the pockets of Hollywood.
This is a class film with twists from start to finish.
I recommed it to anyone who wants to view an Independent film.
5 stars from me...",1274227200,,275,4.2075471698113205
8381056,2,B002U6CJII,"I read Paul Pritchard`s review from [...], read Amazon`s Product Details and the only customer review for this movie at the time I wrote this, and was immediately sucked in to both its premise and promise. Purchased it immediately and haven`t stopped regretting it since. The characters are dispicable and two-dimensional, there is no atmosphere, the sets are insanely low budget, the cheap neon-lit enviornment becomes irritating on the eyes half-way through viewing, the soundtrack is irksome and adds nothing to the overall tone of the movie, and there is no fantasy element anywhere, unless somehow snow in Norway is now a fantasy...Paul, you must`ve received a nice sized check for penning that review. There are no plot twists or character development, anyone who`s ever seen a pulp or noir film can see the set-up coming from miles away, and the ending is horrendously disappointing. (SPOILER) The customer reviewer was ""interested in seeing where the characters go from there"" - didn`t he watch the whole flick?  They`re all dead!! This flick sucked on every conceivable level - if watching Danish trailer trash junkies and unfaithful whore-wives strut about for 85 minutes without any conflict resolution and a stupidly tacked-on ending sounds like fun to you, then by all means, grab this clunker and enjoy. Me? I`ll stick glass shards in my eyes before I suffer through this swill again.",1273449600,3,1398,5.104803493449782
8381057,5,B002U6CJII,"A darkly comic movie, brilliantly acted & with a lot of heart. A story that takes you along a path only to throw you off it again with its quirky twists. Based around believable characters and excellent dialogue this ia a movie thats both pleasing to the eye (gorgeous female co-stars!!) and pleasing to the head...and a satisfactory ending that leaves you guessing where the characters go from here. This director creates a style of his own with a zippy soundtrack blends neatly in with the stylish neon-lit background. I look forward to seeing more of this directors work very soon....independant cinema isn't meant to feel this good! Recommended........8/10.",1264204800,,661,5.073394495412844
