8582730,1,B00CJUD7UY,"Not only is he not the successor of Sijo Adriano D. Emperado, but he is not a 10th degree (that being reserved only for the 5 original founders of Kajukenbo, of which he is not!). Whatever he may have done or not done this entire basis is bogus and should not lead anyone into believing he has any say in Kajuknebo's future or it's infamous past.",1509580800,2,346,4.257575757575758
8582731,1,B00CJUD7UY,French accent was very hard to understand and there were next to nothing about white to brown belt. Seems like he was more interested in self promoting. A show off.,1423094400,,164,4.5
8582732,5,B00CJUD7UY,"Great introduction to the art of kajukenbo, even though dubbed for English speaking countrys its not noticeable, well filmed, package arrived in fast efficient manner, nil damage on arrival.",1414281600,,190,5.586206896551724
8582733,3,B00CJUD7UY,I was disappointed that only an hour of footage was included on the dvd. The dvd also goes out of focus half way through which is definitely not what I would expect. Rest of the DVD is good. Shot of techniques are all from one angle which is a bit annoying as well as you miss some of the intricacies of the techniques. Overall though a good example of Kajukenbo and the legend Angel.,1402099200,2,384,4.202702702702703
8582734,4,B00CJUD7UY,Great training DVD.  Instructional demos were very well laid out.  SGM Garcia is a great instructor!  Hope he has more instructional videos out in the market place.,1388016000,2,164,5.0
