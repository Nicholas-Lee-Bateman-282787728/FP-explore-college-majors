1054442,1,6305610096,"Most of these reviews are for a 1998 film, ""Detention"".  I was looking to find the David Carradine film, ""Detention"", a horror story.  Amazon, or somebody is goofing up these titles.  Anyway, the David Carradine film is pretty bad: dialogue like when the teens are dropping like flies and one girl, hearing sounds says: ""I wonder who that is?""  I actually turned it off about 3/4ths of way through it, hoping it would get better.  But, oh well, live and learn.",1315612800,4,460,4.62962962962963

ALSO BEING IN HIGH SCHOOL AT THE TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY MUCH WORD FOR WORD MY LIFE AS A STUDENT(I HAVE BEEN IN DETENTION QUITE A FEW TIMES MYSELF).IN THIS MOVIE THESE STEREOTYPES ARE JUST A FEW YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHILE YOU IN SCHOOL.THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE TO SHOW TO ANYBODY WHO REMINDS YOU OF A CHARACTER BEING DISPLAYED IN THIS.THIS MOVIE IS A BIG HIT WITH ME.PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE A TRY.IT WILL BE WELL WORTH IT.",1314144000,,721,4.231884057971015
1054444,5,6305610096,"I just watched the movie. From the word go, i realized its going to be scary as hell. Better then anything else out there. THIS IS REALLY SCARY FILM that is based on true facts. Great story, good looking actors, keeps you on the edge of your seat. Loved DC in the movie. (creapy to realize that he died right after doing this movie). I give it a 10+. I highly recommand you see it. this is going to be a cult film. To see it is to be part of those that recoginzed a great horror movie first. You Will enjoy it.",1310688000,2,510,3.9611650485436893
1054445,5,6305610096,"Mrs. Deakins holds a special detention class that includes Poochie (who has quite a rep with the fellas), Tenspeed (the school's basketball star), Isaiah/Black (the wannabe thug), Langston (the poet), and Acirfa (the militant girl). At first, all of them think that they have the others figured out. We as the audience think that we know what these teens are about. But Mrs. Deakins sees beyond the surface. She knows that each of them is special, each of them is unique, and each of them has more to them that what the eyes can see.

Great storyline, great acting. This is a must-see movie for those who care about the future of our youth. These teens were crying out for help in their own way. All of them just wanted to be rescued.",1208736000,4,734,4.518796992481203

1054447,5,6305610096,"The award-winning independent film ""Detention,"" which could be described as an ""urban"" Breakfast Club is a powerful.  Wharton who, wrote, directed, produced and acted in the film, is a considerable  filmmaking talent, who seems to have taken notes from fellow Baltimore  filmmakers, John Waters and Barry Levinson, by creating a world that takes  a refreshing and honest look at Baltimore teanagers.  The cast and  character development is simply brilliant.  Led by Charisse Brown as the  strong-willed and determined teacher Mrs. Deakins, who brings together five  students on a Friday afternoon because she believes they have potential. At  first glance, these high school students seem to have stereotypical  personalities, ""the thug,"" the jock,"" ""the  militant,"" ""the poet"" and ""the sex pot,"" but as  the story unfolds Wharton is able to reveal layers to these personalities  that don't fit into any mold. The students excellently played by Justin  Black as ""Black,"" Kisha Harvin as ""Poochie,"" John Hall  as ""Tenspeed,"" Kiatenai as ""Acirfa"" and Wharton himself  as ""Langston,"" come across as truely real and has some raw  moments of emotion.  Wharton who worked as a substitute teacher and was a  Staff Writer for NBC's ""Homicide: Life On The Street,"" has  brought to life a film with grace, grit and style rare in a first-time  filmmaker.  It is easy to see why this film won the ""Best Director  Award"" at the 1998 Urbanworld Film Festival and the ""Audience  Award"" at the 1998 Atlanta Film and Video Festival because it stays  with you long after the first viewing.  I would highly reccommend this film  for any parent, teacher or civic minded person who cares about the problems  facing today's young people.",948672000,13,1715,5.11231884057971

7892373,5,6305610096,A really good low budget horror film.  Creepy entertainment.  Carradine is excellent as the Principal.  Solid horrific fun with good direction and acting.,1387929600,,154,5.608695652173913
7892374,4,6305610096,Teacher don't do this anymore but if they did their students would value it... teaching is truly a calling and should be valued as such.,1387411200,,136,4.48
7892375,2,6305610096,"Detention's biggest flaw is immediately obvious- the acting is extremely bad.  *Extremely* bad.  It's reminiscent of a high school play which, since it takes place in a high school, maybe this WAS actually a high school play turned into a movie.  It's that bad.  A group of students have to spend a day in detention when suddenly a ghostly shadow figure haunts the school hallways.  You see, a high school student was burned to death back in the 70's by his fellow students, and now his vengeful spirit is roaming the hallways.  Sounds appealing right?  Based on this alone, it *is* appealing. However it's so horribly executed that it's just a cryin' shame all potential was lost.

These are all your typical high school kids that you've seen in films such as the Breakfast Club- you have the smart logical one, the angry student that likes to pick fights, the pretty boy who thinks he can get all the ladies, the quiet rebellious girl, the attractive sweatheart that uses her looks to get what she wants, etc.  Admittedly the girls are quite attractive.

When a thunderstorm intensifies to such an unrealistic extent that it's realized a ghostly figure is roaming the hallways looking for a way to get to the kids stuck in detention, this is when the storyline kicks in.  For some highly bizarre reason, the special effects used to show the misty black figure drifting through the hallways- and the ones that show figures appearing in spiritual form before suddenly disappearing- are actually *good*.  However, for some reason the lightning and intensity of the storm is really fake-looking and BAD.  The lightning looked horrendous like something you'd see in a movie from 1950.  It's *that* bad.  It's also odd how sooner rather than later it becomes nighttime.  How long *was* that detention scheduled for?

Perhaps the worst scene is when the old man (principal I assume) is running through the rain to reach his car.  It's pouring hard when suddenly, before he drives away, his seat belt tightens and you assume he's going to be strangled to death, however instead this danger suddenly goes away and he's driving away normally.  LOL!

Of course there's more to a movie than just lightning.  The kids spend their entire time falling in love and making out all the while moving from one hidden and dark location of the school to the other as a means to avoid the persistent ghostly figure that's apparently hot on their trail.  You may have guessed my complaint here- how can you possibly get the urge to make out with your girlfriend/boyfriend when a *ghost* is after you?  How?  Impossible!  Nothing can prepare you for how awful the storyline and acting is.  Trust me, besides the special effects of the ghostly monsters/figures, everything else is impossible to tolerate.  I'm generously giving the film an extra star for the quality of the special effects but that's it.  Avoid.",1372377600,,2888,4.826883910386965
7892376,5,6305610096,"I saw this movie at 1999 Howard University at the HBO Film Festival and love it instantly! I saw the movie hanging on the wall at Hollywood Movies and bought it. I own a copy on VHS, but I watch in every so often and still love the characters and the work that was presented. I would like to see this movie updated to see what happened to the characters. Really good urban film! Highly recommend!",1364256000,,396,4.223684210526316
7892377,4,6305610096,"The 90s are the new 80s and Detention wastes little time pointing this out to you. I had been looking forward to Detention for quite some time mostly because it looked so different. Unusual, original, unique; whatever you want to call it Detention is unlike anything else you've ever seen before.

Half high school comedy and half slasher horror, Detention manages to incorporate so much into its 89 minute duration. Grizzly Lake is your average town with typical high school students absolutely loathing the town they're in. The difference is that somebody is dressing up as Cinderhella; the latest slasher movie serial killer and killing students at Grizzly Lake high school. A group of students serving Saturday detention band together to not only survive, but figure out a way to still go to prom and maintain some normalcy for the remainder of their senior year.

The film begins as a narrative for the most popular girl in school Taylor Fisher (Alison Woods) before shifting gears and being the narrative for the least popular girl in school Riley Jones (Shanley Caswell). You get a Scott Pilgrim Vs the World vibe right off the bat. Visually, Detention is very bright, colorful, and vibrant. It was kind of bizarre seeing Josh Hutcherson in this. While his character of Clapton Davis isn't exactly a step in a different direction for his acting career, the film's content certainly is with all of its profanity, nudity, and graphic content. Dane Cook also seems to take a little too much pride in playing the smarmy Principal Verge.

The 90s references mostly lie within the Ione character (Spencer Locke). She's like a living, breathing version of VH1's ""I Love the 90s"" and is constantly talking about the greatest time period ever (her words, not mine). But Clapton's wardrobe looks like it came right out of that era's closet. The T-shirts he wears, the Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart sunglasses, the Converse All-Star sneakers, and the way he's always on a skateboard are the 90s personified. That's when Detention begins to shift gears again.

Somewhere along the line, Detention begins to reference Scream, Donnie Darko, The Fly, and even Back to the Future. Clapton could pass as Marty McFly's younger cousin, but there's this crazy time traveling concept thrown in there as well. Ione and her mom switch bodies and time periods like Freaky Friday and there's a freaking time traveling stuffed grizzly bear. Detention has the most movie references I've ever experienced in any one given film and somehow turns all of that into one of the most unpredictable movies ever.

Detention is pure insanity. It's visually compelling and progresses in such an unusual manner. It's like it jumps back and forth from being hilarious and really amazing to being this really wild and strange ride where you're just left wondering, ""What the @#$! is going on?!"" It's the type of film where you'll always find something new that you missed during a previous viewing and demands consistent revisits. Detention combines everything you love about everything and has the precise formula and ingredients of a true cult classic.",1334361600,5,3113,4.990366088631984
7892378,1,6305610096,This is the worst movie i've ever seen! Don't waste your time or money on this! Believe it's just crap!,1330214400,,103,4.2
7892379,1,6305610096,"Many of the reviews have absolutly nothing to do with this specific movie named Detention which is apparently a really popular title.  Some of the other reviews are talking about what sounds like a cheesy drama, this is not that movie.  I thought I was buying the 2011 Horror/comedy movie named Dentention in which dane cook plays the principal and there is a serial killer and which also made bloodydisgusting.com's top 10 horror films for 2011.  THIS IS NOT THAT MOVIE. What this is, is a not very good ghost movie.
Unless the reveiws giving this movie five stars mention that it is a ghost horror movie you should disregard them. I was hoping maybe I hadn't wasted my money because this was stil a horror film but no this movie is simply dull.",1327449600,15,746,4.552238805970149
