8665785,5,B00LGZONIS,Excellent expose of what has become a dangerous organization. Well documented.,1429488000,,78,6.181818181818182
8665786,5,B00LGZONIS,"This movie will be enlightening for any one who wonders why J Street is so controversial in the Jewish community. Through the voices of some of the most mature and insightful thinkers in Jewish intellectual life, it explains why this seemingly well-intentioned movement is so counter-productive. JStreet embodies the position of many liberal Jews, who place all blame, and all responsibility for peace-making, on Israel. The film analyzes the psychology behind this stance, exposing historical inaccuracies and holes in the thinking. It offers an unvarnished, realistic perspective on the conflicts and pressures surrounding Israel, for which there are no easy answers. It should be shown on all college campuses and is a must-see for anyone who wants to understand the Israeli-Palestinian situation in depth.",1429056000,2,809,5.532258064516129
8665787,1,B00LGZONIS,"Is this for real? Seriously, do your research before using this one movie to make up your mind about J Street. A sad excuse of a ""documentary""",1424908800,,142,4.296296296296297
8665788,5,B00LGZONIS,"Wow, what an eye-opening assessment of J-Street; their biases; their hidden agendas; their use of moral narcissism to attract, mobilize, and leverage on the naive and uniformed; and the big surprise of all, which are the people and organizations who actually finance J-Street... In a nutshell, the film reveals and exposes how many well-intended citizens are mislead into the wrong side of the debate, and how J-Street undermines the moral compass of Americans to the point that many can no longer see who is wrong and what is the right way to combat terrorism.  The commentaries by Ruth Wisse (Harvard), Alan Dershowitz, Caroline Glick (Jerusalem Post), Richard Landes (Boston University), Daniel Gordis (Shalem College), and many others, made this movie all the more revelatory and balanced.",1419811200,2,793,5.2936507936507935
8665789,1,B00LGZONIS,Preposterous and misleading. Alan Dershowitz should stick to what he knows - defending the likes of O.J.Simpson and Klaus von Bulow.,1416182400,,132,5.333333333333333
8665790,5,B00LGZONIS,A fascinating documentary that's very informative and quite disturbing.  The people at J Street are a bunch of hucksters.,1415577600,3,121,5.368421052631579
8665791,5,B00LGZONIS,In my opinion it was very honest and thought provoking. It showed the true purpose of J Street,1414713600,3,94,4.277777777777778
