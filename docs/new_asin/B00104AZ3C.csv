8236853,3,B00104AZ3C,"Parts of the audio are also muddy sounding and were taken off of other sources, not very well produced but the sound is pretty good for the songs but the cameras move around too much and this has to do with editing otherwise it's pretty consistant (I still enjoy watching ti every once in awhile) due to the time period that it was shot in because it's not a new concert. I even think that Live in Dortmund needs some improvements and I bought Dortmund from and independent seller, it has some stretch marks on the original tape that it was transferred from that I take are hard to get rid of because of the original source material so even that one was transferred to DVD and it has it's slight flaws.",1352332800,,702,4.325757575757576
8236854,3,B00104AZ3C,"Although not much in the way of clarity and some idiotic video company symbol on the screen the whole way through it, this is still a video worth owning if you are a Maiden fan.  Good look at the band while they were still relatively young.",1243555200,3,240,4.217391304347826
8236855,3,B00104AZ3C,"The Castle Donington Festival is one of Rocks great live shows each year. I.M. put on a good show, but I have seen them do much better here in the states. That said, the video was amazing to watch. It was fun to go back to 1992 and see the guys in action! Most I.M. fans should pick this DVD up.",1235001600,,295,3.8524590163934427
8236856,1,B00104AZ3C,"I'll start by saying that this is not an official release. It was made by some company ""Masterplan"" that keep showing their annoying ""MP"" logo on the top left corner of the screen during the WHOLE show. I've had the original VHS copy for years now and i was hoping to have some improvement on the video and/or sound quality with this DVD release.

All i found is that this is a very very cheap transfer from the VHS. If you have the VHS, do not buy this DVD... you'll get better video/sound quality out of your VHS. If you don't have the VHS, then you might go after this, but i promise you'll get a better quality in Youtube.

Regarding the show, well... you all know it. It was a masterful performance from their 1992 Fear Of the Dark tour and i love the set list. I'm basing my review strictly because the quality of the product... not because Maiden's performance... this was a five stars performance...

I just hope Maiden officialy releases this show on DVD some day...",1209081600,6,975,4.405555555555556
8236857,5,B00104AZ3C,"This was a great show! Iron Maiden totally rock live, and this movie proves it. The show opens up with the ferocious ""Be Quick or Be Dead"", which is the moment of the show that gets your blood pumping.

This was their show at the Monsters of Rock festival, and I wish I was there. Sure their last 2 albums before this were depressing (NPFTD sucked), the songs sounded great live. Some parts you gotta love would be the B&W footage of the fans going to the show in the beginning (with even the randomly placed shot of the clown begging for change), fans going up on stage during ""Heaven Can Wait"", and Adrian Smith joining the band for one number.

Some of the songs they play include: Wrathchild, Iron Maiden, Running Free, Afraid to Shoot Strangers, Bring Your Daughter...To The Slaughter.

No this isn't available on DVD here in Canada yet, but it's worth waiting for!",1196726400,5,870,4.528662420382165
