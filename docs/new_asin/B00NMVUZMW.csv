8679259,5,B00NMVUZMW,"History should not be taken lightly. This documentary reminds me of a book I have read, ""10 Books That Screwed Up the World: And 5 Others That Didn't Help"" by Benjamin Wiker. If Good ideas have good consequences then the reverse is also true, that is, bad ideas have bad consequences. Some world views are tolerable while others become malignant. Darwinian Evolution is such a malignant world view. Everyone should educate themselves on such history  if for only the reason, ""not to be condemned to repeat it""

This award-winning 14-minute documentary tells the little-known story of the influence of Social Darwinism on German militarism leading up to World War 1, including an exploration of the German military's genocidal policies in Southwest Africa (modern Namibia). The video features the work of California State University historian Richard Weikart, author of the book From Darwin to Hitler: Evolutionary Ethics, Eugenics, and Racism in Germany (Palgrave Macmillan).",1504483200,,989,5.380645161290323
8679260,5,B00NMVUZMW,"The Biology of the Second Reich is about the documented influence of Darwinism on the first world war. Part 1 was 14 minutes long and part 2 on CS Lewiss warning about scientism and part 3 on the war against humans were 30 minutes each. All three films consisted of a lot of quotes and interviews from well-known historians and professors as well as critics of intelligent design. All three films were very well done, professionally edited and filmed. The only bad thing was the cover of the DVD! This highly recommended show clearly says that if we do not learn from the past we are condemned to repeat it, and it seems that the lessons of world war I and II are being repeated, as per the warning of part 2 of the film. One who is familiar with this period of history will be familiar with the events covered.",1502841600,,811,4.377483443708609
8679261,5,B00NMVUZMW,"This short, pithy movie discusses the horrific results of social Darwinism when it progresses to its extreme. In a world bent on limiting population rather than providing for that population, social Darwinism is gaining in popularity, especially for those who hold power. In an unleashed capitalist world, all that would be required to support an increasing population would be provided. But the progressive degradation of morality and freedom is determined to see that does not occur as the greater the population, the harder it is to maintain control and power of the elitist few. This movie will surely disturb those who espouse both Intelligent Design as it may very well come to fruition in the 21st century. This movie will also anger those who espouse Social Darwinism as the movie has lifted the veil to show the underlying ideas behind many of the policies we see today.",1437004800,5,879,4.98639455782313
8679262,1,B00NMVUZMW,"This video is available for free on YouTube, which is useful since it is valueless Creationist propaganda and thus is not worth purchasing. Literally every section and almost every spoken sentence in it is an ahistorical distortion, exaggeration, misrepresentation, misunderstanding, or untruth. It essentially accuses Charles Darwin of being responsible for German Imperialism and World War I because the aggressive and racist German ideology that supported these evils was predicated upon a German intellectual belief in evolution as ""survival of the fittest"" and the military actions compelled by this belief.

The video confuses and equates the cultural ideology of ""Social Spencerism"" (termed ""Social Darwinism"" throughout the video) with Darwin's Theories of Evolution and Natural Selection. Two long comments I wrote for this video on YouTube explain why this thesis is nonsense. Natural selection is NOT ""survival of the fittest,"" a concept that Herbert Spencer invented to explain his Lamarckian theory of social selection of human races and ethnic groups.

In short, the video is an attempt to confuse and mislead the viewer about the scientific legitimacy of biological evolution by falsely associating it with a now-discredited human social theory.",1436918400,,1260,5.661375661375661
