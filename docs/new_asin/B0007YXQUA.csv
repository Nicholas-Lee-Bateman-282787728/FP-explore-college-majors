8054270,1,B0007YXQUA,"My 4 year old daughter was given this dvd for her birthday...we put it on to watch together feeling pretty safe since the case has ""family lessons abound"" on the top - literally my four year old was hysterically crying barely half way through due to the ""nasty neighbor Nettles"" character.  It shows him chasing a baby groundhog with an ice axe trying to ""get him""...it shows him swinging and missing several times the last time he swings then it cuts to a different scene so you don't know if he hits the baby or not.  Seriously - this is hideous. There is a line at the end about ""alls well that ends well""...well, if your child doesn't have a nervous breakdown at the begining and can make it through the whole show maybe that is the case. Otherwise DO NOT SHOW THIS TO YOUR CHILD. The episode i am referring to is called ""Dandelion and the Baby Groundhog"".  I'm seriously ticked off that my child saw this irresponsible movie claiming to be ""suitable for all family viewing"".  Do yourself a favor - skip the Bellflower Bunnies.",1176076800,7,1031,4.497326203208556

My son will often recite something from the movie whether it be sharing, or working together ""It's always better when we work together""  Highly recommended.",1142294400,3,274,5.044444444444444
