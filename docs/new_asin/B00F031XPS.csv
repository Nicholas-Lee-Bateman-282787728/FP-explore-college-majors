5962014,2,B00F031XPS,"As a chronology the program was adequate, but as a film, it came up short. In spite of Hendrix's extraordinary music, the documentary seemed flat and episodic, even predictable - a series of interviews linked with bits of archives, as if Jimi's music was less important than other people's opinions of him. Sure it was informative, but it lacked cinematic vision and drama. Given the power of the subject, it could have been so much more.",1383264000,25,438,4.776315789473684
5962015,4,B00F031XPS,"My review of Hear My Train A Comin

First off, the showing I went to happened to also be attended by the director Bob Smeaton! Kind of cool! We got to ask him questions about the doc after it was over. Nice guy and very frank about the challenges of editing a doc like this one with so many voices and pieces of footage to choose from and showcase.

Overall, this is a fine job. Keep in mind that for us ""Jimi heads"" we've seen the vast majority of the footage that's out there in one form or another. The two or three biggest ""new Jimi visuals"" included in the doc are Miami (obviously) and we get nearly a complete performance of Foxy Lady. We also get snippets of Tax Free and plenty of footage of the Miami crowd. But given this is a documentary, you're going to have to wait for the ""Extras"" in order to really enjoy all of the new footage, including Isle of Fehrman, which is briefly shown in the doc when Jimi performs Spanish Castle Magic (with the audience tape the family released as the audio for the cut). We also get, for what was for me anyways, some previously unseen footage of Jimi performing in a full blue velvet get-up. I forget which concert this was taken from.

The majority of the people interviewed in the doc have since passed on. Noel, Mitch, Chas, Paul Caruso, Buddy Miles, and a few more. Surprise, Faye Pridgeon is still around, so is Billy Cox (thank goodness), Linda Keith, but we still don't get any updated interview with Eric Barrett, unfortunately. Bob Smeaton mentioned that Eric didn't like how he was quoted in the original Jimi Hendrix biopic back in '73 and hence has never allowed himself to be interviewed on camera about Jimi since. Also, Leon chose not to be interviewed for this doc.

Linda Keith summed up Jimi's two passions in his life: music and women! Won't debate it.

I will mention, however, that towards the conclusion of the doc there is some beautiful guitar playing. And guess what it is? It's from One Rainy Wish and I guess Eddie Kramer or whomever it was made available Jimi's guitar from this gorgeous composition without the drums or any other instruments. When you hear it, it's like heaven! Just exquisite. I'd love to hear One Rainy Wish in its entirety without drums or bass. Just Jimi's soulful strumming. Maybe one day the family will release some additional outtakes of Axis and include Jimi's guitar parts from this tune without the added bass and drums.

The doc runs close to two hours. The rest of the footage we've seen before. Bob relies heavily on the Dick Cavett interview. A good dose of Berkeley, Monterey, but barely any Newport! Some of the most gorgeous, exquisite blues playing EVER caught of Jimi performing live and Bob doesn't use ANY OF IT! (there's a second or two from the stage but it doesn't count in my book) Sacrilegious! Maybe the family is still waiting to release this stuff on something else. Or maybe it's on the Extras. I don't know. But it's footage that captures what for me is what makes Jimi the greatest R&B electric guitarist of all time. Whenever someone asks me, I just say, go watch Newport!

It would have been super if Bob had bothered to get permission to include more footage from Maui. We get In From The Storm at the conclusion of the doc but man, we know there's much more, including Dolly Dagger and the instrumental that follows it. This is footage crying to be seen by the public at large, in particular, to show the more intricate and softer side of Jimi's playing.

Also, the doc fibs when it's mentioned why Jimi got out of the Army. We know now that it wasn't a ""broken ankle"" that got Jimi his discharge. But that's minor. Also, there's zero mention of LSD, pot, drugs, etc....Bob told us that because there was no recorded interviews with Jimi about his taking any drugs he decided not to include any footage with other people who knew Jimi that mentioned his drug use. Fair enough. But I think LSD is an important drug (PERIOD) and LSD was an influence on Jimi when it came to some of his greatest compositions, including 1983. I seem to recall that there is a recorded interview with Jimi where he does discuss LSD (I could be mistaken).

All in all, this is a very good production and we have to keep in mind that there are always new Jimi fans to initiate and many should find this doc a real delight.

I can't WAIT to see the extras!!! This is what all Jimi heads are salivating the most about. More Miami, more Isle of Fehrman, more New York '70, yeah!",1382832000,93,4483,4.469437652811736

5962018,2,B00F031XPS,"Having just watched the film, I conclude that 1) Jimi was a nice person and a driven musician, and 2) my musical taste is terrible.

At age 70, I lived through the 60s and loved so much of the music. Never was a fan of JH, though. Thought he played far too many wrong notes, thought his love of feedback was self-indulgent, thought little of his on-stage theatrics (burning a guitar, playing with his teeth, having sex with the guitar), thought his lyrics were meaningless. Thought Eric Clapton in Cream was technically far superior (and enjoyable), and that countless guitarists with less technical talent had far more complexity and heart.

This documentary confirmed all those thoughts.

Yet in it we have Paul McCartney saying I'm wrong.

So who ya gonna believe? Ha, even I'd believe Paul McCartney over me. So don't listen to me. It's clear I'm not a reliable judge of musical talent.

If you do watch this documentary, though, it will have you thinking that Jimi Hendrix was a nice person (so endearing on the Dick Cavett show) and worked at gaining mastery over his instrument. But it may not convince you that his music was enjoyable.

The documentary sure didn't convince me that he was a complete human being. One of his old flames tells us, for example, that he carried a guitar everywhere, that he felt stressed by his success. It's clear that he enjoyed the comfort of groupies. Did I mention that he carried a guitar and played it EVERYWHERE? From waking in the morning to sleeping at night, walking around with a guitar and playing/practicing.

One other thing we're told is that he died in London in September of 1970, but not how. OK, this is about the life of Hendrix not the death. But for me it's the proof that this documentary is less than complete, less than honest. That it's a love song to Jimi, not a reliable documentary.

On the other hand, I liked the film for bringing us the early Jimi -- as an Army veteran, it was good to see him in the 101st Airborne -- but it would also have been nice to have learned more about the adult Jimi. Or maybe that's all there was. A shy young man without much of a life except drugs, sex and his guitar.

Greatest guitarist ever? Please. (Better than Hendrix are Tommy Emmanuel, Leo Kottke, Wayne Henderson, Mark Knopfler, Eric Clapton, Gary Moore, Jimmy Page, Alvin Lee, Ry Cooder, Chuck Berry, almost any bluegrass picker ... and if we move away from rock and bluegrass, Paco de Lucia, Doc Watson, Rodrigo of Rodrigo Y Gabriela, and then there are all the great classical guitarists like Sharon Isbin, Julian Bream, the Romero family. ""Greatest guitarist ever."" It's to laugh.)

[A couple days later, and curious about his leaving the Army because of a broken ankle on his 25th jump, I find there's a lot more to the story. (Links can't go in Amazon reviews, but a search will be easy.) No, his discharge was due to being an incorrigible screw-up. That's not what the documentary told us. Finally convincing me there was a lot more it didn't get right.]",1454803200,3,3020,4.596654275092937

There was something very interesting added that I had not seen before.  There was an interview with Faye (a.k.a. known as Fayne).  I have seen her when she was interviewed in the 70's.  She was my favorite of Jimi's girlfriends.  She was so adorable, bubbly, cute and sweet.  I was shocked to see how much she had aged.  Her voice cracked a lot and she mentioned how much she loved Jimi's letters and liked to show them to her grandchildren.  She was a wild child.  I recognized Collette, his French girlfriend.  I last saw her swinging against a hammock in the South of France and talking about Jimi.  She is now old and she has the voice of a two-pack a day smoker.  The best for last, Linda Keith.  All of Jimi's fans know who these women are.  Linda aged the best.  Since she was an English aristocrat, money was never a concern to her.  I don't think she had a face lift.  She was very recognizable.  The startling thing about Linda Keith was she appeared to have either snorted an eight ball or drunk 40 cups of coffee before her interview.  Her intensity was almost shocking.  She was verging on hysterical.  I enjoyed hearing these women speak.

Okay, I digress. This DVD was great because it was about Jimi! Other than that (and I'm slightly prejudice here, yeah slightly, right) it was good to see on film some of the people who shared a small part in Jimi's life (some let their jealousy show through though) was a treat for me, some of the sound was not so good, but what can you expect for that time. I would have liked to have seen more candid interviews with Jimi and more live performances, but there may not have been many available and since Jimi is no longer living you have to take what you can get.

5962053,3,B00F031XPS,"This documentary, produced by the Hendrix family, offers an insightful look into the masterful guitar work of Jimi Hendrix, truly a music legend that established his talent in just a few short years.  However, the documentary is almost revisionist in its historical presentation, showing the artist's strengths and almost nothing of his weaknessses.  Hendrix was a very flawed individual who did make stupid mistakes including his drug fueled lifestyle of cocaine, pot, heroin, and large quanitites of alcohol.  It brought his life to a sad and early end.

There are some really insightful interviews including Chas Chandler, Billy Cox, Steve Winwood and Paul McCartney.  On the other hand, there are comments by people who are meaningless to his life.  Where was Kathy Etchingham, his long time lover?  He called her his Yoko Ono.  It is astonishing she could have been left out.  This documentary really does not delve into Hendrix and race.  Why was his music poorly supported by the African-American community?

The documentary suggests he was the highest paid concert act.  He was the highest paid performer at Woodstock, but he was not in a league with Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra and others.  Although a flawed work, you do have to admire the effort to showcase his music.

The strength of the documentary is offering highlights of his brilliant musical artistry.",1417046400,,1371,5.117117117117117

5962060,4,B00F031XPS,"Jimi Hendrix was my first concert going experience and he was a huge influence on my guitar playing, so I pretty much needed to see this documentary. This is a very good glimpse at his history.

Here's the scoop. This film uses friends, family and industry people to trace Hendrix's life and astounding career.

I have read one biography of him and little snippets here, there, now and then but this filled in some blanks and gave me a greater overall feel for the legend that was Jimi Hendrix. The producer/director managed to unearth a lot of photos and way more film footage than I could have imagined even existed. Seeing him in the back-up bands of some of the earlier soul artists is precious. And the photos of him as a young boy, in the military and in his various musical endeavors just gives the viewer a greater sense of the whole. Then there are talking heads. For my dollar they helped a lot. Yes. He was a phenomenal guitarist, but when you hear different people who speak of how he never went anywhere without his guitar and you realize he wasn't a prodigy. He was great because that's all he did for nearly every waking hour of his life. The authority he displayed while playing simply overwhelmed his audiences. But it also shows him as a true artist. He didn't need the big house, the constant accolades or the other trappings of the rich and famous. All he wanted to do is play and create and it's a shame that window of time was so short.

On the downside is that some of the storyline and the accompanying footage don't sync up historically, and things feel a bit rushed near the end, but this is still a great documentary on a man who may have been the single greatest musical influence in the late 60's and early 70's.",1411603200,,1741,4.434375

5962072,3,B00F031XPS,"I watched this with my elderly father on PBS and it was the first time he ever admitted Jimi was a talented musician and musical genius. He liked it, which says a lot. If I were to offer a technical criticism I would like to advise those directors who think swinging the camera back and forth is some kind of new hip technique that it is just plain annoying and irritates the eye. The reason directors didn't do this in the past is because they had the sense not to.

  What irked me about this production is Hendrix insiders like Chris Welch at the very end reciting the official version of Jimi's death saying he tragically OD'ed on barbiturates and choked on his own vomit. I know enough about Hendrix and those who recorded Hendrix history to know those Hendrix insiders in this video know there's much more to it than that but for political purposes cover their cowardly butts and repeat the official version. They are assuring air time and future access to the formal Hendrix world controlled by Janie Hendrix's business interests by doing that. You couldn't sell Jimi out any worse but there they are doing it with most clueless Hendrix fans not even noticing or even caring. I can't wait to see how they cover Jimi's murder in the new bio-pic the Hendrix company has finally given its approval to. Hendrix's murder is an epic tale mostly because of the betrayal of those who call themselves his friends, business interests, and fans. You won't see that in this video which permanently colors it to its detriment. Jimi is good enough to sell in a gilded cage wheeled out for admiration by its purveyors but not good enough for those same purveyors to bother themselves with the simple truth over his death. Shame! Jimi would be rolling in his grave over this phony hypocrisy. He'd be ripping at the phony decor of these pretend admirers with his stratocaster just like he did when he was alive, for those who were listening...",1397865600,,1933,4.613372093023256

5962076,2,B00F031XPS,"IMO I feel this dvd is weak compared to the 1973 documentary and these are the reasons why:
This is about the greatest electric guitar player right? What really is disappointing about this film is that only very short segments most not even a minute long of Jimi playing is what the viewer gets to see. Those interviewd talk of Jimi's greatness but the viewer is left with very little evidence and examples of it.

The 1973 film shows some of Jimi's most electrifying performances, (in full length or almost complete) such as Johnny B. Goode, and Purple Haze from Berkeley ; Hey Joe, Rock Me Baby from Monterey; Red House and Machine Gun from Isle Of Wright and others, where  the viewer gets to see Jimi's true virtuosity and mastery of the guitar. Why would Bob Smeaton choose to show only mere seconds of Jimi playing, with exception of Foxey Lady from Miami Pop (that pretty much leaves the viewer drooling for more)

Aside from this Bob Smeaton  drops the ball big time by giving no mention to the night that (which is now legendary) when Jimi first arrived in London ,that the unknown Jimi showed up at a Cream gig and blew Eric Clapton off the stage leaving him ,the rest of the band and all in the audience in shock over what had just happened. This is what got all of London's  rock luminaries and god's of rock talking about this guy from the U.S.A. who just crushed Eric Clapton who was considered the best guitar player by many at that time. Eric Clapton in another Hendrix documentary which aired on the South Bank show years ago , himself  said of that night ""As soon as Jimi walked off the stage that night my life was never the same"". So this pivotal night and event , not only  in Jimi's life and career but in Clapton's as well is inexplicably not even mentioned!

The 1973 film has interviews with Eric Clapton, Pete Townsend, Little Richard , The Ghetto Fighters and other as well and a much younger Fayne Pridgeon who is stunningly beautiful , who's interviews are insightful and at times pretty funny.
  As for the Extra's the bonus footage, The 1970 NYC Randall's Island show is featured. This is a show that has been circulating for years on cd where Jimi is not in the best of moods as he throughout the show curses out some of the crowed (not included in the footage)and when you see the footage it's very clear he's tired ( very similar to Isles Of Wright)and looks like he would rather be somewhere else. The jaw dropping stunning version of Red House the best song he played that night (some of the greatest Jimi one will ever hear)is not shown. Why??  The rest of the footage from his last concert right before he died is of very poor sound quality and just included for historical reasons if that's important to you.

There are many new photo's of Jimi including a somewhat poignant picture of Jimi with a 5 or 6 yr old Janie ( who would of thought this little girl some 40 yrs latter would be raking in the  millions of $$$$ from Jimi's name and hard work and in control of his music, doing a great job of screwing it all up as well, this dvd an example) the bonus footage of Tax Free- Miami Pop, is defiantly a treat but leaves us begging for more(is there more??)

The film itself is well produced to a degree and the sound is very good. As for the interviews where is Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Johnny Winter, Mick Taylor and the likes??.. instead we get David Fricke and Deweezil Zappa!!
But most of all the biggest let down comes down to the music itself, why just mere short segments of Jimi playing as opposed to complete or almost complete performances. Have our attention spans,because of this geek tec. era we live in become so short that we can't sit there and watch Jim Hendrix play a complete song? Is this what Bob Smeaton had in mind when he put this film together or is it a marketing ploy of Janie to get people to go out and buy the dvd's available that include these songs in their  entirety?
So what it comes down to is this :  if your Janie Hendrix and know absolutely nothing about Jimi's music or if your Bob Smeaton or if you never heard of Hendrix and it really doesn't matter this dvd is for you, although it's  pure trash when compared to the 1973 dvd. If your a Hendrix lover, music lover or guitar freak and want to see Jimi burn on his ax and listen to some great worthwhile interviews the 1973 dvd is for you. Watch them one after another and you'll see what I'm talking about.",1395014400,8,4438,4.373025516403402
5962077,5,B00F031XPS,"I bought this as a wedding friend who is an avid Hendrix fan.  In fact, her second son is named Hendrix.  (Her first son is named Kingston, so hang down your head, Tom Dooley!)  She adores this DVD. no great surprise because I saw the American Masters segment on PBS, on which I'm guessing the DVD is a repeat, and I was also impressed.",1395014400,,336,4.21875
5962078,5,B00F031XPS,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Some of the footage I had seen before, some was new. It was well produced over all and if you are a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I highly recommend watching this.",1393632000,,187,4.222222222222222
5962079,5,B00F031XPS,"This is probably as good as it will ever get, as a documentary on Hendrix. Some especially valuable moments include Eddie Kramer playing a master tape of Little Wing and demonstrating just how good the vocal is when he fades down all the other tracks, and pretty much all the comments by Chas Chandler and Linda Keith. They alone are worth the price of admission. Her commentary, and the clips from a couple other female friends, provide some perspective that was sadly missing from the otherwise comprehensive book, ""setting the record straight.""

But, like any documentary intended for a mass audience, unfortunately it assumes we are idiots. For instance, we have to sit through a little lecture on the flexibility provided by multi-track recording.

And, the selection of interviewees spreads the net much more widely than was necessary or desirable. What the hell is Dweezil Zappa doing here, pontificating in a way that underlines the obvious while looking as if he is on the edge of a psycho meltdown? As for Rolling Stone magazine journalist David Fricke, he has no business being here at all, yet is allowed more time than anyone else, in which to ""sum it all up"" in the half-baked, patronizing, pseudo-intellectual style so characteristic of that magazine. If he had been omitted, there would have been more time for the people who really matter, such as Mitch Mitchell, who is allowed far less than he deserved. Presumably Fricke was considered necessary to explain Hendrix--another problem of aiming this documentary at a mass audience.

The short segments of Paul McCartney are valuable. I especially liked his comment about shy musicians who blossom on stage: ""It's like they're let out of jail.""

But there are some glaring omissions. No mention whatsoever, for instance, of contractual problems, financial problems, and the use of band members as hired hands. Almost no mention of management issues. No explanation of cause of death. In short, nothing remotely controversial.

The clips and photos of early street scenes (including a photo of the Cafe Wha? sign, and stills of Jimi in early bands) are wonderful. Some serious photo research was done here.

Five stars because the positive elements matter so much. Maybe one star for the producer who allowed unimportant characters to chat ad-nauseam while editing down people who were actually involved in Hendrix's life and music.",1392163200,5,2397,5.086513994910941
5962080,5,B00F031XPS,"This is a great documentary about Hendrix. Its a very nice piece that focuses more on the positive side of his creativity. It does address the drugs etc. but it does nit dwell on it as some other films do. It paints him in a positive light as a creative person ( which he was ). Some of the footage I have seen before, but that's to be expected when his career was so short. If you are even a casual Hendrix fan it is worth a look.",1390867200,,431,3.909090909090909
5962081,5,B00F031XPS,"As a lifelong Hendrix fan, I loved the concert footage from Miami 1968 and Femarn Sept. 1970. Watching Jimi's performance from that concert was kind of sad, knowing that within two weeks, he would be gone from us forever. I can't help wondering what he would be doing if he lived. Jimi was one heck of a talent and I never get tired of watching him on film. Hopefully concert footage from the Royal Albert Hall (Feb. 1969) Jimi Hendrix Experience performance will eventually be remastered and released for sale here. Looking at the old fuzzy footage is getting frustrating. I enjoyed the DVD and would buy it again in a heartbeat.",1390694400,,630,4.633928571428571

First, the DVD did not address this left hand guitar playing on a right handed guitar.  Second, his death remains controversial.  The DVD failed to address this issue.  Third, his discharge from paratrooper is controversial.  Some say he was discharged because of an injury, while others state he had no injury.

It is filled with fascinating stories and great footage of The Master at work. It doesn't get any better than Jimi Hendrix and this DVD will take you right into the soul of what he was about - his music, his lyrics, his life.

Hard to believe that he did all that he did in less than 4 years, but then again, Jimi IS The Master!!!

5962122,4,B00F031XPS,"This dvd (or blu ray) has two main sections: Section one offers a documentary of Jimi's life while the focus of section two (Extras) is on three concert performances.

The documentary part (almost 2 hours) about Jimi's (too short) life is quite similar to the previously released ""West Coast Seattle Boy"" documentary. Added are excerpts of concert footage published on previous Hendrix dvds. However, the entire part one is presented in widescreen format, which means that all the original concert clips have also been cut (reduced in height) compared to the originals which were filmed in 4:3 format. In my opinion thats clearly a wrong and disappointing decision! These concert clips could have been presented in their original format with added black areas left and right to fill the widescreen format, thereby avoiding the mutilation of the original material!

There are also some new interviews, among them some with former girlfriends of Jimis (Fayne Pridgeon, Linda Keith and Colette Mimram (now with a new last name). Other important girlfriends of Jimis, like Kathy Etchingham, Jeanette Jacobs and Carmen Borrero are not interviewed (Kathy probably might have declined to work with Janie Hendrixs company), but (blonde) Carmen is at least briefly seen with Jimi, in a clip on the road from Noel Reddings home videos. There are also new comments by Paul McCartney, Steve Winwood, engineer and sound master Eddie Kramer and several other contemporaries who are still alive, Billy Cox being the last surviving band member. All the best to you, Billy!

Many documentary comments are illustrated with (mostly silent) short clips of Jimi performing (for example Stockholm 1967, bits of the psychedelic color film shot at Falcon Lair (formerly Rudolph Valentinos house, in L.A.) on August 17, 1967, some very short film cuts of Jimis performance at Madison Square Garden, NYC, on May 18, 1969, a very intersting film piece of Jimi recording Voodoo Child"" (with Mitch on drums and Jack Casady on bass) at TTG Studios in Hollywood in 1968. This I would have enjoyed more had it been presented without interruptions, but here it is chopped into pieces.

The extras have 3 sections:

1. First, there is the documentary about the concert at the Miami Pop Festival on May 18, 1968. The former organizer Michael Lang (also organizer of Woodstock 1969) gives us some background information and then we see four filmed clips of Jimi's performance: ""Foxy Lady"" and ""Tax Free"" are about complete and there are also fragments of ""Fire"" and ""Purple Haze"". These clips are really exciting, in good (color) picture quality and 5:1 sound! Jimi and also Mitch are in good form. But, as with the documentary the Miami Pop film has been cropped to 16:9 from the original full 4:3 format, which leads to the stupid effect of cutting off the upper parts of Jimis and Noels heads (forehead and above) in some shots (not that many, thank God!) If video engineers are given the task to cut a 4:3 film down to 16:9, it would be nice to at least make sure they don't chop off parts of heads!

2. The second concert film is from the New York Pop Festival, on 17 July 1970, Downing Stadium, Randall's Iceland, NY. Running time is approx. 20 minutes.
Parts of this concert I've seen on youtube, but here the quality is obviously much better. Jimi plays ""Message To Love,"" ""Lover Man"", ""All Along The Watchtower"", ""Purple Haze"" and ""Voodoo Child, SR"". The sound is mixed to 5:1. This film has not been trimmed down. So theres no frustration to fear. Funny: The producers actually apologize and warn us that this film is shown in its original form. They do the same for the Fehmarn film:

3. Recently discovered footage of Jimi on the Isle of Fehmarn, September 6. 1970, his last concert performance. He died only 12 days later, on September 18.

Attention! Your tv must be switched to 4:3 format for this film! The access to the Fehmarn film is somewhat awkwardly hidden in the dvd menu: Below the song list for the New York Pop movie you have to click on the ""more"" button.

This Fehmarn concert film is a real pleasant surprise, especially for someone like me who experienced Jimi Hendrix performances live (all three performances in Berlin: May 15. 1967, January 23. 1969, and September 4. 1970).

Running time of this part is about 16 Minuten. The footage shows Jimi from the perspective of the audience. Most of the time the camera catches him up close, quite clearly and always in color, doing  ""Killing Floor"", ""Spanish Castle Magic"", ""All Along The Watchtower"" und ""Foxy Lady"". Finally, the last seconds of Hey Joe"". In between the camera cuts to the audience, trying to protect themselves from the bad weather, but most of the time its Jimi. The stereo sound was caught by two overhead microphones that had been installed on the stage without Jimi knowing about it. The sound is quite good, realistc and enjoyable, pretty much the way the audience must have heard it, but not remastered or according to the standards of a professional recording, of course.

4. As an added extra, there's the complete clip of Jimi's appearance on ""Top Of The Pops"" with ""Purple Haze"" (in black and white) of 30 March, 1967.

Okay, I guess fans of Jimi Hendrix, especially those who experienced him performing live, like myself, have different preferences as to how his legacy should be presented to the public than the owners with their (mainly?) commercial considerations. Also, Im  not an ""objective"" reviewer, for whom Jimi Hendrix is just one among many other musicians. He was and still is very special to me. (My other favorite musicians are John McLaughlin, Miles Davis and Jeff Beck, who I also experienced live many times over the decades.)

So this dvd (or blu ray) is mainly worth having or at least watching for longtime Jimi Hendrix fans, the main reason being the concert films. The publication policy of the company ""Experience Hendrix"" has it's advantages and its disadvantages. Well, I wasn't too happy about what Alan Douglas did before, either.

There is still a lot of very intersting Jimi Hendrix concerts material in the vaults. We fans have been waiting for the restored film of the Royal Albert Hall concert (24 February 1969) - where Jimi gave a great performance, absolutely worth seeing and hearing - for nearly half a century now! So far only a bootleg DVD of it has been released,about ten years ago, with low quality video material, assembled from the collections of various fans. According to what I read Experience Hendrix"" has up to now been unable or unwillig to come to terms with the producers and owners of this film, Steve Gold and Jerry Goldstein. An insider book on Jimi Hendrix tells us he himself had agreed to the filming of the Albert Hall show, but not without strong misgivings, allegedly considering Gold and Goldstein to have adding machines for minds"". Well, if that should be true and Experience Hendrix"" is unwilling to pay enough to finally get the publishing rights, the film is probably kept in the vaults until it rots and nobody will have any advantage of it, which would be a real shame, especially for those who really love Jimi Hendrix.

Anyway, its astonishing how much unpublished video and sound material of Jimi still exists and then suddenly surfaces after all those decades. But will there stll be a public big and interested enough and willing to spend money on it when most of those who actually saw and heard Jimi during his lifetime have also passed away? He was a great and exceptionally creative musician with undeniable personal charm and magnetism, thats for sure. Forever in our hearts!",1386460800,4,7624,4.847809377401998

5962128,4,B00F031XPS,"Hear My Train A Comin' is another documentary about Jimi Hendrix. Since 1973 there has been numerous documentaries produced about Jimi.
The first produced in the early 1970s was made shortly after Jimi's passing. It had interviews with Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend and other people close to Jimi. It is still a great document of the life of Jimi Hendrix and is also available on DVD.
The last decade has seen more documentaries of Jimi produced including one that was issued with the West Coast Seattle Boy Box Set.
This new documentary includes some footage from all the previous films plus some new concert footage such as Miami Pop and some snippets that fans have identified as the concert Jimi played at Madison Square Garden from 1969 and some snippets of Jimi's concert at the Hollywood Bowl.
The film itself has a lot of interview footage of an ageing Fayne Pridgeon and the woman who discovered Jimi Linda Keith.
I feel this is a very well produced story about Jimi but it does not include several important people who were heavily involved in Jimi's life such as Kathy Ethingham and even his brother Leon who is never mentioned.
Chas Chandler is mentioned but does not get the recognition he deserved as the major producer for Jimi's 3 studio albums.
Although there are some flaws this is an entertaining film and well worth getting.
The extras are what most Hendrix fans want this DVD for. The 4 songs from Miami 1968 have been highly anticipated and are well worth the wait. The NewYork Pop 1970 footage is poor visually but a great performance.
Jimi's final concert from Germany is a bit of a let down despite being very historic and the final testament of Jimi's legacy on film. The picture is poor as is the sound and I find it not easy to watch due to the poor sound. However this is the last chance we have of seeing Jimi Live therefore it is essential to view at least once.

Performance footage, as they say in Variety, is well-done, more than well done in fact, and the inclusion of the Miami Pop is nothing short of brilliant. Now where is that Albert Hall genius lurking? In the vaults?

The screening confirmed my feeling about avoiding the ominous anniversary of Hendrix death  September 18  in favor of the date of his arrival on this Third Stone from the Sun: November 27, when I give thanks for this genius brief shining flame on the guitar horizon. The little girl whose mom married Al Hendrix, Janie Hendrix, she too looks through those purple colored glasses when she reflects on the lanky guitar player who came back to Seattle to visit. As the executive producer of these recordings  and executrix of the estate  Janie has glossed over the legacy to include testimony from the anointed folks who pass muster with her crowd, and that is my solitary quibble.

Its understandable that the doc doesnt dwell on the forensics of Jimis death, which have been disputed almost as long as their counterparts in and around Dealey Plaza in Dallas. But the history that is recorded by this august company omits the remembrances of some who are not kosher in the eyes of the new estate. Folks like record producer Alan Douglas, who guided the estate and promoted the posthumous Hendrix mystique before losing his job at the hands of Experience Hendrix LLCs lawyers; electronics genius Roger Mayer, who first introduced Hendrix to the wonderful world of effect pedals, in December 1966 and collaborated with the guitarist until Hendrixs death in 1970. Hendrix once called Mayer the secret of my sound; Kathy Etchingham, who lived with Hendrix in a flat on Brook Street and later wrote the memoir Through Gypsy Eyes; Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Pete Townshend, the guitarists most blown away by Hendrix prowess when he came to town.

5962141,3,B00F031XPS,"First of all, watching this documentary, you wouldn't know that Jimi had a brother.  Jimi and his brother Leon grew up together.  You might also believe that Jimi's dad supported him in his musical pursuits.  He did not.  Jimi's dad Al considered a career in music to be impractical and did not buy Jimi any guitars as he said he did.  Jimi's aunt bought him a guitar.  Jimi's grandmother (his mother's mother) spent time with him when he was little while his dad was at work.  She was half Cherokee and told him old legends of the Cherokees and this had an influence on his songwriting.  Another influence on his songwriting were the science fiction novels he liked to read.  For example, the phrase ""Purple Haze"" came from one of those novels.  He liked Bob Dylan's lyrics and these also influenced him.  Another important issue is that Michael Jeffrey, his business manager, hid away most of the money Jimi earned from his concert performances, money that has never been found.  Let's hear more about his playing style, too, his technique.  Just what is he doing with his guitar?  Instead of having a bunch of talking heads saying ""He was great!,"" have them describe why he was great.  They are all simply too vague.  These are a lot of the details that deserve greater attention in a documentary about Jimi Hendrix.",1384214400,25,1319,4.6695652173913045
5962142,5,B00F031XPS,"For a brand new 2 hour documentary the low price is on the mark. This film does Hendrix' career justice by including a wealth of studio material, photographs, and many sight and sound examples of live performances.

As Jimi's first manager (ex-Animal Chas Chandler, one of its better interviewees) states convincingly, Hendrix was not a tragic figure and his warm and fun loving but shy personality is evident throughout the film.  His early death is tragic to be certain, but his short life's work is infinitely brilliant.  The film is heavy on the 4 compressed years of his recording career and manages to include interviews with those who knew him best during this period. Kudos to the film's compilers for drawing on the important recollections of the now deceased Mitch Mitchell, Noel Redding, and Chas Chandler.  Wouldn't be complete without the views from his bandmates and they are in ample supply here.

Not only is his virtuoso playing in evidence, it is also emphasized that Hendrix was not only a brilliant guitar stylist but a composer and sound shaper of the highest order.  His collaborations with sympathetic engineer Eddie Kramer were magnificent sonic statements and a strong argument is made, in spite of false notions that Hendrix was spent, that if not for his manic touring schedule and money woes and, finally, his death there would not have been many more amazing efforts by the two of them.

I remembered thinking that when he died that he had ""probably peaked anyway"", which was a callous way for a 19 year old to rationalize his loss, the end of such an immense talent who had contributed so much to the musical landscape of my youth.  I could not have been more wrong, it is painfully obvious from this film that Hendrix was going strong and the music was still pouring from him. Had he transitioned to managing his finances and lifestyle even nominally, this film (in statements by Kramer and others) leaves no doubt his recording output would have continued and reached new heights.  One of the better rock n' roll documentaries for its highlighting of its subject's music.",1384214400,26,2103,4.851955307262569
5962143,3,B00F031XPS,"This show was a fine production , on a par with anything so far done, but still misses the major untold story that explained why Hendrix was so central to the American Experience. It was his aboriginal (Cherokee) ancestry that accounted for his naturalism, which , far more than drugs or psychadelia, explained his sonic innovations and the extraordinarily fresh perspective he brought to all of contemporary music. That is why the most perfect synthesis of American popular music up to that point was probably Jimi Hendrix.  Had someone like Charles Schaar Murray been hired as a consultant, this point might not have been missed.

The film is excellent.  They went to great lengths to find material that explained where this guitar hero came from and what drove his musical ambition.  He pretty much played guitar every waking moment.  His guitar became an appendage of his body and its voice was the voice of Hendrix' soul that still speaks to us today.

5962151,4,B00F031XPS,"I waited with great anticipation for this release. The previews with the unseen Miami footage
had me really excited to see this production. Understand, this was presented on television on the PBS American Masters Series. This is NOT a look at the sordid details of his drug use or the way he died. What we have here is a look at his life and his music....his wonderful, glorious music. In that endevour, the film succeeds quite well. Using interview segments from friends and bandmates (several who are now deceased), an interesting look at his journey and his struggles emerges. He WANTED to be the best, and as manager Chas Chandler says, ""By hell he worked at it.""
The film explains how Jimi tried  to be BETTER each day. Comments from Paul McCartney,
Steve Winwood and Billy Cox are icing on the cake. The  interview segments from Fayne Pridgeon and Collete Mimram are a welcome surprise and touching addition to the film.
Eddie Kramer in studio showing how some of Jimi's incredible songs were constructed is amazing to see. The new Miami footage is astonishing and while some think that Experience Hendrix is holding back some, there may in fact not be anymore. Many times when the camera angle switches from Jimi
to the crowd, that sometimes means that the cameraman stopped shooting (yeah it happens) so filler footage is used. We do get some of that but what we do see will blow away the most jaded Hendrix fan. While the music is the main attraction here, the thoughts of Jimi's friends and fellow musicians mean a lot to the overall feature. In my view, this film makes the DVD documentary
""Jimi Hendrix/ Voodoo Child"" which came in the ""West Coast Seattle Boy"" boxset obsolete.
(that one WAS a waste of time... I only watched it once). It is also superior to the 1973 Joe Boyd produced ""A Film About Jimi Hendrix"" but Hendrix completists will want that one in their library (I do).
I have to admit that by the end of the film I was moved at the words expressed and the music as it faded. We see a portrait of a man who really had no one to take care of him or really share his thoughts with. He took his journey alone with just his music and his musical vision to carry him through...and that's kinda sad. The viewer is left with a real feeling of what was truly lost when Jimi died.
The performance extras on the DVD while not up to modern standards (picture quality wise) are worth seeing and will take you back to a golden era in Rock history.
