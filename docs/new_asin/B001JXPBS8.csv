3662113,3,B001JXPBS8,I realy like the DVD it is clear and the sound is wonderful. It's a good starting DVD for beginners.,1297641600,13,100,4.05
3662114,5,B001JXPBS8,"I took an introductory, 6 session Qi Gong class at the community park this summer and wanted to continue with it.  The physical and mental balance it's brought me is amazing.  With this DVD I've gained a better understanding of Qi Gong and I'm seeing even more benefits from it.  Mr Pei teaches as a nice, relaxed pace. This program is subtitled  and with a DVD, unlike in a group class, I can go back and work on a section if I feel I need to, and I can decide what I want to do on any day.  If you're looking for a good beginner Qi Gong DVD, this is the one you want.",1296000000,109,569,3.956140350877193
3662115,5,B001JXPBS8,"I didn't really know what Qi Gong was all about.  I wanted to try something different, more meditative and relaxing then what I'd been doing.  Qi Gong feels great to do.  It might look easy, but once you get into it and really follow the instruction, the connection you feel and the relaxed energy you get is very inspiring.",1293753600,13,324,4.4576271186440675
3662116,5,B001JXPBS8,"This DVD is a very nice introduction to Qi Gong, specifically the ""8 Pieces of Brocade.""  The instructor is good and provides a lot of detail and suggestions on modifications, if you need them.  Qi Gong is a slow moving practice with nice flow to it and ideal for anyone.  The mind-body connection from the movements and breathing as instructed is wonderful and somehow both relaxing and energizing at the same time.",1291939200,14,416,4.75
3662117,5,B001JXPBS8,"This DVD has really taught me Qi Gong well.  He takes you through each piece carefully and points out tips and things to look out for along the way, plus adds some things to expand what you are doing.  Between learning the moves of the 8 Pieces and the extra things, some routines and his background infromation that he provides, this is a great and I highly recommend it if you want to learn Qi Gong.",1290556800,11,401,4.2631578947368425
3662118,5,B001JXPBS8,"Chris Pei is a great teacher that made learning Qi Gong easy and fun.

He teaches you the 8 Pieces of Brocade, with some modifications to use as you get stronger, and added some other extra things to work with that are not part of the 8 Pieces which I also enjoyed.

Really worthwhile way to learn.",1287705600,14,298,4.2105263157894735
3662119,5,B001JXPBS8,I really like this and how it teaches Qi Gong.  He presents the material in a way that I could follow and like the variations shown as you get comfortable. The bonus routines are also really good in helping me develop focus and some additional strength.,1282435200,139,253,4.5
3662120,5,B001JXPBS8,"Qi (or Chi) Gong is a great way to exercise to control breathing and to relax and this video has helped me learn it to get those benefits with lessons that make it easy to understand.

I definately feel more relaxed and giving myself some time to do these exercises is now something I am getting into the habit of doing now for the last couple of months.  I am also gaining some flexibility and strength.  Hugging The Tree (one of the extra routines in addition to the 8 Pieces) has helped make my upper body stronger.",1278115200,132,518,4.319587628865979
3662121,5,B001JXPBS8,"A very good DVD to learn Qi Gong. The teacher really knows how to make things clear in the instruction.  Before buying this I did some research on him - his background is very impressive in martial arts and teaching.

On this video he teaches the 8 Pieces of Brocade, with variations that can be added when you start feeling stronger. You can work on an individual piece or work them all together if you like. There are also a few extra practices in addition to the 8 Pieces. I have been really enjoying it so far.

Some real nice options in case you need them, such as subtitles, and good information about each Piece and what it is designed for, plus some general information and practice things to keep in mind.

Overall, I am very pleased with this.",1273536000,467,753,4.39568345323741
3662152,1,B001JXPBS8,The first DVD would open to the menu selections but when item selected on the Menu it would not open. I returned and received the second DVD quickly. I played it thru one time along with another DVD of the same subject but made from another seller. I was showing it off later in the day and it would not activate at the same location with  the defective 1st DVD.

My muscles are more relaxed and I can now turn my head to the right again!

I like the instructor. He is easy to understand and follow. Make sure you listen to his introduction before trying the excercises, it is very helpful.

Also, I find that even just fitting in five minutes during the workday helps me destress. Highly recommend it for beginners like me.",1508803200,10,586,4.4672897196261685

3662209,5,B001JXPBS8,Very good presentation and easy to follow. I am using it to familiarize myself with the movements so I can decide how to refine them for my personal best. I recently found out that 2 of the muscles in my rotator cuff on both sides are basically shredded and useless. I decided that Qi gong and Kung Fu workouts are best for me.,1496620800,,327,4.2063492063492065
3662210,2,B001JXPBS8,Frustrated my first time because looking at him and listening was confusing.  It would help beginners to have him say right leg when he is moving his left one so that our right leg and what we are seeing are the same.

3662216,4,B001JXPBS8,"I enjoy the teachings and the pace, for an absolute beginner like myself, is perfect but once you get the hang of the practice, you almost have to get a new DVD, otherwise it's like attending a beginner class at an intermediate level.

3662218,5,B001JXPBS8,"I've practiced Tae-Kwon-Do for 20+ years, and the hard style is challenging to a body as it gets older.  I wanted a stretch & health program, so I could continue to be active as I get older.  I came across Qigong, and this video motivated me to get involved.  It is excellent. Unlike Tai Chi, this is not a martial art. I think of Qigong as simply the Chinese version of (Indian) yoga.  Simplified for sure, but coming from a martial arts background, both Qigong and yoga can help with circulation and flexibility.  I tried yoga over the years & didn't stick with it, as it focused tremendously on stretching (not comfortable for me).  Chinese Qigong has the practitioner standing for virtually all exercises.  No leg above head attempts & no ribbons or blocks to extend a stretch.  As for the video, here's the good.  The person doing the movements (Chris) is also narrating.  This is not always so with these types of videos.  Chris is a real martial artist - it's very evident from his delivery that he's not just some random actor (he's very knowledgeable & good at motivating).  There's lots out there to learn, and many good teachers.  But, Chris Pei is a top teacher, and Qigong is an excellent form of exercise to maintain health in your body.  If you've been considering Qigong, give the video a chance.  Most videos don't have such an experienced narrator actually doing the forms as well.",1485907200,9,1399,4.630081300813008

My son is Autistic, and we try to do some form of body exercise at night to help calm us for sleep. We got about half way through it before we both lost interest. Each movement was painstakingly discussed and variations were also modeled. I know Qi Gong and Tai Chi are practiced slow movements, and the irony is not lost on me that we wanted a faster pace, but my son and myself need continued flow or it loses our attention pretty quickly. If you've never done anything like this, and have some patience to learn, this would be a great video to purchase.

3662289,5,B001JXPBS8,I have always done external styles and have had many injuries and my muscles have always been very tight. I got the DVD and followed along with all 8 qigong exercises and all I can say is what a difference just after my first haphazard attempt. My center upper back feels alot better as does my neck which I had almost broken while rolling in jui jitsu about 15 years ago I've delt with chronic pain ever since but after one time my neck feels about 300% better. Internal Qigong is the real deal not to mention the Chi surge I got in my back and arms from doing the advanced punch exercise. So if you've been doing external martial arts and the years have not been kind to your body do yourself a favor and try Qigong I found this DVD to be excellent.,1460937600,15,751,4.186206896551724

It's not meant to be the kind of thing that has you dripping sweat or sore afterwards. There is the physical aspect of the movements but you also correspond your breathing and awareness to these movements so it becomes a meditation.

However,  I  was  very  disappointed  when  I  found  that  the  exercises  were exactly  the  same  exercise as  the  Tai-Chi  For  Beginners  dvd. Again,  the  exercise  instructions  are  the  same!!  The  only  difference  is  the  wording  &  title.  This  dvd  wording  is  in  bold  blue  letters  and  the  title  is  Qi-Gong  For  Beginners.  The  Tai-Chi  For  Beginners  dvd  is  in  red  bold  lettering.  In  addition,  this  is  not  Qi-Gong. In  the  past  I  had  purchased  a  vhs  with  instructions  on  Qi-Gong  and  the  lessons  in  this  dvd  is  not  even  CLOSE  to  the  lessons given  on  my  vhs  tape. I  also  studied  Qi-Gong  awhile  back  at  a  martial  arts  training  center. Each  instructor  there  taught  various  disciplines  of  martial  arts/exercises  including  Qi-Gong I  think  Bodywisdom may  have  mis-packaged/mislabeled  this  dvd  because  this  instruction  is  identical  to  the  Tai-Chi  For  Beginners  dvd.

3662343,5,B001JXPBS8,"Qi Gong for Beginners is a great complement for enhancing Qi which is the life force and the miracle of healing. This book is similar to Saam Medical Meditation. When you practice meditational practices like Tai Chi, Yoga, or Qi Gong try incorporating the Saam Meditation Technique into your procedure. This is a meditation based upon a 500 year old Korean Acupuncture Technique. Instead of only focusing on the chakras or third eye, Saam Meditation technique brings one's Qi and attention to acupuncture points on the hands and feet. In doing so we can specifically target each of the twelve primary organs like the heart, liver, lungs, stomach, kidneys, etc. Meditation upon the hands and feet strongly stimulates the brain and intensifies the sensation and healing effects of Qi across the whole body. Saam Medical Meditation has pictures of the four point acupuncture combinations for each of the organs. Each point of the meditation is easy to locate. Learn about one of the most fascinating and adventuresome meditation techniques you will ever experience. This may be the deepest that meditation can go. Try it!",1436572800,3,1118,5.081521739130435

Also gives a mini philosophy session by way of an intro that puts you in the right frame of mind to practice Qi Gong. I will say that, after watching a bunch of videos on the 8 Pieces of Brocade, the movements here are not the same as what is generally practiced elsewhere, hence the ""Beginners"" tag. Instead, Pei has simplified the exercises, making them easier to remember and perform. I didn't have any trouble stepping up from these to the more typically practice exercises, and enjoyed this introduction to Qi Gong immensely.",1423267200,10,651,4.6695652173913045

3662399,5,B001JXPBS8,Very pleased with this course and his one on Tai Chi which I bought together.  I only wish he had added his warm up exercises to this video as well as his one for Tai Chi as I like to do those warm up exercises and have to switch DVD's from Tai Chi to Q Gong when want to do the Qi Gong.  He explains the moves very well and as they are somewhat simpler than those in Tai Chi it is easy to follow even though he is facing you and so therefore some moves are a mirror image of what you are to do.  Unlike a class where instructor is in front and facing away from you so you can follow more easily what he is doing.  But the explanations are clear and he has a nice voice and his minor errors in English are not at all a problem.  Background sights and sounds help to augment the moves and he does a good job of explaining what he is doing and why.  Excellent course for beginners.,1416355200,3,879,3.88268156424581

I attended mindfulness workshops and did the belly breathing and these all helped to a certain extent, but I still had to cope with some feelings of anxiety.  I was determined NOT to use drugs for this condition, I was willing to try anything but drugs.  I followed Chris Pei's instructions for Qi Gong and have been doing it for about a month.

I now feel in control of any anxiety that may try to now occur.  The other methods helped up to a point, but Qi Gong helped me be in control.  I don't understand it all, but I'm sure it has to do with the muscles movements and breathing.  This dvd was the best thing to happen to me in my battle with anxiety.

I'm not perfect, but when stress and anxiety try to come on, I can now be in control and live my life.  I highly recommend this dvd.",1410566400,15,869,4.155688622754491

one or two whenever I played the DVD but I can see if I was disciplined and did it every day, I would get stronger.  I prefer taking a tai chi/ qi gong class to using a video for this form of exercise.",1406851200,8,969,4.508571428571429

3662471,5,B001JXPBS8,"I recommend this! Years ago, while over seas, I experienced a few injuries, my left foot, my left hip, my left knee. Made it impossible to go back to a regular workout routine. After returning home, I was hurt while working, this time it was my back. Try as I may, I could not, get back into a workout routine. I tried so many different ways to get back into some kind of a workout. I could not make it stick. This Qi Gong for Beginners was just a last ditch effort to try anything. I bought a book, just to sample it. After a few weeks, I decided to buy this DVD. It is a nice subtle, almost soothing workout. I feel no pressure to perform or push myself and then aggravate one of my old injuries. After a few weeks, I am noticing a difference. These routines, are helping. It is not an overnight change, it is slow, but I do feel the change. I have even gotten my Mother to try, and she is slowly getting the hang of it. I am encouraging my friends to give it a try also. You can do just the basic moves, or the advance. Work on what you can, and do the routines that are right for you. The 8 Brocades are a nice way to begin, each one is its own segment, you can work at your own pace, choosing the right ones for you, and when you are ready move on to adding more. Chris Pei guides each routine in a slow, calm manner. Easy to understand, peaceful, and slow.",1405468800,5,1362,4.011029411764706

I have a hard time right now doing 6 sets of each as it requires a lot of time. My goal is to master these beginning exercises and then move on to moderate qi-gong. I also feel my back has been benefiting from these exercises. It is still to early to tell on my digestion with the single lift and press. Time will tell. Over all I'm satisfied with the product

He is very graceful and his voice is pleasant and patient, and embodies the Chinese quality of virtuosity. After a while you will begin to learn the moves, but I still enjoy playing the video for a refresher on correct posture and technique. The video is presented in a beautiful setting, next to running water in a lightly forested environment.

I would note that you will probably want to to seek additional material that focuses on the mental aspects of qi gong a bit more, but I cannot fault him for this as its out of scope for this video. At this price, I am very well satisfied.",1394928000,4,743,4.503703703703704

He shows you how to do the moves as a beginner, and then how to make them a bit more challenging. All the while encouraging you not to push yourself too hard, but move at your own pace, to go slowly and gradually get comfortable with the moves. Other exercise videos I have purchased go through the moves so quickly it is difficult to learn them and keep up, that is not the case with this video.

I've been doing this program for about a week and I am totally amazed at how much more energy I have. I am also much more relaxed and much stronger. I do physical work and end up having sore muscles at times. I've noticed less of this since I've been doing this program. It really stretches my back muscles out. The nice thing is there is an easy version and then a harder version once one gets stronger. If I would have known how effective Qi Gong is I would have started it earlier.

We have been doing them for 6 weeks now and feel much better, more engergized - we get up each morning and start our day with these excercises.  Also, notice changes in my waist line, hips - losing/shaping in those areas even though this is not fast paced or real cardio type excercise!  Noticed after this weekend and working in yard, when I came in to relax and do other things around house - that I was not all sore or hurting like before.  The stretching really does amazing things to our 50 something bodies!  We feel much better and are amazed at our energy levels now, plus we are more calm about things due to Chris Pei's teaching of breathing and remaining relaxed while doing the excercises!",1363564800,11,918,4.473053892215569

Qigong (pronounced chee kung) sounded like a mystical mess at first.  After taking Aikido for a while, my Sensei recommended some Qigong.  His integrity is of the highest degree, so I took his advice.

I live in New Orleans, where no Qigong teacher actively teaches.  So I turned to video.  I had used a ""Yoga for Beginners"" by body wisdom media that I was very impressed with.  Same with this one, I am very impressed.

After performing Qigong along with the video for two weeks, I woke up with really loose shoulders.  Even though I had fell asleep on my couch, I still felt like I had just received a massage.  Two coworkers commented on my quiet dimeanor after two months.  According to them, I am easier to get along with (I can get cranky).

Once you learn the moves, it only takes 10-12 minutes to go through all eight of them.  Well worth the time and money, I recommend this too everyone.",1360368000,12,1017,4.340425531914893

I notice a definite improvement in my health from practicing these exercises, both immediately after and thoughout the day.  Chris Pei's instructions are clear and easy to follow.

3662693,4,B001JXPBS8,"I was truthfully a bit dubious about this - but the doctor keeps saying ""low impact"", and I was noticing that my range of motion was becoming less, as my years become more. So, I did some research, and kept reading about ""Eight Pieces of Brocade"". Chose this DVD because a) I'd heard of Chris Pei as an instructor b) it was the best priced for a guy on a fixed income.
This is deceptively simple; the very first exercise I tried said to do something very simple - raise my arms straight over my head, fingers interlaced, palms up. Standard stretching move; been doing it for years. No problem, right?
Sometime in the past, I had stopped doing that, and never noticed. And couldn't do it.
I can now.
THis is not for strength training, there's not a lot of hopping around on one leg or anything. The movements are broad, simple, and oddly satisfying. If you do them one after another, you can do the whole set in less than thirty minutes... and if you can't complete a motion, you do what you can.
Level: easy
Frequency: Daily or every other day

However, if you want to skip the advanced ones, you have to use your remote to go back a lot, or just wait them out. It interrupts the flow of the ""play all"" feature.

I also appreciate that the DVD has nice subtitles. I can't figure out if there's actual wind blowing or if that's just for effect. There are times when I feel the sound is muffled, but it could just be my hearing. I was wondering if the wind was the problem.

I'm not entirely sure this is for beginners. I've never had any instruction for Qi Gong, and some of the moves are rather hard for me. I'm an able-bodied person under 40, but still it's a bit more of a workout than I had thought. I'm doing Qi Gong on the recommendation of my acupuncturist who says it's a ""medical"" therapy. Maybe... I haven't decided yet! I bought the dvd made by my doctor's office, and it was relaxing and probably actually for beginners, but the quality and background were so horrid, I sought out this alternative.

He demonstrates the beginning exercises plus more advanced. But he never puts them together in a flow you can follow.

It was then that I knew without a doubt there was absolutely nothing conventional allopathic medicine (therapy and dangerous drugs included) could do for me. Though a series of sessions with a good chiropractor provided relief, it was thanks to meditation and mind control that I finally completely got over my sciatica. Now I have been sciatica free for 15 years, but I would often have neck and back pain problems due to bad posture or tension, and two or three years ago I also started having pain on my upper left arm. Depending how high and in which direction I raised my left arm, a sharp pain would remind me something was seriously wrong with it. My low back pain was also there. Whenever I had to stand in the kitchen for more than 20 minutes chopping veggies or preparing a meal, I had to take a rest and sit down for a while due to discomfort or pain on my lower back. Only a few months ago, I came on Amazon and saw this DVD and ordered it right away. I started by watching the tape very carefully two or three times, trying not to miss any detail in order to follow Master Chris Pei's instructions as faithfully as I could. The results are next to miraculous. I could feel energized right after my very first session. Five of six sessions later, I realized that my left arm was not aching any more.  The next day, when I got on my Pilates machine to do some strength training, I realized I could raise my left arm as high as I wanted without any pain whatsoever. I was free of my lower back pain in about only 8 or 10 sessions. Thanks to QiGong, I can now stand at the kitchen countertop for as long as I want, with no pain. I can move my left arm, back and forth, high and low, with no pain. I have read two or three books on QiGong and there is one concept that I found very interesting. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, there is only ONE illness: Qi stagnation. This means that if the Qi flows freely, we are also free from disease. QiGong has worked so fantastically well for me, that I have every reason to support that belief. Thanks to QiGong, I am 100% pain free.

*{Master Chris Pei's instructions are crystal clear and to the point. Bravo!}

Note: In relation with other reviews, I must say that QiGong is not only about movement. It also requires strong involvement of the subconscious mind or, in other words, it involves meditation, or getting the mind to reach, at least, the Alpha level. It is for that reason that I think these exercises should better be practiced AFTER watching the DVD, not at the same time. Master Chris Pei, is obviously not in the Beta level (conscious mind level) at the time he performs the movements.

UPDATE. September 6, 2012

Later I found Dr Yang Ywing Ming' s DVDs here on Amazon which, in my opinion (together with Master Chris Pei's DVDs) are also among the BEST DVDs one can get to practice and learn about QiGong. I have ALL of Dr Yang's DVDs on QiGong and will continue to buy every DVD Both Chris Pei and Dr Yang may come up with in the future. I have the whole DVD series ""Understanding Qigong"" by Dr Yang. Each DVD is about 3 hours long and is a wonderful tool for those of us who not only want to practice Qigong but also understand the reasons why we should practice it and the best ways to do so.

Another Update: June 2013
I have continued practicing Qigong, mainly Chris Pei's and Dr Yang's DVDs and I have no words to express all the benefits that I am getting through its practice.",1312675200,443,3799,4.351198871650212

3662790,5,B001JXPBS8,"The title fits this DVD perfectly. There's a ""How to use this DVD"" section and an interview with instructor Chris Pei where he describes Qi Gong and its uses. The exercises themselves are easy to follow and the narration is slow and detailed. He also give advanced variations for each move, which makes this a DVD you can grow with. If you're interested in yoga, all of the bodywisdom media titles I've tried are well-made and very informative.",1310428800,13,444,4.705128205128205
3662791,5,B001JXPBS8,"Not being able to see any sort of preview and being unfamiliar with Qi Gong (but familiar with extremely poor quality instructional videos), I was hesitant at first to purchase this DVD- Don't Be!!! Chris Pei's serene nature gives meaning to the calm, strong beauty of Qi Gong.

The format is clear and simple. Each step is shown slowly and carefully. The pace is such that you can follow right along as he does each movement- no annoying rewinding or pausing is necessary to follow the movements. There is also no excess chatter to wait through before beginning an exercise - the history of Qi Gong is in a separate chapter that you can watch when you like. Chris Pei just explains each movement in very simple words and then shows when to exhale and inhale. Movements start out at a manageable level and progress in difficulty while still being very gentle and calming.

The video quality is excellent and is shot in a beautiful location by the side of a lake surrounded by trees. Audio is clear and the music (also very peaceful) does not overpower his voice.

I purchased this for a friend who severely injured her back. She is recovering, but is unable to do other forms of light exercise and her doctor suggested Tai Chi or Qi Gong. She is thrilled by it and finds it the perfect form of exercise being simple- and yet challenging in a way that evolves at her own pace as she heals and grows stronger. All in all, a perfectly beautiful Qi Gong video for beginners and regular practicers alike. I am happily impressed!",1310256000,125,1523,4.5510948905109485

It can be used by beginners but has much material that one only can absorb after it is read several times.
I recommend it highly.",1309132800,4,322,4.095238095238095
3662794,3,B001JXPBS8,"after having sampled and practiced several beginners qigong DVDs, this one resonate much less with me and felt less satisfying as a practice. I would have liked to see the entire sequence of moves as one continuous flow of practice at the end of the DVD, as an option.

I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that the 8 routines advertised on the cover is in fact the 8 Brocade, one set of practice, not 8 different sets. And sometimes the angle of the camera or the distance to the performer made parts of the posture/move unclear.

I do like the alternative modifications he offers for each move.",1307750400,114,603,4.574074074074074
