8647894,5,B00J44WI8K,"I watched this show as a kid in the very early 1960's, and I have been looking for a collection like this.  If you are a silent film purist who only wants to see digitally remastered versions with restored intertitles and a newly recorded version of the original score, then this DVD will not be for you.  But, this early kids' TV show was a creative way to re-purpose silent movies to make them accessible to kids.  The show makes use of severely edited versions of films, adds Cliff Norton's unique narration that had nothing to do with the original movie, and the result was a show unlike any other out there.  There is absolutely no irony or sense of being condescending in the treatment of the films - they were handled to make them fun for little kids of that era.  I can't say how any little kids of today would react to this show, but as a former kid who loved this show, this was the best sort of nostalgia.",1429574400,2,916,4.3023255813953485
