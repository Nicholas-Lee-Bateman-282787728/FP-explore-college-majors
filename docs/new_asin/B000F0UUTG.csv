2547285,2,B000F0UUTG,"My wife and I are huge Monk fans, Season 1-3 were great; but when Sharoana left the show so did the flavor. We still enjoy Monk and the original cast but Sharonas replacement just does not fit his character at all. I have seasons 1-3 and doubt I waste my money on season 4. I think I will switch to another show.",1150502400,16,312,4.048387096774194
2547286,4,B000F0UUTG,"I thoroughly enjoyed the season except for the character of Natalie.  She's obnoxious, condescending, and just way too cutesy.  She doesn't have the emotional connection with Monk the way Sharona did.  Sharona was a little over the top, but she had personality and the chemistry between her and Monk worked.  Natalie is boring and annoying.",1149811200,15,340,5.127272727272727
2547287,3,B000F0UUTG,"Season 4 definitely wasn't the best Monk season.  The first half was very good with great episodes like Monk Gets Drunk, Mr. And Mrs. Monk, and Monk Goes Home Again.  The second half, however, was a load of garbage.  The episodes are POORLY written.  For example: in The Captain's Marriage episode when the Captain got a divorce, it confused me how they didn't mention it in any following episodes.  This season probably features some of the worst Monk episodes like Monk Goes To The Dentist,  The Big Reward, and Monk Goes To A Wedding.  Anyway, this is good to get if you are a big fan of Monk.",1146528000,8,596,4.462962962962963
2547288,5,B000F0UUTG,"I really enjoy this series because it's so different compared to the other 'mystery' series out there. It usually has it's moments that you just can't stop giggling. Monk's problems are totally understandable (for I have some OCD as well) and I liked how they set it up to where they're careful to not to make 'fun' of the disease.

The ONLY problem I have is not from the series per say, it's WHY IN THE WORLD ARE THE SEASONS SO SHORT??? It's on about 2 months and that's it. Then we have to wait months to even see new eps. Other than that, it's worth the time and money to buy the DVD's set.",1144713600,17,594,4.165217391304348
2547289,5,B000F0UUTG,"Season Four of Monk was the best season yet. Tony Shaloub proved that he is funny in any situation (as Monk). The season also dealt with the other main characters in a more in depth way,  giving Ted Levine,  and Jason Gray-Stanford,  a chance to show us more about their characters lives. The Captain's Marriage,  and Mr. Monk Goes To The Dentist, gave us a different view or aspect, if you will,  of both of them. I especially liked Jason Gray-Stanford's debut as a so called rock singer (very funny). My whole family has been watching Monk from the beginning,  and we love this show!!!",1142985600,32,587,4.542857142857143
2547290,5,B000F0UUTG,"Season four of Monk is one of the best seasons so far. The episodes  are:

I then bought all the Seasons on Amazon and love it! I missed this show and am currently through 5 seasons in 1 month lol. Monk is a wholesome show and feels like a long lost family member. It takes some getting use to once Sharona left but Natalie is now in my good graces. Good for people who like detective shows, comedies and family shows.

I bought this season while it was on sale for $5. I love Monk and I am so happy I found a high quality streaming option.

However, I would not pay the normal price for the separate seasons when I could purchase the entire series on DVD for $70. For me personally, the convenience is not worth the amount they are asking.",1484438400,3,552,4.401960784313726

We have some episodes on DVR but we still had to forward through the commercials so this DVD was MUCH more enjoyable to watch. While I think we shouldn't have to pay for what we can watch on TV, I justified this purchase by giving it to my boyfriend as a gift and this really is our ""go-to-happy"" show. We Love Monk!

Adrian Monk and the actor that plays him (Tony Shaloub) are comedic geniuses. Each episode sucks you in and you find yourself completely absorbed, but laughing too. It's a great series and one that, nicely, has no cussing, no inappropriate situations or nudity so kids can watch it. That's rare these days. I highly recommend this series. Start with the first season and watch from there. You will not be disappointed - except when they are all over.",1435622400,,551,4.575757575757576

2547424,1,B000F0UUTG,"LOVE the series!

This review is about the digital version of the season - which I love.  I just hate the fact that I can buy the DVD version and only spend about $14 on it - plus get free 2-day shipping as a Prime member.  But if I want to just buy the digital version and download it, well then I have to pay double ($30).  Nevermind that there's no shipping involved or any cost to record it to a medium (DVD or blu-ray)...maybe it's some kind of 'convenience' charge, which is BS.

Like I said I love this series, but this review is more about the price gouging of digital products.  From now I'm going to be leaving bad feedback for every digital product that has succumbed to this, as well as leave feedback directly to Amazon for it.

For the Monk show, though.  I give 5 stars.  :)",1431820800,,789,4.172185430463577

Of course, Stottlemeyer notes that this arrangement will be on a year  to year basis, which is a wink to the Monk viewers who  lie for each year's renewal. The cases are a hoot as well this season, with Monk competing with another consultant whom he is convinced is 'cheating'. Another episode deal with the death of  Mrs. Monk, Trudy, which can't be discussed without a spoiler. This is a banquet for Monk fans with lots of inside humor.",1426550400,,605,4.383928571428571

Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his new devoted Assistant, Natalie. Throughout this season Monk returns home on HALLOWEEN, stays in bed because he's sick, gets drunk, goes to a fashion show, figure out who would want to poison Stottlemeyer at the Christmas party, gets amnesia, stop a killer astronaut, and figure out if Trudy Monk had faked her death.

The captain's marriage crumbles, Julie tries modeling, Randy speaks up for himself, and Monk has several breakthroughs with the help of Dr. Kroger, although the main character's tragic core remains, and is central to the show.

I still have to say that I miss Bitty Schram tremendously; Howard just doesn't quite fill the void, although she does her best.

2547622,5,B000F0UUTG,"I'm not really a TV person.  As my manager Blane over at the trophy shop would tell you, drunk or sober, ""Ramiro's family in Mexico couldn't afford a television set when he was growing up, so he got to miss out on a lotta culture.""  He's a bully.  Now I just ignore him.  Yes, we did have a TV; I just didn't watch it!  My grandmother did all the watching, enough watching for the whole family. Blane knows all the TV shows you could imagine, just like my Tita did -- may she rest in peace.  Times have changed since my Tita watched TV, but just like her, Blane's down with TV -- reality TV and even actuality TV.  But his favorite are all the crime scene investigation thingies, just as my Tita's favorites were her telenovelas and Columbo.  Monk really tickled Blane's fancy, because it's freaking funny - intelligent but ridiculously humorous at the same time.  The first time he recommended Monk a few years ago, I thought he was just teasing me.  He had been drinking again and kept slurring loudly, ""Have you seen the new Columbo?""  I vaguely remember seeing the ""just one more thing"" detective in Mxico, with my Tita sitting next to the wood stove in the kitchen.  With a flashback of memories, slapping me around harder than Blane has ever slapped me around in the production-and-assembly room of the trophy shop, I got a little misty because I do miss my grandma yelling instructions and clues at Columbo on Sunday evenings, and I told Blane he didn't know what he was talking about, that there could only be one Columbo.  Blane nearly tripped over his shoelaces, steadied himself on the trophy assembly table, wiped his spittle with the back of his hand and stuttered, ""This guy's better than Columbo!""  I didn't pay him much attention then -- Blane was NOT going to get me hooked on TV.  I loved my Tita, but I also know that her TV watching produced more of the sorrow that she was trying to get rid of by watching it.  Funny thing is that he was right.  Blane was right - I don't mind admitting it now, years later, now that Blane's ex-wife and I, and sometimes Blane's kids, sit in the living room of Blane's ex-house, drink Blane's ex-beer and watch Season Four of Monk on Blane's ex-television set.",1214006400,,2214,4.4812967581047385

All seasons are a must in order to ""...do it the Monk way...""

In season four, regardless of ""flinching"" once, our detective later is flinchless as he once again gets his man.

My only complaint for season four - is that lovely Natalie is coiffed and dressed ridiculously for part of it (where did those frills come from?  And the chopped hair?)  The wardrobe improves and in season five, she is stunning.",1208476800,,510,4.7727272727272725

Season 4 joins the regular cast in some pretty fun episodes.  There's one involving Monk's brother that truly had me on the edge of my seat, John Turturro plays the reacurring role of Monk's brother with masterful skill.

Malcolm McDowell and Jeffrey Donovan also make appearances in different installments.

There's also an episode involving Monk taking in a toddler that was hilarious and heartbreaking.

An exceptionally frustrating experience occurred when I watched the 4th disk and it froze up in the first episode. No matter what I tried, I couldn't get it to work. I put it in my DVD player, my computer, tried three different software programs and I couldn't get it to work.

Suffering from Monk withdrawals, I contacted Amazon customer service. What followed would cause anyone to rate 5 stars, I believe. Consider: I'm in the Army in Afghanistan, calling customer service by internet phone. I explained the problem to the representative and how, because of low bandwidth, I was having problems completing the return process online. The representative was very helpful, and sent a replacement season 4 out to me. He also sent a prepaid label for me to return the defective season back, since I couldn't print one here. Imagine how surprised I was when I had the replacement within a week. This in a place that often takes 3 weeks for a letter or package to be delivered.

I wish they had closed captioning so my TV guardian would take it out. In a previous season there is a beach scene & I just knew we'd have to send the kids out or FF it-but if you can believe it-the scene was decent!!!  You will laugh out loud, and yell ""Pause it"", if you have to leave the room.  The way Monk is devoted to his wife's memory is so touching.  Monk is intelligent & believeable, very well written!

When I received this as a Christmas gift I was elated, although the next few nights were filled with MONK and his antics as a phobia-ridden, ousted detective, solving case after case, yet never quite able to get back into the police department.  It's more than a commedy.  It has action for you guys who, like me, need their dose of adrenaline.  It has touching romantic sequences about him and his wife, the one murder Monk has been unable to solve.  It is, however, filled with comedy.  Sometimes this comedy takes you to the edge.  One scene has Monk filling in for an English teacher.  No problem, right?  Wrong.  He believes he must write his name on the blackboard so that the class knows who he is.  What follows is excrutiating.  Every letter, every line in every letter must be perfect.  Tony Shaloub has made his mark upon the world with this character.  Although he's played many other parts, this part is taylor made for him and he portrays it to perfection.  I can hardly wait to get the next season.",1171584000,8,1064,4.49738219895288

And Monk solves way more than one case an episode on Average, so lets dispose of that mistake, in fact one Case is solved almost accidentally as he is obsessing over another he is working on.

Monk goes again through a Wide arc in the emotions, and the most poignant show involves some references to his Wife, and exposes Monk's emotional side. The writers seem to wisely reveal more of Monk as the season progresses.

It is fairly evident that the writers seem to be trying to shoehorn Natalie into the Sharonna ""mold"", but they need an actress of higher caliber to take that on. Wisely, many shows focus on Monk, and the Christmas special has a few key highlights on Captain Stottlemeyer.

THE DVD: Nice Menu Setup. However, it seems like the running joke seems to be to make an order mistake ( See disc four and the Clip cover, that differ). Oddly enough, whilst the Show sound is mainly 2.1, the special about the writing process, too short at 15 minutes, is in 5.1; The behind the scenes may have been in 5.1 as well, but I was disgusted that such a potentially good topic is under 4 minutes.

Tony Shalhoub is still the Master of this show. He still embodies the ideal that the creator of the show discussed in the season 2 special, but he has lost his main counter-Character, the ""Watson"" character , aka ""Sharonna"".Thankfully at least in the writing they are making some attempts to remedy the error of that change.",1170460800,,1619,4.530821917808219

2547654,4,B000F0UUTG,"""Monk"" is one of those intelligent cult shows that usually dies a quick and painful death -- and this is one of the few that has lasted more than a few weeks. The obsessive compulsive detective returns on DVD with his fourth season of bizarre, seemingly unsolvable crimes, from homicidal dentists to amnesia.

As the season opens, Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) encounters a nasty new obstacle -- an inept private eye, Marty Eels (Jason Alexander), has suddenly become better than him. Everyone thinks Mart is a genius -- but Monk knows better. And when Eels' case explodes in his face, he calls on Monk and Natalie (Traylor Howard) to bail him out.

As the series goes on, Adrian deals with all sorts of weird cases -- murderous dentists, black widows, a case of amnesia that has him thinking he's married to the town weirdo, a wine tasting, a stolen diamond with a million-dollar reward, deals with his boss's marital problems, fashion models, and a Christmas party that turns deadly. Worst of all, he's called on to do jury duty, and has to solve two crimes without leaving the room.

And on the personal front, Monk reunites with his even-more-neurotic brother Ambrose for a Halloween mystery. But when Adrian shows signs of overcoming his disorder, Natalie sees what seems to be his dead wife Trudy walking around San Francisco -- and she's implicated in a murder.

""Monk"" just wrapped its fifth season (which wasn't quite as good as this one), which is something of a record for any semi-intelligent TV show. And for the fourth season of a detective series, it has aged quite well -- the stories are still unusual and cleverly written.

The writing is still quite solid, albeit with one or two lesser episodes (""Mr. Monk and the Captain's Marriage"" just feels incredibly awkward). But the comedy and unique crimes continue, to the point where Monk can even solve crimes without leaving his bed. And the series continues to chronicle Monk's struggles against his OCD, while reminding us that he could be worse.

The characters continue to be well-fleshed out: We get some flashbacks to Monk's school years. And though more time has passed, he's still in love with his late wife -- one of the most charming scenes of the season has him slowly turning in the snow, thinking of Trudy.

For the supporting characters: Stottlemeyer's marital problems continue with shocking results, and Randy Disher's secret rock'n'roll dreams get revealed when he quits the police force. And we get to see more of Natalie's background -- she comes from a moneyed socialite family, complete with a snotty mom.

The fourth season of ""Monk"" is still solid and enjoyable, with the lovable obsessive-compulsive detective. Solid work.",1158278400,7,2710,4.901746724890829

2547669,5,B000F0UUTG,"Monk Season 4 is one great season to add to your Monk collection. If you've never seen Monk before, I recommend you watching seaons 1-3 just to get up to date on who this guy is. Monk goes all over the place in this one. From bumping his head and losing his memory, to hearing Lieutenant Disher claim he saw his dentist murder a man while he was under sedation, to even having another detective come in and show him up during a crime. This is one great set of episodes.

This 4 disk set comes with 16 episodes full of great comedy, drama, and even some suspense as you can't help but try to solve the cases before Monk makes his big revelation on who did it and how.

Episodes Include:

Monk and The Other Detective: Jason Alexander guest stars as another detective who starts showing Monk up with his seemingly implausible ways of solving the case. While others think he is a new genius, Monk believes the man is faking.

Monk Goes Home Again: Halloween is here and someone is stealing candy from kids who trick or treated at Monks old home. It doesn't seem that important until the death of a security guard is brought up with it.

Monk Stays in Bed: Mr. Monk gets sick for the first time in his life. But while he is in bed he must solve the case of a murdered judge that includes a pizza boy.

Monk Goes to the Office: In this one a millionaire gets his hand broken by someone who also kills a security guard. Monk is sent undercover into the office building to find out who did it and why.

Monk Gets Drunk: In this one at a wine tasting party Monk gets drunk and remembers talking to a man the night before that no one can seem to remember. Did he leave or is something else going on?

Monk and Mrs. Monk: Monk starts getting over his O.C.D. However things look bad when Natalie and others start seeing Monk's dead wife, Trudy, walking around the city.

Monk Goes to a Wedding: After Lt. Disher is hit by a car while arriving at the wedding of Natalie's brother, Monk suspects the brother's wife is the one who did it.

Monk and Little Monk: After seeing an old flame from middle school, Monk has flashbacks to when he was a kid.

Monk and the Secret Santa: A police officer is poisoned after drinking a bottle of wine he got during the Christmas season. Monk has to find out who did it and why.

Monk Goes to the Fashion Show: After his shirt cleaning lady asks Monk for help for her son, Monk learns the young man has been charged with a crime he could not have committed.

Monk Bumps His Head: Monk gets hit in the head after trying to find a new lead on his wife's murder and wakes up in a small town. While there he still has his cime solving skills and takes on the case of a murdered waitress.

Monk and The Big Reward: Monk must find a stolen diamond worth 1 million dollars. However he is not the only one after the reward for whoever finds the diamond and returns it.

Monk and The Astronaut: In this one Monk must prove a famous astronaut killed a woman while the man was in space when the murder happened.

Monk Goes to the Dentist: Lt. Disher claims he saw his dentist kill a man while he was under sleeping gas in the chair. No one believes him, except Monk of course.

Monk Gets Jury Duty: Monk has to solve a case he is one jury duty for, but also has to stop a drug kin pin from escaping the same courthouse.

This is one great set of epsisodes. Every single one has a different unique twist and plenty of laughs. The murder revelations are also great to watch to see how they unfold. If you are a Monk fan or even a crime solving fan, buy this season.

Highly recommended.",1152662400,,3596,4.215743440233236

2547671,5,B000F0UUTG,"Everyone's favorite obsessive-compulsive phobic detective is back!  Police consultant Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) has sixteen more cases to solve.  They're sure to leave him terrified and us helpless with laughter.

In this batch of episodes, Monk is faced with a brand new set of puzzles.  Who shot the pizza delivery guy?  Why did a masked man break a stock analyst's right hand?  Did Monk's late wife fake her death?  Who tried to run over Lieutenant Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford)?  And how could an astronaut commit murder when he was in space?  While working on answering these puzzles, he must face the challenge of dealing with the dentist, the flu, a cubical, a hangover, and amnesia.

Once again, the plots here are a little on the thin side.  Heck, Monk usually tells us 15 minutes into the show who done it.  The problem is figuring out how the person did it.  I usually can't put all the pieces together until Monk explains it at the end, and then I feel foolish for missing it.

Of course, the heart of the show is the humor.  The writers go out of their way to put Monk into situation that make him uncomfortable to show him over reacting to things.  Yet they keep him human, making us care for him.  This is best shown in ""Mr. Monk and the Astronaut.""  In one scene, we're laughing at his reaction to the laser pointers, the next we're feeling sorry for him as the suspect in the case belittles him.  Yet by the end we're proud as always of the way Monk overcomes his fears to save the day.  Overall, this keeps Monk human.

Of course, the show works because the acting is so good.  The actors take the material and make it shine.  The cast is lead by Tony Shalhoub who brings Monk to life expertly.  This is the first full season with Traylor Howard as Monk's new assistant Natalie.  I may be in the minority, but she continues to grow on me each time I see her.  There is an innocence and sweetness that compliments Monk so well.  And Ted Levine and Jason Gray-Stanford continue their great work as the police who constantly have to call on Monk to solve their hardest cases.

Unfortunately, this season does have a couple of negatives.  While Monk's wife's murder is mentioned a few times, that storyline seems to have been dropped.  I like the few clues we were given each season to advance that story.  And this season has the single worst episode of the show yet.  ""Mr. Monk Goes to the Dentist"" misses the comedy mark and becomes really dark really fast.  While I liked the fact they made Lt. Disher smart for a change, the rest of the episode just didn't work for me.

Those who have been buying the previous seasons know what to expect here.  All sixteen episodes are presented in widescreen and Dolby sound on four discs.  The set is light on extras, this time giving us only two both on the last disc.  The first is a fifteen-minute look at the process the writing staff goes through to create an episode, looking specifically at ""Mr. Monk and the Big Reward.""  Despite what the box says, the actual second bonus feature is a brief profile of Jon Perkins, the detective who consults on the show to help add a bit of realize to it.

On the whole, this is another fine season of a great dramedy.  This is the perfect way to preserve the show to watch over and over again.",1151452800,32,3294,4.452261306532663

As the series continues season after season, the lieutenant is played more and more as a dim wit, Monk becomes peevish and silly and childish, episodes become weaker and more preposterous and repetitive, and more maudlin and sentimental. The only real center is Ted Levine, whose is a tremendous actor, who can move from rage to vulnerability, from distracted to acerbic, while remaining consistent in character. By the way, the series producer stated he stole the idea from Sherlock Holmes --- I'd say he ripped the idea from Agatha Christie's Poirot, and the series by the way is, in general, more plot driven, more character driven, and better written and acted overall than Monk.",1518566400,,1004,5.054216867469879
