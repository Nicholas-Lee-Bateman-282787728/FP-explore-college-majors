8026235,4,B0002CX18O,This workout was awsome! I love the energy that the Tae Bo team possess and the enthusiasm they instill in you as you are working out. The balls are a really handy tools for beginners or advanced exercisers. It was somewhat of a challenge but you really feel good after you succeed through it! The balls can be used with any other Tae Bo workout too! Give it a try!,1140652800,,365,4.228571428571429
8026236,1,B0002CX18O,"I bought this DVD knowing nothing about Billy Blanks and his background. Big mistake! First, the exercises are made with a little ball that you have to purchase separately (something I did not do). Second, the routines are not preceded by any sort of explanatory segment, so you get right into it without having learned proper techniques. Finally, I have to stay I cannot stand the way he makes participants yell ""Power!"" every couple of minutes.",1138579200,4,446,4.881578947368421
8026237,3,B0002CX18O,"This set contains 4 DVD/video's. Foundation teaches you the proper execution of the techniques, that differs slightly from earlier Billy Blanks video's. Energy does the same but in a slightly higher tempo. The two remaining DVD's are Power and Strength (my personal favourite). ""Capture The Power is the best I know"" Billy Blanks says in the note that comes with the DVD's, but the experienced Tae-bo warrior will find something wonting here. Billy talks a lot between sets, does the sets slow first many times, the fast sets don't last very long and he makes use of yoga like warm-up techniques. All these factors deduce from the sweatiness which is still my main criteria for a good workout. The choreography of these workouts is pretty good, I would give it an 8 out of ten. And for overall sweatiness a 7 out of 10. Those experienced with Tae-bo will not find these tapes too challenging. For people that want to get into tae-bo and are looking for 45 minute workouts, this is the thing to buy. Advanced Tae-bo practitioners should buy either the original Tae-bo tapes or the Get Ripped series, that are in my opinion still the best in the field.",1117152000,27,1150,4.698019801980198
8026238,4,B0002CX18O,"I workout regularly with Tae Bo and use pretty much all of the programs that have been available up to now.  I love them all.  I love working hard!

This set of programs is different from Billy Blanks' many previous ones in several ways.  Billy has broken the work down into four elements:  Foundation, Energy, Strength and Power, and bases the four workouts on each of these themes.  There are new combinations of moves and new music, and together they create unique workouts from the previous ones.

At first I didn't think I liked them, because they are more broken up into little chunks.  That is, after doing the moves slowly, the number of cranked-up reps that follow is fewer than in previous Tae Bo programs.  I thought I wasn't getting as much of a workout, but, in fact, it was just as good.  My heart rate was in my target zone, and I took as many, if not more, steps.

It's nice to see the participants getting a little older (same folks, updated looks), and the studio setting is more updated and colorful than previously.

I miss the older workouts and will probably alternate between the older ones and the new ones.

If you're looking for something different in Tae Bo, give these a try.  But don't expect an Advanced Advanced workout.  These are more modulated, but they'll do the trick just the same.",1109808000,17,1318,4.548936170212766
8026239,3,B0002CX18O,"The workout was a good one, however I personally had a hard time keeping up sometimes -- Not because it was too hard, but because his feet were all over the place. More then likely it was my fault for being uncoordinated. The workout can still be felt today, the morning after. However, I don't know that I would personally pay money for this tape (I borrowed it). Also, it requires the Tae Bo balls, which I didn't have, so I couldn't do a small portion of the workout. This tape included 2 workouts.",1109116800,,501,4.340425531914893
