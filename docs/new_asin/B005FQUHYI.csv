8470554,5,B005FQUHYI,"This is one of those classic family movies that you can watch while munching on a bowl of popcorn in your lap.  It's got you falling in love with the characters right off the start.  It touches on delicate subjects, one of those being parental loss and shows how with love and gentleness you can overcome any obstacles.  It shows the struggle of a guilty conscience when one lies and teaches the greatest truth of all that telling the truth really does set you free.  It's perfect for the entire family!!",1352332800,3,504,4.5054945054945055
