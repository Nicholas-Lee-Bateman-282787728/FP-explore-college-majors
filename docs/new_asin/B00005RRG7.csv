1656540,5,B00005RRG7,"I strongly recommend! Originally released in 1960, the film returned to theatres 4 times in later years. This is absolutely one of the most fun family films the Walt Disney Studios ever made. There is truly something for everyone... comedy, action, adventure, drama, romance, and suspense. Even at 126 minutes in length, it does not feel too long. Starting in the aftermath of a shipwreck, the Swiss family rebuilds their life on an uncharted tropical island. They use the wealth of salvage in livestock, tools, guns, furniture, wood, and more to build a safe home in the trees, complete with running water and other conveniences. The mother and father begin an idealic exhistance with their 3 boys aged 9, 16, and 18. But one day the older boys decide to take a canoe and survey the rest of the island. They stumble across pirates that are attacking the crew of a ship, and rescue the captain's daughter, bringing the wrath of the pirates on them since they are discovered.

Directed by Ken Annakin, the movie was filmed on location on the caribbean island of Tobago. While the production went way over budget for a total cost of $4 million, Walt did not get upset with his production team at the time since the film was looking to be success when he reviewed clips from the set.  As it turned out, with subsequent theatre releases, television, and video airing, the film has turned out to be one of the top-grossing films from Disney.

The tropical scenery is spectacular as they filmed all over the island; waterfalls, forests, grass plains, flowers, beaches, cliffs, mountains, oceans, streams, and much more. Contributing a tremendous amount to the exotic locale of the movie are animals, pirates, ships, and a tree house to beat all tree houses ever made. Similar to the role the submarine ""Nautilus"" filled in the earlier film ""20,000 Leagues Below the Sea"", the tree house becomes a star in it's own right. The wonderful and inventive home designed by the castaways and from the ships salvage is incredible to behold.

Featuring a wonderful cast and crew assembled by Walt himself, Mr. Disney liked to stick with actors he knew could relate to a broad audience. Most of the actors in this film appeared in other Disney movies over the years, many times with other actors from this film. Dorothy McGuire (Old Yeller, Summer Magic), John Mills (Did not appear in other Disney movies, but was Hayley Mills real life father), James MacArthur (Light in the Forest, Third Man on the Mountain, Kidnapped), Kevin Corcoran (A Tiger Walks, Savage Sam, Old Yeller, The Shaggy Dog, Bon Voyage, Babes in Toyland, Toby Tyler, Pollyanna), Tommy Kirk (Probably the most proficient of all with Savage Sam, Old Yeller, The Shaggy Dog, Moon Pilot, Bon Voayage, Son of Flubber, The Absent-Minded Professor, Misadventure of Merlin Jones, The Monkeys Uncle, Babes in Toyland), and Janet Munroe (Darby O'Gill and the Little People, Third Man on the Mountain). Most of these actors also appeared in movies for the Walt Disney television weekly anthology show as well.

VAULT DISNEY DVD VERSION
The 2 disc DVD treatment that Disney gave this film is perfect, starting with great packaging and case. It is in Widescreen, the first widescreen release outside of theatres for the film in fact. And what a difference it makes in the beautiful location island vistas of the film. The film has been cleaned up and remastered to its original brilliance with lush colors, great image and depth, it just sparkles. The DVD transfer itself is very well done, a high quality job. The audio is very clean and crisp.

DVD EXTRAS
The extras on this DVD are what really make the best version released of this film, and they are not all listed here at Amazon or even on the packaging. You have to hunt them down and get creative with your remote. So let me help by telling you what to look for if you buy this... For starters they have the original cartoon that was released with the movie, ""Sea Salts"" allowing you to see this with the kids the way that it is meant to be seen. There is a 2 minute ""1960 Disney Studio Album"", a montage of projects, attractions, shows, and films being made and released that year. There is an audio commentary as an alternate track that features comments from cast and crew.

Next we have 23 minutes from a vintage Walt Disney television ""Wonderful World of Disney"" episode titled ""Escape to Paradise"", that show the making of the film behind the scenes.  Up next is the original 1960 movie theatre trailers for the film, and the 1960 televison spots to advertise the film. Then there are ""Storyboard to Scene Comparisons""; a seperate ""Storyboard Gallery""; and a 2 minute ""Production Gallery"" of photo stills from behind the scenes at location. Another gallery is full of production stills; Next is ""Biographies"" on 8 principle actors; and then ""Concept Art"" on the films pre-production design work.

As if that's not enough a featurette titled ""Adventure in the Making"" was made just for this set, and at 49:00 minutes long it is very complete and satisfying, with recent interviews of the original cast and crew. There is great behind the scenes original footage in this piece, and the folks regale us with funny stories of the filming days. Peter Elleshaw (matte artist), Ken Annakin (director), Danny Lee (special effects), and actors John Mills, Tommy Kirk, Kevin Corcoran are all here for modern interviews.  ANOTHER short 4 minute featurette that was also made just for this set is ""Swiss Family Treehouse"", narrated by Hayley Mills (Pollyana, Parent Trap, That Darn Cat, Summer Magic, In Search of the Castaways, The Moon-Spinners), . It is the pre-opening footage and the actual Opening Ceremony of the ""Swiss Family Robinson's Tree House"" attraction (now gone, replaced with Tarzans Tree House) at the Disneyland Park. Walt Disney himself is there and it is evident he is really enjoying himself in this must-see footage.

Included on the set is a very nice 12 minute interview with James MacArthur, who appeared in this film and 3 others for Disney along with a TV movie. This features great video as well. There is a ""Pirates"" music video sing along featuring pirate themed clips from Disney films, TV shows, cartoons, and the theme park attraction ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", all set to the Disney tune of ""Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A Pirates Life For Me"". An unusual or unexpected extra is a featurette that has 20 minutes of excerpts from a 1940 non-Disney version of the story.

The dvd set has Audio Archives set to photos from the film, including 2 Interactive Sound Studios, 2 songs from the film, original 1960 radio spots. Another real treat is the complete LP soundtrack of the original ""Storybook Album"" of the movie released in 1960.

SUMMARY
I really enjoyed this DVD, and this film really got the best of treatment by Disney. They simply outdid themselves and I am one grateful viewer. I wish all the really good classic Disney films got at least some of this royal treatment. They have a reputation as the best studio about protecting their old source material, archives, etc, but they are not always generous in using it for their DVD's so I can really appreciate the effort here by the decision makers. Thank you Disney for this compilation that really honors this gem of a film the way it should be!!!! My highest recommendation if you are considering buying this DVD.",1044144000,316,7386,4.801730920535012
1656541,5,B00005RRG7,"I don't remember seeing this as a kid, but as an adult I am a huge Disney fan, so I felt the need to see it at  least once. After I saw it once, I had to own it! I already owned some of the Vault Disney stuff and definitely reccomend everyone of them. They are incredible entertainment,untainted by the sometimes horrible world we live in. Every moment of this movie is enjoyable, and I reccomend everyone sees it.",1037404800,2,414,4.2405063291139244
1656542,5,B00005RRG7,"I think it was very kids fantasy back in 1960 to have this wonderful life style of living like the Swiss Family Robinson.  At least i know it was that way for me.  I can't begin to tell you how many times i saw that film when i was a kid.  I never had the chance to see it again until recently and when i did with the new 5.1 THX Sound i was blown away.  Floods of memories came over my body and i felt like a kid again. This is a timeless classic for every kid young and old.  This is also a lavash production produced by the magic of Walt Disney himself.  Movies like this just don't exist anymore.  This movie is pure, funny, romantic, with real life lessons of survival and wonderful fantasy.  After seeing this movie now that i'm 54, i really find myself missing the great Mr. Disney.  This is truly a wonderful addition to your collection and a wonderful part of Americana.",1035072000,4,879,4.153846153846154
1656543,5,B00005RRG7,"This film was made back in the day when Disney knew how to make a live action film. Nowadays they just make that teeny-pop junk that only little 8 yr old girls go to see. But anyway, this film, ""Swiss Family Robinson"" was one of my most favorite films when I was growing up. Man, did I want to be on that island with them. Diving off waterfalls, capturing wild tigers and ofcourse, battling scirvy pirates with the aid of coconut bombs. If that ain't livin, I don't know what is. If you're like me and love the old tales of adventure like ""Treasure Island"", then this movie is a must buy. Speaking of ""Treasure Island"", Disney also did a great adaption of this story aswell, which I recommend highly. You might also want to look up a film Disney did called ""Ship Wrecked"", which was only made a little more than ten years ago I think, but is of the same calibur as ""Swiss Family Robinson"". Enjoy!",1023321600,9,896,4.339285714285714
1656544,5,B00005RRG7,"What a fantastic DVD this is.  The Vault Disney series is wonderful, and I hope they give more films the same treatment soon.  Not only is the film beautifully restored (in its original 2:35:1 theatrical aspect ratio, and with 5.1 THX surround sound), but the DVD itself is packed with delightful extras.
There's a documentary about making ""Swiss Family Robinson"" that is nearly 50 minutes long and contains interviews with Sir John Mills, James MacArthur, Tommy Kirk, and Kevin Corcoran.  There's a commentary track with the latter three contributing comments about the film.  There's an additional interview with MacArthur about his film work, the original theatrical trailer and television spots, radio spots, the entire story album that came out with the film, a Donald Duck cartoon, and more!  If you like ""Swiss Family Robinson,"" get this DVD -- even if you already have the VHS tape.  It's worth it just to finally have a widescreen version of this family-friendly classic (the better to view the wonderful island vistas), even if you don't figure all of the wonderful extras into the bargain.",1021852800,41,1100,5.0497237569060776
1656545,5,B00005RRG7,"This adaptation of the classic story is a great and enjoyable film of a family of castaways and their adventures on a desert island.  Not a perfect reproduction of the book, but still a worderfully enjoyable show.  AND.... you can show it to your kids, which makes it 1000 times better than so many of the modern generation of films.  Lots of fun, excitement and humor are blended together with serious action.  You'll love little Francis, the imp.",1014163200,,448,4.705128205128205
1656546,4,B00005RRG7,"Walt Disney basically threw out the Johann David Wyss story, kept the title, and instructed writers to compose a rousing adventure befitting the Disney standard. It was done. What we have here is not a moralizing tale but a swashbuckling adventure, starring John Mills (Hayley's dad) and Dorothy McGuire, along with Disney favorites James MacArthur, Tommy Kirk, Janet Munro and Kevin Cocoran as well as a great villain in Sessue Hayakawa. It's not Disney at his peak, but it does have many fun moments with a storm at sea, plenty of wild animals (unlikely on such an island, but who cares), a love story (two young guys fighting over one young woman) and a battle with pirates. And the DVD has two discs with plenty of extras. We hope this, too, is a standard of the new ""Vault Disney"" series. Disney DVDs are making great strides to include many of the extras available in the studio's library. 'Robinson' will appeal primarily to baby boomers who remember it from their childhood and their children, with whom they've shared their videotape of it for years.",1011225600,8,1059,4.7923497267759565

1656845,4,B00005RRG7,"A family is shipwrecked on a seemingly uninhabited island. Using the remaining recourses of the wrecked ship they build an elaborate tree house. They have a really nice Christmas scene. Then the adventure begins.

This movie has a great family feel to it and I really liked the animal races; it is a classic Disney. Do not dwell on where all the animals came from. The pirate attack scene was suspenseful and gives new meaning to log off. You are kept wondering if, and how they will get out of the precarious situation.

Be sure to watch John Mills play a more serious role with his real daughter Hayley Mills in ""The Chalk Garden"" (1964).",1502496000,,640,4.556521739130435

It really captured my imagination and always found it to be thoroughly entertaining. The cast and the characters they played were people I could identify with and care about. John Mills displayed such ingenuity and he possessed very noble qualities. I love the extras on this edition, especially the remembrances that James MacArthur shared.

1657397,5,B00005RRG7,"What a great Disney adventure movie!  Walt Disney's feature films from the 1950s-60s are visually delightful, filled with funny moments, and have so much variety in their settings, stories, and characters.  The morals in the movies are also consistently good.  Swiss Family Robinson is the story of a family fleeing the Napoleonic Wars for New Guinea, but after being shipwrecked somewhere in the Indian or Pacific Ocean, it has to use ingenuity and teamwork to build a tropical paradise--and later protect it.  Over time, it becomes home to them.  What better theme for a movie intended for American audiences, as America has always been about coming by sea to a new land and taming the wild?  The three brothers, played by James MacArthur, Tommy Kirk, and Kevin Corcoran, and the parents, John Mills and Dorothy McGuire, make a believable family.  Their infighting is very entertaining, and yet there are lots of times when the family is just having fun without strife.  Walt Disney added a pirate subplot which is very entertaining, getting funnier over time as they seem invincible to all the traps the family sets for them.  The bright mood of Disney feature films is so different from how heavy and dark movies have become since Walt's time.  I like this movie a lot because it has elements which everyone can relate to, whether it's the family's faith in God and trust in each other, their ingenuity, risk-taking, love of animals, sibling rivalry over a girl, or having to change their expectations when life doesn't go as they expect.  It encompasses the human experience.

There are plenty of great special features about how the movie was made and what it has meant to people, and I had a really good time learning about the many challenges of filming on the island of Tobago close to Trinidad, on the audiocommentary and making-of documentary.  There are other special features as well, including the Disney TV show's promotion of the movie, through a Caribbean music group singing stanzas that rhyme about how much ""fun"" it was filming in such challenging outdoor conditions.  Walt Disney was quite a guy, and so was the director, Ken Annakin, and this movie was quite a feat, as particularly Ken Annakin explains in the audiocommentary.  (Also, I'm a little sad Disneyland's treehouse based on Swiss Family Robinson was converted to Tarzan's treehouse, but Disney World in Florida still has the Swiss Family Robinson treehouse.)

It's just a really fun and heartfelt movie with enough tension to keep it an exciting adventure.  I'd recommend it to anybody.",1424908800,,2569,4.951048951048951

1657405,5,B00005RRG7,"Loved this movie as a kid and watching it now let me be a kid all over again.  Those who complain about the details that are outside of realism are missing the fun of this movie by over-thinking.  The reality shows of today don't give kids something delightful to dream about-----catching wild animals; battling the pirates; being stranded on an undiscovered island with tropical beauty, adventure and natural waterslides.  Anybody willing to tap into their inner child will have a ball watching this clean fun movie with their family.  A GREAT improvement over the typical offerings of today with smart-mouthed, disrespectful, overly-precocious kids or crude humored animation.  Besides who wouldn't want a tree house of this magnitude----or even just the tree for that matter!?!  It's a kid's paradise----and maybe an adult's too.",1423440000,,832,5.265151515151516

1657407,5,B00005RRG7,"Reminds me of some of our family camping trips. What you can do to ""make due"" when you forgot some of the gear you were supposed to pack, minus the shipwreck of course!
When your a teen and looking for a little teen romance to tell your friends about when you finally get back home,
Then there's the little brother or sister who won't leave you alone, always tagging along and your parents asking you to keep an eye on them.

Ohhhh and let's not forget about those nasty pirates!!! there HAS to be pirates! Just plain fun... AND entertaining!

I have always loved this story I remember reading it as a child & I remember when I was finished a somber feeling came over me, it was so good I was sad it was over! I always thought how well written & well thought out everything was, from their salvaging the shipwreck for building materials to create every child's dream home in the tree's. To their saving the animals to start raising food stock & decision to scout to see if they were actually on an island.

Kept our grandkids attention and interest (ages 5-9), and we adults, despite no ""special effects"", and maybe because it relied more on story than unrealistic graphics.

1657512,5,B00005RRG7,"I could watch Swiss Family Robinson and never tire of it.  My husband and I think that we would love to live as they do (can't tell that part -- must see for yourself!)

James McArthur plays the great part of young Fritz, older brother to Ernst, and the son who can be counted on to use his head!!!!!  Watch out for Ernst though --- he flies by the seat of his pants!!!!  Little brother is ALWAYS into something.

One of the funniest things on the DVD ""how the movie was made"" is where the youngest son who is now an adult (cannot remember his name) tells of being in the water with the elephant actually standing on his face and the director yelling for him to quit fooling around!!!!!  You will want to recommend this movie to many others!!!",1396915200,,743,4.271428571428571

1657515,5,B00005RRG7,"This was a favorite with my kids and now the grandkids love it too. Doesn't matter if they are girls or boys, they all love to imagine living in that wonderful tree house, having some incredible pets and going on great adventures. NOT scary...even the pirates are reasonably kid-friendly. My advice is tell the kids it's 'all happy in the end' and they can sit back and enjoy-and so can you.",1396483200,,391,4.52112676056338

I wouldn't let my toddler watch it, but I'm pretty protective of what they watch.  My five year old liked it though.  I knew she would.  She's all about adventure and pirates.

Great adventure - who wouldn't want to live in a tree house on a tropical island with your loving family  The love, perseverance, dedication to their faith (Christian missionaries they are), ingenuity, creative, craftiness, knowledge of survival and the outdoors - WOW, did I miss anything?

One of my favorite things about this movie is that is portrays Christian men and women in strength - something sorely lacking in popular media & culture!

 Ok, there are the Muslim pirates, a few tigers, sharks etc....",1381881600,,545,4.934065934065934

1657582,5,B00005RRG7,"Driven off by Napoleon, the Swiss Family Robinson head for New Guinea.  Chased by pirates, left behind after the captain and crew abandon ship, storm tossed onto a reef, could things get any worse?  Yes.  The pirates return.
In the meantime, there's loads of fun and adventure.  They gain a new castaway (Janet Munro as Roberta, an inconvenient source of conflict between two brothers, James MacArthur and Tommy Kirk).  The youngest son (played with rambunctious abandonment by Kevin Corcoran), collects as many animals as he can (and in the process also steals the movie from more seasoned actors: Dorothy McGuire and John Mills).  There's plenty of danger and suspense but no expectation of dire consequences.  Everything is handled in such a way that no matter what is tossed at them, from snakes to hyenas, they come through it all unscathed.  Not even a rip-roaring battle sequence, where they are clearly outmanned and outgunned, poses the least little threat to the small commune.  This is as tame and safe as it gets, yet still offers the requisite amount of excitement to make this film highly entertaining.  It's practically perfect on every level; though I'm certain author Johann David Wyss might have something to say about the adaptation of his novel (dead authors are so much easier to work with).

I've always wanted that tree house.",1376697600,,1349,4.977678571428571

1657585,5,B00005RRG7,"Its a little dated so at times it seems a bit sexist like when the whole family is playing in the swimming hole while the mother sits and watches in the heat. But thats to be expected in such an old film. Lots of action and a never ending supply of pirates to battle. Has funny moments. Loaded with animals, more than you'd think would work, but it does.

This was it, and because I had not watched it in so long I immediately had to buy it.  I can't speak highly enough about this movie.  I've been watching it since I was a small child, and I'm certain my family recorded it on VHS back when Disney ran it periodically on tv.  The Disney adaptation is not completely accurate with the original novel.  They're both great though!  I can't recommend this movie enough.",1372982400,2,526,4.473684210526316

We took a trip to Disneyworld and my little girl fell in love with the Swiss Family Robinson treehouse they have there.  When we got home we bought this movie and had a family night watching it.

I had seen it as a child and really liked it. The new versions are ok, but the acting, and effort they went to do this one, is incredible. My husband got a kick out of seeing them try to ride the Ostrich. There are parts where the animals are put in situations that would stress them out, and probably couldn't be done today, and that is a bit hard to watch. The storyline, though, is entertaining, and the actors do a good job.",1366848000,2,570,4.053097345132743

1657628,2,B00005RRG7,I used to think this was the best film 40 years ago. The men in this film have the ability to make a shopping mall with just a Swiss Army Pocket knife. No one eats or uses the facilities & the women emit make up from their pores. No one rips their clothes. It is a perfectly ridiculous Disney film. I would give this film a 10 if they showed something realistic. Even the Hyenas shown in the film which are shown as vilianary creatures about to attack a helpless donkey look like they need to go on a diet and should be placed on arthritis medication. I like cheesy films but this one sat on the counter too long. Do yourself a favor and save your money. If you still think it might be worth it then rent it to find out it sucks.,1358553600,,729,4.0344827586206895

I must have seen this movie five times while it was featured. I was in love with their tree house and being a tom boy, couldn't wait to build my own, which I did. Too bad I fell out of the thing and broke my arm!

This movie holds so many precious memories of my youth, I had to buy a copy for my grandchildren. I can't wait to sit with them as they watch the ostrich races and battles with the pirates.

Wish Disney made more great movies like this one!

1657650,4,B00005RRG7,"""Swiss Family Robinson"" is Walt Disney Production's superb 1960 adaptation of the familiar novel by Johann Wyss, in which a family makes the best of being stranded on an island in the South Pacific. Disney provided a strong cast, featuring John Mills and Dorothy McGuire as Father and Mother Robinson, and James MacArthur, Tommy Kirk, and Kevin Corcoran as their children. If the movie deviates just a bit from the original story, it compensates with fun, family-safe entertainment.

As the story opens, the Swiss Family Robinson, on their way to a colony in New Guinea, find themselves trapped on a storm-tossed ship, after the crew abandons them to escape pirates. A shipwreck leaves the family on a deserted island. Nothing daunted, the family salvages supplies and materials from the ship to build themselves a new home, complete with crops and pets.

Dramatic tension is provided by repeat appearences of the pirates to endanger the family. One close escape leaves the family with a new member, a former cabin boy rescued from the pirates. The return of the pirates will force the family to stage a desperate last stand to save their new home, in true Disney fashion.

""Swiss Family Robinson"" has lost none of its charm over the years, and is highly recommended to fans of the Disney tradition of family movies.",1313020800,,1316,4.918918918918919

The 6 year old twins in the back seat were very inquisitive about this film.  We found a VHS from one of our parents to have the kids watch which was great and reminded us of what a fabulous film this is.  So good old Amazon had a DVD which we've added to our collection.  Swiss Family Robinson is fabulous family entertainment that is great for kids 5year and up.  Adventure, family conflict and resolution, and no language issues or drug use, one might say it's a bit violent when they fight with the pirates.  Overall this is a wonderful DVD.

1657659,5,B00005RRG7,"Viewers who've read Johann Wyss's original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Swiss-Family-Robinson-Signet-Classics/dp/0451529618/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Swiss Family Robinson (Signet Classics)</a>&nbsp;will see right away the mix of closeness to the original and Disney improvement in this family adventure.  (Wyss's family had four sons, not three, and he *did* make a reference to Malay pirates at one point, though he never introduced them.)  In the era of Napoleon, a restless Swiss office worker (John Mills) uproots his wife (Dorothy McGuire) and three sons--impulsive yet down-to-earth Fritz (James MacArthur), 20; scholarly Ernst (Tommy Kirk), 17; and adventurous, imaginative Francis (Kevin Corcoran), ten--and heads for the new colony of New Guinea.  But when their ship is threatened by a Malay pirate, the captain runs--right into a storm--and by the time she grounds on a reef, the family, trapped in their cabin by falling debri, are the only humans left aboard.  Salvaging everything they can move, including an assortment of farm animals and the Captain's two Great Danes, they settle down on the nearby island to await rescue.  But Father and the boys don't believe in sitting on their hands, and soon they have a splendid tree house and a thriving establishment.  Then Fritz and Ernst, exploring the coastline in a dugout canoe, rescue a young hostage from pirate captors--a supposed cabin boy who turns out to be a 16-year-old British girl named Roberta (Janet Munro).  And that, in turn, brings the pirates down on them resolved to get the ransom money she's worth.

Like Wyss's prototype, the family's island (trivia: that their name is Robinson is never specified; in fact Wyss probably took his title from the tale of another famous castaway,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robinson-Crusoe-Barnes-Noble-Classics-Series-B-N-Classics/dp/1593080115/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robinson Crusoe (Barnes & Noble Classics Series) (B&N Classics)</a>), supposedly located somewhere off the Malay Peninsula, harbors an unlikely assortment of wildlife--not only expected animals like tigers and Asiatic elephants, but also hyenas, zebras, ostriches, and even toucans.  (And who said zebras can't be tamed?  Roberta rides one.)  Yet it's a beautiful, idyllic place which, says Father, can supply everything they really need.  The rivalry that springs into life between Fritz and Ernst after Roberta joins the company is perhaps a bit overdone, but when the pirates arrive all jealousies are forgotten and everyone pulls together to fight them.  Francis's determination to catch every animal he encounters add humor, while his two surprisingly effective suggestions for anti-pirate devices keep him from being a mere comic figure, and Sessue Hayakawa is delightfully over-the-top as the Malay captain Kuala.  The climactic fight with the pirate crew is one of the msot exciting sequences Disney ever put on film.  The bonus matter includes reminiscences by MacArthur and Kirk about the incidents of filming, which took place on Tobago.",1296172800,2,3140,5.9621380846325165

I saw everything I liked about it.  First, the family is intimate and builds a wonderful kind of safe haven for itself.  I loved the ingenuity and coziness of it.  The father wonders whether they would be happier there than in a more civilized place.  Second, there is the mysterious wildlife, for which the intellectual son tries to make explanations.  I suppose it is possible, but there are tigers (possible from S Asia), monkeys with prehensile tails (only from S America), and ostriches, which I believe are only in Africa.  At any rate, they enjoy the animals in delightful play.  Third, there is the action adventure, with the defense from the pirates.  It is surprisingly well pulled off.  Fortunately, my kids liked it, too.

This is family film at it best.  Warmly recommended.",1294358400,,1001,4.651428571428571

Considering Tommy has said this was his favorite role, I do NOT want to let this opportunity to go by to rake Disney over the coals as they blacklisted Tommy and ruined the career of one of their most gifted talents.  Because Tommy worked so well with their material, and because Disney continued to rob the vaults of the public domain for most of their material makes this factor deeply more criminal than merely ""overlooked.""",1292544000,2,503,4.640449438202247

This DVD edition is also wonderful.  The second disc has several extras, the best of which is a near full length ""making of.""  This is perhaps the best behind the scenes featurette I have seen in a long time!  The film was shot on location in Tobago, and much of what you see in the film is real, not effects.  The tree house was actually built in a real tree, the boys wrestle a real (albeit sedated) anaconda in a real swamp and all the animals were brought in.  This featurette was almost as good as the movie, and really adds to the film experience.  It is narrated by James MacArthur (Fritz) and has interviews with Tommy Kirk (Ernst), Kevin Corcoran (Francis) and clips of John Mills in addition to behind the scenes footage.

This is a Disney Movie, so no one actually gets hurt in the scenes that if it were a Stallone movie, he would be bleeding and shirtless while defeating the enemy. The fact that the ""bad guys"" do not get hurt but still lose makes this a great movie for the family. Kids will learn about death, but they do not need to see it in Disney movies, and that makes this a good movie for everyone. The action is good and up paced, and the family pulls together to make the best out of a bad situation.

The action scenes are well done.  Except for the snake, you know they are using real animals instead of fake ones.  The plot line is perhaps a little corny at times (hence four stars instead of five) but that is what makes this a great family/kids movie. Treasure Island, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and Old Yeller, are all in the same class although perhaps more appropriate for slightly older kids only because the story lines are a little more evolved.

1657689,2,B00005RRG7,"Pass on this one, unless you have fond memories of it from childhood or you're buying it for kids. And this from a big Disney fan, but this was not one of Uncle Walt's better efforts.

The storyline just stretches simple logic one time too many, ok for children, they won't care. But it will leave most adults rolling their eyes. The first leap of faith comes when our brave castaways tow tons of equipment from the wrecked ship, then build the sort of treehouse you only see illustrated in a Dr. Seuss story. The not-so-humble abode is complete with running water and a pipe organ....For crying out loud, if all that energy had been spent on building a boat, they've could have been off the island already. But then, we wouldn't have a story, would we?
Can you say 'Gilligan's Island'?

And somehow, animals not native to any Pacific island are roaming around, including zebra and elephants. And incredibly, they're not afraid of humans. Heck, the family even learns to ride and race ostriches! Only in a Disney film....

Among other distractions....as is so often the case in family films of this ilk, the writer(s) seem to go out of their way to put in at least one character that's so annoying, you want to strangle them. And here, it's the family's youngest son, Francis. A prime candidate for Ritalin who runs his mouth constantly and gets in more trouble than any normal kid would. The other is the subplot involving the two oldest brothers, Ernst and Fritz (Tommy Kirk and James MacArthur), who were getting along nicely until they get their first whiff of female tail in the form of pixie-ish redhead Roberta (Janet Munro), who had been disguised as a cabin boy to protect her from the pirates. Now the boys are sniping at one another and even trade blows, more than once, thanks to those vicious male hormones, and the fact that Roberta is the only available girl on the island. One might argue there's a grain of truth here, but far too much time was spent on the brothers' rivalry.

The final assault of the pirates advancing on the family's hilltop stronghold just dissolves into stupidity. One of the first weapons the Robinsons unleash are some crossbows, which magically, only hit the pirates in their backsides. Not a single mortal wound! This is soon followed by an avalanche of rocks...some almost as large as a house, but again, the pirates get back up and keep coming. A barrage of coconut grenades proves only mildly distracting (what, no coconut shell shrapnel??), and even another avalanche, this time palm logs weighing thousands of pounds, fails to kill the pirates. It's only when our intrepid heroes break out the rifles do they actually start taking out some of the bad guys. Director Ken Annakin may have played this for laughs, but it just came off as silly.

I don't know....sometimes a film just hits you the wrong way and this one did. I didn't like it, even as a kid. On the plus side, it's a very family-friendly film. Something that's getting rare nowadays. And it IS a Disney production. Nicely photographed with exotic locations and rich, vibrant color. It's a shame that Dorothy McGuire, a lovely and talented actress, didn't have a larger role here. All told, not a bad film, but certainly more for children than adults looking for good entertainment.",1220572800,7,3292,4.718260869565217
1657690,5,B00005RRG7,"As a paperboy working for the San Diego Tribune from 1959 to 1962 I was fortunate to be treated to a free movie from time to time; a guest of the Union/Tribune.  There were several movies that we saw as a result of the generosity of the paper and  Swiss Family Robinson was one of those.  I saw this movie several times and loved it each time I did so.

The Robinson family, made up of father Robinson (John Mills), mother Robinson (Dorthy McGuire), Fritz (James MacArthur), Ernst (Tommy Kirk), Francis (Kevin Corcoran) was sailing to some destination I can't recall when their ship is caught in a storm and smashed on a reef.  The crew and other passengers are all gone, leaving the Robinson's to fend for themselves.  Fortunately, the reef upon which they wrecked was part of an island paradise.  They soon make rafts and load them with provisions from the destroyed ship and find themselves marooned rather comfortably upon their deserted island.  With astounding creativity and ingenuity they turn a spectacular tree into a tree house to end all tree houses.  In fact, when I introduced my youngest daughter to the VHS version of the movie in the late 80's she referred to Swiss Family Robinson as the ""tree house"" movie.

Eventually, in an attempt to fully explore their new home, Fritz and Ernst set out to circumnavigate the island.  On this outing they discover Roberta (Janet Munro) disguised as a cabin boy in the clutches of pirates.  Helping him (her) escape they make their way back to their tree house.  They eventually have to face their pirate visitors at the end of the movie in a climatic and gripping show down.

Directed by Ken Annakin, Swiss Family Robinson, like Third Man on the Mountain, and other wonderful Disney movies, is a testament to wholesome family movies that are exciting and hold the audience's attention without resorting to adult themes to boost profits. The 50's and early 60's were years that were truly magic at the Disney studios.

I highly recommend Swiss Family Robinson to be shared with your children.  It is best viewed as a family.

The cast is wonderful, even though they are supposed to be swiss, but are made up of Americans headed by a British father.

The big race near the end is a classic!  The commentary on that scene is great, too.  The movie takes place over the course of a year or so, I suppose, and writer and director do a good job of showing just enough detail about one sequence before moving the story forward--treehouse under construction then done, etc.  A journey's start, middle, and end, etc.  The pacing is fine, the film doesn't drag, in my opinion.

The brothers are fun, the father is great, and if the women characters are dated...well, there's nothing completely unforgiveable here.  There's no blood, it's family fare, but it rings emotionally true, and I enjoyed all the different relationships between the characters.

The special features are great!  I've got to say that all of the Disney Vault dvds have the most awesome special features around, and they lay them on thick--there's so much to see!  I especially enjoyed the making of feature, and the commentary on the main film.  I decided to buy Pollyana after buying Parent Trap and this one just because the Vault treatment is that good--the second disc is like a very enjoyable history lesson.  As for the commentary, they should have just included Kirk, MacArthur, and the director--the threesome interacts quite nicely, and the separate Corcoran commentary that they edited in just interrupts the flow, even though he had good things to say.  Still--it's a wonderful commentary.

Ernst trying to ride the ostrich, the logs rolling down on the Pirates, the rescue of the animals from the stricken ship on the reefs, and yes, that amazing tree house.

1657715,5,B00005RRG7,"Walt Disney had a winner with this adaptation of the book of the same title by Johann David Wyss.  The book itself was a fantasy with bits and pieces of the new world aggregated onto a single island in the Pacific.  The book fantasy makes for a rousing adventure as a family is wrecked and abandoned near a tropical paradise.

We meet the Robinson's at the beginning of the movie.  The Late Dorothy McGuire, who also appeared in Disney's ""Summer Magic,"" ""Old Yeller,"" ""Friendly Persuasion,"" and numerous other movies and television shows, plays Mother Robinson.  The Late Sir John Mills, one of the most beloved actors in England and father of Hayley Mills and Juliet Mills, plays Father Robinson.  James MacArthur, who has been in a number of other Disney films and was Danno in Hawaii Five-O, plays Fritz Robinson.  Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran, also Disney regulars, play Ernst and Francis Robinson.  The Robinson's begin the movie in deep trouble.  They are below decks on a sailing ship that was headed toward New Guinea.  As we later learn, the ship was going to New Guinea when pirates appeared.  The captain evaded the pirates, but ran into a storm.  The crew then abandoned ship, leaving the Robinson's behind.

The Robinson's wreck on a reef not far from a beautiful tropical island.  The island is paradise, but paradise with the most interesting collection of wild animals imaginable.  There are zebras, hyenas, a tiger, at least one snake that was an anaconda according to the book, a baby elephant, and ostriches.  Imagine a circus train wrecking on this island and you will get the general picture.  The island also proves to be a very nice play to live, especially after the family recovers as much as possible from the wrecked ship.

The family builds a marvelous tree house with running water and a master bedroom suite.  Soon there are sidewalks, games, and a castle of sorts.  Fritz and Ernst encounter Roberta (played by the late Janet Munro), and in addition to surviving on the island, the family gets to witness two young men fighting over the only available girl.

Life appears to be going well except for the danger of the pirates, whom the family encounters three times in the movie.  Between the pirates, the wild animals, the shipwreck and fighting over Roberta, this movie is full of non-stop action!

Walt Disney put pure magic into this adventure movie.  The story is interesting and easy to follow.  The family conquers adversity, remaining positive throughout.  There is mild violence, but so mild that the movie was able to keep a G rating.  I think this movie is a winner for all but the very youngest family members.

This 2-disk release is filled with extras that are generally enjoyable.  There is the short that went with the movie when it was originally released.  There are interviews, making of, and all sorts of related tidbits that make this 2-disk set a must have for fans of this movie.  The best part of all is that this movie is in wide screen, which is enough reason to throw away your old version, especially if you have a wide screen television.

I have watched this movie in the theater, on television, and on VHS tape.  As many times as I have watched this movie, I enjoy it each and every time.  Take a trip into the adventuresome past for an outstanding and fun family movie adventure.  Enjoy!",1156118400,9,3350,4.7172413793103445

1657717,5,B00005RRG7,"""Swiss Family Robinson"" is one of those rare classic films that you never tire of visiting time and again.  Walt Disney crafted his films with such care and attention to details, that all of his films carry a special kind of magic that most films fall short of achieving.  Disney's ""Swiss Family Robinson"" surpasses the adventure film spectrum by combining the perils of an English family with the beauty of an island paradise, which is filmed in glorious technicolor and features a stellar cast.  John Mills and Dorothy McGuire play the parents of three sons, James MacArthur, Tommy Kirk, and Kevin Corcoran.  The story is loyal to the book and tells of the pirates, the discovery of a pretty, young girl, and the wonderful tree house.

1657718,5,B00005RRG7,"""The Swiss Family Robinson"" is a movie for the whole family.  In a time when family films are few and far between, where even movies categorized as ""Family"" have questionable language at times, and themes.

This movie though hits all the right qualities of a great family film, and also leaves out all the questionable language and themes.

The plot by itself is intriguing, that of a family shipwrecked with nothing, and then trying to survive in a beautiful but dangerous world.

The Cast is superb.  Most of the cast are a part of the Disney stable, most even playing together in multiple other Disney films, but the acting is so flawless, and the story so fresh you forget that you've seen Ernest as shaggy dog and Fritz as an indian (light in the forest an obscure Disney film), or Francis as Toby Tyler.  The two exceptions to this are Father (you'll notice that you never know the name of the Father or the Mother) who is played by John Mills, Hayley Mills' father in real life.  In the extras you see behind the scenes of the families playing, and Hayley is there.  She had just finished shooting Polyanna which is also a great vault disney edition.

The other unique cast member is the lead Pirate.  He is a famous japanese actor that in the extras left the rest of the cast awe struck.

For me though as good as the cast was, the best parts of the movie are:

1.  The island itself, it's completly beautiful.  They filmed the movie on the island of Tobago of the coast of South America.

2.  the Tree house,  Every boy at least that has ever watched this movie has dreamed about having a house just like this.

3.  The adventure, the animals, the island, the pirates, it's everything that a boy dreams about

This story is based on a classic book by Johnathan Wyis, and is done up rather well by the Disney stable of actors like Tommy Kirk, and Kevin Cochoran. Also Patrick McGoogahan is outstanding as the patriarch. I know I cringed when seeing the scenes with Fritz, Ernest, and Roberta as I'm sure that both wanted her so bad. I know that they were willing to fight to the death for her, and I know that it always seemed as though Ernest got the raw deal. Well chances are Roberta wasn't interested in Ernest that way, so she did the next best thing she could do for him as she still cared for him as a possible future brother-in-law. She would talk with her grandfather to see about making him a captain of the British naval fleet.

Annakin, and NO it is NOT funny to see the poor animal in agony, neither do I believe that it is healthy to have dogs fight with a TIGER !!! animals do NOT act, they are always themselves and violence is violence...scripted or not!! The zebra in the pit with the Hyena's is probably the most stomach turning piece of cruelty that happy bunch of macho men of the Disney crew perpetuated in the higher goal of a perfect movie(the script girls and his wife were a bit upset says Annakin in the commentary...but whoop-de-doo weren't they cry babies....aaah women!!)...so NO, I can't watch animals being FUNNY, because they are NOT...they are just suffering and waiting for the day they can be released from that living hell called fim making they had to endure take after take....just a little electric shock for the zebra laughs Annakin, why he had it administered to himself and it was HARMLESS....mmmm...pity they didn't turn up the voltage that time Ken !!",1100217600,11,1853,4.632218844984802
1657727,5,B00005RRG7,"This is a really good movie. Especially for little kids.... but hey, we're all little kids at heart, except for scrooge, but it's still a good movie. Both versions, new and old.",1088985600,2,177,4.5625
1657728,5,B00005RRG7,"I saw this movie about every other week growing up, and I still think it is the best of a slew of great Disney films from the 70's.  I think anyone can appreciate this movie.  It has a moral sensibility you don't find in movies these days and the pace and flow are very distinct as well.  Disney flicks from this era are period pieces of a sort and they don't deliver the bang of a modern film.  Even so, they resonate somehow and I heartily reccomend this one and others like Old Yeller, Where the Red Fern Grows, Hot Lead and Cold Feet, Bullwhip Griffin and a host of other Disney fare from that era.  With all the new tools available to Hollywood today you can lose the ability to enjoy films like this, so buy some and pop them in the DVD player on a rainy afternoon.",1063670400,5,771,4.147651006711409
1657729,5,B00005RRG7,"I Just GOt My DVD on Saturday.
I haven't even had time to look at all of the special features yet but I love the fact that when they put this out on DVD that they did a specail edition 2 Disc DVD. I always loved this movie with John Mills, Dorothy McGuire, James MacArthur, Tommy Kirk, Kevin Corcoran. I suggest this movie to anyone who likes good clean Disney fun.
Here is a breaf story line for anyone who has never watched this movie.
The Robinsons get shipwrecked on a island. And they have all sorts of adventrues. This is just a great movie.",1062374400,4,547,4.219047619047619
1657730,5,B00005RRG7,"I just received this DVD last night and viewed the first disc (I haven't even gotten to the second one!) and I can tell that THIS is a keeper! This was once, way back in the early 1970s, my FAVORITE FILM, my personal ""Star Wars"" before there was a ""Star Wars"". I saw it at LEAST 5 times in the theater! However, until last night, I hadn't seen this film in its entirety in, I estimate, about 30 years! And it is GREAT!!! Beautiful widescreen image (I can only imagine how great it looks on a 16x9 TV screen), an audio commentary with director Ken Annakin, James Macarthur (Book 'em, Danno!), Tommy Kirk (Tommy Kirk!?!? Where has he been all these years?!?) and Kevin ""Moochie"" Corcoran, and a Donald Duck cartoon!
The film is impressive for a number of reasons -- special effects were either in-camera or so well done that you aren't aware of them, and the stunts! The stunt work was coordinated by the great movie stuntman Yakima Canutt (who worked for many years with John Wayne), and let me tell you -- the gag in the Endor battle in ""Return of the Jedi"" was taken directly from this film (I won't give it away, it's terrific when it happens).
One of Disney's best live-action films, and definitely fun for everyone (no matter how big your family is)!",1052784000,2,1254,4.456521739130435
1657731,5,B00005RRG7,"I was amazed that the two disc set had such wonderful tidbits and not just a re-transferred disney movie like some of their other titles being released on dvd. I bought this DVD because I remembered with such fondness as a child seeing this movie many times. It seems longer than I recall, but I am not complaining! The movie was a treat shown in widescreen, although sometimes I really wish I had a large widescreen tv to see it on. there is a treasure trove of behind the scenes documentaries, interviews of the main actors, and other disney treats. Also loved the cartoon presented at the beginning of the movie, just like classic disney movies at the theatre.",1047254400,2,663,4.579831932773109
1657732,4,B00005RRG7,"""Swiss Family Robinson"" is one of those great live action Disney movies that never seems to get old.  When a family is shipwrecked on a deserted isle they must keep body and soul together and ward off pirates from the mainland, just to stay alive.
By far, this is the best represented of all of the ""Vault Disney"" series.  The transfer for this DVD is by far the best this film has ever looked.  Colors are rich, bold and vibrant. Having said that there is still some edge enhancement and shimering of fine details that distracts from time to time.  A few scenes are very low in contrast in shadow delineation. The audio is stereophonic and very well represented, though dated. Interesting aside: the film's credits are framed in the 2:20 aspect ratio that the whole film was originally shot in but the rest of the feature falls back to a 2:35:1 aspect ratio - strange!  As with all ""Vault Disney"" issued movies, there is a ton of great extra features to recommend this disc.  That and a relatively clean transfer make for a fun night in front of the television for the whole family.  Enjoy.",1046736000,5,1091,4.535714285714286
