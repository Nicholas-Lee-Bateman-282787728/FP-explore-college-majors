8513830,3,B007BHA2I0,"As a kid, I absolutely hated this movie.  As an adult revisiting it decades later, I finally recognize that this is a low-budget Art movie, which uses metaphor as a part of its psychological characterizations.  Not that it is a great film, but it was quite interesting, with a lead performance that was quite effective.  Yet, since this is a product review, I have to complain that this pricey DVD is NOT the original R-rated edition of the film!  Going to YouTube, I have verified that a moment or two of nudity has been replaced with very grainy footage, and (no pun intended) snippets of the film's most violent elements have been toned down.  Not that this hurts the film much, but a part of my purpose in viewing it is to study the original film, and why it received its R rating.  I've shelled out full price only to receive an edited-down version of the film...possibly one that had originally been shown on late-night commercial television, as evidenced further by the fact that this is a pan and scan version rather than widescreen.  Shame, shame, shame!!!  When I pay full price, I expect either to see the complete original version, or to have an announcement made about exactly which edition of the film I'm buying.  Due to the differences in frame-rates as a result of format conversions, there is no way to use even a precise running time anymore to tell whether a complete version is being viewed.  The running time on this edition may be quite close, but there are definitely some images that have been removed, and others that have been replaced with grainy substitutes (during the few sensual/nude scenes).",1435276800,2,1624,4.706713780918728

8513832,1,B007BHA2I0,"This movie was quite possibly the worst thing ever put onto film. Storyline made no sense. Strange music that had nothing to do with the scene that was being shown. Then again maybe it did, when you go this far into bad movie making this maybe the music that is required to really propel this from a terrible movie to the next level of total garbage. I really can't believe someone wrote this. Even harder to believe is that with all of the people this had to go through to actually make it a film, no one said ""This is complete rubbish. You should be basted in honey and strapped to an ant hill for wasting the life of the tree that was killed for the paper to write this on."" I don't understand how they got the film to accept this being printed on it.

Yes, it is that bad!",1396137600,,776,4.139072847682119

8513834,1,B007BHA2I0,Why was this made. Why did I waste my time...when I could have been watching ANYTHING else. Completely dissatisfied. Smh.,1382486400,,121,5.1
8513835,1,B007BHA2I0,"I am writing this review as an act of mercy!  Do not waste any money on this pathetic turd of a movie! It is boring!  It has nothing to do with the Friday the 13th movies.  The movie was originally called The Orphan and the distributors knew they had a turkey on their hands and tacked Friday the 13th onto the title in order to rip off the unsuspecting and make some undeserved money.

I saw this turd in 1982 on Cinemax at 2 o'clock in the morning.  I have never forgotten it.  I am fifty years old now and a movie lover.  I have over a thousand DVD's and over half are horror films.  THIS TURD IS ONE OF THE WORST FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!

An orphan boy, living with a black man on this island in a big house with servants, is not allowed to put jam on his toast.  So, he has a major hissy, kills everyone, and the final scene is him eating toast with jam on it...the end.

That's the story.
I'm not kidding.

Yeah, there some other stuff in it but you don't care.  There is nothing engaging in the movie.  There is no one likable.  The worst thing for a film to be is boring.  The Orphan wallows in boredom. There are murders, but even they are boring.  One murder...I'm not sure what happened.  It looked like a stuffed monkey came to life and killed this guy.  Don't ask.  It didn't make any sense in the context of the film either.  There is nudity but there is no one in this film you want to see naked.

This is just a bad film.
I curse the distributors for continually bringing this wretched turd back.
It needs to be buried and left to rot in the empty limbo hell-hole it was pried out of.

Have I mentioned that THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN?",1369958400,14,1674,4.067484662576687
