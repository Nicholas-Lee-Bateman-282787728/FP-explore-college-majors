8188510,4,B000P2A5WQ,"Intolerable Questions is a collection of short films by independent film maker and writer David Baeumler.
David's short films have played at many film festivals the world over such as The Los Angeles Film Festival, Bennial of Moving Images, Geneva, Anthology Film Archives, NYC and VideoEX, Zurich. When we were asked to review a collection of independent films, I jumped at the opportunity. This is a first for WebbWeaver but I am hopeful it will not be our last. There are several short films included on the disc and every one comes with its very own unique message and voice. I fell in love with the short film Kuboa and found it haunting and beautifully written and narrated. I Cannot Understand You is quirky and fresh and I laughed out loud a couple of times while watching it. Safety is deeply moving and made me question the importance of so many things including my own existence as a human being. Amazingly, I had never heard of any of these short films nor had I heard of David himself until a friend and colleague suggested I follow him on Twitter...and the rest is, shall we say, history!

I feel like I have been living under a rock, having never been to a film festival and have officially added that to my list of things to do. Thank you so much, David for not only having the artistic talent and flow to create these wonderful little films, but for giving me the opportunity to view them and love them.
I am giving Intolerable Questions a 4-star rating and urging you to see this collection of independent films and to broaden your horizons as I intend to do. ""Character is the ability to govern which thoughts become action."" -David Baeumler-

8188511,4,B000P2A5WQ,"The short films on this DVD all express the sensitive and intelligent sensibility of the filmmaker. The writing is ironic, poetic and evocative. The visual control is assured and expressive. These are shorts that you will want to watch again many times, as they have multiple meanings, and provide a lasting pleasure to the viewer.",1241136000,2,331,5.036363636363636
8188512,5,B000P2A5WQ,"I highly suggest watching David's films more than once, it's addictive. Each time I watched I got more from it. I can't wait to see his next film short when it comes out. You may want to consider buying 'Intolerable Questions' as gifts for film lovers and specially if they are film festival goers.  He is so good I can't even find the words to describe...............",1211500800,2,368,4.575757575757576

  Thusly, when I received a copy of David Baeumler's Intolerable Questions as a gift, I placed it near my DVD player and there it sat for six-or-so weeks.

  On this lazy Saturday morning I was taking a break from cleaning my room when my gaze fell upon the IQ jewel case.  Having just retrieved coffee and a breakfast sandwich from the local DD, I decided to pop the DVD into the slot and give it a spin.  I figured, ""Let's see what my old buddy Kevin has come up with this time.""

  Within moments, my sandwich ceased to interest me.  I found myself hurtling into a place in my mind that I have always known is there, but had avoided contemplating.  Not so much ""Here there be dragons"" as ""I have found an equilibrium from which to operate"" (TR, TEPTAE video), and jeopardizing that equilibrium disturbs my calm.  With a speed that sears my senses and yet with a deliberation that forces full absorption, No Day No Night imploded my view of my milieu.

  So intensely was I affected that I was compelled to hit the ""STOP"" button before continuing to the next piece.

  YMMV, but I am the kind of person who feels that, having invested my time into an experience, I have a vested interest in receiving maximum effect.  I didn't have to work at it with No Day No Night.

  Press ""PLAY"" at your own risk.",1191024000,2,1505,4.405109489051095
