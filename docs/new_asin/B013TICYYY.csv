This is slow motion boredom. Ridiculous. Emperor's New Clothes.  If this were performed in New York the staging would be booed. Estonian audience is too polite too Nordic to do that maybe in part as a sign of respect to Arvo Part. He deserves better, much better. I recall ""seeing"" Wilson's staging of Lohengrin at the Metropolitan. There, like here, I felt sorry for for the performers who have to put up with something like this.  I enjoyed Lohengrin with my eyes closed.  Here one can switch off the TV.",1475452800,3,674,4.439024390243903
8728741,5,B013TICYYY,"This absolutely mesmerizing recording and video brings together two my favorite artists; Arvo Part and Robert Wilson. The music of Estonian composer Arvo Part is always slowly and tranquilly beautiful and is meditative and even spiritual at all times. Acclaimed stage designer Robert Wilson is known for creating spaces that are breathtaking using the most minimal of tools; shafts of light, minimally representative props and actors whose actions, movements and attire are suggestive of the plot and theme at hand. (He has collaborated quite often with Philip Glass and has done some amazing things with Baroque opera, such as Gluck's ""Alceste"")  In this case, Wilson provides the staging for four works by Arvo Part; the centerpiece of which is the title work, ""Adam's Passsion"", a choral depiction of the Russian poem ""Adam's Lament"" by Silouan. Part's work was written to premiere at the Hagia Irene, the Byzantine church that is located geographically and culturally where the East meets West. Wilson's staging is characteristically minimal but somehow inspirational with a sole nude actor as Adam (this is a 'PG-13' presentation...) and the barest of clouds, lighting and sprigs of newfound greenery. Wilson's stagings for the other Part works here, ""Tabula Rasa"" and ""Miserere"" are equally beautiful as is the simple elegance of Part's music. The forces of the Tallinn Chamber Orchestra and the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir under the direction of Tonu Kaljustye are amazing and inspirational. This is a wholly unusual and rewarding presentation of contemporary music with sacred and religious roots and showcases the vision of Robert Wilson very well.  Highly recommended!",1448582400,7,1686,5.406844106463878
