ethnic cleanser of his day. His hubris got a lot of good men killed on that fateful in the Valley of the Little big Horn and he was killed in an arrow shirt.
This video is one of the better ones on the market. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the subject.",1484697600,,473,4.197802197802198

8416863,4,B0045VW0OY,"I'm a history-""nut""....I'm particularly intrigued by the West, the cowboys, the outlaws, the lawmen and the Indians.....and George Armstrong Custer. The twin pack
provides sort of ties together the beginning and the Bitter and far from Glorious
End of a very controversial figure from the American West. I have Custer's own book
Life on the Plains and have read the excellent biography Son of the Morning Star.
Custer was reckless....egotisitical, and ""lucky"" often cheating death during his
Civil War service. He could not cheat death at the Little Big Horn in which all of his worst qualities hastened his Fall. The biography is a nice introduction to the documentary Betrayal at the Big Horn.
  I enjoyed ""Betrayal"" as much or more then the biography. The documentary examines the fateful Battle of the Little Big Horn and the actions of Custer's
officers Reno and Benteen, both sometimes blamed for contributing to the defeat.
Was Reno a cool headed officer who saved the lives of his men instead of rushing into a fate similar to Custer's? Or did he lose control and command of his men
refusing at a crtical moment to try and reach Custer? The docuumentary I think is a little scant on exploring these possibilities, and that's disappointing. The Best part of the documentary though is the step by step retracing of the battle including the final fight at Custer Hill where General Custer, his brother's and
survivors of the initial battle made their last stand. Seeing th ebattlefield today
amd imagining Custer looking frantically for Reno's men helps fill in the blanks.
  I've read a lot about the battle and I also have enjoyed reading Indian accounts of the battle and its aftermath. The documentary touches on some of that, but also leaves more questions then answers. I would recommend it to anyone interested as I am in the history and the lore of the American West.
