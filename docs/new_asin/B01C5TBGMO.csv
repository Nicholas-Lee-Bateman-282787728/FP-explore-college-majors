8752301,5,B01C5TBGMO,All the technobabble and deus ex machina that a Star Trek fan would want. Don't worry - we can reroute the power because the ship is essentially made out of some kind of 23rd century play-dough. You can't beat it.,1515542400,,213,4.35

8752303,4,B01C5TBGMO,"All the episodes you love from seasons 4-6 of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" are included in this set. There are some bonus features for each season and the menus are nice to look at, borrowing from the LCARS interface used on the show. I have two complaints about this set. First, like the similar box set for seasons 1-3,  there are so many discs (21 in this set) that the holder is not attached to the case, so you have to take the holder out to flip through them. Second, the first set contains seasons 1-3, this set seasons 4-6, so you still have to buy season 7 separately to have the complete series. All in all, this is a nice slim package for these seasons so you can own them all without taking up too much room on your shelf. The case itself is sturdy enough and the art, while simplistic, makes clear that this is an epic series that earned its place in television fame.",1483920000,,884,4.261904761904762
