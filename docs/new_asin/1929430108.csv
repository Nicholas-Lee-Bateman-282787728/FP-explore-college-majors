8317323,4,1929430108,"I recently added more floor aerobics to what was an exclusively step workout regimen. This tape had more complex coreography than I had done before and it took me two times through the workout before I was really getting it. Nonetheless, the workout raises my heart rate and is fun. Great tape!",971308800,3,294,4.673076923076923
