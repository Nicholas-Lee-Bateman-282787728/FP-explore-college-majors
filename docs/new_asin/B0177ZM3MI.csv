7491238,4,B0177ZM3MI,"""The Big Short"" (2015 release; 130 min.) looks at a small group of people who came to realize that the housing bubble building up in the early and mid-2000 was unsustainable, and that the various financial products issued by Wall Street eventually would collapse. As the movie opens, we ge a short introduction on how banking evolved from a boring people's industry back in the 1980s to the hot shot market it would become in the new century. We then get introduced to Dr. Michael Burry (played by Christian Bale), a socially awkward fellow who loves heavy metal music and has an uncanny nose for spotting new trends in the financial markets. We also get to know Mark Baum (played by Steve Carell), an investment manager recovering from his brother's suicide and bent on calling out BS whenever he sees it. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from pretty much the same production team that brought us ""Moneyball"" a few years ago, also based on the book by Michael Lewis, with Brad Pitt's ""Plan B"" production company being the main driver. Pitt, a central player in ""Moneyball"" here plays a smaller role. Second, ""The Big Short"" is directed by Adam McKay, best known for the ""Anchorman"" movies. In fact, there is a certain sense of irony and implausibility that is common to both ""Anchorman"" and ""The Big Short"". Not that ""the Big Short"" is a comedy or funny in any way. On the contrary, ""The Big Short"" is dead-serious in its assault on all things Wall Street, and rightfully so. You will revolt at the shady, and worse, practices that are going on. ""An atomic bomb of stupidity and fraud"" is how Steve Carell's character sums it up. Third, the acting performances are top-notch throughout, none more so (in my book anyway) than Christian Bale's tour de force as the socially awkward Dr. Burry. Ryan Gosling is also noteworthy, but the single biggest surprise is of course the cameo appearance by Selena Gomez, who pops in to explain the latest financial instrument (""synthetic CDO"") in lay-man's terms. Yes, we literally get schooled by various celebrities (also appearing is Margot Robbie, among others) on what all the various financial products that the banks concoct mean in language that we can understand (not that it mattered, I still don't understand them). Lastly, please note that the camera work is quite rough, with endless super close-ups and/or out of focus shorts. It is the only aspect of an otherwise perfect movie that I'd call ""an action movie for the brainiac"". Also, if you wonder whether Led Zeppelin's ""When The Levee Breaks"" (which played prominently in the movie's trailer) is featured in the movie, no worries: it plays over the end titles.

""The Big Short"" just opened in theaters and I couldn't wait to see it. The evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati on Christmas Eve was very well attended, I am happy to report. Given the critical acclaim the movie has been getting, I'm thinking this has all the makings of a solid Christmas season hit that will continue to build as it gathers steam in the upcoming awards season. In a sense, this movie is the perfect antidote to the new ""Star Wars"" movie, proving there is room for both. ""The Big Short"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1451001600,86,3392,4.72804054054054

7491240,5,B0177ZM3MI,"This great, great ensemble piece competently teaches us a history lesson about a complex but very important topic! Director Adam McKay (""The Other Guys"") with the able screen-writing assistance of Charles Randolph, was inspired by Michael Lewis's book, written about real people and real events (the bursting of the housing bubble and the implosion of the big banks).

We have a guy who seems to have Asperger's, two youngsters barely out of college and two fund management teams, each of whom separately take a look at how the moral and the amoral butt heads on Wall Street. This film is funny, satisfying and educational, although...by the time the ""Credit Default Swap"" is in full swing, we share our heroes' collective despair. We can see that much of what goes on is a gigantic game of poker: These guys are basically betting AGAINST the future of the American housing market...and we see them as the GOOD guys!

Here is part of this brilliant ensemble:
  * Brad Pitt (""Fury"") is Ben, the grizzled idealist who has quit the game and isn't interested in going back. He angrily paints the most moving picture of what will happen to the average American worker if his young duo has read those financial data correctly.
  * John Magaro (""Unbroken"") Charlie still lives at home, but at least he graduated from college. He and Jamie think they are onto something gigantic! (The Wall Street Journal disagrees; wait until you hear why.)
  * Finn Wittrock (""Unbroken"") Jamie and his sidekick manage an investment fund, so they try to get a foot in the door on Wall Street. Problem is, their track record and their millions are NOT impressive to the giants on the Street.
  * Christian Bale (""American Hustle"") Michael Burry won't back down. Our brilliant, barefooted nonconformist has seen the light and it tells him the housing bubble is going to burst. This Cassandra at least manages his own fund and can write his own rules.
  * Ryan Gosling (""Gangster Squad"") Jared can see what's coming and is trying to cushion his own fall.
  * Steve Carell (""Freeheld"") Mark is still mourning the death of his brother and is astounded by what he sees in the upper echelons of High Finance. Watch his incredulity when he understands that the three rating agencies: S&P, Moody's and Fitch, are complicit in the catastrophe. He speaks for all of us when he takes on the CFO of Morgan-Stanley! (In my opinion, this is Carell's movie!)

It's a shame to leave out other names and characters, but suffice it to say, many more fine actors deserve special mention, but space does not allow....

Some of the photography and editing is too herky-jerky for my taste but I don't care. They bring to dramatic life the same scenario that made us cringe in the award-winning 2010 documentary ""Inside Job."" In this new dramatized version, our screening audience laughed as the characters occasionally dropped the fourth wall and made ironic comments directly to us in the screening audience. Look for unusual cameos, plus the usual strip clubs and a barrage of F-bombs (it IS Wall Street!), but the lessons are well taught; now if only some of those bankers would go to jail! By the way, they have started the same scheme again, only under a new name. ""If it walks like a duck...""",1450742400,25,3251,4.768270944741533
7491241,4,B0177ZM3MI,"Adam McKay may be best known for making millions laugh as director of Anchorman, Talladega Nights, and other comedies, but he'd prefer to get you righteously outraged. His buddy cop comedy The Other Guys saw McKay introduce a new, angrier side as he ripped white collar criminals and exposed their crimes in a scathing credits sequence. That was just the tip of the iceberg, and while it felt a little out of place then it certainly doesn't in The Big Short, undoubtedly the most entertaining movie about the boring world of banking you're likely to ever see.

Based on the book by Michael Lewis, whose Moneyball managed to make baseball stats interesting, The Big Short educates, thrills, and angers. You may even find yourself laughing every now and then...when you're not clenching teeth at the Hell unscrupulous Wall Street bankers unleashed on the American people. What's fascinating is that McKay's film is, for the most part, about the very people who exploited the crashing housing market for their own personal gain. It's about the people we should be rooting for to fail, and yet their actions are only a small part of the problem. It's the system that we hate, not the individuals taking advantage of it.

To help accomplish this, McKay creates a surreal, fast-paced world with big, bold and weird characters, including one, Ryan Gosling's morally dubious Wall Street trader Jared Vennett, who speaks directly to us Wolf of Wall Street-style. Think of The Big Short as a close relative of Scorsese's film of white collar excess, and a sortof prequel to Rahmin Bahrani's 99 Homes which shows the crisis from the perspective of those getting screwed. Christian Bale, sporting a glass eye and a lisp only Mike Tyson could love, is Michael Burry, the antisocial hedge fund manager who figured out long before the 2008 financial crash that banks were flooding the market with dangerous subprime mortgages. He used that information to bet in his own favor, basically betting on the market to fail when nobody could predict that ever happening.  This was unheard of. To put it simply, Burry was hoping to cash in on an event that would devastate the lives of millions. Sounds awful, right? Do we hate Burry for it? Not really. There are other characters that respond to Burry's actions in different ways; Finn Wittrock and John Magaro play ""garage band"" traders looking to cash-in with the big boys, so they turn to an ex-Wall Street insider (a shaggy Brad Pitt) to help them do it. The heart, soul, and voice of outrage belongs to Steve Carell as Mark Baum, who has long believed in the system's corruption and gets all the proof he needs from Vennett in a visual display using Jenga. Sold!

It's Vennett and Baum who serve as our guides through a world of bragging bankers putting the screws to the middle class. Vennett makes all of the financial jargon palatable by introducing celebrity cameos to serve as welcome distractions to the hard and ugly truths being told. On the flip side, Baum is someone who has been personally and tragically affected by the topsy-turvy market. Although Baum is hardly one of the 99% he's someone we can identify with because he has skin in the game that isn't just about money.

Does The Big Short signal the end of McKay as a comedic filmmaker? Probably not, and to be fair his first dramatic effort sports a few awkward spots tonally as he tries to suppress his comic urges. But eventually McKay gets his legs under him, summons up that fiery indignation, and makes an impassioned plea for the rest of us to wake up to the reality of what happened.  The Big Short is McKay's desperate attempt to make sure something like this never occurs again; now let's just hope enough people pay attention.",1450656000,32,3737,4.777089783281734

Everyone who I turn on to this movie states that this is a very well done movie. Artistically, timing, information, characters, writing....content. Everything. I bought my home during the peak of the housing market from Countrywide, no less, on a bait-and-switch loan. Long story short, I managed to hold onto that home and get crappy loan over to a 3.5% interest with an adjusted lower price.

7491305,4,B0177ZM3MI,"Very informative movie showing the banks' roles in the mortgage crisis. I was working at a major US bank prior to the collapse and I saw an insider's view. What the movie left out, unfortunately, was two US Presidents' and Congress' role in legislating this crisis into being in the first place. The movie simply skims over that part with a wave of its hand, saying ""something happened and then suddenly ..."" That mysterious 'something' was corrupt legislation threatening the banks if they refused to participate in the mortgage scam, and promising criminal prosecution of bank CEOs and long prison terms on bogus charges as punishment for bucking against Washington's edicts. US banks are highly regulated to the point that almost everything they do and how they do it is determined by the federal government. This is why idiots and incompetents, as depicted in this movie, can be high level executives at major banks and no one seems to notice.  And when a scam as big as this occurs, Washington DC is always behind it. Nevertheless, the movie was pretty good and showed a fairly accurate view of the kind of thinking going on at the top levels of many major financial institutions who took the government's orders, blindly obeyed, and didn't bother to question them as long as the money was good and the risks could be sold off to someone else.",1525219200,,1348,4.785407725321888

7491350,5,B0177ZM3MI,"Three parallel stories about maverick financiers illuminate the 2008 financial meltdown that was made possible by sloppy and dishonest practices in the mortgage industry.

This is a witty and terrifying film whose most sobering lesson is that this could easily happen again.  It presents a world in which our economic well-being is largely in the hands of type A douchebags motivated by a toxic blend of greed and testosterone.  Speaking as someone who bought a house at exactly the wrong time and watched its value go underwater, this movie held a special interest for me.  It makes good use of famous faces, as there are numerous characters to keep straight.  Christian Bale is the hedge fund manager who sees the weakness in a housing market based on risky loans and develops a way to profit from it.  Ryan Gosling is the bank salesman who understands this analysis and cashes in on it.  Steve Carell is one of the most sympathetic characters, a hedge fund manager whose disillusionment with the system is exacerbated by this debacle.  Also sympathetic are young investors played by John Magaro and Finn Wittrock, who luck into an opportunity to score big.  Director Adam McKay and co screenwriter Charles Randolph turn material that could have been dry and confusing into an entertaining, illuminating movie.",1514937600,,1312,5.009216589861751

If financial jargons are difficult for you, watch this, rewatch this slowly, pause at various scenes, but take home the message that little people can lose big and lose very easily if you trust big corporations/banks/governments. Do not be trusting, do not be gullible. Whatever you choose to invest in, do your research, and really know what you are doing. I think it is still relevant today, or perhaps even more so: markets and economies can crash easily. Nothing is ""stable"" or trustworthy anymore.

It's really an eye opener as to the greed of the wealthy in this country, and how they scammed the poor, and gained even more wealth in the process!

And those responsible were really never held accountable for what they did. Millions of people lost everything they had, and it all went into the pockets of those wealthiest 1% in this country.

7491364,1,B0177ZM3MI,"Bale is annoying with his speech slur and overacting, as are the other ""caricature"" actors. This script has an anti-business slant, which is a major problem, since the villains in the this case were the federal government for causing the disaster. The law required banks to lend to those who could not repay their loans, in effect, poor credit risks, called subprime borrowers. The banks had no choice. The federal government sugared the pill by buying most of the junk bond mortgages, though. FNMA bought the mortgages, so the banks had no incentive to be careful since they would not have to rely on the borrower making payments. The government basically socialized the real estate market, making the taxpayer eat the losses while letting the banks make the profits. This was a government-made disaster and this movie tries to distract from that truth. It tries to go down the food chain and make a villain out of the banks and those selling the houses. That is their bias that weakens the script. Business eats its own losses or goes bankrupt. It is policed by the customers. Government is a monopoly reckless with taxpayer money. We had to bail FNMA out with $188 billion in taxpayer money. Then the ones who created the crisis, Dodd-Frank, were given the power to fix it, so they scapegoated the banks to cover their own role, and did not fix the real problem. Government had no business in the real estate market to begin with, except as a referee. It still doesn't. Whatever government controls, it destroys  be it Greece or Detroit or Venezuela or Puerto Rico. That's the lesson to learn, I think.",1511222400,7,1605,4.752688172043011

VERY CLEVER film. Love how they explain complicated
institutional bond products with famous and sometimes unsophicated
investment movie/hollywood type stars!!!
As an investment advisor, & generally a well documented event as is the
2008-09 economic collapse. Movie still provided new information for me. Really enjoyed.
For the life of me though. I cannot figure out if was true or just part of a movie story,
why they would go to Florida to review home sales, mortgage brokers, etc as part of
their due diligence? Was huge seller of homes in USA is my best guess.
Why not NYC or California?
Amazing event, as to USA equity markets, USA muni bonds, or similar on retail level.
Had you held your holdings, 99.9% of your investments rebounded from down -50% to near even by 2014,
and most retail investments +100% by 2017. If you even slightly averaged in to
those same positions in mid 2010, you are up over 150% in 7 years!!!!! (Equity side)...
If you liked it at $100 (quality product/investment). You gotta love it here at $50!!!! I say it every day to clients.
WATCH MARGIN CALL, or look up ""Margin Call Fat Cats Starving Dogs"" scene on youtube....
Puts it all into perspective and presents the world as it is.....Been happening since dawn of man/fire I say :---).
Gotta maintain sense of personal effort, your own thinking, don't dwell all day on the negatives.
Roll with the punches. And SUCCEED!!!

7491405,3,B0177ZM3MI,"To be perfectly frank, this movie told me little I didn't already know.

Other than that, it was basically a soap opera full of worn-out, stereotypical depictions of Wall Street personalities.

I know the stereotypes are entertaining, but it is important to keep in mind that millions of people work in Finance. Not all of them are scumbags.

Missing Information:
As far as I know right now, the story left out crucial information:

1) While the movie stated that only one banker went to jail, 35 bankers have been sentenced to prison, according to a report that the Office of the Special Inspector General for The Troubled Asset Relief Program presented to Congress.

If you want to confirm this, it is easy enough to find the report presented to Congress through Google.

2) The movie mentioned the bailouts that banks received. It is important to keep in mind that the government got back all the money it lent out to banks and also made a profit. This is also the kind of information that you can find on Google.

Based on this information, I feel as if The Big Short both concealed material information. I wouldn't bring this up, but more than one person has mentioned the movie to me, stating that it was based on a true story.

This movie is all about corruption and fraud in Wall Street, and yet it still leaves out material information.

Under current Securities Law, it is illegal to conceal material information when trying to sell securities to investors.

If an organization sold a security and concealed material information while doing so, and then the investors suffered a loss as a result, the company, as well as its directors and officers, could easily be liable for a securities class action lawsuit brought forth by the investors.

Fortunately for the film industry, it doesn't have regulations like that.

Summary:
This movie did have entertainment value. However, I should also emphasize that as someone who works in Finance, having someone explain every single financial instrument is almost insulting.

I suppose that one way of describing The Big Short is that it is entertaining and great for the masses. However, for those familiar with the Financial Crisis and its causes, the movie might be painful and annoying.

If you are a person looking to learn more about the Financial Crisis, this might be a good source of information. However, simply doing the research through reading might be better.

While taking that approach may be less entertaining, it might be far more informative.",1499472000,,2513,4.866197183098592

Keep in mind that Wall Street is global in scope, it is much bigger than just New York.

Keep in mind one critical thing; the 2008 Financial Collapse was NOT an accident, it was orchestrated.  It was the greatest criminal conspiracy in the history of humanity and the scariest part is that all indicators point to a repeat with-in a few years which will be much worse than the one in 2008.

The answer is ""not very easily,"" but the film makers of the The Big Short have done so resoundingly well.  :-)

First, the film makers have assembled a stellar cast.  I cannot fault the performance of any of the actors.  Steve Carrel is intense and believable as the intense and skeptical investor Mark Baum; Christian Bale is pitch perfect as Michael Burry--the brilliant yet unhinged and socially-awkward professor managing a hedge fund; and Ryan Gosling is in-your-face arrogant and unpleasant as Jared Vennett--which is perfectly appropriate since Vennett is an opportunistic trader, soliciting others to cash in on the fall of the housing market.

Over the course of 2 hours, the film makers take us through a 'plot,' whereby the main characters slowly discover the big lie of the economy:  that Americans had been buying billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities that had been rated 'AAA' by bond agencies, and yet were actually worth nothing.

The journey to the inevitable conclusion, frankly, crackles with excitement, because the film makers use several creative devices.  One device is to have 'real world' celebrities--such as celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain--pop up and explain complex issues such as the definition of 'Collateralized Debt Obligations.'  (Bourdain does so while using stale seafood thrown into a cooking pot as a teaching tool!).  Selena Gomez chatting at a blackjack table was also funny, and useful, as she explained the concept of 'Synthetic CDO's.'  The film makers also use a voice-over--provided by Ryan Gosling's character--and break the 'fourth wall' by having characters look directly at the camera, and talk to us, the audience.

Aside from these clever devices however, the biggest tool the movie uses is a crackling, funny, dramatic script.  One example would be Steve Carell's Mark Baum and his partner, peppering a bond rater (Melissa Leo) with questions, trying to understand why she kept rating the worthless securities so highly.  They break her good-natured-beaurocrat demeanor down so ruthlessly that she's forced to fling off her huge, protective eye-glasses, and admit to her agencies' hypocrisy.  The look of deadpan astonishment on Carrel's face, when she finally admits her hypocrisy, is priceless.

A strong plot, crackling direction that made the movie move crisply along, and a funny script.  All of these make The Big Short a big hit, and a top recommendation.  :-)",1490832000,6,2686,5.26056338028169

Nobody seems to be able to explain complex ideas about Wall Street as well as he does and the movie adaptation does a fantastic job explaining how various bond instruments work and how people ended up buying junk which was rated AAA.

As someone who has worked on Wall Street (and Broad and Midtown and Boca Raton ) I have a good foundation of what happened and even I found myself learning something and having complex things explained in such a way as an aha moment clicked in.

Now I don't want to make this sound like a dreary documentary. This is more The Wolf of Wall Street than a Ken Burns documentary. The film follows some of the people who realizing that there was a housing bubble and deciding to try to short the market. The Big Short emphasizes that even if they were right (and they were) they still could lose everything by getting the timing wrong or simply by having the investment banks refuse to price the instruments accurately. This brilliantly creates a true tension where the film could have simply been a disaster film with the audience screaming at the screen don't invest in that house.

The Big Short sometimes is too on the nose for its own good. (=As an example having the spokeslady for the rating agencies wearing giant glaucoma glasses is a sledgehammer where none was needed. But the film quickly redeems itself with some wonderful fourth wall breaking where one of our heroes explains they did not find the answer in a pile of discarded prospectuses in an investment bank waiting room but actually by doing research but that we need a Raiders of the Lost Ark type discovery because movie.

A great film that entertains first. I cannot recommend enough. Also, I learned never order the fish stew on Sunday.",1488931200,,1899,4.576470588235294
7491473,4,B0177ZM3MI,"It's hard to believe that a movie about arcane financial instruments like credit default swaps could be so gripping, but ""The Big Short"" is a white-knuckle ride.  Much of this is due to the device of having a well-known celebrity explain these instruments in simple terms, like Anthony Bourdain describing the repackaging of bad mortgages into a new product as throwing a bunch of old, leftover fish parts together to make a ""new"" stew.  The film maintains interest through the activities of the odd characters who inhabit the rarefied world of high-level finance as the plot progresses inexorably to the outcome that anyone who was alive in 2008 is well aware of.  Occasionally, a human side is revealed, such as when a financier chastises two managers for their glee over profiting from what will surely lead to the deaths of many innocent people, or when we learn that an investor who is reluctant to sell off and make a huge profit isn't hesitating because he wants a better deal, but because he doesn't want to participate in the legal theft of wealth from the poor and middle class.

Well-paced and humorous - at one point, when an investor in an English pub is audibly discussing multi-billion dollar deals, another patron asks if he's a drug dealer or a stockbroker, because if he's a stockbroker, he can f off - ""The Big Short"" is an engaging if depressing summary of what led to the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.",1488672000,,1444,4.764

7491489,5,B0177ZM3MI,(4.5 stars) I'm not sure I fully understood the banking and mortgage issues represented in the movie but it seemed obvious that some underhanded bank dealings were going on and that regulations were quite lax (are they still this way?  I don't know).  I thought it was a very good movie.  Comrade Trump is into deregulation to stimulate the economy.  A brilliant (note: sarcasm) but shortsighted plan.  But people generally have a short memory span.  That's one of the reasons why history repeats itself.

It was an important reminder that those in power, whether the government or the financial system, can be totally blinded by their agenda and in the end, are not near as much in control as they think that they are. Our whole financial system is built on confidence, and once that confidence is shaken because of poor financial decisions, the results can be huge. Given that we don't seem to have truly learned that lesson and given that we as a nation continue to let debt run out of control on so many fronts - national deficit, student loans, underfunded pension plans, underfunded medicare/medicade/FICA, etc. it is probably only a matter of time until a similar situation as described in this movie happens again in another context. As the saying goes, ""It is impossible to ultimately outrun math"" and ""If something cannot continue indefinitely, it will not continue indefinitely."" But instead we as a culture will be more interested in sports and celebrities like Kim K. so it will blindside us again. So it goes...",1485820800,3,1131,4.775510204081633

I also completely empathized with the angry and bewildered characters and the real people they were based on. I was no longer in the industry, and unlike the main characters, unable to see, in time, the trend against which they purchased shorts protecting, insulating their investors, their families and themselves from the crisis they predicted. In fact, I'm not sure I can watch this again while still attempting to recover from problems caused by the resulting job loss. The movie was well written with the issues as simplified and condensed as possible while retaining accuracy. This really happened. People are still suffering as a result, and the bastards who made millions gambling our financial security until they lost, got away with it, yet again. The biggest bank robbers really do run the banks.",1484179200,5,984,5.118012422360248

Finance majors/investors/traders will enjoy it most,as even the terminology of some the the discussed ""SECURITIES""products in this film had to be defined for the viewer. Based on Flash boys author Lewis's book,it offers keen insight as to what best can be described as the GUNSLINGER mentality on Wall Street. They WILL ABSOLUTELY ""create"" products most buyers do not seem to even want to understand, just to keep the fees and dollars rolling in.
These Wall Street a-holes need MAJOR ETHICS AND MORALITY in business education. Dodd-Frank doesn't even go far enough in my humble opinion. Think not?......Let's just see...just recently
wells Fargo's CEO and product VP responsible for the reprehensible behavior at that bank were pressured out, BUT NOT UNTIL THEY BOTH CASHED IN THEIR $145 AND $125 MILLION GOLDEN PARACHUTES,REPSECTIVELY.Only the Fired 5 or 6 THOUSAND  ""EMPLOYEES"" PAID ANY REAL PRICE, THAT WEREN'T EVEN OF THEIR DOING.

Unfortunately, it totally ignored the role of the US Government under Bill Clinton and Janet Reno in presuring banks to give loans to people who had no history of being qualified to receive them (the subprime debacle), or possibly more imporant, Clinton's dangerous and unwise signing of the GLASS-STEAGAL ACT out of existence.
[The Glass-Steagal Act, also known as the Banking Act of 1933 (48 Stat. 162), was passed by Congress in 1933 and prohibits commercial banks from engaging in the investment business.

7491725,4,B0177ZM3MI,"The Big Short

I watched The Big Short.  Honestly, I should have seen it coming.  I was on the CDO desk and watched a purportedly $2b fund lose approximately $90m a month.  It is interesting that they brought up Salomon Brothers.  One of their employees was the person that created investment banking as it is today.  He and his crew (company name Long Term Capital) made a huge investment in the Russian Ruble before the Russians devalued the Ruble.  I believe it was actually Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers who bought them out.  Guess what?  Long Term Capital Management was right about the investments, they were just too cash thin to handle the margin calls.  Ive dealt with under-capitalized companies my entire career.  Thin capitalization is always a concern, especially with debt pushdowns (meaning third party loans that are extended in an acquisition for the purpose on obtaining tax deductions).  Tax law indicates that only a certain amount of deductions will be available to the buyer.  From an IRS perspective, it would be ill advised to allow corporations to take deductions above a certain level, and indeed they do under IRC 163(j) and the ultra-affiliate rules.

Main character: Ive been looking at these mortgage backed bonds and if more than 50% fail, they all go under.  Residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) have tranches, as well.  RMBSs have tranches like CDOs.  They are correct that RMBSs were junk bonds described as AAA investments.  I don't agree with the characterization of the problem being banks and greed.  Surely there was some of that, but this is a multifaceted problem.  Its very easy to point to banks, but, in my opinion the government has much more to explain.  I think the movie loosely gives an undertone to this point.

With regard to the blocks, he is correct.  You take BBB rated investments and assume they fail.  It collapses the whole investment.  Under CDO agreements, tranche A gets everything, including principal payments.  So, when BBB rated investments go under, so too does the fund.  AAA rated funds are based on the foundational principal that the underlying assets are accurately measured by credit rating agencies (CRA), but they were not.  Also, the government required the use of CRAs for investments and other purposes.  How is it that Arthur Andersen was destroyed, even after posthumously being cleared of any nefarious involvement in Enron?  The government destroyed an accounting firm.  So, when I take a cynical view of bureaucrats (people who don't understand the issues they are dealing with), it leaves me jaded and annoyed.  Just because you have some measure of power does not mean you understand the economy or the investments you presume to be regulating.
As I alluded to there was a lack of due diligence among RMBS and CDO managers. As long as the market held up, theyd be ok.  The housing market, however, did not hold up.  So, they ended up with a pool of worthless RMBSs and the funds failed.  That is what they were trying to convey in a cinematic way.

They also speak about credit default swaps.  Ive explained the logistics of basic swaps in a prior email.  Credit default swaps are to protect against defaults.  This is what brought AIG to its knees.

CDOs are spoken about continuously, which is one of my specialties.  I think they provide a good explanation of how they work; through diversification, a fund could achieve a AAA rating.  Like the blocks, however, when the blocks start sliding, everything crumbles.  What you must remember with CDOs is that they are based on the premise of full repayment of mortgages.  When that doesnt happen, we have 2008.

Standars & Poors, could not answer simple questions in the movie, and that is the exact experience I had with them. As Ive explained before, credit rating agencies were working for companies and were exercising professional bias.  I understand why people do it, but it makes no sense to me; Happiness should not be derived from material goods, it should come from family and friends.

When the two brothers are talking about AAA rated tranches actually being more like BBB rated tranches, they were correct.  To be more accurate, Id say those tranches were CCC.  I have a Powerpoint file and excel spreadsheets to show this.  So, shorting those investments means you sell the investment with borrowed funds (or as they say, on margin).  The idea is that youve locked in your potential gain and are betting that the value of the investment decreases.  So, when you repay with the securities, you have a real gain.  Now, there are tax implications regarding timing and the treatment of such gains, but I won't bore you with the details.  You have to understand that shorting a tranche that presumably is AAA rated, would seem nuts prior to 2008.  It was a brilliant maneuver.

In his meeting with the Asian CDO manager, they are describing a concept that I have written about in my piece on the 2008 crash.  CDOs invested in other CDOs.  They also created CDOs that invested in credit default swaps, which are synthetic CDOs.  I didn't like how they explained synthetic CDOs in the movie.  I think a short cameo from one of the actors would have sufficed.

There is also an underlying theme that I alluded to before, the ignorance and consistent belief that residential real estate prices always go up.  Franklin Raines in 2005 during Congressional hearings sought for cover under that exact argument.  He was the CEO of Fannie May.  Of course the Congressional black caucus, including Maxine Waters and people like Barney Frank called it a lynching.  Barney Frank in conjunction with Dodd created one of the most onerous and destructive bills, the Dodd/Frank act.  Barney said that housing goals were paramount and that everyone in society should own a house.  I think it was in 2009 that he then said that not every person should own a house.  Hypocrisy be thy name.

In the movie, they reference the Bear Stearns buy-out.  Bear Stearns had to be bought out by JP Morgan.  Lehman Brothers was not so lucky.  I postulated in a paper on banking regulations in law school that Lehman was a litmus test for bail outs.  The government and other banks let Lehman fail.  Ive done cleanup work on a Lehman subsidiary that included three partners, a manager, a senior associate, and two associates.  We wrote a series of five should level opinions.  In tax, a should level opinion can protects a client from interest and penalties.  So, we don't take those opinions lightly.  A should level opinion means there is over a 75-85% chance that were right.  The taxpayer can depend on these opinions from a legal and administrative perspective.

Finally, I assume the Cuban place the brothers are referring to is Sophias.  It has great food; its on Fulton Street in the financial district.  Theres also one in Midtown and the upper east side.

7491741,4,B0177ZM3MI,"The Big Short, 2015 film

In the late 1970's banking was a snooze until a man changed banking investments with mortgage bonds (bundled mortgages). It all came crashing down in 2008 and created a world-wide depression. Some foresaw this by looking at the facts. A man is hired to investigate the top twenty mortgage bonds. There is a meeting. One investor says mortgage-backed bonds are very risky; when interest rates go up there will be defaults that caused the fund to go bankrupt. These AAA rated bonds were really risky. Mark talks to his wife then takes a cab. He wants to buy a credit-default swap to profit when the mortgage bonds fail. But he wants a guarantee the bank will pay off. He will buy $100 million worth! He visits other banks to make similar deals; a total of $1.3 billion! But his company balks at this. Another man wants to short mortgage bonds.

Modern mortgage bonds are made up of layers of tranches (varying grades from AAA-AA-A-BBB-BB-B ratings). When the default rate goes up the bonds lose value. A credit-default swap can generate ten or twenty to one returns. A bank takes low-rated bonds and puts them into a CDO (collateralized debt obligation). The banks don't pay attention to what they're selling. Those banks are greedy in their loans (credit cards, student loans, etc.), An ISDA Agreement lets an investor make high level trades. They visit a housing development in Miami and learn the facts. Mortgage frauds are up, wages are level. The second quarter of 2007 will see interest rates rise (and increase mortgage costs). One man asks for his money back. They visit housing and learn about Adjustable-Rate Mortgages. Houses are sold without verifying the income of the buyers. Mark talks to the owner of five houses and a condo. He decides to buy more credit-default swaps. They call Ben Rickert to get his help in getting an ISDA; he agrees.

The news tells of rising mortgage delinquencies. But ratings are up! Standard & Poors give AAA ratings to those bond funds, they are sold for fees. Self-interest, they lose nothing this way. Are the banks involved in a fraud? There is a meeting in Las Vegas for the American Securitization Forum. Will sub-prime losses stop? They go to a shooting gallery; its on their expense account. The FTC doesnt investigate, their budget was cut! The bonds aren't going down, its a fraudulent system. Or are they mistaken? They bet against the American economy. When unemployment goes up by 1% then 40,000 Americans die! There are synthetic CDOs made up from CDOs. They are explained like a side bet. Michael restricts withdrawals from the fund. In March 2007 the meltdown begins. Bear Stearns Liquidates Hedge Funds After Massive Subprime Mortgage Losses says a news report [they went bankrupt]. Bad bonds are being unloaded on unsuspecting customers.

Will the media print this? Its happening. How bad is this? Should they sell now? No. Jared has a check for $47 million. There is a meeting, Mark Baum speaks about what happened. An era of fraud caused the problems. Average people will pay for this. The stock of Bear Stearns dropped 38%! Next Countrywide Mortgage, Lehman Brothers! Employees leave with their personal effects. Do not talk to the press! People lost jobs and homes. Michael J. Burry closed down his fund. It had a 48% return. There will be a bailout of banks too big to fail. The banks took the money, paid themselves well, and blamed the problems on immigrants and poor people. After the collapse five trillion dollars in pension money, real estate value, 401K plans, savings, and bonds disappeared. Eight million people lost their jobs, six million people lost their homes - just in the USA. Could the ratings agencies be sued? No. The government was not interested in the cause of the collapse. In 2015 large banks began selling billions in renamed CDOs.

This was the greatest fraud in US history. The Corporate Media censored or minimized the story. What will they do next? This is a very good drama with an educational lesson. But the story and direction make it hard to follow. If you don't read the business pages or know about this historic fraud it will seem like a jigsaw puzzle. The Great Depression of the 1920s-1930s was caused by swindling people by selling worthless bonds. The New Deal passed the Glass-Steagal Act to control investment banking. In 2000 a corrupt US Supreme Court intervened in the election to choose George W. Bush as President. A Republican Congress abolished the Glass-Steagal Act. Then Wall Street began a series of swindles by using mortgages that were bought and bundled into securities. The moral hazard was in giving them AAA ratings when they were composed of risky mortgages. In the USA five trillion dollars in pension money, real estate value, 401K, savings, and bonds disappeared in this Big Swindle. Eight million people lost jobs, and six million people lost homes.

The passage of NAFTA shipped good-paying jobs overseas, people sought better returns on their money. The past decades made most people trust Wall Street, few understood the risks of Collateralized Mortgage Obligations. Most people spent too much time on entertainment, show business, etc. These distractions have their costs, but culture is involved with dumbing down people the better to fool them. The meltdown in value, or swindle, was made worse by the increase in unemployment and loss of jobs. This affected taxes and funds for Social Security and Medicare. Can America elect a President and Congress who are not flunkies of Wall Street? I hope so. Ravi Batra wrote Greenspans Fraud to expose the policies that led to the Bush Depression.",1479168000,,5649,4.897596656217346

""What's a derivative?"". I think I saw maybe 10 minutes of the whole movie. And therein lies the flaw with this movie. Unless you are a Wall Street Broker, you will probably get lost rather quickly. It's difficult to stay interested in things you don't understand. The producer's assumption that the average movie goer would grasp the incomprehensible, intricate machinations of what actually happened in 2008 is inexcusable. But how else to tell the story? The acting was great, the suspense was satisfying and the end was really unsettling in a gratifying if horribly sad way. Despite the informative nature of the content, I don't feel like I really learned anything about the biggest global finanical meltdown in recent history. I'm still hopelessly confused - possibly even more so. I gave it 3 stars for that single reason. To be fair, it must have been an enormous challenge for the director and the production team to tell this story simply because of it's complexity. However, I don't think any producer/director could have done a better job. Watch it and then spend a few hours scratching your head in bewilderment.",1476230400,,1294,4.833333333333333

The film focuses on a small group of fund managers who 'shorted' against the subprime mortgage industry (i.e. bet against) and thus became very wealthy.  This film will definitely make you cynical, as other viewers have noted.  It's a dark comedy, but the subject matter hits home for many of us who came of age during the market crash.

Because it *always* takes all three to create a total disaster - greedy lenders, greedy buyers, and clueless politicians - and we have no shortage of any of them.

That said, the person I liked least in the movie was Steve Eisman, an annoying self-righteous Limousine Liberal who cost his clients lots of money because his precious feelings were more important than his fiduciary duties to them. Not sure if this was an accurate depiction of him, but the uber-rich who 'feel our pain' while making tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars on their deals are worse than any honest capitalist.

Its a story by Michael Lewis (Moneyball) which explains the financial meltdown of 2008 in spectacular fashion.  Christian Bale (God he is SO good!!) is Dr. Michael Burrows who figures out that the housing market is about to crash...so he goes to finance companies like Bear Sterns, Goldman--all the big banks and wants to short the housing market.  everyone says the same thing---Everyone pays their mortgage!  Why would you think it would go bad?  Well with sub-prime mortgages it went VERY bad--global recession.

Well told, great actors, great characters--you will HATE what Wall Street did to us and walked away with tens of millions of dollars in bonuses while most of us lost everything.

At the end the narrator Gosling said how all these people went to prison, the SEC and congress implemented new rules etc...then laughed--laughed! and said--Only one small trader went to jail and the country blamed the poor, immigrants...and teachers.

The breaking of the fourth wall and the celebrity cameos keep this moderately light-hearted but, as Brad admonishes the Boulder Boys, ""just don't ...... dance"" as the story is about people losing their homes, jobs and in some cases their lives.

All the headline players do a great job but Messrs Carell and Bale stand out.  The Boulder Boys and Carell's team are good value too.  There are any number of good set-piece scenes that are scripted well and would be somewhat funny if they didn't deal with such serious topics, such as the group therapy moment and the Vegas dinner with the CDO manager (who, I read, tried to sue the author and various others, but failed).

The fact that the independent rating companies are just paid for fiscal prostitution, the fact that we repeatedly run into the same issue with this largely unregulated industry where decent people suffer and foot the bill over and over should be proof of a fact that you should never allow any industry to regulate itself.

Give the government agencies some balls, a mandate to SERVE the people and uncouple these financial alums from out of our public service sector (looking at you Goldman Sachs) and lets take back our economy and stop crying that we're so helpless.  The movie is inspirational, sad, will make you feel outraged (should) and do it in a way that you can admire the acting, candor and the artistry in making it so palatable.

However, we had to jump through tons of hoops and dig up all sorts of paperwork to get a mortgage on a house that was well below our ""pre-approved"" amount given by the lending company.  Several friends recommended we watch this movie so we could understand why the process was so difficult and invasive.  It helped us to make sense of the situation.
  The movie itself was good.  It was a bit choppy and fast paced, but there are these little asides with different celebrities that help to explain the different terms and concepts.  The actors were all excellent.  This was not something we would choose to watch for fun necessarily, but it was very educational.

7492187,5,B0177ZM3MI,"One of the best movies I have seen so far.  Film is based on a true story and it is based on a book.  It is a story about small group of people, who make their living as wealth managers at small independent firms.  Independently of each other, they come to a conclusion that mortgage and housing market are reaching a bubble that is about the burst.  They are slowly discovering that it is not just negligence and greed of the big banks that is bringing economy to the verge of collapse, but also a level of corruption that reaches the highest levels of the government branches.  In general, they are all in it together, because no one wants to make waves and everyone wants to make money.

This movie casts an amazing group of actors: Christian Bale, Brad Pitt, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling.  What all of them having common is that they know how to read the numbers and how to spot the trouble.  On a personal level, they are all socially awkward people, emotionally deeply hurt along in their lives that makes them solitary birds that just pay attention to their work and their families.  But they also have a strong moral compass and they base all of their decisions based on the strong code of what is wrong and what is right.

I loved every moment of the film, all the quotes used in a film and the fact that some of the financial terms, foreign to most common people are explained in easy way by celebrities such as Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez and event a famous cooking chef Anthony Bourdain.  It is sincere and heart wrenching movie.  I love the quote mentioned in the movie that says ""Truth is like poetry.  And most ordinary people hate poetry.""  So it is no wonder that ignorance, arrogance, greed and plain negligence brought US and world financial world to its knees in early 2007 after the house bubble bust that crippled economy for a long time to come.

My favorite actor in the movie is Steve Carrell.  He is amazing with the range of characters he can portray and the pain that is so visceral in this movie that feels as if it is jumping out of screen.  Christian Bale is the second best.  He plays a medical doctor who works in a small investment firm, man who prefers solitude and is grateful to have a supporting wife who loves him for what he truly is - an honest man.",1472083200,,2288,4.394299287410926

Then add on to this the doctor playing heavy metal with no shoes drumming on the desk, Gosling's over the top d-bag of a character, Brad Pitt's pointless role, the investor with always with 3 buttons unbuttoned and holding a baseball bat, the music, the obnoxious editing, the naked woman in the bath saying ""now f-off"", the ""simple"" average American helpless victims doing their daily things, I can go on and on.

7492348,3,B0177ZM3MI,Eh!,1470528000,,3,3.0
7492349,5,B0177ZM3MI,"The Big Short,released Nov./15,features an all star cast with the likes of Christian Bale,Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt and many more. This is a tell it like it is,hard boiled looked at the true story of the financial collapse and its causes in 2008. It sounds boring, but it is a well told tale in terms everyone can understand.
The story is told through the perspective of a select few ""players"" in the larger financial game. First up is Bale as one Dr. Burry .He is one of the first to detect a weakness in the housing market in 2005 and he concocts a plan to bet against Government backed mortgages,so when they collapse,not if,he will rake in the profits big time. To do this means playing with his companies gazillions of dollars of investment funds(pension money,etc) and paying out until the collapse comes,then sell to make even more back.
Of course the inside word manages to leak to others who also latch on to the concept and work the corrupt and dysfunctional system to their own advantage. Even the bond rating agencies are all in on the scam, as they rate artificially high,unwilling to upset the status quo. The story proceeds as big money ebbs and flows and the moral implications of all of this eventually hits home when the housing market does collapse in 2008. Carrell is one who all along has been warning all who will listen how morally reprehensible it all is,but when in the end push comes to shove,he too eventually succumbs to the big dollar and sells for a $billion profit.
The fallout of course,as we all know,led to trillions of dollars being lost in an instant(pension money,savings accounts,mortgages going default,etc),thousands upon thousands of jobs lost and almost no one on Wall street being held accountable. Was it an exploitable flaw in the system that the Big Banks didn't know about? To some lower players in the system....yes. But to the higher ups in the big boardrooms,it was something they didn't care about and were more than willing to exploit when some started picking up the ball and running with it. And guess what? Little has changed today,as the same type of sub par mortgages/hedge funds running wild that led to the 2008 crisis,have just been repackaged and renamed and are still going strong!
Christian Bales performance is of OSCAR calibre,as the brilliant but eccentric Dr. Burry. Carrell also gives a top notch performance as trader Mark Baum who is constantly conflicted and aware of the moral implications of the whole ""shorting""(betting against)scenario. Gosling crashes through the fourth wall often,talking to us directly and giving us his take on what is taking place on screen. Another well done acting job. Pitt is,thankfully,not on screen much so his retired and introverted ex-trader character is much more believable. And the cast list goes on and on,all totally believable and on point. The film explains every technical term either on screen or through the explanation of a star or expert in a cameo role.
Technically the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 ,but the DVD has no extras.
All in all a,to me,surprisingly good film about the 2008 wall street collapse and resulting""depression"",which in my opinion is still more or less with us today. It's an insider and true look at the causes and loopholes in the system,those who played the system and the system that didn't care because they knew the public purse would bail them out in the end. It is all shot with a you-are-there camera technique,giving everything an immediacy and greater impact. The financial stage post-2008 has changed very little,with pretty much the same actors in place today. Pathetic. 4 1/2-5 stars. Highly recommended viewing.",1470528000,,3684,4.886581469648562

On the one hand it's a lovely movie and great music.  On the other hand, having been burned by a salesman/banker convincing me we could buy that house, only to find how well he profited from it as did a pair of salesmen in the movie.

Sure the actors were top notch.  Bale did excellent - not a fan of his work, but he was fabulous. Carrell, wasn't he a comedian?, wonderful. Sure Pitt was great as was the rest of the cast.

7492525,4,B0177ZM3MI,"The movie does a great job of simplifying the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and pointing out the wrong-doers. HOWEVER.....I was disappointed at how they completely left out the role the federal government played in creating the environment where this happened. Make no mistake, the government laid the foundation of the system Wall Street bastardized, and the government encouraged their actions through politicized homeownership policies designed to create these types of loans in the first place. Fannie and Freddie GSEs started doing these loans in the mid-90's, and Wall Street took it to another level and then falsified the quality ratings for unsuspecting investors. I think the film does a disservice in leaving out this huge fact out.

The banks were too busy counting their money to realize that they had created a monster.

7492581,5,B0177ZM3MI,"Finally, almost a year after it was first released to theaters, I recently watched the movie The Big Short for the first time. I am I very glad I did.

The Big Short is, of course, the now-famous film from 2015 about the financial crisis of 2008. Its based on Michael Lewis non-fiction book The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine.  Like the book, the movie isn't so much about the financial crisis as it is about what caused the meltdown in the first place.

As our story begins, three small groups of investors, each working independently from each other, see something unusual going on in the financial markets. Nobody else sees it  or wants to, for that matter. For years, many of the worlds biggest investment and commercial banks have been investing heavily in high-risk subprime mortgages. Housing prices are on the rise and demand for housing remains high. But soon, variable interest rates on these mortgages will begin to rise sharply. Massive numbers of people with little or no income will then begin to default on mortgages they can no longer afford...

Our three independent investment groups each decide to sell short the housing markets by investing in credit default swaps  a form of insurance against mortgage defaults. They are essentially betting against the housing markets; if the housing markets fail, the investors stand to make millions

The Big Shorts stars include, among others, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell, and Brad Pitt. Adam McKay, who also co-wrote the screenplay along with Charles Randolph, directed the film. This is an excellent film in every way. Everything about it - the acting, screenplay, cinematography, and production values  ranks it among the best of the films of 2015. I especially like the way The Big Short explains the many complex and difficult issues that led to the crisis.

I now own three movies about the 2008 financial crisis: The Big Short, Too Big to Fail, and Margin Call. All three films are fascinating. They tell a gripping story and are highly entertaining. On the whole, I think Too Big to Fail is the best of the three because it provides a better overall picture of what happened and why. The Big Short focuses on how three relatively unknown groups of investors each got rich by betting against the markets. Margin Call uses fictional characters inside an imaginary investment bank to dramatize the crisis. All three movies do an excellent job of explaining what happened in an easy understandable manner.

Of this trio of films, I think The Big Short is the most entertaining. With its powerful cast, wonderfully witty screenplay, and expert direction, its a film that should not be missed. Very highly recommended.",1468713600,,2701,4.929515418502203

7492594,2,B0177ZM3MI,"This movie is based on fact and does have an important message and some potentially entertaining gimmicks with guest stars and the like, but the filming style is awful. The picture is made for people without attention spans. The jerky, constantly-in-motion camera work is better suited to distract cats than it is to inform and entertain a thinking audience. This could have been a really good film. Instead, it is a shallow, hip-hop version of a quality movie. If you must see it, take some Dramamine and watch it for the facts.",1468627200,2,529,4.760869565217392

7492598,5,B0177ZM3MI,"Christian Bale, Steve Carell, and Ryan Gosling are great. It's hilarious to see the celebrity edification interludes which are well placed and entertaining.  In particular out of the blue Selena Gomez pops on the scene, no singing and she, alongside Richard Thaler, a gentleman who specializes in Behavioural Economics demonstrate a curious explanation of a Synthetic C.D.O., a bit of industry lingo, accompanied by a peppering of audience interjections, snuggled between Gun 'n Roses sweetly cooing (if that's possible) in the background.

It is crazy to think people actually created a system of enticement, bet on setting people up for failure and then made certain to see it through to the very end that the prophecy of failure would come true, even though it was preventable. Preventability = Less Profitability

Detailed accuracy or not, this is an enjoyably provocative movie and is a sobering, slap you right upside the head reminder of ""It ain't what you don't know that get's you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.""",1468627200,,1052,5.069364161849711

Even with the all star cast....the story line itself was not something that left me emotionally involved or sitting on the edge of my seat wanting more.

I think had any other actors been cast the movie would have been insufferable

So cleverly done - the writers managed to devise ways to readily explain what happened to produce the housing crash - explaining credit default swaps and other such instruments in layman's terms with humor, all the while pulling the story along through the excellent characters and their roles in the progression of things.  Steve Carell was the huge surprise for me - I always found him funny and wry but had no idea he could act this well - he was an unforgettable figure who not only held his own with the likes of Christian Bale but in many ways stole the show.  This was for us the best of the several movies depicting this horrid and corrupt period of time in which immense wealth was stolen from the American taxpayers.

An objective analysis would look at 3 areas- the role of politicans, the role of the public and of course the role of Wall street. This movie chooses to blame 100% of the blame on Wall Street while casting no stomes in any other direction. Don;t get me wrong- Wall Street certainly deserves their share of the blame for the collapse. However the role of politicians in this fiasco should at least be MENTIONED and the role of some members of the public who acted dishonestly and irresponsibly should also be a part of any objective story.

7492955,4,B0177ZM3MI,"I'm a big fan of the book, could not believe anyone could make a movie of it, even more incredulous that it would be billed as a comedy. Somehow, though, that's exactly what this is and they do a great job of it. I'm an economics major with good deal of financial knowledge, watched it with my very non-economist wife and she completely understood the hilarious explanations of things like CDO's and tranches.

While the financial crisis certainly made the news, what very few people realize is that money wasn't ""lost""--it was one very well known side of a financial transaction that affected millions of consumers, mutual fund holders, etc. but on the other side of the transaction, the gains balanced out and went to a very few individuals, not the ""big banks"" everyone thinks game the system. The book does a brilliant job of introducing us to a few of those individuals, and how they came to recognize and profit from this when the conventional wisdom and overwhelming public pressures were stacked against them. These were profit-minded individuals and firms, but hardly come across as greedy. What's scary and funny at the same time is when they finally start to see their investments turn into winners, because they were so highly leveraged their biggest fear is that attempting to cash them out would be impossible, basically forcing the other side of the trades into bankruptcy, and in some cases recognizing that the entire financial system, not just a few firms, might not be capable of covering the bets.

Hardly a spoiler alert here unless you slept through the 2008 meltdown, but the ending is great with just a little bite--describes the happily ever after ending we'd all love to see, financial reforms, everyone learning their lesson, etc., then a big ""nah, that's not what really happened"".",1467072000,3,1809,4.8892508143322475

7493070,1,B0177ZM3MI,"I didn't finish, found it unwatchable, as though someone couldn't be bothered designing an actual story. The result was a hodgepodge of scenes that tried to be interesting by focusing on non-story elements: A glass eye (a glass eye does not a story element make in a movie about a financial crisis), a stripper, wood blocks, clips of Americans going about their supposedly superficial daily business. And then there's this: During the housing boom, I looked up the average American salary (About $43k/year). Even in a two-income family, that's not enough to support a mortgage for a home that was 3X what it had been just five years prior. Interest rates were at extremely low rates. So when interest rates went back up and any of these homes went back on the market because of a job move or any other reason, just who did they think would be able to qualify to purchase that home? The Bush administration began talking about 40-year mortgages and somehow equated that to a healthy economy. A few years before the boom, neither my neighbors nor myself could qualify for a $140k mortgage without having 25% down. At the beginning of the boom, when that same home jumped to $190k (eventually landing at $400k) that same bank (Chase) tried to convince me to take out a loan on it with almost nothing down (I didn't bite; instead waited for the crash and bought low). I'm sure this same story could be multiplied by millions. That the whole thing was a scam was obvious. That it would collapse, that it would drain Americans of their salaries thereby causing billions to leave almost every other industry (especially restaurant and retail) because people couldn't PAY for it, was also obvious. There was no ""hidden"" crisis here to uncover. It was there all along, bold and brazen.

7493093,1,B0177ZM3MI,"What isn't surprising about this overt government narrative supporting propaganda is that it bastardizes the truth to promote the big lie. The government, through the community reinvestment act (see Bill Clinton), and eliminating bank regulations (see Bill Clinton and Glass-Steagal), strong-armed the banks to loosen mortgage loan requirements. Their ""big short"" sighted intent was to get more loans into the hands of minorities whom they declared were discriminating against minorities (a big fat lie). So the banks did as told, wrote the loans, and the banks were insured by the Federal Government (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), who, naturally, were in bed with the Democrat party.

When George Bush and sane economists warned them about an imminent collapse the Democrat party went in full ""ATTACK BUSH!"" mode (as if that is remotely surprising). They went to the floor of the Senate, had hearings, and all to cover up what they created...Then when it all came crashing down the Democrat party and their Hollywood friends began the cover up...It was all the banks' fault, and George Bush's fault!...Then the Democrat party pressured the taxpayer to bail out the banks, the media sang in tune, and the dirtiest of them awarded the Democrat party by fully funding the rise of an incompetent, unqualified, lying sack of Chicago ghetto race baiting excrement by the name of Barack Hussein Obama.

The movie makes clear, in clever vignettes, not just the meaning of the terms but the implications of such instruments.  It thoroughly documents and condemns the duplicity of the credit rating agencies and of the culture of greed on Wall Street.  It also becomes clear that, as new fiscal products become available, nobody is really watching.  Frankly, it leaves me wondering what is preventing another debacle.

I will just say that I hope it sparks a sense of outrage in others that it did in me and eventually leads to congressional action. I think the problem is that with a few exceptions, most of the outrageous behavior depicted in the book and movie was not illegal, but should be.",1466553600,,754,4.094594594594595

The Big Short follows the story of a couple of people who had worked out that  the mortgages being rated Triple A and that others were investing in (well the movie explains it better) were basically high risk ones that there was little probability of ever being paid off and would default.  At times it tries to make the explanations more normal viewer friendly with occasional skits like Margot Robbie in a bath or Selena Gomez playing cards to explain things in simple terms.  I would have liked to have seen more of these though as the movie did get a little dull at times.  I would have also liked to have seen the time division of the movie to have been a higher percentage after the predictions of the main characters came true, yet the movie ends shortly after.

7493680,2,B0177ZM3MI,"Virtually all the mainstream commentary on the 2007-2008 Housing collapse has focused exclusively on the role of banks, and this movie is more of the same. Indeed, director Adam McKay is a Bernie Sanders supporter, so its only natural.

and why is that the accepted narrative? Because its intended to hide another narrative. You see, people like McKay talk about how banks preyed on unwitting innocents by leveraging and encouraging their mortgage debt and so opened the gates for mad dog CDO managers, mortgage brokers, financial services and other whores to ruin everything, which is to say the banks were themselves mad dogs too. But who let them off the leash? The SEC? The closest this film gets to the role of government is a single, brief scene where a SEC woman is implied to be in bed with Goldman, literally and figuratively, and she says the SEC can't do anything anyway because their budget was cut. Which is true but the SEC is regulatory, which is to say reactionary; they don't set policy but follow it.

Politicians set policy. For a long time coming, surging in the Clinton presidency and culminating in W's administration, home ownership became a ""human right"". Not a constitutional right like gun ownership with its secular textual overtones, but a *human* right, with all of the recalcitrant religious universal baggage that word ""humanity"" implies. As we have seen with other examples of ""human rights"" in the past 70 years, home ownership seamlessly transmogrified into yet another cause for ""civil rights"", mutual reparations for blacks, hispanics, third-world immigrants of all sorts, and finally poor white people should they be necessary. Go google George W. Bush's speeches about home ownership rights. Check out Steve Sailer's complied material on the subject, its out there.

McKay is loathe to admit this but he actually has to hint at it, but for a different point. As two characters go to inspect the McMansion farms to verify how baseless the market really is, they stumble upon a semi-literate, tattooed hispanic man with mixed race children renting a $500,000 house, who could just as well be Sailer's ""tow truck driver"". Now, McKay is able to incorporate this inconvenient truth because he can just as well turn it into source for emotional pity, which is of course what he does, ""poor immigrants"". Even one of the mortgage broker's peddling the McMansions said he deliberately targets immigrants with NINJA loans, and he is of course portrayed as blonde hair and blue eyed. Thus, the specter of evil white males is conjured.

Old sayings are old because they tend to be true. One that applies here is ""if its too good to be true, then it probably is"". You don't have to be very smart to understand. Are we supposed to believe that the blacks, the illegal and ""legal"" hispanic immigrants, the immigrants generally and ""poor"" people seriously believed they could get away with their $600,000 McMansions for literally nothing, forever, and that such a deal being offered to them, lowly and unemployed as they are, wasn't suspicious in the least? Did people really believe in how much they were refinancing their homes? That wasn't too good to be true? All those people were just that dumb? If so, how wise is it to allow people that dumb into your country? Of course they weren't, humans are rarely dumb when it comes to their immediate, material self-interest. They're not dumb, they're craven, and that applies to all ""humans"", not just ones you want, McKay, which is to say contra Mark Baum, the movie's hero, immigrants and ""poor people"" *are* to blame, as much as the rest.

In one of the movie's moral triangulations, McKay unintentionally exposes his fraud. Its during Mark Baum's sit-down with CDO manager Wing Chau. After Chau basically confesses that the housing market is a fraud, he asks if Baum thinks Chau is a parasite and follows, ""but apparently society values me very much"". The best Baum can do is call Chau a meanie, but Chau is right: who's really the parasite? Who's irresponsible? Who is the fraud, Chau or society? It depends on who is in control, and the sacred taboo of ""diversity"" is what controls us. So, if you ask diversity mongers like McKay, he will tell you banks and 1%, but he won't tell you Barney Frank, Pelosi, the Democratic party, mass immigration, he won't even tell you market-fundamentalism or W. Bush. An unintentional blessing of this movie is that it shows how seamlessly market-fundamentalism and Diversity inc. trade with each other for their mutual bourgeois benefit, which translates into the complete destruction of everything.

So the good things about the film are Gosling, Bale and Byron Mann, all great actors. The aside financial explanations by anomalous celebrities was distastefully condescending. McKay's feckless, semi-religious moralizing as epitomized by Baum is garbage and helps no one and nothing.",1465603200,,4897,4.980440097799511

Most of the boring parts involved characters that were thrown in half way through the movie, or were characters not developed in a way where I cared about them.  Really, the only characters I cared about was Steve Carell's character.  His characters seemed to be the only one that had human like emotions.  Maybe the characters were written in a way that deliberately removed their empathy and their self realization of their actions.

I held off a long time to see this movie.  I have seen many, many documentaries about the events leading up to, including and the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.  Every time I have watched these movies I come away feeling ever more angry, incensed really and disappointed in our government.

I have been a fan of Michael Lewis since he wrote Liar's Poker in 1989. Lewis had been a bond trader for Solomon Brothers.

Although The Big Short happens to be one of the rare mainstream films with political bite I was still disappointed. The Hollywood treatment on a story about finance did not work for me. The characters in the movie were cartoonish and their behavior was over the top. This is a complex story and the film did not really get into the detail of what was going on.

But when the mortgages started defaulting, and the housing bubble burst, they witnessed unusual moves and behavior by Wall Street, which ultimately made them come to the conclusion that ""the system"" was being manipulated and that it was corrupt.

It leaves the clear meaning of what pure greed can do to others who have no means of defense, or are too ignorant and willingly unaware of reality.

It's a great movie, not just because of the great acting and fine directing. This movie excells, because it could be a boring topic made lively through the informative, easy to follow asides and narration.

Everyone should watch this movie more than once. The 1st time to be entertained, and the 2nd time to learn how all Americans are pawns in someone else's game.

7493968,4,B0177ZM3MI,The Big Short is a very entertaining and educational movie. It fictionalizes what led to the 2008 collapse but uses interesting directorial vignette to explain when they made fictional scenarios to get a concept across and to explain complex economic concepts. All acting is great in this but Steve Carell is phenomenal. They turned a very serious and depressing event into an enjoyable theatrical experience. Highly recommended movie.,1464912000,,435,5.411764705882353

If this movie doesn't leave you shaking your head in wonder, disgust, and overall disbelief in our banking system and a few high level government guys, then I suggest you not watch it. In one of my post-movie-musings, I found myself reflecting on the scene with Steve Carell where it appears he's struggling to make a moral decision to sell off his multi-billion dollar portfolio of CDO's as the housing market is crashing and ends up selling at the last minute at a loss wherein his firm ONLY nets a BILLION dollars. Throughout the movie you find yourself rooting for this guy since it appears he always takes the moral high ground. Then it hit me.

They kept it pretty accurate to the real story and who these people were.  It's a funny, very informative, depressing at points (knowing what the government did and does to us) but like I said very funny so it curbs the depressing government we have somewhat. MUST WATCH. No matter who you are or how much you think you know, there's a lot what REALLLLY happened and the people involved that saw it coming and prospered, and the one's that also saw it coming and went at it a different way and got screwed.

IF YOU WERE IN A FIELD THAT DIRECTLY GOT HIT LIKE ME (FINANCE MANAGER/DIRECTOR @ HUGE CAR DEALERSHIP) OR OTHER PPL WHO GOT CRUSHED WITH BAILOUTS AND WHATNOT, THIS IS A MUST SEE!  Enough Said, GO WATCH IT.",1464566400,,817,4.426666666666667
7494141,5,B0177ZM3MI,"Typically, financial crises are the stuff of documentary films.  When I saw first saw the trailer for this film, I expected an overly serious film about a difficult-to-understand financial event.  What surprised me was the humor - and the surprisingly clear and easy-to-understand explanations for terms like subprime mortgages and CDOs.  A lot of the humor comes from random celebrity appearances like (Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez and Anthony Bourdain) who drop in to explain terms like synthetic CDOs.  The humor and spontaneity comes from a filmmaker who has done a brilliant job turning an almost impossible to understand financial topic into something that mainstream audiences can enjoy and kind of understand.  And it's entertaining.  I ended up watching the movie 3 times over the past month.  And now I'm reading the book by Michael Lewis.  Yeah, these people actually exist!  Christian Bale's real life counterpart is based on Michael Burry (google him).  And Steve Carrel's character is based on a guy named Steve Eisman.  The Ryan Gosling character also exists and he really did employ a Chinese mathematician that he liked to show off during meetings.  People will take away different lessons from this movie.  And people will argue who is to blame.  The Federal Reserve chairman at that time (Ben Bernanke) and various other assorted American authorities proclaimed the housing market solid and stable.  And they were wrong.  Even Warren Buffett didn't see the crash coming.  A handful of oddballs asked questions and put their money where their mouths were.  They got rich but not without cost.  I like this movie because it tackled a difficult subject and succeeded.  It is original, funny, entertaining and educational.",1464566400,5,1736,5.1985559566787005

I live in San Francisco and more and more of us can see that the current tech bubble and the apartment building bubble are headed for some kind of crash.  The IPO outlet for startups is closed, which means that the inflow of funding is slowing down.  Thousands of apartments are being built which will in the end not bring in the level of rent the landlords are anticipating.  Miami is already seeing a slowdown in condo sales.  For more background see a book called ""Manias, Panics, and Crashes.""  It's old but still available.

Acidic, biting, and desperately sad, the movie chronicles the towering arrogance that led to the mortgage crisis that took so many Americans to their knees, even as they were paying off Wall Street greed.

Full of half-truths, simplistic cliches, stereotypes, & fantasies told by an extreme leftist writer.  Barney Frank et al & other Democrats who primarily were responsible for drafting the Socialist mortgage polices which nearly destroyed our country were left out of the picture while Greenspan falsely blamed.  Many Dems should have been jailed just as deservedly any Wall Street bankers.  The ridiculous Govt policies of the Left were the biggest part and also ""Act One"" of the mortgage crisis.  The banks and Wall Street were ""Act Two"" (the melt down would have eventually happened even without bundling, but admittedly the bundling made things worse)..  Very little about govt, a primary cause, was discussed in any detail or correctly attributed in this trash flick.

Having what there was to work with, this film does a great job of telling a potentially boring story into an exciting expose on the how our markets collapsed.  I really believe that everyone should watch this.  Those of us who had an inkling that this was the case were called conspiracy theorists shortly after the recession began.

We enjoyed the movie, but wouldn't recommend it other than to start a conversation about what happened to the economy, how accurate is the film, and has anything really changed.  But it's not a deep engaging drama nor a highly entertaining comedy. It's somewhere in the middle of both. It's an acceptable film worth viewing for the information and for a few excellent performances.  But, in general, we were rather bored through much of it, and not because the numbers talk eclipsed our understanding, but just because it wasn't as engaging for us as many had found it.

The gist of the film is, ""Greedy people took great pains to siphon money away from the unwary.""  The big investment tip is, ""Bet against hope when the payoff is super high versus your exposure to risk.""
But the surprising aspect of this film is the wealth of explanatory cameos.  Wow!  At least for a few minutes after each explanation, I understood something about investing I never knew before... which had the greatly beneficial effect of permitting me to comprehend just what the heck was going on in the next few scenes.

Christian Bale is, unsurprisingly, excellent as the Asberger's afflicted financial whiz kid who masterminded the whole concept of the ""credit default swap"". Ryan Gosling is appropriately smarmy and greasy as the broker who got in on the ground floor.

This movie offered additional insights to what is possibly the biggest scam on the American public ever, and may be the biggest scam of any time ever!

I had a substantial career in Banking before I got into my current profession, and I had to watch parts of it twice to get it all.

7494766,5,B0177ZM3MI,"What an entertaining, yet terrifying movie! So many highly intelligent, competitive stock traders from the big banks missed or refused to see the financial writing on the wall in 2008. It was too hard to acknowledge the economic devastation that was about to happen, so they were in denial. A few traders figured it out, though, and took a huge gamble in shorting their positions in a hot market.
The performances in this movie are brilliant. Especially fascinating is Christian Bale's take on his character. You find yourself rooting for him- even though his success coincides with an economic meltdown for the country. Superb takes by all the actors on the mostly real-life people they portray.
Oh yeah, highly recommended!",1461369600,,725,5.05
7494767,4,B0177ZM3MI,"The Big Shorts declares that it is based on a true story. The implosion of the mortgage bond market in 2008 is true, but events in the movie have been fictionalized and characters inspired by real people but not based on them. Our narrator is Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), a bond salesman at Deutsche Bank who creates credit default swaps (CDS) on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and tries to sell the idea of a housing bubble to clients. The first person to act on the teetering mortgage industry is Michael Burry (Christian Bale), head of Scion Capital, who buys bespoke CDS from every Wall Street bank that can produce them, believing that many MBS based on adjustable-rate mortgages would be worthless in 2007. Mark Baum (Steve Carell) of FrontPoint Capital is convinced that Varrett is right and jumps on board. Meanwhile, Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Whittock) are trying desperately to gain access to the CDS market.

The only name that has not been changed is that of Michael Burry. The real Burry does, indeed, have a mild form of autism, but I somehow doubt that he grooves to heavy metal music. The Big Shorts soundtrack is heavy metal. The other characters are heavily colorized and fictionalized, though the gist of their role in shorting the housing bubble is real. Jared Vennett is based on Deutsche Bank bond salesman Greg Lippmann, who did not feature heavily in Michael Lewis book The Big Short but was interviewed for Gregory Zuckermans The Greatest Trade Ever. Adam McKay, who directed and co-wrote the film, employs a litany of creative measures to make the material interesting and comprehensible to a broad audience. He puts the personalities over the top. He has a pretty blond in a bathtub explain sub-prime mortgages and CDOs. Chef Anthony Bourdain explains packaging of loans. Selena Gomez explains CDO-squared while playing blackjack.

Sometimes it comes off as silly. But McKay gets an A for effort in trying to get this material the audience it deserves. The movie has a narrow scope by necessity. It doesnt address why widespread fraud was allowed to continue in the mortgage industry for so long or how or why the banks managed to get entangled in it. It says nothing good about the banks, ratings agencies, lenders, SEC, or the FBI. Its a broken system. But The Big Short, the movie, is reluctant to brand those who profited from the fraud and stupidity of others as heroes, even if they earned the right to do so. It does make the smart guys, both big and small players, look good. Truthfully, Margin Call (2011), which focuses on traders caught with the toxic CDOs, is a better and more insightful film about the financial crisis, but it did not find a wide audience. The Big Short is Adam McKays attempt to convince a broader audience of the intrigue and importance of this material.",1461369600,,2844,4.825819672131147

7494797,4,B0177ZM3MI,"I watched this slow-moving movie all the way through.  What?  Why?  Because this film--as brilliantly acted as it is--is valuable for the secret TRUTHS which it divulges.  Those secrets are interesting.  Those secrets are still affecting our lives.  Those secrets are only the tip of the iceberg.  Those secrets are evil.

The way this movie educates the viewer while depicting the lives of these everyday financial figures is masterful.  I really enjoyed every performance.  I felt no disruption of pace when the characters stopped to educate us directly.

Get ready to be angry, deflated, amazed, depressed, and enlightened.  The banksters rule us all.  The banksters care for no one but themselves.  Our government is nothing much more than a big, bureaucratic, bankster plaything.  And I mean ""plaything"" in as mean-spirited and perverted a way as I can without having my review pulled.

These men were poised to make money you can only imagine.  Because they knew what the banksters knew!  They did everything correctly.  But they did not expect the far-reaching evil of the banking empires.  Their lives were changed greatly, but not exactly in the ways they expected them to be.  Which is fascinating.

That performances by Bale, Gosling and Carrel are remarkable and the the script is so efficient, memorable, diverse and well-acted that the audience receives the message but is entertained. The cinematography is unreal and the direction, in collaboration with editing, is profound.

*****The all white cast bums me out. There was no reason that the cast had to be entirely white. Some names and characterizations of their real counterparts were changes. Micheal Lewis' book does not need to take skin, or gender for that matter, as seriously as they do. Only Bale and Carrel are irreplaceable. Anna Kendrick, Jennifer Lawrence, Idris Elba, Michael B Jordan, Adrian Grenier and many others could have easily played characters that were cast as white, European men.*****",1461283200,,842,5.427480916030534

7495011,5,B0177ZM3MI,"The cast is brilliant.  Christian Bale, not surprisingly, inhabits the nerdish M.D., Burry, who forecast the mortgage meltdown.  The real standouts, however, are Steve Carrel and Ryan Reynolds.  Carrel is almost unrecognizable as a banker with a conscience. The other cast takes a back seat and they are fine too.  But the real star of this movie is the story.

In 2007, as a long time real estate professional, I saw the writing on the wall.  Unfortunately, my advice to sellers:  ""Please, please, sell now,"" fell mostly on deaf ears, all convinced there was no bubble.  One couple, a physician finishing his residency and his wife, an attorney, refused to consider an offer on day 1 that would have taken them out whole, having paid them back for all the mortgage payments and expenses for the term of  the residency.  No amount of explaining and cajoling convinced them.

That house sat on the market for four.... 4 .... years, while they paid the taxes, insurance, maintenance and mortgage payments, and, in the end, the house sold for about what they paid for it originally 7 years' earlier.  What is truly shocking is that this is a story with a happy ending - two professionals were able to meet the monthly expenses for four years... but, as this movie so brilliantly portrayed, what advantage would there have been for someone with zero equity in the home, struggling to make mortgage payments even at the low teaser rate, who were then faced with rate adjustment to keep paying? Why not just throw the keys in the mailbox and let the bank take the hit.  The banks got a bailout but the homeowner, not so much.

There are no real heroes in this story.  Nobody turned down the profits reaped for doing the research that one would think big banks would do.  What is more shameful, however, is this:  rather than holding those banks that formerly would give a loan to anyone accountable, those bankers live on without much impact on their lives.  They got the bailout.  They resumed their careers and hard working Americans paid the price.  Now, even qualified buyers are faced with multiple hurdles, questions, and endless frustration in an attempt to purchase a home.  What was once a dream for every American, home ownership, has been largely abandoned by millenials.  An entire generation is finding it easier to rent than go through the onerous process of attempting to own.  After all, if the new apartment begins to need work, just move to another complex.  If mortgages have been the lifeblood of American banks and nobody wants a house, then what?  Big Short 2?",1461196800,2,2576,4.747747747747748

7495015,5,B0177ZM3MI,"The Big Short is an edgy, contemporary film utilizing comically informative fourth-wall-breaking asides and surprise cameos by celebrities explaining economic concepts in layman's terms.  This is basically the Deadpool (2016) of expos-style financial movies, so let's try not to miss this one!

As the story unfolds and we delve deep into the investment banking world, we cut to interjections like ""and now here's Margot Robbie drinking champagne in a bathtub"" and she (Margot Robbie; Suicide Squad, The Wolf of Wall Street), as herself, explains the terminology and investment strategy in question.  There are other surprise celebrity cameos and I'll dare not spoil any more for youjust know that they add something very special to this already exceptional film and keep it from being anything but boring.  Actually, I found it wildly entertaining!

The cast does an amazing job delivering a topic formally most interesting to Forbes-minded, Wall Street Journal-subscribing middle-aged investment bankers.  The script is stylishly packaged  to appeal to young filmmakers, mainstream movie fans and those who delight in raunchy comedies alike.  This may sound unrealistic, but my father and I both loved it.  He (a doctor) watches almost nothing but business news in his spare time and I (an entomologist) usually stick to horror and martial arts flicks.  This should say something about the compelling appeal about this film.  And it's something exceptional.

Assuming the narrative disclosure's honesty, the film even delights in pointing out that ""yes, that [real life event] really happened"" or ""well, actually that's not how it happened.""  I found this style most charming.  It reminded me of when I nearly pissed myself laughing watching Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson grilling hands in Pain and Gain (2013)--which, according to the movie, was ""still a true story"" at that point.

The cast finds Marisa Tomei, Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling reuniting from Crazy, Stupid Love (2011).  Ryan Gosling (Drive, Only God Forgives) effortlessly slips into the sleek role of Jared Vennett, a character that embraces Gosling's smooth talking yet jerky charisma while successfully suppressing his Hollywood pervasiveness as a sex symbol.

Meanwhile, just one nervous tick away from full-blown Asperger's we find Christian Bale (The Dark Knight Rises), who likewise sheds his sex appeal and dominates our attention as the medical doctor-turned-prodigy investor Michael Berryman.  We watch as he struggles to wrestle his ill-explained yet thoughtful insights to his hedge fund-managing employers that ""just don't get it.""  Not only do they not understand why he would bet against the American mortgage industry (i.e., invest in ""shorting"" mortgages, hence the title), they actually think he's gone insane and so does the remainder of the investing world.  The data is there, but nobody is looking at it.  So they all blindly follow, chant and worship the golden mortgage idol, ""the bedrock of the American economy"" during the NINJA (i.e., no income, no job, approved) subprime loan era that inflated the bubble whose burst was heard round the world.

Carell and his investment team are somehow likable (to the audience) as a group of otherwise easily dislikable analysts.  They serve as our investigators, skeptics-turned-believers in the crusade to expose the great lie beneath.  Whereas Bale is the brilliant and somewhat self-interested prodigy seeking to profit from the realized pending bubble, Carell's team represents our protagonists.  Bale is the laughing stock Victor Frankenstein to Carell's fanatical and oft-doubted Van Helsing.

More closely reminiscent of a misunderstood movie physicist, Bale doesn't wish to share his insights.  Meanwhile Carell is more the whistleblower, the high proselytizer of the truth to Bale's ill-understood Frankensteinian invention of shorting the real estate market.  Carell is a classically guilt-tortured character who channels his energy into making The Big Short  into his personal crusade.  His mission of discovery reveals only horrors: exotic dancers with five houses, loan officers who brag about submitting mortgage applications for clients with neither jobs nor FICO scores (i.e., NINJA loans), alarming payment delinquency in nice neighborhoods and, worst of all, bogus financial ratings.

As if taking a trip to financial Oz, Bale is the brain, Carell the heart, and Gosling the pretty face from Kansas, but it's Brad Pitt who breathes harrowing soul into the film.  Regardless of the financial or moral incentive, Carell and Bale are most concerned with ""being right"" and proving it to others.  Pitt, however, has no horse in this race and illustrates the terrible reality of what it means to regular, average, tax-paying Americans if all this turns out to be true--and the audience FEELS it because we've, in fact, lived through it!  But so easily do we forget our hardships long after they've passed.  This film does a Hell of a job reminding us, even touching those who were not so harmfully left in the wake 10 years ago in the crash.

Director Adam McKay (Stepbrothers, Anchorman 2, The Other Guys), known for his immature manchild R-rated humor flicks, stitches together varying and familiar filming styles into this contemporary masterpiece that is sure to please.  I was quite impressed and honestly never wanted this movie to end.  The powerful emotional response I felt was tremendous.  I was reminded of my reactions to such films as The Adjustment Bureau (2011), Rush (2013), Castaway (2000) and A River Runs Through It (1992).

Among Ex-Machina (2015) and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), The Big Short was among the best films of the year!  Maybe tied for my favorite of the year, and not a single CGI alien or machine gun to be found!

Even without discretely defined villains, torrid love affairs, brilliant orange explosions reflecting on glistening sweaty inflated biceps or giant CGI monsters fighting giant CGI robots, there are films whose very unfolding provokes powerful reactions of sentiment, self-reflection and moral justice within us. The Big Short  is one of those films!  If not the best film of the year, I'd posit this to be the best filmmaking of the year and among five Academy Award nominations it won for Best Adapted Screenplay.

1. Not blaming the federal government enough, or nearly at all.
2. Pushing a left agenda at the end.

If you're going to make a movie based on a true story with a synopsis at the end, make it right.  Government gave the power to hand out loans to people that couldn't afford houses.  Those people were responsible of knowing they couldn't make payments, and they still took the loan.  So don't push some bs agenda of banks just blamed immigrants and poor people that took loans.

7495071,3,B0177ZM3MI,"It had way to much of the f word which added nothing except for filler dialogue.  They could have used actual dialogue instead and so added to the explanation of just what the heck was going on.  Pretty much is was a bunch of guys freaking out the entire movie over this deal they wanted to do to short the sub-prime housing market.  I had no sympathy for any of them because it was all about their greed vs the greed of the bankers.  I'd like to see a movie that explains the 2008-2009 crash that actually has some characters that most of us can relate to, ie non- Wall Street types who were affected by the mess.  The movie was short on explanation and long on cursing. Typical of Wall Street but not interesting or informative.  I rented this movie because I'm very heavy into exploring the economy and the markets, though I am not a player as it is completely rigged and anybody not on the inside is going to get hosed because of high frequency trading the fact that information is released to the inside way before the outside and it takes a lot of money to be privy to such info.  I watched this movie by myself because I knew the language would be filthy, which it was and I didn't want to put anybody else through it.  I thought of buying the book but there is really no reason to.  BTW, another economic crash is coming that will completely dwarf the last one.  This is because nothing was fixed and Wall Street and the revolving door of Washington/Wall Street appointments has grown a lot worse.  Politicians are completely dependent on Wall Street to keep them in campaign money and the ones who aren't bought don't last long.  Everything they say they've fixed is simply smoke and mirrors.  The reason they are all hiding their money in offshore accounts is because of the deluge coming very soon.  Believe nothing they say, watch what they do and then you'll know the truth.

7495072,4,B0177ZM3MI,"Overall this is a very good movie.  It is not a feel good movie or one that flows smoothly, but the latter is partly due to the fact that the filmmakers decided they needed to use a couple of cinematic/literary devices to explain elements of Wall Street lingo and processes.  They do a good job educating the audience so it doesn't get lost, but it keeps the movie from gathering as much steam as it might as a drama.  I only give it 4 stars because it leads you to believe it is telling the whole story about the mortgage meltdown and crash of 2008.  Having read a lot about the crash and contributing factors I think it does an important and mostly accurate job in a fairly entertaining way, but it leaves out or glosses over several important contributing factors to the crisis.  The role of de-regulation (often pointed to by the political left) and the Community Reinvestment Act as well as activity by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae (pointed to by the political right) are never mentioned.  The role of economics and mathematical ""whiz kids"" who started showing up on Wall Street in the 90s with the sole purpose of manipulating existing products and practices in such a way as to seem to generate revenue that really wasn't there isn't discussed either.  I guess that is nitpicking on my part, but I always worry when the masses don't get the  real or whole story; be it from Hollywood, the media, politicians or whomever.  A mis-educated populace is just as dangerous as an uneducated one.  Still, at the end this is a good, very watchable movie with great acting and an important message- just not the whole message.",1460764800,3,1621,4.577854671280277

7495110,5,B0177ZM3MI,"I am a firm believer that anyone who understands greed can understand what precipitated the financial crisis of 2008. The terminology erects a barrier to understanding, and the movie really helped explain all those crazy acronyms. Even so, events went by pretty fast and a few things were not made clear. As an investor I was watching the whole drama unfold pretty closely. The terms really are daunting, but at some point I realized what the people were doing with all those new-fangled investment vehicles. What they did is very simple actually. It's basically Greed Gone Wild.

Here is a summary of the main thrust of the movie:

1) The home mortgage up to that time was considered one of the safest kind of loans because the collateral for the loan is land. The building on the land is also considered good collateral because it must be insured against disaster (like fire) before the loan is made. The traditional 20% down payment helped to insure the property was always worth more than the amount due on the loan.

2) Traditionally, home mortgages represented a loan from the neighborhood bank or Savings and Loan. The bank earned money on the interest paid by the homeowner as the principal was being paid off. Sometimes a bank would sell the mortgage to another bank. This usually generated a small profit for the bank and freed up the cash to make another loan.

3) In the late 70s a mailroom clerk turned vice-president at Solomon Brothers, Lewis Ranieri, got the idea to pool a large number of mortgages together and sell them as a single bond. They called it a Mortgage Backed Security, or MBS.

4) A Mortgage Backed Security is an example of a financial engineering process known as securitization. Securitization is simply the act of grouping together a number of assets with limited liquidity (how fast they can be bought or sold), and turning them into an investment instrument (a security or bond) that is traded daily on an open market with thousands of participants. Securitization, in and of itself, is not a ""bad"" thing, but it does open the door to potential abuses. Another term, Tranche, simply refers to a section or portion of the security, in this case an MBS. For example you could have the AAA tranche of the bond, the BBB tranche, and so on.

5) Mortgage Backed Securities became wildly popular because they were deemed extremely safe investments. Institutions in the business of rating securities (Moodys, Standard and Poors, Fitch) gave the MBSs one of four tiered investment grade ratings (AAA, AA, A, BBB). Pension and retirement funds, which are always seeking a way to get a safe return on the billions of dollars they manage, LOVED the MBS. In fact, the MBS was so beloved that there was more demand than supply.

6) The demand for Mortgage Backed Securities was so great it caused lenders and mortgage brokers to think up creative ways to make more home loans. A simple way to make more loans was to reduce lending standards. This gave birth to the subprime loan (the abuse begins). The minimum credit score (FICO score) required to qualify for a home loan was lowered. Minimum income level was lowered. The minimum down payment was lowered. The result was a lot more mortgages were created. And thus a lot more Mortgage Backed Securities were created, satisfying the insatiable need of the market.

THE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE HERE IS THAT THE BANK MAKING THE LOAN DID NOT HAVE TO WORRY IF THE HOMEOWNER WAS GOING TO MAKE THEIR PAYMENTS ON TIME, BECAUSE THE BANK IMMEDIATELY SOLD THE MORTGAGE TO A FIRM THAT WAS POOLING THE MORTGAGES TOGETHER AS  MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES.

This is how the term liar loan came into being. It got to the point where people were just making up numbers when they filled out a loan application, as the information was not being verified. There was no reason to. The risk was being transferred to someone else.

7) At some point enough people were late on their mortgage payments that the average MBS containing the mortgages was under threat of having its rating lowered, thus lowering the value of the MBS. In order to cover this up the CDO was invented. The Collateralized Debt Obligation is just a fancy term for repackaging risky mortgages in such a way that the rating agencies gave them an investment grade rating. Think of a CDO as different lipstick on the same pig,

THE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE IS THAT THE FRAUD SHOULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED HERE. THE RATING AGENCIES PROSTITUTED THEMSELVES TO INSURE THAT THEIR VERY LUCRATIVE INCOME STREAM FROM RATING ALL THE MBSs AND CDOs WOULD CONTINUE. As the character Georgia who worked for Standard & Poors responded when Mark Baum (Steve Carell) asked if the firm had ever refused to rate even one single bond at the percent of AAA requested, If we don't give them the ratings then theyll got to Moodys, right down the block.

8) People like Michael Burry (Christian Bale), Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), and team Charlie Geller & Jamie Shipley figured out how shaky the MBSs and CDOs were. Burry in particular saw an upward adjustment on the interest rate on Adjustable Mortgage Rate (ARM) loans coming. He foresaw that the resulting higher monthly premiums would cause defaults on the mortgages. Burry and the others coaxed banks into insuring the MBSs. The industry term for insuring securities is Credit Default Swap or CDS. This is not a very intuitive phrase but think of it like this:  If there was a *default* on the *credit* extended to the buyer then the CDS holder gets to *swap* the bad paper for cash. The banks thought that Burry and his ilk were insane to pay a recurring insurance premium to protect against an event that had not occurred in recent memory, but they took the money anyway (after all, they are banks).

9) Even with relaxed lending standards creating record numbers of mortgages to feed the MBS pool, the market place demanded even more of these super safe investment vehicles. Too much demand. Too little supply. So this time the problem of insufficient supply was solved by creating a CDO of a CDO. They called it a synthetic CDO. The synthetic CDO was simply a side bet on a CDO. If the CDO made money the synthetic made money (as we saw take place in the casino scene). Now the securitization process was really getting abused.

10) Burry and the others had of course made their own kind of side bets on MBSs. The bet these guys made wasn't that the securities would be successful, but rather that they would fail. THE BIG SHORT. The investors in MBS, CDO and synthetic CDO made money, either directly or indirectly, from the interest homeowners were paying on their mortgage. Conversely, the holders of Credit Default Swaps made money when the homeowners stopped making payments.

Note: It's worth noting that there are two ways the CDSs could make money and this is not emphasized in the movie. One is if an outright default on the MBS was declared. In that case the bank simply was bound to pay out on the insurance policy (the CDS). But also as the RISK of default rose, the CDS itself became worth more, and could be sold to someone else seeking protection from default. The CDS could be traded like any other security. And that is what you saw Mark Baum do near the end of the film. He didn't wait for a default on the MBSs. He sold the CDSs to another party and a huge profit.

Being able to sell a CDS as opposed to waiting for it to pay off turned out to be quite helpful because the twist with many CDSs was that the banks that held the failed mortgage bonds were often the same banks that had sold the CDS protection (that was the reveal Kathy made to Baum in her office regarding Bennie Cleager selling CDS protection to cover his subprime losses). Ha. Ha. Ha.

Except the joke was on the American taxpayer as most of the banks got a get-out-of-bankruptcy-free card. As the whole fiasco reached a crescendo, all the financial institutions holding the failed derivatives were trying to sell them off to other unsuspecting institutions (as opposed to doing the right thing and taking their losses). It was a like a game of hot potato. But someone had to end up holding the bag. At some point everyone wised up and was in a panic to buy insurance on the MBSs and CDOs they still held. That bid the price of the credit default swaps held by Burry, Baum, Jamie and the others through the roof. But even the CDSs were at risk because many of the firms that were to pay out if the CDSs were triggered were busy going insolvent from subprime related losses. Before the bailout came it was looking more like musical chairs, only with no seats left for anyone in the game. Burry and the others appeared to be getting out just in time. That is why near the end of the film Vinnie was begging Mark Baum to sell his CDSs. In short order the swaps were expected to be worthless. As it happens Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail. Hundreds of other institutions like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America were saved from bankruptcy, by you and me.

Epilogue: The twists and turns in this real life story, like so many Hollywood movies, seem to never end. At the end of the day The Big Short postulates that the banks knew all along that a taxpayer bailout was their ace-in-the-hole. And yet even after this particular movie ends the twists and turns continue. The widespread fraud that Mark Baum spoke of in the debate with the famous bullish investor continues. I would suggest you google the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. This law, passed in response the events depicted in The Big Short, actually does exactly the opposite of what its name states. The new ace-in-the-hole the banks have the next time this happens is far scarier. Please educate yourself and take what precautions you can.

A great an equally entertaining film that compliments The Big Short is Margin Call, which gives a look at how a large fictitious (but not really) Wall Street bank realized that everyone on the Street had drank the same Kool-aid, but that it was about to turn sour, and how this one bank sold out right before everyone got wise (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Margin-Call/dp/B005FITIGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Margin Call</a>).

They got it right in staying close to Michael Lewis's account of what happened by which players.  It's a very disgusting true story that should strike fear that these disasters on this scale, for these types of reasons, are still possible.

The Ayn Randers,  Greenspan actually was an Ayn Rander, got their chance to see how the old crazy lady's ideas actually work out in the real world.  This story is a cautionary tale of what the transformative policies offered by the right will do again.  They can't stop.  They can't learn.  It's a program that they need to do every time.  This is the result,  and it's not even the 1st time.  We had the Great Depression, the S&L bailouts after Reagan, and then this epic financial collapse in 2008.  We've had some healing, but this dark menace is determined to up the stakes.

The formula is: tax cuts and no rules for the rich and corporations.  The result is financial collapse, every time.  Looks like Ted and Donald want $10 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years and to put an end to regulations.  A progressive tax system provides stability.

No movie claiming to be a true story of the 2008 financial industry melt-down can ignore their role.  Fannie & Freddie, not the crooked Wall Street bankers, set the standards for low-down, no-down and no-doc loans which were aggregated and sold to investors.  Sure, lots of people were acting in their own personal interests, but that included those supporting Fannie and Freddie, which dominated the market then, and still do today.

This is a Hollywood hit piece that is hostile to Wall Street.  It will delight the progressive left, but it ignores the perverse policies of the US Federal Government in the financial industry. Furthermore, the foul language is offensive and gratuitous.",1460246400,,812,4.897810218978102

The cast led by Christian Bale (superb as usual in his Oscar-nominated performance as Michael Burry), Steve Carell (in another superb performance as Mark Baum), Ryan Gosling (solid as usual as Jared Vennett) & Brad Pitt (who also produced) (also solid as usual as Ben Rickert) is brilliant. The (Oscar-nominated) directing by Adam McKay (who also co-wrote the screenplay) is brilliant. The (Oscar-winning) screenplay (based on the novel by Michael Lewis) by McKay & Charles Randolph is brilliant.

The music by Nicholas Britell is brilliant. The cinematography by Barry Ackroyd is brilliant. The (Oscar-nominated) film editing by Hank Corwin is brilliant. The casting by Kathy Driscoll-Mohler & Francine Maisler is brilliant. The production design by Clayton Hartley is brilliant. The art direction by Elliott Glick is brilliant. The set decoration by Linda Sutton-Doll, set designs by Chris Arnold, Jann K. Engel & Wright McFarland, set dressings by Matthew L. Crowson, Saul Cruthirds, Patrick Jackson, Justin Meriwether, Joe Petruccio, Alan Muzeni, RJ Wilson, John J. Polster, Kelly Oates, Neil Giovaniello, Nic Metcalfe, Rachelee Sanchez, Walt Dickerson, Gregory T. Geniusz, Shelby Gillen, Severin Lagarde, Gerald Palone & Paul Pitalo is brilliant. The costume design by Susan Matheson is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Victor Paguia & Chris Fanguy is brilliant. The special effects coordinated by Michelle Dickson & Drew Jiritano and supervised by Blumes Tracy & Matt Kutcher is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Richard Bluff, Joe Ceballos, Paul Linden, Edson Williams & Thomas Nittmann is brilliant.

This is a brilliant, well-done, well-crafted film that is entertaining and somewhat, different. Christian Bale & Steve Carell give superb performances as Michael Burry & Mark Baum and Ryan Gosling & Brad Pitt are solid as usual as Jared Vennett & Ben Rickert. Adam McKay has directed his best and most interesting movie to date, thus far. This is (or was) one of the best films of the holiday season (holiday 2015) and also was one of the best films of last year, as well, too.",1460073600,,2342,5.24
7495188,4,B0177ZM3MI,"I'm sure a lot of this is going to be dense for people not read up on subprime mortgage loans. But they simplify it by allowing cameos to instruct you like a hygiene film back when I was a kid. It's comical in that it's told to hold your interest on the insanely ridiculous way the government sold the American dream and then...allowed the banks to dick us. If you believed in those types of things. Because the victims are watching the movie, slowly fuming, while the real people out there who fleeced us...well, they keep living.

This movie should be required watching to anyone who trusts people in suits too much. Hard work and earning a plot of land is a perfect way for these wolf in sheep's clothing to sell you. Worse, when they are your neighbor. Now the interesting thing about this movie, is that we are watching the hunter watching the wolves watching the sheep. Yep, it's that dense. And I am sickened at the very thought that there...well, I won't give it away only that it's eye opening, sobering system of capitalism, that you can believe or not. I think it happens. I've seen some of my friends who've bought into the system, only to have a ghost town pop up where there was once hope. It's a haunted house story at one point. The remnants of dreams are far scarier than any murder. Because, the system runs deeper than we realize. How do you plug a dam after the hole has exploded? Why grab some buckets in start baling? Nope. Continue the path that we've set out. All to get richer. You know what that is? Morally bankrupt people. The movie does a great job in fleshing out the groups of people who did cash out on the insanity. But, they aren't proud of themselves. They are just as brutalized when some conclude the resolution didn't adjust the moral fiber of the American Dream. We sold ourselves way too short, in essence, when we wanted something for nothing.

Whenever their is an impending economic collapse you can be sure that it is the government which has driven it to the brink and not private enterprise. Although there was plenty of complicit corporations which greased the skids for the government to work its politically corrupt insanity. And guess what, its happening again.

7495240,5,B0177ZM3MI,"The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine was written by Michael Lewis and was published in 2010. It's a very good book and its portraits of those few individuals who managed to predict the financial/housing crash are compelling. It was not much of a surprise that this should become a film. It's a great film too. Since this is a relatively compact story centered on just a few characters it becomes a compact, fast-paced and utterly fascinating movie. I saw this on Amazon Prime and so can't comment on the quality of the DVD or Blu-ray.
The film doesn't stick to the original characters from the book so there is some renaming of characters which can confuse if you've read the book. Christian Bale's portrayal of Michael Burry is superb as is that of Brad Pitt and Steve Carrell. It was a pleasant surprise to see Karen Gillan as an SEC investigator, she's clearly recovered from Doctor Who quite well.
The film does skip about which could confuse some but overall it manages to convey the tension and trauma of those caught on both sides of the crash. It ends with an ironic comment regarding how many bankers were arrested for causing the crash.",1459641600,2,1152,4.651960784313726

What is frightening to me is that there is STILL NOT MUCH REGULATION ON WALL STREET...I will not put my money in the stock market any longer...you might as well go to Las Vegas.
  As for the movie - it is very complicated, and it moves too fast for me - there is too much ""overlapping"" of stuff which makes it even more confusing - I barely understood what was going on - So, perhaps it wasn't that the movie wasn't good - I just didn't know enough to understand it.",1459555200,,1069,4.262376237623762

 It is once again ""based on true events"" and is told from the perspective of several people/groups who predicted the housing bubble and economic collapse of 2008. It explains in lay man's terms how the crisis was reached and shows how the idiots who screwed up the economy did so. If everyone who went to see Star Wars had gone to this instead, there would be a hell of a lot more people involved in the political system just trying to prevent this sort of thing from happening again.

I'm one of the handful of people that was working in the industry that was taken down by a lot of the policies that Bernie Sanders has been talking about. I worked high tech and lost my job 6 times in 25 years. I managed to get rid of a house and a condo before the crash. I am especially impressed that those who made this movie possible included in the message that the people who truly suffer from all of this but the innocent, those people living in tents or out of their car. I will never again watch a speech from President Obama, Alan Greenspan, or former Attorney General Eric Holder and not feel that they could have been so blind as to not see what was going on and essentially do what the Catholic church does along with other churches. Instead of putting the criminals Behind Bars they allow them to bribe their way out of judgement. To those directly involved with knowingly ripping off the American people, I must hope that as a Christian God himself will punish them for the millions and millions of people that they harmed. This is a movie that brilliantly took a  complex subject and broke it down so the average person could grasp it. People like Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez were kind to risk making this movie. I am a Bernie Sanders supporter and I think I understand why Bernie keep saying the same thing over and over again at every rally. I think he knows that the average American has to have it beaten into their heads time and time again. Bernie is a honest and a decent man in a very very troubled world.

7495263,5,B0177ZM3MI,"The perils of herd mentality in the mortgage markets, and the pitfalls of corruption that are still very much with us, are the serious messages that come out of this zippy, well-informed, surprisingly intelligent (and only slightly fictionalized) feature movie.  Based on veteran financial journalist Michael Lewis' 2010 bestseller of the same name, which profiled the 2008 crash in residential mortgage ""paper"" and the tiny handful of people who had had the insight and integrity to see it coming despite the financial establishment's insistence that nothing could go wrong, what amazed me in this entertaining and enlightening movie is how well it does justice to Lewis' straightforward but rather complex text.  Yes, one time two characters break the celluloid proscenium (so to speak) and tell the audience directly that they weren't REALLY thrown out of the lobby of an investment bank building, but close enough.  Welcome comic relief comes in the form of guest ""witnessing"" by chef Anthony Bourdain, Selena Gomez and other celebrities to explain the intricacies of home mortgage ""packages"" and that creature from financial hell, the Credit Default Obligation swap, which essentially takes huge piles of mortgages heavily shot through with garbage (I almost used another word) and spins it enough to lose track of the essentials and appear attractive.

Definitions and complex terms are actually a very small part of this movie, though.  The enduring themes are that nobody wants to buck a herd mentality, no matter how ludicrous that mentality has come to be.  Why would anybody seriously involved in Wall Street's take on mortgage liquidity want to listen to a couple of very small-time financiers who figured out in 2007 that the mortgage market was bound to collapse catastrophically -- well, they didn't, despite accurate predictions based on accurately observed data.  At least, not until a couple of accidental encounters and the recruitment of a semi-survivalist burnout from the financial markets (delightfully underplayed by Brad Pitt in a smaller role than usual), set up the conditions to skin the big banks who can't bring themselves to accept, institutionally, what an unstable fraud they are perpetuating.

The principal players -- Christian Bale, Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling -- are wonderful too, all of which makes THE BIG SHORT an excellent movie that holds some dire predictions.  When the financial services industry is allowed to perpetuate derivatives upon derivatives -- as they are now doing again, eight years after the crash that caused the Great Recession -- what happens when the markets crash again?  More taxpayer bailouts, and politicians who once again will blame ""poor people and immigrants"" is the prediction at the end of this insightful, memorable movie.  I recommend THE BIG SHORT without qualification, whether in book or movie form, or both, but I will point out that since the dialog reflects the speech of young competitive men under stress, a great deal of swearing is involved -- something you might want to think about if small children are around.",1459468800,7,3100,5.229838709677419

It's not anywhere in the same league as Wolf by means of comedy or action but the acting on the part of Christian Bale and Steve Carrell is really great! Ryan Gosling is a handsome guy for a ""babyface"" type in all respects as well as Brad Pitt whose obviously good looking. As an average man myself, makeup did a very good job at bringing these two down to Earth and making them look relatable. A bit hardened and stressed for their roles instead of their overly easy lives in Hollywood (beyond the acting part). I liked what Adam McKay did with Margot Robbie in the bathtub. It's like here's all this hard, corporate banking jargon that you probably won't understand anyway. So lets put here in a soap and bubbles bathtub and you can focus on her instead of what she's talking about. It was very good directing. There's a term for that which now escapes me.

7495289,3,B0177ZM3MI,"I sat down to finally watch this Oscar nominated movie last weekend and I found myself baffled as to why this is listed in the comedy genre. In my view it's not even a dark comedy, there's really nothing funny at all about it. Is it a good movie...yes, overall I'd say I enjoyed it. The problem I did have with this movie though was how it was filmed, I didn't like all the chaotic skipping about...it made the film feel choppy to me. I did like the subject matter though and it was interesting at times how they had guest appearances to explain certain things that were going on. I could have lived without the actors breaking the fourth wall...but honestly, that's just me...it's not as if that was over-done. So my main reasons for giving this movie a three is...it's NOT a comedy, not in any sense of the word and the choppy cinematography. The acting was pretty good (Bales, character was EXTREMELY annoying...but he was supposed to be)...and the subject matter was portrayed in a way that does keep the viewers attention. This should have been a drama though.",1459468800,3,1065,4.552083333333333

So many deserved punishment compatible to the enormity of their greed but no arrests were ever made.

7495354,5,B0177ZM3MI,The movie was absolutely great!  I did not fully understand what caused the sub prime real estate loans and this definitely explains the problem.  What it did not fully expose was our governments hand in giving the financial institutions the ability of dishing out the loans by bundling them to mask the risk (Bill Clinton).  This is no different than what I see in corporate America......the cover-up that takes place when things fall and the people that always get hurt is the low level not upper management.,1459296000,,510,4.839080459770115

Government was in bed with the rating houses while deregulation (oversight) of the big banks and brokerage houses was non-existent. Not really political, but funny and informative. Scary thing is the crash really didn't change much about the system. What did change was just how much the tax payers share and national debt we incurred went up. Sadly we all have to bail them out (national debt) and probably will do so again unless the system itself changes. It's either that or the world economy will collapse the next time possibly. Takes on a whole new meaning for ""my brothers keeper"". Shame on them for letting it happen, shame on us if we continue to let it happen again.

In the hands of director and co-writer Adam McKay, known for material like Anchorman and Step Brothers, this is a fun and, ultimately, shockingly eye-opening movie.

The performances of Steve Carell, Christian Bale, and Ryan Gosling are all top notch.  Brad Pitt doesn't get to do a lot but he's good as well.

An interesting film, tries to be entertaining with comedic relief to keep the story from getting too dark and making you cry with frustration and maybe want to take down some corporate financial  buildings (empty) ala Fight Club.  Gosling looks a little weird, but Carell, Bale, and Pitt were spot on .  For a lot of us who brushed with this insane reality in real estate in that period it really strikes home.

A sobering powerhouse film that somehow manages to insert humor into the tale of the greatest economic collapse since the Great Depression.

I previously thought that 'Margin Call' and 'Inside Job' were the two best films to tell the story of the financial crisis but 'The Big Short' blew me away; it manages to take complicated financial products and explain them in a way that anyone can understand. If you didn't know what a CDO-squared, synthetic CDO or Credit Default Swap was, no worry -- this film presents the clearest and most painfully honest portrayal of what caused the crisis and the prescient few who saw it coming.

Additionally, one of the greatest ensemble acting performances you will ever find.",1459123200,,893,4.830065359477124

7496341,5,B0177ZM3MI,"The Big Short expresses what I feel and am experiencing so well.  Most of the time I feel I'm alone with my never-ending shock over what happened, and how it has NOT been addressed. A line in the film -- ""There are no grown-ups in the room"" -- sums it up for me.

I was thrilled to see such an innovative handling of characters, content, and story.  There is nothing conventional about this film.  All primary actors are excellent.  I like the way the camera is almost an amateur presence surrounded by real people.  Then the ""real"" people suddenly look into the eyes of the audience and engage us directly to explain something.

I don't think this film could have been produced immediately after these events.  There is a wisdom and cockiness or ""attitude"" that has needed time to develop.  There is no doubt in it's message, nothing like doubt I experienced in the Wolf of Wall Street film.  Because by now all of us who lived through this know the facts, the facts did not have to be argued. ( May we not forget or let others distort the facts.)

The Big Short made me aware that individuals had significantly different views and experiences of the crisis.  Of course, many people seem to not even have developed a view or experience of it at all -- which is  seriously worrisome. Pass this film around; we need to keep the conversation going. I'm also concerned about what young people who have come of age since the crisis are learning and believing about it. I hope they ""get"" this film.

At the end the main character seems convinced that Goldmen Sachs et al KNEW what they were doing and knew they would be bailed out by the government.  A Wall Street Journal writer believes that NOT knowing for sure what the government will do is what CAUSED the crisis!!  It's amazing that these folks want to have permanent promises from the government yet they themselves don't acknowledge at the root of the crash is  their abuse of trust.

Trust is great when it works.  But it can't work when it has been so completely and thoroughly undermined.  Finally no one needed to know what other banks held in their portfolios because all the players knew it wasn't stuff that should be trusted. Real choices and behaviors are what caused the crash.

Whether the key players in finance actually knew or not what they were doing is secondary.  They SHOULD have known, and COULD have easily known.  It did not take clever, smart, or ""special"" people -- just individuals who, for whatever personally unique reasons, were eager or willing to wake up. The film seemed to say that.

We seem as humans to fall into a habit of knowing only what we want to know.  Perhaps almost everyone in the movie (except the central characters) should have been wearing silly dark wrap-around glasses like the woman at the ratings agency to symbolize this.",1459036800,,2827,4.594810379241517

Hollywood has a history of conveniently shaping events so they make the sweetest music on the screen. However, the structure  does give one a birds eye view of how ""the great recession"" came to pass. That i finished this movie with an understanding of what a tranche cdo is, (sort of) satisfying.  As far as an emotional reaction, one which sets the movie up to give a target for those affected by the miscreancy, I get the feeling the movie is just a  picture in a moment of time of people who thought they were just playing by the rules of the game. That thought is noted in a quote by Twain at the start of the movie.

this very complex and appalling story of Wall Street and the collapse of 2008. I learned so much by watching this.

Although it is a dense story it was treated in a somewhat fanciful and light-hearted manner. There are  plenty of laughs, yet of course this was never a joking matter. Wonderfully produced and edited. Once again, every actor did a fine job.",1458950400,,643,4.663716814159292
7496347,5,B0177ZM3MI,"THE BIG SHORT is outstanding in every way, not least of which is its ability to keep visual interest in what is basically an arcane subject. Adam McKay, the director, weaves in music and all kinds of visuals to keep us glued to the screen, and in my case it worked almost too well. I saw this for the first time in a movie theater and halfway through began to feel ill (it was a small theater and the smell of popcorn was overwhelming). However, by this point I was so invested in the film that I refused to leave while it was still playing, and it held my interest long past the end. Now, two months later, I think I've re-watched it at least a dozen times, and am still enthralled. This is a spectacular movie.

The writing and acting are top-notch, and I agree with those who singled out Christian Bale's performance as Dr. Michael Burry, a decent, brilliant and visionary guy who first saw what the others came to realize: that the housing market was being propped up on toxic loans that could never be repaid. I also loved the two young guys (Finn Wittrock and John Magaro) who run a fund in their garage and somehow learned about Jared Vannett's offering and jumped on it. The truth is, though, that virtually everyone in the film was brilliant. I'd never seen Ryan Gosling in anything, but he was wonderfully convincing as the fast-talking Wall Streeter who narrated the story.

This is a truly must-see film, and by far my favorite film of 2016 (so far). It's the best explanation for the disaster that befell all of us, and for that reason alone, should be at the top of your must-see list.",1458950400,,1599,4.4353741496598635

7496374,5,B0177ZM3MI,"Only after I watched the film did I realize that the underlying book of the same name was penned by Michael Lewis, the same author who wrote the also fantastic ""Moneyball"", also made into a terrific movie.  It helps to have a great story to tell, which we have here.  It also helps to have a huge stack of actors who reach deep into their selves to bring out their very best efforts.  Steve Carell in a very vivid and not one bit funny dramatic role has never been better.  Christian Bale as stunted genius Michael Burry is also at his best, and his best really reached the higher limits of the actor's craft.  Smaller roles, all also excellent, come to Ryan Gosling, Marisa Tomei (is she the most expressive actress working?  Maybe.) and  Brad Pitt.  Also watch for a tiny role by Max Greenfield, now appearing on TVs wonderful ""The New Girl"".
  The story revolves around the cataclysmic bursting of the real estate bubble in 2007/2008.  Rather than explain the totality of the implosion, the movie focus' on the very few money men who took the time to examine their world and who found a way to profit from the disaster.  These guys were not simply very very smart-they live in a world of people who have IQs in the top fraction of 1% of the human race-but of smart people who can think clearly when others do not.  They as individuals made a load of money when others lost amounts so large as to be beyond understanding.
  The movie makers tried to help us understand the complex workings of the highest levels of finance by interjecting asides by the likes of Selma Gomez and other famous folk.  In the midst of the action, a familiar face tries to explain some aspect of finance to us.  It works too, I at least thought I understood the process even if I doubt that I could repeat it.
  Never did the movie mention the role of the federal government in precipitating the crisis in the first place, which I found disappointing if not surprising.  Much was made of the fact that people could get a mortgage without having good credit-indeed without having any way to realistically pay their loans.  A quip was made about NINJA loans-that is a loan made to a borrower with No Income and No Job.  But no mention was made of the requirement by the Feds to make loans based upon --not the ability of the borrower to repay the loan---but on Federally perceived fairness.  Without that pressure, the crooked excesses clearly shown in the movie would never have been possible.
  This film captures and holds the attention of the viewer.  And nothing blows up, no bad guys get shot.  This is superior film making.  And putting in four Oscar winning actors and two more nominees does not hurt a bit.",1458777600,,2693,4.508264462809917

Still, the casting and telling of the story was perfect and the movie did a fantastic job at explaining in layman's terms how financial firms on Wall Street and their political enablers fraudulently and purposely wrecked the WORLD economy... and sadly, how they are still doing it.

Brad Pitt helped produce this movie.  I was never a huge Brad Pitt fan, but over the last few years it is clear that he has evolved into an intelligent, thoughtful and concerned world citizen who seems to care about his fellow human beings (his work during Hurricane Katrina, his production of the movie 12 Years A Slave and The Big Short, etc.).

7496404,3,B0177ZM3MI,"A well made film about a few guys who bet against the crowd and won big. Great cast, good story line, a Must watch, 4 or even 5 star film.

I Gave it a ""3"" Star rating because it skipped the first decade of the story, and completely missed the underlying root cause of the disaster that was the 2008 market collapse.

The true causation can be traced back to the mid 1990s. And it was actually not the banks that started this ball rolling.
Banking pre-1990s, as far back as the 1700s remained relatively constant, it was a well established and somewhat boring and conservative business. Banks had long established lending practices and standards that made them profitable and stable establishments. There were a few flaws that came up every so often, but typically market related. Or related to the more progressive fractional reserve banking not keeping enough cash on hand for bank runs, but runs were not very common and fractional reserve banking has merit, as everyone uses it today.

Back to Banks, they had well constructed businesses that held onto depositors money, and then would lend that money out via loans and mortgages seeking a small return of interest. (Typically pre-90s interest rates were between 6-15% in stable countries. This was and is a bit expensive).
Banks lending standards would not allow them to lend high risk loans, that is, loans with a certain chance of not being repaid, As a default was a serious hit to a banks bottom line. This incentivized banks to keep standards tight, and avoid lending to credit-risk people. They developed the Credit Score system, as well as outright refusing to lend money on homes in declining areas, for fear of the buildings depreciating in value far below the mortgage value and increasing likelihood of default.

Those Declining areas tended to be inhabited by the less fortunate and even outright poor* citizens, who also had a hard to taking small loans to build credit rating they also faced a huge challenge of affording a house in a good and more expensive area. Effectively banks ""discriminated"" against the poor and minorities, because to lend large sums of money into degrading neighborhoods to people without a track record of repayment could bankrupt them. This phenomenon has existed for centuries. Lenders don't want to give money to those who more often do not repay.
(I'm not suggesting wrong or right, I'm stating facts that simply ""Are"").

Some time in the mid-20th century, once the USA had become wealthy and many people were affording to own homes, the national average of home-ownership plateaued around the 50% mark, with half owning homes and half renting. This continued for several decades though the 1980s.
Well, some studies conducted tied home ownership to reduced crime and increased education levels, and increased personal wealth. Along with dozens of other positive benefits, and they also noticed a much higher percentage of minorities did not own homes, but rented. And this is where everything took a turn.

Politicians in Government realized these statistics might mean something, and they concluded that if you could increase home ownership, you would reduce crime and violence, and increase wealth, especially among poor and low income minorities and single parents. So they set about trying to raise home ownership a small percentage to a target of 60% to try out this theory of wealth generation and crime reduction.

Government found that the Banks were holding the strings to this plan, as they controlled lending standards. Banks simply refused to lend money to the very people the Government was trying to help! So Politicians worked with banks to lower their lending threshold to lend to those with much lower credit ratings and also to lend on homes previously ""black listed"" from mortgages due to declining areas.

Banks initially pushed back, and proved they would be forced to the brink of disaster if they lent to many ""bad loans"", those that were defaulted on. So the US Government offered to back banks if to many of these new, high risk loans were defaulted on. If the bank were forced to the brink of collapse the government would buy these loans or reimburse the bank for the losses these new regulations created. These promises were made over 10 years before the '08 collapse, and after the crash, Bankers reminded the Government of this, who then were obligated to repay the losses and bail out the banks, because they had struck a deal with them a decade before.
Remember, the Government cannot repay anything, it has nothing that it does not first take from the people. This is never more clearly demonstrated than the massive bank bail-outs by taxpayer money, the middle class and working class funded the banks salvation.

All of this created massive-backwards incentives for banks. Banks had always been on the hook for loan defaults, if they lent bad loans they would go out of business. The government rule change, and the fact they promised to back any failing loans with taxpayer money incentivized bankers to not only be less risk adverse, but created a whole new incentive to loan as much money as absolutely possible! If you cant lose money, because government put a floor on your risk, then you would of course loan out everything you have to anyone with a pulse. This is what they did. This is what happened.

This may sound like bankers Greed. And it absolutely is. One could argue that the banks, even with non existent losses should have been more conservative in their lending. But one must remember this is all simply an exercise in human actions. The bubble and the crash were all driven by human instinct. Greed was certainly a driving factor. But Greed could be argued is only a strong self-preservation instinct all humans share. Everyone acts in their own self interest nearly all of the time, its innate and almost primal the instinct to desire security and quire things that provide it, like shelter and food and status and of course the surplus of it all. Example;

Politicians looking for a way to boost the economy, to increase wealth for the nation and boost fame and fortune for themselves at the polls.

Bankers are business men always looking for a profit, they were limited by the limited supply for high quality mortgages they could lend. The new lending standards and promise of government insurance on bad loans incentivized banks to lend more so as to gain more in interest and free repo-property paid for by government/taxpayer money.

Loan officers working for banks and brokers were paid commissions, this incentivized them to lend as much money as possible to as many people as they could. As they were paid on every transaction, they could then buy a better house/houses and cars and vacations and things, again, self interest.

Would-be home owners, average people that are given the opportunity to live a lifestyle they dream about, they took the easy money for their own self interest as well, to live in a better home. They saw the market going up, and realized that it was possible to buy a home many times what they could afford, and simply refinance it for more and more as it went up in value, using that money to pay the mortgage and buy new cars and things. Self preservation/self interest. See where I'm going with this?

See, everyone was acting in their own self interest inside of an unstable market created by government in the attempt to produce more home owners and better school grades.

...And the end result is, Government changes banking policy, creates bad banking incentives, promises to cover all losses, human beings act of those incentives in a predictable manner, everything goes to good to be true... then it stops. Everyone points at everyone else and lays blame on greedy bankers. Ignores government intervention from a decade before, ancient history and all, Then government bails out banks with your own money they took from your paycheck, then creates massive bank regulation that discriminates against would-be home buyers even worse than they had it pre-1990s!

There are scenes where a song comes in to underscore the emotion of the moment or heighten the feelings of the characters involved but it ends up drowning out the dialogue.  Another offense in the sound design is when two characters are speaking to each other on the phone, one rampaging and loud, the other softly replying, each one indiscernable as one blows up the mic and one must strain a second later to hear any of the mumbling of the other.  The sound levels are awful!  Also, the frequent use of 'breaking the fourth wall' is more jarring than involving for the audience, and is a prime example of the screenplay being too clever, indeed.  Let's involve some minor celebrities, etcetera, to patronize the viewer even further.  Those involved pretending to know what the heck they are talking about is ludicrous.

Pharrell, remake of the Lithium song by Nirvana performed by another group, Milkshake by Kelis, Feel Good by the Gorillaz, and more.  Some of the celebrities featured in this film; Margot Robbie from The Wolf of Wall Street film,Richard Thaler, Selena Gomez, Anthony Bourdain (my husband sometimes watches Anthony Bourdain on tv),. Some of the locations featured in the Big Short movie; 25 Broadway Standard & Poors Ratings Agency, American Securitization Forum, 112 Avenue of the Americas (Wall Street Journal), The Black Horse Pub in England etc.  During part of the movie, one of the characters is eerily shown predicting that immigrants, poor people and teachers are going to be blamed for the financial crisis (around the time that movie is shown where many of the big banks received financial bailouts). There is also one fact that was shockingly listed; 8 million people lost their jobs, 6 million people lost their homes, and this was just in the U.S.A.  I want to list more but my intuition is guiding me to avoid doing so out of respect for the people looking at this review who still want to see The Big Short movie. Additionally, I wonder if The Big Short movie indirectly has any parallels to the student loan situation. Less than 18 months ago, I noticed that some people were predicting that the student loan epidemic in America is the next financial bubble to pop but I noticed that discussion of that through mainstream media channels appeared to die down for now.  Anyhow, I admit to having student loans but fortunately my student loans die with me as I do not have a cosigner and I know that Ill get  judged for admitting this but I do not regret taking out student loans because the experience has helped me to further logically avoid borrowing for anything else (credit or loan wise for the rest of my current lifetime) since July/August 2013 (except for a class that I wanted to take around May 2015 but the student loan available was possibly not going to cover the full amount and so I changed my mind to even swear off further student loans for myself for the rest of my current lifetime regardless of what others think of me doing so).",1458432000,,3220,4.741071428571429

I am of course skeptical - but it is my hope that our citizens will wake up and watch this movie in an effort to understand just exactly what the system has allowed to happen on our dime.

Wake up people, put down your phones and your Kardashian BS, watch this movie and read up on this topic and don't stop until you can explain what happened intelligently to a friend and a loved one - then go do it.

I do remember this story about the few traders / people who saw clearly the logic was not right. When all those documentaries came out around 2011-2012, almost all of them focused on the government and banks. The story of the ones who bet against the collapse was only covered in maybe 2 of the 8 or so documentaries I had watched.

7496457,5,B0177ZM3MI,"The Big Short, written by Charles Randolph and Adam McKay, based on the book by Michael Lewis, follows a handful of men who predicted the collapse of the American economy in 2008.  Few were paying attention to the actions of venal bankers who made a mint bundling and selling securities filled with subprime mortgages. Eventually, these mortgages were packaged together and sold as CDOs (Collateralized Debt Obligations). Christian Bale plays Mark Burry, an eccentric genius, who decides that he will boldly ask banks to come up with a new instrument, a credit default swap, that will enable him to bet against the American economy.  If too many mortgages were to go belly-up, the housing market would collapse, and big banks would fail.  Ordinary people would lose their jobs, pensions, and homes, but Burry and his company would make a fortune.

Others who made similar deals were Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) and Mark Baum (Steve Carrell).  Baum is a profane and perpetually angry individual who says what he thinks, to the consternation of his wife and colleagues. In addition, Brad Pitt has a small role as a retired trader who helps a pair of eager young investors get in on the action. Celebrities such as Selena Gomez and chef Anthony Bourdain look directly into the camera to explain arcane economic concepts to us in simple languagealmost like a grade school primer for the financially challenged.

The bad guys grin smugly, since they are certain that the SEC and credit rating agencies will not undermine them.  Even the winners are losers, since Burry and Baum feel guilty enjoying their windfalls while their fellow Americans are in a world of pain.  Although we know what will happen, McKay still generates a feeling of suspense and tension.  The Big Short is hilarious, fast-paced, eye-catching, and hard-hitting.  The Oscar-winning adapted screenplay, edgy performances, terrific editing, and imaginative direction make this an entertaining, colorful, and informative look at the enormous price that the global economy is still paying for the misdeeds of selfish and immoral swindlers in fancy suits.",1458432000,,2117,5.145772594752186

7496463,1,B0177ZM3MI,"I don't often write movie reviews, but felt compelled to in this case. Going into this, my expectations were already quite low. After all, how could one expect Hollywood to accurately portray this in an unbiased way? In Hollywood's view, the big, bad banks are horrible entities that provide no value to the global economy. I was certainly right about their portrayal of them. But that isn't really the reason for my harsh review. Frankly, this was a poorly made movie with an awful script, awful characters and bad acting. The story line is disjointed and the movie just does a terrible job making the financial crisis into an entertaining story. The plot spends so much time focused on a group of eccentric characters, the plot unfolds incredibly slowly, and it portrays events in such a silly way that it's obvious conversations and events wouldn't have actually taken place that way. Bottom line, a terrible movie on many fronts. If you want to learn more about the financial crisis, there are plenty of better options.

7496464,4,B0177ZM3MI,"Having been one who was trying to sell my home in the middle of the crash that occurred a few years back, this movie struck a chord with me.  This movie I would describe as a sarcastic docu-drama based on all the factors that created the global economic collapse caused by the sub-prime market.  Although this doesnt sound like a topic that would be entertaining as a movie, this was to me better than I expected.  There is a ton of star power in this movie, including Christian Bale, Steve Carol and Ryan Gosling among others.  The movie also has Brad Pitt, who I didn't recognize in his beard and scruffy look. Bale and Carol are excellent in their respective roles. Carol especially in the fact that he plays a more serious role than he normally does.  I do think that the story is a bit choppy at times and sometimes gets a bit deep into the minutiae of the factors that caused the crash but the movie does a pretty decent job at keeping your eyes from crossing by giving a basic explanation along with some funny moments to help provide a dumbed down description.  With those moments, it makes for a movie that makes you feel like you are about to see a train wreck but you cant take your eyes away.  It really is a fascinating watch and smartly written with some clever humor that shows pretty well the underside of the banking industry and stock market.

The inflated market in home mortgages had four pillars -- the home buyers who bought things they couldn't afford, the  misguided government policies that encouraged bank lending to people who couldn't afford what they were buying, the greedy banks that were indifferent as to the quality of the mortgages they were packaging and selling, and the investment managers who bought the shoddy mbs products.

7496593,4,B0177ZM3MI,"Great topic. Very good and easy to follow topic explanations for technical concepts. It was disturbing how reality and economics in this case are at odds. The problem is concepts are for Free Markets and Wall Street, Banks, and Government action are far from free market action when you ad in greed and fraud, they never will meet.  One wonders how anything will survive the next Big Bank/Wall Street/ Insurance Company failures expected in 2017. A theme which played and I almost missed was the Mark Twain quote ""Faith is believing in something you know just isn't so."" to refer to the underlying belief that our economy couldn't fail. This belief extends to the dollar, stock market, financial institutions and home mortgages. It was crazy when the mortgage bonds were loosing value and prices were dropping while the S&P valuation did not drop. In a free market system this is impossible, unless you allow for greed, fraud, incompetence, and unlawful government intervention. You might have to see this twice to get all the action explanations. It is powerful stuff and will be used to explain many other thefts from the middle class of savings, retirement funds, investments, jobs and homes.",1458172800,,1195,4.975

7496703,4,B0177ZM3MI,"Adam McKay directs this American historic nightmare for which he also wrote the screenplay with Charles Randolph based on Michael Lewis book. Despite the fact that the film recreates the (in many ways) origin of Wall Street corporate greed and the loathing of the wealthy bankers for the rest of us who suffered because of their illegal shenanigans, and is cast with some fine actors, the taste the film leaves in the mouth is so bitter that it is difficult to honor this award-winning film with a review.

The plot is far too well known to us all (though the language of the film  all in corporatese and financial mishmash is tough to follow) and is best left with a brief synopsis: Revisit the stock market crash and near dissolution of American economy  as Michael Burry (Christian Bale), an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Four denizens in the world of high-finance predict the credit and housing bubble collapse of the mid-2000s, and decide to take on the big banks for their greed and lack of foresight.

The funky weirdo characters are well portrayed by Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, Maria Tomei and on and on. They pull off the disgust we feel for corporate greed and manage to recreate this nauseating time in our history very well. It just is not a pleasant film to watch.

7496704,1,B0177ZM3MI,"Only tells one side of the story! Doesn't mention that Democrats in Congress pushed for ""everyone"" to have a mortgages, lowered the standards for approving mortgages and fails to mention that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages, were the drivers for no doc loans. They just showed a brief shot of a Fannie Mae document. This is why they purposely did not mention any party specifically. But judging by the shots they had in the movie, they only blame one party. Guess which one? Actually, Senator McCain (I'm no McCain supporter) went before Congress, to tell them that this was going to happen and was shouted down by Dems. One of which was Senator Barney Frank, one of the biggest champions of Fannie and Freddy mortgages. Which is quite ironic that after the bubble he helped greatly to create, he would lead the fight for ""more"" regulation, for a problem he purposely glossed over. If you don't believe me, simply go to youtube and search it out for yourself . They still have the CSPAN footage of Congress. Unfortunately this movie is progressively liberal slanted, and can only be counted on as entertainment and not a truthful story. Yet they claim it is a true story as they portray a story about fraud? Well, at least a quarter of it is partially true. It was like watching the movie JFK and believing it was all true even though Oliver Stone said he created JFK purely for entertainment value and only used the story line from history while inserting his own fictional account. I was actually hoping for a middle of the road story. Which would have made for a better story line.

7496736,5,B0177ZM3MI,"'The Big Short' is the kind of film I was prepared to hate. The 2008 financial crisis looms large in my mind. I remember McCain canceled his campaign for a while to go to DC and see what was going on. Obama continued and looked at the crisis and told us what  was going to do about it. Now, this film brings us the background to fully understand the mortgage mess.

We meet some of the Wall Street outsiders who figured out the worsening mortgage bond disaster three years early, and decided to become part and parcel by betting against it. This kind of negative investment is called shorting, thus the film's name. Before we go further I must discuss the look of these men, 1980's fare. Curly hair, spray tans, hippy dress, beards, long hair that is sometimes varied in hues. Your favorite actors may not look the same. We meet Jared Vennett, played by Ryan Gosling, a man that does not give us the feeling of great trust. Michael Burry, played by Christian Bale, a hippy with bare feet, a glass eye and great intelligence. Mark Baum, played by Steve Carell, and this is the best if not over the top performance.  Retired banker, Ben Rickert, played by Brad Pitt. All of these men, horn in on the scheme.

One of the best parts of this film is given by Celebrity stars who pop up with important information in funny cutaways. I learned more about mortgage bonds, shorting, CDOs, which are subprime mortgages bundled together as a supposedly safe investment. We follow the outsiders as they develop leads and find homes with people running out on their mortgages, remember those days?

An excellent film that delivers a punch, but has moments of boredom and then hilarity.

7496794,5,B0177ZM3MI,"""While the whole world was having a party a few outsiders and weirdos saw what no one else could."" In the mid 2000's Michael Burry (Bale) could see there was a housing market collapse coming. He decided to purchase a short, betting that the collapse would be massive. When word of this gets around more and more investors do the same thing. All betting that the US economy would tank. The bad news is they were right. They scary news is that this is a true story. This is a very good movie that is a little confusing to understand, for me anyway, but they did a good job of explaining it for non-wall streeters to understand. Just about everyone remembers this crisis and what happened and the fallout. What I didn't realize is how out of hand the mortgage loans became and why the collapse was so catastrophic. The more the movie went on and the more was explained the angrier and angrier I became, and by the end of it I was glad I didn't have anything to throw because I would have needed a new TV. This is the type of movie that is important and will hopefully change things, but judging by the way the actual crisis was handled I doubt it. Overall, a movie that I highly recommend and think everyone should see, but make sure you're alone after because you will be in a bad mood for hours.

Neither aspect of the film was pulled off very effectively. True documentaries on this shameful but unfortunately unfinished testimony to American greed have been far more effective in portraying how it all worked. As an actual plotline it was a far from compelling story of less than engaging characters who seem to have little in the way of relationships and real lives. The drama of the story, such as it was, revolved around whether the protagonists were going to get paid off on their short positions before the guarantors went bankrupt. It wasn't totally clear who got paid what but, more significantly, I didn't particularly care.

7496940,5,B0177ZM3MI,"For my money, this is the best, yet most disturbing movie I have watched the past year.  I wish it would have won the academy award for Best Picture.  My personal hero came to be Steve Carroll's ""Mark Baum""-  FrontPoint Partners hedge fund manager - a character based on the real-life Steve Eisman.  The idealistic Mark Baum is relentless in his pursuit of ferreting out the truth behind Deutsche Bank bond salesman Jared Vennet's claims that at Deutsche Bank and others, bank fraud was in place that would cause a collapse of the housing market and ruin the lives of millions of average Americans as its pawns.  (The real life inspiration for character Jared Vennet is Deutsche's Greg Lippman)

The movie begins in 2005, when (real life) Silicon Valley hedge fund manager Dr. Michael Burry (played by Christian Bale) discovers that the U.S. housing market is extremely unstable, being based on subprime loans that are high risk and providing fewer and fewer returns. Predicting that the market will collapse sometime in the second quarter of 2007, he realizes that he can profit from this situation by creating a credit default swap market, allowing him to bet against the housing market. He visits several major banks and investment dealers with this idea; these firms, believing that the housing market is secure, accept his proposal. This earns the ire of Burry's clients who believe that he is wasting their money and demand that he stop his activities, but he refuses.

Deutsche Bank's Trader Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) hears of Burry's actions from one of the bankers he dealt with, and soon realizes that Burry's predictions are likely true. He decides to put his own stake in the credit default swap market. A misplaced phone call alerts hedge fund manager Mark Baum (Steve Carell) to his plans, and Baum is convinced to join Vennett. The two discover that the impending market collapse is being further perpetuated by the sale of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), groups of poor loans that are packaged together and incorrectly given AAA ratings due to the conflict of interest and dishonesty of the rating agencies.

When Baum attends the American Securitization Forum in Las Vegas, he learns of the existence of synthetic CDOs, making what is described as a chain of increasingly large bets on the faulty loans. Baum realizes, much to his horror, that the scale of the bank fraud against the American public will cause a complete collapse of the economy. Baum's business partners convince him to go through with the credit default swaps, profiting from the situation at the banks' expense.

As we know in the end, Deutsche and the other banks' fraud did indeed ruin of millions of Americans' lives - just like Vennett's demonstration game of Jenga gone horribly wrong.  I've included photos of the real Michael Burry, Steve Eisman, and Greg Lippmann alongside their Big Short characters.  Again, in my opinion, this should have won Best Picture.  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!

Another deserving movie that helps to show the corruption fallout that ruined so many average Americans' lives at a personal level is ""99 HOMES.""  It demonstrates the banks' fraud in robbing millions of Americans of their homes in orchestrated defaults by the loan servicers and banks.  Prior to very recent Supreme Court rulings, the lower courts just ignored the defrauded homeowners' pleas that the defaults were often rigged, (including payments refused so the loan servicer could claim ""non-payment"" and bogus ""forced placed insurance fees"" that immediately put the owner into default, even though they actually had their own insurance in force ).  Careless judges wrongfully have helped the defrauding banks and loan servicers to rob hundreds of thousands of innocent people of their homes.  Pay attention as Dennis pleads to the judge that the servicer told him not to pay his mortgage for 2 months so that he could qualify for a modification.  That is indeed one of the scams they perpetrated against homeowners.  Then instead they tacked on so many bogus fees the homeowner couldn't meet them, and would also deny the modification application and foreclose.  99 HOMES can be purchased here on Amazon, and like The Big Short, is an intensely good portrayal of how these corrupt banks brought down the American economy, and wreaked devastation on so many innocent people.",1457308800,13,4373,5.038834951456311

7496955,1,B0177ZM3MI,"It's pretty rare that I hate a film. I love pretty much all movies.

This film was absolutely terrible, because of the way it was edited and presented.

The opening of the film is presented as an old-school slideshow, rapidly switching between different scenes. Unfortunately, it just got worse from there. The editing is jarring--usually transitions between cuts are smooth in the sense that your eye level stays the same. They deliberately (I have to assume it was deliberate) force your eye to rove during frequent cuts which induces motion sickness. As does lots of shaky handheld camera work.

The sound mixing is terrible. They cut from blaring heavy metal and people shouting to people speaking so quietly you can't hear them. We had to continually adjust the volume.

In short, the film is designed to be jarring. But not in a ""this story is jarring"" kind of way--rather, they are doing this to induce it subconsciously or to provoke a specific reaction in the viewer. I absolutely hated this film for this reason, and I can't recall the last time I had such a visceral and unpleasant reaction to any film.

Michael Lewis has a gift for writing about stuff that nobody understands, including the people who do whatever he's writing about.  But Michael shells it down to stuff we can get, and the movie team on this one got it right.  The book is longer, more detailed, more character-driven; but the film delivers the message in day-glo orange and any number of other colors.

Usually, that would be a start to ""the book was better and the movie stank"" kind of review, but somehow in this case, the movie seems to capture the spirit of the book without being beholden to it.  If you enjoyed the movie, I do recommend the book.  And oddly, vice versa.  I appreciated the way the movie made the story darkly funny and frankly cool (even if disturbing) in a way that books simply can't do.  Those who fail to learn history are doomed to repeat it.

Far too many scenes that did not move the story forward should have ended up on the cutting room floor but I know why they didn't- there wouldn't have been enough left to cover even an hour of screen time. Christian Bale and Steve Carrell seemed so over the top for me. Their over-acting seemed so self-serving to me. I could almost see them agonizing over making their characters bigger than life as they practiced. Several times we heard characters say they never claimed to be heroes. But saying that does not excuse what they did. All of them did what they did out of greed and nothing else- even Carrell's character whom they'd like us to believe suffers so much from his discovery.

Had any of them had any real integrity, they would not have all profited so much and would have worked as hard
to expose the crime as they did to make money off of it. The actors attempts to humanize the characters fail.",1457222400,5,977,4.427777777777778

It's also very sad and disconcerting just how many corrupt, evil, and unethical people there are in the securities, banking, and corrupt indexing businesses.

In 2006 I was telling people housing was definitely going to crash.  A chart published by the CSFB was all I needed to see at the time.  Mortgage resets told me as much.  I believed the markets would get hit for maybe 20% overall.  Was I ever wrong.  Things were much worse overall than I ever imagined.

As I watched this film I truly felt I was reliving those times.  As an 'armchair wconomist' I fully understood what was happening then, and found this film a very fair representation of it.  The actors did a particularly masterful job of portraying the 'players'.  The mark of a good film is to draw the audience into it.  It worked for me!  As o said before, those who panned it clearly must not have understood that which they watched.

If you have considered this film, you would be remiss not to see ""Inside Job"" to help round out the overall picture.

Finally, it is sad to say this is not over.  The fraud continues, the banks control the Congress and 'reform', 3% mortgages are back, and nothing has been fixed.  It's all been veneered over with Fed printing and ever more fraud.",1457222400,,1369,4.386454183266932

The main characters, observed what was going on as Wall Street pillaged everyone related to housing, including the consumer.

The movie makes a very complicated economic terms and processes easily understandable and explains well what happened just before the great recession of our century, why it happened, how it happened and who is to blame for it.  It is factual and it also shows our government and leaders for what they are - completely sold out to wall street and big banks criminals; up to now no one has been jailed or punished for millions of people loosing their homes, pensions and life savings, while CEOs, wall street, hedge funds and banks are making huge profits again and returned to unsavory money landing practices.

7497332,5,B0177ZM3MI,Great movie.  Thought it might get a little boring but not at all.  Very well done!,1456704000,,83,4.125
7497333,3,B0177ZM3MI,"As far as it goes, the movie does an admirable job of explaining the lead-up to the financial crisis, which was its main focus. The movie gets a lot of things right, particularly the go-go attitude on Wall Street and the complicity of the rating agencies in the fiasco. By the way, that conversation with the rating agency representative never would have happened like that, but as a junior corporate attorney working on Wall Street (well, 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, but close enough) before the crisis, I can confirm that the attitude of everyone knows the rating agencies won't downgrade because the investment banks will take their business elsewhere was absolutely pervasive. The scene did the best the medium could do to capture that mindset.

What I object to is the near-total failure of the movie to spread the blame evenly. There are two groups that must shoulder much of the blame but escape either unscathed or nearly so in the movie.

The first is the American public. Living down in Miami at the time the crisis hit, I can attest to the stripper with five homes scenario, although that is somewhat an exaggeration. But it comes down to the seven deadly sins, as so many of these crises do. In this case, two of them: greed and envy. The American public at large got caught up in the allure of something for nothing, easy money, and the desire to have what others have. So even though millions of people who never did anything wrong got hurt (like the renters in the movie), many millions more got their just deserts when the wave broke and it was followed by bankruptcies, default and bad credit.

The second is the government, particularly two aspects of it: the Community Reinvestment Act and Securities and Exchange Commission oversight. The SEC part is covered somewhat crudely but effectively in the movie. The CRA on the other handThe CRA has the effect of encouraging / cajoling / forcing banks to make marginal loans under the guise of nondiscrimination. It was instituted under Jimmy Carter, and upped by both Clinton and Bush 43. Like so many statutory brainchildren in American politics, it began with a good impulse but became perverted by racial politics and crashed head-on into economic reality. Behind a significant portion of the non-performing loans was the impetus to not run afoul of the CRA.

As a person who has some experience in what led to the crisis (in 2001 I worked on some CDOs -- we called them Collateralized Loan Obligations), for my 2 I place the ultimate blame on the ratings agencies and on the investment banks and their attorneys, who should have properly analyzed and vetted the loan portfolios before turning them into CDOs and who should have had mechanisms to continually monitor their performance. There are elements of hubris, sloppiness and group-think on a vast, vast scale throughout the financial system.",1456704000,71,2862,4.83469387755102
7497344,4,B0177ZM3MI,"I know, I know, it's not a horror movie, and nor does it try to be. Let me clarify. The movie is equal parts dramatization and documentary in a way, using clever trickery to do its best to illustrate many of the reasons for the crash, and what came after. Using things like cameos from celebrities to try to quickly and concisely explain margin, to cutting away from a scene, breaking the fourth wall to indicate certain sections which are less than truthful, but necessary to keep up with the pace of the story. They use comedy in the first 2/3 of the movie to get you invested in these characters, in much the same way films like Wolf of Wall St did, except this time without trying to, and in fact so if their very best to do the opposite, glorify the people who caused the collapse.  Before this there's a happy tone not unlike the build up of a heist movie; the good guys are smart, the banks are dumb, let's take them for what their worth, right?

But then there's a moment, a point of clarity where one character begs the question, why are you celebrating? If we're right, were betting against the American economy, he points out. And from then on it goes on to explain that this is not a situation where the good guys win and everything's honkie dorie. By the end of the film, and through the characters eyes, we see genuine corruption, the ruination of lives, some of whom did.nothing more to contribute to the crisis than to show up and pay their bills, and what happens when people are allowed to take something so powerful and unwieldy as the global economy for a ride, while they let people who pay their salaries, pay for their mistakes as well.

And the worst part? It's mostly true.",1456704000,26,1698,4.401273885350318

It's a shame (and a nasty cultural weakness) that Americans no longer read -- 30 years ago we read an average of a book a month, but the average today is one book a year, which seems indefensible until you consider all the digital options Americans have now that didn't exist a generation ago.  Plus a change, plus cest la mme chose.  A pity that Hollywood can't see its way to screen a greater number of comedic films like The Big Short, but this is not the genre that's preferred by our country's mindless millennials who flock to watch Comic Books on the big screen rather than thoughtful, adult-content flicks with a humorous touch.

It does a great way of portraying the idiotic people shuffling large gobs of money around, but it is still relevant to the people who just take some mortgage brokers word for it and buy things they cannot afford.

This film is extremely well done, and does a great job of taking something too boring and complicated for even the bankers to study, and makes it fresh and accessable.

There is nothing subtle about ""The Big Short"" much like ""The Wolf of Wall Street"".

The Big Short (2015) starting Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Brat Pitt, and Steve Carell is an important film, especially in today's fast paced, no-time for family, globalized, time-is-money, big money talks, rat-race, post-modern capitalist society. The film is about a kooky, but extremely brilliant guy who predicts the fall of housing market in the USA based on the fraud crediting sponsored by the big banking.  Couple other guy in business and finance industry find out about that through different means, and they too begin to suspect the eventual collapse of the ""prosperous"" housing market is only a matter of time.

As a result, the ""guys"" decide to bet big money against the housing market and the banks...consequently betting money against the economy that did took a turn for worse back in 2008.

7497489,3,B0177ZM3MI,"Its interesting to see this movie given such heft and respect. Its not really bad, but its very lightweight. Certainly the all-star names are gaudy, but each are relegated to such piddly roles and screentime that they never really resonate as deep or interesting characters. Everyone here is just a tiny spoke in an endeavor to explain a sweeping historical era, which is certainly a difficult thing to capture on so many levels.

The movie is not as funny as it wants to be. It razzles and zips with quick cuts, absurd turns, surprise cameos or meta 4th-wall-breaking jokes, but it never really moves one to guffaw with bawdy laughter. Perhaps there are just some slight smirks at a few wry turns. There might be a lot of style, but not much actual comedy, certainly nothing more sophisticated than people acting goofy.

The movie aims to educate people about this dense labyrinth of grift and finance. While there are some admirable and novel attempts to teach the viewer about how some of the more complicated ideas and terms work, it still falls far short of properly teaching certain key elements of this world. For example, every uninformed viewer will leave this movie still not knowing what a ""short"" is and how exactly it works, despite this being the crux of the film.

But the narratives perspective here is the big problem. The film follows a select pack of businessmen who all profited off the catastrophe. So while the movie works to position them as visionary rebels who defied the corporate greed and ignorance that doomed the world economy well, they lucked out and cashed in on others' pain. The viewer also knows all this from the start, diminishing any doubts about their success. So while there are many millions who suffered and lost from the real-estate collapse, these overnight billionaires are somehow supposed to be lauded and loved now, despite being just the other half of the same vipers who caused all these problems. They certainly help no one else but themselves. So its as if their moral worth and likability are validated by their money and success. Bravo for them, I guess.

A bolder and more engrossing move wouldve been to tell the story from the perspective of the losers  from the foreclosed homeowners or investors who lost millions  a movie which wouldve been more honest, universal, sympathetic, and in the right hands, darkly comedic. But instead, this movie is nice and pat, akin more to a fluffy Daily Show sketch that simply points, grins and shrugs, rather than trying to do some real heavy lifting and fix anything.",1455840000,15,2564,4.8159090909090905

7497491,5,B0177ZM3MI,"This is the story of the hedge fund operators who saw the housing bubble collapse coming and profited by betting against it. We have glimpses of the personal lives and idiosyncrasies of the main characters. Michael Burry (Christian Bale) saw it two years before it happened. Mark Baum (Steve Carell) got wind of it from a wrong number and checked it out himself. There were also two men from Boulder who had figured things out separately but needed the help of Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) to pull it off.

The first hurdle was that there was no mechanism to buy a short or swap against the real estate market. Michael Burry had to negotiate them and the investment companies were happy to take his money and party with it as bonds are never down graded.

The film had a number of asides and documentary style interjections. It took the complex task of explaining market terms by using stars and metaphors. For instance Selena Gomez explains synthetic CDOs at a blackjack table, something that even investors didn't know existed, or at least the film portrayed it that way.

Now the folks who made millions on the collapse of the world economy didn't celebrate on screen. They felt bad winning by betting against the little guy who ultimately had to pay with his job and home.

The film feels partially like a documentary. When something didn't really happen ""that way"" they did an aside to let you know it is a dramatization. And sometimes they did an aside to let you know it really did happen. This film is told from a different point of view then the other films out there, told from the viewpoint of the investment companies.

It was hard not to love the bold character of Steve Carell.

Guide: F-bomb, brief nudity (Mark Baum had to interview a stripper/real estate owner on the job)

7497504,4,B0177ZM3MI,"""The Big Short"" opens with a quote from Mark Twain saying ""[I]t's not what you don't know that will hurt you -- it's what you know that just ain't so."" Most viewer reviews for the movie demonstrate once again that ol' Mark was right.

The movie tells one part of the story of the 2008 Wall Street meltdown. The cast is first-rate, the dialogue (when comprehensible) crackles with authenticity, and the window it provides into the inner machinations of Wall Street is fascinating. The range of personalities depicted -- from the bizarre and nearly schitzophrenic Dr. Burry to the the bitter dropout banker played by Brad Pitt, as well as all the secondary characters who are simply doing their jobs and living their lives -- inadvertently provide reassuring evidence that Wall Streeters are as varied and unclassifiable as we are. And it ought to make all the angry anti-capitalists out there wonder whether, in the same calamitous circumstances, they themselves would have acted so very differently from the characters on the screen.

For behind all the puffery about ""stupidity and fraud,"" most of what the movie depicts seems pretty innocuous -- even admirable. People buying and selling, trying to make a living, trying to provide for their companies and their families, trying to contribute to the gross national product. Yes, the movie depicts the fraudulent mis-rating of mortgage packages by Standard and Poors, Moody's and the other rating services; this was clearly against the law and they deserved the punishments imposed on them. But, if we are to believe the movie, few if any of the traders knew the details of the mortgage packages they were selling. Wall Street investment analyst Dr. Burry was the first person to actually examine and evaluate the mortgages contained in the ""tranches."" He is the first to have determined that AA-rated tranches were largely made up of BBB-rated ""subprime"" mortgages. And he had to actually educate the other traders to the dangers inherent in the products they were selling. If a car salesman sells a car with an unknown defect, is he held responsible for the defect when the car is recalled years later?

The real question (the one the movie doesn't ask) is: WHY did the banks make all these subprime loans? Traditionally, banks like to make loans to people who can pay the money back. Why did they suddenly start making thousands of loans to people who were lousy risks, who had no jobs, no credit, little education and little money? Why did the banks all go crazy at the same time?

The answer is politics. The government forced the banks to lower their lending standards, and start making loans to people who otherwise wouldn't qualify. The Clinton administration knew that the core of the Democratic party was made up of poorly-educated, low income, largely inner-city whites and racial minorities. They wanted to funnel some money to this constituency, and figured that home ownership was an easy way to accomplish it. So, using a law first passed by Jimmy Carter, the Clinton administration threatened to sue the banks for racial discrimination if they didn't start making loans to ""disadvantaged"" people who would not otherwise have qualified. ACORN (the communist/socialist/racist pressure group) held noisy, disruptive rallies in bank lobbies to intimidate and bully bank officials into compliance. And Fannie Mae, the federal government's mortgage agency, was enlisted to buy up what eventually became $1.5 trillion of bad mortgages from the banks that had written them. The managers of Fannie Mae -- all trusted Democratic operatives -- were more than happy to comply. As a consequence, the banks were relieved of any risk of default on these mortgages, and were encouraged to write more bad loans. And before Fannie Mae collapsed, the politically-connected managers cooked the books, so they could award themselves millions of dollars in unearned bonuses.

To say that all this backstory was ignored by ""The Big Short"" is no criticism of the movie. I found it a fascinating and entertaining picture. But to the extent that the movie presents itself as the True Story of the 2008 market collapse, it comes up sadly short. The truth is that -- as with health care, ""green energy"" programs, and a myriad more schemes and scams -- the government muscles its way in, passes laws that distort the markets and benefit its favored constituencies, spends mountains of money that ends up wasted or looted by the politicians, and then, after destroying the market, demands that the wreckage be taken over by the government in the interest of ""efficiency"" or ""fairness."" I'm waiting (so far in vain) for the movie that dramatically portrays the 2009 government takeover of General Motors, in which the bondholders were screwed, the Democratically-aligned UAW received protection for their lavish pay and benefits, and the taxpayers were stuck with an $11.2 billion bill. I'm afraid it's going to be a long wait.",1454284800,4,4963,5.040194884287454

7497506,2,B0177ZM3MI,"Most of the time, I have a lot to say evaluating how well a movie tells its story, artistic factors, and how well written it is.  This movie defies those categories because those three factors are solid, but it doesn't make sense to someone who doesn't already know a lot about the 2008 housing market crash.  I listened closely through the whole movie and didn't come out any wiser.  In ways, it's really entertaining--Brad Pitt urging people to grow their own vegetables because he's worried about the world economy crashing, Steve Carell adding comedy with his neurotic and angry characterization, Christian Bale playing an antisocial guy who listens to death metal music, and Ryan Gosling playing an opportunist.  The characters have separate stories and are based on real people who foresaw the financial crisis and tried to prepare for it, and sometimes tried to prepare others for it.

The quirky style which director Adam McKay brings to it makes it a memorable satire.  However, if the goal was to make it more understandable to audiences, I know I'm not alone in feeling just as confused after the fact.  I'm left wondering whether it's trying to show how confusing the financial crisis is or trying to make it more understandable to people.  I also am very displeased with the excessive profanity, and while many people don't give it a second thought, it makes a movie an unpleasant experience for me, especially the more there is.  At least it's not The Wolf of Wall Street, which I've read set a record on profanity.",1454025600,5,1529,4.827586206896552

To her credit she  left the sleazy world of Wall Street to raise a family. I personally received an application for what is now  called a Liar's Mortgage in 2007 from State Farm! I had the good sense to realize that not having to have the information on my application verified was cause for alarm! I still rent to this very day.

With that said The Big Short is a very powerful movie with three true stories intersecting on what would be a scandal that  could have led to a worldwide collapse of the world's economic system. Nobody talks about this anymore. The Republican critters running for office pretend it never happened even though it is the single most important event of the 21st Century! .

The Big Short made me feel uncomfortable, like it should. I identified with all the main characters since I come from a family of business men. In every disaster there are good guys who play by the rules and get screwed. The near global catastrophe was caused by fraud on such a huge scale that it defies the imagination. How could so many people willingly conspire with each other and do so much harm to the rest of the world and go scot-free? At the very least there should have been a Truth Commission like they had in South Africa.

7497510,5,B0177ZM3MI,"I think when you hear about a movie being made about the financial collapse of the housing market, you don't think ""funny."" That's certainly not what I thought. So I figured this was going to be a serious ""doom and gloom"" kind of movie, but I wanted to see it because it's about the guys (well, one guy, really) who saw the bubble and knew it was going to pop. You hear about the people who saw it coming, but you don't really hear about them, if you know what I mean. They get brushed off as doomsayers who just happened to be right this time but not because they were right but because they were lucky. After all, no one could have seen the coming of the collapse of the housing market, right?
Right?

Honestly, Steve Carell was enough to make me want to see it, but it's a subject I have interest in. And I like Gosling, too. I'm not a fan of Bale, but I do concede that he's a good, possibly great, actor, so I could get let his presence slide. And, um, I had actually forgotten that Brad Pitt was in it at all. I do like him, so that would have been a plus... if I had remembered.

Then the movie turned out to be a comedy! A dark comedy, granted, but a comedy nonetheless. I suppose I could have known that before going in, but I don't like to know too much about a movie before seeing it and the fact that this is a comedy in no way takes away from the movie or the subject matter. Humor may have been the best vehicle for a movie like this, in fact.

Christian Bale plays Michael Burry, the actual guy who saw the housing bubble and knew it was going to burst. I'm not going to get into all of that or what happened because you can watch the movie or do the research to find that stuff out, and you should because it's interesting and somewhat fascinating. That he saw the bubble was not ""luck"" or a good guess or anything like that; it was an ability to look at the data and know what it means, something most (nearly all) people are incapable of. So, yeah, of course it sounded ludicrous when he suggested that the housing market was going to collapse. Also, he was trying to make money off of it but not because he was trying to make money off of it. No, I'm not going to try to explain that. Also, Bale was incredible as Burry. Like I said, he's a good, possibly great, actor whether I like him or not.

Brad Pitt was also cast somewhat against character and, since I had forgotten that he was in the movie at all, it was halfway through or something before I even realized it was him. It was one of those ""oh!"" moments: Oh! That's Brad Pitt! And, well, if someone like Brad Pitt can make me not even recognize him, you have to know that it's a good performance.

Carell was playing more to character, kind of an angry Michael Scott kind of guy, but he was really good and fit the part perfectly. He's actually the guy you end up having the most connection with because he's in this investment business but really hates everything about it. He hates all of the corruption and deceit and greed but, yet, there he is. So, yeah, at first, when he and his group figure out about shorting the housing market (they'll explain that to you in the movie), it's about the money but, as he finds more out about what's going on, for him, it's really about hurting the banks. Carell is actually great in the role and makes you really feel for the character.

Speaking of the movie explaining things, that stuff is awesome. They actually stop the action of the movie to have celebrities explain concepts, like the bit with Margot Robbie in a bubble bath explaining whatever she was explaining (I don't remember what anyone explained, now, so that has nothing to do with Robbie in the bubble bath). Those bits were pretty brilliant; the one with the chef and, um, whomever was with him was probably the best one.

And, oh, yeah, Gosling is good, too, though he didn't really do anything that you wouldn't expect of Gosling, so hos performance doesn't really stand out to me. It's the kind of thing you'd expect of Ryan Reynolds, but Gosling does a lot of that kind of thing, too.

All in all a really great movie, as good as Spotlight, really, which fills me with conflict, because I want Spotlight for best picture, but The Big Short, though a different kind of film completely, is equally as good. I wouldn't want to have to pick between the two as to which one is actually the ""better"" movie.",1452902400,2,4392,4.276774969915764

Most of you probably know this is based on Ken Lewiss book of the same name, which was a look at the mortgage crisis of 2007-2008 as seen through the eyes of three investors who were able to correctly identify the housing bubble and short the market just before it collapsed.  I heard a friend comment he didn't need to watch the movie because I already understand the Great Recession.  I think not one in 1,000 American adults really understands the Great Recession, although everyone thinks they do.  Greedy banks caused it?  As my favorite economist says: Why do you blame greedy banks?  Do you think they are less greedy now?  When WERENT they greedy?  Thats no explanation.  Deregulation?  That was going on for several decades before the collapse.  Excess savings looking for a place to invest?  New untested financial instruments?  I guess what I found the most fascinating question was: of the people who actually CAUSED this crisis: large bank executives, mortgage issuers, mortgage insurers, ratings agencies-- what percent was knowing malfeasance in pursuit of short term profit, and what percent was the nave belief that housing prices never decline nationwide.  Lewiss book, wonderfully written, does address that question.  The movie, though really well-done, doesnt do quite as well a job.  For example I wish Ken Lewis had appeared in the movie as he did in the bookNevertheless as we approach Academy Awards, I think this is a far more important movie than the ones that seem to be larger favorites for best picture.  I was sad to see the theatre in which I watched it was almost empty.  Oh I guess a movie about THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS OF MOST PEOPLES' LIFETIMES isn't nearly as worth watching as...Star Wars VII.  Yes, the acting is very good.  Yes the pacing is good.  The cinematography is competent and unobtrusive.  Yes there's fine black humor both visual and audible.

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

Adam McKay, former head writer for Saturday Night Live, co-wrote and directed this black comedy based on the 2010 book of the same name by Michael Lewis, all about how a few quirky finance guys foresaw the looming financial crisis of 2007-2008, and ended up profiting from it.

The main character played by Christian Bale is Michael Burry, a former physician turned hedge fund manager who discovers that the US housing market is unstable due to risky sub-prime loans. He becomes convinced that the financial crisis is unavoidable and creates a ""credit default swap market,"" convincing various banks to accept his ""bets"" that the housing market will collapse. The banks, convinced that the market is stable, gladly accept his investments on behalf of the investors in his hedge fund.

We find out a little about Burry's backgroundthat he lost an eye as a child. suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, and was always a maverick who didn't fit the typical profile of a hedge fund manager. McKay establishes a conflict between Burry and his jittery investors, who stand to lose millions, if his prediction does not come to fruition. How Burry copes with the pressure is where the comedy comes in although it's certainly not laugh out loud funny. And it's also quite interesting how Burry ultimately prevents all his investors from panicking and cashing in all their chipshe does this by creating a moratorium on all withdrawals, right before the big economic collapse!

When trader Jared Vennett of Deustche Bank (Ryan Gosling) hears about Burry's credit default swap market, he decides to get in on the action too. Vennett's wrong number phone call alerts our other protagonist, Mark Baum, another quirky, curmudgeonly hedge fund manager adroitly played by Steve Carrell. Baum and Vennett join forces and Baum begins to investigate the depth of the problem with the US Housing market. Baum is a sensitive guy who was deeply affected by his brother who committed suicide. He discovers that collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) are loan packages bundled together and given AAA ratings by unscrupulous rating agencies. McKay wisely takes us out of the finance board rooms and has his principals attend a big housing forum in Las Vegas where Baum in particular meets a fat cat businessman who has profited greatly by creating synthetic CDOs. Baum ultimately convinces his business associates to adopt Burry's stratagem.

Also in the mix are small-time, young investors Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) who learn of the swap market and then must conscript a retired banker, Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), to get them in the game. Rickert, now a new age type (and one who has a conscience like Baum), castigates Geller and Shipley for celebrating over impending profits, at the expense of the millions of people who will lose their jobs and income due to the financial collapse. Geller and Shipley try to atone for their selfish attitude by attempting to alert the press about the impending collapse, but to no avail.

McKay may see the protagonists here as heroes merely for their foresight into what is to come, and for bearing witness to the fraud they uncovered. Nonetheless, despite their guilty conscience, they ended up profiting from other peoples' misery. Despite their foresight, they're really nothing more than vultures feeding on the carcasses of the millions wiped out in the financial downturn. But it's really the entire financial industry as well as the US government whom McKay is indicting herea corrupt system that allowed swindlers to convince low-income people to live beyond their means and obtain mortgages that they couldn't possibly pay off.

In the end it's the film's educational value that makes it worthwhile. The 2007-2008 financial collapse is a topic that is difficult to understand. McKay has his characters explain the financial jargon and even brings in celebrities such as Selena Gomez to explain arcane terms that pop up in the narrative. While some of the characters' machinations become somewhat repetitious, I still was able to learn quite a bit about a topic that isn't ordinarily so easy to grasp.",1452729600,4,4216,5.091172214182344

For a change, a film where you can sense real emotion - anger, incredulity, determination but self-irony as well. The film does not pull punches yet at the time it came out it became true that not one banking bigwig paid a price for the massive fraud commited against the American people. Paulson and  Geithner bailed the miscreants out, with taxpayer money...  perhaps not all too surprisingly, they now have cushy jobs in private equity. The brazeness and entitlement of these people is out of this world. Remember AIGs Greenberg ( the guy who almost destroyed this economy?) - he has been suing, demanding $billions from the Administration for its audacity to save his company and demand a fraction  (worth exactly $0 at the time ) in recompense?

The root cause - people at the source of the money - the Fed, Treasury, the SEC, Goldman, JPM et al. - bankers, traders, gvmnt officials... constitute a cabal whose primary interest is in preserving itself. The problem here is that easy access to (easy) money is too much of an inducement to keep a primate honest. We  primates  were not designed this way. The only way of eliminating systemic risks is to remove the incentive to cheat and lie - take away those bonuses and exorbitant and undeserved pay. Why should people be paid to speculate?!

7497518,4,B0177ZM3MI,"Part of the challenge of presenting this kind of material which is quite complex at its core is that the audience needs to understand certain elements to fully grasp the story. The core of the narrative of ""The Big Short"" is how a few people in finance ""bet"" against the conventional wisdom that property values would never fall and as a result made $100 million's during the Financial Crisis of 2008. The film attempts to accomplish four things.

1. Define the terminology used by Wall Street and Finance regarding the buying and selling of mortgages, such as ""sub-prime mortgage"", ""CDO"", and ""tranches"". 2. Explain the housing situation prior to Fall of 2008, in particular how sub-prime mortgages became, for a brief time, a means for Wall Street banks and investors to make huge profits. 3. Introduce us to some unlikely Wall Street insiders who saw the flaw in the conventional logic and a means to make a financial killing at the expense of the market. 4. How they were able to convince Wall Street to take their bets against the housing market. Even after having read and seen documentaries about the crisis, I do believe this is still not easy stuff fully understand.

The solution in ""The Big Short"" was largely solved by narrator Ryan Gosling as Jared Vennett who chronicles the history of the mortgage-finance sub-prime mortgage world while introducing us to the different characters involved who ""bet"" against the housing market. However, several times the story stops, and interspersed animation or a celebrity detail certain points. For example, Margot Robbie explains what sub-prime mortgages are in a bubble bath, and Anthony Bourdain describes ""CDO's"" using bad fish as an analogy. Also, they give some of the history of the characters involved, which for some reason I felt was less interesting. This occurs for about the first third of the film, which I found a bit irritating. I think I would have preferred the characters of the story explain these terms, such as Gosling does, as part of the narrative rather than stopping the show and bringing the focus on someone else. And I would have largely left out the histories of the characters, except as it relates to their interests in finance. Also, just about every time Michael Burry (Christian Bale) enters a scene, we hear endless heavy metal music.

After the terminology is defined and the characters' histories are out of the way, the story starts to finally move along. Michael Burry (Bale) was one of the earliest financial wizards to realize the housing market was essentially a lie. Billions of dollars were being invested into sub-prime mortgages, housing loans given to people who more often than not, could never pay them back. Mortgage agencies were able to sign sub-prime housing loans and re-sell them to Wall Street who would in turn sell them as tranches to investors.

Burry decides to bet against the housing bubble using the capital in his hedge-fund. He convinces banks to take his ""negative"" investment, and they agree to take millions of dollars, believing they've made easy money. They invest in so-called ""credit default swaps"", a kind of loan insurance. If a loan defaults, the holder of the swap makes the equivalent of the loan in return as long he paid a premium beforehand. So if Burry invests say $50 million in default swaps, he could potentially make $100 millions if the loans ever default, which they did. Part of the story is how Burry's investment strategy in the default swaps proliferates to other Wall Street insiders. The major characters portrayed follow Burry's suit lead, including Mark Baum (Steve Carell), Jared Vennet (Gosling), and eventually Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt).

Overall enjoyable, probably a ""one-watch"" (my term for a single viewing). Once the story kicks in, the film gets better and more compelling as it goes along. For its intentions, it does a reasonably good job of explaining the complexity of the Housing Market Crisis. By mid-way, a lot of the emotion becomes part of the story, and I found those aspects more compelling than Robbie in her bubble bath. Don't misunderstand me, I like Robbie in the bubble bath, but maybe that scene is for an entirely different film.",1452124800,,4202,4.937765205091938

This movie explain it to us like 2 year old. Basically its about disturbing look at how wall street gamble on the housing market making people believe they can afford mortgage payments on a house they can't afford and as a result the people who gamble against the economy were the winners but in the moral sense some felt guilty knowing that economy is at its worst and at the end people lost their homes and even their lives as we seen in the news where people have killed enitre families because they can't support their families financial needs. While others in the movie didn't care at all as long as they got their bonuses for helping their companies get rich. As ryan g.

7497521,4,B0177ZM3MI,"Paris -- Michael Lewis is the chronicler of Wall Street.  He takes the complexity behind which the inhabitants of the financial world hide and weaves a tale that is both understandable and compelling.  Starting with the classic Liars Poker (1989), Lewis has produced a number of books about the financial markets including Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt (2014) and The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine (2010).  Working with director Adam McKay and some great actors and screen writers, Lewis has managed to produce what is perhaps the most accessible and relevant treatment of the mortgage boom and financial bust of the 2000s, and the subsequent 2008 financial crisis.

The beauty of The Big Short, both as a movie and a book, is that it provides sufficient detail to inform the general audience about events and issues that are not part of everyday life.  Wall Street is a secretive place, but The Big Short manages to convey enough of the details to make the story credible as a journalistic effort, yet also enormously entertaining.  Lewis does this with two essential ingredients of any film: a simple story and compelling characters.

Images of greed and stupidity are presented like Italian frescos in The Big Short, pictures that are memorable and thought provoking.  Indeed, what many people know and remember years from now about the 2008 financial crisis will be shaped by creative efforts such as The Big Short for the simple reason that Lewis has simplified the description into a manageable portion.  Unlike hedge fund manager Michael Burry (played by Christian Bale), most people lack the patience and expertise to sift through and understand reams of financial data.

Fund manager Michael Baum (played by Steve Carrel) is likewise a perfect caricature of the Wall Street loner, the contrarian personality who looks for situations where everyone in the crowd is headed in one direction  a sure sign that they are wrong.  Baums willingness to take on the big banks  including the firm that sponsored his hedge fund  illustrates how difficult it is for a contrarian to prevail when all of the mega institutions on Wall Street are betting against you.  Then we have the delicious irony of banker and narrator Jared Vennett (played with evil delight by Ryan Gosling) betting against his own firm by facilitating short sales of toxic derivative mortgage securities.

The Big Short has rightly earned the acclaim of audiences and critics for presenting the sometimes seamy world of finance in a way that a broad audience can understand with relative ease.  As with any narrative of past events, the story must be simplified and summarized to make it manageable, either as a book or even more so as a film.  But heres the rub: in order to tell the story, Lewis had to employ people and personalities to make his description accessible.  By doing so, he conveys to the audience only part of the story, emphasizing the role of people and leaving by the wayside the other, equally important and largely opaque institutional and legal aspects of the financial markets that enable fraud and skullduggery.

For example, just why was it that firms like my old employer Bear, Stearns & Co, Lehman Brothers, Wachovia, Countrywide and others were originating sub-prime mortgages and selling securities based on this toxic waste? Did the employees and officers of these second tier firms just decide one morning to focus on the most problematic credits in the residential mortgage market at a time when every agency in Washington was encouraging home ownership and the Fed had cut interest rates to historical lows?  Stoking the mortgage boom via cheap credit, never forget, was a deliberate policy choice by the Housing Industrial Complex and the Federal Open Market Committee, a process accelerated following the shock of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

In fact, the reason why these smaller financial firms became the mud-sucking bottom feeders of the world of mortgage finance was because the top four mega banks and their partners at the federal housing agencies in Washington the GSEs) had monopolized the prime mortgage market, both for loan originations and sales of government guaranteed mortgage bonds.  The big banks dominated the short-term funding market that piped liquidity to the likes of Countrywide, Washington Mutual and New Century Financial, none of which had sufficiently stable bases of liquidity to support their huge lending volumes. The housing GSEs, meanwhile, dominated the long end of the bond market, issuing securities at yields far below that possible for any bank or non-banks, large or small.

As the mortgage market crazed neared its peak in 2004-2005, the period when the anti-heroes of The Big Short began to realize that something was seriously amiss, the GSEs and big banks began to acquire exposures in sub-prime mortgages.  Indeed, the top banks by then had started to compete aggressively with the GSEs, pushing the market share of these three government agencies below 50% so that they could issue private mortgage bonds and derivatives at even bigger profits.  Today the housing GSEs account for virtually all mortgage lending in the US and the largest banks are actually exiting the market for making residential loans.

Government policy and the fact of the big bank-GSE monopoly in the market for prime mortgage loans drove the housing crisis as much or more that the stupidity and greed so skillfully portrayed in The Big Short. Because such details are the eye-glazing stuff of documentaries, not popular feature films created to drive Hollywood profits, Lewis could tell us only part of the story.  Part of the artistry of Lewis is that he understands that in the 21st Century, every successful book must be written as a potential movie script.

The same shortcoming affected the fascinating Lewis book Flash Boys, which tells a story of smart traders and computers giving the big Wall Street trading firms an advantage over small investors.  In fact, the advantage enjoyed by the big program trading firms is embedded in the myriad of complex order types of the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ  all of which are public and available to anybody with the knowledge to use them in their investment strategies.  But only a handful of traders and institutional investors have that knowledge.  Again, complexity, not just greed and avarice, are the drivers of financial contagion.

Another wonderful aspect of The Big Short is the way in which McKay explains the world of derivatives and complex financial instruments like the nefarious credit default swap or CDS using a casino as the foil.  CDS allows the characters in the story to bet against the subprime mortgage market.  Unlike a short sale of a stock or bond, though, a CDS truly is a gaming instrument that allows a speculator to sell something they don't own and cannot borrow to deliver against the short sale.  Recalling the wisdom of Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis almost a century ago, an incomplete sale imputes fraud conclusively.  (Read our November 24, 2015 KBRA research note, Can the Credit Default Swap Market be Salvaged?, if you want to learn more about these dubious financial contracts.)

The casino scene in The Big Short exquisitely illustrates the way in which credit derivatives allow speculators to wager against different types of assets (and one another) without having to actually complete the sale as, say, with a short position in stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  All of the concerns with credit derivatives ultimately start with the simple fact that buying a CDS when one does not own or borrow the underlying bond is akin to ""naked shorting"" of stocks.  Sure, the short-sellers in the world of CDS must pay extortionate fees to their bookie to maintain their best over time, but a credit derivative allows speculators to create a short position that does not exist in the cash market and without any connection to the underlying basis for the trade.

What neither the book nor the film get around to telling us in full is that Washingtons embrace of gaming instruments like CDS not only helped the characters in the story bet against subprime mortgages, but also enormously amplified the scope of the 2008 financial crisis. By institutionalizing the use of CDS as an acceptable part of the world of investing, Washington made the mortgage boom and bust possible and far worse than a mere financial bubble in housing.  You get a hint of this near the end of the film when Carrel meets with his sponsor at Morgan Stanley and discovers that the firm has $14 billion in exposure to subprime debt via derivatives.  CDS allows the creation of massive risk that would otherwise not exist.

If Michael Lewis ever gets around to making a sequel to The Big Short, he should tell the story of how Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX), Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, and many others, conspired to attack and discredit Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Brooksley Born in order to make the world safe for credit derivatives and the big banks that traffic in them.  This badly misguided action by these senior government officials make the acts of greed and stupidity so beautifully portrayed in The Big Short pale by comparison.  As we noted in the KBRA research note on CDS:

[A]gencies such as the Federal Reserve Board in Washington have for decades publicly advocated the growth of OTC derivatives as activities that are appropriate for banks. When several large, internationally active banks began to expand into OTC securities and derivatives, and lobby in Washington for even greater powers and exemptions, the Fed Board and other regulatory agencies were either caught unaware or actively supported the expansion of the OTC market for subprime debt and derivatives.

Sure, mortgage brokers making liar loans in FL were partly to blame for the mortgage crisis of the 2000s, but as my friends Josh Rosner and Gretchen Morgenson documented so well in the 2012 book Reckless Endangerment: How Outsized Ambition, Greed, and Corruption Created the Worst Financial Crisis of Our Time, Wall Street certainly must share the credit for this catastrophe with a generation of policy makers in Washington.  The monopoly position of the big banks and GSEs, combined with the infinite leverage of unregulated credit derivatives, are equal factors in the story.

Dont get me wrong, Michael Lewis is a fabulous writer and author, and The Big Short is a great book and an even better movie.  We owe Lewis, McKay and everyone involved with this film a debt of gratitude for telling at least part of the story of the financial crisis and telling it so well.  Indeed, as my new wife Nicole and I walked around Paris over Christmas, we saw lines of people waiting to see The Big Short, an appropriate scene given the role of some of the largest French banks in creating complex derivatives based upon American subprime mortgage debt.

If my vote counts, The Big Short deserves a lot of awards for both the acting and the directing of a very complex story.  But never forget that derivatives like credit default swaps are the fuel that turned a mere bubble in the US housing market into a global financial meltdown, the effects of which are still being felt eight years later.

7497523,5,B0177ZM3MI,"Directed by Adam McKay (The Other Guys, Anchorman) from a screenplay by Charles Randolph (The Interpreter) and McKay based on the book The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine by Michael Lewis, The Big Short is a film that is truly worth catching for anyone who wants to understand what led to the collapse of the US housing market in 2007 and the subsequent global financial meltdown that followed. It focuses on a handful of disparate characters who, for various reasons, were the only ones who saw it coming and knew what it meant, but also saw it as an opportunity to make a _lot_ of money.

I don't want to say too much about the plot because a lot of what makes the film work is how it lays everything out, introducing the various characters who were the ones who saw what was happening, showing what they saw and then explaining what it meant, frequently with hilarious bits of narrative exposition and commentary done with a mix of authorities like economist Richard Thayler and highly unexpected cameos from celebrities like Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez and Anthony Bourdain.  There is a lot of serious stuff laid out in The Big Short, but McKay leavens it with a fair amount of humor without ever losing sight of just how high the stakes were and how devastating the consequences would be, not for the parties responsible but for millions of ordinary Americans who ended up buried in the fallout.

It has a highly talented cast, many of whom give standout performances likely to garner them nominations at Academy Award time.  Christian Bale (American Hustle, The Fighter) is Michael Burry, the eccentric hedge fund manager who in 2005 began looking into financial instruments that consisted of bundles of mortgages and was the first to realize that a huge percentage of the underlying mortgages were actually sub-prime mortgages with increasing levels of default.  And who realizes that this is an opportunity to make a major bet against the housing market, something consider lunacy by virtually everyone else at the time.  Ryan Gosling (Drive, Half-Nelson) is Jared Vennett, an investor who gets wind of Burry's investigations and decides that Burry is right and starts his own drive to take advantage of the situation. Steve Carrell (Foxcatcher, The Way Way Back) is a complete scene stealer as over the top in-your-face market trader Mark Baum who accidentally learns about Vennett is doing and becomes curious, to the point of actually sending his team to look at the actual properties and people involved at the most basic level of these sub-prime mortgages. And last but not least, Brad Pitt (Moneyball, 12 Years a Slave) is quietly effective as retired banker Ben Rickert who gets involved and ends up reminding his associates (and the audience) that there are real-life consequences to what we're seeing and that a lot of people are going to be hurt when doomsday finally arrives and the bubble they're all betting against finally bursts.

Highly recommended not only for the fine performances and sharp-edged humor but also for its surprising ability to show what led up to the housing and mortgage market collapse of 2007 and the subsequent global financial meltdown.  And how much of it was due to greed, stupidity and out and out fraud and collusion.  And how, in the end, nothing was fixed.",1451606400,65,3316,4.8861209964412815

The first hurdle was that there was no mechanism to buy a short or swap against the real estate market. Michael Burry had to negotiate them and the investment companies were happy to take his money and party with it as bonds are never down graded.

The film had a number of asides and documentary style interjections. It took the complex task of explaining market terms by using stars and metaphors. For instance Selena Gomez explains synthetic CDOs at a blackjack table, something that even investors didn't know existed, or at least the film portrayed it that way.

Now the folks who made millions on the collapse of the world economy didn't celebrate on screen. They felt bad winning by betting against the little guy who ultimately had to pay with his job and home.

The film feels partially like a documentary. When something didn't really happen ""that way"" they did an aside to let you know it is a dramatization. And sometimes they did an aside to let you know it really did happen. This film is told from a different point of view then the other films out there, told from the viewpoint of the investment companies.

It was hard not to love the bold character of Steve Carell.

7497537,4,B0177ZM3MI,"Whod a thunk it? Adam McKay, probably best known for the Anchorman movies, along with Step Brothers, gets a little more serious with his film about the Wall Street shenanigans surrounding the financial collapse in 2008. Maybe serious is the wrong word. Pissed is more like it. And after you see this film, you most certainly will be too.

A small group of financial investors, unknown to each other at the time, come to the conclusion that the booming real estate market will soon collapse. The rationale is that many mortgage loans were made to individuals who weren't credit worthy and who were lured by teaser (very low) adjustable rate mortgages. The risk to the originators was minimal as there was a secondary market that bought the loans, bundled into large bonds.

The earliest outliers are Michael Burry (Christian Bale) and Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), operators who have different styles and different means of accessing investment capital. Burry, a medical doctor who manages his portfolio barefoot and listening to heavy metal, is backed by a larger financial institution but has autonomy when it comes to what he invests in. He decides to put everything into a new form of security which is more complicated than just shorting a stock. Vennett, who like Burry, is a bit of a brilliant oddball, needs investors to help him accomplish the same thing. Essentially creating an insurance product that will protect them if the big banks (who own the bundled loans) lose their shirts if the loans fail.

If this sounds complicated, it is. But McKay, who also wrote the screenplay with Charles Randolph based on Michael Lewiss book, provides some funny talk-to-the-camera cameos by celebrities who don't come to mind when you think about Wall Street investing vehicles. They explain things in relatively simple terms.

Much of the film focuses on a small group of investors led by Mark Baum (Steve Carell). They are being courted by Vennett. Baum and his team actually do some field work to see what is happening to people being caught in a credit squeeze complicated by rising unemployment. The results are history and those who saw it coming were able to profit. Most, especially Baum, are uncomfortable with their winnings but the point is made.

The film is not without the obvious serious undertones, but McKay handles the crisis with a deft hand. Everyone in the film is terrific but most noticeable is Carell, who Im guessing is the character, McKay is most comfortable with. Baum is obnoxious, unlikeable and confrontational. But hes also concerned and dumbfounded by the ignorance of the big Wall Street investment firms, the credit rating agencies and the lack of oversight by the government. Me too. Excellent film.",1451174400,17,2733,4.984649122807017

7497540,5,B0177ZM3MI,"I went to see the movie the The Big Short on Christmas Day and it has become my new favorite trading movie.

The movie is funny and entertaining, while telling a good story. It details three hedge funds that made the right trade at the right time to capture huge profits as the mortgage bond market imploded under defaults. The movie theater was full, but I was often the only one laughing out loud at many of the jokes, because only traders would understand. The movie did take the time to explain credit default swaps and CDOs for the general audience in funny and creative ways, including guest appearances by Selena Gomez explaining how bets on mortgage bond defaults worked. Brad Pitt did a great job convincing me he was an ex-trader, and Steve Carell did a fantastic job playing the worlds angriest hedge fund manager. This was in the league of  Money Ball, and one of the few movies I can watch more than once. This movie was made for traders.

15 Trading Lessons from the The Big Short

  Its possible to be right about a market move, but your timing can be too early.
  If you trade too big, you can lose all your capital before you have the time to be proven right.
  AAA agency ratings are more to make their clients who sell bonds happy than to protect investors.
  In markets that are not liquid, you can get in trouble by being right but your assets not reflecting it with a big move.
  When there is no risk of ruin to bankers and mortgage brokers they will risk the ruin of their companies and the world economy in pursuit of quick and easy money.
  When there is little skin in the game bankers and mortgage brokers take risks that they are not held accountable for.
  Macro traders have to be able to take a lot of heat and losses on their positions before they are right.
  Hedge fund investors want consistent returns on their money and not drawdowns. They are quick to pull their money out during a losing streak.
  You want to have a large risk/reward ratio on your trades. Betting $1 for a chance to make $20 is a good trade.
  There is a lot of fraud in the financial world.
  Financial fraud is almost never prosecuted in the banking world.
  The SEC has little oversight in the banking industry.
  Bailouts can cause you to lose on a trade you would have made money on.
  You have to take your profits off the table while they are available.
  Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.  Mark Twain",1451088000,31,2471,4.379690949227373

At times so complicated that famous people appear (one is in a bath tub) to aspire to explain as simply as possible what all is going on. Characters occasionally talk to the camera. With these devices it is an insightful ride as the characters follow a road that they do not know where it will lead. Some bare skin at a club, a significant amount of swearing.

This is a MUST see. Fast paced, serious subject matter, clever humor in just the right spots leaves you on the edge of your seat for two hours . I live here in Florida and watched these bankers build to a demographic that does not exist and take our country into this horrific financial mess. I heard the stories from a friend who lives in Vegas when 2 days after these schmucks (Leahman) received TARP money and celebrated with a cocaine and prostitue party with tax payer funds.

7497543,4,B0177ZM3MI,"Nine Things About the Film ""The Big Short""

1. This movie is based on the book of the same name, and is about the almost impossible levels of corruption and stupidity that caused the world-crippling financial crisis from 2007-2010.

2. The movie is funny, fascinating, and deeply depressing. If you're not cynical about the world yet, you will be after this movie.

3. The story follows a few different groups of people around 2005 who stumble onto signs that big investment banks are selling bonds made of home mortgages that were trash. They decide to bet that the bonds would eventually fail, which would make them rich.

4. It's a complicated subject that involves a lot of moving parts, distant connections, and economic black magic. The movie does a really good job of explaining the main parts of what happened, and makes things more understandable to regular people. But if you want to know the details of what happened and why, you will either need to already be an expert on the situation, or else do additional research on your own.

5. One of the themes of the movie is that regular people had no idea what was going to happen because they were too distracted by other things and weren't paying attention to their own circumstances. This theme is illustrated by periodic montages of pop culture and media that interrupt the flow of the ever-deepening sense of dread building up in the main story.

6. The cast is a great mix of unknown actors as well as well-known ones. Christian Bale is amazing once again, playing a socially awkward investment manager that trusts his math over other peoples' advice. Ryan Gosling plays another version of most of his characters, but he's good at it, so that's fine. And Steve Carell continues to show that he is not just a great comedian, but one of the best actors today.

7. The movie was co-written and directed by Adam McKay, who directed ""Anchorman"", ""Talladega Nights"", and ""Step Brothers"". It's pretty obvious that he has a working partnership with Will Ferrell. ""The Big Short"" is his first real shot at making a more dramatic movie - and it's the first movie he directed that didn't star Will Ferrell. McKay does an excellent job here, finding humor in a situation that really isn't very funny.

8. The film has a unique visual and narrative style - the camera kind of freewheels through situations and time periods, making the whole thing very kinetic. The characters often break the fourth wall and talk directly to the audience; sometimes they tell us whether a scene really happened or was made up for the movie.

9. This is a smart movie that requires a lot of concentration. But the talented cast and the careful script make it easier to follow. This is a socially important movie if you want to keep informed about what's really going on around you. Just remember, this is a true story, and you already know that there is no happy ending.",1451001600,451,2903,4.68762278978389
