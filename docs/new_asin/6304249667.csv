7865792,3,6304249667,"The preceding rave reviews of this obscure movie convinced us to buy the video. The movie is well-meaning, inoffensive, and filled with positive messages of hope and courage and ultimate triumph against all odds.

Its target audience was clearly a young one, and mature viewers like ourselves will likely find it a trifle tedious. Kudos for having its heart in the right place.",1155600000,2,461,5.078947368421052
