I really loved the characters, the indigenous girl from oaxaca who has to deal with racism and discrimination. The girl from juarez who is exploited in a maquiladora, lives in a shanty town, and is seeing her female co workers and friends disappear then found dead and the authorities don't care. The tranny from mexico city, who wants to be a star and loved and accepted as woman, also her family is hilarious. The spoiled rich girl from jalisco, struggling with her weight problems, obssesed with being thin and perfect. I loved them all. I strongly recommend this movie.",1304899200,,707,4.7560975609756095

3712760,4,B001NDM3Y4,"In ""Casi Divas"" (""Almost Divas"" ""Road to Fame"") (2009) Eva is a real diva, a star, whom her producer/lover, Alejandro, wants to replace with a younger woman. Over Eva's dead body! Hundreds of young women in this Mexican, Spanish-language film vie in a contest to be the star of the producer's next blockbuster.
 Eva does everything including devious things to blackmail Alejandro into keeping her as his leading diva and his lover. She's a force to be reckoned with.
 The movie concentrates on four young women, different types from different backgrounds. One comes from an upper class family, one from a gaggle of misfits, one Francisca (Maya Zapata) from a poor family in Oaxaca with Indian roots. The fourth is a factory worker from Juarez. The rivalry among the girls becomes fierce. A national TV show is used to run the contest, and viewers vote for their choices.
 A sub-plot concerns a serial killer who is stalking and killing young women. This only seems to hit home at the end of the film.
 The movie at times seems like a soap opera, has some social commentary, and has a real surprise. When the contest is going on, you may feel as if you have traveled this road before.",1258243200,,1183,4.673076923076923

3712762,5,B001NDM3Y4,"I saw this film in the theatre and LOVED it!! It looks like a comedy (and much of it is), but it is so much more.

8323648,4,B001NDM3Y4,"I enjoyed this movie. It was different than I expected. I had hoped to use it with my 8th grade heritage Spanish speakers, but there is A LOT of swearing (which is a hard thing in Spanish, because what one family considers swearing, another may not). There is also a transgender contestant - whereas I liked the element that brought to the movie (a bit deeper than it might have been otherwise), I don't know if my students are ready for this. Which is a shame because I do love how we learn a little bit about 4 different states of Mexico and see not only poverty but also a very rich girl.",1399939200,,591,4.238938053097345

8323651,4,B001NDM3Y4,"A wonderful, vibrant, funny, and touching film from Mexico, about the search for a new star when one of Mexico's most popular telenovelas (soap opera) decides to recast the female lead in a film version of the insanely popular series. A handful of girls from various parts - and various social/class backgrounds - of Mexico vie for the role ... and the film, while very funny, also touches on some of deeper issues that are a part of life in Mexico today. Loved it!",1357257600,,465,4.5476190476190474
