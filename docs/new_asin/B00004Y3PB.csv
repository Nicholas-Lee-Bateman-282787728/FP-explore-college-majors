1370638,5,B00004Y3PB,"Simply put, this is a fantastic DVD.  I had read the reviews which said the video quality suffered, there were not enough ""gimmicks"" and such....forget them all.  I plugged this into my 42"" plasma and surround sound and was transported back to the night of the concert.  The surround sound alone should be a reason to buy this.  You are there in the crowd, people clapping and yelling all around you as the concert goes on...fantastic.  The bass was deep, the high's crystal clear and the video great. All members of the band are extremely talented, and it shows through their interpreting their studio albums into live music.  I have been a drummer for many years and have to say Caroline may not be the flashiest drummers around, but she can drive the beat and plays everything with taste, not overdone.  Also, she beats a mean Bodrhan, you have to respect her abilities for that alone.",1125100800,9,888,4.653846153846154
1370639,5,B00004Y3PB,"Absolutely fantastic!!!  Overall great performance.  If you only were to buy one of The Corrs videos this would be the one.  Totally amazing to see them perform in front of 50,000+ fans.  The only complaint (if one could call it that) is that they do not highlight Caroline enough.  I have to admit she is my favorite of the group and it is totally delightful to watch beating on those drums with all that energy of hers and her drop dead smile !!!!",1123804800,4,449,4.36144578313253
1370640,5,B00004Y3PB,"As a long-time fan of The Corrs and owner of all of their DVDs (including ""Live In London"", ""Live At Royal Albert Hall"" and ""Unplugged""), I must agree with previous reviewers that this is the creme de la creme of the set (and all of them are excellent).  What sets this one apart is the energy level and emotions brought out by the homecoming Dublin crowd.  Clearly, this was more than just another concert for The Corrs.  And though I wish the set had included a couple more covers interspersed with their popular hits (as I really get a kick out of their concert very unique covers of hits such as Little Wing, Everybody Hurts, Ruby Tuesday, Summer Wine, et. al), the group was in top form here.  Highlights include the previously mentioned ""Runaway"", Sharon and Caroline's beautiful duet ""No Frontiers"" (performed with much more emotion than on the Unplugged DVD), a rare performance (and hard rocking, at that, at least for them) of ""Secret Life"", and an extended version of the traditional ""lough Erin Shore"".  I only wish the VH1 Live From Dublin performance would come out on DVD.",1109376000,7,1087,4.7
1370641,5,B00004Y3PB,"If you are looking here for Corrs DVD's then you likely already are a fan of the Corrs.  Your question is most likely ""Which concert DVD should I get?""  As a Corrs fan who has Lansdowne Road, Live in London, and Royal Albert Hall, I'd say this one is by far the best.  Why? A few reasons.  First, it captures the group at their peak, just as they are finishing their concert tour from their second album.  After Talk on Corners, their sound became more generic. Second, the Corrs are having a homecoming celebration, and it shows.  The home town crowds enthusiasm clearly has an effect on the band, and they seem to enjoy doing this concert more than any of the others. They look like they are really be having a good time playing this show(and who wouldn't in their shoes) Watching Andrea being brought to tears as the audience sings Runaway is one of the coolest concert moments I've seen anywhere, ever. That song alone is worth the price of admission. The other DVD's are good shows, but this one is great. Also, the setting and videography for this concert I prefer to the others.  The stadium at sunset is gorgeous, and a perfect backdrop to the concert.  The audience is having a blast.  You'll wish you were there. The sound for Albert Hall is better, but the lighting there makes them all look pasty white.  The London DVD features more ""gimicks"" and probably better video quality, but Landsdowne is just a better show...and therefore is the most enjoyable to watch.  I like all three concerts a lot, but Lansdowne is the one I keep playing.",1098144000,52,1550,4.539568345323741
1370642,5,B00004Y3PB,"I just watched this AWESOME DVD for the 1st time and it BLEW ME AWAY! The Corrs are the BEST!!!! However, my DVD didn't include a Booklet. Did anyone else get a Booklet with their DVD? Or does ""Live at Lansdowne Road"" not include a Booklet? Please post and let me know, thanks!",1095984000,2,277,4.245283018867925
1370643,5,B00004Y3PB,"The Corrs need no gimmicks to sell their music. Over 40,000 people lined up in Dublin to see this fantastic, talented band perform some of their best songs, ""runaway,"" ""forgiven not forgotten,"" and ""so young."" Their traditional pieces, ""haste to the wedding,"" and ""joy of life"" are real treats and brilliant as well. This is an enjoyable, refreshing dvd to watch and listen to. The Corrs do not use foul language in their music. They don't write explicit lyrics about sex. And the singer, Andrea Corr, is not running around barely clothed half the time. This is a band that is based on pure talent, something the music industry (particulary the American music scene) is lacking these days. Buy this dvd and see for yourself, a band unlike no other that is probably the best in the world right now.

LONG LIVE THE CORRS!",1095811200,18,819,4.6875
1370644,5,B00004Y3PB,"The Irish love the Corrs because they combine tradition with new.

The Corrs have done it again.  They're not just a bunch of Paddy's working for the railroad.",1095552000,3,159,4.642857142857143
1370645,5,B00004Y3PB,"Agree with everything Toronto said and more. My eyes got a little damp as well, watching Andrea's reaction to the audience singing on Runaway. For Andrea, that has to be the memory of a lifetime. What an affirmation of your talents. The duet with Sharon and Caroline was very special. Had not heard either of their voices in solo before. Sharon bowled me over. This talents of this group runneth over with each of them possessing so many that it boggles the mind. I've been hungering for this and the Unplugged DVD for so long that I almost couldn't believe it when I read that they would finally be available with region one encoding. Wonder how much was lost in sales and publicity over the years because these two DVD's weren't availble for the North American market. The Unplugged DVD is enroute and I can hardly wait to watch Andrea sing Little Wing and Everybody Hurts.",1092528000,6,875,4.615384615384615
1370646,5,B00004Y3PB,"The VHS cassette is hands-down one of the two or three best concert videos ever made. There's no reason to think the DVD will be anything less.

The band was at its peak. The direction, lighting, and sound are superb. The camera work, in particular, is close to ideal. The hometown crowd is delirious. The Corrs are clearly touched by their devotion and motivated to skyrocket.

In short, I cannot praise this video enough. It's right up there with Simon & Garfunkel At Central Park, the Stones rendition of Brown Sugar at Madison Square Garden broadcast on Dick Cavett in 1972, and The Beatles' promo video for Revolution. The Corrs Live at Landsdowne Road is that electric.",1091059200,6,675,4.760683760683761
1370689,5,B00004Y3PB,"This is the best Corrs concert dvd. Great sound, home audience, band at the top of their form make this concert tops.",1243036800,,117,4.363636363636363
1370690,4,B00004Y3PB,"The video quality of this dvd is just fair. I felt like I was watching it with VHS. But the show sounded really good with the stadium reverb and all that. It's the best video to see the pretty Corrs. They look younger there. Yea..it was quite some time already. So if you want the best looking of the Corrs either get this or the Live in London.

They basically performed 95% of the songs they made back then (talk on corner and forgiven not forgotten). The fans were dancing when instrumentals were being played. It was a joy to watch.

This dvd comes with some bonus videos like breathless MV and 2 other performances @ Fleadh 2000.

At last, the show was great. It's not an ordinary concert that you'd expect from a pop group. With some jamming breaks going on when Andrea was introducing the band and some memorable guitar solos from Anto.",1202515200,,843,4.425806451612903
1370691,4,B00004Y3PB,"I own Live at The Royal Albert Hall as well as Live at Lansdowne Road.  The Royal Albert Hall DVD is superior, in my opinion.  The main differences between the two are the sound quality and the atmosphere.  Live at The Royal Albert Hall has excellent sound quality and great sound mixing too.  It was recorded in a more intimate atmosphere and doesn't have the echoing reverberations that the Landsdowne Road show has.  Lansdowne suffers from poor audio--it sounds like you're standing at the back of the stadium.  The mixing is also bad with non-existent percussion.  The direction is also a bit frenetic for my taste.

However, Lansdowne Road still has a lot going for it.  Among the DVD highlights are, No Frontiers with Sharon and Caroline on vocals, a rocking version of So Young, great subtitles with both captions and lyrics, nice bonus features and, I might add, Sharon looks like a billion dollars on this night.

I recommend this DVD but Live at The Royal Albert Hall is my favourite.",1199059200,,994,4.726744186046512

Even though Amazon lists the Region Code as ""1"" (U.S. and Canada only) the DVD I received was in a PAL format which does not play on my machine.  Unfortunately, I had already opended the DVD before I realized it wouldn't play.  So, when Amazon describes this offering as a region 1 -- DO NOT BELIEVE THEM !!!",1191196800,2,340,4.451612903225806
1370693,4,B00004Y3PB,"I was torn between 4 and 5 stars. The concert itself is wonderful, but the first time I watched it, I was very disappointed in the resolution. I don't know if that was intentional, but I would like to see one of their concerts in HD.",1173312000,2,233,4.086956521739131
1370694,5,B00004Y3PB,I bought this in October. At the time it WAS NOT LABELED region 2. No hacks are available for my DVD players so I am limited to playing this on the pc. First saw this concert on PPV on Direct TV. It is the best.,1168473600,,211,3.7111111111111112
1370695,5,B00004Y3PB,"It doesn't matter if this is dated material, this is a Corrs Classic.  Of all The Corrs DVDs, this is the best one.  If you had to choose just one, this is THE ONE.

I don't judge concert DVDs by their video quality or fancy sound, I judge them by performance, and the performance at this concert is superb.  The interaction of the group with the audience is wonderful as is the interaction between the siblings (you can actually tell this family loves each other).

This DVD is highly recommended, whether you are a hardcore fan of The Corrs or just you're here because your friend/relative is constantly telling you how great they are and you are starting to give in (resistance is futile)....",1143417600,4,695,4.57258064516129
1370696,4,B00004Y3PB,"Even though this is dated material, the CORRS, in their prime, are a unique and entertaining band. Talented and fun-loving, they have music that ""hooks you"".  Almost every song is sing-a-long-able, (new word I created). The special features, also, help educate their fans or fans-to-be about their style and inspiration. But, the music needs no introduction. It is deep, for pop, and danceable. Like ABBA.

There is not one song I skip over, after repeated plays. A little over-edited, the video keeps moving. The picture leaves a little to be desired. The fans are engaged by the band to become part of the experience.  Fun to watch their reactions.",1142121600,2,650,4.944954128440367
1370697,5,B00004Y3PB,"When the Corr siblings first began their ""Talk on Corners"" world tour in 1998, they were still relatively obscure, selling well in their native Ireland but not so well worldwide. Over the next sixteen months, the band shot up the charts with five hit singles and soldout shows the world over. By the time they returned home in July 1999, they had become one of the best-selling groups in Europe, and their concert at Dublin's Lansdowne Road Stadium proved it by becoming the show to top them all.

With over 40,000 fans in attendance, the quartet took the stage armed with recent hits and Irish charm, and the audience eagerly ate it up. The Lansdowne Road concert has since reached near-legend proportions among Corrs fans, and the DVD capturing it all has recently been released to North American viewers.

It's a roller-coaster ride from the get-go, with the show starting backstage, watching the band settle their nerves while getting ready to perform. From the opening note of 'Only When I Sleep' to the closing strain of 'Toss the Feathers', the show is one hit after another, spurred on by an enthusiastic audience that sang along ('Runaway'), danced along ('Haste to the Wedding'), and weren't afriad to participate fully in the music ('So Young').

In addition to the historic concert, this DVD has several ""extras"" that can't be found anywhere else. Since it was originally released in Europe just before the 'In Blue' album's debut in 2000, the DVD features a ""preview"" of three songs off the album (including worldwide smash hit 'Breathless') taken from the 2000 Fleadh festival, as well as interview/behind-the-scenes into the making of the album itself. It's a real treat for true fans of the band to see a bit of the studio work that goes into an album.

I have only two complaints about the DVD: first, there are some awkward cuts between songs, as, for some unknown reason, some of the tunes played at the show didn't make it onto the DVD. The only other complaint I have is that it took nearly four years to get this concert released in the U.S.

Looking for an exciting concert that will have your heart racing and have you eagerly participating from your living room? Look no further. It's family friendly, exciting, and an adrenaline-filled two hours of good music, good stories, and good fun.",1129507200,5,2314,4.8040201005025125
