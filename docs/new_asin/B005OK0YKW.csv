Think of all the corny jokes Buddy Sorrell and Sally Rogers came up with - and Rob Petrie tossed, then think of all the jokes they DIDN'T say.  Then you've got this film.

This movie features Buddy, Sally, and even Mel Cooley - scratch that, I should say this movie features Morey Amsterdam, Rose Marie, and Richard Deacon (the actors that portrayed Buddy, Sally, and Mel in The Dick Van Dyke show) in an almost plotless collection of gags and jokes.  It also features some rather unexpected cameos you have to watch out for.

It does NOT include Dick Van Dyke or Mary Tyler Moore, but maybe the script was too corny for them!

If you LOVE Buddy (Morey), you owe it to yourself to see this film.",1332460800,8,892,4.299401197604791
8481307,5,B005OK0YKW,"This movie really captures the spirit of Morey Amsterdam's humor. I'd definitely recommend being familiar with his style - very slapstick, and he was a way of telling terrible jokes in a way that is funny. I got to know him by watching a lot of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" (which features all 3 stars of this as regulars). On that show, he tells jokes I read out of kids' joke books when I was 6, but has a delivery that makes them seem new and hilarious.

This is nothing like ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", aside from Morey's character Buddy, who suggests a lot of ridiculous jokes and situations on that show. This movie is full of bad jokes, and embraces that. I wouldn't call it 'so bad its good', I would call it exactly what Morey Amsterdam intended it to be. There's also a few really fun cameos which are uncredited. I've found this to be an awesome collection of bad jokes delivered with a good spirit, and really packed together for the length of the movie. I love it. I also feel like the cast had a lot of fun making it. Any time a movie gives that vibe, it helps a lot in feeling like you're in on their fun.

I always like to note anything that may be offensive in movies. While this isn't as bad as many movies at the time, and features some black actors in small, non-subserviant roles, there's nothing particularly offensive aside from one particular scene. The scene is brief and features a white man playing an Indian person, answering questions about his country to a crowd with 'facts' that are jokes, such as how they ride on cobras etc. It isn't mean spirited, and doesn't say anything that would equate to Indian people being inherently bad, but does feature misinformed stereotypes and an actor in brownface. At this time in history, no thought was given to something like this, and it was seen as harmless, but I do think it is worth mentioning what to expect. No malice intended, but plenty of white ignorance (at the time, exchange of knowledge was a much slower process than now with the net and all, and people from a far off country that you never or rarely saw in person could seem as disconnected from your reality as an Orc in Lord of the Rings - not that they should, but no one was speaking up on their behalf at this point in history, and no one could see the harm in some goofy jokes that inadvertently promote stereotypes). For me, it kind of fits in with the rest of the bad jokes of the time on display here, and I'm glad it was light and brief compared to other racial jokes at the time. That was too many words on such a brief scene, but something I care about.",1522108800,,2597,4.319672131147541

8481309,5,B005OK0YKW,OMG! Morey Amsterdam is very hilarious . It drove me to tears. What made this film so interesting is that many entertainers made cameos.,1496707200,2,136,4.708333333333333

8481311,5,B005OK0YKW,"A very funny comedy with Morie Amsterdam and Rose Marie from the Dick Van Dyke Show. They will have you smiling and laughing all through the movie. If you enjoy old comedy, this is the movie for you.",1485820800,2,199,4.2631578947368425

8481313,2,B005OK0YKW,"Giving that the cast was from one of my all-time favorite TV shows, the Dick Van Dyke Show, I expected clever dialogue and an interesting plot. What I got, instead, was the unfunniest comedy I've ever seen.",1390694400,3,206,4.594594594594595
8481314,5,B005OK0YKW,"This movie has some horrible reviews in some on-line newspapers however, I never trust reviews that can, at best, say something is ""crummy"" but can't explain why.(ie- bad acting, lack of quality settings, etc.)

Had a severe case of the giggles for a while after this ended, something the standard scripts of comedy since this came out (and not that many of those, either!) has ever left me with! - I loved it!!!!

You'll need to go into this movie understanding the translation of the Yiddish word ""nudnick"" and pay close attention to the title to really appreciate the genius behind this one...and understand why ""negative"" adjectives, used to underrate it, are ironically necessary to the ultimate coming together of the concept of the film.

I do think those who have never seen the main cast work together in the Dick Van Dyke Show, first, might get a different sense of this film but, if you like comedy that isn't based in demeaning others, more innuedo than explicit dialogue and visual comedy, this is excellent. Has surprise appearances by Milton Berle, Irene Ryan, Charlie Weaver and others and a very clever, original use of word play scattered throughout.

If you don't ""get"" this rare gem & stand-out from the rest style of comedy's comedy, you have no sense of humor!",1389484800,5,1282,4.8136363636363635
8481315,1,B005OK0YKW,"When I recently heard of this film I thought I would like it a lot. It has plenty of mid-60's television comic celebrities in it, and I guess I was expecting the same quality of humor as you would find on the Dick Van Dyke show. But it's just cheap gags that just feel old over and over and over. I think I might have liked this movie when I was six or seven, it's just that type of humor. It's on Netflix now (and probably many other services) so if possible check it out online before you buy.",1362787200,6,495,4.01010101010101
8481316,5,B005OK0YKW,"I caught the last 5 minutes of this movie on TV one night, so I looked it up and found it was available.  I immediately ordered it!  I watched it and was enthralled with all of the cameos, and Moe Howard playing a straight part!  Hilarious!
I asked a friend ""when you watched the Dick Van Dyke Show, who were your favorite characters?"" (I already knew who mine were, of course...) She replied: ""Buddy and Sally!""
After the movie finished, she said ""they could have called it the Buddy and Sally show!""  :D

I'm glad to own a copy of this rare gem.  I believe these are made to order because I was notified that there would be a delay, but it arrived within a week of that email.  Trustworthy seller.",1361577600,8,699,4.290076335877862
