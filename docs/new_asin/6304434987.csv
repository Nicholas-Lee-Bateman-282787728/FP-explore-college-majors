882915,2,6304434987,"This film was featured in an episode of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000,"" and one viewing will show you why.  The plot is simple:  a runaway slave (Bernhardt) escapes from a spaceship to Earth, pursued by his cyborg masters and their dinosaur trackers.  On the way he (literally) runs into a novice nun who is a former prostitute and drug addict.  She helps him hide from the hunters, and he helps her sort out a crisis of faith.  Along the way there are bad special effects, cheesy forced-perspective dinosaur puppets (held close to the camera, they seem massive), and diabolical acting.
In spite of it all, this movie manages to transcind itself and become funny.  The fight sequences are a riot, and the special effects are as good for laughs as anything ""Dark Shadows"" or the original ""Star Trek"" ever produced.  And all in all, the storyline isn't any worse than that of ""Jurassic Park"" or ""Star Wars""; the biggest failing is the low budget and too much reliance on fight scenes to carry the action.

882916,5,6304434987,"In March 2001, I became a loyal fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000. (The first episode I saw was ""Puma Man"") Well, the first time I saw this horrible film on MST3K, I nearly died laughing! It is probably the most hilarious episode of MST3K in their final season. (Great commentary by Mike and the 'bots) The main synopsis of this putrid filth on film is that these dinos with exploding collers are sent to the future to kill humans and something else involving cyborgs. A Jeane-Claude Van Damme look-alike named Runaway is sent back in time to present day LA and meets up with a prostitute/druggie turned nun who lives in the house of the obese. Runaway then ends up in a crate factory where he confronts this cyborg who actually looks like an insane version of Alan Jackson (Tom Servo makes a point of this) They kickbox each other in a badly choreographed fight, which they end up doing again at the end where Runaway's shirt falls off of him (This scene was the stinger for the MST3K episode) The dinosaurs obviously look plasic, the story goes no where fast, the acting is some of the worst I have ever seen, the pathetic attempt at suspence and drama just falls flat on its face and the cyborg dude is a dumb.... On the big plus side, the stupidy of this film offered tons of hilarious dialogue for Mike and the 'bots and now is one of my favorite episodes. If you have to see this movie, you have to see the MST3K version! I promise you, you won't regret it.

Daniel Bernhardt is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that make him stand out.  I see that he is going to be in both MATRIX sequels.  While I loved the MATRIX I now have serious doubts as to the quality of the sequel.

882919,1,6304434987,"Have you ever seen this movie on television before? I saw it on Mystery Science Theater 3000, and I pray that this where it shall only be seen. Why do people produce movies like this? Of course, there exist a few known answers to this question. One is money, another is the intentional stupidity on the part of the filmmakers, i.e. trying to make it ridiculous. But ""Future War"" doesn't seem to belong to these two branches. No audience will be satisfied by this, not even Action movie buffs, so the prospect of monetary gain can be thrown out the window. It can not be intentionally stupid either, for those kinds of movies are absurd from the first scene to the last, and this movie seems to have scant attempts at human drama. So what is the excuse? An Accident? Good intentions that went horribly wrong? A bad experiment in trying to connect [bad] science fiction with other genres like Action and Drama? I suppose the best answer is that there isn't one. If you don't take my word for it, just listen to the brilliant story, such as it is: A man aptly named Runaway (Daniel Bernhardt), who looks, speaks, fights, and growls like actor Jean-Claude Van Damme, escapes from his desolate ""future"", accidentally finding solace in our modern era. He is befriended by a former-prostitute-turned-nun who helps the poser learn English. She then listens to Runaway's bizarre tales, primarily concerning his ""futuristic origin"". Naturally, she does not believe Runaway at first, but it is rather difficult to dismiss his claims after being chased by what can only be described as Dinosaurs with exploding metal collars. The duo join forces with what can only be described as the local gang and set out to demolish the Saurians once and for all. This proves to be quite simple, until Cyborg Master (Robert Z'Dar from ""Return to Frogtown"") arrives to show Runaway what pain truly feels like. Fighting ensues, it thankfully ends, and one is left confused and speechless. Like another film I reviewed entitled ""Neon Maniacs"", which is easily on the 10 Worst Films ever made, the driving question of ""Future War"" can strangely be summed up with one word: Why? Why did Runaway have to depart from his ""future""? Was it really ""the future""? If Runaway is from our ""future"", then why does he point to the sky when talking about his origin? Is Runaway trying to grunt the idea that he is from the ""future"" of another world? Why is this never fully expounded upon? Why does Daniel Bernhardt happen to be a blantant clone of Jean-Claude Van Damme? Why does Bernhardt speak like Van Damme? Also like Van Damme, why does Bernhardt make angry growls after every single punch and kick he bestows upon his enemy? Why is there a subplot involving a reformed prostitute-turned-nun? Why is there a single attempt at character development in a film that otherwise has none? Why is the acting so atrocious? Why does actor Robert Z'Dar always appear in horrible movies? Why are Dinosaurs pursuing Runaway? Once again, which ""future"" is Runaway from anyway? If Runaway is from Earth's ""future"", then why do Jurassic organisms follow him from it? If Runaway is from ""elsewhere"", are the Dinos supposed to be Space Saurians? Was Robert Z'Dar responsible for giving the cute Dinos those nasty exploding collars? Why didn't the T-Rex from Jurassic Park appear to show those Saurian puppets what a REAL Dinosaur looks like? Why does the local gang help Runaway combat the futuristic menace? Why not the horrid metal band GWAR instead? Would it make the movie any less incomprehensible? There is absolutely no meaning to this garbage. It simply goes nowhere. I am shocked and amazed that Van Damme hasn't sued Bernhardt for stealing his image on every level. Yet again, as described before, what audience would ever consciously make it to the end of this mess? The best choice is to leave this smoldering heap on the video shelf. It would be best not even to touch the box, as it may wear off on one's hands and cause 3rd degree burns. So, watch out for that Runaway! Daniel Bernhardt has lost his self-respect, and he's out to [get] yours! You have been warned.

It's bad enough that he looks so much like Jean-Claude Van Damme in the first place, but does he have to make the exact same kind of movies too? Also, say what you want about Van Damme, but at least the titles of his movies make sense! The plot is that a slave (who is never given a name) escapes from his cyborg captors in the future and goes to present day LA. How did he go back in time? We never really do find out. He runs into a reformed hooker who is now a nun and runs a halfway house for the obese. Do I really need to tell you that all the obese guys die before the end? Also, they apparantly thought that the slave fighting an unstoppable cyborg wasn't enough, so they threw in dinosaurs which explode when they are wounded so it is possible for the slave to beat them.

7871839,1,6304434987,"If you're a fan of the cult TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000, chances are you know about this movie. If you're not a fan, then this is among the worst b-movies you can find.

This movie is the result of an extremely untalented film-maker's attempts at making a grandiose sci-fi/action film that liberally rips off elements from The Terminator, Jurassic Park, and Universal Soldier.

My first experience with Future War was back around 1999/early 2000's when I was watching the Sci-Fi channel (Remember when SyFy used to be Sci-Fi, and was tolerable?) one Saturday morning and caught the MST3K episode that featured this abysmal movie.  Even when I wasn't as keen as to what makes movies ""work"" back at that age, I knew from the start that Future War was a terrible movie.

STORY

Future War takes place in (at the time) current day Los Angeles, California.  A man from the future escapes slavery from his cyborg captors and goes back into the past as a ""safe haven"" from his captors.  His cyborg captors also travel back in time with dinosaurs as ""tracking animals.""  The mysterious man from the future gets acquainted with a nun who's past is shady and an overweight black man, and they team together (along with an overweight, plaid-wearing gang later on) to fight off the cyborgs and their dinosaurs.

The above description should be enough to convince you that this is an extremely absurd movie, but I'll elaborate even further.

CHARACTERS

Future War is devoid of any well-developed characters.  While the Runaway (Daniel Bernhardt) is supposed to be ""mysterious,"" the execution of his development was terrible, as he's not the least bit interesting or does anything that warrants that I should care about him (his fight scenes against cyborgs and dinosaurs is beyond cheesy).

The supporting cast isn't much better, either.  They tried to make Sister Anne (Travis Brooks Stewart) more developed, but again, the execution was terrible as this was mostly done through clunky narration coupled with bland flashback scenes. The other characters are totally laughable.  Really, Sister Anne lives with a bunch of fat men and a kid with a bad Moe Howard haircut?  Fred (Andre Scruggs) has the personality of flypaper, and the same can be applied to just about everyone else in this movie.

BAD ACTING

There's zero decent acting anywhere in this movie.  The worst culprit is Daniel Bernhardt because he tries to do his best ""robotic"" acting like Schwarzenegger's acting for The Terminator, but it comes off a laughably bad.  With the rest of the cast, I felt nothing coming out of them that made me immersed in the movie.

LACK OF ORIGINALITY

While as previously stated, this movie does rip off from much better movies, it rips off The Terminator the most, with Universal Soldier coming as a close second.  There's a scene where the Runaway is taken to an LA police station and a doctor is examining the Runaway's state of mine, and one of the cyborgs starts attacking the police station.  This was a blatant ripoff from the iconic scene in The Terminator where the Terminator attacks the police station.  The fact that Bernhardt is a third rate Jean Claude Van Damme ripoff confirms my suspicions that they were trying to bank off the popularity and success of Universal Soldier as well.  With the fact that there's dinosaurs in this movie, and that Jurassic Park was all the rage in the 90's, it just comes off as a desperate attempt to cash in on that movie's popularity, too.

SPECIAL EFFECTS

The special effects for this movie are atrocious, even for a low budget movie.  Towards the end of the movie, where the Runaway and his ragtag team of combatants fight off the cyborgs and dinosaurs in a sewer, there's a scene where you can clearly see the strings on the dinosaur puppets.  Now if this were a b-movie from the 30's or 40's, it would be a little more forgivable, but the fact that this movie came out in 1997 makes that absolutely intolerable.

The puppets used for the tracking dinosaurs are terrible.  Most of them are really just miniatures constantly used in forced perspective shots, and their obvious stiff yet ""rubber"" look and movements makes them totally unconvincing. Anthony Doublin really should have thought harder when he directed this movie, since any film maker with any wits would have realized the scenes with the dinosaurs wouldn't have worked within their budget limitations, and should have worked with the writers to re-draft it into something more convincing in their budget.

There's a scene near the beginning of the movie that shows the Runaway's escape from a spaceship in the future, and while the effects of the ships in space are a little better than those absurd dinosaur scenes, the way they were filmed was a joke.  You don't see Bernhardt's character at all in these scenes, and just makes it look like nothing significant is happening in this scene.

VISUALS

The looks of the cyborgs in this movie are a joke.  The two cyborgs that go after the Runaway and his motley crew look like a hulked up Alan Jackson (this cyborg is played by Kazja) with mime facepaint and the other looks like a beefed up Freddy Mercury after a good beating (this cyborg is played by Robert Z'Dar, who also starred in another movie victimized by MST3K called Soultaker).  It also doesn't help that the cyborgs' outfits make them look like villains you'd see on the cover art for a bad Atari 2600 game.

The murky sound and picture quality of this movie (and the quality of the special effects) make this 1997 direct-to-video movie look like an untalented film student's final project circa 1987.

SOUNDTRACK

Arlan H. Boll's music for Future War is a joke.  It's all too clear that he was desperately trying to recreate the minimalist magic oozing from Brad Fiedel's masterful music from the first Terminator movie.  There's some compositions made during the action scenes that are so overwrought and melodramatic that they come off as funny.

The sound effects are pretty lame, too. The worst sound effects are for the cyborgs, since they have obvious ""robotic movement"" sounds edited into the movie, and they sound more appropriate for an episode of Lost in Space rather than a 90's sci-fi movie.

ACTION SCENES

Despite being a sci-fi/action movie, the action scenes in this are painfully boring.  The worst are the hand-to-hand fights between the Runaway and the two cyborgs.  All that really happens is that there's screaming between the combatants and get this, the cyborgs usually just stand there and wait for the Runaway to throw punches and kicks at them!!

It gets even more absurd towards the end when the Runaway and Sister Anne team up with a bunch of overweight, plaid-wearing gangsters to fight off the dinosaurs and remaining cyborg, and like the rest of the movie, it's devoid of any tension or excitement.

FINAL WORD

I think it's sad that a few years ago, when I was taking a digital video editing class in college, that me and some friends made some short videos that despite having some shortcomings to them, looked better than this movie, while this movie had a lot more resources to work with than me and my college friends did.

I also think Crow T. Robot summed it up perfectly with the following:

""You know, I could point out that it's not the future, and there isn't a war, but you know me; I don't like to complain.""

Do yourself a favor and watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode featuring this movie.  You'll get some great laughs and it'll turn this awful movie into a laugh fest.

He meets up with a former drug addicted prostitute who is going through novitiate (Catholic Nun Training) yet she still has street cred and a scrapbook of her hooker days.

So Slave boy and the Novice Nun join up with local 12 steppers and gangbangers to fight the T-rex puppets and kickboxing against Robert Z'Dar's chin. The fight scenes consist of either people kicking empty boxes at each other or Dinosaur puppets in hallways with empty boxes. In fact, the entire film is filled with empty boxes like a Solid Snake wet dream or a UPS training film.

Even with a budget in the thousands, I am not sure the script is filmable. The acting, with the notable exception of Travis Brooks Stewart (The nun unbelievably) is amateur at best. There is no nudity, limited gore, and the special effects consist of Dinosaur puppets.
