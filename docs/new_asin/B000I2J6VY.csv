2651294,5,B000I2J6VY,"I AM ALWAYS INTERESTED IN CLASSICAL LITERATURE AND ASIAN SELECTIONS ARE A FAVORITE OF MINE. HAVING READ THE BOOK, WATCHING THE MOVIE WAS MY NEXT OPTION. THIS FILM WAS WELL DONE AND DOES A GOOD JOB OF CAPTURING THE GREAT DETAILS OF THE WRITTEN VERSION. THERE ARE SOME GOOD SCENES FOR THE MARTIAL ARTS FANS. I RECOMMEND THIS FILM HIGHLY TO THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE ASIAN CLASSICS. IT HAS MORAL FIBER WHILE TELLING A GOOD STORY.",1368144000,,432,4.551282051282051
2651295,2,B000I2J6VY,"The movie itself is a good movie, however, I have the sub-titled version, I purchased this copy because it said in the description that it was DUBBED in English. NOT THE CASE. I guess I should have read alll the reviews because there is one that mentions that this is not dubbed in English as it clearly states in the description that it IS. Whoever is responsible for posting item descriptions needs to change this one, so as not to further mislead unsuspecting customers!",1362700800,2,473,4.642857142857143
2651296,5,B000I2J6VY,"One of the best kung fu movies I've bought, and received in excellent condition. Tells part of the story from a Chinese epic by the same name. Best to buy ""All Men Are Brothers"" as that also tells part of the story of The Water Margin.",1355270400,,235,4.130434782608695
2651297,3,B000I2J6VY,"The water margin was a good flick but despite the extra footage. I would rather have it dubbed in english, than have extra Footage. So I purchased Seven Blows of the Dragon.",1252454400,,173,4.4375
2651298,5,B000I2J6VY,"This film represents an attempt to bring an enormous amount of material from the original novel to film.  I would say that it is fairly successful.  The acting is good as are the exterior shots.  For someone interested in Chinese history and culture, this is a film that should be viewed, if not owned.",1231891200,,302,4.555555555555555
2651299,4,B000I2J6VY,"i was so surprised to hear the organ intro of the song salisbury by the british rock group uriah heep at the opening of the movie! apparently the music director was so fond of this song that bits and pieces of the organ solo (by lee kerslake?) are interspersed throughout the movie!

as far as the movie itself is concerned if you are looking for hard core wu-xia action, you are bound to be disappointed. those who like chinese historical movies or have read the classic ""outlaws of the marsh"" will find it entertaining.",1229040000,,521,4.542553191489362
2651300,4,B000I2J6VY,"This was one of my favorites as a kid, and to this day it still holds a special place in my martial arts film collection.  I though it was a colorful, fun, epic film then and it still holds up fairly well today.  The fighting is not that good or plentiful, even for an early 70's film it lacks in this area; and it's also mainly army vs army as opposed to individual kung fu fights.  If you watch this, the interest lies more in its story, characters, actors, situations, and pageantry rather than the martial arts action(but there is enough of that if you don't expect or demand wall-to-wall fights).

However, the vhs version i saw as a kid was called SEVEN BLOWS OF THE DRAGON and featured(during the opening credits) a fantastic, rousing, catchy, asian-sounding theme music.  The opening credits to the uncut, original language version DOES NOT have that theme music.  To me, this aspect was VERY disappointing.  There is no option to hear that theme music anywhere on the disc.  I was really hoping to hear it on my theater system with digital quality.  In its place is music that sounds like some 70's progressive rock band got a hold of it and went off on the keyboards.  Needless to say my vhs version will be held onto.

Anyway, the dvd is still worth picking up obviously.  You get the original uncut version in beautiful widescreen, english subtitles option, a couple of interviews and a featurette on the director.  Plus, almost 25 trailers(!) of other martial arts releases.  I got my dvd copy on sale at amazon for under $8, but the usual $13 asking price is worth it too.  Depends on how much you would miss that 'Seven Blows of the Dragon' theme i guess...",1217030400,5,1672,4.526666666666666
2651301,5,B000I2J6VY,"This film is a brief out take from the Chinese classic Outlaws of the Marsh, reprotedly carried by Chairman Mao throughout his heroic stuggles against fascism. The original story was written in the 14th Century and has been an onging source of inspiration to Chinese literary creativity ever since. The Original story has so many sub plots and charaters that I think it might classify as the first soap opera, and even in this highly slimmed-down version, is top heavy with individual characters that are either insufficiently developed or not developed at all. But If you are familiar with the original story, this won't be a problem. If you aren't, it will be confusing, but, I think, if you like the martial arts-swordsman-knightly honor genre, or just plain action, I think that won't be a barrier. The sound track is funny, reminding me of Sergio Leone and his Clint Eastwood movies. It is a very enjoyable movie to those not cloned from the Hollywood short-attention span generation. If you are a boingo, this movie will seem very confusing.",1163203200,13,1047,4.887640449438202
