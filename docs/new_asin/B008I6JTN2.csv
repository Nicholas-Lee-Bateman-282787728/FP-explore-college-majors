8605579,5,B008I6JTN2,"We spent one intensive week studying this during my DTS with YWAM. I was a bit skeptical at first, but the message is really eye opening and helpful and to this day (nearly seven years later) many of the themes have stuck with me. I would love to do a community group or something of the like on this topic. Highly recommended to people who are looking to understand core issues of break downs in their relationships, no matter how insignificant or important the relationship.",1485216000,,476,4.6117647058823525
