8642421,4,B00IIQY08Q,"I received a review copy of this Blu-ray, which captures yet another of the Europakonzert annual concerts that celebrate the Berlin Philharmonic's anniversary. As of this date, all concerts since 1991 are available on Blu-ray, except for those from 2002, 2005, 2009, 2010 and 2012.

Perhaps discs of those gap years are in the works. In any case, what's already available is an embarrassment of riches for those of us who love the Berlin Philharmonic, in my opinion the greatest orchestra in the world, and those stellar conductors who have led it in the past quarter century. As is to be expected considering the time span, the picture and sound quality varies a fair bit from disc to disc, although the performance level is invariably high.

My top three? It's hard to choose, but if you twisted my arm, I'd pick these:

The current Blu-ray's 2000 performance conducted by the greatly missed Claudio Abbado was recorded before high definition became the norm. As a result, the image is somewhat coarse and in far shots some jagged edges and ghosting are apparent. The sound is excellent, though. As usual, I chose the DTS-HD 5.1 option for transparency of orchestral textures and the benefits of surround sound.

The program for this concert represents bookends in Beethoven's creative output. The initial work is the composer's first large-scale orchestral work and the other is his last.

The Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 2, a pleasant work but not one I often seek out, is given a beautiful treatment by Mikhail Pletnev (here at the piano), and he's sensitively supported by Abbado and a reduced version of the orchestra. The performance appears to begin with a nod to the period instrument approach, with a light and sprightly first movement, but gets more Romantic in style as it goes along.

The Beethoven Symphony No. 9 is given a satisfying, middle-of-the-road interpretation. Abbado appears to be consciously toning down the monumental aspects of the piece. If a large-scale approach with a cathartic finish is what you prefer in this work (put me in that camp), you might find this a little tame.

An interesting bit of trivia from the disc booklet: The European anthem, made official in 1985, consists of a Karajan-arranged variation of the 9th's ""Ode to Joy"" theme.",1438560000,,2836,5.997524752475248
8642422,5,B00IIQY08Q,"The DVD version of this very satisfying concert from 2000 was very successful and this new Blu-ray version has been compared to that earlier DVD for the purposes of this review. The recording, although made some years ago, is a genuine HD original and that technical advantage was evident on the DVD and is even more obvious on this Blu-ray edition.

The Blu-ray version of this very satisfying concert brings a notable gain in clarity, both visually and sonically. The imaging offers much improved clarity especially on the long shots from the rear of the hall. These were the least successful aspects of the DVD format and these aspects show the greatest improvement in this Blu-ray format. The accurate skin tones and other textures of the previous DVD on closer shots are retained but with enhanced clarity, rather like a restored oil painting.

The gain in sound reproduction is also apparent with the previous good standard being further enhanced. Textures and range are both impressively caught in both the concerto and the symphony.

The performance of the symphony is exactly the same as the one included in the boxed set of the complete Beethoven symphonies, also available in both DVD and Blu-ray format. Unlike the rest of the series, this reading was recorded in Berlin instead of Rome. There is no discernible difference in the performances of the two versions of the blu-ray playback.

Abbado makes use of a full orchestra for the symphony but otherwise follows current thinking as regards 'period' performances of the work. Tempi are generally kept moving with a forward pace maintained and textures are clarified within the context of a full symphony orchestra. There is no doubling of woodwind or brass players though and that, combined with the skill of the players and Abbado's careful handling of phrasing and dynamics, keeps the reading within the context of the historical period in general terms.

The four soloists, Karita Mattila, Violeta Urmana, Thomas Moser and Eike Wilm Schulte, make a well-balanced team vocally. The Swedish Radio Choir, a favourite Abbado group, perform with precision and skill at a level consistent with the orchestra and above soloists. Interpretively this performance is much straighter than that offered by Thielemann, without any of his fluctuations of tempi and phrasing, and that makes this reading more convincing and satisfying as a late Classical period reading.

However, no matter what the many attractions are of the symphony, on this occasion it could be argued that Pletnev's performance of Beethoven's second piano concerto, actually the first written, is so outstanding that it remains the most vivid memory of the entire concert.

Pletnev has a playing style that is about as undemonstrative as it is possible to be. His technical skills are comprehensive so the focus of the performance is fixed firmly on the interpretive aspects of the performance. This is securely placed within the Classical period with precise observation of appropriate tempi, phrasing and touch. This reading offers a crisp performance of the outer movements delivering an obvious sense of personal involvement and pleasure radiating from the pianist to the audience, even bearing in mind his natural introspection, and this is well captured on the recording. The central slow movement is equally cleanly delivered but with great attention to sensitive detail. Abbado and the reduced orchestra accompany to perfection. The camera work is fully involving for the viewer without being intrusive.

The bonus feature is an extended tour around Berlin and makes for an informative and fascinating film documenting the continuing development of Berlin as an attractive city offering many delights for both residents and visitors.

Although this exact same recording and format is already included in Abbado's fine and deeply satisfying reading of the complete symphonies, also much enhanced in its Blu-ray format, the inclusion of Pletnev's outstanding concerto performance on this disc makes this single issue still well-worth considering for those who already own the complete symphony set even if the main item is doubled. For those who have not bought the symphony set, this makes a very attractive single disc option.

This is a successful Blu-ray issue and of an increasing number of Europakonzert discs now available in the Blu-ray format. Euroarts are intending to make all of this series available on the blu-ray format eventually. New collectors will find the Blu-ray format of this series very attractive. Those who already own the DVD versions will have some hard decisions to make. This disc is a good example of the benefits of the Blu-ray medium over the previous DVD option.",1391385600,3,4727,5.207894736842105
