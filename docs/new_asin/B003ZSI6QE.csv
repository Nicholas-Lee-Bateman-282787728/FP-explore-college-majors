This director / producer Bill Rebane Must be related to Edward D. Wood, Jr.!  Now I Must immediately search now for more movies made by this guy.....  If u like low - budget bad horror / sci - fi movies, you MUST get this, and, The Lost Skeleton Of Cadavra.  Thank U Bill Rebane for this wonderful ""so-bad-it's Great"" film.  LOVE the bad acting of the Mr. Olson character - it reminds me of John Candy on SCTV.  10 stars !",1206403200,,566,4.045045045045045
4235165,3,B003ZSI6QE,"This is not a masterpiece, there is no question about that.
But what it does capture in a brilliant way is the rustic astmosphere of the Wisconsin lifestyle. The way you can best watch this is  with a cup of hot chocolate or a cold beer on a cold night with a fireplace glow and really get into this cheesy flick.
I love the scenes in the local bar with the locals talking about Bigfoot. That gives it such a real down home touch. Also, I'm a sucker for any monster movie with snow in it.
Is it scary? Probably not. But its ambition and perserveriance
overcome that.
Grab a beverage and a bag of chips, sit back on a December or January Friday night, kick back and enjoy the show.
This would make a good double feature with ""Snowbeast"" for a full evening of brain-bashing.",1136505600,,772,4.287671232876712
4235166,5,B003ZSI6QE,"...there is only one reason to watch ""the Capture of Bigfoot.""
It's not the convincing creature FX.
It's not the clever introduction of Little Bigfoot (pre-dating ""Harry and the Hendersons"").
It's not fetching actress Verkina Flower as ""Linda, a teenager.""
It's not comic legend Otis Young as a henchman.
It's not the gripping tale of terror in a ski resort besieged by Arak, the Bigfoot (who looks like a Wampa).
And it's not the cool folk-song that plays over the credits.
No, the real reason to watch this film is the COOLEST SNOWMOBILE CRASH EVER FILMED.",1069113600,5,558,4.822916666666667
4235167,1,B003ZSI6QE,"If The Legend Of Boggy Creek is the best of the 70,s era bigfoot movies,then this has got to be the worst. At least you were scared when you watched Boggy Creek for the first time as a kid. This movie couldn't scare a four year old,and besides,who the hell ever heard of a white bigfoot?If you liked Boggy Creek or The Creature from Black Lake,stay the hell away from this turd! It wasn't worth the film to record it on! And for heavens sake don't buy it! Trust me it really is that bad!  Kindly,Matt Singler",1067212800,4,508,4.237113402061856
4235168,5,B003ZSI6QE,"This one is truly terrible. A very boring story featuring some of the worst actors and most inept direction I have ever seen.
Despite all of this, or more accurately because of it, this is one of my all time favourite movies. This is one of those that you gather your friends around to watch with you, for a good group laugh. It is a terrible movie, but one of those that is bad in a good way. Just like we've come to expect from Bill Rebane.
However, I can't recommend this to everyone, or, for that matter, to anyone. It is poorly written, ploddingly directed, and terribly acted. And these are the main reasons why I love Capture of Bigfoot so much. Each time I see it, I find something new to laugh at.",1007251200,7,706,4.237037037037037
4235169,3,B003ZSI6QE,"The Capture of Bigfoot is a decent portrayal of how a Bigfoot/hominid-type creature would react if its offspring were kidnapped by humans.
The movie had great winter scenery and had several suspenseful moments as the stars rambled through the snow and had encounters with the mammoth creature.
These creatures are normally shy and avoid humans, but when hurt, provoked or an offspring is harmed or stolen, look out!",1004313600,7,415,5.117647058823529
4235170,3,B003ZSI6QE,"It was announced on the F/X Channel that the actor who played Bigfoot was actually the late professional wrestler Stan ""Plowboy"" Frazier, who became famous in the WWF as Uncle Elmer.  I have verified this fact with his widow.",996710400,2,225,4.769230769230769
8410805,3,B003ZSI6QE,"I don't think Troma had any input into this movie, else bigfoot would have been riding around on a snowmobile.
And indeed they do not have it listed in their productions.
That's a bonus to me.
But still it is a perfect waste of time.
The costumes are hoakey, the characters are likeably one dimensional.
Wardrobe ... K-Mart
Some pushing the snowmobiles around by hand, must have been before they put torque converters on them.",1527206400,,426,4.693333333333333
8410806,4,B003ZSI6QE,"Talk about corny movies, and this one is close to the top of the list.  That said, it does have a bit of charm.",1524787200,,111,3.625
8410807,4,B003ZSI6QE,"If you know bad movies, you know Bill Rebane. Probably best known for ""The Giant Spider Invasion"", he has made low budget films on many subjects, most of them ridiculous. I knew it was going to be a great movie when I saw the opening credit ""The Legendary Creature of Arak played by Janus Raudkivi"". Set in the middle of small town Wisconsin in the winter, the film opens with trappers capturing a yeti, but things don't go well as their plan has several flaws. I won't trouble you with much plot: there's a ton of walking around (a Rebane specialty), an amazingly daft looking bleach blonde yeti (I guess an albino bigfoot is a thing...), a sasquatch invasion of the lamest ski resort ever, a sheriff who does insufferable John Wayne impressions (I guess this was supposed to be the comic relief part), and Richard Kennedy as Olsen, a murderous psychopath who for some reason wields excessive power in this loopy tundra town. Basically yetis are peaceful but Olsen's evil poachers shot and killed a baby bigfoot (played by Randolph Rebane) and now mom (Raudkivi) is mad. Before it's over there's a simply embarrassing dance at the lodge to endure, an albino yeti capture and escape, and a ridiculous fire to contend with.

You will be unsurprised to learn that this gem was made in Gleason, Wisconsin on a miniscule budget. It's all quite ludicrous even by the low standards of 1970's bigfoot dramas, but like other Rebane films, that's part of its odd charm. This is a terrible movie: it's plodding, poorly acted (especially the histrionics from Kennedy), has terrible costumes and special effects, and is utterly predictable. Yet somehow, believe it or not, I enjoy it for what it is. Sure it's horrible, but what were you expecting? It's a cheap 1979 film called ""The Capture of Bigfoot"" after all.

This is one of those films that if you're so inclined to appreciate the concept of ""so bad it's good"" will fill you with mirth.",1511481600,,1931,4.710059171597633
8410808,5,B003ZSI6QE,"If you grew up in northern Wisconsin, as I did (in Rhinelander, home of the Hodag!), you will LOVE this movie, which was filmed only a few miles south of Rhinelander, in the town of Gleason! I still clearly recall seeing the VHS jacket for this movie on the shelf of my local video rental store - Trig's Video - in the mid-1980's, and just seeing it used to scare me (although the art for the original VHS release was totally different from what is on the cover of this modern DVD re-issue)! True, this movie is not even a ""B movie"" but more like ""C"" or even ""D"", but for only ten bucks it is worth owning just to re-live those beautiful northern Wisconsin winters of the late 1970s/early 1980s! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1467417600,,715,4.383458646616542

8410810,3,B003ZSI6QE,I was there for part of the shooting with my fianc  about 40 years ago.  So when I saw it for rent on Amazon had to see the finished product.  It was just a tongue in cheek film.  I hope that is what was intended.  I wonder what Oscar winner Otis thought about his part.,1396396800,,270,3.8363636363636364
8410811,5,B003ZSI6QE,"I love old low budget horror movies like this that were intended to be frightening but are not, and are comical in their failure to be scary.  In the tradition of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", ""Capture of Bigfoot"" delivers many LOL's.  It's awesome, I must watch it every few years.  Every time the ""serious"" villain Mr. Olsen is on screen, I feel like I'm watching John Candy in SCTV comedy sketches!",1391212800,,398,4.5
8410812,5,B003ZSI6QE,"Mitch Irish! 'nuff said.  This man should be a legend.  The performance of ""The Friends"" is the only reason I voted 5 stars.  Haven't seen the movie yet, but I ordered it to see Mitch... I love him.  I only dream he takes off the restraining order so I can smell his hair one last time.",1298419200,3,286,4.053571428571429
8410813,2,B003ZSI6QE,"Bill Rebane's campy creature feature THE CAPTURE OF BIGFOOT comes late in the cycle of Bigfoot films that proliferated in the 70's. Like SNOWBEAST from 1977, Rebane's film takes place in a snowy mountain town where a giant monster is roaming the forest killing anyone who crosses it. A rich business man hires the local hunters to trap the beast so that he can put it on display, but their attempts only lead to more bloodshed! Despite its penniless production, the film manages to pull together a decent cast, many of whom had worked with Rebane previously on THE ALPHA INCIDENT. While the acting holds up well enough, the same can't be said for the pace. CAPTURE trudges along endlessly as the hunters search the barren woods for the creature, who only appears for a few brief scenes. The costume is a bit silly, but the ridiculous sounds it makes and the way it shambles through the forest reduce any potential threat that it may represent. This entry is no worse than many of the other shlocky films of its kind, and is only elevated by the performances of Richard Kennedy, Stafford Morgan, and Buck Flowers in the leads.
