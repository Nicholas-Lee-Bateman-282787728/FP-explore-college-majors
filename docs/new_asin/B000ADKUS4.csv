8222855,5,B000ADKUS4,"Tim Williams is a excellent player with a great feel for acoustic blues, slide and rag playing. The music is fun to play and you will learn quite a few new techniques from each song. Mr. Williams breaks down each section of the songs in an easy converational style as if you were taking a private lesson with him. This video is for the intermediate to advanced player. Enjoy!",1284508800,,375,4.449275362318841
