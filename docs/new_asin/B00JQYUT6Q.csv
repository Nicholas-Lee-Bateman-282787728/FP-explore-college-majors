8653455,2,B00JQYUT6Q,"This is three separate tales connected by an unusual bordello run my Madam Raven (Natalie Milner). The stories are short with no character build up and not much plot. The ""twists"" were not great and in this type of tale, that is a must. I would say the first story was my favorite, but none were serious standouts.

8653456,4,B00JQYUT6Q,"""Bordello Death Tales"" is a low budget trilogy but well managed, and directed brilliantly. It is a collection of clever video nasties that does not disappoint. I found the stories entertaining, the deaths graphic and gory, plus the witty endings offer a nice slice of justice. Actually ""Bordello Death Tales"" is kind of tasteful in the fact that it puts all the power in the hands of ""whores"" who are often tossed aside or relegated to the gutters of man's dark nature. The film is well worth checking out for indie, and low-budget horror fans.

""The Ripper"" is a chilling and brutal story that is both organic, and visceral. ""The Ripper"" offers a fun, entertaining blood soaked gorefest. ""Stitchgirl"" is a campy, black & white piece that beckons Tim Burton to the truly dark side of cinema. With a Gothic avant-garde design this short film is well worth the price of this collection of death tales. ""Vice Day"" is more video nasty. The story is a bit of a drag in the middle, more wordy and boisterous than the other two stories.""Vice Day"" still holds it's own with its dark nature and blood bath epitome.",1432166400,,1105,4.666666666666667
8653457,4,B00JQYUT6Q,"This is a really above average, minuscule budget horror anthology from the UK. I've watched a lot of indie horror movies in the past year and I've developed a useful way of thinking about them. What you're looking for is the ratio between production values and apparent budget. I'm not saying that a film with low production valuessuch as, say, Sledgecan't be good, but I think in general what you're looking for is a film that feels like the creative team behind it is giving their utmost to. That's the case here. The three stories are all extremely strong. The first, The Ripper, was probably the weakest of the set, but still quite good. Stitch Girl is my favorite, an amazingly well crafted piece of work featuring the unforgettable face of Eleanor James and her miraculous eyes, which are wide and deep as the Great Lakes. The final piece, Vice Day, is a surprisingly mature piece that draws horror from a tale of political scandal. The weakest part of the film is the framing narrative with Natalie Milner as Madame Raven, and the thing that hurts it most is Milner's costume, too much like a child's Halloween witch costume. But don't let that keep you from checking out a truly excellent piece of horror. This movie deserves to be seen.",1422489600,,1245,4.663636363636364
