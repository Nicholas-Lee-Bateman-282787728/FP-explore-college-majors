7905002,3,B000006QY2,"Armored Attacks aka The North Star, 1943 film

This begins in a small village in Russia. We see horse-drawn vehicles (as in some parts of the USA) and the lives of the people. The radio brings the news. Children go to school. The people celebrate, June 22 is the traditional Mid-Summer's Day. They are all happy on this holiday. [Note the simple wood doors.] A group walks on their journey. [Note the outdoor stalls for cows.] This group sleeps on the grass. They get a ride on the farm wagon, and sing again. The man in uniform sees something in the sky: many airplanes. Then a bomb falls! People are wounded or killed. Airplanes shoot at the village. The news tells of the invasion by Germany. One group will go to the hills to be armed guerillas, others will stay behind and destroy crops, animals, and houses to keep them from the enemy, Can the armed services be supplies with ammunition? They save the guns.

""Travel by night, stay in the woods."" People have to prevent their property from being stolen. ""Another burning village!"" They use a fire engine to try to put out the fire at some houses. A woman who doesn't talk has her arm and leg broken! Guerillas attack German troops. A bomber attacks German troops but is shot up. It then crashes into the tanks! Young children are bled to provide fresh blood! The German doctor explains their needs. Guerillas plan an attack on motorcycles as a distraction in the night. They take casualties. The guerillas plan an attack on the gasoline depot. Next the guards. Mounted riders attack too. The children are rescued. `I'm sorry for that."" Dr. Karin stops two doctors from doing their work. Will this be the last war once people can make a better world? [Does human nature and society ever change?]

This starts out like a musical then shifts into drama about the horrors of the war on the Eastern Front. Were there better movies about the resistance in WW II?",1397001600,,1912,4.60117302052786
7905003,4,B000006QY2,"Amazon's product description & the attached ""box foto"" relate to an A&E educational documentary (prob. only 50 min. long) about the history of tank warfare over the last century.  But all the reviews relate to a totally DIFFERENT video, a fiction film running appx. 2 hours, directed by Lewis Milestone & written by Lillian Hellman in 1943-44, with stars like Dana Andrews, Anne Baxter, Walter Huston, & Erich Stroheim.

Each video has its own interest, but it should be made clear which is which, so that buyers will get what they think they are getting! -- Prof Steven P Hill, University of Illinois.",1112745600,6,602,4.834951456310679
