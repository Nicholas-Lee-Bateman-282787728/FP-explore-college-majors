2021587,5,B0001OGVTO,Really enjoy the condensed movie trilogy of the classic Gundam series.  It's definitely a give and take as the changes made from the TV series go though (the core booster is so much better than the G Armor but the omission of the Gyan fight in Texas colony is just mean).,1477440000,,271,4.313725490196078

2021589,5,B0001OGVTO,"Following RightStuf's release of Mobile Suit Gundam on Bluray and DVD, we also get the Mobile Suit Gundam movies. Collecting Mobile Suit Gundam I, Mobile Suit Gundam II: Soldiers of Sorrow, and Mobile Suit Gundam III: Encounters in Space, these 3 discs cover the three theatrical Gundam releases. Each movie is a condensed version of the show. For example, the first movie covers the attack on Amuro's colony up until Operation Odessa. The second covering from there up to the return to space after the Jaburo assault; and so on. The movie's hold up a lot better than the actual show due to the improved visuals. There is new footage added but it was only shortly after the TV show had come out so its not as jarring a difference as the Zeta Gundam movies new footage was.

Otherwise, this is an excellent release. It is subbed only like the previous Bandai release and only available on DVD but to have it rereleased is awesome!",1464825600,,929,4.63030303030303

However, there is a new remixed 5.1 audio track which is absolutely stunning over a good set of speakers. The only real complaint some may have is the loss of nostalgic value in the classic sound effects, and if that truly bothers you, purchase the DVD or Blu-Ray sets for the TV series, as they maintain the original audio tracks.

2021594,3,B0001OGVTO,"While I am overjoyed we're finally getting officially licensed Gundam releases again, I am somewhat disappointed with this release. The picture quality is surprisingly stunning for DVD, however it is lacking the original theatrical audio mix. For newcomers to these movies this probably won't be a problem, but for those who watched the originals on VHS the different sound effects and altered music placement is pretty jarring and often lessens the impact of certain scenes.

All in all it's a decent release that I am more than happy to support, and if you've never seen the original Gundam before I'd say this is still a good place to start despite the Lucas-esque changes.",1452643200,,676,4.982300884955753

2021646,4,B0001OGVTO,"Having already seen the dubbed show, I do miss the English cast, especially Brad Swill and Michael Kopsa as Amuro and Char.  Still, seven hours of Gundam is plenty to get across a coherent, if somewhat shallow, story.  They do include the remastered audio for Japanese but scrubbed the English dub from the VHS versions altogether.

2021648,5,B0001OGVTO,"1st of all, avoid the English dub at all costs. Seriously, watch it in Japanese and just read the subtitles. If you found the TV series to be drug out a bit and got tired of the ""freak of the week"" feel, then this is for you. I really have no complaints for what it is. It perfectly sums up the major events from the 0079 TV series. These movies are good for getting on with the storyline in the universal century. You will miss some character development that was present in the TV series, but its only natural.",1415836800,,512,4.181818181818182
2021649,2,B0001OGVTO,"i agree with P. ROOKS, the three movie OVA compilation is actually BETTER than the original TV series that it was supposed to be summarizing in that it clarifies the importance of the Newtypes (mutants) from the beginning, unlike the TV series where the concept is introduced late and then abandoned entirely in a throw-away manner, and uses the richness of the different mobile suit types (that became the hallmark of this series) rather than having mobile suits ""transform"" into other types of mobile suits like the TV series did.  If you want to start GUNDAM watching correctly, this is where you want to start.  (Incidently, the reason that the TV series was only 42 episodes long was because it was CANCELLED because it was so disjointed and boring that the Japanese wouldn't watch it.  That is why BANDAI ""tightened-up"" the OVA sumarization).

So why my low rating?  The DVD compilation LEFT OUT THE ENGLISH DUB that was found on the VHS tapes.  If you already have the dubbed VHS tapes, this set will NOT replace them.  If you have kids that you want to introduce to GUNDAM, they will watch the VHS tapes but they will not watch these tapes because they are in Japanese.  Way to kill the franchise BANDAI.

AMAZON customers can still buy the dubbed VHS tapes (Gundam, Soldiers of Sorrow, and Encounters in Space) at a reasonable price, however.  (In fact, I believe that they are cheaper than this DVD set).",1412553600,,1414,4.711382113821138

2021654,2,B0001OGVTO,"I own the original trilogy on VHS but my copies are getting old and worn out so i sought to replace them with DVDs. i looked around was rejoiced when i found this DVD available, without doing any research i bought it.

i was sorely disappointed to learn that not only did this not have an English Dub (which the VHS does and i still enjoy very much) but they remastered the sound as well, taking out a lot of old classic sound effects that had become staples of the original anime and replaced them with more realistic ones like actual machine gun fire and such.

not only that but they removed all the songs (Here comes Char, Soldiers of sorrow, The Beginning, encounters) from their respective scenes.

I understand that this was probably in an attempt the mature the movies for a more adult audience but in my opinion they removed part of what made these movies so great and enduring to me. ive never finsihed watching the DVD editions and now it just sits on my shelf gathering dust and my VHS copies continue to degrade more and more with each new viewing.

2021678,5,B0001OGVTO,"Now this was not the show or movies that got me started in Gundam. That was Gundam Wing. This show engrained into me the franchise. The characters namely Char Aznable (king badass and survives big explosions like crazy) and Amuro Ray ( a memorable character in his own right ). Their own rivalry doesn't take center stage  til movie three but movie one shows Char's pride as a pilot is compromised. Zeon's ruling family is likable to a little degree, Dozle and Garma at least.

2021679,4,B0001OGVTO,"When I picked this movie series, I had been wanting to see the original TV series something fierce but sadly, it was only available in English up until recently on DVD.  I was finally able to pick up this set online and I fell in love with the set instantly.  Now, this is NOTHING like Gundam Wing as in style so if you're thinking that, you may as well give up looking right now.  But if you were EVER curious as to HOW Mobile Suit Gundam came to be, this is your chance to get a good grasp of it without grabbing the entire 56 episode TV series as the three movies give you a good chunk of what happened in those 52 episodes in about 6-8 hours. So again, if you're at all interested in the origins of how Gundam started, I highly recommend picking these movies up at some point.  These movies ARE from the 70's though so keep that in mind.

2021681,5,B0001OGVTO,"Ok, to start this review I'm going to be honest, I purchased this not realizing I was only getting the 3 TV movies. I thought it was the entire series.

Pros:
For what its worth... This is a good buy. If you hate how gundam series involve alot of politics, buy this, it skips the jibber jabber and cuts to the heart of the story, and more importantly, the action. I watched all 3 movies on a 42"" plasma tv, the resolution is crisp and the audio is perfect, even when im annoying my neighbors with the high volume! (Watch all your gundam series LOUD trust me its awesome.)

Cons:
I do not like the shortened format. I'm a fan of the full length version as ive watched it at a friend's house. Im also VERY critical of this version because they cut out the Amuro and Gundam's battle with M'Quve and the Gyan in New Texas colony. They focus more on Amuro VS Char, and cut out alot of the sequences of shooting down multiple Zaku's and blah blah blah.

Regardless of all the cuts, The series still makes sense. If you've never seen Mobile Suit Gundam, at least you'll get the summary of it. them leaving out the M'Quve fight really burns me, the Gyan is a super cool Zeon unit.

Verdict: I'd buy it again, but i wish i'd found the complete series first.. the complete series is now in my wishlist.. its about $150.00 and has a glorious load of extras from the original run. Either way they will both soon take up a place on my shelf for my sons to someday enjoy.",1319673600,,1457,4.23021582733813
2021682,4,B0001OGVTO,"It was a surprise to find the original series of the Gundam's as I had thought never to see it, be it in its original form or other format, so finding the three movies it had become who could resist grabbing it while the grabbing was good?  Politics, adventure and the odd romantic moment all rolled up into a grand adventure.

I'll admit I had a ball picking amidst the movies and finding the forerunners of the Wing Seed and 00 Universes.  And they are there, easy enough to find if you look and believe me, I looked and I enjoyed.  If there is one thing the Gundam genre has kept continuity with its a decent story line with characters that have some depth to them.  You get the shallower characters but then you get the gems and for me its usually the grey characters that I enjoy the most.

If you watch a Gundam series you should expect to see more than giant mecha running around shooting each other... and I for one am damn glad it is so much more than that.

The movies are long, incorporating so much of the original series that I have to wonder what they might have left out.  You think movie and you think editing and missing half the series, but in this case, I don't think so.  Its detailed, complex and more than just enjoyable.",1311984000,,1243,4.277777777777778
2021683,1,B0001OGVTO,"Been an anime and mecha fan for years, Gundam was one of the first mecha anime I watched. Despite what people say I enjoyed the dub. When i saw this I thought awesome I get to see Amuro and Char again, oh japanese? Oh well I'll just switch it to the english track, but nope no english track it's all japanese. I am disappointed at Bandai for not considering both parties and not having two tracks. I have no problem with fans who choose to have subs but, that is why DVDs have multiple voice tracks, it's just a crying shame that this collect is ruined by the lack of a dub track for the dub fans.",1306454400,,597,4.111111111111111
2021684,5,B0001OGVTO,"If this wasn't the original series, I wouldn't have given it 5 stars. That being said, I will expand: the original series (42 episodes) is truly the one to watch, as it expands the series and fully rounds out the characters without losing focus. The movie trilogy advertised here is the summation of the series major plot points between three 3-hour long films. I think it doesn't give the series proper respect, as it felt very rushed watching it (I showed it to two of my friends who were interested in watching it, they were pleased but they too felt it went a little quick). Three hours doesn't give proper justice to a series based around a One Year War (with 8 months since the start of it already passed).

In summary, this is a must have for anyone interested in the Gundam series, as it helps to highlight what happened so that other Gundam series can be seen and enjoyed without the watcher being lost. I would recommend watching the full 42 episodes to get the proper experience, but this will suffice for the soft core fan. NOTE: This is entirely in Japanese with English subtitles. There is NO English dub for these movies. The original show IS dubbed in English. Just to forewarn potential buyers.",1301961600,,1211,4.580645161290323
2021685,5,B0001OGVTO,"For those who wrote reviews saying that this trilogy of films is a condensed compilation of the TV series, yes that is true.

For those who say the original TV series is better, not necessarily.

A little anime history lesson.  The original MS Gundam TV series came out in 1979 and was one of the first japanese anime robot series to break from the 'Super Robot' mold of shows like Mazinger Z, Zambot, Brave Raideen and others.  You know, the typical 'little kid' or team of hot blooded pilots controlling a giant super robot with near magical like abilities.  MSG was one of the first shows to depict giant robots as a mass produced weapon of war subject to the laws of reality, with the real stars being the characters themselves.  However being one of the first of the 'Real Robot' style of shows, it still had a lot of 'Super Robot' type elements, including a very colorful looking hero suit, and pretty ridiculous 'evil monster of the week' enemy Mobile Armors.  Face it, the original MSG was still pretty cheesy at times despite the otherwise realistic setting of civil war in space.  There were quite a few crappy 'monster mobile armor of the week' filler eps and cheesy gimmicks like the G-Armor and Gundam Hammer weapon that smacked too much of the Super Robot shows.

In 1981, series creator and director Yoshiyuki Tomino took the best elements of the original TV series, cut out much of the super robot kiddie elements, plot filler, to develop a more harsh and realstic depiction of the One Year War and original saga into three movies.  And FYI, Tomino states that the events depicted in the film are the official canon to the UC Gundam saga, not the TV series.

If you want to be a completist, watch the TV series for all the good and bad, but if you had to choose between the TV series and Movie compilations, just know that the films are all you need to watch to get a firm foundation in the 'original' aka Universal Century timeline of the Mobile Suit Gundam saga.

This film compilation is subbed only, which is not such a bad thing as there was an infamous dub that featured a horrible british sounding Bright Noa and everyone pronouncing the gundam as 'gunDAMN!'  I heard a clip of the dub and it's hilarious painful.

To hear a great fan review on these films, check out the Gundamn! @ MAHQ podcast.",1298160000,,2319,4.5299760191846525
2021686,5,B0001OGVTO,"A New Mobile Suit

When Cartoon Network announced that they would be airing the original Mobile Suit Gundam TV series, I was excited. The show that started it all, the great giant robot epic, the STAR WARS OF JAPAN. And then I watched it. I couldn't believe it. I was actually BORED. The animation was mediocre, the plot, slow, the characters, largely annoying. And don't get me started on the English voice-acting.

So you can imagine with what reluctance I purchased the Gundam Movie Trilogy on DVD. And what a surprise it was. Pretty much every complaint I had with the TV show was completely obliterated. The animation, even in the first Gundam movie, looked MUCH nicer. Maybe it was the DVD format, maybe the picture was cleaned up and restored...I don't know. All I know is, the animation looked WAY better. And remember all those redundant scenes (like the Gundam parts switching in mid-air) that were beginning to drive you mad? Gone. Remember those spread-out action scenes that happened just barely often enough to keep you watching? Now they're all part of the same battle, the action escalating and escalating until you're practically hyperventilating. And glory be, the characters seem more fully fleshed out too. And the plot improvements? A bit like replacing ""What are midichloreans?"" (hope I spelled that right) with ""The force is what gives a Jedi his power."" The sound effects, speech, and music were redone for the dvds as well. No words can describe the difference. What was cheesy or fake now sounds awesome. I kid you not.

Zeon Strikes Back

These DVDs do have one or two downsides. First, they're not exactly cheap. Secondly, there's almost no extras at all. No trailers, no making of documentary, no commentary. Nothing. And third, there's no English version of the speech. Now I can deal with that, but I really wish they had gone through the trouble to record a good English version of these movies. It really would have been the icing on the cake.

Then of course there is a bit of a boring lag in between the first and third Gundam movies. I know, I know, we get more insight into the characters and their motivations in the second movie. But compared to the gripping drama of the first and third movies (not to mention the awesome rivalry between Char and Amuro) the second movie is a bit slow-moving. For the movie with Char and Amuro on the cover, you'd think there would be more of the cool Amuro vs. Char action. Oh, well.

Return of the Newtype

Let's face it, great animation doesn't hurt. Great music and sound effects enhance everything. Good voice-acting helps a lot too. But what really makes for an engaging Mecha Saga is plot, action, and characterization. It's awful hard to get hooked when you don't care about the characters, the plot is boring and the action is comatose. Foretunately, the third Gundam movie delivers in these all-important ways, and features the best animation of the three movies as well.

In the third Gundam movie, everything comes to a head. Sayla confronts Char. Char and Amuro have a showdown. Mirai tries to decide who she loves. Complications of war and emotional turmoil tears at everyone. And every time you think the last battle is over, the action gets even more intense. It quite literally blew me away. In short, the Gundam movies succeed in every way.

If you loved the show, buy the movies. If you hated the show, buy the movies. If you love anything Gundam, buy the movies. These movies have a priviledged place on my shelf, ahead of Gundam Wing, Martian Successor Nadesico, and even the awesome Macross Saga. I can give no higher recommendation.",1296777600,,3628,4.75516693163752
2021687,4,B0001OGVTO,I recommend this to anyone who is a gundam fan and doesn't want to set through forty three/two episodes of this series.,1293840000,,119,4.454545454545454
2021718,3,B0001OGVTO,"This is the Anime Legends release of the Mobile Suit Gundam movie trilogy, a series of compilation movies made from 1981 to 1982 by Yoshiyuki Tomino.  Even though I say ""compilation movies,"" these films are really more than that, since by the third movie over 80% of the animation is new and various characters and mecha are substantially different from the original TV show.  Anyway, the Bandai Anime Legends line of DVDs compiles previously released discs (overstock?) and re-releases them for a cheaper price in more-space-saving packaging.  This means that these discs are the exact same ones that were released in 2002 and re-released every so often since then.

What you will get with these discs:  the ""Special Edition"" releases of the movies with the re-done Dolby 5.1 audio/music and decent picture quality.  Also, one of the finest sci-fi sagas ever committed to celluloid.

What you will NOT get with these discs: anything new, meaning no original version audio/music.  No extras or trailers.  At least this time Bandai isn't making any false claims on the packaging, as they did on their previous release (as I noted in my review for that version).

Personally, I prefer the original audio over the redone versions.  If Bandai ever does release an actual new edition of these films in the future with the original audio and extras I'll be the first one in line with money in my grubby little hands.  But it looks like this is what we get.  Just be aware what you are buying when you purchase this, do not be fooled into thinking that this is new.  I actually bought this.  Even though I knew the nature of the Anime Legends label, like someone with Alzheimer's (in the words of Lewis Black) I picked this up anyway hoping it just *might* be new, opened it up and... ""son of a *****!""  I put it up for sale on Amazon the next day.  I probably should have put this review up back closer to when I got this (and closer to when it came out) but I can be really slow sometimes.

Those tapes are impossible to find at a decent price and Bandai has access to the 2007 DVD re-release in Japan that was an HD remaster with the original audio and video.

While it's a step in the right direction to keep the classic Gundam series alive, the original versions of these movies are long overdue for a release on DVD. While I believe that Bandai should focus on releasing ZZ, Victory, X, and Turn A and at the very least finish the anime Gundam series before re-releasing something that we already have, if you really want to watch this great movie trilogy then this is your best bet.

2021724,5,B0001OGVTO,"First: in case it was not clear to anybody, these movies are a 'compilation' of the original Mobile Suit Gundam anime series. Basically, they just trimmed up the tv show and turned it into 3 two-hour episodes.

If you don't know much about MSG, it may be more confusing...
Another note: it is only subtitled, there is no English dub.
Despite all that, I highly recommend this. It's an awesome story with interesting characters (Char!), lots of action, and a 'happy' ending (unlike a lot of the Gundam Shows).

2021726,4,B0001OGVTO,"Some may look at this rating of four stars and think, ""What? He doesn't think that the Gundam Trilogy is well-nigh perfect? What in Zeon's name is WRONG with him?""  But don't worry, I'm not giving the MOVIES four stars (for the record I love these movies - to me they make a better space movie trilogy than Star Wars - let the flaming commence!) Let me clarify:
I'm not going to review the actual movies here (at least, not that much) seeing as how they have already been reviewed in depth by better writers than myself.  Rather, I will review this movie set as a *product*.  Meaning I am going to review the DVDs themselves.
And the DVDs are perfectly adequate.  The video and audio are good (especially for almost-thirty year old films that have been made from a 1979 TV show).  Unlike other reviewers I am not completely incensed by the new Dolby 5.1 remix of the movies' soundtracks (apparently these discs have the same audio as the previous collectors edition box set).  Except...
That is all that is available.  And if that is what was promised (as per the previous release of these titles) I would feel alright.  But on the back of the handy-dandy-less-shelf-space-taking case the Features & Extras listed include (and I quote) ""Original Japanese Mono Track (Movie II & Movie III)"" as well as ""Japanese Stereo Audio"" for Movie I (Which I'm guessing is different from the 5.1 which is listed separately).  Bandai, why do you lie to me?  Not to mention the blurb in the box at the bottom which says ""English and Japanese Audio.""  There is no English dub track.  Lies, lies, lies (Lies, I tell you!).
The other reason I am docking this one star is a lack of real extras.  Come on, not even the original theatrical trailers?  Boo, Bandai, boo.

In conclusion, I give the Mobile Suit Gundam trilogy box set four stars because, while it has great actual content (a space war that is a real space WAR - with real people dying real deaths, with real drama and tragedy - and not a video game with cookie-cutter-black&white characters, fantasy physics and faceless minions being slaughtered by the truckload with no feeling whatsoever), it does not include the features that it claimed it would have.  For which Bandai should have a space colony dropped on them.",1223856000,,2260,4.64070351758794
2021727,5,B0001OGVTO,"My first foray into the world of ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" films was back in 1994 or so. A group of friends fansubtitled the anime series and we were all hooked. Nearly 15 years later, I pretty much forgotten about the series and storyline and if anything, with so many MSG releases since then, I felt a bit lost on the overall Universal Century line.

So, in 2008, I decided that I'm going to start from the beginning and watch everything Universal Century related and slowly purchase a lot of the releases (since DVD press copies for review were given out back in 2002 or so).

The first thing on my list was to obtain the films and there have been several releases. The first was the ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" Trilogy (released as a box set and the other in just a DVD case that holds three discs) and then a later version released in 2004 titled ""UC GUNDAM MOVIE PACK"" which contains the trilogy, the fourth film ""Char's Counterattack"" and the ""Mobile Suit Gundam 08th MS Team: Miller's Report"" OAV.

Both are a lot cheaper now and I was able to score the trilogy set pretty cheap.

As for those wondering what the films are about. Back in 1979 through 1980, there was the original 43-episode television series. In 1981, the series was condensed down to three films.

But the series has spawned many side stories, alternative universe stories, many manga, video games, model kits, toys...you name it, ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" is Japan's ""Star Wars"".

I have to say that what the staff was able to trim down to create three films from an original 43-episodes was pretty well done.

Of course, you lose a lot of the storyline from the original series and you lose probably some of the character development that goes into detail of relationships between characters.

But sticking to the core of the series which revolve around Amuro Ray, the crew of White Base, Char and the Principality of Zeon is intact and that is where the film succeeds.

There were some odd editing in two scenes from the third film where a scene didn't transition well to the next scene. Not sure if that was my DVD (scratch or dust, not sure) or how things originally were but all in all, to have a digitally remastered copy of the three films, let alone having a Dolby Digital 5.1 version of the audio is just fantastic.

If anything, this film has now made me want to purchase the original series and to see how much plot and character development that I'm actually missing.

As for the fourth film ""Char's Counterattack"", I have been told to watch Zeta Gundam first before watching it, so next step in my Gundam UC viewing list is ""Mobile Suit Z Gundam"" and will report on that later.

Anyway, you can find this trilogy or the separate film on DVD fairly cheap these days and who knows if the film will be coming out on Blu-Ray very soon. But if you are into mecha and want to check out the most successful mecha titles out there, I highly recommend checking out ""Mobile Suit Gundam"".",1218153600,,2950,4.524436090225564

I never watch dubs, they just can't seem to get the right emotions or tone of the original japanese.  Also, about 90 percent of dubs are from Canadian studios, so you get an all Canadian cast accents and all.  My biggest gripe of this set is the original sound fx have been replaced with generic explosions and other nondescript sounds.  This may sound trivial at first, but imagine if the Star Wars DVD set came out and the TIE fighters sounded like f-16 as they flew by.  Or all the laser blasts sounded like electric arcs rather than that familiar ping sound.  This is what the all important ""5.1"" remix did for this set.  As someone who watched the movies on tape with the original sound effects before DVD, the whole experience is ruined by this new mix.  The studio should have included an alternate audio track with the old mix on it.  There is a stereo mix, but it's just the new 5.1 mixed down to 2.0.  The same thing happened with Robotech Remastered by the way.  If you don't care about the sound effects being different then go ahead and pick it up.

It seems that this series is the only one you can enjoy his great work. (There are Gundam Z, Gundam ZZ series artwork by him to follow in Japan.  Unfortunatelly they are not available in USA yet.)  I hope you enjoy this trilogy.",1091232000,,557,4.565656565656566
2021768,5,B0001OGVTO,"Mobile Suit Gundam is the series that started the wildly popular Gundam series as well as the realistic robot anime genre.  It was originally planned as a 50-episode TV series, but it was canceled due to low ratings and its creator, Tomino, was forced to create an ending for the series after 43 episodes.  However, the show became very popular after reruns and in large part due to the movie compilations released a couple years after the original series.  This movie trilogy condensed the story of Mobile Suit Gundam into three roughly two-and-a-half hour movies, with somewhat improved animation and a few edits to eliminate the more hokey, unrealistic aspects of the series.  These movies were among the first Gundam merchandise released in America, and I must say, they are still impressive despite their age.
The first thing that struck me about the trilogy is the exceptional packaging.  Everything about this set screams quality.  The movies come in a blue box, with a cover showing the main characters of the series, as well as the Gundam's head.  This image, which is on both sides of the box, has a very nice foil finish, so it shines and glows, a nice touch.  The movies themselves have very well-drawn covers, and they too have the wonderful foil finish on both the front and back.  All in all, the box set looks classy and will make your other anime DVDs hide in shame.
The movies themselves outshine the spectacular packaging.  These movies are truly anime classics.  The animation is a bit dated, but if you can get over that, you'll find yourself engrossed in the world of Gundam.  The first two movies are a bit slow, as they develop the characters and show how they mature from being young, everyday people to soldiers who fight to survive.  The third movie is easily the best of the three, as it is incredibly fast-paced, more than making up for the slow nature of the other two movies.  The final movie is a breathtaking work rivaling even the best war stories.
But what really make the movie trilogy, as well as the original series, great are the characters.  Gundam has probably the most realistic characters in all of anime.  With the exception of (most) Newtypes, the characters are all very vernerable and in no way superhuman.  They all react very realistically to war and the horrors it brings.  The characters also behave realistically in that the soldiers on the ""bad"" side (the Principality of Zeon) do not act evil.  Instead, they are just regular, everyday people who fight because they have to.
One of the biggest joys I got out of this set was the music.  The original Gundam series did not have very impressive music or sound.  However, the movie trilogy includes updated music from the original series as well as brand new sound effects that sound far better than their TV series counterparts.  But the music is what really impressed me.  It still sounds very much like the music from the original series, yet the quality is far higher, and the result is a very pleasing musical score, though not quite up to par with the likes of Char's Counterattack.
As well as having new music, there is also new animation.  The original series did not age too well, and the animation is pretty crude.  However, much of the series has been overhauled, with new animation for the Guntank and Guncannon in the first movie, as well as 30% of the animation being new in Movie II and 70% in Movie III.  The new animation remains faithful to the original series, and does not look grossly out of place.
Some plot points have been changed in the movies, for better or worse.  One of the great changes was the replacement of the rediculous G-Armor with the sleak and smart Core Booster, a machine resembling a fighter with large laser cannons.  However, by watching the movies, you will not be getting the full story of the One Year War, as some of the finer points of the plot had to be cut to keep the movie at a reasonable length.  One of my major gripes is that White Base fails to fight in Operation Odessa in the movies, whereas it was instrumental in the Federation's victory in the original series.  For the most part, the plot works and still retains the essense of Gundam without some of the more rediculous plot arcs, but it also leaves out some important events.
There are no extras to speak of, other than an informational booklet that talks about changes made to the original series for the movie compilations.  The book is pretty informative, but it contains massive spoilers, so I recommend watching the movies before checking out the booklet.
The Mobile Suit Gundam trilogy is truly a masterpiece.  It is an incredible story of war, but moreso it focuses on the very human aspects of war, and that is one of the reasons it is such a timeless series.  The Gundam Movie Trilogy truly deserves a place among more well-known trilogies, such as Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.

2021770,5,B0001OGVTO,"I had to review when I saw that this has gotten some negative reviews. For shame, people, for shame.
Anyway, this is the original Mobile Suit Gundam; well, condensed into a 7 hour movie trilogy anyway. I'm going to be honest and say that sitting down and watching this for 7 hours does get pretty long, even for a diehard Gundam fan like myself. However, the animation is crisp and the voice actors are the original Japanese, as opposed to the cheap TV series and its even cheaper dub. So, whenever I want to watch MSG, not just a specific episode or moment from it, I choose the movies over the TV series.
Anyway, this anime has it all: war, politics, battles, romance, drama, even comedy. I am a teenage girl who by all rights should love Wing, but instead loves MSG. The characters are incredible; well-developed and totally realistic. And may I say that MSG's romances tend to be subtle, but they are simply awesome.
This was my first taste of the original Gundam, and after watching it I could not understand why people would say that it's good, but only a small taste of it. And after watching the TV series, I realized how right they were. Honestly, I enjoyed the TV series so much, and it covers a lot more than the movie does. So, if you want to be ""hardcore"" UC Gundam, I recommend watching the TV series. Try and stomach the dub.
But if you just want a nice amount of background information or even just a glimpse of what UC Gundam has to offer, this is an excellent source to tap. The animation may be from the 70's, but the story is a masterpiece.",1086393600,,1560,4.382758620689655

After seeing these machines in action, the earth realizes they need some too, after both sides,  lose half of their population, they sign an agreeement not to use poison gas, biologiacal weapons, etc. The earth finally gets its own set of mobile suits that are much more then a match for those of side 3, aka Zeon. this series is one of my favorites. there are unbelievable fighting scenes, as well as an interesting plot line. you can notice how each character changes as well. seeing the mechanical designs is amazing, this is worth the money",1082764800,,1389,4.935897435897436

The set is in general the three compiliaton films, each about 2 and a half hours the three compile the entire series into three movies (excluding some filler episodes) the animation, while I never rate a show by the animation, the animation here is great for the time, how ever the robots seem blocky at some times (Which explains why the old model kits look odd.) but who cares? The sound effects are standard also, but I LOVE THE SHIP EXPLODING SOUND FROM MOVIE 3, that large giant blast when ever a Musai or something takes it like a good girl. The characters are amazing and have great chemistry and effect each other profoundly, Amuro Rei, Angsty Whiny Teenage Protaginist Extrodinare, pilot of the RX-78-2 Gundam, the FIRST Gundam, Frau Bow, the standard Girl next door type girl, Char Aznable, one of anime's most famous villians and many, many, many other characters highlight the show, the entire franchise, not just this show, showcases the humman side of war, its not a game, and you can see it clearly in this show. Most of the Mech desings are amazing, some that really stand out are the Gundam, Gouf, Zaku II, Zgok, Zock, Zeong, GM, and many others.
This show was the first Real Robot show, meaning the robots were more like the future of tanks, rather then super heros.

2021814,5,B0001OGVTO,"A New Mobile Suit
When Cartoon Network announced that they would be airing the original Mobile Suit Gundam TV series, I was excited. The show that started it all, the great giant robot epic, the STAR WARS OF JAPAN. And then I watched it. I couldn't believe it. I was actually BORED. The animation was mediocre, the plot, slow, the characters, largely annoying. And don't get me started on the English voice-acting.
So you can imagine with what reluctance I purchased the Gundam Movie Trilogy on DVD. And what a surprise it was. Pretty much every complaint I had with the TV show was completely obliterated. The animation, even in the first Gundam movie, looked MUCH nicer. Maybe it was the DVD format, maybe the picture was cleaned up and restored...I don't know. All I know is, the animation looked WAY better. And remember all those redundant scenes (like the Gundam parts switching in mid-air) that were beginning to drive you mad? Gone. Remember those spread-out action scenes that happened just barely often enough to keep you watching? Now they're all part of the same battle, the action escalating and escalating until you're practically hyperventilating. And glory be, the characters seem more fully fleshed out too. And the plot improvements? A bit like replacing ""What are midichloreans?"" (hope I spelled that right) with ""The force is what gives a Jedi his power."" The sound effects, speech, and music were redone for the dvds as well. No words can describe the difference. What was cheesy or fake now sounds awesome. I kid you not.
Zeon Strikes Back
These DVDs do have one or two downsides. First, they're not exactly cheap. Secondly, there's almost no extras at all. No trailers, no making of documentary, no commentary. Nothing. And third, there's no English version of the speech. Now I can deal with that, but I really wish they had gone through the trouble to record a good English version of these movies. It really would have been the icing on the cake.
Then of course there is a bit of a boring lag in between the first and third Gundam movies. I know, I know, we get more insight into the characters and their motivations in the second movie. But compared to the gripping drama of the first and third movies (not to mention the awesome rivalry between Char and Amuro) the second movie is a bit slow-moving. For the movie with Char and Amuro on the cover, you'd think there would be more of the cool Amuro vs. Char action. Oh, well.
Return of the Newtype
Let's face it, great animation doesn't hurt. Great music and sound effects enhance everything. Good voice-acting helps a lot too. But what really makes for an engaging Mecha Saga is plot, action, and characterization. It's awful hard to get hooked when you don't care about the characters, the plot is boring and the action is comatose. Foretunately, the third Gundam movie delivers in these all-important ways, and features the best animation of the three movies as well.
In the third Gundam movie, everything comes to a head. Sayla confronts Char. Char and Amuro have a showdown. Mirai tries to decide who she loves. Complications of war and emotional turmoil tears at everyone. And every time you think the last battle is over, the action gets even more intense. It quite literally blew me away. In short, the Gundam movies succeed in every way.
If you loved the show, buy the movies. If you hated the show, buy the movies. If you love anything Gundam, buy the movies. These movies have a priviledged place on my shelf, ahead of Gundam Wing, Martian Successor Nadesico, and even the awesome Macross Saga.

Not only do six main characters kick the bucket, I estimate that 80% of the White Base's crew dies as well. the ship is destoryed, and thousands of federation soldiers die in a blast from a Death-Star like weapon.

The three movies aren't just a compilation of the TV series. The music has been redone, the animation beefed up and some new scenes have been added. Plus, somethings have been tinkered with. New mecha shows up, some just disappear and others just fade out of the picture. However, it does make the movie feel more new and less of a bargain package.
Sadly, the audio has been remixed as it was done with the TV series, but it's not done quite as worse. On a bright note, all the original voice actors came back in to do new recordings for the special edition. The sad part is there is no English dub included. There IS an English dub avalabe on VHS, but some consider it less than perfect so maybe it's a good thing they didn't include it.

2021817,5,B0001OGVTO,"After five years of loving Japanese Animation, I have seen only a handful of features that have both caught my conscious and heart. The Mobile Suit Gundam trilogy is in the select few that have done this to me. It rivals the brilliance of the Star Wars Trilogy(my 1st love) and films by barker, spielberg, and kubrick.
 The tale begins in a realistic future society, where humans have been forced into space colonies due to overpopulation. With the development of warfare, long-range weapons-systems are useless, henceforth the creation of mobile suits. With the gaining strength of the colonies, The Principlaity of Zeon have spurned a war of Independance from the Earth Federation. And so, the stage is set.
 To avoid spoiling the series for newbies, I'll describe the Gundam experience. The animation is old and looks like your high school art projects, but the plot and character/history/feel/political/philosophical/mecha design will captivate anyone. When I first watched these films, I was overtaken by the great intensity of emotion and depth each character experienced. Its standpoint on human nature gives insight to the human creature and its contant strife into tranformation into a being of space and expansion. The Mobile Suit Gundam Trilogy is highly reccomended for strangers of anime alike. FOR THOSE WHO PROCLAIM THEIR LOVE OF ANIME HAVE NOTHING TO BACK THEMSELVES WITH UNTIL THEY OWN THIS BOX SET.

I've seen these movies multiple times in mutliple formats over the years (I first saw these in 1985, dubbed on video, with no subtitles ^o^)...I have never seen them look this good. The picture is sharp, the color is rich and there isn't a hint of artifacting/glitching present.
The audio has been completely remastered and re-recorded! The weapons, explosions and effects are completely redone for this version and it sounds fantastic. There are both a Dolby 5.1 and Stereo audio tracks (both in Japanese, there is no English dub present) accompanied by well done and detailed subtitling...nothing is omitted...(even bkg speaking is included!)
The story is quintessential space opera. A war rages between the people of Earth and their colonies...but it's not a clear case of good guys and bad guys. Everything is not what it seems, intrigue and betrayal colors every event and the human drama serves as a vehicle for some amazing robot battles (rather than toy sales as is more common today).
I cannot endorse a classic piece of animation released in the US more strongly.

When I talk to people in my generation, they like the original GUNDAM a lot even now.  Boys are always boys.

If you like a lot of cool fighting and totally round characters in Char and Amuro, this is a great set to invest your money in.",1023840000,,552,4.475247524752476
2021871,5,B0001OGVTO,"First, let me get this out of the way, Mobile Suit Gundam is quite possibly my favorite anime ever. The original is superior to almost EVERY spin-off show, including the testosterone-y Gundam Wing, following the Gundam mythos. The only series that could possibly rival it in quality is Gundam 0083. It is a classic in every sense of the word.
  Condensing 42 episodes of a television series into three films a tough thing to do. Somehow, though, it works, and to some degree, to a higher extent than the television series. By eliminating some silly subplots that plagued the television show and strictly focusing on the major points of the series, the emphasis on the drama is drastically intensified. While the first two movies may seem a tad formuliac, the third makes up for this fully, offering one of the greatest expiriences in anime, the battle of A Bao Qu. This comes of with my highest recommendation.",1021766400,,910,4.789808917197452

2021873,5,B0001OGVTO,"Okay I've tried to write this review before but the computer goofed up... So here goes.

  First off This is the best Gundam out there, do your self a favor and give yourself time to get past the dated animatio, because once things get going believe me you'll think it's the way things are susposed to look.  These movies cover most of the events of the series with some new footage in the second and third movies.  Oh and they're long, but that's a good thing. Her's a brief summary of the events in the movies.
  The first movie is a litttle slow as it's all about setting things up, but don't worry there's still plenty of fighting.  The year is uc 0079. Side threee the duchy of Zeon is at a stalemate in a six month war with the EArth federation, despite it's Zaku II mobile suits.  Side 7 is host to the federations Mobile Suit devlopment project.  During a Zeon surviellance mission gone bad side 7 is attacked.  The gundam engineers and pilots are lost and Amuro Ray finds himself the fateful pilot of the mobile suit GUndam.  Despite his inexperienc the Zeon Zaku's pose him little trouble and are easily dispatched. The first mobile suit verses mobile suit battle goes well for the federation.  With Amuro piloting the gundam and civilians in charge of white base the fed mecha carrier.  Cha aznable Zeon ace pilot forces them down into Zeon controlled territory.
This movie focuses on the hopless situation of white base as they fight for thier lives on the way to Jaburo the fedration H.Q in south America. It also focuses on the growing rivalry between char and amuro, Amuro's interest in Lt. Matilda ( who at times seems to be the only one in the federation who cares about white base.) As for action let's say by the end of the movie White base has a bounty on it , and the legendary Zeon Commando ramba ral on thier tails. Oh and th federation isn't the only one with new mobile suits.  4 stars
  The second movie is the sad one as several beloved main characters friend and foe bite the dust.  Despite being pursued by a Zeon Combat unit headed by Ramba Ral, White base is commanded to participate in operation Odessa, since the federation suspects them of being new types(Super soldiers with advanced powers of perception.)  Seyla tries to find out if Char is her brother commandeers the gundam onmly to nearly get herself killed and tossed in the brig.  Amuro deserts with the gundam , some of his fits are painful to watch, but his brig time and encounter with Ramba RAl finally force him to grow up.
In addition to great story telling this movie has several memorable battles.  Ramba Rals hand to hand combat invasion of white base, the confrontation with the Black Tri-Stars, and the Zeon invasion of Jaburo. The latter of which has the best combat musical scor in the series. 4 stars.
The third movie is all about resloution the fall of zeon and all the butt kickin on the way.  It's starts with white base being pursued by Char aznable pursuing white base and Gundam dispatching his advanced fleet.  Afer a shor stop by side 6 where the new type girl lala is introduced it's on to the Zeon base of solomon and a major decisive battle, ending with the awesome firing of the solar ray, the most enrgy efficient weapon of mass distruction ever.  The big Zam is... well you'll just have to see it. this movie wraps up the loose ends and the war and to be honest too much happens to reveiw it  alll in the space provided, but you won't be disapointed. 5 stars.
 If you can't afford the 60+ episode series the movies are the best way to go, I have no info on the DVD extras but past gundam dvd's have excelled in this area.  3 3 hour movies 54.99 can't argue. See you after the show.",1018915200,,3701,4.428360413589365

2021876,5,B0001OGVTO,"The saga that created many spin-oofs shows,OVAs,model kits,movies,t-shirts,comics,and other items is in America. The three movies are based on the origenal 42 ep. msg series released in 1979. But in 1981 the creators put all the info from the show in to a six houre movie trilage. Even thou much of the origenal seares was cut out for time the movies still rock. This saga is about when side 3 calls it self the independent duchy of ZEON. The duchy beggins a war of indepndence agents the federation of earth. The war beggins in january 0079 UC. After six mounths both sides have lost almost half of their population.

To start this  trail, I would highly recomend this set. Once you've seen it you can watch  Gundam 0080, 0083, and any other Gundam Series that takes place in the UC  Timeline.
Non-Gundam Fan (but soon to be)'s reason to buy: Ok, get  passed the animation that isn't as good as those ""disney movies""  and you'll love this classic piece of work. It's a truelly believeable war  between the colonies in space and the Federation of Earth. I don't want to  spoil anything, but I'll tell you that Gundam takes many ideas from  different Sci-Fi things and turns it into a classic piece of Animation. The  first movie will introduce you, the second movie will make you feel like  you know the characters, and the third movie takes everything and creates a  masterpiece, chresihed for generations.

2021879,5,B0001OGVTO,"I recently purchased this and was very happy.  I think the animation and the story really holds up well and is as exciting and moving as it was when it first came out.  You've got great characters--Amuro, the young boy who  is forced by circumstances into war and battles for his life as a gifted  pilot of the first Gundam, and his enemy, the enigmatic Char, who totally  plays his own game in the coolest way possible, and the young crew of a  ship who are thrown together and have to deal with the war along with  Amuro...  Lots of action, pathos, adventure, treachery...  What more can  you ask for?  It's gotten me back into watching Anime (like Gundam Wing).  I'd highly recommend it for anyone's anime collection.",964051200,,720,4.5390625
2021900,5,B0001OGVTO,"First of all, this movie has nothing to do with the recently popular series Gundam Wing. Gundam Wing is set in an alternate reality to Mobile Suit Gundam. Once you get past that premise, it is an excellent movie. From  the acclaimed creator of Gundam Wing, Aura Battler Dunbine, and Garzey's  Wing comes a memorable story of action, adventure, and intrigue. The Dutchy  of Zeon has broken free from the Earth Federation, and the only things  standing in the way of thier Mobile Suits are the crew of the warship White  Base and its trio of mobile suits: the RX-78-2 Gundam, the RX-77 Guncannon,  and the RX-75 Guntank. This movie trilogy was compiled from a 42 episode  Japanese TV show, so many of the great battles of the original anime have  been removed to shorten the film. However, if you have already seen the TV  show, see the movies anyway, because 30% of the material in the second  movie and 70% of the material in the third movie is new. If you aren't  going to be upset because the movies have nothing to do with Gundam Wing,  make this anime yours!",961372800,,1062,4.50261780104712

they condensed the 40 some  episode series (20hours) into 7 hours. (about half) they cut out all the  unessential parts making a action packed peice of art.

8015604,3,B0001OGVTO,"If you're wanting to get a start in the Mobile Suit Gundam Franchise, I highly recommend watching the English dubbed series, as opposed to these films.

If all you're into is ""checking"" the original off of a watch list, this isn't a bad option, but these movies, being a condensed version of the show, have pretty bad pacing across the board. They're long, clocking in at around over 2 hours each, and the non-episodic format doesn't allow for some of the bigger moments of the show to really shine and get their moment. Though there are admittedly some improved and additional animations, I don't find it to be worth the poor structuring of the story.

Also, if you plan on watching the series in English, I would very heavily recommend avoiding these films, and watch the series instead. The dub for the films is astonishingly... not great, especially when compared to the dub of the show. I love Steve Blum as much as the next person. His voice is silky smooth, 99% of the time. The other 1% would be his performance in this, though I don't 100% blame Steve Blum himself for the poor performance, but rather the entire dub team, casting directors, and recording directors.

It is also worth nothing that if you plan to watch the sequel series, the dubbed show lines up more with the dubbed version of Zeta than the dubbed movie trilogy does.",1490659200,,1344,4.615062761506276
