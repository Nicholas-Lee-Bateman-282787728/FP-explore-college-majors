2072605,3,B00029RT9E,"The movie sounds pretty good, I never listen to reviews from critics; I prefer to form my own opinion.  I am a Russell Wong admirer and I really want to see the movie to see him.  I do like Samuel Jackson, Andy Garcia and of course Ashley Judd.  They are all fine actors.  I am very anxious for the DVD to be made available.  Thanks",1084838400,2,332,4.046153846153846
2072606,3,B00029RT9E,"The trailer promised so much more.  How could you go wrong with Ashley Judd playing a cop who bangs every hot guy she meets in the roughest bar in town and then finds them dead as part of her SFPD homicide duties?  Well, somehow TWISTED is as good as an ABC Sunday night movie.
Judd is a sex addict and an alcoholic, haunted by the violent deaths of her parents.  Her mother was a slut too, and her father apparently killed several of her lovers before wasting his wife and them himself.  As her father was also an SFPD cop, this frustrates Judd to no end.
After the deaths of her parents, Judd was taken in by her father's partner, Samuel L. Jackson.  Judd drinks, passes out, and finds the bodies of former sex partners.  All you have to do is figure out who in her life is killing all her lovers.  He also killed her parents.  Surprise, surprise.
Enjoyable, because Judd is poetry in motion.  Maybe you should wait and rent it when it comes out on DVD in a couple of months.",1079827200,5,977,4.266304347826087
2072607,3,B00029RT9E,"I like thrillers.  I would really rate this a 2 and a 1/2 but I gave it a three just to be nice. Very unreal. There's no way a newly promoted cop would get as much slack as Ashley Judd does in the movie, especially with the family connection. If you want to feel smart watch this movie cause if you really pay attention you can pick the killer right at the beginning of the movie otherwise you'll have it easily before the disappointing ending.",1079740800,2,444,4.223529411764706
2072608,2,B00029RT9E,"Although I wasn't too impressed with the ""Twisted"" previews, when I saw that Philip Kaufman directed it, I fairly flew into the theater on opening day.  Is this the same Philip Kaufman who directed excellent masterpieces like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"", and ""The Right Stuff""?  If it is, I fear he's been replaced by a pod person.  And what did high-grade stars like Ashley Judd, Andy Garcia, and Samuel L. Jackson think when they read this poorly thought-out script?
The story, about a newly-promoted homicide cop (Judd) who has peculiar sexual habits and then discovers that, one-by-one, her gentlemen partners are getting beaten to death, does have potential, and one can imagine what someone like Hitchcock could have done with it.  But the screenplay and direction are so cliche-ridden and unbelievable, it was truly hard to not laugh all the way through it.  There was a moment, when I considered that maybe it was supposed to be a spoof.
Humorous moments include Judd's Jessica character repeatedly getting polluted, passing out, and then jumping off the sofa to run immediately to the scene of a crime, without so much as brushing her teeth, but all the while looking like her usual knock-out, gorgeous self. When Jessica comes clean to her superior (Jackson) about her realtionship with the victims, does he think that maybe he should at least TRY to take her off the case, especially since all the bodies are ""signed"" with a cigarette burn, and Jessica constantly keeps a unlit cigarette with her that she never smokes but taps furiously on tables?  Then there's the repeated shots of Jessica's elderly, Oriental neighbor gawking at her through the window, that's thrown into the movie only to go nowhere.
Oh, yes, there is also the rest of the San Francisco police department, played by a cast of ""actors"" who must surely have gotten their parts because they're related to one or more of the producers.  Their portrayals of police officers are the most politically incorrect and boorish charicatures you're likely ever to see on the screen.  One of the guys, who gives Judd a particularly hard time all through the film, does a turn-around at the end that only a dime-store trash novelist could dream up.  The climax and resolution is a fiesta of incredulous humor.
I did give the movie two stars: One for Ashley, because she does try her best and looks great; and another star for the beautiful ""City by the Bay"" scenery.",1078099200,46,2476,4.876190476190477
2072609,2,B00029RT9E,"Our plan was to go see ""Monster"" this afternoon but we live in the sort of place where a movie like that gets shown only at night so that they can run some kid friendly movie during the day (we have a limited number of screens up here in the Zenith City).  So we decided to go see ""Twisted"" instead because I happened to catch Samuel L. Jackson on the CBS morning show last Friday.  Jackson, who found out that he is the best selling movie actor on DVDs, said he did the script because he never saw the ending coming.  If that is true, then either they did some major changes in Sarah Thorp's script by the time the film was finished or Jackson has been making too many movies and needs a break because everybody saw this one coming.
""Twisted"" is set in San Francisco, where Jessica Shepard (Ashley Judd) has just caught a big time bad guy, been promoted to inspected, and assigned to the homicide department. She also has made a habit of picking up strange guys in bars, going to their apartments for some rough sex, and then going home and drinking wine until she passes out.  It turns out that when she was a kid her father, who was also a cop, went on a killing spree before killing her mother and then shot himself.  Jessica was raised by her dad's partner, John Mills (Jackson), who is now the police commissioner.  At her new job she has a new partner, Mike Delmarco (Andy Garcia), and on their first case they find a body that has been savagely beaten and washed up from the Bay.  It happens to be one of her one-night stands.  Then another body pops up, with the same tell tale brand, and it turns out she slept with this guy too.
The rule with a film like this is that to play fair the murderer has to be above the title in the credits, which means we have only three suspects.  We do not see the murders so we know that it cannot be somebody we have not seen and there is only one other remote possibility in the rest of the cast.  But then I am afraid that based on the description of the film in the previous paragraph I probably gave you enough information to figure out who the identity of the killer.  If I have indeed done so I think that rather than apologizing you should thank me, because going to see an Oscar nominated film that you have already seen would be more worthwhile than spending time and money on this one.  Wait for it to come out on DVD so that you do not feel like you have been taken for such a ride.
Because she took one free shot against a psycho that was trying to kill her, Shepard has to go see a department shrink (David Strathairn), who attends his sessions wearing a gun.  Of course he wants to deal with the fact that she tells everybody her parents were killed in a car accident instead of rehashing the horrible truth and she feels no pressing need to talk about the fact she keeps passing out at night and wakes up the next morning to learn about another dead body being checked off the list of her former lovers.  But then the S.F.P.D. as a whole is not too bright: when the third victim pops up with the same connection they have Shepard's partner interview her for 5 minutes.  Either (a) she is the killer or (b) the killer is someone she knows or who know here.  Either way, a detailed examination of her life and habits would be in order.
For writing the cops as being stupid ""Twisted"" loses an additional star to go along with the two it loses for being so easy to figure out.  The second sin is the greater offense, especially with ""Twisted"" coming at a time where so many films have been successfully playing mind games with characters and audiences.  When you think of films like ""Fight Club,"" ""Memento,"" ""The Matchstick Men,"" and other films of that type, even if they did not succeed in completely fooling you at least they were ambitious in the attempt.  With ""Twisted"" I could not even find any good reasons not to think that it was who it obviously was, especially when the clue is just overacting..
I know this is the highest rating anybody has given this review to date, but I have a long- standing policy of saving one stars for reviews of snuff films.",1078012800,9,4118,4.290322580645161
2072610,1,B00029RT9E,"""Twisted"" is a howler, a straight-to-video script with three good actors - Ashley Judd, Samuel L. Jackson and Andy Garcia - turning in the worst performances of their career and one pedigree director - Philip Kaufman - shooting a few pretty scenes of San Francisco and then apparently calling it a day. Paramount dumped the movie in late February to catch a few wayward moviegoers suckered by the trailer; instead the studio finds itself up against Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ,"" robbing Judd of her fan base of young, impressionable southern women. That demographic should take heed: This is no ""Kiss The Girls"" or ""Double Jeopardy."" It's not even ""High Crimes,"" a more apt title for these lost two hours.
Judd, flouting about in a boy's haircut again - no actress gets more mileage out of the exact same look - plays Jessica, a San Fran homicide inspector working her first case with grizzled, creepy partner Mike (Garcia). The murders are the work of a serial killer who burns victims on the hand with a cigarette then beats them to death.
The hitch? Every dead guy has had a rough, nameless one-night stand with Jessica, who gulps red wine and conveniently blacks out on the night of the murders from intoxication. The police chief (Jackson) has an interest in seeing Jessica succeed; he has raised the girl since her father, a cop himself, went on a killing spree, shot his wife, then committed suicide. Is Jessica working out her rage during the blackouts? Is it another pining for Jessica's affections? ""Twisted"" provides about nine possibilities.
The screenplay, by Sarah Thorp, raises the stakes in the poker game of tin ears. A lawyer threatens to attack Jessica ""with both guns blazing!"" Another character exclaims ""they put me on the no access list!""  The killer, whom I will not reveal, seethes, ""I did this for you!"" Another murderer who has no relation to the central plot whispers, ""You're just like me!"" Jackson's character refers to himself as the ""master"" and likes to preface lines of dialogue with the word ""Test!""
Basically an exercise in red herrings, Thorp supplies Jessica with a cigarette she does not smoke and Mike, who presumably makes six figures, with a dingy houseboat that might double as a murder house. There are creepy dreams, whispers in the night, voices in the wind, a box stuffed with childhood dolls and murder photos, harassing cops down at the precinct, a crazy ex-lover, an elderly Chinese neighbor in the window, numerous allusions to seals, and a shrink (David Strathairn) who prods Jessica for emotional truth and might as well be listed as ""Filler"" in the credits.
Well, ""Twisted"" is just an awful motion picture, coherent but preposterous, riddled with the kind of coincidences and misunderstandings only teen comedies usually suffer. Judd, who strode confidently into the movie business with ""Ruby In Paradise"" and ""Normal Life,"" now seems perfectly content to play the same tomboy sweetheart again and again, all false trust and feisty vulnerability, wounded and bamboozled. She's still cute and quick with a look, but pluck at 35 plays a little different than pluck at 27. Garcia has simply morphed into a ham; he clearly loves it, and will eventually find a role that suits that lifestyle choice. Jackson is an embarrassment in an embarrassing role. Are the parts in ""Basic,"" ""xXx"" and this movie the ones he wants to make sure rappers don't get?",1077926400,21,3410,4.909878682842288

2072662,1,B00029RT9E,"Twisted, 2004 film

A young policewoman is promoted to detective in the San Francisco Police Department. Her title is Inspector. A dead man is found floating in the harbor, he has a cigarette burn on the back of his left hand, post mortem. Then another body is found with the same cigarette burn. Inspector Jessica Shepherd opines it was a serial killer. She is told she is guessing. Later her comment is verified. There is a complication. Jessica had met each man earlier for a one-night stand. The police question a bar owner. He says he saw the victim with the policewoman! When she returns home she finds a man in her place, she pushes him away with force! He says he is a psychopath.

A blood sample can identify the murderer once they catch him (or her). She suspects her partner told on her, he denies it. When she visits Frank she finds him dead in his hot tub! She talks to her psychiatrist about this; she slept with the victim who was her chief suspect. She has a nightmare where she shoots the men. She visits the crime lab to ask them to analyze a blood sample. Lisa makes a phone call. At home in her bathtub she hears a noise at the door. Jimmy visits her, he wants to spend the night there to guard her. But she is afraid of him! When she awakes she finds him dead in bed! She has no recollection of where she was on the nights these three men were murdered.

Jessica had Rohypnol in her blood stream! This would prevent her from doing the last murder. Only her partner knew where she was on those nights. Mike is questioned about his activities. Did someone plant evidence on Mike? There is a shocking surprise at the end! [Did you see this coming?] There is a confession at the end. Will the judge cut him some slack? There is a threat, Jessica fires her pistol. Then the police arrive to clean up the mess. Jessica and Mike are reconciled for a happy ending.

Seems like the reviews comprise a  ""mini clone"" of what's happening in the movie: men don't like to be ""topped"" by a strong woman and are frightend to see a  strong woman movie star kicking a man in the nuts when he deserves it (how humiliiating, eh?)  Alas, woman who aren't movie stars still have to prove themselves every day to some men who try to preserve their fragille egoes at all cost.

It's almost too bad it wasn't just a smidge worse because then it could at least have been decent camp.

As it stands, however, this is a movie for those who don't care about plot credibility or good scripting but who love movies in which Ms. Judd perserveres against the odds with the aid of an older black character (well, in this case he's not really a lot of help)in a sort of ""Perils of Pauline"" universe.

She's got a lot to prove since her Dad was a serial killer who ended his spate of deaths by killing Jessica's Mom and then himself.

But, she's got the Police Commissioner (Jackson) on her side.  John Mills (Jackson) took the 6-year-old orphan of his former partner and raised her to be the best cop around.  He predicts Jessica will be the next Police Chief.

But, Jessica's got a dark secret.  She's haunted by her father's actions and she's burying those ghosts with alcohol and sexual encounters.

When her former sexual partners start showing up dead and she's having blank spells, Jessica and most everyone else suspect her of being the killer.  But is she?

While ""Twisted"" is weak in some areas, the mystery is still there. This is one of the better acting jobs by Judd, who really goes from luminous to haunted in the space of a few minutes.

2072754,2,B00029RT9E,"Twisted starts well but gets looser when it should get tighter and increasingly improbable just when plot twists should have us wondering how we could have missed the clues.  Instead we wonder, did the writer of this screenplay paint himself into a corner so tight that he had to have workers saw off the top of his house and lower a rope to extricate him from his predicament?  In this regard Twisted is like No Way Out in which Kevin Costner was out-acted by his uniform.  Costner, if you recall, is pulled deeper and deeper into espionage and intrigue.  It's quite good, despite Costner's involvement, until the very end.  The reveal, the explanation behind every devious turn we've seen up until that point, is virtually impossible - it has the statistical likelihood of discovering an honest lawyer.

The premise, and cast, of Twisted are first rate.  Ashley Judd is the protagonist.  As newly promoted Detective Jessica Shepard she combines two-fisted machismo - fetching in her black wife-beater t-shirt - and lonely vulnerability - haunted, alcoholic, and alone.  But hey, no wonder she's alone, the apes she drags home for demeaning one night stands have a habit of ending up dead, and before long she's the prime suspect in her own murder investigation.  How awkward!  Quite the pickle for the new girl on the squad, no wonder her colleagues are so tough on her.  But wait, she has a secret.  Her dad, who was also a cop, developed cheese-slipped-off-cracker syndrome and went on a killing spree before doing himself in.  She pores over newspaper clippings, or pours over them, and drinks herself into blackouts.  Is it possible she's killing her lovers during blackouts and forgetting it?  Is it possible she's inherited her father's cursed genes?

It's an interesting set-up, and better movies have been made out of less.  Judd does a very good job, especially considering the improbability of the situation.  Andy Garcia, another talent, is convincing as her partner - he's understandably concerned - for her and himself.  David Strathairn, a terrific actor, doesn't get to help Jessica, or the movie, much.  As her psychiatrist he does get to mention that she might want to cut back on her drinking a bit - $160 an hour for that scary insight?!  But the loose canon in this movie is John Mills, played by Samuel Jackson.  Mills took over in loco parentis when Jessica's dad died, with emphasis on the loco.  As mastermind super cop he groomed the young Jessica.  It shows; she is the grasshopper who now outperforms the big guys and is ready to leave the temple.  But there is something about Mills that is oddly detached; he is both Jessica's staunchest defender and toughest critic.  Don't fear, all is revealed in the third act.

Spoiler?  I hardly know her!  Let's just say that the denouement of this movie is so glib, facile, lazy, and unlikely that it would have been more believable if Kevin Costner and Sean Young had wandered onto the set wearing their No Way Outfits and confessed to the crimes themselves.",1197676800,2,3031,4.829126213592233
2072755,2,B00029RT9E,"Given its director's status and the stellar cast audiences were entitled to expect a lot more than this movie actually delivers .It is mediocre rather than downright bad and is hampered by a repetitive plot structure ,a scarcity of suspects and too little actual action .It is not visceral enough to be  strong thriller or cerebral enough to work as a whodunnit.
The setting is San Francisco  ,a city where a number of deaths are being reported -men battered to death with cigarette burns to their  hands . The protagonist is Jessica Shepherd a cop  on the homicide squad .She is ambitious ,ruthless -borderline psychotic almost .Her family background was troubled ,her father having killed her mother and her private life is a little messy .She has a penchent for picking up starngers in bars ,having rough anonymous sex with them and walking away without any emotional involvement whatsoever. Her mentor is Police Commissioner Mills -played by Samuel L Jackson -who has steered her career till she becomes the first  female member of Homicide (In politically correct San Francisco ? That is the most unbelievable part of the movie !)

Her colleagues are hostile apart from her new partner(Andy Garcia) .Her life begins to unravel -both personally and professionally -when some of the men she picks up and sleeps with turn up dead .The pattern of the movie begins to get very samey about this point in proceedings -she drinks to excess,picks up a guy in a bar ,passes out and wakes up to the news that a new death has been reported ,and in one instance to an actual body in her bed .She becomes a prime suspect in the killings

The question is -who is the killer ?Jessica ,maybe or the Commissioner whose interest in her and her career may have overstep[ped the bounds .perhaps its her partner mwho seems obsesssed with her;perhaps another cop on the force ,jealous of her advancement

You may find yourself too bored to care thanks to a trite and predictable script ,and acataing which is no more than OK and a dull working out of the conflicts. San Francisco looks lovely but unfortuinately some rather dull action situations preclude a proper enjoyment of the scenery!

Samuel Jackson, Ashley Judd and Andy Garcia, the latter whom

the end of the movie, doing a fine job.

Avoiding to spoil this thriller, clearly SJ does a fine acting

this movie, playing an alcoholic, attitude-filled, gutsy police

detective, with a number of other flaws, such as ease with

which she moves from lover to lover. Within her own limits, Judd

demonstrates a very good, but not exceptional, acting performance.

For those, like myself, who enjoy movies who take you to another

time and space, for 1 hour and a half, this work is an acceptable

rental choice, if only to see the main actors playing characters

that are out of the ordinary, taking risks in terms of how far

they can remain credible playing difficult characters.

filming and on-location shots took a long time to prepare. This seems

to be the case for most of those in the movie, except for a few, such

It could be the reason was explained but I just missed it because the movie was so terrible. I don't know. I really don't want to have to watch the whole movie again to figure it out.

I know if you have a lot of high profile actors in secondary roles, one of them is the killer for sure; but you're thrown off by the fact that you have Andy Garcia, D.W. Moffett, and Sam L. Jackson. So all 3 are fair game.",1152489600,5,899,4.1257142857142854
2072772,2,B00029RT9E,"There are just two rules when you create a thriller with a pretty lead: 1) The lead (the delectable Ashley Judd) had better show some skin. 2) Thou shalt not be boring.

Twisted utterly fails on both counts.  Basically, Judd is Jessica Shepard, a messed up cop who specializes in hunting serial killers.  She's fond of bedding men she meets at late night bars, because she's self-destructive.  Only Jessica looks fabulous all the time, even when she's been on a bender (which is apparently every night).  How she maintains her good looks without stinking up the place is just another part of cinema magic.

Jessica is mentored by John Mills (Samuel L. Jackson).  For a second there I thought Jackson was going to play an understated version of his usual maniacal self.  I was wrong.

Things take a turn for the strange after Jessica discovers that every man she sleeps with is murdered.  And she keeps having these weird blackouts every night.  The victims wash up on the shore the next day with a single cigarette burn on their hand.  Poor Jessica is haunted by her parents' murder/suicide and wonders...since her father went on a mass-murdering spree before he killed himself, could she too have the ""serial killer gene""?

Jessica is paired with Mike Delmarco (Andy Garcia), an Italian goomba who is alternately creepy, lecherous, and like everyone else in this ridiculous movie, wants to get into her pants.  Mike follows her around an awful lot...could HE be the killer?  Or maybe it's the ex-boyfriend cop, Jimmy Schmidt (Mark Pellegrino).  Or maybe it's...actually, I figured it out in the first ten minutes.

Being something of a true crime fan, and having read a bit on the subject, this entire premise is absurd. You don't wake up one day and become a serial killer; if anyone actually got a good look at the life of a serial killer, it screams DANGER from day one.  Pretty Jessica has none of those problems in her past, except for a vague ""suppressed rage"" that manifests itself in kinky sex and kicking people in the face.  Her cherubic face shows no signs of hardship, and neither does the rest of her. Although the script wants us to believe she's a haggard cop, the camera is only too happy to zoom in on her rear end.  Not once, but twice.  And it's not a naked rear end either.

So we have a gorgeous female cop who sleeps around, yet there are very few bedroom scenes.  We have a serial killer plot that is connected by red herrings (Who is that lady across the street?  Why does Jessica fiddle with a cigarette but never light it?).  On one hand, the cops are strictly by the book; they make a big deal out of the fact that Jessica kicks a serial killer in the face.  On the other hand, nobody pulls Jessica off the case when she's a prime suspect, nor watch her home when the serial killer is obviously following her around.

Judd plays a police officer who begins investigating a series of murders... all of whom are men. Samuel L. Jackson also has a role in this movie as her trusting friend. When it is discovered that every murder victom was someone that Judd had slept with, she ends up becoming a suspect in the very case she is working on to solve. This movie will keep you guessing.

Twisted is poorly written and losely held to gether by okay acting. Seems the actors were doing the best they could with what they had. I have no doubt the producers and director felt the story had potential but they failed to realize that with this production.

The film's ending holds an interesting twist but too many lose ends are left to the viewers imagination. My vote? Just okay, nothing to write home about.",1132617600,,650,4.547008547008547
2072775,3,B00029RT9E,"I was considering either 2 or 3 stars, then settled on 3 because they don't let you give 2 1/2 and the film did keep my attention.

The thing that surprised me was how badly the movie got slammed by not only the customer reviewers but also the professional reviewer.  It really isn't any worse than most of the other movies out these days.

I have a theory.  I think the reason that this movie gets so violently trashed is that Ashley Judd plays a cop who sleeps around a lot.  Cops are supposed to be respected more than that.  I suspect that is the whole reason that people slam the movie so hard.  They don't want to accept a character like that, a female cop who is promiscuous.  They find it offensive.

The problem with that is that there is no profession better known for promiscuity than police.  Possible exception - flight attendants.  Police and flight attendants.  So what we have here is a double standard.  It's ok for a male cop to be promiscuous, and they have a reputation for it, but it's not ok to say so, or to have a female cop who is promiscuous.  I think a large part of the population would fit right in with the Muslims of Afghanistan.

The movie itself really isn't that great.  It was obvious from the start that one of Ashley's cop friends was the killer.  It was either her ex boyfriend, her new partner, or her mentor.  But as I said, it did hold my interest, and it isn't as bad as a lot of other movies out these days.  I don't mind at all that the female cop is promiscuous.  That's her problem, and I don't condemn her for it.  I really don't care.

I found the Ashley Judd fight scenes to be unbelievable.  She's pretty tough in this movie but I know I could take her, and I'm not that good.  She was utterly unconvincing as Ms. Tough Guy.  The little moves they have her doing at the start of the film look like they will only work if the opponent stands there and waits for it to happen.

If they wanted to give us a realistic fight scene, with Ashley defending herself against armed rape, they would have given us a much messier scene, not a choreographed little flip and a neat little turnaround.  It would have been a struggle and a mess, like reality.  But they weren't interested in making the scene real.  They were giving us Ms. Batman.  Whatever.",1129420800,,2291,4.297423887587822
2072776,1,B00029RT9E,"That should have been the title of this movie as it describes the use that the talents of a high-profile cast & normally respectable director are put to.  Another possible title is ""It's All About the Groceries"", 'cause I'm hard-pressed to think of a reason, other than money, why anybody involved would've signed on to this project.

It starts promisingly, with atmospheric shots of the Golden Gate Bridge rising through fog over San Francisco.  The camera plunges through the fog to hone in on the image of a knife being held to a woman's throat. Once again, Ashley Judd is a victim in jeopardy . . .so it seems.  Then the 'victim' proceeds to open a can of whoop-a** all over the perpetrator and beats him to a bloody pulp.  One starts to think that this might be getting good, especially after Ashley's apparently super-competent police detective is revealed to have anger issues, a pretty hefty drinking problem, a propensity for picking up strangers in bars & having rough sex with them . . .and some grisly skeletons in her closet.  I was interested to see what Judd would do with this opportunity to play a character with a dark side instead of her usual noble victim.  Unfortunately, not enough.  Ms. Judd is a luminously beautiful actress, even with a severe short haircut meant to make her look tough, I suppose. It is not hard to believe that men would be drawn to her like bugs to a flame.  She has not developed the range of emotion to really carry a complex character like Jessica, though, playing it distressingly one-note.  Is she ecstatic?  Depressed?  In a drug-induced stupor?  The way Judd plays it, it could be any, or all, of the above.  I like Ashley Judd, but she is in danger of turning into the female version of Richard Gere--a performer with real potential who keeps choosing flashy junk-food roles that do not challenge her talent.  ""Kiss the Girls"" was the high-water mark & each subsequent film has been weaker than the last.

2072797,3,B00029RT9E,"The first thing I noticed watching this film is the utterly cliche manner in which Ashley Judd's character, Jessica, is introduced. You know the story- beautiful, tough female cop who can handle herself on the streets is plagued by her past and criticized by her jealous male coworkers.

Sound familiar? Yeah, like about 50 other female detective movies out there.

The second thing I noticed was the way the film is edited- very, very choppy. Scenes are slapped together, juxtaposed against each other in what often seems like random order. In some films, that is an effective technique, but in this one the viewer is left wondering what just happened. You get the feeling like way too much footage was shot and the story had to be chopped up to make it fit into a reasonable feature length.

There are also some ""Huh?"" moments in the film, where the characters do things for seemingly unexplainable reasons- like when Jessica wanders around a park, between Greco-Roman pillars for a while, looking confused. No one knows why. That is one of several ""Why'd they do that?"" moments in this film.

All in all, it is a decent mindless piece of entertainment, with CSI-style coroner scenes that won't offend most people. The story, despite its choppy nature does all come together, more or less, in the end. The acting is over the top, in all cases, but can be forgiven in light of the fact that SOMETHING had to be done to save the storyline. Sometimes watching overacting is fun, in a campy sort of way.

Why couldn't I guess where this was going, but I could figure out every other movie I've ever seen in the first five minutes?  I don't know.  Perhaps this one is too off the wall, or perhaps because it's actually very predictable... but in too many ways simultaneously.  Perhaps it has TOO MANY cliches, too many possible obvious developments, too many paths... so many that you aren't sure which path the writers will take... and then that path appears to have several possible branches, etc.  It really kept me guessing the whole way through.  Perhaps you'd rather just passively watch a movie... or perhaps like me you're tempted to figure it out early.

Back when she drug all my sensibilities through the mud with EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, I took a small solace in the assurance that a movie couldn't get any worse than that. But now ghastly Ashley has proven me wrong. I think I'd rather see her play an acknowledged serial killer (however much the the movie pussyfoots around in moral ambiguity about it) than see an equally mad woman legitimized as a cop. Yep, a cop. That's what she plays this time. I guess I must admit EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, as vacuous as it is, seduced me somewhat with Ashley's macabre sick puppy persona. It made me really want to see her get better. Something inside me wanted to see her use her talents (which are nothing if not far above her will to make decent movies) to do something really worthwhile and elevating. So guess that is why I threw caution to the wind and went to see TWISTED. But the cop she plays therein never saw a civil liberty that she wasn't fixing to ravenously trample upon. In the opening scenes, she is arresting a suspect. After she has his hands cuffed behind his back and him helplessly onto his knees, she says, ""One more thing!"" and then kicks him in the nose as hard as she can! Story resolved, or at least it should have been. Time for this cop to go the way of the beaters of Rodney King. We still do believe that Rodney King was wrongly treated, don't we? Apparently not, if even the limited credibility that this movie has usurped is any indication. She goes on being a cop and treated as the movie's hero! But her unrestrained rampage is by no means over. She will become quite understably a suspect in the murders she's investigating. But she will madly assault her colleagues when they sugggest that it is understandable that she's become a suspect. For better or for worse, the movie never suggests any ""turn about's fair play"" notion. While she's a suspect nobody ever kicks her in the nose. The movie goes on through a supposed resolution that cannot at all dig this lurid misfire out of the hole of its premise. While the original real villain of the movie proved herself villainous from practically the start, but gets to go on to be ""vindicated"" as a ""hero"", the ""real villain"" gets exposed as a villain only in the end.

Come on, Ashley Judd plays a tormented victim (again), being stalked by a killer (again), and she has to find out who this person is so she can save the day (again). PUHLEEZE! That's what makes this movie so weak, not the acting. Another thing, Sam Jackson....What were you thinking? I can't believe he wasted his talent too with this disasterous movie. This movie definitely wasn't up to par with his reputation. If that's the best they could come up with, what they could've done is remove Sam Jackson, add Morgan Freeman, and make Dr. Alex Cross the killer so we can end this tragedy now.

The movie and all characters, Sammuel L. Jackson, and Garcia, and those I did not name did a great performance.  Usually, I am good at figuring out who is the killer at least the first half hour of the movie, but on this one it had me guessing the whole way to the end.

Apart from a handful of either deep or fun movies, Ashley has been in some monstrous stinkers. And the key to this problem is also one major flaw: She has said more than once that she picks her movies based not on what the script is like but on who the director is.

Unfortunately, that has led to a career making films with either flaky indie auteurs or has-been directors who were great back in the day. They directed or wrote Oscar-nominated films in the 1970s and 80s but have since fallen into disrepair. Such is the case with ""Twisted"" director Philip Kaufman.

Judd wants to be the Kathleen Quinlan of her generation, which isn't a bad thing, but she also plays on it a lot (twinkling eyes of joy). I think she was better in ""Double Jeopardy"". Jackson is totally miscast and sleepwalks through his part as the police chief, whereas Garcia, the actor, just keeps getting better and better - he also looks more and more like Christopher Lee as time goes by. (-A sure contender for the title role in ""The Christopher Lee Story"", if they ever make it.) Though the pacing is good the film is a bit on the boring side with no real action scenes, only off-screen killings, all after-the-fact stuff. I still liked it better than other Judd thrillers of late, such as ""Kiss The Girls"" and ""Eye Of The Beholder"". Some odd elements remain unanswered though, like, why Judd's character has an elderly Asian female peeping Tom for a neighbour. Veronica (""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"") Cartwright appears unbilled as a landlady, but blink and you'll miss her. Not a bad film but unfinished somehow, and the (predictable) ending is badly executed.

'Twisted' is that bad, but has some interesting things in it.  It is about a new homicide detective in San Francisco Police Department Jessica Shephard, played by Ms. Judd in black leather jacket.  She has a unique character (if I may call it unique), for she not only kicks a bad guy, but pick up men at bars and have sex with them.  As if it means an intriguing reference to gender roles or something.

No such luck, though.  As you see the film, the guy with whom Jessica slept one night is found dead at the back of the ballpark, where Jessica and her partner Andy Garcia start to muse about the killer.  Hum... Who did that?  Is this the beginning of another serial killer film, of which ending is way too contrived to believe?

Besides Judd and Garcia, you get Samuel L. Jackson as Jessica's mentor and David Strathairn (John Sayles regular), and no prize for bad acting to any of them.  Director is Philip Kaufman, whose classic 'The Right Stuff' starts to sound very ironical in this B-thriller.

It doesn't help the cause that Judd is no Kim Basinger, and the intimate scenes (perhaps the only possible selling point in absence of a discernible plot) are thus about as titillating as a Yoga workout.

I generally best like movies where the main characters, or at least ONE of them, is a likable, believable hero or heroine.  If the main characters are scumbags - they'd better at least be interesting.

In ""Twisted"" our heroine is a cop who likes to drink herself into a stupor and pick up anonymous guys for anonymous sex.  Perhaps there are males who would be interested in the idea of being picked up by Ashley Judd for a sexual fling, but in ""Twisted"" the sex portrayed is so lacking in love, passion and respect (or self-respect) that I pity the person turned on by this movie.

The other characters are fleshed out in broad strokes and basically not a single person in this movie bears any relationship to anyone I know in real life.  It's not essential that ""real"" characters inhabit the movies I watch, but they should at least be interesting.

It's not just that you know whodunnit within the first ten minutes, it's more that all the characters are so unlikeable and unsympathetic that you don't really care what happens to them.  I find Ashley Judd's acting to be wooden and unemotional, and her character in 'Twisted' at least elicited some emotional response from me - unfortunately the response was dislike with a smattering of disgust, and that was pretty much how I felt about all the characters.

Men are dying in San Francisco, washed up with beaten faces and cigarette burns. You would think a few good cops could figure yet another murder mystery out but this one has a few twists. A woman detective might be getting framed or is she at fault for sleeping around? An evil eyed partner acts a little too familiar with her surroundings. An unsolved mystery is covered up by a malicious police force and a surrogate father pushes a bit too hard. So who did it? Let the fog of San Francisco be your guide!

Ashley Judd plays the same character she always plays, vulnerable, tough, on the verge of tears and at the center of yet another murder mystery. In this role she is offered a bit of an edge, an angry one that she tries to cover by sleeping around with men that she picks up at random at bars.....would a professional detective really be open to the danger in that? Her partner is played by Andy Garcia who just sort of blends into the scenery except for a few random moments spent on his suspicious eyes. Samuel L. Jackson is Judd's surrogate father, the man who raised her after his partner (her father) is killed on duty. With a few other male detectives making their presence on screen just to snidely comment on Judd's sexual habits the cast is complete and entirely typical.

2072823,2,B00029RT9E,"Twisted (Philip Kaufman, 2004)

In the past forty years, Philip Kaufman has directed just twelve films. One of the producers, in the DVD extras, mentions that the production company gets forty to fifty scripts a week. Why either of them decided that Sarah Thorp's (See Jane Run) script for Twisted stood out from the pack is utterly beyond me.

Fifteen years ago, a movie was released called Sea of Love, starring Al Pacino as a detective investigating Ellen Barkin, a woman whose boyfriends all seem to end up dying. The big twist (well, okay, it's predictable, but you know) is that Pacino falls in love with Barkin, who is of course his main suspect, and thus his investigation takes on a whole new urgency, as suddenly he's a target. Sea of Love is a wonderful, underrated thriller that has faded into obscurity. It also, with a few minor changes, has the exact plot of Twisted. In this case, the investigating officer is Jessica Shepherd, played by Ashley Judd (and yes, I hear you thinking ""ho hum, Ashley Judd in another murder mystery-cum-thriller;"" it gets better, folks), and it's her boyfriends who keep turning up dead. The ruggedly handsome cop who falls in love with her is her partner, Mike DelMarco (Andy Garcia, previously the main thing that was brilliant about any movie he starred in; now, he's done Ocean's Eleven, this, AND Ocean's Twelve in the space of two years. Poor guy). And DelMarco here is either the killer or another victim possibility. You know he's got to be one or the other; he's not coming out of this unscathed. And that is one of the movie's biggest problems-- there's no suspense about whether something will happen to any of the characters, only what will happen. Not even when; there are not only characters who walk around with ""kill me"" written on their foreheads, but like the title character in Donnie Darko, they all have the times written on their arms as well.

The other main problem with the movie was the casting of Ashley Judd. This isn't the usual ""Ashley in peril"" flick you've seen a bunch of times (and in this one, the Wise Old Black Man is Sam Jackson, not Morgan Freeman); Jessica is a complex character, strong, aggressive, alcoholic, with huge amounts of rage bubbling just underneath the surface, and to put it simply, the whole thing creates a psychotic. Think Al Pacino (again!) in Cruising. There's only one problem. Ashley Judd is not Al Pacino. Which is good in some scenes (no one ever wants to see that much of Al Pacino's flesh, at least not in 2004), but when it comes to plumbing the emotional depths of Jessica Shepherd, Ashley Judd simply doesn't have the chops. She comes off, many times, as being uncomfortable in her own skin. She just isn't crazy enough. (Putting her sister in, that might have worked.)

Twisted is a watchable movie, but it could have been better had a better actrss taken the main character, and it could have been miles better had they not recycled an old plot hoping no one would remember. ** ",1095120000,,2993,4.682509505703422

2072841,3,B00029RT9E,"Highly respected director Philip Kaufman set out in `Twisted' to make a film noir thriller from an original script starring thriller victim specialist Ashley Judd with support in characteristic roles from Samuel L. Jackson and Andy Garcia. By definition, the success of a thriller is it's ability to thrill, so much of one's evaluation should be based on your visceral reaction to the movie. And, this movie did not have my viscera sending me very many messages about gut-wrenching excitement from my TV screen.

Unlike two other thrillers I recently reviewed, `Out of Time' and `Taken Lives' where the mystery may not have been as well hidden as the writers hoped, there was still a lion's share of stomach wrenching excitement and anxiety being created by the plight of the lead characters in these two movies. Denzel Washington in `Out of Time' is conned into a very believable pickle and the anxiety you feel for his race to stay one step ahead of his cop colleagues is palpable. Angelina Jolie in `Taken Lives' is a highly skilled, yet highly fragile and vulnerable serial killer profiler who makes an almost fatal mistake in identifying the perp and the real perp almost does her in.

All three movies are about cops in bad situations, partly of their own making. The problem with `Twisted' is that not only is the surprise ending no big surprise, the plot's red herring which wants us to believe that the Ashley Judd character, a new San Francisco homicide inspector is killing off her lovers is simply not very believable. The problem, I believe is not with Judd or Director Kaufman, it seems to be in the very script of which Kaufman and associates were so enamoured. The device of having Judd's character black out so obviously after drinking some wine at home before each murder, after having spend time in a local bar drinking more than a few shots of Jack Daniels just does not give a plausible scenario for a person to sleepwalk their way through committing a violent murder of a young, strong grown man with an 0.15% alcohol level in their blood.

The bright side of the movie is that Judd pulls off her characterization of a very tough, very smart young detective with an inclination to violence against perps and meaningless one night stands with pickups at bars away from those patronized by her police colleagues. The lesser police characters are also done very well and the police psychologist played by David Straithairn is done well, even though the attempts at offering him up as a potential perp are weak and underplayed. The minor role of forensic scientist is a minor homage to the rash of CSI shows which includes a clever little reference to a reservation at `Chez Panisse', the most famous Berkeley restaurant. Unfortunately, she has a piece of business at the end of her last appearance that opens an important question that is never answered by the story.

Jackson and Garcia carry out their roles with their usual skill, but I think they cannot transcend the implausibility of the plot. One is being set up as the real perp, the other is the real perp, but neither case is laid out with conviction by the story. The surprise doesn't surprise because it is not plausible.

I am really having a hard time deciding if the movie works as film noir. San Francisco fogs and waterfront scenes are as good or better than New York canyons, but fog and darkness does not make noir. `Chinatown' was filmed in bright LA sunlight and is as great a film noir classic as they come. There almost seemed to be more in common with `Dirty Harry' going on here than echos of Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade.

To end on a positive note, the DVD contains a full length commentary on the movie by director Kaufman, which is always my favorite special feature, as it literally doubles the entertainment value of the product. Other special features are pretty standard stuff.

With commentary, this is good for an entertaining evening. Not as much thrill or suspense as other recent flicks.",1093996800,3,3993,4.736690647482014

2072843,1,B00029RT9E,"Philip Kaufmann has been one of the most famous and original directors in the last two decades .

If we watch his previous you will have to recognize the Genius touch in three remarkable films such as The convincing remake of The invassion of the body snatchers , The wanderers ( a cult movie ) and  Henry and June .

Since the cast was a secure passport (Ashely Judd, Samuel Jackson and Andy Garcia) , I took the flight thinking in a defiant film .

But what a mess!

The film doesn't hold by itself even ten minutes . It seems you are watching a set of vignettes , completely out of continuity , originality and logical sequences . The film promises just in the first ten minutes . You remind a superb film (Internal affairs from Mike Figgs) but soon you will be engaged in a unending script that does not reach the coast . The film drowns in the middle of nowhere . Even Jackson feels uncomfortable with this role . You can watch , and Andy Garcia is (lost in translation) . Nobody wins with such script , predictable and confusing .

This film may be the worst work of Kaufmann , Jackson , Judd and Garcia in all their respective careers",1090627200,6,1141,4.283720930232558

We are both fans of good movies and, quite honestly, this film delivers the goods and sometimes more. It doesn't matter if you can work out the ending in advance, it is an extremely competent piece of film-making.

2072846,2,B00029RT9E,"This movie got a great credential: Ashley Judd, Andy Garcia & Samuel Jackson.  The storyline is what you would expect from Hollywood. Ashley's character is a homicide detective.  His father was a detective as well, partnered to Samuel Jackson's character but alas, he committed suicide.  Her mum was supposedly killed by her father, according to Samuel's character who is now chief to Ashley's character.  Anyhow, despite that Ashley's character is a great detective, she is a fallen angel, who has the propensity to be violent to his suspects & she torments herself by sleeping with men of violent temparement.  The movie got excited when all the men she slept with died a violent death.  It's the case of a serial killer who attempted to outwit the investigators.  Andy played Ashley's character's partner but as any Hollywood movies would have it, the suspicion would lead us to believe that he's the killer.  Hollywood has a tendency to think that audience is thick & that the twist is always predictable & somewhat daff.  In the end, the explanation given to the deaths of those characters & to tie them to the death of Ashley's character's parents is somehow vague & overly illogical.  Anyway, it's just an excuse to get this movie made.  Truth to be told, all the actors & actresses in this movie are underutilised.  The script could be tighter or better.  Give me ""Law & Order"" anytime.  I have just wasted two hours of my valuable time.  Forgettable.",1086480000,6,1459,4.826612903225806
