5406533,5,B00AAQHP66,Here is my own review:  The movie was not only about riding the huge swells of the California coast but about life's ups and downs.. Relationships and having a mentor .. The cinematopghy was sweeping.. Capturing the magnitude of the waves.. The cast was great with Gerard Butler playing Frosty.,1351209600,2,294,4.88

5406594,5,B00AAQHP66,"What a great beach town was the early 1990s Santa Cruz, and a place still magical enough that young people could embrace the wild beauty of nature with athleticism and enterprise.  This movie, in its greatness, has captured a semblance of the culture embedded in the details of its hidden population.  I applaud the hard work and attention to a place I considered my home, even during the Loma Prieta quake, and even as I too had been tumbled in the waves at Its Beach until I thought my life was done.  Death is not as sorrowful as not living life, fully... Santa Cruzans never had feared a clean death... this message was clearly imparted to me from the 5 star efforts of these movie makers.  I recommend watching this movie on a large screen with a good sound system at home because it is difficult to feel as much from small screens.",1492473600,4,837,4.450980392156863

5406707,5,B00AAQHP66,"This one has stayed with me. I grew up loving this type of story: a talented young student looking for direction in a situation that seems to offer scant opportunities. They then see a glimmer of unexpected hope, pursue it despite the obstacles, they get mentored by a somewhat reluctant weathered veteran and with the added help they face their troubles and triumph. I loved the surf scene, the beach community settings the relationships the director allowed to develop and what was ultimately a satisfying movie experience.",1459555200,,525,5.045977011494253

His anger issues seemed to be more pervasive than was necessary, especially if kids are going to watch. Also, I don't know how important it was to have the want-a be  little gangsters featured as much as they were, but it could've been presented in way that indicated the young man had to turn his back on that aspect of coming of age in his area in a more subtle way than focusing on them as much  for the sake of making a more enjoyable movie, no matter what the age of the viewers. Those elements cheapened what was, in actuality,  a very good story.",1457222400,,720,4.318518518518519

What is the maverick?  Well, it is the gigantic wave swells that ride throughout the ocean during high tide. Surfers from all over come out to ride these waves, the bigger the better.  At an early age, Jay was bitten by the surfing bug then in enters Frosty who would turn that passion of surfing into a reality.

5406751,1,B00AAQHP66,"Wildly, horrifically, truly awful movie.

I remember the collective sadness shared by all surfers after Jay Moriarty died. I surf points in Santa Cruz fairly regularly (think hook/38th/weekday steamer lane), and you'll sometimes hear guys telling stories about the likes of Nat Young, Jay Moriarty, Jeff Clark and the Mavericks crew...really cool. But this review isn't about those genuine surfers it's about this horribly made movie. I was even willing to look past the accent problem, but oh my gahd the entire movie is predictable, soupy slop.

1) It's a play-by-play of this happened then that happened then she said this - no actual arc is EVER witnessed. There's even a scene where we see ""Jay"" scribble up some plans about what he's supposed to be...but we NEVER see it!
2) MELODRAMA TO THE MAX. There are scenes in this movie that feel like they belong in ""Portlandia.""
3) There is no movie here. Just a collection of badly acted scenes that fail to tell a cohesive story. This is basically my first point said another way - META POINT.

Net-net:

Are you a surfer? Skip this. Rewatch Point Break, North Shore, ES, ES2, Lords of Dogtown, your home videos whatever. Avoid at all costs.

Are you looking for background noise? Go for it! Pro tip - avoid elongated moments of concentration.",1442793600,,1294,4.8108108108108105

I think Gerard Butler is a very, very good actor, and has built up quite a resume. My favorite film with him is ""RocknRolla"", written & directed by Guy Ritchie, one of Great Britain's best. The supporting cast is to die for: Thandie Newton, Tom Wilkinson, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, Idris Elba, Toby Kebbell (who, along with Tom Hardy steal the show), Karel Roden, Chris Bridges (""Ludacris""), Jeremy Piven, etc. The whole gang is there. ""Chasing Mavericks"" is a small budget, wonderful story. It has several issues, but I won't get into them.

The story has been repeated 100 times here, so I spare us that. But, the EMOTIONS the film brings out are just awesome. All characters are played very real with their searches for love, happiness and fulfillment. So, it's a great emotional surf-film - with pretty awesome shots of thundering MAVERICKS, and actors quests to conquer them.

Gerard Butler is the frosty ""Frosty"" -- who's friendship is intially not very warm.  There are many good performances including young Jonny Weston.

What made this a poignant film for me was to see the realistic depiction of life in a single parent home and the way it could affect a child's drive for accomplishment and recognition, as well as his sense of responsibility and relationships with others.

The sets just about block out the horizon. This movie was  made with the best amount of professional additude that lacks in other ""surf movies"". Bob Barbours' photo's were icing on the cake. He is a great friend and one of the best photographers out there. Bob Pearson of Pearson Arrow surfboards got great exposure and well deserved credit as one of the best rhino chasers (big wave boards) there is. We surfed in a number of contests in our younger days. Butler was great in the role as Frosty. Even if you don't surf, this movie will pull you in. Great job.

5406994,5,B00AAQHP66,"Chasing Mavericks 5

This is based on the true story of American surfer Jay Moriarity.  So this film is more about Jay and his mentor, Frosty (Gerard Butler) than it is about surfing.  The film was really good.  A great sports film and very inspirational.  It showed how, at a young age, Jay has a passion for big waves (""Mavericks"").  The setting is the Santa Cruz, California (Northern California) and during the height of El Nio in 1994.  I always thought you'd have to be crazy to surf those 30 feet waves.  Jay was barely 16 years old.

This film doesn't just center around the quest to surf the ""Big Wave Mavericks"" (like Laird Hamilton's Riding Giants - which I thought was a good documentary).  Chasing Mavericks ended up being a bit of a tear-jerker for me.  It was also an adrenalin rush (watched it about a half hour ago and I still feel a little rush).
But I think that's because I'm really drawn to water sports and just the ocean period.  I've lived in Southern California all my life.  I was body surfering in the 90's before it was popular.  Now, I miss doing that, but still try to get some swim time in either the pools or beaches.  I love the feel of the push-pull of the waves.
There are few surfering movies that I like. And now, I think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chasing-Mavericks/dp/B00AAQHP66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chasing Mavericks</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-God-s-Hands/dp/B00CPTUMUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In God's Hands</a>&nbsp;are my favorite NON-documentary surfing movie.  Meaning a film that is built more on the characters, than the sport.  Sure there are lots of good documentary surfing films to watch.  But I like Docu-dramas more.

The soundtrack was very nostalgic for me. A early 90's best of soundtrack.

I chose to watch this movie because 1) I'm still waiting for the movie Rush, 2) this is one of those films where the actors does their own stunts.  In this case, Gerard and other actors showed some good Big Wave surfing capabilities. And I didn't know until one interview, that Gerard had nearly drowned and was hospitalized during the production of the film.  So, yes, surfing is a very dangerous sport.",1378425600,2,2272,5.2354570637119116

I thought that the kid who played jay did a awesome job. and that gerard butler did a great job as well. those two had good chemistry. if you think about it the student also taught the teacher as well. this is an all around good film. it is too bad that we lost him when we did but his success and memory will live on. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do.,1373846400,,878,4.051724137931035

5407046,3,B00AAQHP66,"I like Gerard Butler. I like inspirational true stories. I like director Curtis Hanson (though he had to leave the production because of illness. Michael Apted completed the film). I tried to like ""Chasing Mavericks"" starring Gerard Butler as Frosty Hesson, a Santa Cruz surfer taking under his wing a young and ambitious surfer Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston), but somehow I felt something is not quite right with the result.

""Chasing Mavericks"" follows the story of Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston), who despite all disadvantages, intends to surf the Mavericks in Northern California, which is one of most dangerous surf spots in the world. Frosty Hesson reluctantly agrees to teach the young surfer.

It's a great story. With Gerard Butler and stunning surf scenes, the film could have been much more emotionally involving, but somehow ""Chasing Mavericks"" lacks passion those characters should have. Some episodes are rather clichd (the one involving a dog in the opening is a good example). The mentor/surrogate father-like relationship between the two main characters is not fully explored. Two talented players Elizabeth Shue and Abigail Spencer are wasted.

""Chasing Mavericks"" is a decent film with exhilarating surfing sequences, but is still a missed opportunity for a more dramatic bio-pic with an inspirational message.",1373328000,2,1325,5.391304347826087

5407092,4,B00AAQHP66,"Don't be fooled by the presentation of this movie as being a surf movie. Yes, it certainly is built around a surfing theme, but it is a relationships movie. It is about a few peoples lives converging at pivotable moments in their life; how they overcome their fears of love and commitment,  opening up old wounds and healing. Then there's the wave - Mavericks, and the detailed teachings the experienced mentor gives to his young, ambitious, protge ; zen lessons that come with surfing and respecting the ocean. A great family movie for sure, perhaps too heavy for really young kids.",1371254400,,583,4.772277227722772

5407120,3,B00AAQHP66,"Inspired by the true story of surfing legends Frosty Hesson and his protg Jay Moriarity, this film at times is inspiring but the main reason to see it are some of the big surf (Mavericks) sequences shot north of L. A.

Frosty (Gerard Butler) is an aging surfer who mostly neglects his wife and daughter.  If he's not working (repairs stuff), he's surfing with his buddies.  Living across the street is young Jay (Cooper Timberline then Jonny Weston) whose father leaves him and his alcoholic mother (Elisabeth Shue).  Eventually Frosty fills that role and agrees to mentor Jay so that he can ride the ""Mavericks"" that will eventually show up.  It's kind of like the relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi in ""The Karate Kid.""  All of the time is in training not surfing.  This includes writing long essays, but not about his crush on an older girl (Leven Rambin).

Alas, the film is full of clichs and has a boilerplate script.  But Weston is cute and Butler is hunky, so I suspect the film hit its target pretty well.  The PG rating keeps the potential bully violence and budding romance in check, and saves a downer for the epilog.  For me, I just liked the waves.",1369958400,,1170,4.603864734299517
5407121,5,B00AAQHP66,I liked the story till I got to the end- it was shocking to me.  But overall a great movie. I would recommend seeing it.,1369872000,,120,3.8
5407122,5,B00AAQHP66,"This is an actual presentation of the way the Mavericks are and need to be approached. Being familiar with surfing it is as close to the intense training and stamina that would be required if a person wanted to attempt these ""monsters"".  The end is also to be expected.",1369872000,2,269,4.489795918367347
5407123,4,B00AAQHP66,I enjoyed it much more than I thought.  I really recommend it.  It is a real adventure and motivational movie - without the cheesiness.,1369872000,,135,4.583333333333333
5407124,3,B00AAQHP66,its difficult to make a good surfing movie and although this was a good effort; it still falls short of the adventure I expected.,1369785600,,129,4.416666666666667
5407125,5,B00AAQHP66,"Our family really enjoyed this movie.  Great message, beautiful surfing scenes, interesting story line.  Especially interesting because it is based on a true story.

5407128,1,B00AAQHP66,"Wow.  I guess this was made for a targeted audience and it was good enough for them.  But a surfing movie does not have to be this cliche and poorly acted.  Maybe the surfing footage at the end, which they are inevitably leading to, is ""awesome"" enough to alleviate the pain and suffering at the beginning, but I don't have that kind of tolerance.  When I see a wave mushy and closing out, I kick out early.  That's what I would recommend.  I got to figure out where my dentist got his great video of real surfers doing their thing; I don't need the cheesy story line and half-baked characters.",1369612800,4,594,4.3545454545454545

5407135,4,B00AAQHP66,"Just finished watching this with my daughter, I wish my teenage son had seen it  with us. We had watched Soul Surfer a few months ago, about a girl who surfs and loses her arm to a shark. This was less traumatizing, but equally as exciting. Gerard Butler is perfect in this role. We loved him in Nim's Island. In this movie, there is some suspense, some sentimentality, a glimpse of a shark (!), and nothing inappropriate. Fine for families, although someone dies before it's over - I won't tell you who....but no violence or gore. We want to watch it again.",1369353600,,558,4.470588235294118

5407147,5,B00AAQHP66,"Surprising find - I really enjoyed the movie and seemed safe material and language for the kids. Unless you happen to live in an area where there are rocky beaches and 30 foot waves - I'd highly recommend it. The acting was well done, and the storyline overall flowed nicely. There were a few 'why did they do that?' moments  - where the story seemed to jump or not describe how we got from point A to Point B - but it appeared to be due to editing scenes out, or trimming them down. It made me want to jump out on a surfboard in the ocean - and I actually liked Gerard Butler much more in this role than others I've seen him in.",1368576000,,629,4.032

With that said, this movie is hands down one of the best movies I have ever seen (35 yrs and I can't think of a better movie). I found myself having A LOT in common with Jay, in a way that I was not allowed to be a child either, which makes me who I am today.
 If you like a movie ( in general, not just surfing movies ) that will have you cheering, cursing, cheering some more, then crying, then cheering even more, then do watch this movie...

If I could give it more stars I would. The acting is on point across the board, everyone in the movie was great.

Just an absolutely amazing movie.",1368489600,,646,3.953846153846154

5407153,4,B00AAQHP66,"Surprised and delighted is what turned out to be, when we finished watching this movie. The cinematography is downright majestic, and the acting mostly specially good. What a story! It seems that Jay Moriarity was an outstanding human being, with a passion for the sea only known to true surfers. The acting in this movie is right on cue and well worth enjoying. There is something to be said about these waves, but I believe that seeing them is the best way. Mother nature manifests itself with tremendous impact when it comes to mavericks, places in the world where these gigantic waves appear. I know that in Peru, in a place called Pico Alto, there is a wave that many of the sturdiest surfers from around the world, challenge once a year, or at least it used to be.
Whatever configuration creates these monsters, only the few selected can hope to venture in and remain unscathed, and one can only imagine the stamina and strength required to challenge these waves.
Truly a very fun time at the movies, in the comfort of your warm or air conditioned home, being witness to the kind of people that Frosty and Jay are, a breed apart to be sure! 4.5 Stars!",1368403200,2,1157,4.5673076923076925
5407154,3,B00AAQHP66,"What this movie does well is it opens the experience up to everyone and doesn't pigeonhole itself into the surfing genre.  It focuses mostly on Jay's character and his relationship with Frosty, not just on surfing, which I think kept it off the chopping block.  It also does a good job of explaining, and showing, how dangerous Mavericks really are.

Gerard Butler should not have played Frosty though, in my opinion.  He is a good actor, and I love a lot of his work, but I don't really think this role was for him (to show what I mean, I think Matthew McConaughey would've been perfect here).  He is really the only big name in the film, other than Elizabeth Shue (if you can count her anymore), so he probably anchored it for marketing purposes.

Mad props to Jonny Weston, though, he did a really good job as the naive teen who just wants to get out there and surf but gets pulled into all this drama and bull-crap with his mom, his love interest, and his best friend.  I didn't know who Jay Moriarity was before this film and it was at least good enough to make me research this guy afterwards.

What brought this movie down to a 3 for me was just general, nit-picky stuff (like Butler playing Frosty), so I won't waste your time with it here (as you may not agree with it all).  If you love surfing, you'll love this movie.  Based on a true story doesn't really mean anything anymore as cinematic liberties are taken at will these days (research will show that here, too).

Good movie for you if the plot/cover alone piques your interest; an okay movie if it doesn't.",1368144000,,1573,4.408304498269896

I see they will all grow as actors but this flick did not have the drama to keep you engaged.

I felt the entire movie hit just the right tone in every single scene. Gerard Butler is terrific as the surf mentor to Jonny Weston playing famed surfer Jay Moriarity. The actual surf scenes throughout are amazing and shot so well. Kudos for also getting the soundtrack spot-on with a nice mix of the skater/surfer hardcore (Butthole Surfers, Sponge) to the mellower stuff (Mazzy Star) of the late '80s.

The extras are also worth watching with a look at the life of Jay Moriarity (Wiki him, if you want to learn more) as well as interviews with the actual surfers involved in the filming.

From start to finish, this captures life in a typical California beach community and the whole surfer ethos.",1366848000,,829,4.671232876712328

5407220,3,B00AAQHP66,"I thought the movie was pretty good, I didn't love it though.  The movie has a lot more drama than you would expect from the trailer.  Both the kid's and Gerard Butler's lives are very dramatic, I was teary eyed a few times during this movie which was unexpected.  The visuals were awesome, it made me want to go out and surf, but then I realized that I'm fat and live in Texas, so its probably not going to happen ;)

The movie may not be little kid safe due to subject matter, violence, drugs, alcohol abuse, bad parenting practices, skipping school, language, death of a parent.",1365379200,,581,4.401869158878505

5407224,5,B00AAQHP66,"I didn't really know who Jay was, or that he was a real young man till I saw the beginning and it said, 'based on a true story'.  I loved the cimematography and the mood of the film. It was a very easy to enjoy. The acting was good, as was the script, and the story was just so uplifting. I saved it for my family to see and I've recommended it to others as well. A great story about a VERY young man who decided to throttle the waves!  A great father-son movie that had  wonderful messages about how important a father REALLY is in a young boys life, regardless of what the PC people say today. A FATHER can make all the difference in a childs life, just as a mother can as well. But only a dad can fill that position in a boys life. This was a great movie about love, friendship, drive, committment, and courage.

I've seen some rather unkind reviews of this film and my personal opini is that they didn't understand the idea of it. If you want a purely surfer dude movie, this is NOT it, nor did they advertise it as such. I saw the previews of this, and it WAS described exactly as they delivered. This had a surfing theme and element, but it was more about the training, the emotional bond that developed between Jay and Frosty, and how he overcame certain obsticles. I, personally, would've found it extrememly boring if it had focused totally on surfing, as it wouldn't have done the film, or the story, justice. It's the journey, not the destination.

As for the 'film critics' that panned this when it came out. WHO CARES WHAT THEY THINK?  I think people who listen to 'professional' reviewers end up missing these little pearls. Ever hear the term, 'sleeper hit'?  Like OCtober Sky, Somewhere in Time...the list goes on.  This might've been panned by dead from the neck up, washed out of school former film students that never made it...but they don't know what the he!! they're talking about.

5 STARS all the way!",1365292800,,1925,4.384831460674158

I have since learned that critics labeled this movie a flop because it does not have sex, swearing and violence compared to the movies that is common today that is loaded with filth.

Kudos to the producer of this movie.. there is still some decency left in movie production.  Is it perfect? No there are some scene there that is obviously shoot at an Aquarium but hey...it it still good.",1365206400,,666,4.288

It's a good storyline of a young man pursuing his dreams and the father figure/mentor (wonderfully played by Gerard Butler) who helps him.  The movie is based on a true story and has notes of comedy, romance, and drama, nicely blended.  I was pulled into the story quickly and it held my attention all the way through, even on my second viewing.  As a bonus, the scenery is absolutely incredible.

It's a good treatment to a sad but uplifting story.",1365033600,2,346,4.390625

(Hence the reasoning for the 4 star rating.) I truly enjoyed this movie and would definitely watch it again.  *** SPOILER ALERT****

Ending is NOT for the faint-of-heart, be prepared to tear-up. But it does show the power of the human spirit and how when someone puts their mind, heart & soul to something or someone, ANYTHING & EVERYTHING is possible. If you enjoy movies like Rudy then you will like this. Both based on true stories and events, both the underdogs of life, and both characters are full of tenacity.",1365033600,,690,4.694214876033058

5407249,5,B00AAQHP66,"I saw this film with a friend (who is also a teacher) at the theater, and we both loved it.  It is one of the most inspiring and motivational stories I've ever had the pleasure to watch on screen, and it's based on the real life story of Jay Moriarity.  The California surf and coastline make for some beautiful cinematography in the film, and the 90's era music compliments the film action.  Gerard Butler and Jonny Weston really make the main characters come to life, and the supporting cast does a good job as well, especially Abigail Spencer. I have recommended the film to other teachers; everyone who saw the film came back with positive comments, and some even watched it a second time...it's that good!

I bought the film as soon as it was released on DVD.  I teach 8th grade English, and I have shown this film to all of my classes as a motivational tool.  They loved it, and many of them want to buy the film.  They also have asked me to show the film again.  The main character, Jay Moriarity, is a great role model for anyone, but especially kids, and there is nothing offensive in the film; it's rated PG.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an inspirational motivational film to show to students, or for a family movie night.",1364774400,3,1248,4.43859649122807

While this movie has its fair share hollywood sugar coating, the overall inspiring message still comes through in a big way. Also have to give Kudos for including real Mavericks surfers in the film. There is some great footage that emphasizes just how huge and brutal Mavericks is, but I'd say this movie is all about the positive message of living in the now, going after your dreams, and enjoying the journey. I personally came away inspired and more dedicated to reach life-long goals I've not achieved. I'd add this is also a good ""family movie"" too.",1364688000,2,648,4.743362831858407

Facing and understanding fear, as well as overcoming fear, is a central theme in this movie.

It was inspiring watching a man learn how to become a better man, through his actions pertaining to a neighborhood boy. This boy, who is fatherless, becomes Gerards' prodigy. He teaches him more than just surfing, he really becomes a surrogate father of sorts.
The movie definitely has what I call, ""The Disney Effect"". Things are slightly predictable and everyone gets what they want in the end, with a happy one at that, of course.

Most Hollywood attempts, for example ""In God's Hands"", are aimed at wanna-bees in Iowa that have never even seen the ocean.  If watching ""Chasing Mavericks"" doesn't have your stomach roll up into your mouth when Jay paddles out to surf Mavericks you either are dead or dying.
Having been surfing for 50 years, I assure you the feeling Jay had upon successfully making the wave is not easily duplicated outside the arena of the ocean at its wildest. Sit back and enjoy the ride!",1363219200,3,708,4.739837398373984

It's a story about an unlikely father/son bond between two once-strangers. And, yes, it's a story about surfing... But you can replace surfing for so many other aspects of life and have the same result. This kid knew what he wanted and he never backed down and because of it he became a legend and changed the lives of the people around him and those who looked up to him.

You don't have to know the true story of Jay Moriarty and Frosty Hesson to be moved by this movie. But once you see it, you won't forget it any time soon.",1363046400,,904,4.311764705882353
5407312,5,B00AAQHP66,"This is a movie about two very reverred surfers, Jay Moriarity and Frosty Hesson from the Santa Cruz surfing community. Santa Cruz is a surfing town, annually hosting surfing events for the world surfing community. Therefore, for Jay to rise to the status of surfing legend by the time that he was 21 years old is remarkable. Truly, his story is the stuff; that legends are made of. As you watch the movie, you are watching a story about a true life legend. And with every legendary figure in history, there is a teacher, mentor, guide who makes the journey with him/her. Frosty, still a surfing legend, is Jay's teacher. You will learn about the surfing culture and community, as well as how intense they are as athletes. Something many do not realize. Also, to my personal delight, you will see how intellectual and smart they are. Sadly, surfers are often portrayed as dumb pot heads or worse.
As a generalization, nothing can be further from the truth. May you enjoy being transported into a world that few, but true ""locales""; know the truth about.",1363046400,,1053,4.697297297297298

5407315,5,B00AAQHP66,I thought that it was a well done film. It was intriguing. If you are a sports fan you will enjoy. It was a clean film that didn't have anything really too racy in it. Overall great!,1363046400,,182,3.945945945945946

5407317,4,B00AAQHP66,"Obviously this movie rewards you with the visual effects of riding a big wave, and what separates this from just the ok movies is the fact that it's based on the life of a real surfer who later died at the ripe age of 23 in a diving accident. It lacks the flow and depth to make it a classic, but well worth it if you like the outdoors and bitter sweet stories of courage and triumph.",1363046400,,384,4.0

Gerard Butler plays a serious side in this movie and does a great job at it! Plays Frosty who teaches Jay how to ride big waves. Got its funny parts, but it also has its teary eyed parts. If you're a fan of surfing or the beach, check this movie out! Its pretty amazing! The message at the end says ""Live Like Jay!""... After seeing how Jay lives with a smile on his face and always in a positive outlook no matter what life throws, Its easy to see why thats the message.",1362960000,3,593,4.068376068376068
5407321,5,B00AAQHP66,"Chasing Mavericks Movie Review

Truth be told, when the movie trailer for ""Chasing Mavericks"" was released I was far from eager to spend $12 dropping into a movie theater to watch it.

Guess I'm a bit jaded by major motion pictures in the past that have failed to capture the art/sport of surfing in its true form.
Need I mention ""Blue Crush"" or ""Soul Surfer?""

Fast-forward to February 26, 2013 the date ""Chasing Mavericks"" comes out on DVD, and my ""corporate"" surf movie mindset is forever shifted.

It's apparent that this movie was ""made with the help of some of the biggest names in the surfing world."" I believe it was thru these collaborative efforts that 20th Century Fox succeeded in communicating the feelings only a surfer would know.

The movie was more than just about big wave surfing, it's about life transforming moments and creating a legacy. ""Chasing Mavericks"" is the ""Karate Kid"" of surfing.  In this instance, Frosty Hesson plays the part of Mr. Miyagi and Jay Moriarity is Danielson.

This is not just a movie you watch once and forget about it. It's a movie you add to your DVD collection and revisit time and time again. As the opening clip reminds us; "" We all came from the sea,but we are not of the sea. Children of the tides must return to it again and again.""

5407322,3,B00AAQHP66,"Ok.
Based on a true story about Jay Moriarity (June 16, 1978June 15, 2001), surfer.
The acting is not the greatest but it is  a plus anytime its based on a true story and the ocean takes up most the camera time.
Worth buying - no, worth streaming, yes! On a rainy day stream in sunny California.

~~~ Jay  Moriarity is remembered as a soul surfer, winning many sportsmanship awards throughout his career~~~",1362873600,,406,4.534246575342466

It's about people, it's about heart, it's a movie that was made for love of the story, not for love of the mega bucks. The characters draw you in and you care about them, you cheer for them and cry for them.",1362700800,2,381,3.961038961038961

What an incredible human Jay was! Definitely left his mark for the short time he was on this earth.  And the realtionship between Jay and Frosty was heartwarming.
Just a great story about character, determination, friendship and love.  Definitely a keeper!",1362528000,2,456,4.524390243902439

Gerard Butler's performance as Frosty made him wise and real, and the story of a how a good kid becomes an extraordinary surfer and young man was truly moving. It's more about growing up than surfing, but there's plenty of amazing footage of that, too. Highly recommended.",1362441600,2,322,4.872727272727273
5407329,4,B00AAQHP66,I watched this movie with my older grandsons 13 and 10 years old.  We all enjoyed the movie and I was able to sneak in a few life lessons for the boys while we watched.

5407334,5,B00AAQHP66,"What a wonderful movie on life and love.  It is a story on goal setting, hard work, committment and over coming fear!  I have a feeling the surf genre spooked people away.  Too many sterotypes to overcome.  This is a must see!",1362009600,2,226,4.309523809523809
5407335,5,B00AAQHP66,"Great tale of big-wave phenom Jay Moriarity and his mentor Frosty. Storywise it's basically a bit of a mix between North Shore and The Karate Kid but a bit more realistic since, well, most of this stuff incredibly really happened shortly after the spotlight for big-wave surfing had turned from Waimea Bay and Todos Santos up to Mavericks. Like most Hollywood surf movies it has its share of necessary cheese here and there to drive the story along, but overall it's a film as solid as the surf it depicts that surfers and non-surfers can enjoy and be moved and inspired by. The soundtrack is perfect for that moment in surf history (Sponge, Mazzy Star, Butthole Surfers, The Offspring, Matthew Sweet), and the cameos by big-wave chargers like Peter Mel and Greg Long provide the necessary credibility and access for the project. Also just figured out Frosty's wife is played by Abigail Spencer watching Jimmy Kimmel whose brother is Sterling Spencer (just featured in Surfer Magazine) of the Spencer family which is Gulf Coast surf royalty (Yancy Spencer III, Yancy Spencer IV, founders of Innerlight Surf Shop - most surfers will likely recognize these names). Lots of great special features on the Blu-ray. Not sure which was harder, the surfing, or operating the many types of camera rigs used?! Really a great film worthy of any surfer's collection.

5407336,5,B00AAQHP66,"I am not a surfer or great outdoorsman, but the storyline is inspirational and scenery is amazing. One of the things that attracted me to the movie was the quality of the blu ray and it was great . I love the ocean and the film does a phenomenal job and makes me wish I was there. It is also the sort of movie you can watch with your kids since it is a PG. So check it out and you won't be disappointed !",1362009600,,404,3.764705882352941

5407339,3,B00AAQHP66,"A teen oriented film celebrating the freedom, beauty and challenge of surfing as well as the memory of a young surfer, Jay Moriarty, from Santa Cruz, CA who did have some hard knocks in life (absent father, alcoholic mother).  However, I can't get past the fact that he was a reckless person who eventually died (cliff diving if not surfing monstrous waves) of his behavior.  So, both parents and teens take note, Jay's story is actually also a cautionary tale.",1361923200,2,461,4.75
5407340,2,B00AAQHP66,"The boy's pursuit of the ultimate wave was so he could feel more alive inside. A very sad ambition that many pursue is the idea that putting your life at risk will give you such an adrenal rush that you conclude that you are now alive. This pursuit of the adrenaline rush that drives people to do this is sad testament to how misinformed people are. Folks, Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven is within us. Finding the place of peace, love and joy as the normal state within ourselves is a combination of correct diet, and correct thought and achieving deeps states of meditation.",1361923200,2,577,4.504761904761905
5407341,5,B00AAQHP66,"I am not a surfer, but I have lived near the ocean, including Santa Cruz where this movie takes place, so it was interesting to me at least to see the locations featured in the movie, including Mavericks.  While surfing is the over-riding theme here,  this movie will appeal to more than just surfers.  Cinematically this was a well made movie that really delivered in sight and sound quality.  The storyline did feel a little ""Disneyish"" at times, but not in a bad way.  It was a touching and inspiring movie that I highly recommend.  Gerard Butler does a fine job in the role as the sage surfer mentor.  And no, I am not going to try and ride a Mavericks wave now !  but I will for sure watch this fine movie more than once.  Do yourself a favor and watch this on as big a screen as you can to get the full effect of these monster waves !",1361923200,2,840,4.167701863354037
5407342,5,B00AAQHP66,One of my all time favorite movies. The character development of the surfer community in the Santa Cruz was phenomenal.,1361923200,5,119,5.0
5407343,4,B00AAQHP66,"So, yes, this movie version of Jay's life starts out like the Karate Kid, the grouchy older guy teaching the ""kid"" all those life lessons complete with the bullies and the messed up Mom, but this movie is more than all this typical stuff. Why? because they somehow managed to capture the spirit of Jay Moriarity, a young man whose smile Johnny Weston, who played him, managed to capture. This is a movie about a nice young man, even the ""bully"" is won over (without getting ""beat"" up), who went for his dream and made it happen. I've been lucky enough to have actually been to Mavericks as a spectator (2008, and things were pretty crazy), and in the '60's I actually surfed long boards at the Wedge (Newport) and Little Corona right after the quake in Alaska, but those waves I ended up under were nothing to what I saw at Mavericks. I gave this movie 4 stars because the real story of Jay's life and his relationship with Frosty didn't need the whole Karate Kid type angle. No sex, no bad words, no violence, this is a movie about a young man striving for something he really wants to achieve, and yes, the end will leave you with a lump in your throat and maybe tears but watch it with your family. And, then, check out the Mavericks and look up Jay, they still love him in Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay. Oh, watch out for those sneaker waves, they will get you.",1361836800,27,1364,4.33203125
5407344,5,B00AAQHP66,"I am not a big surfing fan, but I have to say that this movie was very inspiring and fun to watch and enjoy as a family. It has a strong message that is good for the whole family and one that I want my kids to learn from. The acting is strong and though I never saw this in the theater by where I live, I wish it had gotten more theater time as I know that others would have enjoyed this as much as my family did! The movie is based off of a true story, and I have to say that these are the type of movies that I typically do enjoy and this did not disappoint. The movie was well done, and definitely stirs the emotions in many places throughout the film. The movie makes me want to go to California again soon as the scenery is simply awe-inspiring! All-in-all this was a great movie that I would encourage all to see!

5407370,4,B00AAQHP66,This is the standard man mentors lad who overcomes difficulties movie set against a surf background.  The theme has been done a hundred times and is now pretty stale.  So why did I like this movie and fall for the story line?  The cinematography of an area I am familiar with grabbed me.  I also think it had some good things to say about surfing.  If you are not someone who has ever surfed it does give a picture of how much intelligence goes into the sport.  It shows how it is sport that involves a love of the ocean.  It also show the positive side of the folks who participate.  Surfers are often shown as lazy druggies who are pretty much a drag on society.  Jay Moriarity is far from that portrait in this film.  The characters are a little trite but the acting is first class.  I enjoyed it.  I will probably run it again just to look at the parts with the ocean.,1361145600,,872,4.186746987951807

The sport is not about Frankie Avalon and Annette beach parties, silly surfing contests, and everybody calling everybody else a dude--as Hollywood and the Media mischaracterize it.

I was hoping for an epic surfing film, but what I got was one of the worst, most pedestrian screenplays ever committed to film.  The writers tried to make a human interest film, but none of the characters are in the least interesting.

And the acting is simply awful.  John Weston, a newcomer to film, is possibly the worst young actor since Edward Furlong, while Gerard Butler turns in a performance that should be a career ender.

The movie just drags and drags and drags.  The directing is horrible and even the cinematography, which should be central to a film about a giant wave, is pathetic.  This film gets 33% on RottenTomatoes, which is a far better rating than it deserves.

Trust me: skip this turkey.  If you want to see a real surfing movie, rent Stacey Peralta's ""Riding Giants"".",1360713600,8,855,4.5359477124183005

I really appreciated them shooting the film from a TRUE local perspective - everything was filmed on site and they did not disappoint. I cannot wait until this movie comes out - I am definitely going to preorder it!

-Also.. the song in the closing credits by Greg Holden.. We saw him in San Francisco... this guy is an amazing artist!! If you haven't checked out his other music definitely do so now.. I have a feeling he's going to get big soon.

5407386,5,B00AAQHP66,"This movie is based on a true story that will inspire the audience. Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston) is raised by a single mom (Elizabeth Shue) who is never around. He almost died of drowning when he was younger and Frosty Hesson (the local surfing legend) saved him. Since that day, Jay follows Frosty Hesson (Gerard Butler) and notices that Frosty often goes out very early in the morning. One day, Jay follow Frosty to see what he's doing out so early in the morning. On this trip Jay discovers the secret place where some of the local surfer legends surf. Frosty tells him that the biggest wave will come to this spot one day. He asks Frosty to help him train to ride the biggest waves. During the training process many life events happen and it turns out that Jay is helping Frosty as much as Frosty is helping him. They build a father and son bond.

This movie has so many different emotions. There are the relationships between a Jay and his mom, Jay and his first crush, Jay and his best friend and Jay and his father-figure neighbor. There is so much awesome footage of the waves and the surfing culture that the audience can really enjoy watching while learning. The music is so perfect for all the scenes, especially with the skateboarders and surfers. The scenes of the 80s and the small town lifestyle is awesome to see. The special effects in this movie are above average. The big wipe out captured in this movie is like no other picture I've seen.  The message in this movie is never give up. Sometimes it is so much work to achieve your goals, but if you practice everyday, you will be better than yesterday. My favorite characters are Jay and Frosty. Jay is so friendly and never hold grudges; he always forgives. Frosty is a great surfer with a big heart. I rank this movie 5 out of 5 stars. I recommend this for ages 7 and up. Cheyenne N, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

I recently watched Chasing Mavericks and really enjoyed it. I saw it with my mom and she even cried in some parts; everyone needs a good movie to cry in sometimes. Throughout this entire movie, I obsessed over the main character, Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston.) He is just so adorable in the whole movie. I did a little research on the story; and it is pretty accurate. I have never really watched movies primarily filmed in water, but I think it makes the acting and storyline more intense, which I like.

This movie is about a fifteen-year-old boy name Jay Moriarity who, since he was eight, has been passionate about waves and surfing. It all starts when he was timing the swell of the waves to determine how large they were and fell in. His later mentor, Frosty (Gerard Butler) saved him and ever since he is always in the water. One day Jay hops onto Frosty's truck and follows him to a place where he sees the biggest waves existing - known to be a myth, the Mavericks. Jay begs Frosty to train him to surf the Mavericks. Frosty agrees and they spend everyday intensely training. Jay has had a hard life; his dad left him, and he acts as a mother to his struggling mother. But, he is very optimistic - which is inspiring. This movie portrays Jay as a good role model, showing how to find happiness in spite of everything.

I have now seen this movie twice because it was so good! I probably will soon watch it again. All of the acting is great, and from researching the cast I found out that the main character Jonny Weston (Jay Moriarity) is a new actor. He was amazing in this movie. Even though this movie is based on a true story, it feels unreal because the life of Jay is inspiring, and hard to believe that someone could be that positive. Also there is a good soundtrack. It is the first movie where I actually noticed the sound track. Usually it does not jump out at me, but this time it does. I give this movie five out of five stars because it held my attention the entire time. I recommend it for ages six and up because smaller children might get bored by a long movie Victoria B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic

The surf is up and we are heading to the ocean for this amazing movie. The movie, based on the real life experience of Jay Moriarty, played by new-comer Jonny Weston. Jay moves to Santa Cruz, California when he is 9 and learns to surf from a boy he befriends. He is drawn to the waves and the ocean. He counts the seconds between the breakers for fun. Once he learns to surf and has made a name for himself as a good local surfer he meets a legendary big wave surfer named Frosty Henderson, played by Gerrard Butler.

The cinematography is hypnotizing. Some of the shots of the ocean and surfing are more then incredible. Your eyes are glued to the screen from the beginning to the end and you can make a really strong connection to surfers and surfing as a lifestyle. Some people call it sour surfing and Jay Moriarty was the youngest and the best. In the movie they show the relationship between Jay and Frosty as having only being a few weeks of training seasons but in real life Frosty trained Jay for years before his first attempt at riding a Maverick. These waves can be 50 feet high and are very dangerous. There are so many things that can go wrong. Having us believe that all the training happened in one small stretch of weeks would be impossible but that's just Hollywood telling the story.

Go watch this touching story and bring a friend but leave the boards outside. You don't have to surf to enjoy the movie but it could open your eyes to a glimpse of what some of these amazing athletes will do for the sport. Once you see it, you will know why once you start, the ocean is always calling you to back to play again. I think I would love to learn to surf but I will stick with the small waves. The age range is 9 and up but really the photography in the movie will keep anybody entertained. I give it 4 1/2 out of 5 twinkling stars. Morgan B, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Too bad for that since it was a beautiful, inspiring, humorous, emotional (a few tears) and well done movie about surfing and relationships. If you only like coastal northern California's beautiful scenery and wave action that would be enough to enjoy this movie. Add the real life story line of a father-son mentorship of Frosty Hesson and Jay Moriarity and this become so much more. My friends and family loved this movie.  Gerard Butler did a fantastic job in portraying Frosty and braved huge waves to show audiences the powerful, dangerous side of surfing.....he almost drowned during the filming. This movie deserves multiple viewings and will make a great gift.  Hope the DVD has a lot of extras attached!

DISCLAIMER: I lived in Santa Cruz 1987-1992.  I do not pretend to be a surfer, because I am not one.  I have, however, done a lot of body surfing and body boarding (boogie boarding) in Hawaii and Santa Cruz.  Plus as a marine biologist I have spent considerable amounts of time near, in, and on the ocean.  With that being said...

""Chasing Mavericks"" is probably the best surfing movie I have ever seen.  This biopic of young Jay Moriarity and his mentor Frosty Hesson delves into the psyche and spiritual basis of surfing better than any other surfing movie.

Gerard Butler turns in a stellar performance as the sage surfer who reluctantly agrees to train a teenager to surf one of the most dangerous waves in the world - Mavericks.

To ""get"" this movie you have to understand this wave.

Mavericks is surf break just north of Half Moon Bay, CA.  It breaks only when the surge is big enough and comes from the right direction.  Most offshore breaks occur over reefs that are 20 feet deep or less (e.g., Pipeline, on the north shore of Oahu), but the reef at Mavericks is twice that deep.  This means that it takes a huge wave to break there.

In addition to the deep reef at Mavericks, there is an unusual underwater rock formation that helps big waves set up and break.  There is a sloping ramp of rock that approaches the shallow water inshore.  The water to the right and left of this ramp is deep.  The shallower water slows a wave, makes it stand up, and then plunge over explosively.  The deep water on either side keeps the focus of the wave in one location.

This combination of factors produces waves that can be 20-80' feet tall, and is one of the most dangerous places to surf in the world.  There are only a few places in the world with waves in this size class.  OK, back to the movie.

Young Jay Moriarity, like just about every other surfer along the central California coast those days had heard rumors of a giant wave, but it was dismissed largely as myth.  One day though, Jay discovers someone who rides that wave - Frosty Hesson - and Jay sees the wave and Frosty and his surfing partners ride the wave at Mavericks.  It takes some doing, but Frosty is finally convinced to train Jay for Mavericks.

This movie is about what it takes to prepare not to ride a wave like Mavericks, but how to increase your chances of surviving it.  That preparation requires physical, mental, spiritual, etc., development.

There is a good dose of surfing in the movie, and while there is a strong mental and spiritual component to the movie, it does not come across as eclectic or preachy.  it's just downright amazing!

The sheer force and presence of the wave is awe-inspiring, and the willingness and ability of a small handful of big-wave surfers who challenge it and ride it are beyond impressive.  It borders the miraculous.

I mean, I've been held down by a waves in the 6-8' range in Hawaii, so it's nearly impossible to imagine the amount of force in a wave the size of Mavericks.  It's a wave that you feel more than you hear or see it.  Sheer power!

This is a movie experience not to be missed!

5 stars all the way, and I'll be buying a copy of this movie ASAP.",1353196800,163,3228,4.422750424448218
5407392,5,B00AAQHP66,"I don't remember seeing a better surf film.  Not comparing to the documentaries, like Endless Summer, because this is also a story.  I believe this film will be considered a surf classic down the road.

Beautiful footage of the surf, particularly, of what the surfer sees from ""outside"".  If you've ever surfed norcal, it will be an eerie, but very cool feeling when you recogize those cliffs with that tremendously wide blue green giant raising it's shoulders up in the foreground.  As compelling as the story is, those scenes are also very very special.

Not like the large number of cheesy b-movie surf flicks (which I kind of enjoy); this is a well written, well filmed, well acted drama about some very interesting people's lives.  Both a true story and a true taste of surfing and the surf culture in northern california where the waves are big and the water is very cold.  With a rare glimpse into the character of a few of the exceptional individuals in that culture.  And it left me thinking.

Loved it.

Plan to buy a Blu-Ray for myself and a DVD for a friend of mine, as soon as they are released.  Hopefully before Christmas.  I'm not a plant.  Not a poser.  Not trying to sell this movie.  I just loved it and wanted to tell everyone.",1353196800,,1247,4.524663677130045
