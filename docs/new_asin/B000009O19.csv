8178633,4,B000009O19,"Without saying much about Kung Fu of 8 Drunkards,,,,,,When I rate a flick, I usually rate it for the actual Kung fu, picture quality and plot.  This movie had amazing old school kung fu, the plot was acceptable and easy to follow and the dvd picture and choreography was good.  Therefore, I give this flick 4 stars overall,,,movies like 7 Grandmasters or Mystery of Checkers boxing get 5 stars in my book!",1149465600,2,405,4.611111111111111
8178634,5,B000009O19,"This film was released before Jackie Chan's classic Drunken Master(in the U.S.).It's an action packed classic with the DVD giving alot of extras(loads of bonus clips and a really cool section called 8 Drunken Fights),and it's in 5.1 sound. A definite addition to the collection. I watched it back to back with Drunken Master! Check out Shaolin Drunkard too!",1018310400,,357,5.067796610169491
8178635,4,B000009O19,this movie has great actors Meng Fei and Chen Sing most naotably a young man learns the Drunken Gods style from a old Drunkard  the bad guys see the young man using the style and try to  use him to find the old master who was believed to have been  killed by their master. be warned this movie tries to be funny and suceeds for the most part. but like most Wu Ma's movies  it has a depressing feel with a sad ending.,993945600,3,416,3.9759036144578315
8178636,3,B000009O19,I mainly like movies with ninjas in them,960595200,,40,4.125
