1539132,5,B00005JMZQ,"The original version was done by the Brits in 1990. Titled ""Traffik"" - it concerned the herion trade from Pakistan and its impact on life in Great Britain. It's a fascinating story with major characters in three distinct locations: Britian, Hamburg, and Pakistan. The characters of these three story-arcs interconnect and intertwine as the devastation of drug use and the futility of the drug war are laid bare.

If the story seems familiar, Steven Soderbergh retold it in his feature film ""Traffic"" in 1991. While shifting the locale to America, changing the drug to crack/cocaine and moving the source to Mexico, Soderbergh's version retains the essential elements of the British original:

A high ranking gov't official charged with fighting illegal drugs, his struggle as the problem hits close to home, the upscale wife of an arrested major drug dealer who steps into the drug trade to maintain her family's lifestyle, the local cops doing their best in the drug war, and the locals of the third world country - the source of the drugs - caught up in the dangerous business in their efforts to merely survive.

Now, 13 years later, USA network has updated the story yet again for the post-9/11 world. And a magnificent job they have done. While Soderbergh was content to do a straight remake, this newest version resets and recasts the characters and locations while only retaining the basic bullet-points of the plot. As dark, moody, and despairing as the original, the newest ""Traffic"" hits the mark.

I watched it as it ran on USA some months back and decided it would be a ""must-buy"" when it came out on DVD. To see that we will be getting a ""director's cut"" - well, that's just icing on an already delicious cake.

If your tastes run toward the gritty crime genre - Homicide:LotS / The Wire / French Connection / Prime Suspect - and you don't mind a little pessimism in your entertainment - you definitely want this latest telling of a story of our time.",1093219200,20,1964,4.764705882352941

1539544,4,B00005JMZQ,"i would have given this mini-series five stars, except it is not quite as  good as the first traffic mini-series(british). this one is canadian. the usa  film version(michael douglas) is poor in comparasion to either the canadian or british version.",1396742400,,249,5.2
1539545,4,B00005JMZQ,This American re-make is good but the storyline is a bit way out and I preferred the original UK mini-series. The picture and sound are fine and it is good value for the money,1380067200,,175,4.176470588235294
1539546,5,B00005JMZQ,I couldn't stop watching. Terrific acting  and script and story---is Part 1 and 2 the whole miniseries? I am confused as I do not know this series at all.,1273104000,,154,4.310344827586207

1539548,5,B00005JMZQ,"Several years ago, I stumbled across the miniseries called Traffic on the USA Network.  At that time, I had recently seen the movie Traffic in the theater, so I thought I was watching a rerun of it.  To my surprise, what was presented in this miniseries was a group of stories than ran and interwove concurrently as a haunting and (sadly) relevant story.

Traffic, the miniseries, told the story of the illegal, heartbreaking, tragic ""trafficking"" of human beings, of illegal drugs, of dangerous biological substances, etc.  The motivations of those involved in the trafficking and those trying to stop the trafficking were superbly portrayed in four or five concurrent stories in multiple physical locations around the world.

Traffic's (the miniseries by USA Network) acting was superb, the stories were first-rate, the settings were realistic, the soundtrack helped dramatize the story, the actors were all perfectly cast etc.  The plot moved like a freight train; there were no slow moments at all.

Traffic was an outstanding and haunting movie.  I originally saw it over the course of three TV sessions, and I looked afterwards to see if USA Network would ever run it again, but they didn't.  I was so thrilled when I found it on Amazon.  I've seen it twice since obtaining it last month, and each time I watch it, I discover more in the story that I missed from the previous viewings.

I guess I was surprised that such a good movie as Traffic would come from a ""television"" network, but USA has proven to be one where outstanding stories, or series, are originated.  From USA, we have Monk, Psych, The 4400 (my favorite, next to Monk), etc.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised that USA should create such a fantastic story.
NOTE:  I do not work for USA, and I don't know anyone who does!

Traffic, the miniseries, is at the top of my all-time ""Top Five"" movies, and I've seen a lot of movies.",1190332800,4,1898,4.7439024390243905
1539549,1,B00005JMZQ,"As beautifully complex and layered as the Steven Soderbergh feature film was, this tv miniseries is just the opposite.  Simplistic to the point of being annoying, the characters in this movie make decisions for no other reason but to serve the plot.  Also, this disc contains no ""bonus features"" whatsoever.  Don't waste 3 hours of you life on this -- it shouldn't have been made.",1145923200,4,380,4.815384615384615
1539550,4,B00005JMZQ,"They leave you wondering what happens next! OK, I'll buy the next DVD, but where is it so I know how this ends. I feel like I got ripped off after 2 hours and it is just the teaser for the miniseries. I wait until 24 is finished in a season and watch the whole thing over a weekend: but I don't miss anything and I get the ending! What are we to do, chaulk this up to bad PR?",1106352000,4,375,3.7
1539551,1,B00005JMZQ,"When you see the phrases ""Director's Cut"" and ""New Twist Ending"", you expect to see the whole story.

But this deceiving DVD doesn't mention anywhere in the box that IT ONLY INCLUDES PART 1 AND PART 2!!!!!!!!

It's an unfinished story!!!!!

They should wait to have the whole story before selling this DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I mean, don't get me wrong, It's a great story. In fact, it's so interesting that it's disappointing not to be able to watch the ending.

This miniseries deserves 5 Stars, but my disappointment makes me give it 1 Star.",1101168000,10,541,4.774193548387097
1539552,5,B00005JMZQ,"I bought the DVD without having seen this mini-series, just based on the previous theatrical film, Traffic and was really impressed by this latest installment. I was kind of skeptical, based on the lack of any really big name stars, but after watching it, I have to say that Elias Koteas, Cliff Curtis and the rest did a really fantastic job. Really keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting to see what happens next. Also, if you enjoy the series, ""24"", you will really, really like this show. Definitely worth checking out and buying if you really enjoy adding a great movie to your collection.",1100736000,7,598,4.598130841121495
