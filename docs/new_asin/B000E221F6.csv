8104536,5,B000E221F6,"This is a great series with awesome clarity. We saw it originally on the INHD channel and liked it so much we purchased it. It really is fantastic with the explanations of where certain customs originated. It also gives you a feel of what it would be like to be in the stadium. Even though I am from TN originally, this is as close as I've ever gotten to actually being at a UT football game. If you are a college football fan, you MUST see this series!!!! The only thing that would make it better would be if it was also in HD DVD format.",1194566400,,539,4.09433962264151
