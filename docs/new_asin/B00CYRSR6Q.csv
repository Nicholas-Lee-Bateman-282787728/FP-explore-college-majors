8587716,2,B00CYRSR6Q,"There is a lot of informative material in this dvd. The problem I have with this video is that ti's not in depth enough. For instance. Mandy shows how to build a parasitic amp gauge . In the drawing he has a ground. WHAT'S IT GROUNDED TO!!!!!  It's in a plastic  case and the power and ground are insulated circuits. Everyone who looked at t his schematic could not figure out this ground . So I called a number I found and had the opportunity to speak to Mandy Concepcion. In the conversation , he dodged the question about this ground by saying that he could not recall the circuit. He asked me to send it to him via Likened, I wonder why? Maybe, he wanted to take it to an electrical engineer so he could have an answer to give me . Also , his schematic shows two toggle switches. In the video, the unit that is being used , only  has one toggle switch. I can only find one word to describe this video ' ABSTRUSE'  .  You're constantly confused, always asking questions.  I also realized that some of the devices featured in this video was more costly then just buying one out-write.",1409011200,,1086,4.273170731707317
