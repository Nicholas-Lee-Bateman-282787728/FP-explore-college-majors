8401601,5,B003ODKZXW,"When I heard gore and heavy metal I was sold! So when I come to find out that I also get great and hilarious 80's references cleverly placed EVERYWHERE in the movie, memorable visual FX and gags that were stylishly pulled off with a zero budget, AND a chicken henchman I knew it was something I'd watch again and again. And I have. The Silver Bullet crew has been hosting screenings of this self proclaimed ""Rock and Roll Bloodbath"" throughout Detroit over the last year. This movie has ""cult classic"" written all over it. This will be one of Troma's greatest acquisitions since Cannibal The Musical.",1283558400,,600,4.669811320754717
8401602,5,B003ODKZXW,"It's only fitting that Heavy Mental was picked up by Troma. Silver Bullet Pictures IS the Tromaville of Detroit. The movies is filled with twisted humor and blood, guts and gore. Everything that makes a great indie horror flick.

I have seen the movie 5 or 6 times now, in various stages of development and I have to say that I find something new to love about it with each viewing. My suggestion is you buy Heavy Mental, then got to [...] and pickup the rest of the Hartman Horror Collection.",1283472000,,493,4.417582417582418
8401603,5,B003ODKZXW,"Not only does this flick feature a kick ass opening music video which accurately parodies 80's hair band music videos, but it's got one of the best head crushing scenes in years and a truly awesome heavy metal monster hero! Easily the best thing Troma has distributed in years other than their own stuff. It's got all the blood, guts, gore and bad comedy one expects in a proper Troma flick but it's also got a special Detroit flair to it!",1283385600,,439,4.432098765432099
8401604,5,B003ODKZXW,"Heavy Mental is phenomenal and now my #1 favorite movie of all time! Not only is there awesome special fx that rival any Hollywood movie, but the music rocks and the comic timing is great. The characters are so original and the story line amazing. This is a must see for any horror buff! The writer/director has other films out that need to be seen if you love this movie! I LOVE HEAVY MENTAL!!!!",1283385600,,396,4.364864864864865
8401605,4,B003ODKZXW,I enjoyed Heavy Mental very much.  I would recommend any fan of Troma to check it out.,1281398400,,86,4.0588235294117645
8401606,5,B003ODKZXW,"I love Troma and I love this movie!!! It has it all, blood, guts, humor, and rock and roll!!! Can't wait to get my copy!",1280793600,,120,3.84
8401607,5,B003ODKZXW,"Heavy Mental is a rock n roll blood bath from the creators of Detroit blood City and Beaver Lake Zombies. Troma Entertainment (the Toxic Avenger brings you the latest in Independent horror. Heavy Mental is loaded with gore girs and a rocking metal sound track. Monique Dupree and Brenna Lee Roth are at there Tromarific best. With a cameo from Lloyd Kaufman and enough arm rips,  head crushes and  lesbians to make even toxie blush, Heavy Mental is a must see for any Troma fan!",1280448000,,478,4.6117647058823525
