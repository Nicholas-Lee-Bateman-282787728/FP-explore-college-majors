8701391,2,B00TEQMPOA,"Also known as ""April Rain.""

A group of Homeland security types has people undercover wanting to stop the bad guys from ""raining"" down on LA. The plot is super simple. The music and sneers let you know who the bad guys are. The sound editor didn't know what to do with gun fire during the slow motion shoot outs...heck just put it anywhere. The only real conflict in the film is supplied by women who are either wives, ex-wives, girlfriends, or bosses. This is a film where Luke Goss emerges as the best actor, something I would not have expected. Near the end Luke suddenly pulls out a Bible and hands it to a fellow agent proclaiming, ""There are no atheists in foxholes."" Where did that come from?

This feels like a pilot for a TV program as the ending doesn't give you closure.
