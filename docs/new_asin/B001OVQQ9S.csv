8331647,2,B001OVQQ9S,"I gave this set of Adventures In Paradise 2 stars only because it is a hard to find series and so having it is better than not having it at all BUT the quality deserves 1 star only. The video has not been restored at all and the audio is low and scratchy in many of the episodes. Also, the episodes are not even in chronological order! You watch an episode from season two then one from a previous season and the mix up goes on and on. That makes no sense to someone who wants to see the series from the beginning in the original broadcast order. Is that too much to ask for??

A classic, well respected series such as Adventures In Paradise deserves better. Hopefully, someone someday will release a professionally restored version of this great series. In the meantime, unless you are a die hard fan, pass up this particular set.",1247875200,12,831,4.361290322580645
