7863555,2,6304133332,"I bought this video for my 2 year old after recalling this popular series from the 90s.  I didn't think this video held up with time at all; the show isn't educational and seems a bit empty (in content and set design) compared to today's children's programming.  My son chuckled a few times at the bananas' silliness, but I am really glad we paid very little for this used video.  I would recommend not bothering with this series.",1116374400,,430,4.487179487179487
