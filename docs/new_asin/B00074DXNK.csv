8044623,3,B00074DXNK,Everything was OK with this video except the horrible aspect ratio. The film was originally shot in 2.35:1 but is released on DVD as 1.85:1 INSIDE a 1.33:1 frame.  Unfortunately this was released by Venevision when 4:3 TVs were the norm.  A shame as the transfer is good with original Spanish language and optional English subtitles.,1403654400,,333,4.928571428571429
