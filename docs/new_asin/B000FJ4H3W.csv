8123514,3,B000FJ4H3W,"This is a very mediocre Depression comedy from 1935.  With stars of this caliber, one would expect more.  The script is exceedingly shallow and predictable, and the laughs are very few indeed.  Fred and Colbert give it their best, but there isn't much even the best actors can do with this lame story line. Best forgotten.",1185408000,9,322,4.714285714285714
