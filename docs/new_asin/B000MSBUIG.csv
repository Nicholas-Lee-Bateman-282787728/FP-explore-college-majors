6609521,5,B000MSBUIG,Loved this short film when it first came out -- and still love it today! I have really enjoyed downloading movies to my computer to be viewed later using Amazon's free Unbox Video Player.,1393200000,3,187,4.529411764705882
6609522,4,B000MSBUIG,Geri's game is a different but cute short film. A little on the strange side. My four year old grandson seemed to enjoy it.,1392508800,2,123,4.166666666666667
6609523,2,B000MSBUIG,"Looney old man entertains himself in the park on a nice day - no real message here, noreal comedy, just fluff",1387324800,,109,4.238095238095238
6609524,4,B000MSBUIG,The snicker at end is the best. This is not likely to impress the youngest viewer. It is a little slow to start and takes some understanding to peel back the layers in this short about a man out witting himself at chess.,1367020800,3,220,4.1395348837209305
6609525,5,B000MSBUIG,"One of my favorite Pixar shorts, well worth the few dollars to add it to your library.  Story about an old man who decides to play a game of chess against a worthy opponent.",1358553600,4,173,4.088235294117647
8676206,4,B000MSBUIG,Very cute and thought provoking cartoon. Meaningful and humourous to adults but a very short film. I really wish it had be a full length story.,1523923200,,143,4.538461538461538
8676207,5,B000MSBUIG,"What makes this short so wonderful is the fine details. Every hair on Geri's head and eyebrows is shown, the wrinkles in his coat, the knuckles on his fingers, and so forth.",1485993600,,173,4.4375
8676208,5,B000MSBUIG,Great graphics for the time when it was made! Funny short.,1482624000,,58,4.363636363636363
8676209,5,B000MSBUIG,I do not understand why only 65% are 5 stars when I bought this.  They have not spent enough time with an older relative!  I worked in a continuing care & nursing home.  This is hilarious with wide open eyes... the best part is the trophy they play for!!!  Should be an evaluator when hiring staff for any CCRC.,1481587200,2,311,4.220338983050848
8676210,5,B000MSBUIG,My little girl loves this short,1470700800,,31,4.333333333333333

8676212,2,B000MSBUIG,Not worth the price.,1456704000,,20,4.25
8676213,5,B000MSBUIG,"It was good when I saw it in Toy Story. FYI, all these shorts are free on Netflix. Amazon really wants $3 for a 6 min video",1447372800,,123,3.5925925925925926
8676214,5,B000MSBUIG,Great short film,1444089600,,16,4.666666666666667
8676215,5,B000MSBUIG,My father LOVED this and I didn't know why until I watched it myself.  Kids probably won't get the humor of it as I think it really does take a little maturity to fully enjoy what happens in his game.  It's a must see!  Doesn't take but a few minutes and you'll get a good laugh out of it.,1442188800,3,289,3.864406779661017
