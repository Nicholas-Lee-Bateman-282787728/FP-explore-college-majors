It is great for breathe technique, mantras, aligning chakras, spirituality and flexibility. Kundalini is a pure energy we all have that can be released with practice. I have not had a VCR in years and have been searching for this in DVD format. If anyone finds the dvd, please let me know. Thanks :)",1437782400,,406,4.355263157894737
7842981,5,6303315429,"Of the many yoga videos I have used, this one is by far my favorite. I do it nearly every day and when I skip a day, I really miss it. I always feel energized yet relaxed after doing the video. Ravi opens with ""Ong namo guru dev namo"" chanted three times and then combines breathwork, meditation, and various yoga poses--not at all like your typical Hatha yoga video. Ravi does tend to talk throughout the video, which some people might find distracting, but I am not bothered by it at all because his voice is calm and soothing and his puns are sort of amusing. Plus, I am so focused on doing the poses, meditation and breathwork that I really don't notice his talking. This is a video for someone at any skill level. Try it, stick with it for a few sessions, and you'll see how good it makes you feel. I would recommend this video to anyone.",1041292800,6,843,4.275
7842982,5,6303315429,"I started doing this video about three months ago on a daily basis because I was invovled in an accident that hurt my neck and my back. My occupational therapist recommended that I start doing Yoga because my muscles were so tight and I had very little flexability. I would never have imagined all of the benefits that have resulted because I bought this tape and use in on a regular basis. This is a life changing tape and well worth purchasing, especially at the price that it sells for at Amazon.",1000512000,7,499,4.434782608695652
7842983,5,6303315429,"I started to take a class and realized that I wanted a video to  do yoga at home. I had hoped to get my husband interested in it as he has a cronic back problem. My instructor did not recommend this video but told me to be careful to get a video that was not by an aerobic dance instructor ! I spent time reading reviews at amazon and paying attention to what they said.  This video is great. I feel great. I was very surprised that my husband liked it alot.(trust me, he is not the yoga type !)  After it , he said his back was better than it had been in years ! I look forward to doing it. I can't believe that it is 70 minutes long - it does not seem that - it is much better than my instructor.",985046400,4,698,3.8
