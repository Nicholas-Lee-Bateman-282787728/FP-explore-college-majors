3787671,5,B001T21R7I,"'My Family' has long been a Brit-com favorite of ours, so it is wonderful to now have this season 3 DVD added to our collection--what fun when we plan our own Brit-com night and 'My Family' is usually among the DVDs we like to watch the most...always good for a laugh...",1337040000,,270,4.313725490196078
3787672,5,B001T21R7I,I recommend this show to anyone who loves comedies. They just don't come any funnier than this one. I keep hoping to find more than the first four seasons. Hopefully they'll make their way over here soon.,1327708800,,204,4.54054054054054
3787673,5,B001T21R7I,"I ordered this DVD based on seeing this wonderful series on BBC TV.
My only compliant is that the series is currently on season 10 and
only the first 4 seasons are available in the United States.",1305504000,5,195,4.297297297297297

8340278,5,B001T21R7I,"Wonderful TV show. I watched the first 4 seasons out of order, and loved all of them. I am so disappointed that we can't get the remaining 7 seasons in the US. I don't understand why some shows are available as Region 1 DVDs, and others (Toast of London, Miranda, 2Point4 Children, After you've gone, Birds of a Feather, etc.) are only Region 2 DVDs. Someone like BBC America or Acorn should offer a streaming service to air these shows. What other option is there except to buy a multi-region DVD player and purchase these from overseas? Such a shame.",1478563200,,552,4.53

8340285,5,B001T21R7I,"Disclaimer:  Watch these in order, starting at season 1 to get the most enjoyment out of this series.  It stands well on its own, but our family loves My Family and it's fun to watch the kids grow over the seasons.  Every season a gem!!!!  I wish they made shows like this again.  T'would be fun to see the Harpers revisited.",1381881600,,325,4.262295081967213
