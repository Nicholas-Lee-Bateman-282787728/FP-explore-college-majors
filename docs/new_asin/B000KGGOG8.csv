8156824,4,B000KGGOG8,"If you have a Siberian Husky you must have this video. The focus here is on the now famous Iditarod race of dogsled teams to commemorate the transport by dogsled of medicine for an outbreak of disease in Anchorage. The film is exciting and the action is fast and furious. Husky lovers will enjoy the film of the race and commentary, but there is so much more to these amazing creatures. I'd enjoy a follow-up episode that focused on the dogs themselves and their amazing intelligence and beauty. I bought this for my wife, who rescued our husky six years ago. She loved it!",1290211200,3,573,4.519230769230769
