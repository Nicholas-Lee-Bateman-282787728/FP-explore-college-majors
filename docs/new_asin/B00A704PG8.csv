5391493,5,B00A704PG8,"Nualjan, a young pregnant woman, has spent a year searching for her missing husband- without a single clue. Runjuan, a widow, eventually allows Nualjan to stay in her rural mansion. At this rural mansion, Nualjan begins to question Runjuan's motives, and begins to see ghostly figures. The Unseeable is an atmospheric, immensely creepy, and genuinely scary film.

The story in this film is fantastic. It plays out like a classic ghost story- the ghost stories you're told as you grow up. In fact, Choy, a new friend of Nualjan, tells several spooky stories of the other residents and the terrifying figures she has seen on the mansion's grounds. It uses plenty of creepy imagery and spooky settings to create its horror atmosphere; it also uses amazing suspense to create some very effective jump scares to occasionally jolt the audience. The ending of the film is excellent, and wraps up perfectly - where many modern horror films fail, this film succeeds; it's similar to a certain film, but I won't mention it to avoid spoilers. It is very consistent, and the pacing is moderate. The music in this film is also amazing; some of this music gave off a ""Silent Hill"" (video game series) vibe. The acting was also great.

Overall, The Unseeable is an exceptional horror film- it's consistently scary, very creepy, and dreadfully suspenseful leading up to its haunting ending. As of 3/24/13, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming, a purchase is highly recommended for fans of horror, a rental otherwise.

The Unseeable has some strong violence and blood.",1364256000,11,1589,4.966165413533835
5391494,5,B00A704PG8,"Thailand has some of the best ghost stories available, and ""The Unseeable"" is another wonderful Thai tale of terror.  This one has a consistent story that -- while not strictly linear -- still is easy to follow.  The acting is wonderful and the setting is suitably creepy.  There are enough twists and jolts to keep you guessing right up to the end.  ""The Unseeable"" manages to be scary without the usual Asian horror trappings -- the black tangle of hair, the contortionist walk, etc.

For a tale of shivers, see The Unseeable.",1363910400,7,528,4.695652173913044
5391495,4,B00A704PG8,"Oh, I would love to travel to Thailand.  The movies shot there are so beautiful.  This one is no different.  The scenery is lush and colorful coupled with an ever building sense of tension from the frightening things happening.  This is not a slice and dice flick, this, as amazing as it may be is a horror movie.  I loved it and if I knew what the ending was going to be almost from the start it's only because I read and watch a LOT of horror movies.

5391497,5,B00A704PG8,"This is one of my favorite hidden gems. It's an underrated film with a slow, dream-like quality that brings you into the mystical world of Thailand, a land of deeply held superstitions that create a beautifully creepy setting. The story starts with a young woman whose lover left her pregnant and alone to find work in Bangkok to support them. Unfortunately, he disappears without a word and so Nualjan leaves home to try and find him. She arrives at an estate, needing rest, and is allowed to stay on by the caretaker, a stern older woman who runs things with an iron fist for her wealthy matron. Nualjan is told to never go near the main residence but soon she sees things that make her wonder what is going on in that home. Who is the man cutting wood at night? Why is an old woman living in a shed? Choy, another worker, seems to know, but what secrets does she keep?",1360886400,16,871,4.382716049382716

What you don't predict is how everything ties in together and why that house is filled with spirits from beyond.

5391620,3,B00A704PG8,"I'm rating 3 because the ending was enjoyable. Unfortunately, the last 20-30(tops) minutes were the most enjoyable. I think my problem with the movie was that it was meh... slow... but to be honest, I think it was a personal 'ick' on my part. The main character just can't seem to conquer more than one 'scared' face/position/emotion/anything until about ... eh... most of the film. Sadly, for me it was a deal-breaker. I've seen Thai horror and I own a couple that I love. This one was just... *sigh*... I'm the type that will hang in there the whole way. And I usually stick it out because I want to see the ending. However, I'm not so sure the interesting ending was worth the hour and something of watching. Now, had this been a short... could have been fantastic! Just cram all the important story lines and the ending, and we're good to go. Alas... a disappointment. I'm almost regretting giving this 3 stars... but hey... I'll grade on a curve with this movie. To each his/her own with this one... I don't recommend it... It  wasn't the ultimate WORST movie ever, per se... but... don't kill the messenger, right? lol",1393977600,2,1124,4.592039800995025

5391622,4,B00A704PG8,"Pen Choo Kab Pee (The Unseeable) (Wisit Sasanatieng, 2006)

What's worse than losing the man you love? Losing faith in love altogether.

Wisit Sasanatieng, according to the Netflix description for Pen Choo Kab Pee, is one of Thailand's foremost directors. I was kind of skeptical when I dialed this one up (I didn't connect him with the lovely Tears of the Black Tiger until just now when I looked him up on IMDB in preparation for writing this review), and I knew very little about it; I came out of it somewhat stunned. You have seen this plot before, I can almost guarantee it, but Sasanatieng does it up so stylishly, and with such heart, that some very well-trod ground feels fresh, new, and above all exciting. This is what a love story should be.

Plot: Nualjan (Where the Miracle Happens' Siraphan Wattanajinda) is pregnant and left in the lurch; her boyfriend Chob said he was off to Bangkok on business for a few days, but never returned. Nualjan leaves her small rural village in search of him. In her condition, however, she moves slowly and must stop to rest often. One of those stops is at a hostel in the middle of nowhere. The super, Ms. Somjit (The Coffin's Tassawan Seneewongse), is reluctant to let a soon-to-be unwed mother stay there, but she allows it on the condition that Nualjan stay away from the main house, the home of Madame Ranjuan (Suporntip Chuangrangsri in her only, to date, screen appearance), who has not been seen in public for some time now. Nualjan finds herself quickly bonding with another guest at the hostel, Choy (uncredited on IMDB, unfortunately, and the credits in the film are not subtitled). She soon starts wondering how it is that so many people at the inn know so much about her...

Yeah, it's been done, and when you get to the Big Twist, you will probably have seen it coming for at least half the movie. That doesn't matter one little bit, because this one is all about the journey. Kongkiat Khomsiri's script is so well-paced and gorgeous that I find it hard to believe this is the same guy who wrote Art of the Devil II; my guess is that Sasanatieng, who got his start in the business as a screenwriter (working with his pal Nonzee Nimibutr, whose name you may know from Three...Extremes II), had, shall we say, a strong hand between the original draft and the finished product. I was thoroughly enchanted with this movie, and recommend it highly; check it out at your earliest opportunity. ****",1390176000,5,2452,4.629885057471264
5391623,5,B00A704PG8,I watched this with a  friend than looked for it on amazon. This is a great scary movie. Not a blood and guts one but a good one that makes you jump. The ending made my jaw drop. If your a fan of horror or just want a good scare get this movie,1388620800,,243,3.5849056603773586
5391624,5,B00A704PG8,"If you are a fan of Asian horror movies then The Unseeable is a must see. Beautifully told and directed, it is a dark tale full of mystery, pain, and woe. Nauljan leaves her small village to search for her missing husband. Pregnant and afraid she ends up at a boarding house where she meets many strange people, who all hide their own sinister secrets. The Unseeable weaves a story that is terrifying, sad, and beautiful all at the same time. It has plenty of scares as Nauljan continues her quest to find her husband. As she searches for him what is unseen soon becomes seen. And the truth finally appears and sweeps you away in a final heart wrenching twist. This movie will stay with me for a very long time. Atmospheric and creepy. The story slowly unfolded before me like a flower, uncovering bit by bit, till all could be revealed. I recommend this film to any fan of Asian horror. It will not leave you disappointed.",1380844800,,923,4.4674556213017755
5391625,4,B00A704PG8,"Sometimes it was a little slow-paced for me, and one of the characters annoyed me to no end, but there was a big payoff.",1378252800,2,120,4.041666666666667
5391626,4,B00A704PG8,"3.5 stars. Starts off pretty iffy, but if you like ghost stories, stick with it. It slowly becomes more interesting. Then, in the last 15 or 20 minutes, very suddenly, there is a whirlwind of revelations that make it worth the wait. I recommend you watch the closing credits, which actually bring the story full circle, and add to the overall impact. One major shortcoming is an unfortunate lack of atmosphere, especially during the first 45 minutes or so, which is do largely to uninspired lighting, and an over reliance on loud whooshing wind effects. Nonetheless, worth sticking with, as the atmosphere does build; and, again, a nice pay off.",1376956800,3,645,4.872727272727273
5391627,4,B00A704PG8,"""The Unseeable"" is a slow-paced Thai ghost story which will appeal to those who like atmospheric supernatural dramas. A young pregnant woman, Nual, takes a trishaw to an old mansion in a secluded place. Nual, who is looking for her missing husband, begs for shelter and with the help of the resident maid, Choy, is able to persuade the stern caretaker to allow her to stay at the house for a while. But Nual has to adhere to some strict conditions - not to snoop around the adjacent big house, not to go wandering about at night, and more.

Before long, Nual makes some strange discoveries - there's a beautiful woman who lives in the big house but who shuns company, a strange little girl keeps asking her to play but then mysteriously disappears after leading Nual to an old antiques' room, and then there's the weird caretaker who always seems to pop-up out of nowhere only to scold Nual and warn her off.

The pieces of the puzzle that is the story gradually fall into place, and it is only in the last half hour of the 1.5 hour film that viewers get the answers they seek. This reminds me of the more traditional-themed ghost stories commonly found in Southeast Asia revolving around restless spirits. There are a couple of twists in the story that held my interest.",1368230400,,1271,4.545851528384279
5391628,5,B00A704PG8,"This is a great movie, it is not fast paced horror and gore at all. To me this was an average day all gone nasty wrong and that made it more frightening, have we not turned around at times feeling eyes on our back only to see no one. This movie has subtitles because it is a Thai production. This does not in my opinion take away from the movie.  A young pregnant woman is looking for her husband and winds up at a creepy estate. She has a threatening housekeeper who looks like Dracula's mother a yappy seemingly friendly fellow servant, an strange  beautiful lady whom she is not supposed to see. There is a man digging in the back yard,and a old crazy lady. The young lady starts seeing a child, who keeps leading her to a room with a locked trunk. From there it gets nasty creepy and genuinely frightening you wonder why the young lady does not just flee,  and when you find out it is a genuine surprise. This is a good story, it kept my attention throughout, the characters are brilliant. The film quality is crisp and clear, you do not miss anything.",1367193600,,1056,4.296482412060302

I first came across this and watched it here on Amazon in 2012 and it's haunted me ever since. For several years, I wanted to see it again, but I couldn't remember the title (which is completely generic and forgettable) or which service I'd watched it on. I spent ages searching online with keywords and poring over ""Best Of"" lists for Asian horror films, desperate to find it again, until I eventually stumbled across it on my Amazon watchlist.
