8044095,1,B0006ZIE4I,"This movie looks to be aimed at children, perhaps as a sleep aid. They have long scenes of poor CGI with some weird stuff happening on a casio keyboard. The characters stand there staring at each other not saying anything while their weird eyes roll around. It doesn't even stay true to the story as I felt there were some deviations.

I think the greatest crime here was the agency that awarded them some ""family film award"". That company, not the creators should return all the money any consumers ever paid for this.",1357862400,,519,4.580645161290323
8044096,4,B0006ZIE4I,"My 2 and 5 yo enjoy watching this dvd.  I was worried that they wouldn't like it because it depends SOOO much on the visual.  The narrator says a few things here and there-the story is primarily in the animation.  I was wrong, though-this dvd holds their attention completely.  I also believe it tells the story accurately, so it's a great teaching tool.  The soundtrack is also incredible.  I highly recommend this for anyone who wants their children to understand the building of the ark and Noah's faith in God better.",1281398400,,521,4.670329670329671
8044097,1,B0006ZIE4I,"My daughter just called me and said this was the worse childrens DVD story.  Hardley any music and it was hard to watch and enjoy for the children.  It's all animation and difficult to follow.  My grandson has know idea what it is about and he is almost 4.  I'm taking him to see the Noah Ark Children's Exhibit this Saturday and was hoping this DVD would help with understanding the story.

8044098,5,B0006ZIE4I,"This DVD production of the Noah's Ark story has accomplished exactly what I had hoped for my 3yr old son & 20 month old daughter: an interest in learning about the Lord and His involvement in the lives of those who trust Him.  My son often recites (in surprising detail) various scenes from the tale.  My daughter has absolutely fallen in love with this production of Noah's Ark -- no doubt due to the vibrant colors, moving score, and easy to follow lines.  I understand some reviewing this telling of the story may prefer stricter adherence to various nuances and literary exactness from Scripture - I can appreciate that as I am a literal believer of Scripture.  There is never a perfect retelling of any Biblical story that will appeal to everyone's preference.  As already mentioned, this achieved what I had hoped for my son and daughter: help them develop an interest in learning about the Lord, begin building a faith in the Lord, and trust in the Lord despite other's opinions.",1191542400,4,986,4.709302325581396
8044099,5,B0006ZIE4I,"This is a beautifully animated, very ""visual"" version of a classic story.  The scenes are well chosen and beautifully animated, the colors are vibrant, the story faithfully follows the Bible account.  The music soundtrack adds to the overall effect.  A very well done video.  Enjoyable and very worthwhile viewing!",1165276800,6,314,5.346938775510204
8044100,5,B0006ZIE4I,"This computer animation was one of the best childrens biblical films I have seen. The story is told in a context that a child can understand, but without being too corny. The music and sound effects in this film will blow you away.",1127347200,10,231,4.395348837209302
