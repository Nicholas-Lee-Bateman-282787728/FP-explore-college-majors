2047974,4,B0001ZX0GU,"I think a good number of people have tried a Ouija (a combination of the French and German words for yes, Oui - Ja) board at least once in their lives, most likely when they were younger, as we're generally more open and accepting in believing in the supernatural possibilities inherent within the game.  For those of you unfamiliar with it, it's a board inscribed with all the letters of the alphabet, numbers from 0 to 9, and the words yes, no, maybe, and good-bye.  There's also a piece called a planchette, which is a movable three-legged device people would put their fingertips on, and then pose questions that would be answered by whatever supernatural elements may be around at the time, spelling out words or pointing to the words printed on the board.  Do spirits actually move the planchette, sending messages from beyond the grave?  No...the movements are really caused by unnoticeable, and usually unintentional, forces of the persons whose hands are on the planchette, and usually end up spelling out gibberish and unintellible words.

Witchboard (1985), written and directed by Kevin Tenney, presents the notion that the Ouija board is actually a link to supernatural, even a portal at times, and what happens when a particularly nasty spirit decides to try and make use of the portal.  The film stars Tawny Kitaen (yes, the girl from the Whitesnake video), Todd Allen, who appeared in the very excellent western Silverado in the same year, and soap opera regular Stephen Nichols.  As the film begins, we are in the midst of a party, hosted by Linda (Kitaen), and her boyfriend Jim (Allen).  It seems to be going alright, although it seemed like there was something lacking from your typical 80's party, namely the cocainia...anyway, for some unknown reason, Linda has invited her old beau, Brandon (Nichols), and the tension soon rises between Brandon and Jim, as they used to be best friends, and Brandon blames Jim for stealing Linda away from him...whether he did or not, we will find out later, but mostly this just established Linda as a real bonehead for not taking more care in making up the guest list.  As a tension breaker, Linda suggests they play a game Brandon has brought, an Ouija board.  Brandon, a true believer, claims to have contacted many spirits, and also claims it's all the real deal, and not some hokem pokem child's game.  To prove it, he demonstrates the boards' power by trying to contact a deceased boy named David.  Contact is made, but there are a few who aren't convinced, Jim being one, and he basically says it's all a bunch of hooey, which seems to agitate the spirit, and causes some unexplained phenomena included the popping of the tires on Brandon's car.  As the guests leave, Brandon forgets to take his Ouija board, and so Linda starts using it by herself, which is dangerous as she soon starts acting strange as the spirit begins taking possession of her.  Questions begin arise, after a couple of particularly gruesome death of a friend, regarding the true nature of the spirit, its' intentions, and its' true identity.  Jim and Brandon manage to put aside their differences as they see changes within Linda, and fear she may be suffering from her contact with the unknown.  Who is the spirit and what does it want?  You'll find out...

This really isn't a bad little movie, as there seemed to be more emphasis on the suspense elements within the story rather than just a usual slasher picture that was so very common throughout the 80's.  The direction was capable, much better than I would have though, considering this was Tenney's first film, although the script did suffer some fairly lame dialog.  One thing I found highly annoying was the character of Jim and his constant use of the word `babe' when talking to his girlfriend Linda.  The development of the characters was a bit weak, especially the point of Jim's inability to say the words, ""I love you"" to his girlfriend.  His standard reply whenever she would speak the line was ""I know you do"".  This hardly endears him to the viewing audience, but it does set up for him to profess his love later on, as he and Linda endure much by the end of the movie, and allows him to appear to have grown through the ordeal...it was just such an obvious plot device.  Ms. Kitaen did better than I would have thought, as she does appear to possess a modicum of talent, and maybe with a stronger script, she might have come off better (there's even a brief nude shower scene).  I felt a little disconnected from the story, as the protagonist was an invisible spirit throughout, whose motives were a bit murky until near the end.  We finally do meet him, but I couldn't help think the movie would have benefited had he appeared sooner in the film.  The plot does manage to stay on track through, avoiding major plot holes, and wraps up nicely with a less than shocking twist.  It did plod along at more than one point, causing the film to run longer than I thought necessary, at a whopping 98 minutes.  The worst part about the film was that of character Zarabeth, a medium, played by character actress Kathleen Wilhoite.  You may remember her starring opposite Charles Bronson in the 1986 film Murphy's Law.  I find her so completely annoying on so many levels.

The wide screen print here looks great and special features include a commentary track by the director and a couple of producers.  Also included is a 23 minute `making of' documentary, a theatrical trailer, and a couple of TV spots.  Finally, inside the case, is a mini reproduction of an Ouija board, complete with pointer.  Anchor Bay does a great job with the release, so while the film is three stars, I am giving one extra for the overall release.

2047975,4,B0001ZX0GU,"I first started watching horror as a youngster in the mid-to-late eighties and ""Witchboard"" is one of those films that holds a special nostalgic place in my heart.  The craze back in those days was the slasher film and innumerable amounts of such movies made it into my VCR.  But despite being released in the middle of the slasher craze Witchboard dared to be different, a supernatural horror film involving witchcraft through a Ouija board.  This one hit especially close to home since in those days me and my friends would often gather into our basements with a Ouija board of our own, in a vein attempt to conjure spirits of the dead.  Finally, this 80's gem sees a release on DVD (complete with a pullout mini ouija board) thanks to Anchor Bay, who have also just released the equally excellent 80's classic ""Night of the Demons.""

Guests at a house party for 30-somethings start fooling around with a Ouija board and conjure up the spirit of ""David"" a 10-year old who died in a tragic boating accident.  The day after the party, Linda begins experimenting with the board on her own in an attempt to learn more about the spirit of David.  As it turns out, using the Ouija board alone is a big no-no and soon Linda finds herself being stalked and terrorized by the spirit inside of the Ouija board.  Her husband and a friend take a drive to the town where David died to try to uncover the reasons for the spirit's hostility towards Linda.  But as the two soon find out, David is not the only spirit communicating through the Ouija board...

""Witchboard"" is a horror film that relies more on suspense than gore or a high body count.  The first half of the movie has a slow pace, although it still manages to entertain.  This is a movie that is unabashedly eighties: the clothing, the hairstyles (Mullets for the guys, Cindy Lauper do's for the gals), a punky-looking psychic chick and some kicking heavy metal music.  Ah, the joy.  Where the movie picks off is when the two guys go on a roadtrip into the town where the spirit of David died.  The action picks up and builds to an exciting climax featuring a demon with a Linda Blair type of voice-over.  The acting is not great by any stretch but it's not horrible either.  It's refreshing to see an eighties horror film that doesn't focus on horny teenagers as fun as that can be, and instead has a cast comprised exclusively of adults who try their best to look serious despite the ridiculous premise.  With the death of VHS, movies like these have become very hard to find and that's why I'm glad many studios have started re-releasing these movies for a new generation to enjoy.  Kudos Anchor Bay!",1094169600,7,2654,4.53781512605042
2047976,5,B0001ZX0GU,"I received my DVD recently. In keeping with the theme of the movie, there is a large imprint of a planchette on the disk. There's a paper insert with the scene selections on one side and a Ouija board on the other with a little planchette that can be removed to play the game.

Five stars go to Anchor Bay for their time and effort on this DVD. Now how about ""Witchboard 2"", ""Witchtrap"", and ""Pinocchio's Revenge""?

""Witchboard"" is a noteworthy movie from the 80s, revolving around an evil spirit that passes through a Ouija board and possesses a young woman.

This DVD is an excellent addition to my collection. Once again, thank you Anchor Bay.",1094169600,7,646,4.551724137931035
2047977,4,B0001ZX0GU,"Looking through my DVD collection, i have to say that Anchor Bay titles make up 50% of it and they did it again with this cult classic!
For people that didn't see the movie, it of course revolves around a ouija board (duh!) and people start getting pocessed by it and well it's pretty much predictable after that. The movie is not the scariest movie i've seen but it has it's moments, the acting is pretty decent and the story although again very predictable, still is entertaining.
FUNNY STORY...
I remember when i was young, my brother after watching this movie went out and bought a Ouija board from Toys r us and it freaked me out so much that i burned it in the backyard, and while it was burning, i went to do something else, then came back and saw my parents trying to stop the fire that spread to the cabin! Now, i knew it was not a demonic presence that made this happen but i still remember being punished, grounded and no tv or nintendo for a month..should of blamed it on the devil!

2048021,4,B0001ZX0GU,"Witchboard 1986..is a movie about the Ouija Board..this is by far the BEST movie pertaining to this subject and puts to shame the very boring and disappointing new release of this past Octobers  movie Ouija.

Plot Summary:

The movie begins with a gathering of friends at a party and one of the guests Brandon has also brought with him a very decorative spirit board referred to as Ouija aka ""Witchboard"".

Brandon is an expert in the field of talking boards and begins to explain to everyone at the party just how Ouija works. Most of the guests are unconvinced by Brandon's descriptions about how the board works and are skeptical. Some are even laughing and making fun of the whole concept. Brandon explains that in order to get the best results from a Ouija it is important that you have two players preferably a man and a woman and that both participants be free from drugs and alcohol.  Everyone at the party is under the influence except one person, Linda, who seems to have a keen interest in the subject. Brandon specifically requests Linda's participation and she reluctantly volunteers after being pressured by all the other guests. One guest in particular, Jim, begins heckling Brandon as well as the spirit David; a ten year old boy who died by drowning.

As Jim continues harassing Brandon and insulting the spirit contact. David grows very upset and the planchette (indicator/pointer) flies violently off the board. To the shock of the room Brandon's tires to his new sports car has also been flattened by an unknown source. Brandon explains that David is angry and has decided to take it out on him. instead of Jim because he was in control of the board at the time of Jim's insults. Brandon inadvertently leaves his Ouija Board at Linda's house during this commotion. where Linda, now having had a supernatural experience with the Witchboard..decides that she would like to try using the board alone to re-connect with the spirit David. David begins to entice Linda's continued use by revealing that her lost wedding ring is stuck in the drain of her bathroom sink. Surprised to find her ring exactly where David tells her it is she slowly begins to become obsessed with using the board.

Knowingly ignoring Brandon's advice of "":never using the board alone"" she attempts to put the board away which causes David to get very upset. David begins terrorizing Linda and this causes Brandon to embark on a one man mission to stop David in his tracks and save Linda from becoming completely possessed by the growing wrath of David. Unbeknownst to all, David turns out to be much more malicious than even Brandon suspects and the people that Linda love the most start having ""accidental"" deaths. Linda starts exhibiting signs of demonic possession i.e. excessive cursing, fits of rage and unusual behavior. this sends Brandon and Jim on a quest to communicate with David at the place of his drowning. Little do they know evoking the spirit of David sends them on a one way ticket to meet one of the most ferocious and malignant demons of all in hell.

My personal experience and opinion:

As you can see by my plot explanation there is quite a bit of depth for a horror movie from the late 80's  Since I own a very large talking board collection and have a rather extensive history with the Ouija product I can attest to much of the information provided as being very accurate to a large degree even  if much of it is based on hysteria. Since I was extremely disappointed in how the new ""Ouija"" movie was handled and represented..I feel it is important for me to describe exactly the highlights from the movie I greatly approve of.

1) The original lore of the mysterious Ouija remains intact and is cleverly described and depicted.

2) Magnificent board design with decorative artwork including angels from heaven, this really gives the board a very supernatural look and personality of its own. This is important since the bulk of the movie is centered around this.

3) Cool camera tricks that show what it looks like from the spirits perspective.. Nice twists throughout the movie that aren't anticipated or expected. Some interesting death sequences that is presented as coincidental accidents and is reminiscent of the deaths in the movie Final Destination. More than one board design is shown with the second having a much more demonic appearance.

4) Genuinely spooky and actually informative. Here is an exert of dialogue from the movie as an example:

Party guest: How can you believe in spirits if you don't believe in God or Satan?

Brandon: There's been evidence of their existence. Eye witness accounts, photographs, recordings...you name it and I have contacted some of them.

Party guest: What with a wee-gee board?

Brandon:  Ouija. It's pronounced Wee-ja not wee-gee. It comes from the French and German words for yes. Oui and Ja. Ouija. And this is a planchette (shows the boards pointer)

Lloyd: I don't care what you call it dude. It's just a game like Checkers or Chess.

Brandon: For your information..""dude"" the Ouija board has been around since recorded history. It was in wide use as far back as 540 BC.  Now for the best results, the Ouija should be used by two people. Preferably a man and a woman and it shouldn't be sitting on a table, it should sit on our knees so there is as much body contact as possible. Also the two people should have clean, pure systems. So that the energy flowing thru us to the planchette is as strong as it can be.

Linda: Are you saying that the spirits actually come through our bodies?

Brandon:  Oh don't worry it's perfectly safe.

Linda: I don't think I understand what you mean by ""clean systems"" though.

Brandon: Someone who doesn't smoke or drink..like you Linda. Care to give it a try?  Good, I don't smoke either and I haven't been drinking tonight. So together we should be able to make a clear strong contact. Alright one more thing before we begin,  The spirits are lousy spellers and a lot of them like to lie. So just to play it safe, I'm going to try and contact David; the spirit of a little boy who died about 30 years ago. I have contacted him several times. For some reason he is connected to this particular board. I don't now why really it's just that every Ouija board seems to have its own dominant spirit. Maybe it's because this board was made the day David died.

Review conclusion and final thoughts:

I have to point out some flaws...well there is a few complaints...since it was made in the late 80's the hairstyles and clothing are very dated. the set locations are pretty good though. Trying to rate this movie is a bit tough..can't give it 5 stars because there is some complaints but because this is the only movie about the Ouija that is dead on (no pun intended)  I will give it 4 stars .

This movie will either scare you away from using the Ouija or it's going to entice you to get out the old Ouija Board and give it a go. The movie makes the whole concept of what the Ouija game is..exciting and fun the way it's intended to be. The whole scene where David tells Linda where to find her lost wedding ring is a prime example of this. Who doesn't want to learn information that should be lost or hidden from us or having the future predicted ahead of time? This is what makes the Ouija Board fascinating and this is the general motivation for someone to use it. The idea that you might get in contact with a long lost relative or a family member who has passed away is also alluring

Some very good dialogue and hilarious put-downs. The music is very good..quite a few jump scares..some of these are timed so perfect that no matter how many times I see it and know ahead of time its going to happen..still scares the s*** outa me. .plenty of one-liner sarcasm that will make you chuckle every time as well.

The acting was sub-par and I feel like it was really corny at times.

I think I rented this film from Hollywood Video back when those were around

when I was like 10 or 11.  I did not like it then cuz i thought it was boring.

After re-watching it 15 years later I still feel the same way.

I am actually surprised this film made 10 mil at the box office honestly.

Im guessing it actually had a marketing campaign LOL.

Really, im not trying to diss this film by any means, I think its worth a watch.

Its just not a movie I would re-watch again.

Nor a movie I would be excited to show my wife or to tell a friend about.

The story surrounding the Ouija board was well crafted with a believable love triangle and a story about friendship intertwined in the mix.  The characters are very likeable, which keeps you interested as you actually care about what happens to them.  That is an essential component to making a movie like this work and it does the job well.  Actress Tawney Kitaen was a perfect casting choice for the lead role as she is empathetic and incredibly sexy.  Todd Allen and Stephen Nichols are also fantastic as two former friends who are forced to connect again due to the circumstances of this intriguing ouija-board mystery.  It isn't as spooky to me now as it was when I saw it as a kid.  But the story is still a good one and I enjoyed taking the ride again on Blu Ray.  The Blu Ray quality was pretty good.  I'd give the picture a 3.5 out of 5.  It's the best I've even seen it look.  Sound is good as well.  And the Extras are an absolute pleasure!

2048182,4,B0001ZX0GU,"Scream Factory continues its celebration of Kevin Tenney genre films with their Blu-ray release of ""Witchboard."" I still remember my friends talking about this surprisingly good flick when it first came out in 1986. 28 years later, it still both holds up well and reminds viewers of the cheese served up in the greatest decade of horror.

Linda Brewster is introduced to a centuries old tool of communication with the dead called a Ouija board. Although warned of the danger it holds, she begins summoning the spirit of a 10-year-old boy named David. She soon realizes that her dalliances with the dead were a mistake as the presence becomes stronger and violent. What sinister entity did Linda let loose in our world?

""Witchboard"" is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.85:1) and DTS-HD Audio Mono. Like most of the Blu-ray upgrades we get from this era, the movie looks and sounds better than it ever has. However, its digital transfer hasn't sucked all the ""real"" film feeling out of it. Its upgraded audio enhances every scream and dramatic crash of the musical score.

Loads of bonus material is included with ""Witchboard."" New audio commentary is provided by Writer/Director Kevin Tenney and actors Stephen Nichols, Kathleen Wilhoite, and James Quinn. Additional commentary features Tenney, Executive Producer Walter Josten, and Producer Jeff Geoffray chatting about the film. There are also new interviews with Kevin Tenney, Tawny Kitaen, J.B. Luebsen, James Quinn, Walter Josten, Todd Allen, and others. A vintage ""Making of 'Witchboard'"" featurette, theatrical trailer, TV spots, still gallery, and much more can be found.

""Witchboard"" is rated R for violence, language, adult situations, and nudity. Everything you would expect from a 1980s horror film is what you're served here. Is the nudity necessary? Of course not, but sadly producers felt it was a needed item to sell genre films at the time.

Most religious folks will definitely give ""Witchboard"" a thumbs down, and with good reason. The movie doesn't really tell people not to play with Ouija boards. It warns that you shouldn't play with them alone. This can cause one to become obsessed and then possessed by the spirit attached to it. What people should take away from the film is that it's just not smart to try communicating with the dead or get involved with the occult or anything with the power to unleash a malevolent entity.

""Witchboard"" is full of all the wonderful schlock you would expect from a horror film released in 1986. There are nave characters doing incredibly dumb things and meeting horribly entertaining demises. Why would someone continue to communicate with a spirit that is growing constantly more violent and active? How many weird accidents have to happen around you before you realize something's not right? Also, was it really legal to smoke in the waiting room of a hospital in 1986? None of those questions are answered in the movie. However, there are some fun scares to be had in the journey to its climax.",1390262400,,3027,5.044
2048183,5,B0001ZX0GU,"For as old as this movie is and to receive one in such pristine condition is simply remarkable.

D: Kevin Tenney
C: Tawny Kitaen, Todd Allen, Stephen Nichols, Kathleen Wilhoite, Rose Marie
P: A young woman becomes consumed by a spirit conjured via a Ouija board who shows a taste for violent murders.

Well paced, well cast, well done horror outing features some nifty scare sequences and builds up a decent amount of suspense. Witchboard pretty much does everything right, but it never stands out for any one noteworthy element either.

Witchboard in essence is one of those films that when asked How was it? responses generally are It was good. However, pinpointing that element that made it good is the difficult part. See Witchboard doesn't do anything that makes it memorable or separates it from the pack. Witchboard is definitely watchable. It maintains interest. However, it's just serviceable entertainment, nothing more. [R] 101 mins.",1389139200,,980,5.189873417721519
2048185,5,B0001ZX0GU,One of my all time favorite horror movies. The eighties had a lot of fun slashers and this one was right at the top in my opinion. Although not a typical psycho killer stalks victims slasher it has some of the same elements. If you like supernatural horror or stuff that deals with the occult defintely check this out. Big ups to scream factory for giving this the collectors edition blu-ray that it deserves. They are continuing to put out great old school titles every month. Also olive films just released part 2 on blu-ray recently. And it isn't as good as the first but it is up there with it.

2048186,5,B0001ZX0GU,"I chose this rating because I enjoy the Ouija Board! Most people are very superstitious as the movie portrays, but I am not! I even ordered one from the 60's as I had one of the originals but lost it! I'm sure it is where it should be now or it would have made it's way back to me or then again maybe it did!!!!!!! Love this movie!",1383782400,,331,3.8823529411764706
2048187,4,B0001ZX0GU,"I'm sure any horror fan reading this is aware of the backwash of horror films lining the video shelves in the 80's during the great slasher craze. The market was saturated with dozens of low-budget flicks lacking in plot, effects, and honed by big-name directors trying to make a buck while dreaming and drooling of bigger, better things.  As a result a few gems tended to drown in the shuffle, and when glancing just briefly at the cover of Witchboard and reading its synopsis, it's easy to prejudge it as another dead fish devoid of acting genius or anything more than cheap thrills and kills. But, with it being made by the same man who dished out Night of the Demons, could it actually have what it takes to keep its head above the water and survive?

We start with a party. A lovely social gathering that ends in the traditional bickering, threats of violence, thrown out tires, and of course evil spirits. Linda Brewster, the hostess and house owner, is clearly the eye of the crowd. Her boyfriend, Jim, sits by her with his idiotic friends, while across from her is the intellectual ex-lover, now friend, Steven. Steven was also friends with Jim in childhood - ""like brothers"" - but now they are mortal enemies and in love with the same woman. Linda cares for Steven and always will but not in 'that way', and she loves Jim - who also loves her, but because of psychological issues can't say the words. Steven, knowing everything about Jim, already preguesses this fact, another spur to dig into his ex-friends side during the increasingly bitter relationship.

Now, before you turn off the film thinking you accidentally stumbled into a soap opera instead of a horror movie, (even though ironically one of the leads went on to star in soaps), here's where it gets good. Steven's Ouija board is left behind and Linda, not knowing better, begins playing with the board herself. Pretty soon she's confused on what's real and what's not, and ultimately whether the 'spirit' is friend...or foe. Will the three be able to settle their differences and work as a team to vanquish the spirit and save Linda, or will their inability to relate to each other only enable the evil to tighten its grip?

The ouija holds a fascinating backstory of legend and creepy ookiness, yet is sadly not covered enough in horror films and given its due. Sure, it may be mentioned briefly but as a central focal point the movies are few and far between. I'd wager not many have achieved such good use of the device as Witchboard, which, while it does stumble on a few steps, manages to capture ones attention and hold it. Generally films of the 80's enjoyed making the most of the low-budget effects by mindlessly painting on the gore, no matter how cheap looking, and injecting laughs for extra. Here Witchboard tries to have the audience ignore it's lower budget crutch, leaving little gore and minimal violence, instead trying to do a sleight of the hand and introduce actual story.  It's not really about a possessed woman going mad as in the Exorcist; it concerns a slow sort of possession in an almost psychological way. Tension is consistently high between Brandon and Jim, best friends as youths, and now rivals in adulthood. The acting wasn't top notch but it worked, rubbing me the right way, while enough back story is added so the viewer has a clear idea of what's going down. Not only that, but there's something likeable about most of the main players, all working their own senses of charm and weaknesses.

Suspense is built up in certain scenes, done very well by director Kevin Tenney (Night of the Demons). The bizarre shots of the spirit going fast, where the viewer sees this through the 'spirits' eyes, is extremely effective, adding a sense of fun and weirdness. There are a few instances that were tear-jerking, emotional, freaky, funny, and of course, as is inevitable in some B movies, dull. Don't go to watching Witchboard expecting violence and gore; they took it another direction here. There ARE deaths, and great ones at that, but not many. Blood drips, but it doesn't gush. This, thankfully, doesn't deter from the enjoyment of this particular film.

Todd Allen as Jim provides comedic,  jerk relief. He looks pretty good, his acting style isn't bad, his dialogue is fitting, and he holds up the main emotional drama of the flick. Stephen Nichols as Brandon, who later goes on to blink his baby blues in soap operas, acts a little stiff here and I can't figure out if that was intended or not. Either way, I still liked him, and his character was sorely needed to keep this thing working. Tawny Kitaen plays Linda, a redheaded, goody two shoes, not much sense kind of gal. She worked, but her character just wasn't as interesting as the men's. The other stand out is the goofy to the extreme psychic, Zarabeth, is either a hate or love person. I've seen some say they loved her, while I loathed her. She was too much, too dopey, too irritating, thankfully not stealing too much time on screen. Her small role was already too much; I began to wonder if she was possessed!

Once the game is over and the planchette has been stored away, memories remain of a fun, if a bit silly time that doesn't go overboard in the typical way. Tenney tried hard for true drama, and he succeeded, but whether the rest of it fit in well enough is still up in the air. Unforgettable, a good use of an intriguing horror device, and stocked with slightly off kilter drama that's oddly mesmerizing, Witchboard is definitely worth a watch.",1379635200,,5527,4.672147995889003

2048223,4,B0001ZX0GU,"A year before she unleashed her hotness on the music video scene by appearing in several Whitesnake videos (and some two decades before she assaulted then-husband Chuck Finley and was arrested for cocaine possession), redhead Tawny Kitaen starred in Witchboard, which I consider to be one of the better non-blockbuster horror films of the glorious 1980s.  Having just seen it again for the first time in over twenty years, I have to say it still holds up well all these years later.  Well, there is one horribly bad special effects shot near the end, but its impact is somewhat mitigated by the fact that this movie doesn't really rely on special effects to do its thing.  Witchboard is all about instilling suspense and fear into the atmosphere swirling around a trio of well-developed characters.  At first, it looks like you're in for another boring ride on the arrogant rich boy vs. impudent poor boy train, but that begins to change once the spirits come out to play.

I'm not exactly sure why Linda (Tawny Kitaen) would invite ex-boyfriend Brandon (Stephen Nichols) to a party with her new boyfriend Jim (Todd Allen), especially when she knows both men are now ex-best friends, but she does.  As the snarky comment meter begins to push in to the red, Linda overcomes her misgivings and actually welcomes the idea of trying out Brandon's Ouija board.  The pair succeeds in making contact with the spirit of a little boy that Brandon has spoken with before - but Jim's litany of condescending comments angers the spirit.  In all of the commotion, Brandon leaves his Ouija board there at Linda's and Jim's apartment.  Over the next few days, Linda unwisely - albeit unknowingly - starts using the board alone to speak to ""David,"" and that is when the troubles start coming fast and furious.  Lives are lost as Linda's obsession with using the Ouija board increases, ultimately putting her own life in danger.  Brandon soon comes to realize what is happening (progressive enchantment by a sinister spirit), but he can do little to help Linda without Jim's help - and that's a pretty long row to hoe.

Witchboard is by no means scary, but it does sneak a few surprising moments into the mix, and the creepy atmosphere is effective even if it never becomes palpable.  Jim is a rather stoic character, and Todd Allen plays him as such pretty well; Tawny Kitaen earns her scream queen stripes with a more than satisfactory performance as the vulnerable (and hot) potential target for possession; but it is Stephen Nichols' performance that really  makes this something of a 1980s classic horror film.  With Jim playing the doubting game so well, Brandon really has to appear sincere and genuinely troubled by the potential danger the Ouija board poses for Linda - and Nichols pulls that off amazingly well.  I also have to mention Kathleen Wilhoite, who is impossible to forget in the minor role of California's kookiest medium, and Rose Marie.  You have to be doing something right when you can get Rose Marie, of all people, to appear in your horror film.

From what I hear and read, the two Witchboard sequels aren't very good - but don't let that stop you from watching the original film.  Even the ending of Witchboard plays out quite effectively.  Writer and director Kevin S. Tenney really delivers the goods with this 1986 release, and I think Witchboard deserves a place somewhere on any viewing list of recommended 1980s horror movies.",1275696000,2,3443,4.8231292517006805

But at times she gets to become overwelmed by it's power that she accidently summons the spirit of a deceased serial killer as it hunts and murders her friends.

Exciting 80's mix of supernatural ghost story and slasher genre all rolled into one movie from writer-director Kevin S. Tenney (""Night of the Demons"") is a real hoot. It was a minor box-office hit in 1986 and launched the career of cult director Tenney as one of the most beloved directors of the genre as it offers some scares, gory violence and of course an interesting concept about the dangers of Oujia boards and it's addictive powers it can succumb at people including some hot nudity by hot girls.

The DVD has a beautiful transfer and some nice sound with fine extras like audio commentary, a featurette, TV Spot and Trailer.",1251676800,,1013,4.5911602209944755
2048227,3,B0001ZX0GU,I enjoyed the movie when it first came out in the 80's. I recently bought the DVD and realized its a good story- just bad acting. This is one film that needs a remake. Has the potential for a 5 star.,1249948800,2,199,3.8780487804878048
2048228,5,B0001ZX0GU,"At a party, a guest brings out a Ouija board, and they attempt to contact a spirit he knows. The spirit does appear, but it becomes apparent to the one who brought the Ouija board that this is an evil spirit that is impersonating his spirit, and despite warnings not to use the board alone, a woman uses it alone, and becomes harassed by the evil spirit, his goal to possess her so he can walk the earth again.

So, as a child I was exposed to many great horror movies of the 70's and 80's, and Witchboard was one of them. It always stuck out to me from all the other horror movies from that era. I couldn't really put my finger on it, but I always made a point of watching it when it was on TV. Now that I own Witchboard on DVD, I watch it all the time. If you're a fan of 80's horror movies, this is a must have movie.",1246233600,3,820,3.9397590361445785
2048229,4,B0001ZX0GU,"Story:

Linda (Tawny Kitaen) throws a little party at home with a few friends. A Ouija Board is brought out to help liven up the party. Linda begins contacting a spirit through the Ouija Board. The spirit wants to possess Linda and cross over into the land of the living. It's up to Linda's boyfriend (Todd Allen) and ex (Stephen Nichols) to stop the evil spirit from taking over Linda.

Review:

I just love movies about possession. This little gem was directed by Kevin S. Tenney who also directed Night of the Demons. I was really surprised with the acting in this film. Tawny Kitaen actually put on a very believable performance. There was a very serious tone throughout the entire film. That made it all the more interesting and fun to watch. We also get some pretty good humor mixed in with all the seriousness. Kathleen Wilhoite did a great job as the wacky psychic. Her humor and character were greatly appreciated. Witchboard delivered some pretty spooky scenes. I actually jumped quite a few times before it ended. I won't be buying a Ouija Board anytime soon. Too creepy.

Pros:

When Linda is having the dream sequence and the evil spirit shows up behind her with an axe. Kathleen Wilhoite's death sequence was also a highlight.  The film did a great job with the supernatural effects. It made me believe in ghosts.

Cons:

Some pacing problems. Nothing too bad.",1242000000,,1374,4.695833333333334

2048252,3,B0001ZX0GU,"IT'S FUNNY...to see people write (as if THEY KNOW) that there's nothing really supernatural about the Ouija board/or think that they're equally entitled to see such happenings. Two years ago, with some friends..we constructed a basic one, and a wine glass i pulled from my kitchen cupboard levitated up into the air and across the table. It's sad most of us Americans (unlike Brazil and Europe) are too culturally immature and ignorant to know that there is more to life than food/work/sex/and sleep. Have you ever been physically attacked by an invisible entity? Wrestling and wrestling as it tried to pin you back? While wide awake/lights on/sittin on the couch? Or have you seen a knome or a fairie come to see you? Or had an object flung at you in front of your friends?  All is energy. All is real. Energy can shove and push, and form the figures of your mind {for all to see}. We create. Life is wonderous. But we're doubters, and scared little egotists... cows chewing on the cud and sitting on the toilet laying our opinions. Feed a child. Hold someone you cowards. Before you're embalmed...What a (short but great)opportunity to be beautiful, like this green and blue planet, and its dimensions. You know what I don't believe in? I don't believe in you. Most are cattle. Who ridicule, like a childish ignoramus. You probably voted for George Bush's 2nd term. Jesus! are you dumb!(Better...you don't know. Stick to your life. Eat your mashed potatoes). Try to be kind. Most people, except the poor, are too fake, and insecure to deserve anything. No wonder it's a narrow path to heaven and a wide one to hell.

2048253,5,B0001ZX0GU,"I first saw this in the movie theatre circa 1987, and it has always been one of my favorite movies. Watching it again 20 years later, I can see that it hasn't lost any of its magic. The DVD contains a ""making of"" feature that's interesting, as well as commentary by the director/writer and producer.

The plot is pretty simple. The opening scene is a party, where someone suggests playing with a Ouija board. Not surprisingly, a spirit is contacted, and strange things began to happen. Tawny Kitaen, the main character, becomes ""addicted"" to the board and is soon possessed by an evil spirit. The ending is well-done and really cool. The acting from all of the characters is top-notch, and the effects are good. One of the best things about the movie is the actors make it work, making you care about the characters. Also, there are numerous ""jumps"" or ""scares"" that keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie.

Definitely a must-see for any horror fan, especially of supernatural-themed horror.",1203638400,32,1007,4.748571428571428

2048255,3,B0001ZX0GU,"Tawny Kitean is without a doubt one of the most gorgeous women ever to grace the big-screen.  It is unfortunate that her movie output has not been greater than what it has been.  She is a beautiful red-head and there are not TOO many actresses in Hollywood in that mold!

The present movie is about how things go wrong when you tamper with a Ouiji board.  Poor Tawny plays a character who becomes obsessed and possessed more & more by the board.  For what it is, it is an OK film.

IF it didn't have Tawny, this film would not be worth seeing.  She looks fantastic with her late-80s style ""big"" hair.  There is also a brief glimpse of her nude as she steps out of the shower.

Some of the best horror flicks to ever come out were between the late 60's and late 80's.

2048258,5,B0001ZX0GU,"This is and will always be one of my most favorite movies of all time!  My best friend John and I used to watch this movie when we were teenagers.  ""Mom Tina"", who was John's Mom, worked at a local video store in Sturtevant, WI when we were growing up.  Back then, mom and pop video stores were all the hype before the blockbusters and hollywood video stores came into being.  John and I use to use the ouija board in his Mom's basement, strange things occurred...the TV shut off by itself, the lights flickered... it was a little scary, but yet we thought it was cool.

Watching Tawney Kitaen, in the Heavy Metal, Whitesnake videos, and knowing Stephen Nichols who played ""Patch"" on Days of our lives in the 80's...made it cool... For a long time Witchboard was not available at all, it was out of print, and I'm so glad that it has finally been made available on DVD.  No matter how old or young you are, I highly recommend the movie!  Witchboard 2 isn't bad either, a good sequel... There is also a Witchboard part 3, which isn't the best, but not a bad film... The original, of course, is by far the best!

Also, no one can get over Kathleen Wilhoite, who plays the cool, and layed back, ""Zarabeth"" the medium who tries to exorcise the spirits from ""Jim and Linda's"" apt.  I could go on... but, I'll stop here... and say...

TTFN...

watch the movie and you'll know what I mean...

Don't play it alone!

haha ha... evil wicked laughter echoes in the distance...Malfeitor is waiting for you you to play!

2048259,4,B0001ZX0GU,"Any movie that features Whitesnake video vixen Tawny Kitaen is bound to raise a few eyebrows, but for this 80's horror romp, well, let's just say that acting isn't the most important thing here.  Kitaen plays a woman who comes into contact with the spirit of a deceased young boy via a Ouija board, and eventually, releases something much more sinister from the board that begins to assume posession over her.  Relying more on suspense and mystery than blood and gore (something that was a change of pace for horror films of the 80's), Witchboard is a surprisingly satisfying horror romp.  However, the look of the film is so unbelieveably dated (gotta love the mullet) that some may have a hard time getting into it, but other than that, Witchboard is still a fun flick.  The DVD is another fine package assembled by the good folks at Anchor Bay, who sure know how to package a horror film right.",1108425600,2,897,4.622641509433962
