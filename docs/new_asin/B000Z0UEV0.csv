3036807,5,B000Z0UEV0,"Everyone laughed at me when I told them I was purchasing these DVDs... Now everyone is doing the exercises with me, including my husband who is a bit of a ""REDNECK"" and made the most fun of the thought of me getting them and of course Richard Simmons...
But, no one is laughing now... My hole family has been doing these exercises for almost a month and we love them. You really do alot of sweating...  For the price and the convenience that you have to be able to do them at home on your own time this is a good deal. I have seen other offers but you only get 2 or 3 DVDs for the same price.",1202428800,76,592,3.9747899159663866
3036808,5,B000Z0UEV0,"As someone who did not growing up to this music, I can say that the DVDs really are a nice way to motivate me to get moving. They may be cheesy, but worth buying.",1202428800,5,162,3.7941176470588234
3036809,5,B000Z0UEV0,"I have to let you know, I have lost 12 lbs using these Sweatin' To The Oldies dvd's as well as other tapes by Richard Simmons. Richard makes it fun, motivational, and most of all effective to get in your workout every day. I feel energized and satisfied with the quality and level of aerobic exercise that these DVD's provide. They are for real people that really want to make a difference in their lives. If you are thinking of starting an exercise program and need a lot to lose, I must recommend these as a great place to start. It may take 2-3 times to get down the moves, but they are overall easy to follow Richards instructions, and after the first week, you will have mastered the basic workouts. Best wishes, and as Richard says, Never Give UP!!",1201651200,14,754,4.392857142857143
3036810,5,B000Z0UEV0,"so i realized i'm really overweight for my body frame and it's hard to move.

these videos make it fun to move, they really do! and i'm 26 and not ashamed to say i LOVE these!!! i heard they were coming out on dvd and mom got them for me to help me get up and move...

i just got them today so of course haven't seen results yet, but i wanted to remark about the lightening fast shipping; it was martin luther king weekend the saturday that we ordered them and we got them the tuesday after the saturday we ordered them!! how insanly fast is that? and i got the product i ordered, and i'm getting ready to pop one in and work out. these are so much fun! definitly try them if you want to make working out fun. sure, richard simmons can be really cheesy but you feel so good when you're doing them! i would grab this tape way back when, when i was tired of the Firm or Jane Fonda or whatever workout of the month mom had for me.

i'm thrilled to have these again, i'm so glad amazon had them; they were sold out in all the stores!!",1200960000,21,1030,3.9902912621359223
3036811,5,B000Z0UEV0,"Richard Simmons' charming personality and know-how make Sweatin' to the Oldies a classic of the 80s rage for exercise videos. The music is great, and will appeal to people of every age, and I've enjoyed just listinging to it for inspiration while working around the house.

As an added plus, Sweatin' to the Oldies rates mega-stars as a fabulous family activity that not only entertains, but gets us off the couch for some very real health benefits. Don't be fooled by the simplicity of the routines. There's some serious exercise here.

The Complete Collection of Sweatin' to the Oldies is a tremendous value!",1198800000,188,610,4.912621359223301

Richard Simmons incorporates very basic exercises with fun oldies music.  Each video is about 40-45 minutes long.  The exercises get a little more challenging than the last.  I really appreciated that not all of the people in the videos were stick thin models or trainers.  He did have trainers, but he also had real people - overweight people - doing the exercises.  And at the end of each DVD it showed each of the participants and how much weight loss they had achieved so far.  All in all it is a fun collection of exercises.",1456012800,,673,4.512396694214876

3036875,5,B000Z0UEV0,"As a fan of oldies music, these workouts were right up my alley! Richard Simmons is energetic and encouraging. I actually feel good about myself DURING the workout as well as after the workout. A few things to note, however, while these DVDs are fun and motivating, you will not achieve the same results you would with other workouts. I have several Jillian michaels workouts and while I HATE doing them, I get better results with her DVDs. I usually do my Richard Simmons DVDs with weights (you have to get creative if you do this because the workouts are actually dances) to offset some of the negatives of doing his FUN DVDs vs. the more result-driven, make-you-hate-life DVDs Jillian michaels produces. I really do love these DVDs and am more likely to do these on days when I would otherwise do nothing. These are fun workouts and you can lose weight with them...just don't expect anything too drastic. These are low-impact workouts and seem to be designed for people who are extremely overweight. I am not extremely overweight which could account for my moderate results.",1440374400,,1077,4.795698924731183

3036904,5,B000Z0UEV0,This is a fun way to work out if you are starting out and a bit overweight. Exercises are not too strenuous. Classic oldies make the work out enjoyable. You are basically just dancing and singing along to your favorite oldies without realizing you are working out. There are people on the video who have been doing Sweatin' to the Oldies for years and others who are just starting out. So you don't feel like you are alone and struggling to work out by yourself.,1430870400,,462,4.447058823529412
3036905,5,B000Z0UEV0,"I used the original 'Sweatin to the Oldies' VHS tapes for years.  Having put on some
weight again, first thing I thought of was 'Richard Simmon's Sweatin' to the Oldies'.
I'd been in an accident, had 3 spinal surgeries in one yr. and when I was finally
recovered.. I had over 70 lbs. to lose!  I did it with these exercise tapes, walking
and modifying my diet a little.
If you've never seen these exercise videos before, they are fun.  The music
itself will get you moving and rachet up your spirits.  I know listening to these
old rock'n'roll tunes always make me feel better no matter where I am or what
I'm doing.  They're great to exercise with.  These are low impact aerobic exercise
videos.  This set is wonderful. You start with the first one and as you improve
you move on the the second one and so on.  I had all his tapes and once I got
into good enough shape,  I played a different one each day for variety.
One of the good things about RS's videos is you're not watching thin, sweet young
things in beautiful exercise outfits.  You're watching people of all ages, shapes
and sizes in everything from leotards and crop tops to sweats and tees.
If you can't keep up... no problem, do what you can and walk in place for a minute or
two and then try again.  If your heart gets to beating too hard, leave some arm movements
out and just move your feet. Little by little you'll be able to do more and more and have
fun doing it.",1429920000,4,1434,4.274074074074074

3036943,5,B000Z0UEV0,"When I found out about these dance-to-the-music tapes several years ago, I began purchasing one tape at a time, until I collected every tape Richard Simmons made. Whether or not you enjoy the oldies-but-goodies, which most people do, it happened to be the music I love the most as a Baby-Boomer, which inspired me to lose weight and keep in shape while having fun.

When I First followed the tapes, I was determined to lose weight and get in shape. After using one tape for 3 months at 3 times a week, I lost 32 pounds. I went from a size 10 to a size 5, just in time for my 20 year high school reunion. My old buddies asked what I did to lose the weight and we talked about these music tapes.

Richard Simmons includes warm-ups, cool-downs, inspiring stories of those who lost weight, and more. The music not only inspires, but motivates you to set a goal, and the program directs you to a healthy life-style.

To this day, I still use these tapes, but at a slower pace as I head for age 65. These videos are not only worth every penny as they encourage you to stay in shape, but you can save a small fortune by simply using these videos instead of spending a great deal of money on gym essentials or memberships. Motivating, Fun, Inspiring. Highly recommended!",1416268800,2,1262,4.384615384615385

I like the first better - seems he tinkered with the timing of the warm-up/workout/cool down that it lost something in the second session.  Better than Disco Sweat from that perspective...

3036983,5,B000Z0UEV0,"One thing I will say about Richard is he does do a fun workout that is easy enough for anyone to follow and really seems to care for the people he is helping.  His workout gives you a fantastic exercise program without killing you or setting you in the hospital with joint or back injury.  If you are just starting out or in good shape and workout regularly this is a fun and serious workout.
I had this in the early 90's on VHS and kept looking out for it on DVD.  I thought it would never be re-released, but they finally did release it!  I was very happy about that.  The best part is it is the complete collection.  I love the fact that it is all inclusive and friendly to people of all sizes.  My teen daughter even likes the workout and says it's a lot of fun.  I think even elderly could follow along with small modifications.
I have had all types of workout programs including Wii fit and the dance games for PS2 and 3.  I have also tried many other workout, dance, and aerobic dvd's, but this one, ""sweatin to the oldies 1""  will always be my favorite.",1403136000,4,1061,4.182266009852217

In spite of that, this is a great workout--it just makes you feel really good.  The time goes by so quickly.  With some workouts I find myself constantly checking the time--not so with this one.  30 minutes just sped by.  Most of all, it is just plain FUN, FUN, FUN!!",1401494400,2,436,4.443037974683544

Did it for a week when the tape broke and I went searching for a DVD.  Found this box set for far less than a gym membership and just love it.  Since I am a senior citizen, I love the music and low impact aerobics.  Dancing is much more fun than a treadmill.  It moves every part of your body, unlike my usual exercise routine, and you do sweat.  Start with 1 as they do get increasingly harder.  I even have friends coming over for a group session.  If you are looking for a fun, low impact aerobic workout done in the convenience of your own home, look no further.",1398643200,,738,4.104895104895105

It makes the time pass by quickly.  All of these videos work for people of all fitness levels -- beginners can do smaller movements and even do parts of the disk, more advanced people can add their own movement and make the movements bigger while still keeping exercise fun!

I also highly recommend Richard's Sweatin' to the Oldies 4 and 5.  I really wish Richard would release several more Sweatin' to the Oldies DVDs.  I can't get enough of these when it comes workout time.",1396569600,,651,4.707964601769912

The dance class are regular people you can identify and have fun with.  The moves are doable and have enough variety so you don't get bored.

It may not take the pounds off at a fast pace, however, it is fun and entertaining while trying to do so. The songs are relatable to the workouts and when I am always done I have a smile on my face because I feel good about myself and what I just accomplished.

The quality is great and while I haven't used #3-#5 of the DVDs, I'm sure they are just as good.  This is a great starter exercise program, especially if you haven't exercised in a while.  The songs are fun and the moves very easy.  The people working with Richard are all different sizes (i.e., not perfect size 6's) so you can workout without being intimidated by skinny people (smile).  Richard Simmons may come across as hokey but you can't fault that this form of exercise is enjoyable!

I ordered this DVD because I only do workouts DVDs that are realistic. Ones where you don't pull a muscle or scream when they say it was only the warmup you have been doing because you can not go anymore. So far the only ones I have found that are like that and encouraging and don't only feature models or celebrities are Richard, Leslie Sansone and Jane Fonda.

20.00 was an EXTREMELY good price for this box set! I bought it under used and it came in as brand new, wrapped up and appeared to have never been open before. Only thing i did not like is that it took way to long to ship.

Just get the songs rolling and exercise.  Also, I thought there would be the original artists singing and playing.  He has his own band in the back.

The songs are a mix of fast, giving you a good workout, while others are slow and you can't do much with them. Music quality is good and packaging was well done. The 5th CD is all talk; I haven't played it so can't comment on it.

I just play the fast songs, repeating if necessary and skip the slow ones.  If you want a mixed program, this will work well for you just as it's laid out. I can't follow all the moves, so I dance along in my own way.

It shipped very quickly--I was impressed by the speedy delivery.",1390003200,,647,4.0

When I recieved my much awaited package from my mail man, he looked as though he too could use a good work out. So I did what any other noble space cadet in my proffesion would do. I covertly invited him into my humble African bungalo for some snacks, knowing that just like any other wild beast he would accept my offer of food. As we awaited for my freshly slain ostrach to finish cooking I covertly slipped in my new found treasure of a work out tape and began the vigorous excercises. I only do higher level workouts (not that im bragging) but in my time away from being a space cadet i try to behave like any other homosapien and slay wild beasts for tourist out on the wild and dangerous African plain, and that requires me to look fierce. Like Lady Gaga fierce. Usually I go for the standard workout of wrestling the casual lion, but something seemed to call me towards this particular tape. When seeing that I recieved free shipping as an Amazon Prime member I just couldn't resist this deal. It was like offering cake to a fat kind only I was going to indulge in recieving a God like body. During my work out my mail man whose name I learned was the Pinksta informed me that we was going to be initiated into a new gang of mail man meth dealers and needed to loose his extra junk in his trunk. My plan had worked an soon we were doing the workouts together! As we were shaking our booties to the oldies I had a revelation. I was going to marry this man. So inturned around and with Richard Simmmons as my witness I proposed. Seeing as how I had saved his life from obesity and jelly donuts he whole heartedly agreed.  Two hours we were married by an African meth dealer and boy was it beautiful as I walked down the isle with Richard Simmons The Complete  Collection playing soothingly in the background on a state of the art VCR. It was all id ever dreamed of an more seeing that I now had something to believe in. That something was Richard Simmoms. Some would say he was sent by jesus to show us the path to salvation, but I know in my heart Richard Simmons is Jesus. I am now pregnant with my 2nd set of sextuplets and this video has made my life so much more. My family will forever be bonded by the path Richard Simmons has set forth.

I recommend watching the first song over and over until you get the basic dance moves, then move onto the next (it will help you confidence and energy level).
Richard is amazing, and I like that these songs are just good clean fun. No hip hop swear or sexual so when my little boys are around they just want to dance with me.
You still of course have to have the will power to put the tape in and turn the tv on, but once your there, you won't want to stop. Right now I can only do 3 songs, but I'm hoping in the next month I'll be up to 4.",1384560000,,936,3.905759162303665

I have 2 left feet so at first I was just flopping around (but still off the sofa), but the more I did the workouts the better it got and I can now pretty much go right along with everything. The best part is it actually works! I started about 2 months ago (3 times a week) and I have lost an amazing 18 pounds. I feel fantastic and I work out better each time! I love the fact that there are real people working out in the video's and not people that are thin and in shape.

You never feel embarressed that you can't keep up, he is encouraging all the way.  This is truly the way to go if you have been just diagnosed with a health concern that would improve with exercise.

(Whitney Houston,""The Greatest Love of All"")

His ""kookie"" personality puts a smile on your face.  This DVD set is like a fitness ministry.  If you like dancing to the oldies, then you would love Richard Simmon's ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"".  The songs are up-lifting and energizing.  I love it.",1377216000,2,630,5.019230769230769

I recently tried Zumba for the first time (the wii game version of Zumba 2).  Zumba definitely made me sweat, but I really, truly did not like the music (call me crazy).  Also, I found myself a bit put off by the animated instructors (one of them was the spitting image of Kristen Stewart, which was kind of freaky).  Anyway....even if I could follow all of the steps, I just couldn't tolerate the music, so I sold my Zumba....after one week.....and ordered this collection.  I have never, ever had a Richard Simmons workout tape of any kind before, and I wish I had tried it years...decades...ago.  I love most of the music, even though a lot of it is before my time.  I love the ""live people,"" even though you can't win points or unlock bonuses.  Richard Simmons is funny and fun, and his steps are easy to follow.  Honestly, after four days (one day per dvd in this set), in comparing to Zumba, I probably don't sweat QUITE as much, but I got WAY more tired.....because these workouts use your whole body..a lot of arm work, for example, NOT just shaking your hips and moving your feet.  I LOVE these dvds.  And I am sure that, once I actually get off the couch and DO them instead of just WATCHING them, my workout will be even BETTER.  (KIDDING)  Today I ordered Sweatin 5 in a set with a toning workout, and one other of Richard's workouts.....so I will have a variety to choose from every day.",1377043200,2,1535,4.355633802816901

Although it took almost a week to get all the routines down on the 1st DVD that Richard uses but if your persistant and just do what you can it will make more sense each time you do it. t\This complete collection allows you to not get stagnant, can switch up. I use different disk each week. would recomment this. I started out the end of August 2013 @194 pounds and now, Christmas 2013, I'm down to 172. The exercise really does work. Richard Simmons style is made for the regular person regardless of age or sex.  FYI...I'v had 2 back surgiers and one knee replacement and can still do the routines that Richard Simmons has!",1376956800,,770,4.238095238095238

3037120,4,B000Z0UEV0,"My fiance has been laughing his butt off at me for working out to these tapes. Don't get me wrong, the bad hair and 80s fashion is completely silly but these workouts really get you sweating. They're accessible and yet they still work your entire body. I love the music (though admittedly I've always been partial to Motown and such.) If you're looking for something extreme or hardcore then this probably isn't for you. Personally, I find most forms of exercise monotonous and I've never liked the atmosphere of gyms. These dvds offer a good variety and I can do the routines at home which is a big plus for me. I've already lost 10lbs and I feel a difference in my energy levels and flexibility. Definitely a good purchase.",1375833600,2,725,4.584615384615384
3037121,5,B000Z0UEV0,"Had these on VHS...Fun, Fun, Fun! Close the curtains if you don't want the neighbors to see you act silly. These videos are fun, your face will get a workout, too, from smiling so much. Get ready to feel like a goofy little kid again. Best of all you'll sweat. These exercises are pretty much low impact, so anyone can do them, but they get your heart rate up. The music is the best! Also at the end of the workout the exercisers dance on out and they show how much weight they have lost, very inspiring. These are my favorite aerobics DVDs. They are great when you get home from work and really don't want to work out. When I do these I feel like that little kid that used to watch Dick Clark and dance with my little sister...when you're a kid you don't realize you're exercising, you're just playing and having fun...that's what Richard Simmons did in Sweatin' to the Oldies.",1375747200,,878,4.359756097560975

3037125,4,B000Z0UEV0,"I've been out of shape for a good two years and needed to start off slow.  I watched the tapes first before I did the routines.  I like how the routine is geared to your level of fitness.  Meaning I can incorporate either high or low impact.  The music is great.  Richard and the music are great motivators.  I do not like organized fitness programs.  I'm basically lazy when it comes to exercise but I found that I look forward to working out each day.  There are 4 tapes to choose from so it's not boring.  I've been working out for two weeks and lost 11 pds.  I worked out with ""Sweating to the Oldies"" and ""Toning to the Oldies"".  The price for this product was excellent.  I've already saved tons of money that I'd be paying a gym.  I like the fact that I can do a great work out in my own home. This is a very good product.",1375488000,2,829,4.074534161490683
3037126,4,B000Z0UEV0,"After reading many reviews here I decided to purchase Sweatin' to the Oldies complete set so thought I'd weigh in.  Richard Simmons has always seemed very obnoxious to me and I must say that I got this DVR thinking (can't recall where I read this) that I could ""turn off"" his voice and still have the music and visual.  Doesn't seem to be a way to do that.  However, I'm not as bothered as I thought I'd be.  Some people complained that it was hard to follow his moves.  This is true so if it bothers you not to get it just right this is not for you.  Truth is that what's important here is to keep moving and have fun, not to follow the moves exactly.  This is good exercise for people who enjoy dancing, like the oldies and want to be able to work out at home.  I should probably say that I'm 62 years old and have found it hard in recent years to stick with any exercise routine until someone recommended Leslie Sansone's ""Walk Away the Pounds"".  After several months of doing that I wanted variety so got the Richard Simmons which is a bit more taxing (I sweat more and get my heart rate up higher).  I got the full set, to keep it interesting for many months to come.",1375488000,2,1172,4.168888888888889

3037133,5,B000Z0UEV0,Loved these videos years ago and they still live up to expectations. A good workout for those of limited to average endurance.  Richard is a good companion and cheerleader and has a good  heart.  Enjoyed finding these videos again on DVD.,1373760000,,238,4.7560975609756095
3037134,5,B000Z0UEV0,"Years ago I used to do aerobic dance and loved it. Fast forward, I am now disabled but ambulatory. On a whim, I bought this and it is so good that even I can exercise to it.  You can go at your own pace, there is nothing difficult about it. If you can walk you can do this - it is that  simple. Honestly, if I can do this, there is no reason that you can't!
It truly is  the best workout, after 10 minutes, you are in a sweat, but you won't care because  the music is fabulous and Richard is charming, encouraging, warm and  genuine. The bonus features are terrific:, sometimes poignant  and sad, but always hopeful!",1373587200,2,616,4.1344537815126055
3037135,4,B000Z0UEV0,"The first and the second discs are the best.  One is really nice and simple.  Two is harder and, brace yourself, has ""floorwork"" (a euphemism for ""sit-ups"").  But, I like both of them.

Three and four (to me a non-dancer), are a bit too elaborate in the choreography.  Some people would probably like this.  I enjoy familiar repetition in exercise.  Just the physical effort is enough.

Which brings me to the main point.  These videos kick your butt.  Especially if you are out of shape.  You can laugh at Richard Simmons if you think he is goofy.  But you will get in shape if you use the videos.

I would be interested in more of his DVD's, as long as the dance routines aren't overly complicated.",1373414400,,700,4.4603174603174605

But now I'm in my early forties and I needed to lose 15 pounds and I was looking for something fun that I could do in the house.  In my younger days I had many different aerobic VHS tapes and to be perfectly honest...Richard Simmons offers the same work-out with great music and a lot of energy.  He is not irritating at all.  He is full of joy and it comes through and keeps me going.  My heart rate goes up and I sweat.  My favorite work-out is Sweating to the Oldies 2 as it has the aerobics plus arm work with weights and ab work.  It's fun and it's effective and I'm down 9 pounds already.  If you want a fun aerobic work out and you love to listen to the oldies I highly recommend this.,1372723200,,785,3.949044585987261

Some of the dance moves are somewhat Broadway-type steps/routine; but, there are other types of movements as well.

I used to exercise to someone else's DVD, and she just had some towels and a few plants in the background.  Richard is into the big show.  In Sweatin' 4, my favorite one, he has a big stage, a gospel choir, fancy schmancy lighting and scenery with musical notes and lights, and a band.  He pairs the exercise with music and other stuff that people really like. He is a real behavior modification genius the way he has gotten so many people to buy his DVDs and exercise. I really like the people in his DVDs as well.  They are all ages, shapes, and sizes- and they are great enthusiastic and talented dancers. You get all of the Sweatin DVDs in this package, so if you get bored with one, you can use another one.  The music is really good!!",1359504000,4,892,4.273809523809524

3037256,4,B000Z0UEV0,I love love love these DVDs. I only chose to not give it 5 stars because after each song Richard and everyone doing the workout stop to applaud the band. I don't stop and just keep on marching but it still irritates me I have to just march and wait. If you stop you lower your heart rate down too low. He has rectified this in other DVDs like Party Off the Pounds where there is no break and the songs slide seamlessly from one to the next. Apart from this one little issue the DVDs are fun and can be quite challenging if you put the effort in. If you follow along and make your moves nice and big you will feel the burn. The moves are not difficult so I find it very easy to keep up. Highly recommend this DVD set.,1358208000,2,716,3.9791666666666665

3037268,5,B000Z0UEV0,"It's January, which means it's time to start being serious again about daily exercise and shedding some pounds. There's no more fun way to do that than to sweat with Richard Simmons and his band of ordinary, just-like-me people. These are the workouts that I would actually stick to, over time, more than 20 years ago, and they're the ones I'll do today, now that they are finally available on DVD. I love the music, I love to feel like I'm just dancing rather than working out, I love that I'm not paying $$$$ at some gym, and I love that I can do this low-impact exercise without hurting something. To be fair about it, this is not a complete program for getting in good shape - I still have to do strength training on alternate days, because these 4 discs only give me the cardio workouts I need. Even so, I'm delighted to have these fun exercise routines back in my life. Even though they were recorded nearly 25 years ago, they seem timeless. Highly recommended.",1357171200,2,967,4.468926553672317

Normally I do water aerobics three times a week and it's a pretty strenuous program so I just wanted something that would get me moving for 30-45 minutes on the off days.  This works perfectly.  It's enough to get my heart rate to a decent level, the choreography is simple and the music is just fun.

3037282,5,B000Z0UEV0,"I bought this box set and I am so glad I did. I love Richard's videos because they are fun and you don't feel like you're exercising. You don't even want them to end. Richard's first four ""Sweatin'"" videos are the best of his work and they are the videos I most turn to when I want to get moving. They are great for people who love oldies music like I do and each video is an oldies theme with live music. They are really cute. The four videos get progressively harder so it's worth it to start with number one first, but I find I actually like the later videos better because they become more like dancing and less like exercising. Because Richard doesn't really teach the steps or do much verbal coaching (he does occasionally announce when the step changes, but more often not), it takes a few times of watching before you learn all the moves. But the moves are all really easy so you don't need to worry if you don't know how to dance. Also, the best thing is to just get started and not worry if you can't get your hands and feet to do everything exactly as is on the first few times. You'll see on the video that even the people in the video make mistakes. The important thing is to just get started and eventually you'll get it. Once you do, you'll realize how fun and easy it really is.

I also like all the extras that come with this set. The interviews are really inspiring and great motivators. I will admit that most people will not look like models just from these videos alone, but they will probably help overweight people lose a few pounds and they are definitely good for staying fit and active. If you are looking for maximum benefit for your exercise routine, you should try something harder. These are really just for fun and for people who would otherwise not exercise at all. Well worth it, though!",1352851200,2,1820,4.3372434017595305
3037283,4,B000Z0UEV0,Getting all five DVDs at this price was worth it.  I can switch around with which one I use so I don't get bored just doing one.,1352592000,,128,3.740740740740741

3037286,5,B000Z0UEV0,"The bottom line about the Sweatin' To The Oldies videos is, if you use them regularly (I do them about 5 times a week, sometimes every day of the week), and make any necessary healthy changes to your diet you need to make, you WILL lose weight with these.  Also, I personally don't believe you'll find another ""weight loss guru"" who cares as much as Richard does about you getting fit.  It's what he's dedicated his life to.

So - if you want something that really works, presented in a fun and easy to follow format with fun moves, this will be worth your money and then some.  I'm living proof - 11 pounds & 7 3/4"" lost already and I just bought these in late September or early October 2012.

The moves are easy to catch on to - you can always watch the videos a couple of times & you should be able to follow fairly easily.  The music is not done by the original artists, but this is necesary to get a better workout.  After all, you're going to sweat more through a 7 minute version of Jailhouse Rock versus the original 3!  The music still sounds great - you honestly will be panting & sweating too much to care.  And that's the whole point.",1351468800,5,1147,4.224770642201835
3037287,5,B000Z0UEV0,This is a great value all four DVD's plus a bonus DVD that is very inspirational and motivational. I like the live bands and the music is timeless. One thing that I do not like is that the camera men zoom in on particular women in the videos usually the thin aerobic instructor look alikes. I think that the camera should focus on Richard and the rest of the people are basically in the back ground. I noticed that the  videos  become more difficult and more fun actually as the numbers increase. I like the little motivations Richard throws in  like you are doing great and thank you for dancing with me etc. It is fun to watch the end when the people come out and proudly dance and show you how many pounds they have lost. It is fun to watch people who are struggling to lose weight  getting out there and taking care of their health and trying so hard to help others. I like these videos because you can dance in the privacy of your own home and not have to feel like you should hide in the back of the room like you do in a public aerobics class. You can work at your own pace. Richard Simmns is fun and motivational.,1351296000,,1121,4.175925925925926

It was so much fun I didn't feel like I was working out at all (but I did work up a sweat)  I loved it that it worked you up into your workout, didn't throw you in.  I felt like it was a nice workout, not one that you feel passing out after 15 minutes.  Another thing I absolutely loved is that people seemed to be doing all different variations of the workout.  At times when I screwed up the moves, it didn't matter, and I didn't feel like I screwed up!  No mechanical dancing in this video I LOOOOOOVVVVEEE it!

I went onto Richard's Facebook page and messaged him about my purchase. Within a few hours this wonderful man emailed me back with a really encouraging personal message. I will think about that kindness and smile very time I play one of these workouts. A truly dedicated man who I now know actually cares about me!

3037307,5,B000Z0UEV0,"Look past the fuzzy hair, pink, rhinestone tanktops and the reminders of ""hug yourselves ladies!!"" and you'll find a man who is completely passionate about health and fitness. There is nobody else in the exercise video market that fits into Richard's category. Not only does he love what he's doing, but he wants everyone else to love it to. In his Sweatin' to the Oldies series, you get to experience his awesome band playing the songs you know the words to, not the typical music you hear on exercise videos. When I pop in any of the DVDs from this set, I start singing and dancing, whooping and hollering right along with him for the band. I can't help it. I'm not old, but I grew up on this music and I appreciate it a lot more than the junky pop music of today. I'd rather exercise to The Beach Boys than Lady Gaga any day. It's a really fun workout with great music and I catch myself freestyling because I get into it. It is low intensity, so it makes for a good workout for overweight and fit alike. I'm used to pretty intense stuff, but when I don't feel like working out and I want to do something fun, I pull out my Sweatin box set and push play. Richard is an inspiring, wonderful man who has been on the fitness scene for decades. He came from obesity. He understands where real people have come from. He has real people in his programs. Young, old, thin, heavy...I respect him so much.

Plus, at the end of the workouts, all the people from the video line up and it shows all their names and how much weight they lost. I hope this review helped. :)",1346284800,,1562,4.277027027027027
3037328,5,B000Z0UEV0,This is a terrific workout - especially if you are just starting out.  It doesn't matter how big you are or how old you are or how out of shape you are.  You can do this one!,1344556800,,174,3.675675675675676

I own, and enjoy Kathy Smith's yoga, but do not feel that it provides enough of a cardio workout. I borrowed a Denise Austin DVD, and that woman makes me feel like a pathetic loser. So, I decided to give Sweatin' to the Oldies a try. I love it! When most people on the video are stepping, I am able to ""run,"" making me feel like, ""Hey! I'm a Rockstar!"" When I tire, I can slow down, but still keep up with the exercises. I would definitely recommend this DVD series to anyone just beginning, but also to those who feel like an uncoordinated sack when trying to workout alongside many other fitness gurus.",1344124800,2,897,4.251461988304094

Some people will find the steps too tame, but they were easy to follow, nonstop and before you knew it, you had been sweating for an hour. I would have preferred a little more variety - sometimes, a new step just meant turning to on side and doing the same thing over and over - but, again, you got a steady cardiovascular workout and looked forward to doing it again, perhaps improvising a bit to the music. Not for heavy-duty athletes, but would definitely recommend it to the average person who finds it hard to get motivated to exercise.",1336176000,,644,4.560344827586207

Richard Simmons uses real people in the video and not all muscle-fit people that say, yes, you too can look like this in 2 months. The moves he does, most people can do, and if need be, you can modify it for yourself. The main thing is to have fun, enjoy the music and get moving! I wish I had bought this set along time ago.

3037363,5,B000Z0UEV0,I almost forgot how much I love Richard Simmons.  I used to watch Richard when he was on General Hospital.  He kept me fit in the 80's.  This is the best purchase I've made in a long time.  Thank you Richard!,1326758400,,208,4.0
3037364,5,B000Z0UEV0,"The best aerobic video EVER!  I used this video on tape years ago and was thrilled to see it on DVD (now that my tape player is gone).  I've aged along with that tape, and being older, I knew that this video could help because it doesn't put a lot of pressure on the joints (like bad knees).  It also gives you a great workout -- and it's FUN!  I hate exercising, and ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" makes it enjoyable and I know I'm still getting exercise.  Richard Simmons has heart and soul, and it comes through with every move he takes.  The music is great, live band, ""real"" people (not models), exercises that work you out, but are fun to do!  It's a classic!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1326672000,,681,4.307086614173229

3037374,5,B000Z0UEV0,"Had these in VHS format, but much easier to take along in DVD's.  They were already favorites of mine and I'm glad to be able to use them again.  They are a little silly, but they make me work, and make me want to.",1316995200,,214,3.840909090909091
3037375,2,B000Z0UEV0,"I purchased these DVD's a while ago and unfortunately I wish I could get my money back. It had been a long time since I had worked out so I thought this would be the perfect way to help me build up my endurance before going on to more Advanced DVD's.  Its actually low impact enough so you don't feel like your gonna pass out but its not so low that you feel like you didn't do anything. For this I will at least give it a two. The main reason I don't like it is I find Richard way too spastic.  I like DVD's where the routines are repetitive like two or three sets of the same move.  With Richard he does a move a couple times then on to the next, this makes it super hard to keep up. I just start doing something he's doing and then he's already doing something else.  I am sorry but thats too much, I don't like feeling confused when I work out, I want to be able to keep up. Its almost like you have to do the video enough times that you memorize it so you can keep up. Plus I am not crazy about 50's music, I can do 70's or 80's but 50's no. That being said the music didn't help motivate me to wanna move and get into it (and I need as much motivation as I can get).  This set is collecting dust right now,  I plan to put it on ebay or craigslist to get rid of it,  I would not recommend it but hey to each his own.",1314230400,2,1321,3.7992700729927007
3037376,2,B000Z0UEV0,"The ""exercise part"" was great, but I REALLY do not like all the talking Richard does at the beginning and end of each dvd.  He talks too much and it takes too long to fast forward each time to get to the exercise.  I would not recommend it for this reason.

However, I was a little disappointed to find that Sweatin' to the Oldies 5 was not included in this ""Complete"" collection.  The fifth dvd is a motivational message from Richard instead of the expected Oldies 5.  Now I will have to purchase Oldies 5 separately.  I'm sure it will be as much fun as the other Oldies.  I love Richard and his acceptance of all people.  His love of life and the people in it are so evident in his caring relationship with the participants.",1313107200,,547,4.42
3037378,5,B000Z0UEV0,"I've tried several other workout videos and found them hard to follow, but these are so much fun and pretty easy to follow. It takes a couple of times to really get it, but it's OK if you don't get the steps exactly. The main thing is that you're moving. The music is so upbeat that you actually WANT to exercise. Each DVD is a bit harder than the one before. I really appreciate that he uses all shapes and sizes of people. Richard Simmons is very encouraging and the extras show that he really does care about what he does. I highly recommend this product.",1312675200,2,558,4.273584905660377

3037383,5,B000Z0UEV0,This is a great set of DVDS and a very good workout when it is too hot to walk outside or just anytime.  I love the music and Richard Simmons is really cute.  You can tell that he wants to give a very good exercise session.  I am very happy with it and I love the music.  It totally works for me!,1309132800,,296,3.725806451612903

3037385,5,B000Z0UEV0,I enjoyed the video.  I have only gotten through the first CD and only because that's as far as I can get physically.  It gives you a real workout.  I think I will gradually get to more tapes once I get used to the workout steps.  I love the music and its a lot of fun.,1306454400,,269,3.75
3037386,5,B000Z0UEV0,"Richard Simmons has the spirit to get anyone motivated. I love his attitude. These workouts get me moving because they are fun, and I do work up a sweat.

3037388,5,B000Z0UEV0,I Love my collection of Sweatin to the Oldies! And when he says sweat yes you do & it's easy & fun! I switch the video's around because he works on all different routines.#2 he even tricked you & through in some floor exercises & used weights. He used pop bottles I used real weights but they really wore me out! I hope Richard keeps making these video's he really inspires me to workout with him. Thank You!! I'm 60 years old & it doesn't matter how old you are you just do what you can & it does get easier if you think any of them are hard. Each workout is 1 hour long & that's perfect. When you are working out you think to yourself this isn't going to do anything but you eat your words by the time your done because you feel good that you did it & your sweatin. I have a glass of water by me if I need too I take a drink! So if you want a good workout buy this collection because it's a fun way to exercise & have fun doing it!!!,1304899200,,935,3.875

You have to see the introduction, which is a do-not make copies video of him and his mother... the same in every dvd, annoying and boring...  and dvd does not allow fast forward.  He changes his movements constantly...  Did not like at all.",1301270400,5,339,4.403225806451613

The people who exercise with Richard are folks who are intent on changing their lives, are in all shapes and sizes and do not have plastic, perfect bodies...you know the type you see in most exercise videos.
I have taken Jazzercise classes over the years and Richard Simmons videos are on a even par and in some cases tougher than those classes.
Well worth the money!",1300492800,,476,4.678571428571429

3037400,5,B000Z0UEV0,"I bought Sweatin' to the Oldies on VHS when it first came out years ago and was thrilled to find it on DVD. It's fun, easy to follow, and I love that the people doing the workout with Richard Simmons are real people, at various stages of weight loss, instead of model-thin buff-bodied men and women you find on most videos. Sweatin' to the Oldies is especially great for people who are just starting out on an exercise program. Now that I've been working out for a while, I've added walking to my fitness program, but I still use STTO three times a week because it works muscles I don't use as much during my power walks. Also, it breaks up the monotony of walking with something that is FUN. The music is a perfect tempo, and Richard is a hoot. If you've been planning to start exercising but are intimidated by all those gorgeous bodies on those too-fast, too-complicated workout videos and are bored by walking, try Sweatin' to the Oldies. I did and I've lost 11 pounds so far and I feel so much better.",1298505600,,1006,4.385026737967914
3037401,4,B000Z0UEV0,I purchased this collection in order to change up my workout routine.  I like how Richard Simmons paces his workouts with warmup and cool down routines.  I would have given it 5 stars but there are times that you can't hear him speak so you have to keep your face to the tv screen constantly.  But I have noticed that he gets better at direction from DVD to DVD.  I would recommend his workouts to everyone!,1297987200,,407,4.315789473684211

3037403,1,B000Z0UEV0,"Looking for a way to exercise indoors during the winter months I purchased Sweatin to the Oldies.
It was a multiple disc set.  The 1st disc was just Richard talking and interviews.  The 2nd was more
Richard talking and interviews.  By the time we got to a workout I was already not happy.  I paid to sweat not listen to testimonials.
Richard assumes you know the meaning of the steps he yells out.  I didn't.  He's got a large group of folks sweatin with him.
The camera pans them so often and badly I might add that you can't follow the routine.  Not all of them are doing the
same thing and when the camera does go to Richard it's his face/body and nothing of his feet.
Very, very poorly instructed and filmed. Don't waste your time or money.  I sent mine back.  Amazon gladly refunded my money.
I found a great way to exercise at home with Leslie Sansone.  You get a great cardio/aerobic workout and you can find her online at Exercise TV.  Not only do you get a great work out, she's free.",1297296000,16,993,4.28494623655914

This workout was always perfect for me, low impact on my knee's is a huge consideration. They are just as I remember, fun with a great warm up and cool down. Richard get's my heart pumping. I can increase or decrease the intensity by small adjustments and get a quality workout. The hardest part is my 12 year old daughter laughs at me while I work out, but she's starting to join me so we will both benifit.",1297209600,4,576,4.198198198198198

However the others are new versions and a lot of floor work which I don't particularly like to mess with.  I much enjoyed the original ""Sweatin""  series.  A little disappointed with this.  Lots of chit-chat at the front.  I do enjoy the end where they show how much weight each of the ""dancers"" have lost.

The songs are fun, and he doesn't make it difficult to get going. You don't have to dress a particular way, just wear good sneakers. I am having a blast doing the dances and singing along.

I work my legs and step along with the DVD -while sitting - as much as I can. It makes me feel GREAT! And I've lost weight & inches.
We all need to exercise and it can be really hard when you're handicapped. Richard's DVD makes it fun and easy with just a little adaptation. Thanks Richard.

I got the complete collection which is great for keeping it fresh do one a day Monday through Thursday and then go back to my walking video on Friday.

I've been telling friends that Richard Simmons is ""kicking my butt"". It's fast paced, but he does warm up and cool down with stretches at the end. There is just one thing I don't like about the videos, but it's not enough to get me to stop using them. While trying to learn the routines, the camera often goes off Richard and shows the people exercising around him. I'm fine with them in the background but I prefer to watch my instructor so to speak. Additionally, the camera on a few occasions will show the upper part of the body when the feet are doing something new and it takes me a few steps to figure it out and catch up. The more I do it the more I'm learning the routine and hopefully that point will be moot for me. But it's just a little frustrating beginning.

I started the videos yesterday and I LOVE it. I am in pretty good shape and workout on a regular basis so I expected the videos to be too easy for me. I really broke a sweat! I adjusted the workouts alittle so that I would be working alittle harder - for example, when they were checking their pulse I ran in place. The workouts really flow by because of the great music and of course, Richard Simmons' mannerisms. What I liked most was the end, when everyone came out and said how much weight they lost. It was truly inspiring to see how much people lost by simply dancing and having fun. I am not one to enjoy working out, but I do it because I have to - but with these tapes I feel like I'm having fun and dancing to great music rather than regular workouts. I highly recommend this box set - it's a great price and you cannot go wrong. Despite what others have said, I found his moves pretty easy to follow and trust me, I am not that coordinated! Yes, he moves on quickly and does not always say what he's doing next, but he repeats those moves so you can catch up and learn them. It is a great, easy way to work out.

Other exercise tapes were boring, or too hard to follow, or featured ""beautiful, and fit people"" that made me feel defeated and awkward before I even started. These are just the ticket. You feel a bit silly at first but overall they ARE fun, and they do get you up and moving which is the point in the first place. They also make you want to use the tapes over and over. Actually you do get a pretty good workout and I would encourage anyone to buy them. It also gave me a respect for Richard Simmons and how much he really cares about people.

Though everyone does seem to have their favorite one, they all start with a low impact aerobic routine, then the warm-up. They increase the intensity and then do a cool down. I tend to use Oldies 2 the most. Some people have mentioned it has props; which is just an average kitchen chair used in the warm up and weights to cool down. Richard and his cast use soda pop bottles to keep with the soda shop theme, so bottles, cans or similar items could be used instead of weights. I like Oldies 2 as it uses the weights and they do floor work in their cool down which includes crunches and leg lifts so it seems to be a more complete workout with the aerobics and the toning.  All four DVD's are fun and upbeat with easy to learn routines. They make exercising fun even when you don't feel like working out (which for me, an over 50 working woman, is most of the time).",1269820800,3,1019,4.1725888324873095

I have to say, I am fairly coordinated but find it difficult to follow the workout. Part of the problem is Richard doesn't give enough warning before changing steps and sometimes doesn't even say he's going to change steps, but the biggest problem is the filming. There are a lot of camera angle changes that don't spotlight Richard and then all of a sudden you realize that the person that the camera is on is doing a different move than what you are doing. That really is my only complaint about the videos though. All in all they are great for someone that is not in the best aerobic shape (I started with walking and then moved to these for a week and now I am using Gin Miller's ""Everybody Steps"" step aerobic video[which is awesome] along with these).

I was sure that Richard would be completely unbearable and annoying, but surprisingly... these workouts are FUN!  He doesn't do a lot of coaching and encouraging throughout the workout like some other workout DVDs I have tried, which I appreicate because I find that to be a very annoying characteristic of other home workout instructors.  Not only did I find it to be enjoyable, but I was actually breaking a sweat!

Sure, Richard Simmons is a little over the top but it's fun anyway.  I recommend the whole set to anyone who hates to exercise but loves to dance to the Oldies.  Richard has a group of people with him, some are very overweight.  They are a real inspiration...if they can keep up, so can I.

Richard Simmons' words will keep you motivated to lose weight and make you feel good about yourself and he was a genius for the idea to make these videos. They are so much fun to do even if you're not too overweight but would like to get up and be active. And it features a live band and real people of all shapes and sizes and fun dances that start out slow then get a bit more challenging. Each set has been remastered for excellent quality and comes with new interviews by Richard himself, and some of the exercisers, which are very interesting to listen to. I used to watch these videotapes all the time when I was a little kid and it brings back a lot of memories.

Volume 1. is set at the Prom. Some songs include ""It's My Party,"" ""Dancing in the Street,"" ""Ain't no mountain high enough,"" ""He's a rebel"" and ""Peggy Sue."" I love how everyone is dressed, very late 80s! So what if the clothes and set are ""outdated?"" That's what makes it fun to watch. I love the set in this one, it's decorated like a party with streamers and balloons and lights. Not a typical prom of today but oh well

Volume 2. is set at Pop's Diner. I don't do this one that often as the exercises are a bit more challenging but I still like to do it every now and then and I'll admit this is a fun one. I like the atmosphere in this one, that it takes place at a 1950s style diner. Some songs include ""Fever,"" ""Loco-motion,"" ""My Boyfriend's Back,"" ""Breakin' up is hard to do,"" and ""Windy.""

Volume 3. is set at Sweatin' Land. One of my favorites. Again I love the atmosphere, that it takes place at an amusement park complete with a Ferris Wheel and a carousel, balloons, and various ""props"" in the background. Some songs include ""Gimme some lovin,"" ""Rockin Robin,"" ""Louie Louie,"" ""California Dreamin'"" and ""The Name Game."" I love the ""behind the scenes"" during the end credits. I wish there was some for volume 1.

Volume 4. Not my favorite as I can't really tell what the ""set"" is and it's not one I normally do, but I do like the gospel choir and some of the music. ""Someday, We'll Be Together,"" ""Mony Mony,"" ""Shout,"" and ""Dance to the music"" are all featured.

But I bought this set because I remember doing these videos as a kid with my mom and just having a blast. You're just dancing around to fun music and it isn't something boring that you dread (unlike other videos that keep repeating ""and squat, and squeeze, and squat...""). Plus he's not annoying or monotone like some video instructors, even when he's all pepped up, if you think it's cheesy, you'll at least get a chuckle. The first video in this series is still my favorite, but the others are good for variety. I lost 25 pounds as a middle schooler doing the first video 4 to 5 times a week. I can't tell you today how it works on my body for weight loss exclusively because I do a wide range of exercises to keep it mixed up (I think it's important to keep your body guessing and to keep boredom/burnout at bay). But what I can tell you is that on days when I do not feel like exercising, I pop in one of these videos and have a great time just dancing away. Also, if you're a beginning exerciser, these videos are great in that you can adjust the moves to where you feel comfortable. As your body gets in better shape you can pump up the moves (think taking small steps side-to-side to jumping side-to-side). All that matters is you're moving. I also enjoyed the extra DVD with interviews and messages from Richard on it. The man has a point: ""If you don't quit, you can't fail!""",1245283200,2,1480,4.308243727598566

Richard is a cut-up, and makes me smile while I exercise. The routines are easy to learn, and most of them are ""dancy"", not just straight 1,2,3,4 exercise movements. They all start out with warm-ups, then ramps up til you are ""sweatin to the oldies"", then cool-down and stretching.
Don't forget to check out the little part at the end of each DVD, where they introduce the ""dancers"". It's motivating to see how much weight some of them had lost.

For those who are not familiar with these videos they are a progressive exercise program beginning with a low impact in Vol 1 and work up to a more vigorous aerobic workout by the 3 & 4 volumes.

There are two things that we as a family like the best about the series. One, is the people. If you are not a professional fitness person who can spend 8 hours per day in exercise, you will appreciate that these videos have normal folks enjoying themselves that is contagious to where you find yourself laughing and having a good time while you exercise.

Two, is the creativity of the sets. The themes were a fantastic idea to give you the sense you were not in some stale, mirrored walls aerobic classroom. Having a live band is also an excellent addition to the set.

I enjoy the moves in Richard's videos and excersizes becuase you might as well be learning choreography for a dance or theatre. And having a hand in theatre that's right up my alley.

I gotta kick the alternate leg up over my head (this maneuver not recommended for those not limber enough to find their own toes. ;-)

I looked more for dance workouts but couldn't find any that didn't either require a wooden floor (uh, I work out on carpet, sorry) or didn't show the person's feet who was doing the moves.  Needless to say, I hoped these videos would be different.  First off, kudos to Richard for motivating so many people and having fun doing it BUT his screechy voice and constant high pitched yelling WILL get on some people's nerves.  Plus, I didn't care for the fact that there were pauses in between songs (don't want to give your heart rate a chance to drop.  I've never seen people walk 5 minutes on a treamill and then stop briefly), the choreography was at times hard to follow (please keep the camera on Richard so I can figure out what he's doing!) and I didn't feel like I was getting my heart rate up.  Probably really good for people that are just getting started but not so much for those that are advanced and just need that little extra boost.",1231286400,8,1056,4.417525773195877
3037559,5,B000Z0UEV0,"I had heard Richard Simmons squeel and motivare on tv and radio. I pictured a workout dvd by him to be something of the same and wouldn't have dreamed I'd own won because of it, ,much less the whole collection! However, I kept reading the accolades on Amazon and it didn't seem to be just a workout for those really out of shape...it seemed to be a workout for both beginners and daily fitness buffs and the word ""fun"" was used quite a bit. So I tried it. Wow! Now I get why he's still on radio and tv as a fitness guru 20 years after his debut. (or more)

I can't believe I was enjoying myself so much during a workout that I found myself grinning from ear to ear...and my heart rate stayed in the target zone, burning great calories.

Whats different? Several things...while most fitness dvds are set to instrumental music that sounds, I'm sorry, like bad instrumental porn music, they actually paid the royalties to use REAL songs with words and music you know. That is a tremendous boost even if you aren't into the ""oldies"" (as Im not...I still loved it) and he has a live band playing and real people all doing the workout.

visually, this gives you so much to look at that you never get bored no matter how often you do it. The multitude of people, shapes and personalities, and the live band, as well as other visual bonuses he adds such as Elvis dancing out onto the set, a motorcycle rider riding onto the set, etc

Physically, the moves are fun, he cues very well, you never get lost in the steps even though you wind up ""dancing"". I have found other fitness dance dvds to leave me confused and out of step and frustrated and feeling like a need a degree in dance. Not true for Richard's dvds...they are simple aerobic moves put together so that they have the movement and feel that you are just having fun dancing while you are doing great cardio.

Time flies on these dvds!! He is motivating, fun, energetic, and these dvds are truly unique in any collection. They are a great workout but a fun workout that anyone can do...from beginner to athlete...and still get exactly what you want out of it.

SO after looking at different excerise videos such as Billy Blanks Taibao- a tad to militant for my tastes- Yoga with Rodney Yee and friends- Yawn.. Zzz.. I found Richard Simmons and Sweatin to the Oldies!!!  I love how cheesy he is!  Just super bubble gum hyper mixed with 1970's-80's fashion disaster wardrobe- Awesome!

Richard's workouts require a tad bit of coordination for his corny dance moves like ""Sizzle"" and ""Prayer."" However don't give up.. like any workout routine such as Jazzercise or even a Spin class there is a small learning curve.

The workouts are deceptive in the fact you think when you begin that you won't end up sweating or getting a cardio workout in- so not true- at the end of a workout I am sweating huffing and puffing.  The music really helps you get modivated- I feel like I am dancing my way to a healthier me- not even realizing that I am working out after the first song starts up!

I also really love that the people who are working out in the video with Richard are REAL people.. Fat- Large- Skinny- Short- Tall etc.. Real people not skinny workout bots.  This makes me want to workout because if those people can- so can I!

Note however if you workout on carpet like at I do- I workout with barefeet.. it might work for you too!  Enjoy Sweatin to the Oldies and getting a healthier new you!",1225152000,11,1750,4.285714285714286

3037590,3,B000Z0UEV0,"I figured I would try Richard Simmons sweating to the oldies because I was getting tired of Tae Bo and wanted something fun.  I recieved my Sweating to the Oldies box set and tried each disk the first week.  The 1st disk was easy to follow and the music was good and Richard was more ""contained"".  I got a good sweat going and was optimistic for the next 3 disks.  Disk 2 was not as good. There were props required that were not explained in the intro or at any point so I had to stop and start the disk several times.  Plus the routine was getting harder to follow.  Disk 3 I like the work out ALOT but you have to play the disk a few times to get the routine right as he switches so often and mixes awkward moves together....starts to get more like coreography for a dance number.  But I did sweat BIG TIME.  So I really like the 3rd disk once I learned the routine.  Disk 4 is harder because the energy is higher and the routines again are more difficult.  But if you play it a few times you get the hang of it.  It would be my advise to skip the box set and just order disks 1 and 3 seperately.  Once you get past the silliness of Richard Simmons...the excersise is great and I look forward to losing weight and gaining muscle.",1224115200,6,1231,4.083333333333333
3037591,2,B000Z0UEV0,"My mother used to workout to Richard Simmons and I just couldn't remember which tape she liked.
Well we got the DVDs and it turns out to be Sweatin to the Oldies Vol. 3 that she loves.  The other ones she said the music was terrible that she had to shut off.
Also the DVD quality was poor.  It's supposed to get better when converting from tape to DVD but maybe it was just the set i got.
Returning the item was super simple through amazon.
So now, I will find Sweatin to the Oldies 2 & 3, and Disco sweat which she loved.
My mother is very heavy set and I think these are the best workouts for her body.  She's not intimidated at all with the people in the workout because they're all different sizes.",1223337600,8,702,4.109489051094891

I have a DVD-R because my VCR finally broke and I like to tape televised sporting events. I have not and will not ever copy a DVD but Richard Simmons has assumed that someone will and has prevented me from even using the DVDs. I am extremely disappointed. I have Sweated to the Oldies for many years and do love the routines and work-outs but now I can not. Anyone who has watched the tapes (VHS or otherwise) knows that he even threatens to arrest his own mother for copyright infringement..well I'm not laughing now. It's ridiculous. It should clearly state on the DVD case or product information that the DVDs will not play on DVD-R. He has lost a customer and a fan.,1222041600,22,783,4.36986301369863

The DVDs get progressively harder, so that once you conquer one, you move on to the next step. This isn't a program for the exercise gurus. It's for those of us that aren't going to run in a marathon, but still want to get some aerobic exercise. It's fun to do and if you have kids they'll probably join in. Husbands will join in to; it's that fun! If you like to dance and like rock and roll, I can almost guarantee that you'll use this program.",1220227200,2,681,4.12781954887218

I am so excited that they put them on DVD. These videos are the best for weight loss. Other videos I have tried were too complex and made my muscles so sore that I didn't want to do them again the next day. Sweatin' to the Oldies is so fun and easy, I exercise with them every day. Some people think these videos are just for people that are extremely obese. They are not. THey are for people of all shapes and sizes. I am 5'7 and 154 lbs. and trying to get down to 140 lbs.

Don't be fooled by the first couple of songs in the workout and give up on them...each video starts with warm-up and stretch songs, then high intensity aerobics songs, followed by cool-down and stetch songs.  If you think the workouts are getting too easy, the chapters on the dvd's make it possible to customize your workout by repeating songs or making selections from all 4 dvd's.  Plus you can do the moves with lots of energy to burn more calories or less energy if you're just starting out.  You won't outgrow these dvd's as you make progress.

I alternate these with weight-lifting, sometimes even adding on a few of their tunes at the end of a weight-lifting session. The music makes you feel happy, and I love Richard.

Some are not particularly graceful, some make minor mistakes, and it makes you feel ok about yourself being less than graceful and making mistakes. When you see people as big as yourself or bigger doing the whole routine, you know you can do it too.

To go from being a super fit Martial Artist and dance in high school to being an over-weight home maker will destroy anyones self esteem and the encouragment given in these work outs is what makes me WANT to do them everyday. They all have a realy great warm-up that builds in intensity to the actual work out. Then, towards the end, it gratually slows down into a good streach!

While surfing Amazon, I came across the Richard Simmons dvds and was surprised to learn it is the 20th anniversary of ""Sweatin to the Oldies"".  Thought ""why not"" and ordered them. What a pleasant surprise! I remember how much fun it was in the 80's but it's even more fun  now! I love the words of encouragement from Richard and --yes-you do sweat!

The warm-ups on these are way too long, but again, would be good for someone who hasn't worked out in awhile. Once you've done the warm-up, the exercises really do get you ""sweatin.""

I really appreciated that not all of the people in the videos were stick thin models or trainers.  He did have trainers, but he also had real people - overweight people - doing the exercises.

I actually feel good about myself DURING the workout as well as after the workout. A few things to note, however, while these DVDs are fun and motivating, you will not achieve the same results you would with other workouts. I have several Jillian michaels workouts and while I HATE doing them, I get better results with her DVDs. I usually do my Richard Simmons DVDs with weights (you have to get creative if you do this because the workouts are actually dances) to offset some of the negatives of doing his FUN DVDs vs. the more result-driven, make-you-hate-life DVDs Jillian michaels produces. I really do love these DVDs and am more likely to do these on days when I would otherwise do nothing. These are fun workouts and you can lose weight with them...just don't expect anything too drastic. These are low-impact workouts and seem to be designed for people who are extremely overweight.

3271401,5,B000Z0UEV0,This is a fun way to work out if you are starting out and a bit overweight. Exercises are not too strenuous. Classic oldies make the work out enjoyable. You are basically just dancing and singing along to your favorite oldies without realizing you are working out. There are people on the video who have been doing Sweatin' to the Oldies for years and others who are just starting out. So you don't feel like you are alone and struggling to work out by yourself.,1430870400,,462,4.447058823529412
3271402,5,B000Z0UEV0,"I used the original 'Sweatin to the Oldies' VHS tapes for years.  Having put on some
weight again, first thing I thought of was 'Richard Simmon's Sweatin' to the Oldies'.
I'd been in an accident, had 3 spinal surgeries in one yr. and when I was finally
recovered.. I had over 70 lbs. to lose!  I did it with these exercise tapes, walking
and modifying my diet a little.
If you've never seen these exercise videos before, they are fun.  The music
itself will get you moving and rachet up your spirits.  I know listening to these
old rock'n'roll tunes always make me feel better no matter where I am or what
I'm doing.  They're great to exercise with.  These are low impact aerobic exercise
videos.  This set is wonderful. You start with the first one and as you improve
you move on the the second one and so on.  I had all his tapes and once I got
into good enough shape,  I played a different one each day for variety.
One of the good things about RS's videos is you're not watching thin, sweet young
things in beautiful exercise outfits.  You're watching people of all ages, shapes
and sizes in everything from leotards and crop tops to sweats and tees.
If you can't keep up... no problem, do what you can and walk in place for a minute or
two and then try again.  If your heart gets to beating too hard, leave some arm movements
out and just move your feet. Little by little you'll be able to do more and more and have
fun doing it.",1429920000,4,1434,4.274074074074074

3271440,5,B000Z0UEV0,"When I found out about these dance-to-the-music tapes several years ago, I began purchasing one tape at a time, until I collected every tape Richard Simmons made. Whether or not you enjoy the oldies-but-goodies, which most people do, it happened to be the music I love the most as a Baby-Boomer, which inspired me to lose weight and keep in shape while having fun.

When I First followed the tapes, I was determined to lose weight and get in shape. After using one tape for 3 months at 3 times a week, I lost 32 pounds. I went from a size 10 to a size 5, just in time for my 20 year high school reunion. My old buddies asked what I did to lose the weight and we talked about these music tapes.

Richard Simmons includes warm-ups, cool-downs, inspiring stories of those who lost weight, and more. The music not only inspires, but motivates you to set a goal, and the program directs you to a healthy life-style.

To this day, I still use these tapes, but at a slower pace as I head for age 65. These videos are not only worth every penny as they encourage you to stay in shape, but you can save a small fortune by simply using these videos instead of spending a great deal of money on gym essentials or memberships. Motivating, Fun, Inspiring. Highly recommended!",1416268800,2,1262,4.384615384615385

3271480,5,B000Z0UEV0,"One thing I will say about Richard is he does do a fun workout that is easy enough for anyone to follow and really seems to care for the people he is helping.  His workout gives you a fantastic exercise program without killing you or setting you in the hospital with joint or back injury.  If you are just starting out or in good shape and workout regularly this is a fun and serious workout.
I had this in the early 90's on VHS and kept looking out for it on DVD.  I thought it would never be re-released, but they finally did release it!  I was very happy about that.  The best part is it is the complete collection.  I love the fact that it is all inclusive and friendly to people of all sizes.  My teen daughter even likes the workout and says it's a lot of fun.  I think even elderly could follow along with small modifications.
I have had all types of workout programs including Wii fit and the dance games for PS2 and 3.  I have also tried many other workout, dance, and aerobic dvd's, but this one, ""sweatin to the oldies 1""  will always be my favorite.",1403136000,4,1061,4.182266009852217

In spite of that, this is a great workout--it just makes you feel really good.  The time goes by so quickly.

Did it for a week when the tape broke and I went searching for a DVD.  Found this box set for far less than a gym membership and just love it.  Since I am a senior citizen, I love the music and low impact aerobics.  Dancing is much more fun than a treadmill.  It moves every part of your body, unlike my usual exercise routine, and you do sweat.  Start with 1 as they do get increasingly harder.  I even have friends coming over for a group session.

It makes the time pass by quickly.  All of these videos work for people of all fitness levels -- beginners can do smaller movements and even do parts of the disk, more advanced people can add their own movement and make the movements bigger while still keeping exercise fun!

I also highly recommend Richard's Sweatin' to the Oldies 4 and 5.  I really wish Richard would release several more Sweatin' to the Oldies DVDs.  I can't get enough of these when it comes workout time.",1396569600,,651,4.707964601769912

The songs are fun and the moves very easy.  The people working with Richard are all different sizes (i.e., not perfect size 6's) so you can workout without being intimidated by skinny people (smile).  Richard Simmons may come across as hokey but you can't fault that this form of exercise is enjoyable!

Probably my fault because I didn't read it thoroughly, but complete implies all, so I had to go back and buy number 5 separately.

I ordered this DVD because I only do workouts DVDs that are realistic. Ones where you don't pull a muscle or scream when they say it was only the warmup you have been doing because you can not go anymore. So far the only ones I have found that are like that and encouraging and don't only feature models or celebrities are Richard, Leslie Sansone and Jane Fonda.

20.00 was an EXTREMELY good price for this box set! I bought it under used and it came in as brand new, wrapped up and appeared to have never been open before. Only thing i did not like is that it took way to long to ship. Sometimes they say SHIPPED but there is now way it actually shipped yet because it wouldn't take 3 weeks to get to you.",1391126400,,982,3.979695431472081

Just get the songs rolling and exercise.  Also, I thought there would be the original artists singing and playing.  He has his own band in the back.  Not bad, but not the original",1391126400,,356,4.253731343283582

The songs are a mix of fast, giving you a good workout, while others are slow and you can't do much with them. Music quality is good and packaging was well done. The 5th CD is all talk; I haven't played it so can't comment on it.

I just play the fast songs, repeating if necessary and skip the slow ones.  If you want a mixed program, this will work well for you just as it's laid out. I can't follow all the moves, so I dance along in my own way.

It shipped very quickly--I was impressed by the speedy delivery.",1390003200,,647,4.0

When I recieved my much awaited package from my mail man, he looked as though he too could use a good work out. So I did what any other noble space cadet in my proffesion would do. I covertly invited him into my humble African bungalo for some snacks, knowing that just like any other wild beast he would accept my offer of food. As we awaited for my freshly slain ostrach to finish cooking I covertly slipped in my new found treasure of a work out tape and began the vigorous excercises. I only do higher level workouts (not that im bragging) but in my time away from being a space cadet i try to behave like any other homosapien and slay wild beasts for tourist out on the wild and dangerous African plain, and that requires me to look fierce. Like Lady Gaga fierce. Usually I go for the standard workout of wrestling the casual lion, but something seemed to call me towards this particular tape. When seeing that I recieved free shipping as an Amazon Prime member I just couldn't resist this deal. It was like offering cake to a fat kind only I was going to indulge in recieving a God like body. During my work out my mail man whose name I learned was the Pinksta informed me that we was going to be initiated into a new gang of mail man meth dealers and needed to loose his extra junk in his trunk. My plan had worked an soon we were doing the workouts together! As we were shaking our booties to the oldies I had a revelation. I was going to marry this man. So inturned around and with Richard Simmmons as my witness I proposed. Seeing as how I had saved his life from obesity and jelly donuts he whole heartedly agreed.  Two hours we were married by an African meth dealer and boy was it beautiful as I walked down the isle with Richard Simmons The Complete  Collection playing soothingly in the background on a state of the art VCR. It was all id ever dreamed of an more seeing that I now had something to believe in. That something was Richard Simmoms. Some would say he was sent by jesus to show us the path to salvation, but I know in my heart Richard Simmons is Jesus. I am now pregnant with my 2nd set of sextuplets and this video has made my life so much more. My family will forever be bonded by the path Richard Simmons has set forth. This Product is life, and I recommend it to anyone who wishes to stay in shape. Or get closer to jesus and survive the upcoming rapture.

However, the camera seems to forget that we at home are trying to do the exercises along with Richard and often just shows his or someone else's face. (We can't see how the body is moving.)

I didn't like going to swim aerobics at 35-38 years of age with all the senior ladies.... so I thought I'd try this. It's absoutly perfect to do in my living room as you move around about 2x2 feet of area. You don't have to over extend yourself! You do it as hard, as fast, and reach as far as you want. I recommend watching the first song over and over until you get the basic dance moves, then move onto the next (it will help you confidence and energy level).
Richard is amazing, and I like that these songs are just good clean fun. No hip hop swear or sexual so when my little boys are around they just want to dance with me.
You still of course have to have the will power to put the tape in and turn the tv on, but once your there, you won't want to stop. Right now I can only do 3 songs, but I'm hoping in the next month I'll be up to 4.",1384560000,,936,3.905759162303665

I have 2 left feet so at first I was just flopping around (but still off the sofa), but the more I did the workouts the better it got and I can now pretty much go right along with everything. The best part is it actually works! I started about 2 months ago (3 times a week) and I have lost an amazing 18 pounds. I feel fantastic and I work out better each time! I love the fact that there are real people working out in the video's and not people that are thin and in shape.

You never feel embarressed that you can't keep up, he is encouraging all the way.  This is truly the way to go if you have been just diagnosed with a health concern that would improve with exercise.

(Whitney Houston,""The Greatest Love of All"")

His ""kookie"" personality puts a smile on your face.  This DVD set is like a fitness ministry.  If you like dancing to the oldies, then you would love Richard Simmon's ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"".  The songs are up-lifting and energizing.  I love it.",1377216000,2,630,5.019230769230769

I recently tried Zumba for the first time (the wii game version of Zumba 2).  Zumba definitely made me sweat, but I really, truly did not like the music (call me crazy).  Also, I found myself a bit put off by the animated instructors (one of them was the spitting image of Kristen Stewart, which was kind of freaky).  Anyway....even if I could follow all of the steps, I just couldn't tolerate the music, so I sold my Zumba....after one week.....and ordered this collection.  I have never, ever had a Richard Simmons workout tape of any kind before, and I wish I had tried it years...decades...ago.  I love most of the music, even though a lot of it is before my time.  I love the ""live people,"" even though you can't win points or unlock bonuses.  Richard Simmons is funny and fun, and his steps are easy to follow.  Honestly, after four days (one day per dvd in this set), in comparing to Zumba, I probably don't sweat QUITE as much, but I got WAY more tired.....because these workouts use your whole body..a lot of arm work, for example, NOT just shaking your hips and moving your feet.  I LOVE these dvds.  And I am sure that, once I actually get off the couch and DO them instead of just WATCHING them, my workout will be even BETTER.  (KIDDING)  Today I ordered Sweatin 5 in a set with a toning workout, and one other of Richard's workouts.....so I will have a variety to choose from every day.",1377043200,2,1535,4.355633802816901

Personally, I find most forms of exercise monotonous and I've never liked the atmosphere of gyms. These dvds offer a good variety and I can do the routines at home which is a big plus for me.

These exercises are pretty much low impact, so anyone can do them, but they get your heart rate up. The music is the best! Also at the end of the workout the exercisers dance on out and they show how much weight they have lost, very inspiring. These are my favorite aerobics DVDs. They are great when you get home from work and really don't want to work out.

Richard Simmons has always seemed very obnoxious to me and I must say that I got this DVR thinking (can't recall where I read this) that I could ""turn off"" his voice and still have the music and visual.  Doesn't seem to be a way to do that.  However, I'm not as bothered as I thought I'd be.  Some people complained that it was hard to follow his moves.  This is true so if it bothers you not to get it just right this is not for you.  Truth is that what's important here is to keep moving and have fun, not to follow the moves exactly.  This is good exercise for people who enjoy dancing, like the oldies and want to be able to work out at home.  I should probably say that I'm 62 years old and have found it hard in recent years to stick with any exercise routine until someone recommended Leslie Sansone's ""Walk Away the Pounds"".  After several months of doing that I wanted variety so got the Richard Simmons which is a bit more taxing (I sweat more and get my heart rate up higher).

It truly is  the best workout, after 10 minutes, you are in a sweat, but you won't care because  the music is fabulous and Richard is charming, encouraging, warm and  genuine. The bonus features are terrific:, sometimes poignant  and sad, but always hopeful!",1373587200,2,616,4.1344537815126055

Three and four (to me a non-dancer), are a bit too elaborate in the choreography.  Some people would probably like this.  I enjoy familiar repetition in exercise.  Just the physical effort is enough.

Which brings me to the main point.  These videos kick your butt.  Especially if you are out of shape.  You can laugh at Richard Simmons if you think he is goofy.  But you will get in shape if you use the videos.

He is full of joy and it comes through and keeps me going.  My heart rate goes up and I sweat.  My favorite work-out is Sweating to the Oldies 2 as it has the aerobics plus arm work with weights and ab work.  It's fun and it's effective and I'm down 9 pounds already.

I used to exercise to someone else's DVD, and she just had some towels and a few plants in the background.  Richard is into the big show.  In Sweatin' 4, my favorite one, he has a big stage, a gospel choir, fancy schmancy lighting and scenery with musical notes and lights, and a band.  He pairs the exercise with music and other stuff that people really like. He is a real behavior modification genius the way he has gotten so many people to buy his DVDs and exercise. I really like the people in his DVDs as well.  They are all ages, shapes, and sizes- and they are great enthusiastic and talented dancers. You get all of the Sweatin DVDs in this package, so if you get bored with one, you can use another one.  The music is really good!!",1359504000,4,892,4.273809523809524

3271753,4,B000Z0UEV0,I love love love these DVDs. I only chose to not give it 5 stars because after each song Richard and everyone doing the workout stop to applaud the band. I don't stop and just keep on marching but it still irritates me I have to just march and wait. If you stop you lower your heart rate down too low. He has rectified this in other DVDs like Party Off the Pounds where there is no break and the songs slide seamlessly from one to the next. Apart from this one little issue the DVDs are fun and can be quite challenging if you put the effort in. If you follow along and make your moves nice and big you will feel the burn. The moves are not difficult so I find it very easy to keep up. Highly recommend this DVD set.,1358208000,2,716,3.9791666666666665

There's no more fun way to do that than to sweat with Richard Simmons and his band of ordinary, just-like-me people. These are the workouts that I would actually stick to, over time, more than 20 years ago, and they're the ones I'll do today, now that they are finally available on DVD. I love the music, I love to feel like I'm just dancing rather than working out, I love that I'm not paying $$$$ at some gym, and I love that I can do this low-impact exercise without hurting something. To be fair about it, this is not a complete program for getting in good shape - I still have to do strength training on alternate days, because these 4 discs only give me the cardio workouts I need. Even so, I'm delighted to have these fun exercise routines back in my life. Even though they were recorded nearly 25 years ago, they seem timeless. Highly recommended.",1357171200,2,967,4.468926553672317

Normally I do water aerobics three times a week and it's a pretty strenuous program so I just wanted something that would get me moving for 30-45 minutes on the off days.  This works perfectly.  It's enough to get my heart rate to a decent level, the choreography is simple and the music is just fun.  There are a few more DVDs beyond this set which I will probably buy just to have a change.",1355616000,,520,4.222222222222222

3271779,5,B000Z0UEV0,"I bought this box set and I am so glad I did. I love Richard's videos because they are fun and you don't feel like you're exercising. You don't even want them to end. Richard's first four ""Sweatin'"" videos are the best of his work and they are the videos I most turn to when I want to get moving. They are great for people who love oldies music like I do and each video is an oldies theme with live music. They are really cute. The four videos get progressively harder so it's worth it to start with number one first, but I find I actually like the later videos better because they become more like dancing and less like exercising. Because Richard doesn't really teach the steps or do much verbal coaching (he does occasionally announce when the step changes, but more often not), it takes a few times of watching before you learn all the moves. But the moves are all really easy so you don't need to worry if you don't know how to dance. Also, the best thing is to just get started and not worry if you can't get your hands and feet to do everything exactly as is on the first few times. You'll see on the video that even the people in the video make mistakes. The important thing is to just get started and eventually you'll get it. Once you do, you'll realize how fun and easy it really is.

I also like all the extras that come with this set. The interviews are really inspiring and great motivators. I will admit that most people will not look like models just from these videos alone, but they will probably help overweight people lose a few pounds and they are definitely good for staying fit and active. If you are looking for maximum benefit for your exercise routine, you should try something harder. These are really just for fun and for people who would otherwise not exercise at all. Well worth it, though!",1352851200,2,1820,4.3372434017595305
3271780,4,B000Z0UEV0,Getting all five DVDs at this price was worth it.  I can switch around with which one I use so I don't get bored just doing one.,1352592000,,128,3.740740740740741

3271782,5,B000Z0UEV0,The time flies and the sweat pours off!  Great fun.  Makes me smile while I am dancing to the songs I grew up on.,1351987200,,113,3.6666666666666665
3271783,5,B000Z0UEV0,"The bottom line about the Sweatin' To The Oldies videos is, if you use them regularly (I do them about 5 times a week, sometimes every day of the week), and make any necessary healthy changes to your diet you need to make, you WILL lose weight with these.  Also, I personally don't believe you'll find another ""weight loss guru"" who cares as much as Richard does about you getting fit.  It's what he's dedicated his life to.

So - if you want something that really works, presented in a fun and easy to follow format with fun moves, this will be worth your money and then some.  I'm living proof - 11 pounds & 7 3/4"" lost already and I just bought these in late September or early October 2012.

The moves are easy to catch on to - you can always watch the videos a couple of times & you should be able to follow fairly easily.  The music is not done by the original artists, but this is necesary to get a better workout.  After all, you're going to sweat more through a 7 minute version of Jailhouse Rock versus the original 3!  The music still sounds great - you honestly will be panting & sweating too much to care.  And that's the whole point.",1351468800,5,1147,4.224770642201835
3271784,5,B000Z0UEV0,This is a great value all four DVD's plus a bonus DVD that is very inspirational and motivational. I like the live bands and the music is timeless. One thing that I do not like is that the camera men zoom in on particular women in the videos usually the thin aerobic instructor look alikes. I think that the camera should focus on Richard and the rest of the people are basically in the back ground. I noticed that the  videos  become more difficult and more fun actually as the numbers increase. I like the little motivations Richard throws in  like you are doing great and thank you for dancing with me etc. It is fun to watch the end when the people come out and proudly dance and show you how many pounds they have lost. It is fun to watch people who are struggling to lose weight  getting out there and taking care of their health and trying so hard to help others. I like these videos because you can dance in the privacy of your own home and not have to feel like you should hide in the back of the room like you do in a public aerobics class. You can work at your own pace. Richard Simmns is fun and motivational.,1351296000,,1121,4.175925925925926

It was so much fun I didn't feel like I was working out at all (but I did work up a sweat)  I loved it that it worked you up into your workout, didn't throw you in.  I felt like it was a nice workout, not one that you feel passing out after 15 minutes.  Another thing I absolutely loved is that people seemed to be doing all different variations of the workout.  At times when I screwed up the moves, it didn't matter, and I didn't feel like I screwed up!  No mechanical dancing in this video I LOOOOOOVVVVEEE it!

3271804,5,B000Z0UEV0,"Look past the fuzzy hair, pink, rhinestone tanktops and the reminders of ""hug yourselves ladies!!"" and you'll find a man who is completely passionate about health and fitness. There is nobody else in the exercise video market that fits into Richard's category. Not only does he love what he's doing, but he wants everyone else to love it to. In his Sweatin' to the Oldies series, you get to experience his awesome band playing the songs you know the words to, not the typical music you hear on exercise videos. When I pop in any of the DVDs from this set, I start singing and dancing, whooping and hollering right along with him for the band. I can't help it. I'm not old, but I grew up on this music and I appreciate it a lot more than the junky pop music of today. I'd rather exercise to The Beach Boys than Lady Gaga any day. It's a really fun workout with great music and I catch myself freestyling because I get into it. It is low intensity, so it makes for a good workout for overweight and fit alike. I'm used to pretty intense stuff, but when I don't feel like working out and I want to do something fun, I pull out my Sweatin box set and push play. Richard is an inspiring, wonderful man who has been on the fitness scene for decades. He came from obesity. He understands where real people have come from. He has real people in his programs. Young, old, thin, heavy...I respect him so much.

Plus, at the end of the workouts, all the people from the video line up and it shows all their names and how much weight they lost. I hope this review helped. :)",1346284800,,1562,4.277027027027027
3271825,5,B000Z0UEV0,This is a terrific workout - especially if you are just starting out.  It doesn't matter how big you are or how old you are or how out of shape you are.  You can do this one!,1344556800,,174,3.675675675675676
3271826,5,B000Z0UEV0,"I have purchased, borrowed, and rented several exercise DVDs since I decided to take better care of myself. To give you a better picture, I am... well, honestly 38, but I prefer to admit to 35 years old, and no longer overweight. Don't tell anyone, but I have gone from a size -- to a size 3. I own, and enjoy Kathy Smith's yoga, but do not feel that it provides enough of a cardio workout. I borrowed a Denise Austin DVD, and that woman makes me feel like a pathetic loser. So, I decided to give Sweatin' to the Oldies a try. I love it! When most people on the video are stepping, I am able to ""run,"" making me feel like, ""Hey! I'm a Rockstar!"" When I tire, I can slow down, but still keep up with the exercises. I would definitely recommend this DVD series to anyone just beginning, but also to those who feel like an uncoordinated sack when trying to workout alongside many other fitness gurus.",1344124800,2,897,4.251461988304094

He may look out of date, but the workout is FUN, real fun..  You dance to your level of sweating...  You WILL lose weight, and actually enjoy dancing. I think the new workouts, should turn the clock back, and start having dance again. They tried it with zumba, but they failed. Everyone loves rock and roll, any age..  lets rock the weight off..",1340668800,,471,4.379310344827586

They are just as funny as I remembered too",1340150400,,152,3.25

3271847,5,B000Z0UEV0,I was looking for a fun way to exercise and this was it. There is music I grew up with and people of all ages and sizes dancing to a live band. And of course Richard Simmons is always fun. It is not complicated and no difficult moves. Just dancing and everyone likes to dance. I am very happy with it and have recomended it to friends.,1336608000,,335,4.014925373134329
3271848,3,B000Z0UEV0,"I know Richard Simmons is a workout guru.  I love to exercise at home with DVDs.  I bought this set of Sweatin' to the Oldies thinking it would be a fun set of aerobics videos.  But I had a hard time following a lot of his moves.  He does not give any cues as to what the moves are.  The workouts are kind of fun and infectious, but I found myself making up my own moves frequently.",1336348800,,382,3.909090909090909
3271849,4,B000Z0UEV0,"I liked Richard Simmons' Sweating to the Oldies collection. The oldies made exercising a lot more fun. Some people will find the steps too tame, but they were easy to follow, nonstop and before you knew it, you had been sweating for an hour. I would have preferred a little more variety - sometimes, a new step just meant turning to on side and doing the same thing over and over - but, again, you got a steady cardiovascular workout and looked forward to doing it again, perhaps improvising a bit to the music. Not for heavy-duty athletes, but would definitely recommend it to the average person who finds it hard to get motivated to exercise.",1336176000,,644,4.560344827586207

I am in the over 50 age group and out of shape and overweight, so this is perfect. The music is great and Richard Simmons makes it fun. Richard Simmons uses real people in the video and not all muscle-fit people that say, yes, you too can look like this in 2 months. The moves he does, most people can do, and if need be, you can modify it for yourself. The main thing is to have fun, enjoy the music and get moving! I wish I had bought this set along time ago. I highly recommend it.",1334275200,,643,3.8059701492537314

I've aged along with that tape, and being older, I knew that this video could help because it doesn't put a lot of pressure on the joints (like bad knees).  It also gives you a great workout -- and it's FUN!  I hate exercising, and ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" makes it enjoyable and I know I'm still getting exercise.  Richard Simmons has heart and soul, and it comes through with every move he takes.  The music is great, live band, ""real"" people (not models), exercises that work you out, but are fun to do!  It's a classic!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1326672000,,681,4.307086614173229

3271872,2,B000Z0UEV0,"I purchased these DVD's a while ago and unfortunately I wish I could get my money back. It had been a long time since I had worked out so I thought this would be the perfect way to help me build up my endurance before going on to more Advanced DVD's.  Its actually low impact enough so you don't feel like your gonna pass out but its not so low that you feel like you didn't do anything. For this I will at least give it a two. The main reason I don't like it is I find Richard way too spastic.  I like DVD's where the routines are repetitive like two or three sets of the same move.  With Richard he does a move a couple times then on to the next, this makes it super hard to keep up. I just start doing something he's doing and then he's already doing something else.  I am sorry but thats too much, I don't like feeling confused when I work out, I want to be able to keep up. Its almost like you have to do the video enough times that you memorize it so you can keep up. Plus I am not crazy about 50's music, I can do 70's or 80's but 50's no. That being said the music didn't help motivate me to wanna move and get into it (and I need as much motivation as I can get).  This set is collecting dust right now,  I plan to put it on ebay or craigslist to get rid of it,  I would not recommend it but hey to each his own.",1314230400,2,1321,3.7992700729927007
3271873,2,B000Z0UEV0,"The ""exercise part"" was great, but I REALLY do not like all the talking Richard does at the beginning and end of each dvd.  He talks too much and it takes too long to fast forward each time to get to the exercise.  I would not recommend it for this reason.

However, I was a little disappointed to find that Sweatin' to the Oldies 5 was not included in this ""Complete"" collection.  The fifth dvd is a motivational message from Richard instead of the expected Oldies 5.  Now I will have to purchase Oldies 5 separately.  I'm sure it will be as much fun as the other Oldies.

I switch the video's around because he works on all different routines.#2 he even tricked you & through in some floor exercises & used weights. He used pop bottles I used real weights but they really wore me out! I hope Richard keeps making these video's he really inspires me to workout with him. Thank You!! I'm 60 years old & it doesn't matter how old you are you just do what you can & it does get easier if you think any of them are hard. Each workout is 1 hour long & that's perfect. When you are working out you think to yourself this isn't going to do anything but you eat your words by the time your done because you feel good that you did it & your sweatin. I have a glass of water by me if I need too I take a drink! So if you want a good workout buy this collection because it's a fun way to exercise & have fun doing it!!!,1304899200,,935,3.875

It's fun, easy to follow, and I love that the people doing the workout with Richard Simmons are real people, at various stages of weight loss, instead of model-thin buff-bodied men and women you find on most videos. Sweatin' to the Oldies is especially great for people who are just starting out on an exercise program. Now that I've been working out for a while, I've added walking to my fitness program, but I still use STTO three times a week because it works muscles I don't use as much during my power walks. Also, it breaks up the monotony of walking with something that is FUN. The music is a perfect tempo, and Richard is a hoot. If you've been planning to start exercising but are intimidated by all those gorgeous bodies on those too-fast, too-complicated workout videos and are bored by walking, try Sweatin' to the Oldies.

Richard talking and interviews.  By the time we got to a workout I was already not happy.  I paid to sweat not listen to testimonials.
Richard assumes you know the meaning of the steps he yells out.  I didn't.  He's got a large group of folks sweatin with him.
The camera pans them so often and badly I might add that you can't follow the routine.  Not all of them are doing the
same thing and when the camera does go to Richard it's his face/body and nothing of his feet.
Very, very poorly instructed and filmed. Don't waste your time or money.  I sent mine back.  Amazon gladly refunded my money.
I found a great way to exercise at home with Leslie Sansone.  You get a great cardio/aerobic workout and you can find her online at Exercise TV.  Not only do you get a great work out, she's free.",1297296000,16,993,4.28494623655914

This workout was always perfect for me, low impact on my knee's is a huge consideration. They are just as I remember, fun with a great warm up and cool down. Richard get's my heart pumping. I can increase or decrease the intensity by small adjustments and get a quality workout.

I work my legs and step along with the DVD -while sitting - as much as I can. It makes me feel GREAT! And I've lost weight & inches.
We all need to exercise and it can be really hard when you're handicapped. Richard's DVD makes it fun and easy with just a little adaptation. Thanks Richard.

I got the complete collection which is great for keeping it fresh do one a day Monday through Thursday and then go back to my walking video on Friday.

I've been telling friends that Richard Simmons is ""kicking my butt"". It's fast paced, but he does warm up and cool down with stretches at the end. There is just one thing I don't like about the videos, but it's not enough to get me to stop using them. While trying to learn the routines, the camera often goes off Richard and shows the people exercising around him. I'm fine with them in the background but I prefer to watch my instructor so to speak. Additionally, the camera on a few occasions will show the upper part of the body when the feet are doing something new and it takes me a few steps to figure it out and catch up. The more I do it the more I'm learning the routine and hopefully that point will be moot for me. But it's just a little frustrating beginning.

I started the videos yesterday and I LOVE it. I am in pretty good shape and workout on a regular basis so I expected the videos to be too easy for me. I really broke a sweat! I adjusted the workouts alittle so that I would be working alittle harder - for example, when they were checking their pulse I ran in place. The workouts really flow by because of the great music and of course, Richard Simmons' mannerisms. What I liked most was the end, when everyone came out and said how much weight they lost. It was truly inspiring to see how much people lost by simply dancing and having fun. I am not one to enjoy working out, but I do it because I have to - but with these tapes I feel like I'm having fun and dancing to great music rather than regular workouts. I highly recommend this box set - it's a great price and you cannot go wrong. Despite what others have said, I found his moves pretty easy to follow and trust me, I am not that coordinated! Yes, he moves on quickly and does not always say what he's doing next, but he repeats those moves so you can catch up and learn them. It is a great, easy way to work out.

Other exercise tapes were boring, or too hard to follow, or featured ""beautiful, and fit people"" that made me feel defeated and awkward before I even started. These are just the ticket. You feel a bit silly at first but overall they ARE fun, and they do get you up and moving which is the point in the first place. They also make you want to use the tapes over and over. Actually you do get a pretty good workout and I would encourage anyone to buy them. It also gave me a respect for Richard Simmons and how much he really cares about people.

Though everyone does seem to have their favorite one, they all start with a low impact aerobic routine, then the warm-up. They increase the intensity and then do a cool down. I tend to use Oldies 2 the most. Some people have mentioned it has props; which is just an average kitchen chair used in the warm up and weights to cool down. Richard and his cast use soda pop bottles to keep with the soda shop theme, so bottles, cans or similar items could be used instead of weights. I like Oldies 2 as it uses the weights and they do floor work in their cool down which includes crunches and leg lifts so it seems to be a more complete workout with the aerobics and the toning.  All four DVD's are fun and upbeat with easy to learn routines. They make exercising fun even when you don't feel like working out (which for me, an over 50 working woman, is most of the time).",1269820800,3,1019,4.1725888324873095

I have to say, I am fairly coordinated but find it difficult to follow the workout. Part of the problem is Richard doesn't give enough warning before changing steps and sometimes doesn't even say he's going to change steps, but the biggest problem is the filming. There are a lot of camera angle changes that don't spotlight Richard and then all of a sudden you realize that the person that the camera is on is doing a different move than what you are doing. That really is my only complaint about the videos though. All in all they are great for someone that is not in the best aerobic shape (I started with walking and then moved to these for a week and now I am using Gin Miller's ""Everybody Steps"" step aerobic video[which is awesome] along with these).

I was sure that Richard would be completely unbearable and annoying, but surprisingly... these workouts are FUN!  He doesn't do a lot of coaching and encouraging throughout the workout like some other workout DVDs I have tried, which I appreicate because I find that to be a very annoying characteristic of other home workout instructors.

I then discovered these videos years ago and I couldn't believe how it keeps u coming back for more and the results are wonderful. I now weigh a 140 pounds (5'8 inches tall) and I still work out to different videos of Richard Simmons (Disco Sweat is a good one as well). I lost most of my weight to this set of videos (with a diet of course) and would recommend it to anyone.... Try it ...... I enjoyed it and still do.",1263254400,4,745,4.04054054054054

Sure, Richard Simmons is a little over the top but it's fun anyway.  I recommend the whole set to anyone who hates to exercise but loves to dance to the Oldies.  Richard has a group of people with him, some are very overweight.  They are a real inspiration...if they can keep up, so can I.

Richard Simmons' words will keep you motivated to lose weight and make you feel good about yourself and he was a genius for the idea to make these videos. They are so much fun to do even if you're not too overweight but would like to get up and be active. And it features a live band and real people of all shapes and sizes and fun dances that start out slow then get a bit more challenging. Each set has been remastered for excellent quality and comes with new interviews by Richard himself, and some of the exercisers, which are very interesting to listen to. I used to watch these videotapes all the time when I was a little kid and it brings back a lot of memories.

Volume 1. is set at the Prom. Some songs include ""It's My Party,"" ""Dancing in the Street,"" ""Ain't no mountain high enough,"" ""He's a rebel"" and ""Peggy Sue."" I love how everyone is dressed, very late 80s! So what if the clothes and set are ""outdated?"" That's what makes it fun to watch. I love the set in this one, it's decorated like a party with streamers and balloons and lights. Not a typical prom of today but oh well

Volume 2. is set at Pop's Diner. I don't do this one that often as the exercises are a bit more challenging but I still like to do it every now and then and I'll admit this is a fun one. I like the atmosphere in this one, that it takes place at a 1950s style diner. Some songs include ""Fever,"" ""Loco-motion,"" ""My Boyfriend's Back,"" ""Breakin' up is hard to do,"" and ""Windy.""

Volume 3. is set at Sweatin' Land. One of my favorites. Again I love the atmosphere, that it takes place at an amusement park complete with a Ferris Wheel and a carousel, balloons, and various ""props"" in the background. Some songs include ""Gimme some lovin,"" ""Rockin Robin,"" ""Louie Louie,"" ""California Dreamin'"" and ""The Name Game."" I love the ""behind the scenes"" during the end credits. I wish there was some for volume 1.

Volume 4. Not my favorite as I can't really tell what the ""set"" is and it's not one I normally do, but I do like the gospel choir and some of the music. ""Someday, We'll Be Together,"" ""Mony Mony,"" ""Shout,"" and ""Dance to the music"" are all featured.

But I bought this set because I remember doing these videos as a kid with my mom and just having a blast. You're just dancing around to fun music and it isn't something boring that you dread (unlike other videos that keep repeating ""and squat, and squeeze, and squat...""). Plus he's not annoying or monotone like some video instructors, even when he's all pepped up, if you think it's cheesy, you'll at least get a chuckle. The first video in this series is still my favorite, but the others are good for variety. I lost 25 pounds as a middle schooler doing the first video 4 to 5 times a week. I can't tell you today how it works on my body for weight loss exclusively because I do a wide range of exercises to keep it mixed up (I think it's important to keep your body guessing and to keep boredom/burnout at bay). But what I can tell you is that on days when I do not feel like exercising, I pop in one of these videos and have a great time just dancing away. Also, if you're a beginning exerciser, these videos are great in that you can adjust the moves to where you feel comfortable. As your body gets in better shape you can pump up the moves (think taking small steps side-to-side to jumping side-to-side). All that matters is you're moving. I also enjoyed the extra DVD with interviews and messages from Richard on it. The man has a point: ""If you don't quit, you can't fail!""",1245283200,2,1480,4.308243727598566

Richard is a cut-up, and makes me smile while I exercise. The routines are easy to learn, and most of them are ""dancy"", not just straight 1,2,3,4 exercise movements. They all start out with warm-ups, then ramps up til you are ""sweatin to the oldies"", then cool-down and stretching.
Don't forget to check out the little part at the end of each DVD, where they introduce the ""dancers"". It's motivating to see how much weight some of them had lost.

For those who are not familiar with these videos they are a progressive exercise program beginning with a low impact in Vol 1 and work up to a more vigorous aerobic workout by the 3 & 4 volumes.

There are two things that we as a family like the best about the series. One, is the people. If you are not a professional fitness person who can spend 8 hours per day in exercise, you will appreciate that these videos have normal folks enjoying themselves that is contagious to where you find yourself laughing and having a good time while you exercise.

Two, is the creativity of the sets. The themes were a fantastic idea to give you the sense you were not in some stale, mirrored walls aerobic classroom. Having a live band is also an excellent addition to the set.

I gotta kick the alternate leg up over my head (this maneuver not recommended for those not limber enough to find their own toes. ;-)

3272055,2,B000Z0UEV0,"I bought these videos because I was getting bored of doing the same workouts at home and needed some variety.  I looked more for dance workouts but couldn't find any that didn't either require a wooden floor (uh, I work out on carpet, sorry) or didn't show the person's feet who was doing the moves.  Needless to say, I hoped these videos would be different.  First off, kudos to Richard for motivating so many people and having fun doing it BUT his screechy voice and constant high pitched yelling WILL get on some people's nerves.  Plus, I didn't care for the fact that there were pauses in between songs (don't want to give your heart rate a chance to drop.  I've never seen people walk 5 minutes on a treamill and then stop briefly), the choreography was at times hard to follow (please keep the camera on Richard so I can figure out what he's doing!) and I didn't feel like I was getting my heart rate up.  Probably really good for people that are just getting started but not so much for those that are advanced and just need that little extra boost.",1231286400,8,1056,4.417525773195877
3272056,5,B000Z0UEV0,"I had heard Richard Simmons squeel and motivare on tv and radio. I pictured a workout dvd by him to be something of the same and wouldn't have dreamed I'd own won because of it, ,much less the whole collection! However, I kept reading the accolades on Amazon and it didn't seem to be just a workout for those really out of shape...it seemed to be a workout for both beginners and daily fitness buffs and the word ""fun"" was used quite a bit. So I tried it. Wow! Now I get why he's still on radio and tv as a fitness guru 20 years after his debut. (or more)

I can't believe I was enjoying myself so much during a workout that I found myself grinning from ear to ear...and my heart rate stayed in the target zone, burning great calories.

Whats different? Several things...while most fitness dvds are set to instrumental music that sounds, I'm sorry, like bad instrumental porn music, they actually paid the royalties to use REAL songs with words and music you know. That is a tremendous boost even if you aren't into the ""oldies"" (as Im not...I still loved it) and he has a live band playing and real people all doing the workout.

visually, this gives you so much to look at that you never get bored no matter how often you do it. The multitude of people, shapes and personalities, and the live band, as well as other visual bonuses he adds such as Elvis dancing out onto the set, a motorcycle rider riding onto the set, etc

Physically, the moves are fun, he cues very well, you never get lost in the steps even though you wind up ""dancing"". I have found other fitness dance dvds to leave me confused and out of step and frustrated and feeling like a need a degree in dance. Not true for Richard's dvds...they are simple aerobic moves put together so that they have the movement and feel that you are just having fun dancing while you are doing great cardio.

Time flies on these dvds!! He is motivating, fun, energetic, and these dvds are truly unique in any collection. They are a great workout but a fun workout that anyone can do...from beginner to athlete...and still get exactly what you want out of it.

I can't believe I'm saying it, but i'm now a true fan He is a household name for a reason.  Good, fun, workout with maximum results! And easy to amp up or amp down as you wish",1230422400,50,2287,4.34192037470726
3272067,4,B000Z0UEV0,I've only done the first one so far but it seems to be a fairly simple workout that anyone can probably do.

3272075,5,B000Z0UEV0,"I hate to workout but I want to get healthy and stay healthy.  As a Muslim woman workout options are limited by my desire to not mix with men- so what to do?  Women only gyms are few and far between in San Diego and as a student I don't want to get stuck in paying for a year membership to a gym I don't end up using because as a large woman its intimidation to go to gyms that seem to cater to already skinny people.

SO after looking at different excerise videos such as Billy Blanks Taibao- a tad to militant for my tastes- Yoga with Rodney Yee and friends- Yawn.. Zzz.. I found Richard Simmons and Sweatin to the Oldies!!!  I love how cheesy he is!  Just super bubble gum hyper mixed with 1970's-80's fashion disaster wardrobe- Awesome!

Richard's workouts require a tad bit of coordination for his corny dance moves like ""Sizzle"" and ""Prayer."" However don't give up.. like any workout routine such as Jazzercise or even a Spin class there is a small learning curve.

The workouts are deceptive in the fact you think when you begin that you won't end up sweating or getting a cardio workout in- so not true- at the end of a workout I am sweating huffing and puffing.  The music really helps you get modivated- I feel like I am dancing my way to a healthier me- not even realizing that I am working out after the first song starts up!

I also really love that the people who are working out in the video with Richard are REAL people.. Fat- Large- Skinny- Short- Tall etc.. Real people not skinny workout bots.  This makes me want to workout because if those people can- so can I!

Note however if you workout on carpet like at I do- I workout with barefeet.. it might work for you too!  Enjoy Sweatin to the Oldies and getting a healthier new you!",1225152000,11,1750,4.285714285714286

3272087,3,B000Z0UEV0,"I figured I would try Richard Simmons sweating to the oldies because I was getting tired of Tae Bo and wanted something fun.  I recieved my Sweating to the Oldies box set and tried each disk the first week.  The 1st disk was easy to follow and the music was good and Richard was more ""contained"".  I got a good sweat going and was optimistic for the next 3 disks.  Disk 2 was not as good. There were props required that were not explained in the intro or at any point so I had to stop and start the disk several times.  Plus the routine was getting harder to follow.  Disk 3 I like the work out ALOT but you have to play the disk a few times to get the routine right as he switches so often and mixes awkward moves together....starts to get more like coreography for a dance number.  But I did sweat BIG TIME.  So I really like the 3rd disk once I learned the routine.  Disk 4 is harder because the energy is higher and the routines again are more difficult.  But if you play it a few times you get the hang of it.  It would be my advise to skip the box set and just order disks 1 and 3 seperately.  Once you get past the silliness of Richard Simmons...the excersise is great and I look forward to losing weight and gaining muscle.",1224115200,6,1231,4.083333333333333

Also the DVD quality was poor.  It's supposed to get better when converting from tape to DVD but maybe it was just the set i got.
Returning the item was super simple through amazon.
So now, I will find Sweatin to the Oldies 2 & 3, and Disco sweat which she loved.

I have not and will not ever copy a DVD but Richard Simmons has assumed that someone will and has prevented me from even using the DVDs. I am extremely disappointed. I have Sweated to the Oldies for many years and do love the routines and work-outs but now I can not. Anyone who has watched the tapes (VHS or otherwise) knows that he even threatens to arrest his own mother for copyright infringement..well I'm not laughing now. It's ridiculous.

I think I'll only do it for one-half hour because it it better than doing nothing.  Once I get into it, I can't stop.  I finally got my waistline back.  It is not only fun to do, but very entertaining. I am a senior and I would recommend Richard Simmons DVD's to anyone who wants to lose inches.",1210550400,22,468,4.0

3272136,4,B000Z0UEV0,"I used to do these with my mom when I was a teenager and they are just as fun as I remember.  For those of you hoping for an intense workout this is not for you, however for everyone else I think you'll enjoy it. The steps are easy to follow and it does get you sweating. I love this for my light workout days.  My only real complaint is sometimes the camera zooms in on one of the back up people when Richard is changing steps and you don't get a clear idea of what he's doing.  Mr. Simmons can be a bit annoying at first, but it's easy to put that aside as you get into it.  All in all it's a fun workout and gets you moving.",1208390400,,627,3.8
3272147,5,B000Z0UEV0,"These are basically aerobic workouts, good for starting an exercise routine or for adding to an existing exercise program.  They give a better aerobic workout than walking--you'll definately feel yourself working--and they're great for adding variety to your exercising.

Don't be fooled by the first couple of songs in the workout and give up on them...each video starts with warm-up and stretch songs, then high intensity aerobics songs, followed by cool-down and stetch songs.  If you think the workouts are getting too easy, the chapters on the dvd's make it possible to customize your workout by repeating songs or making selections from all 4 dvd's.  Plus you can do the moves with lots of energy to burn more calories or less energy if you're just starting out.  You won't outgrow these dvd's as you make progress.

I alternate these with weight-lifting, sometimes even adding on a few of their tunes at the end of a weight-lifting session. The music makes you feel happy, and I love Richard.  His genuine compassion shows through and he makes the workouts fun.  I also love the live bands.  These aren't your ordinary exercise dvd's!!  Thanks, Richard!  I hope he will bring out some more of his exercise programs on dvd sets.  They're great!",1208044800,23,1250,4.92822966507177

Now, I can put a DVD in the player when it's raining or gross outside.  It took me a couple of times again to learn the steps but once you have them it's great!

For those who have never exercised with his videos before, my advice is to watch it once and then try to follow along.  They are the best!!!",1207699200,2,457,3.870967741935484

It starts off slowly and the moves are all easy to follow. The music is great, there's a live band and the whole scene is entertaining. I love seeing real people doing the exercises. Some are not particularly graceful, some make minor mistakes, and it makes you feel ok about yourself being less than graceful and making mistakes. When you see people as big as yourself or bigger doing the whole routine, you know you can do it too. The package comes with four workouts and they're all similar with the oldies music, live bands, and real people.

""keep sweatin' you CAN reach your goals!"" and so on. To go from being a super fit Martial Artist and dance in high school to being an over-weight home maker will destroy anyones self esteem and the encouragment given in these work outs is what makes me WANT to do them everyday. They all have a realy great warm-up that builds in intensity to the actual work out. Then, towards the end, it gratually slows down into a good streach! This is a wonderful product for anyone, from those who need to start getting healthy to those who are already on the way to a healthy life style!

While surfing Amazon, I came across the Richard Simmons dvds and was surprised to learn it is the 20th anniversary of ""Sweatin to the Oldies"".  Thought ""why not"" and ordered them. What a pleasant surprise! I remember how much fun it was in the 80's but it's even more fun  now! I love the words of encouragement from Richard and --yes-you do sweat!

I am in pretty good shape currently and not overweight, but was looking to change up my routine with the Denise Austin DVDs I normally work out to.  The warm-ups on these are way too long, but again, would be good for someone who hasn't worked out in awhile. Once you've done the warm-up, the exercises really do get you ""sweatin.""  The music is great and Richard's energy is fantastic. I'll continue to work out to these once in awhile when I need a change.

I lucked out and found a set that was largely unused--only the first DVD had even been opened, and it hasn't been very used (guess the previous owner gave up or it just wasn't to his or her liking).  I, however, LOVE these, thus my purchase.  I have a rotator cuff and spinal injury (broken C5 vertabra) that can make certain moves agony, and I've been able to do all of these, even though the sustained over-the-head movements with weights in the second DVD make me want to shed real tears (my injured cuff just doesn't like that!!).  The first DVD is the shortest and easiest (at least for me), and the others are longer and more challenging, both in the difficulty of the moves and level of workout.  I'm not the most coordinated person, and I was able to catch on pretty quickly (Richard doesn't always warn you of upcoming moves, so mostly you're just learning as you go).  The second DVD is both an aerobic workout and toning workout.  They use small bottles of soda, but I just use small hand weights. For that one, you'll also need a chair for the warm-up and a mat for the floor work (although, in all honesty, I'm doing it on a carpeted floor and don't use a mat.",1522195200,,1281,4.357142857142857
