7905586,5,B000009O5A,"Good, obscure, female buddy cop movie with Nadeki Fujimi and To Gwai Fa with quite a few good looking fighting sequences. I own the vcd version which has about the same rez as vhs. BTW don't get caught up with any sellers' hype about mega-rare nonsense and insane prices.  Though out-of -print, a new sealed copy of the vcd sold for $18 on Amazon this May (2015). Be patient and keep a look-out.. Five stars as I am a  Nadeki Fujimi aficionado owning her entire filmography in one form or another. Nothing jaw-dropping happens in this low budget Taiwanese film that is indifferently scripted, shot and directed. The simple pleasures that this film, and others like it, provide will be spoiled by the realization that you paid far too much to see it if you let that happen.",1433462400,,772,4.586956521739131
