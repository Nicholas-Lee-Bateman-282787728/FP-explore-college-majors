8097058,1,B000CCD1WA,"Recently I watched 'The Choke' (or 'Axe' as it was called in the UK) and it was just one of those el cheapo DTV jobs that I was waiting for to finish. You don't see anything in the kills and then it cuts to someone lying on the ground with blood & makeup on them.

 It's built around a band who are playing their final gig at a club they then seemingly become the focus of a killer in this club which is an old meat packing factory. Pretty much one by one they get picked off in ho hum fashion by some killer only for the big reveal to be unsurprisingly a bit of a letdown.

 I won't say who the killer is as not to spoil it for anyone but I highly recommend avoiding 'Axe' aka 'The Choke' altogether in the first place.",1463702400,,720,3.9448275862068964
8097059,3,B000CCD1WA,"AN INTRIGUING PREMISE GETS HINDERED BY SLOW PACING, ANNOYING MUSIC, AND MEDIOCRE PERFORMANCES.
THE PLOT:  A ROCK BAND IS BEING PICKED OFF ONE BY ONE BY AN UNKNOWN KILLER.  THE SUSPECTS ARE MANY, THE IDENTITY IS A SURPRISE FOR A WHILE.  OTHER THAN ELLIOTT AND JONESY, THE REST OF THE CHARACTERS ARE UNLIKEABLE AND SHALLOW.  PRETTY BLOODY TOO.  NOT HORRIBLE BUT NOT OVERLY IMPRESSIVE.",1255392000,2,382,4.90625
8097060,3,B000CCD1WA,"It starts out kind of choppy, like a rock video with odd camera angles and shots. It makes it hard to decipher if there is someone watching, or just a fancy schmancy camera shot. But once that stops, the movie picks up pace. A few of the characters are annoying, and a few are really interesting. Nancy, the drummer, was annoying with his constant chatter about nothing. On the other hand, London, the goth bassist, was a riot with her dry, black humor. She reminds me alot of Linnea Quigley's character in Return Of The Living Dead.

Not really scary, but it does offer some creepy, desolate moments.

It's worth a rental or cheap purchase.",1180742400,3,641,4.565217391304348

8097062,5,B000CCD1WA,"The chicks in this movie are hot!  Wonder Russell is the quintessential girl-next-door and Brooke Bailey's death scene is strangly arrousing.  The film was shot in an empty warehouse in Spokane, Washington, and the creepiness of the building is apparent throughout the movie. Funny, hip, and definitly scary.",1140480000,4,308,5.395833333333333
