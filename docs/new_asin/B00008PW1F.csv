1857275,5,B00008PW1F,What I find interesting about Tony's character is that he has one foot in reality (his wife-and-children-family) and one in a world that we can only grasp through movies (thank God).  His ability to keep them separate amazes me.  His own family goes about like any other (remember Meadow getting upset when Tony might not be able to make her graduation--never mind that he had been cuffed and stuffed by the Feds.)  The only one-dimensional character is the son. His character is just space-filling and time-filling. Carmella is very complex and I admire her ability to not fade into the background.,1058227200,7,599,4.910891089108911
1857276,5,B00008PW1F,"I haven't given this 5 stars simply because it's The Soprano's and is my favourite TV series. Many people seem dissapointed with the pace and subject of this series,however i feel the slightly unorthadox pattern is both neccessary and refreshing.
As a Tv series the directors and writers have realised the need to change formula. The essential aspects are prominent, but the genre of TV as a continuation of story every week cannot reflect the ideal poignant nature of film, the very thing i love about Sopranos- not more but differently to The Godfather and Goodfellas, is the in depth nature, the total lack of grandure as oppose to film. You cannot continue to churn out the same aspect of the Gangsta tale, people will become bored, the same things can't happen week after week, series after series- (this isn't scooby doo).
I have found the change of direction fascinating, the Furio-Carmella storyline has added much needed depth and purpose to her charachter. We were drawn increasingly closer to her throughout series 3 and 4, and the triumph as she stands up to Tony as no other will brings him back down to earth and modernises the cliche tale into reality.
Christopher's drug habit was another important aspect of the series and the directors focus on outward degredation of the families through non-violent ways provides poignant dramatic irony propelling the absurd situation of the series.
Certain moments stick in my mind from series 4 including Carmella's not so subtle outrage over the interpretation of classic literature as homosexual. The killing of Ralph also sticks in my mind as a reminder of how we have become romanticised by a gangster, we love Tony and are drawn to his charachter, that which has been responsible for so many death's yet cries only at the death of pie-o-my.
I was however quickly bored of the Janice- Baccala plot, and pleasantly surprised by the development of Adrianna as acharachter in her own right, rather than Chris's tacky, shallow other half.
This is not my favourite season, yet is not far from it, and i can't wait to see what happens in season 5.
I know Tony and Carmella will reunite, yet i'd love to see Furio back and have a feeling we won't have seen the last of Dr Melfi, the Paulie story line is sure to prove equally interesting.
Long live Sopranos, but please give me enough time- the box sets are expensive!",1057276800,24,2371,4.785365853658536
1857277,5,B00008PW1F,THIS IS THE BEST SEASON EVER.  bUY IT AND WATCH IT TONS OF TIMES.  THIS IS THE BEST SHOW EVER.,1054080000,3,94,3.65
1857278,5,B00008PW1F,"I give this 5 stars because The Sopranos is my favorite show of all time. The 4th season was great, don't get me wrong, but a let down compared to the first 3 seasons. It went slow most of the time, and left a lot of things unsolved. What will happen to Johnny Sack and Paulie? I understand that they want you to stick around for next season to see what happens in the Soprano household, but couldn't they have at least given us the Johnny/Paulie verdict? Anyway, great show, but not as good as the previous 3 seasons.",1053388800,5,518,4.242424242424242
1857279,4,B00008PW1F,"This show has done none of things that TV shows normally do at this point.  ie. repeat itself, slip into formula, strain credibility (""jump the shark"" as the popular saying goes),  etc...  I really don't know how Creator David Chase & company keep it up?  Talent, creative freedom, and dedication, I suppose.
I didn't find this 4th season to be as emotionally devastating as the previous 3 (though it has its moments), but it is still very strong!  The acting is, amazingly, better than it's ever been, and several episodes rank among the best (""The Weight,"" ""Whoever Did This,"" ""Whitecaps"").  James Gandolfini gives Tony Soprano some his most compelling scenes yet, and in the x-tra long season finale, Edie Falco simply rises to new heights.  Joe Pantoliano as Ralph Cifaretto, who surprised everyone by surviving the 3rd season, is back & provides some welcome wicked humor & hidden depths.
The finale is very satisfying, but several very important plot lines are left unresolved.  We can only assume the 5th, and reportedly last, season will resolve them in some fashion.  Regardless, the twists and turns involving Ralphie's new race horse Pie O' My, Chris' decent into heroin addiction, Carmela's attraction to one of her husband's deadly henchmen, Johnny Sack's love for his very heavy wife, and Tony's sometimes impulsive womanizing all pay off in wonderful & unexpeted ways.
The 5th season is eagerly awaited, to be sure.  If it can match #4, it will be a strong finish indeed for this dark saga.",1053129600,41,1505,4.936507936507937
1857280,5,B00008PW1F,"Like the three seasons prior, Sopranos four scores very highly in every aspect. Initially I was slighly disappointed with the pace, constantly wondering where the story was leading and who would be at the inevitable victim in the finale (seeing as Ralphie met with his gruesome end half way through). This being said, the season leaves so many unanswered questions and far too many 'loose-ends' which I look forward to being answered in season 5.",1051142400,3,446,4.96
1857281,5,B00008PW1F,"I've already seen the first three series of the Sopranos on DVD, and I must admit: it's the best ever made about American organized crime. Not because there's a lot of violence, but because you get to know the characters better all the time. I can't wait till the 4th series becomes available on DVD.",1050624000,4,300,4.472727272727273
1857282,5,B00008PW1F,"A lot of these so called Sopranos fans have an IQ of 4 when it comes to realizing what happend over the 13 episodes of season 4.  For the first time in the series history we were left with a cliffhanger. If you notice in seasons 1,2,and 3 the story line for the season ended in the season finale. For season 4, Its going to carry over to next year.  Dont you people get it? Season 4 was a setup. If you think about it all that happend in the season finale has to be resolved next season. For example, Paulie has been ratting out to new york and will probably get whacked, Adriana has ratted out to the feds and will probably get whacked, and if Tony finds out who really set the fire at the stables thier going down too!!  And do you honestly belive that Tony and Carmela will get divorced? PLEASE!  The way Tony is, hes going to do everything humanly possible to make up with her, that should be cool to see. And with the news reports of Steve Buscemi and Robert Loggia joining the cast, I think alot of Sopranos fans will quit whining when they see how season 4 was a setup to what looks to be a bad-... season 5",1050537600,4,1114,4.0963302752293576

You don't watch tv to create your own ending you warch to see the whole story. David Chase is a horrible story teller. The show seemed like it was made up as it went, no structure to the show... Even if you liked the ending what about the other mob guys? Who took over the crew? What happened to Tonys wife and kids?  Way to many questions unanswered to be a good show to watch. They should put out a movie and tell it like Tony did get killed ( since he's dead in real life ) and who took over as boss and how it effect the relationship with the NY mod.",1481846400,,690,4.029197080291971

Backstabbing lying cheating thieves. That could be the name of any sequel to it. We will all watch it again because that's a good portion of our society these days. I see it in person with a very small handful of my customers. Cheating lying stealing then threaten with social media because anyone can say anything online with no recourse yet can potentially hurt a ligitimate business by lying online.
I'm not concerned about hurting business but the fact that these low lives are portrayed as some social media heroes that everyone loves goes hand in hand with the sopranos. Great entertainment of true scum!",1475798400,,778,4.857142857142857

The characters were miscast and not believable.  Tony looks like the kid everybody used to pick on after he reached adulthood.  Christopher would not strike fear into anyone who met him on the street. I don't want to get started on Junior.  Just a couple of examples.  In fact, Tony's whole crew looks really miscast.  There are exceptions that come to mind, Carmella (sp?) and Furio are the main ones.  On the positive side, the stories are consistently good.  You just have to get past the casting.  Another thing, that introduction is waaay too long and irritating.  You have to hit +10 seconds about 9 times to get past it.",1474588800,,787,4.51063829787234

1857916,3,B00008PW1F,"This season has succeeded at making me despise these type of people. And perhaps, that makes this show even better than it is. Not playing to our fantasies but playing according with reality. The industry is no longer glamorized. The characters are hardly worth watching. I don't care about any of them. Only reason I'm continuing is because I want Carmela and Furio to UNITE and because there is a bit of brilliance in the way the show dares to cultivate within the viewer a hate for its characters. Maybe it's better than I think. The dream sequences are keeping me coming back too. Just increased my rating from a 2 to a 3.
Okay, I'll keep watching. See you soon, season 5.",1472774400,,676,4.504065040650406

I love ""mob"" movies and shows so this is right up my ally. There is only one thing that I would have liked to be different and that is the way it jumps around so much, not all scenes lead into one another or even flow.

The ONLY THING I didn't like was the ending. The writer really had a big fat brain fart. How they could create great story lines consistently & then blow it @ the end was a big let down. It was like he couldn't figure out how to end it so he just threw up his hands & said I don't know what to do, so I won't do anything. This should go down as the biggest writing blunder in Hollywood history!

But watching the entire series for the second time, it's clear this is the greatest single creation for TV. In fact, with its realistic depiction of humanity, it couldn't be made today, with art strangled by political correctness.",1453507200,,410,4.871428571428571

1859463,5,B00008PW1F,"It's been a trip going back and watching these via Amazon Prime. The series definitely peaks half-way, with Season 5 being quite dull (the only interesting drama comes - finally - at the end of the season with the exposing of Adrianna), a strong string of final episodes in Season 6 - and of course the dopey fuzzy screen ending, which can be forgiven along with all the dream episodes over the seasons and all the malaprops - which are funny but too frequent, because nothing is perfect. The Sopranos is still my favorite all time show. It has a texture, a reality all of its own. Sure Game of Thrones has more spectacle and perhaps juicier conflict, but The Sopranos is about life in the present and it penetrates the modern psyche like no other drama. The stars are creator David Chase (Capo di tutti capi), Gandolfini (RIP), Edie Falco and the writers room that produced Seasons 3 and 4. Honorable mentions to the show's directors, casting directors,  Dominic Chianese, Aida Turturro, Joe Pantoliano (Ralph Cifaretto), David Proval (Richie Aprile), Alabama 3 for the opening theme song and of course HBO. 'Oz' got people to notice HBO and 'The Sopranos' took them into every household. Many of the same personnel went on the make Boardwalk Empire - which I intend to re-view next on Amazon Video.",1453507200,,1300,4.726872246696035

1859875,5,B00008PW1F,"I watched The Sopranos years ago when they were on HBO...and now I'm going through the series again with Amazon, on my time. I love it even more now. By the fourth season, which I've almost finished, the characters are so well drawn and complex that I feel like part of the ""family."" One thing I love about this series is the unvarnished truth about crime organizations: nothing gets in the way of the money. Period. Anyone who entertains romantic ideas about a life of crime should watch this series. The characters are uneducated...and don't care. They care about money-stealing it, anyway. Everyone wants their piece but no one is employed in the middle class, mainstream sense of the word. Tony Soprano's daughter, Meadow, is becoming an adult, and surprisingly, an educated woman who is taking on adult responsibilities with great success. She understands her father's business and is working to make her mark in a different world. Carmella is finally confronting her own guilt and realizing her relationship with Tony can never satisfy her as a person. The other players are going through the same kinds life crisis most people endure, but we don't usually get killed or imprisoned. The acting is outstanding, the characters believable and the events taken from any big city headline-making this an incredibly entertaining and informative show.",1445472000,2,1350,5.058295964125561

1860295,4,B00008PW1F,"While none of the seasons after Season One were as enormously complex as the first, Season Four comes close. It offers enough insight into the odd interpersonal relationships between Tony and his men and enough insight into the relationships within Tony's family. The interesting character study continues. Tony's fondness for a horse and his brutal impulses combine to give a deeper view into his character's psychological profile. As viewers, we realize that Tony has the same kind of feelings of fondness and attachment as anybody else. We also see that he has an out of the mainstream way of channeling those emotions because of his background. His relationship with his therapist takes a turn for the worst and that gives the viewer an even deeper understanding of this thuggish Mafia kingpin who is, at heart, a lot like you and me.",1437177600,,838,4.950354609929078

1860357,1,B00008PW1F,"Successful criminals are smart. There are a never ending amount of cops, they have the time, money and resources to put every dumb criminal in jail. When a cop shoots a bullet, that bullet is automatically replaced by the tax payer. When a cop makes an illegal ""mistake"", their legal defense is paid for by taxpayers. Or the settlement is paid by the taxpayer, and those settlements are written into the budget. And stereotype jokes are too easy because the audience knows the joke already. This show is making fun of how dumb the audience is.",1434672000,,543,4.666666666666667

The final episode's ending was disappointing on several levels. I can speculate the outcome but wish I could have seen the ending. The odd stranger goes into the men's room, Meadow rushes to join her family. The diner is not the place where the family usually eats. It reminds me of Uncle Junior's hang out.
Going to black screen is just too easy and not up to the standards the writers accustomed us to.

1860601,5,B00008PW1F,"Season 4 continues an amazing run of entertaining television.  While the themes of criminal activity begin to subside, the human elements of Carmela, Tony, Adriana and the other characters begin to take center stage.  The episodes slow down in the action, but become deeper, more brooding, and the psychological elements begin to enrich the show.  There is far less Meadow and AJ, and far more deep dives into the major characters - as well as some interesting twists along the way.  Not as suspenseful as earlier seasons, it is more thought provoking, dark and circumspect.  A great watch.",1428105600,3,590,4.979591836734694

As with all the best series, the story is character focused and, in this case, it is focused on family dynamics. - not just the immediate family but the extended one, including Tony Soprano's mafia ""family"".

My one complaint is the truly disturbing and recurring usage of vulgarity-laced expletives in taking the  Lord's name in vain, as in J-F-C.  This practice is unnecessary and sacrilegious.  Plenty of vulgarity to fill the hour, more violence than Vietnam, so why go the extra light-year and insult the Catholic God in an Italian Catholic culture?  Would the writers do the same with the Muslims?  Just once, let me hear Sil, Paulie, or Meadow unleash a ""fuc**** Muhammed.""",1418515200,,572,4.895833333333333

Therein lies the only rub I have wight this season. The Soprano kids age. The kids are now bratty teens and IMHO out of control.

1861500,2,B00008PW1F,"It's a good thing I'm NOT an intellectual; otherwise I probably wouldn't be this far into this ""dramatic"" tale.

As ""some sort"" of documentary on the alleged life of underworld figures, ""The Sopranos"" is an interesting character study, but that's also the problem: It IS only a view of CHARACTERS, though perhaps not the world as it is.  The curiosity of a new view into the waste management business with which I have been forced to interact from time to time is all that drew me to the series.  The real-world people where much more frightening.

I did not enter viewing the series with blind eyes and plugged ears; I knew it would be crude and lewd, but the lack of creativity plastered over by vulgarity and body parts still shocked me on a literary level.  If the purpose of the creators was to portray people in the mob as one-directional Cro Magnon creatures, then they have succeeded to the point of making these people unbelievable.  When compared to the real life Galantes and other Italian jobs I have known, these people on The Sopranos lack any of the touches of genius, elegance, style, and taste that made this class of Italians interesting, profitable to be around, good studies in anthropology and hard for the FBI to nail.  ""The Sopranos"" captures none of the Italian charm that such people can radiate when it suits them.  In general, the ""gangsters"" whose families I have known have been much more subtle in their revenge and cruelty than those depicted here.

Though likely to complete the series, I don't expect to find much of value or enlightenment in it.  I'd be easily satisfied with a plot outline to skip the generally subpar (while over-the-top) portrayals from the actors.  Only Carmella holds any interest to for me.  She's obviously the brightest light in the ensemble as a character, and it will be interesting to view how she plays her knowledge of ""the situation she is in"" to the final scene.  Dr. Melfi will succumb to Tony's entreaties (though God only knows why), and she will be tossed aside as T's constricting conflicts grow tighter.  Adriana is obviously bound to leave Chris, willingly or not, and the resolve of Chris' confidence in his pistols could provide interesting drama.  But will it?  Tony is more likely to self-destruct than to get caught red-handed (""with blood on his own hands""), and he is quickly running out of soldiers.  The New York families have plenty more where those already downed were hatched.

Rather than waste time on this series, I'd pick two or three books from the Amazon collection on the ""real deals"" than get involved in this series.  To know that, however, would have required eyes covering my six that I can't invent (or afford) in my actual life.

If the storylines and dialogs were more realistic, I might hear more lines like one spoken to me from a REAL gangster's son: ""Employees are like typewriters; when they wear out, we get a new one.""  And so it goes . . .",1413072000,,2946,4.681553398058252

1861683,4,B00008PW1F,I would give the season and the whole series five stars but the story lags in places so badly it's almost boring.  The can also be difficult to follow particularly when the director infuses the dream scenes which always go on too long.  James Gandofini carries the series.  The supporting actors are outstanding. If you are not faint of heart I recommend it.  Well worth the time.,1408060800,,380,4.626865671641791

Skip anything with Artie as the main character too, it is a complete waste of time.

I'll simply say it's absolutely one of the best TV shows ever produced, certainly in the 21st century - and it's a show that you should take time to watch, if you love great writing and acting. The fact that Amazon and HBO have made available the entirety of all 6 seasons to Prime members should not be missed.

I thought the acting was outstanding, I thought the Tony's daughter was the only weak character in the show - that being said. I Did not think she was bad, just weaker against a very strong cast.

I got my answer--the show is riveting, filled with extremely complex characters fleshed out with exciting and often profound story-lines.
There's humor, too,  both subtle and overt.  The writing,  direction and production, and the acting make this drama so consistently superb that I can't stop watching ...am down to the last episode in the series after just a week of viewing, whenever I get the chance.  I don't regret a minute I've spent with The Sopranos"". (If you have issues with violence, sexual situations and language, you'll find out soon enough .)

FYI, my tastes run to the current  ""Doc Martin"", ""Mad Men"" and many PBS Masterpiece Theatre an Mystery renderings, current and past.  A few favorites are the original ""Upstairs, Downstairs"", ""Inspector Morse"" and ""Last Tango in Halifax"". Also love the P.G. Wodehouse ''Jeeves & Wooster"" and the hilarious ""Blandings"".

1862036,4,B00008PW1F,"I just started watching The Sopranos over the holidays, and I just finished Season 4.  It's really hard to review this season, because there is just so much that goes on.  Some story lines were great, some not so much.  I felt like the drama INSIDE the Soprano household was forced.  It's like they through A.J. into scenes were he served no purpose but to give hateful looks and then leave the room.  Meadow's character is pretty much ignored throughout season 4 too.  I mean, there were a few episodes where A.J. and Meadow had a decent role in the story line, but for the overall plot of the entire season, their characters were pretty much useless.  In regards to Ralphie, he pretty much owned every episode of season 4.  I found it kinda strange how he was never in a single scene during seasons 1-3, but somehow for season 4 he shows up as one of Tony's main players, and eventually a captain.  This guy is an absolutely train wreck, but at the end of the season, you could actually feel for the guy....that is until Tony and Chris decide to put his head into a bowling bag.

Overall, I think the writers at this point were trying to make the show much deeper than they had to.  After three successful seasons, it's like they got together and said ""lets make season 4 weirder, slower, and darker"".  After watching seasons 1 - 4, I am putting Season 4 at the bottom of the list.  Not so much because it is a bad season, but because seasons 1 - 3 were just so damn amazing.",1389139200,,1477,4.327272727272727

1862101,4,B00008PW1F,"For me, Season 4 is most notable for Christopher's drugged-out squashing of Adriana's little dog, Cosette, which lead to a hilarious intervention scene, where Chris's family and friends, having been instructed to be supportive and non-judgmental, instead attacked him, both verbally and physically.  It's one of those ""you just have to see it"" moments.

Tensions between Ralph and Tony that began in Season 3 continue here, with even more dangerous undertones.  Meanwhile, Carmela begins to assert her independence in various ways.

Like the previous seasons, the writing and acting are exceptional.  Michael Imperioli, in particular, has done a great job of playing a violent, low-life.  He's making me hate him, which is a sign of his acting skill.  As blindly devoted to Christopher as Adriana is, she may feel she needs to take action to protect herself.",1354838400,,858,5.218978102189781

1862113,2,B00008PW1F,"Even though I am not a fan of mafia movies, I enjoyed the first two seasons of The Sopranos. For two years the show was smart, ironic, had great characters and moved along at a good pace. Interesting ideas were explored: the disillusionment of the descendants of Italian immigrants who go back to the ""old country"" only to find it's changed, the growing obsession of Dr. Melfi with ""bad boy"" Tony, the internal power struggles within the ""family."" Then some time during season 3 the writers began to lose their way. They killed off two great characters (Tony's mother and Richie) and basically neutered a third (Dr. Melfi). The problem was that the writers ran out of premise. ""Mob boss goes to see therapist"" can only be spun out for just so long. Then you have to think of something else, and turning the show into a soap opera simply didn't cut it. By season 4 there was nothing left of the original humor or intelligence. Dr. Melfi's perspective- which was so important as a counterpoint to Tony's - was absent, and the pace dragged horribly. Tony Soprano's kids continued to be brats, Tony continued to have ""issues with impulsivity,"" affairs continued to happen (although with fewer strippers), and people got shot. But there was no real reason to care, because there were no stakes. It's a shame, because this show did not have to fizzle. With a little long range plot and character development, it could have been great. But, by fourth season it was just going nowhere - sort of like Tony's therapy.",1342915200,,1507,4.690566037735849

I finished it in 2 days which is the fastest I've every finished any of the other seasons. I did see some reviews saying that this may be the worst season because of the lack of action but I totally disagree I think that this season took a darker turn,this season had a lot of deep meaning to it. And the fantastic storylines make up for the lack of action. I was really impressed with Audrina's storyline I'm glad we got to see more of her this season. I was always excited to see what was going to happen next with her character and between her and Christipher. This season a lot of secondary characters really branched out. One being Bobby we got to see more into his life and I can't really say much else without spoiling it but nevertheless I also enjoyed his storyline and his growing relationship with...well that would be spoiling it.

My issue is with the DVD's themselves. I had numerous problems with skipping, stopping and general bad play issue with this season of DVD's. After paying $50 for these I was not expecting this kind of quality. Of course we had been watching the series in sequence so by the time I found this it was too late to return it. I even checked to see it they  may be counterfeit but from all appearances they appear to be genuine. Was I the only one who had this issue?
In any case, starting season 5 now and they appear to at least work properly....",1217203200,4,707,4.198529411764706
1862130,5,B00008PW1F,"In the Sopranos Season 4, we see a bit of a shake up on many levels.  We see trust damaged, we see human frailty, we see what happens when someone hits their breaking point, we see some good things come to an end and a beginning for other things to come.  We see a series smack in the middle of their prime, and you wonder, where will it go from here?

Again, I have to say that it still surprises me that a show like this, can capture such a huge audience, even a fan like myself (who is not normally into this sort of thing).  But it shouldn't be shocking, not when you have such a large outstanding cast and creative and gifted writers like this show does.  And why is it so huge?  Because this show does what many can't- and that's to be about more than one or two central premises.  The Sopranos is about a lot of things, one of which is organized crime.  But even more it's about family, friendships, morals, inner turmoil.  I think it's the characters struggles that we relate to the most.  Well, but don't get me wrong, we all enjoy the excitement of the family business as well!  That's what we can't look away from, that's where we inhale a breath and hold it, wondering what's going to happen next.

Buy it, rent it, borrow it, whatever you have to do, just do it.  Get this show and watch it.  It's the best entertainment there is out there!",1215820800,,1353,4.214007782101167

1862143,3,B00008PW1F,"Upon the suggestion of my soon to be father-in-law, my  fiance  and I embarked upon the Odyssey that is The Sopranos. He loved it to such an extent that he began to emulate specific cultural traits of the characters. While my fiance  and I will incorporate certain ""catch phrases"" into our conversation we didn't take it that far.
At this point we're at the beginning of Season 5 but all the seasons' are starting to blend together. This may be high praise in the sense that the overarching storylines are so well entwined that seams are non existent or this may be damning in the sense that it's all the same and nothing stands out.
Whichever the case may be, this can be said; for these two viewers the series started off great, got better with season 2 when we admitted our commitment to it, stalled with season 3 or at least maintained itself but began to boor a bit with season 4. Of course, the outrageous highway robbing, price gouging cost of the later seasons jumping to $100.00 dollars a pop in stores has left a bad taste in my mouth just for the principle of the issue. Even Amazons discount, as good as it is, is still pricey for a series that boasts only 13 episodes per season, most of them under an hour. Don't even get me started on the price of the 6th season which has been divided into 2 boxed sets. The DVD distributors certainly took a page from the playbook of the characters being depicted in this series.",1194048000,3,1429,4.40530303030303
1862144,5,B00008PW1F,"Season Four was a turning point in the show for me.  I have always been in love with this show, from its conception even, but within the fourth season lies the root of my lust.  This season is, for me at least, the definition of perfect entertainment.  What this season does so magically is really flesh out Tony's home life, from his wife to his children, and delivers for us a brilliant scope into what makes this man who he is.  The season is filled to the brim with relationships, both business and personal, getting started and even coming to bitter ends.

With the start of the season we immediately realize that this is going to be one of those seasons to set things in motion, especially when concerning a certain young lady named Adriana.  Yes, the same Adriana who has played second fiddle to Christopher is now finally stepping out of her comfort zone and making herself heard.  In fact, I'm tempted to say that Drea de Matteo is probably the most impressive and valuable asset to the cast for both season four and season five.  Season four spends a lot of its time establishing a relationship between Adriana and the feds, beginning with her friendship with an undercover agent named Danielle that ends badly, ultimately resulting in Adriana being nearly forced to leak information to the cops.

Tony though, and his relationships inside and outside work, are the true focus of the season and any season for that matter.  A strain between Carmela and himself is established relatively quickly as she quarrels about their finances and establishing some sort of trust fund for her and children in case Tony were to die.  Finances are something Tony is becoming increasingly worried about with the slowing economy but he's reluctant to get involved in something he's not comfortable with, regardless of Carmela's feelings on the matter.  Carmela is not the only one giving Tony grief though.  Meadow is taking it upon herself to plan a trip to Europe against her parent's wishes, putting school on hold for a year to come into her own.  This season was a nice push for Jamie-Lynn Sigler.  She really took hold of Meadow and steered her in a great direction, acting wise.  It's funny how as each season progresses you want to just take both Meadow and Anthony Jr. aside and smack some sense into them, but it's the beauty within the acting that helps establish those feelings in the audience.

On the business side of things Tony continues to have to put up with certain someone's who only seem to bring him trouble.  For starters Paulie, in jail on a firearms charge, begins to stir things up from behind bars between Carmine and Ralph, thus causing major problems for Tony as he attempts to make things right.  Ralph never fails to get on everyone's bad side, from making comments about Carmine's wife to frustrating Tony, and he further twists the knife by starting a relationship with Tony's sister Janice despite being in a serious relationship with Rosalie Aprile.  Ralph is also seeing the beautiful Valentina who just happens to take a liking to Tony, and visa-versa.  Ralph also brings a beautiful horse, a race horse that Tony takes a liking to.  This horse is the eventual chink in the chain that is Tony and Ralph's relationship.

Tony's relationship with Artie is also tested when Artie borrows money for a deal that seems too good to be true.  When he's ultimately screwed out of the money he finds himself indebted to Tony and this causes a major rift in their friendship.

As Tony and Carmela drift apart Carmela finds herself infatuated with Furio.  As the season progresses their relationship becomes dangerous.  Furio finds himself falling in love with Carmela but realizes that being the bosses wife means she is off limits to him and this is further cemented when he visits his family back home in Italy.  As Tony contemplates what to do in regards to his wife's incessant nagging for some sort of financial stability he begins to integrate her cousin Brian into the business as he advises Tony of ways to increase his wallet size.

The acting this season is once again superb beyond words.  James Gandolfini is god in my book as he continues to outact and outshine just about any and every actor he comes in contact with.  His portrayal of Tony Soprano can stand its ground against some of the most legendary and highly lauded performances ever given.  Edie Falco also brings her A-Game to this season, as always, and this is proven with that final episode that brutally brings Carmela and Tony's relationship to a boiling point.  Those two Emmys were well, well deserved.  Aside from Drea and Michael Imperioli, who are brilliant, standouts include the always effortless Dominic Chianese who continues to mold Uncle Junior into an essential character.  Aida Turturro is just getting better and better as each season progresses and this is no exception.  Steve Schirripa also gets a boost towards the end of the season where he becomes more than just Junior's caretaker.  Tony Sirico and Vincent Curatola continue to ignite with their dynamic performances and newcomer Leslie Bega sizzles as Valentina, leaving a lasting impact on Tony as well as the audience.

In the end season four is far from a disappointment, in fact it is one of my favorite seasons for it does so well what this show is supposed to do.  It helps form ties to the cast of characters and further cements them into our hearts.  If I've said it once I've said it a thousand times...there is no show that can even compete in the same league as `The Sopranos' and I'm pretty certain there never will be.",1192579200,,5601,4.739938080495356

Every time I have a mini-marathon with popcorn, Pepsi, and one of the DVDs from the season sets, I see why America is hooked on David Chase's fabulous writing.  If you are a fan of Tony and crew, you need all the seasons on DVD at your fingertips to get your daily, weekly, or monthly fix.  Having the DVDs in my home makes the ending of the series easier to accept although I could have watched it for six more seasons.  I have to mention and give mega kudos to the fabulous music that the series used throughout its run.  Will America still be watching, discussing, and devoting websites to The Sopranos in fifty years as we do Gunsmoke, Star Trek, The Andy Griffith Show, I Love Lucy, etc?  Definitely!  The startling ending of the series guarantees that we'll still be arguing over whether or not Tony, Carmela, AJ and Meadow walked out of Holsten's alive.  Oh, and let's not forget Sil who we last saw fighting for his life in the hospital.  Oh, to have just one more episode...or two...or three.

1862149,5,B00008PW1F,"""The Sopranos"" earns its accolades in so many ways, but for me its best trait is its gift for risk-taking.  Too many beloved TV shows rely on the comfortable patterns of the past to maintain their popularity, and only when threatened with cancellation will they try to break out of their rut, and usually with less-than-stellar results.

""The Sopranos,"" on the other hand, has no ruts because it is always changing.  Characters are killed off with aplomb, other characters are the focus of an episode or two and then fade off into the margins for five or six weeks.  Nothing is safe, and no pattern exists that can't be broken.

The lodestone for Season Four remains Tony, that hulking brute of a teddy bear.  Tony continues to struggle with his bizarre duality - he is a nice guy, capable of tenderness and affection, and yet by his own omission is the scorpion who stings the frog.  The writers throw all kinds of curveballs at Tony this year, from new mistresses to Chris's drug addiction to a beloved racehorse to Tony's fatigue with Dr. Melfi's therapy to a face-off with Ralph to a face-off with Carmine and the New York families (and there's more).  Tony, who is no Superman, faces all of it head-on, with a twinkle in his eye and a murderous rage kept just under a boil.

Mercifully, the writers have given us a huge cast of supporting characters worthy of Tony, and many of their plights are just as dire as Tony's.  Adriana must juggle her devotion to Chris with the intrusion of the FBI into her life.  Furio has to cope with his unrequited love for Carmela (and vice versa).  Meadow struggles with the independence of college and finally seeing her parents as human beings rather than ATM/authority figures.  Paulie struggles with being passed over in favor for Chris, and Sil needs to show Tony that he's worthy of some respect, too.  And then there's poor Bobby Bacala, who loses his beloved wife only to find the ultimate, user, Janice, ready to sink her claws into him.

Wonderful acting and writing keeps ""The Sopranos"" at the highest level, and the domestic-oriented Season Four never flags even though the body count may not be as high as previous seasons.

You absolutely cannot dive into Season Four without knowing what came before.  So be patient, get Season One on DVD, and start watching.",1179705600,3,2313,4.685643564356436
1862150,5,B00008PW1F,"Wow, what woman's blood wasn't heated by the interactions, so subtle, so sweet, between Furio and Carmela?  Junior's trial was a much needed addition to the show--I was starting to wonder if the law enforcement was ever going to be shown to the natural conclusion.  I thought the Paulie in jail storyline came out of left field, but enjoyed the treatment of his time away.  Pie-O'my was a wonderful, creative addition to resolve the emnity between Tony and Ralphie (with a very well done, but graphic, conclusion).  The Artie storyline felt a little forced, but the Ginny Sacks joke was a lighthearted treatment of the tempers involved in the 'family.'  The final epidode, Whitecaps, was truly clever and funny--something many of us could relate too.  I still miss Furio, though.",1179187200,3,779,4.953846153846154

1862152,5,B00008PW1F,"One word:  ""Whitecaps"".  The season finale of Season 4 where Carmela and Tony open up and let all their hurt, pain, and anger out.  This one episode completely made the season for me.  Edie Falco's pain just leapt off screen.  I could feel her anger about being married to a man who slept around as much as Tony did.  I could feel her heart breaking as the marriage she committed to is revealed for the sham it really is.

Tony's anger surfaces when he repeated punches a wall inches from Camela's face.  His resignation about the marriage failing and watching him leave his home...wow.

Compelling TV.

After ""Whitecaps"", I forgot the majority of season 4.  Whitecaps, to me, is Season 4.  An amazing season finale.  Brilliant writing.  Off-the-charts acting by James G and Edie Falco.  They both won Emmys for their roles.",1175299200,,824,4.704225352112676
1862153,5,B00008PW1F,"Many people thought that the fourth season of The Sopranos was too much talking, not enough whacking. However that didn't stop this season from delivering masterpieces of confrontations and back stabbing. In this season Tony Soprano's relationship with his wife starts to take a turn for the worse, his business associates are starting to work behind his back, and then to top it all off someone may be talking to the feds...

This season comes with the usual 13 episodes, including:

For All Debts Public and Private: A slowing economy is affecting business, and the Sopranos are finding money a little tight nowadays, and Carmela [Tony's wife] is starting to worry about insurance issues. Adriana has made a new friend, who doesn't really get along with Adriana's fianc, Christopher. Meanwhile Paulie is behind bars on a gun rap, and he starts finding resentment toward Tony. And finally Christopher sets his sights on avenging an old murder.

No-Show: With Paulie behind bars, Christopher is put in charge of Paulie's turf. Meadow [Tony and Carmela's daughter] decides to take a year off from college to go to Europe, much to the objection of her parents. A construction site is starting to become a hotbed of criminal activity, and Tony has harsh words for his sister Janice's new relationship with Ralph, a made guy.

Christopher: Tony's uncle, Uncle Junior, is on trial for his life. Silvio and Furio intend to make sure a Native American protest does not stop the Columbus Day Parade as their pride sets in. Bobby Bacala suffers a loss that affects everyone in the family, especially Janice. Paulie starts talking to Johnny Sack, a New York crime boss, which includes several eyebrow raising topics. Tony also starts to wonder whether or not someone is talking too much.

The Weight: After someone makes a joke about Johnny Sack's wife at a dinner party, Johnny Sack goes on a rampage of words and threats. When the fighting of words and actions gets out of control, something must be done. Christopher and Silvio go on search for someone to take a hit, and it leads them to a group of men who seem past their prime, but are as deadly as ever. Carmela and Furio start a close relationship, and finally Meadow decides to volunteer to work at the South Bronx Law Center.

Pie Oh My: Tony starts taking an interest in a race horse that Ralph bought, and still has to deal with Carmela's insistence of investing in medical stocks. Adriana finds that the club Christopher gave her is now being used by Tony and his crew for ""business"" reasons. Meanwhile Uncle Junior is still in trial and now faces insult to injury when it comes to the court artist. Janice also reaches out to Junior's helper Bobby in his time of need.

Everybody Hurts: Artie, Tony's friend who owns a restaurant, finds that his new hostess is seductive enough to convince him to borrow money from Tony and give to her brother as a loan. However the brother can't pay the money back and now Artie is in debt to Tony. Christopher meanwhile has been given a lot more power in the family, but his drug addiction may get in the way of the responsibility he has to fulfill. Tony also hears news about his old mistress Gloria that sends him in a rage to Dr. Melfi.

Watching Too Much Television: Paulie finally gets out of jail and a party is held to welcome him back, however he still holds a couple of grudges, especially if it concerns his mother. Johnny Sack seems to be the only person who understands Paulie, so the two start talking. Carmela's cousin Brian, who is a financial advisor, tells Tony of a ""hypothetical"" housing scheme that would bring in a lot of money.

Mergers and Acquisitions: Tony has a lot more time on his hands now that he has Christopher running things for him. Ralph introduces Tony to his new girlfriend, Valentina, who is an art dealer. Paulie also gets his mom to go into the Green Grove nursing program, but is shocked when he sees how the other retirees treat his mom. Furio is in Italy and realizes a new revelation in his life and Carmela finds something really important in her own backyard...

Whoever Did This: Uncle Junior's case seems to be getting worse and worse, that is until an incident on the courtroom steps outside leads to an all new defense strategy. Meanwhile Ralph has some fun with Paulie's mother, and that only adds fuel to the fire that Paulie has been brewing for a while. However things take a turn for the worse for Ralph after his son is involved in an accident. [Really big twist in this episode!]

The Strong Silent Type: Tony and his crew are trying to find Ralph, who has mysteriously disappeared. Furio is back from Italy and is struggling to suppress his feelings for Carmela, who is struggling with feelings of her own. And finally Christopher's drug addiction is turning worse and worse, with Adrianna's pet dog the newest victim.

Calling All Cars: After a series of dreams follow Tony all through the night he now has to talk to Johnny Sack and another mob boss, Carmine, to contemplate the future of his new property business. Meanwhile Johnny Sack and Paulie are talking about Paulie's new loyalty to the New York crew. Janice is trying to move in on Bobby and his family, and AJ [Tony's son] gets on everyone's bad side after playing a mean trick on Bobby's kids. And finally Tony surprises Dr. Melfi after saying he doesn't want to be in therapy anymore.

Eloise: Tony continues to butt heads with Johnny Sack and Carmine who want in on the profit that Tony will get with his new housing scheme. Furio and Carmela continue their suppressed feelings relationship and Furio finds himself in the awkward position where he and Tony are out on the town with several ladies. Meanwhile everyone starts questioning Paulie's loyalty, but harsh reality hits Paulie when he gets to talk to Carmine. Meanwhile Carmela and Meadow start yet another argument.

Whitecaps: Tony buys a beachfront summer resort to calm down all the hassles in his family right now. It almost works until Carmela gets a call from someone in Tony's past that changes everything...Johnny Sack proposes a power play that relies on Tony's cooperation, and Tony needs Christopher now more than ever. The season also ends up in the air in a dramatic way as Tony deals with hassles in his family and his crew.

The fourth season of The Sopranos I thought was not a disappointment. The violence and killing is toned down a bit, but there are still twists in this season as well, especially in the ending. Plus James Gandolfini still does a wonderful job as Tony Soprano. The acting is superb, the drama is intense, and this is one season you should definitely get if you are a fan of The Sopranos...",1173916800,2,6698,4.678844519966015
1862154,4,B00008PW1F,"With season 4 the series starts to slide a little. I don't think the show is weaker,it's just that how long can you watch a story before it starts to seem like you been there done that already? Look, I love the Godfather one and two,but three is just not as good. The total time it takes to watch the first two Godfather films is a little over 5 hours! That won't even get you through season one of the Sopranos. I hope I speak for everyone out there when I say that as good as the Sopranos is, it will never come closed to the Godfather movies. So I guess it is just starting to get old. I will certainly be watching the finale episodes, I just hope it isn't too big a let down.

Where series 1 and 2 had an edgy Friday night tension to them, this perhaps picks up where series 3 was heading, into more lazy and rambling Sunday afternoon territory. Much of tension from series two, especially from Richie, seems to have evaporated, to be replaced by (OK, fair's fair quite bold) rambly discourses on topics such as race relations and sado-masochistic sex. Most of the running plot, of what there is, just doesn't seem to bite - will Furio hook up with Carmela, will Chris stop using the H?. will Ralph end up dead? Plus Tony is in a strange mood all series and makes a series of strange moves - would series two Tony ever have hooked up with Valencia La Paz after Ralph? - and the budding ""romance"" between Janice and Bobby Baccala had me reaching for the FF every time....",1160438400,2,904,4.386904761904762
1862158,1,B00008PW1F,"I want to preface this review by saying the first three seasons of The Sopranos were probably the most brilliant pop culture moments of the past decade, maybe ever. Everything from the acting to the writing to the direction were just beyond belief, and I don't say that lightly, being something of a snob. Even the most minor of characters had more depth, more edge, than just about any other characterthe history of television fiction. In fact, I cringe even calling The Sopranos ""television.""

HOWEVER!!!! what the H is this Season 4 crap? I just bought Season 4 on DVD and within about two episodes I was frantically clawing at the box, trying to figure out what writers changed, what director changed, what, in general, made this season seem like a completely inferior imitation of the Sopranos. To my amazement, most of the behind the scenes staff remained unchanged! WHO is this sensitive, touchy feely wimp masquerading as Tony Soprano? And why is Carmella staggering around like a zombie, with ZERO of her usual charm and intelligence and humor?  I could go on but it's not worth the effort.

I read a review on here that said The Sopranos was supposed to end after season 3, and lots of money got thrown at everybody to continue the series. Yeah--it shows. There is no chemistry, None, with any of these people. I plan on selling this boxed set ASAP. I couldn't even finish it.",1159660800,10,1386,4.695473251028806

1862160,5,B00008PW1F,"By the time ""The Sopranos"" entered its fourth season, it had solidified its standing as a ""weekly event"".  There aren't many television shows in the 50+ years of television history that can be put into this category.  A ""weekly event"" show basically has everyone talking about the episode the next day.  In the 1980s, shows such as ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"" were ""weekly events"".  In the 1990s, ""Seinfeld"" would take emerge as the show that would become a ""weekly event"".  As Seinfeld wound up, another show would soon take that title into the 21st century - that show being HBO's ""The Sopranos"".  The first two seasons of the show not only established a show of high entertainment value, but a show that also was of high quality.  While the third season of the show was still good, I felt it fell short when compared to the first two years.  However, on  ""The Sopranos - The Complete Fourth Season"", the show comes back with a vengeance  - having its most solid season both quality and entertainment-wise from start to finish.

The show focuses on an organized Italian-American crime family that is based in North Jersey.  The main character of the show is Tony Soprano played brilliantly by James Gandolfini.  Tony is the head of the fictional DiMeo crime family.  On the show, we see Tony try to balance his ""work"" in the DiMeo crime family with his home life.  Tony has suffered from panic attacks and depression and therefore sees a psychiatrist - Dr. Jennifer Melfi (played by Lorraine Bracco).

Previous seasons of the Sopranos have had slow starts and weak finales.  However Season 4 gets off to a very quick start and keeps you hooked throughout the year.  Season 4 does a great job in the finale at tying together many of the storylines that had been prevalent throughout the year.  Here are some of the key storylines from Season 4:

Here are some of the key storylines from Season 4

1-Friction begins to develop between the New Jersey DiMeo crime family and a New York crime family that the DiMeo's have been traditionally on good-terms with.  The show does a good job at building up the rivalry.

2-Tony is continuing to have extra-martial affairs and it will continue to bother Carmela Soprano (played by Edie Falco).  In the meantime, an attraction develops between Carmela and one of Tony's ""men"", Furio Giunta (played by Federico Castelluccio).  Overall, I was a little disappointed the way the attraction played out between Carmela and Furio, but I was pleased that Furio got an expanded role this year.

3-While solidifying himself as a part of Tony's ""inner circle"" of Made Men, Christopher Moltisanti (played by Michael Imperioli) is going to develop a very serious drug problem.

4-Christopher's fiance Adriana La Cerva (played by Drea De Matteo) is going to develop a friendship with a woman posing as an undercover FBI agent.  This is eventually going to cause major personal agony for Adriana.

5- Meadow Soprano (played by Jamie-Lynn Sigler)  is going to continue to be at College.  She is going to have to rebound from the death of Jackie Aprile, Jr. and eventually falls for a Dental Student.  Meanwhile, Anthony Soprano Jr. (played by Robert Iller) is going to start to see girlfriend of his own.

6- Joe Pantoliano continues his outstanding portrayal of Tony's ""Capo"" Ralph (Ralphie) Cifaretto.  Ralphie is going to start to see Janice Soprano (played by Aida Turturro) and begin to have some friction with the New York Crime family.  We get to see another side of Ralphie when he his son is injured.

7-Uncle Junior is going have a new health problem.  Most of his role during Season 4 is going to involve his long-awaited racketeering trial.

8-Dr. Melfi's role seems more insignificant than ever.  While Tony continues his therapy into Season 4, once again the opportunity to expand her character and integrate her into the show fails.

9-Investments are going to play a major theme during Season 4 for the the Soprano family.  Tony and Carmela are going to consider personal investments,  Tony's going to look at some business investments - and these are going to play a role in the friction with the New York Crime Family.

10-Paulie Walnuts (played by Tony Sirico) starts out slow as he is in jail and seen seldom in the early episodes of Seaon 4.  Paulie will surface, but won't quite have the high level of humor that he had during Seasons 1 to 3.  Much of Season 4 will focus on Paulie's continued friction with Tony and his relationship with the New York Crime Family.

11-Bobby ""Bacala"" (played by Steven R. Schrippa) is also going to have an expanded role.  Bobby is going to go through personal hard ache with his family and eventually get involved with Janice Soprano.

Here are some other points to consider from Season 4:

- As mentioned, the Season finale ranks among the show's best.  Gandolfini and Falco give awesome performances in that finale.

- The episode involving Christopher Columbus and whether he is a hero or not is one of the best.  It shows why this show is one of the most innovative ones on television.

- Next to the Finale and Columbus episode, the other episode that is ""can't miss"" is the episode in which Ralphie's son is injured.

- The music of the Sopranos continues to be a major part of the show.  This season is no exception as the music is terrific.

As for the DVD packaging - besides the usual extras, one thing I really liked was how there was a brief textual synopsis provided on the screen before playing the episode.  Overall, I do think this was the best season of the show to date. Clearly the show continues to maintain its status as a ""television event"".  This show is a must-see for Sopranos fans.  New fans will also enjoy it, but should see the first three seasons first.",1151712000,6,5759,4.706706706706707
1862161,5,B00008PW1F,"Whenever I get into watching the Sopranos, I find myself thinking about them all the time, as if their lives were more real and vivid than my own. It astonishes me that characters whose experience is so different from my own, basically violent ill-educated thugs and their dames, can be given such humanity. I think the fascination comes from the contrast between the criminal underside of the Soprano family and the comfortable domesticity of their life in the suburbs, where (for example, in this season) they confront such ordinary problems as their daughter's first apartment and the tiny rift caused by the sophistication of her Columbia education.

No episode exemplifies this dichotomy more than the shocking ninth episode ""Whoever Did This"" -- the episode that brings an end to the sordid career of the sociopathic Ralphie. I don't want to ruin this one for a viewer who has not watched the season, but suffice it to say that Tony's contradictions are here on full display; never is he more violent, or in a more sentimental cause. For sure, Tony is evil (Ralph's head in a bag proves it). But he's still human enough for us to believe that someone like Carmela and his children can legitimately love and care about him. What a trick these writers have!

The fourth season is my favorite because it is the season where this tension between domestic comfort and violence is the most dramatic, and not only in the ninth episode. This is really Tony's and Carmela's season, as the secrets deepen and  their lives begin to veer apart hopelessly, the season when the tension becomes too much until it erupts when Carmela confronts Tony with evidence of his infidelity. Edie Falco is unbelievably good in that scene in the final episode ""Whitecaps,"" and James Gandolfino ain't bad either.",1149206400,6,1790,4.862295081967213
1862162,5,B00008PW1F,"After the third season of ""The Sopranos"" finished airing in May 2001, the mob series went on a long hiatus for 16 months. Then the show returned to the air for its fourth season in September 2002. And the wait was worth it. Season four of ""The Sopranos"" was as effective as it's three previous seasons (though still not up there with the memorable first season). The acting, writing, and directing is still top-notch in season four. The show got 13 Emmy nominations for its fourth season. The strong acting by James Gandolfini and Edie Falco paid off again: both won their third Emmys for Best Actor and Actress in a Drama Series, and deservedly so (Gandolfini won previously for seasons two and three; Falco won previously for seasons one and three). This was thanks in part to the final episode of season four, titled ""Whitecaps"". This is the episode where Carmela decides that she's had enough of Tony's philandering and stands up to him by throwing him out of their house. Falco has done alot of great acting on ""The Sopranos"", but her performance in this episode is easily her best. Also winning an Emmy for season four was Joe Pantoliano, who won for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his chilling role as the psychopathic Ralph, and the writing team again was honored with an Emmy for the third time in the show's history. Other memorable storylines from season four include: Christopher fighting a massive drug addiction; Uncle Junior's trial; Carmela's major attraction to Tony's driver Furio (a character introduced back in season two); and Adriana finding out that her new friend actually works for the FBI. ""The Sopranos"" has never disappointed since it hit the airwaves in 1999, and season four continues to be proof of that.",1142467200,4,1748,4.791390728476821
1862163,5,B00008PW1F,"This is the best year I sow from Sopranos, it's gorgeous.

Recommended for all...",1142035200,,81,4.785714285714286
1862164,5,B00008PW1F,"Upon its original airing, the fourth season of The Sopranos provoked a vocal and hostile response from the show's fans.  Nothing happens, they would complain.  The episodes wander aimlessly from one to the next.  Plot lines are brought up and then dropped.  Nobody gets whacked.

Viewers watching during its original airing can be excused for so thinking.  Viewed one episode at a time, one week at a time, it was easy to feel dragged along.  It is no secret that The Sopranos wasn't built to last and was never really intended to go on past three seasons; once its original conceit was used up, David Chase and the writers needed to find a new direction.

As a result, Season Four has no overarching plot lines, such as Tony's rivalries with Junior or Ritchie, or clearly delineated character arcs like the downfall of Jackie Jr. or Tony's doomed relationship with Gloria.  Instead, much of the ""mafia"" story was dedicated to getting us better acquainted with the Soprano family's relationship with Johnny Sack, Carmine, and New York (storylines that pay off dividends in Season Five).  Moreover, from the very first episode, ""For All Debts Public and Private,"" Season Four has a sense of impending, post-9/11 dread; every week gave viewers the sense that something ""big"" was about to happen -- that Tony would discover Paulie ""talking out of school,"" that the Feds would put the screws into Adrianna, that Carmela would consummate her flirtations with Furio -- but it never did.  And when a major character did meet his untimely end, it came as an inevitability rather than a release.  The buildup of tension that was never released undoubtedly led to the frustration of many viewers.

Still, on a second viewing, with Season Five behind us and without the suspense of waiting to find out what happens next, Season Four plays remarkably well.  On DVD, unbound from the constraints serial-viewing and the weekly suspense of waiting for a new episode, the pace of the season improves dramatically, and the richness of each episode becomes apparent.  ""No Show"" contrasts Meadow's post-adolescent ennui with Christopher's ""learning curve"" as acting capo.  ""Everybody Hurts"" and ""Watching Too Much Television"" are two of the best self-contained episodes of the series.  In addition to genuine suspense, ""The Weight"" shows us Johnny Sack's genuine affection for his overweight wife, foreshadowing events between Tony and Carmela.  ""Eloise"" puts the finishing touches on the portrait of Carmela's bourgeois hell-of-her-own-creation touched on in ""Second Opinion"" and ""Amour Fou"" (both Season Three).  The finale, ""Whitecaps,"" plays out like a 75-minute version of Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage; it's the most brutal episode of the series (despite the fact that no regular character is expended), with Gandolfini and Falco giving two of the most devastating performances on television.  Even the season's one true clunker ""Christopher"" -- a misguided course in Identity Politics 101 -- plays much better when you're not expecting anything more.

In Season Four, we were still learning how to watch The Sopranos and learning the demands it places on the viewer.  Like life, it's messy.  Entropy and inertia triumph over the artifice of resolution and the fiction of ""closure.""  Conflicts are not resolved; they fester.  What seemed desperately important one day is crowded out by new pressures and priorities.  But this direction should be reason for celebration, not criticism.  If the series doesn't conform to audience expectations, aren't we the better for it?  In the 70s, they had a term for movies that didn't adopt standard notions of narrative form: they called them ""Art Films.""

In the final analysis, if Season Four does not live up to prior seasons, it is only because Seasons One, Two, and Three set the bar so high.  (Compare Season 4 and the comparable season of, say, ER and then get back to me.)  Rather than trying to carry on as a pale imitation of its predecessors, in Season Four the series evolves in a new direction, demanding more of the viewer, but proving why The Sopranos is the best show in the history of television.",1140998400,22,4142,5.047058823529412

1862170,2,B00008PW1F,"Seasons 1 & 2 were awesome, the episodes drew you in and seemed to fly by.  By season 4, the acting is still good, but the topics are uninteresting and there is very little action.  They even tease you a few times into expecting somebody will get ""clipped"", and then the hits are called off.  I think the show got so many awards they began to think they could pull off too many interesting character moments.  The writers need to get off their high horse and go back to what made the show so great. I never thought I would say this about The Soprano's: B-O-R-I-N-G!",1117238400,2,565,4.30188679245283
1862171,4,B00008PW1F,"There were great moments in the 4th Season, but I wasn't as caught up in the momentum of the storyline as I was the first three seasons.  The shift toward the domestic relationships was interesting, but domestic relationships are the part of the Sopranos' life we can relate too.

It's that THEIR relationships are connected to a dark, unpredictable underworld that makes it so different.

My favorite scene has to be Christopher's mob-styled ""intervention.""  The marital meltdown that climaxed the season was as raw and painful as watching a real husband and wife Armaggeddon (and I've seen a few in real life).  James Gandolfini and Edie Falco deservedly won Emmys just for those scenes alone.

As a lot of critics and people here have said, THE SOPRANOS on a slow day is still better than the best of any other television show.",1115164800,2,830,4.809859154929577
1862172,5,B00008PW1F,"Along with Sex And The City, the HBO original series The Sopranos took the world by storm in the late-1990s with its cutting edge drama and acerbic wit. A cross between The Godfather and the traditional nuclear sitcom family, the show provided a unique experience for a niche audience that quickly developed into a barrage of dedicated fans. Nominated for countless Emmy's, and winner of at least four in every one of its seasons except Season 2 (in which it carried home one), The Sopranos has cemented itself as one of the elite shows in television history...

Golden Globe performer James Gandolfini plays the title role of Tony Soprano, a middle-aged father of two, loving husband, and successful businessman. But contrary to a typical sitcom, Tony finds himself irritated by his kids Anthony and Meadow (Robert Iler and Jamie Lynn Sigler), he cheats on his wife Carmela (Edie Falco), and the business organization responsible for his success is the mafia (of which he is the local boss). All the confusion in Tony's life leads to massive amounts of stress, prompting him to regularly visit a therapist, Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) - one of the few outsiders he trusts. Following a classic prime time soap opera format, quite similar to the hit TV show Dallas, The Sopranos provides audiences with a glimpse into the life and times of a mafia boss, where we find out that being a mob kingpin isn't the glamour life often portrayed in the movies...

The Sopranos (Season 4) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""For All Debts Public and Private"" in which Tony and Carmela deal with the strain on their household finances in the midst of a recession, and Adrianna brings a friend of great interest to the Soprano family dinner. Meanwhile, Tony creates a special bond with Christopher when he gives his blessing for Christopher to avenge his father's murder... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""No Show"" in which Meadow has a fallout with Tony and Carmela when she decides to drop out of college and travel the European continent, and ""Pie-O-My"" in which Tony develops a deep interest in Ralphie's new race horse, prompting him to spend more time away from home than Carmela likes...

1862173,5,B00008PW1F,"Another great Soprano Season.  Christopher, artie (chef), and Gandolfini are extremely believeable.  Their acting is incredible. (Actually the entire cast has very good actors). Even that hit man for hire from Italy plays a very scary character. It's incredible how this show is always entertaining and never has a dull moment.  This show has great writing, great actors, great director.  Best show on TV.",1113004800,2,405,5.28125
1862174,5,B00008PW1F,"The 4th season of The Sopranos continues season 3's trend of focusing less on the running of the crime family and more on each character's personal struggles.  Some viewers may be disapointed with the lack of violence and the amount of time spent on Tony's sister and children, but on repeat viewings, this proves to be one of the most rewarding seasons yet.  Tony is always faced with tough situations, but for the first time on this show, his entire enterprise seems in danger of collapsing.  Paulie and even Silvio are dissatisfied and Tony's choice for an heir has some serious personal problems.  Season 4 isn't all drama though.  Arty's encounter with the french investor is both hilarious and sad, the revelations about Ralphie's personal life are humorous and oddly fitting and Chris's intervention is truly classic.  Also, ""Whoever Did This"" is may be the single greatest Sopranos episode of all time.  A few of the subplots don't really pay off (the ever-scheming, always-flaky Janice is less engaging this time out and the episode about AJ and his girlfriend just made me want to punch them both in the face) and Dr. Melfi unfortunately has less of a part in this season, but overall, Season 4 is another incredible outing from the best, smartest show on television.",1111190400,,1277,4.857142857142857
1862175,4,B00008PW1F,"Season 4 is a lightning rod for Sopranos criticism - certain plots go on too long and certain plots are so uninteresting, they're offensive (Paulie's mom at Green Grove anyone?).  Still, the masterful sleight of hand David Chase pulls on us is our complacency in thinking the show is all blood and bravado.  This is a show that recognizes the fullness of its characters' lives, the complexity and their consequences.  That means that some episodes that were trashed on the season's original airings are masterpieces of characterization, in their bold turns in the screenplay and their endlessly fearless performances.  I'm thinking not of Ralphy's surprise murder (a great turn, to be sure), but of Adriana's desperation after being tapped by the feds (""Pie-o-My""), Johnny Sack's arrogant but touching overreaction to the jokes against his wife (""The Weight""), or of the bizarre interation throughout the season of Bobby Baccala's grief and Janice's opportunism.  Each actor rises marvelously to their challenge without ever getting showy in their attempt, but for one actor, it'll go into some television record book eventually - Edie Falco's performance during the season is so overwhelmingly astonishing, you don't quite know what to do with it.  Fusing anger, loneliness, a desperation for intimacy, lust, jealousy, codependence, and a need for independence often all in the same glance, she goes further than any performance, female or male, in television history.  That makes even the weakest of the 4th season episodes compulsively watchable (as in ""Mergers and Acquisitions,"" for which her theft of Tony's money from the birdfeeder is the only interesting plotline).",1108684800,3,1674,5.342205323193916
1862176,5,B00008PW1F,"The Sopranos is one of the few shows that manages to consistently year after year provide excellent storyline, in-depth character development, and innovating twists (Ralphie's going down, season finale) on television. The casting on this show is perfect and everyone plays their part to perfection (especially Paulie and Silvio) and beautifully. I would not be surprised if The Sopranos, Gandolfini and Falco sweep the Emmy's every year. This season is just as intersting and well written as the previous seasons. Season 4 focuses more on Tony's family life and crisis and the business part takes a backseat, although still very much engaged in Season four. Not top of the line excellent compared to previous seasons but still far better then most television shows out there. I would not hesitate to recommend this season four. As many people have said, once you start watching, you will be hooked. If you have never watched this show, I recommend you buy season 4 or any other seasons when you are on vacation or something since you'll sit in front of the couch watching every single episode.",1100304000,4,1093,4.978142076502732
1862177,5,B00008PW1F,"I didn't understand what all the gangster excitement was about when the Sopranos first aired on a pay-for-view station.  I didn't want to watch the dregs of Hollywood with the good stuff.  I sought only good film.  A year later I rented Season 1 and caught up to the notion that mobsters in North Jersey could be just like you and me sort of.  Then I rented the subsequent seasons because as every soap opera fan wonders: what more could possibly happen to these crazy people?

My wife weighed in for the first time in Season 4.  When Tony wanted to sock Carmela, my gal screamed in anguish as though I had ever laid a hand on her.  Well, maybe in heated moments, I came close.  You see, it's all too real these Sopranos, but if an entertainment were much like average domestic life, it would fail to amuse or anguish.  No!  The reason the Sopranos is on a pinnacle as art, that has to do with the viewer's lack of integrity.  The average man's life is ground down by the rules of church, family, and government till he is hamburger.  Oh how to release ourselves from these earthly chains.

Tony Soprano may be a clinical case, but Machiavelli, stand aside.  He is wise in a crooked business and evaluates his workers like Sigmund Freud on steroids.  He has great sex with beautiful women; indeed his women are interesting beyond housewifely pipedreams.  (Don't the ladies want to be Tony's babes? Hey!) Oh to take all the money we ever wanted.  To beat the crap out of any offending waiter; oh the joy of it.  Take that you sleazy attorney, pow!  Cut his body up in the bathtub, Christopher, and put that hypodermic needle down.

The forth season does not disappoint.",1098057600,5,1668,4.496666666666667
1862178,5,B00008PW1F,"Above all other seasons, the forth in this groundbreaking series focuses on the complex enigma that is Tony Soprano. Creator David Chase allows Gandolfini's character to go places rarely reached in television or film. Traveling through these thirteen episodes with Tony, a viewer will get to experience utter joy, limitless rage, and the unequaled pain that accompanies an acknowledgment of personal culpability in creating one's troubles.
Tony comes to realize how others truly see him in the early episodes of Season Four. He laughs at his friend Artie and his cronious cohort Councilman Zellman when they nervously try to discuss different requests. He does not understand why they should be so afraid. But soon, he validates their concerns and sees the monster inside that drives away the closest people in his life.
His marriage is also falling apart, a plotline most associated with this season. Gandolfini and Falco provide career performances, particularly in the finale's blow-up scene. But Tony's most powerful moments concern two important losses in his life. Sudden news of the passing of an old acquaintance sends an unstable (and violent) Tony back to therapy and another tender relationship with an animal (remember the ducks) ends with Tony out looking for blood.
Chase loves to allow small incidental moments to provide the genesis for much of the show's conflict, a comment on the fragile nature of life. In the first season, the jokes about Junior's acquired ""taste"" of his girlfriend drive the wedge between he and Tony that causes many to get whacked. In this season, a throw-away line made about the weight of a tangential character builds and festers animosity all season. Plot built in such a masterful way is just another example of why The Sopranos is television's finest hour.",1089072000,4,1803,5.136054421768708
1862179,5,B00008PW1F,Frankly I think they need to make the sopranos a couple more seasons. This season is just as good as all the other ones except for the fact they they jump to conclusions. If you're looking buying this season then that probably means you've already seen the first 3. Anyone who needs to read weather the Sopranos are good from this point has something seriously wrong with them. Go ahead and finish it up already! Why would you stop now!,1088812800,2,436,4.4625
1862180,5,B00008PW1F,"I've always loved the Sopranos, mainly for its subtle humour and incredible writing and story plots. I always thought The Sopranos would make a good book, because it would sure to be a page turner. Season four is no different. We start the series revitalised and ready for any new troubles that may face Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini better than ever).
The economy is down and the mob business is slow. That can only mean one thing. All the guys are going to have to work twice as hard to make more money. As this happens on Tony's mob side of life, it becomes clear he's also facing troubles at home - amazing acting takes place between Edie Falco and James Gandolfini in the incredible final episode.
This is one of the best things ever to come off of TV, and each episode is almost like a mini movie, action - drama - twists and turns. The only problem is, you buy this DVD, you're guaranteed to call in sick for work the next morning to carry on watching.

Lately I have began watching the Soprano Series, currently on Season 3 but have been watching it quite quickly. The writing is brilliant, the acting is one of the best ever to be seen on TV. So convincing that it seems like you're right there watching the real people in action. All the actors in this show are extremely talented protraying the characters. I don't think anything can replace a series like this. Too bad HBO is not in Canada and Soprano's is no longer on Canadian Television, that I have to rely on DVDs.

1862183,5,B00008PW1F,"Season Four is as riveting and dramatic as the previous three.
I cheered when Ralph got ""what was coming"" to him. Can't wait for Janice to get hers. The characters only get fuller, richer, and more interesting. Carmella is simply brilliant - her frustration, sense of betrayal, and finally her courage are brilliantly acted and directed.
We've been touched by Tony's soft spot for animals (duscks, horses, and dogs) and appalled at his own brute beastiness when it come to people.
The other characters are also developed nicely: Bobby, Junior, Silvio, Adriana, A.J., and Paulie become fully three-dimensional in this series. Their quirkiness, frailties, and sensitivities are very funny and/or maddening.
The series continues to grow more involved, engaging and fun.",1082764800,9,766,5.338842975206612
1862184,1,B00008PW1F,"I finally managed to catch an episode of The Sopranos.  I was curious as to what all the hype was about.  I am truly disappointed.  This has to be the most overrated, boring, contrived and otherwise lackluster television program out there.  Americans need to wake up and break their addiction to television.  The Sopranos simply sums this up for me.  This show is just an excuse for Godfather fans to maintain their obsession with fake mobster families, rather like the West Wing is a fantasy show for depressed Clintonites.  Please waste your time doing something more constructive and entertaining.  Like scouring your colon.",1080259200,8,627,5.019417475728155
1862185,2,B00008PW1F,"In the fourth season, this show starts to get repetitive.  REALLY repetitive.  Every few episides a new family member will either turn and start working for the Feds, or will become disenchanted and threaten to betray Tony.  Tony can't control his temper.  Get it?  No?  Then, we will have to watch him lose his temper every few minutes to prove it.  Did I mention it gets repetitive?  Tony threatens his own marriage, which he clearly values, by cheating on his wife every chance he gets because he's self-destructive.  The same stupid neurotic type each time.  Because -- they're like his mother.  Get it?  No.  Then, we'll repeat it until you're sick of it.  Tony is a hypocrite, screwing a partner's girlfriend while beating another associate for dating one of Tony's old girlfriends -- even after Tony gives his blessing.  Because Tony can't control his temper.  It's been a few minutes since the last pathetic rage, we needed to be reminded.  Tony can't control his temper.  Remember?  Carmella, who I used to love, has become positively dippy and pathetic.  She's gone from silly little school girl crushes on the family priest, a wall-paper hanger and now the driver, Furio.  Christopher, whose heroin addiction was barely tolerable as a plot device, is now going into rehab -- because there might be one more laugh that hasn't been mined out of mob guys trying to do therapy.  Analyze This and That.  Tired.  This show was GREAT for three seasons.  Plots used to have a satisfying arc, but in the 4th season, they just start and stop.  They just repeat, repeat, repeat what worked in the first three seasons until you're sick of it.  If it is funny to see a Mob Guy get offended and exact bloody revenge because of some stupid little off-hand joke, why not repeat this plot device over and over?  They're supposed to be tough, but they're REALLY thin-skinned, get it?  No?  Then, we'll just keep repeating the gag until you do.  And Ralph is just Richie Aprile.  EVERYTHING repeats until you're sick of everybody.  Tony, after cheating on his wife with his partner's girlfriend, killing a guy, beating another for no good reason, sits in his psychiatrist's office and cries about how crappy the world has become.  All you can think is, ""really?  What about the pathetic dousche bag you have become?""

Update:  Luckily, the series found its balance, rediscovered its muse and got back on track in the final seasons, especially the last season, so don't let the annoying 4rth season cause you to stop watching -- it gets good again from season five to the incredible final season  and even with the missteps of season four, this is some of the best long narrative television ever made.",1080259200,16,2692,4.759219088937093
1862186,5,B00008PW1F,"I am not going to give an episode-by-episode retelling of the season. I will tell why this season is different and why it got some bad press. Everyone knows that The Sopranos broke all the rules and set the bar high for itself, for HBO, and for TV in general. The first three seasons were marked with intensity, vulgarity, and, most importantly, violence. Season 4 did have violence in it (perhaps one of the most violent episode, in fact) yet the intensity was one of a different kind. Remember that this was the first season to come out after the events of September 11th. This season is a progression into the lives of the Soprano family, and ultimately their subsequent crumbling. Season 4 is The Sopranos as family drama, a hat it wears well. Regardless of what popular opinion has said, there is no disputing that there are major rumblings in the fourth season; anyone interested in the series cannot ignore the fact that this season is pivotal in that it will help the show's momentum in its final years.",1078704000,7,1011,4.622222222222222
1862187,5,B00008PW1F,"Watching this series is a mysterious aphrodesiac.  Something about the power and the violence just somehow ... turns us on.  We seem to make it through one or two episodes, max, and then it's hot to it with the ""New Sex Now"" experience we learned from Clint Arthur's dvd of the same title.  Oh so la mia,...!",1078272000,2,308,4.368421052631579
1862188,4,B00008PW1F,"I found the fourth season to be at least as good as the third. The acting was excellent, particularly the last episode's marital bust-up:very realistically done by all.
I've read that the currently being-filmed fifth season might spill into a sixth: so many new characters are introduced. I look forward to seeing the fifth, but think I'll have to buy a DVD player to do so. I was able to see the previous seasons in VHS, but the fourth is probably the last such available.",1076284800,2,473,4.576470588235294
1862189,4,B00008PW1F,"In many ways, this is the most realistic show on TV I think.  The characters have foul mouths and poor morals, just like many people in New Jersey (sorry, but it's true.  I went there one time and you would not believe how people talk there, even the women.  Lots of loud arguments in public as well).  Also, I have seen a lot of movies about La Cosa Nostra (which means Mafia in Latin), and the way the characters act here running their various criminal enterprises is very realistic.  I would not be surprised to find out that some of the writers themselves were involved in organized crime as they seem to know a lot about the subject.  The guy who plays the uncle is good too.",1075939200,2,680,4.31496062992126

I think the brighest point of this season was Joey Pants. His portrayal of Ralphie Cifferrato was everyone's character we loved to hate. He was most deserving of the Supporting Actor and he will be missed, no one can forget the Bowling Bag scene. Then there is Big T, James Gandolfini what can I say he's untouchable. I look forward to another great season of The Sopranos this March.",1075680000,3,534,4.515463917525773
1862191,4,B00008PW1F,"If you are just getting into the Sopranos this might not be the season for you. I personally think it is the weakest of all the seasons but none the less it is good and there is great continuation of character development. In other words Start watching from season one.  This season isn't the most action orientated and that let alot of viewers down.  I for one don't need to see action every second, the Sopranos aren't that type of show, and the Sopranos always has delivers on all fours when it comes to plot and drama.  This season was more of a focus on the marriage of Tony and Carmella and as you see in the season finale ""White Caps"", everything comes to an end.  That episode is explosive (drama wise), and is one of the best Sopranos episodes.  It leaves the door wide open for Season Five, which debuts on HBO on March 7th.
This season focuses on developing the other characters on this show.  I mean Tony Soprano is cool, but this show would get very stale if it was all about him.  You see the rise of characters like Johnny Sack, Ralph Cifareto and Christopher Moltisanti as they rise to greater mafia power.  There is a very memorable fight scene in the episode, ""Who Ever Did This?"" with two ""made men"", and it is very graphic and gory.  This isn't a show for immature people, because last year some kids killed their mother in the same fashion from that famous scene.
Like I said earlier, this season did disapoint some and it did start to resemble a soap opera at times but don't let that sidetrack the truth of the Sopranos.  It is the best show on television and season four is a must buy for all Soprano fans.  Definetely check out this season and enjoy it because ""Nothing lasts forever"" and the Sopranos is a modern day classic.",1073606400,4,1751,4.390092879256966

If you notice in the music intro, the snipet in the montage of the World Trade Center buildings is now gone.  Out of respect for the people of what happened on Sept. 11, 2001.  A mention of the tragedy is made in the first episode of this season.  Tony is still wanting for his ducks to return.  Tony Soprano is still a bad son of a gun.  Abusive to his bartender for showing concern.  His wife is pressuring him for more money.  He then pressures his crime-organization for more money.  The thing is Tony has loads of cash hidden in a secret concrete safe near the main house.  His family doesn't even know about it.  He has a secret safe outside too.  Now the daughter has to see a psychiatrist.  The first Soprano trial begins after 16 years.  Disagreements get serious between the Italians and the Indians.  Tony Jr. becomes worse in behavior.  Tony Sr. gets involved in horse-racing wagering and of course more affairs with women.  Dirt hits the fan for Tony.  It's the wrath of Tony's wife.

They completely miss the whole point of the show and that is we are watching a show about a mobster and his family and friends.  Do you think in the real mob it is constant whackings and shootings, no they have real problems and real issues, hence Tony seeing Dr. Melfi.  That is the brilliance of the show we get to see the inner workings of the mob even if it be just sitting down for Sunday dinner.  The fourth season had some great performances and the setup for the next two season's is great. Especially with the future of Christopher and his rising stock that could be a disaster down the road.  A great season and I can't wait till season 5 I am sure it won't disappoint it hasn't yet for me.",1071360000,8,780,4.243243243243243
1862194,5,B00008PW1F,"While watching the fourth season of ""The Sopranos"" it occurred to me that one of the defining moments in the history of the series was when Dr. Malfi was attacked and we waited for her to break down and tell Tony so that her assailant would disappear.  But she refuses to do it, even though it would be so easy to do.  All throughout the fourth season of ""The Sopranos"" there are several things that we are convinced that are going to happen that do not happen.  Of course, the other broad clue that this was going to become a key element of the show was when Ralph made it all the way through the third season.  We should have known that his ticket getting punched was going to be a surprise, even if it was a long anticipated event.
The original tagline of the HBO series was that if one family did not get him, the other one would, and that is especially true in the fourth season, although in different ways from the first.  The bonds of fidelity are tested in these episodes as the decision to promote Ralph instead of whacking him creates cracks in the Soprano family that are exploited by both outsider and, rather surprisingly, insiders as well.  As Tony makes a concerted effort to bond with Christopher as his true blood heir, Christopher's relationship with Adriana is tested as well.  Meanwhile, with Meadow away at college and Anthony, Jr. off doing whatever, Carmella has a lot more time to think about things...and people, while Tony actually stops going to see his shrink (too soon, of course, as it turns out).
The open-ended format of ""The Sopranos"" is clearly the approach that the series is taking.  If you are expecting everything from the third season that you wanted to see wrapped up handled during this one, you are going to be disappointed.  One of the reasons this was such a strong season was that they kept throwing new items into the mix, and even with the bombshell dropped in the final episode you can really have no expectations for what will happen in the fifth season, set to premier Sunday, March 7th, 2004.  The fourth season was not particularly bloody, with only seven bodies, but a couple were fairly significant and there were also a couple of significant animals that you could add to the body count if you wanted to.  I have to admit that I did not think the show was that great when I finally got around to watching the first season (what series could actually meet such heightened expectations), but overall this is a superb series that manages to avoid expectations.",1070236800,6,2512,4.56

1862197,5,B00008PW1F,"Tony Soprano is almost a Shakespearean tragic hero.  His meteoric rise through the first season has been matched by a slow descent.  Through the fourth season, we continue to see this, as those who Tony relied upon (in business, or emotionally, or otherwise) fall away through death, or abandonment (by Tony or the other person).
  This DVD set contains the 13 episodes of the fourth season, together with commentary from writers, actors, and David Chase.  Unfortunately, only a few of the episodes have such commentary, and the choice of episodes is open to question (episode 4-11, with Tony's dreams, needs interpretation from an authoritative source).  The ""trailers"" at the beginning and end of each episode are also included (i.e., ""Previously on the Sopranos"", etc.)
  All of the regular actors shine, and the bit players are, as always, very well cast.
  The quality of most of the episodes is high, perhaps higher than any but the first season.  But as the number of planned seasons has gone from four, to five, and now to six, I wonder if the purity of David Chase's vision has not been invaded by fluff.  Well, we won't know until the series ends, I suppose.

James Gandolfini is at his usual brilliant best, as the episodes seem to be lurching towards some sort of cataclysmic resolution. But I need to talk about Edie Falco ( Carmela Soprano ). I don't want to give any of the plot away ( for those few of you who might have missed these programs on HBO ). However, I will say that Ms. Falco delivers what may  very well be the single most gut wrenching, stunning piece of acting that I have ever seen in any media. If for no other reason than Ms. Falco's astonishing work, this set is well worth purchasing.",1068940800,3,637,4.444444444444445
1862199,5,B00008PW1F,"Where the first season covered Tony's relationship with his mother and that relationship causing him to see a therapist; the second season went more along the lines of him as a brother; the third season was based on Tony and Carmela as parents and of course, this fourth season was highly focused on their marriage, all coming to an incredible head in the final episode.
I've heard several people say that the third and fourth seasons weren't as strong and as ""biting"" as the first two seasons, I couldn't disagree more.  This fourth season is an extremely intense season and is just as dramatically compelling and enthralling as the previous three.  Very few dramatic series can even compare to The Sopranos where it entertains on all levels, from gripping drama to dead pan humorous moments.
Combining the continued elements of extraordinary writing, superior direction and exceptional acting all make this fourth season another resounding success in the Sopranos series and a long wait until March of 2004 for the fifth season to kicks in.

1862200,5,B00008PW1F,"Riddled with subplots that explored loss and sudden tragedy, the just-out-on-DVD ""The Sopranos: Season Four"" appeared on HBO 16 long months after a hugely popular third season and almost immediately underwhelmed a lot of viewers.  Season four started out slow, and found its characters blanketed under a haze of post-9/11 anxiety, but finished as one of the better volumes in this vivid, violent soap opera about New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano and his strangely compelling families.
 And, anyway, the show's generally slow pace has always been one of the qualities that makes it so rich. Unlike most network programs, ""The Sopranos"" never seems to be in any hurry to reach a conclusion, the episodes play out like chapters of a novel, and when something big or dramatic happens, the twists are much more shocking and effective.
 Despite its sullen pace, and a not-too-convincing flirtation between Carmella and sensitive thug Furio, ""Season Four"" was still full of completely satisfying moments: the slow descent of Tony's sidekick Christopher into heroin addiction, and the hilarious intervention that helped pull him out of it; the sad demise of Tony's mistress Gloria, his racehorse Pie-O-My and his psychotic cohort Ralphie (who checked out in one of the series' best and grisliest episodes); and the raw season-capping split between Tony and Carmella.
 TV series on video are basically review-proof. Hardly anyone is going to buy or rent a series unless they know and like it. But in a steadily growing DVD market that's suddenly crammed with box-sets of TV shows barely worth remembering (much less shelling out 30-100 bucks for) it's good to see a show, like ""The Sopranos,"" that's actually worth preserving.",1068508800,,1717,5.16546762589928

There has been talk about this being the last of the ""The Sopranos"" Don't believe it. If they were going to pull the plug on the series, Uncle Junior would not have received a mis-trial.
They would have thrown the book at him. Also, Tony would have ended up on a slab in the morgue after his wife shot him (in self defense). And Chris would still be the tratment center -
Pauly would have been picked up on a murder rap for wasting the old lady, and the list goes on. We still have to find out how Tony will react to the change Pauly made of him in the painting with Pie-O-My.

1862203,4,B00008PW1F,"I did enjoy the fourth season of the Sopranos.  However, this season was very slow and boring at times.  Here are a few of my problems with this season:
1.  Very bad move killing off Ralphie.  Ralph Ciferatto is one of the most interesting characters on the show.  He has really been developed over the third and fourth season.  Joe Pantoliano plays him brilliantly.  You never know what to expect from Ralphie; charm, a sharp wit, an inappropriate insult, a strange sexual deviance, or completely crazy move of killing an innocent woman.  This is what makes him so interesting.  Getting rid of him robs the viewers of one of the best parts of the show.
2. Many story lines started, developed, then disappeared from the radar.  Meadow was about to go to Europe in defiance of her parents.  This story was building for a few episodes.  Then the writers just dropped it and she was back registering for classes. No transition or resolution.
3.  Along the disappearing stories, the biggest omission of all by the writers this season, had the best potential for greatness.  Remember that great episode in the third season when Paulie and Chris tried to kill the Russian in the woods?  He got away, although injured, and it was hinted that he stole their car.  What happened to this story?  Would have been great if he had resurfaced somewhere in the fourth season hell bent on revenge.  He was suppossed to be a commmando.  Great potential here missed.
4.  Which brings me to my last suggestion.  The season was boring at times because there was a lack of suspense and conflict. How about introducing a new character or two? Or maybe a war with another family?  Something to unite or divide the whole clan would have added more suspense and interest.",1067904000,20,1746,4.6743421052631575

1862206,5,B00008PW1F,"So many hidden clues were pointed out and mentioned in this finely written season of The Sopranos. This season was all about the relationships within families. It showed the beginning of what is going to be the end. The acting is so perfect, the actors and actresses really fit the glove of the characters. The Sopranos isn't just about organized crime, it's about modern families and how they stick together through thick and thin. When you watch The Sopranos, every sentence has a clue of what is to come. This would be my 2nd favorite season after the 2nd season. David Chase really stepped up to his word, and deserves credit, and so does the cast along the writers.
What makes this season so nicely arranged, is it left the viewers wondering of what is to come. So many problems are left unsolved. That is what The Sopranos are all about. You never really expect who's next to sleep with the fishes.
This season really brought up the images of the characters that were not really in the action last season. With Adriana being the rat, this season, really made the show more interesting, it kind of reminded me of those old days when Big Pussy was around. With Furio having feelings for Carmela, really polished the image of Sopranos. Junior got off the trial really hyped up the relationship between the family. Johnny Sack conspires to cap Carmine. So many things have left us wondering. Even if Tony does bad things in his life, he's still a family man. He loves his wife. The show lets the viewer realize that these
kinds of situations happen in real life.
If you're a Sopranos fanatic, you will find many clues this season. I would suggest every individual with a taste in organized crime to get this DVD. The Sopranos combine humor, romance, crime, and action into one.
This season gets 2 thumbs up!!!",1067299200,2,1811,4.627329192546584
1862207,1,B00008PW1F,"Here's your chance to own the Sopranos season especially made for YOU! Put down that triple-venti-extra-foam-nonfat-caramel-latte and fire up the minivan! This is the season where they tone down that pesky 'dark mob violence' and get to the point. Furio! Carmela! ooooh! Danger, but with sexy consequences!!!
Sure, you might get a nasty death or two, but this is what DVDs are for? Fast forwarding! Am I right?? And is there anything more RIVETING than scenes with Paulie and his Mom???? Priceless!
Here's to hoping that Tony discovers just how wrong he's been to the sassy new Carmela. She had NO idea he'd be a giant tapeworm and sleep with every drunk Russian or Italian chick on the Jersey shore. Let's hope Dr. Phil makes a special guest appearance in Season Five!!
To the rest of the loyal Sopranos viewers who funded HBO through the three great seasons before this: They don't charge for this swill on daytime TV. Save your $$.",1067212800,14,934,4.771604938271605

Sure, there wasn't as much whacking as there should of been but the storylines were great. This was also in my opinion the most shocking season by far. The fate of Ralph, the Carmela-Furio thing, and the Tony's estrangement from Carmela. This season was great, even if it wasn't as strong as the rest.",1067040000,,411,4.5675675675675675

of the ""Sopranos"", and I was shocked. I told all of my students

Because during one hour, the actors used the

injected heroine into their veins and murdered
an innocent police officer at his house.

1862213,5,B00008PW1F,"I view season four as wonderfully complex and entertaining, and in no way a let-down. The season finale, ""whitecaps"" made me feel unsettled and sick to my stomach. When any entertainment is this powerful it's great for we viewers, whether it generates positive or negative in us. ""Everybody lives in a two-story house"" and although Tony overtly wronged his spouse in their marriage, Carmela was not blameless. I've never seen a series this well-written; I'll view an episode for say, the third time, and realize everything ties into the main story, like great literature.",1065830400,2,571,5.085106382978723

""Whoever Did This"" is truly startling television with some psychological depth.  The season finale ""Whitecaps"" confounded viewers' expectations, but in retrospect is quite brilliant and powerful.
In between though, there's quite a bit of drift interspersed with interesting ideas.  The show lost some focus and vigor at this point.  Viewers did not get the same level of excellence which they had become accustomed to.
Still a fine show, but if you haven't been watching ""The Wire"", ""The Shield"", and ""Six Feet Under"" then you haven't been seeing the best shows on television for a while.",1065484800,4,746,5.132231404958677
1862215,4,B00008PW1F,I don't have anything to say about the set I just want to be heard about the fourth season. There was so much complaining done about it. I liked it alot actually and found that some of the most memorable things came out of it. I think this furthered the characters and plot line a great deal- to completion for some of them. I only had one gripe and I will not spoil it for anybody who is going to just watch the dvds and hasn't seen them on HBO Already. A certain character who I happen to be entertained very much by committed an act that I thought was even out of character and out of the question for his character who is a killer and a thief already. It bugged me alot. Yes I know Mr. Chase wants everybody to know for sure that even likeable mob characters are still bad mamma jammas despite the whole nobody is 100 percent bad or 100 percent good thing and what not. But still Mr. Chase what gives? Anyway like I said this season was great in my opinion and please don't be persuaded to not buy the fourth season just because some brainless pallisaggio didn't get enough whackings to satisfy his craving for meaningless plot twist deaths.,1065139200,,1145,4.28110599078341

The fourth season was indeed dull and I found myself waiting for Six feet under instead.

1862218,4,B00008PW1F,"I initially hadn't wanted to write a review, because I am too biased after reading all the others.  I would like to point out, however, that Edie Falco's performance was inferior to NONE! She will surely win the Emmy on Sunday for a third time.  Meadow's character as well as AJ's was stale and boring.  I loved when Adriana got busted by ""Danielle"" and was forced to turn into an informant, albeit an inept one.  Throwing up on the FBI was genius! Christopher becoming an interim Cappo while Paulie was in the can was nice, even though no one respected him.  I fear it will be the end for Paulie, though, if Johnny Sack turns on him.  What a shame Carmine has no idea who he is.  The actress who plays Johnny Sack's wife is horrible.  If not for his coaching during ""The Weight,"" she would have ruined a really fine scene.
Most of all, Janice ""massaging"" Ralphie's backside in bed was almost as hysterical as Christopher chopping off his head and not realizing the hair he grabbed for leverage was a rug.  ""You were so messed up, you wouldn't have known if your mother's muff was on his head.""  Forgive me if I misquoted!

1862219,5,B00008PW1F,"Many have refered to Season 4 as a set up but I saw it as a necessary decline of business, friends, associates and family all being brought down by the lifestyle they have chosen.  The Soprano's have enjoyed ""the good life"" for far to long in the wake of everyone else's suffering and piece by piece all the relationships surrounding Tony are disintigrating.  This season is finally beginning too show that greed, imorality, drug abuse, promicuity, stealing and murder will eventually take it's toll on everyone.
Carmella realizes she sold her chance at love and true intimacy for a life of financial comfort and the ability to ""buy things."" Adrianna lives in daily fear of being found out and unable to know which way to turn.  Tony's closet associates begin to fall by the way side, either figurtivly or literally, and he no longer can trust or enjoy the care free ""little boy"" life he has always lived.  It is becoming painfully clear that you cannot enjoy a life when you are unable to trust the people around you and the toll a life of secrecy can drain from your spirit.
In Season 4 everyone suffers and ""It is about time!""  From the capos to the Russian mistress and Ralpie's ""bowling"" trip, everyone begins to receive their come-up-ence!
What surprises me the most is in a world where no one is innocent I still find myself wishing someone would ""Whack Janice,"" who we've never seen comit a crime.  (ripping off the govenment doesn't count) This goes to show you when it come to entertainment, being annoying is far worse then being a murderer!",1062979200,7,1552,4.666666666666667
1862220,5,B00008PW1F,"While the death count has steadily decreased in subsequent seasons, The Sopranos is not going soft, but rather evolving.  In the first season, everything was put together.  In number two, an emphasis was placed on Tony's business: busting out, poker games, scams, power struggles, traders, etc.  In season 3, the series showed it is not prone to repetition.  Instead of Ralph becoming another Richie, his ability to make money kept him alive.
Now the fourth and still not the last season.  Seemingly every episode ended with an uncomfortable shot of Tony and Carmela alone together, but still apart: In bed with Carmela facing away, in the kitchen with Tony leaning on the couch, in the bathroom with Carmela in the tub.  And after all this, Tony bought ""Whitecaps"", his way of saying that he wanted to keep his family together forever.  But Carmela saw it as just ""a bigger version of a diamond ring.""  As Dean Martin sings at the end of the finale, ""It's because, my girl's right here.""
Then the demise of Ralph, foreshadowed when Jonny Sack comments ""I should have let Tony cut your head off last year.""  Ralph was kept around only because of money and when he hands Tony an envelope and says ""At least I'm good for something,"" Tony can't help but agree.  And when Ralph is being `silenced' by Tony in `Whoever Did This', Tony comments ""She was a beautiful creature, what did she ever do to you?"" It becomes hazy whether he is referring to Pie-O-My or Tracy when he sees her picture at the Bing. The ""thousand incidents with that guy"" finally catch up to Ralph.
By the end of the season, Tony has a business predicament that will likely be settled somehow in season 5.  Tony has conspired with Carmine to kill Jonny Sack, and negotiated with Jonny to kill Carmine.  It is unclear by season's end exactly who knows what and who is being set up.
The biggest gripes from viewers seemed to be the oddness of the Carmela / Furio and Janice / Bacala storylines.  I think more in depth viewing will help people to understand the subtleness of season 4.  And mind you a lot of season 4 storylines will likely carry over into 5.  The Sopranos is ongoing, and doesn't play by the national network `close all storylines in the finale and leave one cliffhanger' rule.
My biggest beef was HBO's ruining the finale with posting online that Uncle Junior's would get a mistrial and showing in the trailer a black SUV being shot into.  Of course when it aired and a black SUV pulled up, any element of shock was completely ruined.
Season 4 is very deep and intriguing, and has taken me dozens of viewings to understand underlying themes, and will take many more to grasp them all and catch all the jokes (like Tony feeling like the 'Reverend Rodney King Jr.') Hopefully the DVD and its audio commentary will help.  Like what was Tony's `Italian Immigrant' dream suppose to mean?",1062028800,72,2864,4.617357001972387

As for the fourth season it was, as one person said, all a setup.  That's the main problem and the fatal flaw of T.V. miniseries in general [the level to which the best written show since M*A*S*H has now declined].  Somewhere during the course of 13 episodes you need a payoff, not just a payday.
