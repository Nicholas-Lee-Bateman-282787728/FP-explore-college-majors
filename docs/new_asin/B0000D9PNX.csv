1922534,5,B0000D9PNX,"This film is another proof that confirms my view that some of the most vital films are made in South America right now. While American cinema caters to mindless escapism and self-help drama, films like ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"", ""Amores Perros"", and this magnificent film portray what's important and consequential about life.
""City of God"" tracks the lives of hoodlums in the ghettos near Rio de Janeiro for three decades. Rocket is the main narrator, a boy who tries to overcome his circumstances to become a photographer. The character work is excellent, and gangsters like Li'l Ze, Knockout Ned, and others come to vivid life. The world depicted in this film is a bleak one, and although violent, much of the violence seems a necessary commentary on what makes the people living in it act in such a way.
The camera work, and the narrative technique, one that loops backward and forward, is dazzling. This is surely one of the most aesthetically and visually strident films in recent years.
All in all, ""City of God"" deserves to win the Best Foreign Film Oscar this year. It's nothing short of brilliant.",1045612800,23,1101,4.8
1922535,5,B0000D9PNX,"It's worth it to check this movie out and see how difficult things are for some people. The story is awsome and shows a different reality that most of us live. Even being a Brazilian, but living in the USA, I got shocked with the violence shown at the movie and that made me think a lot about my own life! Check that out!",1045094400,4,321,4.03125
1922536,5,B0000D9PNX,"More than a regular movie, ""Cidade de Deus"" is an experiment in filmmaking. With only one or two exceptions, all the actors were residents of the Rio de Janeiro neighborhood of the same name of the movie. They were all exhaustingly auditioned and trained to participate on the movie with the best and greatest authenticity they could manage. That's what make ""Cidade de Deus"" so unique. It's an authentic movie, with an authentic story and authentic characters.
The story is about the people of ""Cidade de Deus"", a poor neighborhood built far from the ellegant and glamourous center of Rio de Janeiro of the sixties, built for and by poor families who were later to live there. Of course, during the next decades, The city of Rio de Janeiro englobed Cidade de Deus, and suddenly the poor families were not so far away from the rich zones of the town. Through the years, we follow the life story of some local kids, from utter poverty to immense richness from the traffic of narcotics. We also follow their own destruction in the form of war between rival traffic gangs.
Fernando Meirelles was able to transmit, in fast paced rhythms and camera movements, the struggle for power and freedom in the poor suburb. He was also able to mantain the local people-turned-actors authenticity and liberty of acting. There are some strong scenes that leave the spectator mesmerized by their violence and reality.
I just hope that the guy/team responsible for the subtitles in english, or in any other language, was someone with an enormous knowledge of portuguese, because the dialogue and constant use of slang (yours truly, a native brazilian, had some hard time in understanding the meaning of some words used in the dialogues) are, alone, amazing aspects of the movie.
One of the best enterteinment I ever had.

1922537,5,B0000D9PNX,"After you finish viewing `City of God' you are left wondering about the irony of the title. It is not long in the movie where you realize that the City of God is a place totally forgotten by everybody. Still, that is the name that the government of Brazil gave to the housing developments outside Rio, constructed in the early `60s to hold thousands of people. Those slums, known as ""the favelas"", eventually led to the isolation of poor people from the city center, becoming a place where music, life and colour can be sensed in the air, but at the same time the law is absent and the violent gangs rule the streets.
The story of `City of God' is based on a book written in a period of 9 years by Paolo Lins, a man who grew up in the favelas and managed to escape. In it, he describes his experiences regarding the creation and the rise of the gangs that control the drug dealing business.
Fernando Meirelles, who started as a director for TV commercials, transforms this complex and demanding material (the book includes more than 200 characters), into a breathtaking, terrifying film that is visually stunning (among others, it includes extensive use of hand-held cameras, flashbacks to introduce the different characters, fast cuts and distinct colours to distinguish the `60s from the `70s, where all the action takes place) and at the same time, shockingly violent: The rate of deaths is so high while the age of the victims so small. 7-year old boys look for guns before they are even able to go to school, and to make things even worse, use them against each other without any hesitation. The gangs provide them with status, power and recognition, replacing importance social structures such as the family.
`City of God' is a film that will blow your mind away; it will certainly trouble you and probably make you feel a bit ashamed and guilty about the things that actually happen around the world, without us doing or knowing anything about. It is certainly refreshing to see occasional moments of humour intervene with its otherwise grim and serious nature. In any case, it is one of the most powerful motion pictures of the current year.",1044144000,12,2149,4.6878306878306875
1922538,4,B0000D9PNX,"The key message of this movie is pretty plainly that violence begets violence, but the movie is so well done that at no point does it seem ""preachy,"" and in fact you could watch this movie and not even know it has a message deeper than ""look how bad these people have it.""
The cinematography is beautiful, the feel of the movie is fluid and alive.  The storyline is mostly good, although a couple times I found myself slightly confused by plot points - nothing major, just minor points, and more of a *feeling* than any actual identifiable mis-cues.  Perhaps a second viewing would iron those out, but since I hardly ever miss plotlines in movies, I feel it's worth mentioning.
The acting is a definite highlight - the actors all perform wonderfully, completely reinforcing the reality of the cinematography.
I recommend this movie to anyone who likes gritty urban dramas.  There is hope, dispair, love, heartbreak, honor, betrayal, growth and retrenchment, all in double-helpings.
I don't recommend this movie to anyone who can't handle watching a lot of hand-held shots, or to anyone who would be seriously disturbed by seeing children shooting each other.",1043625600,2,1158,4.9282051282051285
1922539,5,B0000D9PNX,"This film is breathtaking, yet it does get slow in a few places. Nevertheless, it is a film that is incredibly eye opening for this country of Brasil and its culture of violence in the favelas (slums).
It's also a gripping tale show casing one young boys desire to somehow get out of the madness, where if anything life is cheap. The fact that it is based on a true story (what parts those are, I am not certain) is even more chilling, particularly the end credits in which a real tv interview with a gang leader was taken word for word in the film.
Probably the greatest triumph of the film is its ability to show that violence is cyclical and that in a culture where only guns and death exists there is almost no escape no matter how moral you might be, or try to do what is right.
An amazing picture.

1922540,5,B0000D9PNX,I think this is one of the greatest cinematic films made in our time.  The cinematography in the film is amazing.  I saw this film while I was in Brazil on a college exchange program.  Throughout the film I didn't understand any of the dialogue but I was amazed by the cinematography.  Even without understanding the dialogue a person clearly understands the story line.  Since the movie is based on a real-life story it portrays an excellent view into the life of the dangerous slums of Rio. Throughout the film a person is taken on a great journey of what life is like in the slums and let me tell you it makes our gangster movies look like Walt-Disney!!!,1043107200,6,657,4.487394957983193
1922541,5,B0000D9PNX,"City of god surely one of the greatest most realistic gang films ever made. It makes films like boys in the hood (which I love) look like a school play.

During the film you find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat pleading for some fairy tail mercy which never really comes (thank god!).  An absolutely beautifully filmed film, supported by wonderful music and great plausible on screen relationships.

There a few elements of the City of God that stuck out to me in regards to adding to an enjoyable viewing experience.  The first is the introduction of a large cast of characters is done almost seamlessly, as well as the interweaving of characters lives in the telling of snapshots from their life stories.  Though initially it seems a little confusing to keep up with the characters of five different stories going on in the same film. Those characters appear in each of the additional stories enough where their traits become more identifiable to their corresponding character and through that, the characters become more recognizable and easier to recall as the film progresses.  The other element would be the color scheme of the movie, the scenes where the culture of the 1970's is show cased particularly stands of to me.  An example of that would be the dancing scenes Benny's going away party.  The bright colors, flashy lights, disco ball, and joyful care freeness of the party goers accentuates the peace and love 70's party feel of the scene.  Though the film is not in English, which may disinterest some viewers, I feel the film's dialogue being in Portuguese adds an extra element in the viewing experience.  That element helps in transporting you from your seat into the world of the City of God and helps you forget you are watching a film.  I would put City of God up in the ranks of other highly regarded crime based films like The Godfather, Goodfellas, and The Departed.  Fantastic film, would absolutely recommend watching it.",1508112000,,1568,4.8389513108614235

The rhythmic sounds of passionate and energetic Brazilian music playing as we follow the path of a fleeing chicken seem to almost mask the violence that plagues the slums of Brazil. Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lunds City of God (2002), or Cidade de Deus, gives a glimpse into the crime and drug filled slums of Rio de Janeiro during the 1960s-70s. The temporary suspension of present time took the viewer back several years to tell the story of the hoodlums of Cidade de Deus. This manipulation of time kept the viewer wanting to see more and awaiting the continuation of the story in the present. The film follows the tragic lives of the citys youthful thugs through the eyes of the aspiring photographer, Rocket. He witnessed the rise of a drug war as two dealers, one of which he knew since childhood, fight for power and dominance. The films strategic use of alternating lighting, unique camera angles, and quick camera movement capture the intensity of the film that keeps you captivated all throughout. The collection of close ups and brief parallel action create tension and suspense that leaves you waiting for the next gunshot. The plethora of guns in the hands of young killers allows the viewer to experience the brutality. The explicit showcasing of crime and death convey the cruelty that is typical in the streets of developing nations. LilZe is a depiction of how an innocent child exposed to a life of crime can turn into an ambitious, fearless, and blood-seeking drug lord. The filmmakers did an impressive job on character development allowing the audience to connect and even sympathize with the young criminals. It was clear that drug dealing was the only path to escape the poverty that enslaved the children. Their environment and pressure to entrench in a life of crime compelled the children to join for the sake of their own future. As Rocket would say, Honesty doesnt pay, sucker. Altogether, the complex characters, visual effects, and plot contribute to the great cinematography of City of God, making it a must see film.",1508112000,,2070,4.917142857142857

  In Meirelles' and Lund's film, City of God, the audience is immediately plunged in to the middle of an imminent firefight through identifying with the character Rocket; a good person who defies the norm in his society of gangs and drug trafficking. The film is set in a slum of Rio de Janeiro where murder, theft, and drug trafficking are common. The first scene is the beginning of the solution to the main conflict of the film. We are forced to take a journey into the past to learn how the main conflict came to be. Through doing this, the directer encaptures the audience's attention and allows theme to watch the characters of the film grow up and learn their stories. The best part of this film was the use of time distortion, and camera work. In the scene where Rocket is stuck in the face off between the police and the main drug lord Lil' Ze, the use of slow motion elicits suspense while the character is making a decision that if made wrong, will be the end of his life. The use of angles of the camera in teh film were of special note. High and and low angle shots were used frequently throughout the film. A low angle shot was used as we waited in a drug house for Lil' Ze to enter and take over. This shows him in a position of power. Lil' Ze is commonly shot from a low angle whenever he encounters the Runts or when he is on a murderous rampage. One rare occurrence where he is shot from a high angle is right before he is murdered. In this scene, the point of view is that of Rocket and his camera. We see Lil Ze betrayed and shot dead from this high angle. Rocket stands over his corpse to take a picture, which reduces him to nothingness. Overall, this film had a captivating plot line, skilled camera work, and a beautiful setting. It is definitely worthwhile to watch this film.",1508025600,,1824,4.343108504398827

When people hear the name Brazil, they usually think Rio de Janiero. With that name, words such as vacation, beaches, or carnival follow suit. However, in Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lunds City of God (2002), it is the exact opposite. Meirelles and Lund show the world the cold, hard, truth about the developing nation of Brazil and how it is ridden with gang warfare, poverty, and drug trafficking.
 Right from the start, the directors shoot the actors in mostly close-up shots. The goal here is to make the audience feel what the characters are feeling. They want to you to sense that tension and urgency that happens whenever they are in bout of trouble, or they just witnessed a murder. It keeps the audience at the edge of their seat. This is added by low-key lighting that is mostly used in the movie, especially after it fast-forwards a few years to a more developed Brazil. It makes the audience think: What is going to happen next?, Why is he hesitating?, thus making the darkness in the shots add a flare of mystery and suspicion.
 Although the main goal of Merielles and Lund was to bring awareness to the violence in the City of God, there are still contrasting moments of peace. For example, the character Benny is Lil Zes right hand man, yet he slowly comes to a realization that all this violence is wrong. He tries to persuade Ze that it should not be this way, but because of Zes desire of power, Benny gets shot in the cross fire of a hit-and-run mission. It symbolizes how there might never be peace in the City of God, which also provides a strong irony to the name of the city.
 Lastly, what hits home is the use of little kids in the movie as gangsters, especially with Lil Zes evolution, when he first started as Lil Dice. Most people who will be reading this critique are from well-off families with homes, a food supply, and a loving family. Although harsh and cringe-inducing, it was the brilliant, yet realistic, choice to show the child sectors of the gangs. It brings perspective: it shows how much poverty, suffering, and evil exists within that slum. Imagine living in an area where there is so much thirst for power, people would be willing to kill children in order to get what they want.
Often times the people who are able to watch these films tend to forget that there are countries that still go through this violence to this day. Meirelles and Lunds City of God is that beacon of hope that brings awareness so countries, like the United States, can help stop it.",1508025600,,2522,4.573008849557522

1922577,5,B0000D9PNX,"This movie will linger in your mind for weeks after viewing it.  It is raw, it is violent, it is emotional.

The lives of two boys are featured here, both from the same favela, both with many of the same friends.  They live in the slums were drugs, murder and police raids are daily events.  Even young children are swept into the violence.  It's how the 'hood survives.  Can making different choices in life really end with such drastic differences?

I thought at times the movie dragged too long, especially in the second half when it was more of the same heartless gundowns. The last 15 minutes, however, offer a bittersweet rap up of the two lives and the different paths that were chosen.  It's beautifullly directed and well acted.",1504396800,2,737,4.615384615384615

By utilizing the viewpoint of a young photographer (known as Rocket), this film immerses the audience within a story that needed to be told. Based on a true story, Rocket experiences how the early influence of robin hood-like gangsters caused the growth of dark lawlessness and corruption within this city in Brazil. Although his peers and older brother (Goose) surrender to criminal activity in order to survive, Rocket struggles to avoid these temptations of misdeed. It is the sociopath, Lil Ze, who leads the mayhem of murder and crime that takes place within this neighborhood. This film utilizes a wide variety of unique cinematographic techniques in order to convey the truth behind the activities of these gangsters.
Meirelles use of fast editing within the film helps to display the true nature of Rockets environment. From shot to shot, events happen in a fast-paced manner. Cutting to different depictions of violence within a small amount of time causes the audience to fully experience the chaotic environment. Life is hectic and stressful within these slums. Meirelles utilizes classical cutting in order to help the audience to understand this different way of living. In addition, music in this film acts in a similar manner. The fast rhythm suits the rapid depictions of action within the slums. The choice of music also acts to paint a picture of the Brazilian culture while providing the film with surge of energy to keep the audience on their feet.
  To add to the excitement of the film, Meirelles keeps the camera moving in an aesthetic manner. Reverse dolly shots were used to create an unsettling experience. In many cases, the gangsters were depicted in this manner as they ran towards the direction of the audience.  This brilliant technique allows the audience to view the environment or engagements in which the character is running from. Aerial shots helped to depict the run-down slums from afar which helped to set the environment quite quickly. Meirelles uses other techniques to draw in the attention of the audience. In one moment, the camera revolves around the main character displaying the environment that he is trapped within. This revolving movement transforms into a flashback to depict Rocket within a similar situation in his past.
 In the City of God, freeze frames cause the audience to delve into internal emotions or backstory of each character. First person narration supplements the action with information and insight. Meirelles transforms mise en scene in order to depict progression over time. In one scene, the evolution of a drug-dealers apartment is depicted. Overall, City of God is a brilliant depiction of how life works within the slums of Brazil. In addition, the plot line is one that is very intriguing and filled with action. This is definitely a story that needed to be heard.",1476748800,,3040,5.049800796812749
1922631,4,B0000D9PNX,"**SPOILERS AHEAD**

Fernando Meirelles film City of God, was an action packed story about a boy, named Rocket, who wanted to leave the slums and pursue a better life for himself. This movie is full of drug use, crime, and violent scenes, which takes place in Rio de Janeiro during the 1970s. We will take on this journey as young Rocket tells it.

  In this city were three boys known as The Tender Trio, who would kill and rob innocent people. One of these boys was Rockets older brother Goose. The biggest scene was a hotel robbing of many rich white people. One of the younger boys, Lil Dice, wanted to become a man like the three hoodlums and do as they did, whereas Rocket did not want any part of the violence. When Lil Dice was told that he could only be a look-out, that is when his character would change for the worse. Lil Dice fired a fake warning shot that would have the trio running. Once Lil Dice went inside the hotel to see on what he missed out on, he was blood thirsty and the first shot of the gun made him let out a chuckle.

  The way this film incorporates its camera angles and lighting was exceptional. It made me feel as if I was apart of the story and was there to witness the events. In the hotel scene the camera was never too close and it gave distance to think we were watching it from afar. The low lighting set the eerie mood of the blood lust from Lil Dice. Lil Dice had just started his blood lust and he would be accompanied by his best friend Benny. Benny and him were big heads in the city during their teen years and Lil Dice wanted on a complete takeover of the city. He started taking down local drug dealers and making them his operations. With the mad power Lil Dice had, he ended up changing his name to Lil Ze.

  Towards the end of the movie Benny found a girlfriend and wanted to live a different life then the violence in the slums. So they threw him a going away party to only find out that his character would be killed off because he was in the way of the actual target, Lil Ze. This angered Lil Ze and it was war. More and more guns were being passed around to small children and they were told that nothing could be done in the slums for their own pleasure. The cops were being paid off by Lil Ze and Rocket would capture it all on his camera. The ending scene would show both major gang leaders at the end with guns and Rocket standing in the middle. Rocket took cover and snapped pictures of the action that was happening in the slums. Lil Ze would be betrayed and killed by the young rebel kids he gave to them. Overall, the end of this film would make us believe Rocket would live a way more successful life being a photographer and out of the slums.",1476662400,,2707,4.178502879078695
1922632,5,B0000D9PNX,"City of God (2002), directed by Fernando Meirelles, is an intense portrayal of life in the notorious favela (ghetto) of Rio de Janeiro, the City of God. The film revolves around several characters and the film moves around to follow different characters and show their stories. The movie utilizes different film elements throughout the film in order to create feeling and connect with the audience and intensify the film.

In the beginning of the film, the coloring is warm, and the camera is free moving. It allows the audience to be relaxed and connect with each of the characters and creates a base for the rest of the film. In the middle of the film, the colors are cooler and gray, the camera is more static and focuses close up to the characters. This gives the film a claustrophobic feeling as the characters are living in the favela. It with the coloring and camera techniques the film gains an emotional context to judge the characters and their actions outside of their physical actions. At the end of the film, the coloring is still the same but the camera switches to follow one of the main characters and has more of a POV feel. This allows the audience to connect with him, and the actions in the movie seem more real and believable.

With the use of editing, it made for a short movie with a tremendous amount of detail without condensing the timeline of the film. Overall the directors good an extraordinary job of creating a movie, with an intense subject matter of this film, that connects with the audience on an emotional and physical level.",1476662400,,1561,4.6521739130434785
1922633,5,B0000D9PNX,"City of God is a much watch for anyone who loves a good crime/gangster genre of film, but also for those searching for viewing visual excellence. The cinematography in City of God is some of the best work I have seen, as the screen is exploding with violence, color, action, and emotion all at the same time. The majority of the story line is seen through a handheld camera, causing the viewer to be injected into the middle of the story as if they were there seeing the beautiful colors of Brazilian beaches or walking through the dark slum, really putting the viewer on the edge of their seat. The combination of the natural lighting and types of shots really transform the feel of this movie into a documentary that was filmed by the viewers own eyes, as we see shadows signifying conflict through canted angles and obstructed framing, all adding to the chaos within the cramped slum. Topping this off with the high intensity chase/fight scenes is what really puts City of God above and beyond. They are comprised of extremely quick shots and utilize aerial establishing shots, close ups, shaky over-the-shoulder 3rd person, and many more. The grand variety of views surrounding a single scene (or string of scenes) really allow the viewer to pick up incredible amounts of details within a significantly short period of time and leave the viewer with no other option but to get even more entranced in the violence (and piece together key character emotions and attributes), taking the realism of this film to a whole new level. Overall, ""City of God"" is an amazing story presented in a magnificent way.",1476662400,,1605,4.776978417266187
1922634,5,B0000D9PNX,"The City of God is in turmoil. Children are running wild and savage through the streets. Shops, stores, and homes are being taken over by gang members and rivals. Events such as death and murder are beginning to seem like a normal activity for the citizens in the City of God. Human instinct is damaged and the reaction to killing with no purpose is destroyed. What happens to a society that loses the empathy associated with death? Or the moral values for the appreciation of ones life and the lives of others?

Through various cinematic techniques, such as lighting, sound, and editing, Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund place the viewer in a horrified state of mind. The use of these cinematic techniques, clearly portrays that morality is held at a high regard and questioned throughout the film. The lighting used throughout the film creates a feeling of realistic events. The music and sounds assist the viewer in foreshadowing as the intensity builds. Emotional connections between the viewers and actors are encouraged through the edited scenes the characters take action in. The City of God, narrated through Rockets perspective, played by Alexandre Rodrigues, developed an outlook of the slums through a young mans life. Although this limited the film itself and the viewers ability to relate, one narrator developed a specific focal point for the film. The City of God delivers a strong message of morality through an outside worlds reality that is not comprehensible to a large portion of the films audience.",1476662400,,1520,5.031746031746032
1922635,5,B0000D9PNX,"As people living in the United States we look at the people of Brazil thinking that they party nonstop while we work to stay afloat. City of Gods shows us what the real life of the people living in the slums of Brazil is like through the 60s, 70s and 80s. The view we get to see is very up close and personal. From a young age these kids lives are ruined because they never really get a chance to have a childhood they are immediately surrounded by guns, drugs, and violence.  The story is narrated by a buy named Rocket who wants nothing to do with all the violence that goes on around him. Watching the movie from his point of view made it very interesting to see how someone on the other side of the violence reacted and how he learned how to cope with his surroundings.
As the movie starts you see the kids playing soccer in the slum, then a minute later, a boy pulls out a gun and shoots the soccer ball just to show off that he was carrying a gun. Very quick change of pace and it had me tore between wanting to be very interested but also very confused.  From that moment on it is very intense. You don't expect something of that nature to come into the movie when you think you're just watching some kids play soccer. Over the course of the movie the violence worsens because of drugs and gang related activities. It really hits home hard when you see children being shot because they were in the wrong place at the right time but according to the movie thats just life. The suspense doesnt stop there and continues with gang wars and firefights all over the favelas seeing people die left and right. The editing in this film is very shaky and makes it feel like you are right beside Rocket while hes living this life.  The actors were all no name people, did an unreal job during this film to make it stand out and be one of a kind.",1476576000,,1841,4.209631728045326
1922636,5,B0000D9PNX,"Spoiler alert
--------------------
The City of God was a pretty heavy movie. It draws you in with the realism of the plot. Realizing the whole movie was based on a true story shocks you at the end because of how nicely the directors, Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund, portray this heart wrenching film of the drug lords in poverty-stricken Rio de Janerio. The shots of the actors were tastefully mixed up from extreme longshots to capture the harsh living conditions to close ups to allow the audience to better see the emotions of the actors. You are left feeling almost as though you are in the scene with the camera being handheld. The action scenes are intense, especially when there is low lighting for the night scenes. The main source of lighting comes from the side and creates ominous looking actors.
When Lil Ze first discovers his love for killing, the camera angle is a low angle to show his growing power and predict his authority in the City of God. The sound of the gun shooting and the flashing light shows the hectic mindset he has to be in to be committing all of these murders and crime.
Overall, this was hard to watch for me only because of how harsh the world is. The directors, actors, and everyone who contributed did an excellent job showing how it was to live in a poverty-stricken town with nonstop violence, drugs, and gangs. This movie is an eye opener of how imperfect some cities are and is not easy to watch.",1476576000,,1441,4.546153846153846
1922637,5,B0000D9PNX,"City of God directed by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund was an great film. It shows the story of how people are forced to live in when poverty, gangs, poor economy, and lack of an education affect a town or village. Crime spawns when these issues thrive and that is shown to be true in the Brazilian slums that the film portrays being plagued with these issues.

The cinematography of the film only helped to display what the directors wanted and the elements used helped to tell the story better. some of the camera shots made you fell part of the story. For example, when there would be chaos in the scene the camera would be tracking the action and sometimes use a handheld shot to bring instability to what is going on. The film makers would also use that to portray the structure and the organization of the gangs themselves. The organization of the plot with the film giving you a taste of the end with part of the solution to the ending conflict leaves the viewer wanting more to see how the characters got themselves in that situation. The narration of the main character make you connect with him and want to hear out the rest of his story.

All in all I personally loved the movie. I thought that the message being shown was saddening that it is happening in our world and heartbreaking that we haven't found a solution for these issues and problems. I feel the film maker didn't hold back in shooting any scenes, it almost got to the point where some parts of the film were hard to watch because what was being shown was against my morals as a human being.",1476576000,,1569,4.42560553633218
1922638,5,B0000D9PNX,"Directed by Fernando Meirelles and Ktia Lund, City of God (2002) is a formalist film that explores the binary between power and peace through outstanding cinematography. The film takes place in Rio de Janeiro during the 1970s where our narrator, Rocket, walks us through the story of a poverty-stricken town thats ruled by superfluous amounts of gun violence.

Many of the scenes are shot in high contrast lighting with subtle tints of gold resembling a photograph from the 70s which catapults the viewer into this era. This tinting also connotes gold as the characters thirst for riches and powerthe two ultimate drives for everyone in the film. In many scenes, the dominant contrast is a handgun in a given characters hand; the camera is always emphasizing guns as they are the key to money, power and the root of all evil in the film. Gun violence is the focal point of the film because every character desires power (probably even more so than money) and the only way they know how to attain it is to ruthlessly kill. The main hood in the film is Lil Ze who has been terrorizing since he was a little kid to get his way in terms of drug territory and also in terms of his demeanor. Almost every character to an extent is a terrorist because even the good guys end up using murder as an excuse to avenge their loved ones deaths.

Contrary to the other characters, Rockets weapon of choice is not a gun, but a camera. An aspiring photojournalist, Rocket captures images of Lil Zes terrorism firsthand causing some scenes to appear in fast-stock as they mimic Rockets photo-taking. Rendering scenes to look raw and documentary-like reminds us that this film is based on real events which illustrates human beings susceptibility to war as the Vietnam War was happening simultaneously during the time of the film.

While the gangsters in Rio were gun-happy, the hippie movement was happening in America during this time period. Some aspects of this peace movement were present in the film as gangster-gone-good Benny says, Were really hippies at heart, aren't we? However, City of God examines how power and peace cannot coexist. With constant low-angle shots of power-hungry gangsters and slow-motion scenes of murder, the film is a warning of human natures inclination to power and just how much power can destroy peace and, with time, civilization itself.",1476316800,,2357,4.843672456575683

Now that I don't remember the detail, I wanted to see it again,so  last night, I saw it again.
I don't know why people really love this film.
First of all, voice of narration really disturbed me.
Without it, I cannot even follow the story.
Sometimes, like the movie Good Fellas, V.O.N works really good, but this time it didn't.
Next, the camera work. The hand held seems very annoying.
The director wanted to shake it to look like documentary style or because it was a low budget film, but I just didn't liked it.
The lightening was wonderful.
And the editing is also good.
And the ending seems decent.
But above all, I gained nothing after the film.
I remember no one's face.

Is this suppose to be a good film?",1449532800,,769,4.303448275862069
1922696,4,B0000D9PNX,"You can't fail to admire the sheer panache of the film-making here, and the control of a number of narrative strands, moving back and forth over time, is managed with absolute clarity, owing to the deft use of voice-over linking narration by ""Rocket,"" the young man who becomes a journalistic photographer rather than a gang member because he has a sharp eye and no appetite for violence. On the other hand, though, this is a film about violence -- about a gang war for control of the drug business in the Rio de Janiero slum that gives the movie its title -- and, more troublingly, about the corruption of children in an environment where the order of life is controlled by lawless people. The narrator doesn't preach about that -- he just moves the story along -- and the success of the movie is that our appreciation of the sheer artistic boldness of the film-making doesn't get in the way of our horror at the situation. The film is anything but a mess -- at times, it's more like a dance -- but the chaos and damage of life in the slum don't seem prettified or minimized by the formal control of the film-making.

Rocket's escape from the violence is more a matter of luck than anything else, and he isn't presented as heroic. In fact, the sub-plot concerning his anxiety about losing his virginity makes him seem a bit lame, if anything. The violent characters are vivid figures rather than interesting characters, but they're still capable of engaging us. The morphing of L'il Dice into L'il Ze is chilling -- clearly a sociopath from the cradle -- and the hardening of the charming Knockout Ned into Ze's would-be nemesis is as close as the movie comes to tragic feeling. But minor characters are vivid and distinct too, especially Benny, Carrot, Goose, and the hopeless addict Tiago. The narrative builds to a climactic street battle among rival gangs, though the tempo is very different from the similar narrative trajectory of the previous movie I viewed, ""Lawless."" It's a battle where Rocket comes into his own and where Ze meets his fate in a way that is as unexpected as it is frightening.",1449100800,,2104,4.655913978494624

But reading all those subtitles distracts you from the acting itself.  I would have given it a 4 1/2 if I could.  But even in this place, which was no City of God, there were those who never took part in the violence and those who turned away from it.

I do not doubt that this happened/happens(?) but it is just hard to swallow because it covers about 75% of the movie.

1922878,5,B0000D9PNX,"What I enjoyed most about ""City of God"" was how realistic it depicted what living in poverty is like and what that lifestyle does to children. Maybe if more people who never lived in poverty watched this film, theyd have a better idea of how poverty affects children who grow up in that worldexplaining why it is so difficult for teachers to teach many of these children who have priorities in life based on survival and not literacy and education.

Although I was born to a family that lived in poverty and we didn't leave poverty behind until I was almost in my teens, I didn't experience poverty this bad until I was teaching in public schools where the childhood poverty rate was 70% or higher and the community around those schools was dominated by violent adolescent, multi-generational street gangs.

The film is set in the streets of the worlds most notorious slum, Rio de Janeiros City of Goda place that the blurb says where combat photographers fear to tread and police rarely go. In the schools where I taught for thirty years, it wasn't safe for the police to patrol those neighborhood streets after dark and my first principal warned us to never follow students on foot off campus into the community because it was too dangerous.

The gangs here are made entirely of children and teengagers, and most adults simply serve as background. Several painful scenes in the film remind you that these are just children in case you forget. The narrator is not directly involved in much of the plot, but his is own story is just as important. Joining a gang is inescapable in these slums, and we see many characters who do their best to get out, end up being pulled back in.",1414800000,,729,4.615384615384615

The City of God is a ghetto on the outskirts of Rio.  The adults perform subsistence type work to survive while the children turn to gang violence and a life of petty crime drug dealing and murder.  The police are little more than scheming thugs.

This is the struggle for ghetto turf, the hearts and minds within the competing gangs and one persons desire to find a different path to a productive life as a photo journalist.  The movie is cruel and compelling yet hopeful as one young man find a way to put himself in the middle of this drug gang war, document it and create a career in photo journalism for himself.

This story is a gangster story, but it's also a social commentary on how poverty, illiteracy, and lack of attention from the government create horrible slum like conditions in Brazil.  Yet it also shows the determination of the people in those ghettos to make it out.  The hero of the story, Rocket, ends up becoming a photographer/journalist and achieves the dream of many of the film's dreams, to escape the favela.

The voice over describing life and the actions they took were very good, and didn't think they were too overboard, although they sure did a lot of stuff, shooting and killing, but there weren't many cops around to stop them.

The editing and screenplay were excellent, liked how they scrambled the timeline in presenting the story and how they ended the movie.

The story was well put together, and reminded me of the story telling of Pulp Fiction with the cuts between segments of the different boys lives and the 1960's,1970's,1980's.  It's tragic to see young boys with guns killing each other, robbing merchants, doing drugs at the age of 8.

This movie will stay with you for a long time if you have never seen a film show how desperate life circumstances can be when you grow up in the slums...looking for a way to survive.  Run and the Beast Chases you, Stop and the Beast eats you.

1923161,5,B0000D9PNX,"I have watched this a couple of times over the years and it still engages me each time.  The movie is about a kid (Rocket) and his view on life in the 'City of God', a planned community that has a dark, gritty side due to unemployment, drugs, crime and corrupt officials.  (Wow, that could be almost any large city in any country these days)..

This is a very violent show but that is what I feel the producers were trying to show:  Youth today have it tough in Brazil and they are on their own and will do anything to make it.  Given what I read about gangs in foreign countries and the USA, I don't think that the level of violence is over the top or excessive.  It is part of their life.

There are a few 'nice' moments as well involving friends and such.  As you get to the end of the movie, you feel the 'cycle of life' in the City of God for Brazilians, but you do see one person make it out.  You also see a few relationships in how things became they way they did for certain folks.  The movie does a great job of tying it all together.

I liked it.  I just need to find the sequel.  I think one was made.",1404864000,,1113,3.981900452488688

1923168,5,B0000D9PNX,Exquisite. Our eyes were opened to more than a wonderfully acted and produced film; we found another real world of childhood poverty and violence. As parents and grandparents we agonized after the movie: will our country continue down its path of creating these two worlds of wealth and poverty?

1923215,4,B0000D9PNX,"I had to watch this movie for class, which usually bodes poorly, but in this case not so much. If you can get over the fact that the movie is pretty long (like 130 minutes) and that it also has subtitles, I think it's fairly easy to enjoy and it will definitely keep your attention.

There's a lot of pretty intense action, as the movie is essentially about a city overseen by a drug lord, as the police are corrupt and unwelcome. Children ARE involved in this, so if you have a hard time seeing children fighting a mans war, this movie will probably be rough. I think the closest American movie would probably be along the lines of Scarface.",1381190400,,642,4.35
1923216,5,B0000D9PNX,The story in the film was told in such a frank manner. No need to add high action moves to tell the story which depicts the violence and disregard for life that existed at the time the story takes place in as the favelas in Rio de Janeiro.,1380672000,,239,4.0

1923219,5,B0000D9PNX,Amazing and powerful movie. Extremely moving. A shock to how people live in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro from the 60s to the 80s and the courage of those who fight against it.,1379980800,,176,4.205882352941177
1923220,1,B0000D9PNX,"I should have known what I was getting into during the opening sequence. A bunch of teenagers running all over town shooting at an escaped chicken made me a bit skeptical. I would have been better off pressing stop right then and there. I had wanted to see this movie for years. I heard nothing but good things about it, and expected gritty realism and interesting characters. What I got was a huge disappointment.  The only thing that ever happens is shooting. Shooting, shooting, and more shooting. And not realistic shooting, but fake action movie over the top shooting. If you want to see a 9 year old kid shooting (one-handed) and laughing the whole time at the carnage, then this is the movie for you. There is no emotional attachment to any of the characters. The cover makes you think there is some kind of humanity to this story, but there is not. The girl on the cover is just a random pretty face, and shows up for 5 minutes. There is no compelling dialogue, no character development, no social commentary. In fact, this movie seems racist in many ways for its depiction of the the Rio slums. All the gangsters are stock characters with no code, no morals and absolutely psychotic. The white lady that directed this trash is pointing at these people in disgust with this movie...""Look how savage they are!"" is pretty much the only message...No hope, no humanity. Just shooting, shooting and more shooting. There is no attempt to look at the social and economic conditions that lead to street violence and the drug trade. There is no attempt to even treat the characters like human beings. I will say the structure and some of the cinematography was cool. But, that could not make up for the rest of it.",1379721600,8,1713,4.616393442622951
1923221,1,B0000D9PNX,"I watched this movie after reading some of the glowing reviews on this site and being told this was ""the best photography movie ever"". I feel compelled to offer a different opinion to balance the incredibly inflated review scores this movie has received.

""City of God"" is a story about what happens when really, really stupid people are allowed to do whatever they want. Think ""Lord of the Flies"" meets ""Menace 2 Society"". There are absolutely no sympathetic characters in the story, even the main character, who the filmmakers appear to think is a good person, is really just a failed thug whose drug habit happens to put him in the right place at the right time to get some pictures of a notorious gang leader that get run in the local newspaper because any legitimate reporter would be killed for just being in that neighborhood.

Why anyone would enjoy watching this is beyond me, the story is brutally violent, featuring countless murders, most of them completely pointless, including murder of children and by children, plus rape, betrayal, torture, you name it. It's impossible to care about anyone in the story, these people made their world, so it's hard to empathize with them when they get what they deserve. If that was the point of the story, then it's a story I don't want any part of.",1379376000,7,1300,4.722466960352423
1923222,4,B0000D9PNX,"This movie gives you in 2 hours what the Wire gives you in a full season. It's tragic and mostly real, and well worth watching. But it is not for the squeamish. The violence, much of it senseless violence, never stops.

The one note of unreality actually undermines it substantially. The main villain's best friend seems to be a really good guy. How could such a Really Good guy be friends with such a completely amoral monster? Either he wasn't really such a good guy, or the monster wasn't really such a monster. Since the movie is meant to depict events that really took place, this moral exaggeration makes it hard to believe any of it.",1377561600,3,640,4.517241379310345

1923228,3,B0000D9PNX,"City of God is a movie about the idea that crime doesn't pay for anyone. It goes about demonstrating this idea by showing a succession of people trying to take over the ghetto with violence. Some of the candidates are kind-hearted Robin Hoods (Tender Trio), some are accidental gangsters (Knockout Ted), some are simply evil (Lil'Z) and some are a bunch of prepubescent kids (Runts). They all use violence to pursue crime. They all fail. Even as the Runts seem to rule the day at the end, having killed Lil'Z, you know things can change tomorrow (they're like, 10 years old). These four external plots are joined by an internal plot of our protagonist, Rocket, successfully avoiding a life of crime by luck and some fortitude.

The movie seems to want to be more than an episodic chorus of violence. It strains to show that the ghetto and a broken system makes crime and criminality inevitable. It shows this mainly through the reluctant criminal of Knockout Ted who is basically forced to become a gangster after trying to live virtuously. But this idea is relegated to secondary importance for me: much of the violence is glorified, and our hero does escape a life of crime (even though he is no where near as virtuous as Ted was), providing contrary evidence to the idea that crime is inevitable.

A change of protagonist from Rocket into Knockout Ted might have gotten this movie onto this bigger idea.

That's not to say the movie doesn't have some pretty memorable scenes, locations and the fact that it's a Brazilian production based on true characters is pretty awesome. I just think it could have mixed its potent ingredients together towards a bigger idea.

1923268,5,B0000D9PNX,"There is something so endearing... no... that's not the right word... lets go with RIVETING and mad compelling about stories that take you from someone's childhood into their adulthood, where you feel as if you are living life right alongside the protagonists. And a what a LIFE unfolds in City of God!

The story was sort of an eye-opening travelogue as the Rio De Janiero depicted here bears no resemblance to the fabled vacation spot. I'd no idea such danger, sadness, rot and corruption existed there or how much gang violence was a part of the natural terrain. Like many, I'd long ago bought into the picture post card version of Rio; the one with the white sandy beaches and the beautiful exotic-skinned natives, and so I never KNEW of the slums, the utter lawlessness, or the moral decay.

BUT... HUGE BUT... I so related to the character of ""Rocket."" He could have been me in another life and locale.  I love how he chose to see ART, when he could have very easily chosen his brother's path. I admired the shape of his spine, even as life was growing more and more frantic, even as the young lives of others were corroding, eroding and being destroyed all around him. There is something very noble in his face, the actor's rhythms/gestures kept me attentive the entire time, fearing, sensing something horrible was about to happen.

Maybe our hearts remain open and receptive to the kind of people that dream outside the scope of their surroundings, who burn and yearn for some thing or someplace better... and yet learn to make do with what exists around him. So many of us are watchers/observers of life, and it's that one passion in us that keeps us sane and safer than those who travel a more dangerous and ultimately doomed route.

That hardcore thug ""Lil Ze""  as more than just a little terrifying... and nonetheless he is a fascinating character to hate.

This beautifully directed film truly is a vivid CHARACTER study. It is a up-close and personal look into the lives of people so different than myself, and yet, very much human and trapped by circumstance and the choices they make.

It was sad in so many instances, but it strangely allows one to HOPE.

As a film experience, it is damned compelling and a very worthwhile journey.

1923285,5,B0000D9PNX,"First let me say that I read the 1 star reviews and to be frank, they have no basis.  Who decides to watch a movie based on real life (the favelas were as drug-ridden as depicted in the movie) and then complains that the movie's gory depiction is too much?  If you're looking for Alice in Wonderland or to ""feel good"", that's silly because you really shouldnn't watch movies telling real stories of suffering and expect to seek ""redemption"" or ""morality"" at the end.

With that being said, I love this movie.  The way the movie approaches the intersection of poverty, crime and race is really nuanced and interesting.  One of the most powerful parts is seeing how ""powerful"" the drug dealers are in their own neighborhoods, yet they can't even enter chic parts of Rio to buy their own sneakers/clothes so they get a lighter skinned Brazilian to do so.  Also, the storytelling aspect was just amazing.",1353628800,,900,4.6645569620253164

1923294,5,B0000D9PNX,"How far away is the City of God?  The City of God was directed by Fernando Meirelles in 2002.
This film tells the story of crime, love, and life in the South American ghetto.
It is a very violent & entertaining look at life in the poverty stricken streets of a suburb outside
Rio de Janeiro. The main character is a boy named Rocket. The story follows
him from youth to young manhood. Throughout his life he experiences the streets first hand.
He is ambitious and follows his dreams of becoming a photographer despite all the
the violence that surrounds him everyday.  As he grows he watches his friends, brothers, and
life long companions fall to vicious gang warfare. From the start to end this film communicates
the fact that in the street game - everything goes full circle. The one on top today is the one
who most likely loses tomorrow. Nothing lasts forever and really no one wins.
City of God is totally one of a kind. It will enrage you and entertain you. Bother and comfort you.
It is very cool and very sad. Ultimately it is a film that everyone should watch at some point.
City of God is a very thoughtful film about overcoming hardships and the harsh realities of life.

The story of a young man named Rocket who wants to become a photographer/journalist in Rio De Janeiro, and his life shown as a citizen in a city where violence, crime, and gangs rule. The movie shows his life from the 60's to present day in the film and it is one of the best movies you will ever see. I highly recommend this for the storyline, the acting, and the stylish camera work. This is a movie that just stands out on its own for different resasons, and is a rare look at a original idea put on film (something that is rare these days itself) what makes this film even more impressive are the actors and actresses. I heard somewhere that none of the people in this film had ever acted before, if thats true then they all did a wonderful job of showing people around the world what life is like in the City of God.

This movie is violent, this movie is graphic. This movie is not afraid to show you how dangerous life is for people who grow up with gang wars in their neighborhoods. What i liked about this movie is the different story lines that come with it and how they interact with each other. From violent gun fights to block parties and robbing stores, the lives of these people will never be the same again at the end of the film. Definitely check this one out, you won't be disappointed!

Also the sequel City of Men is a similar shot style movie that was released a few years ago, 2006 i think. If you want check that one out too, its not as good as the first (in my opinion) but it does have its own fair share of shock value and you do connect to the characters in the film as much.

Since the Rio journalists were too afraid to travel to the ghetto to take pictures, he did it, despite the risks involved. And with that camera he was given, the young man captures everything about his poor neighborhood that non-residents have heard but could not see.

I don't need to see these type of scenes to see what goes in a favela.

Now what I can say about the original for those who have not seen it is this is the incredibly gripping narrative plot is only matched by this movie's visuals.  It's like an evolution of what Heat did for gritty real life visuals.  This film's great cinematography makes it the Matrix of real life grit films.

1923323,3,B0000D9PNX,"I was thinking what was lacking in this movie, and trying to figure out what struck me as not quite right with this movie.  And while looking at Netflix reviews, one reviewer mentioned that it had no moral center and no redeeming value, either.  And that's a good point, because at the climax of the movie, when there is just all out violence, Rocket, the main character, shoots a lot of photographs, and it seems that there is more in his face than just fear of being killed by a gun (which is one of his main life fears, btw), but a real moral qualm about his role as photographer in what is a drug turf war.  This should have been developed more b/c he gains quite a bit from his peripheral role in the drug trade, including sex and an internship, the latter of which was his launchpad for his career.  But during the climax or a part of it, where Knockout Ned, who is avenging family members' deaths, is killed by the boy who asks Carrot for a gun, ""to avenge his father's death,"" who Ned killed during a bank heist before he shot him, we do get a semi-moral message, which is that blood lust will make you do things you wouldn't normally do and will get you dead or at least in trouble. (But this is not consistent throughout because Benny is killed by accident, and there are other acts of violence for its own sake or just random acts of violence.)

When Rocket is snapping photos of Li'l Ze's interaction with the cops outside of his apartment (after the big gun fight) and Li'l Ze's being shot to death by some kids avenging their friend's death, I was rooting for Rocket not to get found out, hoping that nobody involved in the actual drug war would see Rocket.  While the photographer seeing while not being seen, staying out of the way is a nice metaphor, the only redeeming thing about all of this is Rocket ""launching"" his career, which is a nice story, you know, good for him, glad you made it out.  And then that makes you think, well, that's all there is, I'm gonna get mine and get out, and that is not hopeful or redeeming.  And this is as close to a moral we get, which isn't a moral at all, but is the rule of the jungle.  He could have taken photos of fish or parties or something else if he was really worried about his role in the drug war and being and making an honest living.  (It's important to remember that the only reason Rocket and his buddy don't get involved in crime is that the one time they try to do it, all of their potential victims are ""too cool"" to do wrong; it's also important to remember that Rocket is really not close to anybody, even his friend that was just mentioned and that he is accompanied by during the climactic event that frame the rest of movie goes unnamed.)",1300492800,2,2717,4.278752436647173

1923325,5,B0000D9PNX,"City of God (Cidade de Deus), based on the true-life novel by Paulo Lins, is the story of hoodlums and gangs living and growing up in the slums of Rio De Janeiro. A coming of age story that I thought was a cross between Scarface, Pulp Fiction and Angels with Dirty Faces. The story unfolds in a non-linear fashion, but not in such a way that the story ever became confusing.

Where the movie failed just a bit for me, and this is a very minor nitpick, was in not spending a little more time explaining some of the social and economic events that were happening at the time which led to the situation in the slums. Events were touched on at the beginning of the movie, but I would have liked a little more.

Where City of God succeeded so brilliantly was in how realistic and well drawn the characters were. There wasn't one character in the movie who was either all good or all bad. Everyone had their faults and everyone had personal issues that transcended what they might be doing in the movie. Screenwriter Braulio Mantovani and director Fernando Meirelles (he and I share a birthday!) didn't manipulate us by trying to lead us in certain directions and make us like one character over another. They let us watch the story and make up our own minds.

I found this to be a tense and hard-nosed crime movie and every bit as adrenaline-charged as The Godfather and Goodfellas, as well as the three I mentioned above. The movie also features an excellent soundtrack.

On the box cover there's a blurb from Roger Ebert that this is one of the best films you'll ever see. I'm not a big fan of absolutes, but I would have a hard time disagreeing with Mr. Ebert's assessment.

Because of the subject matter and the lives of the characters this isn't always an easy movie to watch, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be watched. I recommend City of God highly to anyone. The movie is in Portuguese with English subtitles. If you're not a fan of subtitles try not to let that put you off because this movie is well worth it. If you've ever wondered what a subtitled movie would be like, and you like crime dramas, then City of God is a great place to start.",1297814400,,2151,4.408060453400504

1923327,5,B0000D9PNX,"At it's most basic `City of God' is a film about inter gang warfare in the Brazilian slums. Two drug gangs fight it out over territory and for respect and innocent lives get caught in the crossfire. But if you delve a little deeper, this is also about betrayal, the hard violent struggle to survive, about those trying to stay honest and pure whilst those around them descend into crime and filth and the simple fight of good over bad. This is gritty viewing from the word go and yet the direction is stylish and very effective. This is shot in a series of vignettes and yet an over-arcing story ties it all together. This is in Portuguese with subtitles throughout which adds to the authenticity and feel of the film. You will flinch at some of the violence and be shocked at how young the kids start on the slippery slope to anarchy and crime. You will be even more shocked when you realise that this is based on a true story and events like these actually happened. I started off not being too involved in the film or story, but after half an hour I was hooked and this became compelling viewing. This was highly lauded when it was released and it has been recommended to me numerous times. I can only say it deserved all the accolades it received and would suggest you don't wait as long as I did before viewing it. It is unrelenting and raw, but completely engaging and will leave an impact. You couldn't ask for more from a film.

Sometimes a movie comes along that is so unexpected and fresh that it takes a little while after viewing to realize what you've just watched. ""City of God"" is one of those movies. It will leave you with a feeling of utter satisfaction.

Based on a true story, ""City of God"" takes a look at the life of Buscap aka Rocket, a kid from the slums as he attempts to survive. The journey covers two decades and depicts the true way of life in the ghettos of Rio de Janeiro. In the first half of the film we see Rocket grow up dealing with things no child should ever deal with. They really cover everything: drugs, violence, politics sex. Throughout all this Rocket retains his passion for photography. His dream and inevitable ticket out. Eventually he decides to begin snapping shots of the local gang activity. The local paper gets their hands on his photo's and so begins the second act of this film. Rocket works to get the ""next big shot"".

This is a violent movie but it is not overly so. It works with the atmosphere of the film and I found it a necessary aspect. Scriptwriter Brulio Mantovani did a great job interpreting the book by Paulo Lins bringing a haunting reality to the characters. We not only hated some of the characters but also felt a very strong connection to them. A task not easily accomplished. Rocket, wonderfully played by Alexandre Rodriguez fights to keep out of the draw of drugs and crime. In fact, all of the actors did a great job. I was amazed how well they portrayed the inner battle between good and evil.

One of the best aspects of the film is in the photography. Cinematographer Csar Charlone and Director Fernando Meirelles did a great job with the colors., it reminded me a lot of ""Traffic"" directed by Steven Soderbergh. They were dull but it worked magnificently contrasted with the vibrant soundtrack and the frantic editing. ""City of God"" goes full circle in the life of the gangsters, a feature I really enjoyed. I wasn't left with questions, something not found in a lot of current cinema.

All in all this is a masterpiece of film making. The characters, scenery, storyline, script, editing, direction and acting are all superb. It is yet another shining example of how foreign movies are some of the best in the business.

1923334,5,B0000D9PNX,"City of God is nothing short of a masterpiece.  It's gritty, realistic, and never lets go of you for the entire film.

I've seen a number of movies since the 90's, such as Boca, that put a spotlight on Rio's favelas.  But no movie has ever captured Brazil's poverty like City of God.  The story is powerful, and the cast of characters keep your interest throughout the movie.

Most of the reviewers offer an overview of the plot; I'll keep it simple.  This is a movie that everyone should experience at least once.  I'm an Amazon-verified buyer of this movie, and I bought a copy for every one of my friends, who all love it as well.

It was a different kind of mini-vacation.",1268352000,,367,4.411764705882353
1923336,5,B0000D9PNX,"The Brazilian government-built City of God is meant to replace the slums, but ultimately turns into one.  In this environment, drug lords rule their neighborhoods.  This movie is the fictionalized tale of the development of Li'l Ze, a ruthless killer who demands loyalty, and his battles with a competing drug lord and the police.  Dead bodies on the street merit barely a glance from the residents... they have habituated to the violence.

The magic of this production lies in its no holds barred depiction of slum violence, corruption, drug use, and poverty, mixed with the angst of teen love, friendship, and loyalty. Throughout the movie, the life of each character seems to be hanging by a thread.  Given that the 2016 Summer Olympics will be held in Rio de Janeiro, there will be increased interest in this film, Rio's associated slums and favelas, ""poverty tourism,"" and security concerns surrounding the Olympics.

I understand the majority of child actors in City of God were recruited from the actual Cidade de Deus (City of God); many were amazing talents.  And the ones that weren't were playing the roles of stoned kids... probably not a hard character to play.

This story is told through the eyes of Rocket, a young man whose family and friends are surrounded and influenced by crime, but Rocket seems to escape personal destruction, primarily by having some good friends, avoiding cocaine, and having a dream to be a photographer.

Recommended.  It is interesting to compare with another movie about intense life in the slums,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-of-Joy/dp/B0001BRSRG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City of Joy</a>, based in India, although it is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/book/dp/0446355569/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">book</a>, and not the movie, which is the most powerful of the two.",1263945600,,1911,5.720848056537102
1923337,5,B0000D9PNX,"Many movies try to recreate the real world, giving us a ""true"" story that's supposed to be gripping, gritty, and scary but never completely accomplishing the goal. Other times we get movies that would appear to give us what we were expecting if it weren't for the fact that they've been done over and over again. In 2002, though, Fernando Meirelles gave us a new story that showed us a new world. Focusing on the true story of Rocket as he grows up around the gangs in Cidade de Deus, a neighborhood in Rio de Janiero where gangs of children ran free to rob, loot, and deal drugs, City of God feels more like a documentary than a dramatic theatrical film.

Narrated by Rocket (Alexandre Rodriguez), City of God begins with the story of the Tender Trio. The Tender Trio, a teenage gang that pretty much ran Cidade de Deus in the 60's which also included Rocket's brother Goose, robbed gas trucks at gun point, stealing the money and giving the propane to the people around them. They never made much off the money, so a young hanger on named Li'l Dice gave them the idea to rob the rich in a local hotel. Things don't go quite as planned and everyone in the hotel ends up dead, with the Tender Trio hunted by the police. Fast forward to the 70's and Li'l Dice, now Li'l Ze, is the most respected hood in Cidade de Deus. Having killed all the members of the hotel in the 60's robbery, and Goose, Rocket's brother after that, he got a taste of blood. As Rocket tries to avoid him, Li'l Ze kills off all the drug dealers in Cidade de Deus making way for him to be the only hookup in the slums. But, as he gains control of the slums, he kills the family of one man who is going to try his damnedest to take him down.

City of God is a gangster movie through and through, but while you might see some things that remind you of other gangster movies you never feel that this movie is being derivative. The director does borrow things from, say, Martin Scorsese (e.g.: the talk of how drug dealing works in the slums reminded me of Casino), Meirelles always makes it his own. And while the movie is a gangster movie and does deal with a gangster making his way up the chain and ruling the crime world in a neighborhood, the movie never feels like it's taking the usual route, giving equal time to the rise of the Li'l Ze and to Rocket's venture in becoming a photojournalist and staying out of the crime world.

The film looks absolutely amazing. The cinematography gives everything the feel of being in the sun drenched City in Rio de Janeiro. On top of that, the camera moves gives the film a sense of urgency and a certain freshness that makes everything feel that much more real. The writing reminds me a bit of Quentin Tarantino, it's a bit all over the place, but in a good way. As you meet a character that's important to the story your whisked away into the world of who they were before they entered into the story. It works in much the same way as Tarantino's ADD addled films, but never takes away from the story as it has in other films that have tried to copy the ""Tarantino Method"" so to speak.

While all of that works to make an amazingly gripping film, there would be nothing without the actors. Typically, in my reviews, I would prefer to point out great performances, but in this movie that's nigh impossible. From the Runts (young groups of children who loot and rob people and businesses in the slums) to the main characters, everyone works as a team player. The point is that they're performances are so genuine, so unique, that everyone feels like the live and breathe in this world. When watching this movie you feel like you are visiting Cidade de Deus, and that's what you really want from this type of movie.

In this movie I can see no bad, but there are things that you should know before you watch the movie. The majority of the violence is dealing with children and teens, which makes the violence more frightening and disturbing. Meirelles doesn't shy away from anything, even murdering a six to eight year old child. One of the great things about the way the violence is handled though, is that you never want the violence to happen, you always feel disturbed by the violence that does happen and prefer to stay away from it as the movie goes on (the way it really should be in movies). The movie is in Portuguese so you will have to read subtitles, but I have to say, if you choose to do so, you'll be rewarded by the story you receive. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, and everyone!

1923338,4,B0000D9PNX,"This film contains elements I most dislike to see--excessive, graphic violence & excessive, graphic violence directed at children--and there's more. CITY OF GOD contains scenes of excessive, graphic violence executed by children. We're not talking about the sort of aberrant violence found in movies like LORD OF THE FLIES where the violence is more or less psychological, used in the interest of illustrating artistic concepts; no, the violence in CITY OF GOD is the cold illustration of a mundane, day-to-day reality. Despite my own emotional squeemishness, I couldn't take my eyes from watching every second of every scene in this potent & shocking movie. The only serious problem I had with the movie was its ending. There was an abrupt detachment of focus from the central issue of slum poverty & violence, to an almost lighthearted conclusion that seemed to reinforce the idea that by ""following your (artistic) dream and by hard work,"" you can liberate yourself from--the cycle of poverty & violence. In CITY OF GOD this is somewhat balanced with the fact that the artist (photojournalist) in this case ""gives something back"" by drawing attention to the terror of the ghetto. Unfortunately, this line almost parallels exactly the current propaganda of USA capitalism. It's the old ""American Dream"" mantra. The main difference is that the conditions of poverty outside the U.S. are so drastic that a film like CITY OF GOD simply can't help but be more artistically & significantly relevant than, let's say, AMERICAN IDOL.

As there are a massive number of reviews which tell you the story, the saga really, of kids who grow up with guns, and learn the harshest lessons of life at an age when most well-fed Americans and Europeans are entering Kindergarden, I recommend that you consider this epic film, one of the greatest ever made, in conjunction with the information presented by a UCR scholar of urban development, Mike Davis, in his book, Planet of Slums. For the bulk of children coming of age on  Planet Earth today, the favela is the reality, not the suburb. Lil Z's are proliferating faster than DU dust-particles.  What you see in this film is the begining-of-the-end product of colonialism, misguided globalization, and the ethos of Hobbesian contractualism - the supposedly justified ""virtue of selfishness"" or so-called ""enlightened self-interest"" which, through an entropic spate of home-invasions, gang-led small-scale wars, acquisition, by force, theft, or trade of WMD's, may very well bring this decadent,basically dishonest, unjust, and cruel epoch of ""civilization"" to its crashing close.

The movie is based on life in the slums (or favelas) of Rio de Janeiro where the presence of poverty, official neglect, drugs and guns creates a haven for criminals and sociopaths. In the midst of this chaos; our narrator guides us through his early childhood and adolescence and how he became a photographer for a Brazilian paper.

Thankfully the violence is not gratuitous and the sex scenes are limited and discrete. The colours in the film are vivid and beautiful and reading the subtitles is not problematic; Portuguese I am slowly being convinced is almost as beautiful as Spanish.

There are not many light moments in the film, but at the same time the movie is not depressing; there is redemption, even if it is only on film. The extra is useful to understanding the reality behind the life in the favelas and is a useful companion. I believe there could have been additional content to help non-Brazilians understand the social structure and race in Brazil for example.

1923351,5,B0000D9PNX,"City of God is a beautiful film by director Fernando Meirelles. The movie focuses on the true life story of a boy who struggles to grow up in the tough streets of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The plot of the film is pieced together through various character subplots that ultimately interwine in the end to result in an explosive finish (the intertwined story editing is similiar to such movies as Fight Club, Momento, and Crash). Overall City of God is an incredibly pulsating film that is well acted and above all else real. As a warning to some the film is very violent but not gratuitous.",1215129600,,587,4.547169811320755
1923352,4,B0000D9PNX,"Every big city has its crime and drug problems, but Rio de Janeiro is different. It's only sort of a big city, a sprawling landscape of measured favelas (slum neighborhoods) and mazelike city streets. Poverty lies around every corner. Crime runs rampant. Hope has left the city and shot right past the shanty slums on the outskirts of town. Young boys like Rocket don't know that a thing like hope exist.

CITY OF GOD (Cidade de Deus) follows the journey of Rocket, but it does so in a clever meandering sort of way. We get a good glimpse into 5 or 6 main characters, all for the sake of showing Rocket's story. But all the characters in a story each have their own story, and this film does its best to tell each of those as well. Rocket wants to make a truly honest living for himself, but at each step along the way, ""the city"" won't let him.  The environment doesn't allow for honest livings. Drug gangs rule the slums, namely the youth-run gangs of Li'l Ze' and Carrot. The police are paid off by the gangs, and when the police aren't fighting against the real injustices of the town, you know you're in trouble.

This is a dark film, well-acted, but filled with heartless killing and drug use. While often this genre leaves me feeling dirty, CITY OF GOD left me sad for the people of Brazil and areas like them. I haven't read the novel by Paulo Lins, but the film has enough redemption within the muck for me to recommend it, though not wholeheartedly. It feels like a fresh version of Scarface or the Godfather, only told from a different character's point of view and for slightly different effect. When farming and fish-selling doesn't pay the bills, what else is left for a young man to do? Rocket's dream is in photography. The question is, will the City of God allow him to live a holy life free from crime and corruption. The irony for Rocket and so many like him is that it is in that same corruption that he finds his honest hope.

This is a film in the tradition of ""Goodfellas"" and ""Menace II Society"", with traces of ""Once Upon a Time in America."" Brilliantly scripted, acted, and edited, with believable, three-dimensional characters, this is a movie that will grip you from the first moments until the end.

I visited Rio in 1975, and was advised to stay away from the slums, at all cost. Sr. Meirelles is to be commended for creating a world unto itself, so complex that the mind boggles; so brutal, I'm amazed that anyone remains alive. It's hard to describe the film, but its images are etched in my mind. Brilliant cinematography and editing draw you in and don't let go, even at over 2 hours. I have no problem with subtitles, but the narration and dialogue are rapid-fire, and it was necessary to watch some scenes over. Amazing DVD extras give further insight into the trial facing cops in these areas, and the film leaves one, ultimately, breathless.

To say any portrayed images of their lives and development were unique would indicate that I am oblivious to reality.

City of God is a microcosmic view of life for the so-called underclass in hundreds of urban environments. Is, or was, this sector of one city of Brazil the most horrendous slum imaginable, I don't know but I can say identical circumstances are extant and as powerfully illustrated in HBO's series about life in Baltimore,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wire-The-Complete-Fourth-Season/dp/B000QXDJLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wire - The Complete Fourth Season</a>. This is not intended as some xenophobic diatribe, my inference is each of us should remain cognizant of the human condition and the impact of economic disparity wherever it is encountered and often that disparity can be easily identified in areas too near to be flippantly dismissed.

In this story, the vehicle of escape is a camera but it could easily have been a soccer ball, or any other ball, in another locale. With drugs and other proscribed illegal activities serving as the template to a better life, only for the most independent thinkers and actors could education serve as the critical path to another environment. The narrator of the story and central character, Rocket, is able to circumvent the endemic pitfalls of his surroundings via guile and in numerable instances, blind luck.

1923366,5,B0000D9PNX,"The director knows his source material well and it shows, and knowing many of the cast are local talent rather than professional actors is even more impressive.  For most viewers, the Brazilian slums of Rio de Janeiro are as alien as could possibly be, yet the film effortlessly makes you feel you grew up there yourself and perfectly belong.

The story line spans several decades, beginning in the 1950s.  The primary protagonist, and moral anchor of the story is a character nicknamed Rocket.  The movie shows how the ""City of God"" teaches early lessons about the rigors of scratching out a hardscrabble existence in the slums, where petty acts of hooliganism by older teens become triumphs to be emulated by younger boys.  One sees youths making frightfully early decisions on whether to take the ""hard"" path of education and an honest life, or the ""easy"" path of being a criminal ""hood.""  Rocket's early boyhood is spent admiring what he sees as the heroics of his older brother Goose and his friends (the ""tender trio"") as they engage in petty crime such as hijacking a propane truck and stealing its cargo.  Caught by his father, Goose is punished by his father and begs Rocket to not follow in his footsteps as a ""hood,"" but Rocket continues to idealize his brother and his gang.  Unfortunately, Goose has another admirer, Little Dice (later, Little Ze), who even from a young age (8 or 9) yearns to be the top hood in City of God.  Little Dice, along with his cohort Bene, is soon masterminding criminal acts himself, and soon surpasses his teacher.  During a robbery of a hotel, Little Ze murders the guests and sets up Goose and his Tender Trio cohorts to take the fall.  The actor who played the younger Little Ze does an incredible job here, and to see the glee of Little Ze as he methodically murders the guests is scary indeed.  With the Tender Trio now disposed of, the path for Little Ze is clear.

Flash forward about 10 years.  Rocket is now a young man, still unsure about himself and his place in the world.  The City of God has devolved into rival gang/drug selling territories.  While Bene has matured into a somewhat kind and reasonable man (although still a criminal gang leader), Little Dice has gone completely into the heart of darkness.  Indeed, he visits a voodoo doctor to help in his efforts to become top hood, and is given a talisman and a new name (Little Ze).  After some additional gang warfare, Little Ze and Bene wind up dividing the spoils with Carrot, a rival drug lord.  This brings a rough equilibrium and peace of a sort to the City of God, and the characters pursue their dreams - love for Rocket, power for Little Ze, etc.  The peace is soon shattered as the gangs mess with the wrong man, the moral ""Knockout Ned.""  Little Ze becomes jealous of Ned, his good looks, and his girlfriend.  A mugging and rape ensue, and Ned joins forces with Carrot's gang to declare war on Little Ze.

The resulting gang war takes up the remainder of the film.  Ironically, the war proves Rocket's salvation as his gifts for photography allow him to capture images of the gang war, and get a photojournalist job with a newspaper.  For others though, the war brings only misery - the fight corrupts Ned (who is blinded by his rage) and takes the life of the kind and gentle Bene.  It finally degenerates to the point where Little Ze and Carrot are drafting young children to fight.  Eventually those children prove Little Ze's undoing, as he was the undoing for the Tender Trio earlier.",1185148800,,3512,4.613526570048309

And that's when you learn that this movie is actually based on a true story.

This movie is compelling, heartfelt, and never looses it's footing. It's never preachy or subjective, and doesn't pull at your heartstrings. There's never a moral or a hidden lesson - it's there for interpretation and, yet, it isn't.

The movie follows a single narrator, who has the talent to see his world through the objective photographer's lens. The story is presented in a series of flashbacks and descriptions of each of the character's stories. In a movie with a less talented crew, the script would've been garbled, but this movie eliminates any confusion that might have arisen and turns it into positive complexity.

The beginning of the movie will make you decide to be a vegetarian. And if you manage to feel bad for the chicken, you'll realize how paradoxical it must be that there is a certain numbness towards the hopeless souls of the City of God.

The acting, done mostly by non-professionals, is superb and the characters grab you and remain with you.

The DVD cover quotes Roger Ebert as saying that this will be ""One of the best movies you'll ever see."" There's a reason that man is the only film critic to receive a Pulitzer - he's absolutely right about this movie.

The film is narrated by one of the few people to escape this vortex of anarchy, one ""Rocket"" who aspires to be a photographer, and is based upon Paulo Lins's novel of the same name (Ciudad De Dios). At 135 minutes, I found the film a little long, but I also hasten to add that I think it deserves the uniformly superlative reviews that it has received.

The genre - montages of flashbacks and fast forwards - came alive after the debut of this movie, but this one is clearly the best.

The acting is fantastic - the characters really do come alive.  You do believe that Benny was the coolest Hood in the City of God.  Little Dice really was the evilist kid around.  Based on a true story, the actors do the real life leads justice.

The DVD has an extra on the drug war in Rio that is well worth watching - it gives added context to the story.  The interviews with the people portrayed in the movie also add realism to the drama.

1923399,5,B0000D9PNX,"I stumbled across ""City of God"" when I turned on the TV to play a DVD.  As I was getting ready to put the DVD in, I noticed that there was a movie that was just starting.  As I watched the first few minutes I became immersed in this Brazilian movie of life in a slum in Rio.  I sat mesmerized as this story of a youth trying to grow up despite all of the violence around him.  This is a very brutal and profane movie but these extremes have their place in ""City of God"".  Anything less would have diluted the impact of the film.  ""City of God"" is a movie with many subplots, iterlocking stories and shifts in time.  The film even had titles for the different stories within a story.  The many characters that come and go are well-presented in their own unique way.  There are some we come to know as evil incarnate but most of the various characters become strangely endearing.  The main focus of ""City of God"" is a boy called Rocket who does his best to survive in his toxic surroundings.  His opposite is Lil' Dice who learns to enjoy murder before the age of puberty.  There is a plot but the impact of the movie is how the many stories and people bring us a real sense of a life we would never want to experience in person but fascinates us too much to turn away from on film.  The violence is numbing and what makes it even more so is how so many of those directly involved are children.  Indeed, there seems to be a near-total absence of parents.  It's probably no coincidence that Rocket's father seems to be the one lone authoritative parent but we only see that in one brief scene.  Of all the frightening scenes of violence in the movie, the most disturbing for me (and, I suspect, many others) was the final scene.  Listening to the pre-teens talk amongst themselves in that closing sequence defines the problem that the rest of the movie put on display.  The sad thing is that we wouldn't have believed in that scene if we hadn't seen the previous 130 minutes.

The acting in ""City of God"" is outstanding which is all the more impressive because of how many young people have significant roles in the movie.  The directing was tremendous and this is one of those rare movies when you realize the value of a good film editor.  ""City of God"" reminded me of ""Boyz in the Hood"" but on a more unsettling level.  This is like Martin Scorsese with a better articulated message.",1167350400,3,2382,4.329571106094808

The young narrator tells the story of the City of God, a barrio set up by the Brazilian government outside Rio de Janiero.  There the economy and the law are driven by gangs of youthful hoodlums.  At first we meet the Tender Trio, who seem pretty much out-of-control as they crash into a local cantina, but their story pales in comparison to the mayhem wrought by Lil' Z, a protg who proves to be much more ruthless.  His rise and fall are by turns shocking and ironic.  An amazing cast of young Brazilian actors, some recruited from the real City of God, make you forget just how young they are.  The director employs a number of cinematic techiques, particularly with time, that enhance the story--although a repeat watching will help keep it all straight.",1162252800,3,1047,4.725274725274725
1923422,5,B0000D9PNX,"Life is hard and difficult.  Unfortunately, for many people in the world life is also unbearably brutal.  Living in the United States we often forget that, even if we grew up in impoverished small towns or in the slums of the inner city.  CITY OF GOD is a film that examines the brutality of humanity in a housing project that is part of Rio de Janeiro.

CITY OF GOD is the name of a housing project built in Rio de Janeiro in the 1960s.  From watching the movie, it seemed to me that CITY OF GOD is like a really bad ghetto and slum area of the city that virtually operates under its own rules.  The area became a hotbed of violence starting in the 1970s.  To this day it is still known as being one of the most dangerous places in the world to live in.  We are given a glimpse into what life is like in this place through the narration of the film's central character, Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues).  Rocket is a photographer who grew up in CITY OF GOD.  Through the movie he tells a story of what caused the violence in CITY OF GOD, how it came to be, and how for a brief time it was brought under control by the government.

Rocket has a close-knit body of friends while growing up, but he doesn't have the stomach to commit the crimes and violence that his friends do.  He breaks away, tries to study, and works at ""real"" jobs where he is underpaid and disrespected.  Meanwhile, his friends grow up to take control of the projects drug trade.  They become rich and powerful, but also hated.  Meanwhile, Rocket discovers that he has a knack for taking pictures and is saved through the art he creates (reminding me of a quote from Pablo Neruda, ""Art, like food, should feed the world."")

CITY OF GOD is an extremely well-done film.  The acting is so real and honest.  Part of that is probably attributable the director for hiring mostly actors who grew up in the slums, including Alexandre Rodrigues who grew up in the City of God itself.  This realism carries over into the settings, scenery, and locations, too.  Much of the movie was filmed in one of the slums of Rio (but not the City of God) and things were so dangerous that the director almost stopped the filming of the movie.  The final product is an incredible brutal and realistic portrayal of the harsh life or existence the people living there chose or are forced to endure everyday.

The film is full of violence, language, and sexuality that some people will find offensive.  It's also a very sad movie in many ways because the people involved in the aftermath of it all, refuse to break the cycle of violence and destruction that surrounds them.  Existing is easy, but living is much more difficult.  Existing might be more dangerous, but it's much easier to do.  As brutal and depressing that CITY OF GOD is, it does offer a glimmer of hope through the eyes of Rocket, a man from the CITY OF GOD who was able to rise above it and create a better life for himself through art.",1159056000,7,2945,4.387453874538745

It's a strong movie with excellent reviews out there... You can check reviews about the movie, the director, photography etc on other posts or sites. I don't think I would add anything more regarding the movie, so I'll save your time.

What I have to add is that this was more than just a movie.. It was a social project as well... Most of the actors in the movie were not professional actors. They were real people that actually lived in one of the many favelas in Rio. Before they started shooting the movie, the producers held Acting workshops in these favelas where they taught ""Acting"" to these poor kids. They got the best ones and asked them to be in this movie.

That's why the acting was so good in the movie. When watching the movie, just keep in the back of your mind that these kids actually lived in one of the many favelas in Rio.

1923425,5,B0000D9PNX,"This is just one of the many reasons to purchase and watch foreign  language films on a regular basis. The epic crime saga that is City Of God is a film that should never be over-looked, if you enjoy the crime genre, then this is an absolute gold mine for the cravings you seek. It has everything from drama to tragedy and is shot in an aweseome grainy energetic style. This is Fernando Meirelles' City Of God, his masterpiece, and it should be a masterpiece on your shelf right now.

City Of God is based on true events and is set in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, the film is actually named, in portuguese, Cidade de Deus, which is actually sort of a neighberhood in the favelas. This is actually an adaptation of a book of the same name by Paulo Lins. This film is sort of an autobiography of the photographer Wilson Rodrigues, this shows his life in the slums and the huge war that was happening in Rio. The film's central character is rocket and is narrated by him, but there are a few other characters that are considered supporting roles, but you can't really say who the main and leading character is in this film. For instance there's Little Ze, who is the brutal crime lord, Benny, Lil' Ze's right hand man and considered the coolest hood, Knockout Ned, one of the innocents who is swept up in the crime wave etc.

The film is set in two decades, the 60's and the 70's. Rocket is the narrator of the film. The film starts off with a chicken that is on the loose(it escaped from getting butchered), and Little Ze and his hoodlems chasing it down, while they're chasing the doomed chicken, rocket and his friend are talking about what lil' ze will do if he catches rocket, and that he'll kill him. The chicken then appears ahead of them in the middle of the road, lil' ze and a couple of his teenage gangsters appear out on the road in pursuit of the chicken, rocket's blood freazes, realising that lil' ze is right in front of him and this could be his fate. Instead, lil' ze doesn't recognise him and shouts at him to catch the chicken, rocket attempts to pick it up carefully hoping that lil' ze doesn't recognise him. All of a sudden, cops(reffered to as ""mellonheads"" here) appear in a truck and come out with guns, lil ze and his fellow gangsters draw their weapons and both sides are looking at a shoot-out, rocket is caught in the middle of this, and then starts his story about City Of God by going back to the 60's where he tells the stories of lil' ze's rise to being a crook and the other local gang's fall from power.

This film is bassicly the brazillian version of Pulp Fiction and is quite possibly even better! There are seperate stories that are in this film, sort of like Pulp Fiction with The Bonnie Situation etc. This picture has wonderful chemistry between the actors and their characters, you actually feal symphathetic for their destinies and their choices. The direction is superb, Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund did a great job getting the best out of their actors. Katia Lund actually auditioned street kids and took them through acting lessons, some of the actors are real street kids from the slums in Rio. Despite Meirelles being nominated for best director at the oscars, Katia wasn't nominated in an agreement with Meirelles. The cinematography is just one of my favourites here, it's energetic shaky camera work gives the film a fresh feel and dirtiness to it, giving you the emotions and actions of the characters. The music is stunning, the brazilian music gives the film a feel of authenticity. The film's editing is also one of the many standouts, the film is put together beautifly and also got nominated for editing at the oscars, as well as cinematography and writing. Although it didn't get nominated for best foreign language film that year, it was nominated the following year, and surprisingly didn't win.

This film is a definate reccomendation to the world cinema crowd, or even the people who have the slightest interest in the foreign language scene, not a film for everybody though but a definate try for somebody who's looking for a truly extatic cinematic experiance, this is one of the directors' of the South American New Wave. Purchase this triumphant piece today.

It's actually sad that they didn't put more effort into the extra features, the only thing they have is a documentary about the stuff that is happening in the slums today. Film: 5/5 Extras: 2.5/5",1154476800,4,4425,4.587863463969659
1923426,4,B0000D9PNX,"It was a true crime story of gang warfare in the ghetto of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. City of God is a housing project. The story starts in the '60s and goes probably into the early '80s.

One young man is too smart to be an laborer and too sensitive to be a hood. He's the narrator. The main characters are the criminals who are waring against each other for drug territory and profits. One of them is a sociopath who kills anyone for just about any reason, the main troublemaker. Then there is a child gang, all looking no older than 12 and maybe as young as 5. They are The Runts, and they rob stores by attacking them like a swarm of incests. I found this movie frightening because of the fact the police, if involved at all were getting kickbacks from the gangs. And a decent person could become involved on the whims of these thugs. The squalled conditions equal or surpass any inner city neighborhood ( I know having grown up in inner city Detroit myself).

1923427,5,B0000D9PNX,"I watched City of God twice and a half. The first time, I only saw half of it at a friend's house. It was like a drug, though, and I knew I'd have to watch the whole thing soon after.

Some films get old after the first viewing. This is not one of them. I watched it twice in a row after the time in my friend's house. It was exceptional. The story itself was exciting and gripping. Its execution is impeccable. The film draws you into the City of God so well, you almost feel ThErE. You can identify with the characters, even if you live in a land of comfort and plenty. That is one of the movie's best features - its ability to bring the world to life for the audience.

Some of the more violent scenes (for example, when a group of very young children are being interrogated, threatened and worse) are quite difficult to watch, even if you've desensitised yourself to onscreen violence, as is the norm in this age. However, I still found myself glued to the screen. I couldn't look away for a second.

I like the camera angles used in the movie. They highlight aspects of the story in different ways to further explain things nonverbally. The way the story is told is also unusual and ensures that your concentration doesn't break once through the whole thing.

In the extended versions, there are documentaries on Rio de Janeiro that are well worth watching as well.

This is a masterpiece that commands the viewers' full attention. The scope is immense, it will move you and you will not come away unscathed. I would reccommend everyone to watch it once in their lives.",1152748800,4,1574,4.432525951557094
1923428,5,B0000D9PNX,"We all see different films, even when we see the same film. ""City of God"" is especially like that, with it's linked stories that give multiple perspectives--not unlike the linked stories used in postmodern novels. ""City of God"" gives us a story of crime, poverty, drugs, sex, homelessness, corruption, community (in its own way), even odd bits of humor--and a way out.

A Special Feature on this DVD is the documentary ""News from a Personal War"" which uses the same technique of multiple perspecitves in a brilliant effort to give a rounded view to a complex story of the drug war in Rio.

The movie I see would be titled ""Portrait of an Artist as a Young Brazilian"" played by Alexandre Rodrigues as Rocket who narrates ""City of God."" The DVD jacket says it so well: "". . . a frail and scared young boy will grow up to discover that he can view the harsh realities of his surroundings with a different eye: the eye of an artist."" I love the moment when his photos are discovered by the newpaper through a mistake and how that leads to Rocket's career as a journalistic photographer--and his first hot shower, followed by his first sexual experience. This last part of the film is thrilling as Rocket moves into a new world and then rockets between them.

Remember the lyrics that had a bouncing ball on top telling you what word to sing next? Just follow the bouncing ball here--the words and story line of the young narrator as his heart's wish comes true and he demonstrates considerable courage.

1923430,5,B0000D9PNX,"A young Brazilian reveals his trials and tribulations.  Busca-P hopes to eventually become a photographer.  He lives in the The City of God. It is a dystopian social milieu mired in hopelessness, cynicism, and dire poverty.  Criminals essentially do as they wish.  Mind altering drug sales and prostitution are mainstream businesses.  The police often victimize those they are sworn to protect.  Entrepreneurs worry constantly about being robbed and coerced into paying bribes to both government officials and the local mob bosses.  Children are not always innocent.  As matter of fact, they are sometimes the most vicious of perpetrators.  Murdering other human beings is deemed a laughing matter. William Golding's Lord of the Flies is fictional.  These ruthless youngsters, many who will not live to see their 21st birthday, are the real deal.  God help those who get in their way---or possess something they want.

There is one scene that sticks with me.  A group of young punks are robbing a truck driver delivering fuel to the residences in their very neighborhood.  This apparently is a common occurrence.  Think about that for a moment.  Isn't the company forced to raise prices to cover its losses?  How difficult is it to hire drivers?  Are they paid extra for the added danger?  Wouldn't this discourage further investment in the area?  How can things ever get better?  The City of God is a cruel reminder that law and order is mandatory in sustaining a viable society.  This movie is not for the faint of heart.  It is not escapist entertainment.  The violence is continuous and extremely graphic.  Can you handle that?  If so, give the City of God a chance.  I'm personally glad that I took the risk.

The story is of the many young (pre and early-teen) criminals inhabiting an area just outside the big city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. It has the feel of a documentary with real-life street kids but is upgraded considerably by fantastic camera-work, some very innovative cinematography. In other words: stylish.

Make no mistake: without that stylish look, the film might be too much of a downer. The street kids are interesting but really brutal, so be prepared.

1923446,5,B0000D9PNX,"City of God is a movie based on a true story of a young man named Rocket who lives in a city called, The City of God, in Rio de Janeiro. Rocket is a young man who wants to be a photographer when he grows up. However he lives in a very, very hard time as violence rules the city. Corrupt cops turn their heads everytime a drug trade goes on, and the only chance of survival is to either move out or join a gang just so you have some protection in the city.

The City of God is all in subtitles, but the way the camera works in the movie, showing different views of the characters is awesome and the soundtrack to the movie is just great listening to. Rocket goes through his life in views of flashbacks in the movie. From his childhood in the 60's, to becoming a young teenager in the 70's, and finally to a young man working for a newspaper. However it isn't long before Rockets next assignment for picture taking takes him into a world he struggled to stay out of.

Rocket's problem is that he needs to take a picture of a crime lord named, Lil'Z. From the moment he was a young kid like Rocket in the 60's, Lil'Z was born to become a killer. He rose steadily through his years, killing drug traders and others just so his own drug trading business would become the only business in the whole city. Rocket will be paid lots of money if he managed to get pictures of Lil'Z so the newspaper could print them for publicity.

The whole movie shows the sides of lots of characters as well as small stories leading into one big ending. From the story of Rocket trying to get a girlfriend and getting lucky for the first time, to a group of small kids, nicknamed, ""The Runts"" whose soul purpose its seems is to cause havoc and become drug dealers themselves. There is even a small story of seeing an all out gang war erupt after the two last major gangs finally go at it with a lot of guns and a lot of deaths.

Be advised the violence is very graphic in this movie, and the language is far from being toned down. But the way the characters interact with one another and seeing shots of the city as they run all over the place is something that needs to be seen if you want to see great acting. What makes it even more amazing is that none of these characters have any real training or any real publicity at acting, but they are brilliant at what they do.

The ending is great as well, and how Rocket reminds us that this all actually took place makes you wonder just what life really is like in other parts of the world. This movie is a real eye opener of what happens in gangs and cities in other parts of the world...

What impressed me about ""City of God"" was both its urgent social realism and its vibrant, propulsive energy. While the film's stark yet colorful images arrest you, Meirelles' handling of the issues besetting Brazil's slums -- from poverty, lack of access to education and social services, that escalate to violence and the drug trade -- is complex and responsible, but without being preachy. It seems as if Meirelles' camera was an impartial witness to the proceedings and thus the violence becomes even more shocking and devastating because it seemed endemic and thoughtless, coming from the film's characters.

""Favela Rising"", the new documentary I saw, appears to attest to the continuing resonance of ""City of God"". The docu, on the other hand, deals with a Brazilian ex-drug dealer who starts a musical movement called Afro-Reggae to keep young people in his favela (""slum community"") away from violence.

1923461,5,B0000D9PNX,"City of God is a two-hour long metaphor for povery and how it breeds cycles upon cycles of interconnected crime spanning generations. The slum is a lovely backdrop to the non-stop action. In a sense, nobody is completely guilty or innocent; the criminals have their code of honor, and the cops are on the take. Everyone must make a choice or a choice will be thrust upon you. The City of God could have been shot in any country's slum. It is also a coming-of-age tale about a young kid who loves photography. As a reviewer noted, the violence is not gratuitous--but it is a necessary evil to show how hopeless life can become. The editing is wonderful in this film as we jump through the lives and times of the characters(see Sryiana for a similar hyperlink technique where random characters and their stories are shown and linked to the action and theme of the film).",1139616000,,868,4.57051282051282
1923462,5,B0000D9PNX,"With a running time of two plus hours and subtitles, ""City of God (""Cidade de Deus"") is not always the easiest film to watch. There is, however, never a dull moment in this film, which is a first person account of a boy's journey through (and eventually out of) the Rio ghettos.

City of God is told with a cutting style that intermingles different pieces of the storyline (not always in a chronological fashion), slightly reminiscent of the style Tarantino used in ""Pulp Fiction"". This film trumps even Pulp Fiction for raw violence and grittiness - violence made even more believable by the knowledge that gangs truly did have a stronghold on the Rio slums for more than 20 years.

The cinematography is brilliant considering the very modest budget on which the film was produced. The acting takes a clear backseat to the dazzling backdrop of the City of God, which the audience can watch develop from a small shantytown to a world class slum with the darkest of back alleys over the course of the movie.

A great movie to be absorbed and contemplated, City of God is not for the squeamish and contains detailed scenes of children being shot and pulling the trigger. Although far from where a politically correct Hollywood would ever go, this film shines in its ability to reflect the true, unromanticized nature of the society it is seeking to portray.",1139270400,,1355,4.733050847457627
1923463,5,B0000D9PNX,"Brazilian cinema is uneven, but Mr. Rodrigues has really turned in a fine effort, certainly one of the best modern foreign films around.  It's a probably deliberate throwback to the heyday of Brazilian filmmaking of the 60s and 70s, when films like ""Terror e xtase"" and ""Peixote"" were defining Brazilian cinema.

I particularly liked the storyline of City of God.  It's a matter-of-fact description of the nihilism of life in the favela.  Where American cinema might be tempted to delve into hectoring like that in ""Kids,"" City of God keeps its narration and story clean and simple: fight, kill and/or be killed, and if you escape (like the emblematic chicken at the beginning and end of the movie), it's sometimes just by a stroke of good luck.

Anyhow, enjoy the film on any of several levels, from biting commentary on third world living conditions, to the analysis of class in Brazil, to a great action flick.  It's all of them in one.  And we even get a clip of a *very* young Cid Moreira!",1137542400,,994,4.67816091954023
1923464,5,B0000D9PNX,"City of god is a film that you have to see to know how good you have it. These kid's are faced with everything from murder to drugs and it doesn't stop there. Not only do they have to live in an environment filled with crime some of them take part in it before they even hit age 10 and what's crazy is that this is based on a true story. This is a very rugged film as you see children that must do this to survive and the rise and fall of one child that did this for the rush and to satisfy a hunger for murder and to be on top.

The story is told from a child named Busca-pe` or Rocket in English who is a resident of the city of god. You see his life go from the little brother of a thug, then a scared teen, and finally into a brave and brilliant photographer that caught many important pieces of time. He tells you about the birth of a Lil Ze` who would kill at will to get the power he craved and started this at a young age. You are then shown the era of Ze` where he rises and finally falls. You watch City of God for the heart racing and incredibly unbelievable story that doesn't cease to surprise you. Hearing the movie in its original Portuguese language makes the film more raw and realistic.

The acting is nowhere below incredible, these actors are so good you actually start to believe they are the real people from the city and not the actors. I only send a high caution to anyone who is sensitive because this is not a movie for you. This is as real as it gets and the creators hold nothing back in the film so you can get a complete grip on what really happened.",1137369600,,1580,3.9968354430379747
1923465,5,B0000D9PNX,"I just watched this film two days ago and have not been able to stop thinking or talking about it. I am in the process of establishing business in Brazil and having travelled there several times, I was truly captivated. On my first trip there, I was drawn to the favelas each time I passed on my way to one tourist site or another. After convincing my new friends to take me there, I was in awe and refreshed if you can understand. I saw the poverty and what some might think is hopelessness, but I very much saw the life! The real life of people choosing to live with hope. This movie seems so much about conditions and choices. Some which we make and others that might be thrust upon us. The special features section that showed you the real people behind the movie and the life that exist between the hoodlums, the police and the favela dwellers is something to behold. It addressed the gun makers in the U.S. and abroad and how we will intervene/interfere (depending on your point of view) in the world drug wars but we are supplying weapons that are so powerful but not being produced to fight wars, but are being produced just to be sent to Brazil and no where else. This movie speaks to life, family, crime, government and every bodies part that is played in keeping such things flowing. You typically only hear about the beautiful people and things in Brazil, but keeping the war in the favelas keeps the ""dwellers"" from flowing into the streets of Rio to affect the wealthy and the tourist.

It's like you're watching a documentary.  This is not like any gangster film you have seen before.  Kids (real kids not adults pretending to be kids) are shown particpating in violence and dying from it.  This movie is very hard to explain.  You just have to see it.,1136592000,,439,4.2926829268292686
1923469,5,B0000D9PNX,"This Brazilian Portuguese language film set in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, the so-called ""City of God,"" is a mesmerizing coming of age gangsta drama second to none you'll ever see.  At the same time it is a tale of redemption and the triumph of relative good over relative evil.

Representing evil is the psychopathic L'il Dice/L'il Z (Douglas Silva/Leandro Firmino da Hora), who kills people just for the joy it gives him.  Representing the good is the story's narrator, Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), who will grow out of the slum to become a newspaper photographer.  And representing something in between is the charismatic Benny (Phellipe Haagensen).  The acting is excellent, including that by the ""runts,"" actual kids from the City of God; but what carries the film is sharp direction by Fernando Meirelles from an outstanding script by Braulio Mantovani from a novel by Paulos Lins.

I think Hollywood directors ought to note well that it is the authentic realism of the film as seen from within the City of God by one of its own that makes this such a compelling experience for the audience.  None of this can be faked.  True, the story is a bit romanticized as a (very talented) kid might tell it to his friends, but that is all the better because the world view of those kids is part of what makes this film so effective.  Additionally, all the little side stories: the woman at the newspaper who takes Rocket home with her for, shall we say, personal reasons; the story of the girl Rocket loves; the desire of the ""runts' to be men, etc., add layers of genuineness that also can not be faked or dreamed up by any filmland script writer.  These things have to be lived.

Last time I looked Cidade de Deus was ranked #17 at IMDb, ahead of hundreds of great films.  There's not much I can add to that.  Is the film over-rated?  I think so, and I think it will fall in the standings as time goes by.  Good recent films tend to get a lot of attention, and then reach their level after some years have passed and they can be evaluated more objectively.  Regardless, this is a watermark film for the Brazilian cinema and especially for director Fernando Meirelles who because of it rocketed from obscurity to world-wide fame almost overnight.",1135814400,,2246,4.619647355163728
1923470,5,B0000D9PNX,"I ordered ""City of God"" a few weeks ago, and it is excellent! I can't stop watching it! This movie seems to have been perfectly made. It's not over the top with gore, but yet it gets the point across very effectively. You can just tell that it is tastefully done. .... And, as I understand, this movie in the USA made 7.5 million dollars on only 242 screens. If you project that out to 4,000 screens like so many films, that would come out to more than 100 million dollars! So, obvously the theater owners that had the movie in the USA got a good bang for their buck. .... I give this movie an A+. As long as you don't have a problem reading some profanity in the English sub-titles and don't mind seeing some people getting shot ( nothing that you wouldn't have seen on ""The A Team"" 20 years ago anyway ), then you may well find this true story touching and addictive. You really find yourself rooting for the characters! .... Also, if you get the DVD, it contains an extra 1-hour documentary. This documentary was produced in 1997. The ""City of God"" was first a book, published in 1997.

So, this documentary ( I assume ) was meant to help promote the sales of the ""City of God"" book. Only 5 years later would it become a movie, in 2002. .... To sum up, if you want to get a good idea of what life was ( and most likely still is ) like in the favelas ( slums ) of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from the late 1960's to the late 1970's, see some Brazilian teenagers getting down to some American music at the dance club, and if you really want to really have a movie make you feel, then this movie is absolutely a must see for you! .... I would also like to add a quick note about the actors: Even though a young actress named Alice Braga ( ""Angelica"" in the movie ), who comes from a talented acting family, makes a nice supporting role in this movie, this movie was shot mostly with amateur actors whom had never even been in front of a camera before. Their performances are simply amazing!

I found the film sickening and revolting in the extreme.

1923490,5,B0000D9PNX,"This movie, City Of God (2002) is a gritty, shocking, straight up horrifying portrayal of life in the City of God, which is in Rio De Janiero. It doesn't tone down on the violence, the cursing, or the gunplay at any moment, making it all too realistic. You can't have a weak stomach to watch this movie. You also have to have the ability to read (which means no illiterate people can possibly view this movie, that don't speak Portugese). Yes, the movie is subtitled. Does any of this take away from the fact that this movie is possibly one of the best films ever made? No. City of God has the power to just draw the viewer in, despite it's 2 hour+ length. The stories that the main character, ""Rocket"", tells in here all flow together with ease, so the viewer most likely will not get lost through the 3 or 4 different stories that Rocket tells, for they all fit together like a puzzle.

As I've said, the main character is ""Rocket"". To tell the story of The City Of God, he must first tell the story of the Tender Trio, and then he goes on to the story of the Apartment, Lil Ze, & Knockout Ned. All of the stories he tells, as I've said before, tie in together some how. This is a very brutal movie, as many others have said. The violence adds to the realism of the movie though. It's not toned down to appeal to an overall audience like other stories. The story spans about 15, 20 years I think. It starts at the end, oddly, and Rocket starts thinking back to when he was a child. From there, he tells the story of the Tender Trio holding up a hotel, and all hell starts from there. By the end, there is an all out war. Still, besides the massive bloodshed and the major amount of guns and drugs you see in the movie, it's still worth your time. It's very captivating, it keeps you in your seat all throughout. (To note, since you have to read the whole movie, it  actually kept my older brother interested, and he hates reading anything including subtitles so if that doesn't say something...)

The actors can act, despite the fact that basically all of them have no experience, as most of them are actual residents of the City Of God. This also adds to the realism of the film. The acting is superb, so there should be no worries there. Nobody really overacts or underacts. They all add to their character in their own way, which makes a film that much better. They all leave their own special mark, even in characters that don't play a big part in the movie. So the acting and cast definitley gets an A plus in my book.

This is definitly a movie you should pick up. It's well worth the 30 DOLLARS that I paid for it on DVD. Especially if you like gangster or crime movies, then this is a great film you should see. I think even if you're not a big gangster fan, you would still like this movie if you could get past the violence. Don't let the violence keep you from viewing a great movie. It's powerful, compelling, and somewhat surprising to really see what goes on in foreign places like Rio De Janeiro. So pick this movie up when you see it. It's truly worth the 5 stars and more that I gave it.",1124409600,2,3106,4.250423011844331
1923491,5,B0000D9PNX,"It's not unusual for foreign filmmakers to include non-professional actors in their movies, and the concept is even more rare for American films.  Director Fernando Meirelles had a crew scour communities around Rio de Janeiro, including institutes, schools, etc., for children with characteristics, funny face, aggressive, sad, etc., kids who lived the life in Brazil

Based on a book, City of God, features children who grow up in violent to the extreme, drug-infested war.  The familiarity we have with children of the streets, beggars, prostitutes, thugs, drug-users, violence imposed upon them, is a far cry from children of the streets who kill other children.  Simple as that - gun-toting children killing children.

The movie is told through a narrator who takes us back to the 60's, 70's and 80's.  A young man sets out to be a photographer where youth die plenty.  The movie is loud and about a constantly brutal society with gangs and drug lords.

Gory violence is as old as time began, and in many parts of the world.  We just don't know too much about it.  We grow up on TV/movie violence, immune to it, and we know what to expect.  Here, you will see what life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro is like, where lives have no meaning.

This is a fast-paced movie with lots of dialogue, numerous characters, and many children.  It is filled with crude and violent scenes. Watching this foreign movie with subtitles may prove difficult to read as it moves quickly.  It's hard to grab everything and yet try to recognize its characters and their stories.

DVD bonus:  What is especially important to view is the documentary that takes place in Rio de Janeiro, life on the streets of the drug war.  This is a critical view to comprehend the movie you will see.

City of god is about so many different topics but mostly it represents the reality of the streets in these towns of Brazil. I still amazed that many people in the U.S. and some other parts of the World do not want to believe that places like these are a reality.
This movie should be consider a must see even if you do not agree it is great. Why?
City of god is a movie directed by a somehow experimented director that decided to recreate the scenes in the real place of the events by the real actors.
I guess it was not easy to film in a location where everybody will be afraid to visit because there is no order or law.
The actors in the movie are the children and teenagers from the streets, but they get to be natural since Brazilians have proved to be natural at acting. (You can watch Central Station and you will see the little kid which is also taken from the streets without previous acting experience to be in charge of most of the action of this excellent film)

1923496,4,B0000D9PNX,"This has to be among the most visually arresting films I have seen and almost as certainly one of the most alternately depressing and energetic. Filmmaker Fernando Meirelles, along with co-director Ktia Lund, provides a surreal, kinetic energy to a gritty story about an ironically named ghetto called Cidade de Deus (City of God) over the course of what appears to be fifteen years or so. Like me, you may recognize elements of past Hollywood films ranging from William Wyler's ""Dead End"" to Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" to Brian de Palma's version of ""Scarface"" to Walter Hill's ""The Warriors"" to even Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins' ""West Side Story"". But the synthesis digs much deeper into a world completely its own, the harrowing world of the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, a mere bus ride away from the city's world renowned beaches and resort hotels but far enough away not to be recognizable hopefully to any cautious foreign tourist. It's a vividly rendered portrait of a band of lost, amoral children that draws you in while keeping you at arm's length by the audacity of the story turns.

Like some of its cinematic predecessors, this 2002 movie is not really a heavy-handed morality tale but more a slick, almost pulpish gangster epic focused on a pint-sized psychopath named Li'l Dice who turns into the City of God's drug lord and crime boss, Li'l Z. I frankly don't know which is the more scarifying portrayal - young Douglas Silva who plays Li'l Dice with chilling calm, especially in a motel shooting spree that will leave you grimacing in agony, or Leandro Firmino da Hora's menacing wolf grin, unrelenting nihilism and psychotic social ineptitude as Li'l Z. The film's narrator, however, is the actual protagonist of the story, an aspiring photographer named Rocket (played with halting conviction by Alexandre Rodrigues), who prefers being on the periphery and wants desperately to escape the favela. The story flashes back and forth with fluidity from the 1960's when a cocky teenaged group called the ""Tender Trio"" ruled the neighborhood by holding up gas trucks to the 1970's when little children carried guns with alarming alacrity. In fact, there are few scenes as brutally harrowing as the one where Li'l Z forces a child named Steak-n-Fries to choose between two smaller children for maiming and ultimately killing. However, it would be too pat to label the film as violently exploitative, as Meirelles and Lund exhibit such life-force vitality and visual flourish in nearly every shot. For example, the opening chicken slaughter scene, with its quick cuts and gyrating salsa music, is alternately squeamish and enthralling, while the extended disco sequence uses strobe lights to powerfully dramatic effect.

There are other key characters that weave into the main fabric of the plot - Li'l Z's more emotionally secure confidante, Ben (Phellipe Haagensen); Carrot, a rival drug lord nobody seems to trust (Matheus Nachtergale); and most intriguing, a pacifist ex-soldier named Knockout Ned (played charismatically by Seu Jorge, the Bowie-strumming crew member in Wes Anderson's ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"") who goes from bus token attendant to favela hero in a steely, jealousy-ridden showdown with Li'l Z. It seems inevitable that a huge gun battle pulls all the story threads together, and it does so effectively thanks to a perceptive screenplay by Braulio Mantovani, who knows not to cross the border into contrivance. The DVD includes an hour-long documentary, ""News From a Personal War"" even more depressing than the movie in showing the real-life corruption infiltrating not only the favelas but the government and the rich as well.

1923509,5,B0000D9PNX,"It seems that repressed societies and low socio-economic environments provide an excellent backdrop, or impetus, for unique artistic and creative achievement.

This is evident in music i.e. Bob Marley hailed from the ghettos of Trenchtown, and The Beatles came from industrial Liverpool, but the above point is with particular reference to film making.

Films that highlight the detrimental impact of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, the mass murder of Tutsis in Rwanda, the election process in Iran, or Eastern European women being sold into prostitution, all have one thing in common:  They serve to open our eyes, and very often - hit home hard.  These stories of suffering, hardship and turmoil transcend any particular place and region because they all relate to the human condition.

Fernando Meirelles' ""City of God"" is one such example.  Set against the impoverished backdrop of the Brazilian `favelas' or ghettos, it's a vivid and powerful piece of film making that highlights social ills and the struggle of conscience.

Based on a true story, ""City of God"" provides an insight into the lives of characters that all emerge from similar backgrounds, their resulting attitudes, and the different choices they make.  The film culminates on the streets of Rio De Janeiro's slums in the 1970s, where drugs, corruption, and crime are rampant, and the value for human life is practically non-existent.

The movie also importantly demonstrates the cyclical nature of life in such extreme and under-privileged conditions.  The children of these slums (or ""Runts"" as they are referred to in the film) take to crime at an early age and are more concerned with getting hold of guns than going to school.  There are exceptions, but for the majority of children born into this particular environment, a life of easy money in dealing drugs and robbing others far outweighs the incentive of an education and working an honest job.

Beautifully made and splendidly acted, this will keep you glued to the screen and prove to be an exhilarating film experience.",1115769600,15,2054,5.135135135135135
1923510,5,B0000D9PNX,"""City of God"" (""Cidade de Deus"") is the story of a boy, but also the story of a ""favela"" (Portuguese word with similar meaning to slum or shantytown) on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. That shantytown is called ""Cidade de Deus"". Throughout this extraordinary movie both the boy and the favela grow, albeit obviously in very different ways  :)

The boy is Rocket (Buscap in Portuguese, played by Alexandre Rodrigues), who is born in Cidade de Deus and grows up before our eyes living in it. He is quiet and easygoing, just a non-violent person seeking a way to survive in a brutal environment. Rocket ends up doing exactly that through his passion, photography, that ends up making him an intermediary between the local gangs and the press. He is also the narrator of this movie, the voice that accompanies us throughout many of the stories that ""City of God"" has to offer...

The other main character of ""City of God"" is the ""city"" itself, that starts merely as a couple of houses, but that grows immensely as years go by. The activities in which its inhabitants are involved also change, from petty robbery to organized crime that involves drug dealing and arms trafficking. We see Li'l Z (Z Pequeno in Portuguese, played by Leandro Frimino), one of the boys that used to play soccer with Rocket, grow up to become a murderer and a drug lord, someone that makes his own laws. The same happened with others, but Li'l Z probably represents to most dangerous kind of sociopath that the favela can produce. Rocket and Li'l Z, same circumstances, different persons, different choices. Who says that where you lives determinates how you are and what you do?. This is an excellent example that that is not always the case...

Directors Fernando Meirelles and Ktia Lund somehow managed to convey in their movie the full strenght of the novel (written by Paulo Lins) on which ""City of God"" is based. This film is full of colour and energy, carrying the spectator at a dizzying pace through the twenty years it covers, never giving him time to get bored. It is wortwhile to point out that most of the ""actors"" didn't have any real experience as such, they just happened to live in different slums of Rio de Janeiro (including Cidade de Deus) at the time when the film was being made. I think that is something that shows in the realism of the results...

On the whole, I can say that I loved ""City of God"", notwithstanding the fact that it is undeniably bloody and has some very violent scenes. In my opinion, they are not gratuitous, because they help the directors to capture what may really happen in a Brazilian shantytown, and show it to us. All in all, this movie is nothing short of an experience worth having and sharing. If you watch ""City of God"" and love it as much as I do, do your part and recommend it to others  :)

1923511,5,B0000D9PNX,"The stark and incredulously filmed English subtitled Brazilian offering ""City of God"" is a realistic portrayal of the horrors of living in the notorious City of God slum of Rio de Janeiro.  Poverty is widespread and crime is rampant as people attempt to scratch out an existence there.

The movie focuses on the exploits of two vastly different inhabitants of this hellhole.  Rocket is a good kid living outside of the drug and weapons fueled gangs of the slum and aspires to be a journalistic photographer.  L'il Ze is a youthful and homicidal leader of the most feared gang that rules the City of God slum.  Status is achieved through fear and violence.  Kids are recruited at a young age and are implored to steal, peddle drugs and brandish and use weapons.

The flick chronicles approximately 10-15 years in the lives of the main characters who are unknown (to me) Brazilian actors.  They grow up in the squalid conditions and can't seem to escape the clutches of the slum.  Conditions eventually deteriorate as L'il Ze's gang tries to take over the turf of a rival gang leader Carrot.  Many gang members are killed while the corrupt police look the other way.  Rocket who is trusted by all those in the slum is allowed to take pictures of the goings on.  His photos tell an appalling story of corruption, violence and ultimately his own deliverance.

The cinematography of the flick is masterful and greatly aids in telling this hard to fathom story.  It's pseudo-documentary style, courtesy of director Fernando Meirelles works well in spinning this depressing tale.",1114646400,4,1572,4.860902255639098

I'm not one to say that these folks have ""missed the point"" or that their opinions are wrong. But if you're looking over these reviews to get an accurate reflection of the quality of this film, it might be helpful to remember that the bad reviews are almost certainly borne of a base or instinctive emotional response. It seems a bit paradoxical that the primary purpose of dramatic art -- that response -- would be the primary reason for panning a movie. (For comparison's sake, I thought ""Natural Born Killers"" was just stupid.)

1923515,5,B0000D9PNX,"I put off seeing this film for a long time for fear that the violence would be unbearable.  What is most remarkable is that I don't remember specific scenes of violence; I remember the overall violence of the film.  Sometimes extreme graphic violence causes us to miss the content.  This one nails the content.

The backdrop is the violent world into which these characters are ghettoized and how that ghetto breeds the 'City of God', where even the police rarely tread.  The story revolves around Rocket, non-violent amongst the violent, a young boy who seeks liberation from this world through other means.

I cannot comment enough on the cinematography.  The visual virtuosity and the musical score are so intertwined, it is one continuous viscerally stunning film.  Not one moment of dialogue is wasted, not one character is in excess, not one scene is irrelevant.  There are many characters and many underlying plots occurring simultaneously yet not once did I cease to follow.  The characters all appear real.

The storyline is tight and builds to a climax that will kind of linger with you for days and weeks after.  It's a film you just won't forget.  It is a striking film and will bring that world as close to your doorstep without getting burnt as you'll most likely ever get.  Do not miss this film.",1111190400,3,1311,4.794642857142857
1923516,5,B0000D9PNX,"""City of God"" is one of those rare films that knocks your socks off, tearing aside the dominant blessed-by-the-Chamber-of-Commerce image of Rio and showing the unvarnished, near-barbaric reality of Brazil's poorest slums.  This is a movie that stays with you for a long, long time.

""City of God"" tells the story of Rocket, a young Brazilian who lives in the City of God, a squalid, arid government-built housing project where money is scarce and hope even more so.  There seem to be two possible avenues for its residents -- become a gangster, or take a terrible job (like a propane delivery man) and be the target of the gangsters.  Opening with an audacious scene involving a chicken, a budding gang war, and a young photographer, ""City of God"" spins an epic yarn of survival, despair, and anger.

In addition to some daring camera-work, ""City of God"" benefits from a cast of non-professional actors -- we are constantly under the impression that we're watching real people rather than actors going through the motions.  This was a daring choice, but a lot of truth is conveyed through these ""amateur"" performances.  The film also adopts a grainy, under-produced look -- many scenes are filmed in the daylight and seem half-improvised, further heightening the impression that we are watching a documentary -- sort of a hellish ""Hoop Dreams.""

As a young boy, Rocket sees his older brother and his friends live a life of petty crime, only to see this hapless trio get toppled by Rocket's two best friends, Benny and Li'l Ze.  Benny and Li'l Ze don't rise to power through any great genius - all it takes in the City of God to become the top gangster is to be willing to shoot anybody, anywhere.  Life in the City of God is definitely cheap, and some of the most difficult scenes in the film stem from the ease with which kids (and I mean kids, not teenagers as near adults) obtain and use guns.

Rocket stays just outside the criminal life, and decides to become a photographer.  His camera is a shield of sorts, protecting him from some of the worst gang violence.  By the end of the film, Rocket has seen as much action as any combat photographer, and he has done so in his home.  That is more than any child should have to bear.  But as the movie's final scene tells us, the problem is still rampant, and the world is shamed as a result.

Audacious, original and true, ""City of God"" is one of the best films you will see, and is a must for the film library.

The DVD doesn't offer very much.  There does not appear to be a dubbed soundtrack, so you will have to use subtitles -- but this is a strength, heightening the realistic, documentary feel of the picture.  Get this DVD for the movie, not the extras.",1110931200,3,2712,4.554639175257732

a) Work hard for next to no wages and die broken

b) Be a hood and of course die in a hail of gunfire

And I also thought it was some kind of grainy documentary. Well, it's nothing of the sort. It's a polished, highly-professional, well-written, brilliantly directed and edited film.

It's a story covering almost thirty years in the slums of Rio. It follows the lives of several people from boyhood to their violent deaths. One of these boys escapes. It is told from the perspective of this boy, Rocket, who wants to become a photo-journalist, and it is told in a easy-to-follow non-linear way which works perfectly. This is high art and great craft. Be ready for some blood, but also be aware that there are both touching and humorous moments scattered in amongst the ever-escalating scenes of violence in the favelas of Rio.

Many have compared it to Hollywood's crime dramas (Goodfellas, etc).  This is not only inappropriate, but an unfair comparison.  Goodfellas is based in a time and place much different from Rio's slums.  The setting is richer and less violent, and the murder rates prove it.  So for those who think that the violence in the movie is exaggerated, take it from a person who grew up in the world's most murderous city (Medellin, Colombia which has its share of shantytowns) and who has visisted Rio's favelas: City of God is Rio de Janerio's reflection upon itself, a fair, accurate critique of the urban decay, crime and corruption that are widespread in Latin America.  Crime rates in Rio are many times higher than they are in ghettos in the US, which would explain American buyers' reactions to the film along the lines of: ""this is so exaggerated"".  In Colombia, i have had scores of friends murdered at the hands of criminals.  Please understand that this movie was the first I have seen that truly depicted violence in South America, despite some people's claims that it is unrealistic.

Future buyers should not expect this to be a Hollywood movie with good guys and bad guys.  They should expect the reality of life in the world's most violent ghettos and embrace it.  Most people who can afford DVD players have no idea what life is like for people in the 3rd world, and City of God is their opportunity to understand this lifestyle.

1923533,5,B0000D9PNX,"My younger brother hates the current crop of movies released by Hollywood and dismisses them as ""routine and predictable"".  However, on a flight to Thailand, he screened this film and was awestruck.  When he tells me to see a particular movie, usually it's with good reason.  ""City of God"" is a film bursting with life and momentum.  Director Fernando Meirelles has a visual style reminisent of Martin Scorsese's gangster epics, ""Goodfellas"" & ""Gangs of New York"".  It tells the story over a 20 year period about two kids from Rio's slums (The other side of the picture postcard we're so accustomed to seeing from Rio de Janiero.).  One who wants to desperately get out, one who wants to rule with an iron hand.  The movie is violent, but it is powerful and with good reason.  This is the way life is to the residents of the slum.  It's a classic story of good and evil, truth or consequences, living and dying.  The young stars of this film are outstanding and memorable.  They will stay with you for some time.  The music is great as well, mixing Brazilian pop with American R&B standards.  This will be in my movie collection for years to come.

But this film is truly unique from its inventive filming, exceptional acting, and vivid scenery to its daring content about a young man making it as a photogrpaher during a gang war in Rio de Janiero. It is a raw, graphic film with disturbing sequences. There is no reprieve from the horrific truth. But for those of us who thrive on riveting stories, it couldn't get better if it had been made-up.

I wouldn't say it's my favorite film, but to say I've ever seen one quite its equal or anywhere as unique or perfectly made would be a falsehood. I highly recommend it as it is such a rare expefrience to witness such perfection, but be warned that a strong stomach for injustice and violence (some against children) is a must.",1105747200,4,796,4.489655172413793
1923537,5,B0000D9PNX,"Rio de Janiero's notorious slums can scarecely have been documented in such a graphic, gruesome, close up manner as this. Directors Fernando Meirelles and Katrina Lund took on a phenomenally ambitious project in filming several intertwined stories of the favelas over a three decade timespan. The opening shots are of a chicken, running and squawking dementedly down alleyways and across streets in a desperate attempt to avoid capture and death. Thus we are introduced sharply into the dust, colour, head, sweat and amoral violence of the favela gang world. In a sense the plight of the chicken is a metaphor for the kids in the slums - escape, kill, or be killed.

City of God makes for tough viewing but such an approach is necessary to portray the culture of the favelas in a realistic and unsentimental fashion. The action is non linear and relentless - it flashes by and flashes back frequently in order to explain the build up to certain events. At times it is confusing but persevere, it is worth it.

The stories are poignant ones. In the 1960s, we are introduced to Rocket, a sensitive kid and his contemporary Lil Dice. Lil Dice later becomes Lil Z - notorious drug dealer and gang lord. He gratuitously rapes the girlfriend of Knockout Ned who, hell bent on revenge, sides with Lil Z's principal opponent - Carrot. By the 1980s, the two gangs are tearing the city apart.

Get the picture? That fragment of the plot is typical of the themes explored in City of God. This is no Hollywood piece of polished, shiny cinema. The majority of the actors used were non professional and real favela children feature widely in the movie to create an ultra-realistic picture of the slums. And a sadistic picture it is. One of the more horrifying moments of the film is the scene where two whimpering favela kids are taunted with verbal humiliation and live bullets, then one of them is subsequently casually and dispassionately murdered by a member of Lil Z's gang. In another scene Lil Z briskly shoots his second in command for talking too much.

Where do the police feature in all of this? - they are outgunned too, unable to stop the carnage. Life in the slums is Hobbesian indeed - very nasty, very brutish and generally, very short.

But City of God is not merely an excercise in portraying sadistic gang murder in close up. In such inauspicious surroundings, hope does flourish in the character of Rocket. His sensitive personna leads him to discover photography and, beginning with a cheap camera, he starts by becoming the gang's official photographer. Ultimately, his talent flourishes as his pictures of gang killings feature on the front page of the daily newspapers. He loses his virginity too to a hot photographic assistant. The sensitive guy comes good in the end, so it's not a total whitewash victory for the those with hard ammunition and low morals.

But the ultimate and lingering message of City of God is bleak indeed. We sense that we are looking through a window into a certain period of time at a certain group of favela youths. There is no sign that the violence terminates neatly at the end of the movie, nor tommorrow, nor next week, nor next month, nor ever. The impoverished on the fringes of society living in squalid slums in Rio carry on as they do, trapped in a perpetual cycle of dog eat dog brutality.

One favela kid sums up the plight of them all - 'what do you mean, I'm a kid, I kill, I rob, I'm a man!'. No place for adults in the City of God. Most of them don't live that long.",1105660800,4,3520,4.631410256410256

When violence is the only way out and the government has fogotten about you, where do you draw the line?
When watching this film, it is not hard to see why it was used as a peice of political propoganda for both sides of the recent Brazilian election. It exposes the absolute underbelly of Rio, and its style is so close to documentary that it could clearly have been shot in the City Of God (although the area is to dangerous to film in). The entirty of the film is summed up in the Tender Trio's claim near the beginning of the film, that they will never get out of the slums by robbing gas trucks. They, debatably, deem themselves too 'stupid' to work legitimatly. Meirelle's method of using ""kids from the hood"" who were not trained actors adds to the absolute realism of the peice, and his upfront, blatent approach is informative in the utmost, if not a little disturbing. It's shocking to see that the only optimism these children can get is through a path tainted by the blood of their neighbours.",1105401600,2,1198,4.474885844748859
1923539,5,B0000D9PNX,"What's most remarkable about this film is how dramatically similar the circumstances and conditions are to those that are present in Los Angeles, Guatemala City, New York, Port Au Prince, Chicago, Miami, Mexico City, San Pedro Sula, New Orleans, Baghdad, Palestine, Johannesburg, Bombay, etc. The tragic brilliance of this film is that it's not a unique or even original story at all.

City of God, the film, depicts the same hell that is described so vividly in the so-called ""Gangsta Rap"" from African American and Latin American youth and in it's peer art forms elsewhere around the world (e.g., Ragga/Dancehall). City of God, the housing project, is simply one in millions of similar housing ""projects"" (experiments) that create horrendous conditions that simultaneously stretch and degrade human imagination to degrees that result in a shocking devaluation of all life.

For some strange, sad reason, poor people of color suffer similar recurring tragedies and pathologies that are far more complex than the typical ""they are animals, imprison them"" socio-reduction of reactionaries and conservatives and aren't nearly as 'romantic' as some apologists and liberals might have us believe.

I watch films like City of God, Menace II Society, Pixote, Salaam Bombay, Carlito's Way, New Jersey Drive, etc. not just for entertainment, but in the hopes extracting gems from the storytelling and getting closer to understanding why some people make the choices they make, and in the hopes of discovering why it always seems to be the poor Black and Brown people who die in the streets.",1104192000,6,1582,5.24505928853755

1923544,5,B0000D9PNX,"City of God is a masterpiece. An amalgam of everything good in Goodfellas, Traffic and Pulp Fiction, wrap it up with technical innovation found in Fight Club, an inciendary subject matter, a cast of unknowns and you've got one of the best films ever.

Based on a true story and told through the eyes of Rocket, a youth growing up the favela known as City of God, the movie essentially chronicles the drug trade and gang wars that shaped the said slum, while relating the back stories of each person involved in a very fresh approach. Director Mereilles really took care to have the audience emphatize with the lives of the characters, introducing them in innocous fashion, so when they show up later doing violent things or being major catalyts in the story, you really feel the impact.

Violence produces more violence is the central theme of the movie. We see various lives of City of God denizens change because of acts violence that interconnects their lives. From the Tender Trio which led to the rise of L'il Dice (later as L'il Ze) which led to the turf wars with Carrot (another dealer) to the death of Benny (the coolest gangster in town, as the residents put it) to the entry of Knockabout Ned to the gangs and his eventual death, each is linked by a particular violent event which was caused by one's violence against another. Hence, a vicious cycle.

There are some really hard-to-watch scenes like the initiation of a kid named Steak N Fries. But Mereilles shows tremendous care in handling such a gut-wrenching scene. However, he pulls no stops in capturing the energy and chaos of a Brazilian favela. Despite the subject matter, the overall tone is brisk, sometimes darkly hilarious (especially with the deranged Eddie Griffin look-alike L'il Ze) almost Scorsese like but it is told with more technical aplomb. There are several impressive sequences (The history of the apartment, Rocket's introduction) that left me speechless.

The DVD also has an hour long documentary entitled ""Scenes From A Personal War"". A very informative and enlightening piece of work, it serves as a nice companion piece. However, even though it is loaded with insights to Brazilian favela life, the way it is presented and edited, it pales in comparison. Rambling and lethargically-paced, it is dragging especially if you watch it after the energetic main feature.  Still, don't let this prevent you from getting the most entertaining fact-based movie of the year.",1102896000,6,2457,4.910843373493976

Rese&ntilde;a Cr&iacute;tica

Ciudad De Deus

 La pel&iacute;cula Ciudad De Deus es un poderosa y sincera cuento de horror con hechos real.  El cuento empieza en 1960's, cuando el gobierno de Brazil se mueven los pobres a un &aacute;rea fuera de la ciudad para no ruina la imagen de la ciudad.  La polic&iacute;a no va a las calles que producen una ciudad con muchas drogas, pistolas, crimen, y pandillas.  El protagonista en Ciudad de Deus no es una persona, es un lugar muy peligroso.  En esta ciudad hay una guerra civil.  La pel&iacute;cula tiene dos personajes principales que toman caminos muy diferentes.  El personaje principal, Rocket, es un joven cuya pasi&oacute;n es la fotograf&iacute;a.  Rocket narra la historia de unos muchachos que se convirtieron en narcotraficantes en la Ciudad de Dios.  Li'l Dice o Z&eacute; es otro personaje principal que se entrega a una vida de violencia a los 10 a&ntilde;os, comenzando con robos para luego dedicarse al tr&aacute;fico de drogas.  Este es un personaje cruel, que a menudo asesina a inocentes en sus ataques de c&oacute;lera.  Con el paso de los a&ntilde;os, Z&eacute; organiza una pandilla narcotraficante y pone a otros ni&ntilde;os a trabajar para &eacute;l, algunos de los cuales tienen apenas 7 a&ntilde;os de edad.

 El director de este pel&iacute;cula no usan actores en cambio usan ni&ntilde;os que viven en este realidad.  La pel&iacute;cula es imitativo de los efectos de coca&iacute;na por de salto desde un car&aacute;cter al otro.  Ciudad De Deus critica sociedad por permiten lugares como esta a existir, pero nunca excusa la conducta de los caracteres.  La pel&iacute;cula tiene forma circular porque primero es en el presente luego en la conciencia de Rocket y luego regreso al presente.  Ciudad De Deus empieza en 1960 y termino en 1980.  El objetivo de esta pel&iacute;cula es consientizacion, demontre la vida de la mayor&iacute;a (pobres).

 Para mi este pel&iacute;cula representa una situaci&oacute;n muy realista y violenta.  No hay estabilidad en la estilo de pel&iacute;cula, las escenas son muy cortes y cambian muy r&aacute;pida.  Este estilo representa caos, el caos en la Ciudad De Deus.  La lucha por poder aparece en todos los escenas.  Que horrible los pobres luchan contra los pobres.  Es evidente que Rocket no quiere ser parte de los pandillas y quiere trabaja legitimo, quiere escapa este vida.  Pienso que el director quiere sociedad a toman acci&oacute;n, como Rocket, porque en el final de la pel&iacute;cula aparece el pandilla nueva.  Esta pandilla es m&aacute;s violenta y cruel.  El autor est&aacute;n demostrado el futuro, mas lleno de caos.  Me gusta este pel&iacute;cula mucho y creo que este pel&iacute;cula ense&ntilde;a el mundo sobre los problemas que nosotros no quiere ver.",1102550400,,2818,5.260674157303371
1923548,5,B0000D9PNX,"That is the only way that I can describe this movie.

Told from first person narration, you are taken on a wild, scary, funny, tragic and intense ride through the streets of a slum in Rio De Janiero.  This movie is the story of 1 boy, who watches as those close to him are lured into the hoodlum life of the streets.

The movie spans thru 3 decades and is wonderfully told.  It is not in sequential order, so paying attention to every part is critical.

I must warn, this movie is extremly violent and involves children as the culprits of violence we would, as Americans, would have trouble stomaching even if done by adults.

Excellent movie, I only wish that there were more like it!!",1102377600,2,686,4.404761904761905
1923549,5,B0000D9PNX,"The movie centers around the Brazillian ghetto in the '60s, '70s, and '80s. It tells the story of how drugs and gang warfare run in Rio de Jenario. It also adds the slum and poverty life of everyone that lives there and the corruption of law enforcement. The story is told through the eyes of a young boy named Rocket. Our protagonist also has a few friends to tell about, but the other key character would be the young and ruthless hoodlum named Lil' Dice. Rocket dreams of leaving the city to pursue a career in photography. Lil' Dice on the other hand wants to run the City of God, become a powerful gang leader, and make money by dealing drugs.

I'd say more, but I fear I'll give away just about everything about the movie. The movie is just... so damn real. It's almost like watching a documentary unfold. The most sickening and disturbing parts of the movie are seeing kids holding guns. Now, that may look harmless since we see kids hold guns on tv, but it's painfully gut-wrenching to see kids kill people, including other kids... and they enjoy the killing. It's also disturbing to see kids using drugs (marijuana and cocaine). Oh yeah, the kids also are drug dealers as well. This seems to be the only way for those kids to gain the dream of becoming rich and powerful.

The movie is like a mixture of other gang type movies like ""Scarface,"" ""Menace II Society,"" ""Boyz in the Hood,"" and ""Gangs of New York."" If you loved one, two, or all of those movies, ""City of God"" will certainly please you, despite the fact that it has subtitles. It's a powerful and emotional movie that'll probably move you to tears or just simply make you sick to your stomach.

""City of God"" also has more of a Tarantino-filmmaking style with its non-linear chronological storytelling (think ""Reservoir Dogs,"" meaning the plot still unfolds but adds background to several characters, pausing the plotline at times). The camera is kinda shaky and jittery, but it adds realism to the movie's storyline and images.

""City of God"" often is criticized because some dumbass critics see it as a movie that ""glorifies violence."" No, it doesn't. ""Natural Born Killers"" did that, but not ""City of God"" because it shows the violence as it is in that part of the world. And I would say that this movie isn't very violent at all. Sure, there's plenty of action scenes where some people get killed, but most of the time it doesn't even show the people getting shot/killed. Think of how some people were ""disgusted"" at the infamous chainsaw scene in ""Scarface."" They didn't show limbs being chopped off, just blood squirting out. The rest is left to our imagination.

This movie certainly gives us a gritty and disturbing look at this Brazillian city. People may still hate this movie because of its content, but for crying out loud, take off your blinders and see the world as it is: a cruel and dangerous place. ""City of God"" shows the life as it is not only in Brazil, but everywhere else in the world, including our very own country.",1102032000,4,3009,4.595903165735568

Though it was a strange comparison, the film does have the overtones of the Scorsese masterpiece, and the dizzying and beautiful stylisms of Baz Luhrmann's groundbreaking display of MTV style editing.

City of God has so many different elements, and goes through so many emotions, that I really felt that I got more than my moneys worth with this ticket.

1923552,5,B0000D9PNX,"The film revolves around the, ""City of God,"" a favela (or ghetto) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a horrifying area where drug dealers run the community, and where children killing children is not an uncommon occurrence.

The story begins with the early stages of the City of God (in the 1960's) showing where many of the problems stem from- the extreme poverty, overcrowding etc.  Here, in the early stages of the favela, we meet our main characters, along with the supporting cast.  The story revolves mainly around two characters living in the favela, Rocket and Lil Ze, and how they take two different paths through life.  Rocket's dream is to become a photographer and to escape the City of God while Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer.

The film offers an unflinching look at gang life in the City of God, as it follows the favela through three decades; the 60's, 70's and 80's, and shows how violence just spirals into more violence with the disturbingly high amounts of violence in the favela, most involving teenagers and children.

The direction, cinematography, and editing are all Oscar-worthy.  The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen- with a very visceral, jerky feel, very reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan.  The editing is very frantic, which makes you feel like you are on the streets of the City of God, and the direction is flawless, seamlessly blending the many elements of the story.

The film was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen.  The story, the direction, the cinematography, the editing and the acting all add up to make a excellent movie that I would recommend to all.

Although I can't speak a word of Portuguese, the acting was so real that I could completely understand what was going on.

I am glad to read that this movie sparked changes in Brazillian policy toward the poor.  While being poor is not a crime, this movie shows how poverty can lead to crime and an endless cycle of continued violence.

This is a great movie for wayward teenagers to watch, so that they can see with their own two eyes that crime does not pay - it only leads to a spiral of death and hopelessness.",1100476800,5,692,4.134328358208955

Fernando Meirelles, the director, brought an unsual style of flimmaking to the independent cinema.  Risk-taking shots, like the Pseudo-Matrix style revolving shot around ""Rocket"" at the beginning, helped bring a frantic pace and the feel of a life spent on the edge.

From one section to the next, it is challenging and difficult to care for a character, as they might find their end in the very next scene.  Yet, each character is humanized so well that it is impossible not to care for them.

It is a film full of tragedy, where the evil get what is deserved, yet the innocent find it impossible to escape the violence as well.  In the end, the only one to root for is Rocket, the photographer...the witness.  As one hopes that he will survive to tell the story of those who lived in the City of God.",1098835200,6,1037,4.5675675675675675

The movie is a graphic look of what the city of god (which is looked within Rio de Janerio)was like through out the 60's.  From the grittiest depiction of violience to the jaw dropping story line.  It is one of those movie which embodies you for the total 130mins, but also will make one think.  The story line of the movie is unlike most other movie, it has a fell that some one who lived in the city of god just sat down and told you a story.  The movie develops very fast through many different characters, that all link together is some way.

When one watches this wonderful movie, they will laugh, cry and get goose bumps, but will still come out thinking.  It is a great movie just don't be fant of heart, because the graphic violetion and depiction of poverty is almost crippling, but informitve and inspiring.

Some of them turn into poor workers while others turn into criminals; the movie shows in detail where exactly the paths diverge and what happens when they do, putting childhood friends at opposite sides of a war in the favela to dominate drug sales.

This movie is very focused on crude reality and raw emotion; we have a love story broken up by murder, hatred and vengeance, violence as a means to impose respect, and finally, hope.  There is a strong clash between the ideas that the environment shapes the man (as portrayed by Lil Ze, the kid who grows up to be the king of City of God and its main drug salesman) and the idea that one can keep a certain distance from it all and use manage not to get too influenced by the local morals (as portrayed by our narrator, who grows up to be a newspaper photographer after he uses his local knowledge to photograph killings).  Ultimately, we are faced with the reality that one man can't make all the difference, when our supposed hero throws away some pictures that implicate policemen, showing the limits to his morals.

This is the best movie I have seen coming from Brazil, but it is not one for the faint hearted.  I highly recommend it, it is a movie that will question your morals and ethical standards.",1095984000,5,1389,4.427450980392157

Yes, there's a lot of ""oh my God!"" moments.  But that's not necessarily what makes the movie so good.  It's a combination of a story that doesn't drift all too far from reality (Brasilian favelas are indeed not a pretty fun place to be, unbeknownst to many in the world), dynamic characters that CHANGE over time (imagine that), and excellent cinematography and storytelling. It's not linear, nor is it trying to be clever by jumbling up the timeline....it tells the story like a normal person would (a la, ""oh yeah, I forgot to tell you..."").  I will say that it won't appeal to everyone.  It's a pretty heavy flick to take in.

The violence and brutality is necessary in this film in order for the story to be told the way it was intended to. This film is a true depiction of an impoverished community where there are very few legitimate ways out and also very little value placed on human life. In the tradition of films like Francesco Rosi's ""Salvatore Giuliano"", City of God takes a true story and tells it with realistic acting and visionary film-making. After watching City Of God modern day film makers should really question their work and decide if they're really putting their talents to use for the better of humankind. It's about time film makers stopped entertaining and started to educate the viewer on injustices in this world. Hold off 300 million dollar productions of fantasy films and show the world some things that really need to be changed.

A young man, who is trying to jump over all the hurdles, which every young boy encounters in life. Everything from trying to be like his older brother, to losing his virginity.

  Rocket,supposedly one of the main characters,has a fascination with photography but it was taken as granted. The irony between shooting with a gun and shooting with a camera is not explored enough. So many of his photos are flukes like when he was invited to take pictures of Lil'ze and ended up as scoops. He was lucky he didn't get killed. Once,he was caught between Lil'ze's gang and the cops. He was turning his heads between them several times,not knowing what to do for quite a while. I was thinking this would be the last of him and too bad he didn't take a great picture. Once again,luck was on his side. He was too slow to be a photo-journalist but he became a pro too soon to be credible. Like when he followed the arrested Lil'ze only to discover that the cops were on the take. Was he a psychic?There is a problem with his character development.

  I think the popularity with this movie has to do with the gun culture in America. Many people feel that America is heading down this road and this movie is a wake-up call. When kids become urban guerillas,it is hard not to be moved.

1923574,4,B0000D9PNX,"NOTE: The following review may contain spoilers.

Actually, this review is more about the society that created the City of God rather than the movie itself. I was very touched and moved by this movie. It was compelling and heartbreaking to see a society in such a destructive manner. The fact that the main characters were teens and pre-teens(even younger) made this movie even more disturbing. It's very likely that these things did happen and are still happening since Brazilian and international sources place the number of homeless children in Brazil between 7 and 12 million.

Many viewers have blamed America in some way or other for Brazil's backwardness. I wouldn't since I've read alot about Brazil and realize that the governments and aristocracy that have controlled Brazil in the past have shown little sympathy for it's citizens. For example, the 1893 civil war, the 1915-1917 Contestado rebellion,and many other violent conflicts in Brazilian history should show you just how cruel the aristocracy was toward it's citizens.

These children do live in a violent world as shown in the 1993 massacre of eight street children(ages 11-19) by police, in front of the Candelaria Church in the center of Rio.

Many people complained about the movies camerawork, characterization, and the realism of the movie. I found all to be good. The camera work didn't bother me at all, in fact I felt much more a part of that movie than I would have been if it was in the usual Hollywood style. The individual characterization was average but the characterization as a society as a whole was good. So was the believability of the events that occured. If you watch this movie intently, you'll realize that these people could be anyone if they were born in that type of environment. Even the Olson Twins!

The subtitles didn't bother me because I have a quick eye. I wouldn't call this movie a masterpiece but I would call it brilliant. Shorter and much more believable than Lord of the Rings or Star Wars.",1092355200,,1999,4.867647058823529

1923577,5,B0000D9PNX,"I don't normally gush about movies such as this. I'm simply not a fan of ultra-violence. ""City of Dreams,"" however, deserves the accolades and the attention.

 It's odd that some critics blast this film for being too much like MTV, for being ""unrealistic."" Knowing many Brazilians, and having visited the country myself, I can safely say that ""City"" is closer to reality than many people would like to know. Even the current leader of Brazil has praised the movie. If you know someone who's lived in Brazil ask them about it or about the life of the impovershed in Sao Paulo or Rio. The added information will make the impact - the realism - of this film that much greater.

 The camera angles and editing are manic at times. It matches the mood of the film. Guns, violence, panic, passion, life and death. The story is not told in a straight line. Think Memento crossed with The English Patient with the storyline of Goodfellas and The Gangs of New York. For good measure add in a heavy dose of reality. The film depicts, at least in part, a true story and is (more importantly) quite factual in its overall depiction of the reality of gang and drug violence in Brazil. True, the pace of the movie is unrealistic, but what it actually shows us is not.

 On the DVD there's an added bonus of a documentary that looks at the entire hopelessness of the situation. Brutal gangsters, corrupt cops, violence, and a society that uses the whole sordid mess to control a huge impoverished populaton with no options. A senior member of the police with decades of experiences admits to all of this - states quite bluntly that the state must use this form of represssion in order to prevent chaos. He also points his finger at US and Swiss gun makers who send their weapons to Brazil to be used by the gangs. He points out that the US can send troops to Colombia to shut down the source of the drug trade in the US - why can't he come to the US and shut down Colt which sends AR-15s to Brazil? It's a legitimate point, one that will likely make some (especially US citizens) uncomfortable. While Brazilians are mostly to blame for their plight, it doesn't help that multinational corporations profit and manipulate the situation. They are part of the problem.

People die every few moments, and it sports a relentless, pumped-up, John-Woo-style gun-and-trouble worship which you can find in dozens of action flicks these days. It's flashy as hell, and not real.

1923582,5,B0000D9PNX,"I actually rented City of God from Netflix, but will probably be purchasing this in the near future.  I've seen many folks reference US made movies about the mafia or gang warfare in relation to City of God, but I think I totally disagree.  Yes, in a way City of God is the Brazilian version of a gang film, but it is more like watching a documentary on the evolution of gang/drug and crime problems in the hopeless slums of Brazil.  Unlike many of the gang films made in the US, City of God seems to be far more chaotic because the main characters are mostly all children, some of which are very young.  City of God actually features children and not 20 or 30 somethings that may look young.  The Runts in particular are both heartbreaking and loathsome at the same time, and are hard to watch because the actors are actually as young as 6.

There is far too many good things for me to identify, but three things really made this movie work for me. The first has to be the cinematography, which doesn't insult your eyes and take away from the movie with hyper-colorized visuals.  Second, the casting director deserves much credit in casting unknowns to play these characters, preserving a documentary feel to the movie.  Finally, the movie is structured around a well thought out narrative from Rocket, one of the main characters.  Starting in the 60's, the movie moves flawlessly into the 70's and also stops to tell the stories of a few main characters.  All this while never feeling disjointed or confusing.

Rocket is a very important role too, because he tells the story.  Don't be fooled, ""City of God"" isn't a gangster flick of an action movie.  It's a dramatic portrayal of life in the slums from a different direction.  Rocket deals with love, pain, betrayal, denial, and talent(he's a skilled photographer).
The scenes are haunting, but also beautiful in a way.  The scenes are realistic.  I won't give you the plot because you probably know what it's about if you're looking it up.

1923589,4,B0000D9PNX,"Cidade de Deus (Katia Lund and Fernando Meirelles, 2002)
Have you seen Matty Rich's first film, Straight Outta Brooklyn? Unless you frequent the film festival circuit or watch a good deal of public television, probably not. (Straight Outta Brooklyn was shown uncut on a local PTV station in 1994. It immediately made my 100-best list.) It got high marks at Sundance in 1991, played in New York City for a short run, then disappeared until PTV resurrected it. If you haven't seen it, you probably stand a better chance of stumbling upon Cidade de Deus, the highest-grossing Brazilian film of all time (while dollar figures for its native country are not available, over three million people went to see it during its run in its native country; in every foreign country where it screened it did more than twice its budget in box-office receipts, as well). You'll get the general idea. (But after you've been amazed by Cidade de Deus, go rent Straight Outta Brooklyn, as well.)
Perhaps the most impressive thing about Cidade de Deus is that it's a film about, really, nothing, but is still capable of holding the interest. It's a basic slice-of-life film, the plot of which (addressed only in a few scenes) is the desire of the main character, Rocket (first-time actor and actual Cidade de Deus resident Alexandre Rodrigues), to get out of Cidade de Deus, Rio de Janiero's worst, most violent slum. In trying to do so, we learn in the opening scene, he's managed to get into the middle of a gang war between Li'l Ze (Brazilian TV actor Leandro Firmino, who bears a disturbing resemblance to a young, thinner Zakes Mokae) and Carrot (Matheus Nachtergale of Central Station fame, who also worked with Firmino in the TV series Brava Gente). Despite the fact that Ze killed Rocket's brother years before, Rocket doesn't know what side to back, or whether he should just ditch the whole thing. Problem is, he tells us as the first five minutes roll by, he can't. (We don't find out why until near the end of the film). From there, we get into flashbacks of Rocket's life, and that of those around him, and these make up the bulk of the film.
Lund and Meirelles, who directed the episode of Brava Gente that became the seed of this film, imbue it with a stunning realism derived from their casting of a large number of actual Cidade de Deus residents, including many of the principal actors, filming on location (Meirelles was later to say that if he knew the danger they were all in throughout filming, he'd never have made the movie), and being exceptionally adaptable (a conversation between Rodrigues and Graziella Moretto, for example, that happened off-camera, was weaved into the story at the last minute; examples of this sort of thing can be found at many points in the film, and an extensive list of such can be found in the trivia section for the film at IMDB). Granted, this does not bode well for a number of film careers for the actors in the movie; they're basically playing themselves. (Rodrigues, who learned a good number of new skills during the film-- all the camerawork he is shown doing in the film is really his own work, for example, and he did direction and camerawork in a crucial piece of the movie's climax-- may be an exception to this.) But they do a fantastic job at playing themselves, for what it's worth. The intertwining stories that make up Rocket's early years are entertaining, though they do drag a bit at times; typical pacing problems for directors used to working in short forms. The makeup of the film itself, in its episodic nature, reminds the viewer of Pulp Fiction without ever seeming derivative of it. Which brings me to the rating. I'm not sure what the MPAA was smoking, but giving the film an R for ""strong brutal violence"" (as reported by IMDB) makes me think this movie was rated for American consumption by folks who have never seen Scarface, Pulp Fiction, Saving Private Ryan, or any ""horror"" film made in the past twenty years. (Any single minute of the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan or the closing scene of Audition, for example, contains more violence than all one hundred thirty minutes of Cidade de Deus.) There is violence, but it's nothing at all out of the ordinary; along the lines of what one would expect from a fifties hardboiled-detective mystery, say. The R is (perhaps) deserved for language, but the violence, which is neither ""strong"" nor ""brutal,"" deserves a PG-13 at best.
Cidade de Deus is a fine movie, and one that deserves to be seen. Those who might prefer a lighter touch on the violence might want to see Straight Outta Brooklyn first, but watch both of them over a weekend for a great back-to-back experience. I'm not terribly sure Ebert's view of this is one of the ten best movies ever made, or the IMDB public's view of it (as I write this, it sits at #128 on the IMDB top 250), but it's certainly worth renting, or catching in the theater if it pops up at a local art house. ****",1089158400,2,4964,4.648464163822526
1923590,5,B0000D9PNX,"I just watched this movie yesterday, and I can't get it out of my mind.  From the opening scene, it grabs you and doesn't let go.  It is a riveting portrayal of a brutal life in the slums as experienced by a young man struggling to escape it.
I just found out that these were not professional actors, and I can't believe it.  Perhaps my impression is skewed a bit because I was reading the subtitles, but I didn't think there was a single bad (even mediocre) performance.
The style of this film is superb.  Yes, there are definite parallels with Goodfellas, particularly in explaining (while not excusing) why these people choose a life of crime.  The narrative style, however, reminded me more of Tarrantino, with the non-linear chronology, and even ""chapter titles"" (a la Reservoir Dogs).
One word of warning, if you are averse to violence, this may be one to avoid--it is quite graphic.  Otherwise, this is an outstanding movie.  Highly recommended!",1088380800,4,952,4.7682926829268295

It does seem to have borrowed from ""Goodfellas"" in its narrative approach, but there is a much more kinetic quality to this movie, reminiscent of Tarantino movies, which Fernando Meirelles and Ktia Lund no doubt drew from in piecing together this kaliedoscopic image of the infamous ""City of God.""  I suppose this may be one reason this film found its mark with international audiences.  But, as powerful as this movie is, you don't really don't get much beyond the images of a city riddled with corruption, and the generation of street kids that grew up in this violent atmosphere.  Appropriately, the directors took the viewpoint of young Brazilian photographer who had grown up in this underworld and chose to record what he saw on film. The film also gains much from the candid performance of kids from the region, similar to Mira Nair's Salaam Bombay.",1088294400,3,1038,4.8474576271186445

1923603,5,B0000D9PNX,"""City of God"" is one of the most striking films in a long time, a magnificent, vibrant look at the slums and drug dens of Brazil, and the people who live there over the course of decades. While the camerawork can be kind of offputting, it's still an enthralling punch to the gut.
Cidade de Deus (City of God) is a 1960s Rio de Janeiro favela where the poor live so they won't dirty up the rest of the city. It's a rough place at best, and a horrible place at worst. And as children grow up, they're inexorably sucked into the cycle of drugs, theft, violence and starvation that is the lifeblood of the ""City of God.""
These are shown to us through three boys: Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), Li'l Z (Leandro Firmino) and Bene (Phellipe Haagensen). Li'l Z and Bene take the path to being criminals. Rocket, the narrator, dreams of turning his artistic bent into a job as a photographer. But in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, it's hard enough to pursue your dreams -- and even harder to avoid the violence around you.
It's almost impossible to watch ""City of God"" without feeling vaguely dazed. It basically lets us into the lives of a group of people who are being rapidly drawn downward, in a world where everybody is a criminal -- including preteen children. Just looking at it isn't enough -- the director lets us see it through innocent eyes, making what happens all the more shocking.
Fernando Meirelles does an outstanding job with the direction. It's dark, it's fast, it's a quick left to the jaw. He doesn't milk this for cheap sympathy, or sugarcoat it to make it easier to watch -- the scene where a sobbing young boy is cold-bloodedly shot by one of his peers is more horrifying than any fright flick. The one area where ""City of God"" stumbles is the camerawork and editing. At times it's a bit too MTV, with the shakycam.
Despite the fact that virtually nobody in this movie is a pro actor, the acting is very, very good. Rocket is the only truly innocent person in the whole movie, and Alexandre Rodrigues does a wonderful job with the little guy who dares to dream of a better life. Leandro Firmino is equally good as the drug lord who blithely sells his dark soul.
The vision of Rio de Janeiro's poorest districts is not just sobering, but often shocking to the relatively well-off American viewers. Bloody, dark and compelling, ""City of God"" is a masterpiece.",1087948800,4,2369,4.524475524475524
1923604,5,B0000D9PNX,"""City of God"" is an adrenaline jolt of a film that for once manages to find a balance between stylistics and substance. The director, Fernando Meirelles, stuffs his movie to the brim with machine-gun editing, swirling cinematography and pounding music, but while this reliance on fancy tricks has ruined other films, Meirelles is so expert at blending them seamlessly into an engrossing story that the viewer quickly accepts them as inseparable from the world of the film. He delivers a deeply emotional and human story that obviously owes much to Scorsese and Tarantino---but his movie feels completely original, never like a rip off.  And underneath all of the action and plotting, there is a compelling message about about the power of art (specifically the camera) and a suggestion that, just as the pen is mightier than the sword, the camera is mightier than the gun.
Can't recommend it enough.

1923605,4,B0000D9PNX,"When I saw this film in the theater I was seated in one of those smaller, 50-seat theaters, that make the viewing experience more intimate.  There were about 20 other people in there with me and by the time the credits were rolling everyone exited in stunned silence.  Either they were too tired from reading all the subtitles(this is a Brazilian film with English subtitles), or like me, shocked and a little giddy at having seen such a visceral film.  The direction here is inspired, and it is the reason why this film shines brighter than most foreign films.  For the unwary viewer I should warn you that there is a lot of violence in this film, most of it bloody gunfire.  Also, the camera-work(a lot of it hand-held and jerky, lending a real-time perspective) may leave the viewer a little dizzy at times.  One scene, in particular, happens during a shoot-out at a bank where the camera goes left then right at right angles quickly about five times, and I remember actually feeling a little disoriented.  But this film has some intensity that I haven't seen in a film since the early days of films by Martin Scorsese.  One positive aspect of this film is that the ""Culture Shock"" that is present in many foreign films is virtually absent here, perhaps and probably because of this director's American film influences such as Martin Scorsese's ""Mean Streets"" and certainly touches here and there(particularly in the editing department) of Mr. Scorsese's classic ""Goodfellas.""  At best, this film is enthralling and technically appealing; at its worst, it is violently jarring and perhaps overly ambitious.  In any case, it definitely worth seeing.  Thank you.",1087948800,,1663,4.882562277580071
1923606,5,B0000D9PNX,"The City of God is the ghetto just out of sight of the fashionable tourist-attraction portions of Rio de Janeiro. The children who play on the streets there dream about bettering their lives, and the lives of their own families - much as Americans are nudged towards ""The American Dream"".  But in the City of God the children have never had a hot shower, and their aspirations are only to join the gang most likely to come out on top of the gang wars that run end to end.
City of God is a powerful movie with incredibly vivid performances by a cast we are told are almost all non-professional actual residents of the real Cidade de Deus. The narrative is endlessly fascinating and many scenes interlock with scenes that occur in other places.  As a viewer I had a repeated sense of deja vu (calculated by the brilliant director Fernando Meirelles), similar to the sensation I felt watching another brilliant film: Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"".  Scenes are played out in their entirety with a particular character featured, then we will revisit the same narrative moment with the camera focused on an entirely different character, and we are allowed to see, if not into the minds of the characters, at least the circumstances that lead up to how they behave in a certain situation.  As innovative as those technically brilliant shots were in ""The Matrix"" - you know the ones I mean, the ones where several characters, and often bullets and other quickly moving objects, were slowly rotated in the perspective of a camera that enjoys the privilege of computer-generated freeze-frame.  The City of God does the equivalent of that mind-blowing technique, except it is done with the story.  The payoff of this technique is that we become more emotionally invested in the characters - and where many mainstream viewers would NOT identify with a murdering drug-dealer, we are led gradually into that world.  We meet ""Li'l Dice"" as a young man with a broad smile full of teeth and we could imagine him right down the street in our own neighborhood, hanging out on our street corner.  As The City of God progresses we see how this pre-adolescent grows into the most feared man in the worst neighborhoods we could imagine.
The film is visually arresting, emotionally involving and psychologically stunning.  Comparisons with Scorsese and Coppola are valid.  This is a virtuoso effort.",1087776000,2,2375,4.870967741935484
1923607,2,B0000D9PNX,"Seriously, some of the reviews here are a joke. This is Quentin Tarantino in Brazil, about as real as a ""gangsta"" video, and about as gritty as Steven Spielberg's recent pathetic attempts at serious cinema. Why anyone would think this collection of stupid video tricks surrounding non-characters would be masterpiece is beyond me. It's a film for critics, film students, and people who are eagerly awaiting Kill Bill vol. 3.
Every time an overhyped movie about street punks blasting each other comes along, there's always a horde of critics right behind it praising the director for his ""brutal honesty."" There's nothing even remotely honest about this film, and the brutality is about as affecting as newspaper article. It's like Disneyland for 10yr old gunpunks. Bam! Somebody dies. Bam! Somebody else dies. The only scene that had any emotional weight was where Lil Dice forces some 8yr old to shoot another 8yr old. If the entire movie had been like that it would have been brutal indeed. But the rest of the flick is your typical movie violence--sterile and emotionally flat. The viewpoint of a director who obviously never saw a street killing up close and personal and has no idea how to communicate that kind of ugly violence to an audience. Young hoods with cheap handguns don't manage to kill many people from 50yds away. They have to wound them and then go up and shoot them at point blank range, usually several times, often while the victim is screaming in pain, crying, or begging for their life. That's real violence, not the stylized jumpcut crap this movie offers up.
The DVD cover is also a cheat. Braga's niece Alice barely has a role in this movie and that role ends when Benny is killed, in the absolutely terrible strobe-light sequence which far from being brutal was just confusing and annoying. Her role is to be a Brazilian hottie for a few scenes, then to get lost because this movie really doesn't feel any need for female characters. They might get in the way of the gunfights.
The favela gangsters posing with their guns is also a cheat. You never get any idea of who these guys are, why they join up with the local drug armies, or that they have any personality at all. They're mannequins whose only purpose is to carry a gun around to make the battle sequences more chaotic. When they die, no one cares other than film critics snivelling about the horrible world that drugs and poverty have created. Well, yeah. Duh. But not every kid's response is to grab a gun, snort a line, and start firing. The director really has no idea what makes these kids different from the hundreds of thousands of other kids who *don't* turn into monsters. And yes, I haven't forgotten about Rocket, the emotionally vapid photographer who manages to make his way out of the slums by photographing the very violence that makes the slums a place to get out of. If the director was aware of that irony, he doesn't show it.
As any kind of social critique, this movie falls on its butt. Glowing filter shots, cool clothes, hip music, gangsters blasting away and talking about ""victory."" This is one long commercial for how fun the drug world must be as long as you're cool enough and violent enough to make it to the top of the heap before you get shot. If anything it will inspire future generations of favela killers to be just like the guys in the movie. I mean, look at how ""cool"" they are! Once again, the director could have made a powerful statement about the idolization of crime figures which creates a tragic circle that drags kids in thinking they'll be the next Lil Ze, only to end up dead. But, of course, he doesn't bother--it's much cooler to show another gun battle and a bunch of nameless/faceless corpses.
As for the hordes of kids running around carrying guns like it was .38 Special Day at the local elemetary school, the director is quite simply full of ****. Sure, there are plenty of young kids packing pistols in Rio (and many other cities as well) but they're furtive and scared in general and in no hurry to advertise themselves to the police or rival gang members. Nor are they the kind of steely-nerved warriors who can stand in the street and blaze away. Most run and hide and shoot from cover, if they even bother to stick around. When they kill it's typically a pack of them going after one or two other guys, or a couple of them robbing and killing an unarmed victim. Not these child armies the director seems to think are responsible for the constant drug wars in the favela. And when these kids *get* killed, it's frequently an older kid or an adult, a hardened criminal, doing the killing.
So if you like your masterpieces to be primarily fantasy-based adolescent tarantino ripoffs that are original only in the age of the cast, and your grittiness to be wrapped in clever camera tricks, this movie is for you. Otherwise, prepare to be disappointed because this movie packs all the emotional punch of the television commercials its director became famous for.",1087776000,20,5000,4.657239819004525
1923608,5,B0000D9PNX,"""City of God"" (""Cidade de Deus"") is a great Brazilian film of the brutal realities of the area.  This true story is desplicted wonderfully by the cast and crew.  It earned several award wins and nominations, including four Oscar nominations and a Golden Globe nomination (Best Foreign Film).  Director Fernando Meirelles leads the cast and crew to express the harsh realities of the City of God in the 1960's-1970's, ranging from gangs, daily residential life, corrupt police, and others.  The brilliant plot not only educates audiences on what happened; it also never holds back on the level of violence.  Therefore, the graphic scenes are necessary to offer a more realistic glimpse of living there.  They explore the characters' life backgrounds wonderfully, allowing audiences a more inside look.  Audiences must watch this film a few times to fully understand the deep range of details.  The actors express everything beautifully, though most are amateurs.  However, there are some gifted talents here.  Their anger, sadness, and fear are performed to the fullest, giving audiences the added emotional value.
The physical backgrounds wonderfully blend with the brutal plot events, though most of it was filmed in the actual City of God.  However, the camera work offes a deeper glimpse, offering the reality that can only be beaten by traveling there.  The music and the sounds accent the events' brutality beautifully.  Such efforts give added viewing pleasure.
""City of God"" is a great film for those looking for something unique.  This is sure to please audiences for a long time.

The film is made with a great amount of style in the Tarrantino fashion of non-linear filmmaking.  It is told from the point of view of Rocket, an aspiring photographer from the City of God (the slums of Rio).  The central character however is a young gangster boss known as Lil'Ze.  We first meet him when he is a pre-teen known as Lil'Dice.  Lil'Dice soon discovers that nothing is as amusing to him as killing people - as many as possible.  This sociopath grows up (to all of 18) to be the biggest drug boss in the City of God.  His bloodlust knows no bounds.  What made this movie so disturbing to me is the violence directed towards - and perpetrated by - children.  Human life is less-than-worthless there and killing people seems to be the only pastime.  I know that this is a great movie but it is gut-wrenching to watch.",1087603200,2,988,4.309782608695652
1923610,5,B0000D9PNX,"""The slum had been purgatory; now it's hell."" This is far from being a hyperbolic proclamation by Rocket, the narrator to Fernando Meirelles's ""City of God."" The City of God is a slum located in the heart of Rio de Janeiro where survival of the fittest can only be realized when one has the will to annihilate without remorse and engage in drugs without a conscience. Its harrowing streets reigned by malevolent crime lords are nothing short of hell. Only the name says otherwise.
Rocket (Alexandre Rodriques) is the narrator of ""City of God."" Unlike the majority of kids who are on the verge of toting guns, Rocket boasts a photo camera. It is fitting that he is the narrator reporting a true story about the City of God in a journalistic fashion. The cinematography is gritty and the camera direction is always moving with energy. ""City of God"" is director Fernando Meirelles's first feature film. Before this opportunity, he shot mainly for commercials, which enabled him to have knowledge on filmmaking techniques and tricks. ""City of God"" is churning with spirit and the audience is never left off the hook, as the audience is the victim to the debacle in the slum.
As the movie ends with the seeming prevailence of the law, there is yet to be a correction done in the slum. Children are still carrying artillery, same crude intentions, with the callous means to do it. That is the true trepidation that sends shiver down the spine. ""City of God"" is not simply a movie but a wake up call. It is a call for reform. It is not only a movie based on the slum of Rio de Janeiro but on all countries that are stricken by poverty. Like any great movie, ""City of God"" contains a lesson to be learned.
During the movie, a young lady says to an admirer, ""Hood don't stop, they just take a break."" Unfortunately, she is correct. At the end of the movie, as we see the children swagger away with guns in their hand, there is a dark foreboding of relentless tragedy.

1923611,4,B0000D9PNX,"""City of God"" is based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Brazilian journalist Paulo Lins. Lins grew up in Rio de Janeiro's City of God (Cicade de Deus) slum, a favela that was, and still is, dominated by violent hoodlums who take their income from the drug trade and are perpetually at war with the police and with each other. The film's narrator is a young man named Rocket (Alexandre Rodriguez) who aspires to be a photographer and lives precariously among the gangs but is not a part of them. The story of City of God is told in, I believe, eight parts, each a tale within the larger drama playing out in the slum. Rocket begins with the story of his older brother's generation, progresses to his own flirtation with crime, and into the rule of a bloodthirsty gangster named L'il Ze (Leandro Firmino), culminating in L'il Ze's all-out war with Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge) that plunged the favela into chaos. My understanding is that the events of the war are largely true.

""City of God"" is certainly an interesting glimpse into life in Rio de Janeiro's most violent favelas, where guns are ubiquitous and shooting people with them is a way of life for what seems like every male over the age of ten. It's an enlightening, sometimes shocking, piece of social history, told in the cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; style. But as a narrative, it's flawed. A bunch of sociopaths being aggressively sociopathic for 2 hours and 10 minutes is tedious. The only sympathetic character in the film is Rocket, and we see relatively little of him. The hoodlums aren't interesting people. They are dumb, obnoxious, and heavily armed. Such is the risk of making a movie about real events and real people. I just wonder if the writing wouldn't have been criticized more had ""City of God"" been entirely fictional. Even though this is a fictionalized account of what happened in the City of God during the 1970s and 1980s, the film's value is found in its approximation of reality. ""City of God"" is interesting as a whole, but its individual components aren't engaging.

The DVD: The disc includes a 55-minute documentary entitled ""News from a Personal War"", which is subtitled. Also in eight parts, this documentary film was made before ""City of God"". It traces the history of the gangs and drug trade in Rio's slums from the 1950s to the present. There is a lot of interview footage featuring real hoodlums, residents of the slums, and police officers who are part of urban combat units that enter the slums. The history of the slum culture and the rise of violence in Rio seems to be interesting, but unfortunately it's not very coherent. The documentary contains some thoughtful commentary but is poorly organized. It's long and intermittently interesting.

1923612,5,B0000D9PNX,"A film by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund
Roger Ebert has heaped praise upon praise for ""City of God"" and all of it is warranted.  The City of God slums are an offshoot of Rio de Janeiro that were created to keep the poor and the homeless away from the tourist centers of Rio.  The result was a slum that is brimming with violence and pain.  One can almost feel the hopelessness just bubbling up in the City of God, and that is not an exaggeration.  The film is narrated by, and ultimately focuses on a young man named Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues).  Rocket reveals the lore of City of God, what the slum is and how it became so.  Rocket tells us the story, moving backwards and forwards in time to tell the story in the way it should be told.  He tells us of an event, but rather than going into detail about that event, Rocket will then show us what we need to know to understand that event in context.  He will introduce a character, but then say ""but now is not the time to tell his story.""  Rocket is a master storyteller and the entire film is his canvas, revealing bits and pieces at the perfect time.
To tell the story of the City of God slums, we have to be told the story of L'il Ze (Leandro Firmino).  L'il Ze began as a child wanting to run with one of the local gangs, but in time he grew up and was strong enough (and quick enough) to start eliminating and taking over rival gangs until L'il Ze had to be acknowledged the true king of the City of God.  With the advise of his only true friend Benny (Phellipe Haagensen), L'il Ze did permit one gang to survive, that of Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele), and it is the uneasy peace between these two gangs that provides much of the tension inside the City of God.  This is rough, violent, and poor slum with desperate men and all that is needed is just one tiny spark to start another turf war.
""City of God"" is powerful, stunning, violent, beautiful, stark, and it is one of the best films of the past decade.  The acting is raw, and rough and it feels authentic.  While we do not see the day to day life of the slum, we see the greater danger where there is always a risk of a raid or a shootout and just by trying to live their lives; people can be dragged into a war.  ""City of God"" is not violent for the sake of being violent, nor is it gratuitous.  I would say that the violence is portrayed in a realistic manner and reflects the reality of the actual City of God slum.  The violence, while important to the film does not overpower the story being told and it is not overly graphic.  Directors Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund do not give any easy answers but only reveal a way of life that is alien to everything I know.  Being born into the City of God, a child grows up into something that he cannot control and can only hope to survive in by any means that he can.  ""City of God"" shows how Rocket survives, and also gives a glimpse of what happens if someone like L'il Ze takes another path.  ""City of God"" is a foreign language film and while it is similar in some respects to American gangster films like ""Goodfellas"", this movie goes in a different direction.  It must be said that it is just as good, though.

1923613,5,B0000D9PNX,"Tucked away in the hills of Rio de Janeiro is a slum aptly named Cidade de Deus (City of God) that is ridden with drugs, poverty, and corruption. Narrated by a young Rocket who grows up witnessing the actions of the hoodlum gangs that dominate the slum. Although Rocket has little desire to join in their illegal activities he can't help to be affected by them; they hang out at every corner and the treat of violence always hangs heavy in the air. But despite his peers Rocket has dreams of becoming a photographer and become famous through more traditional avenues.
A series of vignettes tell the stories of numerous gang members that effectively combine to create a very convincing and authentic portrait of the City of God that bursts with energy and conviction. The introduction of cocaine created an atmosphere of high stakes in the City of God that resulted in various turf wars between factions and much blood shed culminating in warfare.
Very much worth watching is the included documentary ""News From a Personal War"" that investigates the effect of the drug trade on various in Rio slums. Included are interviews with police, drug dealers, drug runners, and individuals living in the slum. Watching this documentary along with the film combine to create an excellent representation of the effects of drugs and violence in the slums of Rio de Janeiro.

1923614,5,B0000D9PNX,"This is a great movie, a masterpiece, a heart-breaking adventure. It is everything a film should be. City of God surges with majesty, love, hate, death, life and greed, a chronicling of two decades in the slums of Rio; an accurate, honest chronicling. Director Fernando Meirelles does not hesitate to share with us the truth surrounding a hidden world unknown to most before they'd seen or heard of the film. And thank God such a masterful auteur was given this sprawling epic. Otherwise, the violence and the horror could have been exploited for pure entertainment. But Meirelles does not entertain. He tells a story to open eyes, not to wow with special effects.
Technically, the film triumphs. But not with prototypical summer-blockbuster CGI. It amazes with its editing and cinematography, two aspects of film making not often recognized by the common person. But when one watches City of God, one realizes how crucial they are to the delivery of a story. The cinematography is colorful, beautiful; the tones and colors change with each decade, with each place. And there are shots so innovative you will have to rewind and watch them again to realize that what you'd just seen is reality. For instance, at the start of the film, the main character, Rocket, is in between a gang and a small battalion of police. But before the battle or outcome is explored any further, the camera swirls around his head, he shrinks, everything deteriorates into a beige wasteland, and the clock is visually turned back to the '60s. I was amazed after having watched this shot. It was so unique and full of substance, like nothing I'd seen before.
The editing underscores the life the people in the ""Cidade de Deus"" must live. The film centers around the development, establishment and clashes between two gangs: one lead by Carrot, another lead by the insane, death-obsessed Li'l Ze, who murders and kills those who stand in the way of his drug business, or those who simply annoy him. Every inhabitant of the slums is constantly vigilante. And the editors cut back and forth between eyes, feet, guns, and bullets so quickly and cleanly that a gauranteed sense of persistent paranoia is achieved with utter grace.
Another strong aspect of the film is its writing. The narrative structure allows for a unique explanation of each important gang or character that roams the City (at times, there is a non-linear play with time itself, introducing specific characters, such as Li'l Ze, with chilling imagery and completed sequences). The narrator himself, Rocket, grows from a young boy to a teenager inside the borders of the chaotic district, thus knowing the ins-and-outs of every part of the social and physical life within the region. He politely introduces himself, some dangerous family members, and even distant thugs, such as the Elementary-aged Runts. His know-how is sensed and becomes very casual, but adventurous, even breath-taking.
One monologue in particular resonated with me: A young woman of the slums is being seduced by a member of the Tender Trio, one of the earlier gangs found at the beginning of the film. Despite his numerous courses of action, she at first pushes him away for being a ""hood"" (short for hoodlum), saying, ""Hoods don't stop, hoods take breaks...hoods don't love, they desire."" She continues with some of the most mesmerizing words of the entire film, remaining in your heart and your head for days after the credits roll.
Some of the performances in City inevitably spark your interest. The main characters -Benny, Li'l Ze and Rocket- are played with charisma and soul; in the case of Li'l Ze, Douglas Silva manages to discover his inner being. There are scenes when the ruthless Ze lets go of his ""boss of the slums"" persona and breaks down in tears, revealing darker regions of his already shadowed-over psyche. Silva's performance is, by far, the best in the film.
Overall, City of God is most certainly the greatest film in years. Apart from being creative, visually stunning and intelligent, it is honest, telling us, ""We're not going to censor this violence, because then we would not be sharing the real core of the Cidade de Deus' existence. Children do kill. Children are killed. Drugs are rampant. It is chaos, not a PG-13 adventure flick."" Again, I commend Meirelles for allowing this film to remain in raw form. City of God has invaded the cinema with its genius portrayal of a City that has become a sort of myth among those who live far, far way. Our eyes have been opened. And as the president of Brazil, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has clearly established, we need to act. City of God is a banner demanding change.",1086998400,9,4655,4.871374527112232
1923615,5,B0000D9PNX,"""Cidade de Deus"" (""City of God"") is one of the most violent movies I have ever seen, much of it perpetrated by and directed against children, but the onslaught is justified because this is what life is like in the slums of Rio De Janeiro.  There are over 600 slum neighborhoods in the city housing 1.2 million of Rio's 5.8 million inhabitants.  Cidade de Deus was apparently a misguided attempt at solving the problem of having so many poor in a city that thrives on tourist dollars: build a project area for the poor to keep them away from the city center.  However, the result is more like John Carpenter's dystopian nightmare ""Escape from New York,"" except that this is the real world and real life hell hole.
Based on the novel by Paulo Lins and directed by Fernando Merirelles, ""Cidade de Deus"" parallels the life of its narrator, Buscap&eacute; (Rocket), with the evolution of the gangs that roam through the slum and the rise of the sociopathic gang leader Li'l Z&eacute; (Leanadro Frimino da Hora), who was the king of the drug lords in Cidade de Deus during the 1970s.  It takes a while to discover that the story is as much about Li'l Z&eacute; as it is about Buscap&eacute; and that these are two different paths being followed by kids born into essentially the same circumstances.
You would think that Buscap&eacute; (Alexandre Rodrigues) would end up being a criminal because his brother is one (although not a very good one), but even though he is young Buscap&eacute; cannot help but see the hopelessness of that sort of life.  But similar forces turn Li'l Z&eacute; un a ruthless killer who consolidates his power and actually makes the slum safer because he has taken over almost all of the rival gangs.  The police show up from time to time but as the story progresses we get to the point where they are out gunned by gangs.  Of course the point comes where Li'l Z&eacute; has to move on the last of the gang lords who opposed him, Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele) and Knockout Ned (Deu Jorge).
The character of Buscap&eacute; is in an interesting position, which is established literally in the opening sequence of the film, before we go back to the beginning to find out why chasing a chicken could get you killed in a crossfire.  Buscap&eacute; is close enough to the world of Li'l Z&eacute; to be able to witness the rise and fall of the gang leader but is not swept up in the cycle of violence.  Ultimately his position as a witness is legitimated, both in Cidade de Deus and Rio de Janeiro, by the gift of a stolen camera.
As much as the film entwines the narratives of the power plays of a drug lord with the efforts of a young man to get out of hell alive, ""Cidade de Deus"" is ultimately an indictment of a city that literally turned its back on its poor and left them to create a world of violence.  The city powers are content because the gangs stay in the slum, robbing the poor because as long as they leave the middle class, the rich, and the tourists alone, they are happy with the bargain.  Meanwhile generations of children are growing up looking forward to the day they can get their first gun and go kill somebody they do not like.  This film could not possibly have a more horrific ending in terms of representing the chilling cycle of violence that will perpetuate itself into infinity.
By a random twist of fate I happened to watch ""City of God"" the same week that I got around to finally seeing ""Amores Perros,"" so I am particularly stuck by these two films, one in Portugese from Brazil and the other in Spanish from Mexico, that both use violence to such different ends from what we have been getting from Hollywood.  This is not the stylized cartoon violence of ""Kill Bill"" and ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" or the computer generated carnage of ""The Return of the King"" and ""Troy,"" but something more visceral and much more powerful.  Merirelles brings an artistic flair to the depictions of violence without lessening the impact or the importance of the lesson.  I like how the Havana Film Festival cited Meirelles in awarding him their FIPRESCI Prize cited him: ""For approaching the explosive theme of social exclusion, using an ambitious, complex and involving style of narration, without moralizing or condoning violence.""  Hopefully this film will have more of an impact than convincing thousands of tourists not to ever visit Rio.",1086998400,44,4375,4.633074935400517

This movie is described best in one word, AMAZING.  The story is based on the true story of a young Brazilian boy named Rocket, who wants to become a photographer.  He gets hired by the local newspaper to take pictures of the street gangs from ""the slums.""  The rest of the the story revolves around how so of the ""hoods"" become leaders of powerful gangs and bosses of the town.  There are also many side stories that are told about the characters.
This film was designed beautifully.  Fernando Mierelles did a masterful job of directing this film, considering the fact that most of the actors in the film are young kids who probably have little to no experience acting before.  The way that Mierelles inserted the character background stories was perfect.  If Peter Jackson wasen't up for Best Director, Mierelles definatly would have won, or at least should have won.  The cinematography is also amazing.  One scene is located in a dance club and the filming of that scene is stellar.  Very good performances in this movie, by young actors.  Great story and character development and just an overall entertaining movie.  I will say that if you do not like subtitled movies, then do not watch this because the subtitles in some scenes go by really fast and its hard to read.

First of all, the camera trickery and Scorcese style sporadic flicks, freeze frames and flashbacks are superbly executed and work naturally within the framwork of the film. They only drive to make it stylish. Style amongst ghetto slums can only be cool. Add to that some cool as a cucumber Brazilian samba tunes, 70's throwback songs and general cool songs. Add to that the character ""Benny"" - the coolest guy put on celluloid in 2003. He isn't the main character, but he dominates the screen when he is on. And you start to really understand his plans and subsequent plight.
We witness a world that we won't ever be a part of, and won't ever truly understand, and we are taken on a shakesperean story of epic proportions, even though the setting is a Rio favela isn't ""epic"" in essence, it is made epic by the sprawling time frame and vast array of characters. This is what we learn at GCSE Geography, about poverty and the struggle to get free of the slums, only here it's simply irresistible.

1923624,5,B0000D9PNX,"It's hard to describe a movie like City of God. It's not a documentary, but its grittiness makes you feel like what you're seeing is real. It's based on a true story, but it's hard to believe that events like the ones shown in the film actually can happen. It's hard to not relate and care for some of the characters even though most of them are murderers and drug users or traffickers.
City of God, or Cidade de Deus, is a brilliant, if brutal, film. First time director Fernando Meirelles brings to life a story of a group of boys who live in the slums of Rio de Janeiro in the 60's and 70's. Life there is tremendously hard and most kids end up as criminals, using and trafficking drugs, and carrying guns and shoothing each other like its their birthright.
Meirelles succeeds in bringing a vibrant and dynamic direction to the story, with a fantastic use of editing and music. But the thing that brings the film to life is the performance of all the actors, some of which are actually gang members and inhabitants of Rio's slums. Their acting is right on the spot, and because most of them (if not all) are unknown to the audience, they literally become their characters.
It's been compared to Scorsese's Goodfellas, and I think that's a fair comparison, not only because of the subject, but also because of the use of editing and the intertwining of stories. The use of narration by the main character is also similar.
This film was nominated to four Academy Awards, including Best Director for Meirelles, Best Adapted Screenplay for Brulio Mantovani, Best Editing (brilliantly done by Daniel Rezende) and Best Cinematography.",1083542400,5,1631,4.686411149825784

1923626,5,B0000D9PNX,"La Ciudad de Dios (The City of God) is the spanish translation of this great movie.
I also saw this movie last year going back to my Latin country in Spanish and seeing as Spanish and Portuguese language are very similiar (the movie was made in Brazil) I saw the movie as close to the original. There are some differences though, in US. the main character is called Buscape (Alexandra Rodrigues) is actually called Pedrator short for Pedro in the spanish form.
The movie is about the vicious and bloody Brazilian teenage mafia in the 1970's which resulted in one of the most bloody times in Brazil.
The Godfather by Francis Ford Coppola was a violent mobster movie, but this movie is about as violent if not more violent than the Godfather, since many of the Brazilian mob leaders are kids themselves and grow up to vicious killers.
It was directed by Ktia Lund* and Fernando Meirelles * who also have done other Brazilian movies. There is an old theory that says that killers are made not born but after watching La Ciudad de Dios you can make a good case that killers are born.
Ze Pequeno (Leandro Firmino) at about 10 yrs of age commits his first murders with a glee on his face and grows up to be one of the most violent criminals in Brazilian history.
The movie is taken from the novel of Paul Lins and centers of the poor family of Pedrato (ill use the names of the Spanish version since I found it be very raw and true).
Pedrato has a violent brother who is mixed in with a gang made of himself, Bene (Phellipe Haagensen) some young brat named Ze Pequeno. Cut the long story short, Pedratos brother dies, and his gang friends escape justice.
Pedrato mourns his brothers loss but as he gets older he meets Ze Pequeno now a young violent teengager who sells drugs and fire arms. During this chance meeting, Ze Pequeno in a state of abusive powers reveals to Pedrato that the police
did not kill his brother but he did in cold blood.
Buscape by this time has been specializing in photography and has managed to not get involved in the violent gangs taken in Brazil (with help from the equally corrupt
police department). However, as Buscape comes across more of more of this violent gangs and Ze Pequeno and his pal Benny, he uses his camera to photograph and capture a biography of photos of these gangs in action, hoping to one day expose them along the way hoping to make himself famous by this work.
Throughout the movie we meet a rival gang led by a man named Zanahorria (Carrot top) and another man who is a bus driver turned gang leader. They threaten Ze Puequeno's livelihood of violent and drugs when Ze Pequeno's controls gets out of hand.
The movie is very bloody and violent. During one initiation scene Ze Pequeno gives a 10 yr old the chance to live but offers one choice: Either he dies or he must kill his kid friend. It just one example of the level of violent and brutality that on a young age affects many people during this time.
The movie is a very in your face documentaric look at one historic sequence of events of violent during Brazil's history.
Pedrato near the end of the movie accomplishes his goal and by a great luck manages to survive the tale (since the story is told through his voice and eyes) and succeeds in establishing himself a great journalist.
This is a great caricature of one young man's quest to expose some of the horrific problems and corruption done in his own country.
This is a great movie. It has to be seen to be believed. There quite really isn't a movie like ''La Ciudad De Dios''.There have been mob movies in the past but nothing like this magnitude especially as seen through the eyes of a journalist in the making as Pedrato.
This is a must see movie, it may be everyone's cup of tea, but it definitely is up there along with the movie ''Z'' that is one of the best movies done overseas in quite a long time.",1082937600,,3870,4.429172510518934

1923628,5,B0000D9PNX,"For anyone who thinks Fernando Meirelles' ""Cidade de Deus"" (City of God) might be a bit melodramatic and over the top, consider the lead paragraph from this recent (April 17, 2004) news story from the Financial Times:
""While tourists sipped caipirinhas in Rio de Janeiro's exclusive Leblon district during the Easter holidays, machine-gun fire echoed from the scenic hills above. A turf war raged between rival gangs trying to dominate the nearby Rocinha favela - and its drug market estimated at $3m per week - and at least a dozen people were killed. Since then the police have killed Luciano Barbosa da Silva, the drug lord known as Lulu, and 1,200 officers have been occupying Rocinha.""
If you've seen the movie, you know that story is life imitating art.  'City of God' scores on two levels - the story itself is gripping and jaw-dropping, but the technical achievement of the film is also worthy of note.  It scored a Best Director Oscar nomination for Meirelles.  It's easy to see why.  From the opening scene (which also doubles as one of the closing scenes) of a mad scramble through the favela to chase down a fleeing chicken, to a shocking robbery gone bad at a local motel, to a party to toast retiring drug lord Benny, to Lil' Dice's moment of truth, it's just one amazing sequence after another.  I just think of the coordination it must have taken to pull together the scene depicting Benny's going away party.  The depth of action in that 10-minute or so sequence is so rich, it'll take 10+ viewings to pick up all the details Meirelles has crammed in there.

1923630,5,B0000D9PNX,"Simply put, this is probably one of the single most significant films ever released, and (so far) undoubtedly the most important film of the 21st century.  You know, I won't bog you down with technical and story details, 'cause you don't want to read those again.  But the film is packed to the gills with so much rich detail and believably realistic acting from no one's residing in the very ""favela"" that is the film's namesake, which inherently implies that it warrants something uniquely special.  Any misanthropic gutterpunk in the US can hate our government because of what it deprives its citizens, but you know what?  They haven't seen this movie; they have not known true and calculated governmental neglect.
But, I'll just let these facts speak for themselves: ""Cidade de Deus"" has remained in Bay Area movie theaters for going on fifteen months straight, the controversy of the film's failure to gain entry into the 2002 Oscars' Best Foreign Language Film category heralded delayed critical celebratory nominations for the following year, in which it garnered every single important nomination excluding ""Best Picture"".  And the film is Brazil's number one all-time money maker.  That not enough?  The film's reception and high accolades are also responsible for the Brazilian government prompting socioeconomic reform.  This is what I mean when I use the term ""significant,"" and I don't use it lightly.
The direction is beyond craftsmanlike, the cinematography exemplary, the screenplay is crisp, layered, and cleverly nonlinear without ever making the viewer play catchup.  And the editing... oh, man, the editing.  It won the British Film Award for Editing back in 2002, and in case you don't know, that is a granddaddy prize for technical film achievement.
The film boasts maybe one of the strongest senses of place I've ever witnessed in film.  This film takes place INSIDE that world; the world does not take place around the film, if that makes any sense.
If you want to watch something that will teach you about the forgotten corners of the world even more than being uncommonly entertaining and violently riveting, this is the film to wake up with.  I cannot offer a higher recommendation.",1080864000,11,2209,5.071823204419889

1923632,5,B0000D9PNX,"When I decided to watch ""Cidade de Deus"", I was rather hesitant. Although I had heard positive comments for the film, there were several things that were putting me off: The shoot-em-up story did not sound original, the actors were amateur, the language and location were not so familiar. However I devided to give it a try.
Well, it proved to be a very wise move by my side: ""Cidade de Deus"" is simply an excellent film. The story might not be that original but is very interesting and very well-told. The ""amateur"" actors are superb, and perform much better than many professional ones. The language and location may not sound familiar at the beginning, but the masterful director soon gets you quickly entwined with the environment; in fact, he is maybe the greatest asset of this production, as he does an excellent job in providing us with a top-notch direction.
What you see is sometimes so surreal (a poor ghetto community totally isolated from the ""normal"" parts of Brazil, small children toying with drugs and guns, people showing a complete lack of respect for human life, etc.) that you tend to think it is a bit exaggerated. Sadly, it is not: The story is true, and many if the actors that play in it are actual inhabitants of this kind of ghetto communities.

1923633,5,B0000D9PNX,"CITY OF GOD is an area of government subsidy housing in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil which like so many such projects in this country became an area of slum and crime.  Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund have had the courage to examine the quality of life in this unfortunate 'city' and have produced a film that is brilliant on many levels.  First, the method of story development - using a narrator to explain piecemeal the backgrounds of all of the principal players and places that form this explosive look at crime - is riveting, genuine, and captivatingly forceful. Repeats of previously viewed sections transplanted throughout the movie in different contexts advance the intricacies of the story and the tension between the characters in a way few other 'docudramas' have succeeded.  Second, the cast of nonprofessional actors is uniformly superb.  There is no sense of 'acting' here, just a feeling of propulsive story development.  Third, the message about how crime drives children to have guns, to kill, steal, bludgeon, and hate all in the name of survival is horrifyingly real and believable.  The one child who manages to grow out of his environment does it quite by accident: Rocket loves cameras and eventually satisfies both the corrupt police and the criminally obsessed that his talent allows him an escape hatch from the inevitable early death that City of God promises its inhabitants.  Fourth, getting up from your seat in the theatre and leaving the movie behind leaves an indelible mark on the consciousness of the audience that not only is this film about slum life, street crime, juvenile delinquency: this is a film that demonstrates VERY forcibly what WAR  is all about.

the actors although are hardly known deliver their roles so well that it is hard to think that it's just a film and not actually really happening there in front of you. the honesty of the narration and the fact we see the lives of the characters evolving makes us feel like we could really be living their lives with them. it draws you in like no other film has ever done because you see both sides of the war and can really appreciate yet never fully know the hardship that many people have to face daily. it is almost impossible not have loyalty to the lives of the young hoodlums we are introduced to and love immediately; especially the infamous trio whose smooth talking and childlike innocence in their petty crimes will win you over instantly. A hood never stops they just take a break, this film never stops enticing and enthralling you it takes a break. each story is separated by freeze frames alowing you to contemplate on the last and prepare for the next even more brutal scene.
I don't think it's fair to compare it to films such as goodfellas just because it too is spread over a large time period as i feel that Cidade de Deus is like no other. it is one of my favourite films that i've ever seen due to its ruthless honesty in portraying the slums in brazil and because of the simple yet stunning camera work and direction. Its not like other films that try to reflect the lives and harsh reality for people in the world, it really captures the passionate characteristics of the hispanic culture and the soundtrack just adds to this emotive piece of cinema.
The frantic and precarious lives are revealed to us decade by decade whilst throwing in extra shots from the past which suddenly help us to piece together all the events as the storyline evolves.
I don't have one bad thing to say about this film it was electric yet calming, perilous and urgent and altogether absolutely beautiful.",1078358400,,2171,4.540816326530612
1923636,5,B0000D9PNX,"In the 50s and 60s outside Rio de Janeiro the Brazilian government isolated the poor by building a huge ghetto a distance from Rio de Janeiro.  The ghetto turns into a sizeable city that continues to grow as more people are bussed into the poverty of the area.  The film pushes a message of where there is poverty there are also dreams of something better. The two common means to achieve these dreams are either hard work or escape of the cruel reality through drugs.  The later choice is the common alternative as it is easier to obtain and offers a quick fix to the problem, since hard work that pays enough to escape the ghetto is difficult to find.  As the story begins, the audience is introduced to the young boy Buscap&eacute;, the narrator, whose brother is a member in a small gang called The Tender Trio.  Buscap&eacute; tells a tale of the how ideas lead to the quest for the ""better  something"" as The Tender Trio seeks the holy grail through robbery.  However, these robberies seems futile as the real money lays with those who control the drugs.  As drugs become more accessible the drug dealers begin to control their own territories, and in Buscap&eacute;'s story the greed for more leads to a bloody path lined with murder and tragedy.  Through Buscap&eacute; the audience is enlightened about the birth of violence which is related to the drugs and greed in the city called the City of God.  City of God is a strong and disturbing film as it depicts young children being victims of the violence or as the actual assailants as the gangs demands the loyalty.  In addition, the films message is enhanced by terrific cinematography and a well written story, which is based on true events and individuals.  City of God offers a brilliant cinematic experience that will not escape the mind of the audience as it pulls the audience through a painful story that continues to take place in the ghetto outside Rio de Janeiro where one person dies every 30 minutes from violence.",1077926400,4,1987,4.66189111747851
1923637,5,B0000D9PNX,"""City of God,"" directed by Fernando Meirelles, is set in a crime-plagued slum of Rio.  The story of illegal drug trafficking and vicious gang warfare is told through the eyes of Rocket, a young slum dweller who aspires to be a photographer.
This film is sort of like ""The Godfather"" meets ""The Lord of the Flies"" in Brazil.  Meirelles' story crackles with a Tarantinoesque energy.  Music is used effectively to complement the film.  Also effective is how the story shifts back and forth in time as portraits of the slum dwellers are created.  Meirelles achieves scenes of real visual poetry and beauty in this harsh setting.
This film is not for the squeamish; it features scenes of shocking violence, much of it committed by or against young children.  The very large cast delivers outstanding performances.  Touching on themes of friendship, ambition, urban corruption, and escaping one's environment, this is a truly striking film.",1077840000,,934,5.065359477124183

1923642,5,B0000D9PNX,"Mystifying, compelling, precisely provocative. Whatever term one comes up with, not even one or a thousand words can describe this art house masterpiece. ""City of God""'s premise is likely to leave anyone who sees it feeling both stunned and awe-struck by the movie's end. Anyone who has ever been to Rio De Janeiro is immediately taken in by its colorfully cosmopolitan class and charm (including the city's most dominant statue of a familiar religious figure). But, many a visitor to one of Brazil's most populous cities rarely, if ever, gets to see the ""hidden"" Rio - one that is filled with a decaying sense of despair and hopelessness. Its slums are an obvious reminder that the poorest of the poor who reside in this bastion of purgatory, are faced with the harsh realities of drugs, gangs and brutal warfare, with the chances of gaining prosperity through honest means, such as getting an education, and a good paying job as a result, becoming a slim to none proposition all the moreso. The only chance at which the subjects of ""City of God"" have at a shot of prosperity, is if they obey the laws of this ghetto - remaining in gangs, begging, borrowing and stealing to put food on the table, and clothes on their backs. The surprising aspect of ""City of God"", is the striking realism conveyed in the film. The camouflaged expanse of the dilapidated rows of houses stretched out to the horizon in a ruralized setting, far away from the hustle and bustle of the urbanized Rio, adds to the film's virtual display of realism. The ""third-world"" street scenes provide the valiant crowning touch to the movie's expanded physical portfolio, giving such scenes a ""Beirut meets West Side Story"" feel to them. In conclusion, ""City of God"" is an excellent case study to show our country's junior high and high school students how not to make choices that could end up in death and self-destruction, and should be required viewing (despite the heavy degree of adult-oriented scenes and language contained within) as to help students see their way though the jungle of life, hopefully on the road to a better existence as a result. After a viewing of this picture, you'll be able to see why ""City of God"" has been nominated for a total of four Academy Awards for Best Picture, as many a viewer and critic alike have given this particular ""City"" a thumbs-up rave. A sure-to-be art house favorite in 2004, ""City of God"" is pure cinematic gold!",1076371200,2,2433,4.754137115839243
1923643,4,B0000D9PNX,"I'm not going to attempt a puny little plot summary of the Academy Award-nominated City of God - not because it defies explanation, but simply because the film is so vast, so sprawling, and so brutal it would impossible to fly through its air-tight narrative in a few sentences. What I can say is that in director Meirelles lies an artist so assured in his craft, so brave in his subject matter, I simply refuse to believe this is his first film. But it is - and it's simply exciting. Cinematographer Cesar Charlone's frenetic, energized camera whizzes through the Brazilian slums evoking gritty realism, and editor Daniel Rezende makes such a huge film seem logical and completely intact. I found myself immensely impressed by the technical achievements of the film (it goes without saying I'll be rooting for City in both of the aforementioned categories on February 29), but what sits with you after the credits roll is how socially and politically important the film is - and the scary implications it presents. City of God unmercifully shows some of the most brutal violence of recent cinema, but it all is based firmly in actual occurrences in the neighborhood it dramatizes. It's difficult to watch small kids committing cold-blooded murder, even more difficult to see small kids become victims of cold-blooded murder, but nearly intolerable to think that this Brazilian society was at a point where it lived by its own rules and effectually let it happen. But as much as City of God will disturb you, it's hard to not feel Meirelles's Scorsese-esque talent radiate from the screen (there are more than a few parallels to Goodfellas here). If anything, the brutality and lightning speed of it all can occasionally seem like too much, but I suppose it's a question of how much you can take. City of God is not gratuitous, though, because it's necessary to remember that this fine film is in fact...based in fact. City of God left me with two reactions: a desire to applaud its bravery and a need to thank God I live in such a safe place. GRADE: A-",1076112000,2,2053,4.753501400560224

The captivating camera shots make a truly fascinating cinematography.  Editing was brilliantly done with some Pulp Fiction influence added into it.  No single actor's performance particulary outshine the most, but the ensemble performance, from the street kids to the crime masterminds, is remarkably convincing!  The screenwriter made the story so suspenseful, bold and daring, that you would not want to miss a single scene.  And the truly best aspect of the movie is its ingenious filmmaking.

1923647,5,B0000D9PNX,"""City of God"" by Fernando Meirelles provides an overwhelming experience that engages all your senses. The spectator is left intoxicated on an overdose of blood, smoke and sweat from the strong colors and powerful sensations that mark each frame.  The complex narrative structure features three intersecting stories set in three different epochs or decades staring with the 60's and ending in the 80's. The fast paced anecdotal style of storytelling is perhaps a direct consequence of the many years of experience that Meirelles has had in directing commercials. The main issue in the film is that drugs are violence; the violence like the drugs create a problem of dependence, which affects everyone, even the innocent. Such is the case of the bus driver mane Galinha who commits murder in order to avenge the rape of his girlfriend, while He will end up being murdered himself during a bank robbery. In this sense the film has a circular logic. There are no winners, everyone from the policeman to the reporter as well as the drug dealer are responsible and guilty in some way. Another fascinating aspect is that the actors were all chosen among the very streets and 'favelas', which the film depicts - in as style reminiscent of the Iranian Abbas Kiarostami and Italian Neo-realism.",1075075200,,1284,4.972093023255814
1923648,5,B0000D9PNX,"Cidade de Deus (City of God) is a vicious and simply inspiring film about the slum 'City of God' in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It weaves the stories of many memorable characters such as Benny, Carrot, Knockout Ned and many more. However, its main focuses are the narrator, Rocket who informs the viewer of the inhabitants of the slum while telling his story and L'il Ze, the infamous and cruel leader of the slum.
Pros:
The great point about this film is the pure and emotionally charged feelings that the actors display especially Rocket and L'il Ze. I never knew that most actors here were non-professional but judging from their performances who cares? They could easily beat a Shakespearian actor in terms of intensity and ability.
It is also an original film in terms of camera shots and how the film was paced. It could have been turned into a pretentious documentary about the slums of Rio de Janeiro but didn't and stayed to true to what it was trying to perceive. I could in no way relate with the characters but that didn't stop me adoring the characters and their personalities.

Shot mostly with hand-held camera, 'City of God' is indeed soaked through with realism, its drama accentuated by scenes that startle with brutality (beware of the one involving little kids and a gun, it DOES end the way you are terrified it might). Despite obvious homage to Martin Scorsese (extended camera shots; the plot involving the life of a young suburban kid and his friends trying to survive is told in a similar structure to 'Goodfellas') and Quentin Tarantino (the contrast of wit vs brutality in the sparkling dialogue), we have obvious talents here, ladies and gents.

1923655,4,B0000D9PNX,"In Brief
Based on Paolo Lin's shattering novel Cidade de Deus, City of God traces dozens of intertwined stories of love, humour and struggle that reveal the real people inside Rio de Janerio's drug riddled neighbourhoods.  The focus of the film is based around two boys growing up in this violent world and how the different paths they take couldn't have been further from each other as one becomes a photographer and the other a drug dealer.
Review
Based upon a true story the film is told from the perspective of Rocket, a poor child who is too frail and scared to become an outlaw but also too smart to be content with an underpaid job.  He is the complete opposite to Lil Dice, a child of similar age who becomes Rio's most dangerous drug dealer and as the film progresses the differences between them become startlingly obvious.  Set over three decades this film provides some of the hardest imagery I have had to watch in some time.  Yet in no way is any of the content of the narrative or mise-en-scene gratuitous, but rather shocking in the way that it will make you feel.
There is something very strange about seeing a child with a gun, to most of us there is nothing new about this image as we have all seen children playing with toy firearms and indeed have ourselves at some point in our life.  Yet to watch a child in a film who although is acting with a fake weapon, doesn't detract from the intense shock value of seeing a small boy murder and even enjoy it with an intense smile upon his face.  I suppose this comparison does highlight how gang culture is bred from playing as we watch the same boys in a ball game later highjack, become drug pushers & murders with a callous carefree attitude as if it were all still a game.
While the film opens with some flashy digital editing that has already become dated since its overuse in Guy Richie's films, there is no denying that the story is the most powerful thing on display here.  It is delivered through some very strong performances from the children, teenagers & adults involved but it the natural rhythm that the narrative provides that makes the daunting task of telling a 30 year story flow with such an ease that makes one want to learn the how the predetermined outcome will and has been affected by the past.
The Verdict
This is a beautiful work from a director that was recognised by Cannes in 2002.  It is not for the weak of heart as the shocking reality on display here is told without many of the conventions that make a gritty film gritty.  Yet the story is as clear as much of the stunning photography: a single cell or still may provide a postcard view of Rio but the narrative shows the flip side - the true side - and how much of life is a fight with fate in the City of God.",1073520000,8,2760,4.375
1923656,5,B0000D9PNX,"Having best film 2003 from the British Film Magazine ""Empire"" is not a bad acclaim to have on your curriculum vitae. Neither is it such a bad thing to have that when not one member of your cast is known to anyone or the fact that subtitles bumble along at the bottom of your screen. For a director that can only spell one thing - Fernando Meirelles must be quite a gifted auteur... and he is.
City of God deserves it ""Goodfellas"" status and certainly many parallels can be drawn between the two - story spans decades across various family criminal lines, protagonist is trying to get out of his predicament with violence around every corner from both the mob and the cops. The premise is complex. City of God is a slum in Rio De Janeiro where murder, theft and police corruption is a way of life. Several children's stories are covered as they grow up to take their paths as either drug dealers, hit-men, gun sellers, armed robbers or just nobodies trying to get out of the nightmare city. Each kid has his own effect on the City of God which for one decade looks like drug disco paradise and then the next, a hell-hole worse than some outpost of the Vietnam War. However what is most frightening here is that there are hardly any adults in sight. The average age of a hoodlum in this film is five years of age with a ""Godfather"" being about eighteen. Kids can get hold of an AK47 quicker than they can get hold of a packet of sweets and they will use their guns in a bat of an eyelid.
The truth is that this film covers roughly twenty or so characters in depth and at times may seem slow, but these dull moments which last only a few minutes can certainly be forgiven for the dynamics that are on display here. Our main protagonist is basically a youth becoming a ""war correspondent"" with the local news media and he gets himself right in on top of the action with his camera. Meirelles manages to capture some awe-inspiring scenes and cuts the film together in an amazing fashion with lots of extremely moving cinematography. The actors and their acting is also strikingly real, many of whom actually feel as if they carry some real City of God genes in their blood. This movie looks as good as, if not better than, most Hollywood blockbusters.
The film is shocking in parts with children shooting and torturing other children in order to get their piece of the city. It is mostly grim and upsetting. Adults seem resigned to the background where they can do little more than just sit back and watch their kin rip the world apart. The problem is that the US has basically outlawed drugs in their city which is enforced by the police (unless on the take) and so this is how everybody makes a living - selling marijuana and cocaine, but at the same time COLT company is pumping out those weapons like no tomorrow. Soon enough the teens have collected enough ammo to make each one look like an upgraded version of Rambo.
This is art house cinema with a hell of a bite and many social morals to enlighten us. It is a tour de force to be reckoned with and certainly one of the most surprising and energetic films you will likely see this year. DVD ownership is a must and even more amazing is the fact that this is based on a true story and the events in this film actually happened.",1073088000,11,3279,4.385878489326765
1923657,4,B0000D9PNX,"I'll bet the Rio de Janeiro Tourist Board isn't mailing out DVDs of this one.
The film opens in the 1960s in a government-built slum for the homeless and poor, the CITY OF GOD, located distant from the city center and off where the tourists and more productive citizens won't notice. The narrator is Rocket, who, at about ten years of age, watches as his older brother, Shaggy, becomes one of a celebrated trio of young toughs who spend their days robbing natural gas delivery trucks. Shaggy is ultimately murdered by the criminally ambitious L'il Dice, an even younger boy, perhaps 8 years old, who has a lust for killing and power.
The film jumps forward into the 1970s. L'il Dice is now the vicious L'il Ze (Firmino da Hora), who, with his gang of hoodlums, has taken virtual control of the City of God's narcotics distribution by killing off all the other capos. His only rival still in power is Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele). The older Rocket, now played by Alexandre Rodrigues, remains the observer that guides the viewer through the escalating gang rivalry. By the time Rocket gets a job with a Rio de Janeiro daily rag, Carrot and L'il Ze and their respective followers are engaged in an all-out war with enough sophisticated firepower to make the NRA drool.
There's no hero in the CITY OF GOD to ride in and set things right. There are only Bad Guys, innocent bystanders, and observers. The bloodletting is pervasive and casual. About three quarters of the way through, I facetiously mentioned to my wife that I should've kept a corpse count from the start; I haven't seen so many dead bodies since WE WERE SOLDIERS.
The point of the film, I gather, is to show how a culture of violence and crime, passed down from generation to generation, takes root in a marginalized population left to fester beyond the ken and sight of the mainstream citizenry. And the police hardly bother unless it doesn't get its cut of the take or the chaos comes to the attention of the popular press. Otherwise, it's everybody for himself and the devil take the hindmost.
CITY OF GOD is a gritty, and visually arresting piece. At over two hours, however, the violence, violence, and more violence without anyone to really cheer for becomes numbing, so I'm only awarding 4 stars instead of 5. And it's not entertainment in the ""let's go to a flicks, crunch some popcorn, and have a few laughs"" sense. The film is more instructive than anything else, and may cause social activists in the audience to wring their hands, jump into the SUV, and go demonstrate against whatever poverty-driven social injustice is currently faddish. The more indifferent will perhaps just give thanks not to be living in a Third World cesspit, jump into the SUV, and go have pizza. (Hmmm, am I in the mood for pepperoni or the combo?)
Considering L'il Ze's genesis as a gangster, the film's conclusion is both poetically just and ironic, and worth the time spent witness to the slaughter. The ending credits claim the story is based on true events.",1072656000,6,3012,4.717267552182163

From its opening sequence involving a fast paced chase scene between a chicken and and dozens of gun toting teenagers and children to its blood soaked ending this movie grabs you immediately and doesnt release its hold for even one moment.
You become immersed in the characters and the irony of the film in my opinion is that even the worste characters inspire pity rather than anger or dislike as is exemplified by the scene where Ze Pequeno kneels over the body of his murdered friend, crying and inefectually shoots his pistol into the air. It is his conditioned response to everything. But we, as he, realize you cant shoot someone back to life.
Products of their environment and desensitized to violence to such a level, that when one of the main characters brother's dies we see that he is less concerned with the death of his brother and more interested in the camera somone is using to take pictures of the dead body. These children have seen it all by a very young age.
The violence in this movie is chilling. Although disgusting we realize it is central to the theme and necessary to the plot.

1923666,2,B0000D9PNX,"This film came soaring in on a massive tide of hype but, ultimately, failed to deliver. A major hit at film festivals worldwide, the film is supposedly representative of the burgeoning new film industry in Brazil. But if you've seen American films like ""Menace II Society"" or countless other ghetto gangsta flicks, this certainly won't offer any new surprises.  The story contains a vast cornucopia of characters but concentrates mainly on two, one a leading underworld crime figure, the other a photographer who chronicles Brazilian ghetto life.  The story has no real plot, but is a more a vast character study that sprawls all over the place. Inevitably, the gangsters' lifestyles leads to their early demises and we're supposed to shake our heads at the tragic waste of life. The cinematography is rather good, however, and seeing the Rio slums up close like this is interesting, but the premise is rather tiring.  There is a large school of opinion that sees films like this as a vast reflection of the oppression that minorities face in the Americas, be it North or South.  However, the self-destructive behaviour of the film's protagonists really doesn't invoke any sympathy.  In the end, I was left feeling indifferent. The only thing I really learned from the film is that white middle-class college-boy liberal guilt extends beyond Canada and the US...it's also something that exists in Brazil. I'm sure the filmmaker's thought that they were delving into some deep subject matter here and that they were doing their duty as good little Marxists to expose the oppressive nature of their capitalist society, but in the end the only thing I was left feeling was 'so what?'. The only saving grace to this movie is the fine performances by the amateur actors, otherwise it's just an exotic foray into a familiar story...if an American made this film in New York, it wouldn't garner even half the praise that it got.

1923672,5,B0000D9PNX,"This Brazilian film ""City of God"" has already gathered universal praise, and the film deserves every word of it.  Think of the vitality of Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" and the subject matter of ""Menace II Society"" and you get both of them  here.  Cinematic tour-de-force, ""City of God"" from Brazil depicts the relentless reality of the ghetto of Rio de Janeiro, following the three decades from the 60s to the 80s, but the impression after seeing through it is like being knocked out by the unstoppable visual energy and musical power.  Violent, but not so graphically so, so don't steer away.
Based on the book by the writer Paulo Lins's ""Cidade de Deus"" (who actually lived there), the film starts with a dynamite opening sequence where the camera tactfully shows the boy unwisely trapped between the police squad and armed gangsters (mainly still teens or even pre-teens) on the street of Rio.  How come is he standing there?  The film suddenly jumps back to the former generation's story, which eventually leads up to the present situation of the boy ""Rocket"" (in the original, ""Buscape"") who aspires to be a photo journalist.
And the stories of the people there, told by Rocket, begin.  With a series of exciting shots and skillful editing, the film never stops, gripping your heart to the end.  There are robberey that ends up with a violent ending (and how it happened will shock you); the rise of drug king Li'L Z and his no mercy policy (which ironically brings about the short-lived stability of the place where ever-changing power is a usual thing); and the inevitable ending of his violent actions.  Inserted between the main story are lots of side-characters who are no less impressive than Rocket and LiL Z.  All of these characters imbue energy into this incredibly intense film.
You might flinch, but not because of the blood or gunshots.  You see comparatively few of them, compared with ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Gangs of New York.""  Less graphic than you imagine, the film still shocks you with the merciless moments showing the fates of the some children living there, whose life is treated as very cheap.
At the same time, however, the film gives no preachy messages and simply leaves us dizzy with the power of the place.  Some may disagree, quite understandably, with the often ""pop"" way the film treats the serious subject matter.  But whether you like it or not, you just cannot turn your eyes from the screen.
The main director Brazilian Fernado Meirelles and co-director Katia Lund display expert job here, never letting up for a moment.  If you want to witness what a good film can do with its visual skills, you just see this film.  Its running time (which goes more than 2 hours) will literally fly.
Check out the girl Angelica who sits next to Rocket on the beach.  She is played by Alice Braga, niece to more famous actress Sonia Braga.",1059264000,4,2861,4.77079107505071

1923695,4,B0000D9PNX,"So this is what Brazilian ghettos look like. Stylistically a little like ""Traffic"" (liberal reliance on sepia tones or drugs) or ""Salaam Bombay"" (similar theme couched in the streets of Bombay), this movie is a bloody but captivating look at real life in modern day Rio.
Gangsterism is no more a fringe career option amidst the socio-economic strife of the city, but a prime-time industry that takes guts and guile to keep away from. Character after character in the movie fall a prey to this vicious panoply of drugs, poverty and gore. An underlying personal thread is the story of how our protagonist, Rocket, becomes a news photographer and escapes from the slum. Plus, a minor subplot about how he loses his virginity.
Technically, the movie is nothing short of stunning. Several virtuoso scenes are strewn together with clever direction in which the dizzying pace and the sheer number of characters don't detract from a coherent, well told story. We are led in and around scenes, and frequently led back to explain why what occured occured. Wannabe-editors will marvel at how cunningly this effect is achieved. The cinematography, needless to mention, is geewhiz, the screen literally pops with color.
I could wax eloquent about more reasons but the proof is in the pudding. City of God bursts at the seams with energy, vivid color and a poignant story of a man's escape from the social drivel he is born into.

This gritty, depressing, hardboiled crime saga follows the story of a young photographer and his experience in the ghetto's of Rio de Janeiro.  I feel fortunate I was able to see this film in the theater, this is the type of film that will influence directors years from now. The violence is in your face and brutal, and the fact that most of the characters are under the age of 16 makes some of the scene's hard to digest. But none of the violence is gratuitous or unnecessary. Also the film is perfectly stylized in the Disco/Funk era of the 70's.  The sound track is all Brazilian Funk and provides a great balance to the violence and crazy attitudes of all the gangsters.  The story depicts the rise and fall of a 16 year old cocain king pin and his 12 year old cronies, all captured in photographs by the main character, who tries his hardest to rise out of the ghetto by means other than drugs or violence.  What is even more incredable about this movie is that it is a true story, and most of the actors are real kids from the ghetto's of Rio. But the movie hardly relies on the fact that it's a true story to become ingagining, it really wasn't until the film ended that I realized that most of the events in the movie actually happened.

I despair when I am confronted with the fact that the faces of poor Brazilian youth I have befriended in my own life -- friendly and innocent -- are so similar to the faces I see perpetrating such horrendous acts of inhumanity as I witness in this film.  Frankly, I wonder if it is really a true depiction of the reality on the ground in Rio's ""Cidade de Deus"", or is it, like so many North American films, a fantastic, overblown, over-the-top depiction of a narrow slice of life in the inner city? There is a fine line between DOCUMENTING real life on the streets and GLORIFYING and MAGNIFYING the violence of life on the streets.  I fear that this film will have the effect of reifying the violence of the slums, and will actually make things worse than they are already.  I see this film as a step in the direction of Life imitating Art -- in other words, it is similar to the way that life in the USA imitates the violence of American films. No doubt, it is an effective and controversial film.  But as a person who has personal relationships with individuals who live in similar neighborhoods in Brazil, I recommend extreme caution in accepting this film as a depiction of what real life in the Brazilian slums is like.

1923700,5,B0000D9PNX,"Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund's ""City of God"" makes ""Pulp Fiction"" look like ""Lassie,"" both in style and content. Meirelles and Lund use jittery hand-held cameras at odd angles, strobe light effects, and just about every other stylistic tic they can to tell a punch-in-the-gut story about the youth gangs of the Rio de Janeiro slums. These are just about the meanest streets in the world, and Meirelles and Lund spare us nothing. Ten-year-old hit men; corrupt, cowardly and murderous cops; teenage drug lords who shoot down their best friends in momentary pique--it's all here, in horrifying detail. Stretching out over about a decade in the '60s and '70s, ""City of God"" tells an elaborate, almost Dickensian story with scores of characters, ultimately concentrating on four: the psychotic teenage crime boss L'il Ze; Carrot, his marginally less despicable rival; Knockout Ned, a law-abiding veteran turned murderous brigand in his lust for revenge against L'il Ze; and Rocket, who longs for a way out of the slums and sees one in photojournalism. The film depicts an almost total moral void, and it's not for every taste; several people walked out during the screening I attended, including one of the friends I came with. But the hyperkinetic direction and the excellent performances of the mostly non-professional young actors make it compelling viewing for anyone with a strong enough stomach.

A lot of films about people living in impoverished environments always tend to allow its characters the luxury to have choices in their lives.  In City of God, the paths and conclusion to the lives of the characters weren't mapped out from their choices. They in fact had no choice at all as that was part of the point of the film. The movie revealed that while cinematic or literary mores may constitute fictional characters to make choices in their lives that would bring about change, whether it be positive or negative, in the reality of the lives of the hoodlums in City of God, they really had no choice.  Their choices were simply be a criminal or be killed.
That is unfortunately the reality in high risk neighborhoods not just in Brazil but in America and I'm sure anywhere in the world as well.  Anyone can say the obvious of spouting out drivel about how a person can overcome great difficulties through the right choices in their life.  However, what that well-intentioned but enormously misappropriated statement fails to point out is that it is a rarity and an exception when that does happen.

The City of God is a favela outside of Rio that was created in the 60's to house the poor. This is the story of urban poverty's effect on humanity. As the story progresses, in the distance we see hints of how close Rio the beautiful is to Rio the frightening. Pao de Acucar and Corcovado appear on the horizon, just peeking over the landscape, while in the foreground is the impoverished concrete landscape of the City of God. When the film jumps to the 70's we see the beauty of Rio a few more times, like when the young heroes hang out on the beach, flirt and get high. The soundtrack is amazing, mixing Brasilian music with James Brown and 70's disco.

You leave the theatre feeling as though you have experienced a taste of the slums of Rio, of the feelings of desperation.

Based on a true story of a young man who somehow escaped the preordained fate of his companions by becoming a photographer, the director, Fernando Meirelles, uses every modern technique to achieve his razor-sharp scenes of drugs, murders and non-stop violence that spins out of control and just keeps going.
The frantic energy of the film and fascinating story kept me at the edge of my seat, as a voice-over narration that moved backwards and forward in time, held the story together.  All of a sudden, a detail would be revealed that explained something that happened in the past, and, like an electric shock, my grasp of the story would move to even deeper levels.  There was little time to ponder it all though, because I was so caught up in what was happening on the screen that it was only later that I could appreciate the brilliance.
We watch several young boys grow into teenagers, tentatively experiencing the world of girls and drugs and guns and murders and crime.  There's upbeat samba music throughout, and brilliant colors and blood.  There's horrific violence, and also fine moments of humor and humanity. All together it just picked me up and plunked me down right into the middle of this world which made me hold my breath and live on the edge with the more than 200 non-professional actors who were recruited for this film. The sense of place is amazing.  And the acting was more than just acting.  It was real.  And it was also one of the most creative films I've ever seen.  Bravo to the filmmakers!  I give ""City of God"" my highest recommendation.",1046563200,152,1729,4.639344262295082
8000471,5,B0000D9PNX,"The movie is fast paced, it was a little difficult to keep up with all the reading and see what was happening during the scene at times. But the movie had a really good story line. If you like the American movie Dope, you will like this movie. Even though this movie is far more graphic and makes you question your own morals more than Dope does.",1522800000,,346,4.17910447761194
8000472,5,B0000D9PNX,"Please, please please ignore the reviews that say this is a boring sadistic movie. This is so far from the truth. Yes, it's troubling, yes, some scenes are hard to take, but it's also a tremendously beautiful and important film, and one that is based on real events. Truly one of the best films of the past few decades and this from a film teacher, for what it's worth.",1522108800,,369,4.36231884057971

8000477,5,B0000D9PNX,"Rodrigues has directed a brilliant movie about life of young men and boys in a favela in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He has an amazing ability to change one scene into another, incredibly artistic but also incredibly real.

I've visited Rio three times and seen the favelas from my hotel rooms, and on a two hour tour. People who I met there, and a young waiter at a restaurant last night, have told me the film is very realistic to the culture several years ago.

In many respects, this is a documentary, but thrilling and terrifying to watch. One young man escapes to become a photographer, but for many more there was apparently no other choice than becoming a hood.
