3729397,5,B001OB3R3Q,"BEST BARNEY EPISODE EVER!!!  MY TODDLER'S FAVORITE.
This is my 2yr old daughter's favorite.  She loves Barney and anything Barney, but this is the ONLY video of Barney's that she will sit still to watch and be good.  Other episodes are like the same songs being played and sang over and over and over and over again.  This top 20 countdown is like they took every single song that was ever sang on Barney's episodes and put it into 1 DVD.  No repeats.  Each song only sang once.  Great.  Highly recommended.",1410480000,2,507,4.4945054945054945

It has some new material (at least that we have not seen before) and some material that we have seen in other videos.  Overall, it is a good video.  I would probably have given it 5 stars if I had not seen Barney Songs, which has a lot of great catchy songs in it and my daughter likes to watch it often.",1375574400,2,380,3.960526315789474

3729411,3,B001OB3R3Q,"This is a good video. I was looking for a different movie. You think PBS would reissue ""Barney Live in New York City. Several people I know are looking for a DVD version. Their kids and grand kids loved it. It was only done in VHS. You can't find even the VHS version. If you do it is $200. What a joke.",1352073600,,303,3.903225806451613
3729412,2,B001OB3R3Q,"At first, LOVED THE DVD but after playing the DVD twice it started ""freezing up"" and ""skipping"".... ALREADY!! I have tried it in several DVD players and it's still ""freezing up"" or ""skipping"" to different segments on the DVD. I am soooooo FRUSTRATED; I've tried cleaning the DVD with a DVD cleaner but that didn't work either. My 2 year old cries when it freezes or skips to a different segment because he loves the DVD.  Oh well, I've bought other Barney DVDs and this is the only one (his favorite, of course) that skips and freezes.",1350864000,,535,4.515463917525773

3729414,5,B001OB3R3Q,"My kids love this. I am sick of it already. When you have to hear it every day it gets old quick. Notice I said every day. The songs are great for kids. it teaches them alot. Manners, numbers and a few classic songs it has it all.",1350518400,,230,3.8125
