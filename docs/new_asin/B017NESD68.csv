8739874,5,B017NESD68,"You won't regret ANY PreschoolPrep purchase. My two and four year olds runs around spouting math facts, blends, digraphs, and sight words. Everyone assumes I'm some over-the-top mom who drills the kids nonstop. Nope. I just pop in these DVDs while I do dishes and laundry! Guilt-free edu-tainment! BUY THEM ALL!!!",1484784000,5,313,5.1568627450980395

8739877,5,B017NESD68,"2yo and 4yo love these vidoes (they have levels 1-3) and insist on watching them every day at least twice a day one right after the other.

Our youngins did NOT enjoy the rock-and-learn version of learning (none of them). The audio on Math Facts is catchy and animation is cute. Gives little ones something to enjoy while learning. On the rock-and-learn version, the music is so bad that no one in our house will allow the dvd's to play more than 5m and they are going off.",1474588800,2,473,4.375
8739878,5,B017NESD68,Everything from this company is gold. It is the perfect level of stimulation for kids and we are truly shocked by our younger children who learn things from it (1.5 years). We got this for our 4 year old to help get her ready for Kindergarten and she is quickly learning to recognize how numbers interact.,1470441600,3,305,4.464285714285714
