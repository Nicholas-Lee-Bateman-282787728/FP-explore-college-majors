6284512,5,B00IOSLTKU,I've wanted for years to get this movie without the horrible voice-over that spoils the English version.  The film is gorgeous.,1404777600,4,127,5.0476190476190474

8644282,5,B00IOSLTKU,"Although I have not as yet received my copy, I have seen the film in it's American release, only to realize that that was seriously edited. This is the full film and will make sense because of this- The plot concerns a long gone Vampire who is released  by a curious cousin during her visit to her ancestral home. There is no blood aka Hammer films, but the story is told well and the ending will surprise people. I do recommend this film for horror fans as in my opinion, it stands as a masterpiece of implied activity with the gallons of blood some people feel is needed for a good flick.",1504569600,,590,4.267857142857143

8644284,5,B00IOSLTKU,Arrived and played exactly as expected. This version cannot be played on a US DVD player - but the quality of the picture is so worth seeing. I watched it on my laptop and will find a way to view on a bigger screen. I have the US version too which is a very poor quality transfer. The Carmilla story is one of my favorite vampire tales. This version is a lovely modern twist.,1474156800,,375,4.081081081081081
8644285,5,B00IOSLTKU,"I'm thrilled this film has finally been released in its original WIDESCREEN format. Just a few years ago, I was still reading that the widescreen version was presumably lost forever. All that remained was a fullscreen version,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/available-on-VHS/dp/6302491894/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">available on VHS</a>.

I first saw Blood and Roses (the English language title) in 1982, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/William-K-Everson/dp/0806509007/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">William K. Everson</a>'s class on the Horror Film at NYU's film school. Everson own a large personal collection of 16mm -- and even 35mm -- films. There was a story about how he salvaged many of his films from studio garbage bins, back in the old days when studios still threw out old films. Since this was before the days of video, owning a large personal collection of 16mm and 35mm films was an asset for any film professor.

I don't recall if the version I saw in Everson's class was widescreen. It was dubbed in English, and had the voiceover, which some fans hate.

Blood and Roses (I'll use this film's English title) is beautifully photographed, the sort of film that really benefits from its original widescreen presentation. Much of it -- the colors and composition -- resemble an impressionist painting, heightening the story's romance.

This color film is also noteworthy for including a scene presented in black-and-white -- and red. The same sort of visual trick used in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sin-City/dp/B004SIP9Z6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sin City</a>. But for those who care about film history, know that Blood and Roses did it first.

The black-and-white-and-red scene is rather artsy. Yes, Blood and Roses is an art film, albeit a horror-art film. It was produced for the art house crowd, not for grindhouses and drive-ins. There are few deaths, all of them offscreen. Some horror fans dislike Blood and Roses because they regard it as slow-moving and tepid. And it is, but that is the nature of art films. As for slow-moving, it's under an hour and twenty minutes. I was never bored.

I mentioned how the impressionistic visuals heighten the tale's romance. Blood and Roses is a romance, albeit a vampire romance. It is arguably the first true vampire romance on film, a now popular subgenre. Bela Lugosi's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula/dp/B000035Z3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula</a>&nbsp;was a heartthrob for many women, but his Dracula was also a monster.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows/dp/B007PZ6SYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows</a>&nbsp;has been credited with pioneering the notion of a romantic vampire, but Blood and Roses predates Dark Shadows.

Blood and Roses is based on (more like, loosely ""inspired"") the Sheridan Le Fanu novella,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carmilla/dp/0978454359/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carmilla</a>. The 19th century novella features a lesbian vampire. But Blood and Roses, set in contemporary times (i.e., 1960), instead features a young, heterosexual woman, Carmilla (Annette Vadim), who thinks she's possessed by her vampire ancestress, Millarca. Carmilla loves Leopoldo (Mel Ferrer), a man. But perhaps as an homage to the ""source material,"" Carmilla kisses Georgia (Elsa Martinelli), once. One kiss between two women. I think the scene was partially included to be daring and controversial (for those times), and so to attract male filmgoers seeking a racy lesbian tale. Really, this is no lesbian love story.

Hammer would later produce its own version of Carmilla, titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Vampire-Lovers/dp/B00AWWX8YG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Vampire Lovers</a>. The Hammer film is far more
faithful to the source material. A bloody, gory film, entertaining enough, but mediocre as compared to Blood and Roses. The Vampire Lovers is standard grindhouse fare, while Blood and Roses is a poignant work of art.

As is often the case in art films, Blood and Roses's story is ambiguous. Is Carmilla really possessed by her vampire ancestress? Or has she gone mad from her unrequited love for Leopoldo? And just what does Carmilla transfer to Georgia? The spirit of Millarca or her own neurosis?

This FilmClub Edition print looks a bit rough, but just a bit. It can do with some remastering. But it's, far and away, the best version available to the public at this time. And that's likely to remain true for a long while.

It has two soundtracks -- German and French. The DVD menu only offers English subtitles with the French soundtrack. Nevertheless, my DVD player was able to play the English subtitles in both the French and German versions, by pressing the DVD's subtitle button.

No, there is no voiceover. For that you must buy the (fullscreen) English language VHS tape.

Unlike some horror fans, I don't mind Blood and Roses's voiceover. I think it further heightens the final scene's romantic punch and poignancy. (But then, I didn't mind&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Runner/dp/B008M4MB8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Runner</a>'s voiceover.) So I will keep my VHS tape, to enjoy Blood and Roses's English language, voiceover version, alongside FilmClub's widescreen, foreign language version.

This FilmClub Edition includes two trailers -- one German language, one in American English. The American trailer markets Blood and Roses as a gruesome horror tale. The announcer pants breathlessly about the film's ""shocking horror"" and ""macabre terror."" Naturally, it includes the lesbian kiss. The German language trailer is more tepid. It (unlike the American trailer) retains the film's sumptuously romantic, classical music score. The American trailer's music is more dramatic. Like canned horror trailer music.

Interesting to see this historical piece of false advertising. Seems that the Europeans had made an art film, and U.S. distributors tried to sell it as a piece of grindhouse gore. No wonder U.S. horror fans were disappointed.",1450915200,5,6344,6.1203599550056245
8644286,4,B00IOSLTKU,"A German PAL version playable only on an All Region player here in the States.  I'd only seen the English language version and didn't like it, but this disk includes the French version with English subtitles (the German version only has French subtitles!), and it's a revelation.  I don't know how Annette Vadim is as an actress (her dialogue is kept to a minimum), but there are shots in here where she's absolutely stunning.  I don't know when the picture was released, but the English dubbed film is dated 1960, so the picture can't go that far;Vadim and Elsa Martinelli have a quick encounter after being caught in the rain, and there's a brief (very brief) shot of a blood-covered breast.  All-in-all it's not a bad picture, but as far as Lesbian Vampire movies go, Daughters of Darkness still leads the pack.",1441756800,3,814,4.711267605633803
8644287,5,B00IOSLTKU,"I took a chance on buying this German language ""Filmclub Edition"" release of ""Blood and Roses"", which is titled ""Und Vor Lust Zu Sterben"", and I am delighted with it. I only watched the French audio version that comes with the English subtitles, as that is the only version that I could understand, but it's a lovely, crisp, WIDESCREEN print of the movie, and therefore a million miles away from the full screen VHS version that i have had to live with up until now.

The story is slight: Leopoldo Karnstein is celebrating his impending wedding to the beautiful Georgia, and everybody is happy except for cousin Carmilla, who is secretly jealous. As various festivities are enjoyed by the family, Carmilla sneaks off out of spite, and ends up exploring an ancient family tomb and finding the disturbed resting place of a famous ancestor who was rumoured to have been a vampire. What happens to her in that tomb is only hinted at, but she emerges changed from a lighthearted girl to a moody and troubled enigma. The rest of the film charts how Carmilla subtly begins to pull apart the happiness of the engaged couple, with tragic results

The plot of the film is not the main attraction here, it's the way the film is shot. It's almost like a watching a poem come to life on screen. There is a lot of stillness in the film, some scenes linger on very slow moving visuals for long periods of time, but it all comes together, if you have the patience to just enjoy what you are looking at. A lot of mileage is gained from the many scenes in which Carmilla drifts silently around the scenery in an extravagant white ballgown. Annette Vadim looks stunning in the main role of Carmilla, and even shots of her doing nothing at all still look superb. Her acting skills are up to the job, and she shows a surprising amount of different emotions in the role, whereas, if shots of her are just viewed in still images or short clips, the impression you get of her is that she is quite wooden, but when seen in the film as a whole, I think she is actually very good. Elsa Martinelli is also very good in the role of the innocent Georgia, and scenes of the two women together can look amazing, especially in a subtle but heavily erotic scene set in a greenhouse during a storm. Not much happens here, but the scene is electrifying all the same. As I said earlier, the film is actually pretty short on events but you'll still enjoy it due to the lush scenery, lighting and the visual beauty of the two lead actresses. The music also plays a vital role, with many scenes underscored by a delicate and melancholy classical soundtrack, which reminded me of the score to ""Lisa and The Devil"", which used music to a similar effect. The whole movie has a very European film to it, unmistakable as a product of 1960s France/Italy, and impossible to reproduce today.

The only niggle with this release is some poor quality hiss and scratchiness of the French audio, but I forgive this for the stunning picture quality. I avoided buying this release for quite a while as I was hoping that an English audio version would eventually come out, because I prefer to soak up the visual atmosphere of a film like ""Blood and Roses"" without having to constantly read text, but I like this version now that I have watched it. The cast speak their dialogue in French (you can tell because the spoken audio synchs correctly to their mouths), so the dialogue looks authentic, and I happy to enjoy this with English subtitles.

All in all, a superb DVD, and definitely a keeper.",1429833600,3,3540,4.5265625
8644288,5,B00IOSLTKU,WELL WORTH THE RESOURCES.,1429142400,,25,5.5
8644289,5,B00IOSLTKU,"A beautiful digital transfer of a 60's vampire classic. This DVD offers the original French film (with English subtitles), which lacks the heavy-handed voiceover of the English-language dub. This version contains scenes deleted from the English dub -- including the gorgeously surreal ""dream sequence"" -- and has the much more ambiguous ending (i.e. is Carmilla really a vampire, or has she just lost touch with reality?). Avoid the North American DVD release, as it not only contains the inferior English-dub version but is also notoriously terrible in transfer quality.",1428019200,3,571,5.426966292134831
8644290,5,B00IOSLTKU,"Also known as the ""Et mourir de plaisir"", this is a 1960 French entry into the vampire genre. The film was directed by Roger Vadim, a movie that has several features that depart it from your vampire stereotype. This film approaches the gothic style of Hammer to some extent, yet it departs from those in being one of the most stylized movies on the genre. You will not get explicit violence or lots blood; indeed, no fangs are shown. Instead, the characters and the psychological suspense drive the film. In the end, the movie is about an impossible love by the last descendants of a family where happiness has not been the common feature. Other adds to the movie include the beautiful and sensual Anette Vadim as Carmilla. Her acting is very good and far from the typical blood thirsty vampire. Overall, this is a different gothic vampire tale, with good actors, and a beautiful music soundtrack. If you instead are looking for a more violent and bloody film, I suggest you to skip this one.

Technically, the transfer of this movie very good, with a clear image in widescreen DVD format by Big Ben Movies, a German release. Because of this, the audio comes in the original French or German, with English subtitles. Extras include some trailers of other features realeased the the DVD company, this movie trailers, including the English version, and a gallery of photos. Note that this DVD is PAL, region 2. The movie is supposed to run for 85 minutes, but total time in my Sony Blu-ray player scored 79 minutes, likely a difference linked to the PAL to NTSC conversion? I did not notice any flagrant cut.",1421452800,8,1606,4.6749116607773855
