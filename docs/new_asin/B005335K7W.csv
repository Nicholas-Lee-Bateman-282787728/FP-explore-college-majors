Dregg replaces shredder an krang, but the shredder does comes back middle of 10th season, but NO more rocksteady an bebop, unfornately there last episode was at end of 8th season where rafael said you know I some times almost feel sorry too those two jerks. lol",1308009600,4,341,4.34375
4533720,5,B005335K7W,"its been two years since the last season came out i hope teenage mutant ninja turtles season 10 is released this year too so the series can be complete along with the three missing episodes from season 4 and 5 most fans would hate a ninja turtle series without the classic villains shredder krang bebop rocksteady leatherhead general tragg etc,but dregg from this season and 10 has alot of drama action and of course comedy my favortie episodes out of the 8 in season 8 the wrath of medusa,the showdown,split second,carter the enforcer and doomquest which is a cliffhanger when the ninja turtles fight ugly monsters from black hole dimension this season has the turtles mutant into super monster forms which is the plot of the season and they hire a sidekick human named carter that spills mutantgen on his hand and turns into a super yellow mutant Mohawk he fights side by side with the turtles April o'neill works as a different news reporter their is no more Irma or Vernon or Vern her old boss
i recommend real fans of the ninja turtles make your series complete with season 9 and soon 10 Oder this season you will love season 9 TURTLE POWER!",1307923200,5,1146,4.595121951219512

4533751,5,B005335K7W,"After Shredder and Krang were stopped from bringing their Technodrome back to Earth from Dimension X in Episode #178, they are nowhere to be seen or heard on Season 9.

So just when the T.M.N.T. thought that it was time to party, a brand new archenemy invades the Earth for them to deal with -- Lord Dregg!  :(  He is even meaner than the other 2 archvillains put together, and his attitude will show in the final episodes of the long running franchise.  That's not to say that fans should be disappointed, though, because the episodes are still very awesome!  This disc contains Episodes #179 through #186.

Episode #179:  While the T.M.N.T. face the threat of Dregg, they have 2 additional problems to worry about.  Carter, a T.M.N.T. fanatic, meets up with them, but in an uneventful manner.  Furthermore, Donatello realizes that the mutagen that initially caused the 4 of them to mutate is STILL active -- WHAT?!  The truth will reveal itself in the next episode.  Carter also accidentally spills some mutagen on himself.

Dregg sends down his Technogang and reprograms the Intimidator robots to attack the citizens of NYC.  Bonus -- April has a new haircut, but she is no longer with Channel 6 and is now an independent reporter.  So that means no Irma, Vernon, or Burne Thompson to see anymore.  :(

Episode #180:  The Technogang steal the Proton Accelerator, which Dregg intends to use for an unusual purpose.  He summons the NYC citizens and tries to convince him that he's a ""good guy"" -- say what?!  Yes, he actually succeeds in getting them to listen.  The T.M.N.T. don't take too kindly to the media liking Dregg, but they have bigger problems to deal with.  Carter, who decided to join the Turtles, flakes out on them and pretends to join Dregg so that he can get some information out of him.  The plan works, but almost at a fatal cost.  April, herself, tries to get the goods on Dregg but is unsuccessful -- for now, anyway.  And a big secret is revealed by the end of the episode -- Carter HIMSELF is now a mutant, and the Turtles are very shocked.

Episode #181:  The Technogang try to steal some neutronium ore but Carter and the T.M.N.T. manage to stop them -- for a moment, anyways.  Dregg is very annoyed and sends one of his cronies, Medusa, to handle the situation.  She is very difficult to battle at first, and she also manages to get ahold of Carter's Virtual Reality Simulator.  She uses it to distract the Turtles into a trap.  Meanwhile, Dregg has his Technogang install a jamming device on the Space Station.  He intends to cut off all of Earth's communications.  This is also the first time that 3 of the Turtles will mutate into more grotesque, ugly versions of themselves.  But as a result, they become much more powerful and can easy stop Medusa.  So once the T.M.N.T. put her away and destroy the Space Station, Dregg is not only angry, but he completely turns the NYC media AGAINST the Turtles.  Oh no!!  :(

Episode #182:  Carter and the T.M.N.T. break into Hyperdyne Chemical and try to stop Hi-Tech and the Technogang from stealing the X-Fire Fuel, but the military actually forces the Turtles to back off, ALLOWING the foes to get away with the device!  :(  It seems that everyone in NYC now hates the Turtles and love Dregg, so it's up to them to turn the situation around.  It won't be so easy at first.  So when the T.M.N.T. break into Dregg's new headquarters at Killdeer Mountain, they battle many of his robots.  Not only that, Dregg actually watches the Turtles mutate, which will give him a new evil idea for the next episode...

Episode #183:  Carter runs into an old rival, Jet McCabe.  The two of them start fighting before Michaelangelo breaks it up.  He summons Carter to help him and the other Turtles stop Dregg from hypnotizing the NYC population.  They manage to drive the Technogang away, but once again, Dregg is confounded so he summons another one of his minions -- Sleazebug.  The cohort zaps 2 of the T.M.N.T., Carter, and Jet to a distant asteroid where they are forced to compete in the Pan-Galactic Tournaments!  Meanwhile, Dregg intends to use the other Turtles to drain their mutagen and turn his Technogang into invincible warriors!  He also double-crosses someone...

Episode #184:  Another one of Dregg's minions, Chronos, stirs up mayhem in NYC.  The T.M.N.T. and Carter have to stop him at all costs.  Unbeknownst to them, Chronos kidnaps Master Splinter and ties him up to the New Year's ball at Clayburne Tower.  The Turtles also learn an important connection regarding Chronos himself.

Episode #185:  Dregg amps up his plans and has the military build him a Star Shield -- a ""defense"" platform to fend off other evil aliens.  Yeah, right!!  The T.M.N.T. can't stop the humans from building it, so April and Carter decide to videotape Dregg's conversation with Hi-Tech and bring it to the chief reporter from Channel 8.  Unfortunately, he isn't convinced and blames the Turtles for everything.  Not only that, Carter gets kidnapped!

The T.M.N.T. will also have to contend with 2 more humans (whom later become their allies) -- Landor and Merrick.  They try to explain to the Turtles that Carter is actually evil and was actually using the T.M.N.T. to infiltrate their Lair.  It will be later revealed that ""Carter"" is actually a robot and that the REAL Carter is imprisoned on the Dreggnaught...

Episode #186:  Dregg amps up his tirade and hatred for the Turtles and uses the media to believe him.  But he'll have a bigger problem to worry about later.  First, he gets his hands on a Vortex Crystal; he tells the citizens that he will use it to provide them with clean energy.  Oh, please!  :(  Anyways, before his plan comes to fruition, another alien invades Earth -- Doomquest!  He manages to capture Dregg and his Dreggnaught.

Meanwhile, the T.M.N.T. have their own problems -- they have to find an immediate cure for their mutations because it's causing them to act completely cuckoo!  As Doomquest opens up some more vortexes and summons his foes from the Dark Realm, the T.M.N.T. turn on each other several times instead of fighting the real menace!  Thankfully, April gets Dregg on tape again and this time, succeeds in getting the Channel 8 chief reporter on her side.  But now the T.M.N.T. will have to break into Doomquest's huge spaceship to get the Vortex Crystal back -- it's the only way to stabilize their mutations!  Unfortunately, they will have to sacrifice it at the end of the episode, but at least they are able to send Doomquest and the other foes back to their Dark Realm.

After Dregg and Hi-Tech leave Earth, April exposes to the NYC citizens that Dregg was lying to them all along and that he intended to take over Earth the entire time.  They manage to believe her, thank goodness!  :)

So the episode is left with a cliffhanger, but it will resolve itself in the final 8 episodes of Season 10.  And yes, Shredder and Krang will have their long-awaited return too.  :)",1395100800,,6975,4.686468646864687

However, some alien warlord named Dregg and his followers arrived and became replacement enemies for the turtles. Season 9 was as good and dark as Season 8.

Dregg of the Earth
The Wrath of Medusa
The New Mutation
The Showdown

4533765,3,B005335K7W,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a series & toy that became super huge in the later 80's. It continued into the 90's with much success! Originally airing on Fox, and later on CBS. The later seasons (including 9) had some differences from the earlier seasons. The turtles would face a different wave of bad guys. Dregg is the new main bad guy. He is backed up by alien/robot characters. They meet a character named Carter. He also has studied martial arts. April has a different outfit. And doesn't really work for channel 6 news. And what's majorly different is the turtles mutate into bigger weird looking turtles! Carter also mutates into a big Native American warrior looking dude. The animation is different as a whole too! In my opinion, it isn't for the better. The animation isn't horrific. But it's a step back from the orignial earlier animation. I remember watching these episodes on CBS. They we're pretty cool still. However I found the earlier seasons more enjoyable in most aspects. The series also seems to take on a more serious form to it. Not quiet as many jokes. Like I said...It's still pretty cool. But people that grew up with the turtles when they started the series, probably agree the older seasons are slightly better. I definitely recommend this DVD/season to anyone that was into the old G1 TMNT series. And even the kids of today should enjoy it. My 9yr old son loves TMNT. He has the 2003 series on DVD. And we have almost all the original series. He favors the old series. And he does enjoy this DVD along w/ all the other old schools. This DVD has 8 episodes and is the entire 9th season.",1341273600,7,1620,4.589655172413793
4533766,4,B005335K7W,"Ok lets get this review started...

Opening/ending: I haven't purchased season 8 yet. but i do understand the opening was from that season, which happened to be shredder's last main season. lions gate could of atleast changed a few opening clips around, but then hardcore- oh wait. The biggest fans of seasons 1-7 hated the red sky episodes, or atleast 3/4's of them did. So a few edits to make the opening current wouldnt cause a riot.

Animation: I cant say much about the animation itself. I dig the red sky designs of the characters. But the animation was fuzzy and you could see some marks for a few seconds in the background. Re-mastering could of prevented this. I feel lionsgate is just puting them on DVD and moving onto the next DVD. The 100's of errors, and i mean 100's from seasons 1-7 showed that as a DVD release the series needs more attention to give the consumer better quality. But thank goodness the red sky had little to none errors.

Story/plot: I think This is the reason i gave this season a 4/5. Lord Dregg is horrible.... And im not kidding. He is some cheesey warlord who never does anything and relys on his army of logi-tech to do everything for him. Anyway Aside from the completely sufferable change of villans, the plot as an arc holds up good. Heres a summary: With the help of their new ninja ally Carter, the ninja turtles are going through extreme and uncontrolable mutations. Lord dregg has come to earth to rule it and has convinced everyone he is good (Kinda like the old twilight zone episode ""To serve men"") and is trying to make the city turn against the turtles. The turtles must stop Dreggs secret Attempts to enslave the human race and gain control of their new mutations.",1328227200,,1717,4.550161812297735

I liked the old shredder but it was getting kinda old how much he would be defended by them.  I like how much actions thier is in this last to seasons and i like how they are drawn.  I like the theme song to for some reason.  I have all the seasons and i hope they come out with season 10 so i can have a complete series. <3 TMNT,1317600000,,454,3.6770833333333335

It focuses more on this new guy, Carter, and that mutation they take on is just hideous looking. I miss the days of Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady. Now that was  TMNT. April is barely even in these, and as annoying as most think she is, she was my favorite character for the humans.

His spirit has made appearances to first Leo and then to all of them at the end of the fourth installment, and I believe we will not see more of him UNLESS he is featured in flashbacks and/or episodes that happened earlier in the Turtles' lives when Splinter was still with them.
