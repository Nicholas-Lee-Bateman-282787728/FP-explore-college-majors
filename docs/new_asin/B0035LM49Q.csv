8389128,5,B0035LM49Q,"easy to follow, great learning tool!  These Hal Leonard ""play along"" DVDs are a great way to learn some new stuff..",1434153600,,115,4.476190476190476
8389129,4,B0035LM49Q,"I just recently discovered the Hal Leonard Play Along series, and I can't get enough.  It's a lot of fun learning how to play songs that you could never figure out before.  I'm anxious to see new additions of these DVD's.",1415145600,,221,4.365853658536586
8389130,5,B0035LM49Q,"Every song has an introduction, with lessons showing the chords and riffs. Then you have 3 camera views: Fretting Hand with Tab, Wide View with Tab, and Both Hands Close-Up. With each view you have the option to hear the demo with guitar or the backing track without the guitar. These songs can be learned very quickly by intermediate players. Beginners will have to work a little harder, but worth the effort. The single disadvantage of this format is that you only see the tabs by playing the tab views. No printed tabs for these songs are included. Other than that, great!",1282089600,10,575,4.647058823529412
8389131,5,B0035LM49Q,"All three veiws of each song are helpful.  I really like the ""looking down view"" as I call it.  I purchased this for Robin Trower and enjoy most of the songs on the disk.  It is a great purchase for the price and has been accurate so far.",1275004800,5,238,3.9166666666666665
