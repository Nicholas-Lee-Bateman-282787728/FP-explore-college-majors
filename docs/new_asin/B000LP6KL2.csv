8177667,4,B000LP6KL2,"NOTE: the editiorial review is about the ""zizzle iz"" toy NOT the movie character. the dvd is NOT interactive allowing one to do this or that other than scene choice, susbtitle, and extras selection, etc..

editorial should read like:
A robot attempts to help a family return to New York, but after downloading songs from the radio he becomes a DJ and the family becomes rock stars.

nice story but dvd is only the 1st of the only 2 episodes produced (i.e., season 1 ep 1).

dvd is about a little animatronic and his experiences in the music business from radio to being in a band. based on zizzle iz toy (or is it the other way around ?). the story line basically starts with introduction of iz's what he is and goes from there. nice music.

however the dvd does NOT contain the 2nd of the only 2 episodes (i.e., season 1 ep 2) to be produced (was going to be a series on tv but got pulled after 2 episodes. the 2nd episode is about the son of the competitor radio station duplicating iz in order to change ratings of his station. story is about the 2 duplicates and their adventure with iz in the music world (radio and band).

it would have been nice for the dvd to contasin BOTH of the ONLY episodes produced. maybe the 2nd episode is out there on dvd but i don't even know if a vhs exists though you MIGHT be able see both episodes online. i could NOT find the 2nd episode recently .

season 1 episode 1 is ""iz and the zizles""
season 2 episode 2 is ""Will the Zizzles Sizzle or Fizzle? "" (NOT on this dvd)",1315612800,,1508,4.200692041522491
