8744806,5,B019D3J3I4,"Surpassed expectations.  Gorotica is fast, punchy, and gets right to the point.  Much like Gore Whore, this feature doesn't waste much time getting to the point.  A lot of morbid themes in this film.  Grimy, wretched, yet coherent and interesting.

I probably sound like I'm giving this movie too much credit, but for a fan of SOV old school cheapies, this was a stand out.  Dig it.",1461196800,4,382,4.626865671641791
8744807,3,B019D3J3I4,"Gorotica (Hugh Gallagher, 1993)

There was a time, not so long ago, when film really tried to push the boundaries. Jorg Buttgereit's Nekromantik and Nekromantik 2 were the beginning of a very brief, but very interesting, and seemingly worldwide, interest in the idea of the necrophilia movie. None of the films were all that successful-- this is obviously not the kind of thing that's going to get a big theatrical push-- but some movies were made that have stood the test of time, forcing their viewers to ask themselves questions about mortality and the possibility of the afterlife. While Gorotica was released in the same basic timeframe-- it came not long after Nekromantik 2 and just before Nacho Cerda's infamous Aftermath-- it's definitely not one of the test-of-time movies. Writer/director Gallagher was far less interested in the deeper meanings of necrophilic characters (and their paramours); he just had a jewel heist movie and wanted to add some extra spice. Needless to say, the reviews on this one over the past fifteen years have been pretty evenly divided. And, oddly, both sides are correct.

The story: Neil (Dingo Jones) and Max (Bushrude Gutterman) are jewel thieves working for the enigmatic Miss Miles (Dolores Jackson). After their latest job goes wrong, Max swallows a large diamond, the main piece from the job, so they won't be caught with the evidence. Unfortunately, he ends up getting shot and killed by a police officer soon after, leaving Neil with a rather sticky situation-- how to retrieve the diamond? Meanwhile, he's run into necrophiliac Carrie (Ghetty Chasun), who takes an immediate shine to Max, and promises to help Neil dispose of the body. Problem is, Carrie wants it fresh, and Neil needs to get inside. What to do?

I think a quick skim over that synopsis will let you know that you're not watching Forrest Gump here, but just in case it didn't sink in, this is not a movie for the squeamish (though the special effects are nowhere near as vomit-inducing as those in Nekromantik 2) or the easily offended (though there's less explicit sex than there is in... umm, most porn films). One you're past that, you've got a basement-budget flick that's surprisingly good in some areas, and not-so-surprisingly bad in others. The script is downright awful, but the actors take what they're given and do their best to make it into something worthwhile. It's an amateur production-- you won't mistake anyone here for the next Mel Gibson-- but for what it is, the acting is pretty darned good. The special effects, while not realistic or particularly well-executed, have a weird sort of effectiveness. The direction is borderline-competent, but it's obvious Gallagher has a vision and some good ideas, and I think given a bigger budget, he could do something better.

In any case, if you like this sort of thing, it's not half bad. If you don't, obviously, avoid it. ***",1223596800,12,2907,4.938650306748467
