These three monochrome movies were produced in the mid-1950s, a time when people feared an atomic war that could destroy most of humanity. Atomic bomb testing was believed to have caused changes in the weather. One horror movie suggested this radiation could cause mutations in creatures, such as ants. When they became gigantic they would prey on mankind, coming from the Mojave Desert to then smog-free Los Angeles. Other films were variations on the horror movies from the 1930s, such as the scientific stories about invaders from outer space. These lower budget movies accompanied the Eisenhower recessions in the 1950s. There was a fad for three-dimensional films, but they required exact synchronization to prevent a blurry movie. There were a few vampire and werewolf films too. Note the changes in the actors. Were they unhappy to appear in these works of art?

""Creature From The Black Lagoon"" (1954) presented a threat from inner space, the land beneath the water. You can compare it to the classic horror story from the dark ages ""Beowulf"" which also has a monster from the lake.

""Revenge of the Creature"" (1955) continues the story. The ""gill-man"" is caught and put on display at an aquarium. But he escapes to go wandering. Finally he is found on the beach. The police shoot at him until her returns to the safety of the sea.

""The Creature Walks Among Us"" (1956) was the last of this series. The creature adapts to living on the land after capture, becomes a witness to personal conflicts, then returns to the sea. Was this as good as the other movies?

The mummy films had an unusual creature that came to life to threaten the living. These seemed better than a humanoid sea creature. Did copyright laws or a lack of an audience limit the mummy films? Vampires and werewolves existed for centuries in the legends of many countries. The formula for the horror movies is to have a strange creature come upon the people to kill and terrorize them. Then a hero is found who can kill the monster and bring peace to the people. This goes back to when Theseus slew the Minotaur, or Saint George slew a dragon, to halt human sacrifices. Do people today still believe in sacrificing humans to appease Moloch?",1352419200,,2245,4.775773195876289

7838862,3,6303128653,"For those who admire the Universal monster series,this set of films reviews one of the most popular horror characters in the 50's,following the three films that brought the creature from the black lagoon to life. If to please one most focus on the packaging vintage set for the 3-pack as well as it's content even though the first film stands clearly better than it's two sequels. Perhaps the fun of owening them all together is the considerable aspect of enjoying a dark night and a bowl of popcorn while watching 3 of the most memorable films of the old black and white days of cinema.",996019200,2,587,4.6
