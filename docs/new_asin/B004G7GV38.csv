It is realistic and oddly thought provoking. Life goes on after a death in the family, whether we get the support we need from others or not! We can not resist the fact that tomorrow is another day another adventure. We have to keep going. We have to live with ghosts. We have to accept that there are selfish people who will not be there for us and that there are very kind and generous people who will be there for us. There is truth in this film.",1521158400,,627,3.9448818897637796
8428512,5,B004G7GV38,"Very well made movie.  Excellent acting by the veteran actors Girish Karnad, Om Puri and Sharmila Tagore.  The rest of the cast has acted their part very well too.  The music blends with the theme.  The reference to King Lear instead of being subtle is blatant and at time seems obsessive, a drag on the script allowing room for unnecessary melodrama.  This is Sharmila Tagore's last movie per her daughter.  Waiting for Ms. Dutta's next venture.",1392854400,,446,4.802631578947368
