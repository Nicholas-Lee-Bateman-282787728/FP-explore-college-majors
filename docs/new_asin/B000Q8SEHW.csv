8195184,4,B000Q8SEHW,"This is really a great video with some great demonstrations on it.  I recommend this to anyone with an interest in finding out more about Close-Range Gunfighting.  Just having a firearm does not automatically make you safe, you actually have to train with it! This video covers many of the situations you might encounter in the real world and provides training drills to prepare you to use your sidearm to deal with those situations.  Well worth the money spent, I have watched it repeatedly.",1346198400,,492,4.833333333333333
