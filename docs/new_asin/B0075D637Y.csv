8633815,5,B0075D637Y,As with all other reviewers this is an excellent comedy. Probably the most iconic of Laurel and Hardy movies and maybe the funniest and best. Upon recent of the DVD I was not able to play it on my DVD player - may need a universal DVD player. Plays fine on the computer.,1289088000,,270,4.113207547169812
