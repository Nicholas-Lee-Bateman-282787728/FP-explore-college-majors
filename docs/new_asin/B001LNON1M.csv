8318987,4,B001LNON1M,"Patricia Dainton is believable and effective as a blind woman at the scene of a crime. You will be impressed by this little-known actress and by all the cast of this lean, well made thriller.",1500076800,,191,4.485714285714286
8318988,5,B001LNON1M,"Very well acted by all (even though most actors were unknown to me).  The story moved along at a comfortable pace and was not overplayed like other ""blind person"" stories we have seen.",1482969600,,184,4.575757575757576
8318989,4,B001LNON1M,"I really enjoyed this old film. It had the right mix of suspense combined with a dash of comedy. There were warm moments, and even a bit of romance thrown in. The acting and writing are equally good. The pace is reasonable, especially for the era. This could easily be redone today without many changes to the script. For Dr. Who fans, the newsboy is a young Frazier Hines who played Jamie McCrimmon a Dr. Who companion from the early years of the show.",1482537600,,453,4.404761904761905
8318990,3,B001LNON1M,"Fair British murder thriller.  A blind girl sort of witnesses a murder in her apartment building.  The cops aren't too hopeful about her usefulness, but the murderer is not that negative.  I bought the Sinister Cinema DVD release some years ago and am not too happy with it.  The quality of the picture is poor and not too clear.  It would be nice to see a better version released.",1379721600,,381,4.463768115942029
