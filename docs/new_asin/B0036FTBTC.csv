8389977,5,B0036FTBTC,"This magnificent film touched me in ways that I'm not sure I'm allowed to discuss in full detail here on Amazon.com. From the set peices to the breathtaking cimematography, from the crackling dialogue to the Oscar-worthy acting, this film is absolutely flawless. It's a monumental film in the same vein as Taxi Driver, The Godfather, and Weekend at Bernies 2. Buy three copies of this film as soon as possible-one for the house, one for your best friend, and one for the person who has your heart.

P.S. I am, in no way, related to the astounding actor staring in this historical piece of art.",1264982400,3,593,4.647619047619048
