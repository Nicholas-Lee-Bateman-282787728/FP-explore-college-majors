1235440,3,B00000JNBC,"At its heart this is a good movie of a type they don't make any more; a love story with a little twist. It's heavily dated in terms of the way people act and dress, not to mention a lavishly poofy-haired James Spader and a grotesquely toupeed young-old Jason Alexander. Susan Sarandon is great, Spader is OK, and the rest of the cast may as well be extras. The plot works, but it's also a great visual tour of life in the late 1980s.",1497657600,,433,4.166666666666667

1235508,5,B00000JNBC,"Wonderful movie! Wildly sexy and funny.  Very touching and believable story.  It is the kind of movie that you keep wanting to go back and play over and over again.

1235509,4,B00000JNBC,"Society has a blatant double standard when it comes to relationships. It's ok for men to date and marry women young enough to be their daughters (Michael Douglas, Alec Baldwin, Donald Trump, Billy Joel), but heaven forbid if a younger guy dates an older woman. The Earth will stop spinning. I'm 30 and I happen to like older women. They're mature and classy. They're not shallow and they don't play mind games like younger women. And people talk that nonsense that older women can't have kids- maybe a guy doesn't want kids. Maybe he simply wants to be with someone whom he loves.

There are a lot of movies where an older male lead character meets an attractive, younger woman, but that's not what I wanted. There aren't many movies featuring a younger man and an older woman. The only other one I can think of is Notes on a Scandal, and that doesn't have a happy ending.

Susan Sarandon was such a hottie in the late-1980's and early 1990's. Even now, she's not bad looking for an elderly lady. I was surprised to see George from Seinfeld in the movie (back when he still had hair). And while smoking is bad and it will give you cancer, Susan Sarandon looked so sexy when she smoked.

This movie pertained more to the difference in class between the two characters than the difference in age (Max, the younger guy, was a white collar advertising executive while Nora, the milf, was a blue collar waitress). Max was insecure about introducing an uncouth woman to his high-society friends and family. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the sex scenes where the cougar dominated the cub (I'm surprised this wasn't given a NC-17 rating).

The movie requires some suspension of disbelief (after Nora left him, her fortune telling sister told him where she was). The ending was cliche, but definitely satisfying.",1448064000,,1797,4.713375796178344
1235510,5,B00000JNBC,Very happy with this purchase since I was unable to find the movie anywhere else.,1447286400,,81,4.466666666666667
1235511,5,B00000JNBC,"This ""Cinderella"" story has everything the vapid Pretty Woman lacked: Depth. Two heartbroken characters haunted by darkness and grief, great acting, and redemption that comes through the courage to take chances, not bubble baths and glamorous clothes, help one another find light in their lives again. A young James Spader plays a widower who is stuck in his grief. He meets an older woman, played with sass and uncompromising intelligence by Sarandon, whose dark sorrows have kept her stuck in her grief as well. A beautiful script and wonderful performances by two of America's best actors.",1445731200,,592,5.177083333333333

As the sparks fly,  some pretty fired up love scenes follow,  and their differences work for them!  (and the viewer!) . Hot!",1439769600,,311,4.581818181818182
1235515,5,B00000JNBC,"This is one of those amazing films that has slipped under the radar and you only hear about when someone refers it to you. I've recommended several times and people love it! It has a timeless look and feel and you would never guess it was filmed 25 years ago. It also has extreme repeat value, and I catch myself watching it every 2 months or so.

Susan Sarandon is phenomenal as always and this is my favorite credit of hers. She gives her character so much complexity and real human qualities that are rare to non-existent today in film. The scene in the bar where she talks about Charlie is when you want to hear ""And the Oscar goes to.."" James Spader is also excellent as is Eileen Brennan in a small supporting role.

I've written Shout Factory asking for a release that includes a Susan Sarandon commentary as they have a deal with Universal's catalog. I would love to hear Susan speak about this film and her role in it. It is a modern day classic that deserves special treatment. Also look for Kathy Bates in a brief cameo as Spaders boss the same year she did Misery.

I've read that the ending was reshot and you notice the longer hair with the actors. Apparently audiences wanted a happier ending than the original which left it more open to interpretation. Regardless, this movie is excellent is all areas of filmmaking and it's nice to see a relationship story that isn't typical Hollywood fluff and is still just as relevant today as it was back then. Highly recommended!",1439164800,,1485,4.5130111524163565

1235563,5,B00000JNBC,"I was anxious to see this once more, it has been so long. I can't explain how this was a break threw movie for me, it came out about the time that Hollywood became openly sexual, without being x rated. It also was about a young man and an older woman from different religions and classes. How I adored Susan Sarandoin, and her "" who gives a d--n attitude"" and James Spader a recent (young and up and coming, yuppie for short) young widower, Somehow this smoking drinking waitress found this young gorgeous man, who was spotless and she lived like a slob.

1235659,5,B00000JNBC,"This movie is exceptionally beautiful and interesting on all levels, and passed perfectly well the test of all tests: time. I saw it in 1991 and I loved it immensely; I watched it again a few days ago and I loved it even more.

White Palace has the freshness, beauty, truthfulness and steadyness of a true classic. The direction and acting are incredible; Susan Sarandon and James Spader not only give their best, they have a fantastic chemistry; Sarandon's presence is electrifying; Spader's natural reserve and beauty are fascinating. The progression of the story is marked by meaningful silences, excellent music, mesmerizing close-ups of Spader and Sarandon. The cinematography is superb.

The only detail I didn't really like is the very last scene, more precisely 'the kiss on the table' one: it is a bit too histrionic and artificial for me, not consistent with Max' character and behaviour--too bad the producers had to give in to the Hollywood policy and change the ending. The cheap theatricality of this last scene is quite embarassing and it's a shame we cannot see the original ending (bonus tracks). This would be a real treat. It appears three endings were shot and the third one (probably the less inspired) was released in this official version. I would pay twice the price of this DVD (or even better, of a Blue-Ray release) for the extras: the alternate endings, the deleted scenes, a commentary by Sarandon, Spader and/or Mandoki. I certainly hope Universal will release this movie again (soon), with the treatment it deserves, this time.",1349654400,,1558,4.9884615384615385

But what does he have in the hypnotizing world with Nora? We never see them talk. They have no relationship outside sex. And we already see that tapering off. They do nothing. Say nothing. Go nowhere. Have no interests. Life is about more than copulation and fellatio, no matter how skillfully performed. There are many hours spent that are not in bed. What did these people do during that time? He loves her? Yeah sure.....why?

Torstensen",1320192000,,266,4.659574468085107
1235667,3,B00000JNBC,"As a whole, `White Palace' works rather well.  In parts, it is kind of a mess.  It is a predictable film, and it teeters on the `too romantic', especially that ending that starts to fray at the fibers of the film's core.  Like I said, when you think of the film as a whole it is an enjoyable and even moving film, but when you pick it apart it readily exposes its flaws.

The gist of the film is that a younger, heartbroken man falls for an older heartbroken woman.  Neither of them really shares a common ground.  He is educated and wealthy and she is poor and crass.  But, they love to make love and they each share a horrible story of tragedy, hers trumping his by about a thousand.  Still, they are an odd pair that actually works because of their differences.  Their social standing (his embarrassment of her, her insecurity about herself) gets in the way of their happiness, but as with all films of this nature, love prevails.

The film never really explores the darkness surrounding these characters in the depth that it deserved.  I just wish that they weren't so preoccupied with selling the sex but allowed the tragedy to take center stage (and I don't mean the tragedies of past but more the tragedies of present; emotional tragedies).  The film at times tries too hard to be an adult film, complete with trashy music.  Sure, the scenes are steamy, but this story deserved better than that.

Spader is one of those actors I rarely get, and he is more stiff than anything else here (emoting depression does not mean resembling a log) but Susan Sarandon is a revelation as Nora.  She is snarky and driven and witty and seductive and believably crushed by her own past.  When she reveals her `loss' at the bar, the way she almost tries to laugh it off but can't hide the tear in her voice; it's flawless.  If the last scene had been eradicated from the film it would have played out better, but Hollywood is determined to hand out happy endings where they don't belong.  I haven't read the novel, but from what I read it seems to have been a darker tale, and that seems appropriate.  I just wish that Hollywood understood that `bleak' is not a crime.

See this for Sarandon.",1319414400,,2183,4.4646464646464645

1235669,4,B00000JNBC,"I'd seen this movie when it originally released on VHS and I thought it was OK, but felt no desire to re-visit it. It popped up again when I was researching some other movie and I was surprised at how positive the reviews were. I figured maybe I'd missed something and should give it another go. I did and I was happy I did. This turned out to be much better than I'd remembered.

Set in St. Louis, James Spader plays a Jewish, hot shot advertising guy who has a tiff with Sarandon, who plays an older, waspish counter girl at the local burger joint. They, by chance, meet again in a bar while both are a bit buzzed and things change. They now begin a relationship which is very touch and go for many reasons. But (and this is a big but) they fill holes in each others' lives. They both experienced the death of somebody they loved dearly and neither ever really recovered. Now there is hope.

This is a much more subtly nuanced film than I remembered. He's anal and a clean freak but learns to relax some. She has let her life go which shows in the disarray of her home. She now feels the need to get back on the stick and attend to the small things (like cleaning up a bit). There are some missteps and some hurtles that they may not clear, but I found myself rooting for them. I'd forgotten how it ended so it was almost like seeing it new.

The performances and production values are all pro level so the viewer is not distracted from what is happening on the screen. Spader looks great and Sarandon is as delicious as ever. Their scenes together always have something going on, whether it be sexual or confused or confrontational, but I never got the impression either of them was ever ""phoning it in.""

I noticed that one of the producers was Griffin Dunne, and he was never one to play the Hollywood Whore. He always tried to align himself with better projects, and this is no exception (except for maybe the ending which is pure Hollywood). That aside, this is a great ride and well worth your time.",1284940800,,2007,4.329787234042553

This is a very touching story between a really young guy and an older woman.  You don't see many relationships like this and it's nice to see on the big screen.

I was an extra in the last scene that was reshot.  I am so many years older and married and a mom and it would be so cool for my kids to see me on film.  I am in the Middle East now and would be ordering and paying the hefty fees to ship it over but it is not worth it as the movie is not suitable for my kids.

1235673,4,B00000JNBC,"I'm usually amused by movies with Spader in them, not that his character changes much from movie to movie, but then why change a good thing?  Likewise for Susan Sarandon who's good as well, though I definitely don't agree with the Amazon reviewer who calls this Oscar material.  Or I don't know - maybe this is what the Oscars are all about ... which isn't saying much for the Oscars.  This woman had no social graces at all!  First she backs old James into a corner over bringing her to Thanksgiving dinner, and then when he finally does, she manages to insult everyone at the dinner - and we're supposed to sympathize with her?  She was just rude. And while the party goers WERE rich and somewhat trite, no one was actually rude to her (except his mother - but this seemed to be her personality with everyone).  So for all the righteous indignation speeches made by Sarandon's character in other people's homes: A. I didn't beleive it, and B. it seemed misplaced.  Or I should say, I didn't beleive it because it seemed misplaced.  This is supposed to be the result of her inferiority complex for being a fast food worker and 15 years too old for James.  Still, the family should have scorned her more or really looked down on her so that her working class indignation could have seemed more warranted - as it was, I didn't buy it.  No one had time to justify her inferiority complex - she was too busy insulting everyone! Not what I'd call a moving performance.  But then she's not expected to be reasonable - this is 'drama' after all, not the girl scouts!

And still, this wasn't a bad movie.  Predictable most of the time, yes, but the story does move along once it gets going.  And there are some good just-this-side-of-the-R-rating love scenes which give Sarandan time to make up for what she didn't show in Rocky Horror Picture Show..  which brings up another issue - while Sarandon isn't in the flower of her youth, she's still looking pretty good here, and she's no dummy either. BUT -  we're supposed to beleive this hottie's working at a burger joint at 44?  MAD magazine would have had a field day..

Finally though, if you like Spader and Sarandon as actors then you'll probably like this movie.  Not incredibly beleivable, but then ""Love is a wonderous thing"".  Better than 3 stars so I have to give it 4.",1205712000,,2321,4.520383693045564
1235674,5,B00000JNBC,"Max Baron (James Spader) is a nice twenty-seven-year-old Jewish boy drowning in grief and self-pity over the untimely death of his wife. When he gets shorted at a White Palace on cheap hamburgers he picks up for a bachelor party of his best friend (Jason Alexander), in a fit of self-righteousness, he returns to the hamburger joint to demand justice and meets forty-three year-old Nora Baker (Susan Sarandon). The rest is, as they say, herstory since this captivating film is all about Nora. She identifies with Marilyn Monroe (she has posters of Marilyn all over her messy apartment and reminds Max that she has a similar name as Norma Jean Baker). Beneath all her bluster is a woman living on the edge. She mourns the death of her only child, but Nora is a survivor.

James Spader was thirty when he played in this movie although he looks about eighteen; and we forget that he is really the slightly  twisted Alan Shore from the television series ""Boston Legal."" Susan Sarandon recreates the role she did so well in ""Bull Durham,"" the older woman bedding the younger man, Tim Robbins. As the whole world knows, those two have been together since that movie as mate and mate. She and Spader engage in some of the hottest sex scenes you are likely to see that are every bit as torrid of those in ""Body Heat"" between William Hurt and Kathleen Taylor and Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie in ""Don't Look Now.""

Director Luis Mandoki manages to turn the Cinderella story on its ear in the character of Nora and asks the question if love can survive this wide an age difference and class chasm. We certainly hope against hope that it can, if seldom in life, then at least in this movie.",1193875200,,1686,4.613333333333333
1235675,3,B00000JNBC,"Susan Sarandon gives such a strong performance that the ""TV Movie"" quality of her vehicle is secondary. She doesn't transform the material; she just acts brilliantly, and manages to convey her personal enthusiasm for the sensuous and complex character. Interesting that she doesn't assert the ""Older Woman mystique"" here. That pupil dilating element flows naturally.
Of course, in the proverbial real world, her beauty and wit would have gotten her at least to the Management level in her work setting - a place (in the movie world) Max Baron (played in low gear by James Spader) would deem as common - revealed by his presumptuous confrontation over the missing burgers.
And, so, the socially/occupationally upwardly mobile White Collar Max makes a date with the stagnant but self-aware and content Blue Collar Nora.
Sarandon's approach is so subtle here that the viewer is challenged to decide if Nora's love of Max is real, or at least as deep as his is for her. Or are they merely joyful that a void has been filled? The electric shock of their passion is felt by the viewer - I'm reminded of movies like ""The Owl And The Pussycat"", ""Bodyheat"", or ""Atlantic City"", Sarandon's gem of a movie in which she plays a somewhat similiar role, though one of insecurity and naivete - when I reflect on this film. The relationships in those three efforts are essentially *wrong*, also.
Max brings Nora home for a big family dinner. The aristocratc guests do not exactly give her a warm welcome. Sarandon maintains her dignity while she is baited and while Max can't seem to find anything creative to say or do, as his Advertising background fails him in the clinch.
Jason Alexander has a supporting role - none of his post-1994 ""Seinfeld"" energy is found amongst these celluloid frames.

Nora Baker touched Max Baron's heart and soul unlike anyone had done since Janie(  his wife's) death and  allowed him to truly examine who he was and what would bring him a sense of peace and happiness for the rest of his life. The fast paced rat race of living the upper middle class Jewish existence in Ladue, Mo became sterile and meaningless when he realized that it was not too late to change his life i.e, leave St. Louis for NYC and go back to teaching (his true love) and finding the one person (Nora) whom he could be true to himself with!

1235694,5,B00000JNBC,"James Spader, a personal favorite of mine, stars with Susan Sarandon in this entertaining adaption of the Glenn Savan novel.  I own and read that too, and although a book is ALWAYS deeper in detail, I was not disappointed with this film.

Max Baron, a twenty seven year old Jewish widower coming from his buddy Neil's (Jason Alexander, pre Costanza) bachelor party, meets poor white anglo trash waitress Nora (Susan Sarandon) at ""White Palace"" restaurant.  He has come to claim six empty boxes that should have had burgers in them.  Instead he gets no burgers, just a refund and lots of attitude from a beligerent Nora behind the register.

After being thoroughly depressed and feeling sorry for his loss more than ever,  Max gets drunk.  On his way home, he stops in a country music bar for a nightcap.  A few gulps later, he is spotted by a cigarette puffing  drunken Nora, attracted to Max, she is therefore, swilling AND willing.  I don't think ANYONE would actually need drinks to find Spader attractive though.

After Max relents and lets Nora stay and have a drink, despite being surlier earlier...they end up back at her place.  It is then, that two consenting, inebriated adults begin their December/May romance.

What Max had intended as one night stand, somehow ends up being true love, despite the ethnic differences, social status disparity, and disapproving friends and family.  Max and Nora make-up, and break-up, and come to a crossroads in their relationship, but true love conquers all.

All the performances from the leads are well executed, you feel for Max.  His analogy at a party, where his friends are trying to find him a more suitable mate is terrific.  When asked if he likes the girl,  Max's says, ""There's No dust in her dustbuster!""  This sums up his feelings perfectly.  He doesn't WANT a perfect young girl, he wants imperfect older Nora.

I found this to be a warm, enjoyable romantic comedy/drama.  Luis Mandoki did a fine directing job, and the script adaption was fine in telling the story.  Jason Alexander was good as Neil, Max's best friend.  There were also many good minor roles of various friends in Max's circle of snobs that really made you root for Nora all the more.  A fun cameo was Kathy Bates in a small role as Spaders boss.

All in all, a winner that is definitely worth seeing, and adding to the romance selections in your film collection.",1014076800,,2391,4.75669099756691
1235695,4,B00000JNBC,"Luis Mandoki seems to be akin to dour and depressing pieces (Message In A Bottle, When A Man Loves A Woman) but works his somber mystique to greater effect in this undervalued ditty of opposites attracting.  This improbable tale of true love begins with 27-year-old Max Baron (Spader) wallowing in self-pity over the recent death of his wife and suffering the annoyance of bad service from a scanty burger joint called White Palace (think White Castle and you have a good idea of how scanty they are).  Retreating from a friend's bachelor party to haggle over six missing burgers, he harries a tired gal named Nora Baker and receives a gruff riposte from the steely waitress.  Later that night after the party favors and burgers have run out, Max solemnly retreats to a local bar for a drink and finds Nora hunched over the counter swigging vodka tonics and eyeing him like a scrumptious prize.  He rebuffs her every blatant sexual advance, but all the same she follows him outside begging him for a ride home.  They arrive at her cluttered domicile and Max is immediately sickened by the filth that surrounds him, insisting that he is okay to drive himself home.  Nora is adamant about him staying the night and the minute he is asleep, her lusty impulses take over and she seduces her inebriated guest right on her couch.
 Thus begins the unlikely and somewhat clichd rapport between a wealthy Jewish widower and a 40-something gal from the wrong side of the tracks with a closet full of skeletons.  The two main characters don't really have any compatibility other than their sympathies for the others' personal tragedy (of Nora's, you will find the truth about later on in the movie).  Little else draws them to one another besides their ravenous sexual appetites.  Sarandon and Spader certainly have the chemistry needed to make their debatable affair authentic, but when I discovered the original conclusion of the novel the film was based upon, it made more sense to me.  The finale chosen for this adaptation is the more favored because it is the typical happy ending that most people crave; it's just not realistic.  It evokes the warm fuzzy feelings we all like to get from our entertainment, but it mocks the truth and the author's hard work.  I admired it for its playfulness but when I think of how it could've ended, I would've valued it more as a work of art.
Sarandon, though far past the age most film czars would consider the closing stages of an actress' wondrous opportunities, still has the ability to carry a movie all by herself, no matter whether she is the story's victor or casualty.  It is here that she proves it the most, no matter how celebrated other roles may be (Bull Durham, Dead Man Walking, etc.).  As an over-the-hill, working-class sexpot, Sarandon displays more of an understanding and connection to her character than any she has portrayed previously, due greatly to the fact that she IS a seasoned actress.  Because of this, she is the strongest, worthiest and most memorable performance in this film, rising above Spader's almost unbearable morbidity and angst-ridden deportment.  Eileen Brennan is of mild interest as Nora's roving clairvoyant sibling Judy.  Jason Alexander barely shows any sign of the spunk he would create for his character on ""Seinfeld"" as Neil, Max's betrothed buddy.  Kathy Bates has a small but enjoyable cameo as Max's friendly colleague and Rachel Chagall is so ebullient it hurts us to watch.
Overall, ""White Palace"" is an enjoyable film despite its faults and has a great rewatchability factor because of Spader's and Sarandon's overt and plausible lustiness towards each other and the smart interpretation of their characters.  Fans looking to get a glimpse of either Spader or Sarandon in the buff, this is the film to watch.  There's a valiant but dignified show of skin in selected scenes and you will see why Sarandon is considered such an admirable role model for women her age.",980467200,,3955,4.846953937592867

A 15 year age difference jellies at the root  of his  conflicting, and sometimes shameful, treatment of her- he wrests  with peer pressure and the meaning of love, slowly letting her slip away.  or will he?  she's no spring chicken, but sarandon proves, surprisingly,  that she can do the sex-love thing with enough hay to burn the edges off  the screen.  just trust me; watch it.  you'll forget to munch the popcorn,  that's how good it is.",966297600,,686,5.054054054054054
