8406641,5,B003VC6F6W,Bill zebub has no limits. There is too much censorship in this world.  Directors like this are the best because they keep creativity alive. Political correctness is just a cult of brainwashed people that destroy language and art and freedom and life and.......,1453507200,5,260,5.046511627906977

8406645,1,B003VC6F6W,"Wow, this movie was absolutely terrible. I felt like I was being punished by watching this. I couldn't even make it past 30 minutes. The first 7 minutes is just full frontal naked women dancing. Then you have a skeleton with the thorny crown Jesus wore on the cross stalking these naked women and sucking the life out of them. I'm a Christian and hate when people spoof Jesus. I would never ever under any circumstances recommend ZOMBIECHRIST!!!",1327536000,2,445,4.717948717948718
8406646,2,B003VC6F6W,"From writer / director / producer / editor / Jesus-portray-er, Bill Zebub, comes ZOMBIE CHRIST. In this heart-warming fable, the druids have resurrected the zombified, skeletal remains of Jesus in order to bring in the new age. Of course, this requires wall-to-wall female (full frontal and beyond) nudity, clever biblical quips, long-winded theological discussions, slow-motion kung fu, romance, and a chocolate syrup-covered skeleton wearing a crown of thorns. Unfortunately, there's only enough material here for about 15-20 minutes, leaving over an hour of suicide-inducing dullness. Now, I love frolicking, tattooed nymphs as much as anyone alive, but even that gets old in a hurry! ZC is meant to be offensive / disgusting / funny. While certainly ""offensive"" to the religious zealot or barking clergyman, the rest of mankind won't much care about the blasphemous hi-jinx. The most ""disgusting"" parts are too outrageous to be taken seriously, leaving the anemic humour to carry this epic. If only this had been a short film...",1304726400,14,1032,5.3765432098765435
