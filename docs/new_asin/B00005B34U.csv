And there is a great wealth of rare and fabulous LOUIS PRIMA performance clips in this film highlighted by  extended clips from PRIMA's ground breaking 1959 ED SULLIVAN SHOW appearances..most having not been seen since the day they were first broadcasted I suspect. I am told that Louis didn't have too much to say except when his horn was in his mouth..I think this doc clearly brings that home. Good informative interviews with family memebers, managers and fellow bandmates, great info on the ITALIAN AMERICAN communities of New Orleans as well...thank you for doing this one Don McGlynn & Joe Lauro!!!",1158710400,9,659,4.990909090909091
1420714,4,B00005B34U,"It's all in the live footage. Interspersed among somewhat predictable interviews ( bar the talks with Sam Butera ) it's dynamite. For the ones of us who never got to experience King Louis in the flesh, this gives a hint of what it must've been like.",1155859200,5,249,4.434782608695652
1420715,2,B00005B34U,"I was a little disappointed with this film. I know the name, and a fair amount of the material, but was hoping to gain some insight to the Man. Got some, but not much. Maybe a bit too esoteric for the curious. Much of the information was glossed over. There is mention of ""The Lion King"", and Prima's influence on contemporary rock n' roll, but there is never any further exploration of these topics. I wanted to know the thought process behind the deadpan delivery of Keely Smith's on-stage persona, as well as a host of other things, but was left high and dry... This is probably common knowledge to the fan ""in the know"". However, for the rest of us... The footage is fantastic, but I never felt I really got to know Louis Prima, or even his work, really. Isn't that the point?",1144886400,5,780,4.386206896551724
1420716,1,B00005B34U,"Although I truly enjoy Louie Prima's music, this DVD does not due him justice.  The sound and picture quality is poor.

The performances are old and all in BLACK & WHITE!! The only parts in color are the commentary and the cemetary photo where he is buried.  Better to just buy a CD and listen to him perform. This DVD is way overpriced for its poor quality.

I do not recommend unless you just want anything and everything there is available on Louie Prima, no matter what the quality is like. I was very disappointed.",1105488000,13,519,4.431578947368421
1420717,4,B00005B34U,"I've been a Prima fan for many years.  In fact, my daughter, who was born a few days after I watched Louis Prima perform with his then new wife, is named Gia (for Gia Maione, of course).  My Gia has identical 4 year old twin  boys who absolutely love Louis Prima, watch the DVD each and every day, sing all the songs and do wonderful imitations of Louis and Sam Butera.  Ryan is always Louis and Nicky is always Sam.  Wish all Prima fans could see the twins perform.  Yes, we're all lovin' Louis.",1103587200,4,496,4.223404255319149
1420718,5,B00005B34U,"Great review of this jazz master's career, from New Orleans, to New York (where he penned the immortal ""Sing, Sing, Sing"") and on to his later triumph as a Vegas showman. His gift, and his gab, are clearly on display here through archive footage and kinetoscopes of early TV appearances with Keely Smith. Loaded with interviews, photos, recordings and rare films. If you think you knew about Louis Prima, this documentary will open your eyes. Among some of the funniest moments are some footage of Louis recording the Disney tune ""I wanna be just like you"" for THE JUNGLE BOOK. A great film about one of the 20th Century's great jazz artists.",1033344000,28,642,4.741071428571429
1420719,4,B00005B34U,"This DVD is great. Louis Prima was a little before my time in real life. I became a fan long after his death. This has some amazing vintage footage as well as some current footage of this legend of swing.
Its a great lesson on importance of showmanship.
It is thoroughly enjoyable.",1032393600,12,281,4.423076923076923
1420720,4,B00005B34U,"This is a nice bio of one of the legends of Las Vegas and beyond. Louis' life is explored from his family's immigration on through to his death in the late 70s. There are many insightful moments represented here thanks to interviews with music historian Will Friedwald, Prima's bandmates Sam Butera, Keely Smith, Gia Maione and others as well as members of Prima's family. Overall it's a nice production but I wish there could have been more concert footage where instead a song like ""Just a Gigolo"" is played over stock footage of the Vegas strip and people gambling in casinos. What concert footage there is though, is priceless with Louis, Keely and Sam hamming it up for ""Just a Gigolo"" and ""That Old Black Magic"" as well as a duet with Gia Maione on ""I Want You"" that is one of this video's highlights. The main problem with the video is that it leaves you wanting more. Much more.",999993600,35,886,4.54375

7936585,5,B00005B34U,"This DVD was priceless.  The old Ed Sullivan shows bought back memories of Louie and the gang from my years in the 50's and 60's.  The deadpanned Keely and the overexuberant Louie with the lively ""Witnesses"" could only be captured on video; not something that can be experienced with just listening to an Audio CD.  Too bad there is not more video of his Las Vegas performances.  Always liked Keely Smith's voice and after viewing this DVD I ordered a CD of her greatest hits.",1295740800,,476,4.564705882352941
7936586,5,B00005B34U,A true Las Vegas Entertainer for the Las Vegas Entertainers.  You will love seeing that there was much more to him than the joking comedy singer.  Truly enjoyed this tape.,1251072000,,171,4.666666666666667
7936587,4,B00005B34U,"If you enjoy the music of Louis Prima, buy this DVD - no ifs, ands, or buts.  Rare photos, movie clips, and television footage document Prima's career from his early years in New Orleans up through his final performances in the 1970s.  Interviews with Prima's brother, Leon, two of his five wives, Keely Smith and Gia Maione, saxophonist Sam Butera, drummer Jimmy Vincent, and others make this highly informative and enjoyable.  Of course, it is the Big Man himself who steals the show.  I guarantee that only minutes into this tribute to a great performer you'll be tapping your toes to his unique swinging style and understand why he was truly ""The Wildest.""  Enjoy!",1209945600,2,668,4.824561403508772
7936588,4,B00005B34U,"This DVD release of a film that won the audience award for best documentary at the Hamptons Int.film Festival in /99 is a welcome and most fitting tribute to one the best entertainers in the music world.
Watching Prima and his band was/is like watching a cross between a Mexican jumping bean and a volcano. They all jump around the stage until the time is right then they erupt with that beautiful musical explosion. The minute Prima sang he had you hook,line and sinker. I've seen very few entertainers with the energy Prima could put out on stage or on record and it is for certain we lost a giant talent with his passing.
The documentary goes from his birth in New Orleans right through to the very end of his life. The major failing however is the frustrating lack of a timeline throughout. Dates are given few and far between and sometimes it is hard to know exactly the when of what you are watching.
However there are plenty of movie and video clips shown throughout and the ones in the 50s during his high period are especially wonderful and appealing. In fact it leaves you wanting to see ALOT more of him.
There are plenty of interviews with close associates,members of his band and two of his five wives Keely Smith and his last Gia Maione.
Included on this DVD are video performances of ""Basin Street Blues"",""Oh,Babe"" and ""Waiting for the Robert E Lee"".Also there are audio only tracks of some very rare Prima sung songs,""Sing,Sing,Sing""(one of his greatest compositions),""Robin Hood"" and ""Please No Squeeza Da Banana"".
I was glad to see not only Keely Smith in attendance(what Prima documentary could be complete without her?) but also wonderful Sam Butera. I recall Primas'late 40s and early to mid 50s period on Mercury. He had some good and catchy songs(""Enjoy Yourself"" is a stand out) that fore told of things to come. Keely Smith was there but something was missing until Sam Butera joined the band in the mid 50s. Suddenly everything seemed to fall into place for him. Sam was really the spark plug that ran the Prima engine. And when you see Prima and Sam performing and listen to them on records(now CD)it is not hard to understand why.
I heartily recommend this DVD to all lovers of good music and espeically to all you Louis Prima fans out there. This is one essential to add to your collection. And to all you only familiar with his records/CDs and/or to those not familar with him at all I recommend this DVD as the perfect Prima primer. Get yours today and swing out!",1202774400,5,2494,4.606741573033708
7936589,5,B00005B34U,"Boy, you are lucky guys out there; this is still not available in the UK region standard (PAL), so I actually had to go out and buy a multi-standard DVD player so I could watch this DVD from amazon.com USA. It was worth it! Just being able to see the great man live or on tv shows is a must, and kids should know what a big influence Louis was to everyone, from Sinatra on thru.",1195516800,3,378,3.986842105263158
