1684550,4,B000062XE5,"I found and ordered this movie from amazon for just $8.93(including shipping costs) and I love it! The movie came within 4 days with standard shipping, much sooner than I expected. Anyone who is reading this review is probaly familiar with the book: ""Gulliver's Travels"" by Jonathan Swift, so I'm not going to go into detail over the basic story. The movie is sort of a light hearted look at class, power, tolerance, respecting views outside the norm,and being true to one's values, etc as shown thru out Gulliver's travels in these strange (at least to him and him to them) and distanr lands. Given that this movie was released in 1960, right at the beginning of massive social change and upheval, makes these lessons even more intriguing. My favorite character is the young giantess, ""Glomdolclitch"", played by ex ""Mouseketeer"" and future voice of ""Alexandra""(Josie & The Pussycats) and ""Wendy"" (Superfriends}, Sherry Alberoni. I like this character because she is not burdened with the old ways of thinking that has made her adult peers so ""backwards."" She respects and looks up to (pun intended) Gulliver's huge intellect, despite his dimuutive size, unlike the other giants,who view him and his wife, ""Elizabeth"", as inferior curiosities and risks her life to save them. A good movie for all!",1299801600,3,1297,5.0092592592592595
1684551,4,B000062XE5,I bought it because I remember enjoying it as a child.  As an adult I enjoyed it just as much.  This is another credit to the excellent work from Ray Harryhausen who's work I really like.  I'm intrigued by the ingenuity these early film makers had to created films like this.,1296172800,2,275,4.352941176470588
1684552,5,B000062XE5,"The correct aspect ratio (screen size) for this film, as it was filmed in widescreen, is 1.66:1, and is the format by which Columbia or Sony should have released this film on DVD.",1191283200,4,179,4.454545454545454
1684553,4,B000062XE5,"3 Worlds of Gulliver has some pretty high expectations to meet being that special effects master Ray Harryhausen was involved.  The master of stop motion model effects, Harryhausen was responsible for creating giant Cyclops, Medusas and battling skeletons in other films like ""Jason and the Argonauts"" and ""7th Voyage of Sinbad"".  Unfortunately, ""Gulliver"" did not call for such a roster of memorable creatures.

 Most of the effects have to deal with size, true to the novel by Jonathan Swift. Gulliver either occupies a world of giants, or a world where he is the giant.  Harryhausen pulls off these sequences quite convincingly using minatures, over-sized props, or perspective shots with the ""giants"" closer to the camera than the ""little people."".  Nevertheless, there are a few stop motion monsters that are in line with Harryhausen's other works- a giant alligator for Gulliver to fight in the land of the giants, and a giant chipmunk sequence that makes for one of the films best scenes.  Still and all, despite the shortage of stop motion monsters, Gulliver is  harmless entertaining family fun.  It is a well mounted production that still holds up today, and completes the collection for any Harryhausen fan.",1174348800,3,1218,5.1421319796954315

1684555,4,B000062XE5,"This was one of the first films I ever saw and parts of it stuck in my imagination for 43 years.  So, sitting down with my kids, I was very curious as to how I wd find it.  In a nutshell, it is great.

But the most rewarding thing was how much my kids loved it, in particular my son.  At 6, the whole story to him was fascinating and got him to ask me all sorts of questions, like, why are the Lilliputians arguning about such silly things and why are the giants so dumb?  That is exactly what Swift was hoping to do with this tale, which espouses many of the theories (rationality, the uses of science in human society, etc.) that were becoming popular with the enlightenment.  What a delight to discuss these issues with my kids!!  THen there are the characters, such as Gulliver's naivte, which leads to some life-threatening situations.  Finally, there are the wonderful special effects - Harryhausen had a certain genius for his time - which are crude by today's standards by still enthralling.

Warmly recommended for the entire family.  (Note:  I got this as part of the 5-film package deal of Harryhausen films, which cost just 1/3 more than this stand-alone version and lacks the documentaries, which I don't think are worth the difference in price.)",1137024000,3,1259,4.575892857142857
1684556,3,B000062XE5,"If you're considering a purchase of this title, but are wary because of the occasional misinformation and confusion regarding the original screen ratio and the preservation of this ratio in the transfer, then don't fret.  With no intention of starting a debate, I can comfortably state that the film hasn't been re-formatted to fit your screen (although this is inaccurately stated before the film begins).  Concerned that the studio/corporation had balked on an authentic widescreen transfer, I spent more time than I care to admit in pursuit of clues and/or answers without doing any severe film-scholar-like research.  Anyway, although you may encounter what appears to be a 16X9 transfer in the U.K. and EU markets, I don't believe that these are any more accurate than the supposed widescreen preview/trailer found on several of the Harryhausen Collection discs.  In fact, it's the very preview on ""3 Worlds"" for ""3 Worlds"" that solved the riddle.  Here's the deal:  It's a banded, or barred trailer (wherein the black bars at the top and bottom are actually hiding or covering the picture beneath).  Whether this was done for exhibition on a 1:85 to 1 or 16X9 big screen, I can't say, but the visual material in between the bars is composed the same as the ""supposedly"" cropped transfer.  I took a couple of easy-to-find images from the trailer and double-checked them by using the chapter search.  Anyway, you don't want the widescreen version of ""3 Worlds"" anymore than you want a widescreen version of ""Shane.""  It simply isn't the screen ratio in which these films were shot.  If you think I'm wrong, then please check for yourself.  Screen composition and visuals are only being compromised in the artificially ""wide"" versions.  Lastly, while viewing this watered-down, but totally delightful feature, you'll notice that the on-screen composition fits the 1:37 to 1 ratio, which is to say that the character group shots fit very comfortably, as does the entirety of the film's action, while there aren't any distracting pan-and-scan artificial edits that usually show up during two-shot dialogue sequences and the like... Please pardon this messy and long-winded response to the transfer complaints that I came across, but I felt sort of obligated to save some time for those of you who may want to view or purchase this title, but may (understandably) hesitate due to the feedback conflict.",1111968000,51,2402,5.081424936386768
1684557,3,B000062XE5,"Jonathan Swift's satirical novel is given the Ray Harryhausen treatment, and though most of the satire is lost, there still remains echoes of it.  For instance, the war the Lilliputians are involved in revolves around the best way to crack open your eggs...from the top or the bottom?  And of course in Brobdingnag, any unusual behavior is attached to witchcraft..sound familiar?
At any rate, this is one of the least visually impressive of Harryhausen's works, mainly because the script didn't call for a lot of the trademark stop action effects.  The squirrel and alligator are impressive, but don't come near any of the other creatures Harryhausen so brilliantly created.  For a 1960 film, however, the effects are impressive.
Kerwin Mathews, who gained his stardom with THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD and JACK THE GIANT KILLER is sort of a British John Gavin.  His dashing good looks and charming accent made him an ideal catch for the idealist Gulliver.  Jo Morrow (the original 13 Ghosts) played Gwendolyn, and June Thorburn (Tom Thumb) was Gulliver's Elizabeth.  The talented character actor Gregoire Aslan was a perfectly foppish Emperor, and Lee Patterson (Tv'S Surfside 6) a gallant prime minister.
While not a bad film by any means, GULLIVER just doesn't have the overwhelming magic of previous Harryhausen efforts.  But it is entertaining and I think kids will like it.",1087603200,8,1379,5.097777777777778

1684626,4,B000062XE5,"I remember watching 3 WORLDS OF GULLIVER on tv in my childhood and this movie was released in 1960, my birth year! While the story was simplified for a wide audience the foolishness of both the Lileputian king and the Brobdinagian king was entertaining to me then as well as now. The giant girl Glomdalglitch seemed much more adult and mature then the older, adult Bromdinagian king! After 8 years of being ruled by emperior (President) George W. Bush, the story satirising both war and ignorance, fear in our rulers and goverment, still rings true today! Kerwin Matthews as Gulliver is more appealing then Ted Danson in the same role. I remember feeling the peril of Gulliver and Elizabeth as Glomdalglitch helps them escape from the giant king and his court which have accused Gulliver of witchcraft! I read in ""Imagi- Movies"" magazine where Jack Sher, the director of Gulliver, said,"" We were planning the scene where this little boat like object (Glumdalclitch's basket) floats down the river with Gulliver and the girl, and the giants are throwing rocks at it. I said, 'Charlie( Charles Schneer) look , if they hit that little boat, we're in trouble. Give me 8 or 9.' Now those little boats probably cost $1.20 each. So we get up there, and the giants hurl rocks, and one of them barely misses the boat. I turn to the assistant director and say, 'You'd better get me some more of those boats.' He says, 'Charlie only had one made.' ' Well you could've heard me all the way to Madrid! I was so f***ing pissed off. I could've killed him! And Harryhausen- that was the only time I saw him mad. So there I was with one damned boat. I told the actors ' For God's sake don't hit it!' That drives you crazy, because you want them to come as close as they can."" Schneer was always trying to save money! I thought of all this as the giants were trying to sink the basket( boat) that Gulliver and his girl were in!! When our hero and Heroine are safe on shore they question whether it all happened or not but we can see Glomdalglitch's basket boat on the shore rocks behind them! The Liliputians and Brobdinagians reside inside of us, said Gulliver, and that is still true today! I was glad to get this dvd for $7.00 after paying $83.99 for RAY HARRYHAUSEN THE EARLY YEARS! That title has great stop motion puppet fairy tale shorts by Ray but the prices are crazy! If you have a region 2 DVD player then buy that dvd 2 disc set for just $14.08 from moviemars! But if you have a region 1 machine you'll have to pay much more for a region 1 copy of EARLY YEARS! See my review on EARLY YEARS on Amazon.com!",1374796800,3,2598,4.437238493723849

1684630,4,B000062XE5,"Who doesn't like a bit of whimsy now and then?

Yes, this movie is overly cute and the ending is a bit of a cheat, and no it's not that faithful to Jonathan Swift's book (they get around that though, with the disclaimer that the story is only ""based"" on his book).  As presented here, this version definitely marginalizes the classic in a manner unkind.  But it's impossible to stay angry because this movie is so darn................cute.  It helps that Kerwin Mathews does a swell job as Gulliver.  All the actors, more or less, do their job proud.  The story rushes along at a breakneck speed.  The music, by the accomplished composer Bernard Herrmann, is fun.  The biggest letdown is the lack of special effects by Ray Harryhausen.  One gator fight and that's pretty much it but for the basic job of turning big people little and vice versa.  If I had to fault this film for anything it's the crap ending they rushed through like there was a time limit placed upon the filmmakers.",1360627200,3,984,4.571428571428571

Still, for what it covers, it isn't all bad and in fact is kind of cute, in places.  It's really more for children than adults, but it's not too bad, overall.  If you're just looking for a good old fashioned no-brainer, this will fill the bill nicely.  As I said, it's got its cute moments and and least is not sickeningly sweet, like some versions of classics put on film.
