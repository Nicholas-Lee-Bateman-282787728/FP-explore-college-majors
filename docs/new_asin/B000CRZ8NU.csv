I know now that its basically a compacted version of a French/Japanese coproduction TV series from the 70's, so maybe not exactly a movie in the strictest sense; but that doesn't matter.  I completely agree with the other reviewer and the individual who commented on said review.  Watching this tape again was like stepping through a wormhole, temporarily cohabiting the body of my younger self and practically FEELING my parents' old blue shag carpet between my 6 year old fingers.  To date, I'm not entirely sure how i came to watch this in the first place.  Maybe my mother rented it, maybe it was some random archival cartoon Nickelodeon aired in the late 80s; it doesn't matter the source.  What matters is the effect it had on me.  I was converted, almost overnight it seemed into a child obsessed with all things oceanic.  It has become a subtle force in me that gravitates toward the sea, and i have zero doubt it was the impetus for me becoming an avid shell collector in my adult life, and enriching seems a gross understatement for this particular line of independent study.  This is, for me, one of the most timeless animated works out there, and one i look forward to sharing with my own children; highly recommended.",1464912000,,1360,4.70042194092827
8168298,4,B000CRZ8NU,"I saw this movie as a child, I think around 1987 or so. I don't know what made me think of it but I couldn't recall the name and it took a few hours of googling to find it using the knowledge of a dolphin and a rough range of dates. A few months ago I found a copy on ebay and watched it with my younger brother. Even though my parents thought I was odd for finding it after all of these years they still watched most of it with us. It brought back some good memories. The weirdest feeling while watching it 20 years later was knowing what was going to happen without being able to explain it.

The plot line of the cartoon is kept relatively simple, for children of course, and the music is catchy. My mom remembers wishing the tape would break so she wouldn't have to listen to the tune they play throughout the movie.

I don't believe this movie has even been re-released on dvd so anyone interested may be stuck locating a vhs tape and player.",1240358400,,947,4.141304347826087
