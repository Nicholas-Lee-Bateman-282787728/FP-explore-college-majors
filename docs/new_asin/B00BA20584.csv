8596105,5,B00BA20584,"I am an FEI dressage rider and this dvd helped me finesse my position in the lateral movements. This is a continuation of the 3 part series Position Position Position also produced by Alliance Farms.
I viewed the 3 part series after taking a Pilates For Riding seminar and a few of the things I learned there were not working that well for my horse although as a whole the Pilates made me more aware of my own position. The 3 part series contained explanations on why those things did not work for me and helped me make the adjustments to my riding to produce the results I wanted.
Eleanor is a fantastic teacher and her explanation in all of the dvds is very easy to understand. The instructions are not difficult to follow and the information is presented in such a way that the viewer can ""digest"" one concept before moving on to another. Practice can be done both on and off of the horse.
A lot of information is covered, and although this dvd could be utilised even if one did not view the 3 part series I feel that in order to obtain the maximum benefit that one should view the 3 part series first.
I am anxiously looking forward to the second part of Recipes For Lateral Movements.",1366156800,,1189,4.36036036036036
