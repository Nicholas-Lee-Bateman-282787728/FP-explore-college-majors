8550005,4,B00ACLICBG,"""Black Tide"" was the second ""Jack Irish"" movie broadcast on Australian television in 2012, a week after ""Bad Debts."" Both are based on novels by Peter Temple. Jack Irish -former criminal defense lawyer, now horse bettor, debt collector, and apprentice cabinetmaker- is paid a visit by an old friend of his father's, Des Conners (Ronald Jacobson). Conners wants Jack to find his son Gary (Nicholas Coghlan), who has disappeared, leaving his father to pay a $60,000 second mortgage on the house he lives in. Jack hires fast-talking researcher Simone Bendsten (Kate Atkinson) to find out more about Gary's employer Levesque and learns of a series of shell companies. Meanwhile, federal agent Dave (Don Hany) is looking for Gary and for his partner Dean Canetti (Lachy Hulme), who arrested Gary in Thailand as part of a secret anti-drug operation called ""Black Tide"". An investigative blogger specializing in corporate corruption is missing also, having written about Levesque. And Jack's friend Harry Strang (Roy Billing) suspects a competitor of drugging his racehorses.

I haven't read Peter Temple's novels, so I wondered why these film adaptations are being called ""noir"". There are no themes or predicaments in them that are characteristic of noir fiction. Then I read a bit of ""Black Tide"" online. The novels are written in a ""hard-boiled"" style reminiscent of Dashiell Hammett or Mickey Spillane, though they lack noir themes. Jack Irish is more cuddly in the movies than in the books. Simone Bendsten, though a minor character, is more interesting in the movie than in the book. She's more like a real researcher: impatient and opinionated. This is an entertaining mystery of the same quality as ""Bad Debts"". It is sometimes difficult to follow the logic from one clue or scene to another, a fault of both adaptations that may (or may not) be better explained in the books. I usually have no trouble with Australian or New Zealand accents, but something about the way some of the actors articulate or don't- causes me to miss bits here and there. It may be the attempt to create a gritty atmosphere. The movie is 90 minutes long.",1503705600,,2134,4.99438202247191

First hooked up with this program by way of an Aussie article about Guy Pearce. Had never heard of the character, the writer, or the Oz show produced over the past few seasons.

Since early 2010, there have been three films covering the work of novelist Peter Temple. His creation, Jack Irish, is an offbeat private investigator and sometimes lawyer whose background was anything but investigative. The non-athletic son of a legendary rugby player, Jack started out as a public solicitor. A partner in a flourishing law practice, married to a beautiful wife, and a man with a very bright future. Life was good.

Until he let alcohol interfere with his duties.

Work suffered as he let things slide; sometimes so blasted he was barely aware and only marginally functional at court. That unprofessionalism came back to haunt him in the worst kind of way.

One of his clients, despite being innocent, ended up doing hard time in prison. After getting out - his wife and his children were gone, his reputation was in ruins, and as a convicted felon he had no prospects. Broken and angry, he took his revenge on his incompetent lawyer.

First, by murdering his lawyer's wife, then killing himself - right in front of Jack.

It was his turn to live a destroyed life.

Buried for several years inside a bottle, when he finally climbed out, everything was gone. But he did have friends. With their love and support he build a new existence. Now he splits his time doing investigations - proper ones. In some measure a means to make amends for having dropped the ball all those years ago. And on the side also helps out a shady pair of criminal chums run a racehorse scam. Finally, he closes out his lonely nights apprenticing with a crusty master cabinetmaker working with wood.

The one thing he doesn't do is stop once he accepts an assignment.

Once he starts something - he relentlessly sees it through - no matter how long it takes or what it might cost him. Whether that's a client or the stubborn dove-tail joints on a dresser drawer - he won't quit. Jack won't ever let himself fail to complete a job ever again.

Unfortunately, his investigative projects trend toward the complicated. Cases that find him always seem to spiral rather quickly toward the secret and decadent lives of the politically connected elite 1% - their conniving and treachery hidden behind the facade of social registers, designer clothes, and small platoons of legal advisers.

The first film, '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jack-Irish-Bad-Debts/dp/B00ACLIMNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jack Irish: Bad Debts</a>' was a feeling-out process as the actors and writers learned their characters. One I would've given a high 3 rating. However, they hit their stride with this, the second film, 'Black Tide'.

A really excellent and engaging Aussie series well worth seeking out if you enjoy the old school detective drama.

Personal Note:

- One of the things I love about Aussie productions, I'm always adding to my Word Of The Day.

In this case: Hansard.

Had to pause and repeat several times before getting a strong enough handle to search for the term.

In this case the published official record of Parliament.",1400284800,2,3308,4.983636363636363
