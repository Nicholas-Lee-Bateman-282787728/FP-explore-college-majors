Oh but NO, look up a movie and if say 3 different companies has the same movie out you will see the same reviews on each listing. Well for this movie I'm talking about the ALPHA version, it sucks ! It's very very Grainy, I bought this knowing Alpha has awful stuff out and to save $4.00 I'm now going to have to throw it away. So stay away.",1513296000,,437,4.152941176470589
8065713,4,B0009RS0CE,"I never knew that Faron Young had acted. I loved him as a country music singer so when I found out he had acted in a few films, I searched Amazon to find them.  I found this one, and I loved it.  The quality is poor, because it was a ""B"" type movie to begin with, but its standard 50s-60s western fare.  Marty Robbins is in it, and a number of great character actors like Lee Van Cleef.  If you like old black and white westerns, you will love this one.",1482883200,,453,3.9450549450549453

8065715,5,B0009RS0CE,"I love Marty Robbins. I was hoping he would sing in this movie, but he didn't. No matter you can't go wrong with Marty Robbins and Faron Young. This is a very old movie and isn't up to modern film quality, but easy to watch. If you are a western fan then this is a must see dvd.",1411603200,,278,3.810344827586207
8065716,4,B0009RS0CE,"I really liked this movie.

My only problem was Marty Robbins and Farron Young did not sing one song.  I was thinking I would hear all these wonderful cowboy songs and not one single note.

The movie was fun to watch and it's nice to watch a movie without all the violence and swearing!

Anyone know of any old cowboy movies with lots of singing?  Good singing.",1367452800,3,361,4.3283582089552235
8065717,3,B0009RS0CE,"I ordered this movie hoping it was another that I had seen in a theater about 48 years ago, but it was not. In the one I recalled: Marty Robbins had a much larger part and became involved with a saloon girl who worked with Falena the girl in the song, ""El Paso."" However, this one was also pretty cool. Faron Young played a sheriff, (which he also was in real life), and Marty Robbins played an outlaw, much to my surprise. Jim Davis was wickedly perfect in his role of over-bearing, land-grabbing bad guy. It was obviously copied from an old film, kind of seemed to skip info in certain places in the plot. Maybe it was that way originally, or just the copy. Still, I enjoyed the movie, and I am glad it has been preserved on DVD. Apparently, the one I was remembering has been lost, and that's too sad.",1361145600,2,804,4.261437908496732
8065718,5,B0009RS0CE,"Fun to watch old 50s style Western about a rogue group of former Union soldier that swindle a former Mexican officer out of a wealth of land that he helped settel some of the territory's poor people on so they can continue to grow their crops and live in peace. This is only the crux of the story. A federal Marshall and his father, a federal Judge come to investiagte allegations of abuse towards the settelers by the now ""owner"" of the land who wants these people off the land so he can run his cattle operation.  The story is well thought out and the action is typical of 1950's Westerns but very enjoyable to watch even for younger viewers. I would consider it slightly more violent than a Gene Autry style show.",1254614400,5,716,4.383458646616542
8065719,5,B0009RS0CE,"Raiders of Old California has everything to love about a B Western. There's plenty of action, with hombres biting the dust by the score, and an over the top performance by Jim Davis as the chief outlaw. And it's chock-full of those errors that makes watching these films such a hoot. Even though the story is supposedly set in 1840s and 1850s California, the land grant being fought over is supposedly ""from the Pecos to the Rio Grande and north to Santa Fe"", placing the setting solidly in Texas and New Mexico. All the uniforms are post-Civil War, and the weapons are Colt .45s and Winchester repeaters, weapons developed in the 1870s. The guns of course never run out of bullets, and even the ""wild"" cattle are domestic Herefords. Even the Comanches are misplaced, since they never made California their home.

But what's not to like about a film that has more than enough ridin', fightin', and shootin', and Marty Robbins cast against type as a vicious killer.

Raiders is the B Western at its best.",1182816000,6,1003,4.693181818181818
8065720,5,B0009RS0CE,"Almost everyone has seen The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, featuring Lee Van Cleef, but most people don't realize that in the 1950s he was legendary for his roles as bad  guys in low budget westerns.

Most of those movies never made it cable or VHS so they have mostly been forgotten.

That's why I enjoyed seeing this Lee Van Cleef western vehicle to get a look at him several years before he becamse much more famous in The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.

It's a fun low budget western and worth watching.",1164672000,4,502,4.252631578947368
8065721,5,B0009RS0CE,"""What an absolutely charming and exciting feature film (Raiders of Old California) - but I would expect nothing less from a feature film starring Lee Van Cleef and Jim Davis. It's such a change from the usual stuff they used to grind out in Hollywood. This one has a REAL story, with REAL performances and breathtaking action. I can watch it endlessly. Great fare, A2ZCDS - keep them coming.""",1146528000,3,392,4.695652173913044
