3170628,3,B0017CW5PI,"I am not going to review either film here, you can go punch up each separately here to check out what others have to say. I do have to wonder though what possible connection there is between these two movies though? One is an (unwanted) revival of hack icons from a few decades back, the other is brilliant though unappreciated comedy from a beloved comedy troupe. I would say that the closest connection between the two is their genres, but that would be a real loose connection. On second though, THAT does not even work, since Back to the Beach is found in the ""Barf"" section at Blockbuster.

Think my comments are over the top? Let me assure you, they aren't. Back to the Beach is SO bad, that Brain Candy sells both here and on ebay for more than Brain Camdy WITH Back to the Beach. That's right, the consumer public have spoken. Back to the Beach is nothing more than a bonus feature to Brain Candy that is so horrible, it makes the DVD worth less money. My rating is in accord with this fact. A normal 4 or 5 star film looses points by having Frankie and Annette muck it up.

Ok, I figured it out. Both movies seem to have a blue background. Nice job, Lionsgate!",1240963200,11,1169,4.3090909090909095

3170641,5,B0017CW5PI,"Brain Candy is a must-have movie for any Kids in the Hall fan. I owned the VHS version of this movie for years, and I searched for it on DVD for years after VHS went the way of the 8-track player. I was absolutely delighted to finally find it on DVD, and I was thrilled that it was packaged along with the campy, made-for-TV reunion/homage to the classic Frankie and Annette movies, Back to the Beach. I like Frankie and Annette movies almost as much as I like Kids in the Hall, and this is a fun, perfect pairing.

3170644,4,B0017CW5PI,"Buy this DVD, watch Brain Candy and I promise you that your life will be altered irrevocably for the better. If you haven't seen Brain Candy then your life is a empty shell of what it could be. This movie changed my life! I grew taller and women found me more attractive after my eyes had been opened to the glory that is this film. I never realized that I could be happy until this film showed me the way. By sharing it with others I have gained life-long friends.

I am however, completely baffled as to why they packaged it with Back to the Beach though. I mean basically it's a free bonus movie that you'll watch if you get REALLY bored. I won't because I've heard of the internet, so if I get bored, I look there for amusment. I don't know if you've heard, but the internet is the number one source for cute pictures of kittens, puppies, and various other baby animals. If you don't believe me, I suggest that you take a look for yourselves. Also showing Back to the Beach to friends will destroy friendships. Your social life will be decimated! Forcing them to watch is actually considered tourture under the Geneva Convention. I'm not kidding, it's an actual war crime! Not even the Brief cameo by the Comedy Genius Pee Wee Herman can save this movie from it's own huge vortex-like sucking. Save your time, friendships, and your sanity, avoid watching Back to the Beach AT ALL COSTS!",1328572800,3,1390,4.450980392156863

3170649,4,B0017CW5PI,"This is a difficult review for me to write.  I purchased this Double Feature soley for the Kids in the Hall classic Brain Candy.  As big as The Kids in the Hall were, in their day, I am surprised how difficult Brain Candy is to find.  I was even more surprised to see it paired with a beach movie spoof.

How rare must it be to find a fan who loves both movies?  So, I was not surprised to see people baffled by the movie Brain Candy.  If you didn't watch The Kids in the Hall, and just happened on to this movie as part of a double feature...then you are no doubt stunned by Brain Candy.  Good, be stunned, that is exactly what made the Kids so relevant.  They were a Lorne Michaels (SNL) ""discovery"" around 1989 or so, who were undoubtedly shunned by the mainstream due to their brand of comedy....the world wasn't over it's homophobia yet.  And, they had 5 super successful seasons on spanning HBO and Comedy Central (if I am remembering correctly).  But, their humor was a bit much for prime time...or even ""not ready for prime time"". They were doing skits that made SNL skits seem like something you'd find on Sesame Street.  While Dana Carvey was dressing up like the Church Lady and saying ""Isn't that special?"", the Kids were dressing up like hookers, office women, Queen Elizabeth, white trash girlfriends, etc and bypassing the catch phrases for some of the most hilarious bits known to sketch comedy.  Each of the Kids, independently, could have been considered the most diverse sketch comedy actor in his day...much less all of them together. Even now it is difficult to write about the Kids and not get a sinking, nostalgic feeling in my stomach.  The Kids in the Hall had a way of delivering their characters that was so convincing that each one seemed like a real person, seperate from the actor.  But, I digress...

The movie Brain Candy contains a decent mixture of those classic characters, and the creation of some new ones to love.  Mark McKinney's pharmacutical company CEO is based (more than loosely) on Lorne Michaels himself.  He is the CEO of a waning drug company in search of the next big drug.  The Kids, as a group of misfit scientist, discover a drug that will trap you in your most fond memory (complete with hilrious flashbacks of those memories).  In line with reality, the drug company rushes it into production before the downsides are fully known.  The drug is on the way to solving all of the world's problems when things go wrong.  The Kids play all main characters, and with spot-on accuracy as usual.  Keep an eye out for Scott Thompson as the husband who is in denial about his ""orientation"", this character alone provides numerous memorable laughs.

I don't know about Back to the Beach because I haven't, and probably won't watch it. Any true fan of Brain Candy couldn't possibly make the transition from the Kids to Frankie, Annette, and Gilligan.  But I do know that Brain Candy is cutting edge comedy that, if I were to take the pill Gleemonex, would result in me being trapped in a moment in the early 90's when The Kids in the Hall ruled the sketch comedy world.",1313712000,4,3111,4.553956834532374

3170653,5,B0017CW5PI,"Whoever's bright idea it was to pair these two seemingly disparate comedies in one package falls into that gray area of genius and insanity.  My opinion falls into the former camp.  Before the days of mega-plexes I used to love it when the cinemas showed double-bills(sometimes triple).  You never knew what you were going to get.  My all-time favorite pairing is ""The Story of O"" and ""E.T."".  Don't ask.  I remember in the winter months the local UHF station used to show beach movies.  The Frankie-Annette vehicles were the best of the bunch.  They weren't great but they were disarming and helped keep the chill off your bones.  To me ""Back to the Beach"" serves the same purpose as TV's ""Happy Days"".  It's a nostalgia trip about nostalgia.  It's kind of like the ""Brady Bunch"" movies they made in the Nineties whereas Frankie and Annette have emotional ties to the early Sixties but have to confront a more permissive Eighties culture.  Since this was released in 1987 you have nostalgia for both the Sixties and Eighties if you're so inclined.  The comedy is more on a sitcom level but I had a persistent smile on my face.  The real bonus here are the numerous celebrity cameos notably Stevie Ray Vaughn and Pee-Wee Herman.  O.J. Simpson's cameo can be forgiven because his notoriety didn't start until several years later.  I used to watch Comedy Central in the Nineties when they showed ""Ab-Fab"" and ""The Young Ones"".  ""Kids in the Hall"" were on but it never really piqued my interest.  After seeing ""Brain Candy"" I may have to revisit the series.  If a description of this flick could be used it would be ""Pythonesque"".  That said, the Pythons didn't follow normal story structures whereas ""Brain Candy"" has more of a linear story line.

3405154,4,B0017CW5PI,"Sure, Back to the Beach is awful... but in exactly the way it was intended to be! Campy and fun with all these former icons never taking themselves too seriously. This is a dumb, predictable, but thoroughly enjoyable goofball of a movie with a great beach-camp soundtrack. ""It's SURLY, not Shirley!"" Don Adams, Bob Denver, Pee Wee Herman... and I almost forgot the world's loveliest lady, Lori Laughlin is also in it! Grab some popcorn and enjoy the corn.",1262563200,11,455,4.772151898734177

8265616,4,B0017CW5PI,"... I don't even know what Back to the Beach is or why they paired it with the Kids In The Hall movie (which, as far as I can tell, you can't get by itself).

But anyway... Brain Candy. Love it, flawed as it is. How can you be a KITH fan and not love it? So many great new characters... I, for one, was happy they came up with new stuff rather than just going back to the characters from the show.

Let me know if a standalone disc ever becomes available!",1439164800,,455,3.881720430107527

8265622,5,B0017CW5PI,"I bought this to watch Back to the Beach and wasn't all that interested in Brain Candy, but when I finally sat down to watch it, I loved it too!  I love Back to the Beach though, it is one of my favorite cheeseball movies.  I love the son, Bobby.  I love all of the cameos from Fishbone, Pee Wee Herman and so many other folks.  It is really funny, there are fun songs and silly dances.  In my book, it's a classic and I love it.  If you like corny 80's flicks then you must watch this and love it....or else you have no real sense of humor and don't understand 80's comedy!!!!",1360454400,,577,4.017543859649122
