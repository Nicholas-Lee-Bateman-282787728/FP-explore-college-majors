8026133,3,B0002CR09A,"The Iron Fisted Monk is a fairly decent film for the Kung Fu enthusiast.  Of particular note is Sammo Hung playing a lead role...in 1977 - so the film shows its age, even if Sammo does not.  Most Sammo Hung films I've seen are those made in the last 10 years where he is either a secondary character or a film's lead action director behind the scenes - and he does great work.

For me, this film further validates Sammo Hung's legitimacy.  I really had no idea his film career stretched this far back - so for understanding the context or development of Kung Fu films, it has merit.  If you are wanting to see a modern type Martial Arts film, this is going to be much different.  It is a style of film that often gets lampooned and becomes the stereotypical Kung Fu film depicted in the U.S.  If you can get past this aspect, there is a solid Martial Arts film here.",1506124800,,866,4.2439024390243905

8026135,2,B0002CR09A,"Not Sammo's best.  Also, I'm very used to Sammo movies that while a little violent and sometimes creepy, generally have a family friendly atmosphere.  This is the first time I've seen a Sammo Hung movie with actual nudity.  There is in fact a rape scene and it's very disturbing.  Not enjoyable.  So families that might watch Sammo movies together, steer clear of this one.",1419811200,,373,4.765625
8026136,4,B0002CR09A,"Sammo does an excellent job in this film (once again).  He is probably one of the only 70's gong fu stars who could actually act, and it adds to the film.  The reason for the 4  star rating - a lackluster ending.  The film startled me at first (very graphic rape scene) but then fell into the all to familar formulaic ending.... while there's nothing wrong with a formulaic ending in the kung fu genre, the better films have a strange or demented twist (see ""Thundering Mantis"" ).  Worth the money, but not a classic.",1148688000,5,517,4.4
8026137,4,B0002CR09A,"Warriors Two or Prodigal Son. While those two movies are true 5-star classics, Iron Fisted Monk just seems to come up a bit short, both in the action and the execution. While the fight scenes have typically good Sammo choregraphy, they just aren't QUITE up to his usual standards (in my opinion). However, the story is quite good, and make no mistake, the fight scenes are still very satisfying.

  As with any Sammo movie, be prepared for comedy to be mixed into the otherwise serious storyline (oftentimes very lame or inappropriate humor, by Western standards). This Fox DVD has a fantastically restored picture and sound (I always recommend watching with the Chinese audio track and English subtitles), and although there are no extras on the DVD to speak of, the price is a real bargain.

  One more important point to make is that this is NOT an uncut version of Iron Fisted Monk. The brutal rape scene in this movie is MUCH MORE extended and graphic on the Hong Kong issued versions of the DVD (so much so it is pretty uncomfortable to watch). Fox obviously used a cut print for this DVD. This really shouldn't matter to anyone, as the cut parts (about 20 seconds worth) add nothing to the story, but I am telling you so that you know.

  Iron Fisted Monk is a great movie for anyone who enjoys kung fu films, or even those who fondly remember watching 'Kung Fu Theater' on TV in the early '80s. I recommend Warriors Two or Prodigal Son first (both available from Fox), but if you enjoyed those, check out Iron Fisted Monk!",1141776000,3,1530,4.575091575091575
8026138,5,B0002CR09A,"Here is yet another excellent kung fu movie done by Sammo Hung.  The fighting is outstanding consisting of multiple kung fu styles facing off against each other, all done with superior speed and precision.  Also sword and other weapons battles round out the action.  There are still a ton of fight scenes but not quite as many as some of his other films, probably short by just a couple.  The story is good and has decent acting.  Briefly it is about Sammo leaving the Shaolin temple and settling in a town run by gangs and other power hungry men who always do what they please.  Sammo gets indirectly involved and is forced to restore some authority.  It is done well enough to keep your interest throughout and contains some scenes not normally seen in these type of films(nude, rape, a whore house).  I was quite surprised with the amount of nudity shown(female).  This movie is definitely not for children.

The sound is very good, Dolby 5.1, and can be in chinese with or without english subtitles or english dubbed.  The dubbing is done fairly well, I was pleased with it.  The picture is extremely well restored and is very clear and sharp.  It is also in an anamorphic widescreen format as most Fox/Fortune Star DVD's are.  Some other Fox/Fortune Star films I reccommend are The Magnificent Butcher starring Sammo Hung, Knockabout starring both Yuen Biao and Sammo, The Prodigal Son starring Yuen Biao and Lam Ching Ying, The Young Master starring Jackie Chan, In The Line Of Duty 4 starring Donnie Yen and Cynthia Khan, and Duel To The Death starring Damian Lau and Tsui Siu Keung.

The Iron Fisted Monk is definitely a good addition to any kung fu collection.",1095897600,14,1669,4.687285223367698
