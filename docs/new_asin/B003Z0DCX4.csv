4232105,5,B003Z0DCX4,A must see film.  I really like the acting and the plot of this movie.  I have told all my friends about his film and they liked it too.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes a good scary thriller.,1350518400,2,209,3.9285714285714284
4232106,5,B003Z0DCX4,I love that MON is not a typical blockbuster movie. It is not predictable and it does not have a bunch of cheesy catchy lines. This movie feels real...which I believe makes it scarier than other Horror films. There is no clear answer as to why the killer is killing or why he chooses certain victims...you are left feeling uneasy and disturbed by the events and the unanswered why. This sort of elusiveness in a horror film is impressive.,1350432000,2,438,4.556962025316456
4232107,5,B003Z0DCX4,This movie has been watched several times in my house!! Crazy scary and great plot! A true definition of a must see!!,1350432000,2,117,4.363636363636363
4232108,1,B003Z0DCX4,"THIS ""MOVIE"" IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!!  I'M THINKING THAT THE PREVIOUS REVIEWERS WERE PAID BY THE DIRECTOR.  EACH SCENE WAS LAUGHABLE AND VERY NON-BELIEVABLE.  I WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY AND TIME SPENT WATCHING THIS PIECE OF CRAP BACK!!!!  IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME AND MONEY, WATCH ANYTHING ELSE!!!!",1350172800,3,300,5.061224489795919
4232109,5,B003Z0DCX4,this movie is NOT reccomended for the faint of heart. It is by far the scariest thing i ever saw. I cant really tell you nything without ruining it but i highly reccomed it,1337299200,3,172,4.088235294117647
4232110,5,B003Z0DCX4,"M.O.N., (Mistake of Nature) is a superb example of what could very well be a cult classic.  I was awe struck by all the intricate cinematography, and the attention to detail.  Presenting this film in black and white really enhanced the intensity of every shot, and the fear level was definitely magnified by this.  There were several scenes that really reminded me of the same vibe of a Hitchcock film.  The scene of the young girl running down the hill is absolutely beautiful and terrifying at the same time.  I would strongly recommend this film to anyone wanting to support really great independent horror.",1299974400,3,610,4.826923076923077

8409885,1,B003Z0DCX4,The 5 star ratings had to be friends of the producers of this horrible flick.  It wasn't scary.  It was just tiresome.,1389830400,,118,4.318181818181818
8409886,4,B003Z0DCX4,"If you love a good horror movie and love to be confused, well this is the flick for you. Absolutely one of a kind.",1378080000,,114,3.7916666666666665
8409887,5,B003Z0DCX4,"This movie is great! The black and white really helps give it an eerie feel similar to Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and there's plenty of violence throughout. Everything a horror movie should be.
Also, the movie focus is on the plot, the characters are just there to make it work. There is no giving the murderer a back story to justify the deaths, which I think a lot of horror movies focus too much on. And there isn't a long, cheesy back story for how the victims end up there, its more of a quick this-is-how-they-got-here-now-let's-move-on set up.",1373587200,,550,4.680412371134021
8409888,5,B003Z0DCX4,"M.O.N. is a Awesomely Creepy Film! I love the Black & White choice to film this Movie and the soundtrack is Super Creepy, reminds me of George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead! If you like torture films like Toby Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes, then M.O.N. IS a Film to watch! I would love to see a part 2 to this story.",1359244800,,366,4.169014084507042
8409889,5,B003Z0DCX4,"Review:  It's very obvious that someone had a lot of fun making this film.

It is fun-filled with clichs that actually work if you set back and enjoy them. (teenagers separating when they should stick together, etc). It is obvious that this is low-budget production however, I think, well put together.

It does start-off somewhat slow, and it isn't a horribly fast-paced film, but I think this adds to the viewing enjoyment.  I liked<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-O-N/dp/B0043Z108E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M.O.N.</a>&nbsp;how it incorporates psychological-horror which  really makes it more creepy.

Overall, I really enjoyed this film.",1359072000,2,681,6.3478260869565215
8409890,1,B003Z0DCX4,"Very banal & overdone plot. There's an evil clown and the film's black and white and there are girls with boobs who die. Everyone dies. The end. Oh, and here's a bit of text before the credits to make it seem like it's ""based"" on a true story. You know the drill.",1357948800,,263,4.076923076923077
8409891,1,B003Z0DCX4,"This movie is a joke!  Once again proof that Amazon ratings are not accurate - likely some HS student made this movie and then got a few of his friends to give it a good rating so they could make some money.  Seriously, any HS amature with a camera could make a better movie than this!!  There was no real theme and the acting was terrible!  If it was possible to give a -5 star I would.",1357257600,3,387,3.987012987012987
8409892,5,B003Z0DCX4,"I am a huge fan of black and white films. New or old, if done right it adds a TON of character to the movie. It really adds a lot to this movie. It's a great horror film to watch during this time of year! There are a number of very suspenseful scenes that keep you guessing at what is going to happen next.",1351209600,3,306,3.796875
