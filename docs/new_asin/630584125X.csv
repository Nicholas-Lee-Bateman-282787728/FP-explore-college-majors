1082874,2,630584125X,"In January 1973, Elvis filmed his awesome Aloha From Hawaii TV show.  THAT is the video to buy for a great look at Elvis.  He plays the same songs as in this show, but he plays better in the real concert.  Here, he is tense, boring, unprepared and stiff.  He completely forgets ""Burning Love,"" he has mistakes in a lot of his other songs, and he does LESS songs than in the live broadcast.
The Elvis presented here is more along the lines of the 1977 Elvis, you know, the one who skipped verses of all the songs in ""Elvis In Concert.""  1977 brought a fat, nervous, unfun Elvis, much like the Elvis here -- nervous and unfun.  Do yourself a favor and spare this for the TV broadcast.  (I bought them both around the same time on VHS but could certainly live w/o this one.)",1031961600,18,771,4.239726027397261
1082875,5,630584125X,"I actually prefer this rehearsal to the original Live ALOHA broadcast.  Elvis is more relaxed and loose compared to the official ALOHA Concert.  One interesting note is that after this rehearsal, Elvis got a haircut for the live broadcast.  His hair is much longer in this alternate version.",991353600,9,291,5.020833333333333
1082876,5,630584125X,"I own the VHS Video of Elvis: The Alternate Aloha.  I own the original release of it.  This is the second release of it.  I'm so thankful that I got it when I did, cause the first release of it that I have, is unedited, uncut, nothing was taken out of the first issue of it that I have, but on this second issue of it, they edited out 2 very important songs; ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" and ""Johnny B. Good"" because of legal issues. the 2 songs were up for renewal of contract and because of that, those 2 very important songs were edited out of the video. It's a Great Video, Awesome to say the least!  Editing out those 2 songs did take away what Every Die-Hard Elvis Fan like myself should NOT be without, but they just did what they had to do by law.  Anyway, This Video is just the greatest, even though they edited a few min. out.  I MEAN THIS, ""NO ""TRUE"" ELVIS FAN SOULD BE WITHOUT THIS VIDEO"".  If you are a ""True"" ""DieHard"" Elvis Fan like me, go ahead and order it!!

7896234,5,630584125X,"IF you are an Elvis fan you will enjoy this. It's the afternoon concert in Hawaii. Different suit, his hair is long (he had a stylist come in and cut it before the big world wide concert). The lights are off. It's better that way. It has a better feel.
He makes a few mistakes in lyrics, but boy, does he do a lot of songs. His voice is great. This DVD records it all as good as can be for a 1973 video taped concert. Don't expect 2017 high deff ok?
The man was a legend for a reason. Here you have a skilled singer and performer. He's shy during this concert, he is timid because he is no doubt thinking about going before the world in the biggest broadcast ever presented on earth. Yes, this is music history, and of course Elvis is the guy who does it. He didn't let his audience down.",1506816000,,788,4.0576923076923075
7896235,3,630584125X,"You could tell he was really nervous through out this whole concert. The ""Aloha From Hawaii"" concert given by him the following evening he was far more relaxed as he appeared on stage and really sung his ""heart out"" for this one!!!  IT IS BY FAR ONE OF HIS BEST CONCERTS AND NO ONE HAS TOPPED THAT ENTERTAINMENT HISTORY SINCE!!!!",1441756800,,329,4.483333333333333

7896237,2,630584125X,"If Elvis Aloha from Hawaii  Deluxe Edition DVD set was not available, this would be great.  Unfortunately that set is out there.  On shoppbs.org you can get the 2 DVD set for the same price.  On the pbs version you get this rehearsal concert as well as the full concert and the broadcast version of the concert.  Much better deal.  The concert itself is great, sound is good, and video is good for early 70's.  When I bought this one, amazon did have the full concert but it was twice as much as SHOPPBS had it for.",1428105600,,515,4.247422680412371
