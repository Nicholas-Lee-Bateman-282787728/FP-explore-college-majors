3545662,5,B001E50RVC,"I've got a pretty bad temper on occasion, but it is fueled by real issues.  One of my issues was with the staggering mental health sweep that took place starting in the sixties.  My theory is that this was done out of a sociological study of countries that let dictators or the like come to power.  Possibly it was fueled by Nixon's election, an observation of how Stalin and Hitler rose to power, and the difficulty it proved to remove such men from office.

The theory behind the Ginsbergs of the world is that fear and suspicion is brought on by not being relaxed, which synergizes with the other in a sort of emotional feedback loop, thus allowing each to prey on the other and create a heightened sense of alarm in a person.  Result; a survival mode by the normal everyday man has no place in world fraught with social problems where, in theory, men are trying to get along with their fellow men, for such instincts undermine social progress, and create misery and destruction.

The Ginsberg, and general psychological/psychiatric, solution is to make vices that help people relax available, and to change one's frame of mind to subdue primal instincts that, left to run on their own, or in a heightened state of awareness, will create tension and result in violence and havoc of some kind.  The tactic of the Ginsberg mind is to, seemingly at random, toss in non-sequitars to show how silly seriousness can be.  Because such a frame of mind helps fuel the pillars of suspicion and tension that allegedly is responsible for things like the Vietnam War.

The only problem is that this is wrong, and Buckley demonstrates by asking Ginsberg astute questions of what to do when faced with an implacable enemy who doesn't see the virtues of being relaxed and non-suspicious.  To follow the Vietnam example, what started as a domestic insurrection, that culminated into an outright rebellion, was seen by the Soviets as an opportunity to expand their influence, and we, the United States, in turn pressed to stop them.  Unsuccessfully, I 'll add.  That conflict did not result from paranoia nor a mind ill at ease.  It stemmed from a people who were tired of their French masters, and were then sold a bill of goods by way of Stalinist Russia.  No amount of relaxed mindset could have stopped that war.

The one thing the Buckley and Ginsberg agree on was the ill summation of the studies of drugs on people, as they were incomplete at best during the time of this program.  But, even here again, Buckley shows his sharp observations when asking Ginsberg his course of action and opinion based on facts.  Facts he disputes, and facts that Ginsberg fails to deliver.

Ginsberg also shows his very thorough and astute education when confronted with the psycho sociological problem and solution of domestic strife (criminality associated with drug use, as an example), and how that might be magnified on an international relations scheme of things.  He is no slouch in an argument in spite of his silly behavior.

Again, Buckley shows his disagreement, and we refer to his previous questions, and the questions from the audience to show the pitfalls of the ""just relax"" approach to solving the world's problems.  Indeed, Mister Ginsberg does not endear himself with his off the wall antics, but, we do appreciate his more artistic and academic approaches to interacting with Buckley.

This is an excellent example of how the social psychologists, the social engineers of modern globalism, have misfired and mis-stepped with their philosophy and approach to solving problems of the human heart.

It is an excellent portrayal of how people like myself had to contend with minds like Ginsberg for 40 plus years, who had little to no respect for anyone less they were of the likes of Buckley or themselves.  You may not like Ginsberg, and I for one do not, but he does give Buckley some salient points in the midst of his theatrics.  Even so, I still hate him and those who ally themselves with their agenda to change the world.  A change that I cannot stop, and has come home to roost.  It will fail in the end, only I won't be there to see it.

Worth watching from beginning to end.",1355011200,3,4176,4.730662983425415
3545663,5,B001E50RVC,"Fascinating video which poses the timeless question: ""What kind of idiots were we in the 1960s that a hack like Allen Ginsberg were ever taken seriously?""

Buckley lets the silly hard Left poet hang himself through the devastating tactic of politely listening to the drug-addled fool spout off at length.  Ginsberg is obviously wary of Buckley and wisely so---the best way to discredit a phony intellectual is merely to let him speak and speak and speak.

For players of the Firing Line Drinking Game, be sure to do a shot whenever WFB ""twinkles"" at Ginsberg.  (And make sure you don't have to go to work the next day).",1296604800,8,619,4.703703703703703

8296311,5,B001E50RVC,"Of the poem Ginsberg reads (""Wales Visitation"") Buckley actually says, sincerely, ""It was quite beautiful."" There was once a time when conservative thought and intellectual rigor and even civility were words that could be used in a single phrase. That time has passed. It died with Buckley, I think. American society is the poorer for it, and so too -- mirabile dictu -- is the American Left. Buckley -- disagree with him on many points, as you will -- would not have stood for the kind of intellectual terrorism that the tea party wingnuts perpetrate on Republicans today. The tea party is America's Taliban.  There is no conservative left standing today who has the courage and the stature to confront them. Into this sad vacuum strides Donald Trump. Imagine Trump facing Buckley on ""Firing Line.""",1438905600,2,799,4.9185185185185185

8296313,5,B001E50RVC,"Ginsberg is amazing here especially with his reading of ""Wales Visitation"". Even though Buckley was pretty much against everything Ginsberg talked about, he was still respectful and let him talk about whatever he wanted.

There is no lack of challenge in this discussion and it certainly takes a bizarre turn when Ginsberg chants the Hare Krishna, but their is also a poetic reading in the interview and a discussion on language and it's use.

8296318,3,B001E50RVC,"I have watched several DVDs of the Buckley ""Firing Line"" series. I lived through the sixties (and remember them). Allen Ginsberg had great appeal to the youth of the day. In retrospect, he seems, at best, to be an eccentric artist. So be it. Although I had my University Library purchase other Buckley DVDs for educational usage, I will not request acquisition of this one. The narcissism of Allen Ginsberg overshadows the academic/historical value. Given his popularity, he does, however, merit accolades for doing his ""thing"" well. My modern terms, he would likely be deemed a performance artist.",1355875200,2,598,5.112244897959184
