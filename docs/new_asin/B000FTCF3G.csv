2584385,5,B000FTCF3G,"it seemed to me that some of these people were on ""monster""dose's so much so they couldn't be productive if they wanted to.i know people who have been on maintenance for 30 years or more.and they work and are productive.being in recovery myself,i would never presume to say what a person should do to stay off of dope.but the down side of methadone maintenance is it is like a leash,its like the best you can hope for is 5 takehome bottles.the one guy in the special who wanted to detox,was discouraged by the clinic counselors,and taken down so fast that he got very sick and started using again.i don't know if the clinics in nyc are federally funded or not.but it seemed to me that the clinic had a vested interest in keeping people on meth.i believe there should be a ""ceiling""dose,and the opportunity to safely detox if thats what the person wants",1225411200,5,852,4.57516339869281
2584386,1,B000FTCF3G,"I was excited about this movie when I first heard about it but after watching it I realized that they fell victim to the ""hype factor"". What I mean by that is rather than give you an accurate impression of what life is like for 90% of those patients being treated at methadone clinics in the US, the director of this film instead decided to take a small sliver of unsuccessful Methadone patients and portray their lives as if they were the norm (trying to make for a better story). After-all showing a bunch of clinic failures falling all over themselves begging for money in the streets of NY would make for a much more interesting movie than a bunch of success stories about people that look just like you and me living ordinary lives. While there is a small number of clinics in depressed areas of major US cities which are like the clinic environment in this movie the vast majority of clinics have a very successful track record with patients that represent a wide cross-section of the communities where they are located. Sure at any clinic you can find a few people who just signed-up and are therefore in pretty bad shape. While you are at it you can even find a small percentage of patients who are not at all serious about their treatment, but you will also find that the majority of patients are successful in their treatment, working and living happy healthy normal lives. Methadone patients are often employed and work in everything from retail to medical research. Some are even senior citizens living on their social security. Many patients you will find are going back to school getting their high school diploma, many are attending college to further their careers, but no matter who they are and what part of the community they come from the vast majority of them are serious about their treatment and are drug free.

I'm always disappointed when I see videos with these so called methadone addicts stumbling all over, drooling, mumbling, etc. As at any respectable clinic if you came in acting like that you would not be given your medication. Clinics are run by doctors, nurses, and trained therapists. A clinic nurse or doctor will not medicate a patient who is obviously intoxicated. Clinics also perform random observed and un-observed urine analysis tests and will even administer a breathalyser to make sure patients haven't been drinking alcohol or using drugs while in treatment. And when you are in an actual methadone treatment program your daily dose of methadone does not cause euphoria, impaired motor skills and speech, etc.  Some people will get a little tired an hour after taking it when they are new patients but that is nothing a cup of coffee can't fix. The people that you see who are on methadone and are obviously all drugged up are mixing other illegal or legal medications with their methadone or they are not legally prescribed the methadone that they are taking (therefore taking doses of methadone which are well above what would be prescribed to them had they been an actual patient at a clinic).

Methadone is an amazing tool in the treatment of opiate addiction (which is a very serious and complex addiction). You can take an individual who is in the height of their addiction living on the streets, stealing, etc. You can with the help of methadone stabilize this individual preventing any of the negative symptoms of withdrawal therefore almost instantly stopping their drug seeking behavior (which is the root cause of any addicts desire to participate in illegal activity). This individual is then able to concentrate on getting counseling, finding employment, finding a stable home environment, etc. None of which would be possible without methadone since the individual would have to continue their drug-seeking behavior in order to just prevent withdrawal symptoms.

Methadone is nothing short of a miracle for those addicted to opiates (both Heroin and also prescription pain killers). To show only one small percentage of patients on methadone, those who struggle much more than average will only serve to further propagate the myths and stereotypes which scare away potential patients every day from a treatment which may (if given a chance) actually save their life. And that I'm afraid is the sad truth...",1191801600,78,4267,4.889502762430939

It is an accurate and compassionate account of drug addiction and of a population of opiate dependent people who also become addicted to benzos. It is very useful for the professional therapist and anyone curious. It made me more appreciative of the impact the witness has to someone's transformation. The filmaker is curious and actively listening to people we, the public, try to avoid. There are people who come out from the shadows and tell their stories with vigor.

2584389,3,B000FTCF3G,"the first time I watched this, it was in my i.o.p. group, at the methadone clinic I go to. my only  problem with this documentary is the misinformation. methadone already has a terrible reputation, and I was hoping this would shed a better light on it. Unfortunately, this is not the case. if it wasn't for methadone and the clinic I go to, I don't know where I would be. of course, there are people there, who still use and mess around. but the majority are people who work very hard on their recovery and treatment. there are all types, accountants in suits, mothers and fathers, construction workers, fire fighters... it helps these people live a normal and productive life, like myself. its a shame this documentary didn't show that, and showed the few who are still struggling. it could turn addicts away from methadone, who could of benefited from it. when I was still using, i heard all the false information about methadone, and i wouldn't go to the clinic because of that. who knows, if there was better information out there, maybe i would of went sooner. imagine the amount of people who never give it a shot, just because of movies like this, and whats said on the street. i had gone to rehabs and detoxes, nothing had worked for me, luckily i had found methadone and was able to turn my life around. i wish that's what they had shown, the truth about methadone, and that it can really work. oh well.",1463788800,,1412,4.515625

I also found that it was shoppily edited and directed, with little care taken to film the interviews in a way that made them look anywhere near professional.

That being said, it's hard not to feel for the recovering addicts being interviewed.  At least in that regard, the documentary was successful. Also, there were some interesting tidbits about how methadone is conceptualized among addicts.

2584432,3,B000FTCF3G,"I found this documentary too biased and slanted toward recovering addicts, or those addicts claiming to want recovery.  Methadone is widely used for relief from chronic pain suffered by those who are not addicts or probably will never be.  I have been on 60 mg of Methadone for over 20 years due to chronic pain caused by extensive arthritis throughout my body, fibromyalgia-like muscle pain, and neuropathy caused by being diabetic.  I do not like to use opioids and have detoxed from Methadone several times, by myself, and without the pain, nausea and vomiting usually accompanying withdrawal.  After several weeks the pain from those diseases, which never went away, increased, and I had to go back to Methadone.  My doctors wanted to change me over to drugs like Vicodin, Norco, Percocet, or similar drugs containing acetaminophen but I declined due to possible liver damage from side effects associated with that drug.  I've stayed with Methadone because it works well for pain control, it does not have a liver damaging drug associated with it, and it is not expensive and it is well within my Social Security income budget.  A good documentary should show all sides of a story.",1416528000,,1185,4.954545454545454

As a nurse in a psych unit it seems that the unsuccessful greatly out weighs the successful, but that's because those are the cases I see most. I don't usually get to see the success stories, because they don't need me. But let me say, we don't need the ""feel good"" movies. We don't need out conscious stroked. We need to be shook up and woke up. There are hundreds, thousands of people out there hurting daily. As a society we are broken and hurting and the addicts are living it daily. I think this documentary does good displaying that. From an education stand point I would have liked to seen more information presented from a medical stance but over-all I liked it.",1411776000,2,782,4.514084507042254
2584436,2,B000FTCF3G,"I completely agree with the first post above by J. Monty. There are many success stories within methadone clinics, but instead of showing them, they choose to show the failures because lets face it, Happiness doesn't sell. The whole country has such a bad opinion of methadone because they only choose to notice the negative aspects, and the people who are not actually trying to get clean, they notice the ones who are still using, and using benzos while on methadone. There are many people that have successfully completed the methadone program and have gone on to productive lives (college, work, etc.). Ive noticed that whenever they want to open a new methadone clinic in a neighborhood, all the residents fight against it very strongly. What they fail to realize is that it is a positive thing. Because they are basically saying I would rather they stay junkies and rob and steal from us in the neighborhood, instead of at least giving them a chance to get clean"". It also bothers me when addicts talk bad about methadone, saying they won't go on it because its ""too much work"" going to a clinic every day, and being controlled by a substance or a slave to substance. Which is ridiculous because that's whats already going on in their lives with addiction. It is just the fact that they won't get high, just get well. You don't hear about people robbing and stealing for methadone do you? It would work much better if the majority of users that get on methadone were actually ready to try to get clean, but sadly they usually get on it for negative reasons. It really is a shame for the ones who do the program correctly and fix their lives, they fall through the cracks and get lumped in with the bad ones.",1410393600,4,1713,4.583061889250814

2584449,2,B000FTCF3G,"In my humble opinion Methadonia is a biased depiction of people who utilize methadone as a treatment to drug addicition. In this film one only sees addicts who appear to have no hope of recovery if using methadone.(i.e.liquid cuffs, being on methadone for 30 years, etc) It is simply untrue that most on methadone do not go on to have normal lifes and are not weaned off of methadone.. Many who follow their program of recovery are successful yet this film failed to portray that. I would have appreciated the film more if it had not proprogandized the use of methadone in recovery as hopeless. I think that films like these fail the public because of the misinformation. Although I am aware that there are those who abuse methadone and do not recover there are those who do recover and the producer should have portrayed them as well.",1405468800,10,835,4.648648648648648

Thankfully I survived this passage 30 years ago, and if you have not yet crawled down that path, a crooked one littered with the detritus of chemical pleasure, then let this excellent film serve as a cautionary tale of one of the nearly inevitable steps along that sad path that  almost inevitably must be followed should you choose to ""Chase the Dragon"", that top rung of forbidden pleasures.  If you have a friend or relative who is on this path, then watching Methadonia  will give you the insight required to appreciate the pathos of that near dead-end existence that comes from looking too hard for insights and experiences.

2584469,4,B000FTCF3G,"The interviewer is very good at establishing rapport with a group of people unlikely to be open with him.  As a nurse retired from many years in addiction services, in which many of our patients were on methadone, I can say this film is about 75% accurate.  It strays from the truth in its optimism.

Methadone is very useful in ""harm reduction,"" i.e., there is a dollar value that can be placed on thefts that do not occur, interventions that don't occur by the State Social Services, foster families, transmission and treatment of serious disease through prostitution and IV drug use, to say nothing of the costs of law enforcement & imprisonment for drug offenses.  However, it's rare that people in a methadone program are motivated to get off it entirely.

Millie, the counselor, is excellent and spot-on in her demands of clients.  How she does it every day is beyond me.  Except, I did it every day, knowing the likelihood of any one intervention working was 1 in 40.

The interviewer and filmmakers did NOT do enough research into addiction--that comes through.  It's common knowledge among addiction professionals that addiction changes neural pathways in the brain permanently.  Addicts will NEVER feel as good again, and the longer the use, the less good they will feel.

Praise to them for acknowledging the last little bit of methadone maintenance is the hardest for addicts to get off--the last 5 or 10 milligrams is often where people go back to using.  I have been a medical professional long enough and read enough current research to be ambivalent about the dosing.  Low dosing (under 70 mg. usually)--is futile.  It won't keep clients off street drugs.  Very high doses (300+) put a client at risk for respiratory depression & death if combined with anything else, which is a given.  Do clients nod?  Yes, they do.  Even at medium-low maintenance doses.  Millie is so right about this.  I've heard stories from ""bad night of sleep"" to ""resting my eyes"" after shaking the arm of two people nearly passed out against each other.

I was concerned for the baby's placement with the parents, given their continued dependence on methadone.  The film portrays the family unit very rosily--and not what happens when the drug runs out or when things get nasty.

Although overall the film was good (these aren't easy people to like, but I spent a lot of time in their company.  When you get the know them, you see how hard everything becomes for them.) the filmmakers also picked an unusually old group of drug addicts--people in treatment, especially in no-frills places, tend to be much, much younger as a whole.  There is no conspiracy to keep people on methadone.  The waiting list is long.  Most people do not pay for it.  The alternatives are usually prostitution, theft and using street opiates.  Most facilities allow a gradual detox.  Methadone is an old, cheap drug--but I have my doubts about the suboxone racket.

It's unfortunate that when money is tight the first services that are cut are for mental health, and addiction is a disease of mental health.  That's currently going on.  The wealthy state I live in has slashed the number of mental health beds available, while pouring money into TRANSPORTATION projects, especially road building--as if we need more roads.  Addicts are not a sympathetic group, nor or the chronically mentally ill--so it's roads we get, instead of help for people to live more productive lives.

Yet all fail to realize that some of the most dangerous/killer substances are 100% legal such as alcohol and cigarettes.

Another issue is Methadone as a viable drug to treat a person for chronic pain as well as a good pain killer for geriatric patients.

2584474,1,B000FTCF3G,"This ""documentary"" is almost fact-free, and presents the least successful outliers of methadone treatment as though they were representative of methadone treatment in general.  The actual details of the program itself, all of which are subject to strict Federal regulation, was never mentioned at all.  There was a great deal of out-and-out misinformation, including that the doses were so high that they needed bigger bottles for take home doses.  Anyone with any actual knowledge of methadone treatment recognizes this as completely untrue, yet this ""documentary"" was happy to leave it uncorrected.

This is an exploitative and myopic view of a small number of people in one clinic in New York City which grossly and irresponsibly would lead the viewer to believe it is indicative of the state of methadone treatment in general.

It is not.

The filmmaker should issue an apology, and should be aware that there are likely ruined (and even ended) lives thanks to the misportrayal of recovery which this ""documentary"" puts forward.",1338076800,3,1032,5.224242424242425
2584475,1,B000FTCF3G,I watched this movie when it came out. At the time I was on methadone. I was extremely disappointed by it-this film only shows one side of the story of methadone. It only shows people who are still abusing other drugs. It completely ignores the large number of patients who do well on methadone and get their lives back. This film just perpetuates the negative stereotypes associated with methadone treatment. This serves to shame people who are doing well on methadone. A balanced documentary would have shown both sides-people who are doing well and people who aren't. Instead it plays into people's expectations by only showing the bad.,1269907200,16,639,4.925925925925926
2584476,1,B000FTCF3G,"This was a terribly done video about the methadone maintenance program. First off. People are not supposed to be using other drugs whilst on the program. These people were all using benzodiazepines and it made them look like a bunch of junkies. Methadone if taken correctly is a life saving treatment. If taken with other drugs it then defeats the entire purpose behind the program. Those people are a disgrace and hinder the progress of not only thier recovery but others that may watch this video without any real knowledge. I would suggest the A.T.Watchdog site if you want to correctly take methadone for positive outcomes. Methadone is not a drug to get high on it's a medicine to stabilize your life on to get rid of bad habits aquired over years of negative use. This video is a farce and worthless.

Edit 2016...
I got off of methadone in 2011. I tapered from 170 mg per day down to 20 mg and jumped off. The following 2 months were a living hell. If I could do it over again I would taper down to 1 mg and then start skipping days before jumping off. It did help me for awhile then I started using benzos just like this documentary. I'm a total hypocrite, but I am now sober and that's all that matters. I eat a cannabis brownie once or twice a week at the most when I get the urge to get high and that does the trick without any crazy addiction or withdrawal. The journey is difficult but I will never go back to opiates or maintenance therapy again. I'd rather be dead to be quite honest. I got onto suboxone after relapsing on heroin and that was just another 1 month of hellish withdrawals at the end and I even tapered this time to like 1/4 mg. Be sober and if you're gonna do something eat a brownie. Peace.",1237248000,15,1722,4.3312693498452015

I started heroin at age 17..used for 40 years and wound up on methadone for 16 years. I finally got off by lowering my dose and smoking pot all day, every day for a year. That was 7 years ago..now I'm 73 with Hepatitis C..there are times I still miss the highs, but, honestly, I know I'm better off. This film portrayed addicts as failures..not so.

A very informative film nonetheless and I've learned quite a bit about benzos and how additive methadone (liquid handcuffs) can be. God bless you Suzie and your new born and i hope that you and and your family are doing well. Millie, my hat goes off to you and keep up the good work and remain hard (tough love) on them.
