2609131,5,B000GG4Y6E,"If you are a Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd fan, this trio of movies is a great selection all wrapped up into one package.  This is definitely a ""must buy"" for those who love movies of mystery, crime, suspense and drama. The title ""Edge of Your Seat Collection"" definitely met all of my expectations.",1242604800,2,300,4.555555555555555
2609132,4,B000GG4Y6E,"Money well spent. Even though I already owned all three I bought this to reduce the number of DVD cases on my shelves. All three movies are exceptional thrillers. ""Kiss the Girls"" involves women being kidnapped and tortured or killed and the attempt to find them by Forensic Detective Alex Cross played by Morgan Freeman once the victim played by Ashley Judd escapes. ""Along Came a Spider"" is about a young school girl being kidnapped and the investigation by Morgan Freeman that as Retired detective/Author Dr. Alex Cross follows it. It is a pretty good story that will keep you guessing who is involved. ""Double Jeopardy"" is about a woman played by Ashley Judd accused of killing her husband and going to prison and after she is out she finds he is alive, so she plots her revenge. Tommy Lee Jones plays her parole officer. I highly recommend this set. Good Quality DVDs with one normal size DVD case. Plenty of replayability. If you enjoyed these catch ""Bone Collector"", ""Murder of Crows"", and ""Shoot to Kill"". - C. Luster",1218067200,11,1025,4.731843575418995

2609148,5,B000GG4Y6E,love the Alex Cross story lines Morgan Freeman fills the bill as the detective cross and Ashley Judd always plays a vulnerable but empowered woman due to the circumstances she's in to over come...need more movies with storylines that depict a strong female lead character...a positive role model fro younger women is so desperately needed on the big screen,1407196800,,356,5.0508474576271185
