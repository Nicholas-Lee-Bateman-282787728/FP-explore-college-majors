8029313,5,B0002MFFHE,"COAST TO COAST has fantastic dialog between a long-term married couple who have been through a lot. An in depth look at issues without all the angst and peppered with subtle humor and touching insights.  Richard Dreyfus and Judy Davis, how could the delivery of really good writing be any better.",1273276800,,296,4.803921568627451
8029314,3,B0002MFFHE,"Coast to Coast directed by Paul Mazursky is the kind of movie you would really like to feel good about.  The back drop of a TV comedy writer and his wife who put their house up for sale and take a trip across America in a 1960's era red T-Bird is the stuff dreams are made of, but in this case it is a rolling nightmare, you see Barnaby, played by Richard Dreyfus and Maxine, played by Judy Davis are on the brink of divorce.  Apparently Barnaby thinks that if they take this trip they can patch up their long gone love for each other.  And he is right, as it seems Maxine is talking a good game, but really doesn't want to go it alone.  You really want to like this film, made for the Showtime cable network, but the characters that Dreyfus and Davis have to interact with are just not likeable.  I see the point of the screenplay written by director Mazursky, but it is just too obvious that Barnaby and Maxine are better people than the ghosts that haunt them.  Add to this the screen writers love affair with the notorious ""F"" bomb and Coast to Coast just comes off as another Hollywood film that their creators love, but really has no appeal to the American public.  This is a shame because a good re-write of the script might have improved this otherwise unremarkable film.  This is just average Hollywood fare, seen through the eyes of Hollywood people who really have lost touch with day to day reality.  Take it or leave it.",1128902400,3,1433,4.337078651685394
