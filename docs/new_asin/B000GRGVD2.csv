8133942,5,B000GRGVD2,"This is by far one of the best instructional videos. Kajira is such a thorough instructor. I would say for a beginner it is the best instructional video I've had.

I know, I've said the same things about 'Belly Dance for Beautiful Freaks' and 'Belly Dance East Coast Tribal'. However, this one I would say is one step ahead. Although I think I've learned from every dancer something new, I believe Kajira is the best instructor of all three. I would love to see Kajira performance live too.

In my opinion, This DVD is worth every penny.  It is very well edited. I am loving my collection. LOL...",1163116800,11,596,4.5
