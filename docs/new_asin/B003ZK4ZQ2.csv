8410539,1,B003ZK4ZQ2,I served on Swift Boat 94 in Vietnam.  The was not one river raid or Seal in this movie.  Only offshore board and search on ocean,1365206400,,129,3.923076923076923
8410540,5,B003ZK4ZQ2,"This video is edited footage of personal movies taken by a Swift boat crewman in Vietnam.  It is not a 'movie' in the sense that the first reviewer probably expected.  Having seen other productions by the same person (John Carrico), I was expecting good editing that showed Swift boat ops, which is what this is.  It has some general footage of the boats running around in open water, good footage of weapons training, some interior footage of the boat, and it has a couple of board & search operations, ending with footage of the berthing barge and repair ship.  For a Gen X'er who is studying Vietnam riverine combat, this video give valuable perspective about the boats and ops.  I did not see any SEALs in the film, except what I thought was a STAB running in the distance at one point, but this does not diminish the value of the film to my studies.",1353801600,,854,4.483870967741935
8410541,1,B003ZK4ZQ2,Do not waste $1.99 to watch this clip. There is nothing exciting nor is there anything informative. It is a series of clips of Navy River boats in Vietnam. Nothing happens.,1346716800,,172,4.580645161290323
8410542,1,B003ZK4ZQ2,"This is a complete rip-off. Altho some of the footage is interesting, most shows little or no action-just boats going thru the water, sailors monkeying around with dual fifties, and some Seals briefly walking thru the jungle. It only lasts 20 minutes. For $5.95 it would have been a jipp.  For $14.95 it's outright theft.",1287792000,2,321,4.836363636363636
