7869732,4,630437948X,"Since 1983, fans of P.D. James have relished the sumptuous TV adaptations of  the mystery author's complex detective novels.  For the most part, the  books have  been shepherded to the small screen with great care, and the  casting of actor Roy Marden as Scotland Yard Commander Adam Dalgliesh has  been seen as nothing less than a masterstroke.  The one complaint that  could be leveled against the producers is the seemingly random order in  which the books have been filmed.  A Mind To Murder, James' second  Dalgliesh novel, was the eighth adaptation for television in 1996.  This  trend has played more than a little havoc with the chronology and character  development laid down on the printed page.  A Mind To Murder underwent more  changes from page to screen than any previous adaptation, but remains  gripping and thought-provoking taken on its own merits.
Once again, Roy  Marsden assumes the mantle of the poetry-writing, introspective Dalgliesh,  and his performance here is riveting and intense as usual.  This is no  ordinary investigation, as events in the story will affect him personally  on several levels. The  tense opening scene sees Dalgliesh lose a young  member of his team in a hostage crisis.  Three months later, he and his  team are dispatched to the remote Steen Clinic to invesigate a murder,  an  odd assignment considered they are the Metropolitan Police.  Dalgliesh will  learn the reason for this assignment, and stumble across some unnerving  secrets relating to the death of his colleague earlier in the tale -  secrets that lay submerged within the stated function of the clinic,  which  is to treat the addictions and depressions of the rich and the  powerful...
The members of  the large cast are all marvelous, and the  production values are extremely high.  As a James fan, I usually enjoy the  adaptations, and tend to balk at overt changes made from the printed page.  In this instance, though, my grumbles are minor thanks to the strength of  the performances and some neat little flourishes which add zest to the  proceedings.  Dark and fascinating.",967161600,52,2095,5.020527859237537
7869733,5,630437948X,"One interesting fact about this video, is that no writing credits are  given for the adaption of P D James book that this is based on. Viewers  should not expect this adaptation to be a faithful reproduction of the  original. Even the murderer is different! But I'm not going to tell the  prospective buyer who it is, so they will need to buy it and find out for  themselves. Having stated these facts, I still found this video an  excellent and enjoyable experience.  As expected, Roy Marsden again puts in  another solid performance and portrays Dalgliesh as no other actor can.  The supporting cast is top class, with Cal Macaninch giving a wonderful  performance of a highly disturbed young man. The murder victim, has no  friends and lots of enemies.  The Steen Clinic for the emotionally  disturbed, depressed, alcoholic clients, and its staff all have the  potential for a 'A Mind to Murder' and Dalgliesh is handed the unenviable  task of trying to find the culprit. The final scene has the potential to  submerge the viewers and leave them literally breathless. An excellent  production, full of intrigue, pathos, and of course the action packed,  unusual conclusion.",962755200,24,1176,4.913265306122449
