5771810,5,B00D3A6F7Q,"From The Head is one of those rare treasures of independent cinema. Although it takes place almost entirely in the confines of a strip club bathroom, every frame of this film is beautiful to watch. With masterful cinematography and a multitude of absorbing performances (some funny, some shocking, some downright impressive), Griffith ties everything together with a poetic, deliberate touch. The whole thing feels purely cinematic. Watch it - films like this are hard to come by.",1371513600,5,480,5.246753246753247
5771811,4,B00D3A6F7Q,"Intriguing and thought provoking movie that takes place almost solely in the bathroom of a strip club.  Geo Griffith does an excellent job as ""Shoes"" the bathroom attendant who is sympathizer, counselor, voice of reason, friend to all and policeman to male patrons and strippers at club.",1458086400,2,287,5.1063829787234045

5771816,5,B00D3A6F7Q,It was something different. Nothing that I was thinking it was going to be. But it was interesting. I liked it. Probably what I call a underrated movie. It's a whole different view from this guy's perspective in the movie.,1454198400,,222,4.575

5771820,5,B00D3A6F7Q,"Unique character study, with mostly cerebral plot. Don't be fooled by surface. This movie is about how one's personal narrative shapes, and is shaped by, social interactions. Main character played brilliantly by George Griffith, who also wrote & directed.",1453075200,,255,5.564102564102564
5771821,5,B00D3A6F7Q,"Only for those with a couple of brain cells to rub together. Very well done. Reminds me of ""12 Angry Men"" in a way. Definitely worth watching.",1449273600,,142,4.296296296296297

5771826,5,B00D3A6F7Q,"I stopped watching Indies for a while because sometimes they are such a hit or miss.  But this is definitely a Hit!  You have to go through such a unique experience in life to be able to create rich and intriguing content like this, something that is truly hard to find in this day in age of saturated elements in film making. The acting is superb by George Griffith, would like to see more of him in diverse roles.",1445472000,3,415,4.2405063291139244

5771828,4,B00D3A6F7Q,"This movie was an interesting take on what happens inside the men's restroom at a gentlemen's club.  I wasn't sure what to expect - but the move rang true to events that happen there.  It also manages to make you feel some empathy for the employees working in the club, and the patrons who frequent the club.  It was a very interesting movie; the kind that is not a blockbuster flick, but stands out as enjoyable due to the story - and not the actors and actresses.",1444176000,2,465,4.32183908045977
5771829,2,B00D3A6F7Q,"Nice screenplay, but amateur film. It was a pleasant surprise to see some seasoned actors making cameos, but that doesn't help the film seem to be richer than it is.",1444176000,,165,4.533333333333333

5771832,5,B00D3A6F7Q,"I wish that I didn't identify quite so strongly with the main character - but, the fact that I do tells me that is was well crafted and performed. All of these people seemed so familiar to me and I am not one to hang out in strip clubs..especially not in the men's room..but, the way Shoes studies, responds, calculates and regrets..all very human and too familiar. Made me uncomfortable...and that is always a good thing. Not boring. Really liked it. Everyone is great but I could feel Griffith. And - his hair is fantastic.(sorry, can't help it!)",1442793600,3,548,4.6020408163265305
5771833,5,B00D3A6F7Q,"An indie film at its best, completely shot in a strip club bathroom, brilliant, just brilliant!",1441929600,,95,5.0
5771834,4,B00D3A6F7Q,It was a different perspective on what goes on in Night clubs.  It was very real in the types of characters that you find in these types of places!!!,1381363200,,149,4.137931034482759
5771835,5,B00D3A6F7Q,"Truth be told, I am biased because I am one of the actors in this movie.  That being said, I'm so proud of this piece.  George Griffith worked magic by pulling off a beautiful piece on a very modest budget set in one tiny location --  a strip club bathroom.  He drew from his real life experiences to create a profound and thought-provoking story filled with sharp dialogue and wonderful episodic scenes. Not only does he star in the film, he directed the various actors of every shape and size in a way that -- as a viewer -- you are engaged from the beginning until the very end.  If you like smart films, you will not be disappointed here.  It's a fun ride.",1376697600,,660,4.282258064516129
5771836,5,B00D3A6F7Q,"From the Head is one of those films that deeply surprised me. It was incredible! I saw it at the Arena Screening Room, and was enamored with the cast, plot, and excellent acting that took place in this film. I highly recommend seeing From the Head, you absolutely will not be sorry you did! It's not every day that a great film is written about the life of a bathroom attendant at a strip club, but this certainly took that idea and turned it into a wonderful movie. Worth the money and the time for sure!",1374624000,,505,4.270833333333333
5771837,5,B00D3A6F7Q,"Amazing indie flick! This movie is not what you'd expect. Well worth the time and money - I watched this movie thoroughly enthralled by the characters. How many times do you get to see the inside workings of a strip club in NYC from the perspective of a bathroom attendent? Outstanding performance by the lead actor (George Griffith), would love to see more of his writing and films. Definite must see for those looking for a solid flick! Highly recommended!!",1374019200,2,459,4.75
5771838,5,B00D3A6F7Q,"Apparently, there is more than just sweaty pole rubbing and tongue lapping going on in a strip club.  Griffith's premier effort takes a crack at the deeper side of hardcore entertainment.  But a visit to the nether regions of a gentleman's club is not what you think.

The viewer is pulled into the personal lives and stories of the patrons as seen through the eyes of a restroom attendant.  The scintillating backdrop is simply a setting for an intensely cerebral journey.  This movie is all about the experience, not a plot or predictable ending.

""From the Head"" is a deeply contemplative film wrapped in a sensual and seductive skin.",1373932800,,637,4.798165137614679
5771839,5,B00D3A6F7Q,"Saw this debut in Tribeca last year. Fabulous characters. What Sherwood Anderson did for Winesburg, Ohio in the 1920s, Griffith has done for NYC of the 1990s...using a spare, unsentimental style to evoke the loneliness, longing and brotherhood that exists within the walls of the men's room of an underground club on Times Square. His approach is unflinching but compassionate and never cheap; this is a movie to watch with friends. There's a reason David Lynch calls From the Head beautifully written, acted, directed and filmed. If you are a fan of modern cinema this is one not to miss.",1373587200,3,589,4.9
5771840,5,B00D3A6F7Q,"'From the Head' is a breath of fresh air.  Original, artfully crafted, and entertaining - if you're a fan of thoughtful independent films you're in for a treat.

I can't say it any better than the world renowned film-maker/director David Lynch does:
""It is beautifully written.  Beautifully directed.  Beautifully acted.  Beautifully filmed.""",1372723200,5,342,5.5
8588899,4,B00D3A6F7Q,An interesting movie.  Probably based on true experience.,1516147200,,57,6.125
8588900,4,B00D3A6F7Q,"This was an interesting film to view as a female. The cast of characters as well as ""Shoes"" provide a real-time look into the minds and hearts of men who frequent strip clubs or are just passing through. This film is set in 1995 and it is very notable that much in the aforementioned has not changed. This is truly a thinking film, not just for you as a viewer but for the character Shoes as well.

Good film for a lazy day if you feel like checking something new out.

Rent only.",1511395200,2,480,4.150537634408602

8588907,5,B00D3A6F7Q,"Surprisingly great movie. Very good dialogue, managed to make a whole movie in a bathroom entertaining. Found it interesting that the main actor is the director and actually worked as a bathroom attendant in syrip clubs in NYC for years.",1470700800,,237,4.95
8588908,1,B00D3A6F7Q,Not interesting or as it appears it would. Mostly entire movie takes place in a mens bathroom.,1469491200,2,94,4.588235294117647
