8189531,1,B000P6XQ1E,"While I am a fan and I own a large collection of dvds in the gay and lezbian community and usually don't judge these two harshly.  This is an exception.  This is about a fat man, who thinks he is pretty trying to get a home after he has lost it.  Bad acting, I mean really bad, no plot, no attempt at acting.  I come from a small community with alot of ranches around.  There is a reason why most people where boots out there.  If you really want to watch this, please put them on, as you will need them.  Altogether horrible experience, don't waste you money or time.",1273276800,2,568,4.109090909090909
8189532,1,B000P6XQ1E,"It's unbelievable that even bothered to make this movie. The story line, video graphy, editing and acting all set a new low.",1258329600,,124,4.681818181818182
8189533,1,B000P6XQ1E,"I'm all for DIY film making -- unfortunately this falls way short. Poorly acted, poorly written. It's called a comedy -- but it's not at all funny. I didn't care about any of the characters except for wondering how long I would have to endure them. I can't recommend this film. Save your money.",1243468800,,294,4.462962962962963
8189534,1,B000P6XQ1E,The rental price was too much for this waste of time.  Unless you are desperate for something with gay content avoid this mess.,1213401600,,127,4.521739130434782
8189535,1,B000P6XQ1E,"I'm not sure why these people got together to make what is essentially a home movie, but you as a view have a duty to avoid this garbage at all costs. I wouldn't watch this for free on YouTube.

To the people who made it, a few tips: a home movie quality is passable because I know this had no budget. But... you could have been careful with the sloppy edits, wrote a a script that actually made an iota of sense, not purveyed what people were feeling/going to do through subtitles, etc, etc, etc. And above all, don't waste almost half the movie showing unnecessary stuff, like the friend rushing to London's side. If you can really call that rushing. He walks out of his apartment building, he walks to his car... sloppy edit... arrives at London's house, enters the front gate, walks up the driveway, knocks at the door, etc. Completely unnecessary and this is not the only example.

Most likely the worse movie I've ever seen. If you're going to rent it, do it for the unintentional laughs, because there are so, so many. Would have given a 0, but Amazon only goes as low as a 1.",1192838400,9,1083,4.383084577114428
8189536,5,B000P6XQ1E,"Meet London Hilton, drunken jet setter. This time he's had one too many and ends up married to London Latsis (Adam Cootes) after a drunken celebrity driven party at Club 69 in Berlin. Upon waking Hilton gets some good advice from the Marriott Brothers 'RUN Flee back to the US'. Hilton runs and Latsis is right behind him. Chaos and desperation ensue. Sometimes true love can't be denied.

Director's Note: If you are looking for a Raiders of the Lost Ark or an E.T., this movie is probably not for you. This is more like a very early John Water's Movie where a group of friends got together and made a crazy movie. If you like early John Waters movies (i.e. Mondo Trasho, Multiple Maniacs, Pink Flamingos and/or Female Trouble), I believe you'll enjoy One Crazy Night.
