4987867,5,B006GT3OOS,bender gets it right-the only wasted ammo is when you forget what he teaches you on this well execute dvd. the eye camera shot on each station/house leaves no doubt as to the lead needed,1372896000,,186,4.3428571428571425
4987868,5,B006GT3OOS,"A very well produced DVD.  Clear concise instructions and tips.  The ""eye cam' was amazing.  I shall be watching this over and over.  I'm sure that it's going to help me improve my shooting.",1370476800,2,190,4.5
4987869,5,B006GT3OOS,I attended one of Todd Bender's clinics and this is almost as good as the real thing.  An extra benefit is the eye cam and he shoots an entire 25 straight in about 1 minute at the end of the video. Fantastic.,1367798400,5,208,3.9523809523809526
4987870,5,B006GT3OOS,This is a great video.  I am making a point of watching it before I go out  to shot a round.......,1364515200,2,98,3.619047619047619

4987872,5,B006GT3OOS,"As a newbie to skeet I bought this DVD on the advice of a few people in my club.  What a valuable investment this DVD has been.  Within the first 10 days of owning this I have watched it about 5 times - gaining some new information each time.  Bender's lessons are comprehensive yet very easy to understand.
If you are new to the sport you can gain some very valuable basics and fundamentals.  After you gain some confidence and start breaking some more clays you can re-watch for some more in-depth lessons.
I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
This DVD is a great investment for any skeet shooter.",1360886400,6,602,4.445454545454545
4987873,5,B006GT3OOS,"This is an excellent video taking shooter through every station and providing easy to follow suggestions for hold points, leads and other critical fundamental concepts. This video had been recommended to me by a competition shooter when I visited a club in Australia. He suggested Todd Bender as the one shooter to study form and method to become more consistent. The video provides an excellent setting with repetitive shots at each station to see stance, form and follow through. It has certainly help me become more aware of following a set routine as I approach each station, focusing on stance, gun alignment/fit, hold points, lead and gun follow through.  Watching it over and over to improve, always catch some new point.",1347580800,11,728,5.016528925619835

very helpful",1420761600,,22,4.75
4987917,5,B006GT3OOS,"My wife and I are new to skeet so bought this video. It seemed a bit expensive but after watching it realized it was money very well spent. Not only is the training and video quality top notch it is presented with visual aids, eye cam, and slow motion reviews of shots that are absolutely excellent for teaching how to focus on targets and execute the shots.

Also, Sunrise Productions that produces this DVD is an excellent company to do business with. I was looking through their followup videos and accidentally sent a purchase order for another video. This was not noticed for a while and when we found and tried to cancel we were afraid it was too late. Customer service was excellent and stopped the order though processing had already began.

I'm sure we will eventually buy the other Todd Bender videos but need to focus on shooting and rewatching this tape at least a half dozen times before follow up purchases. There's so much to learn from this video I don't want to get distracted with additional info before absorbing the teachings of this one.",1419206400,,1058,4.622340425531915
4987918,5,B006GT3OOS,Really nice product.  Todd carefully explains his approach at a nice pace and with simple words and examples.  Following his teachings my results have improved at several stations.  As for the other stations . . .,1418428800,2,213,4.861111111111111

4987920,4,B006GT3OOS,"Great method, more than doubled my hit ratio from consistent 6 -7 hits to 14 -15.  Would help to have a system to keep gun moving after firing.",1392336000,,143,4.107142857142857
4987921,5,B006GT3OOS,"I found this CD very helpful. I found Todd covered all the details very through and the more I watch the more I learn , after all I am over 70yrs. And never shot skeet before . I have hunted all my life and that means most all game, but this is a whole new game which I am finding very enjoyable. I would recommend this CD to all starting to shoot skeet  and anyone just looking help.",1389744000,,384,3.923076923076923
4987922,5,B006GT3OOS,"While I haven't been able to use ""sustained lead"", I have learned a lot from this video that has helped me.  I have improved my scores and I'm very happy about that.  Great buy!",1379289600,,177,4.176470588235294
4987923,5,B006GT3OOS,"I would recommend this video for not only the novice who is just beginning to skeet shoot but also to someone who has some shooting experience. Todd  gives a wonderful illustration and gives a good sound foundation addressing stance, lead, eye hold points and gun hold points, which gives the student something to emulate when he or she is shooting. By following Todd you get a good foundation as a beginner. Eye Cam illustrations are very helpful as well and you get an idea of what the sight picture is supposed to look like. I watched the video about 10 times from time to time to address different stations I was having problems with and its a good tool and reference point to go back to.
Good Job Todd,
Pat",1375056000,3,711,4.469230769230769
8497854,5,B006GT3OOS,Great instruction!,1529366400,,18,8.5
8497855,5,B006GT3OOS,"Todd is the best. It is just that simple. 10+ years ago when I first walked onto the skeet field the best I did was a 9/25. That just wasn't going to do. I searched the internet and found this video and bought it on the spot. I watched it 2 times and went out to the range. I proceeded to shoot 19/25, 18/25. 20/25, and 23/25. That is one hell of improvement just from watching a video. Todds explains are clear, organized and easy to follow. He practices what he preaches and he has been world skeet champion many times, look him up.",1510876800,,534,4.144230769230769

8497860,5,B006GT3OOS,"As a Level III Instructor and the current Zone 7 Chief Instructor for the National Skeet Shooting Association, I highly recommend this DVD and Todd Bender's other DVD to anyone, advanced, novice or instructor who is serious about the game of skeet. This particular DVD will cut thousands of rounds of ""hit or miss"" shooting. One thing about skeet, there's always someone who will try to help you. Unfortunately they're usually, while well meaning - WRONG.",1467244800,,455,5.0
8497861,5,B006GT3OOS,Excellent instruction! Before watching this video I would miss 19-20 targets about of the 25 targets after watching this video I could hit 23-24 of them. The portion of the video that shows the leads on the varying stations in slow-motion is the most helpful part of the instruction. The instruction on form and mental preparation is also very good too.,1453507200,,353,4.80327868852459
