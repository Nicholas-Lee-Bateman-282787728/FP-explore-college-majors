8082313,5,B000B69TEQ,How can I buy a copy of this video? It is a very inspiring story about how to live life fully and continue to adjust our outlook. Told with beautiful photos - it's a story that will live on for years to come.,1350950400,,208,3.86046511627907
8082314,2,B000B69TEQ,"This video was shown to us the morning of graduation at the Federal Executive Institute in Charlottesville, VA.  It was a great book-end to some of the best executive training on the planet.

Through some of the best photography anywhere, Dewitt Jones brilliantly paints a message of optimism and abundance through a metaphor that translates well to everyday life.  There are always great photos to be found, you just have to believe they are there and go find them.  Sometimes you have to change your perspective, or look at the world with a different thought process, but there always seems to be a way to see a situation in a positive light.  To quote Mr. Jones, ""believe it and you will see it.""

That's the good news.  The bad news is that this video apparently has only been available used on Amazon.  I was lucky enough to pick up a used ""like new"" copy for around $8.  However, the only way to purchase a true new copy is through ""Stargazer Video"" for nearly $800.  Yes, that isn't a typo, almost eight hundred dollars.

If you find a used copy of this, enjoy.  Otherwise, you are unlikely to ever see this very inspirational video.  I have rated this video down to two stars because of the price.  I love the video and message, but you'd have to decide if the price is fair for a 22 minute video.",1301097600,6,1305,4.451476793248945

If people would see this and take into their lives the principles Dewitt Jones is teaching, this world would be a different place.  This is a must see.  I only wish the video was available for purchase.  Amazon does not have it available.  I am searching the web for one to purchase.  I'm even eager to be able to take the training.",1283990400,,391,4.078947368421052
8082316,5,B000B69TEQ,"I was introduced to this film in a workshop I attended. The message and the images are phenomenal. I have recommened the DVD to all my clients at TrueWealthCEO.com and ...it will change your perspective. Follow your vision and your dreams...""Believe it and you will see it!""",1151366400,3,274,4.851063829787234
8082317,5,B000B69TEQ,"WOW! I saw this DVD as part of an ongoing training program for my staff. We've been having some ""attitude"" issues lately and we are about to go through some major changes in the office. The employees were stunned by the images and the message conveyed in this DVD! Even viewing the staff from the back of the room, I could see their attitudes changing; their outlooks brightening. This is, by far, the best staff meeting I've ever had.",1130371200,5,435,4.518987341772152
8082318,5,B000B69TEQ,"Celebrate What's Right With the World is a remarkable, inspirational video (22 minutes) by Dewitt Jones, a life-long National Geographic photographer.  Jones starts the video by talking about the magic of the National Geographic magazine and how, as a boy, he was mesmerized by the pictures contained within the issues.  He went on to become a world-reknowned photographer, working for National Geographic.

By highlighting the beautiful images he has captured through his lens, Jones talks about the importance of viewing the world from a positive perspective (""I won't see it until I believe it... that's what life is about"" [as opposed to the more deficit-based perspective: ""I'll believe it when I see it.""]), being open to seeing the world through new eyes (""vision controls perception; our perception becomes our reality""), and by dedicating yourself to seeing the beauty in the world, actively looking for it.  Many of Jones' photographs became a reality because he took the time to look for the beauty that he knew to be there.

Celebrating What's Right With the World is a truly unique video that will help inspire viewers to see the world from a new perspective.  It is a wonderful video to encourate teachers, instructors, and anyone in the healing professions to pass the joy of the world onto the people with whom they come into contact.",1125619200,5,1350,5.031390134529148
