8219613,5,B000VRRCVC,"This film is absolutely amazing. A story of the longest race for an individual in any sport, but really a story of human drama. Circumnavigating the planet alone certainly takes a rare breed of sailor. This show captures the agony and ecstasy as each of these sailors attempt one of the biggest challenges of their lives. The sailors are from all over the world with a variety of reasons for sailing around the world alone. Watch as a sailor performs surgery on himself and as another is capsized deep in the southern ocean with little hope of survival. This documentary is incredibly compelling to watch.",1039651200,2,605,4.771428571428571
