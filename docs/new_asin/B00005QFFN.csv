7950470,5,B00005QFFN,"Playing the video of Rise took me back to my youth and the fantastic voice of Ms. Stevens, particularly her rendition of Habanera from ""Carmen.""  I am going to give myself a treat by playing the various segments  over time so as to get the most from the experience.  This is one video that I shall be returning to often when I need a ""lift.""  Any of you who did not have the pleasure of seeing and hearing this lovely lady ""live"" will at least have this vicarious thrill from a performer who ""lived"" her role and never seemed to just be performing.  Her rich voice gave life to whatever character she happened to be presenting and I can guarantee that once you have heard the voice and seen the subtle nuances that she brought to each role you will find that she has captured you heart mind and soul.  I guess that you know that this young lad, now an octogenarian, has never stopped being enraptured by the young lady he first saw those many years ago",1400803200,2,952,4.320224719101123
7950471,5,B00005QFFN,"Why did Rise Stevens rule the MET for so long?  Why was she considered the Carmen of her generation?  For those of us too young or living in the wrong place to have heard her live, this DVD is one of the few records of her voice, her acting and her abilitiy to captivate an audience.  The sound has a limited frequency range, the images are soft but except for one song toward the end, where the lighting over exposes her facial features, the DVD is fine.  It is, as noted by others, an historic recording, but it much better than nothing.  For those who want to hear more of this wonderful singer there is a CD of her Carmen remastered from 1953 with Jan Peerce as Don Jose",1299456000,11,674,4.1937984496124034

7950473,5,B00005QFFN,Only sorrow is that there is not more of her.  Absolutely lovely otherwise.  Make more available.,1227398400,,97,5.0
7950474,4,B00005QFFN,"Every moment of these historic Ris Stevens telecasts from ""The Voice of Firestone"" is a pleasure to hear.  Stevens' beautiful voice shines, caresses and seduces the listener.  True, this are not restored footage; however, when one overlooks this, a very lovely program is at hand to be savored.",1214006400,6,294,5.104166666666667
7950475,2,B00005QFFN,"Rise Stevens was a very good singer. The problem with this DVD (which is of TV broadcasts of the early 1950s) is that television at that time was rather crude by todays standards (both audio & video) and this DVD does not seem to be technically updated. Also, like many opera singers, she was much better in the arias than the songs. However, it is interesting to see the kind of programs available on comercial TV back then.",1208390400,2,425,4.461538461538462
7950476,5,B00005QFFN,All the time that is spent watching and listening to Rise Stevens is full of pleasure.,1156291200,2,86,4.4375
7950477,5,B00005QFFN,"I cannot review the quality of the DVD but Rise Stevens has a wonderful singing voice and was very popular in her day. Anyone seeing the movie ""Going My Way"" with Bing Crosby will remember her as the opera star who sang at the Metropolitan Opera House in NY and who Father O'Malley (Bing Crosby) turned for help to save the Church where he was assigned.",1139616000,3,353,4.363636363636363
