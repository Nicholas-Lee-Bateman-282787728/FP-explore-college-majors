I'm a law enforcement firearms instructor, and have introduced several of the drills and techniques Gabe Suarez outlines, into the training sessions I conduct. I feel they have been very successful, and the officers & agents I introduced to them were very receptive and appreciative. There's no magic or ""special tactics"" here, as any real fighter knows, ""advanced tactics"" are just the basics executed very well. But, new approaches and ideas keep your training from getting stale. I can't recommend this strongly enough.",1255824000,7,907,7.330275229357798
