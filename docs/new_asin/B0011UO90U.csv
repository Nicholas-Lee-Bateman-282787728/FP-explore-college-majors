Few shows have kept my interest - and surely not after they have been cancelled for five years!  It would be great to get these on DVD.",1252540800,15,256,4.12
3069368,5,B0011UO90U,"I've just started watching this show after recording it 2 years ago on TV
I am only halfway through but this is seriously one of the best series ever, right up there with Everwood.
Greg Berhati is just such a great writer.
You feel so much for the charecters
It's such a travesty that this show was cancelled after 1 season
I really hope it gets released on DVD soon.",1245024000,7,367,4.257142857142857
3069369,5,B0011UO90U,"I watched Jack and Bobby when it first aired and instantly fell in love with the whole concept of the show and was so heart broken when it was cancelled. This was by far one of the best shows out there and as usual anything intellectual, non-reality based or soaked in sex dosen't last.  I was so ecstatic when recently the WB started putting their shows on demand and online to view.  I started watching the episodes and fell in love with the story all over again.  The cast was superb and the storylines were so relatable that it really captured me.  If you have never seen it google or you tube it...simply the best.  I hope this comes out on DVD so I can own this wonderful show.",1231286400,7,683,4.263565891472868

3069371,5,B0011UO90U,"After 22 mesmerizing episodes of this brilliant example of Television at it's Finest. I am once again faced with the disturbing realization that just as in other excellent but potentially controversial shows like ""Jericho"", Politics and NOT ratings overrule FREEDOM OF THE MEDIA. Censorship in my opinion closed this fine series after just one season.",1227657600,5,351,5.4
3069372,5,B0011UO90U,This was one of the best series on TV.  I don't understand why it was cancelled.  Probably because it was literate.  The writing and acting were excellent.  I hope they put this out on DVD.,1205798400,21,189,4.314285714285714
3069373,5,B0011UO90U,"I own this from the T.V., but would LOVE a studio released DVD.  I am a huge Christine Lahti fan, but missed this jem of a show when it first aired.  It is so well written and acted that I can't believe it did not go for more than 1 season.  Talk about the best show most weren't watching.  I think that the title may have caused people not to watch.  The show has nothing to do with the Kennedy family.  It is however about a boy, and a family, who will one day occupy the White House.  Christine is fabulous as usual, and the young actors who play her sons are wonderful as well. PLEASE, PLEASE release this great show!

8242581,5,B0011UO90U,"Few people ever realize that movies, whether in a tv series or in a movie house have three fold mission. First, to entertain... second, to inform... and third, to inspire... Most of the time producers create entertaining films just to make quick bucks. Nevermind if it has a trashy story line or if its toilet humor so long as it makes money. Although sometimes, movies are made to inform us and educate us about our surroundings and about life. But they are never made to inspire the human spirit. Very seldom, a movie is made in such manner that it inspires us to be better persons or to become more than what we are. Jack and Bobby is one of these rare films. And it is a tragedy and almost a travesty to stop producing this gem of a story. I guess the produces and writters gave up on the idea of making one good legacy in their lifetime and feared more about a legacy of bad debts.",1335484800,,886,4.279761904761905
8242582,5,B0011UO90U,"I don't understand why this very popular and one of the best series ""Bobby & Jack"" was cancelled.  We may never know what happen to those kids who were in a very bad car accident afterward.  Please put this popular TV Show on DVD now and we are waiting for ir for little over ten years now.  This show is one of the best ever and there is no another TV shows like that ever since.",1334793600,,380,3.973684210526316
8242583,5,B0011UO90U,"""Jack and Bobby"" was the best series of the first half of the 2000s!  The plot lines were fascinating, the characters of both Jack and Bobby were extremely well written and acted; the sideline actors, Christine Lahti, Bradley Cooper, John Slattery were... well, they were Christine Lahti, Bradley Cooper, and John slattery!!  The two best series of the second half of the 2000s have been ""Modern Family"" and ""The Middle"".  I think Jack and Bobby almost plays as an alter ego to ""The Middle"".  Both feature wonderful adolescent characters as flesh and blood people.  ""The Middle"" works the comic terrain of this population, and ""Jack and Bobby"" worked the serious side.

""J&B"" was, simply put, wonderful.  The terrific, truncated complete first (and lamentably, only) season should be available on DVD yesterday!",1330560000,,811,5.145038167938932
8242584,5,B0011UO90U,"I watched this show when it first aired and I was really too young to completely understand it, but nonetheless me and my mother enjoyed watching it weekly and were very disappointed that it was canceled before it was ever allowed to find its viewership. Since then I've re-watched it through netflix and the WB website and being 21 now, I have an absolutely new appreciation for the show. It's absolutely brilliant and unlike any show I've ever seen before or after it.
  The political views expressed while sometimes seem biased are actually weighed out nicely. Grace(the mother) is outspoken on her ideas of religion and liberal ideology, but to balance it, her son turns out to be right leaning(and religious) as well as them doing a wonderful job in one episode of showing both sides of the religious debate.
  The dialogue is snappy, quick witted, and enjoyable no matter who's talking. The story lines are complex and engaging, and the cast is absolutely outstanding, especially Christine Lahti as the mother, who although seems radical, has a foundation and a relatability to her as the mother trying to do right by her two sons.
  why they haven't put this show on a complete DVD set, or even bluray for that matter, is completely lost to me, but if you ever have the opportunity to watch this series I strongly recommend it.",1308355200,,1334,4.753246753246753
8242585,4,B0011UO90U,"I agree with many of the reviewers. I happened upon Jack and Bobby on Netflix streaming and fell in love with the series. It's well-written, literate, and has a tinge of West Wing about it (directorial style I suppose). It's a shame it was cancelled after only one season. I imagine it's a bit of an art figuring out what the public really wants to watch, but it seems as if this series had quite a bit in it that could appeal to a wide swath of the public. Anyway, get the DVD or stream it from Amazon or Netflix; it's well worth it.",1299024000,,534,4.144230769230769
8242586,5,B0011UO90U,"This was just a GREAT series.  The writing!  The acting!  I too was heartbroken when it was canceled.  Even more so when I found out it wasn't going to be syndicated or available on DVD!  I see it one here and wonder if there's a chance... Those of you who don't know, you can watch all 22 of the episodes on the [...]",1278547200,6,318,3.984126984126984
8242587,5,B0011UO90U,This was a great show with a great cast and storyline. There are a lot of people  who loved this show but cannot watch it because of the fact that it was never properly released on DVD therefor I think it should be allowed a proper release so that fans like us can purchase the DVD.,1273449600,3,282,4.035714285714286
8242588,5,B0011UO90U,"Two previous reviewers, ""Katie"" and ""S.Wilson"" (no relation), said what I would say about this show. Great writing and acting and the usual ""it was for literates rather than mindless reality show viewers"". Hoping I get it on DVD someday.",1270944000,3,237,4.95
8242589,5,B0011UO90U,"This was one of the most well-written shows on TV in 2004. Brilliant direction and acting only added to its greatness. Too bad it was canceled way too soon. Would love to have this in my DVD collection with lots of extra features -- are there any unaired episodes?

Would love to hear the cast and crew talk about this now as a look back and really get the inside scoop on the cancellation.",1266364800,,390,4.27027027027027
8242590,5,B0011UO90U,"""Jack and Bobby"" a series that deserved more time for all of us who absolutely loved this show.  It would be such a hit to see it on DVD just to have it in my collection and to watch it again.  It's too bad the good shows get the axe and the ones that are worthless seem to hang around.  TV isn't even worth watching anymore ...too bad the tv stations make such poor choices.",1264377600,3,375,3.973333333333333
