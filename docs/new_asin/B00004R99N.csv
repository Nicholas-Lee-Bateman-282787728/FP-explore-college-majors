**SPOILERS**
I had never seen this movie before, and I was surprised at the number of near death scenes for a young boy. It was humorous with the animals and the villain, but I didn't think so with Cody- climbing up a dangerous cliff and without a harness nonetheless, falling off a cliff-and with  a close up of a face full of fear; a rifle in his face;  and practically drowning. This may sound silly,  but after becoming a mom, I'm a bit more protective and observant.

1341339,4,B00004R99N,"When the second golden age of Disney animation is discussed, people always talk about The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast near the beginning of that decade.  But there was a movie in between them - Disney's first animated sequel, The Rescuers Down Under.  Released in 1990, thirteen years after the first one, it isn't quite as good as the movies around it, but it is still worth watching.

Our story opens in the Australian outback as we meet Cody (voiced by Adam Ryen).  He is a friend to all the animals in the area, but on this day, he sets out to free a rare, giant golden eagle.  Once freed from a trap, the two become friends, and Cody even learns the location of the bird's nest.

But that night he falls into a trap set by McLeach (George C. Scott), a poacher in the area.  When McLeach realizes that Cody knows where the eagle can be found, he kidnaps the boy to try to get the information from him.

And so the call goes out to the Rescue Aid Society, who send their two best agents, Miss Bianca and Bernard (Eva Gabor and Bob Newhart).  When the two land, they meet up with Jake (Tristan Rogers) a kangaroo mouse who helps them in this foreign territory.  But will the mice find Cody and free him before McLeach finds the eagle?

The first thing you'll notice if you watch these two movies back to back is how different the animation style is.  Thirteen years makes a huge difference.  The background is deeper, and some of the shots in the opening are breathtaking.  They easily foreshadow the opening of The Lion King just a couple years down the road.  This film was near the beginning of the flirting with using computer even in hand drawn animation, and the results are beautiful.  You can especially see this in the fun flying sequence near the beginning.  This film also marks the first collaboration between Disney and Pixar since Pixar did much of the post production for the film.

The movie itself seems to have dual stories until the end.  We'll spend some time with Cody and the cast of animal characters he's met at McLeach's cabin, and then we'll watch Bernard, Miss Bianca, and Jake's journey to find them.  It's not until the final third that things really come together, but when they do it is great.

The characters here are pretty basic, the exception being Bernard and Miss Bianca.  We get to watch as Bernard spends most of the film trying to propose to Miss Bianca, only to be interrupted time and time again.  Meanwhile, Jake is flirting with her.  The way this pays off in the end is fun to watch.  Plus they resurrect Bernard's fear of flying to great comic effect.

Of course, all the voice cast does a great job bringing their characters to life.  There isn't a poor performance in the bunch.

While this film does use the melody of ""Rescue Aid Society"" at one point, none of the characters sing and there are no original songs in the film.  Frankly, I don't think the movie needs them.

Like the original, this film features a kid in pretty serious danger, but for some reason McLeach seems like the darker villain, and some of what he does and almost does to Cody is pretty dark for a kid's film.  I'm a little surprised this one is rated G.  Again, other Disney films are scarier, but this one certainly has it's moments.

My biggest complaint about the film is Wilber.  Voiced by John Candy, he is the albatross our heroes use to get to Australia.  Unlike his brother Orville in the first movie (get it?), he sticks around after they land.  Yes, he does wind up playing a part later in the film, but his scenes until then aren't funny at all, and he's supposed to be the comic relief.  I really wish they'd done something else with his character.

These complaints aside, The Rescuers Down Under is a worthy sequel.  With some beautiful animation and a good story, it's certainly worth watching.",1433635200,,3847,4.4805755395683455

1341344,5,B00004R99N,"Back in the '90s and '00s, Disney became infamous for churning out direct-to-video sequels to some of its classic films.  The quality of these sequels ranged from okay to terrible, but for the most part the general consensus seemed to be ""did the originals really NEED sequels?""  And while the sequels to the somewhat newer films (such as ""Brother Bear 2,"" ""Mulan 2,"" ""The Little Mermaid 2,"" ""The Return of Jafar,"" and ""The Lion King: Simba's Pride""), Disney's plans to sequel-ize many of its beloved classics (""Peter Pan,"" ""Bambi,"" ""Cinderella,"" ""Lady and the Tramp,"" ""101 Dalmations,"" and ""The Fox and the Hound,"" to name a few) caused a huge outcry from hardcore Disney fans and a general ""meh"" from Disney watchers in general.  Thankfully this trend soon petered out, and plans for sequels to ""The Aristocats"" and ""Dumbo"" were (perhaps thankfully) canned.  But a lot of people tend to forget that there is one non-Pixar sequel that DID make it to the big screen... and while it flopped in theaters, it's gained something of a cult following today.

Said film is ""The Rescuers Down Under,"" a sequel to the lesser-known Disney film ""The Rescuers,"" and I would argue that this film is better than its predecessor.  And it's a shame that it gets written off as ""yet another pointless sequel.""

""The Rescuers Down Under"" stars the same two heroes of the original -- Miss Bianca and Bernard, two mice who serve as operatives in the R.A.S., or Rescue Aid Society, who are dedicated to helping children in trouble all over the world.  Their latest mission -- travel to Australia and rescue Cody, an adventurous and animal-loving young boy who has been kidnapped by a diabolical poacher.  With the help of Wilbur, a clumsy and over-the-top albatross who replaces Orville from the last film, they make the journey, where they team up with the kangaroo mouse Jake, a friendly outback expert, to find and rescue Cody.  But Cody has a secret -- he knows the location of the nest of Marahute, a rare giant golden eagle, and the poacher McLeach will do anything to wring the information out of him.  Bernard and Bianca's mission becomes a quest to not only save Cody, but to save this magnificent bird and her eggs from McLeach's greed.

Whereas the animation in many Disney sequels is a step down from the original -- the films were often made cheaply before being dropped onto video or DVD -- the animation in this film is beautifully done, with exquisite scenery shots, smooth animation, and animals that look very close to their natural selves without being overly cartoonified.  There's some early examples of CGI in this film, but for the most part they're well-integrated and don't stick out like a sore thumb as is often the case with '90s CGI.  This film shows a gorgeous view of Australia and its wildlife, and I credit it with getting me fascinated with the country and its culture and wildlife.

The voice acting in this film is excellent as well.  Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor return as Bernard and Miss Bianca, and they have a fun chemistry between the two of them, as Bianca retains her elegance even in the outback and Bernard remains awkwardly adorable (though his obsession with superstition seems to be left out of this movie, which I think is a good call).  The late John Candy shines as the comic relief Wilber, who despite filling a similar role as Orville did in the original film still manages to make the role uniquely his own.  George C. Scott hams it up as McLeach, and is obviously having way too much fun with his lines.  And veteran voice actor Frank Welker fills in roles as Marahute and Joanna, McLeach's sadistic but clumsy lizard sidekick, and manages to convey a great deal of emotion without dialogue, relying on chirps, growls, hisses, and other animal noises to get the characters' ""speech"" across.  THAT takes talent to do well.

The story isn't anything groundbreaking -- like the first film, it's basically a rescue mission complicated by a subplot of finding/protecting a valuable treasure (though the treasure is a living creature instead of a gemstone in this film).  But whereas the first ""Rescuers"" film was fairly slow-paced and bogged down with too many supporting characters, ""Rescuers Down Under"" makes for an exciting and even epic adventure, keeping a brisk pace without feeling rushed and with plenty of action scenes.  There's an environmental message within the film if you look for it, but it doesn't feel uncomfortably wedged in as it often does in many '90s films (there were a LOT of films with a ""Save The Earth"" message in the late '80s and early '90s).  My biggest complaint is that the villain is such an over-the-top piece of work that at times it feels like he walked out of a ""Captain Planet"" episode, but he's such an enjoyable villain to watch and hate that said complaint is pretty minor.

It's a shame that the ""Rescuers"" films ended with this one (there's signs that they intended to make this an ongoing series).  ""The Rescuers Down Under"" is one of those rare sequels that manages to be better than its predecessors, and has the added advantage that it's possible to enjoy it without having seen the original.  It's beautifully animated and exciting to watch, with great voice work to boot.  Give it a chance before writing it off as ""another pointless cash-grab sequel.""",1425859200,,5330,4.776688453159041

1341353,4,B00004R99N,"Disney's reputation as a shameless shiller of sequels had noble origins, when at the height of the company's renaissance it produced an absolutely killer follow-up to one of its more modest classics,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rescuers/dp/B000096IAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rescuers</a>.  ""The Rescuers Down Under"" didn't make nearly as much money as the other films of its era, and this probably would have a lot to do with the company's future strategy of releasing most of its sequels straight-to-video, but that belies the fact that this is a superb animated adventure. Though it probably appeals more to a slightly older audience than Disney's tamest fare, its contemporary leanings and large scale mixes well with the company's masterful animation and makes for a gem in Disney's library.

The story: When a greedy poacher (George Scott,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Patton/dp/B000EHSVS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Patton</a>) kidnaps a young boy (Adam Ryen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stepfather-3/dp/6302499615/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stepfather 3</a>) to coax from him the location of a rare golden eagle, the returning Rescue Aid agents Bernard (Bob Newhart) and Bianca (Eva Gabor) travel to Australia to mount a rescue.

The reason the movie may not have done well financially is that it's so different from its predecessor. The original was moody and thoughtful, with several quiet conversations in the dark and a soft soundtrack that allowed the viewer time to reflect, whereas ""Down Under"" is bright and bombastic with a speedy pace, plenty of action scenes, and no pop soundtrack. This is hardly the kind of movie an adult would watch to relax, and I can only imagine how it led to kids bouncing off the walls in 1990. However, if this were simply a case of trading in the classic style for a populist cash-in, I'd have a lot less love for the film. It is in fact an earnest adventure movie, featuring plenty of adrenaline scenes but not compromising story development or character integrity. While the original is definitely superior in some regards - a more memorable villain, more time spent focusing on the heroes - the sequel stands soundly on two feet.

As expected, the animation is a joy. Disney's first-ever application of digital coloring techniques pays off, and it is highlighted via incredibly smooth character motion, detailed facial expressions, a wonderfully warm color palette, and maximization o the Australian country landscape. The surprisingly ample computer-generated imagery merges well with the hand-drawn portions, too.

The movie's also pretty nice to listen to, with the actors doing a swell job. Tristan Rogers (""General Hospital"") charismatically voices Jake the kangaroo mouse - easily everyone's favorite new character - and he has good chemistry with Eva Gabor, who had the sweetest voice in all of motion pictures. Their coupling takes away from the great rapport that Bob Newhart had with Gabor, but it's a minor disappointment. Oddly, the filmmakers chose American-accented performers to voice Cody and McLeach, the latter of whom doesn't make as much of an impression as he should but is still undeniably evil. Surprisingly, the most impressive character of the bunch has no lines at all: Marahute the eagle is unlike most Disney animals in that she's almost completely feral, with few anthropomorphized features, but is still able to make a very human connection.

Speaking of Marahute, the movie's best scene also represents the filmmakers' worst decision. The film's initial ten minutes are without a doubt its best: after opening with the drum-filled score, we're transported to the scene wherein Cody is taken flying by the eagle, and this is simply one of the best things ever animated. The simulation of flight is nothing short of breathtaking - better than any attempt that even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miyazaki/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miyazaki</a>&nbsp;has made - but it sets an emotional and adrenal standard that the rest of the picture just can't match. It certainly catches my attention from the start, but I think it would have been more effectively placed near the end.

Reportedly, producer Tom Schumacher was crushed when the movie failed to be a big success, and I don't blame him - it's clear that he and the rest of the crew put a ton of hard work into the film, and for audiences to turn it down at the time of its release is a shame. With that said, it's endured nicely and is still a blast to watch today; I hope that Schumacher reads some of the nice reviews it's received, here. The fact that this is one the few films that Disney has had the good taste not to follow up with additional installments is comforting, but even if the Mouse does still decide to do this, the company will have a hard time either improving on or depreciating one of my favorites. I recommend this one to all animation and nostalgia fans.",1418256000,,5115,5.483502538071066
1341354,3,B00004R99N,"The Rescuers Down Under failed to do well at the box-office in 1990.  This came as no surprise seeing as it was up against Home Alone, Rocky V, and Child's Play 2.  The Disney Studio all but abandoned it to the wiles of a fickle audience by dropping all of the TV advertising for this movie, allowing it to flounder hopelessly among better offerings.  Down Under proved to be the least successful animated feature made during the Disney renaissance era.

As for the story, it's less about the Rescue Aid Society and more about a plucky boy trying to protect a rare golden eagle from a malignant poacher bent on its destruction.  Bernard and Bianca end up playing a supporting role along side an Australian hopping mouse named Jake (voice by Tristan Rogers).  The villain, Percival C. McLeach (voice by George C. Scott) has a vicious sidekick goanna named Joanna.  The plot involves a child in jeopardy (lost in the middle of a slight ecological story concerning the preservation of endangered species).  Also forgotten in the midst of this concern is a room filled with caged animals that are presumably left to die in captivity, seeing as their tormentor is killed before the finale and no mention is ever made of them again.  No surprise, the little hero of this movie is raised by a single parent, continuing Disney's alarming predilection for murdering or losing one or both parents.  Nothing says family values like an orphan or a kid struggling unsupervised by a delinquent parent (as is the case here, where the mother is barely mentioned and rarely seen).  As with most Disney animation, the story leaves much to be desired while the movie is extremely pretty to look at.",1417651200,,1679,4.755172413793104

In any case, watching this as an adult reveals that it is painfully bad.  The characters are shallow tropes, every joke in the film has been done elsewhere, and the plot is a retread of the first.

Probably the most painful aspect of the movie is the villain.  Besides being a walking cliche, he takes every step necessary to ruin his own plans -- kidnap a boy to ensure people search his poaching areas, announce his villainy on a loudspeaker, and indicate very obviously when he's tricking the boy.  Only the fact that all the good guys are idiots/plot is convenient, so that the bad guy can be enough of an environmental message.

1341379,5,B00004R99N,"this sequel is a recipe for a disaster when you think about it:
sequel to a movie that was a bit forgettable, characters are not as memorable as in other Disney movies.
out of all 30 Disney sequels, this is the only tolerable one (excluding pixar movies).
animation: top notch, i don't think i have ever seen anything smoother.
plot: simple yet sufficient.
characters: they added a crocodile Dundee like guy (who is the only one with the correct accent).
 they replaced the slightly annoying girl with a stronger boy, that makes a difference as you can see he
can take care of himself(ish). the villain is very threatening and a bit realistic and not completely over
the top as in the prequel. the plot is similar in the way that the villain needs something from the child,
but i found that the second was better as there the villain needs the location of a bird that the child is
 fondly attached to, which gives a more threatening climax, as at the same time, the viewers don't know the
 limits of the two characters, and how far they will go to achieve. in the prequel, the girl has to get a
diamond and then she is basically free, (as one would notice near the end of the movie). in the sequel,
lets say it gets quite a bit more intense.

the main reason people don't like it is because it isn't true to the original. to be honest, i found the original
 a bit slow paced and in some areas it literally lacked some animation mainly that . flying scene. found the plot
in the original weaker in some ways, and has a few unnecessary details. i found the litte girl with her teddy very
irritating with all those cutesy moments. i did find the two songs relaxing but again, very forgettable.

in conclusion, the sequel is superior to the original in many ways.
This movie might be too intense for children under 5.
if they haven't seen it, then this is a must.

this movie would be interesting to see in 3d, as it would have quite a few moments when some depth could be interresting.",1367366400,,1982,4.384196185286103

1341388,5,B00004R99N,"Astonishing animation, vivid color, rich evocation of the Australian outback and its animals, humor, suspense, a stirring Bruce Broughton score, sympathetic heroes and a great scary villain--this undeservedly neglected movie is one of the best of the post-Walt era.  Cody (Adam Ryen), a young boy who lives with his widowed mother outside Mugwump Flats, is friends with all the animals, and when Marahuti, the Great Golden Eagle, is caught in a poacher's trap high on one of the red-rock monoliths of the area, they call on him to rescue her--having hands, ""you're the only one who can help her, little friend.""  He succeeds, and makes a majestic lifelong friend--but when he tumbles into a pit-trap set by the poacher, McLeach (for whom respected actor George C. Scott provides both voice and physical model), he finds himself in great peril.  Fortunately his capture has been witnessed by a bush mouse, and word flashes halfway across the globe to the U.N. headquarters of the Rescue Aid Society and its two leading lights, Miss Bianca (Eva Gabor) and Bernard (Bob Newhart), the latter now the official U.S. delegate to the Society.  Recruiting the albatross Wilbur (John Candy), and later the savvy kangaroo mouse Jake (Tristan Rogers), who serves as their bush guide, the pair set off to save him.  Meanwhile Cody and the other poached animals, including the comic frilled lizard Frank (Wayne Robson), are doing their best to escape McLeach's stronghold on their own.  Much of the charm of the movie lies in the way the production designers have imaged a mouse-sized civilization--the difficulties it would face in a human-scaled society, how it would use the artifacts cast off by the big people--and in the relationship between Bianca and Bernard (who has an engagement ring in his pocket, and when Jake and Bianca are inadvertantly captured, finds a rugged courage--""I've got to get somewhere in a hurry,"" he tells a razorback hog 10,000 times his size as he stares it down, ""and you're not gonna give me any trouble!"").  Even better than the original (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rescuers/dp/B008IG5UOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rescuers</a>), this is a Disney movie that should be in every family collection.",1354752000,,2268,5.3008356545961

1341406,5,B00004R99N,"Growing up, this was one of my absolute favorite films (and yes, this birthed my obsession with Australian accents, and the Australians who speak them).  You can place this right next to another underappreciated animated classic, `The Chipmunk Adventure', as one of those films I wore out watching so many times.  I've recently revisited this film (as I did with `The Chipmunk Adventure' a while back) and it has surprisingly held up.  In fact, it held up remarkably well.  Where `The Chipmunk Adventure' unveiled notable flaws (especially in the quality of the sound during those blurry musical numbers), I didn't find such flaws while watching `The Rescuers Down Under'.

I actually found myself getting rather giddy all over again.

As many have mentioned, this was one of those films that marked the return of Disney.  Disney made a severe dent in pop culture for the second time (second generational time) in 1989 with `The Little Mermaid', and then it blew the competition away in 1991 with `Beauty and the Beast' (still possible the greatest animated feature of all time), but in between those two juggernauts was this little seen and little remembered gem.  Yes, `The Rescuers Down Under', sequel to `The Rescuers' (the better known predecessor) needs to have a larger audience.  It deserves a larger audience.

It has so much going for it.

It opens with cinematic perfection and animated delightfulness (that opening sequence is to die for) and it continues with slick scripting, light yet meaningful comic relief, aptly paced tension and a beautiful message that adds depth to the film without beating us over the head with it (the message of environmental harmony is lightly coaxed, unlike recent catastrophes like `Avatar', which consider the audience too stupid to `understand' subtlety).  You can add to that a colorful repartee between the vocal talents (Bob Hope and Eva Gabor are just wonderful, and John Candy is classic!) and a devilishly evil villain in George C. Scott (he can do no wrong!).

I love these little rodents, and you should too, so grab this solid adventure film and dig in.  This is one of those `cartoons' that is perfectly constructed for youngins and oldins alike.

1341419,5,B00004R99N,"The Rescuers Down Under is one hour and sixteen minutes long was release in theaters one November 16, 1990. This was not a direct to video movie, but an actual movie. This was the second Disney movie not to be a musical; the first was The Black Cauldron. Granted in one scene Wilbur is dancing to the song Black Slacks playing on the radio. This was the first movie by Disney to use Computer Animation Production System and replacing drawing each scene by hand. It is thirteen years after the original was released, but it the movie it seems to take place only a few years later. The movie opens up with Cody (a young boy who looks no more then twelve) who has just rescued a giant golden eagle named Marahute. On the way back home he saves the life of a mouse caught in a trap. It is a trap within a trap. As soon as the mouse is freed Cody falls into a deep pit that sets off the alarm for a poacher named Percival C. McLeach and his pet goanna named Joanna. When McLeach arrives to see what the catch is he finds Cody in his trap. McLeach was originally going to let Cody go, but finds Cody with a golden eagle feather in his backpack. He realizes that there is a second giant golden eagle and demands that Cody takes him to it. Cody refuses to tell and McLeach takes him to his hideout. The mouse that is saved by Cody runs to get help and the message goes out to the main headquarters of the Rescue Aid Society in New York City. An emergency meeting is gathered and the Chairmouse calls upon Bernard and Bianca for the job. However, the two are not at the meeting but at a restaurant where Bernard, who is no longer a janitor but the United States representative of the Rescue Aid Society, is trying to proposed marriage to Bianca. This will be an on going gag throughout the movie. The two are summed back to headquarters where they take on the mission to rescue Cody. The two arrive at the hanger to find Orville has retired and his brother Wilbur has taken over the business. Wilbur now runs Albatross Airlines. At first Wilbur does not want to fly to Australia due to the snowstorm outside, but when he hears about the situation with Cody he changes his mind. The three arrive in Australia and are greeted by Jake, the Australia representative of the RAS. After meeting Jake, Wilbur injures his back and is taken to a hospital for treatment. Bernard, Bianca, and Jake head off to rescue Jake. Back at the hideout Cody meet some capture animals and try to set them free by getting the keys off the hook. Their attempts fail when Joanna comes in and smashes the device the captures created to get the keys. Later on Percival comes up with a plan to capture the giant golden eagle. He decides to set Cody free telling him somebody else has captured the eagle and that there is no one to care for her eggs. Cody believing this information, heads to Marahute's nest and is unaware that he is leading McLeach to the nest. At the nest Cody is met by the three rescuers at the nest. The three try to tell him that it is a trap but it is too late. Marahute is captured along with Cody, Bianca, and Jake. Bernard is left behind because he was unable to grab the rope quick enough. Joanna is lowered down on a rope to eat the three eggs but is unable to do the job so she throws the eggs off the cliff. It is later revealed that Bernard switches the eggs for rocks to protect the unborn baby eagles. Wilbur, who has recovered from his wounds, arrives at the nest. Bernard gets Wilbur to sit on the eggs to protect them and Bernard heads off to rescue the captured foursome. On his way there he gets a ride from a wild boar to get them to the group. He is able to get the keys so Bianca and Jake can free themselves. In the meantime McLeach is lowering Cody down to the river where a bunch of hungry crocodiles are waiting to eat him. When the crane gets stuck, McLeach takes out a shotgun to shoot the rope off. Bernard has Joanna chasing him and makes her run into McLeach and sending them both into the river. The rope holding Cody breaks and Cody falls into the river and Bernard dives into the water to rescue him. Just then Jake and Bianca unlock the cage and Marahute flies out along with Jake and Bianca. The three of them rescue Cody and Bernard. Percival C. McLeach is seen going over the waterfalls and it is assumed that is where he met his death. On top of Marahute, Bernard finally proposes to Bianca and she accepts. Meanwhile Wilbur is left to incubate the eggs until they hatch. Overall this was a very good movie and sequel and far better then most of the sequels that are direct to video. This was the second movie in the Disney Renaissance era and the only one not to gross one hundred million dollars or more world wide. The Rescuers Down Under gets an AAAAA+++++.

1341425,5,B00004R99N,"I just wrote a review for Fievel Goes West which was the 2nd in a series of three. Rescuers Down Under is the 2nd also. I don't know if they did a third. I can't imagine how the the first can be better than the second, because this is the first for me to experience, just like Fievel 2. I thought the seconds were fantastic.

Just like Fievel, you got Academy award winning actors. George C. Scott and his gravel voice as the animal poacher in the outback of Australia, and is too good. Scar in the Lion King comes to mind when I think of great voices like George C. Scott. I can't remember who the other actors are in the Rescuers. OK, I just IMDB'd it and no wonder it was great. Bob Newhart, John Candy, Eva Gabor(always great), Billy Barty?(kids don't even know him), and some other well known characters are the real meat of this well done animated flick.

This isn't Pixar magic, but you will like it just as well, and I have all of the Pixar eye candy movies. If you don't enjoy this, maybe you should be watching the Animatrix or something else less fun. Just like Fievel, the Rescuers has actors that us older folks KNOW really well, which enhances our enjoyment, but my daughter watched this a million times for the fun factor. I hate giving stars to movies, but I cannot personally rate it lower than 5*****. You can watch this over and over again, which is my litmus test for movie rating. If you can't watch this again, there's no 5 stars possibility.

The movie is a little dark, like 101 Dalmations. Evil characters doing bad stuff, which is NOT what you see on the cover of this movie case. WOW, happy kids flying on a bird's back, NOT! I personally cannot watch Bambi, Cinderella, or Snow White ever again, but you can watch this time and time again, well hopefully. I'm going to go buy it on DVD now, and toss out my tattered VHS copy. Enjoy!!",1221696000,,1861,4.326647564469914
1341426,5,B00004R99N,"A lot of reviews for ""The Rescuers Down Under"" seem to be focusing on the fact that it's a sequel; as a result, their reviews tend to be biased: either they are in favor of Disney sequels, or they detest the very idea of Disney sequels.

Please disregard these reviews.

Contrary to other reviewers' suggestions, ""The Rescuers Down Under"" was by no means intended for a straight-to-video release. In fact, the production value in this film is just as high if not even higher in some aspects than the Disney box office giants that followed it, such as ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin,"" etc. The film uses CGI subtly and is chock full of fantastic imagery--not even just of the Australian Outback--a wide variety of sound effects, and boasts Bruce Broughton's incredible score--which I would consider to be among the best Disney feature scores of all time.

""The Rescuers Down Under"" was the first Disney film in what might be referred to as the ""Disney Renaissance"" (1988-1999). Its uniform finish and faded shading on characters is the result of a new digital painting technique called the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS); this computerized production system was utilized for the last scene of ""The Little Mermaid"" (the previous Disney film) but was only first used 100% for the production of ""The Rescuers Down Under.""

The fact that the film wastes no time with musical numbers--a stereotypical Disney and animation element, as the only previous Disney Classic film to lack musical numbers was ""The Black Cauldron""--is a plus; the story drives itself and there is a definite synergy between the fantastic voice acting, the high-quality animation, and the breathtaking Australian scenery. Moreover, ""The Rescuers Down Under"" defies most stereotypical Disney standards, giving it a very mature and refined feel; there are ZERO cringe moments in the film, and none of the humor is overly childish.

If you have a child who is interested in flying (i.e.- riding in airplanes) and/or exploring the world (namely the Outback, which is one of the most fascinating locations on the planet and is well represented here), ""The Rescuers Down Under"" could easily become his/her favorite film. Throughout the film there is a sense of adventure and much of the ""camera work"" has utilized digital effects to create a fantastic sense of flying; the ""animated cinematography"" of the film is flawless, and the overall appearance is consistently pristine.

In conclusion, allow me to reiterate: what makes ""The Rescuers Down Under"" so phenomenal is the plain and simple fact that it defies expectations, namely what one would expect from Disney and particularly from a Disney sequel. This film is not even comparable to ""The Rescuers"" because they are completely different in style.

""The Rescuers Down Under"" followed on the heels of some above-standard programming from Disney, including ""Ducktales"" and the unique theatrical release ""Oliver & Company,"" and it was followed closely by ""Talespin,"" ""Darkwing Duck,"" and ""Goof Troop,"" all Saturday morning cartoon shows that were by no means dumbed down to pander to little children--who are by no means as lacking in intellect as previous and subsequent children's entertainment seem to anticipate.

BOTTOM LINE: ""The Rescuers Down Under"" is a sharp-looking and sharp-feeling film that is suitable for ALL ages, young and old. I consider myself to have especially refined taste when it comes to animated features, and I say this one ranks among THE BEST.

Most critics agree; the only reason ""The Rescuers Down Under"" flopped at the box office was because of competition (""Home Alone,"" apparently) and some aversion to sequels on the part of moviegoers...which incidentally prompted Disney to avoid theatrical release of sequels for over a decade after that. ""The Rescuers Down Under"" did have a successful video release, which would have led to a third film in 1996, had Eva Gabor not died before it could be made.",1203638400,,3961,5.1286821705426355

1341431,3,B00004R99N,"Released a full 13 years after the original, The Rescuers Down Under was the first Disney sequel, but was also considered a failure at the box office, which stopped Disney releasing later sequels theatrically. Hence, the reason why Disney now have a long line of straight-to-DVD sequels, which no one ever buys, and all end up in the bargain bin.

This is definitely my favourite out of the two Rescuers movies, mainly cos I was going through a fascination with Australian accents at the time - and why I later moved on to watching Home & Away and Neighbours - but it was so colourful, and bright. And the Australian accents. I remembered this more before seeing it than I did the original, even though it must have been the same amount of time (years) since I'd seen them.

It's a shame there were never more in the series, but because of the death of Eva Gabor (Miss Biana) in 1995, they were never made, and the two movies never became Disney classics.

Listen out also for the late and sorely missed John Candy, voicing Wilbur, the brother of Orville from the first one. He's hilarious as Wilbur.

Other reviewers have mentioned various flaws in the film (Cody's lack of Australian accent for example), but for me, I have to remain loyal. You can keep your Emperor's New Groove, Brother Bear, and the awful sequels to Cinderella & Little Mermaid (which are now two a piece by the way!), I'll have this over the rest of them any day.",1168732800,,1436,4.532818532818533

1341437,5,B00004R99N,"I grew up with this movie as a kid and I've always loved it. The DVD made me fall in love with it again. I hadn't seen it in years. It's just a beautiful movie with a great plot. When I was growing up, I watched both of the Rescuer movies, but I didn't understand the concept of a sequel. Down Under is definatley a better movie in my opinion, which is not very commonplace for a sequel. The music is beautiful, the story is fun and interesting. You don't get bored and disgusted because of sameness and vulgarity, like you do with 98% of kids movies today. I will definatley show this movie to my children.

This movie is intellegent and funny. Joanna and Frank crack me up so much even to this day. This movie gives a strong message that poaching is wrong and that all animals need to be treated with respect. That's a good message to kids.

The wombats in this movie look all cute and cuddly, but in reality they are big, smelly, and not cute at all. But I guess that's Disney for you! I love those cutseyed up wombats anyway. :)

I know it was only 16 years ago that this movie came out, but back then, kids movies were quality works that kids as well as adults could enjoy and cherish. Now, kids movies are just crap.

The only bad thing about this movie is that barely any of the characters except Jake the little guide mouse and some of the animals in captivity actually had Aussie accents. I didn't mind this at all growing up, but now it's bothersome to me, not to mention it isn't very authentic. I understand it's a children's movie and kids don't care, but if you're going to make a movie about a certain culture or region, do it right. Cody above all, should have at least had the correct accent.",1141171200,,1709,4.24923076923077
1341438,5,B00004R99N,"I have to say that I am so shocked at all the bad things I've seen written on amazon about this movie. Disney has made many, many sequals to it's classic animated movies, and this is the only one listed also as a classic. There is a reason for this. It is better than the origanal. I do like the ""rescuers"", don't get me wrong, it is a cute movie, but ""Down Under"" is just so much more exciting. The characters, the settings, the story. How can any disney fan not enjoy this?",1136419200,,475,4.118279569892473
1341439,1,B00004R99N,"Originally meant as a direct-to-video release, this sequel to The Rescuers (1977) barely has anything more to give than sharp, standard animation when compared to other sequel releases like Atlantis II - Milo's Return (Probably the worst sequel ever, since the original hadn't much to give either) but other than this The Rescuers 2 is nothing than yet another attempt (First attempt) to cash into the success of the original, which was one of the most successful Disney films in time of original release.

Story-wise, this movie left me flat, after putting two and two together I realized that it was nothing more than a rehash of the original.  Imagine, two mice from the Rescue Aid Society fly on albatross to a faraway land to rescue a child who's been kidnapped and has sent a plea for help.  It seems that the villain and his minions need the little boy to help him retrieve a valuable treasure.  As you can see, the storyline is anything but original, that's why I was shocked when I read that the makers of this had thought the original had a weak story, but compared to this one, it had way more lust and charm.

The movie has too much of a modern setting to be memorable and the characters are uninteresting, especially the two main characters Bernard and Miss Bianca, who not only look old and awful but are boring and minor characters.  The boy they are rescuing is rather bland and has almost no personality.  Characters like the caged animals are only added for a longer running time (And don't even get rescued in the end!), happenings are sometimes ridiculously exagerated and the ending feels rushed and incomplete.

The original The Rescuers was a hands-down favorite, so I decided to give its sequel a chance, however for reasons I've stated above, I disliked it and don't feel like recommending it.  Watch the original or other early Disney animated classic instead. 1/5.",1128729600,,1891,4.740853658536586

I found out that her wingspan is 20 feet and she is 5 feet tall. Cody only got a tail feather from the bird. He could have got a 4 foot long wing feather from her. There could be birds like Marahute today. People have seen encountered giant birds. One was the size of Marahute. People believe that these giant birds could be prehistoric birds (with wingspan 12 to 25 feet), unusually large modern birds, or unknown species of birds Marahute is that kind of giant bird.",1127606400,,606,4.324561403508772
1341441,2,B00004R99N,"After having seen The Rescuers in theaters twice (One alone and then once with my kids), I decided to then go see the sequel when it was released in 1990, however, seeing the poster for it, I sort of hesitated, it seemed too much like an action movie and less of a heartwarming tale.  I can safely say I was very disappointed with it, true, sequels are seldom as good as the first, but still, it was hard for me to consider this a sequel since the plot outline is really the same as the original, with different characters and different settings.  No songs, boring, repeated music, less-than-interesting character and a very annoying protagonist boy.

The story is that a boy has been kidnapped by Percival McLeach who needs the boy in order to retrieve the great golden eagle Marahute, familiar?  Yes, just like in the original, villain needs small, sweet person in order to retrieve a valuable thing.  My biggest problem was the characters, so uninteresting, even Bernard and Miss Bianca were among the most boring characters in the film, not to mention that their original voices were too old to fit the same roles, so I could never believe that those were the same mice I had loved years prior to this movie.  Story telling is as poor as the worst Disney has ever made, it even makes the story of Oliver & Company look good, too many lose ends, un-needed characters and ridiculous sequences, like the one in which a bunch of mice are operating the 'new' albatross Wilbur.

All in all, there are no memorable sequences, no pretty songs and no real classic scenes.  It was the first Disney animated sequel and that's all there is to it.  (Rent cheap before buying)",1126310400,,1666,4.601351351351352
1341442,1,B00004R99N,"I'm sorry.  But The Rescuers Down Under can hardly be called a sequel and even less a Disney ""classic.""  While the original is one of my personal favorites (One that deserves to be on top), the sequel was simply disappointing, it didn't have that air that the first one had.  Characters looked weird and those few that were from the original, looked even more weird since they looked nothing like in the first.

There are no songs, (Obviously Disney didn't learn a lesson with 1985's The Black Cauldron) which makes the movie bland and lacking appeal, the voices were alright but with many flaws.  For instance, Bob and Eva's voices sounded too old to fit the same characters, although Miss Bianca's new look made her look like a rich old lady, sort of reminded me of Madame Bonfamille from The Aristocats.  The mice act like humans and use everything like humans, so that part of appeal of the original was not put to use here.  The storyline is simply a remake of the original and there are many other (too many) flaws to describe, so I'll make it short and say that I do not recommend this.  Disney hasn't been able to pull a single good sequel unless Pixar was involved, what a shame.

1341445,2,B00004R99N,"""The Rescuers Down Under"" is supposedly a sequel to its' original.  However, the dictionary defines a ""sequel"" to be a ""work whose narrative continues that of a preexisting work.""  In other words, a sequel is supposed to extend and continue a storyline... however, ""The Rescuers Down Under"" fails to continue a storyline, rather it recreates the storyline in the original into a twisted case of dj vu.  Basically, if you've seen the original, you've already seen the less pleasing ""sequel.""

 This time around a young blonde boy, by the name of Cody, replaces our charming Penny from the original.  Cody is sent out by his animal friends to rescue a trapped golden eagle.  Unfortunately, the villainess poacher who captured the golden eagle in the first place out of greed, doesn't take too kindly to this rescuing and locks Cody up to keep him out of the way.

 The Rescue Aid Society is sent out to rescue Cody, and we see a triumphant return of the same pairing of voices for Bernard and Miss Bianca (Newhart and Gabor).  Since these two characters were in the original, we already know their personalities, lucky thing, because the sequel takes no time to portray any of the character's personalities.  Other characters in the film are introduced with no personality, who serve only one purpose -- to make the film happen (although we would have been happier if it hadn't happened in the first place).

Bernard and Bianca are promising characters (since they came from the original) but unfortunately are overwhelmed by the less-pleasing qualities of the movie.  Including weak characters, a repeated storyline, an unoriginal villain who has no personality to define him by other than ""the bad guy.""  Everything about this movie is just an ailing repeat of what has happened in the original, even their mode of transportation, an albatross named ""Wilbur"" is a repeat.

 The film parallels their efforts to find and free Cody, who is held captive throughout the film while the villain, McLeach, attempts to intimidate the boy to tell him the whereabouts of the insanely large eagle's nest.  Which, as viewers of the original can see, is a complete repeat from the original.  In both films the villains held the children captive because they needed the children to help themselves quench their greed.

 Cody never gives McLeach what he wants, his death is faked so that the rangers won't come looking for him, and we watch the unoriginal story take place against beautiful scenery until the end where we find a literal cliff-hanger, and Cody is reunited with his mother.  It would have been nice, though, if the film had actually shown us Cody and his mother being reunited - she thinks he's dead, after all.  And the captive animals who were also in McLeach's lair, we find, were introduced only to be forgotten.

Overall, there are some beautiful sequences, Australia (where the film takes place), looks very appealing and the characters are all dressed in cleaned-up animation.  But the film itself is unoriginal with only a one or two breath-taking scenes.

Ironically, it seems that the fans of the original dislike the sequel while those who disliked the original enjoyed the sequel.  I never quite understood this since the sequel is merely an ailing repeat of the original, maybe some people find unoriginal films to be appealing...",1115596800,,3342,4.923214285714286
1341446,2,B00004R99N,"""The Rescuers Down Under"" is the sequel to the 1977 hit film, 'The Rescuers,' a personal favorite, but it doesn't have the originality, charm and simplicity of the first one.  Most viewers will be fooled by the dazzling animation and pay more attention to that rather than the content of the film.  This sequel seems out of place, rushed and not very interesting, once you see it, you'll hardly want to revisit it.

Very few new things happen here, once again, Bernard and Miss Bianca, voiced once again by Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor take off to save a young boy from an evil kidnapper.  Like I said, nothing original, many gags from the first film are repeated here, for example the two rescuers fly on an albatross once again (Apparently a lost brother of Orville named Wilbur, voiced by John Candy).  There are many new characters, however, most of these were rushed and never develop any real personality.  The new boy, Cody is a bland character, not half as sweet and adorable as the little orphan girl, Penny in The Rescuers, other main characters for example Joanna, the lizard-like animal is probably the funniest and most entertaining character in the film (Which is pretty sad), however her design and mouse-hungry intentions seem too similar to the ferocious aligators Brutus and Nero (Also from The Rescuers) and the rather uninteresting villain seems like a spin-off of not Madame Medusa (Funny enough, like another reviewer pointed out) but of Amos Slade, the villain in the 1981 classic, The Fox and the Hound.  Other small characters, like a group of captured animals seem to have been added to literally ""make a scene"" which is all they do as they serve no real purpose, shameful compared to the brilliant use of minor characters in the final battle in the first film.

As I said, this movie feels incomplete, there are no songs, no soft bittersweet moments, no charm, no originality which is pretty pathetic, since sequels should at least show some form of originality.  The ending feels rushed, we never get to see the expression of Cody's mom in his return (We never get to see her at all!), we never see a final meeting of the Rescue Aid Society and we never see the wild animals I mentioned before getting rescued, no, everything is tied up and ""Let's all go home!""

The film itself can be pretty entertaining, it isn't necessarily bad but you probably won't be finding yourself wanting to go back to it, maybe you'll rewatch a few of the ""breathtaking"" scenes but nothing more.  Everyone's got their different opinions, perhaps you might read my review, watch the film and love it and that's why I am not going to say that you shouldn't give the film a try, In personally have the film in my collection, it will be there, but I feel no real desire to re-watch it, although I'm sure I will soon.

If I may make a recommendation, don't buy either one of the DVD releases for this two films, this and the 1977 film, The Rescuers.  Their current DVD releases are poor, one has horrifying picture quality and the other lacks content, not worth your money.  Hopefully the Disney marketing department will give us a better release, at least of the first film.",1113782400,,3174,4.664874551971326
1341447,5,B00004R99N,"The first Rescuers was released way back in 1977. Disney had this idea to bring it back for Disney's first sequel. They brought back Bob Newhart(who sounds slightly different) and Eva Gabor(I love listening to this woman's voice) to reprise their roles as Bernard and Bianca and it's still quite good.

Pretty much like another reviewer said it's kind of a rehash of the original but using different events. Cody, a kind of animal liberator let's say, rescues animals in traps that would otherwise end up at the hands-and then down the barrel of a shotgun-of poachers. He finds a massive rare golden eagle and quickly befriends it(and just FYI: turn your brain off slightly, the bird apparently understands English). Mcleach, a poacher finds the boy and a golden feather so he kidnaps Cody in hopes of finding Cody's eagle.

In come Bernard and Bianca, mice part of the Rescue Aid Society. The former of which is actually trying to propose but always gets interrupted.  They meet up with Wilbur, the cousin of Orville from the original and fly to Australia and meet Jake, a kind of tough mice in a way. Which sets up a love triangle between the 3 mice over Bianca.

First, 2 things stood out for me: the score. It's a really great score and especially love the opening theme. The ""Mcleach"" theme is nice but it sounds like everytime Mcleach arrives with his massive truck, the score repeats itself, kind of like how the Imperial Theme always showed up whenever Darth Vader was around.

Second is the animation. You can see the transition Disney would make into more detailed and complex animation that they would do in the Lion King or the Deep Canvas system from Tarzan and Hercules's Hydra fight.  Personally my favorite is either entering Australia with the Opera House or Orville's dive in-between New York buildings.

Too bad Disney couldn't replicate this type of film cause the rest of the sequels were just god awful. They even made 2 Aladdin sequels, nevermind one. But this was the first one and oddly enough, it's the only good one despite advancing technologies. Go figure.",1109548800,,2085,4.775

The Little Mermaid (both of them), The Lion King 2 (that's right, I said the sequel!), The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules, Cinderella, and the two Rescuer movies are the ones that come to mind. Now, the first Rescuer film is a hands-down favorite, but I love the sequel even more. Why? Because it has something the first one didn't--Jake the daring kangaroo rat. He has a crush on Bianca, and this upsets Bernard, whose trying to gather the courage to ask Bianca to marry him! So, the two boys end up glaring at each other and competing for the girl's attention, and she apparently doesn't notice the animosity. But it's just so cute!

1341456,5,B00004R99N,"Disney's 29th animated feature ""The Rescuers Down Under"" is the follow up to Disney's 23rd animated feature ""The Rescuers"". It was also the first official sequel to a Disney animated feature. And we're not talking about a straight to video sequel here, we're talking about a full blown effort designed for the big screen from Walt Disney Pictures.
What you have essentially is a Masterpiece that did not receive the recognition it deserved. This may partly be due to the fact that it was not a musical unlike ""The Little Mermaid"" that came just before it. It also originally opened opposite the most successful box office comedy smash ""Home Alone"", so it had a bit of a tough break. In addition, when we look back at the renaissance of animation in the late 1980s and 1990s we think of ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty & The Beast"", ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"", sometimes forgetting the wonder that came between mermaid and beauty, and that was ""The Rescuers Down Under"".
Here we continue the adventures of the two little mice Bernard (voiced by Bob Newhart) and Bianca (voiced by Eva Gabor) from ""The Rescuers"". This time they are off to save a boy called Cody who has been kidnapped by a poacher named McLeach in Australia. Of course to get there, they require the help of their albatross friend Orville from ""The Rescuers"". Unfortunately, he's out of town. This time around we have fellow family member Wilbur (voiced by the hilarious late great John Candy) flying them there. Or at least they travel part of the way on Wilbur. See the thing is, it's a bit of a long flight for an albatross from the USA to Australia, and so they make connections with a bigger bird (aka an aeroplane). Meanwhile in Australia Cody is trying to escape McLeach with the help of his animal friends. McLeach has kept hold of Cody because Cody knows where a big golden eagle's eggs are, and McLeach wants them. Cody though is friends with the golden eagle (they both helped each other out early on in the movie) and so refuses. Bernard and Bianca essentially come to the rescue.
The animation is beautiful, especially the backgrounds of the outback, and the music is extremely exhilirating. Great animation and music, combined with great characters, humor and storytelling, add up to this very exciting adventure.
The movie on this DVD is in the aspect ratio that it was originally presented in. There are some extras such as a theatrical trailer, but nothing to write home about. However the quality of picture on the DVD version is vastly superior to the VHS version.

1341457,5,B00004R99N,"I doubt it. Why you ask? The makers at Walt Disney tend to have viloence in thier animated movies. The Rescuers Down Under was out 13 years after the orignal movie. The movie stars in Australia with a boy named Cody (Adam Ryen) who hears word of a bird that has been caught by a poacher named McLeach (George C. Scott), Cody recures the bird and takes him to a ride to her nest, where 3 eggs about to hatch. Cody doesn't know that McLeach had only ready killed the bird's father and now is after the mommy bird. After Cody's visit he saves a mouse from a trap and Cody winds up in the trap. And is saved by McLeach and when Cody refuses to tell McLeach where the nest with the eggs are, he kidnaps Cody and word is spent out of the kidnapping of Cody. But the rangers believe that Cody was killed by a crodoile because his back pack was foud by a crodicle's swamp. The word keeps getting spread until New York, where a meeting is called to order and Bernard (Bob Newhart) and Miss Bianca (Eva Garbor) is picked for the case. Miss Bianca finds out about the case, but the problem is Bernard doesn't know about case, I guess that he thinks Miss Bianca has found out that Bernard is planning to propuse to her. Miss Bianca doesn't know that Bernard doesn't know about hte case, and without any talk about the case Miss Bianca accpets the assignment.",1044489600,,1346,4.2823529411764705
1341458,4,B00004R99N,"Though not as well known as other recent Disney features, this animated sequel (the first in Disney history) has much to recommend it -- excellent computer-aided animation, unusually fluid camera movement, a clever script, and a rousing musical score by Bruce Broughton.
Sadly, it doesn't have memorable or engaging characters.  The large cast of Australian animals never gets enough screen time to make an impression.  But to be fair, the two stars of the original _Rescuers_, Bernard and Bianca, fare no better; they don't even appear until twenty minutes into the film, and then have only a few scenes together.  The voice talents of Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor, whose easygoing chemistry and comic aplomb made the first film a pleasant romp, are utterly wasted here.
Still, this sequel was never meant to be character-driven.  In this respect and many others, it's a departure from what audiences have come to expect from a Disney cartoon.  There are no songs, not much dancing, and surprisingly little comic relief.  Instead, this cartoon is a straightforward, unpretentious action-adventure, guaranteed to satisfy a family audience.",1016841600,,1136,5.248618784530387

 Disney's 1990 sequel to the 1977 original, does offer the viewer a great Action/Adventure flick, with some great and exciting scenes. However, mixed in are a little too many scenes that make my mind start wandering off and forget for a minute that Im watching a movie.
The subplot, in which Bernard wants to ask Bianca to marry him, but never has the chance, is amusing to watch. Especially with the addition of a possible rival, Jake. Wilbur, the albatross provides that comic relief, and does it well.

The other one is Pocahontas, but the Rescuers was much better than Pocahontas (except technically). Anyway, this sequel is one of the best animated films of all time! The first one was a good movie, but the poor quality of the backgrounds and character designs, the drab colors and all of that other art stuff made it difficult to watch for me, and I never got that special copy with the naked lady in the window.

1341466,5,B00004R99N,"You hear a lot about this film being Disney's first sequal, but don't let that freak you out if you've never seen the original Rescuers film.  There's really no need to have seen The Rescuers to appreciate The Rescuers Down Under.  The only thing these films share are the two main characters (Binard and Bianca) and the plot point of saving a child in jeopardy.  Where the original was a touchy-feely story of abandonment, this film tackles the very different issue of wildlife preservation.  I find this to be a far better film than The Rescuers (although I loved it as a child and still hold a special place for it in my heart), and a welcome change of pace form the usual Disney fare.
This was the first film to use Disney's new CAPS system of filming animation and the results are truly stunning.  Bright vivid colors, blending and shading, sharp crisp lines, and subtle use of computer animation are the hallmarks of the ""new"" Disney and it all began with this film.  The opening sequence is a great example of what the system can do and remains one of the most thrilling openings to any Disney film.  More breathtaking scenes, like the flights with Marahute, futher attest to the technological achievement of the film.
Story wise this film gives us Disney's most realistic depiction of childhood to date (B.A.  before Andy from Toy Story, but he's really a PIXAR creation anyway), in the protagonist Cody.  He's strong willed, bright, has a sense of adventure and never seems overly cute.  He's just a boy who wants to save his friend, the last golden eagle Marahute, from the evil poacher.  Some very fun and comic characters are introduced (notably Frank the lizzard) to offset one of the meanist villans ever, Percival McLeach.  He's drawn in a realistic way that exaggerates his features just enough to give him a very menacing look.  Believe me, when he yells at Cody you will recoil in fear!
With all this high praise you might be wondering why this isn't a more widely known film.  Well it had the unfortunate distinction of following The Little Mermaid, which sent the studio in the direction of Broadway-styled musicals.  I haven't mentioned music for the film because there isn't any.  Althought the score is fantastic (and a hotly sought after collectors item), there isn't one song in the entire film.  Simply put, it got lost under all the hoopla about Disney's new style.  People were looking for more of the same from Disney and soon they would get it.
Rating the DVD itself, I'd give it a 5 for picture and sound, but only a 3 for bonus material.  Disney has released a few DVD's with outstanding bonus', however this isn't one of them.  All you get is a trivia game that will be really easy to win after you see the film and a mode that tells you the story in words or has a voice over read it to you.  But don't let the meager bonus material stop you from getting this DVD.  Now that time has passed and most of us are looking for something new from Disney, take a look at this overlooked gem.

7920634,5,B00004R99N,"Just introduced my nearly 4YO to this film on a ""stay inside Saturday.""  It was one of my favourites as a child and appears to be one of hers also.  When I told her there was another one, she was excited to watch it as well.  Any film that keeps her sitting in one place is amazing, and this did that job!  Ordered SD because, well, there's not much point to HD with these old films.  Still looked good!",1506902400,,403,4.050632911392405
