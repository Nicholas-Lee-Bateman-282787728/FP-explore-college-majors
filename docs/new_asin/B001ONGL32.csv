3730884,3,B001ONGL32,"I love Jazzercise and this is a decent workout, however if one chooses the shorter workouts, they're just edited from the longer one. Disappointing! I like my old Tae Bo and new Zumba better...",1314316800,5,193,4.705882352941177
3730885,1,B001ONGL32,This is so boring! I find myself jumping around because I can't figure out the moves! And they get old with in the first 3 times doing them. Don't wasted your money!,1313884800,2,165,4.1875
3730886,3,B001ONGL32,"I ordered this dvd to use on my off days of Jazzercise.  It's a good workout, but the music suffers and honestly the instructor is very hard to tolerate.  The one with short curly hair was fine, but the other one continued to breath on her mic and when she wasn't doing that, she was singing along with what little bit of words were in the music.  It's almost like not enjoying where you take the class-I'm having a real hard time making myself do the dvd because I don't enjoy it.",1306800000,22,481,4.206521739130435
3730887,2,B001ONGL32,"Was not happy with the DVD. The instructor should give you time to learn what step you must do before launching into a very quick movement, then change to another just as quickly. There needs to be a portion of the tape that is instruction. Don't particularly care for the instructor, either. Very disappointed.",1296518400,7,311,4.777777777777778
3730888,2,B001ONGL32,"I've had an old Jazzercise VCR for about 20 years, but it was going bad on me. I bought this, thinking I would come into the 21st century and update my Jazzercise experience. I found the music monotonous and I can't get past the tedious beat. Nothing is wrong with the exercises, except that I prefer a workout with floor exercise included. I'd like to tell Judi that until she produces a DVD with ""real"" music, I'll go back to my old VCR and use it till it busts. Give me some Abba, Beatles, and Three Dog Night songs and I'll be right back. It's not that I can't keep up with the exercises. It's just that the fun part is missing.",1293667200,8,632,4.188524590163935
3730889,3,B001ONGL32,"I checked this out from my local library and tried the 20 min. cardio workout.  If you are obese and heavy busted this is probably not the workout for you.  They do skips & jumps & hops and it was very uncomfortable.  I could only handle the beginning stretching & walking steps.  After that, I just pretended like it was a Leslie Sansone video and finished walking in place to the music.",1291334400,8,388,4.347222222222222
3730890,3,B001ONGL32,"Still an awesome workout, but does not do the Jazzercise name justice.  I used to attend Jazzercise classes 3 times a week and LOVED going because of the great music and massive variety of routines.  Unfortunately, this video doesn't have either.  The music is your typical, generic work out variety and there is only one set of routines on the video, so it gets boring really fast.  Like I said, still a good workout, but just a bit disappointing.",1282521600,20,448,4.632911392405063
3730891,5,B001ONGL32,"This is a great DVD! It's not as good as LIVE classes, but it's a close second. There's several different workouts, so I'm not sick of doing the same one over and over. I would suggest this to anyone who hates boring workouts!",1267488000,35,226,4.27906976744186
3730892,1,B001ONGL32,I think this DVD is a bit overpriced.  Other websites have it for $17.00.,1239235200,20,73,4.214285714285714
3730912,5,B001ONGL32,Great DVD for cardio as well as the use of hand weights. Good for all ages as I am 72 and love it. Would like to get another similar one.,1433980800,,137,3.6
3730913,1,B001ONGL32,"I LOVE Jazzercise, but this DVD came damaged. I could never use it.",1428537600,,67,4.230769230769231
3730914,5,B001ONGL32,Great exercise tape,1426809600,,19,5.666666666666667
3730915,3,B001ONGL32,"I am a long time Jazzercizer, so I guess I expected more.  The entire Jazzercize DVD consist of one full class.  Not crazy about the music, but it is okay.  It will do in a pinch.",1418601600,,179,3.9166666666666665
3730916,4,B001ONGL32,This product met all my expectations. Delivery was as expected. I would buy from this seller again.,1416096000,,99,4.882352941176471
3730917,4,B001ONGL32,Almost as good as going to class.  It's a shame that they can't use better music.,1413676800,,81,4.0625
3730918,4,B001ONGL32,"This DVD has all the components of a worthwhile hour. Warm-up, cardio, strength training and cool-down. Good instructions. It makes you feel as if you are right there in the class with all the rest of the group. Has high intensity and low impact too.",1402358400,,250,4.5777777777777775
3730919,5,B001ONGL32,I started going to Jazzercise back in the 80's. Hard to find classes now. Love jazzercise. This DVD arrived on time and in perfect condition.,1399161600,,141,4.68
3730920,5,B001ONGL32,I miss my Jazzercise classes back home as many were offered as compared to Sarasota. So glad to have found this!!!,1392336000,,114,4.476190476190476
3730921,2,B001ONGL32,"the main instructor is so annoying, that I dread doing the workout.  Her voice is grating, and she continues to talk (and sing???) throughout the entire video.  Music isn't any good either.",1390780800,,189,4.875
3730932,5,B001ONGL32,"I have Jazzercized with Judi Shepard for 35 years.
Why would I buy anything else? I have nothing more to add.",1390262400,,109,4.238095238095238
3730933,1,B001ONGL32,"Terrible audio quality
Music is awful
Routines are fine, but totally lacking the energy from the live classes with better music. Same for the entire series",1386028800,,155,5.0
3730934,4,B001ONGL32,"I like this exercise DVD. It's the one in my collection I use most frequently. I've taken live Jazzercise classes for years, but cannot afford it right now. This DVD is an acceptable alternative, but it is not as fun or effective as going in person, I admit... there is a lot gained from being in a group of people who are all sweating and working hard along with you. That said... the hour workout is a quality workout for cardio and strength training. The 20 and 30-minute routines are cut from the hour long routine, but that doesn't bother me at all: they are still effective express workout options. Good for beginners/the injured/seniors (as there is a low impact dancer at all times that you can follow) and also good for Jazzercise regulars who just can't make it to class.",1383523200,2,781,4.546099290780142
3730935,5,B001ONGL32,I like the moves and music on this dvd. I use the 20 and 30 minute workouts for now until I'm pain free from leg problems. Great workout for Jazzercise fans.,1379462400,,157,4.096774193548387
3730936,5,B001ONGL32,"This dvd is exactly what I expected, wanted, and needed. It's something my daughter and I enjoy doing together to keep healthy.",1373328000,,127,4.818181818181818
3730937,5,B001ONGL32,"I quit my regular Jazzercise class over the summer since we are traveling a lot, and have been using this DVD instead.  Once you get used to part of the routines NOT being in time with the music, it's good.  If you can't go to the real classes (which are great) then definitely, this is a good second choice.  It's a good workout!",1372723200,,330,4.2063492063492065
3730938,5,B001ONGL32,"This is my very first Jazzrecise DVD and I absolutely love it!!! I saw it while I was doing a search, and it was for a great price. Recently I decided that I needed to add something else to my workout routine since it was getting a bit boring for me. Jazzercise Live is perfect! The segments really get your heart pumping, and there is a low impact option. All of the workouts on this DVD are easy to follow, low impact on the joints (knees) and the music keeps things flowing smoothly and makes it even more fun. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a fun workout routine.",1367020800,2,589,4.221238938053097
3730939,5,B001ONGL32,Highly recommend this video if you exercise at home.  Lots of choices as to time and intensity.  It is exactly what I was looking for plus more.,1366848000,,144,4.296296296296297
3730940,4,B001ONGL32,"I bought this based on other positive reviews and am happy that I did. It is a good home workout and lacks the annoying drill sergeant personalities some other workout videos feature. My husband still likes to make fun of it, as it is cheesy. But if you want a want a good workout without joining a gym, this is the way to go.",1364860800,,326,4.109375
3730941,5,B001ONGL32,I love this dvd and use it daily. It works just as well as the live classes which I don't have time to get too!,1362700800,,111,3.48
3730942,3,B001ONGL32,i am a senior ans based my selection on classes i attended years ago.  much toooooooo strenous for me now.,1361491200,,106,4.3
3730943,4,B001ONGL32,"I ordered this dvd so I could do workouts at home when I couldn't get to a class.  Its ok, but the music at the classes is much better",1356393600,,134,3.6206896551724137
3730944,2,B001ONGL32,"Well now I know why I was told I won't find a Jazzercise video that even comes close to a class!  No one I have talked to (over 10 people now) can stomach the founder - if she would get over herself and let someone else do the videos she would make a much bigger fortune.  She is awful.

We all want to Hear the music, want to see the dance step. Somewhere in the process explain what they are doing, if it is a difficult move or they need to explain which muscles you are exercising and where you should feel it.",1349222400,3,513,3.9611650485436893
3730945,4,B001ONGL32,"I love the ease of use of this product. Quick and out the door! Reason for the 4 star rating, it doesn't live up to the ""lasts up to 10 days"". It lasted up to 7 days and that's good. I still recommend this product, as it does live up to the ease of use and no dry time. Quick, easy and fun designs!",1343779200,,298,3.671875
3730946,5,B001ONGL32,"What a great workout! Upbeat, encouraging, and effective, with options for low impact, shorter workouts, interval training -- whatever you need to change things up and keep it interesting. I've lost weight and gained tone. I'm very happy with this program.",1332720000,4,256,5.2682926829268295
3730947,5,B001ONGL32,"I say it's mine because I thought it was going to be too energetic for me and it was NOT.
I am in my 60's and I think this DVD is GREAT. I, of course, follow the low impact, but the entire routine is great and I am swetting my _____ off. I need to lose about 60 pounds and I  now think I can do it. The reason I had to quite my Jazzercise Class was my work schedule. New hours knocked me out of the class and boy was I upset.
Try the DVD. Young or old, in shape or out of shape, you'll love it and you will FEEL the difference within a week.
Go For It!!!!!",1329523200,3,556,3.6333333333333333
3730948,5,B001ONGL32,It is like being in a live class which I enjoyed for many years in San Diego. It gives a great workout with choices of time which works with my schedule. You will not be disappointed if you have Jazzercised before.,1328400000,,214,4.2439024390243905
3730949,1,B001ONGL32,"For women that did the Jazzercise program before, this is probably a great disc. For someone who just wanted to try it - it was bad. 80's moves, hair, music... The main instructor was IRRITATING and awkward. The forum was ""live"" so it was hard to hear, and many of the camera shots were of the whole room of women exercising, instead of specific shots of the instructors. Her daughter takes over a lot and is a little less annoying, but still annoying.
Sure you could get a workout using it regularly, but it got on my nerves after the first time. Never put it back on again. To a local charity it immediately went.",1328227200,5,615,4.356521739130435
3730950,2,B001ONGL32,I took Jazzercise classes and they were fun. I have about 30 exercise dvd's and this one was only played once.,1323216000,3,110,4.285714285714286
3730951,3,B001ONGL32,"Ok, not great, has a lot of sections --mostly the daugther is the teacher, and while she is good ---she will never be great. The older tapes (that can you can get as DVD) are better and you will get great excrise benefit.",1315526400,,221,4.162790697674419
8330939,5,B001ONGL32,This is a great disc for a good verity of workouts.  You can do longer or shorter workouts depending on how much time you have.  You work up a sweat and get your heart rate up.  The camera angles are great for showing the steps to follow.  Just as good as attending a class!,1522368000,,274,4.018518518518518
8330940,1,B001ONGL32,Didn't like it. The video was boring to me others may like it.,1513555200,,62,3.8461538461538463
8330941,5,B001ONGL32,I did look at the DVD and I found it very helpful and informative.,1492387200,,66,3.7857142857142856
8330942,5,B001ONGL32,"Love Jazzercise classes! Bought this when I was unable to attend for a long stretch and it's the next best thing. East to follow, just can't hear the music very well. Otherwise, it's a great workout!",1484524800,,199,4.555555555555555
8330943,5,B001ONGL32,Love love Jazzerize live !! Takes me back to when I did Jazzerize years ago and when I got to do a 90 min. Class with Judi Sheppard missett  at Cesar Tahoe.,1480636800,,156,3.875
8330944,5,B001ONGL32,"This is a very good exercise DVD. The routines are well done and the instructors are good. I especially like the low impact option who is always visible. I go to the local jazzercise  studio 5 times a week and I wanted to be able to continue my workouts while on vacation, since I often travel to locations where none is available. I will admit that it is not as much fun as a live class, but  good nonetheless.",1480550400,,411,4.189873417721519
8330945,5,B001ONGL32,I wish they would come out w another pne like this-more like the 90's in person jazzercise classes.,1470096000,,99,4.555555555555555
8330946,4,B001ONGL32,My daughter enjoyed this as a gift.,1454889600,,35,4.142857142857143
8330947,5,B001ONGL32,"Better than Zumba Gold!  I am over 50 and fairly active and was looking for something fun to alternate between using the treadmill, and toning dvds - this is perfect!  Jazzercise combines the right amount of cardio, abs, and toning so if you do it correctly, you will feel it!  Lively music, and energy throughout this video makes the workout go by so fast... Wish there were more Jazzercise Live videos available...",1450396800,,416,4.75
8330948,5,B001ONGL32,All her workouts are fun because it is more like dancing than exercising. Not too strenuous but decent.,1443571200,,103,4.777777777777778
