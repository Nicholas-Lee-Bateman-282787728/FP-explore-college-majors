3690777,5,B001LR9Q4C,"I have been playing the conga over a year and I had seen that members of [...] on various forums highly recommend Michael Spiro's products.  I have not been disappointed with my purchase.  Spiro reviews the tones and provides excellent exercises to master those tones.  He has his own take and he brings certain details for playing the tones that caught my attention as someone who had already learned how to play the various tones.  He gives encouragement and instruction of how to play in a way that is safe for the hands and ligaments.  He encourages regular and lengthy practice.  He reviews several rhythms:  Bembe, Rumba Guaguanco (Matanzas variation), and a number of salsa variations.  Along the way you pick up concepts in clave and a bell pattern.  The DVD provids just under 2 hours of instruction. I highly recommend it!",1262995200,24,832,4.802816901408451
3690778,3,B001LR9Q4C,Mine came with an audio CD only I was disappointed. I felt the DVD would help learn the techniques quickly.,1260403200,2,107,4.4
3690779,5,B001LR9Q4C,A crucial video for a visual learner like me. I've attended his workshops and I have his book/cd combo. This rounds out my learning material. I wish I'd had this DVD 20 years ago.,1239148800,10,179,4.294117647058823
3690780,5,B001LR9Q4C,Very explanatory and useful. You have lo see and listen to if you want to start the proper parth to conga drumming,1407369600,,114,4.2272727272727275
3690781,5,B001LR9Q4C,I am a conga novice. Mike Spiro keeps it simple. Easy to follow video instructions. Different angle so you can see proper hand position. Glad I bought it.,1405641600,,154,4.535714285714286
3690782,5,B001LR9Q4C,"Mike's instructional video is well done and offers any Conga player a good overview of style, form, and practice instruction for the serious enthusiast.

I got a set of Melnl marathon congas for Xmas so this is the way to go for starters.

One note about a Amazon drum set order I made. They shipped me one drum at a time and couldn't get the order correct so I had to order from another online supplier. I paid more than the Amazon listed set price but after three tries with them I gave up.  I have prime so they paid a lot of money to ship and return multiple orders.

This is an exception to their good service as I've been a commited patron for several years.",1399420800,,664,4.2047244094488185
3690783,5,B001LR9Q4C,"I've watched it from start to finish a couple of times and I've I've watched individual chapters on their own, several times. This gentleman knows what he is talking about and has a knack of being able to communicate it without wandering off on a tangent.
I feel as though my playing has moved up a couple of notches already.",1398211200,3,325,4.433333333333334
3690784,5,B001LR9Q4C,"I'm not a musician, but I bought this as a gift for the hubby who does hand percussion and he loved it.  He says the techniques are shown well and explained so that he knows why he is being told to do things a certain way.  It is the best video instruction for hand drums he has seen.",1393113600,,284,3.8793103448275863
3690785,5,B001LR9Q4C,"There are a lot of these out there; people/videos that want to teach you how to play congas (or something). Tomas Cruz's stuff is okay but hard to follow. He doesn't explain the strokes very well and for an Anglo English speaker like me, he's very difficult to understand. And, as others have stated, you get 1 camera angle so when he's (Tomas) is playing with his right hand its tough to tell what stroke he's using. Now to Michael Spiro. He impresses me as someone who really wants to teach; LIKES to teach and does everything he can to make sure you get it right. And the exercises are actually fun! Imagine That! The strokes are abundantly clear, his technique is clean and concise, and he doesn't sugar coat it. You want to learn? you need to practice. I set aside 90 minutes a day and I can see that time frame increasing as my playing becomes more demanding. He also emphasizes left hand technique. You want to do this right, develop the left (or weak) hand or forget about it. He advises practicing twice as long leading with the left hand as with the right, and it ain't easy. There are no short cuts. You want to play the congas? put in the time. And if playing fast is your bent, prepare to spend hundreds of hours in practice or you'll just be a fast, bad, player. If you're serious about playing this ultra cool instrument, Michael is your guy. He also has an advanced book/DVD on the market but give yourself some serious time with this one before you even think about it.",1330646400,17,1486,4.38768115942029
3690786,4,B001LR9Q4C,"Great product, good for the basics on learning how to play the congas would recommend to other. The lesson on the 2/3,3/2 clave was very helpful.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Introduction-To-The-Conga-Drum/dp/B001LR9Q4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Introduction To The Conga Drum</a>&nbsp;Thanks.",1323475200,3,334,9.151515151515152
3690787,5,B001LR9Q4C,"I have only started to use this, but what I've learned so far has been very informative.  You learn how to do the basic strokes without hurting yourself.  Having tried to learn on my own and banging up my thumb, I can testify as to how important this is.  I'm looking forward to incorporating his other exercises and improving my technique.",1302480000,,340,4.540983606557377
3690788,5,B001LR9Q4C,Arrived on time.  Great video for learning the basics of conga playing. I'm very visual and I'd much rather watch someone explaining a technique than read a description.,1300838400,,169,5.035714285714286
3690789,5,B001LR9Q4C,"The first two segments alone (describing how to play the open and slap/seco tones, respectively) were worth the price of the DVD, and provided me with a broader and more educational introduction to playing those two conga tones than two years of paid lessons. The instructor provides excellent instruction and insight into shoulder position, elbow angles, wrist and hand placement, wrist movement, back posture, thumb placement (especially the problem of smashing it against the conga rim). Early on, Spiro reveals that many of his live gigs can last up to 4 hours at a time. Having played that length of time (with, as it turned out, poor technique), I have a much better understanding of the reasons for my fatigue and how good technique enhances sound and endurance simultaneously.

Spiro's approach is a nice combination of geometry -- demonstrating proper angles for your hand, elbow, and body -- technique, and muscular conditioning. What I found particularly important was the cumulative approach Spiro takes to help incorporate these core principles into a worthwhile and fundamentally sound, comprehensive practice regimen.

I have purchased -- but not yet fully viewed -- other instructional videos, so I cannot compare this video to some of the others at this time. But for beginning conga players -- players who are brand new to the drum; or players who (like me) who started playing, but did not receive the proper instruction and guidance at the outset -- this DVD is invaluable. Highly recommended.",1271548800,20,1513,5.146341463414634
8319535,5,B001LR9Q4C,I felt very comfortable following Mr. Spiro's instructional  guidance and personal tips. Not every one can teach or convey their thoughts to inspire  their studentsite. Mr. Spiro is an excellent teacher.,1488758400,,203,5.516129032258065

8319539,5,B001LR9Q4C,"All you need to know, Spiro will tell you.  He will save you from hurting your self and teach you to play the Congas instead of beating. You will just need to practice, practice, practice, then practice some more.",1448236800,,213,4.461538461538462

8319541,5,B001LR9Q4C,This DVD was hands on!! He was very specific on teaching every single step. Mike spiro took his time and actually teaches you how to play the conga drums. My 3 year old son was able to follow his instruction and was simple and easy. This DVD was excellent.,1429660800,,256,4.244897959183674
8319542,3,B001LR9Q4C,"I thought this video was OK.  There's some good stuff in there.  But...I stress....this is not for a beginner.  You have to have some background in music.  Mainly you have to know what a quarter note, half note, eighth note...etc.  Also, it helps if you know how to tune your conga.  Mr. Spiro doesn't really cover this.  I have yet to find an instructor that goes over tuning as a beginner.",1425254400,,391,4.422535211267606
