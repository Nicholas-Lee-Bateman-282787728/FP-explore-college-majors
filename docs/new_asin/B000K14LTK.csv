2712972,5,B000K14LTK,"This is one of my favorite Jet Li films. It was full of action and the storyline is great! Totally worth watching again and again.

Item arrived when expected and there were no scratches (it was just as the seller described) so no complaints here!",1411084800,,247,4.488888888888889
2712973,5,B000K14LTK,"There are so many things about this movie that really distinguish it from your average English language, Asian superstar flick. Firstly the film was written and produced by Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita, The Professional, The Transporter etc) which immediately gave it a distinct quality.

Tch&eacute;ky Karyo plays an incredible and despicable, corrupt Parisian Police inspector and villain who you will hate the entire movie. On the other side is reasonably mild mannered ""Johnny Boy"" played by Jet Li, a highly trained and decorated Chinese officer who won't waste any time putting you down. The acupuncture needles Li uses added a very unique element to the film. Finally Bridget Fonda, who delivered a great performance, rounds out the primary cast playing a forced prostitute held in captivity by the vile inspector.

The excellent cinematography seemed to further accentuate the dark and violent quality of the movie. There are some really exciting fight scenes, particularly towards the end with the blonde twins and lastly of course, with the kiss of the dragon.
This is an action filled movie with a serious tone, a good story, strong acting and great aesthetics. If you like any of those things, I highly recommend watching Kiss of the Dragon.",1400544000,2,1252,5.132352941176471

2712975,5,B000K14LTK,"Luc Besson, the director, producer, probably mostly the writer is the best thing which's happened to Chinese
movies. The action is non-stop, the plot and production action/fight scenes, acting, scripting, etc's, all superb. It's also a surprising, unique crime/action movie. Simply said, a great flick. One of Jet Li's best, too, and he's done some great movies. This one's so impressive because of the international aspects.",1377216000,,425,5.454545454545454
