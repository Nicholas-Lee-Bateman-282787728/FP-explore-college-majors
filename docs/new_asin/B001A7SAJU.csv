This fast-paced, comprehensive program utilizes a dialogue format highlighted with testimonials from entry-level workers and their supervisors to emphasize the need for developing adaptive skills and positive attitudes.

Students are shown that school and work environments contain many similarities such as authority figures and specific rules and regulations.  Major differences such as having others depend on your performance are also discussed. Work habits, including punctuality, attendance, initiative, and personal relations with co-workers, supervisors, and the public are shown to be vital ingredients for job success.

The last segment deals with the importance of adjusting to particular work situations encountered and how those adjustments are directly related to job performance.  With the job market so competitive, students need all the help they can get in establishing themselves as valuable assets in the work place.",1211587200,,955,6.051851851851852
