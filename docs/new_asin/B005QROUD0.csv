It is rare now days to see movies with great story.  I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes crime fiction.  Also most of the movie is shot in the Los Angeles area which makes it cool.

4859917,5,B005QROUD0,"DELIVERED delivers the goods sum it all up.

This gem is a real heartfelt Indie crime thriller that did not let the modest budget get in the way of a great story. You can tell this movie was well planned and perfectly executed.

Michael Madison flawless direction takes you from one scene of the tightly written screenplay by Brandon Manbeck seamlessly to the next scene pulling crisp and dead on performances by an amazing cast. There were some scenes that made you think twice but they were well planted for a purpose to be revealed later.

I found this movie to be as enjoyable as many of my favorite films growing up and I have no problem recommending it to anyone.

Shane (Michael Madison) is a wounded veteran comes home to find his parent's home has been foreclosed and his widowed mother (Alana Stewart) close to being evicted.

Modest and unassuming with the endearing charm of a lost puppy Shane learns and grows quickly. Starts off wearing his father's hand me downs for job interviews and you can see and feel this character growing and gaining confidence as the story progresses.
Promising to get his mother's home back he reluctantly takes a job as an armed courier for a shady private delivery service. Everything is going great until one delivery does not go as planned and there are some dire consequences.

We understand Shane's coolness as he does not go to pieces when thing go awry but one can't help feeling that under that calm exterior is a Jack Nicholson or Joe Pesci ready to explode any minute.

Shane's mother portrayed by Alana Stewart was reminiscent of Melissa Leo's Oscar winning role in THE FIGHTER. This tough, determined, and proud widow will not let the misfortunes life threw at her keep her down. She did her best to keep her son from knowing what she was going through.  She went to work as a janitor keeping her head high by wearing her uniform with dignity and her make-up impeccable.

Jeanette Steiner is charming and surprisingly multi-dimensional as Cindy the woman in peril.

Toshi Toda's deliciously over the top performance as the gangster Katsuro was phenomenal as well as Tadamori Yagi as his coke head son.

Chic Daniels, Kenny Lombino, Brian McGuire, Yoshi Ando, Jesse Weinberg, Koji Wada round out the first-rate supporting cast.

Cinematographer Ricky Fosheim did a terrific capturing the spirit through excellent images, Production Designer Jennifer Nelson along with Wardrobe and Make-up by Tiffany Anguiano and Nancy Fregoso kept it real.
I generally find movies where the leading actor is also the director as sappy, egotistical, and self-indulgent with the ""Look at me, I am a big star now"" kind of thing. Michael Madison would have none of that here. His laser like focus on the characters and story was clear from the beginning.

So many elements of DELIVERED reminded me of the fun drive-in movies of American International Pictures and Hammer Films with a little Robert Mitchum in YAKUZA (sans giri), Peter Falk in the 1962 THE PRICE OF THE TOMATOES, and Jim Brown in the SPLIT thrown in for good measure. While it would be easy to reference DRIVE, VANISHING POINT, or TRUE ROMANCE, even TO LIVE ND DIE IN LA, I think that the feel is closer to the 1955 THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS with John Ireland.

Here you have a well-crafted true to the bone Indie with an excellent story.

Linda Nelson and Michael Madison team made a small budget independent film with a heart of a lion.

From the forced acting to the badly directed cut-aways; uncomfortably bad scenes or just uncomfortable moments period, I found myself actually wanting to finish it.  Really, it was to see how the seemingly jarring, jumbled mess came together at the end.  After awhile it felt more like a farce with murder in it than a serious crime/revenge drama.  Action film.  Thing. I wouldn't say I hated it because I was honestly curious about the conclusion.  I wouldn't say I loved it either because in spite of me hanging in there, it was a pretty cringe-worthy experience.

- Bad story
- Bad acting
- Bad writing
- Bad music choices
- Bad filming
- Bad audio recording
- Additional scenes that didn't add to the story line and added only confusion.

4860001,4,B005QROUD0,"Okay, I decided to watch this movie when I learned it was the baby of a fellow Texan. That being said, why did you film it in CA as if you could not have found the same and more within the State of Texas with regards to shooting locations.

Regarding the movie itself, the flaws noted by the average viewer, and it is he who you want to reach right, could have been solved with better editing and a couple of re-writes of the screenplay leading to a better ending.  For example, if he is such a boy scout, I don't think anything that essentially caused the death of his mother would have made him leave the house of slaughter with a smile on his face.

The thing that I found to be the saving grace of the film was the realistic gun scenes.  The gunfire sounded like gunfire and the awkward feel was more true to reality than any John Woo slow motion fight.

So if you are looking for complicated characters or complicated story this is not the film for you.  If you are looking for a slick film with lots of special effects and glittery fight scenes, this is not the film for you.

But if you want to study what can be done on the down low you will enjoy this film.  And once again to the maker of this film, there is a reason big money comes to Texas to work. Lots of talent and quite frankly even the dollar is bigger in Texas.",1380844800,6,1330,4.108108108108108

4860006,5,B005QROUD0,"I recently watched this film at the suggestion of a friend and thoroughly enjoyed everything it had to an offer. For an independent project in this type of genre and budget, it certainly ""DELIVERED.""

The story unfolds as Shane struggles to re-adjust to civilian life after returning home from the military. He finds that he must break away from his conscience and make a tough decision by becoming an armed courier to help his mother in a financial predicament. As the film progresses, there are twists and turns that unexpectedly transpire -  great action scenes - and an ending that will surprise you!

Well done. The plot made sense, the storyline unfolded quickly without pointless scenes and motives were consistent. Various technical elements were also apparent and I appreciated some of the creative cinematography executed here. (Great lighting shot of the lead actor in his very cool car at night!)

Strong performance by Michael Madison... (Never heard of him - but thought he was very talented!) Solid, believable and thought he maintained integrity throughout his role. Alana Stewart (always wondered whatever happened to her!) was well cast and also contributed to the film.

A very good watch!! Would definitely recommend.",1374019200,4,1237,5.165

It was great to watch the finish product and irrespective of if you followed the creative process or merely picked up the movie to watch randomly you will enjoy it....(especially if you like loud cars!!)

It has the feel of something like True Romance but is fresh and original in very engaging ways. Michael Madison plays Shane a solider returning back who returns home only to deal with family issues and taking on certain jobs with criminal elements to make ends meet.
