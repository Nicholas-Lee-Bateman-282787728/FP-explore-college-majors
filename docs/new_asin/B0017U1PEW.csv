8267318,5,B0017U1PEW,"This collection of shorts features my favorite ""Frankly Caroline"", a wild high-speed run of animated collages that tell author Caroline's life story. (If this is how it looks as your life flashes by while you're drowning, I can't wait to drown.) Sundance ran this and I had to buy it. You've never seen anything like it (except for some Coke commercials that borrowed heavily from these two artists.) Yes, it's pricey, but this psychedelic show has delighted everyone I've showed it to. Money well spent.",1253750400,,504,4.9411764705882355
8267319,4,B0017U1PEW,"Saw Frank Film eons ago, wanted to jog my memory regarding it and see some other stuff that might be of interest.  The DVD itself is really a DVD-R, but for the most part it seems to be mastered really well. If you are familiar with these or this style of ""animation"", no reason to avoid. Enjoyed it.",1240963200,,300,4.172413793103448
