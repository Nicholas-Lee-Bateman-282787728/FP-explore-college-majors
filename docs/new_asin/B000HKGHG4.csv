8140167,5,B000HKGHG4,The item came quickly and is exactly what I wanted.,1411603200,,51,4.2
8140168,4,B000HKGHG4,"This was quite a bit better than I was expecting. I watched it because it featured Cheryl Ladd who I am a fan of from watching Charlie's Angels.

She is wonderful in this. It's not like quite a lot of the TV Movies, a American family drama, sometimes with other actresses from Charlie's Angels.

It is quite a lot different. It kept me interested right up till the end, trying to find out who the person now after Lisa really is. A better TV Movie with great acting from all really.",1386115200,,482,4.285714285714286
8140169,4,B000HKGHG4,"This movie was truly filled with suspense and leaves the viewer on the edge of their seat until the very end.  The acting is superb, and Cherly Ladd gives a wonderful performance as well as the sweet little girl who plays her daughter.  A very good movie and I would recommend highly!",1376524800,,284,4.4423076923076925
8140170,5,B000HKGHG4,"I watched this movie with my mom when I was a child. Today I watched it for the first time in fourteen plus years. It was just as entertaining now that I'm an adult. It should be noted, the first five minutes of this film are very cheesy and during those five minutes the acting feels forced. After that, the acting and storyline are both really good (for the rest of the film). If you enjoy made for TV movies, and don't expect perfection, check out this underrated gem!",1299542400,8,471,4.303370786516854
8140171,5,B000HKGHG4,This is a really good movie. It's really suspensful & keeps you guessing. The little girl is absolutely a great actress.,1262131200,7,120,4.761904761904762
