5721941,2,B00CG4XKSM,"Sadomania  was a banned movie for good reasons.  I got by the scene where the naked girl was driven into a swamp, the plastic crocodile wasn't as bad as the maniacal laughter from the transexual star when she was shot for sport.  But when a girl tied to a chair was (simulated) raped by a guard dog so the impotent prison governor could finally have sex with his wife,  I thought ""why am I watching this"" and threw the dvd into the trash.  The other movies were harmless enough.",1408320000,,478,4.325842696629214

5721943,5,B00CG4XKSM,"I enjoyed all 5 movies. 99 women, from '69' , is the most serious drama of the five. It had the least amount of skin ( a decent amount though ). The rest had a lot of it. None of them are to be taken seriously. Just for fans of women in prison movies.",1401148800,2,251,3.6666666666666665
5721944,3,B00CG4XKSM,"It's fun for an old guy like me to see the stuff that turned us on back in the
70s-80s when we were so young and possessed of raging libidos. Buy it for
the memories.",1398816000,,166,3.7714285714285714
5721945,4,B00CG4XKSM,"Wow! What a collection. Well-presented here in original aspect ratio, looking great with spectacular audio. Pretty much standard women-in-prison fare, so no need to go into the plots much.

""Amazon Jail"" is to me the best of the lot. It has more gratuitous female nudity in it than any other movie I'd ever seen (until I saw another film later in this same collection...more on that later), but  it also gives us the most attractive females. Apparently some Brazilians in the cast because there's a whole lot of booty going on. But to me a big positive is that it isn't particularly violent as most of these movies are. I don't care to see women beaten, raped or otherwise brutalized.

""Bare Behind Bars"" has several scenes of hard-core pornography (although they are few and far between and not the movie's central focus). Again lost of female nudity, although the women aren't as attractive as in ""Amazon Jail."" And overall  there isn't nearly as much of it. More violent than ""Amazon Jail"" although not as terrible as some. Solid offering and the hard-core is a plus.

""Ninety-Nine Women"" is the stinker. Could have been great, but released in 1969 there isn't nearly as much nudity in it. A shame, because the women are beautiful. And I was very, very turned off by the (real) violence toward a defenseless snake depicted here.

""Sadomania"" is rather notorious for its violence, and a lot of it is grotesque (bestiality--implied, thank God). But it's a keeper due to the sheer crushing volume of gratuitous female nudity. It even goes beyond what  ""Amazon Jail"" gives us--though the women aren't as hot. There is enough full-frontal nudity from enough different women here to fill up eight soft-core sex movies and still leave you satisfied. I don't know if there's a single frame of film that doesn't feature naked women. Definitely no fan of transsexual Ajita Wilson as the security enforcer, but there is a ton of eye candy beyond her/him.

""Women Behind Bars"" features a couple of stunningly-beautiful women, and some nice nudity, but nothing near the level of ""Sadomania"" or ""Amazon Jail."" Again a little too brutal for my tastes though nothing on the level of ""Sadomania.""

in short this certainly is worth looking at if you're a fan of WIP or for that matter, just like looking at a lot of hot totally-naked chicks.",1391990400,29,2326,4.809523809523809
5721946,5,B00CG4XKSM,"Fantastic set of rare women in prison movies, uncut and unedited and nicely restored, although you won't confuse them for new or big budget movies, I've watched 3 of the films so far and I'm thrilled with the purchase, if you're a fan of grindhouse or W.I.P. flicks this set is a must have, I have dozens of W.I.P. sets and films in my collection and this set is now the gem of my collection, if you're new to the genrea or don't want to fill your shelves with a ton of exploitation flicks this is the one set you want to get.",1383609600,24,526,4.116504854368932
8581507,3,B00CG4XKSM,99 Women was a pretty good movie for its type. Sadomania and Women Behind Bars were okay. The other two were drek with almost no plot. A few scenes in Bare Behind Bars would qualify as hard porn.,1506556800,,195,4.157894736842105
8581508,5,B00CG4XKSM,"Great collection of movies. Bare Behind Bars is the best. 70% of the movie women are completely nude. Women with real breasts and not bald, got to love it. Could watch it over and over. Amazon Jail has a lot of topless and some full frontal. Sadomania has topless and full frontal. Women Behind Bars might not have the amount of nudity of the others but what it does is quality close ups. 99 Women has very little nudity but it is from 1969 so it is to be expected",1431993600,,464,4.166666666666667

8581514,4,B00CG4XKSM,"A collection of 5 movies in 2 DVDs.  Only one is X-rated.  Others are edited to R rating.
Women Prison movies fall in one story line.  Collection Officers are mean and violent.  Prisoners, guilty and innocent as they claimed,
are divided into gangs.  Lunch and Playground breaks invite fighting chances.  Shower scenes encourages Lesbian development
and Peeping Tom.
Regarding the X-rated one, its ending has a long and explicit sex scene.  The escapee were very violent with their male victims
(family heads) on way of hiding.  It is not only scary but a turn-off.  Especially the surviving boy is a witness to this crime.",1417132800,3,623,4.913461538461538

8581516,5,B00CG4XKSM,"I loved this entire collection. No other director dared to tell such a vivid depiction of female prison life before or since. Amazing strength and fortitude is displayed by desperate women willing to do extraordinary acts for sex and ultimately, their freedom.",1411689600,3,260,5.214285714285714
