8314373,4,B001K98MIC,This movie was nice. Final jammed in with a few episodes. I bought for collector purposes and the fact that it is in 16x9. If you have not seen the show I would recommend the anime legends collection.,1278460800,,200,4.2894736842105265
8314374,4,B001K98MIC,"If you are an anime fan and don't have the time to see all 50 some episodes, then get this dvd set. It recaps the whole story to the point and deleting unnecessary dialog and other stuff just to fill in for a 30mn air show.",1272412800,,223,3.869565217391304
