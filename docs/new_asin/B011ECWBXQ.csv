8724145,5,B011ECWBXQ,Love watching the munsters. I like finding extra footage,1521244800,,56,5.333333333333333
8724146,2,B011ECWBXQ,This would have gotten 5 stars if the DVD didn't repeat everything over and over again! They clearly could have put additional footage or a few episodes to fill the DVD instead of repeating clips! It's an OK DVD for a fan to have there was a few clips/commercials I never seen,1517702400,,276,4.326923076923077
8724147,5,B011ECWBXQ,"This DVD features the 30 minute network version of Yvonne De Carlo's first episode ""My Fair Munster"" which is different from the version that was aired on TV. The picture is a little blown out, but overall it is very watchable and enjoyable.",1515801600,,241,4.627906976744186
8724148,4,B011ECWBXQ,"Good for people like me who like to know stuff.  If you want true entertainment, buy the series and don't bother with this history stuff.  But for us detail folks, it is gold.  Quality of some of the recordings were not feature quality, but it was not the released, broadcasted version anyway.  Worth the buy for those who want this kind of stuff.  Glad they changed the Mrs. and Eddie before going live.",1456444800,7,404,4.47945205479452
