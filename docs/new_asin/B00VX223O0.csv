8711626,4,B00VX223O0,"We received an advanced copy of this Pound Puppies DVD and my 2 yo twins are really enjoying it! They keep asking for the puppies to be turned on. As someone that loved the original Pound Puppies as a child, it's fun to sit and watch this newer version with them. The episodes on Pound Puppies Pick of the Litter include:

Dog on a Wire
Pound Preemies
Cuddle up Buttercup
The Pups Who Loved Me
I'm Ready For My Close Pup",1436832000,2,420,4.185185185185185
