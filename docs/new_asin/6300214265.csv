228969,2,6300214265,"DVD review.  If you know you like the film and you're just curious about the DVD, the DVD quality is fine.

Movie caution.  If, like me, you remember fondly the section on moon base Alpha Beta with William Shatner and are thinking of buying the film ... there's a reason you only remember the Shatner portion.  That part of the film is classic!  But the rest of the film is hugely forgettable - a weak repeat of the classic Airplane (Airplane 1 if you must).",1505347200,,458,4.341176470588235

228974,5,6300214265,"This is a more futuristic version of the original Airplane movie with A few different people and a few different jokes while keeping to the original formula.

Not as surprising as the first, but still worth watching. People who made their living being heroes including Lloyd Bridges (Sea Hunt), Leslie Nielsen (Forbidden Planet), Raymond Burr (Perry Mason), now let their hair down in this thought provoking sequel.

This may have contributed to the conversion of William Shatner from Captain Kirk (Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 28: ""The City on the Edge of Forever"") to ""The Big Head"" on 3rd Rock From The Sun.

There was so much I had either forgotten or didn't ""get"" at the time. For example, there were several 'jokes' involving the Catholic priest. I guess back then, I had no idea how sadly accurate and relevant some of those lines would become one day. Maybe the writers knew something the rest of us didn't. And there were also several strong, thinly disguised digs at Ronald Reagan.(Hint - some had to do with the Space Shuttle being certified flight worthy when it clearly was NOT.) But mostly the many 'play on words' gags were refreshingly simple and funny at the same time. Just good, clean, light-hearted fun. This may become a classic one day.",1464566400,,816,4.63448275862069

230901,1,6300214265,"i don't actually feel that way, of course. i actually enjoy sequels, as a rule, and have used more than one review to combat whatever stigma it is that declares every sequel a P.O.S., solely for being a sequel. but when a film actually provides such an obvious set-up AND turned out to be as wretched as this one is, no self-respecting wit could live with himself if he passed it up.
the original Airplane! was a milestone in the art of comedy. not only did it introduce a whole new style of comedy, it turbo-charged the dwindling career of Leslie Nielsen in the process. what's more, despite numerous topical elements which can't help but date it (not least of which the fact that the ""disaster"" genre it so gleefully skewers would pretty much evaporate not long after), it remains one of the most revered and in-demand comedies in the annals of cinema.
you know a genre is less than brilliant when it's inevitable spoof goes down in History as the very finest specimen thereof ever filmed.
in short, what we have here is the sort of cold-blooded sequel prompted solely by the original's runaway success. even so it might've been at least passable, if only writer/directors Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and David Zucker hadn't opted to sit this one out. (they admit in their DVD comedy for the first that they never even bothered to see Airplane II, and it's hard to say they missed anything.) the reins were then handed over to one Ken Finkleman, who apparently was some sort of specialist in lackluster, fast-buck sequels. he's probably best known for writing (to again hit below the belt) Grease 2.
Finkleman doesn't do too bad a job in recreating the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker methodology. his notion of converting it to science-fiction certainly had possibilities. the problem is that the ZAZ style is too unique for anyone else's foray into the same territory NOT to feel like a counterfeit.
the most obvious problem is that it's mostly the same jokes, and not always so artfully executed. one of the most memorable moments of the original finds former jet-ace Ted Striker describing such a passenger airliner as ""an entirely different kind of flying, altogether,"" to which Leslie Nielsen and Lorna Patterson reply in unison ""it's an entirely different kind of flying."" this time around, a stewardess informers the captain that his copilot and navigator have been sucked out of an airlock. when the captain replies ""both together?,"" the stewardess repeats the last line with back-up from another stewardess. it's a naked retread, and an awkward, forced naked retreat at that.
another regret is the ""special guest star"" angle that was one of the first's key gimmicks. it was rare enough in the first to have an impact, but Finkelman crowds us with the likes of Raymond Burr, John Vernon, Chad Everett, Sonny Bono, Chuck Conners, Rip Torn, John Dehner, Herve Villechaize, and William Shatner just as his brand of flashy histrionics was becoming the punchline we know and love. to say nothing Lloyd Bridges and Peter Graves coming back for more. they're so all over the place one half wonders if the all-star cast angle isn't the only think Finkleman remembered at the time.
(it's hard to say why Robert Stack and Leslie Nielsen couldn't make it back, but somehow i doubt either regretted it.)
i'm not saying Finkleman didn't come up with a few good gags. early on, for instance, we see an alien clean meant to be E.T. trying to ""phone home"" collect, and being informed to deposit several million dollars for the first three minutes. one of ZAZ's innovations was comedy credits, such as when the original cited Charles Dickens as ""author of A Tale Of Two Cities."" this film, after citing it's own ""best boy,"" declares ""worst boy: Adolf Hitler.""
but individual gags like that are one thing, and holding a production together is another. gags are fleeting, whereas plot and characterization, not to mention vision, must play their part throughout. and has already stated, the vision behind the original Airplane! was just too singular and unprecedented for any other filmmaker. there was simply no way for Finkleman or anyone else make the film in a way that DOESN'T feel like a rank ZAZ forgery.
i'm a little ashamed of myself for resorting to it, but corny cliche or not, it really is the most fitting sign-off for this review. so here goes: this film just doesn't get off the ground.",1456444800,,4384,4.823373173970784

Once I began to realize what the filmmakers were doing it all started to take shape a made good comic sense.

Without the involvement of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker unlike in the original,this film does not hold a candle to the timeless classic.

The significant difference in this film and the original is that the event takes place in the spaceship headed towards the moon after an airplane crew was assigned by the management to take over.

231408,4,6300214265,"Pretty much everyone has seen Airplane, but this sequel often seems to be overlooked, lost in the deep shadows cast by its hilarious predecessor.  Only a tiny minority could possibly argue that Airplane II is as good as the first one  how could it be when it recycles a lot of the same jokes and gags?  but this film gets better and better as it goes along.  Strange as it may sound, what makes Airplane II so funny is ultimately the fact that it does follow the original story and approach to comedy as closely as it does.  Apart from moving the endangered flight into outer space this time around, this sequel is largely a carbon copy of the original.  Unfortunately, several scenes seem to be missing from the DVD and Blu-Ray releases, for reasons I certainly cannot fathom.

I had my doubts during the first quarter of the film.  The same jokes that seemed so funny in the original just weren't connecting very strongly this second time around.  In retrospect, I think this had a lot to do with the characters delivering those one-liners.  Apart from Striker (Robert Hays) and Elaine (Julie Hagerty), these were mostly new characters.  (I also have to admit that I found this second dose of Elaine quite annoying.)  More familiar faces began to come in over time, though, and the tide really turned with the return of McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges).  Everything just fell into place after that, and the appearance of William Shatner toward the end raised the bar of comedy up another notch.

As for the story, it takes place a little while after the events of the first film.  It seems that Striker and Elaine did not find mutual happiness after all.  She became a computer specialist helping design a state-of-the-art flight computer, while he landed a job as the test pilot for the worlds first passenger spacecraft designed to take people to and from a new lunar colony on the moon.  After telling the company that the space plan was basically a poorly designed death trap and then crashing it in one of his tests, the company blamed everything on poor Striker and had him put away in a mental institution.  Elaine got engaged to a total jerk, and now the two of them are taking part in the Mayflowers maiden voyage to the moon.  Obviously, Striker breaks out of the hospital and straight for the plane before it can be launched.

Theres no Leslie Nielsen or Robert Stack this time around, but returning characters include Striker, Elaine, McCroskey, Captain Oveur (Peter Graves), Jacobs (that nutty little guy prancing around the control tower), and the main jive-talking passenger.  Shatner pretty much steals the show toward the end, but hes only one of several great new characters, such as Chuck Connors as Sarge, Rip Torn, Jim Noble (the governor from Benson) and Sonny Bono.  Those making cameos include Raymond Burr, Herve Villechaize, and even a young Pat Sajak.  Its always great fun to see who will turn up in these films.

In the end, I actually enjoyed Airplane II almost as much as I enjoyed the original.  Just the scenes with Lloyd Bridges and William Shatner alone make the film well worth seeing.  If you enjoyed the comedy of Airplane, youll enjoy this sequel, as well, as it was truly cast in the same mold as its predecessor, providing one eminently quotable line after another.  Its utterly shameless comedy at its best.  Some of the same old jokes may not be quite as funny the second time around, but this film still made me laugh on numerous occasions.",1404172800,,3479,4.696369636963697

231455,3,6300214265,"As if to prove that nothing succeeds like imitation, producer Howard W. Koch takes the plots, characters and gags from the first film (1980) and recycles them in a spoof that has intrepid pilot Striker (Robert Hays) and his faithful assistant Elaine (Julie Hagerty) trying their best to stop a passenger-laden aircraft from being incinerated by the sun.  Jokes come thick and fast in this ninety-minute piece - so fast, in fact, that if we blink an eye we are likely to miss them.  While some of them are extremely funny, many of them might also be considered extremely sexist, involving nymphomaniac virgins (a deliberate contradiction), clerics giving blow-jobs, repeated close-ups of female breasts.  Other jokes might be thought of as simply taboo in today's world (for example, implied references to pedophilia and/or bestiality). Nonetheless AIRPLANE 2 offers a good example of great character actors from US television of the Sixties and Seventies - Lloyd Bridges, Chad Everett, Peter Graves, Chuck Connors - being willing to make fun of themselves onscreen.  They might have had no choice (especially if their found work difficult to come by after their respective series had concluded), but they clearly relish the opportunity to deliver their ridiculous lines with deadpan seriousness.  Shatner is especially good as a service commander charged with the responsibility of bringing the stricken ship to a safe landing (he fails, by the way).",1387929600,,1450,5.232758620689655

231749,4,6300214265,"Movie :
Original Airplane + variations of the same jokes + Battlestar Galactica theme + William Shatner = a very good sequel.  I think Einstein came up with that equation and i would have to agree.  I enjoyed Airplane 2 as much as the first, if not more believe it or not, just for reasons mentioned above(your mileage may vary).  The sequel is just basically more of the same taking place on a space shuttle.

DVD :
But you can find better, more in-depth, scholarly reviews of the film from others.  I'm here to discuss the new ""I love the 80's"" dvd version.  Not much to discuss really.  It's an 84 minute(the cut version), bare bones, widescreen edition with basic chapter/set-up options(english or french audio and english subtitles)...and that's it.  Picture quality is not that good.  So it's not a special or new edition by any means, unless you count new cover art as special cause i don't.  If you got a previous version, no need to update.

CD :
However, i picked up my copy for $7.50 at a certain retail outfit with the bullseye logo(ok it was Target, they're affiliated with Amazon so i think it's ok to mention them).  They had a section dedicated to this 'new' 80's dvd series and every one of them had a sticker for it advertising a free bonus ""limited edition cd"".  There are only 4 songs on it, but 4 very good choices :
Echo & the Bunnymen's ""Lips Like Sugar"" (awesome)
Erasure's ""Chains of Love"" (excellent)
INXS's ""Need You Tonight"" (very cool)
A-Ha's ""Take On Me"" (never heard of it)

Overall :
The movie i recommend as a comedy or if you enjoyed the first and basically want more.  The 80's series dvd version i recommend only if you don't have a previous version on dvd, cause they really haven't added anything new by way of special features or remastering.  The new artwork and 4-song bonus cd is not really a big incentive either, and let's face it...if you're an 80's fan you'd have those songs anyway(except for the A-Ha song, i hear that's pretty rare).",1214956800,13,1982,4.525280898876405

231754,4,6300214265,"Airplane II: The Sequel is a funny film, though it is only a shadow of the original.  Whereas the first Airplane! was a spoof of the 70s disaster movie, the sequel sends up science fiction, with a particular emphasis on 2001: A Space Odyssey, with some Star Trek thrown in thanks to the welcome addition of William Shatner.

Airplane II succeeds in places where most sequels, particularly sequels of spoofs, fail.  It does not simply recycle the gags from the previous film, although there are a few moments such as the recurrence of Ted Striker (Robert Hays)'s drinking problem that are lifted directly from the original.  Airplane II stays close to its disaster roots by having a computer kill off the crew, leaving Striker to try to save the day and win back Elaine (Julie Hagerty).  Shakespeare it's not, but enough of a plot is there to keep this from just being a collection of one-liners and sight gags.

The larger problem is that there is a little too much plot and that some of the jokes are dated or simply no longer funny.  The Rocky poster and the Japanese couple with dozens of cameras were probably funny when this film was released in 1982, but with the decline of Sly and the end of ethnic stereotype as comedy, these bits fall a bit flat.  Similarly, the comedy inherent in having Sonny Bono as the bumbling terrorist is lost when you are working with a generation that thinks of Bono as the late Congressman from California.

The problem of sparsely spaced-out gags is probably a result of the cut.  Some of my favorite scenes, such as McCrosky (Lloyd Bridges) being hospitalized because he thinks he's Lloyd Bridges, have been cut out.  Similarly, Leslie Nielson, a star in the first film, is not in Airplane II at all and the role of Johnny (Steven Strucker) is greatly reduced.  On the other hand, this cut restores some racy scenes from the original.  While this makes the film funnier for the adult audience, the restored comedy makes this more of a PG 13 than the PG rating it originally received.

Those complaints aside, Airplane II is still a good film.  The acting by Hays and Hagerty is as dynamic and funny as it was the first time around; I'm still mystified why neither had a big career after this series.  Peter Graves, Bridges and Shatner all shine in their roles, and there are solid supporting performances from Raymond Burr, John Vernon, and Rip Torn.

Like the first film, Airplane II also has plenty of sight gags in the background, ranging from a nurse with an `I love sanity' outfit to a drug deal gone bad in Mission Control.  If you are like me, you will have to watch and listen carefully to get all of the jokes; it took me forever to figure out the joke behind a reporter `getting a picture for the Daily News.'  A director's commentary, or at least a pop-up video version, of this film would have been a nice addition, but sadly this is a basic DVD with nothing besides language options and the trailer.

The bottom line is that while Airplane II isn't the original and it isn't family entertainment, it is good comedy and well worth the time spent watching.",1151539200,13,3106,4.572202166064982
231755,3,6300214265,"The DVD release of the classic comedy film has restored many scenes missing from both TV showings and the original VHS release, though at the unprecedented cost of random pieces throughout the movie.  While several jokes will be new to those seeing the DVD for the first time (many sexual and drug related), fans of the other formats of the movie will no doubt be scratching their heads as scenes go by without memorable bits.

With the trend of jamming every possible thing onto a DVD release, it's baffling that this movie would be released with scenes missing from it.  That and the conspicuous lack of special features tarnishes a true great among comedy movies.

Comparing it to the original is natural, but given we have a different director and a different approach, it is best to let it stand on its own.  And I found it did for me.

Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty are back as the starstruck lovers and the bit where she removes her bobby pin to give to Hays is truly funny.  Stephen Shucker is back, although he's not used as much, but his one liners are still hilarious.  Peter Graves returns as the pilot who likes little boys; Lloyd Bridges is back as the flight commander; Chuck Connors and William Shatner are fun in their brief roles, and we get nice bits from Chad Everett, Raymond Burr, Rip Torn, John Dehner and John Vernon.

Perhaps the lack of the Zucker team at the helm helped steer this vessel on to the rocks, as it certainly dived at the box office pretty rapidly. Don't get me wrong, this is still funny, but is really only a reworking of the original movie, only this time using a Space Shuttle as the doomed aircraft. The main characters are all back to reprise their roles with the addition of William Shatner (who's presence and role are one of the high points of the movie), but unfortunately the director just went with the same formula, and the lack of fresh material, makes the movie lumber. Fans of the genre will no doubt find plenty here to keep themselves amused, and the budget price means that your home collection can be completed quite inexpensively if you have the original, but otherwise this is a bit of a let down.

231805,4,6300214265,"The redundantly-titled (on purpose, of course) AIRPLANE 2 - THE SEQUEL (1982) follows the rapid-fire, gag-a-second style of the original AIRPLANE! (1980) so well that, although it doesn't come close to matching the original for laughs, it's amazing that it was made without any input at all from the ZAZ boys (Jerry Zucker-Jim Abrahams-David Zucker) whatsoever---no writing, no directing, nada! It was in fact written and directed by just one man: none other than Ken Finkleman. I know, you're probably asking, Ken Who? Well, it seems that good ol' Ken is rather famous---more like *infamous*---for two mega-bombs of the '80's: GREASE 2 (made the same year, actually---1982) and WHO'S THAT GIRL? (1987). The fact that he took a beloved comedy that was still fresh in the minds of the audience members and dared to follow it up with his own vision, and made it this funny, is just amazing. (Now, if he only could have done that good a job with GREASE 2...)
Of course, AIRPLANE 2 - THE SEQUEL couldn't live up to the lofty expectations set by its predecessor, but that's okay, as there are some big-league laughs here. Robert Hays returns as the stone-faced, hilariously serious Ted Striker as he tries to prevent disaster on the First Passenger Space Shuttle To The Moon. Along for the ride, literally, are Julie Hagerty as Elaine, the flight attendant and Striker's ongoing love interest from the first film. Also making a return is (believe it or not) Lloyd Bridges as old Steven McCrosky (who must've picked a bad time to start guiding space shuttles), and Peter Graves as Capt. Clarence Oveur (thankfully, little Johnny didn't board this flight). Too bad Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen) didn't come back for this trip; however, joining the crew in AIRPLANE 2 - THE SEQUEL are Chuck Connors as The Sarge, Raymond Burr as Judge D.C. Simonton, and William Shatner as Commander Buck Murdock. Shatner steals the show and gives what is easily the funniest performance in this film. Unless you've never seen Star Trek, you're bound to get the endless jokes!
In short, this is a really short movie. At only 85 minutes, with at least five of those minutes showing flashbacks to the first AIRPLANE!, this sequel doesn't give us very much. However, it still gives us plenty of hilarious moments, such as what happens at the end of a line of people, each one exclaiming ""Striker,"" ""Striker,"" ""Striker...!"" Also, it gives us Sonny Bono as the villain---c'mon, you can't possibly hate a movie that does that---plus, we get brilliant cameos by Rip Torn, Herv Villechaize, and James Noble (the Governor on the TV show ""Benson"" for those who don't recall the name). Not only that, but David Leisure is back! (Although, instead of playing ""First Hare Krishna"" he's playing ""Religious Zealot #1."")
Listen, I wouldn't recommend spending the proverbial arm & a leg on this DVD, especially because, like its predecessor, it offers absolutely nothing in the way of extras. But, at the price for which it's being offered on Amazon, I'd say that it's well worth it.

Elaine is on the speaker to the passengers telling them the lunar shuttle is off course just ""a tad"" and someone asks what exactly a ""tad"" is, and she replies ""90000000 miles and we're heading straight for the sun!"" which causes chaos... Funny stuff!

231812,5,6300214265,"In reading the list of reviews posted here, it's clear that many who have reviewed this film, just plain don't get it.  For starters, Airplane One is perhaps the greatest comedy every made.  To put this movie down by comparing it to the original is like saying every new film that comes out stinks because it's not quite as good as Citizen Kane.
The second mistake people make is to point out the places where this movie continues jokes from Airplane 1.  These items are re-used for one simple reason, BECAUSE THEY WERE HILARIOUS!!!  One thing to remember is that in '80 & '82, VCRs and rental stores had not completely taken root in popular culture.  When this movie came out in 1982, it's not like the fans of the first had been sitting around watching the video over and over again for a year leading up to it--  They had been sitting around for two years talking about the funniest movie they had ever seen.  They continued the humor in the same way that Saturday Night Live did A LOT more than ONE episode of Hans and Franz, or Chris Farley's motivational speaker.
If you buy this movie, just watch it, and enjoy it; not for what it isn't, but what it is.  Slapstick has never been done as well as in the two Airplane movies.

Instead of fresh new comedy this sequel attempts to RECYCLE old jokes from the original.  Examples: More decaff coffee jokes, tossing cigarettes that blow up in the background, the scene where everyone lines up to slap sense into the woman who is having a breakdown.  Who wrote this [stuff] script?  A check of the credits reveals that apparently the original authors of the original Airplane (Abrahams, David and Jerry Zucker) may not have even contributed to this film.  Paramount should be ashamed of this.  The lowest low is when an attempt is made to recycle the infamous opening of Airplane, when the recorded voices are heard arguing over ""the red zone is for loading and unloading...""  This occurs at 32:20 into the film if you must see a bad, awful attempt to recycle a joke.

Although the plot of this movie is pretty much the same as the first there is a slugh of new gags, plus some old ones revisited that makes this movie a great companion to the original.

There are a few time sensative gags that some might not understand if they were not around for that era, but not as many as the original or other movies from this era.

As a major complaint about sequels is they simply repeat the original with subtle changes it only makes sense for the sequel to Airplane to address this directly by almost copying some jokes almost verbatim. I sometimes enjoy the sequel more because the jokes never stop, in Airplane!, the last 20 minutes were slow with the jokes as the plot was being wrapped up.
I am giving the DVD only 1 star because it only has the movie, no special features not even an audio commentary. I would have loved to have the theatrical version and a version with every scene available. The movie is only 86 minutes; there would have been room on the DVD.

The producers and writers of this lackluster endeavor obviously didn't put a lot of thought or effort into making this film. Much of the material is nothing more than a variation of what was in the original ""Airplane!,"" which makes for a rather dull and predictable movie.
In ""Airplane 2,"" the writers do try to vary the plot a bit by changing the venue to the 21st century but this does more harm than good.

The sequel to Airplane! has the same laugh a minute style as the original, which is surprising considering both films were written and directed by different people.  The original was written, produced, and directed by Abrahams, Zucker, and Zucker (Naked Gun Films) and this sequel was written and directed by Ken Finkleman (Who's that girl, Grease 2).  Any way both films are very funny.  The sequel picks up with the same characters.  Striker (Hays), now in a mental hopspital (because ""he's sick..sick..sick"" is still in love with Elaine (Hagerty) and tries to persuade her to help stop the XR2300 lunar launch because he believes the ship is faulty.  The shuttle launches anyway and the scenes on board switch to Striker's court case which has to do with his flight ""over macho grande"" and his saving the Airplane! in the original film.  Next the plane starts to ""shimmy"" and the pilots are knocked out by the ship's computer ROC (Like Hal from 2001).  If that's not enough, Sonny Bono has brought a bomb (not a buh, a bomb) and plans to blow everyone up because of his impotence problem.  Striker is helped by none other than William Shatner (in a very funny preformance) to land the shuttle.  Many funny characters make return appearances, especially Lloyd Bridges as McCroskey. The DVD is the widescreen version which is nice but there are no extras which is disappointing but both Airplane films are must haves regardless.

The ABC TV version of the film restored key scenes such as Chad Everett's character getting into a spacesuit. Some of the jokes in the movie were written by Al Jean and Mike Reiss(from The Simpsons and The Critic).  Some of the sight gags are clever. William Shatner's character sees the Starship Enterprise floating through space. There were plans for Airplane III, but they were cancelled after the second film underperformed. A Grease 3 was cancelled after Grease 2(1982) flopped. In the film, Robert Hays' character has to land the Mayflower spaceship on the moon after the supercomputer aboard kills and disables the pilots. There's a subplot with Sunny Bono's character trying to blow up the Mayflower with a bomb. The film spoofs Airport(1970) and 2001 A Space Odyssey(1968).
