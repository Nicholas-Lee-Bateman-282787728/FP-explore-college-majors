2916512,5,B000U1ZV26,Baby Einstein always delivers a great product & they have done it again.  People are always commenting that my 2 year old has a great vocabulary - I think these videos have really helped.,1196467200,2,187,4.5
2916513,1,B000U1ZV26,"We love the baby Einstein videos and have many of them.  As adults watching these, we were looking forward to this one because we both love lullabies.  We were sorely disappointed that it is basically all classical music (Brahms) with only a tease of ""Hush Little Baby"" and a short ""Lullaby, Say Goodnight"" finale in there.
Our little one watches these in his jumperoo right before bed and they normally work him up and wear him out for bedtime.  Even he was bored!!

The sleeping lamb blowing the feather was cute.",1196380800,11,515,4.626373626373627
2916514,2,B000U1ZV26,"I don't understand why there are so many Baby Einstein movies with the same title and it gets a little frustrating when the price of one of these things is upwards of $20! I, in desperation mode, decided to purchase this version on a night of kid screaming that wouldn't end and I am thoroughly unimpressed... However, my son does prefer this one over the other Einstein Baby Lullaby with the lamb on it.",1420329600,,404,4.472972972972973
2916515,5,B000U1ZV26,"This has been a must have in our home. It's been a part of our bedtime routine since my twins were 8wks old. We were watching it on YouTube, but recently traveled with a DVD player, and realized how valuable the DVD would've been so we bought it for our future travels. As soon as the opening line starts they are mesmerized and asleep shortly after.",1415750400,,350,4.318181818181818
2916516,5,B000U1ZV26,Bad because that stupid.  Sheep is in.  There because. He is. The hos,1415750400,,69,4.230769230769231
2916517,5,B000U1ZV26,This movie has captured my child's eye. She loves it!  I love it; it calms her down and eases her! Great movie!,1412812800,,111,4.045454545454546
2916518,3,B000U1ZV26,"Not what I thought it was supposed to be. Not long enough to hold my toddlers attention. Did for a minute then the DVD was over with no repeat so had to keep getting up and putting it back on. My daughter does love the classical music, and bright pictures",1411344000,,255,4.12
2916519,1,B000U1ZV26,"Im sure the shown dvd is wonderful, UNFORTUNATELY, the one they sent me isn't the one shown...something as easy as sticking the right dvd in the envelope...and it won't let me return it..",1395446400,,187,4.696969696969697
2916520,5,B000U1ZV26,Baby loves everything but the ocean scenes. He smiles as soon as the lamb puppet comes on at the beginning. We use it when baby wakes up early and I'm still getting ready for work in the morning. It's been a godsend.,1377302400,,216,4.166666666666667
2916521,5,B000U1ZV26,"Very timely service, an excellent product, and I am very satisfied. I am certain to shop with them another time.",1363737600,,112,4.65
2916522,2,B000U1ZV26,Not nearly as good as the rest.  Son bored after a minute.  Wish I had never purchased this. Cd would have been better,1360713600,,118,4.086956521739131
2916523,5,B000U1ZV26,"This was a gift, Mom loved it she told me that her 3 month old loved the DVD, the baby laughed out loud",1359417600,,103,3.5217391304347827
2916524,5,B000U1ZV26,"For the longest, my baby had her days and nights mixed up and she's never liked to be rocked, so I was at wit's end trying to figure out something I could do to get her to calm down and go to sleep at night. A friend of mine suggested this DVD, so we got it and instantly the baby's sleep patterns changed. We can just pop this in with the lights turned down and keep the volume kind of low and she's out like a light. The images and music are soothing and the length is just right. Usually run it twice in a row (love the Repeat Play!) and she's out, or close enough to put her down. I HIGHLY recommend this for parents of children who don't like to sleep, it's been a real lifesaver!",1310083200,,685,3.971014492753623
2916525,1,B000U1ZV26,"A friend of mine gave me the BE Da Vinci video, and my baby was SO enraptured with it, I thought it was a slice of brilliance!  So I went ahead and ordered three more BE videos - Baby Monet, and the two Lullaby ones.

I am very disappointed with the Lullaby ones. JUST when my baby nods off to the brilliant 25-minute video compilation of soothing images and songs, a SUPER LOUD, upbeat, obnoxious commerical for Baby Einstein Pals comes on and scares her into a fit of crying!  I CANNOT believe that the company could have made such a terrible oversight on a product that is supposed to help all of us dog-tired newborn mamas with babies that do not know how to soothe themselves to sleep. I can only assume that the company has purposely placed this video there strategically (inside the repeat play function, no less!) to FORCE people (and by people, I mean SLEEP DEPRIVED NEWBORN PARENTS) to watch this commercial, at the expense of the very thing that the lullaby video is selling - inducing sleep.

The two videos are pretty useless to me right now, which is a real shame because the actual lullaby footage WORKS like a charm.

A big fan who is very disappointed.",1305072000,4,1169,4.469483568075117
2916526,1,B000U1ZV26,"This is the worst Baby Einstein movie we got. My 12 month old lost the interest after 5 min.
Even music is boring :(",1303689600,,116,3.875
2916527,4,B000U1ZV26,"I love the music in this DVD and so does my little one, however, he gets a little bored with the scenes of it. It could be because he is so young (4 mo). My little granddaughter really liked the music but she, at 6 mo got bored with the imagery that was captured in the DVD.",1300752000,,274,3.824561403508772
2916528,5,B000U1ZV26,"My 11 month old twins love this video. They have several non - baby einstein videos, however, those videos do not keep their attention. They are glued to the screen as mom drives from grandmas house. Two thumbs up for this video!",1276905600,,229,4.476190476190476
2916529,5,B000U1ZV26,"I ordered this for my baby boy. There was a problem with the product when it first arrvied so I contacted the seller. Video Hut solved the problem QUICKLY.

1 thumbs up for the product. 2 thumbs up for the seller Video Hut.",1274140800,,223,4.186046511627907
2916530,4,B000U1ZV26,"I thought this would be a very slow-moving video, that I could use to help wind-down my baby before nap-time.  There are a couple of parts in the video that move really fast, in my opinion, and are more stimulating than soothing.  Other than that, I do like the words and the theme.",1265587200,,282,4.30188679245283
2916531,5,B000U1ZV26,"My 3 month old daughter loves this video! We rotate watching all the 3 month baby einsteins, one a day. She loves all of them!",1241308800,,126,4.08
2916532,5,B000U1ZV26,"Calming...and works. Putting on this DVD around nap-time prepares my 3mo old for taking a 45min nap. This keeps her occupied until she falls alseep. I also love the Bonus Material. The ""Sheep Dreams"" even put my husband to sleep. Very peaceful and calming. I even found myself laughing out loud during the bonus material ""counting sheep"". You'll have to check it out to see why. I won't ruin the surprise. Overall one of my favorite Baby Einstein DVDs. This is perfect for my 3 mo old.",1241308800,,485,4.586206896551724
2916533,5,B000U1ZV26,Great lullaby music and visional pictures. My daughter can sit there watching it and fall to sleep.,1239667200,,99,4.882352941176471
2916534,1,B000U1ZV26,Each short segment has credits following.  Very hard to watch. Even for us grown ups.  Very disappointing.,1234569600,,106,5.176470588235294
2916535,4,B000U1ZV26,"My son LOVES this video, as do my husband and I.  We really get sucked into it and I can understand why babies love it.  It's really cute and well put together.  I wouldn't pay full price for it but, finding it used worked out GREAT and was worth the $8.00? I paid for it.  Definitely recommend it!",1222041600,,298,4.086206896551724
2916536,5,B000U1ZV26,My 22 month old loves all the Baby Einstein Movies. And this one is no different. I have made it a part of the night time routine. She just knows now when this movie is in it is time to slow down relax and it is almost time for bed.,1220572800,,232,3.66
2916537,5,B000U1ZV26,I am very pleased with this product. The service was fantastic. My order arrived quickly and well packaged. Thanks so much.,1213401600,,123,4.904761904761905
2916538,2,B000U1ZV26,"I bought this for my son, thinking it would be FULL of lullaby's, stuff I could sing or rock him to, I was wrong!! There is like what, one song?!?! My cats watch this more than my son, just because of all the moving objects on the screen. I do LOVE the Baby Einstein DVD's but this one is a miss!! I don't recommend it! I am sure there are other, better lullaby dvd's out there! I mean, its cute but not what I expected it to be at all!!",1205798400,,437,3.8666666666666667
2916539,1,B000U1ZV26,"I have many einstein videos to compare this one to.  So let me say...don't waste your money! First of all, this video goes to a black screen for more than 7 seconds at times, between clips. My baby starts looking around and fussing every time there's a black screen.  Second, it repeats the same clips over and over. How many times can my child look at the same ocean shot and still be entertained?! Not to mention, the age goes from entertaining little ones, to the kind of entertainment only a toddler would enjoy. And last, I'm sick and tired of having to fast forward through all of the stupid introductions before the video starts.  They have to put the caterpillar clip on TWICE before the video starts.  (But that's just a beef I have with ALL of their einsteins.) HATED this one! My baby gets excited with Mozart and Bethoven.",1202428800,2,834,4.503311258278146
2916540,2,B000U1ZV26,"The content of this video is a bit slow, which is probably more by intent than anything - I'm good with boring for bedtime preparation.  My issue with this video is more the commercial at the beginning and the end of the video for the new Einstein Pals product line.  They placed the commercial inside the ""Play Once"" and ""Repeat Play"" parameters, so once he's worn down from the 'boring' video, the stupid upbeat commercial comes on with louder tone and awakening pictures to ruin the ""mood"".  Disney has plenty of other opportunites to market their materials without inserting a contradictive ad to what should be a mellow video.",1202256000,28,631,4.770642201834862
2916541,4,B000U1ZV26,"If you're going to buy a children's video, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child.  I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.

Having said that, I have a beef with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and marketing this to BABIES.  It seems to imply that watching these videos is good for babies, which they are NOT!  These videos may be great for older kids, but definitely NOT for babies' brains!

After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%,  3) for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old, there is a significant odds increase for being a bully later on, and 4)consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2, and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2!  I think it's important for parents and caregivers to be aware of this so they can make better informed choices. I hope it encourages some people to limit television usage for babies and look for other outlets when possible.

For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time!  Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance.  Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",1200355200,,1925,4.928792569659443

2916543,2,B000U1ZV26,"We have several of the Baby Einstein DVD's and all of them keep my 5 mos old son entranced for the length of the DVD.  I only use them on the fussy days when I just need a break.  Figured this one might be good to calm him and keep him briefly occupied.  Brief it is.  He is bored within 5 minutes.  Played it the whole way through several times and each time he starts to cry and turn away w/i a short time.  Pop in another one and he is fine.  When I watched it...it is soothing, but does not have the other animations, movement that the others have and I think he is bored.  thankfully it was a gift!",1199404800,6,603,3.925619834710744
