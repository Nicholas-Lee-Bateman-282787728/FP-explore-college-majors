8273648,5,B0019DD9VO,"I lived through (and took part in) the student activism and ""alternative culture"" of the 1960s and the dawn of the 1970s as a student myself (at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, in the same urban centre where actor Mark Frechette carried out his activism during that decade, and at the all-too-explosively alive Kent State University). I remember how we despised the acrid and shallow materialism of the prevailing culture of the U. S. of A. and how we longed to see it all blow up in the faces of that nation''s besotted leaders and of the easily deluded citzenry that kept on (and continues) voting them into office. That has happened, at last, with the implosion of the U.S. economy in the first decade of the 21st Century. It is a pity that this collapse, that makes an arrogant nation seethe with poverty and frustration thus doomed soon to powerlessness, did not occur sooner. Such timing would have limited the toll of victims of American power and greed to between the time of the film, 1970, and that of an earlier financial and militarily agonised doom.

Daria, seething with resentment for Mark's needless death (although his carelessness certainly brought it upon him), fantasises that the very symbol of the bourgeois fatuity of American callousness and vulgarity, i.e., the garishly opulent corporate facility (and/or mansion) set high in the desert surface, with joltingly sudden violent force explodes to smithereens (with visions of explosions of urban artificialty of many additional sorts added to this). That creates a breathtaking vision of justice come to a besotted and unworthy American culture of excess and greed.

I like the natural touch of the two leading actors using their real first names for their roles. Mark and Daria are the only truly natural humans in the film, doing what comes naturally to them, too, even if by thoughtless whimsy (e.g., Mark's theft of the aeroplane) at times, as well as by following their feelings to moving expression of what they experience at every moment, leads them, unafraid, to such natural sexuality and joyous revelry in each other, amidst the artificial constructs throughout the film, from which they stand aloof, of crazed student ideological excess, ruthless law enforcement, business and corporate cupidity, and so forth. Some of this may be nave, and doubtlessly is, but it is such a relief to find these two young adults in this film who do not fall into the ""cookie-cutter"" patterns of American popular and corporate culture.

Alas, Mark in the film dies for daring what he does, from an insistence on following his impulses (for better and for worse) in unfettered freedom, which his society quickly crushes brutally and without immediate sufficient cause (i.e., for him having ""borrowed"" without permission the aeroplane which he is returning). Mark Frechette himself, whose performance in the role is so edgily convincing (and who was the gay lover of American-Qubcois writer, Robert Dle, also a young hippie during those years, before Antonioni filmed ""Zabriskie Point"", Dle having departed by then to live in Qubec) was a true counter-cultural rebel who lived out his convictions (none too wisely, but very intensely) and who died all too young for living out what he believed. As someone who was as radical and impulsive as the character Mark in the film, Mark Frechette, the handsome young actor whose career and very life ended so prematurely, was a real-life parallel (apart from the matter of Frechette's gay sexuality) in important aspects to what and whom he portrayed in this movie in which he appeared.

This is a wonderful film, redolent (of course!) of its era, but surprisingly relevant for the decades to follow and for present times of so much accumulated bitterness and of justice that too long has been delayed. A mere account of the film's action simply cannot convey the richness and untrammeled irony of what Antonioni accomplished thereby in this masterpiece of cinema.

I wish that the DVD edition that I acquired (or any other one) had included supplementary material and an appreciation of what Antonioni accomplished (but only if it were well done and worthy of him) but I also am simply pleased that this DVD is available at all, being a film, as it is, which does not flinch from judging the crassest kind of modernity that Southern California, Arizona, and the U. S. of A. as a whole, embody and have to represent to the entire world.",1428710400,,4453,4.963806970509383

8273650,5,B0019DD9VO,"Director Michelangelo Antonioni's ZABRISKIE POINT is a masterpiece of pure cinema that somehow seems lost to those that despised it as well as to those that embraced it back in 1970. Mark (Mark Frechette) the iconoclast hero is disenchanted with the discussion of college students that we see him congregate with inside a lecture hall somewhere in Los Angeles. The students discuss peace and peace activism conducted and achieved through acts of civil disobedience. Apparently they can't reach a consensus on what means they will use to achieve their end. Convinced they are not willing to take the most extreme of all actions and tired of their rhetoric Mark leaves, buys a gun, nearly kills a cop and impulsively steels an airplane leading him off into the desert. . Simultaneously, we see Daria (Daria Halprin) a very young secretary to land developer Lee Allen (Rod Taylor) decidedly skipping a workday and driving off into the desert in her old Buick. Eventually their paths cross in the desert and they stop their flight at the crest of the Zabriskie Point overlook. For me viewing this film I don't necessarily see the contrast between an American society so decadent, self-centered and materialistic when compared to the two protagonists Mark and Daria. They are unaware that the very thing they are trying to escape, they are in fact part of or even symptomatic of. They look into the barren terrain of the desert and see a beautiful landscape. Yet when they make naked love they are consumed and covered in sand and dust which is symbolically the resulting fruit to the consummation of the act. They are from dust. Their result shall be dust. When Daria first drove into the desert she stopped at a roadside bar frequented by a man long past his physical prime and lost in a singular moment of youthful triumph. Outside the roadside bar Daria found a group of young boys, much younger than her, who equally were lost in their youthful retrogression and idleness. There is no growth in this film for any of its characters, only stagnation. There is no real emergence of a counterculture or any notion of such in this film. There is only the singular culture of man and the limitations of man when compared to the immense and vast majesty, beauty and beguilement of nature. Cinematographer Alfio Contini's color images capture this so vividly. Even the script is more revealing than it appears. We still get the cliched version of a Los Angeles police force. But the business establishment represented by land developer Lee Allen (Rod Taylor) is also seen to be at odds when selling his idealized project. We don't specifically see it, but we get the notion that he is trying to sell a housing project that will incorporate itself into the landscape and become one-with-nature. We see the home that developer Allen has created for himself, a beautiful domicile in the desert, which at first glance seems to go in tandem with this notion of co-existing with nature. But this too can not be in such a vision that Antonioni has created. Equally along the way Mark's fate has prophetically been sealed. Daria's final apocalyptic vision is that of director Antonioni's. No matter what culture man establishes there can never be true harmony. The only true harmony is nature unto itself.",1421452800,,3289,4.854092526690391
8273651,1,B0019DD9VO,"This film is a masterpiece and a classic. However, do NOT buy this DVD. It starts off ok in widescreen format just to display the credits and then is reduced to TV format cropping off the image. There is no choice of format available. This is an abomination. Most people who wish to view this film love artistic cinema and considering the effort Antonioni put into composing every frame makes this hatchet job particularly shameful. Obviously, this German DVD company are a bunch of mediocre philistines given their treatment of such a beautiful film. Boycott their products. These guys are anti-cinema.",1227225600,4,603,4.98019801980198
