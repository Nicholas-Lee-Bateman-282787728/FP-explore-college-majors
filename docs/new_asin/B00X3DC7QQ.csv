8714894,5,B00X3DC7QQ,"This flick is real buried treasure.  The twists and turns of this noir-like exercise are so engrossing that it's not until it's over that you appreciate how well crafted this film is.  The writing is terrific giving dimension and ambiguity to characters and situations that you're not sure who the good guys and the bad guys are which would include our nominal protagonist, Interpol agent Sol Madrid (David McCallum).  Impeccably cast there's not a single false note among the performances.  If one were to give a special shout out one would cite Telly Savalas as the genteel drug dealer, Rip Torn as the sadistic mob boss, Stella Stevens as Torn's disloyal mistress, and Ricardo Montalban as a narcotics cop.  The confrontation between McCallum and Montalban alone is worth the price of admission.  McCallum wisely plays it straight to the vest allowing his talented co-stars to flourish enhancing his own performance in the process.  ""Sol Madrid"" is the type of film the term sleeper was created for.",1439596800,3,1002,5.0
8714895,4,B00X3DC7QQ,"I did not expect to like ""Sol Madrid"" as much as I did.  Usually when Telly Savalas is in the cast, I feel Hollywood overstepping its line, although I should take that back after seeing the original cut of Mario Bava's ""Lisa and the Devil"" and see Telly perfectly cast.  ""Sol Madrid"" offers a lot of actors that were probably on contract to MGM like Rip Torn, Riccardo Montalban and Pat Hingle, and all, especially Montalban are very good.  Stella Stevens is cast also and if very effective and an asset as she was in 1965's ""Synanon.""  David McCallum has the title role.  I am not sure of the details of when ""Sol Madrid"" was made and released, as it is questionable that it was not released right after it was made and this may have been a blunder by MGM.  This was made around 1968 after ""Three Bites of the Apple"" his first starring role in 1967 after his success in ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.."".  In 1969 he made the film ""The Ravine"" for director Paolo Cavara (""Plot of Fear"") that was an anti-war WWII film, again very different.  The Warner Archive release of ""Sol Madrid"" recently is the home video premiere and comes with a trailer and has some faulty fading of colors but is very good considering the film was definitely miscalculated and is otherwise very good considering the age of the film.  Brian G. Hutton (""Where Eagles Dare"") did an admirable job of directing, the film continually stepping out of what could very well have fallen into clich&eacute;.  David McCallum wisely underplays his role in fashion of Clint Eastwood at the time.  The screenplay by David Karp is based on the book, ""The Fruit of the Poppy"" by Robert Wilder concerns drugs in Mexico and mob connections.  Despite reviews to the contrary, I think the time is ripe for ""Sol Madrid.""",1436659200,8,1769,4.580952380952381
8714896,4,B00X3DC7QQ,"""Sol Madrid"" is an edgy late 60's movie that still has relevance. Interesting characterizations with a great cast: Montalban, Torn, Savalas and Stevens. As for McCallum, after the ""wussification"" of Illya in ""The Man from UNCLE"", it was darned refreshing to see him portray a bad, good Interpol cop with cajones.",1436486400,,312,5.137254901960785
8714897,5,B00X3DC7QQ,"It's interesting to have the chance to watch an old movie of this kind, as dry as a direct speech, with a perfect balance of work among all the acting staff, and probably the crew behind. Worth to have it as a sort of documentary of some big problems that affect our society. I missed it when it was in theatres at its times. Probably because I was too young to be allowed. I think it hasn't lost an inch of its original impact. A good movie under every point of view.",1433980800,5,468,4.0978260869565215
8714898,4,B00X3DC7QQ,"I disagree with the other reviewer here. I thought this was a pretty good mob flick mainly due to the actors involved. David McCallum,Telly Savalas and Rip Torn always turn in good performances, Stella Stevens, in her beautiful prime, proves she's equally good in both drama and comedy. Plot is typical 60's, but fun nevertheless. Movie buffs will like it, today's standards won't.",1433289600,6,381,5.063492063492063
8714899,2,B00X3DC7QQ,"Ok crime drama, not particularly well-acted.",1433203200,,44,6.5
