8588228,5,B00D0JL1ZQ,"Big surprise from Tony Robbins - You get the inside of the life and systems of some incredible guys who succeeded ""From Zero to Hero"". Most of them read and followed, in their early years, Tony's books/audio books, and now are somehow presenting their graduation project (read projects because these guys are incredible good). I just saw Tony's ""Breakthrough"" 6 movie series (ASIN: B004HGDY5G) which is somehow related but with a different perspective. One is how do you start people that are ""lower than a pond scum"" and give them back to their families and society, the other is about people that want to reach their full infinite potential. This reminds me of the Josh Brolin's ""More (Everybody Has a Number)""  from ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"". I heard a joke 20 yeas ago about this ""How do you prepare Cassius Clay (Muhammad Ali) to become the best boxing guy ? - Answer: You teach him not to hit with his legs and his head :-) "" - Thank you Tony !!",1464307200,,959,4.575581395348837
