The scenery is gorgeous and peaceful. the bald eagles and other wildlife are wonderful. As I love snow the falling flakes are my favorites but what pulls it all together is the classical music, Tchaikovsky's the Nutcracker, Vivaldi's winter suite, Bach's Sinfonia in G, etc. Do so wish they would reissue it on DVD",1451692800,,440,4.7272727272727275
