8552962,1,B00AK51POK,"On the surface, impressive.  On consideration:  a stupid set-up, to make a plot.  Their ""specialists"" get to Egypt, and go to a few sites and museums to learn something.  They then have a timed project.  If you like reality shows, you might like this.  Otherwise, an embarrassing and irritating waste of time and money.",1378771200,2,319,4.814814814814815

Even non-horse loving people would find this documentary extremely interesting and educational.  Keeps one's interest from beginning to end.  Recommending this documentary to everyone I know, even non-horse loving people.",1374105600,4,335,6.0638297872340425
