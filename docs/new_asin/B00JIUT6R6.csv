6358945,5,B00JIUT6R6,"This is an interesting movie that could also be a 4 man (3 men, 1 woman) play. A businessman (Craig Conway) hires a detective (Sean Pertwee) to kidnap his wife's lover (Martin Compston) and bring him to the proverbial warehouse so he can rough him up.

He also kidnaps his wife (Kierston Wareing) for good measure. The movie then takes a number of twists as the four interact. Who is really in charge?

Good acting. Good dialogue.
