8183501,5,B000O76ZP8,"Very entertaining and relevant series following pastor Jay Bakker during an intense period of transition in his life and ministry. Watching his mother's health deteriorate while making a major decision regarding his church's stance on LGBT issues, this series is raw and often intense. Perfect for small group discussion or personal exploration/enjoyment.",1388880000,2,355,5.846153846153846
8183502,5,B000O76ZP8,"This is an amazing video and whether you are a conservative christian, not a christian or a radical person here to serve the lord and question everything you have been taught and you are out to change the status quo of the Christian movement, this DVD is a must see. Jay Bakker is a rebel and a prophet (even though he would never use the word prophet to describe himself). He is humble and wise and a revolutionary in this world. This is a DVD that I treasure in my collection and love.",1349740800,5,487,4.247311827956989
8183503,5,B000O76ZP8,"I can so relate w/this guy and ALL the rejection he is ongoingly dealing with seemingly through out his WHOLE life, and definately still as you can see from watching this.. But I think evevn if you can't I think ANYONE can enjoy and appreciate the realness, and heartfelt-ness of this movie. I'm not a cry but man, the stuff that he's ongoingly going through w/his dad made me tear up. And the love of his mother just touched me man.. I'm a big dude, side-burns and all. But watchin' this stuff takes you through emotions you may have laid dormant for years. I think it show be a must see.. And if another series comes out I would buy it even before watching it. I'm dying to know what's been going on since this series aired..",1280102400,12,727,4.313868613138686
8183504,5,B000O76ZP8,"This DVD made me laugh. This DVD made me cry. Jay has a beautiful spirit. He represents  some of the true fruits of the Spirit. I believe that all his labor of love is not in vain. He denied true fame to do what he believes is right. He teaches the gospel where many would have turned their backs and walked away. His pulpit is a chair in a bar. He teaches those who have been turned away for being ""different"",or ""undesirable"" for many of the mainstream churches that closes their eyes and doors to such people.

  Buy this DVD and share it with all of your friends and family. I know that they will be touched. Minds will change. Hearts will open!",1204156800,14,649,4.252032520325203
8183505,5,B000O76ZP8,"I was a little apprehensive about this show, but after watching it and owning the dvd, I can truly appreciate Jay Bakker and the whole bakker family a lot more. People are so quick to judge, and Jay Bakker breaks through walls and barriers that have been set up by the religious right and has given the message of hope and peace from Christianity that seems to be lacking from traditional methods. Sincerity over bashing people in the head has gone a long way through this dvd and is a worthwhile show to watch, regardless of your faith.",1197763200,13,537,4.489795918367347
