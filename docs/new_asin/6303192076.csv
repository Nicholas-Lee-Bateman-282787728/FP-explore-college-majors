7840494,5,6303192076,"The best documentary (done in a movie form) about high school football programs that I have ever seen.
Takes you into the locker rooms , the community and the players home. I loved it.",1395619200,,184,4.4411764705882355
7840495,5,6303192076,My kids grew up on this Had to find the videos for her so she can relive her child hood,1374969600,,87,3.4
7840496,5,6303192076,"This is one of the most emotionally uplifting yet sad docus ive ever seen. So much heart displayed. It brought back memories of my years attending a then-poorly funded high school in southern Maine (though i was not native to Maine). Look up a tragic story about my school, where in (I forget exactly what year - 15 years or so ago) 5 former HS players committed suicide within a very few years after football ended for them. They could not replicate the glory of their gridiron years and found deadend jobs and other problems to be too much to bear. Though these boys graduated years after me, news of these fellow alumni's fates were hearbreaking to me. The school: Winthrop HS, near Augusta, Maine's capitol.",1374624000,,711,4.650793650793651
7840497,4,6303192076,We bought this for our son-in-law who is a new football coach.  We had previously watched this and were impressed with the coaching -- definitely two different techniques.  I believe one was much better.  It's the story of two teams in two different parts of Maine meeting on the football field.  We were impressed enough to buy it as a gift.,1364169600,,342,4.557377049180328
7840498,5,6303192076,"This documentary gives you a good inside look on the different backgrounds high school football can have. How much a community lives for the football season and how priviliged and unpriviliged kids get their pride from being successfull on the football field. And it is not always about which team has the most financial refunds. A good coach and the right attitude can't be bought. When you see it, you're gonna love it.",1360886400,,421,4.780821917808219
7840499,5,6303192076,"The video is an excellent true documentary.  A true documentation closely related to Remember the Titans.  Whether you are a sports fan or not the story passes on a powerful message of hard work, dedication and humanity.",1351296000,,220,4.918918918918919
7840500,5,6303192076,"For anyone interested in high school sports and the competitive nature of football this is a must see. Well written, directed and produced. I was fortunate enough to be invited to the Premier in Waterville in a turn of the century hall. Since I personally know one of the producers I admit to being slightly prejudiced :-)  Give it a try!!!  Bev D., Oxford, MA",1332979200,,360,4.523076923076923
7840501,4,6303192076,The video was very good.  I found it very interesting and well put together.  It was a great depiction between two very different communities and the football rivalry that was formed over a short period of time.,1328054400,,211,4.675675675675675
7840502,5,6303192076,"THIS FILM IS A COMING-OF-AGE MUST SEE FOR ANYONE INVOLVED IN ANY TYPE OF SPORTING COMPETITION. IT IS SO WELL DONE, HOLLYWOOD COULDN'T HAVE WRITTEN A BETTER SCRIPT. ALTHOUGH NO PROFESSIONAL ACTORS ARE INVOLVED, THE CAST OF CHARACTERS ARE TRULY INSPIRATIONAL. IT EVOLVES FROM THE FIERCE RIVALRY OF TWO OPPOSING HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAMS WHO ARE SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY SEPARATED EXCEPT WHEN THEY MEET ON THE GRIDIRON INTO A PERSONAL STORY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL NOT ACCEPT DEFEAT AND WHO HAVE MATURED SO MUCH BECAUSE OF THIS FIERCE COMPETITION. ONE CANNOT HELP BUT TAKE SIDES FROM THE BEGINNING AND I WAS SO HOPING THAT THE LESS FORTUNATE WOULD PREVAIL. I WILL NOT TELL YOU THE OUTCOME BUT I WILL LET YOU KNOW I WAS AMAZED THAT BY THE END OF THE FILM I REALIZED THERE WERE NO GOOD 0R BAD GUYS IN THIS ONE, THEY WERE ALL WINNERS. THE LEVEL OF THE COMPETITION ALONG WITH A TRULY PERSONAL NARRATIVE HAS MADE THIS MY FAVORITE SPORTS MOVIE.",1322784000,3,937,4.650602409638554
7840503,5,6303192076,"This film is a wonderful documentary using high school football as the backdrop for a showdown between blue collar student athletes versus white collar student athletes while highlighting societal pressures on both.  This is ""reality TV"" as we peek in on 15 to 18 year-olds struggling with high school and dreaming about their futures.  Which of the rival towns are you rooting for...in the end, it may be both.",1294876800,3,411,4.942028985507246
