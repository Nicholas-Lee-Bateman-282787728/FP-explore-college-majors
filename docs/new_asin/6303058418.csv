7835929,4,6303058418,This is a charming way to look at the mythology story Pegasus- I really enjoyed it-- though it was a sad story-- it was verry good! and Mia Farrow  has a wonderful singing and talking voice. The animation is simply  beautiful- and the story line is captivating! I reccomend!,969062400,7,274,4.571428571428571
