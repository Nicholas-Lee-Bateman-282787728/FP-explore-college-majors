8078549,1,B00062J0G2,A tv series that aired in Britain and should have stayed there. Troma comedy at it's worst To call it crap is an insult to crap,1398729600,,127,3.923076923076923
8078550,5,B00062J0G2,"Troma's Edge TV is perfect for Troma fans. Each episode is a nice, quick-paced cheap looking bit of fun with plenty of Tromettes and other tro-goodness. Lots of great clips from the Troma movies where...well...the part the movie has in Troma's Edge TV is probably one of the best parts of the whole movie.

But at each episode being 20 minutes long; you'll watch the whole DVD in one sitting and love every minute. Great for people with ADD, and a great way to buy Troma without having to take a chance at the hit & miss titles that Troma distributes. (Everything that Lloyd directs is gold, though...)",1262563200,,602,4.574074074074074
