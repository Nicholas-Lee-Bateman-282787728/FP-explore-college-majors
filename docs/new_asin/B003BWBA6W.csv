8394051,2,B003BWBA6W,I  thought that he seemed to be drunk. The band seemed a bit brought down and concerned. But outside of that I didn't like his material.,1459555200,,136,4.230769230769231

8394053,5,B003BWBA6W,"This is the greatest concert DVD I have ever seen.  Both concerts are absolutely amazing. John Cale just might be the greatest performer in history, at least the most interesting.  This man gives each and every song he sings life.  His emotions are dumped onto the audience and it is brilliant.  You can hear a restrained insanity and paranoia in each song trying to show its way out and sometimes it comes out completely like in Fear and Guts.  The one concert is John Cale alone.  It is so good I watch it at least once a month.  The other concert is John Cale with band.  The guitars are heavy and you can hear a post-punk like sound from a lot of the material.  Frenetic guitar and such.  This show is the one that most of you reading this review are looking for.  It's the concert where John Cale seems to completely lose it and tear up some carpet tiles from the stage and begins to sing or shall I say scream Heartbreak Hotel with no instrumentation and then proceeds to break down at the piano.  This concert has so much interesting history (John Cale in general has so much interesting history).  I won't describe it, but I do suggest to look it up if you don't know it.  All in all the picture quality is great for being from the 80's and the sound is great as well.  Definitely helps to have a good sound system with your tv obviously. The DVD packaging is decent, I'd like to see a Blu-Ray release.
John Cale is not everyone's cup of tea, even though he really should be, I mean the man is a genius.  There is not enough good things I can say about John Cale or this DVD for that matter, so I shall stop now.",1457222400,3,1620,4.228013029315961
8394054,5,B003BWBA6W,"The amazing John Cale at his 'raw' and best. A powerful and intimidating show unleashing all his power with a fabulous backing band. There aren't many DVD/video footage of his live concerts, apart from The Velvet Underground . He and the band rips. A real blast to have the bonus of the solo acoustic show as well. I highly recommend this gem of a DVD..",1433980800,2,353,4.446153846153846
8394055,5,B003BWBA6W,"You could not find a better representation of the man as an artist than these two discs from the heart of his most prolific period stetching into the mid-eighties.  The two concerts presented, a year apart, one with a band and one with him alone on stage with a guitar and a piano, are equally passionate and it is a credit to the sturdiness of the songs that they sound poignant and driven in either case.  The band gives him the freedom to come nearly unhinged in his delivery as they keep the beat while being solo on stage allows him to speak to the audience between songs, introducing each song, the setting more intimate in nature.  Many songs are repeated from disc to disc- his classics such as ""Paris 1919"", ""Close Watch"", ""Fear is a Man's Best Friend"", ""Leaving It All Up To You""-but are delivered with different spins, and there are several songs that aren't, making each show distinct.  Like John Lennon, he knows the value of a well-placed primal scream and you begin to fear for his voice, the performances so heartfelt and visceral.  This is a man not giving 110%, but giving you 1,000%, all but leaving his lungs bloody on the stage.",1404345600,5,1149,4.531400966183575
8394056,5,B003BWBA6W,"This is quite the DVD release and it comes at a time when there is practically no Cale music from this period in print. John Cale's early 80's work is woefully under represented. I believe the albums Caribbean Sunset and John Cale Comes Alive never made it onto compact discs (definitely not in North America). This may be because Cale was no longer on Island and while work on that label has been readily available for purchase, even that material is out of print at the moment. But now we have this collection which is also out as a double CD set.

The music from this period comes around the time of Cale's quietly disconcerting Music For A New Society and Caribbean Sunset which songs are featured prominently on the John Cale and Band 1984 performance. Devoted fans of Cale know what to expect from the first DVD because it is basically the same type of show Fragments of A Rainy Season is. Cale is alone with his piano, guitar and his music. The song selection is much more interesting here because it includes excellent live versions of Vintage Violence's Ghost Story and Amsterdam. Other selections, Heartbreak Hotel, Cable Hogue Close Watch, Guts, Buffalo Ballet, Child's Christmas in Wales and Ship of Fools are songs Cale did solo in the 1992 Fragments of  Rainy Season release. If anything, the versions included here have a little more of an edge to them. The concert is intimate but there is an undercurrent of electricity included. This energy may be remnants of what I experienced watching the second DVD which I saw first.

The second DVD captures The John Cale Band live at Rockpalast at 3am on October 14th 1984. I mention the time because the concert does have a raucous late night feel to it. The songs range from love songs, songs of lust, loneliness and songs of war. Much of Cale's new rock material during this period centered around international conflicts.

The show begins with Autobiography which lives up to its name and segues into Oh La La. Show moves to Evidence which was first featured on Sabotage. Then continues with the excellent Magazines and Model Beirut Recital, both from Caribbean Sunset. Streets of Laredo is a solo performance with Cale on Electric Guitar. Dr. Mudd, also from Sabotage sparks up the show and continues with a borderline insane performance of Leaving It Up To You. Caribbean Sunset is a quieter song which sounds like it was a Music For A New Society outtake which Cale ended up recording with the band. The Hunt, also from Caribbean Sunset is a good driving rock number. Fear is Man's Best Friend is every bit as borderline as Leaving It Up To You. The booklet talks about how these songs are direct and come straight to the point which is true, they do. Cale seems to focus heavily on the emotional aspect born from the lyrics in each of these songs and no where is this more obvious than the 4 minute version of Heartbreak Hotel which starts with sparse piano hinting at the melody then degenerates into Cale falling on the floor then hiding his head from the audience as though to protect himself from their seeing the loneliness he sings about in the song. That is the work of deconstructionist with a flare for the dramatic. The emotional aspect of the song isn't superficially performed it is lived via the performance. Won't see anything quite like that again. Show carries on with the band performing a strong version of Paris 1919 (the lightest of the songs) then moves into a particularly intense version of Waiting For the Man. This version begins as a faithful rendition of a VU song but it moves to an entirely different level toward the end which you will not expect when you hear it. A 9 minute version of Mercenaries, a cover of the Modern Lovers Pablo Picasso (which segues into The Doors, Love Me Two Times and a quiet solo version of Close Watch on piano to end the show. Definitely worth seeing.

The DVD also includes a bizarre preshow interview. The interviewer mistakes the drummer David Lichtenstein for John Cale. Though Lichtenstein corrects the interviewer, the guy asks the questions without pause.

This release filled a gap for me personally because Cale's music from this period simply never saw the light of day here in the US. This is also, I believe, the only performance of Cale with his then band ever captured on video. Worth the cost of admission and yes, these do work on North American DVD players. I believe they are in NTSC region 0 which makes them universally compatible.",1386374400,5,4477,4.675126903553299
8394057,5,B003BWBA6W,"Jackie Leven's music is among the most interesting music available. He has a wonderful voice, a great sense of poetry and intriguing sense of musical adventure. The DVD is an excellent start to hear the music stripped down.  Jackie's song ""A Little Voice in Space"" is truly amazing on the ""Shining Brother Shining Sister"" album, and here the song is even more beautiful in its simplicity.  Jackie recently died. Therefore, I am glad to have the DVD, since I'll never get to see him perform in person.  I recommend all of his music to anyone who likes poetry and good music.  Start with ""The Mystery of Life is Greater than the Mystery of Death.""",1328313600,,645,4.631578947368421
8394058,5,B003BWBA6W,"This is a terrific DVD set of 2 John Cale shows from 1983 & 1984 - one is a solo-format show, the other is full electric band show (which was legendary for his, uh, amped-up performance).  I'm providing the link below, to the audio-only-CD version of the set (which is also available), which will give you a sense of contents/quality, etc (tracks are pretty much identical).  As for the video quality, I've owned these shows for years as bootlegs, and the quality here is much better than what I've got and have seen floating around, so if you own them already on boot, the upgrade is worth it.  If you don't already have this, and are a Cale enthusiast, then pick this set up for sure as the full-band show is pretty raucous, with a good young backing band, and this is pretty much some of the last stuff from his primo-period before he took a bit of a break around the mid-80's (prior to his reemergence with the ""Drella"", ""Songs for the Dying"" and Eno projects).  Overall video quality is very good, subject to some technical limitations of video from the original source - these were originally shot for television broadcast.
