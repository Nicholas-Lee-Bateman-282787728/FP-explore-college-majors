7800836,5,1881133125,The english subtext will not match up with the ASL story because ASL has its own grammatical structure.  It would be the same with any other language.  I watched this for my Deaf Literature class and I found it very fun and exciting if you are learning ASL and about the Deaf culture.,1335312000,,284,4.339622641509434
7800837,3,1881133125,"Same as the other volume I reviewed: the English interpreting doesn't line up with the signing, so my kids could not learn any ASL from this tape.",1223856000,,146,4.444444444444445
7800838,4,1881133125,"The voice over is well spoken and fun, and the ASL story tellers are wonderfully entertaining (Lou Fant, Freda Norman, Pat Graybill, Mary Beth Miller).  The entire story is told by each of these storytellers on a stage decorated with colorful ladders.
The reason my rating lacks a star is that the second Cinderella story makes people who use cued speech seem awful.  It promotes a prejudiced opinion that people who know cued speech (can lipread with a little signed help) are stuck-up and mean.
For those of you looking for videos to help you learn ASL or help your child learn, the signing is faster than most ""learn this"" type videos, and the speech doesn't match up closely with the signs (example: if you are looking at the sign when they say the word ""rabbit"" you are not going to see that word, it will be a different part of the story).
However, if you already know some sign and want to see the sentence structure, this is perfect.",1075161600,11,941,4.529411764705882
