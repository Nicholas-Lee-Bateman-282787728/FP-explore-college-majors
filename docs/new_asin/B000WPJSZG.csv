8224988,5,B000WPJSZG,"Love seeing Annie Oakley again. Since my name is Anne, I probably love it more than most, but I am also a horse lover. I have had horses all my life and love all the westerns with a lot of horse riding in them. Annie Oakley has been perfect for this. Besides growing up with these shows. I am not sure I have ever seen all of them so now I have. They are fantastic to own and watch. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",1416528000,,427,3.9767441860465116

8224991,3,B000WPJSZG,"I absolutely love old western TV shows, but I am giving this set only 3 stars because they say ""Volumes 1-5"" and that is not what I got.
Volumes 1-1-3-4-5 is what was sent to me. There wasn't a volume two and some of the volumes had the same shows as Volume one! Very disappointing :(
Other than that, the shows are excellent :)

If I was going to buy them again - I wouldn't buy them from this dealer or from Amazon period.",1392854400,,424,4.0476190476190474
8224992,5,B000WPJSZG,"I'm the first to admit it, the plot lines of this show are relatively easy to figure out.  In every episode there is inevitably a chase, a fistfight, and someone getting bonked on the head.  But Annie Oakley rescues the day with her expert marksmanship, usually figuring out how to shoot the gun out of the bad guy's hand rather than shooting at the person himself, and we are all left with the feeling that things can be well with the world.  As far as actually being a portrayal of Annie Oakley's life, forget it, there is absolutely nothing biographical in this series.  But with its setting in the Wild West in the small town called ""Diablo"", Annie and the Deputy, Lofty, and her younger brother, Tagg manage to keep the bad guy's at bay and help out the ranchers in the area.  The sound quality could be better, I find myself having to turn the volume up rather high with this cd set.  But it doesn't detract from the just plain likeable quality of the show.  This show is excellent for family viewing and even just plain light-hearted viewing among the grown up set who can still enjoy a simple good time.  The show was filmed during the early fifties, but it is set during the 1890s I believe.  The historical accuracy of it is questionable, but the enjoyableness of it is undeniable.  I rate it a five out of five!",1360195200,2,1322,4.425619834710743
8224993,3,B000WPJSZG,i purchased these movies to tease my wife. But we've both watched them commenting on how much we enjoyed them in our youth. Today's youth might find them a little lame with the other fair on TV,1354838400,,193,4.243243243243243
8224994,5,B000WPJSZG,"Great fun for a seven year old! Kind of politically correct (stars a woman), kind of politically incorrect (gratuitous shootings), but, hey, we can't be too sensitive here. Just so much fun!",1307750400,2,190,4.96875
8224995,4,B000WPJSZG,"These DVDs were a welcome addition to my collection of Annie Oakley short shows. My grandchildren and I love these shows when we are boondock camping in our RV at the ranch. They are good, clean entertainment and the children get to appreciate wholesome, old movies, where there were no digital enhancements in the days these were made. It was all done with skill of actors, stunt people and camera crews. Amazing work that needs to be appreciated today.",1296086400,7,454,4.7594936708860756
