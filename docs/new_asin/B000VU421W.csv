8351942,5,B000VU421W,"I must be honest.....I haven't seen this yet.  But...my son is in this movie, so I just want everyone to know that they HAVE TO SEE IT!  Johnny Thunder and Italian Ice rule!",1190246400,,173,4.212121212121212
8351943,5,B000VU421W,"This movie is a hilarious independant screwball comedy, akin to those of the late '70s and '80s.  It's a great homage to the films of that period, with also a touch of Family Guy humor.  The guy who plays the cop is excellent, he had me pissing my pants. Who is this mysterious Ben Stiller wannabe?  Check it out, and you'll see what I mean.",1189900800,,341,4.2153846153846155
