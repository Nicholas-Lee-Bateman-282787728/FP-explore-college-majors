5053632,5,B0073XHGWW,"When I first heard about God Save My Shoes, I was incredibly excited to see a documentary that focuses on why women love shoes. Maybe I was hoping to answer some questions about myself... However, the film never came to London, but it is now available on DVD. Caid Productions, the people behind the film, were nice enough to send me a copy for my very own personal edification.

The documentary, directed by Julie Benasra, explores the deep relationship women have with their shoes and features interviews with celebrities and designer cobblers alike. There were some very interesting theories and arguments presented, including one that compares wearing modern heels to Chinese foot binding. (Well, I think that comparison is a bit drastic. After all, you can just take the shoe off at will.)...

5053633,5,B0073XHGWW,"When I first heard about this documentary last Summer (2011), I was excited to say the least. Like many women out there my love for  shoes goes beyond more than I can say, so of course I would want to check out a documentary which focused on the relationship women have with their shoes. Luckily, I scored an opportunity to when I checked it out during the theatrical premiere in March.

Overall, God Save My Shoes documents the point of view of shoe-cession from the minds of the women who wear them and the designers who create them. The ever evolving industry of shoes from the renaissance to modern day and the fascination with ""the higher the heel the better"" are prominent parts of the documentary in addition to interviews with renowned designers Christian Louboutin & Manolo Blahnik, singer Kelly Rowland, Vogue veteran Filipa Fino 'and more.

Needless to say, I personally enjoyed the documentary and shared the same feelings of the women who were interviewed. If you are a shoe lover, as I am, you will certainly see apart of yourself in this film. It's worth checking out with your favorite girls you're sole-fully connected with.",1337040000,4,1141,4.781725888324873
5053634,5,B0073XHGWW,"For the past six years as a shoe blogger, I have been answering the same question by the perplexed  (i.e. men): ""What's up with women and shoes?"".  It can be best summed up this way: shoes are to women what horsepower is to men. But the difference is that our shoes are displayed on our feet instead of in the garage...

I was honored to receive an early screening copy of God Save My Shoes.  All I can say is that any woman worth her Choos will want to add this documentary to her movie collection.  It is the perfect cinematic backdrop for a Girl's Night In (think pedicure party, where Stiletto Cocktails and shoe-shaped cookies are on the menu).

God Save My Shoes chronicles how women's love affair with shoes continues to be an evolution of expression. From shoe fanatics to fetishists, chopines to six-inch skyscraper heels, heels are a sign of status, power and intrigue.

So the next time someone asks you what you drive, tell them nothing less than a 130mm stiletto.  With hardware.",1336953600,3,992,4.564971751412429
8509521,5,B0073XHGWW,"My sexiest shoes still fit me, even when my sexiest jeans were too tight to zip up. I never had to eat nothing but salad to fit into my hottest, most stylish shoes. They're beautiful. They are like a sculpture made out of leather. They transform my posture, make my legs seem longer and make the same black dress look like something brand new, What more could you want?

God Save My Shoes tells you everything you might want to know about the legend and the lure of femininity and womanhood that can be purchased at a shoe store. If you want to know why you sometimes feel that there's never enough in your closet, it's all explained here.",1521590400,,639,4.369747899159663

8509527,3,B0073XHGWW,"Women simply put greater effort into appearance than men do, so why stop at the ankles?  But as the 2011 documentary GOD SAVE MY SHOES tells it, what ladies wear on their feet means as much as if not than clothing and cosmetics, according to testimonials by vocalists from Destiny's Child and the Black Eyed Peas, a famous burlesque dancer, and others interviewed.  Visitors from another planet who see this movie may think every Earth female obsesses on footwear but those of us aware of the impoverished would like to know how much working class gals spend or even think about it.  GOD SAVE MY SHOES also skirts the question of the effects on health high heels can have.

While noting the influence of television show SEX AND THE CITY on women's fashion, to my surprise GOD SAVE MY SHOES does not touch on the episode where one of the characters realizes the amount she's spent on shoes is enough for a down payment on a home.  The documentary also misses Imelda Marcos' shoe collection, but maybe the filmmakers are too young to remember that.  And there's no mention of pedicures, one side topic I expected considering nail salons seem to outnumber shoe stores.

While GOD SAVE MY SHOES could do more with its subject it does enough to hold your attention, with psychological and historical points of view accompanying the personal takes by Fergie and the others.",1371081600,,1367,4.718487394957983

8509530,3,B0073XHGWW,"Found it interesting to see all the shoe designers speaking of their craft and showing their beautiful shoes.

I'm too old for high heels now, but wore them in my younger working days in Manhattan and loved how beautiful they were and made
me feel.  Tall and glamorous.

Fun film but not worth the time or money.",1349481600,,312,4.43859649122807
