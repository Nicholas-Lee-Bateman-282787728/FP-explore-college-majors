Great show, superb video and audio quality on blu-ray
I bought the first three seasons on Blu-ray at Amazon.com because only the dvd's are available here in Holland.
I pre-ordered the fourth season  on blu-ray months ago, and now they canceled the blu-ray version, why?
I'm not buying the dvd version, I'm watching the other three seasons for the second time instead.
A lot of people are waiting for the blu-ray versions, I hope they release them soon!",1415232000,2,487,4.855421686746988

Why is season four only available on DVD? My wife and I have watched the first three seasons on Blu-Ray disc, and we are waiting for season four so we can HAPPILY GO AHEAD AND BUY IT, if it ever comes out on Blu-Ray. We don't watch TV. We just watch shows and movies we buy on Blu-Ray.

I see that it's available only on DVD, so WHAT'S GOING ON?

I'm not going to buy the inferior DVD version that has been available for more than a month now. I don't buy DVD's anymore. And I'm sure that other Blu-ray disc player owners, don't either.

UPDATE: Well, It's the first of December, and I still see that ""Hawaii Five-0: Season Four"" is still not available on Blu-Ray, although the DVD has been released months ago now. I don't know what they are waiting for but, I'll be damned if I'm going to go out and buy the DVD of this season.

HEY, GUESS WHAT. Season four of ""Hawaii Five-0"" on Blu-ray will be available in Germany on February 15th, 2015. So, if the US doesn't want to release the Blu-ray of Season Four, we can order it from overseas.

And yes.  It plays on my US Blu-ray player, so it is Region-Free! Hooray!",1414713600,13,1346,5.1422018348623855
8587658,5,B00CYQXEHE,Come cbs we the fans want a blu ray release of season 4. I did have this pre ordered since before the beginning of 2014,1414627200,4,119,3.8
8587659,5,B00CYQXEHE,"I also love this series.  I don't know why CBS has not released this season on blu ray - perhaps because the demand for the blu ray is not high enough and previous blu ray sales were not high?  The show was recorded in HD, so please release it in HD.  To watch the show on TV in beautiful HD and then to get a regular DVD of its release is like taking a step backward.  I won't buy the regular DVD, even though blu ray players upconvert, because I have all of this gear to watch HD shows.  Hopefully, CBS, will release it on blu ray, even if they don't make a whole lot of profit off of the blu ray version.",1414540800,5,607,3.902439024390244
8587660,1,B00CYQXEHE,"I am astonished to know that Amazon cancelled my pre ordered Blue Ray DVD of the fourth season of Hawaii 5-0.

Oh and all the footage of gorgeous Hawaii.",1374019200,15,128,3.9615384615384617
