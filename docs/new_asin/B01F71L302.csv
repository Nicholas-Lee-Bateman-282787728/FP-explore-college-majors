7749275,2,B01F71L302,"Beware of the ""all region"" DVD's you will need a DVD player the fits the build to play it.  I got burned because I didn't understand that.  A 45% restocking fee is so wrong......",1475884800,12,178,4.205882352941177
7749276,5,B01F71L302,When does the USA get this next season?  We all love it and can't wait.  So what is the date???,1474070400,3,95,3.7
7749277,5,B01F71L302,"Third instalment in a spell binding series based loosely on a bunch of gangsters from Birmingham.  The class system in all its ugliness is here alongside a cracking story which is brilliantly scripted and shot and superbly acted.  One of my favourite things about this show is the anachronistic use of music (PJ Harvey, The Arctic Monkeys, Radiohead et al but especially Nick Cave) for a series set in the 1920s.  A stellar cast tops it off with the likes of Cillian Murphy (mesmerising) and Tom Hardy (terrifying).  If you've seen the other two series you won't need any encouragement on getting this.  If you haven't...what the hell are you waiting for.",1472169600,2,655,4.8125
7749278,4,B01F71L302,"I've actually liked this series and have watched all 3 series now, thx to netflix. theres alot of mixed reviews from others, so its a matter of taste. i've always enjoyed BBC series, which have storys to tell of back in the past. this may have alot of fiction going on with characters, but still gives you the idea of what went on back then. I would have given 5 stars but the only drawback to these series, each are only 6 episodes per series.  the story just got going good before they end it. also, BBC is slow at manufacturing region 0 or region 1's of these series for our U.S. use. sure, there are region free dvd players out there, i own 1 but still pretty risky paying the high price for region 2 since most come from out of another country and are to expensive in postage to return for any replacement. still looking forward to the next 2 series that have been approved to do, but again, will have to wait for netflix. cable companys charge way to much extra for just to have this channel, and few others on their cable line up",1467244800,3,1036,4.232323232323233
7749279,5,B01F71L302,Another superb series. Watching the last episode you immediately want the story to continue!,1501200000,,92,5.642857142857143
7749280,5,B01F71L302,BBC puts out some of the very best series to watch. This is by far one of them,1501027200,,78,3.388888888888889

7749283,5,B01F71L302,Great series but you need a multzone DVD/Blu-Ray player to watch it.  Worth the effort if you plan to buy the entire series.,1494201600,3,124,4.391304347826087
7749284,5,B01F71L302,"after some questionable direction, the show improves even more;
I personally like the music, but I can see where many would be distracted - if you consider the philosphy of brash loud and obnoxious and the nihilistic guitar driven soundtrack interspersed with the maturity of Tom Waits, who can be B L & O sotto voce, it all fits thematically; and if you don't like it, the subtitles are very clear and everyone has a remote with a volume button, don't you?",1491436800,,457,4.585365853658536
7749285,5,B01F71L302,"best series ever. needed special player I purchased on Amazon, that plays more regions than just the US/Canada one. This let me watch this video way before it was released here.",1488844800,3,177,4.741935483870968

7749287,4,B01F71L302,I really like this show but the music is way to loud!!!!  It's overwhelms and distracts from the soft spoken English accents. I'd give the show a 4 plus stars but they need to turn the music down.,1480464000,,196,4.157894736842105

8760368,3,B01F71L302,"Its a great show, and obviously, if youve watched this far, you need to see Season 3. This one does suffer a bit from the basic fact that the whole premise of the plot involving the Russians, the priest and the bomb makes no sense whatsoever, plus it ultimately dissolves into a number of ridiculous and unexplained coincidences to reach the end. Great acting from all nevertheless, and I cant wait for Season 4.",1510617600,,412,4.581081081081081
