8348749,4,B0020ZZJE0,"Family Room Media's ""Church Outside the Walls"" is a four-part video series that deals with the major shift away from institutional church toward grassroots simple/house churches that is happening across America and all around the world. This trend since 1990 has virtually exploded outside the ""system"", so much so that denominations and missions agencies are even starting to make structural changes to become more streamlined, biblical, and effective. This series describes those who are dropping out of the institutional church (part 1), the historical and practical reasons why the institutional church is the way it is (part 2 and 3), and a new way of being church that will be more biblical and equipped to deal with the future (part 4).

Generally, it is well-produced with high-tech graphics, visual techniques, and audio/video quality. It weaves together very interesting interview segments with practitioners and scholars and combines them with other video clips, all narrated by the host who acts as a tour guide of sorts. It addresses important questions such as the clergy/laity divide versus the priesthood of all believers, special church buildings versus homes, spectator church services versus participatory meetings, etc.

But, format-wise it tends to drag sometimes and has spots when the quality of the production is lacking and amateurish. Content-wise, there is also a tendency to overstate the case in order to make a point for simple/house churches in contrast to the institutional church. It does not deal with global simple/church trends (eg. China, India, Vietnam) and makes no real mention of the need for vibrant apostolic leadership, networks of house churches working together to provide a clear visionary direction for church life and mission, leadership training, funding the mission of itinerant leaders, or the place of signs and wonders (Luke 10:1-10; Acts 2:41-47, 13:1-3, 15:6,22,36, 19:10-12, 20:20; 1 Cor 9:1-14; 2 Tim 2:2; 3 John 1:5-8).

Overall, however, it is an excellent starting point for those asking initial questions about what is happening and where to go from here in pursuing a more scriptural, simple, and strategic way of being the church.

8348750,5,B0020ZZJE0,"I came upon this DVD set quite by accident and how lucky for me! Very well done 4-part documentary on Christians who have found fulfillment and closeness to Christ outside the mainstream Church environment. Each segment is narrated in a very casual manner; the interviews are very well done and the subjects seem to be talking with candor and deep feeling.

Very well done from beginning to end and worth the expense for a community who is seeking to reach out to 'the drop-outs'.",1306886400,,480,4.714285714285714
