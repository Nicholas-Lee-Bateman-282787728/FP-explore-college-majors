8465072,1,B005CB2R80,"it would not play on my machine, neither would companion disk. never have had this problem before so disks were useless. Too bad since it is an excellent series( saw others on Netflix).",1494633600,,185,4.636363636363637
8465073,4,B005CB2R80,Great show.  Be warned that the DVD is in a multilayer format that your DVD player may or may not be able to read.  I had to play it on my laptop computer and route it to the TV from there.,1469577600,,189,3.5853658536585367
8465074,5,B005CB2R80,I love this series...got hooked on it living in Europe but pay attention as it comes in PAL format...if your Blu ray or DVD player doesn't read PAL you will not be able to view this.  My solution to this problem was to buy a multi system DVD player (they're for sale on Amazon and not expensive) and now I can catch up on all the episodes I missed after moving to Australia and back to the U.S.,1464912000,,394,4.051282051282051
8465075,5,B005CB2R80,"Great series, interesting program.  One important thing though: this DVD WON'T play on all American DVD players as it's in PAL format, so make sure your DVD player (or computer) will support that format before purchasing.",1457308800,,221,5.138888888888889
8465076,5,B005CB2R80,"Everything this man does is full of interest, fun, and knowledge.  All design enthusiasts will once again be completely drawn in.",1400025600,,129,5.142857142857143
