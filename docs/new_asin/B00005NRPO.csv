8178166,1,B00005NRPO,"You would expect an action movie with good stars like Hopper and Madsen to have something going for it...NOPE! This video is a serious letdown. The plot is amatuerish and hackneyed, the dialogue is pathetic, and the story on the whole is dissapointing and BORING!!DON'T waste your money on this piece of low budget trash like I did. Shame on Madsen and Hopper!!",1073433600,2,361,4.746031746031746
