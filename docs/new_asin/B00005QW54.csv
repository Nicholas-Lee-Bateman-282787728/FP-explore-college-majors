1652635,3,B00005QW54,"The material is based on the researches of Professor Malcolm Barber of the University of Reading in England, who appears in this production discussing the history presented.  It is augmented with material by Dr. David Nicolle of the University of Nottingham in England as well.  Both men are noted Medieval Historians and authors, Prof. Barber being a noted historian on the Crusades, and Dr. Nicolle being very well versed on medieval history, castles and warfare.

The production is in four parts, covering Origins, Corporation, Frontier and Legend.  Origins cover how the Templars came about.  They do not mention Hugh de Payne or the original group who are credited with the founding of the Templars, but does pick up from the time of the First Crusades, and does cover the circumstances of why a military order was needed, and how the Order was finally acknowledged and accepted.

Corporation is much more interesting, showing how much of an important part the Templars played in the construction of the financial basis for that time period in history.  The foundation of the Templar finances is examined and clearly laid out.  This is necessary in order to understand what finally happens to them.

Frontier lays the basis for the fall of the Holy Land and the effects it had on the Templars.  Reinforced and secure, they lose their ground to the Mamluks.  The power struggle plays out, the Holy Land is finally lost to the Crusaders, and the Templars move back into Europe to find they are financially secure, but have no reason now for existence.

The final installment, Legend, examines the fall of the Templars.  Their financial holdings appealed to a failing monarchy, they become the target for the financially strapped French King, and are arrested, tortured, tried and burned.

Throughout the documentaries, Prof. Barber and Dr. Nicolle, as well as a few other specialists, add their viewpoints and their expertise to the topic and make some sense out of what could be confusing and lacking in details.  The material is augmented by the commentaries and is very much like a college class study than a read through a high school text book.  A big plus in my view.

The examination of the legends and stories about the Templars is also a big plus, as it puts into perspective some of the myths that started almost as soon as the last Templars were put to death.  A very good addition to the work.

While the history seems skimmed over, it appears the timing is probably the reason why.  Each episode is approximately 30 minutes long, so there really isn't all that much time to get into details.

As far as the history, the material is well researched, well presented and the whole of the production is very interesting and the time allowed for the production covers the material well enough.

One thing I did find annoying was the production itself.  There is much repetition in the visuals.  The same knights keep trotting across the screen to fill in the visuals while the narrator Art Malaik covers some details.  I gave it three stars because of this.  We watch videos for the visual content, which is lacking here.

This would fit well as a four part series to augment any medieval history class, as they are roughly thirty minute episodes.  And the expertise of Prof. Barber and Dr. Nicolle make this a very good all around picture of the Crusades as well.  So, if you are looking for some good historical background material for the Crusades and the Knights Templar, this is a good production well worth the time to explore.  medievalcrusadesbabe",1132099200,28,3566,4.8270181219110375
1652636,1,B00005QW54,"I found the documentary a bit repetitive with its scences. It looks to have been made with a very low budget. So much more could have been said about the history of a very influencial order that changed many of the rules of warfare and even trade during the 13th and 14th Century and have given rise to a lot of speculation as to their connection with Masons, Rosicrucians and other secret organizations. The two ""experts"" did a credible job in their explanations and the photography, particularly that in the deserts was very good but as far as historical information, it left a lot out.",1031961600,23,588,4.609523809523809
1652637,1,B00005QW54,"A dull and uninformative effort with low production values, utilizing two talking heads with the same limited graphics and music in mind numbing repetition for two hours! A poorly written documentary that jerks without explanation from one period to another, shows buildings without explanation of what they are and where, and even abruptly introduces Salidin without explanation of who he was and where he came from. The Knights Templar story is a fascinating one which has lead to some fevered speculations about their secrets, treasures, and religious icons, including the Holy Grail. So excess regarding the Templars has usually been the problem -- but this thing has suceeded in reducing the story to something that would bore a ten year old. Not worth buying at any price.",1030406400,43,778,5.133858267716535
1652638,5,B00005QW54,Excellent historical review of the Templars with minimum attention to the myths and ridiculous legends that pop history tends to try and sell the uneducated. An excellent first look at the Templars from their true historical purposes and not the mystical mumbo jumbo that Holy Blood Holy Grail offered with absolutely no proof.,1029024000,7,327,5.188679245283019
1652639,4,B00005QW54,"This is a four part TV documentary from 2000 totaling 120 minutes, and is stereophonic, but unfortunately does not contain sub-titles/closed captions.  Prof. Malcolm Barber who is the world's leading expert on the Templar's explains the history of this group of medieval knights who were renowned for protecting Christain Holy Sites in the Palestine area of the Middle East. The historical aspects are very well done with some mini recreations of the knights life-styles, but the mythological aspects of the knights alleged posession of the Holy Grail and other items pertaining to Christ and his family, seem to me to be glossed over.  Overall this is a good introduction to the Knights Templar which should be followed up by reading the series of books by Micheal Baigent & Richard Leigh.",1016582400,27,790,5.069230769230769

7951603,3,B00005QW54,"This film treads the all too familiar story of a few men founding a knighthood to the crusades to being burnt at the stake as heretics. Narrated by a few college professors. If you like knights Templar material, this is for you.",1407888000,,228,4.4523809523809526
7951604,4,B00005QW54,"This documentary talks in great length about the orthodox history of the Knights Templar. Many of the interviews are with historians who expect a firm understanding of history prior to watching. If you don't have this understanding, many parts may be over your head.

Also, if you are looking for a documentary on the Knights Templar that deals with occult lore, this is not the documentary for you; might I suggest the new Cracking the Da Vinci Code, available for rent at your local video store. Between the 2 of these videos, a person can appreciate the history and myth of the Templars.",1254441600,,590,4.728155339805825
7951605,4,B00005QW54,"This is a very well done documentary about the Knights Templar. If you are new to this subject and looking for a broad overview of the history of the Knights in a short period of time, this is an excellent video to watch. It contains all of the key information regarding the creation, growth and downfall of the order as well as some interesting theories about what it was that the templars found in the Temple of Solomon.
If you are a devoted student of the Knights Templar, you will find nothing new on this video. I have been studying the Templars for about a year and have already learned everything that was on this video. It is interesting to watch because I love the subject, but there was nothing new; no new theories, no new findings, no new scholars, no new stories, legends or myths.
So, if you are looking for a starting point for your exploration of the Knights Templar, this is the place to start. If you are looking to expand an already acquired knowledge of the Templars, you probably should look somewhere else.

A 3.5 but I'll bump it to 4 because of the repectful treatment of history.

7951606,5,B00005QW54,"I have no idea why the ratings for this DVD are so low. This is a first rate documentary which includes reenactments and the showcasing of original material from the period. It's weighty and two hours long in duration. I thought the testimony of the academics was enlightening...and yes, entertaining as well. We don't watch documentaries to be dazzled by special effects. Those of us who love the genre love it for what it offers our intellects. Is there anything about the Knights Templars not covered here (which would interest laymen)? No, and that's good enough for me.",1191024000,7,574,4.86734693877551
7951607,3,B00005QW54,"While not very visually engaging, it does make a good presentation of historic information regarding the history and activities of the Knights Templar.  I wouldn't recommend it to any serious researcher, but it would be useful to those curious about the Knights but not interested in investing their time in a book.  In addition, do not buy this film seeking to learn about Holy Grail myths.  It mentions them, but spends the majority of its time on more concrete history and events.",1168128000,3,483,4.865853658536586
7951608,5,B00005QW54,"People interested in history should find this to be an excellent introduction to the Knights Templar.  It stays away from the fanciful and recounts the history of the order.  The photography is beautiful and adds to the information.  The maps also add a great touch.  This DVD will inform you.  This is a documentary and does not attempt to be entertaining, yet I was entertained.",1137974400,7,380,4.7846153846153845
