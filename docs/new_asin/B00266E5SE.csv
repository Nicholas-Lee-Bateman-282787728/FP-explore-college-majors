8352106,5,B00266E5SE,After this movie for ages for my husband. One of the old classics. Excellent find,1465948800,,81,4.466666666666667
8352107,5,B00266E5SE,"First class documentary style account of the Royal Navy at its best on the Yangtze in 1949.  Fact that film is in b&w rather than color should not be a disappointment, as it gives the picture newsreel style authenticity.

Only regret is that as a 70 year old partially deaf geezer I would have appreciated English subtitles.  However, the film's video and audio quality are excellent (Studio Canal is always reliable in this regard).

As noted by Amazon, this disc is coded region two.  Not a problem for me, but do not buy this disk if you do not appreciate the implications of this fact.",1459641600,,589,4.571428571428571
8352108,4,B00266E5SE,"I liked this little known 1957 British war movie, which describes in a quite realistic way a very real event. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

WARNING: this is a Region 2/PAL DVD. It will NOT play on regular US equipement.

1. The real story (SERIOUS SPOILER warning - don't read further this point if you want to discover the story of HMS ""Amethyst"" by watching this film)

On 20 April 1949, during Chinese Civil War, frigate HMS ""Amethyst"" was on her way from Shanghai to Nanking to replace destroyer HMS ""Consort"", which was standing as guard ship for the British Embassy. Even if she displayed very prominently the Union Jack, at 9.30 AM she was attacked by communist artillery and machine guns on the north bank of Yangtse. The ship suffered serious damage and was grounded. 22 men were killed and 31 wounded. HMS ""Consort"" came soon the her help and tried to tow her, but was also damaged by communist artillery and forced to retreat, with 10 crew members killed.

After a huge effort of her crew, HMS ""Amethyst"" was refloated but every attempt of escaping was stopped by communist artillery. A second attempt to assist her, this time by heavy cruiser HMS ""London"" and her sister ship, frigate ""Black Swan"", also didn't succeed.

Negotiations began in order to secure the release of the ship, but communist negotiators asked as the first condition that the British recognise that they opened fire first and also that the British government excuses itself for this ""aggression"". This exorbitant and in fact quite outrageous demand blocked all negotiations and HMS ""Amethyst"" remained blocked in position for the next 10 weeks.

Soon after the sunset on 30 July HMS ""Amethyst"", profitting of a moonless night and of the passage of a Chinese steamer departed and dashed downriver. Communist artillery opened fire but mistakenly focused forst on the civilian steamer, which allowed HMS ""Amethyst"" to escape. The ship sailed 167 km passing under the nose of numerous other communist batteries - but ultimately made it to the sea without further damage or loss of life. Ship's commanding officer, Lt Commander John Kerans send at that moment the signal ""Have rejoined the fleet south of Woosung ... No damage... No casualties....God save the King!"".

2. The film (this point is spoiler free).

This film was made with a maximum effort to show events as faithfully as possible, with drama and ""licentia poetica"" kept to the minimum, and indeed it has a strong feeling of realism. HMS ""Amethyst"" still existed in 1957 and most scenes occur actually in the same places real events happened. However, as she was no more seaworthy at that moment, in the scenes in which the ship moves and fights she was replaced by her sister ship HMS ""Magpie"". An authentic, fully operational destroyer, HMS ""Teazer"", was also used to play HMS ""Consort"". John Kerans hi;self (at that time promoted to Commander) served as technical advisor.

Actors did very well, beginning with Richard Todd, who plays Kerans. Some slightly lighter moments are provided by Akim Tamiroff who plays wonderfully communist colonel Peng, a man who gives a whole new meaning the the expression ""pigheaded""...))) William Hartnell, who was later to become the ""First Doctor"" in Doctor Who series, is excellent as Leading Seaman Leslie Frank.

This is a good film, but the realism and the low key/low drama approach took their toll on it - in some moments it takes a little effort to stay interested (this is the reason for four stars only). Still, I am very happy that I bought and saw it and I will keep my DVD for a possible future viewing. Enjoy!",1411171200,,3624,4.8589951377633716
8352109,4,B00266E5SE,"An enjoyable film, but the make-up on Akim Tamirov has to been seen to be believed.  I wondered, given the excellent naval gunnery of the British Navy, why they were not pounding the Red Chinese artillery, as the British frigate was the only one on the receiving end.  Some guys in the film, like Ian Bannen, sure healed up fast from severe wounds as well.  The ship's cat was a nice touch, and well as cookie, who stuck his finger in the grub he was cooking. I wonder if he washed his hands?",1373414400,,492,4.268817204301075
8352110,4,B00266E5SE,This movie is a reenactment of an actual incident from the Chines Civil War of 1946-1950.  It was told accurately (actual ships used) and the excellent cast brought you into the story.,1367107200,,184,4.75
8352111,5,B00266E5SE,"a well made & interesting picture and really enjoyed by all the family,very typical of the actions of the day",1361491200,,109,4.5
8352112,5,B00266E5SE,"If you collect naval DVD's this was great. You have to use a multi-region DVD player (easy to buy here on Amazon) and it played no problem.  It's a piece of history of how the British navy with its stiff upper lip was able to escape the oriental clutches after a warship was stuck on a sand bank up the Yangtse. A mix of politics, endurance and fotitude over many weeks saved the day.  A 'must see/must have' for any navy buff.",1322265600,2,427,4.195121951219512
8352113,4,B00266E5SE,"Yangtse Incident is based on the non-fiction book ""Escape From the Amethyst"" by  Laurence Earl and revolves aropund the unprovoked shelling of the  Royal Navy vessel of that name by Red Chinese in 1949. The ship was about its lawful business ,ferrying supplies to the British Embassy in the Chinese capital ,then known as Nanking .There was neither warning given nor provocation offered .The vessel became mired in river mud and attempts to tow it to safety was unavailing ,despite the valour of the crew of the resue vessel H M S Concord.

During the shelling the ship's skipper received fatal wounds and the British managed to get a substitute captain on board ,Lt Commander Kearns (Richard Todd) .The Chinese mafde a series of ridiculous demands including ""an apology"" for ""aggression"" all of which Kearns quite rightly told them to shove up their fundament .He dedeided to refloat the ship under cover of night .

The movie stays pretty faithful to the facts of the incident although too little is made of the Concord and its attempt to rescue the vessel .Some have said the Chinese Communits are caricatured but such accustions are nonsense as  you cannot caricature a caricature ! chinese Reds of that era were murderous and wholly dedicated to the humiliation of the West  and the picture accurately reflects this .

The crew of the vessel are the usual assortment of British war movie types -the perky other rankers and clipped voiced upper ranks but the movie is well acted all round .Watch out for cameos from Bernard Cribbens and Ian Bannen amongst others but acting honours are stolen by William Hartnell as a Leading Seaman .Todd was a veteran of D-Day and always brought an air of authenticity to military figures and this is no exception. Add some good ,atmospheric monochrome photography and a rousing score and the result is a robust and enjoyable movie from the days when the British navy had backbone and political leaders who booked no nonsense from their opponents",1255046400,6,1985,4.855029585798817
