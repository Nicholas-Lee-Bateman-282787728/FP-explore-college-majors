6422922,5,B00KE3B7BE,"This is perhaps my favourite film in cinema history, certainly my favourite of Cassavetes' body of work, and I encourage everyone to see it. The following is a mere quibble about the Criterion edition of it. As I discussed a few years ago on my blog, Alienated in Vancouver, a print of Love Streams that played in Vancouver had a curious bit of apparent censorship. Love Streams is notable for Cassavetes fans in that there is a brief glimpse of nudity in it, when Cassavetes' character, a debauched writer named Robert Harmon, comes up the stairs at his home to discover two giggling girls naked in his shower, near the end of the opening credits. Cassavetes was normally somewhat prudish about nudity on screen, and there is very little of it in the films he directed; even the showgirls in Killing of a Chinese Bookie are mostly covered-up. What was curious was that the Vancouver print of the film trimmed about a second of this scene; while on the old Cannon VHS and the French DVD release, you see the girls' bodies and breasts quite clearly, if briefly, in the Vancouver print, the scene was shortened; it's still there, but you can't see anything at all - just a flicker of skin. I concluded it must be an aberration. Bizarrely, however, this ""sanitized"" version of the film is precisely the same as the one Criterion has released. I'd like to know what's happened here; Ray Carney - Cassavetes scholar and controversial Mark Rappaport ""supporter"" - has said that certain elements in the Cassavetes estate have an agenda to censor Cassavetes - pointing to the badly truncated VHS release of Husbands as an example. The Criterion edition of Love Streams seems to confirm this view. It would be interesting to know the actual history - how did the scene get shortened, at whose dictate? It's just a glimpse of nudity, and no reason not to buy the film, but - it's weird!",1409011200,9,1876,4.670694864048339
6422923,5,B00KE3B7BE,"This is a fantastic film that's too long overdue for a DVD release. My favorite Cassavetes film--so much so that I own (and regularly screen) an old big-box VHS copy of it. Can hardly wait to see this new transfer. In addition, this release includes the documentary ""I'm Almost Not Crazy,"" which was also only available on VHS for too long and is a must as a companion-piece to the feature.",1407110400,4,390,4.507042253521127
6422924,5,B00KE3B7BE,"Finally available on digital and a Criterion treatment to boot? I'm completely stoked as this is a favorite of mine. I will be more than happy to retire my VHS when this comes out. According to the Criterion website it's going to contain the Michael Ventura documentary ""I'm Almost Not Crazy"" as well. Very nice addition. This movie like most/all of John's is not for everyone but for a minority it is a god send. It looks like this Criterion release may contain an extra ~18 minutes of the film compared with the timing numbers on my VHS copy. Thanks John and Criterion!",1400716800,21,571,4.553398058252427

8658044,5,B00KE3B7BE,For fans of Awuti this is a great follow up.  It took a few viewings to truly feel it's power but once it sinks in.  What Cassavetes is exploring is the search for love.  It's maddening and exquisite all in the same bite.  I cannot describe what this movie can say to you.  It's a personal experience.  Best I watched alone.  You can't be distracted.  It is to be absorbed.,1469664000,,373,4.228571428571429
8658045,5,B00KE3B7BE,"Along with A Woman Under the Influence, Love Streams is one of Cassavetes' best films. Both Gena Rowlands and John Cassavetes are outstanding in their roles as a frazzled, partially-unhinged divorce and as a free-thinking, oblivious, and impulsive alcoholic. Cassavetes makes an equally greasy and charming 'Robert', while Rowlands makes a very vulnerable 'Sarah', a character the viewer may feel for and empathize with due to her desperate situation. In this film they play a pair of siblings a bit too self-absorbed with their own problems to have a real, meaningful relationship. However, little by little, both make more of an effort to connect, understand, and support each other.

Love Streams is truly unique, heartwarming, dramatic, and comical. As is often Cassavetes' style, it has a psychologically-based plot, which sometimes meanders, yet contains believable, naturally-flawed characters. Highlights of the film are: Rowlands and Cassavetes dancing to ""Where Are You?"" (sung by Mildred Bailey), more dancing by 'Robert' and a fizzy older woman flaunting some kooky moves, 'Sarah's' animal menagerie as a solution for her brother's loneliness, and the end song (by Bo Harwood) featuring Cassavetes in some of his final shots.
