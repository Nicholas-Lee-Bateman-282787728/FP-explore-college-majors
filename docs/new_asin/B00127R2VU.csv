I love the xxxHolic book series, which can best be described as philosophical anime with a dash of high school angst and the supernatural.  I think most people who are drawn to this TV version will be fans of the books&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/xxxHOLiC-Volume-1/dp/0345470583/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">xxxHOLiC, Volume 1</a>.  While I still like the writing that has made its way to the show, not all hard-core fans will be pleased with the DVD version.

The Story

Our main character Watanuki can see spirits, who seem to be drawn to him. He stumbles upon Yuko, who seems to already know his problem and is willing to solve it for a price.  Yuko's ability to grant wishes is reminiscent of many stories about the devil, who always has a price.  Watanuki's price is that he becomes her servant, and a series of adventures ensue.

Like all high school boys, Watanuki has a crush, Himawara, and a nemesis, Doumeki.  In an ironic twist, he is forced to join with both of them to complete his tasks.

Once again, hard-core fans will already be familiar with the basic story.

The Good

The writing includes a lot of riddles and philosophical dialogue to make you think.  So in that sense this is a thought provoking anime.  Still, there's a lot of childish elements too, including the two girl helpers and the talking doll which I personally might have toned down.  In that sense, this anime can appeal to younger and older fans alike.

Still the core elements of the books are here.  That includes some beautiful character silhouettes and beautifully done art sequences for the opening.

There are some funny and clever double entendres here, one in particular to open the second episode.  In that sense, this anime is perhaps more engaging than many others.  Still, the high school themes highlight the fact that just like most anime this one is geared towards kids too.  Precocious kids, but kids nonetheless.

While the first episode is somewhat light, laying the foundation, the other three get progressively better.

The Bad

The first negative I have to note isn't about the episodes but rather the extremely small amount of content on this disk.  These episodes are meant to last 30 minutes with commercials, making the DVD versions about 20 minutes.  I just feel that they could have either included more episodes or priced these better.

There are no real special features to think of either.  The disk includes some images and the opening and closing themes to the show without the credits.  They are both catchy Japanese pop, but I have a feeling that most Japanese people would not consider these the best music they have to offer.

Another thing I was not happy with, which I noticed on another Clamp release as well, is the lack of Japanese character subtitles.  I find original character subtitles helpful in deciphering some questionable translations.

I also like to read subtitles even with the English dub just to make sure I catch everything.  Strangely, the English subtitles are only activated when Japanese is spoken, which isn't very useful.  In order to access subtitles, you have to choose the Japanese option and then the English subtitles come up.  I personally always like to see subtitles even with voice-overs.

Comparing the japanese translations to the voice over dialogue reveals some interesting variances and some cultural differences that were certainly lost in translation.

As far as the animation goes, like I said I love the opening sequence and several elements.  But they seem to have done too many direct transfers from the book series, which sometimes leads to two-dimensional images of characters.  While some characters, particularly Yuko, always seem to be animated with great detail, Watanuki looks like more time could have been spent enhancing his character for the screen.

Conclusion

I think the starter set is a better value than the first collection, because at least you get a box to hold the disks&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/xxxHOLiC-Starter-Set/dp/B00127R2WE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">xxxHOLiC: Starter Set</a>.  No doubt, if you're a hard-core fan of Holic, you will be buying all the coming collections anyway.  The second collection is soon to be released in May and the third collection is due in June.  While I think this series is cool and will still please many hard core fans, it may only appeal to a small audience beyond those core fans.

I watched this with my son and husband (the anime fans in our house) and we all really enjoyed it. The animation was simple but nicely done and the story and characters were engaging and funny too.

This DVD is just the first four episode so we're looking forward to seeing more! Everyone gave the story a thumbs up.",1207785600,3,524,4.1683168316831685
3080690,5,B00127R2VU,"Kimihiro Watanuki is a male student who lives on his own, his parents having died when he was a child. He is plagued with a strange ability to see and attract spirits, an ability he is desperate to be rid of. Enter Yko Ichihara, a dimensional witch who has a mysterious shop Watanuki stumbles into one day. Ichihara sells wishes, but always for a price. She is willing to grant Watanuki's wish to be rid of his ability, but in return he must first work as an assistant/housekeeper of sorts until she decides he has sufficiently paid for the service. This involves more than just the constant cooking (it seems Ichihara and her small staff are always hungry), but also helping with Ichihara's work, through which Watanuki learns valuable lessons about human nature and the nature of the supernatural world.

xxxHOLiC is an Anime (Japanese Animation) series based on a manga from the ladies of CLAMP, and therefore is part of the CLAMP universe (which probably only matters to you if you're a CLAMP fan already) that includes other titles such as Cardcaptor Sakura and Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle. This ""First Collection"" DVD from Funimation is a great introduction to the series, which is very intriguing, though not at all as mature as I expected it to be. Of course, one can't say too much about that after only four episodes. That's the only complaint I have about the DVD itself, that it only holds the first four episodes. Of course, that is not unusual for an Anime DVD release I think, and neither is the very small selection of extras (a rather pointless image gallery, the opening and closing song sequences without the credits, and several trailers for other Anime releases including this one and the xxxHOLiC feature that preceded it). In saying that the show is not as mature as I expected, well, let's just say that I felt a bit like I was watching a darker Sailor Moon series at times, minus schoolgirl superhero stuff. That's okay with me since I was always a big Sailor Moon fan, still am, and this show is a bit more mature than that, but not so much as I expected from the trailer. Of course, again, I've only seen the first four episodes, and it seems a big part of this story is probably about having the very basic and immature characters grow and mature over time. Episode 1: The Inevitable, is about Watanuki's first encounter with Ichihara, becoming her employee, and learning a lesson about how some people invite suffering into their lives. Episode 2: Falsehood, is about a customer with a habit of lying, teaching Watanuki that a person must discover and remedy some problems on their own. Episode 3: Angel, has Watanuki teaming up with a schoolmate he cannot stand, the always calm and cool Dmeki, to solve a mystery about a Ouija board-like game at the request of Watanuki's big crush, the lovely Kunogi (as Dmeki and Kunogi become more important to the cast it would seem). Lastly, Episode 4: Fortune Telling, is a very straightforward lesson for Watanuki about telling real fortune tellers from false ones.

I am truly glad to have been introduced to xxxHOLiC through this DVD. It's a simple show so far, but very interesting, and I found myself always eager to watch the next episode. I definitely would like to see the rest, even though I had to adjust to the lanky design of the characters, which is one thing I'm not particularly fond of.",1207785600,3,3373,4.686340640809443
3080691,3,B00127R2VU,"When I ordered this product through the Amazon Vine program, I knew very little about it -- only the copy from the DVD case, which was pretty vague.  However, when one of my students saw the DVD on my desk, she got very excited.  Apparently, xxxHOLIC is one of her favorite manga.  This made me even more curious to see what it was about.

xxxHOLIC is the story of Watanuki, who sees spirits.  When he meets Yuko, she offers to take away the burden these spirits create -- for a price.  Watanuki must work for Yuko in order to receive his reward, and his employment puts him in a variety of strange situations, most of them involving the paranormal.

The stories here are interesting, and ultimately what glued me to my seat through all four episodes.  Yuko is a fascinating character with a fantastic wardrobe.  Watanuki, unfortunately, was a bit too high-strung and annoying for my taste, but I was able to work past that and enjoy the show.  Overall, I'm intrigued enough to want to see the rest of the series, but only if they fall into my lap like the first collection did; I don't see myself seeking them out.",1207526400,5,1115,4.475247524752476
3080692,2,B00127R2VU,"i had no idea what to expect when i began playing this, but i was hoping for that unexpected find. admittedly i haven't watched much manga, but right off the bat i recognized several manga standbys -- the spiritual (ghostly) world, over-the-top eccentric side characters (two adolescent girls who repeat things in unison, annoyingly), and the too-cute (also annoying) bouncy stuffed-animal-like object -- and quickly my hopes for something totally cool and new sank, and sank further as the episodes plodded on. nothing about this felt original or inspired. all the characters were stock. the artwork, however, was nice. and the wish giver yuko was sexy. but mostly i felt disappointed and impatient watching this. but again, that may be because i'm not by any means a manga afficionado.",1207526400,6,787,5.108527131782946
3080693,2,B00127R2VU,"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this through Amazon Vine. For one thing, I thought it was for adults. Five minutes into it I thought maybe it was for children after all. I will be the lone reviewer to say I didn't like it. I thought Watanuki was much too silly and he annoyed me. I watch cartoons and children's movies with my seven year old grandson all the time so it's not like I'm not acquainted with them. In fact, I am a big fan of Speed Racer and both Superman and Batman, the Animated Series. Watanuki whined and threw tantrums every few minutes. After a while I found myself fast forwarding through his outbursts. His behavior ruined any enjoyment I might have otherwise gotten from the DVD. I was very surprised when I finished writing this review and went to the product page to find it was rated PG14. It seemed too silly for that age group. In fact, I don't know where I would place it. I do know I would have been very upset if I had paid for this movie.

The animation was very well done. It's just too bad Watanuki's character wasn't better drawn. The animation alone earned 2 stars from me.",1207440000,11,1119,4.303317535545023
3080694,5,B00127R2VU,"I have been waiting 4 this series 2 get DUBBED for a few years now. As soon as i saw CLAMP attached to this i knew it was going to be amazing. CLAMP always churns out the HITS. These characters were also apart of the Tsubasa world and vice versa. Makona from Magic Knight Rayearth is also in this series as well. I'm glad to see that it's finally released in the states and can't wait to finish season 1. The male voice characters dubbing was a bit annoying at 1st when he yells but just let it settle in after the 1st episode and you will find that his yelling is part of the allure and actually gives Watanuki more character besides it helps to add to the comedic atmosphere. I'm already beyond addicted as i saw the movie before the series and hope that season 2 makes it state side as well. Of course this and Tsubasa are on 2 different levels. One series is about people with magical mutant like powers and this one isn't so much so. The story is about a boy name Watanuki who sees spirits in his everyday life, spirits that haunt and torture him but he doesn't know why and nobody else can see them but him. One day on his way home he passes by a shop that grants wishes and by some force of nature he is pulled into the shop not willingly but by some magical force. He meets Yuko and she offers to grant him a wish but she only grants it if he submits payment and payment is that he becomes her employee does housekeeping choirs etc. In each episode there is someone who has a wish that needs to be granted and it only gets interesting. Hopefully more will be explained soon. But i heard CLAMP wasn't impressed with this series so season 3 might not be happening. As for Tsubasa we all know the production company messed that series up and CLAMP decided to pull the plug so we might not even see season 2 here in the US. Great series overall, i just wish the soundtrack for xxxHolic pronounced simply HOLIC with all the X's ignored was produced by Yuki Kajiura who always does a splendid job with her Japanese techno opera.",1207267200,5,2030,4.234536082474227
3080725,3,B00127R2VU,"CLAMP always delivers an intriguing story. XxxHolic is no exception.

  First of all let me get one thing off my chest. The anime is drawn strange because it's an adaptation of the manga. For some reason over the past few recent manga series CLAMP has released you can tell they are slowly changing their art style. While they've always drawn their characters a little 'lanky' it seems they are taking a more simple approach to their normally over-the-top details. It was pleasing to the eye in Chobits but seems to be going downhill in XxxHolic. (and Tsubasa as they are essentially tied together)However, since the details are tapering off we can now see the true structure and anatomy of their style of character. It's still the same CLAMP we know and love but simplified.
  Even so it doesn't seem to translate well into anime. Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle is the same way. Seeing the lanky structures in still images, black/white, and with CLAMP's gorgeous detail is okay but once they start moving they have to tone down the details and it starts to show it's flaws.
  All that aside the anime is basically a moving picture version of the manga. The story stays the same, albeit shortened as it's just the first season, and is just as interesting.
  I love the Manga and I've watched the entire first season of the anime. While I am striving to collect all of the Manga a simple 1 time watch-through of the anime was enough for me.

PROs- Very close the manga, all the humor is there, it just wouldn't be the same Watanuki if he wasn't lanky (c'mon admit it!), and it's still the same great short-story style.

CONs- Oversimplified style of animation, Ending is abrupt and open-ended, doesn't explain the characters background (such as what is up with Himawari?!!), and does not even hint at the fact there is 2nd season. (The Manga does though :) Xxxholic Kei)

End thoughts - It's a good story, likable characters, but the animation is severely lacking and it ends up coming across as a short story sitcom of creepy stuff rather than the adaptation of the Manga (which DOES have a story believe it or not).

  In my honest opinion it's a good 1 time watch if you're a fan of the Manga but even then...you could just watch ""Kei"" and you'd be just as happy.",1215129600,8,2263,4.6084788029925186
3080726,3,B00127R2VU,"I had some serious 1980's flashbacks going on as I watched this. Some reviewers have said that this series is about a boy who is plagued by contact with the spirit world, but unfortunately that's just the setup to introduce Watanuki to Yuko, who is a sort of Morticia Adams meets Yoda meets the master from Kung Fu or the Karate Kid.  She dispenses worldly wisdom from her ""wish shop"" in exchange for payment that isn't very clear up front, but in Watanuki's case consist of his watch and his part-time services as a chef and personal shopper (don't be surprised if you find yourself thinking ""wax on/wax off"" when you see Watanuki' attempts in the kitchen).  Watanuki yells and whines almost constantly (showing bizarrely shark-like teeth in the process), while Yuko smokes, calls for more sake, and slinks around in lingerie.  Throw in a Pokmon-type one-eyed stuffed bunny thing that jumps up and down and demands food constantly, two annoying little girls, who don't do much other than shout, giggle and refer to Yuko as their mistress, a possible love interest and a rival for Watanuki, and you've got -- wacky wisdom!

It's hard to say exactly who the intended audience for this program is.  My first thought on watching it was that it's very similar to the cartoons my preteen nieces and nephew watch on television.  Only those don't have a lead character that smokes and drinks sake to excess.  And the xxx in the title, though not pronounced, might lead one to believe this is anime for adults. But the messages in the episodes are definitely not for grown-ups -- we have only one past, there are many possible futures, you have to learn your own lessons, etc., so I'd say this DVD is best for teens who are kind of into goth and anime and haven't seen and heard all these new-age messages before.  If I were that age, I'd probably think this was pretty cool, but as an adult my response to it was just lukewarm.",1214956800,8,1920,4.609970674486804
3080727,4,B00127R2VU,"With its over the top comedy and very odd character designs, this series has yet to really grab me in. The predictable and episodic opening volume sparked my interest but not enough that I am anxious to see more of it. Perhaps if an overall story had been thrown in early, this opening volume would've gotten a bit more credit but for now it remains a title with tons of potential but little momentum to get it started.",1213920000,2,419,4.384615384615385
3080728,2,B00127R2VU,"I really wasn't impressed by this series. I managed to make it through three and a half episodes, though I nearly quit after two, only to decide to give it a bit more of a chance. Nothing really stands out about it. The storyline, while it could have been interesting, is predictable, and overshadowed by better occult series such as YuYu Hakusho and Witch Hunter Robin. The characterization was rather flat, though there were hints of potential development later in the series. I just didn't care for any of the characters enough to want to get the next disc. The animation was average; however, the teen male characters' extremely skinny forms were irritating in and of themselves. Granted, nothing says anime characters are always supposed to be perfectly to scale, but it was an exaggerated enough feature that it was distracting.

Like some other reviewers, I found the series to be full of cliches. The two irritatingly cute girls who spoke in unison seemed to be stuffed in the show with no apparent reason. There was, of course, the not-from-this-world cute animal mascot. And, of course, it all centers around this rather clueless kid with a smartass mentor (Mr. Miyagi did apprentice labor much better).

Overall, not a particularly interesting or unique anime. I'd recommend YuYu Hakusho for a better interpretation of coming-of-age tale mixed with supernatural hijinks.",1212105600,6,1381,5.052631578947368
3080729,3,B00127R2VU,"I was curious about this DVD. I'm rather new to anime and manga, and the description of this series sounded interesting.

Visually this is a rather captivating series to watch even though some of the animation seems, for lack of a better word and at risk of sounding insane, cartoonish. Watanuki spends far too much time screaming and sounding like something out of a Scooby Doo cartoon for my taste - he is rather annoying. I like Yuko, however, and would continue to watch this for her character alone. The twins? Creepy and also somewhat annoying.

I like the dark overtones of the series, but I could definitely do without the theme music - whew! I kept fast forwarding through that. The DVD itself has very few features. There is a gallery and some trailers, but that's it for the extras.

I had planned to pass this DVD on to my 11-year-old nephew, but I think it's just a bit above his age level right now with the smoking, drinking and revealing outfits of Yuko - I like her character, but she is definitely the stereotypically sexy, long-legged, large-breasted female, and she is usually dressed in revealing outfits. This didn't stop me from liking her, but this characterization always makes me imagine 15-year-old boys sitting in a dark room, drawing cartoons of what they think women look like. Just a small complaint.

I don't think I'll buy any more of these DVDs, but I would definitely continue to watch the series.",1211068800,3,1432,4.693227091633466
3080730,3,B00127R2VU,"This is the first set of episodes, so the viewers need to be a little forgiving of the necessity to spend extra time introducing all of the characters and providing adequate background so that subsequent episodes can actually get on with the story. However, there is a thin line between holding the viewer's attention and doing back work.

I just cannot get excited enough about this series after watching the first collection to watch any of the follow ons. The art is interesting in the overly tall, thin caricatures of people (almost like walking stick figures). The personal interactions of the main characters is almost stereotypical in the adolescent and more mature woman formula with its oedipal implications. Add to that the excessive use of cartoonish emotional outbursts by the male lead (Watanuki), and this is just a little over the top for me. While the female lead (Yuko) is drawn with a little more curve than the rest this is no fan service series either. I would have to say that this is primary fare for those that already know and like the series.

3080731,2,B00127R2VU,"Attracted by the product description and being a fan of anime I decided to order Holic:  First collection.

First of all, and like many other examples around, this collection contains only 4 episodes, with the complete season already aired and the second one currently showing in Japan you would expect a set containing the complete season 1. Instead, this release shows to be another attempt to sell separate groups of chapters rather than selling a complete set at a more reasonable price (which will surely be released after all the collections are available)

The story is about a kid cursed to have spirits not visible to others attracted to him, one day he stops by a shop where a mysterious character named Yuko offers him to get rid of his curse, in exchange, he will have to work for her. The first episode was slow-paced and kind of boring, once it's been established which course the series will follow I found the following chapters to be entertaining, I particularly liked the story about the girl with the ""bad habit"". Among the extras there is a trailer for the movie and the rest of the volumes, the glimpses of the following chapters look promising. Being from the same creators (Clamp), in the following episodes characters from other anime series make special appearances (i.e. characters from Cardcaptor Sakura and  Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle), so if you've seen those other series you know what to expect from ""Holic""

There were two things I didn't like: one was the character designs; this is the type of anime in which according to the character's expressions or feelings their drawing will change style to reflect that; the other thing I thought could have been better is the animation, while not bad, it is not too well elaborated; for example, everytime a character walks on the street all the people around him are gray silhouettes, at first I thought it was an artistic choice to reflect something but being this a constant in all episodes I assumed it was not, this type of things make the animation look cheap.

Extras include an image gallery with screenshots from the show (not even concept art or the like), the Intro and Outro songs from the show without the credits and trailers from other DVDs from Funimation.",1210118400,5,2249,4.813471502590674
3080732,4,B00127R2VU,"To get a good feel for this anime series, I had two of our Eiseenhower Public Library's ZOMO group look it over as they're 100% anime and comic devotees; This review is by Nicole Manning:

Destiny - we all know what that means - some poor schmuck's life is going to be changed thanks to some inevitable event. Key word is inevitable here, as this is the name of the first episode in this new series by the very popular shoujo artists known as CLAMP, creators of beautiful masterpieces like Cardcaptor Sakura, X/1999, Chobits, and Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, among others.
Anyway, using destiny and fate as an excuse to make a character miserable (did I say miserable? I meant happy! No, wait, miserable is the right word) is a formula that never fails to deliver. Point in case - Watanuki Kimihiro - a high school student who has the ability to see spirits. Of course, this is a burden, as the spirits tend to follow and latch onto the poor guy. At the start of the episode, it's quite obvious he hates this, and tries running away, only to end up falling flat on his face in front of a curious looking house. Somehow he feels compelled to investigate it, then tries to ignore it - but is then literally dragged in by a mysterious force.
Enter Yuko, an elegant looking woman with white skin, very long black hair, red droopy eyes, and a mystical aura about her. She tells Watanuki that it was inevitable that they met, and says that she can grant him any wish he wants - for a price. He's skeptical, naturally, but eventually gives in, wishing his ability away to see spirits. In exchange, he must work for her part-time, serving her every whim. The series goes on, following his new life working for this strange but interesting witchy woman. Other characters include Yuko's other servants (or pets? I can't tell sometimes, with the way they act) Moro and Maru, Mokona (if you are familiar with CLAMP's work, you will recognize this very cute creature), two of Watanuki's fellow students Himawari (who he has a crush on), and Domeki (his rival who he hates).
The animation is very beautiful and crisp, doing justice to CLAMP's graphic novel work. The music is good, and the dialogue amusing. The story doesn't really get too serious, filled with tons of anime-styled reactions in the form of waterfall tears, huge sweat drops, and big angry eyes complete with large pointy teeth to convey annoyance.
The modern-supernatural genre has been done by CLAMP before, but xxxHOLIC is definitely their best by far. Character designs are solid, but Yuko outdoes them all, with her gothic dresses and mesmerizing eyes. If you're a fan of CLAMP, and/or looking for an interesting new anime to watch, this DVD (with 4 episodes and an image gallery extra) is definitely worth checking out.",1208649600,5,2779,4.694672131147541
3080733,4,B00127R2VU,"I admit, I am intrigued with anime/manga, but I haven't seen any actual tv shows in awhile, or maybe ever. My anime movies go more dark and adult like ""Grave of the Fireflies"" or ""Perfect Blue,"" so this ""xxxHolic"" series was definitely out of my normal pick. ""xxxHolic"" is alot more humor-based, cutesy, easy to understand but interwoven fables [stories that tell life lessons/morals] than it is a drama or thriller, which is what I had previously thought when I got this DVD, based on seeing the cover all dark and eyecatching, and then the ""xxx"" title made me think this series was geared towards adults, but it's slightly more teen/young adult.

Although the DVD is listed in episodes, when you watch, it's more like a movie that's 1 hour 36 minutes long, so in any movie, the first 30 minutes [1st episode] is all about character setup and basic plot. In less than 10 minutes, I would have given up and turned the channel due to the crude line work and simplicity of animation...but by the 2nd 30 minutes [2nd episode], the story definitely got better. The 3rd 30 minutes [3rd episode] has the funniest part about the headphones! When you see that scene, you'll laugh out loud! Also the interaction between the over-reacting Watanuki and subdued Domaki is hilarious! The last episode is about fortune-telling and astrology, Yuko said it best: ""Any prediction true or false, should not be made lightly, it can still alter a person's path.""

There are a few delicious quotes from one of the characters, Yuko: ""The lies that the girl was telling were for her own sake, nobody elses, it wouldn't make a difference if I told her to stop, even if she knew the consequences."" That in itself seems very mature and I really think the series is starting to draw interest.

Another quote from Yuko: ""In this world there is only one possible past for all of us, but it contains an infinite number of futures."" That probably best sums up this ""xxxHolic"" series for me, this series is about a young man named Watanuki who meets with a spiritual shopowner named Yuko, and he learns lessons from encountering people who visit the store and whom he meets in everyday life.

""Shall I grant your wish"" is the start of all the episodes/stories. The episode previews inbetween are all very intriguing and pulls you into continuing to watch the series. I enjoy the character of Yuko most, she's mysterious and unpredictable in what she says/does, compared to the sometimes annoying characters of Watanuki and the 2 echo-lic girls Maru and Moro. The little black pet Mokona reminds me of those famous Japanese Pokemons...most annoying. Not sure why the characters are drawn like tall/thin stick-figures from ""Nightmare Before Christmas.""

While there are moments of teeny-booperness in the animation and speech, there are also moments of introspective thought and questioning, which are the parts I enjoyed. Oh yeah, there's crazy humor and funny manga/comic-style facial features/actions too! Overall, an interesting series for the younger generation who enjoys comics but want to go into slightly more mature material.

I wasn't expecting much from the ""xxxHolic"" series, since I had never known it was a manga before it is now anime also, but I do recommend it.

3080734,4,B00127R2VU,"I love the Japanese sense of macabre and paranormal.  It seems more earthy, more in touch with the elusive truth than much of our airy, or just downright gross, entertainment.  And Clamp does have a decent track record with the general subject (minus a few diversions into things like Chobits, which are not macabre at all).

And in brief, Clamp fans will find the typical stuff here as well as more goofy humor than normal.  I think they'll enjoy it.

Keep in mind I have not read the manga, so I can't comment on how it translates.  I can comment on the translation to English, however; the acting is not great, the ""editing,"" if you can call it that, is overbearing, and at the end of the show, the credits are for the localization staff and no mention is made of anyone who worked on the Japanese version.  Not classy at all.

3080758,3,B00127R2VU,"Since I have read the manga that this anime is directly based on, I had some expectations going in.  The anime follows the manga quite closely.  It is about a boy, Watanuki Kimihiro, who is plagued with visions of ghosts and spirits. His own two feet drag him into the shop of Yuka, a mysterious witch, who promises to help. In return for her services, Watanuki ends up doing menial chores for her around the shop. This premise sounded like it could be cool, and as I am a huge fan of Clamp (I love Chobits!) I expected more.  This volume is more a random series of events wherin our boy helps the witch with some ""issues.""

If you enjoyed the Manga, xxxHolic the Anime is sure to be pleasing as well. However, I found the manga to be much less objectionable than the Anime. The main character is annoying and he seems to be much more of a whimp than some of Clamp's other protagonists. Plus, Yuka can be a little bit ""touchy-feely"" with Watanuki.  This is kinda creepy.  Though he's supposed to be 19, his characterization is much younger (the ""boy"" description is on target), and she's a grown woman.  A little bit of a shota vibe that bothered me.

The twins...they are waaaay over the top and beyond (way, way beyond) cute. I can put up with all of this to a degree, but not all at once, not all in one show. In a book, you can overlook the annoying factor, it's not literally screaming in your ear.  On screen...well that's a different matter.  The characters that are supposed to intersperse some humor just grate on the nerves.  I think this may appeal more to teen fans than adults.

The art work is not some of Clamp's best, but it is still above and beyond some other production companies.  Overall, this anime is okay, but there are much better choices for spending my hard-earned money on.  If you like Clamp - buy Chobits instead.",1208390400,7,1843,4.414201183431953

Annoying sidekick characters (and I mean REALLY annoying)...check.  I'm willing to tolerate all of the above, however, if a show demonstrates the capability to pull together a nice central arc complete with effective cliffhangers and pacing.

3080760,4,B00127R2VU,"I think I'm hooked.  From the first scenes of the first episode, when our hero, the 19 year old school boy Watanuki is walking along a cityscape where all of the other human figures are rendered in gray blocky style, I was caught up in this story of magic and learning.

The ""x"" in the title does not mean it has anything to do with porn and while the series can be ""read"" on a simple level that would appeal to probably age 10 and up (it has some amusing innuendo at the beginning of the 3rd episode, but it's very brief and innocuous)-- the more the viewer is willing to give to the series, the more multilayered and rich it seems.

The story arc is moved along by Watanuki meeting various individuals all of whom have an affect on his character development beginning with Yuko, a beautiful witch who operates a ""wish"" shop.  At times mischievous and demanding, at other times wise and sage-like, Yuko bargains and tricks Watanuki into becoming her parttime employee.  He is a very good cook, but his grumblings and temper often cause him to overlook potential culinary disasters until it is too late. He behaves rashly at times but is well intended.  He has a crush on a beautiful girl at his school and is engaged in a rivalry with a schoolmate, Doumeki, his polar opposite in personality.

Watanuki is a fully realized character.  His volatility seems age appropriate as well as the problems he is working through-- from the evil spirits that are attracted to him to his early loss of parental figures.  I did not find him irritating, but rather amusing and sweet.  He has some obvious good qualities even if he does lose his temper easily.  His love interest, Himawari, and his rival Doumeki are at this stage less fully realized but there is future potential for growth.

Anyone who is not already an anime fan, I would urge to approach this series after shaking off all your western ideas about what ""cartoons"" are or you will miss much of this lushly realized story.",1208304000,2,1975,4.563739376770538
3080761,4,B00127R2VU,"This is another interesting anime series, mildly different stylistically from Aquarion and the Ghost In The Shell series.

This set includes the first four episodes in the series on one DVD. The animation is somewhat simpler than the above mentioned series, but good nonetheless. There are different schools of animation style in the anime genre, but I don't know them well enough to categorize this set.

The main story arc is about a sensitive young man named Watanuki who is tormented by spirits and ends up in the company/mentorship of a sexy witch named Yuko. The series deals with important life lessons mixed with spiritual/occult overtones, and does it in an interesting way. Watanuki is a ""drama queen"" in that he has extreme knee-jerk emotional reactions to situations before he really understands what is going on. (Gee, that's unusual for a teenager......)

Yuko is a well done blend of mysterious, impish, and wise as she guides him in important life lessons. Watanuki gradually learns to be more patient, more confident, and not to judge things so quickly.

I found the animation good even though it was a bit simpler than other series I have seen. The stories were easy to follow, even for a Westerner not schooled in Japanese pop culture. While slightly sexy in places, I did not find it inappropriate or unhealthy. I cannot say the same for Aquarion, which was too focused on violence and combat for my taste.

I thought the life lessons and growth Watanuki experienced were valid and more spiritually oriented (no pun intended) than Western cartoons. The characters were well done and made me care enough to want to watch the rest of the series.

Some religious people might find the spiritual/occult themes offensive, but there are actually good lessons included, such as not to trust divination methods done as games. (One episode is about the dangers encountered when some schoolgirls get involved with a Ouija board type game.) That will appeal to many who are not comfortable with occult practices, although Yuko's character and other aspects of the series will likely still be problematic for them.

I liked the series and look forward to seeing the rest of the episodes at some time. Anime is an interesting art form, and has much to offer. I don't get the XXX in the title, however, but that may be some cultural or age thing going on.",1208217600,4,2361,4.858208955223881

I love the xxxHolic book series, which can best be described as philosophical anime with a dash of high school angst and the supernatural.  I think most people who are drawn to this TV version will be fans of the books&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/xxxHOLiC-Volume-1/dp/0345470583/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">xxxHOLiC, Volume 1</a>.  While I still like the writing that has made its way to the show, not all hard-core fans will be pleased with the DVD version.

The Story

Our main character Watanuki can see spirits, who seem to be drawn to him. He stumbles upon Yuko, who seems to already know his problem and is willing to solve it for a price.  Yuko's ability to grant wishes is reminiscent of many stories about the devil, who always has a price.  Watanuki's price is that he becomes her servant, and a series of adventures ensue.

Like all high school boys, Watanuki has a crush, Himawara, and a nemesis, Doumeki.  In an ironic twist, he is forced to join with both of them to complete his tasks.

Once again, hard-core fans will already be familiar with the basic story.

The Good

The writing includes a lot of riddles and philosophical dialogue to make you think.  So in that sense this is a thought provoking anime.  Still, there's a lot of childish elements too, including the two girl helpers and the talking doll which I personally might have toned down.  In that sense, this anime can appeal to younger and older fans alike.

Still the core elements of the books are here.  That includes some beautiful character silhouettes and beautifully done art sequences for the opening.

There are some funny and clever double entendres here, one in particular to open the second episode.  In that sense, this anime is perhaps more engaging than many others.  Still, the high school themes highlight the fact that just like most anime this one is geared towards kids too.  Precocious kids, but kids nonetheless.

While the first episode is somewhat light, laying the foundation, the other three get progressively better.

The Bad

The first negative I have to note isn't about the episodes but rather the extremely small amount of content on this disk.  These episodes are meant to last 30 minutes with commercials, making the DVD versions about 20 minutes.  I just feel that they could have either included more episodes or priced these better.

There are no real special features to think of either.  The disk includes some images and the opening and closing themes to the show without the credits.  They are both catchy Japanese pop, but I have a feeling that most Japanese people would not consider these the best music they have to offer.

Another thing I was not happy with, which I noticed on another Clamp release as well, is the lack of Japanese character subtitles.  I find original character subtitles helpful in deciphering some questionable translations.

I also like to read subtitles even with the English dub just to make sure I catch everything.  Strangely, the English subtitles are only activated when Japanese is spoken, which isn't very useful.  In order to access subtitles, you have to choose the Japanese option and then the English subtitles come up.  I personally always like to see subtitles even with voice-overs.

Comparing the japanese translations to the voice over dialogue reveals some interesting variances and some cultural differences that were certainly lost in translation.

As far as the animation goes, like I said I love the opening sequence and several elements.  But they seem to have done too many direct transfers from the book series, which sometimes leads to two-dimensional images of characters.  While some characters, particularly Yuko, always seem to be animated with great detail, Watanuki looks like more time could have been spent enhancing his character for the screen.

Conclusion

I think the starter set is a better value than the first collection, because at least you get a box to hold the disks&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/xxxHOLiC-Starter-Set/dp/B00127R2WE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">xxxHOLiC: Starter Set</a>.  No doubt, if you're a hard-core fan of Holic, you will be buying all the coming collections anyway.  The second collection is soon to be released in May and the third collection is due in June.  While I think this series is cool and will still please many hard core fans, it may only appeal to a small audience beyond those core fans.

xxxHOLiC is an Anime (Japanese Animation) series based on a manga from the ladies of CLAMP, and therefore is part of the CLAMP universe (which probably only matters to you if you're a CLAMP fan already) that includes other titles such as Cardcaptor Sakura and Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle. This ""First Collection"" DVD from Funimation is a great introduction to the series, which is very intriguing, though not at all as mature as I expected it to be. Of course, one can't say too much about that after only four episodes. That's the only complaint I have about the DVD itself, that it only holds the first four episodes. Of course, that is not unusual for an Anime DVD release I think, and neither is the very small selection of extras (a rather pointless image gallery, the opening and closing song sequences without the credits, and several trailers for other Anime releases including this one and the xxxHOLiC feature that preceded it). In saying that the show is not as mature as I expected, well, let's just say that I felt a bit like I was watching a darker Sailor Moon series at times, minus schoolgirl superhero stuff. That's okay with me since I was always a big Sailor Moon fan, still am, and this show is a bit more mature than that, but not so much as I expected from the trailer. Of course, again, I've only seen the first four episodes, and it seems a big part of this story is probably about having the very basic and immature characters grow and mature over time. Episode 1: The Inevitable, is about Watanuki's first encounter with Ichihara, becoming her employee, and learning a lesson about how some people invite suffering into their lives. Episode 2: Falsehood, is about a customer with a habit of lying, teaching Watanuki that a person must discover and remedy some problems on their own. Episode 3: Angel, has Watanuki teaming up with a schoolmate he cannot stand, the always calm and cool Dmeki, to solve a mystery about a Ouija board-like game at the request of Watanuki's big crush, the lovely Kunogi (as Dmeki and Kunogi become more important to the cast it would seem). Lastly, Episode 4: Fortune Telling, is a very straightforward lesson for Watanuki about telling real fortune tellers from false ones.

I am truly glad to have been introduced to xxxHOLiC through this DVD. It's a simple show so far, but very interesting, and I found myself always eager to watch the next episode. I definitely would like to see the rest, even though I had to adjust to the lanky design of the characters, which is one thing I'm not particularly fond of.",1207785600,3,3373,4.686340640809443

3315222,3,B00127R2VU,"CLAMP always delivers an intriguing story. XxxHolic is no exception.

  First of all let me get one thing off my chest. The anime is drawn strange because it's an adaptation of the manga. For some reason over the past few recent manga series CLAMP has released you can tell they are slowly changing their art style. While they've always drawn their characters a little 'lanky' it seems they are taking a more simple approach to their normally over-the-top details. It was pleasing to the eye in Chobits but seems to be going downhill in XxxHolic. (and Tsubasa as they are essentially tied together)However, since the details are tapering off we can now see the true structure and anatomy of their style of character. It's still the same CLAMP we know and love but simplified.
  Even so it doesn't seem to translate well into anime. Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle is the same way. Seeing the lanky structures in still images, black/white, and with CLAMP's gorgeous detail is okay but once they start moving they have to tone down the details and it starts to show it's flaws.
  All that aside the anime is basically a moving picture version of the manga. The story stays the same, albeit shortened as it's just the first season, and is just as interesting.
  I love the Manga and I've watched the entire first season of the anime. While I am striving to collect all of the Manga a simple 1 time watch-through of the anime was enough for me.

PROs- Very close the manga, all the humor is there, it just wouldn't be the same Watanuki if he wasn't lanky (c'mon admit it!), and it's still the same great short-story style.

CONs- Oversimplified style of animation, Ending is abrupt and open-ended, doesn't explain the characters background (such as what is up with Himawari?!!), and does not even hint at the fact there is 2nd season. (The Manga does though :) Xxxholic Kei)

End thoughts - It's a good story, likable characters, but the animation is severely lacking and it ends up coming across as a short story sitcom of creepy stuff rather than the adaptation of the Manga (which DOES have a story believe it or not).

  In my honest opinion it's a good 1 time watch if you're a fan of the Manga but even then...you could just watch ""Kei"" and you'd be just as happy.",1215129600,8,2263,4.6084788029925186

Some reviewers have said that this series is about a boy who is plagued by contact with the spirit world, but unfortunately that's just the setup to introduce Watanuki to Yuko, who is a sort of Morticia Adams meets Yoda meets the master from Kung Fu or the Karate Kid.  She dispenses worldly wisdom from her ""wish shop"" in exchange for payment that isn't very clear up front, but in Watanuki's case consist of his watch and his part-time services as a chef and personal shopper (don't be surprised if you find yourself thinking ""wax on/wax off"" when you see Watanuki' attempts in the kitchen).  Watanuki yells and whines almost constantly (showing bizarrely shark-like teeth in the process), while Yuko smokes, calls for more sake, and slinks around in lingerie.  Throw in a Pokmon-type one-eyed stuffed bunny thing that jumps up and down and demands food constantly, two annoying little girls, who don't do much other than shout, giggle and refer to Yuko as their mistress, a possible love interest and a rival for Watanuki, and you've got -- wacky wisdom!

It's hard to say exactly who the intended audience for this program is.  My first thought on watching it was that it's very similar to the cartoons my preteen nieces and nephew watch on television.  Only those don't have a lead character that smokes and drinks sake to excess.  And the xxx in the title, though not pronounced, might lead one to believe this is anime for adults. But the messages in the episodes are definitely not for grown-ups -- we have only one past, there are many possible futures, you have to learn your own lessons, etc., so I'd say this DVD is best for teens who are kind of into goth and anime and haven't seen and heard all these new-age messages before.  If I were that age, I'd probably think this was pretty cool, but as an adult my response to it was just lukewarm.",1214956800,8,1920,4.609970674486804
3315224,4,B00127R2VU,"With its over the top comedy and very odd character designs, this series has yet to really grab me in. The predictable and episodic opening volume sparked my interest but not enough that I am anxious to see more of it. Perhaps if an overall story had been thrown in early, this opening volume would've gotten a bit more credit but for now it remains a title with tons of potential but little momentum to get it started.",1213920000,2,419,4.384615384615385
3315225,2,B00127R2VU,"I really wasn't impressed by this series. I managed to make it through three and a half episodes, though I nearly quit after two, only to decide to give it a bit more of a chance. Nothing really stands out about it. The storyline, while it could have been interesting, is predictable, and overshadowed by better occult series such as YuYu Hakusho and Witch Hunter Robin. The characterization was rather flat, though there were hints of potential development later in the series. I just didn't care for any of the characters enough to want to get the next disc. The animation was average; however, the teen male characters' extremely skinny forms were irritating in and of themselves. Granted, nothing says anime characters are always supposed to be perfectly to scale, but it was an exaggerated enough feature that it was distracting.

Like some other reviewers, I found the series to be full of cliches. The two irritatingly cute girls who spoke in unison seemed to be stuffed in the show with no apparent reason. There was, of course, the not-from-this-world cute animal mascot. And, of course, it all centers around this rather clueless kid with a smartass mentor (Mr. Miyagi did apprentice labor much better).

Overall, not a particularly interesting or unique anime. I'd recommend YuYu Hakusho for a better interpretation of coming-of-age tale mixed with supernatural hijinks.",1212105600,6,1381,5.052631578947368
3315226,3,B00127R2VU,"I was curious about this DVD. I'm rather new to anime and manga, and the description of this series sounded interesting.

Visually this is a rather captivating series to watch even though some of the animation seems, for lack of a better word and at risk of sounding insane, cartoonish. Watanuki spends far too much time screaming and sounding like something out of a Scooby Doo cartoon for my taste - he is rather annoying. I like Yuko, however, and would continue to watch this for her character alone. The twins? Creepy and also somewhat annoying.

I like the dark overtones of the series, but I could definitely do without the theme music - whew! I kept fast forwarding through that. The DVD itself has very few features. There is a gallery and some trailers, but that's it for the extras.

I had planned to pass this DVD on to my 11-year-old nephew, but I think it's just a bit above his age level right now with the smoking, drinking and revealing outfits of Yuko - I like her character, but she is definitely the stereotypically sexy, long-legged, large-breasted female, and she is usually dressed in revealing outfits. This didn't stop me from liking her, but this characterization always makes me imagine 15-year-old boys sitting in a dark room, drawing cartoons of what they think women look like. Just a small complaint.

I don't think I'll buy any more of these DVDs, but I would definitely continue to watch the series.",1211068800,3,1432,4.693227091633466
3315227,3,B00127R2VU,"This is the first set of episodes, so the viewers need to be a little forgiving of the necessity to spend extra time introducing all of the characters and providing adequate background so that subsequent episodes can actually get on with the story. However, there is a thin line between holding the viewer's attention and doing back work.

I just cannot get excited enough about this series after watching the first collection to watch any of the follow ons. The art is interesting in the overly tall, thin caricatures of people (almost like walking stick figures). The personal interactions of the main characters is almost stereotypical in the adolescent and more mature woman formula with its oedipal implications. Add to that the excessive use of cartoonish emotional outbursts by the male lead (Watanuki), and this is just a little over the top for me. While the female lead (Yuko) is drawn with a little more curve than the rest this is no fan service series either. I would have to say that this is primary fare for those that already know and like the series.

3315228,2,B00127R2VU,"Attracted by the product description and being a fan of anime I decided to order Holic:  First collection.

First of all, and like many other examples around, this collection contains only 4 episodes, with the complete season already aired and the second one currently showing in Japan you would expect a set containing the complete season 1. Instead, this release shows to be another attempt to sell separate groups of chapters rather than selling a complete set at a more reasonable price (which will surely be released after all the collections are available)

The story is about a kid cursed to have spirits not visible to others attracted to him, one day he stops by a shop where a mysterious character named Yuko offers him to get rid of his curse, in exchange, he will have to work for her. The first episode was slow-paced and kind of boring, once it's been established which course the series will follow I found the following chapters to be entertaining, I particularly liked the story about the girl with the ""bad habit"". Among the extras there is a trailer for the movie and the rest of the volumes, the glimpses of the following chapters look promising. Being from the same creators (Clamp), in the following episodes characters from other anime series make special appearances (i.e. characters from Cardcaptor Sakura and  Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle), so if you've seen those other series you know what to expect from ""Holic""

There were two things I didn't like: one was the character designs; this is the type of anime in which according to the character's expressions or feelings their drawing will change style to reflect that; the other thing I thought could have been better is the animation, while not bad, it is not too well elaborated; for example, everytime a character walks on the street all the people around him are gray silhouettes, at first I thought it was an artistic choice to reflect something but being this a constant in all episodes I assumed it was not, this type of things make the animation look cheap.

Extras include an image gallery with screenshots from the show (not even concept art or the like), the Intro and Outro songs from the show without the credits and trailers from other DVDs from Funimation.",1210118400,5,2249,4.813471502590674
3315229,4,B00127R2VU,"To get a good feel for this anime series, I had two of our Eiseenhower Public Library's ZOMO group look it over as they're 100% anime and comic devotees; This review is by Nicole Manning:

Destiny - we all know what that means - some poor schmuck's life is going to be changed thanks to some inevitable event. Key word is inevitable here, as this is the name of the first episode in this new series by the very popular shoujo artists known as CLAMP, creators of beautiful masterpieces like Cardcaptor Sakura, X/1999, Chobits, and Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, among others.
Anyway, using destiny and fate as an excuse to make a character miserable (did I say miserable? I meant happy! No, wait, miserable is the right word) is a formula that never fails to deliver. Point in case - Watanuki Kimihiro - a high school student who has the ability to see spirits. Of course, this is a burden, as the spirits tend to follow and latch onto the poor guy. At the start of the episode, it's quite obvious he hates this, and tries running away, only to end up falling flat on his face in front of a curious looking house. Somehow he feels compelled to investigate it, then tries to ignore it - but is then literally dragged in by a mysterious force.
Enter Yuko, an elegant looking woman with white skin, very long black hair, red droopy eyes, and a mystical aura about her. She tells Watanuki that it was inevitable that they met, and says that she can grant him any wish he wants - for a price. He's skeptical, naturally, but eventually gives in, wishing his ability away to see spirits. In exchange, he must work for her part-time, serving her every whim. The series goes on, following his new life working for this strange but interesting witchy woman. Other characters include Yuko's other servants (or pets? I can't tell sometimes, with the way they act) Moro and Maru, Mokona (if you are familiar with CLAMP's work, you will recognize this very cute creature), two of Watanuki's fellow students Himawari (who he has a crush on), and Domeki (his rival who he hates).
The animation is very beautiful and crisp, doing justice to CLAMP's graphic novel work. The music is good, and the dialogue amusing. The story doesn't really get too serious, filled with tons of anime-styled reactions in the form of waterfall tears, huge sweat drops, and big angry eyes complete with large pointy teeth to convey annoyance.
The modern-supernatural genre has been done by CLAMP before, but xxxHOLIC is definitely their best by far. Character designs are solid, but Yuko outdoes them all, with her gothic dresses and mesmerizing eyes. If you're a fan of CLAMP, and/or looking for an interesting new anime to watch, this DVD (with 4 episodes and an image gallery extra) is definitely worth checking out.",1208649600,5,2779,4.694672131147541
3315230,4,B00127R2VU,"I admit, I am intrigued with anime/manga, but I haven't seen any actual tv shows in awhile, or maybe ever. My anime movies go more dark and adult like ""Grave of the Fireflies"" or ""Perfect Blue,"" so this ""xxxHolic"" series was definitely out of my normal pick. ""xxxHolic"" is alot more humor-based, cutesy, easy to understand but interwoven fables [stories that tell life lessons/morals] than it is a drama or thriller, which is what I had previously thought when I got this DVD, based on seeing the cover all dark and eyecatching, and then the ""xxx"" title made me think this series was geared towards adults, but it's slightly more teen/young adult.

Although the DVD is listed in episodes, when you watch, it's more like a movie that's 1 hour 36 minutes long, so in any movie, the first 30 minutes [1st episode] is all about character setup and basic plot. In less than 10 minutes, I would have given up and turned the channel due to the crude line work and simplicity of animation...but by the 2nd 30 minutes [2nd episode], the story definitely got better. The 3rd 30 minutes [3rd episode] has the funniest part about the headphones! When you see that scene, you'll laugh out loud! Also the interaction between the over-reacting Watanuki and subdued Domaki is hilarious! The last episode is about fortune-telling and astrology, Yuko said it best: ""Any prediction true or false, should not be made lightly, it can still alter a person's path.""

There are a few delicious quotes from one of the characters, Yuko: ""The lies that the girl was telling were for her own sake, nobody elses, it wouldn't make a difference if I told her to stop, even if she knew the consequences."" That in itself seems very mature and I really think the series is starting to draw interest.

Another quote from Yuko: ""In this world there is only one possible past for all of us, but it contains an infinite number of futures."" That probably best sums up this ""xxxHolic"" series for me, this series is about a young man named Watanuki who meets with a spiritual shopowner named Yuko, and he learns lessons from encountering people who visit the store and whom he meets in everyday life.

""Shall I grant your wish"" is the start of all the episodes/stories. The episode previews inbetween are all very intriguing and pulls you into continuing to watch the series. I enjoy the character of Yuko most, she's mysterious and unpredictable in what she says/does, compared to the sometimes annoying characters of Watanuki and the 2 echo-lic girls Maru and Moro. The little black pet Mokona reminds me of those famous Japanese Pokemons...most annoying. Not sure why the characters are drawn like tall/thin stick-figures from ""Nightmare Before Christmas.""

While there are moments of teeny-booperness in the animation and speech, there are also moments of introspective thought and questioning, which are the parts I enjoyed. Oh yeah, there's crazy humor and funny manga/comic-style facial features/actions too! Overall, an interesting series for the younger generation who enjoys comics but want to go into slightly more mature material.

I wasn't expecting much from the ""xxxHolic"" series, since I had never known it was a manga before it is now anime also, but I do recommend it. The 4 episodes were light and very funny while woven with intellectual comments/quotes. I would continue watching the series if it were to become available on TV, or easy rentals.

3315231,4,B00127R2VU,"I love the Japanese sense of macabre and paranormal.  It seems more earthy, more in touch with the elusive truth than much of our airy, or just downright gross, entertainment.  And Clamp does have a decent track record with the general subject (minus a few diversions into things like Chobits, which are not macabre at all).

And in brief, Clamp fans will find the typical stuff here as well as more goofy humor than normal.  I think they'll enjoy it.

Keep in mind I have not read the manga, so I can't comment on how it translates.  I can comment on the translation to English, however; the acting is not great, the ""editing,"" if you can call it that, is overbearing, and at the end of the show, the credits are for the localization staff and no mention is made of anyone who worked on the Japanese version.  Not classy at all.

3315255,3,B00127R2VU,"Since I have read the manga that this anime is directly based on, I had some expectations going in.  The anime follows the manga quite closely.  It is about a boy, Watanuki Kimihiro, who is plagued with visions of ghosts and spirits. His own two feet drag him into the shop of Yuka, a mysterious witch, who promises to help. In return for her services, Watanuki ends up doing menial chores for her around the shop. This premise sounded like it could be cool, and as I am a huge fan of Clamp (I love Chobits!) I expected more.  This volume is more a random series of events wherin our boy helps the witch with some ""issues.""

If you enjoyed the Manga, xxxHolic the Anime is sure to be pleasing as well. However, I found the manga to be much less objectionable than the Anime. The main character is annoying and he seems to be much more of a whimp than some of Clamp's other protagonists. Plus, Yuka can be a little bit ""touchy-feely"" with Watanuki.  This is kinda creepy.  Though he's supposed to be 19, his characterization is much younger (the ""boy"" description is on target), and she's a grown woman.  A little bit of a shota vibe that bothered me.

The twins...they are waaaay over the top and beyond (way, way beyond) cute. I can put up with all of this to a degree, but not all at once, not all in one show. In a book, you can overlook the annoying factor, it's not literally screaming in your ear.  On screen...well that's a different matter.  The characters that are supposed to intersperse some humor just grate on the nerves.  I think this may appeal more to teen fans than adults.

The art work is not some of Clamp's best, but it is still above and beyond some other production companies.  Overall, this anime is okay, but there are much better choices for spending my hard-earned money on.  If you like Clamp - buy Chobits instead.",1208390400,7,1843,4.414201183431953

On a visual front, the style is likeable.  Characters have height to width proportions a la Jack Skellington, which makes for some interesting movement.

The story, however, you've seen a million times in better anime.  Spirit world...check.  Clueless boy...check.  Worldly girl...check.  Annoying sidekick characters (and I mean REALLY annoying)...check.  I'm willing to tolerate all of the above, however, if a show demonstrates the capability to pull together a nice central arc complete with effective cliffhangers and pacing.  I didn't get the impression that that was happening.  Perhaps it's too early to judge the show...I just know that I'm too bored now to care whether it does pick up.

3315257,4,B00127R2VU,"I think I'm hooked.  From the first scenes of the first episode, when our hero, the 19 year old school boy Watanuki is walking along a cityscape where all of the other human figures are rendered in gray blocky style, I was caught up in this story of magic and learning.

The ""x"" in the title does not mean it has anything to do with porn and while the series can be ""read"" on a simple level that would appeal to probably age 10 and up (it has some amusing innuendo at the beginning of the 3rd episode, but it's very brief and innocuous)-- the more the viewer is willing to give to the series, the more multilayered and rich it seems.

The story arc is moved along by Watanuki meeting various individuals all of whom have an affect on his character development beginning with Yuko, a beautiful witch who operates a ""wish"" shop.  At times mischievous and demanding, at other times wise and sage-like, Yuko bargains and tricks Watanuki into becoming her parttime employee.  He is a very good cook, but his grumblings and temper often cause him to overlook potential culinary disasters until it is too late. He behaves rashly at times but is well intended.  He has a crush on a beautiful girl at his school and is engaged in a rivalry with a schoolmate, Doumeki, his polar opposite in personality.

Watanuki is a fully realized character.  His volatility seems age appropriate as well as the problems he is working through-- from the evil spirits that are attracted to him to his early loss of parental figures.  I did not find him irritating, but rather amusing and sweet.  He has some obvious good qualities even if he does lose his temper easily.  His love interest, Himawari, and his rival Doumeki are at this stage less fully realized but there is future potential for growth.

Anyone who is not already an anime fan, I would urge to approach this series after shaking off all your western ideas about what ""cartoons"" are or you will miss much of this lushly realized story.",1208304000,2,1975,4.563739376770538
3315258,4,B00127R2VU,"This is another interesting anime series, mildly different stylistically from Aquarion and the Ghost In The Shell series.

This set includes the first four episodes in the series on one DVD. The animation is somewhat simpler than the above mentioned series, but good nonetheless. There are different schools of animation style in the anime genre, but I don't know them well enough to categorize this set.

The main story arc is about a sensitive young man named Watanuki who is tormented by spirits and ends up in the company/mentorship of a sexy witch named Yuko. The series deals with important life lessons mixed with spiritual/occult overtones, and does it in an interesting way. Watanuki is a ""drama queen"" in that he has extreme knee-jerk emotional reactions to situations before he really understands what is going on. (Gee, that's unusual for a teenager......)

Yuko is a well done blend of mysterious, impish, and wise as she guides him in important life lessons. Watanuki gradually learns to be more patient, more confident, and not to judge things so quickly.

I found the animation good even though it was a bit simpler than other series I have seen. The stories were easy to follow, even for a Westerner not schooled in Japanese pop culture. While slightly sexy in places, I did not find it inappropriate or unhealthy. I cannot say the same for Aquarion, which was too focused on violence and combat for my taste.

I thought the life lessons and growth Watanuki experienced were valid and more spiritually oriented (no pun intended) than Western cartoons. The characters were well done and made me care enough to want to watch the rest of the series.

Some religious people might find the spiritual/occult themes offensive, but there are actually good lessons included, such as not to trust divination methods done as games. (One episode is about the dangers encountered when some schoolgirls get involved with a Ouija board type game.) That will appeal to many who are not comfortable with occult practices, although Yuko's character and other aspects of the series will likely still be problematic for them.

I liked the series and look forward to seeing the rest of the episodes at some time. Anime is an interesting art form, and has much to offer. I don't get the XXX in the title, however, but that may be some cultural or age thing going on.",1208217600,4,2361,4.858208955223881

Although you may not necessarily be cheering him on (he's a bit obnoxious and whiny), 19-year-old Watanuki quickly gets on your good side.

Watanuki has a special gift-- or burden.  He can see spirits and they are aware Watanuki can see them, so they stalk him wherever he goes-- until,  that is, he stumbles upon a beautiful house amidst a garden, right in the middle of the metropolis.  Watanuki is pulled in-- he literally cannot get away-- whereupon he is greeted by two young girls, Maru and Moru, who take him to their mistress.  Yoku, a seductive psychic who seems to know everything there is know about Watanuki, promises to make his problem go away and offers to grant his wishes (for a price).

Soon Watanuki finds himself running her errands and battling evil spirits all the while tying to win the heart of Himawari (his love interest) and trying to make himself look better than Domeki (the handsome impassive athlete).

8244639,5,B00127R2VU,"Once again, another anime I can't get enough of.  I love this series enough, I'm going to buy it.  Generally I just NetFlix a series and am done with it.  Keep in mind, I've watched several series, and have only purchased two titles: Fruits Basket and KamiChu!.

What I love about xxxHolic is that even though the characters are silly, there are always lessons to be learned.  It's a great series, and I think you should definitely give it a try.",1240099200,,446,4.45679012345679
8244640,1,B00127R2VU,"I love watching a good anime, but xxxholic is so bad I really can't overlook the art. No matter what the story they are trying to tell it's hard to not focus on the strange style of animation. The characters look like those aliens from ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" mixed in with ""Beetle Juice""... and The ""Adams family"". That is pretty much the artistic style of this anime. The characters look strange as hell with legs and arms 3 times the size of their torso. I found this anime extremely frightening. The art gave me nightmares and I hold my bible and drink holy water while watching this. That's how bad this anime looks. It's like if Vincent Van Gogh made a cartoon, this is what it would look like. Abstract as hell!",1236556800,,731,4.4222222222222225
8244641,4,B00127R2VU,"Based on a successful line of manga, XXXHOLIC presents a paranormal world filled with ghosts and demons, and heroes in the making.  Watanuki Kimihiro has been cursed with seeing ghosts his whole life.  At 19, although his character sounds and acts much younger in the anime series, he finds a witch's shop.  Yuko, the witch, promises him that she can take away his burden, but she wants him to help her in exchange.

It doesn't take long before Watanuki gets paired up with the usual supportive and egregious sidekicks.  This time they're Shizuka Domeki and Himawari Kunogi.  Shizuka is the annoying guy that constantly gets under Watanuki's skin, but he crushes on Himawari.

The storytelling is sometimes uneven and sophomoric, but the episodes are overall fun and lively.  Definitely not for the younger anime lovers, tough, because there are some adult issues addressed and hinted at.  The art takes some getting used to.  I found that it was too ""soft"" for me at first.  The frames occasionally looked a little blurry, but I know that was the effect the artist was going for.  It's just different, but that can be a good thing.",1219276800,,1132,4.808290155440415
8244642,5,B00127R2VU,"When I first heard about the manga, one might assume xxxHolic is a hybrid between the 'Sixth Sense' (Watanuki's spirit-viewing ability) and 'Friday the 13th The Series' (Yuko's mysterious shop of antiquities and the ability for 'granting' wishing).  But the story's much more in-depth than that, and CLAMP rarely disappoints.

Basically, the tale begins with Kimihiro Watanuki, a high school student who has this extraordinary affliction:  not only can he see spirits and monsters, but they have an unnatural attraction to him.  While attempting getting away from an intense, supernatural mass, Watanuki finds himself in front of a mysterious shop.

Lured inside, he meets up with Yuko Ichihara, the Time-Space Witch, who discovers Watanuki's malady.  She offers curing Watanuki of his problem, but for a price:  he ends up working for her, and in return he gets embroiled with a lot of mysterious situations due to other customers and their problems.

Not all the stories end on a happy note, but Watanuki somehow gets a little wiser through his experiences, especially with the help of Domeki and his love interest, Himawari Kunogi.

The First Collection sets up the story on how Watanuki meets up with Yuko and how it affects his life and the people around them.  The stories are interesting and shows how Yuko views life in the modern world while Watanuki goes from an emo high school student, to one understanding the strangeness about him.

Though it does connect with CLAMP's other series, Tsubasa, xxxHolic is definitely a good show to view.  Definitely worth a look for anime fans!",1217548800,3,1590,5.049808429118774
8244643,5,B00127R2VU,"I recently had the pleasure of viewing the first Funimation installment of xxxHolic, a seinen series created by the esteemed CLAMP production team of Japan. This popular series may already be familiar to many individuals reading this review, so this review will be split into two paragraphs; the first dealing with my thoughts about the contents of this excellent show, and the second dealing with the DVD itself.

This particular DVD offers four episodes in the series. xxxHolic is a fantasy set in modern times, one where spirits and ghosts are very real forces in the world and with characters who are binded in the traditional ideals of Japanese mysticism and destiny. The show offers a good mix of light-hearted comedy and surrealist, dark and moral themes. While the storylines makes heavy references to mystical aspects of fate, spirits, posession, etc., the plot centers on everyday human interactions and desires. The anime seems to be episodic in nature, meaning that one doesn't necessarily need to marathon the anime in order to ""get it""; each episode is self-contained and usually focuses on some sort of moral lesson that is applicable to our day-to-day lives. Examples include: individuals lying about the superficial in order to give them a feeling of self-worth; the pitfalls of transferring one's hardships to another; and the underlying dangers lurking inside our deepest desires. There isn't much action or ecchi material, but the plot is well developed and the character designs are rendered nicely in a traditional, colorful, Gothic-Lolita style. The dialogue is also strong and mildly thought-provoking, but from what I've seen thus far this series doesn't have the high-brow intellectual churning of a series like Ergo Proxy (which many viewers might welcome).

With respect to a technical review of the DVD, Funimation has been doing beautifully thus far with its handling of Japanese Anime. In an age where Western fans have all too often been subjected to horrible dubs, un-necessary censorship, and overall shoddy translations of Japanese works, Funimation seems to be doing all the right things. Nothing is edited out or altered in the name of ""censorship""; the original opening and ending theme songs have not been dubbed-over or thrown away; and the English voice acting is actually quite good! The subtitles are also accurrate and do not have any syncing problems with the animation itself. Although there aren't any special features of real note -- just the usual trailers for other productions -- we are more than satisfied with a good, solid presentation. In short, the DVD delivers the basic satisfactory components one would want for a quality viewing experience.

Overall, if you're a fan of the manga or the anime, or a fan of CLAMP in particular, you will find this to be a worthy buy. If you're looking for some light-hearted and mildly (but not deeply) thought provoking material, I highly recommend the xxxHolic series!",1216252800,2,2962,5.128364389233955
8244644,4,B00127R2VU,"This ""First Collection"" contains the first 4 episodes of xxxHOLiC which I must say, I completely enjoyed.  I had no knowledge of anything about this series going in and the 4 episodes I did watch were engaging, mysterious and funny. I think this first collection does a good job at whetting the appetite for the story to follow.  I do enjoy watching anime and there are some aspects of this that are very - anime - which some people might consider weird or annoying, but I don't think that anyone who has seen a lot of anime would think that the character actions or anything about it is weird.

It has a feel of a dark comedy and the way everything was animated reminds me a lot of the Nightmare Before Christmas (not the same obviously, but the movements and creatures are dreadful and captivating all at once.)  In the first 4 episodes I did not notice anything overtly adult (be it sexuality or violence) however if anyone is offended by casual use of the occult (fortune telling, spirits, omens, Ouija boards) this is not the series for you.

The DVD itself comes in a slim case - no additional papers or artwork and there aren't much in the way of dvd extras either.  You do have the option of watching in English 5.1 Dolby, or watching in Japanese or English stereo.  There are English and Japanese subtitles.

I was impressed with these first 4 episodes, I look forward to seeing what happens as the story progresses.",1215129600,3,1425,4.517509727626459
