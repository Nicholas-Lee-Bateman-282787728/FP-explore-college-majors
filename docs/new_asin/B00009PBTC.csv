1887631,4,B00009PBTC,"Well-acted, if somewhat sketchy, analysis of the careers of the imfamous group of Cambridge University students who espoused Marxism as undergraduates and went on to become the most effective British spies of
the Cold War era.  The production focuses on the ideas and events which drew these men into the twilight world of espionage, and offers a rather limited depiction of the deterioration of their lives and careers as a result of their politics and their character flaws.

The writer and director of this BBC production display sympathy for these men who make a commitment wihout clearly anticipating where their youthful enthusiam may lead later in life.  The sympathy the characters evoke is, in large measure,dependent on the efforts of four gifted young British actors who succeed in communicating the raw nerves and psychological pain of these increasingly desperate men.  The stress of their undercover work fractures both their personal and professional lives.  Definitely not a good advertisement for a career as a spy!",1193961600,3,1032,5.2682926829268295
1887632,4,B00009PBTC,"For those like myself who were mystified by ""Blunt, the Fourth Man"" and ""Another Country"", this version of the story makes it all clear and understandable.  These brillilant young Britons were carried away by their abhorrence of fascisim and naively embraced the originally idealistic cause of communism until they gradually became Soviet agents and were too far immersed to break free. At last the story of these men is given a plausible reperesentation from their callow youth to their fateful ends in ignominy.  Toby Stephens and Samuel West are excellent, as is the rest of the cast as well.  Highly recommended for those interested in the history and politics of clandestine agents and traitors.",1193788800,3,700,5.12280701754386
1887633,5,B00009PBTC,"Historians may quibble over the accuracy of this TV miniseries; what can really be known for sure about the private lives of spies? But fans of British-made docudrama will not be disappointed. Following the careers of the so-called Cambridge spies, from the 1930s to the 1950s, these four hours of film provide an absorbing portrayal of espionage as experienced by the spies themselves, rather than in the objectively critical view of history and the news media. (The DVD gives a sample of that treatment in a History Channel program devoted to the subject and video recordings of news coverage marking their deaths.) Admittedly speculative and dramatized for popular consumption - was Kim Philby actually on the scene for the German bombing of Guernica? - its view of the four men is plausible enough, as their youthful anti-fascist idealism is put to use by the KGB.

While betraying their country, they had the amazing capacity to rise in the ranks to key positions in the post-war British espionage machine itself, a fact that the film attributes to the gullibility of men with old-school ties. Meanwhile, plenty of alcohol is poured and consumed, and there are steamy liaisons, which given the orientations of the four men, lean both left and right of center. The writing and the performances present strikingly individualistic portraits of the four spies. Anna-Louise Plowman is a strong presence as the American woman married to one of them and drawn romantically to another, and there are cameo performances by James Fox, Anthony Andrews, and  Imelda Staunton, the latter two as the King and Queen. The DVD includes commentaries by the director, writer, and producer of the series, plus additional features offering historical background.",1188172800,5,1746,5.144366197183099
1887634,3,B00009PBTC,"This is an entertaining account of the Cambridge Ring of spies recruited by the Soviets in the 1930s.

It struck me as a set of semi-fictional vignettes to tell a true story.

This sort of thing always disappoints me.  To me, the story is fascinating enough without embellishment or alteration.

It's worth seeing as a piece of entertainment, but not to be taken too seriously.

For those historically minded, the bonus disk with documentaries and some actual footage of the real spies is useful, but again a little disappointing.

It has a couple of interesting clips, but could have been more thorough.  It could have, for example, included the entire press conference when Philby denied being the 'Third Man'.  Instead, you get a 5 second grab. I'm not sure if the 1956 press conferencce with Burgess and MacLean was filmed, but Burgess' film with Tom Driberg in Moscow was not included in its entirety.  Again, only a 5 second grab.  Anthoy Blunt's 1979 interview is very interesting, but constitutes the only extended interview of the package.",1175558400,2,1048,4.903409090909091
1887635,4,B00009PBTC,"As a movie, Cambridge Spies is well-acted by a stellar cast, interestingly plotted, well-scripted, and beautifully filmed.  I enjoyed it very much.

Historically accurate?  Less so.",1168300800,4,181,5.884615384615385
1887636,4,B00009PBTC,"This 2003 BBC miniseries about the much-analyzed Cambridge spy ring of Burgess, Maclean, Philby and Blunt takes as sympathetic a view of the four as might be possible: they are represented as acting out of the highest ideals (a hatred for fascism and reactionary politics), and are shown to be extremely sympathetic men who suffer for their cause and who hold their friendship with one another among their highest ideals. This presents a very unusual take on the story that's rarely been seen before (except in the langurous but somewhat silly film ANOTHER COUNTRY). The production values are terrific, and some of the acting is quite good, especially from Tom Hollander, fittingly over the top as the brilliant but impossible narcissist Guy Burgess, and Samuel West, surpisingly hunky as the smooth and cautious Anthony Blount. The production values are excellent, and there are lovely cameos from Anthony Andrews as King George VI (struggling to overcome his speech impediment) and Imelda Staunton as his wife Queen Elizabeth, who slyly toys coversationally with Blount about his sexual preferences.

One of the best things about this DVD package is that it comes with a one-hour documentary from the History Channel about the Cambridge spy ring that takes almost the opposite take of the mini-series, presenting the spies are mercenary and corrupt and the entire Soviet system in as negative a light as possible. (The documentary also takes affirmative stands on questions concerning the spy ring the mini-series denies, such as the possibility of John Cairncross being the group's ""fifth man"" and the possible bisexuality of Donald Maclean.) The documentary is so righteous and portentous in its conservative editorializing that it seems almost astonishing it postdates the fall of the Berlin Wall; nonetheless, it provides a useful balance to the extremely sympathetic view the mini-series takes of four of the most demonized Englishmen of the twentieth century.",1141776000,37,1967,5.284345047923322
1887637,1,B00009PBTC,"This program is based on public statements made by the four people.  The details are filled in by the script writers.  This produces a double dose of fiction.

It is the consensus in the espionage community that the public statements are very inaccurate and are colored to make the four people appear to be more honorable than they were.

Then the script writers use their imaginations and they are not old enough to have lived as adults 70 years ago and are not familiar with the era.

One example of the colored statements is that they were fighting Adolph H.  This does not match with their continuing spying activities after 1945 when Adolph did not exist.

I suggest that instead you buy Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy available her on Amazon.  The author, David Cornwall, served in British Intelligence during the war.",1133740800,15,819,4.75886524822695
1887638,5,B00009PBTC,"This gripping, well-acted film launched me on a reading odyssey, beginning with Philby's ""My Silent War"" and including Seale and McConville's ""Philby: the Long Road to Moscow,"" G. Borovik's ""Philby Files,"" Yuri Modin's ""My Five Cambridge Friends"" (Y.M. was one of their KGB handlers),  Philip Knightley's ""Philby, the Life and Views of the KGB Master Spy"", and Miranda Carter's ""Anthony Blunt, His Lives"", among many others (some of which are less than sympathetic). As a result, I can appreciate the intense research that went into this outstanding TV series. The portrayals are brilliant: the subtle nuances of Toby Stephens' Philby; the ambiguity of Samuel West's Blunt; the vulnerability of Rupert Penry-Jones' Maclean; and finally, the brilliance of Tom Hollander's Burgess. Hollander's portrayal of the outrageous original is so convincing that when one reads Guy Burgess' actual quoted words, one 'hears' Tom Hollander.

  Moody and suspenseful, the drama dwells on a theme worthy of Sophoclean tragedy: the conflict between the obligations to oneself (friends and family) and the obligations to the State. Each of the characters, tragically flawed, reaches what seems to be the pinnacle of success, only to suffer a reversal of fortune and be cast down by outside events (here, the intrusion of the Cold War). The tragedy in Mr. Moffat's drama rests not in the fact that Philby, Blunt, Maclean and Burgess spied for the other side. These are mere plot points in an Aristotelian sense (although the repercussions on the State cannot be denied). The tragedy derives from the fact that as each man is compelled to betray his ideals, friends or family, he recognizes the enormity of that betrayal.

  The film is enhanced by a riveting musical score and by remarkable camera work, which not only effectively depicts England of the 'thirties and 'forties, but also defines the characters with a sinister juxtaposition of shadow and light. The lighting is especially effective in scenes portraying the enigmatic and (some say) duplicitous Anthony Blunt, whose face is often half-masked in deep shadow.

  The commentaries accompanying parts one and four of the series are equally fascinating, providing us with nuggets of information, such as the fact that Trinity College, Cambridge, would not allow its premises to be used for making a film about four of its most notorious graduates (The company was forced to film at King's College, next door.). Similarly, the Reform Club, the haunt of Jules Verne's fictional Phileas Fogg, refused admittance to the film company, because it did not want to advertise the fact that it had once named a double vodka and grapefruit juice a ""Double Burgess"", after one of its most irrepressibly rambunctious members, Guy Burgess.

We can only hope that Mr. Fywell and Moffat are planning a second series (The film-makers have already hinted at Philby's affair in Moscow with Melinda Maclean.). There are at least four more absorbing episodes: Philby's relentless grilling in London by MI5, his subsequent adventures in Beirut, his defection and miserable reception in Moscow, where he, like Burgess and Maclean, had to face the even colder reality of Russian Winters and the frost-bitten remnants of his utopian dreams, and finally Blunt's secret confession, promise of immunity, and eventual unmasking in London. Then the tragedy will be complete.",1105488000,82,3385,5.25
1887639,5,B00009PBTC,"This BBC-PBS T.V presentation is superb.  It is not something that you can look at while darning socks, knitting, washing dishes, talking on the phone or having an evening party-it is NOT light entertainment.  Go to commercial TV for that.  You've got to sit-down, shut-up and concentrate on what is going on.  In fact, it took me two viewings to fully understand what actually was going on.  LISTEN closely; the script is fantastic.
All of the actors are superb with Tom Hollander as Guy Burgess a standout.  The production is on a par with some of the best BBC productions that I have had the privilege of seeing.  With the gorgeous sets and costumes, it creates a feeling of the era that is being portrayed.

1887640,3,B00009PBTC,"The true story of the Cambridge spies is a fascinating chapter in the history of espionage but it is also a study in the English class system. Four upper class idealists who were rather ignorant about the system they were spying for  whilst betraying the system that allowed them wealth and opportunity out of reach of the common man.
This dramatization is too detailed on romance and does not focus on the real events enough. The amazing aspect is that they got away with it for so long but there should have been more explananation of the changing world events to illustrate this. The motivation of the four is never clear and the damage they caused is never  explained.
If you like English dramas, you will probably like this. But for me far too much time is dedicated to the love affairs of the group and even though you would expect a true story about espionage during world war II and the cold war would be thrilling and exhilarating this is rather dull and boring. Good acting, good direction but a bit too much soft focus.",1069977600,35,1030,4.532258064516129

All the principals are quite good though I go with the consensus that Tom Hollander as Guy Burgess steals the show. I was also taken with the atmosphere and sense of period: the clothes, furniture, music, London pubs, clubs and city parks, and most of all, Cambridge. Whatever its other virtues and flaws, Cambridge Spies is just plain beautiful to look at.
For me one of the joys was the sprinkling of several fetching cameos:  Anthony Andrews and Imelda Staunton as King George VI and the Queen in performances that come perilously close to caricature; James Fox as a stiff upper lip Lord Halifax; Kathryn Akin as a tight-assed U.S. Army officer whom the fey Anthony Blunt takes a shine to; John Guerrasio as a deliciously crusty Walter Bedell Smith; and most especially Marcel Lures as Philby's elegantly sinister Soviet handler Otto.",1410739200,,959,4.956521739130435

1887667,5,B00009PBTC,"Everything about Cambridge Spies is stellar. The acting is stunning, the writing penetrates the human soul, the pace is perfect. The story of Kim Philby and his three Cambridge companions is a familiar one, but here it's told from their perspectives -- personalized, humanized, making it possible for the viewer to understand and even sympathize with the four traitors who betrayed their nation but never their friends. The series evokes powerful emotions while creating the kind of tension you'd expect in a spy story.

The story pays special attention to the British attitude that made the spies successful -- they all went to Cambridge, they all wear the same school ties, so of course they are loyal to Britain. It wouldn't do to suspect them; it would be unseemly. But the story's success lies not just in its careful depiction of the social and political background that gave rise to the spies and delayed their detection. This is a story of four individuals who, motivated by misguided idealism, made choices that burdened and eventually consumed them. The drama of four unraveling lives is what makes the series so captivating.

The episodes have quite a bit of sexual content, both straight and gay, filmed tastefully but more explicitly than is common on American television. Viewers who want to be warned about that sort of thing are duly advised.",1353888000,4,1358,4.977973568281938
1887668,3,B00009PBTC,"My British friends relish spy stories and have initiated me into their intricacies.  This led me to begin collecting the BBC productions, which include such outstanding titles as Smiley's People.  With this, I think that the best is definitely in the past: the script has many holes, providing little solid information about what made these guys tick.  It also takes a rather sympathetic view of them as ambitious, youthful idealists, attracted to communism mostly as a way to fight fascism.  Oddly, it glosses over much of the real damage that they did, such as Philby's exposure of a counter-insurgency in Albania that cost hundreds of lives in an ambush.  Overall, it is stimulating and well acted with evocations of history, a good if not prime addition to a film library.

The story begins with the 4 as students.  They are rambunctious - the cold Blunt and flamboyant Burgess are overt homosexuals - while Philby is a womanizer; only McLean appears shy and introspective.  After some hesitation, they band together and subordinate their lives to spying for the USSR.  The personal conflicts and tragedies that this double life caused form the crux of the plot - lost love, stress leading to alcoholism, etc.  Another theme is the old-boys British public school culture, whereby those of the right breeding and  class can enter into the elite when they chose to do so:  all you need is the ""right tie"".  The elite also closes ranks on certain questions, such as the loyalty of the Cambridge grads, letting them escape.

As a result, what they actually did and even what motivated them at the deepest levels is largely left vague.  I was disappointed because I wanted to learn much more.  It also falls between genres, i.e. it isn't suspense, isn't history, and lacks the intrigue that makes spy stories such a fun puzzle.  Recommended with these caveats.",1337731200,,1859,4.888178913738019
1887669,1,B00009PBTC,"This is a multi-part BBC drama on the Cambridge spies. Four upper-class British men who spied for years for the Soviet Union against their own country. Its weakness is that it goes beyond being fair or presenting the point of view of the main characters to being an advocate for their beliefs/decisions.

The US and Great Britain during the 1930s-1950s are portrayed as neo-nazi states with long speeches designed to reinforce those views. The script needed, while still being fair, to challenge those views or at least show the contrasting position. The entire British establishment is shown as either nazis or fools. But the wartime government was not either of those things. Neither was the labor government after the war.

The critical mistake made, in my opinion, is in not showing the later lives of the spies in the Soviet Union. The grim reality of their lives there would effectively make them look like the fools they were. It also needed to show the self-deception of the spies as per the soviet union. The point could have been made in Spain where the stalinists often sabotaged the anti-Franco effort. It could have been made over the Soviet invasion of Poland or Finland. It could have been made over the worldwide ""peace"" campaign of communists against the ""imperialist war"" in 1939-1941. It could have been made over the show trials of the great terror in the Soviet Union or even over the assassination of Trotsky.

The writer seemed much more concerned with showing that everyone in 1930s and 1940s Britain was a nazi and giving the false impression that the only opposition to nazism in Britian were good communists.

The film also lets Philby off the hook too easy for the deaths that can be directly attributed to his actions as a spy. They have him laughing at one point about a parachutist going into Albania who will be killed. But its just not enough. Especially since we don't see the man die on screen.

Probably the worst moment in the series is toward the end when one of the characters goes on a drunken rampage through the american suburbs in his car. The rampage ends in a speech which the drama does not question or respond to. The proper response of would be to ask why anyone would care what a bunch of talentless rich snobs whose preoccupations are alcoholism and anonymous public sex thought about anything.

The only good point made by the series is to show how the class rules in Britain at that time allowed for certain people to live entirely outside of any control or restriction on their actions.",1325808000,12,2539,4.720090293453724

The tone is sympathetic - idealists waging war against fascism, but get snarled the web of a bigger game - but the programs capture the period and oftentimes strange political alliances that swirled as Europe dragged itself into what became a global war.

Actors Toby Stephens (Philby), Samuel West (Blunt), Rupert Penry-Jones (MacLean) and Tom Hollander (Burgess) provide outstanding portrayals of their characters. The vast 240 minutes  spanning two discs include a documentary that aired on the History Channel which covers the foursome as traitors, hence there is some balance within a historical - not entertainment - context.

Whether viewed as villains or products of a shadowy period driven by perceptions of good versus evil, this is a fascinating gaze into the rise and fall of the secret servants.",1224028800,5,1147,5.314917127071824
1887675,4,B00009PBTC,Video was well done from Cambridge to the final exposure.  Actors were superb and believable especially Toby Stephens and Tom Hollander.  The one problem I had was with the spies never aging in a period of 20+ years.  Even the porter at Cambridge aged when A. Blount returned looking as young as when he left.  It was important for me to have the trailer with the actual video of A. Blount admission.  I read Spycatcher by P. Wright after seeing this video; I'm amazed how much the British were able to accomplish in the Cold War with so many moles in their organization.

1887677,5,B00009PBTC,"This fine BBC docudrama depicts the lives of the four Cambridge spies from their university days, when they were recruited to do espionage work for the Soviet Union, through the defections of two of the four some twenty years later.  Kim Philby, Anthony Blunt, Guy Burgess, and Donald Maclean were members of Britain's upper class elite.  From prominent, well connected families, they were educated at some of the best public schools and then Cambridge University.  Their minds were as brilliant as their pedigrees, and they all seemed destined for the highest levels of diplomatic, social, and political careers.

Blunt and Philby, in public statements years after they were unmasked, all claimed that they became Communist spies in an attempt to better the world.  You do see a little of this desire to make things better in an incident near the beginning of the film, when Burgess and Philby foment a strike by the waiters at their college, but overall the four don't seem to have had much first hand knowledge of the people whose lives they claimed to want to improve through a Communist revolution.  The film does make clear the interesting point that the four were able to go about their espionage efforts for many years precisely because they were priviledged, elite people who knew all the right things to say and had entree into the highest circles.  The proverbial old boys club was hard at work for these four, and they knew it and used it.

At times the film seems to overglamourize the four, toning down the more sordid aspects of their lives (except in the case of the flamboyant and disreputable Guy Burgess) and barely acknowledging that they did real damage to Britain and the rest of the West through their espionage.  But its a well depicted and beautifully acted dramatic reenactment of one  episode in the Cold War.  The extra material provided on the second DVD is interesting as well, including interviews with Blunt and Philby after their unmaskings, BBC obituaries for Philby and Maclean, and a bizarre excerpt from a film about the Queen's Gallery in Buckingham Palace, made in the 1960s and partly narrated by Blunt himself.  (There's also a rather mediocre History Channel presentation about the Cambridge spies which provides a little more information about their lives and times.)",1214870400,7,2310,4.940568475452197
1887678,1,B00009PBTC,"The BBC has a long and honorable tradition of producing and airing fine dramas.  ""Cambridge Spies"" doesn't continue that tradition.  On the contrary, it looks exactly what it is:  a made-for-TV movie that takes a bad script, uninspired acting, and a low budget and makes from all of that a predictably awful film.  Instead of watching a BBC production, you'd swear you were watching something made for one of the American networks.

Why is ""Cambridge Spies"" so bad?  It's not because the film is pretty unhistorical.  I've never understood those people who complain that fictional works about historical events aren't more ""accurate.""  Surely no one watches historical drama for a history lesson (at least they shouldn't).

What makes the film so deadly is, first of all, terrible writing.  The script is full of sentimental one-liners, and seems utterly incapable of nuance or gradation (for example, the character McLean meets his future wife--horribly played by a no-talented Jenna Harrison--and woos, beds, marries, and rescues her from the Nazis in all of 5 minutes).  Sadly, the script got worse as the 4-part series progressed.

The poor quality of the script may account for the leaden acting displayed by virtually everyone in the film.  But one senses that a great deal of the film's flatness must be chalked up to untalented actors.  The above-mentioned Harrison is so utterly awful that watching her is embarrassing.  Tom Hollander as Guy Burgess has some very good moments, particularly in the first part of the series, but his portrayal becomes predictable and tedious (lots of shouting and histrionics).  Samuel West as Anthony Blount plays a character so tightly wound that he's in chronic danger of becoming unhinged.  But West's handling of the character reduces Blount to a rather sissified, simpering worry-wart.  Rupert Penry-Jones and Toby Stephens as Philby and McLean don't bear mentioning.  Both of them seem to have but one facial expression in their acting repertoir, and that a hangdog look of dejected worry.

All in all, a film to miss.",1208649600,9,2066,5.11044776119403
1887679,4,B00009PBTC,"Watching this for the first time as a fan of actor Samuel West, and author John Le Carre's spy novels, I was expecting a little more cloak and dagger. However, this interesting and more 'human' approach delved into the nature of how 4 idealistic young men became double agents in the spy game. I also enjoyed the series for the performances of some of the best British actors (some emerging, some established) of our generation.",1200528000,8,428,4.72
1887680,1,B00009PBTC,"I expected the BBC to skew the history of the Cambridge spies towards something romantically favorable to communist terror and butchery, but this one really went ""over the top"" as the Brits say.  Casting aside all historical fact, save for their names and little else, the BBC production mis-cast these four craven young men, filled with hatred for their homeland,  as idealists seeking to help the Soviet communist utopia, out of the goodness of their hearts -- ""for the sake of starving children"", etc.  By their words, Britain and America are described as decadent, money-grubbing capitalist, Nazi-craving hell-states, bound by insuperable class-barriers and homophobia.  Not a chance is missed to show these guys as idealist heroes, fighting for the greater good, and the hated society upon which they parasitically thrived as something wicked and nasty.  The impression is very clear also, this is not merely the opinions of the spy-boys, but of the BBC producers who give plenty of examples to validate those same negative impressions.  Nothing is presented to counter such a skewed and false vision, and the producers seemed to aim for a rehabilitation of the spy-boys, with a simultaneous villification of Western democracy.

Of course, the BBC is well-known today for doing exactly the same thing on its ""news"" reporting also -- use of selective reporting and lies of omission, praising, or at minimum ""understanding"" Islamic terror bombers by embracing jihadi propaganda and revisionist history, if not outright Jew-hatred, while blaming their dead victims for what happened to them.  Those who view the BBC broadcasts in the USA won't get the ""full monty"", as their international branches is where the most propagandist anti-freedom and pro-fascist sermons are delivered.  This mini-series lives down to that ""new BBC"" tradition.  It also seemed aimed at pushing homoerotic bedroom scenes into the livingrooms of ordinary BBC viewers, with the first segment being particularly rich in this measure.  No comparable heterosexual scenes appeared, even though two of the Cambridge spy-boys were claimed straight.  It is not a particularly complimentary view of the gay condition either, with Burgess chronically soliciting anonymous sex from public bathrooms, getting drunk and acting provocatively, unzipping his pants in the face of a fellow worker's shocked wife in one scene.  Was this all really relevant?  Perhaps, as an added factor of their hatred, of Blunt and Burgess, at least, towards Western heterosexual society.  Communism alone would suffice, however.  BBC doesn't touch those meaty topics, however, of their hatred of ordinary decent hard-working British and Americans, even when showing them willfully transmitting atomic bomb construction details to the Soviets.

To say that the Cambridge spies were idealistically ignorant of the butchery of Stalinism is the most profound Lie in the whole business.  No communist living outside of Antarctica could claim such ignorance much after the 1930s, especially with the Hitler-Stalin Pact and the subsequent invasion of Poland by the Nazis and Soviets (funny how most left-wing histories never mention the inconvenient fact that the Soviets also invaded Poland a few days after Hitler's whermacht, making sure to get their half of the Polish pie).  Too much BBC script-writing time was devoted to showing the spy-boys hand-wringing, lip-biting and anxiously furrowing their brows about the Hitler-Stalin Pact, when in reality they happily took their marching orders from Moscow without hesitation, and we know well how the left-wing idiots of those days went about ""explaining"" to everyone how the ""devil Hitler"" suddenly became a devoted Socialist, something which only the genius Stalin knew about (actually some have made a good argument Hitler was indeed a socialst, but I digress...).  Every decent Marxist or communist was out of the game by that time, writing their mea culpas and coming over fully to the center-point of Western democracy, as with George Orwell.  When the central characters are not smooching it up with each other, hugging in forced-crocodile tears when one of their ilk gets into trouble (but narry a tear for the hundreds they sent to early graves), then the film treats the viewer to angry or drunken ranting speeches by the characters, denouncing Western democratic society.  This is more than just ""character portrayal"" but is a ""message from the BBC producers"".

Virtually everyone who is not a communist spy is either (take your pick): 1) a low-class idiot, 2) a filty capitalist pig, 3) a Nazi-enthusiast, 4) a homophobe, or 5) an upper-class idiot, wallowing in inherited money, who is happy when poor children are starving to death.  Oh, and Americans, we are racists and atomic-bombing religious fanatics also, on top of all else.  Did I miss anything?  The summary statement of the BBC producers, and probably authentically of the Cambridge spy-boys as well, was the scene when Guy Burgess drives his car through the front yards of a half-dozen ordinary American homes, smashing everything and then giving a speech from the roof of his car, denouncing their contemptible ""picket fences"" and ""capitalism"" and so forth.  Everyone is denounced as a member of the Ku Klux Klan (which for all its grim theatre and murdering, never killed so many innocents in a hundred years as Comrade Lenin did in one, or Comrade Stalin did in one good day), or worse, and so on.  On that scene, one got a very real sense of authentic emotion in the production.  One can only hope the average decent viewer will come away thinking that communists are drunken and revolting treacherous parasites.

The only decent thing in this production was a separate History Channel item which gives a factual overview of the Cambridge spies, and thereby not surprisingly conflicts with much of the BBC production. Another documentary section provides old news footage of Blunt ""explaining"" why he did what he did -- but of course, not one interview with anyone who goes down a list showing the damage they did to the West, nor how many lives were lost, those who were directly murdered because of these ""spy-boys"".  Once again, the BBC shows it is more loving of Red Fascist causes than of Western freedoms, and will happily turn such miserable Red-fanatics into ""misunderstood idealists"", no matter what the body-count.",1197763200,24,6395,5.2158203125

7992240,5,B00009PBTC,"The world is in turmoil at the rise of ferocious right wing populists. An unpopular war has scarred the mass psyche of people on both sides of the Atlantic. Young people angrily reject the cautious centrism of their elders and believe in only in a false choice between destructive, prejudice-infused far right political parties and suicidally ideological far left ones. A hostile foreign power is influencing politics in the western world. A dangerous ideological minority of young people are at risk of being recruited by radical entities to fight in a bloody foreign war.

And it's all set in the 1930s and 1940s in the colleges of Cambridge and the halls of the British government. This is the story of Kim Philby and his classmates turned colleagues - and co-conspirators. All study together while devoted to Communist ideology that will inform their decisions even as they leverage their status to become movers and shakers in high society. The hypocrisy of their circumstances - savoring the fruits of privilege while trying to tear it down - should not be lost on the audience. Their betrayal is treated with tragic sympathy - they have legitimate gripes about inequality in the US and U.K., taking those concerns to their logical extreme. Particularly tragic is the fall of Guy Burgess, a barely closeted gay man who is a victim of his society's homophobia and sees it leveraged as classist punishment against any of the working class who step out of line. But this does not make their treason any less of a tragedy. Their lives are lived in fear and the ending lets us know that most of the five live out an unhappy life once they are exposed as traitors and defectors.

This series is beautifully strong on atmosphere. The BBC has dispensed with stage set style designs, showing real places as they might look, tinted with a sense of the neo-noir: the sets and costumes have all the ingredients of a sexy, alluring setting, which we see through veils of smoke, liquor, and intimacy as we see following our hard drinking, hard smoking, oversexed and hypocritically privileged protagonists.

This miniseries is a truly beautiful and stunning production, with plenty of relevance to the confusion in the world today as it is threatened by loudmouthed demagogues, foreign extremists and fake news, and the opinionated political convictions of disaffected youth.

before the start of World War 2  The communist efforts to grow in England are busy recruiting young people to spy for the KBG and Philby, Blunt,  Burgess and MacLean are decided to do it to make the world a better place against the Nazi Fascism. As they soon place themselves in the highest levels of government they continue to pass on secrets. Burgess and Blunt are openly homosexual and struggle with the loss of lovers. The degree of success is amazing since the English Class Systems makes them above suspicion. Blunt and Philby are the leaders and Burgess and MacLean become alcoholics and are soon cracking under the mental strain of being a spy. Blunt retires and is given the job for the Queen. Burgess and MacLean and Philby end up in the United States working as diplomats. The newly formed CIA slowly is decoding Soviet Messages from World War 2 they are getting closer to finding one spy~ MacLean aka Homer.  MacLean and Burgess end up back in England where the decision is to defect to the Soviet Union since they are being suspected of spying and may soon be arrested.  Their emergence in Moscow has everyone looking at their best friend~ Kim Philby.  Philby is sent to the middle east where he continues to claim he is innocent but eventually he also defects.  Blunt who is under suspicion makes a 'plea deal of immunity"" when he gives up the stories of Burgess, MacLean and Philby. This is an excellent look at each spy. How when they start spying they have to continue. The scene stealer here is Tom Holland who plays the brilliant drunkard gay Burgess perfect. This is a well done movie and holds the interest. Best if you watch it twice. Added bonus is actual video on the Bonus set for an interview of Blunt who continues to deny any responsibility and look at Philby who had the charm of a liar that everyone liked. 5 stars~",1503878400,3,1913,4.527536231884058
