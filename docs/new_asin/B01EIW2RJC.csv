7736234,5,B01EIW2RJC,it came and worked perfectly for me and the sound quality was good,1477094400,,66,4.153846153846154
7736235,3,B01EIW2RJC,"Disappointing audio. I bought this series and season 2 because I wanted the dubbed version so the audio is very important to me. Well the audio is very low on the blu-rays (did not watch dvds). I have to turn the volume up over twice my normal value for tv/streaming/other blu-ray and dvds. This occurred on another recent funimation purchase. The soundtrack is fine its the dubbing that is washed out and so turning up the volume only goes so far, because it still doesn't pump the voices over the music. Everything else (subbing, picture, story) is fine.",1470096000,3,556,4.683673469387755
7736236,5,B01EIW2RJC,"Great show, the same idea as the ""complete series"" at a lower price.  Save yourself some money and order this instead",1469836800,,117,4.571428571428571
8758858,5,B01EIW2RJC,A fun and entertaining series that had me laughing. I truly enjoyed this so much that as soon as I finished the first season I bought the second. It's a romantic comedy with a supernatural spin that's a great watch.,1529971200,,215,4.4
8758859,5,B01EIW2RJC,"This was a good series. My only complaint was the ending was a bit odd. if you watch you will understand.
There is a bit of comedy but the focus is on the story and I think that was well done.
It seemed to be for a bit younger audience but I still enjoyed the anime.
If this was not on SAVE I would probably not have purchased it and not sure I would spend money for the non save edition after watching however I would recommend this for anyone who likes the romantic comedy type anime.",1514937600,,486,4.020618556701031

8758862,4,B01EIW2RJC,"Beautiful Anime, but the second DVD came scratched even though I ordered it new....I could hardly watch it without it messing up,",1499212800,,129,4.909090909090909
8758863,5,B01EIW2RJC,So I only recently got into this series I sampled the show on Hulu and I was pretty well hooked right away had to own the series and so I checked it out here and saw that there was a S.A.V.E edition that was a blu-ray/DVD combo pack and looking at the price point I didn't see how I could turn that down. I personally have never purchased anything from Funimations S.A.V.E catalog so I was kind of not sure what to expect. If the green S.A.V.E stripe down the side of the spine bothers you then its reversible for display purposes. The DVD and Blu-ray discs are all good  it has all the extras like the textless openings and endings and the commentaries tracks so don't think because its S.A.V.E that you are getting screwed out of that stuff. Really happy to own this set and can't wait to purchase season 2 when I can.,1497052800,4,820,4.256410256410256
