8536669,5,B0096EZHZO,I ordered this for a couple that live in England.  They have visited the Grand Canyon but had never heard of this piece.  They were ecstatic to receive this.  I was a bit leery because I did not know if it would work on their equipment but it performed just fine.  I may have to order another one for ourselves.,1478217600,,311,4.133333333333334

8536673,5,B0096EZHZO,"Having been down the Colorado through the Grand Canyon, I can appreciate the scope of this film - it's an amazing series of images of the river corridor through the full range of seasons. The music is of course an American classic, no matter who plays it - there may be ""better"" versions of the music, but the film is cut to the music so expertly it's hard to imagine a better pairing. I think Disney did a version of this many years ago on TV, maybe as a cartoon? But I can play this on my DVD and show my children, and grandchildren, what the Grand Canyon is all about.",1396137600,2,571,4.153153153153153
8536674,3,B0096EZHZO,"I was curious to see how the images of the Grand Canyon and the music fit together. I used a laptop and earbuds so I can't address sound quality, but I found the images familiar from my travels in the southwest US and the music was relaxing. If I wanted to wind down from a busy day, or if I needed to show some calming images to my patients, i would choose this 32 minute DVD. It's very zen, because there is no plot or purpose, and you just watch the streams, petroglyphs, red rock formations, and are soothed. The Grand Canyon and its environs exhibit different moods depending on the season and the time of day. As long as you just sit back and experience the natural beauty, without any expectations, I think you will be satisfied. It is not high def, and it feels very retro (like backpacking in the '80's).",1370131200,5,813,4.3202614379084965
8536675,1,B0096EZHZO,This is pretty bad. The cinematography is uneven at times grainy with video noise especially in sky. After you listen to this masterpiece put on a CD and you will find that the music accompanying this video is of poor quality both in terms of musical performance and audio quality. In short this is about as amateuristic as it gets. What a shame.,1365984000,2,346,4.507936507936508
