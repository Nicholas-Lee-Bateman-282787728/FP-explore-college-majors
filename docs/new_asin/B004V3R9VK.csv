8442871,5,B004V3R9VK,"This is a great video for both adults and kids-- it works on just about any level!  My 11 year old grand daughter is really into baby birds and she's in love with this video-- amazingly it works as well for my 3 year old grand daughter. Wonderful close-up photography and clear narration, but the best part is something that can be watched and enjoyed together by a group of mixed ages. Also have 'How Birds Eat' by the same people, it's equally good!",1302480000,,451,4.369047619047619
8442872,5,B004V3R9VK,"I bought all three Nature Flix Production DVD's including Chick Flick for my son and daughter, ages 3.5 and 1.5.  The format is geared towards young open minds willing to be captivated by amazing images and clear and concise narration.  Each video has a clear theme and explains concepts in a simple, straightforward manner making it very palatable to my 3 year old.  He has been watching these videos since he was a toddler engaged by the vivid imagery and is now enjoying them for the interesting knowledge he's gained.  I was having trouble finding nature videos for kids that didn't mask the inherent entertainment value of nature itself with song and dance and cartoon characters.  I never feel guilty playing these videos for my children because they are truly learning about the world around them in an intelligent way.  This series is a refreshing take on nature education for children and one that even we adults can enjoy and learn from.",1302048000,,947,4.814814814814815
