2770095,5,B000NJM6E6,"This is a powerful documentary. As well it should be. The awesome power of GOD, demonstrated through a low life, a nobody, who became somebody, and is not ashamed to tell everybody, what GOD can do. Doesn't matter whether Jew or Greek, black or white, red or brown, male nor female. For we are all one in Christ Jesus, Gal. 3:28.
This DVD belongs in your library. And do what I do. Pass it around to your friends. Better yet, buy a couple extra and give them out as Christmas presents. I have. Thank you. And may GOD bless!",1257379200,2,523,4.292929292929293
2770096,5,B000NJM6E6,"I really enjoyed this documentary. I have seen Danny Trejo in movie after movie and only knew him as a really scarey looking guy who for the most part made a living in Hollywood playing the heavy. This documentary goes back and tells about his upbringing and how he got on the wrong path that lead him to spend several years in prison. Trejo's story could easily have stopped there but it is a story of a man who discovered himself and the right path and took it.

Very good documentary for movie lovers and I think should be shown to a lot of young kids because it shows what going down the wrong path can get you and that it is never to late to change.",1229558400,7,654,4.149606299212598
2770097,5,B000NJM6E6,"Danny Trejo is living proof that people who have a real desire to turn their lives around can do just that. As a woman who met him 25 years ago, I can only say with complete gratitude in my heart, that he totally inspired me to get and stay celan and sober. Thank you Danny! And thank you for making this documentary film. It is a tribute to you and all of us ex-jailbirds that are in a 12-step program.",1217030400,11,403,4.05
2770098,5,B000NJM6E6,"This DVD was awesome. Danny Trejo is an inspiration for all of us. This documentary was written, produced and shot very well. It chronicles Danny Trejo's entire life from childhood to the present.  It covers his struggle with drugs, criminal activity, and eventually Prison.

After you view this excellent dvd you will have a newfound respect for this former criminal turned actor/drug counselor.",1213574400,7,396,5.26984126984127
2770099,5,B000NJM6E6,"This is a really interesting documentary about the life or Hollywood heavy Danny Trejo. If you are a fan of his work as one of the most recognizable villians in Hollywood today or not you will like this documentary. Danny is a true rags to riches 'American Dream' story. Danny was a real life villian and a real bad dude. He talks about growing up in a bad neighborhood and how his family influences took him down the wrong path that ended up with him doing drugs and serving hard time in a couple of real life hardcore prisons.

This documentary is full of great interviews with famous Hollywood actors that worked with Danny. Also the film crew takes him back to prison and to his very cell that he lived in for years. It is a powerful thing to see and it is a great documentary to watch.",1187395200,3,790,4.302013422818792

2770106,5,B000NJM6E6,I am a drug counselor and always in search of better ways to reach my clients. They are great people and I am highly privileged and honored to work with them. I can say with great satisfaction that this piece ('Champion' a documentary about Danny Trejo's addiction) of work is very original and real. I am very impressed that it lives up to my expectation and more. My clients can relate to the experiences of drug problems of Danny Trejo and more importantly Danny's substance use problems' story gives my clients hopes and reasons to believe that drug addiction is treatable and people do recover from drug addiction. The story sums up and supports the beliefs expressed by many professionals and treatment providers that people can have drug free life after addiction. People recovering from drug problems can go on to be successful in life. My clients are able to say to me from watching the documentary that healing is really within any suffering drug addicts reach. I personally will add that Danny Trejo's story made a believer out of skeptics who are in doubt about the possibility of healing and recovery from the disease of chemical dependency and addiction. It is a must see documentary for persons with drug and alcohol problems.,1397779200,,1241,4.830985915492958
2770107,5,B000NJM6E6,"Actually I didn't expect this movie to be what it was.  I expected it to be life-story re-enactments, with Mr. Majestic  (oops, I mean Mr. Trejo--sorry but he reminds me a bit of tough guy Charles Bronson) only coming in at the end when he would re-enact his boxing championships in the prisons where they took place. That was not at all what it turned out to be.

Instead it was a very long filmed interview with Mr. Trejo as he walked through locations from his past including San Quentin. I sat practically mesmerized, literally unable to breathe while watching this movie--which was quite impressive considering I had to watch it on a 4 INCH square screen.  Very few movies affect me that way or hold my attention so raptly.  You'd think that would be boring, but it was fascinating and hypnotizing--even though a hypnotist once told me that I can not be hypnotized because I am too strong minded.(He said that like that was a BAD thing!!!) Mr Trejo was very candid about what he'd done and his addictions and the time he spent in prisons and reformatories and juvenile detention centers.

What was very impressive to me was that he never blamed anyone like his parents or his partner in crime uncle who was his ""example"" albeit a bad one.  He only blamed himself for the trials (including court ones) and tribulations that he suffered in his young and troubled years.  Instead, he accepted responsibility for what he did, paid the price, and even expressed remorse for those he hurt. What we must remember however, is that Mr. Trejo is a product of his whole life, not just the GOOD parts.  It is clear that he paid dearly for his mistakes, and now continues to pay back.  Fortunately for the rest of us who share the world with him, he is now a shining example of good and giving. No one has a bad thing to say about this man and he speaks no ill of anyone.

What touched my heart deeply was his reaction to the memories spawned by the locations from his past. It made me cry.  The filming of this interview really took a toll on Mr. Trejo.  You could see his feelings surfacing through his ultra tough-guy visage many times. Don't get me wrong, Mr. Trejo would be a force to be dealt with if he chose that path. Even though I have never broken a law in my life, or taken illegal drugs or even gotten drunk (yes I am a pretty boring individual), this movie brought me to tears. This truly is a movie that everyone, including those with drug and alcohol problems and also ex-cons should watch.  Mr. Trejo's face tells his story.

If I ever got the chance to meet this man, I would consider it an honor, Plus, I can't think of another nearly 70 year old man that I would like to see with out a shirt from time to time. (Do you hear that, producers of Saint George?)",1397606400,,2769,4.391389432485323
2770108,3,B000NJM6E6,A nice tale of rags to riches. Mr trejo seems very humble and happy to give back. So sad all the people that lose their lives to this disease and the sad familial aspects that lead an uncle to shoot up his 12 yr old nephew.,1395187200,,223,3.869565217391304
2770109,5,B000NJM6E6,This documentary is a must see for anyone new in recovery. Danny Trejo's story is a proof that no one is beyond redemption.,1391731200,,123,4.391304347826087
2770110,5,B000NJM6E6,"I met Johnny Trejo and have met him several times when he gives interviews to groups. I find him to be a really nice guy. I think it would be a good film to show to ""gang members"" or at risk youth; however, having been a gang worker years ago, some would just ""blow it off"" since they would be different(uh-huh) but worth a try!

I do find it important to me...to me that he is a ""believer"" and yes I know--there are no atheists in prison --but he has turned his life around and I truly admire him.

He was asked in an interview,' How do you reconcile the fact that all your characters are violent?"" He said that he will not take a role where the bad guy wins. I am not sure that is the case in all his movies but in most I have seen, that is the case. You can correct me if I am wrong(there are always exceptions).

But overall, I like the movie and have bought several copies and given them to a number of people: Priests, Pastors, Homies and movie buffs. This is just one man's opinion who grew up in the ""Barrio"" worked in the Barrio and other areas in which I spent years volunteering.",1390003200,,1090,4.08411214953271
2770111,4,B000NJM6E6,"Powerful, touching and inspirational true life story of criminal and ex-con turned actor and youth counselor, Danny Trejo. Many of us have seen Danny in films like Michael Mann's Heat, and Robert Rodriquez movies like Desperado and From Dusk till dawn, but few of us know the incredible story of Danny's life growing up in Los Angeles, using drugs like Heroin, being a gang member, and commiting robberies. The events of his younger years landed him in prison. And there Danny grew even tougher and more violent until he ended up in solitary confinement. There he reflected on the tragedy of his life and the bad choices he made. From that time on Danny decided to go straight and change his life. Danny Trejo himself tells the incredible story of how he turned from being a criminal to helping others and inspiring them. So much so that helping others is his greatest passion, while acting is a lesser passion. Interviews with friends Steve Buscemi, Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Eddie Bunker, Robert Rodriquez and others, reflect on their memories and experiences with this extraordinary individual. I have always liked Trejo as an actor, but this documentary reveils there is far more to this man than just a simple actor. Riveting from start to finish.",1368144000,2,1253,4.887323943661972
2770112,2,B000NJM6E6,"I knew a bit about Danny Trejo's story and was excited to learn more.
I felt the documentary was shot and cut poorly and came off as very amateur.
Danny's story was heartfelt and compelling but the portrayal of it went long and missed some moments that could have been very impactful.
Overall a dissapointment.",1364860800,,310,4.654545454545454
2770113,5,B000NJM6E6,I have enjoyed Danny Trejo's work for many years and was very interested in his true background-he pulls no punches in this documentary and is very honest about his early years as a criminal and drug addict--he's to be commended for turning his life around so successfully--and he's witty and interesting as well,1358294400,,312,4.90566037735849
2770114,5,B000NJM6E6,"This is HardCore Storytelling, without the Reenactment.  I have been a fan of Trejo's forever, and it is not well known, that he is a drug counselor, and has been since before the movie business got to him.  When you hear him talk about his Uncle Gilbert, and all the violence and drugs he grew up around, then give that signature crooked smile, and laugh, it is hard to imagine anyone being able to do so. This is really a Great story, told by him, and has a few guest stars.  Probably something High School students should see, and try to learn from.  Champion gets the title, True O.G.",1317254400,,588,4.36697247706422
2770115,5,B000NJM6E6,"Great documentary.  If you like Danny Trejo you will love this.  When they take him back to prison to do the movie he is ok talking outside, but when he goes back to his old cell, you can tell he is having flashbacks.  It looks like he is trying not to break down.  This is a definite must.",1296000000,,290,3.9482758620689653
2770116,5,B000NJM6E6,The DVD was exactly what I wanted and it came in great condition.  Good documentary on the life of Danny Trejo.  A must see for anyone who is at risk of going to prison.,1293753600,,169,3.9411764705882355
2770117,3,B000NJM6E6,"Danny Trejo has an interesting and inspiring story. However, this documentary was very badly made in telling that story. The questions are shallow, the flow is all over the place, the score is lacking, etc.. What has to potential to be a moving and inspiring documentary is instead a dragging and boring one. In the hands of a good documentary director.. Trejo's life can be better portrayed.",1279497600,2,392,4.865671641791045
2770118,3,B000NJM6E6,"Champion is an interesting documentary detailing Danny Trejo's life story. Trejo was born into a tough Los Angeles neighborhood. He tried marijuana when he was eight and shot heroin for the first time at twelve. Eventually, he landed in San Quentin prison.

The remarkable part of his story came afterward. Trejo became a drug counselor and helped kids avoid the mistakes that he had made. Then, a series of lucky breaks led Trejo into films, where he makes a nice living as a character actor. In Champion he shares some of his philosophy about life. Trejo is a very likeable person.

I like Champion, but it wanders off course at times. The film comes uncomfortably close to glorifying violence. Champion is supposed to be about redemption from violence but - let's face it - vice is more interesting than virtue. The filmmakers just couldn't resist including Trejo's great, bloody stories.

Bizarrely, Trejo often appears with his shirt open so that the camera can lovingly zoom on his ""tats."" I had the feeling that someone should ask, ""Why don't you button your shirt?"" Instead, everyone pretends it's normal for a 60-ish man to conduct interviews with his belly hanging out.

The film also includes interviews with celebrities such as Dennis Hopper and Val Kilmer. The film would have been better without these boring clips.

I recommend Champion, but I do think that the film has a few flaws.",1272585600,2,1398,4.881856540084388

Trejo's story is fascinating and many folks can relate to what he has experienced in his life. In some ways he smashes some of the stigma associated with being addicted and a criminal as he is so well-loved as an actor now. The film is well done and Trejo's humility and grace is inspiring to anyone that watches.",1488240000,,434,4.506329113924051
