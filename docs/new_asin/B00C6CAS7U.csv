8577675,5,B00C6CAS7U,"Great bluray. Great team. Clarkson, May, and Hammond are funny then ever and Africa is worth the price of admission for this blu ray adventure. Must buy for fans of Top Gear UK",1398729600,,176,4.363636363636363
8577676,4,B00C6CAS7U,"The Top Gear has previously done a special in Africa when they went to Botswana however, as James May noted in that earlier special 'Africa is quite large' and so there was plenty scope for the team to return to the continent.

Effectively this special takes a very large leaf from the book of the earlier adventures whereby the chaps have to take cheap second hand cars on a journey they really were not ever designed to undertake. In this case the guys have to take estate cars (known as station wagons to others) on a journey to find the source of the Nile River.

Those who know the style of the show will be able to guess that there will be shenanigans aplenty along the way, stupidity both ad-lib and scripted and in the end the question is will the cars survive the carnage?

Beautifully shot this special sees the team in good form in terms of appreciating the countryside around them and the adventure overall and even the pseudo serious reason for the trip has some genuine interest factor. All up this is a good buy for the Top Gear fan. Having said that if you are buying each series as it comes out you'll end up getting this anyway as it was not a stand-alone adventure but done within the confines of a series.",1398297600,2,1225,4.387665198237886
8577677,5,B00C6CAS7U,So much fun to watch. Can't believe they put themselves through that. The cars was a mess at the end of show,1389744000,,108,3.9545454545454546
8577678,5,B00C6CAS7U,"I'm not gonna give this awesome show one star because of my own stupidity, I'm not gonna be that guy, but still I feel completely disappointed for not being able to watch the blu-ray I just bought because of stupid region limitations. I'm sure the special is top notch, full of wise gags from them blokes at their best, but who knows? I can't watch it... So don't be such a moron as I was, check for disc region limitations before you buy...",1377648000,6,441,4.325301204819277
