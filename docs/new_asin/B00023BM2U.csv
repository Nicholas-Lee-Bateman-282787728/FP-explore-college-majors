8021073,2,B00023BM2U,"I happen to like Bing Crosby.  I thought that this was going to be a documentary about his rise to fame.  It turned out to be a ""pseudo-documentary"" with excerpts from some old Max Sennett movie footage.",1477612800,,203,4.45945945945946

8021075,1,B00023BM2U,"A narrator who cannot look at the camera and seems to be reading the lines very stiffly is just the beginning of this dog of a film. The sound of the early talkies is very poor, unhearable in places. The film editing is amateurish. Only watch if you are the world's greatest Bing Crosby fan.",1417824000,,291,4.3090909090909095

8021077,2,B00023BM2U,"The draw of this faux documentary is rare footage from Bing Crosby's early days in Hollywood. The scenes come from a handful of Max Sennett slapstick films. The ""host"" is simply awful, and there's a cringeworthy blackface scene that probably gave Crosby nightmares in his later years. But the film offers a handful of Crosby's better early moments - along with a few songs - that will please die-hard fans.",1405641600,,406,4.814285714285714
8021078,2,B00023BM2U,"The Road To Hollywood is an ersatz 1947 feature film assembled (and very stiffly narrated) by Bud Pollard from four Bing Crosby short subjects made in the 1930s at the Mack Sennett studios. That would make it worthwhile viewing for Bing fans if Pollard had just presented the shorts as a straightforward collection of shorts or as a Robert Youngson-style highlight reel. Instead, Pollard recut and reshuffled the footage in a woefully misguided attempt to build a story out of the footage about Crosby's rise to fame and the studio saddled the sorry mess with a title and an ad campaign that tricked people into thinking it was a new Bing film. The thing that breaks what Pollard is attempting to do is that none of the films have any on-screen talent in common except Bing (for that matter, only two of the shorts even share the same director). The disorienting result is that the cast and setting changes completely every few minutes and the action is kind of hard to follow at times, which is bad news if we're supposed to act like the movie is a single story.

If you're a fan of golden-age Hollywood, the shorts that make up The Road To Hollywood are worth tracking down in their original state. The Road to Hollywood itself, on the other hand, is more interesting for what it represents than what's actually on the screen.",1380240000,5,1328,4.627118644067797
