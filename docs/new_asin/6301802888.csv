7815680,5,6301802888,"i watched spider-man: the deadly dust, parts one and two, for the first time in many years. totally wonderful. a trio of students, out to prove how easy it is to build a bomb as a means of exposing the military industrial complex and their own university's apathy, swipe some plutonium, build an atom bomb, and promptly have it stolen. everyone suspects peter because, of course, he's the only one anyone believes is actually smart enuf to do the deed. so peter, mr. jameson, and the ridiculously gorgeous joanna cameron of isis fame as miami reporter gayle hoffman, head out to LA to try and save the world.

there are many things that make the deadly dust first rate. we really get a good dose of the brilliant, impassioned scientist that is peter parker. from arguing against the university handling plutonium in the first place, to breaking down the potential ramifications to the police and feds, here we get a legitimate scientist in peter, something the movies really only pay lip service to. i believe that nicholas hammond knows what he's talking about when he says the dust might turn unstable do to collapsing density, and that he really is against nuclear power. and who should know more about the dangers of radiation than peter parker, reluctant, radioactive spider-bite victim?

it is here, while trying to deflect gayle's desire to procure an interview with his alter-ego, that peter launches into a stan lee-esque soliloquy about the moral drive and the loneliness--he imagines--that spider-man feels being a superhero. ""do you realize,"" he asks the rapt gayle, ""that he has to lie to everyone he knows? how could anyone ever really get to know him?"" gayle gives him a knowing look and says ""i doubt spider-man could have said it better himself."" nicholas hammond is really good, and i like the exploration of a spider-man who is driven from the get go to use his powers responsibly, not because anyone died due to his inaction to teach him the lesson, but because he already knew it.

the episode ends with a very strong implication that peter is gonna get a little nookie time with gayle, and the two deserve each other: resourceful, tenacious, and caring, these two forgotten teevee characters from the seventies deserve the happiness that they likely bring one another.

another element that can't go unmentioned, it is in the live-action show where spidey actively uses his spider tracers, a nice element of the comic totally left out of the movies. it speaks to peter's scientific intellect, something this show does consistently.",1425600000,,2553,4.902777777777778
7815681,4,6301802888,"While basically a horrible series especially when compared to Kenneth Johnson's ""The Incredible Hulk"", this is one of the few episodes of Spider-Man that is worth getting other than ""The Chinese Web"" (known as The Dragon's Challenge in overseas markets). It is the way Spider-Man in a believable form should've been. If only the same writers that did ""Deadly Dust"" could've did the other episodes, the series might've lasted as long as The Hulk did!
Anyway, The Deadly Dust is definitely worth the money!",1069891200,,504,5.011904761904762
