You would pay MORE if the DVDs were sold individually.

The real treat in this DVD box set is the DEATH BY MISADVENTURE documentary.
It presented some information I never knew before because they were not mentioned in most of the other documentaries about BRUCE LEE.
Another treat is the YOUNG BRUCE LEE DVD.  It shows some of BRUCE's early movies before he became known as an ACTION HERO.",1336003200,,420,4.5131578947368425
8019736,5,B00020W00Q,"This set has the most rare footage of any other set about Bruce Lee.

Death by Misadventure is the most riveting docu on Bruce I've ever seen.

No punches pulled and lots and lots of unseen footage.

It has childhood movies never seen before and awesome demos of Bruce doing Wing Chun and his historic demo on Hong Kong t.v. which landed him his Big Boss role.

Bonus features galore including extended interviews with his doctors,friends and students.

Top of the line.

Young Bruce Lee has tons of footage from his childhood films and clips from all his movies.

Terrific bonus features from his first student including a tour of Seattle and another piece on a Bruce Lee Museum in China.

Fist of Unicorn is very rare.

Bruce is only in it a few minutes but the bonus section makes up for that.

A great docu with lots of footage is included plus an awesome stills gallery with unseen photos.

Also his stuntmen talk about working with him. Greta great stuff there!

Bruce Lee True Story is probably the best Bruce Li bio film.

Here they present it with an audio commentary with Joe Hyams, Jow Lewis and George Tan.

The extras are great.

This is a fantastic package for such a low price.

Don't miss this!!!",1148601600,2,1212,4.516129032258065
