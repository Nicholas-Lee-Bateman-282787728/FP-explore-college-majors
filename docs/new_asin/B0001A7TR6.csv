8008976,5,B0001A7TR6,Great video to get kids into yoga and meditation! Makes a great gift too!,1476489600,,73,4.285714285714286
8008977,4,B0001A7TR6,"This video was very creative in having the children pretend to be different animals to get them into some common yoga poses, along with the instructor and other children of various ages.  The only drawback is the instructor herself, I found her voice (tone not accent) and facial expression (she only has one) a little strange, at times distracting from the exercise, even my four year old commented on the strange lady.  We've only done it once, so I'm hoping she'll get accustomed to it and be able to focus more on doing the poses which are presented with a great technique.",1302307200,,577,4.647058823529412
8008978,5,B0001A7TR6,"My son loves the songs on the 1st dvd. We haven't watched this 2nd one a lot yet, but it is the same style of cute & fun yoga moves & songs. I am very glad I purchased both volumes.",1265760000,,181,3.55
8008979,5,B0001A7TR6,Children 12 and under love to stretch out with this. They put it on themselves.,1203120000,,79,4.333333333333333
8008980,4,B0001A7TR6,THis is a great beginning yoga dvd!  It held my children's attention with the little cartoons in between and I think my kids will have a better understanding of yoga because of it.  I do the workout with my kids and I feel very stretched out afterwards!  I am going to start using it with my Kindergarten class!  I definitely recommend it!,1099526400,4,339,4.419354838709677
8008981,5,B0001A7TR6,"This is another great yoga tape for kids from Wai Lana.

With the little animations and songs it holds their interest & makes it fun and exciting.

My 3 yr old son loves this yoga tape and his cousin who is 8 also loves it and does it.  Which just goes to show how long it will be useful!! (and then of course there are all our younger cousins to pass it on to - I wonder if they'll still have dvd's by the time I've got grandkids? :)

Buy it, it's fantastic.",1096070400,3,459,3.903225806451613
