7719147,5,B01DL6PBOO,"I bought the 5 movie collection specifically for the movie ""Sunset.' I love this movie. It has  action, gunfights, love story, lots of bad guys and two of my favorite stars, Bruce Willis and James Garner. James Garner plays Wyatt Earp and Bruce Willis plays silent movie great, Tom Mix. The movie is set in 1927 Hollywood when Wyatt Earp agrees to be an advisor on a movie Tom Mix is starring in . The action begins when Earp arrives and keeps building until the end. Great movie. The 5-pack also includes ""Old GRINGO "". This movie stars Gregory Peck as retired journalist Ambrose Bierce, who disappeared in Mexico and was never seen again. In this movie he goes to Mexico looking for meaning to life. Bierce was suffering from depression his whole life . While in Mexico he falls in with the revolutionaries and tags along with them. The movie also stars Jimmie Smits. It is a good movie. All the Pretty Horses has Matt Damon and friends heading to Mexico to look for work. Things get bad when a love interest enters the picture. Lots of action, good movie.  Don't Come Knocking is about an actor that used to be on top but has fallen on hard times. He leaves the set of his latest movie and goes to see his mother. Things start to get complicated when he finds he may have a grown child. The insurance company sends an agent to bring him back to the set and woman arrives looking for him. It's a good movie. Bloodworth is about a man, played by Kris Kristofferson, who abandoned his wife and children for a life on the road. Now, at the end of his life, he has to go back and deal with the damage he has done. Good drama.",1472860800,15,1623,4.3355263157894735
