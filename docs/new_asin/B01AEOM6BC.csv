7599259,3,B01AEOM6BC,"If you like these movies, this is the best buy for them on Blu-Ray as it also contains digital copies to redeem through Ultraviolet or Google Play.

When it comes to the discs, this is the same set as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantastic-Four-Fantastic-Four-Rise-of-the-Silver-Surfer-Blu-ray/dp/B007PM214O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantastic Four / Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer [Blu-ray</a>], but with a much nicer cover. The discs are unchanged from the original individual releases in 2006 for the first movie and 2007 for the sequel.

Now, these aren't the best superhero movies ever, and now they don't even make any list of top 10 Marvel movies, with Marvel Studios films, Fox's X-Men franchise, and some Spider-Man movies certainly sharing those spots. These are, however, a clear and earnest attempt to bring Marvel's first family of their superhero comics to the big screen.

First movie finds Reed Richards being funded by Victor Von Doom to go to space to study a cosmic storm, but when Reed and his crew (including Victor) are exposed to the storm, they develop super powers. Reed and his crew become celebrities quickly dubbed ""The Fantastic Four,"" while Victor's company crumbles around him, leading him to get revenge on Reed as the electric-powered Doctor Doom.

Second movie sees Reed and Sue Storm (a member of his crew) attempting to get married when a strange silver-colored alien on a surfboard is spotted on earth. Reed discovers that previous planets visited by this being have quickly withered in eight days. Joining with the military, the Fantastic Four are forced to work with Victor Von Doom again to discover the secret of the Silver Surfer and save Earth.

As good as those write ups sound, the results of the movies are still rather underwhelming. They havefor the most partgreat casts, particularly Chris Evans as Johnny ""the Human Torch"" Storm (who now plays a different Marvel hero, Captain America) and Michael Chiklis as Ben ""the Thing"" Grimm. Visual effects are serviceable. These movies are mainly for light enjoyment, and to their credit, don't really play themselves up to be more than that.

The problem with the Blu-Rays lies chiefly in the first movie's disc. While the video and audio are great, aside from the trailer and audio commentary, the disc has no bonus features. There were several on the movie's first DVD release, and the year after the first Blu-Ray came out, an extended cut of the movie was released on DVD in time for the sequel, with more substantial bonuses. Yet none of these are on the Blu-Ray, forcing anyone who enjoys bonus features to buy the DVD editions. The extended cut is also not on the first movie's disc, being only available on DVD and as an extra if you buy the movie digitally from iTunes.

The second movie's disc was released at the same time as the DVD edition and all of the bonus features are also on the Blu-Ray, albeit presented in standard definition.

Although I wish Fox would give the first movie's extended cut a Blu-Ray treatment and import the bonus features, this is likely all we'll get on Blu-Ray, so anyone wishing to purchase these films should find this set a good buy.

UPDATE 10/23/2017: Thanks to the recent amazing expansion of the Movies Anywhere service, the digital copy codes included now have a lot more value as you can redeem the codes through that app and have them on multiple major platforms (including Amazon Prime video). You can also connect the service to the platform you redeemed the codes on, getting them automatically imported. The Movies Anywhere app gives you bonus features for both films, including the HD version of the extended cut of the first film.",1459123200,17,3738,5.055194805194805
7599260,1,B01AEOM6BC,Do not purchase this set.  They still have not released the extended cut of 2005's Fantastic Four on Blu-ray.  This set only includes the theatrical cut.,1457395200,19,153,4.846153846153846
7599271,5,B01AEOM6BC,I have heard of these movies in the past but really didn't pay enough attention to them and what they were about.  I have recently become a fan of the Marvel studios super heroes movies such as Thor and Ant Man.  I found out that the two Fantastic 4 movies were made by Marvel also so I had to give them a try.  Man was I pleasantly surprised on how good they were.  You can't go wrong owning these if you are a fan of Marvel.,1523923200,,426,3.9186046511627906

7599275,4,B01AEOM6BC,I liked this version of the Fantastic Four. I don't know why it didn't do better as the actors did a good job. I would have went a different way with the Galactus / Silver Surfer storyline. I thought it would have been better if they had shown the menace in a gigantic Galactus like in the comics. Definitely worth a watch.,1519430400,,323,4.225806451612903

8747194,4,B01AEOM6BC,"This is one of those movie combination that I like despite their flaws.  The first FF movie is written in such a way that some fine actors (especially Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis) deliver the flattest, most unreasonable dialogue possible. Also, the first film came just a few years too early in some ways.  It wisely opted not to use CGI for the Thing, which made sense based on what was available, but now it looks very dated.  Chiklis acts through the prosthetics like a champ though and his scenes with Evans as the Human Torch are some of the highlights of the movies in my mind. aThe relationship between Reed and Sue was treated as a sort of a cold fish. The weird part is I think they planned it that way.

The second film was much better written in terms of its character interactions, and it features a marvelous Silver Surfer (fully animated in CGI), but it gives short shrift to Galactus, one of Marvel's big baddies. However, Reed and Sue are in good form in this movie, Evans is hilarious, and Chiklis manages some real acting despite the foam carapace he is in.  The thing is, I got to the end of the second film and I'm still smiling. How many movies make you happy.  Or want more movies to be made.  Both things are true here for me.

I would LOVE to see what the Marvel Cinema Universe would do with these same actors, if they could revive my favorite family of super-heroes.",1525651200,,1396,4.404669260700389
8747195,5,B01AEOM6BC,I absolutely loved it. I am glad I am not a movie critic so I can enjoy the movie. it's really nice to watch the makings of the movies too. I just wish there was more of these movies in a series.,1524960000,,195,3.6666666666666665
