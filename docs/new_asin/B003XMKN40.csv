4217724,5,B003XMKN40,"This was an awsome experience-12 hours of magical performances. I'm certain these 2 discs will be great, but where is Jeff Beck's astounding version of the Beatles ""A Day In The Life"" ??? It was a show-stopper !! I can't believe they left that on the cutting room floor (and retained weak performances by Willie Nelson). We can hope for a ""deluxe version"" later that includes more (all, please) of the show.",1193875200,21,407,4.666666666666667
4217725,4,B003XMKN40,"This show was amazing in person (after a 12 hour drive!) and the entire thing was available streaming video for a few days after(all 11 hours) but for some reason this is VERY edited. That said, this is really the best of the day crammed into 3 or 4 hours. I wish more of Robert Cray, Jeff Beck and Los Lobos was included. Esp, Beck's A Day In The Life, which was a show highlight.

Looks like almost all of Windwoods set and a good dose of Claptons is included.

So you SHOULD have been there, but this is cool too!",1193702400,9,516,4.099009900990099
4217726,5,B003XMKN40,"The strength of this 12-hour guitar festival taking place on a sweltering day in Chicago can not be visualized just by the immortal lineup. With such a talented group of shredders, everybody knew that it would be $90 well spent. What the audience did not know was that this concert would go down as one of the best, if not THE best, in post 60's and 70's history.

With godly performances from Clapton, Jeff Beck, Derek Trucks, Steve Winwood, Buddy Guy, and John Mayer, little was left to the imagination. The audience was screaming at times, and even crying at times. BB King made a very emotional appearance, even driving many to tears. TWO THUMBS WAY UP.

There were very few low points of this concert, but the best part is, I get to fast-forward through the dull parts.

I am pre-ordering this now.",1192752000,9,803,4.5625

I bought 4 total different years of this concert, this year 2007 won't run because it is asking for some kind of access code?  Some code is needed because it is produced for another country!  Really this is horrible.  And now it is too late to return!!!  This never occurred to me.  Now i know but how do I know any different in ordering for a present.  This makes me hesitate in ordering DVDs' again.

This was my intro to Robert Randolf and the Family Band.  Mind blowing to hear and watch.  The reunion of Clapton and Winwood doing old with Derek Trucks and Doyle Bramhall III.  Freakin' Amazing!

The Clapton and Stevie Winwood set of Presence of the Lord, Can't Find My Way Home, Had To Cry Today and Crossroads were worth the price of the DVD package alone! All the rest is a great big bonus!

4217773,5,B003XMKN40,"My review isn't really for the DVD, but more about the person who wrote the description of the DVD, Sam Graham. How does Amazon allow this person to write such an insult? Calling Johnny Winter ""decrepit?"" The man passed away! Have some damn respect. Then he goes on to praise Jeff Beck for an entire paragraph (an obvious Satriani fanboy by the sound of it), saying that he stood out above all others, because he's set was not ""blues"" oriented. 1st- Jeff Beck is heavily blues influenced and 2nd- the show is supposed to be about the blues. Any blues fan knows what the title ""Crossroads"" refers to. Not being happy enough to show his complete dislike for this show, by idolizing Beck above all other performers. But Sam then continues to even criticize Clapton and calling some of his performance ""weak."" Sam is obviously a person with a very small minded music range and blues is not within that range. Please have someone with some actual musical skill rewrite the description and again, show some respect!",1446940800,4,1009,4.706214689265536

What I really like about this is it shows the concert lots of close ups of hands and they keep the camera on the subject this is not MTV with tons of cuts and before you know it you're a nervous wreck. I like concerts they show you the concert specially when the music is this good. Now as far as I am concern if the only thing on this was the two songs by Jeff Beck it would be worth it each time Jeff and his band amazes me. There is so much on here tons of blues greats BB King is so sweet with statement about Eric and then to hear him he still has it. Susan Tedeschi with the Derek Trucks Band brings the house down. This release is full of peaks. But then Eric comes out wifh his bands which includes Derek Trucks but then he brings out Steve Winwood and they play a number of the Blind Faith tunes and Steve plays some of his then Steve & Eric do crossroads. You think it is all over I'm satisfied but no there is more out comes the great Buddy Guy it's Chicago what better way to end it with a heathy helping of Buddy Guy who is a master. Nothing more to say this is a wonderful release.,1365206400,,1359,4.055762081784387

The concerts are also intended to be a showcase for a variety of guitarists, who were hand-picked by Eric Clapton himself.  As Eric addressed the 2007 audience, he praised the performers as some of the very best, and those who had earned his respect in the music world.

My favorite parts are the abundant amount of slide playing, and the fact that Clapton isn't an overly dominant part of it all, but that when he's on he's on.

I seriously have listened to the Eric and Steve Winwood section a ton of times.  John Mayer is great on here too and I'm not a big fan of his.  However, the best parts are the old blues with guys that soon will no longer be in this world.  Buddy Guy recently said that after he and BB are gone the true, old bluesmen will be all gone.  I'm pretty sure that some of the young guys wouldn't agree with that but this is a fantastic DVD to have just to document the way old blues were played.  I don't know that I'd go as far as to say that Cheryl Crow was horrible on here but it's probably not her best effort.  I still enjoyed her and I always appreciate Willie Nelson.  Jeff Beck is good as he always is.  His young female bass player is excellent.  It was great to see Robbie Robertson out in public playing.  Johnny Winter has gone way down hill since then so if for nothing else, get it for the great version of highway 69.

My advice to Clapton and the producers is to take it back to Dallas without Murray and recapture that magic.

4217902,5,B003XMKN40,"This is the most enjoyable music dvd/blue-ray that I own.

It appears from Clapton's comments in introducing Stevie Winwood that this was the first time they had played together in 25 years, since the brief days of the incredible Blind Faith. Hearing and seeing them play Presence of he Lord, Can't Find My Way Home, and Had to Cry Today was and is a thrill, their duets are new and touching. Clapton is in his highest form, absolutely fantastic soloing. I Had to Cry Today in total ecstasy. I suspect that the obvious joy and creative remembering here resulted in their touring together and their great Madison Sq. Garden DVD show.

The performance by John McLaughlin of Maharina is worth the price of the entire DVD. His mastery of the guitar, perhaps especially stimulated by this guitar festival, and passionate engagement in the song produces a rich emotional range. The piece soars and rocks so much more than the version on the Floating Point CD. It is one of the high points of my 45 years of listening to and being touched by great rock and jazz.

I've never seen Jeff Beck before, but this is another just fantastic thing to see and feel. Beck, like McLaughlin, takes us on a complex emotional ride. His guitar is slashing and filled with inner deeper drama. If I had to compare Beck with any other musician, it would be Miles Davis. Same tense genius. Very impressive.

Other highlights: BB King singin' and playin' Rock Me Baby, Clapton & Crew playing Crossroads, Clapton singing Isn't It a Pity. These plenty of other good stuff here, and some stuff that doesn't do anything for me after one or two listening.

This is a great set of moments in Rock History.",1296864000,,1671,4.631756756756757

That was a highlight of my life I must say, so after seeing the 2010 dvd I was again amazed by the performances, but a little disappointed.  I felt the show was ""smaller"".  Mayer only brought the trio and while his rendition of ""Ain't No Sunshine"" was stellar, I don't think it matched 2007's ""Gravity"" with the whole band.  That said, it's a great dvd with standout performances, Sheryl Crow and Truks and company were great, as was Clapton of course - and it's alway good to see BB still out there!

THe whole atmosphere seems very commercial and more of a concert promotion rather than a festival to celebrate the blues and other forms of music with the spotlight on guitar work.

4217916,5,B003XMKN40,"There's a lot of various artists here, all top notch. Some of them were superb while others were only excellent. I liked the banjo back ground in the segways  between the bands and interviews. The intro gave a feeling of what it might sound like to be playing that banjo back when the blues was being forged. I thought this was very well conceived and portrayed. It can also be skipped through, although some of the songs seem to start abruptly. The audio is as good as it gets for standard DTS or PCM stereo. The video is also outstanding and as good it gets for standard DVD. My only complaint is ""Why is this NOT on Blu-ray with DTS Master Audio?"" It would be unfair to subtract anything for it NOT being Blu-ray I knew it was a DVD when I bought it. It just goes to show how good you can really be not being a slave to substance, kind of like a reverse Woodstock.  Yes I know some really good stuff was left out, but maybe they'll put it on the Blu-ray edition. This one is a no-brainier!! Buy it, Enjoy it, Live it!!

I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating that would make for a quicker and more accurate rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance
2. Quality of Audio
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)

1.*****
2.*****
3.*****

Bands that wish to have there performances recorded and recognised should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get, it settle for less and that's what you'll get.",1265068800,,1646,4.3980263157894735

This was a benefit for drug and alcohol addiction recovery at the Crossroads Centre, which Eric Clapton founded on the Caribbean island of Antigua. Legendary bluesmen Albert Lee, Sonny Landreth, Hubert Sumlin, Jimmie Vaughan, Robert Cray, Johnny Winter, and B.B. King all appear in multiple performances, as well as rockers Los Lobos, John Mayer, Robbie Robertson, Sheryl Crow, Jeff Beck, and Steve Winwood. A tip of the hat goes to jazz and country, as John McLaughlin, Vince Gill, and Willie Nelson are also in the lineup. Clapton pays tribute to his dear departed friend George Harrison and, since Beck and Winwood are present, a number of the tracks revive hits by the Yardbirds, Blind Faith, and Traffic. Chicago-blues icon Buddy Guy wraps up the show with an all-star jam.

After all, who ever expected to hear those Blind Faith songs played live by Clapton and Winwood - and that was only the climax of the day!

But it got even better when I got my hands on these dvds.  I can put them in my player and relive that incredible event.  From Bill Murray's kooky charm as emcee to Clapton's bashfulness as B.B. King talked about his friend, the warmth and love we felt at the show is truly reproduced in this chronicle of the day.

There were so many wonderful musical moments:  Johnny Winter, who had to be led to his stool but proceeded to play his heart out; the larger-than-life Jeff Beck and his band, featuring the young and amazing Tal Wilkenfeld on bass; John Mayer (John Mayer?!) showing he can really play that guitar even as he gawked at all his idols; Derek Trucks, filling in for his namesake but making it all his own; and Mr. Clapton's evening show featuring, among others, Robbie Robertson, Trucks, Doyle Bramhall II, Buddy Guy and Mr. Winwood.  I realized I had been waiting most of my life to hear those songs ring out on that beautiful summer night.

I could go on, but I won't.  If you were lucky enough to be there, you know what I'm talking about.  If you couldn't get there, thank your lucky stars the dvd is available and order the darn thing!",1241222400,,1459,4.37037037037037

The reason I'm giving only four stars is the editing/decision to limit this showcase to only 2 discs.  It could have easily been 3 or 4 discs to include more of the Jeff Beck, Johnny Winter, Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks sets.  It was obvious that the appearance Jeff Beck took the show to another level yet there were only two songs on the disc (his set was actually 12 songs).  I keep looking for a Volume 2 of this show but I doubt that will ever come.  Hopefully future ""Crossroads"" concerts will not be so heavily edited.

4217953,3,B003XMKN40,"Firstly, I thought the MC, Mr. Bill Murray was hugely irritating. Especially as he referred to John McLaughlin as the founder of the ""Mahi-Mahi"" Orchestra (!). Funny ? Go figure.

Secondly, the production quality, especially the sound, editing and overall stage aesthetics were not a patch on the earlier Crossroads DVD. It's a big let-down. Also, the `Audio' option does not provide for a 5.1 option, only 2.1 is available.

Coming to John McLaughlin, he plays a rather tepid composition, unlike his electrifying duet with Zakir Hussain on the last show.

Even Buddy guy looked a bit jaded. Was it because he came on at the very end ?

The only bright spot was Jeff Beck and his amazing girl-woman bassist (Tal) who played with the same open-mouthed gleeful enthusiasm as a Ronaldino playing soccer. Both the tunes were crackling and left me craving for more.

All in all, I certainly wouldn't go  goo-goo ga-ga like all others here. 3 stars will do.

If you really want to see great `live' concerts check out `Concert for George' (featuring Clapton) and `Live in Paris' (featuring Miles Davis !).

Thanks you and goodnight.

He was referring to Disk 2 and the jam with Winwood, Clapton etc.  But why was Sheryl Crow even allowed in Chicago on the day much less on stage with real musicians. Eric may have owed her or wanted something to allow her anywhere near a guitar. Could she have been backstage entertainment? Oh well. Despite her a great great DVD.",1227312000,,432,4.333333333333333

4217956,5,B003XMKN40,"If you're looking for a grassroots feel to a truely spontaneous concert, this collection of performances over a day-long concert in suburban Chicago is well worth the coin you'll spend.  The line-up is spactacular and the emotion created on-stage will spill out of your flat-screen and onto the livingroom floor.  The two-dvd set will feature some of the greatest guitarists of all time on stage from various genre' and comes to a turmultuous finale' when 7 guitarist hit the stage to play Clapton's favorites.  The shear force of this segment must have put-out a brilliant shockwave that must have been felt in far-away Des Moines.  If you've grown bored by a sucession of live shows that are overly-produced to the point of yawn-dom, this is a refreshing time-out from all of the hype.  You'll see the human side of these artists with backstage interviews and short edits of legends coming-on and off of their performances. One of the notable high-points was the 15 year-old bassist of Jeff Beck.  She is a genius and the facial expressions and body language that emanates from her as she leans-into the tunage will give you goose-bumps.  The fact that the entire 2007 concert was a fundraiser for Clapton's Crossroads Centre, a very successful detoxification facility, makes the performances just that much more compelling. PBS offered this set duirng one of their fundraising telecasts.  You can get it here for far less.  Enjoy!  And when it's done, you look at your axe and say, ""I've got some new chops to learn!""  or  ""It's hopeless...I'm selling my Strat on eBay.""",1226793600,,1573,4.916666666666667

This release really needed to be a triple. Some of my favorites on the released discs were JohnnyWinter's contribution, SusanT's and hubby DerekT's, AlbertLee's. The entire 1-hr JeffBeck set was superb with amazing and HOT-bassist TalWilkenfeld; it was a pity that only 3 of the songs played from that set made it to the release. Clapton and Winwood were magic together. One of the most magical moments of the entire day was when E cozied right up next to DerekT during ""Why Does Love Got to be so Sad"" to play double leads - two separate, yet, complimenting leads. DT played slide and E bent notes so rigorously as to simulate a slide guitar. The song appears on the BonusDisc, but the sound mix on that disc was flawed. If you can get a copy of the MSN-feed video discs, do it. The video won't be digital quality but still similar to a good VHS. At least the sound is right!

Highlights for my wife and I were Landreth, Jeff Beck, Johnny Winter, Buddy Guy and Derek Trucks. Doyle Bramhall, Vince Gill and John McLaughlin also had excellent sets. Eric's rendition of ""Isn't It A Pity"" was very good and a fitting tribute to George Harrison. The biggest problem was for me was that John McLaughlin only had one song and Jeff Beck only had two on the DVD. Those are two of the greatest guitar players of all time, I would have thought they would get more time on a DVD of a guitar festival.

While they weren't bad, Sheryl Crow, Steve Winwood and Willie Nelson suffered in comparison.  They just weren't quite at the same level as most of the other artists, IMO.

What an amazing concert.  I would recommend everyone who loves music to buy this DVD because it's a real treasure, and as such it's also a great collectors item, or indeed a great gift to give to anyone who appreciates good music.

The young girl who played awesome bass guitar when accompanying the great guitar legend-Jeff Beck was absolutely brilliant.  For someone so young and talented to be able to stand on a stage and play with Jeff Beck as well as keep up with him and lead him, just shows how great she really is as a bass guitarist.  Sadly
however, I saw no mention of her name on the DVD box to refer to, as I would certainly like to learn more about her, as she has an exciting future ahead of her for sure.

King, over 80 years old, is in surprisingly robust voice and plays as well as ever, though he is very overweight and played his set sitting down. But the highlight for me was Jeff Beck's incredibly imaginative and dramatic guitar playing. Though over 60 Beck has retained his youthful figure and shock of black hair, and continues to sound like a visitor from the future. Following Jeff's every twist and turn and taking her own extended solo was young Tal Wilkenfeld, an amazing talent on bass. Her solo blew me away, and it doesn't hurt that she's cute and radiates enthusiasm.

4218018,4,B003XMKN40,"I've watched and listened quite a few times before writing my brief review. Overall, not quite up to the quality of the previous DVD. I find disc 1 has some really nice moments (B.B. King, Sonny Landreth, Albert Lee), but I find it a little weak on guitar star power. Hence, the inclusion of Willie Nelson and Sheryl Crow to try and make up for that shortcoming? I tend to hit the skip button more often on this disc.

Disc 2 is where things really get interesting. No need to hit the skip button anymore. From John Mayer to Jeff Beck to EC himself to the incredible Steve Winwood this is a real winner. Song selection is really inspired especially the Blind Faith stuff Clapton and Winwood play together. The Clapton performance of George Harrison's Isn't It A Pity is also excellent. Winwood's Dear Mr. Fantasy might be the best ever live performance of that song and substantially improves upon the version from the Last Great Traffic Jam DVD.

I probably would have bought the DVD for Jeff Beck alone (very hard to find any JB video performances), but it was really great seeing Clapton and Winwood playing together again and doing justice to some old material neither of them have played frequently throughout the years. As much as Blind Faith was overhyped and dissolved very quickly back in 69, truth be told the songs have endured very nicely.",1203206400,,1351,4.648535564853557

4218024,4,B003XMKN40,"It's worth the price if only to see the outstanding performances featuring Derek Trucks. He is all over the place on this DVD. How a young guy like him developed such amazing chops is. well, unworldly.

Jeff Beck's performance is nothing short of awe inspiring. Many of the world's finest guitarists consider Beck the master. Watch this and you will know why. And who is that young gal playing bass? She matches Beck note for note - not an easy task for any player, let alone someone who appears to be little more than a teen, maybe a young adult.

And then there is Steve Winwood. He is always a pleasure to watch and listen to. He hits it off well playing the Blind Faith material with Clapton, but he really shines on perhaps his greatest work - Dear Mr. Fantasy.

That brings us to Clapton. Much credit goes to the man for assembling such a great group of players to support a worthy cause. Unfortunately, his performances come up a bit short. It seemed like he was trying very hard, maybe too hard to keep up with the young guns in his band,((Trucks blows him away every time they play a number together). Maybe it's just over-exposure. There is no denying that he is one of the guitar greats, but he is starting to sound stale. Maybe it's just because rock and blues are great, but limited forms of music. There is only so far that Clapton or anyone can stretch it. Compare Jeff Beck's performance to anything Clapton does on this DVD and you will understand what I am saying.

Overall, a good DVD, certainly worth owning. Unfortunately, I find my self hitting the skip button on the remote a little too often.",1202428800,5,1616,4.467796610169492

They are very entertaining too!",1202428800,,170,4.181818181818182
4218027,5,B003XMKN40,"Sometimes an event has repercussions beyond its own timeframe. Festivals are intended to be entertaining, but sometimes that isn't even the case. You need look no further than the Festival at Altamont to find an example of festival-dom gone seriously wrong, but occasionally the stars align in just the sequence, making an event feel special as it is happening, and continue to feel special after it is long over. Woodstock was like that. A few of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festivals have been like that, and the 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival was also like that.
A few years ago, Eric Clapton helped to fund the opening of the Crossroads Centre, a treatment facility for alcoholism and drug addiction located in Antigua. Proceeds from the festival and the DVD benefit the Crossroads Centre, so the cause can make you feel good while the awesome music contained in this program can make you feel even better. Clapton pulled out all the stops on this one, inviting friends who he felt not only fit the bill musically, but also worked with the appropriate attitude of camaraderie and openness. The resultant mood is apparent from the minute the show starts, and it continues to the very end. Sonny Landreth starts things off by performing one of his flashier numbers, called ""Uberesso,"" and he smokes it. Clapton then joins him and their duet is jaw-dropping in its execution. John McLaughlin follows (where the heck has he been?) as does Hubert Sumlin, Vince Gill, Jimmie Vaughan, Albert Lee, Robert Cray, Robert Randolph, Johnny Winter, Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson...and that is just disk one. Special mention should be made of the husband-wife team of Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, whose performance was so good that I felt myself tearing up. Tedeschi is under-rated and under-recognized, as her guitar/vocal performance here clearly indicates. Another touching moment occurs when B.B, King pays a tribute to Clapton's sense of humanity before ripping into a devastating version of ""Paying the Cost to Be the Boss.""
Disk two brings out the big guns like John Mayer, Los Lobos, Robbie Robertson and Jeff Beck. If you don't know it already, Mayer capably proves that he belongs on the bill with such magnificent musicians, while Los Lobos and Jeff Beck fully live up to their reputations. At this point, Eric Clapton emerges for his set, and he is in full `Derek & the Dominos' mode, with Derek Trucks playing like a virtual Duane Allman, while the double drumming rhythm section provides enough drive to thrust the band into the next county. The night is full of special guests and special moments, but perhaps the premier special moment happens when Steve Winwood joins Eric Clapton for a run through some of the material that they made famous together nearly forty years ago as Blind Faith. Buddy Guy closes the event, and he plays with such intensity and fire that you'd be forgiven to think it was his show. All in all there's approximately four hours of guitar-based music on these disks, and hardly a dull moment. `Crossroads' is a must for all fans of blues-based rock and roll guitar, but it also required viewing for all fans of blues-based rock and roll.

4218028,5,B003XMKN40,"Different from first Crossorads Festival on DVD ( the one held in Texas in 2004), was the following: (1) this one took place in the Chicago area in July of 2007; (2) had comedian Bill Murray as a host, beginning the festivities and humorously introducing many of the performers; (3) had some new faces at the concert.

Of the performers that were not on the 2004 DVD, the ones I enjoyed the most were Albert Lee (incredibly-fast hands), Susan Tedeschi, Jeff Beck, Steve Winwood and Derek Trucks. Of the new faces, none was more startling than Beck's young bass player: Tal Wilkenfeld.

I have to admit I do not understand why Willie Nelson and Sheryl Crow were there, as this was a guitar festival and neither one is known for that particular talent.

Speaking of talent, here's 10 guitarists, just offhand, I'd love to see if Eric keeps hosting these festivals: Mark Knopfler, Mick Taylor, Ronnie Earl, Keith Richards, Peter Green, Dave Mason, Jack Bruce, Sue Foley, Walter Trout and Robben Ford. I'm sure I left out a ton of other great guitarists, but those just came to mind.

There were touching moments in this all-day concert, too, and you can see the love Eric has with King and Winwood. The whole thing, really, is one big love affair the artists share for each other and the good cause for the concert. Speaking of that, the $20 you shell out for this four hours of music all goes to rehab center in Antigua.

Overall, this is another outstanding Crossroads Guitar Festival and I just hope they keep coming!",1201910400,,1517,4.645522388059701
4218029,5,B003XMKN40,"While some complain that this isn't the best concert ever, I agree, and it wasn't meant to be. It is something that should have been done years ago with all of the talent involved. Not much is made of the Derek Trucks play and if you want to see the reincarnation of Duane Allman, Derek Trucks is as close as you are going to get. Being raised in Macon, Ga and getting to listen to Duane early on, Derek is playing slide about as good as anyone can. As for the other performers, I only wish they had gotten on the stage together 20 years ago. If you love watching guitarists and how they play, this is as good as it gets. The closeups are absolutely phenomenal.",1201651200,,661,4.21259842519685
4218030,2,B003XMKN40,I purchased this DVD expecting it to be at least as good as the first Cross Roads concert that Clapton put out.  NOT!!  This concert is nowhere as good as the first.  Many less top artists on this DVD.,1201564800,,201,4.102564102564102
4218031,5,B003XMKN40,"On the shortened PBS version of the 2007 Festival, Clapton's Blind Faith reunion with Steve Winwood and Jeff Beck's set were the highlights.  But on the full-length DVD, the most impressive guitar-slinger for me was young Derek Trucks.  His set, his band's role as the house band for several other perfomers, and his solos on Clapton's rockin', dual-drummer version of ""Tell the Truth"" and on the Winwood-Clapton version of ""Crossroads"" were simply awe-inspiring, even for the audience.  Boy, was he channeling Duane Allman on the Derek & the Dominos jams or what?  In his new book, Clapton says Duane Allman was like family--has Clapton found a new family?  It is no wonder that Clapton included Trucks in his Festival band and that Derek and Warren Haynes have brought new life to the Allman Brothers Band.

My dream for a 2010 Festival lineup?  How about Clapton's old Immediate label bandmate Jimmy Page (if he is not on a Led Zepplin world tour), Keith Richards, legends Chuck Berry and Les Paul (if they are still around), the Allman Brothers Band, Bonnie Raitt (a real guitar player, unlike Sheryl Crow), Lonnie Mack, Dave Mason, Joe Walsh, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Buddy Guy, a lot more Skunk Baxter than was in the ""extras"", and a few other ""old timers"" from 2004 and 2007?

When the singer sings, show the singer. When the drummer adds a fill, show the drummer. When the guitarist plays a SOLO show the GUITARIST! NOT THE BASS PLAYER TALKING TO A STAGE HAND, NOT THE DRUMMER TAKING A DRINK OF WATER, AND NOT SOMEONE YAWNING IN THE AUDIENCE!
The sound is fine, but not particularly noteworthy. The mixing is OK except for a couple of spots. There were very few technical problems (although, in response to many of the reviewers who lamented the omission of Beck's ""A Day in the Life"", it was probably left on the cutting room floor because of a couple of serious audio malfunctions with the recording equipment).

I do agree with other critical reviews, that too many performers got so little time on the DVD and apparently live as well. Los Lobos does a full set and Johnny Winter gets to do Highway 61...and done? I had the privilege of seeing Johnny up close, six days before the festival in Omaha and he wowed the crowd, many of whom had never heard him before. To the reviewer who said, ""Johnny was sick"". Johnny is old and his eyesight is poor, that is why he has a ""handler"". He is no longer the showman that he was when he headed up the ""AND"" group with Derringer, but he still played lightning licks with or without the slide. I dare say that there were only a few who were on the show that day, who deserve to have their names mentioned in the same sentence as Winter.

All things considered, this show was yet another blockbuster! Most importantly, the money that is being raised to benefit Clapton's Crossroads Centre at Antigua, will mean more people's lives might be spared from addiction. Isn't that the goal of these super-concerts?",1199577600,4,1183,4.497674418604651

4218071,5,B003XMKN40,"one can't help but compare crossroads 2 to its predecessor. though
initially i was a bit disappointed but after seeing it a couple more
times i'm more than satisfied.

sonny landreth the slide guitar maestro opens the show with a bang. in
his second song he even invites clapton for a duel.

john mclaughlin who recorded the best performance in the first crossroads,
disappoints slightly here.

doyle brahmhall is hardly impressive and seems to me to lack confidence for he seems to often looks towards clapton for approval. his slide version of cream's 'outside woman blues' is not too bad. but that's the best you can say.

susan tedeschi performs a traditional blues number and is competent. her husband derek trucks follows her with a rousing version of derek and the dominoes ""anyday"" which lyrics clapton on the sidelines could be seen mouthing. derek is a major talent seemingly comfortable with both the bottleneck and regular lead playing.

what follows is imo the highlight of the show - johnny winter's rousing version of 'highway 61'. yea, this is the old bull of the woods, all right. old and bent he is - but that doesn't prevent him from giving a spirited performance. the mini-humbuckers on his gibson firebird literally growl with his deft slide playing. derek trucks supporting him can be seen in one instance leaning over to get a glimpse of the albino's slide work.

robert randoph is great - but imo they could have invited jeff healy who too plays a similar lap slide and is a great player - this time.

robert cray in contrast to the earlier crossroads gives a mediocre performance.

jimi vaughn and hubert sumlin play ok sets.

bb king delivers way more than the previous time. he repeats ""rock me baby"" which he played at the texas crossroads but his signature vibrato is on full display here and he plays lick after delicious lick.

i'm not a fan of country music and so can't really comment on vince gill or albert lee or willy nelson. sheryl crow looks pretty and this seems to be acknowledged by everybody from albert lee to willy nelson to clapton and apparently to the chagrin of vince neal.

john mayer has matured as a guitarist from his previous performance at texas and it clearly shows here. and he has a great slide guitarist supporting him as well. atlast i am convinced enough to check out some of his music on cd.

los lobos give a rousing set. they have two great guitarists in both the lead singer and david hidalgo.

jeff beck and his young bassist tal wilkenfeld literally amaze. jeff is quite different from other guitarists and this show clearly shows why - he uses every dynamic in the guitar to express himself. i thought tal was actually his daughter as he seems to be so proud of her. and that she's 21 is surprising as she looks 12! but she is a great player with a dazzling touch. but it is a pity that they did not include jeff beck's interpretation of the beatles 'day in the life' - i would have loved to hear that.

robbie robertson gives a great interpretation of bo diddley's 'who do you love'. clapton can't but resist playing along.

this seems to be a show for clapton to remember the good old days. he gives a rousing performance of derek and the dominoes ""tell the truth"" ably supported by derek trucks.

then he joins steve winwood and they do the old 'blind faith' tracks - 'had to cry today' (with winwood playing seconds lead) and 'presence of the lord' and cream's 'crossroads'.

next winwood goes solo and does a fantastic version of traffic's 'dear mr fantasy'. he plays some very melodic lines on his guitar.

buddy guy, the local chicago ""authority"", opens up with 'mary had a little lamb' and also does ""damn right i have the blues"". he is old now and it shows in the rigid movement of his fingers. but still buddy is buddy ...

""sweet home chicago"" with everybody participating winds up the show.

i can't help but wonder why they did not invite warren haynes who is probably the best guitarist in america today. also joe bonamassa who is a phenomenal new talent. dweezil zappa also could have provided a different flavour to the music. also no metal representation this time as with steva vai last time. the exotic element as represented by the indian slide guitarist vishva mohan bhatt last time is missing. they could have invited prasanna, the guitarist from southern india who fuses
rock with classical indian carnatic music. those interested in such music (ala mahavishnu orchestra etc) should check out his ""electric ganesha land"" - a carnatic guitarist's tribute to jimi hendrix!

a final note about the guitars used : the best looking guitar is the tangerine burst (?) single cut used by susan tedeschi. not sure what the make of the beauty is - guild?. mclaughlin is seen sporting a godin. derek trucks plays his usual gibson 61 reissue sg. johnny winter
his trademark gibson firebird and bb king his lucille. david hidalgo plays a tele, but strats rule! the great majority of the players - clapton, buddy, jimi vaughn, mayer, robbie robertson, jeff beck, winwood - all play fender strats.

a must for anybody who loves the guitar.

wonder where the next crossroads festival will be ... nashville?",1199318400,2,5181,4.675467546754676

4218074,4,B003XMKN40,"Fret-grinders everywhere are in hog heaven over this edition of Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival.  I play guitar and EC is one of my heroes, and his playing on this video is very inspired, and believe so for two reasons: the presence of Derek Trucks, possibly the best electric slide man alive, and Steve Winwood.

Some of the ensemble rhythm sections that play behind the artists are beefy and sizeable (two drummers and percussionists), yet the music doesn't suffer (it's not easy to get a group of 7-10 players to play in unison, no matter how great they are, but these are obviously well-cast players who listen and are quick studies).

The highlights on the disks for me were Sony Landreth's smoking instrumental, ""Uberesso"", ""Anyday"" (an old Derek and the Dominos tune) by Susan Tedeschi and Trucks' Band, John Mayer's ""Gravity"", Los Lobos' ""Mas Y Mas"" and Clapton's visitations of his classics, like, "" Tell the Truth"", ""Presence of the Lord"" and the songs with Steve Winwood, who is in fine voice and form. It was nice to see Jerry Douglas playing slide on a Telecaster during the Willie Nelson songs, which is a rare sight. If there is one track that absolutely floored me, it was the blues tune Clapton fronts, entitled, ""Little Queen of Spades.""  Frankly, it's some of Clapton's best live playing in a long time.

Jeff Beck: would loved to have seen his performance of ""A Day in the Life"", which is astonishing.  His lady bassist is quite capable, but he seems a bit too deferential towards her.  Great to see Johnny Winter playing his old Gibson Firebird, but would have preferred seeing him play ""Highway 61"" at his breakneck pace a la mid-70s. The ensemble jams, as they have been with both Crossroads editions, have been the weakest or mediocre at best, but nice to see if only for historical purposes.

Wishes for future editions: extras, like interviews with all the artists talking about guitar! If they were still alive, SRV and Jimi would be there, and would be interested hearing perspectives on them from the players.  Who else should play in future: more Nashville pickers like Brent Mason! Robben Ford and Larry Carlton, Bill Nelson from Be Bop Deluxe, jazz/fusion man Steve Khan, Chuck Berry, and Ricky Skaggs, to name a few.  More women players, like Bonnie Raitt.  How about some whackos, like Junior Brown, just to keep things a bit off kilter?

The only critiscm I'll give it was there is bit too much Steve Winwood for my taste. Maybe 1 or 2 songs less. He is a great talent and the reunion was historic setting the stage for the February concert dates with EC. Derek Trucks was huge, B.B. King was uplifting, nice to see Sonny Landreth, but Albert Lee and the country portion were a huge suprise.

This concert features a lot of the same people at the 2004 performance, which is fine because the point of the original Crossroads 2004 was that Eric invited performers who where in his record collection. Clapton is one of those artists's who is just as comfortable as a lead performer as he is a supporting musician.  In 2004 he chose to let ZZ Top close the show and they rocked.  This time ZZ Top was nowhere to be seen and Clapton closed the show.  He surrounded himself with a solid supporting cast, Steve Winwood,  Derek Trucks, John Mayer and Johnny Winter., and Eric wailed on the guitar to a higher than he did in the performance of 2004.

4218119,5,B003XMKN40,"What a superb concert DVD! Wonderful artists and songs, with excellent audio and video quality. I have now watched this DVD four times and I just know that it will be played again and again over the years.

Here are some brief comments on the various artists and their performances:

* Sonny Landreth - A top performance from a top slide guitarist.
* John McLaughlin - John is not 100% my cup of tea but I know quality when I hear it and John oozes quality.
* Doyle Bramhall II - Great to hear Doyle playing with his own band and not playing second fiddle to Eric (he's a regular member of Eric Clapton's band, as is Derek Trucks).
* Susan Tedeschi with The Derek Trucks Band - Susan has a great voice, plays competent lead guitar and is a hot babe too. Derek Trucks (her husband) is a lucky man.
* Derek Trucks - Always excellent whether he's playing slide or conventional lead guitar, and as usual the guitar is his cherry red Gibson SG.
* Johnny Winter - It was sad to see Johnny in such poor physical shape and playing such an uninspiring and meandering song.
* Robert Randolph - What a hot performer! Robert (who plays pedal steel guitar) was just a boy at the Crossroads 2004 concert and now he's a man. One of the standout performances of the concert.
* Robert Cray - Robert is a rather ordinary lead guitarist in my opinion but he does have a very good voice and provides excellent support for other artists.
* Jimmie Vaughan - I'm not a big fan of Jimmie's (his playing is not a patch on his brother Stevie Ray) but this was probably the best performance of his that I have experienced. He is obviously much loved by the other performers.
* Hubert Sumlin - Hubert must be in his mid-80's and he noodles along these days. He was so happy to be there it was a pleasure just having him on stage.
* B.B. King - B.B. can still play guitar beautifully and sing very well too even though he's now 81 and weighs about 20 stone. He gave a lovely tribute to Eric and said a few things that sounded like a farewell speech to me. If so, it will be the end of an era.
* Vince Gill - Vince may be a country artist but he's a fine guitarist and easily held his own in this high quality line-up.
* Albert Lee - A much underrated lead guitarist (country rock) who can still strut his stuff.
* Sheryl Crow - Now who's going to complain when the lovely Sheryl comes on stage for a song or two?
* Willie Nelson - Willie is looking pretty ancient these days. His duet with Sheryl didn't work for me as I'm sure they hadn't rehearsed it. He's a legend so I forgive him.
* John Mayer - This guy is a star with both lead guitar and song writing, and he demonstrated both skills admirably at this concert.
* Los Lobos - A solid set from a solid band.
* Jeff Beck - Wow, what a set! Jeff's lovely young bass player Tal Wilkenfeld plays a great solo and is definitely worth a wee look too.
* Eric Clapton - Eric just gets better and better. Amazing. Steve Winwood can take much of the credit for inspiring Eric to play so well.
* Robbie Robertson - Robbie just wasn't up to the same standard as the other musicians on stage. I can only think that Eric was paying Robbie back for inviting him to play at The Last Waltz all those years ago.
* Steve Winwood - The standout performer and the best set of the concert. Winwood is a genius. His song ""Dear Mr Fantasy"" was worth the price of the DVD alone. At the end of his set, which involved Eric, Doyle and Derek all playing guitar, you could tell that all of them knew they had just produced something special.
* Buddy Guy - This was the most focussed I've seen Buddy for a while. He also lead the finale ""Sweet Home Chicago"" with lots of stars on stage. The song was a bit of a shambles but who cares?",1198627200,,3731,4.173370319001387
4218120,5,B003XMKN40,"For starters, this is the first concert DVD that I own where I was actually at the concert.  My wife and I saw the whole concert (with the obvious exception of dinner and restroom breaks) and it was one of the best concerts we ever saw.  The DVD itself is so well put together that we get to relive the day each time we watch it.  I'll start out by saying that I agree about Sheryl Crow not really fitting in with the rest of them.  We were actually sitting down eating dinner during her solo spots, and now I just skip over ""If It Makes You Happy.""  I know she's popular but she is no guitar hero.  ""Tulsa Time"" isn't bad though since you get solos from Clapton, Lee, and Gill.  By the way, one of Vince Gill's backing guitarists looks like ""Otter"" from Animal House.  I notice strange things like that.  Anyway, there are so many highlights on this DVD.  Sonny Landreth is such an amazing guitarist and was the perfect show opener (""Hell at Home"" for which he duets with Clapton is incredible).  Doyle Bramhall II does a fantastic job during his solo spots and plays great during Clapton's set.  Derek Trucks is such an amazing guitarist (watch ""Anyday,"" ""Isn't It a Pity,"" and everything else featuring him) and his wife Susan is no slouch on guitar either on ""Little by Little.""  I'm so happy that they included Johnny Winter's rendition of ""Highway 61 Revisted"" (definite highlight).  John McLaughlin's song on this DVD, in my opinion, is better than his song on the first Crossroads DVD.  He is such a great guitarist.  I also feel that Jimmie Vaughan, B.B. King, and Buddy Guy are much better represented on this DVD than on the first Crossroads.  Jimmie does so much more on guitar for ""Dirty Work at the Crossroads"" than he did on ""Six Strings Down"" on the first Crossroads DVD.  And you get two songs from B.B. along with his tribute to Clapton.  And you get three songs from Buddy.  In my opinion, Robert Randolph is such a brilliant and unique guitarist, and there should have been one more song included from his set (maybe in place of ""If It Makes You Happy"").  He was better represented on the first Crossroads DVD (featured on 3 songs).  Still, ""NobodySoul"" is fantastic.  Vince Gill has better songs on the first Crossroads DVD, but ""Sweet Thing"" isn't bad.  I'm very happy with the inclusion of ""Country Boy"" by Albert Lee because I missed it at the concert since I went to get dinner at that time.  Willie Nelson was obviously going to be on the DVD, but only ""Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain"" should have been included.  ""On the Road Again"" doesn't deliver (should have had one more from Cray or Randolph instead).  Oh yes, Cray does a great job on ""Poor Johnny"" and backing Sumlin and King.  I've heard that many don't like John Mayer, but I feel that he is a brilliant guitarist (his solo on ""Gravity"" alone proves it and he plays a fantastic solo on ""Sweet Home Chicago"").  I didn't see much of Los Lobos when I was at the concert, but I wish that I had because they are a fantastic band (listen and watch David Hildalgo's solo on ""Mas Y Mas"").  I'm happy they included two songs from Los Lobos.  However, why do the producers feel the need to include shots of a girl in the audience sticking he tongue out while the band is playing (don't worry the camera work is still excellent).  And then there's Jeff Beck.  He stole the show in my opinion.  He's one of those guitarists that could play any song he wants and everyone will love it.  I too wish that they included ""A Day In The Life"" but I'm extremely happy with the two songs included on the DVD.  However, they need to release a really good Jeff Beck concert DVD.  Clapton of course is brilliant as always (""Tell the Truth,"" ""Little Queen of Spades,"" and ""Isn't It a Pity"").  Clapton's playing is incredible as is Trucks and Bramhall's.  I was very happy with the inclusion of ""Who Do You Love"" featuring Robbie Robertson backed by Clapton, Trucks, and Bramhall.  Another definite highlight is Clapton and Winwood doing the three Blind Faith songs and ""Crossroads."" Clapton, Winwood, Trucks, and Bramhall play brilliantly on all those songs. Also, Winwood does an excellent version of ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" and plays a killer guitar solo.  Anyway, I've written way too much so I'll just say that this is such an amazing DVD and I have watched it many times already.  Buy this DVD.  You won't be disappointed.",1198627200,2,4381,4.506345177664975

The music is a thrilling celebration of multiple artists who have changed history over the 49 years of my life with their music, and who now, in recovery from various drugs of choice, continue to change the lives of those who are hearing the message of recovery for the first time. Eric Clapton has chosen to serve others by providing a treatment center where those in need can find the help he found not too many years ago. I not only wanted my children to carry on the memory of this remarkable man and artist, but to have a part in donating to this important place of healing and hope for others. 5 stars to Clapton for this, perhaps the greatest work of art he's accomplished so far... and one still in the making.

4218134,5,B003XMKN40,"It's hard to think that the time-worn show-biz advice ""always leave `em wanting more"" could be embodied in the context of a four-hour DVD, but I think Eric Clapton and the producers of ""Eric Clapton Crossroads Guitar Festival 2007"" pulled it off.  Now, I can't recall Eric having ever been accused of poor taste.  His reputation in that area is alive and well, thanks to the quality of musicians that packed the stage as documented in what may be the finest, most compelling concert movie I've ever seen.

The 2007 event was the second such Crossroads Guitar Festival, staged by Clapton to benefit the Crossroads Centre, a facility in Antigua that treats drug and alcohol addiction, two demons that Clapton has fought and beat.

The planning that went into the event was obviously significant, and the up-front work was worth it.  Dozens of top-shelf musicians, from Blues aristocracy to a sky full of rock'n'roll superstars to rock's next generation of stars, shared a summer day, a beautiful stage, a magnificent sound and video system, and a reved-up throng in a stadium in Chicago's South Side.

I watched the PBS broadcast of this concert in November of 2007 in complete awe, mostly over the same features that are so impressive in this DVD collection.  It must have been a challenge just to decide what to include in this four-hour movie, let alone cut it in half again for a broadcast.

The high-definition video and audio recording is state-of-the art, reflecting the new standard for home entertainment.  This is a product that will likely never be shown in a theater - it was designed with your home theater in mind.

On the two DVDs are 39 songs featuring two many fine musicians to count.  B.B King, Willie Nelson, Sonny Landreth, Sheryl Crow, Vince Gill, Albert Lee, Robert Cray, John Mayer, Los Lobos all make appearances.  All are excellent (I'm sure this concert was kind of like Monday Night Football for the performers - all the other performers will see it).  Nothing is perfunctory.  No one phones it in.

A number of highlights dot the landscape:

a* John McLaughlin (somewhat annoyingly introduced as ""Mahi-mahi"" John Mc. Lauglin"" by MC Bill Murray, who confirms here that he's always up to the same old trick), who performs a powerfully lyrical, jazz-based raga backed by a rhythm section that reminds me of his days with Miles Davis.

* Doyle Bramhall II fronting a power-trio-plus-second-drummer foursome as they plow through Rosy, a rollicking blues shout inspired by a prison-farm field holler that leaves you feeling that a breakout is imminent.  They follow it up with an incredibly powerful version of ""Outside Woman Blues,"" a Blind Joe Reynolds smog recorded years ago by Clapton.  While it's easy to credit the soloist, the real credit goes to the two drummers and bass player, whose vocals, timing, and use of their instruments are outstanding.  Why isn't Doyle Bramhall II a household name?

* Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks, combining for a delicious set that laces together Tedeschi's sinuous vocal lines with differing but complementary licks laid down by both guitarists.
 Robert Randolph, playing with The Robert Cray Band, whose enthusiasm so clearly feeds off the crowd's reaction to him at center stage, in his performance of ""Nobodysoul"".

* Johnny Winter, very white and very frail, focused as a laser as he roars through Dylan's ""Highway 61 Revisited.""
John Mayer, whose songwriting and guitar mastery surprised me (and probably only me, since it seems I haven't been paying enough attention to him) with a soul/jazz/rock/blues stew to the tempo of a rolling boil on ""Belief.""

* Jeff Beck, a few years ago in danger of permanent assignment to the relic bin, now completely revitalized.  Jeff's buff in a slick black and yellow vest, and his playing is as lyrical and nuanced as ever.  It seems that his performance was in large part successful because of the fiery jazzy musicality and refreshing stage presence of female bassist Tal Wilkenfeld, who drives the crowd into a frenzy as she soars through the first solo of Beck's set on ""Cause We've Ended as Lovers.""

After a few token appearances earlier in the show, Clapton checks in pretty much for good about a third of the way through the second disk.  Previously, he appears content to sit stage side, taking photos like a tourist, and biding his time until nightfall.  As an observer, he sometimes seems as in awe of the collected talent as is the audience.  At other times, he is seen schmoozing offstage with his A-list guests.  He knows how to throw a party.  To me, ""Can't Find My Way Home,"" ""Had to Cry Today,"" and ""Presence of the Lord"" stand out because Steve Winwood is onstage playing and singing alongside Clapton, evoking the brief but productive time they spent together in Blind Faith.  Winwood then performs ""Dear Mr. Fantasy,"" proving that he had talent while he was part of Traffic, and maybe even The Spencer Davis Trio, too.

Fortunately, this video is not gunked up by tricky camera shots, showy transitions, or useless voice-over narration.  Footage is overlaid mostly to inform or to enhance the viewing experience.

Steve Winwood on stage with Clapton and Derek Trucks, Doyle Bramhall, Robert Cray..... all pro's who raised the bar that day.

BB King needs no plugs and his tribute to Eric is classy. Derek Trucks is known by some but this kid can play with some of the strongest riffs all day.

4218142,5,B003XMKN40,"Well first of all, this is a fantastic show, and it's in Chicago. The line up is stellar and everyone is having a great time. Yes there could have been others there as we all know- Larry Carlton, Robben Ford, Steve Vai and maybe even Les Paul--and with Blues folk Otis Rush -who has been sick and of course Bo Diddley (who had a tune dedicated to him by Robbie Robertson and had suffered a stroke earlier this year) Chuck Berry (he lives close!) Jody Williams maybe a lot of others...

But you can't please everyone and I thought the show was a nice mix. Very entertaining and the various combinations which played together (the real highlight of this DVD) seem to work well. I am a Blues enthusiast and the Blues in this show is fantastic. Hubert Sumilin plays great as does Robert Cray-who usually has no effects, but pulls off a little delay in ""Poor Johnny"". And Johnny Winter, who is also ill, brings back the fire in ""Highway 61"" as noted his slide playing is still phenomenal, and he gets applause from Derek Trucks!

B.B. King is very charming as usual at 82 and does well with Jimmie Vaughan, Hubert and Robert Cray. Well presented and touching with Eric in the wings. In Disc 2 we have John Mayer and the charismatic Los Lobos who start it off. Then the masterful Jeff Beck always amazing as he was when I first saw him with Rod Stewart on vocals at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1968. His quartet with Tal Wilkenfeld on bass, originally an Aussie from Sydney (Bondi) now based in the US-she is a stunner she may be the next Jaco Pastorius or Charlie Mingus and sexy too! I agree with other reviewers this band should tour now! Maybe Tal can sing?

Eric's set is great of course. I saw it in Australia this year (twice). Great selection of not the usual E.C. classics--well Doyle Bramhall II does ""Outside Women Blues"" on Disc 1. He does things from early in his solo career and of course a tribute to George Harrison. The highlight is his sub-set of Blind Faith tunes with Stevie Winwood. I haven't heard ""Presence of the Lord""  since I was 19 years old!!! Just superb. ""Had to Cry Today"" with Winwood and Clapton playing double lead is also excellent. This was worth the whole price of the DVD.

Yes, everyone has the items and artists they would wish for. This set does include Jeff Beck thankfully, but the whole show is well presented.
I am a Blues person but can appreciate Albert Lee and Vince Gill, too. This DVD will satisfy most musical tastes. The end with Buddy Guy, after ZZ Top in Texas, was also appropriate and proper even if Buddy did not have his incredible Sax player with him on the night. Buddy is a Chicago Blues icon and you could not have had a guitar show in Chicago without him. The final jam of the day ""Sweet Home Chicago"" with Buddy, John Mayer, Johnny Winter, Robert Cray, Jimmie Vaughan, Hubert Sumlin and Eric was a perfect end to the show.

This DVD is a must for guitar fans of all genres. The extras include snippets of performances of Tab Benoit, with his 72 Telecaster Thinline, playing with Skunk Baxter, Harvey Mandel (a native of Chicago of Canned Heat fame) with his strange custom axe and a very attractive young woman ""Orianthi"" getting an interesting Blues sound out of a PRS.

It is commendable that this show is different and varied and is a great companion volume to the first Crossroads DVD. And this Chicago edition has the comic wit of Bill Murray--I loved his intro of Eric Clapton while he was dressed up like the Clapton of '68 with perm and painted Gibson SG- wow! Lastly, it was very interesting and touching to 58 year olds like me, who have played guitar all of our lives, when Bill came out at the start of the show and played ""Gloria"" (""the only song I can play"") I am sure many many folks out there had a tear in their eye with that memory!",1197158400,99,3809,4.417378917378917
4218163,4,B003XMKN40,"First off, fantastic show. I was lucky enough to have attended and though I drove six hours (one way), was horribly sunburned (my own fault) and didn't sit down for a whole twelve hours, I regret nothing.

Secondly, I'd like to say that I thought that Pearly Queen (Clapton and Winwood), Hoochie Coochie Man (Guy and Clapton), and A Day In The Life (Beck) were the three cuts that hurt the most. The best you can do to get those is either find the Youtube cuts from the MSN webcast or download the soundboard bootleg of the entire show (which I did because I thought Beck's and Clapton's sets were live album-worthy, as well as various other things). If you do go for that bootleg, know that A Day In The Life is cut off halfway through (OF ALL THE SONGS..........). I will say however, that you should at least be glad that Alison Krauss & Union Station was completely cut out. Granted, they were cut because their set was plagued with the most sound problems, but it didn't really fit into the festival. It was too country, I suppose.

Anyway, the DVD is a must-own. However, I'm curious, because around 45:39 on disk 2 (during Tell The Truth) there's a tiny audio glitch. Just a little blip of something. I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed this. Sure, there were blips like that at the live show, but it's not in the soundboard bootleg I have. Please let me know if you've encountered this. I started a thread about it on IMDB's page for the festival.

4218166,5,B003XMKN40,"With much anticipation after ordering this dvd and after reading all the comments before hand etc.. you really never know what to expect because of all the other music lover's expectations and their own gauge of critquing can be so different from what you consider your own personal level of what is poor to excellent.  Well having said that, I was not disappointed in the least.  Great guitar players all around, great music and really fun.

I do have to admit I did pretty much skip the Sheryl Crow segment.  I tried to be patient.  She is cute and a good person and all, but musically I agree with a few others, she should not have been there.  But as one other commenter stated, she and E.C. were an item at some point in time pre Malia thus the reason she was most likely performing?  Who knows who cares but she shouldn't have been there.

When Derek Trucks Band with his wife and the other guy singing the old Derek and the Dominoes song ""Anyday"", I thought it was absolutely killer.  I was thinking oh boy, what else is coming.

Yeah, Beck's quartet with young Tal was fantastic.  They were having a lot of fun amongst themselves and with the crowd giving such great support.

E.C. was really on top of it all as always.  I did catch his last 2007 tour with his latest band which was his backup.  They are all so very talented.  Even though I totally respect Derek Trucks and his talent, I was thinking what if Duane was alive and playing the concert with Eric.  Duane really had that touch down and played with some much feel.

The guy who I thought was so strong and solid (they all were really except for Sheryl Crow, sorry Sheryl) was Steve Winwood.  After watching how Clapton and Winwood did their Blind Faith tunes and more, you can imagine how good their Feb 2008 concert in N.Y. is going to be.

I thought Bill Murray added a lot of levity as the master of ceremonies and I can almost here Eric in his Brit accent asking and saying to Bill, we need to make it a jolly good time.

B.B. is a class act.  Buddy was as good as he always has been.  I have seen him so many times and he never disappoints.  He really cracks me up.

Bottom line, buy it and enjoy.",1196726400,3,2173,4.282555282555283

To me there are two performances worth the cost of admission.  The brief glimpse of Tal Wilkenfeld, Jeff Beck's bassist on ""Cause We've Ended As Lovers"" and Steve Winwood doing anything, but especially ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" and with Clapton on ""Had To Cry Today"".

4218170,5,B003XMKN40,"In July 2007 Eric Clapton had his second concert for Antigua. As he did the first time, he filled the event with first class musicians, from not just Rock, but Country and Western also.
Eric had a list of Superstars including, Sonny Landreth,John McLaughlin, Doyle Bramhall, Susan Tedeschi with the Derek Trucks Band, Johnny Winter and Robert Randolph, Robert Cray and his band, Jimmy Vaughn, Hubert Summerlin, BB King, Vince Gill, Albert Lee, Sheryl Crow, Willie Nelson, John Mayer, Los Lobos, Jeff Beck, Robbie Robertson, Steve Winwood and Buddy Guy.
If you like the blues, the concert is for you.
Highlights include BB King doing, Paying the cost to be the boss as well as Albert Lee doing a lightning fast version of Country Boy.
Sheryl Crow, Vince Gill and Albert Lee as well as Eric Clapton do a hopping version of Tulsa Time which includes Jerry Douglas playing slide electric guitar instead of his specialty, the dobro.
Willie also does a great version of Blue Eyes Crying in the rain as well as his signature song, On the Road Again.
Jeff Beck steals the show with his versions of Cause we ended as lovers and Big Block, you hear the master as his very best. He also has a young lady who is about 16 or so playing bass. She is a very talented bass player. Sheryl Crow does, If it makes you happy.
Clapton then comes onstage and does, Tell the Truth as well as the George Harrison classic. Isn't it a pity, and the Robert Johnson, Little Queen of spades.
Steve Winwood then takes the stage with Clapton and does the Blind Faith classics, Presence of the Lord as well as, Can't find my way Home and Had to cry Today, and finally the Cream and Robert Johnson classic, Crossroads.
This CD has a little bit of everything, with young musicians like Derke Trucks and John Mayer with Doyle Bramhall, as well as BB King and Buddy Guy and Hubert Summerlin.

Only Clapton has what it takes to get that many performers at one time. Sure a lot of the stuff may have hit the cutting room floor but what made the dvd was incredible. If they put everything on the dvd there would be so many disks no one could afford it. Sure there were some performers that arnt my favorites but thats got to happen with something this big.

Of course there are omissions and some of them were up to the artists themselves.  For whatever reason Jeff Beck's fabulous version of the Day in the Life was omitted.  This is likely not the producers responsibility but that of Jeff Beck.  At the previous Crossroads in 2004, none of his performance was included in the DVD becuase of his choice.  Beck may not want his performance included because of other marketing issues--e.g., future live CD/DVD.

4218177,5,B003XMKN40,"Clapton's universal appeal and longtime assocations with other stellar guitarists once again pays off with a spectacular lineup on this DVD--a real who's who of guitarists. A lot of these guys are getting up there in age (as well as Clapton himself) and it's great to have such a gathering of legends documented on video. Sadly, stellar guitarists do not have the mainstream appeal they once enjoyed (just take a look at the crap on the current Top 40), so this high-profile video gives these artists, some of them somewhat obscure, the attention they deserve. Sonny Landreth, for one--AMAZING slide guitarist. Right up there with Derek Trucks (also prominently featured) even though his style is completely different. The only sore thumb in this lineup is Sheryl Crow--what was she doing there?? All the other featured acts were those with guitar prowess. Eric can invite anyone he wants, of course, but obviously she doesn't fit that category. Willie Nelson's ""duet"" with Crow was awful. If anything was going to be left on the ""cutting room floor,"" as another reviewer noted about one of Jeff Beck's numbers, the Crow-Nelson duet should have been it. I too demand a re-release!

Overall though, a great DVD and highly recommended for all guitar buffs. The 4 hours will fly by! And get the Best Buy/Target version with the bonus extra DVD. It's only two more songs, but they're good ones.",1195862400,41,1390,4.914893617021277
4218178,5,B003XMKN40,"The 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival dvd I think is a great representation of what happened that day in July. I wasn't there, but being the music geek that I am (and so many of my favorite artists on the bill) I watched the entire webcast. I know, I know, big loser, but I enjoyed it a lot. Sure, there are all songs that we all wish would've been on there. Jimmie doing 'Extra Jimmies', Jeff Beck doing 'A Day In The Life', Derek Trucks' smoking 'Sahib Teri Bandhi/Maki Madni.' Heck, Alison Krauss & Union Station played a very good set and aren't even included on the dvd! But overall, I do think this was better than the original Crossroads dvd, if for no other reason that they got Jeff Beck on there.

As I mentioned, in addition to Clapton, so many of my favorite artists were on this bill: Sonny Landreth, Doyle Bramhall II, Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, Johnny Winter, Robert Cray, Jimmie Vaughan, Hubert Sumlin, BB King, Buddy Guy, Los Lobos, John Mayer, Robert Randolph. Heck, I even enjoyed Sheryl Crow, and she stuck out like a sore thumb! I certainly couldn't say that about the first Crossroads dvd, where I found myself skipping through several of the acts. That certainly doesn't happen here, except for John McLaughlin. I know he's very talented and has earned a lot of respect, but his stuff does nothing for me.

For what it's worth, my ten favorite moments from this dvd are, in no order:

1. Bill Murray and Eric Clapton's opening of the festival
2. Sonny Landreth and Eric Clapton jamming together
3. Derek Trucks and Johnny Winter on 'Highway 61 Revisited'
4. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi on 'Little By Little'
5. BB King's toast to Eric Clapton
6. John Mayer's 'Belief'
7. Los Lobos' 'Don't Worry Baby'
8. Jeff Beck's 'Because We've Ended As Lovers'
9. Clapton's entire set including Steve Winwood and Robbie Robertson
10. Buddy Guy's entire set

""In the United States, ""exclusive editions"" with additional tracks are being sold by retailers Best Buy and Target.  ($10 cheaper on-line, my comment))

Best Buy's Exclusive Edition has two extra tracks: ""Things Get Better(Got To Get Better"") - the correct title for the song is ""Got To Get Better In A Little While"" - and ""Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad."" Both were songs performed by Eric during the Derek And The Dominos era.

The Target Stores Exclusive Edition also has two extra tracks, different from those offered by Best Buy. They are ""Cowboy Up"" by country superstar Vince Gill and ""Tear It Up"", performed by Albert Lee and Vince Gill.

The bonus discs are not in the clamshell case, but are stored in a pocket in the cardboard outer packaging. The tracks are also listed on the outer packaging.

Wide screen, great audio and video - I sure like modern tech!

The concert starts out at pretty mello and picks up steam & kicks some serious ass on the second DVD. Jazz, Blues, Country & Rock. It's all there, by a bunch of great peeps. I rate Crossroads 2007 as high as David Gilmour's new DVD. Two of the best in 2007.

Sets were much to short , Mr Murray was much to long winded and perhaps the best performances were out on the second stage before the main show (Jeff ""Skunk""Baxter jamming with Tab Benoit !!!!!)and maybe those two guys at the Fender tent doing ""Crossroads"" . I would have been happy paying $90 just to be floored by Beck doing ""A Day In The Life "" ...which has been commented on already , and Johnny Winter's one shot at the spotlight . What's wrong with a ""guitar summit"" limiting Mr Winter to one full song , while Los Lobos (which bored me to tears) got an entire set ?
The sound during the Jam at the end was horrendous and the sound guy missed a couple of solos . Winwood was very impressive , McLaughlin was much to ""noodly"" for that early in the day , and who in the world let Cheryl Crow in ?

It could have more Cray, more Randolph , Landreth, more Beck, Mclaughlin, Derek etc... That being said what a great Snippet of an unbelievable event.  Got to watch a bunch yesterday and re-live how great that event was.

Highlights for me too many to really pick or place in order but they included:
Presence of the Lord highlight, Vocals from Eric and Steve amazing. The rest of that set all a highlight but Presence stands out.  Isnt it A Pity a goosebump tears to the eye performance.  Any Day from Derek and Susan, Bill Murry and Eric totally digging it on the side of the stage.  Cause we ended as lovers just smoked.  Tal just snarling at Jeff as she rips the bass parts.  Poor Johnny from Cray, Vince Gill and Albert Lee, Robert Randolph on and on all just tore it up. Tell the truth, Hubert Sumlin Sitting on Top of th world, Johnny Winter Highway 61, Doyle, Eric, Derek and Steve taking the solos. On and on and on.  Susan Tedeschi blew me away as did Winwood as I didn't know either could play that well.  A must have and must see especially if you didn't get to see it live.

More to watch later today. I too wish it were 4 disks long as I think it would cover the event a bit better but it is still a 5 Start rating for what we do have on disk.  I also wish all the Cream shows from RAH were completely released but what we have is very cool!

The track may have burned on the day and the edit of it was awesome but, in the end, that didn't matter. The choice was out of the hands of the producers, promoters, record company and laid squarely in the hands of the Beck camp.

Many people have mentioned A day in the Life by Jeff Beck, which I agree should have been included.  Also, I Don't Need No Doctor, the Ray Charles cover that John Mayer did was one of the top 4 songs of the show and should have made the cut as well.

Also, I hope they fixed the awful sound that was on the webcast.  For example, Eric Clapton only played lead guitar for two of his songs, for the rest, Derek Trucks played lead.  However, Eric Clapton's guitar was miked about 5 times louder than Trucks.

Albert Lee's and Vince Gill's performance of ""Country Girl"" is a dazzling display of country guitar at its manic best. B.B. King brings his legendary genius to bear and never disappoints . Robert Cray brings his very clean, straight-ahead blues and blues/rock, Sheryl Crow's ""If It Makes You Happy"" has a slightly raw-er edge than some of her prior renditions; her ""Tulsa Time"", paired with EC, is as interesting for their onstage personal interplay as,for their onstage guitar play; Buddy Guy is, well, Buddy Guy. When Robbie Robertson joins EC for Bo Diidly's ""Who Do You Love,"" another highly memorable moment is reached.
