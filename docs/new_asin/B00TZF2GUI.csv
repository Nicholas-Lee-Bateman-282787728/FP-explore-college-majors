7026272,5,B00TZF2GUI,"This was one of the better shows on television in the past few years. The stories were unique and the characters were all likeable. It's too bad that CBS chose to cancel it just as, I imagine, more viewers were discovering it. Thank goodness that the DVDs are available - I already have Seasons 1 and 2 and am looking forward to this season to complete my collection.

The series is also available on Amazon Instant Video.",1425859200,10,422,4.48051948051948
