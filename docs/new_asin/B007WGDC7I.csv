5112378,5,B007WGDC7I,"This show is hilarious, and season 3 was no different. Kenny and Stevie were at the top of their games, and the addition of a few new characters, and the return of a few old made this season fantastic. I was gonna say that the series finale was great, but it turns out HBO has picked it up for a fourth season! Great news",1343779200,7,321,4.03125
5112379,5,B007WGDC7I,"It's Interesting that I lived in Myrtle Beach SC during the time this show was being Filmed!! I remember seeing Danny McBride during a shooting on Ocean Blvd. Myrtle Beach Really Is like the way this Season 3 Portrays it as an Awesome Southern Party Town with cool people, Bike Week...Crazy Rednecks everywhere. Season 3 Does Not Disappoint at all and continues the Awesome RAW Humor that fans of this series have come to love. Drugs, Cursing, Sex, Rock & Roll attitudes!! I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!",1496361600,,493,4.744186046511628

5112992,4,B007WGDC7I,"Kenny F***in' Powers. Never thought a character like Kenny would be relevant enough to grace a tv show.

He is a ego-maniac, crude as hell, and loves this game.

Season 1 - His struggle with getting back to the diamond and pursuing his high school love - April - is plenty enough to entertain. Will Ferrell makes a hilarious appearance as a car dealership owner. A lot of laughs with the crude, quotable jokes in this season.

Season 2 - Mr. Powers makes his way south to Mexico to get back to the show.

Season 3 - Myrtle Beach Mermans. Is this finally Kenny's time for a call up? His act gets a little old and at times hard to sit through. The neglectful treatment of his child is not very funny, at least to me. Love the appearance from Jason Sudeikis.

I think the show had a solid first half but failed to introduce interesting storylines and supporting cast.",1437609600,,864,4.375

Danny McBride is extremely refreshing. Think of him as Will Farrell meets Martin Lawrence!!!

5113473,5,B007WGDC7I,Huge Eastbound & Down fan. The first go round watching Season 3 on HBO was a bit of a letdown after a hilarious & often quotable Season 2. Watching Season 3 several more times on dvd has given me a greater appreciation of it. Season 4 was better than ever and a great way to close out the series. For those of you looking to purchase - I'd suggest waiting for Black Friday sales...the EastBound & Down Series usually retail b/w $7.99-$9.99.,1407801600,,440,4.378048780487805

5113475,5,B007WGDC7I,"Love this comedy! Each season and episode is better than the last. Danny McBride brilliantly portrays Kenny Powers as a professional baseball pitcher who constantly struggles with the trappings of fame and fortune versus being a loving father and husband. He can't seem to get either right for any length of time. He's an egotistical jerk who constantly manipulates those around him to his advantage especially his sidekick/personal assistant Stevie played by Steve Little. Season 3 features Jason Sudeikis from Saturday Night Live. Will Ferrell is one of the producers and also appears in a few episodes throughout the series. Lots of crude language, raunchy and/or sexual imagery and over-the-top stunts.",1407715200,,706,5.36936936936937

He and his catcher Jason Sudeikis do much drugs.  Kenny's girlfriend has had their son who is now a year-old.  They go out on a date and she skips town so Kenny aspires to parenthood, frightening.

Will Ferrell Exec. Produces and appears as a chracter.  Lily Tomlin and Don Johnson are Kenny's parents. So much swearing that the viewer can not even hear it any more, a little skin is shown.

Kenny and the catcher date college girls.  Kenny is asked by scout Matthew McConaughey to mentor a Russian pitcher. Kenny holds an Independence Day party that nobody attends so he crashes the Russian's party.

Kenny actually gets called up to the majors and in a scene that looks like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rookie/dp/B003V5K0Z6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rookie</a>&nbsp;he bails out.

But with that in mind it is often hilarious just not so much so this time around, for me at least.

Not giving away too much of the plot but season 3 sees Kenny Powers juggling his pitching career and the challenges of fatherhood.  Seeing Kenny trying to raise his baby after April left would be worth watching the entire season but Kenny is also facing professional challenges as he is no longer the Alpha on the team and he will do anything to get that position back.  If you liked the first two seasons season three is more of the same.

Powers has fallen from the top of his game and is bumbling around in the minors, barely keeping his spot on the team while doing copious amounts of drugs, making a fool of himself everywhere he goes, bossing his unpaid assistant around, Stevie (who idolizes Powers), taking care of his baby son (or having Stevie and his wife do it) after his son's mother, April, leaves the boy with Powers. Powers, despite always taking the hard road to accomplish anything, seems to somehow come through on top.

5113663,1,B007WGDC7I,"I missed the ball when the series EASTBOUND & DOWN began a few years ago. I heard good things about it and wondered if it lived up to the hype. Having just watched most of season 3 I can honestly say no, it comes nowhere near the hype. This show is just plain terrible.

The story is based around Kenny Powers, a baseball star who got kicked out of the big leagues when his fastball began to fade and due to his obnoxious personality. From what I've read the first season had him return to his hometown to teach gym. Apparently between then and now he's received a second chance and is now pitching in some minor league. The episodes I made it through didn't really touch much on this, only enough so you were aware.

True to form Kenny is still an obnoxious character. He seems to spend more time getting high and trying to hit on women far too young for him and definitely out of his league. For the most part they seemed more turned off by him than interested. The bragging about what a great star he is comes more from Kenny than from anyone else.

Here we have a central character that there is no way anyone could like or even care about. Kenny is a narcissist with a capital N. In his mind there is no one more important than Kenny, even his child. He is the most unlovable character I've seen in some time.

To make this series even worse is the performance by star Danny McBride. McBride has fallen into the same trap that so many before him have, most notable Jack Black. He apparently has a staff that tells him no matter what he does he's funny even when he's far from it. I've seen several things with McBride in the past few years and as an actor he isn't. He portrays every role the same way with the same characteristics and same problems. When it seems there aren't enough laughs he resorts to vulgar language. I have little doubt in my mind some half wasted college kid finds this hilarious. Until proven wrong the only thing McBride can do for me is give me a clue which movies/shows to avoid since he is in them.

I found nothing in this series that would make me want to come back and watch it each week. I honestly found myself stopping halfway through this season knowing that there was no way it would get any better than what I'd already witness and that was terrible. All it made me do was wonder how something like this could get made when so many great series were canceled or never even made it on the air. Would the show have been funnier or more enjoyable had I seen the first two seasons? Perhaps. Then again maybe if I decided to start smoking weed I'd find this series funny or even tolerable. I think I'd rather save the brain cells and just pass it by.

But one thing is certain. I'm sure that there are some out there who think McBride is a genius. I'm sure that there are some out there who think that this series is the funniest thing on the face of the Earth. And with that in mind I know that someone will take me to task for talking about how bad this show is, for revealing that the king isn't wearing any clothes. I'm sorry if you're a fan of this show and of this actor. My only hope is that one day you'll experience something that actually IS funny.",1357776000,2,3196,4.231147540983606

5113682,5,B007WGDC7I,"A lot of people talking about the season...anyone who is reading the review for the third season is probably more than familiar with the series.  Moreover, if you're like me, you've already seen the third season and are just buying it to watch it again or complete the collection (having owned the first two seasons on BluRay already).  I won't bore you with a synopsis of the season.  I'm sure you know it already.  If you don't, it's easily on par with the first two.  The cameos are a bit more plentiful in the third season as the series had gained some popularity by now.  Also, the 4th season is due to being soon.  Yep...many people thought the 3rd season was the series finale...heck even Danny McBride was done with the series and announced they had no plans or intentions for another season.  Yet...it's coming!

So how does this set stack up against the other two season's releases?  Well, its pretty much the same.  The case looks fine next to the other two. The artwork and design of the case looks like it belongs next to the other two.  The transfer and menus are slick.  The extras are standard fare following suit with the previous seasons.  A blooper reel, deleted scenes, A special, ""Dinner with the Schaffers"" short (hilarious), and a bevy of really great commentaries.

All in all, for the unbeatable price of a lousy 19.99...you get many hours of top notch, highly underrated comedy from some of the best out there.  The series, and the style of comedy may not be for everyone, but if you like the series and want to own it...like I did and do...then this set is perfect.  The extras alone make the small investment (cheaper than a single new release bluray movie) well worth the investment.
