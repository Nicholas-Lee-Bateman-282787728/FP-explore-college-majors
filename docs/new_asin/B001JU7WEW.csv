8313791,5,B001JU7WEW,"As an unrepentant fan of Don Matteo I have been searching for DVDs of the series which SBS has decided not to air any more. Having been to Gubbio and been awarded my 'Patente da Matto' - Madman's Licence - and been admitted into the ranks of the Honorary Madmen of Gubbio I found the setting of this series very much to my liking. The 16 episodes of the second season are contained in 4 DVDs and there are no English subtitles. The best you can get is Italian subtitles for the hard of hearing. I had never seen any of these episodes so it was an even more enjoyable experience to watch these episodes. It only took a week for the DVDs to arrive from Italy so I was very pleased by the service and, luckily, there were no problems with my DVD player. Now, about Series 1, 3, and 4 to 11.... and I wonder if I can find a CD of the marvellous theme music.",1293753600,2,853,4.083333333333333
