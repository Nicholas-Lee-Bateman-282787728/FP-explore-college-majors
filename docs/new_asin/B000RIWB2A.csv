8200896,5,B000RIWB2A,"This is a great movie from start to finish...its a pretty violent film for the year it was released. The beginning , is pretty brutal, bit this is one of bava's least known films. Check it out. Great classic and restored and remastered perfectly",1470873600,,245,4.590909090909091
8200897,5,B000RIWB2A,"Two brothers - one with the Vikings, the other one with the British - and an extremely unscrupulous traitor, that's the frame for this movie. The movie was made in 1961 and the quality of the Dvd is on a very high level with great colours.

This movie was unknown to me but I was pleasantly surprised.",1450137600,,301,4.280701754385965
8200898,5,B000RIWB2A,"I was introduced to these old films through Net-Flix, seeing ""Knives of the Avenger"" I then looked them up on Amazon being a sword & sorcery nut or nuts for any movie set in the era of the use of swords. After looking them up I discovered they are considered a sort of trilogy. They are all independent films with no relationship to each other, other than that fact that they are all starring Cameron Mitchell & are all three Viking movies. I don't know in what chronological order they were made, but in my opinion ""Erik the Conqueror"" is the best closely followed by ""Knives of the Avenger"" & then "" The Last of the Vikings"". None of these movies were ever made to win a Oscar, but they are all three great fun. I'm still waiting on ""Knives of the Avenger."" but so far ""Erik the Conqueror"" has received the best treatment as far as to the quality of digital restoration aspect ratio & general overall quality of the D.V.D. If your expecting to see a 50's, 60's type epic all star cast Technicolor extravaganza like ""The Vikings"" starring Kirk Douglas & Tony Curtis, you will be disappointed. However if your a fan of this genre & are looking to bulk up your collection all three of these movies are great escapist action period pieces. I give them five stars for what they are, fun fantasy adventure filmed on a low budget but with obvious love for the genre. The acting is adequate, the costumes & set's are like wise. The cinematography is exceptional and the story lines are believable and well paced. Being older film's although violent they are not overly graphic & could be enjoyed by the whole family on a rainy afternoon or cold winters night. If you are a critic with your blade at the ready to slice & dice don't bother, If your open to a little fun then snatch them up while they last at a affordable price! My ""Knives of the Avengers"" came today allowing me to discover their chronological order. 1st ""Erik the Conqueror"" also known as ""Fury of the Vikings"" & ""the Invaders"", 2cnd ""Last of the Vikings""& last but not least ""Knives of the Avenger"" also known as ""Viking Massacre"".",1373241600,,2093,4.481675392670157
8200899,5,B000RIWB2A,This is a great action movie. People who like the sword and sandal type movies will love this one. The viewing quality is good and the action keeps rocking on. A great Viking sword slashing action movie.,1300233600,,203,4.513513513513513
8200900,3,B000RIWB2A,"When i first saw the title of the movie ""Erik the conqueror"", i had to check it out....(my name's Erik), and reading the discription, i decided to buy it. I'm a fan of viking/fantasy/sword and historicly based if not accurate movies, like Conan the Barbarian, Braveheart, etc. and one thing i noticed about this movie was how, from the discription, it reminded me a bit like the movie ""the Vikings"", but it wasn't really the same. This movie was a foreign film, dubed in english (i didn't look to see where it was made), and the over all story wasn't too bad, though typicle, the english & vikings at war with each other, and during an attack of the vikings village (i assume one that was on english soil) the viking king was killed and his two very young sons seperated, one rescued by the retreating vikings, the other found by the english queen, who made him her son......20 years later, they're full grown and each leaders of their people, and they fight each other not recognizing the other as their brother, until the end. Ok, the acting was pretty good at best, the worst part or funniest, was the dubbing. At one point, the voice of Aaron (the son who became the vikings leader) totally change for a couple of sentences, i had to laugh out loud, it was so half assed it was funny. Another thing i noticed was everytime there was a battle, you heard the same voices over and over, like a laugh track almost, but the same yell, scream, scream, yell, yell, repeated over and over every time, and there's this arrow climbing thing near the end that was a little bit impossible, but what can you do. Over all i'd give this movie 2 stars, but i gave it 3 because i think it's an ok, old school flik, not awful.",1300147200,,1712,4.403785488958991
8200901,3,B000RIWB2A,"Mario Bava's Erik the Conqueror (aka Fury of The Vikings aka The Invaders) uses the old Corsican Twins plot, with two separated brothers - one growing up as British royalty, the other a Viking king (Cameron Mitchell, dubbed in both the Italian and English language versions included here) - falling for twins and set against each other by a scheming English noble who wants to use them to gain the throne. Despite a mother and child being speared in the opening sequence, it's not especially violent hokum: not quite kid's stuff, but no thinking man's epic by any means. Realism isn't on the menus either (the sacrificial sword dance in a cave at the root of a giant tree look more like a floorshow in a Viking-themed nightclub), but with it's vivid use of color and striking composition if you're in an undemanding mood it's not a bad way to spend an hour-and-a-half even if there's no shortage of better ones.

The subtitles on Anchor Bay's Region 1 NTSC DVD have obviously been written by an Italian with a limited English vocabulary and who is particularly awkward at constructing an intelligible sentence, but since the script is nothing to write home about to begin with it's not that big a problem. Extras are an audio commentary by Tim Lucas, a bizarrely candid audio interview with Cameron Mitchell, stills and poster gallery, US and German trailers and a trailer for Bava's Black Sunday.",1245196800,,1397,4.7727272727272725
8200902,4,B000RIWB2A,"Mr. Mario Bava really outdoes himself with this story of two brothers separated in infancy, who grow to be rival leaders in a battle between Scandanavia and Britian.

This yarn, replete with monumental battle sequences on both land and sea, magnificent coastal and interior castle settings, and bravura use of color simply amazes in its ambitious achievements.

The film opens with a battle sequence on the seashore, by turns both thrilling and horrifying as the soldiers meet with death by spear while the nearby coastal village is burned, with women and children scattering to their doom.

With this breathless sequence, Mr. Bava introduces the audience to a breakneck pace that never lets up.

The story such as it is, is played engagingly on the level of an Errol Flynn film, intelligent enough for adults, but close enough to a comic book for whatever youngsters may be in the audience.

It is, however, the visuals that linger in the mind: a grotto with an enormous twisted tree upon which are bound two captured adulterers, bathed in that phosphorescent green light that Mr. Bava was so adept at casting; a stunning vista of the seashore at twilight with two women in billowing robes silhouetted against a sky banked with tempestuous cloud formations, Georges Ardisson and his mother flanked by flaming braziers, amidst tall stalagmites, in a setting that might be from Dante's Inferno, (and recalls a similar setting in Orson Welle's ""Macbeth"" and countless others.

Mr. Bava painted his masterpieces not on canvas but on celluloid.

The cast is both attractive and serviceable, with Mr. Ardisson and the luscious Kessler Twins deserving of special commendation. Indeed the Misses Kessler, (as Vestal Virgins) perform a sword dance with such delicacy and intricate footwork that it is easy to see why their cabaret act was once the toast of Europe.

Highly enjoyable for fans of the genre.",1222214400,3,1897,5.038338658146965
8200903,3,B000RIWB2A,"This is a beutifully made epic,directed (and photographed) by italian
movie genius Mario Bava. It stars the magnificent Cameron Mitchell,the
beutiful Kessler sisters,Alice and Ellen,and a great italian actor,George
(Giorgio) Ardison.
Mitchell and Ardison, had allready starred in another viking epic ""The
last of the vikings"" Fairly good,but not as near as good as this one.
The dvd features a  superbly restored ,uncut version of the film. Get it!

8200904,4,B000RIWB2A,"The transfer from the original Italian master is great, the color and image is sharp and very clear.  Be careful to set the language to English or you get the original Italian with sub titles.  Is it a masterpiece, no, but it is a fine specimen of the early 1960's sword and sexy women epics.",1214697600,6,292,4.290909090909091
8200905,4,B000RIWB2A,"Erik the Conqueror is a great film in TWO languages.

`Erik the Conqueror', directed by Mario Brava, explores the destinies of two young Viking sons, Erik and Eron.  Separated as young men during a British raid by the forces of Queen Anne, the brothers live in two different worlds.  Queen Anne raises Erik as her own son, while Eron lives a bitter life.  Growing to adulthood, the two men become enemies when Eron leads a Viking horde against the British commanded by Erik.  Behind the scenes, a malevolent Sir Rutford, plots to take the throne via marriage, or villainy.

A great battle ensues as the Norsemen attack England, and one death strike short of victory, the two brothers discover each other and declare peace as Rutford plays his card.  `Erik the Conqueror' is a stirring action film, filmed on rugged coasts, and executed splendidly in Italian and English!

Cameron Mitchell stars as Eron, while Alice and Ellen Kessler star as Daya and Rama, love interests for the two brothers.  George Ardisson, Andrea Checchi and Francoise Christophe round out the well cast film adding realism and romance to this 1961 cult film.

The return of `Erik' to american audiences includes an audio interview with Cameron Mitchell, film trailers, and the option to watch the film in Italian or English.  Try the Italian, and read the titles, you'll find the story tells itself.
