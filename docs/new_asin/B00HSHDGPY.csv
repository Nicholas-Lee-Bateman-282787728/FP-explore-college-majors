6203091,5,B00HSHDGPY,I read a few reviews that weren't so great but I actually really liked Moonfleet. I didn't know the story going into it like a lot of other reviewers which might have helped. It's a nice little adventure and I would recommend it to anyone that likes smuggler stories mixed with a little young love and the curse of Black Beard.,1406851200,,327,4.377049180327869

As someone who is not familiar with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-original-novel/dp/B0084CEDC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the original novel</a>&nbsp;by John Meade Falkner or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1955-film/dp/B0047DKLBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1955 film</a>, I still found myself enjoying the two-part miniseries ""Moonfleet"". It sets itself only one goal -- to be one of those rollicking adventure films that harken back to anything starring Errol Flynn. It's filled with familiar archetypes: the old sea dog, the wide-eyed youth, the feisty love interest, the aristocratic villain, the disapproving maiden aunt, and ticks all the necessary boxes of the genre: the cursed treasure, the night-time escapades, the prison break, the ship wreck... it might be predictable but it's also great fun, and reminded me of all those old-timey action flicks of the 1950s.

In the bay of Moonfleet a troop of smugglers are going about their business when the new magistrate decides to crack down on their night time activities. With one smuggler dead and two arrested, young John Trenchard (Aneurin Barnard) begs their leader Elzevir Block (Ray Winstone) to let him join his gang, believing the life of a smuggler to be the fast-track to fame and fortune. John also has his eye on Magistrate Mohune's beautiful daughter Grace, though her father is decidedly not impressed. In quick succession he shoots Elzevir's son and punishes Trenchard for having the gall to display interest in his daughter, and after a surprising twist, the two men find themselves on the run from the law.

Though the first half takes a bit too long in assembling its pieces, the second half of the miniseries races along at a cracking pace as John and Elzevir attempt to escape law enforcers whilst simultaneously hunting for a priceless treasure: the cursed diamond of Blackbeard, which promises ill-luck to whoever possesses it.

John Trenchard gets some nice character development, from a callow youth to a much wiser young man, and there's an interesting role reversal between himself and Elzevir. The story does not involve the young protagonist becoming disillusioned by the idolized father-figure, but rather the father-figure being horrified by the actions of the child and what he's willing to do to achieve his goals. Over the course of the miniseries, Elzevir's desire for vengeance and Trenchard's subsequent obsession with the diamond are put under scrutiny, leading to the tried-and-true moral of practically all adventure stories: that vengeance is futile and greed only leads to misery.

I couldn't help but feel that some aspects of the story were glossed over due to time restraints and that much of the original novel was lost as a result (heck, we didn't even learn WHAT the smugglers were trying to smuggle), and characters such as Mohune and his daughter Grace could have used more fleshing out. They demonstrate a few glimpses of three-dimensionality, but exist mostly as the self-righteous magistrate and the pretty love interest.

""Moonfleet"" is an entertaining bit of period fluff, solidly acted and swiftly-paced enough to gloss over some of the plot-holes, with very high production values (the scenes of the storm and the ship wreck in particular are amazingly well done). I would say that it needed a little more time to really explore the characters and their situation, but as it stands, it's a diverting two-hour adventure story.",1398297600,7,3648,5.48220640569395

8635404,1,B00HSHDGPY,this movie was kind of suspenseful in the middle but the pacing is pretty bad. The ending is soooo BAD! Almost like a B movie somebody might love just to be kitsch. LOL,1517097600,,168,4.121212121212121
8635405,3,B00HSHDGPY,"It was okay.  The production was good the acting was good. I was just expecting more.  It was just okay.  And it did not harken back to Errol Flynn. Those were huge productions on Galleons. These guys had a single sail skif.  It was good, just not as good as some of the reviews would have you believe.  Also the female character was very cruel in my opinion. Her thoughtless, self centered behavior caused a lot of pain. So as pretty as she was, I had a tough time feeling any sympathy for her.",1513555200,,495,4.223404255319149
