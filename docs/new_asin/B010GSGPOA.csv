8722485,2,B010GSGPOA,"This movie appears to be approximately 5 unrelated episodes of an animated Jungle Book series (one that I didn't know existed). They aren't awful, but they aren't good at all - it's not really worth renting. It's another example of off shore, low cost, CGI productions (this originated in India, I believe, but they come from all over - eastern Europe, Korea, etc.) being churned out and distributed through 5 different levels of companies to obfuscate their origin (I've seen adult films take more credit for their productions) who basically fill time slots on children's channels and take up spaces on the DVD shelves at WalMart.

Ironically, about 2 weeks after we watched this, I saw another (different) episode of this series playing on what I believe was Discovery Family (on Dish) and my 4 year old turned it off.",1446681600,,820,4.857142857142857
