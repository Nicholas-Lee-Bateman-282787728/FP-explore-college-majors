1884002,4,B00009MECJ,"I did not even know these new Robocop movies had been made. I take it they where T.V movies or something? However the big reason that they do not have part 4, 5, 6, or 7 on them is because it would have to be called Robocop 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4. These are a 4 part series all spanning over into the continuity of each other. I saw these DVD's for sale individualy on the shelf at very cheap prices, but I thought they where the TV series that was made a few years ago. They are not. These are 2001 made movies, each running for about an hour and twenty minutes and all continue the story into each other. But I never watched these untill I rented all 4 in one. Amazon don't show anything like it, but here in Australia it is titled as ACTION PACK 2, and is 2 DVD's with 2 double sided discs in each. The last one is the four Robocop series movies. On 2 flip sided discs.

The lowdown on the adventure is that it's ten years since robocop was made. He has been serving the public trust, protecting the innocent, and in some ways upholding the law. There are all new crime bosses in Delta City. And OCP as as in charge and as corrupted as ever.

Robo has a new cheif John Cableat the station who was Robo's partner when he was alive as Alex Murphy. Throguhout the first episode Robo is having memory flash backs of John, and eventualy John discovers who it is underneath the titanium armour known as Robocop. Eventualy John Cable is shot dead in the line of duty but reserected as the new and improved version as Robocop, but corrupted by an OCP executive, his first mission, while being unknown to anybody yet, is to frame Robocop by attacking the head of OCP and various other things. Robocop is then disgraced as a fugitive and hunted down to be taken off the streets. OCP send out Cable and introduce the public to the new and improved Robocop unit. Robocop tries to make Cable remember who he is. Will Robo make him remember or not? Eventualy another of OCP's executives gets his plan to make every hom ein Delta City run by the one mega computer operating in the OCP biulding will let nothing get in the way of his dream, even if it means murder. Eventualy when the machine is about to go online and take over everything in the city, a bad guy attempts to upload a virus on the computer that will spread to all computers, and then to humans!! Will Robocop be able to defeat the new and improved Robocop unit with his friend John Cable inside? Will Robo be able to do something about the new computer virus while being hunted down as a fugitive by OCP and Cable? Find out by watching, it might suprise you what happens in the end.

Overall I thought the whole thing was very interesting. Lots of comedy and fun and action, I thought some parts where pretty lame and boring. Some things I did not like, I hated the way Robocop sounded when he walked, being so used to the sound he is supposed to have, the new one did not work for me. There is no sign of an ED-209 anywhere in sight. During a grave sight scene, it shows Alex Murphy as having died in 1992, obviously they never bothered to work out what year Robocop (original) was supposed to be set in.

Apart from that the whole thing is pretty enjoyable. You'll have to own all 4 DVD's to enjoy the whole story line. Other wise it is just movies that don't make sense. Robocop's ultimiate challenge is another Robocop, new and improved and the man is also one of Alex Murphys best friends. So join Robo on an adventure through Delta City and see what happens if your interested.

1884003,5,B00009MECJ,"I didn't know about this 4 part series different than the 3 movies, and this one has entered the top 10 of my all time favorite movies. Its funny, its silly, its sad, and parts of it touched my heart because it shows us there is a human side to Robocop. I love whenever he moves, you hear servo motors, and its a scream how he turns. Robo cop has a heart, and it took me a 2nd viewing to see the things that blew past me the first time. He sees his grave site and he weeps, then he goes out and kicks some ass! I gotta get the whole set to see the next installment. ROBOCOP RULES!!!!!",1093219200,5,584,3.9159663865546217

In this movie he faces ""Robocable,"" his replacement, and the ensuing battles and chases are excellent.

1884005,4,B00009MECJ,"It seems that everywhere you look on-line to fine the DVD tech specs you get different answers.  Well, I'm here to set things straight.
This R1 release is issued in Anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) with English Dolby 2.0 Surround.  Surprisingly it's a good strong surround mix.  Dialogue, despite some negetive reviews of the broadcase version, is strong and easily understandable.
The R2 release however appears to be in Dolby 5.1, which is ashame because the R1 could have benefitted from a 5.1 mix.  But anyway...
Picture quality?  Pretty good for a TV show.  The only issue is with out-of-focus background lights.  They have that digital compression ""dot crawl"".  But other than that, all live action and special f/x look extremely sharp and clear.
Just recently bought this series in geer up for the new release of the Robocop Trilogy.  Now, I'd like to see the mid-'90s Robocop series released on DVD.  The only thing lacking in this series is the lack of use of Robo's automated targeting grid system.

BUT TROUBLE FOR ROBOCOP SOON COMES WHEN HIS SYSTEM STARTS TO BREAK DOWN ON HIM AND EVEN WORSE IS THE FACT THAT OCP HAS MADE A NEW ROBOCOP TO STOP HIM, WHICH IS MODELED AFTER ROBO'S MURDERED PARTNER, JOHN CABLE. THIS IS VERY VERY BORING AND IT'S VERY VERY POINTLESS. I MUST SAY THAT PAGE FLETCHER IS BY FAR THE WORST ROBOCOP TO EVER APPEAR ON SCREEN. HE MAKES ROBERT JOHN BURKE SEEM LIKE PETER WELLER.

1884102,4,B00009MECJ,"Confused at all the RoboCop titles you see on Amazon? Let's fix that. RoboCop: The Series is a 22-episode ,1994 Canadian television series based on the films, specifically, the series takes place between RoboCop 1 and 2. Richard Eden plays RoboCop in this version. Canada's Skyvision Entertainment paid $500,000 cash to Orion Pictures for TV licensing rights. The show is know for being made to appeal primarily to children and young teenagers, lacking the graphic violence that was the hallmark of the original film.

RoboCop: Prime Directives, the 2001 Canadian TV, 4 episode miniseries. Page Fletcher plays RoboCop in this series. Fireworks Entertainment was about to have the RoboCop license expire so they rushed this miniseries into production. It consisted of four feature-length (95 min) episodes: Dark Justice, Meltdown, Resurrection, and Crash and Burn. You can find them all listed separately on Amazon, but you can still find them. I actually recommend RoboCop: Prime Directives, directed by Julian Grant. The family-friendly TV 1994 series held no interest to Grant, and he returned RoboCop to his dark and more violent roots. The Prime Directives series takes place ten years after the original film, and ignores all events from RoboCop 2 and 3. The director has stated that he did not do this because he didn't respect the other films, but rather to give him some room to craft his own story. It defiantly stands up better than the kid-friendly series, but it has been often criticized for its low-budget look (special effects, locations, action sequences, and so on). It defiantly has its own style to it, and though it was put together rather quickly, its not a bad series.

To see them in order, you need to watch (1) Dark Justice (2) Meltdown (3) Resurrection (4) then Crash and Burn.

Prime Directives premiered in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel to lackluster ratings at the time. I still recommend it over the other live-action series, though collectors will want them both anyway. Lets just ignore the animated RoboCop series at the moment :)",1467849600,21,2073,5.020348837209302

1884214,1,B00009MECJ,"Everything about this movie is a monstrosity.  The only thing that would even be considered as descent is the story line.  How does a machine/human have the ability to cry?  Unless there's an evolution in his organic parts that allow him to have human fluids, there is no sense at all.  Then in the past, Alex Murphy looks like he's in his 60s, wasn't he about 40 when he transfered in Detroit in Robocop?  What was up in adding Star Wars into the mix?  The dual electrical weapon?  Do they really think incorporating other movie's elements would make it better?  Then how the world would you make something about the same?  15 years later, technology would be better and that would mean that improvements would be there when building another one.  How about a rocket launcher or a laser weapon?  Guess that's too smart to do.  I rather watch Robocop 3 which they also screwed up on.  The only true Robocop is Peter Weller w/ Paul Verhoeven and Irvin Kershner as the directors.  ALL OTHERS SUCK!",1278460800,,995,4.579545454545454
1884215,5,B00009MECJ,"Given that Robocop is as popular as he is, it's no surprise that a quality miniseries like this was produced. Everything from the writing to
the character arcs is splendid. Understand that this is not Hollywood, so the effects are not what you'd see in a summer blockbuster.

If you understand what this series represents, then you are in a for a great treat! Fleshing out the character of Alex Murphy is one of the most highly
sought after things in the Robocop world, so you are in a for a wonderful and fulfilling ride!

All things considered, I give this 4 part series 5 stars, due to the fact that I would rather have these, than nothing at all. That statement does not
detract from the series at all. The acting, and writing is on par with the very finest movies and tv series ever produced. It's a shame that more
money could not have been spent for better fx, but in all honesty, it DOES NOT detract from the series at all. ALL fans of Robocop should be pleased
with the product you are presented with. There is no cheese.... the production was quality enough to keep this from having any cheese factor, as
you would expect from a series of this caliber. Extremely entertaining!

5 stars, a very strong recommendation.

This four part movie (Dark Justice, Meltdown, Resurrection and Crash and Burn), shows the continued growth of the character Alex Murphy/RoboCop and his struggle to balance his current existence with the past life he knew.

1884218,3,B00009MECJ,"Supposedly RoboCop Prime Directives was originally a TV miniseries released in 2001. I'm not sure where it aired, but each episode is feature film length and the violence/language varies from PG to R rated material.

The series includes Dark Justice, Meltdown, Resurrection, and Crash and Burn...and the movies should be watched in that order for them to make sense.

Page Fletcher (from HBO's The Hitchhiker) stars as RoboCop. He does about as good a job as Robert John Burke did in RoboCop 3. In fact, the whole Prime Directives series is on par with RoboCop 3...and that's not a compliment. It's not really a knock either. It's a declaration that Prime Directives is an average sequel-set to what were two great initial RoboCop films (RoboCop and RoboCop 2).

Prime Directives takes place ten years after the first RoboCop. Alex Murphy/RoboCop is no longer needed in Delta City and is now considered a nuisance by OCP. John Cable, Alex Murphy's former partner, is killed and brought back as a new RoboCop and is instructed to destroy Murphy/RoboCop.

OCP is now in the hands of corrupt executives (one is a malevolent new CEO, one is Cable/RoboCop's ex-wife and one is Murphy/RoboCop's own son) and they have a new technology called SAINT that they will use to run the city and market to consumers ""to make all of your decisions for you"". But there is a terrorist that wants to infect SAINT with a computer virus that could take down all computers on the net and release a deadly nanotechlogy into humans.

All 4 episodes run apx 90 minutes each, so we're talking about 6 hours of 3-star RoboCop. So if you've got a rainy day and a craving for RoboCop, this series is for you.

As of this writing, the series is available as a set only from Amazon resellers, and the set is about 1/2 the price of buying all 4 separately. But Prime Directives is far from collector caliber, so I'd recommend just finding these to rent, and keep the viewing order that I mentioned earlier in mind.",1156723200,9,1982,4.681034482758621
