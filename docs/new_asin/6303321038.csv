7844014,5,6303321038,"Please somebody convert this fantastic documentary of horse racing legends to dvd.  Preserve the history of not only Secretariat but all the other triple crown winners, a feat rarely accomplished.",1370390400,,196,5.533333333333333
7844015,4,6303321038,"This documentary is one of the best I've seen when it comes to the history of the Triple Crown. It's outdated a bit now, but since there have been no Triple Crown winners since Affirmed, it's no real loss. It highlights each winner's whole career, interesting bits about their team, and any other horses that were important to their lives or careers. Wonderfully done!",1366848000,,368,4.765625
7844016,5,6303321038,"Please put this video on DVD (""Jewels of the Triple Crown""). With it looking more and more likely that we will not have another triple crown winner. It makes this awesome tribute to the great horses that have done it that much more valueable. My VHS copy is spent. Please!!!",1339113600,,274,4.5
7844017,5,6303321038,"I've had this for years.  I love this for it's amazing rare footage and excellent presentation.  NOw today my VHS part of my DVD player broke.  I put my treasured JEWELS OF THE TRIPLE CROWN in and it ate the tape...now it won't even accept a VHS.  BROKEN!!!  So I go online to replace JEWELS at once and what do I find????  NO DVD.  Nothing.  I can buy another VHS apparently, but I no longer have a VHS player to play it in . I am SOOOOOOO not happy right now.  Why is there not a DVD of this gorgeous piece of work?  Best shots of Secretariat running...great music to go with it.  Why is there no DVD and who can we contact to request a DVD?",1289433600,,643,3.984251968503937
7844018,5,6303321038,"The best horse racing documentary I've ever seen! It's written and narrated by the late great sports journalist, Jim McKay.

VHS description:

""The Kentucky Derby, The Preakness and the Belmont Stakes...these make up the 'Jewels of the Triple Crown.' In over 100 years, only 11 horses have conquered thoroughbred racing's greatest challenge.

Many of these legendary horses are hosehold names. All have stories sure to fascinate everyone who's ever been thrilled by a horse race. This exclusive video tells those stories and features rare film footage not seen by the public in decades.""

Indeed, each horse has a fascinating tale, (which is infused by McKay's captivating narration and natural storytelling), but my favorite is definitely Secretariat. Of course, I think his segment is the most exciting and action-pumping to watch. Yet I also have a deep affection for Whirlaway. Can't help but love that crazy and brilliant animal! And most especially, the unforgettable rivalry between Alydar and Affirmed. That classic Belmont footage still leaves me breathless.

The music that represents each era is another detail that I appreciate. It brings you back to the 1919's Sir Barton all the way to 1978's Affirmed. Excellent! No other way to describe it. A must-see and must-have!!! It's both highly entertaining and educational.",1288396800,,1331,5.319047619047619
7844019,5,6303321038,"Hands down I think this is one of the best horse racing documentaries ever.  Lots of great old footage you can't find anywhere else of some incredible horses. If you are fascinated by the Triple Crown you will love this!  If you're going to buy one horse racing documentary - buy this one, especially as it's getting harder and harder to find. I've watched it so many times I have it memorized!",1194393600,,394,4.458333333333333
7844020,5,6303321038,"What an exciting video for horse racing fans and just those who love horses. It was fun to watch the actual footage of the great racehorses of the past. Especially nice ,after reading  books on Seabiscuit, Secretariat, Man of War, Sir Barton etc. It brings those great racehorses to life. Also, some of the best jockeys of the past are included too.",1181779200,,349,4.629032258064516
7844021,4,6303321038,Facts on our triple crown winners. I loved it!(Captures the excitement of racing),1168473600,,81,5.3076923076923075
7844022,5,6303321038,"From Sir Barton in 1919 to Affirmed in 1979, Jewels of the Triple Crown is a video for every horse racing fan to own!
This video does include some of the non-Triple Crown winners who still played a role in the lives of other Triple Crown winners in some way.  These include Man O'War's match race with Sir Barton (yes, there is footage of this on the video) and the all too sadly lost Alydar's long lived rivalry with Affirmed.  At the time this video was made, I believe Secretariat, Seattle Slew and Affirmed were all alive.
JotTC made Whirlaway my favorite footage wise, showing the freaked out colt running off the TV screen in the Preakness because he was so far back, to turning the pressure up and coming up to win it!  You do need this VHS!  It's one of the best I own.
