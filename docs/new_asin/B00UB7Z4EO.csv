8705161,3,B00UB7Z4EO,"A group of 8 mercenaries break into an isolated secret Eastern Block facility on a mission to obtain/destroy a project deep inside a maze. The film is marketed as ""Scintilla"" and ""The Hybrid."" It isn't hard to figure out from the titles and DVD cover we are talking about some kind of human hybrid. Yes and PLOT SPOILER EXPLANATION OF FILM the DNA they cross humans with comes from a 2.4 billion year old meteor found in the Soviet permafrost. Forgetting the fact DNA breaks down, they cross it with human DNA and plan on getting an offspring from two hybrids that is more alien than human because....we can.

The characters were fine. I wish they had expanded them a bit more. Their entrance into the facility was good scene and started the feature off with promise. The maze wasn't too bad, but they could have made that better and the last third which was hurt by low budget.
