This stand up special may be a little bit dates, because it was made in 2010, but his jokes and rants still impact and make me laugh. People criticize him as unthinking, intolerant, or trite, but he observes, reports, and deconstructs aspects of American society in order to demonstrate the absurdity of them. The influences of George Carlin are evident in his routine and clearly enrich his performance.",1463270400,,483,4.9753086419753085

4164855,4,B003PU82CU,Bill Maher's comedy is smart and funny. He is wicked fast and uses language with surgical precision. However a bit too judgmental for my taste.

So, previous listings notwithstanding, it took three minutes for his usual ideology, Catholic bashing and inane sex jokes.  He really has found a way to turn the one trick pony into some semblance of a brand. The delivery is awkwardly hackneyed and he laughs at himself as a cue, since the audience was certainly not following in lock step; to their credit I might add.

This set just doesn't work for me. It was too much blather and preaching to the choir than comedy. The hour felt like an agonizing eternity to me, with his posturing and laughing at his political jibes, before he blurted them out. Like it was as if it were an inside joke, but, in reality, while the political observations were accurate, the humor was often missing or simply inadequate for the time he was onstage. There was too much time between ""jokes"" (observations) that actually had punchlines. Instead of laughing as often I had anticipated, I was just reminded, as nauseum, of how bad a shape we as a citizenry, really are in.",1456617600,,805,4.597222222222222

I like Sartre and Larry the cable guy. I also like to listen to didgeridoo and military music. I don't believe in God but that something's bigger than us.  Where do I stand in Bill Maher's little big universe ?!
He criticizes everyone that disagrees with him but always in a way that makes him look better; just like his movie about religion. Maybe his daddy didn't give him enough hugs or pats on the back, who knows... besides his therapist,  but boy is this guy hiding behind a BIG somescreen !

I enjoy comedy for relaxation and entertainment, but when it is a beginning to end statement of (either) one or the other party's views, it really just is more of a bash session.  Also, the discussion is very relevant to a certain point in time and history.

Kind of bitter, kind of depressing, as he never really offers a 'fix', just a bash.  It's vaguely reminiscent of the latter George Carlin routines.

You will laugh for a while if you agree with his politics; not so much if you don't.  And, this particular one is more of a history lesson than anything current.",1443139200,9,676,4.686440677966102

He's not a good comedian.  When he uses curse words, it seems forced and unnatural.  His voice gets high pitched and crackles and he comes off as whiny and childish.  He prances around stage with such smugness and dismissiveness that he honestly fills me with revulsion.  I also don't think that what he says is particularly intelligent or insightful.  It seems like his knowledge of the world is very superficial and he comes off as a newspaper reading blowhard who is too lazy or arrogant to read any books that might challenge his worldview.  Instead, he picks strawman fights with the dumbest people or dumbest political slogans he can find.  To see someone pushing 60 acting like this is pretty unsettling.  It's a shame because the world needs iconoclasts, not egotistical, superficially intelligent Liberal jackasses.  I gave it three stars because, in spite of myself, I do get a kick out of him bullying the religious and the stupid.

And with regards to the sniper comment he made a month ago-- snipers ARE psychopaths!  It's in the job description.  They're soldiers in the same way that animal researchers are veterinarians.  What happened to you Bill?  You're a caricature of yourself.",1424476800,2,1376,4.816239316239316

for a different kind of comedy which, for many standup comedians means foul language and potty issues. Too  too bad on many levels.

4165307,4,B003PU82CU,"Though performed and released in 2010, Bill Maher once again makes plenty of good points in But I'm Not Wrong (accurate title too- he's *not* wrong, hardly ever!)  I had a feeling going into this comedy routine that Bill's views on religion are, let's just say, less friendly compared to other views, haha.  He pretty much confirmed where he stands on religious matters on an episode of Jay Leno about a year ago.  He basically describes God and Jesus as fictional characters that people have been making up for over 2,000 years.  Do I agree with this?  Hmmm, haha.  Not really.  Mildly funny regardless though *incredibly* offensive to a person who's deeply religious (and understandably so).

The political side of the routine is sort of dated now.  Sarah Palin, John McCain, the inauguration of Barack Obama, George Bush, Hillary and Bill Clinton... these people are quite the topic of Bill's conversation since they were relevant and newsworthy in 2010.

My feelings overall on Bill Maher after watching this comedy special is that he makes several good points, is very offensive, nearly impossible to disagree with (except concerning the subject of religion of course which has always been debatable) and probably won't become religious any time soon... and neither will I.  However he's only funny about half the time.  Making good points and being funny aren't always one and the same, but humor is a matter of preference anyway.

No matter how one defines religion (including Bill Maher), religion is religion and God is God. The two are not the same. The way I see it, there are the many evolving religions of our world with their varying degrees of being God-Revealing (leading spiritually-minded truth-seeking soul-blossoming men and women to God). Then there are other so-called religions that have nothing to do with God (except that they use His Name, without permission, of course, to exert their powerfully manipulative control over others in a number of reprehensible ways not to exclude the rapid accumulation of material wealth achieved by gluttonously sucking the financial marrow from the monetary bones of their unsuspecting sheep, I mean...um, congregation). And then there is the personal religion of each faith-born child of God that is unique to each and every individual believer. That is primarily the one I am a big fan of. For the record (and because it is mainly how Mr. Maher mocked The Father and The Son in this show that triggered a critical response from me as expressed in this review), I make no claims about fully understanding The Paradise Trinity (but if my calculations are correct, I will have approximately all of eternity to ponder this intriguing mystery that for now I unequivocally accept by faith). I like the analogy of a tree with three branches more than others I've heard. One Tree. Three Branches. Tree = Trinity (Totality Quantity = 1). Three Branches = Father + Son + Spirit (Individuality Quantity = 3).

While it may not be a laugh a min. it is definitly funny with some great material by Bill Maher.",1303603200,6,468,4.753086419753086
4165315,3,B003PU82CU,"Maher is an intelligent guy who even if you don't agree with his politics frequently makes you say to yourself ""wow....I never quite looked at it like that.""  Unfortunately here, he mostly just rants and it's not that funny.  We get it Bill....you hate Bush, Sarah Palin and religion.  Don't need to spend 45 minutes on it.  It's all been done.",1302048000,12,344,4.590163934426229
4165316,5,B003PU82CU,"Bill Maher is brilliantly funny in his performance.  His ability to point out the obvious critical thinking flaws in our human psyche, including blind adherance to religious dogma without substantive reason and political satire has no parallel.  Yes, he excels at going there and has no qualms about taking us there with him!  We love you for it; Great job, Bill!",1300838400,3,363,4.918032786885246
4165317,5,B003PU82CU,I saw this on HBO and found it to be very informative and intelligent.  Bill Maher tells it like it is and not like the falsehoods you get on Fox news (and I use the term news loosely).,1297123200,3,185,3.8684210526315788
4165318,5,B003PU82CU,"If you are buying this you know what you are getting yourself into or want to open and cleanse your mind from all the hypocrisy, lies and rhetoric that is called ""News"" (faux news network).  Those with negative ratings probably didn't even buy the DVD, just post negative reviews because they are anti-Maher.  It is funny and mindboggling that is America.  A must watch.",1295568000,4,370,4.75
4165319,1,B003PU82CU,"""Champion of the Obvious!""  While I believe wholeheartedly in what Bill Maher has to say generally, he doesn't need to over use vulgarity to 'sell' his point of view.  Although the content of this DVD was right on, the delivery was terrible.",1295568000,7,241,4.714285714285714
4165320,1,B003PU82CU,"I saw this pathetic perfomance on TV. So, it was not necessary to flush my money down the toilet. Thanks, HBO! An interesting fact: this limousine liberal crudely mocked all major religions, except one. Any guesses?",1292112000,7,215,5.0
4165321,4,B003PU82CU,"I was at this show, and loved it. Obviously, I am a fan, or I would not have bought tickets.
Interesting thing about the show - it happened on Feb 13, the day after a massive snow storm moved over the entire state. But the show was sold out.
I know some complained about Maher not being as funny as he once was. And though this may be somewhat true, I have to say that I didn't go because I was expecting a laugh a minute evening. Maher isn't exactly a comic anymore. He is a commentator who uses satire to make his points. And I tend to agree with many of them. This wasn't the blue collar comedy tour, this wasn't Robin Williams. This was Bill Maher, doing an extended version of what he does on his HBO show. And that's what I like.",1291593600,63,735,4.075862068965518
4165322,5,B003PU82CU,"If you like Bill Maher, this DVD is for you. If you don't like Bill Maher but enjoy talking back to a DVD or enjoy being agitated by his views so you can blow off steam to your friends about what he says, this DVD is for you. If you can't stand Bill Maher you might want to buy this DVD anyway just to reinforce your negative attitude towards this clever, irreverant comedian who picks up where George Carlin left off.",1289433600,9,418,4.172839506172839
4165323,4,B003PU82CU,"He's one of the most intelligent and no-holds-barred comedic commentators of our time.  He's irreverent almost to a fault. If you're at all insulted by an in-your-face review of life as he sees it, Bill Maher will make you gasp.  To his credit, he's usually cuttingly on target and his wit and facial ""verbiage"" must be heard AND seen to be appreciated. He pushes his comedy to the limit and spares no one. I loved this DVD.  My only reason for giving it four rather than five stars was that he seemed a little forced at times and not as comfortable with his delivery as I expected. Perhaps that's because most of my exposure to Maher has been on his TV shows, where he interacts with other notables and plays off either their intelligence and wit or their stupidity. If you enjoy a great verbal punch, watch this guy put on his discerning mental gloves and start throwing jabs.",1287532800,21,878,4.509433962264151
4165324,1,B003PU82CU,This sad excuse for a comedian deserves to be panned because he's a real lamebrain strutting around insulting and degrading people and forces that are way above him. He's a dirtbag who should repent. We've all made mistakes so when he apologizes for all the garbage he's talked he can join the rest of us as a decent human being.,1287446400,12,329,4.5
