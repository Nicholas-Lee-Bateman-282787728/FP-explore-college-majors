There is not one second of sound from any of the in-country movie clips; people talk, trucks go by, helicopters pass overhead, NOT ONE SOUND. The producers waited until minute 29 to explain that sound is hard to come by with the early 16mm movies. So they fill the whole 60+ minutes with random music from the 1940's to the '90's. They also stuck ""www. Military Videos.com"" in the lower right corner of the screen for the WHOLE hour. Hey! I already PAID for this! I don't need your annoying name distracting me and covering the scenery! Also, they stuck huge blocks of words in scenes obliterating the action instead of inserting the descriptions in black-background segments. Finally, there is not ONE SECOND of combat footage. Gee, what were all those gun trucks for, decoration? I bought this vid at FULL PRICE because I own a 1968 M35A2 truck and I wanted to see more of what these trucks and their drivers were doing. This DVD was a real irritation. I will not be buying any more DVD's produced by these guys.",1409356800,3,1052,4.601063829787234
