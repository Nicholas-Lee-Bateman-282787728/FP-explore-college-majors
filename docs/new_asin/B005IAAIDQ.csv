4708445,4,B005IAAIDQ,Enjoyed but the fact that's they speak in German takes something away from it. You will love the views of Venice.,1358035200,,113,4.428571428571429
4708446,4,B005IAAIDQ,I like the wonderful views of Venice that are a major part of the film.  Good acting and choice of actors meets my vision of what the characters look like from reading the books.,1355097600,2,178,4.235294117647059
4708447,5,B005IAAIDQ,"Many thanks to German television for developing this series based on the Donna Leon novels. They are especially high-class. Thanks also, and perhaps especially to MHZ network in the US for making this series (and others, Montalbano etc) accessible to English speaking viewers.",1343260800,6,276,5.441860465116279
4708448,3,B005IAAIDQ,"The box contains two Donna Leon DVDs. While the first one was fine, the second one had a problem with the tracking--not due to my DVD player, but in the panning of shots. Whenever there was a shot tracking movement, the background got fuzzy and the picture seemed to skip a bit--very annoying. I actually meant to send it back, but forgot until now. I'd like to know if anyone else has had this problem before buying another one. That said,I enjoyed the DVDs that I purchased in terms of storyline. German,tho, doesn't have the same mellifluous sound as Italian, but since no one else has turned the series into DVD, I'll take what I can get. I would purchase another if I felt more sure about the technical quality.",1335312000,,716,4.515384615384615
4708449,1,B005IAAIDQ,"Both DVDs were defective and couldn't be played.  Be sure to save all packing materials so you can return them.  I didn't so am stuck with having paid and bad DVDs.  Ordered 3 sets - the Episodes 1, 2 was fine, but the Episodes 3,4, and Episodes 5,6 were both defective and couldn't be played at all.  Sad ...",1333324800,,309,4.186440677966102
4708450,5,B005IAAIDQ,"In this two disk set you get the Donna Leon format with a German production and a slight twist from here out. In episode 1-4 Joachim Krol and Barbara Auer played Brunetti and his wife while in 5&6 and the rest you have Uwe Kockirsch and Julia Jager taking over the roles. Other than that, and a few minor adjustments of getting used to the change in actors, the storylines are solid, the Venice settings great, and the productions still very good.
  The change in actors initially threw me and might throw you too, but then think of it as the James Bond movies and which ever Bond it is along with the various Q's and M's, it still works and works well. I had to do a double take on the new Brunetti as Uwe Kockirsch bears an uncanny resemblance to French actor, Armand Assante. That aside as well, Kockirsch holds his own and brings Commissario Brunetti to convincing depth.
  As for the continued series, well,for all of the scenic beauty of Venice Donna Leon shows us a seedy, darker side with Brunetti and crew doing their best to scrub it back to its glow through her pen.
  Good stuff here and a nice break away from the car chases and shoot 'em ups that seem to occupy most other police detective stories.",1327622400,17,1212,4.388392857142857
4708451,5,B005IAAIDQ,"I am enraptured with Venice -- what a magical place! I am also a great fan of Donna Leon's Guido Brunetti mysteries, in which fine writing, fascinating characters, timely issues, and complex plots mix with the wonder of Venice (and there's always a delicious nod towards succulent Venetian cuisine). What an irresistable combination! Over the years, I have become very fond of Commissario Brunetti and his family (and his colleagues at the Questura -- the police headquarters). Thanks to Leon's skill as a writer, they have come alive for me and I feel sure I could recognize most of them striding across the Rialto Bridge.  When I saw that these novels had been turned into television dramas, well, of course I was enthusiastic about watching them, and very curious about how well they would translate to the screen.  Overall, this series is a resounding success; however, there are a couple of important surprises to note: 1) While I did not expect them to be in English, I was certainly taken aback that they are in German! After the initial shock, the actors took over and soon I wasn't noticing the language difference. (The subtitles are well done and not intrusive.) The acting is excellent, and the dramas are faithful renderings of the spirit of Donna Leon's novels. Venice itself is as much a star in these episodes as any other character and the panoramic shots of the city are wonderful.  The viewer gets a real sense of the place. 2) The second surprise is that, after four installments of the series, the main characters of Guido and his wife Paola have been replaced by two new actors.  That was disconcerting, to say the least, especially as all the other actors remained the same, and the sets of the family's home and work remained unchanged. Weird. With regard to Guido, the second actor seems more like the character who exists in my mind's eye than the first, so I came quickly to terms with that change; as to his ""new"" wife, not so much. I didn't think she captured the essence of Paola's complex character as well -- but that's a small point and a subjective one in an otherwise excellent series.  If you are a fan of Donna Leon's, I don't think you'll be disappointed in this series.",1321401600,30,2208,4.680412371134021
4708452,5,B005IAAIDQ,"The actor playing Brunetti is now Uwe Kockisch, instead of ""what's his name?""; I think his wife has changed too.  Anyhow, here is the content:

Episode 5:  DEATH AT LA FENICE.  After a famous conductor dies from cyanide poisoning during the intermission of his concert, Brunetti probes into the maestro's past, and uncovers a shocking picture of immorality and ruthlessness - as well as a legion of bitter enemies... some of whom have held a grudge for many decades.  Based on Donna Leon's first Comissario Brunetti novel...

Episode 6:  FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES.  Brunetti's housing nightmare begins when a clerk from the land registry office tells him that his apartment lacks necessary paperwork.  When the same clerk dies ""accidentally,"" Brunetti begins to investigate, and learns how the real estate market in Venice really functions.

And, of course, you get to see the streets and buildings of Venice.

P.S.-  Look also at Episodes 7 and 8.",1321315200,14,945,5.025806451612903
4708483,3,B005IAAIDQ,"I think the cast in the first 4 dvd's works best -- I prefer Barbara Auer to Julia Jager .as Paola even though Auer has dark hair.  Auer is striking and has real chemistry with ""her"" Brunetti, JoachimKrol.

 As the series goes on it gets a bit ""cutesy"" with Brunetti's Mother, Patta being an over-the-top buffoon, etc.",1414800000,,318,4.543859649122807

4708487,3,B005IAAIDQ,"Unfortunately the producers chose German actors for the main parts. Even though the protagonists play well, they do not convey any of the Italian speech patterns, gestures and mannerisms that would give a real punch to Donna Leon's great stories.
Compares badly to RAI's masterful Detective Montalbano Series!",1393200000,,309,5.458333333333333
4708488,4,B005IAAIDQ,"I have ordered 8 of these DVD's.  all of them shift from normal color to a green/purple hue while running.  No problem with other dvd's, so its not the player.  These are expensive as dvds go, would have expected better quality.  The stories, acting, scenes of venice are all wonderful but the color really reduces enjoyment.",1390435200,2,325,4.75

4708492,5,B005IAAIDQ,"Beautiful Venice.  Great plots.  Took some time getting used to German being spoked rather than Italian. But the actors are

8474366,2,B005IAAIDQ,"I will not add what others have said about dubious and changing casting. This I would be  ready to live with, as long as the main character which is Venice itself was adequately showcased. But it is not. I believe this is not the creators fault  but the fault of Mhz and the image compression techniques they used. The DVD  is produced by MMz and like the Inspector Montalbano  DVD's I have purchased from them, the image quality is horrible. These series, Montalbano and Brunetti feature beautiful settings  and this is an important part of the story for the aficionados  I purchased the DVD's rather than streaming from MHZ in order to get a better image for my large screen TV and to be able to fully appreciate the quality of the series. The Inspector Brunetti images are a bit better than The Montalbano. The backgrounds are a bit sharper. However nothing similar to a good quality DVD. Also on some Brunetti DVDs, when the camera moves the background moves in a stuttering fashion which is very annoying. These are most probably artifacts from the compression process used. Not recommended.",1526169600,,1096,4.742105263157895

8474368,5,B005IAAIDQ,Love the series and books but the replacement actors are not as good as the ones in the first four episodes. The second Paola is blind and not very Italianate and Guido is not as appealing. Why make Paola a tall blonde.,1497398400,,219,4.238095238095238

It is not clear how often items are rotated.  But we have seen most of them.  Admittedly the actors are German, but they on the whole they are among the best in Germany and their individual careers are marked by high quality performances.",1469750400,,392,4.47887323943662

8474373,5,B005IAAIDQ,"Do you know how sometimes you'll start watching something and quite inexplicably, you will straight away fall in love with it? That is my relationship with the Brunetti mysteries.

The shows are simply magnificent. Everything about them: the actors, the scripts, the music, the plots, the scenery.

I have not read the books. Sadly, I have never been to Venice. I came into the series cold and at first, admittedly, I found the episodes a bit slow. But then I realized that this show is not your normal one-hour (or is that 40 minutes?) SVU. It takes its time. It is languid and although the subject matter can disturb, it is in essence calming.

So you need to go with the flow. The plots and subplots wrap around each other, and ebb and flow. The music swells and the beauty of Venice stupefies. There is really nothing finer than to sit down and fall into an episode of Brunetti.

Somewhere early on in the series the two lead actors (Brunetti and his wife, Paola) change. I was at first despondent. I liked the first Brunetti! But I have come to love the sexy, charming, yet boyish Uwe Kockisch. I have come to know his co-workers like my own co-workers, and his family has become my family. When his mother (and the actress who played her) passes away, I cried.

I have become invested in Brunetti's children, Raffi and Chiara, as they experience various growing pains and turn into wonderful adults. I laugh at his silly and vain boss, and smile at the all-knowing and alluring secretary. And I adore Guido Brunetti. He is kind, loving, caring, progressive, funny, smart, determined, courageous and occasionally silly.

I see this review is more of a love letter than a critique. There you have it. I love this show. Each episode (movie, really, at 90 minutes) is a work of art. Brunetti makes me happy and I am so grateful to the MHz Network for airing it.",1451001600,,1863,4.57957957957958
