8592485,3,B00DE6MV5E,"I pretty much like anything Arjun Kapoor does! This drama lacks the usual Bollywood ""feel good"" factor, but it is entertaining , if on the dark side. Arjun succeeds in what is essentially three roles, demonstrating that he is a talented and articulate actor destined for success!",1400630400,,279,4.957446808510638
8592486,5,B00DE6MV5E,Reminiscent of 1970's action Bollywood film but with a better thought out story line. Arjun is the epitome of Bollywood legacy. Prithviraj is bonafide.,1376956800,,151,5.333333333333333
8592487,5,B00DE6MV5E,"I had thought the double role act in Bollywood was dead but Aurangzeb resurrects it and gives it an interesting twist. Aurangzeb is based on the shenanigans of land grabbing mafia, the films  narrative execution and some great performances make it a worth while watch.
Yashwardhan (Jackie Shroff) is a illegitimate businessman running shady operations under the veil of legal business with the help of sharp nailed Neena ( Amrita Singh). He is world weary and equally fed up of his son Ajay ( Arjun Kapoor)who does nothing worthwhile except get in to trouble and beating up his girlfriend Ritu (Sasheh Agha).
 DCP Ravikant Phogat (Rishi Kapoor) is a corrupt police man who has serious career aspirations ( which I cant reveal) and one day happens to come across Ajays lookalike Vishal. Seizing the opportunity Phogat along with his equally corrupt but wavering nephew ACP Arya Phogat (Prithviraj Sukumaran) hatch a plan  to kidnap Ajay and plant Vishal. They are confident that they can uproot Yahsvardhan and break up his empire. However the film delves in to the issue of nature and nurture when their planted ally has a change of heart as echoed by the films opening lines from Roman poet Horace, `Deep in the cavern of the infant's breast; the father's nature lurks, and lives anew.'
Aurangzeb has several well written plot points and tightly written characters, this could have been a fine mini series. The back bone is ofcourse the great acting chops displayed by Rishi Kapoor, who lately is showing even more verve than his kid Ranbir. Jackie Shroff returns to form and so does Amrita Singh. However standing tall with distiction is Arjun Kapoor who proves that he is here to stay. The kid shines and leaves everyone panting. I am wating for his  film Two States.
The debutant director weaves a great tale of family and revenge against the backdrop of headline issues such as land grabbing, the rise of sleepy towns and ofcourse the psychology of upbringing which is influenced by the philosophy of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb.
Amartya Rahut and Vipin Mishra's music is pedestrian, I liked Jigra Fakira. On the whole Aurangzeb is a great film with great grey characters, a well written story with its delivery brisk and intersting narration. This is a good movie and you will enjoy it. Five stars. 8/3/2013",1376611200,2,2314,4.880407124681934
