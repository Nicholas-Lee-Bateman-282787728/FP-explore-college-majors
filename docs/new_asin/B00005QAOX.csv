7949872,4,B00005QAOX,"The fourth volume of Hideaki Anno's first director work is about teen-pair Jean and Nadia who finds the hard code of Nautilus by a number of incidents including the death of the Nautilus crew. Series of revelation does not end there compelling Jean to realize the cruel fact about his father's fate. Nadia got hurt about what has happened and her hatred toward Captain Nemo grew.

Verdict: Very heart-wrenching part of the series requiring some handkerchieves. (Particularly epidode #15)
Rating: 89 out of 100
Recommended for: Fans of both Hideaki Anno and Hayao Miyazaki works.",1187308800,,578,5.08421052631579
7949873,5,B00005QAOX,"Gainax Studios is something of a legend in anime circles, and deservedly so. Started when a couple of fanboys decided to go beyond being mere fans, it first created a couple videos for the large convention ""Daicon"", and then shifted into high gear, producing four works that are generally considered classics of the anime world: Wings of Honneamise, a startlingly realistic depiction of an alternative space program on an Earth that COULD have happened; Gunbuster:Aim For The Top!, a mecha-space opera which reaches scales of conflict beyond anything before or since; Otaku no Video, a self-parody and incisive look at the fanboy world; and Nadia: Secret of Blue Water (actual title would translate more as ""Nadia of the Mysterious Sea"").
Based on the world of Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and using an outline created by Hayao Miyazaki (known for his magnificent works like Totoro, Laputa, Princess Mononoke, and Kiki's Delivery Service), it takes place in 1899, at the World's Expo in Paris. Young Jean, a genius inventor obsessed with flight, is present to compete in the heavier-than-air flight challenge. He is, however, smitten when a mysterious, dark-skinned girl goes by, and he chases after her. The girl, Nadia, knows nothing of her own past, not even sure of where she comes from originally; the only remainder of her past life is a huge jewel called the Blue Water. Unfortunately, the Blue Water is being sought out by a number of forces, and pursue Jean and Nadia from Paris to the open sea to hidden fortresses. Their adventures feature gadgetry ranging from simple gliders to a multi-formed Victorian steam-tech transforming gadget called the Gratan, and weapons from normal bullets to the mighty Tower of Babel, a super-weapon capable of wiping cities from the earth. Captain Nemo and his Nautilus play a large part, though their origin is different from that of Verne's original.
The music is first-rate, and most of the episodes are wonderful as well, with some being pure character interaction and others slam-bang action second to none. The only flaw in the series is the infamous ""island sequence"" which not only doesn't advance the plot but features second-rate animation and truly stupid plot (if it can be called that); this was apparently due to Gainax realizing they were running short of money and needed to save some for a while in order to be able to make the finale of the series live up to the beginning.
Nonetheless, this is a top-notch anime series, good for any age range, and worth viewing whether you're 9 or 90.",1022803200,2,2562,4.9466357308584685
7949874,4,B00005QAOX,"This page oddly is identical, review-wise, to that of Volume 6, so I'll review both volumes here instead.  I will say, though, that the technical, aural, and voice acting aspects on both language tracks improve with each volume.  The content for these two DVDs, however, are what distinguish them from one another:
VOL. 4:  BATTLEGROUND:  ***** out of *****
This is the third best of the NADIA DVDs; we are treated to more touching character development (Nadia disrespecting other people who have opinions different from hers about killing and eating meat, Jean's insatiable curiosity and love for technology and Nadia), terrific action sequences (a wonderfully paced and executed chase sequence in Episode 13 where Marie and Sanson outrun a mechanical walker), heartfelt moments (Jean painfully getting a glimpse of the dangers of technology when it claims the life of a new friend of his, as well as he and Nadia bonding throughout the volume, especially the last episode), and some truly imaginative artwork (the lost kingdom of Atlantis on the last episode).  Definitely a nice pickup after Vol. 3, although not as strong as Vol. 2 or emotionally satisfying as Vol. 10.
VOL. 6:  THE DEEP BLUE SEA:  ***1/2 out of *****
The first two episodes are some of the best ever made in NADIA.  They conclude the Nautilus episodes, and feature technically spectacular animation (an amazing feat for a late 1980's show), terrific music, and an emotionally charged climax which will leave one stunned.  Unfortunately, the volume goes downhill in the second half, for we come to the studio-imposed filler episodes, ranging from mediocre to just plain awful.  These first two episodes -- which begin a useless arc called ""Lincoln Island"" -- are filled with disjointed plotting, uneven animation, occasionally bland artwork, and some uncharacteristic antics from our characters.  Although it might initially seem like a nice idea to extend the episode count from 26 to 39, the results here make one wish that the creators did exactly the opposite, for they threaten to sink (pun intended) the show.  Not only do these filler episodes not suit the story, but screw up character development, waste time, and feature one too many pointless sequences for even any funny ones to hold their own ground.  Be careful with this one.
OVERALL:  **** out of *****
Volume 6 is obviously weaker than Volume 4, but don't let me stop you from collecting both DVDs, especially if you've been following the show thus far.",1013731200,,2491,5.029197080291971
7949875,5,B00005QAOX,"This Anime-series is great!!!!! The story is a mix from 18th century lifestyle, upcoming 19th century technique, the story: 20.000 Leagues under the Sea from Jules Verne and a good portion Si-Fi.....
You get it all! The love, the submarine, the action, the fun and the tension of a fast-paced, hard-hitting storyline!
Thats FUN!! Get into the world of  Jean and Nadia!!
You will love it!!",1006819200,,388,4.878787878787879
