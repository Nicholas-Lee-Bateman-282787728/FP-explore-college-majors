4849554,4,B005NQSAO4,"This is a great series. I love the original, and this new set is good too. The animation is a big improvement from the old, and most of the voice actors are back. I don't like the voice actors for Xellos and Sylphiel though. The old one's were better. With a change in voice actors it's like the characters are completely different. The story is a little different too. We have the Slayers trying to lift a curse on a kingdom. Rezzo is the one who placed a spell on the village, and he is the only one who can lift it. Unfortunately his soul is trapped in a jar, and he's not cooperating. The story isn't as good, but it's still lots of fun. All the comedy is still way over the top. Overall this is a good series and any Slayers fan will enjoy it.",1350604800,2,748,4.095238095238095
4849555,2,B005NQSAO4,"For those of you who are aware of the wonderful legacy The Slayers has brought to anime fans for years, these last two mini-seasons are finally put together and spell the end of the illustrious end of a decade for our beloved heroes and unfortunately, it's not a very good one.  With unfinished story lines to horrible voice-over choices to strange new art styles, these two series' have a lot of problems.  For starters, the voice-overs were atrociously bad.  From Xellos to even Zelgoldis, the voices where just horrible even when you switched them to Japanese from English and vice verse, it seemed like it was bad all the way around.  It seemed like there was no escape from the horrible voices no matter where you turned.  In fact, the only one voiced correctly seemed to be the overly boisterous Nada the Living Armor...  and that's only because well... Nada is actually a joke on Nahga the White Serpent from the Movie/OVA series.

But apart from the voices, the story is just a mess, from Xanifar being resurrected to the idiotic and completely absurd reappearance of their first arch-nemesis Rezo/Shabranigdo/Phibrizzo.  So, from all of this, you get a completely bizarre and demented adventure that ultimately leads in an outright confused series that was an all-out failure IMHO to end an otherwise wonderful series. So in other words, unless you're a devote Slayers fan or simply can't find anything else to watch, I'd definitely stick with something OTHER than this series.  I was sadly VERY disappointed with this and I hope that this isn't the last we've seen of Lina Inverse.",1349395200,2,1591,4.862962962962963
4849556,5,B005NQSAO4,After all these years they finally decided to make another season of this classic anime. loved the first 3 seasons and now I can add these seasons to my collection.,1339113600,,164,4.5
4849557,3,B005NQSAO4,"There's been a lot of anime released in English over the past decade, sort of an explosion. But I will always have fond memories from the late 1990s release of The Slayers, Seasons One through Three. Lina Inverse, Gourry Gabriev, Zelgadis, Amelia Wil Tesla Seyrune, Zangalus, Syphiel, Martina, and the Mysterious Priest Xellos. They are like old friends coming to visit again. But it seems you can't go home again, at least with this new effort.

Seasons 4 and 5 actually constitute a regular full season when you put them together. If you were wondering what is new in the life of Lina and Gourry, or Zelgadis and Amelia, they have frozen in time. We don't know if they're dating, friends, or just unaging cartoons like the kids on The Simpsons. Instead, the star of this season is ""Pokota"", a stuffed animal. Yes, he's the animating spirit of a long-dead prince, but it's still a sock puppet. Why they thought we'd take this seriously in any remote way is beyond me. It would be like they made a fish man a starring member of Lina's adventurers. (Hmmm, that might not be a bad idea, in contrast.)

Having watched Seasons 4 and 5 through, I am re-watching the original 3 seasons now. I suppose I feel like one of those Star Wars fans who just does not get the child-targeted prequels. The Slayers has been dumbed down into a children's cartoon, and I will have to be content remembering the greatness of Lina battling Demon Dragon King Gaav, of Auntie Aqua asking Lina what her feelings are regarding Gourry, of Amelia standing atop a church steeple to the wonderment of the townfolk below, or of Zelgadis lamenting being reduced to a mere sidekick.

You can't catch lightning in a bottle, and the genie escaped on this new effort. Won't be watching it again. Instead, I will remember Lina and the others from the lyrics of Jama wa Sasenai:

Let's go to the future we thought when we were kids
To that same starry sky we used to see",1329004800,11,1933,4.561959654178675
4849558,4,B005NQSAO4,"It's been over a decade since there was a new season of ""Slayers,"" but better late than never.

And ""Slayers: Complete Seasons 4 & 5"" (which is really more like one longer season split in half) is a solid fantasy-comedy anime, although it suffers from some wobbles in execution (a replica of the Sword of Light?). Not only is it fun to revisit Lina, Gourry and their colorful unruly world, but the writers introduce some clever twists and concepts along the way, while dipping into some surprisingly dark subplots.

Lina and Gourry have been busy nabbing pirates on the high seas, but they're unexpectedly interrupted by Amelia, Zelgadis, and the Ruvinagald Inspector Wizer, who promptly arrests Lina for ""the crime of being Lina Inverse""... and for blowing up some magic tanks with the Dragonslave.  The actual culprit is actually a sort of... flying stuffed bunny thing called Pokota, who can cast almost every spell Lina knows AND has a Sword of Light replica.

The gang ends up on the road again, pursuing Pokota and being dogged by Wizer. And after many wacky adventures, Pokota brings them to the long-lost city of Taforashia, whose people are locked in a magical sleep (courtesy of the Red Priest Rezo). Unfortunately, an evil countess and her three minions are using Taforashia's magical technology for themselves, unleashing a devastating force on the entire world.

But that isn't the end of their adventures, as Lina and Co. go off to find the Hellmaster's Jar, a magical pot that contains the soul of Rezo. Unfortunately, Xellos is also trying to get his hands on the jar, and Pokota is determined to resurrect Rezo for the sake of his people.

I'm not entirely sure why they decided to split this season into two smaller seasons, ""Slayers Revolution"" and ""Slayers Evolution-R."" But it's a pretty decent fourth chapter to the Slayers saga -- we have the usual slapsticky high fantasy, some darker subplots, and lots of big flashy magic battles. And of course, Lina and Gourry eating, fighting and chasing bandits (or, er, pirates).

There's plenty of hilarious dialogue and comic relief (Gourry's special bond with a jellyfish chimera), especially in the hilarious ""soap opera"" episode (""The shock of the accident's given me amnesia!"" ""I have amnesia too!""). But things get much darker in the second half of the season, with some gruesome deaths, creepy monsters (hair tentacles!) and a horrific flashback where we see how poor Zelgadis became a chimera.

The biggest problems are that some of the plot points seem kind of hokey (an exact working replica of the ""Sword of Light""? COPOUT!) and the Epic Climactic Battle feels like a copy of a previous Epic Climactic Battle from way back in the first season.

Lina is still bombastic and a little crazy, but she also seems more intelligent this time around, since she's apparently able to unravel people's nefarious plots. Gourry is good-hearted and dumb, Amelia is a little more savvy about real life (though she still loves ""justice!""), and poor Zelgadis is forced to relive the horrors of his transformation into a chimera -- the scene where he finally confronts Rezo's soul is hauntingly powerful.

Oh, and a few familiar characters return: Rezo has a major role in the second half of the story, Xellos is still keeping secrets, and the mysterious ""Nama"" seems awfully familiar to Slayers fans.

""Slayers: Complete Seasons 4 & 5 (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)"" sounds like it's a lot longer than it is, but it's basically your average Slayers season -- lots of wild, crazy fantasy action with some darker parts.",1327104000,5,3565,4.934891485809683
4849559,4,B005NQSAO4,"(This review is for the DVDs only as I lack a Blu-Ray player.) Reviews of the two series included with this set are already available on their respective pages, so I'll get to the important thing first. If you're a fan of the old 3 season series of Slayers (Slayers, Slayers Next and Slayers Try), you should get this set. It's great to see the old gang in action again, and the return of the English voice cast is fantastic (if you're a fan of the dub.) The packaging on this 2-season set is minimal, but fine. It doesn't have the flimsy feel to it that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slayers-Seasons-1-3-Box-Set/dp/B002BWD764/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slayers: Seasons 1-3 Box Set</a>&nbsp;by Funimation did. For the price, this set really can't be beat. It includes both the DVDs and the Blu-Rays of Evolution-R and Revolution, and the quality is fantastic. I avoided buying the separate releases of the series due to the price and this compilation made things a lot more affordable.

As for the two seasons. If you've never seen Slayers before, I would recommend watching the original show prior to watching these two seasons. The show doesn't go very far out of its way to explain who people are or what's going on, but that's understandable. If you are a fan of the old series, prepare to be dazzled by seeing your old favorite characters in modern, shiny, colorful digital animation, but also be prepared for the extreme level of hyperactivity in the first half of the first season on this set. While some might argue that the show was slow and dragged on initially in its original first season, Slayers Evolution-R is downright frantic for the first half. The characters hardly pause between stepping on each other's sentences, they're loud, noisy, and generally more a stereotype of themselves than they used to be. The best attributes of all the characters- Lina's passion for black magic, Gourry's memory lapses, Amelia's vows for justice- are made extreme and nearly obnoxious. That being said, I would still recommend this series. Once the actual plot comes into play, the behavior of the characters calms down back into their normal levels of craziness. The plot is enjoyable, especially for fans of the original show due to returning plot threads and characters, and continues into Revolution.

As for the dub cast, Lina, Gourry, Zel and Amelia are all returning. Xellos, Sylphiel, and all minor characters are not. Zel and Amelia sound absolutely identical to how they did 10 years ago when the original Slayers series were dubbed, but Lina and Gourry's actors don't quite have the same handle on their old roles. Gourry usually sounds higher pitched and a bit more squeaky and panicky than he used to. Lina, in the introductions and first episode, sounds extremely squeaky and hyper (moreso than she did originally!) but regains her old Lina voice partway through the show. As I watched it I got more accustomed to their ""new"" voices, but it may be a little off-putting initially for fans of the original dub. With the exception of Prince Philionel (as far as I know), the entire Japanese cast returns for this if you're more interested in the original dialog.

If you love Slayers- get this set. It can't be beat for the price and it's wonderful to see the gang in action again. If you've never seen Slayers- check out the original and see if it's your thing.",1326758400,14,3426,4.954782608695652
4849580,5,B005NQSAO4,"These two seaons really feel like a single season of the show but they are so much better than Slayers Try ever was. I watched Try once and i had to force myself to get through it all. I never could put my finger on what made that season so boring.

I you enjoyed the first two seasons of Slayers then you'll enjoy these two seasons just as much (maybe not quite as much as Next.)",1451347200,,380,4.0

4849582,4,B005NQSAO4,"Not nearly as good as the rest of The Slayers. It still has it's moments.

Good to see the cast again I guess, as the main characters have always been the best part about The Slayers. It just seems the filler episodes aren't nearly as fun as they used to be.",1437177600,,258,4.0588235294117645

4849585,4,B005NQSAO4,"The final two seasons of slayers are a must own for any fan. Season 4 and 5 are only 13 episodes each totaling to a great 26 episode finisher for this long enjoyable series. The four and fifth season are more comical than the previous three seasons and are well worth the price. Its best if one thinks of season 4 and 5 as just one season all together since the arc does not change. There are criticism that the fifth season is just like the first re-using the same enemies and have Lina fight against Rezo the Red Priest and other demon lords. Nonetheless, the four and fifth seasons are must own for any fans that did not like were the third season ended off.",1429315200,,661,4.253968253968254
4849586,3,B005NQSAO4,"I am a fan of the Slayers series so I was really excited to watch the new seasons. The episodes range from okay to good but they are far from great. The art is polished and some of the spells look cool! Lisa Ortiz just didn't capture Lina's voice like she did in the past. I actually thought that it was a different voice actress. I found Xellos' voice to be very annoying now as well. He did not have the perfect timing and tone to portray the character well. I liked Slayers, Slayers Next, and Slayers Try a whole lot more than these so I was a bit disappointed. I would recommend these seasons to hardcore Slayers fans only, but be prepared for a mixed bag. There are some really good songs on here though such as Plenty of Grit which helps to soften the blow.",1427155200,,763,4.197278911564626

the box set outer insert is actually dual sided. the inside artwork is very nice and i like they made that extra effort to do that. shows love for the fans indeed. the special features are the same, the second disc of each season has both clean openings and ending themes, as well as trailers for other shows. so hopefully this helps you.",1351209600,,1135,4.004405286343612

8480739,4,B005NQSAO4,"This series takes place after the action contained in the first 3 series.  Ostensibly these are seasons 4 and 5, but they're only 13 episodes each.  What I liked best about these pair of series is the ""updated"" character designs and animation generally.  The original Slayers today definitely shows their age as 1990s shows, but this series takes advantage of all the capabilities of 21st century anime technique.  The only thing that comes close to this newer release visually is the last of the Slayers ""prequel"" movies, the short ""Slayers: Premium"", which also features the regular television cast instead of Young Lina and Naga.  The prequel movies were released by ADV Films (now defunct) and are out of print, while the television series has all been license rescued and re-released by FUNimation.  Hats off to FUNimation for getting back most of the original cast for one last hurrah, including Lisa Ortiz voicing the more mature Lina (Cynthia Martinez voices ""Young Lina"" in the prequels).  I was a little disappointed they didn't develop the romantic tensions between Lina and Gourry that they introduced in Season 3 but then cheated their way out of with a convenient, plot-specific memory-wipe.  At most I think Amelia makes some kind of remark about Lina liking Gourry and Lina blushes and changes the subject.  Lina has gotten smarter and wiser since the original 3 series and is less inclined to not ask questions and just blow things up.  She does still blow things up, of course, but she does at least try to reason her way out of things first.  She's better with nuance and mystery than she used to be.  All in all, I really enjoyed this latest installment of the Slayers franchise.",1453939200,3,1699,4.861111111111111
