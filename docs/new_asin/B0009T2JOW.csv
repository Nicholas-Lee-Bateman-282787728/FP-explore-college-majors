However, I was so dissapointed that I had to share my experience to prevent others from falling in the same trap. I made the mistake of buying the entire kickboxing series (3 DVDs), thinking that I could get a jumpstart in my kickboxing training with these DVDs. To my surprise, all 3 DVDs in the series do NOT have any audible explanations of the techniques/moves contained in the video, making this DVD impossible to follow and a huge waste of time and money.

Thinking that I may have obtained a ""bad"" DVD series, I've been calling the distributor for assistance, but not surprisingly, I can only reach the sales department (instead of customer support) and no one seems to be able to help me.

My last resort was to put a complaint with my credit card and see if I can get my money back so I can close this horrible chapter. Please do yourself a favor and DON'T order this product!!",1157241600,2,985,4.4972067039106145

I use this every weekend, and I have received great results. Its great for everybody. It is also good for children. I use it to blow of ""steam"" after schoool,it is highly effective.
It keeps you strong and fit, and now I can do more then before. I can pick up heaver boxes, and my back pack doesn't seem as heavy even though it has gotten heavier!
Also, because it is a DVD the color and sound is remarkable.
Thank you.",997056000,13,540,4.10377358490566
