8122882,4,B000FIE7NI,"I purchased this dvd as a gift for my niece; it is a used one so I was able to watch it before giving it to her. You need to remember that all animals just like people are different and what works for one may not work for another. I do have to say you need to be able to put your hand in your puppies/dogs mouth cause at some point you will need to brush their teeth with out losing your hand. Also, extremely important that you play with their paws so you can clip their nails. Don't wait til they are full grown or you think they are over teething; the sooner they get use to it the better. This is just me but, I would not encourage digging at all; not even in sand loaded with toys. And hiding their poop and covering it up with dirt may or may not work; some dogs (yuck like to dig it up and eat it). As far as, barking goes well some dogs just never learn; I did think her ideal on that was worth trying. The best one was on the jumping. And of course, with every training trick you use you must keep on repeating it til you think they got it. I found the best thing for me and my dogs was to distract them and praise them. Plus, we would go for very long walks so they would be to tired to be bored and get into things. You need to be the judge as to what works best for you. Good luck.",1351641600,,1293,3.828358208955224
8122883,4,B000FIE7NI,"This is a pretty good resource for helping you cope with specific behaviors (mouthing, biting, barking, jumping, and digging) of your new puppy.  Puppy energy won't be ignored, so you'll have to deal with it somehow, and this DVD provides the basics for these problem behaviors.  The success of these training techniques will likely depend more on your consistent application of them than on your particular dog.",1297900800,,412,5.134328358208955
8122884,3,B000FIE7NI,"I was really looking for more info on how to prevent biting and aggressive behavior. The digging info was great. Just wish there was more info about real naughty behavior like potty ideas, dominance, yucky behavior - nuisance/non-acceptable issues.",1224201600,2,248,5.384615384615385
8122885,4,B000FIE7NI,"It is an okay dvd. There was alot more info on barking though. I didn't need that, but I did for the digging. Some very helpful tips to stop that.",1198022400,,146,3.9
