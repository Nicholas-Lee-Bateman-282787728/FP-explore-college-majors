The retro-ambience of the film is well-done and the situations in which these two incompentent salesmen find themselves are laugh out loud funny. This is the second independent film for Mr. Catizone, the first being Encounter:Omzion, and he seems to be able to work in both the comedy and scifi/fantasy genres with equal enthusiasm and capabilty. Anyone who has ever been to a bush party, annoyed by their parents or aggravated by their boss will appreciate this film.",1324252800,,543,4.787234042553192
