8474821,5,B005C5UHJW,"This had a bunch of student shorts plus some short films from the company that made the class.

There were five shorts. All were great especially considering that they were these new director's first efforts.

The first one was the beginning of a Steam Punk movie. I really would like to see this expanded further.

The second one was a reluctant hero type of adventure.

The third was a zombie movie with a twist that you saw things from the viewpoint of a zombie who was coming to awareness that she was indeed a zombie.

The fourth was a hip mockumentary about a place called the CATI Lab. It was some funny stuff these office workers had to say.

The fifth film, I was unprepared for. Let me just warn you, this movie contained castration and attempted abortion. And it was hilarious! I never laughed so much in my life. I don't see how I could be made to laugh with these topics but I did. I think this director was Troma inspired. If you don't know what Troma is, don't ask! This was way over the top. It's about a strange demonic guy who picks up a prostitute. The condom breaks when they have sex. You will have to see for yourself what happens to the condom when it is disposed of on the ground.

SPOILER ALERTS

The prostitute then becomes fully pregant in 9 days and can't get any customers because she is so heavy. So she tries to get an abortion. You won't believe where! But the abortion fails and a demonic baby takes revenge on the abortion doctor by strangling him with the coat hanger that is still lodged in his head. Sick sick stuff but done very humorously.

It says there is more story to be told and then ends. Wow! I want to see that.

I don't believe they let the last director make that movie. But as I understand the company who held the class allowed total freedom no matter how obnoxious the student's visions were. I also understand the company also has some pretty raunchy stuff of their own.

There is something for everyone here.

I hope to see more from all involved in this great collection.",1310947200,,2026,4.373333333333333
