8238669,5,B0010V61CE,"C. C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) works in a large office on a lower floor in a pool. He is enamored with the elevator girl Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine.)

It turns out that Baxter has one good attribute that may help him move up the corporate ladder; the key to his ""apartment.""
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I think it is a great story and well executed. There are a lot of details and clues as to what is to happen and who the mystery person is in Fran Kubelik's life. I am mot saying. One may think this is a timeless film, but at least the technology is dated; look at the steno pool equipment.

Directed by Billy Wilder, the director of ""Sabrina"" (1954). You may even finish the film before realizing that you were engrossed in watching anticipating and maybe a little kibitzing.",1500854400,,817,4.821428571428571
