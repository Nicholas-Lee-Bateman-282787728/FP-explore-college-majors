8148129,4,B000IZJR38,"I bought the DVD primarily because Shahrukh Khan is in it; however, I like the film for its own content as well. Shahrukh was very young then. The movie is more of a romantic comedy/drama mix and emotions get pulled on a lot.. Bear in mind how long ago it was made so that you won't put your expectations too far ahead of its time. Also, It has twists so you can't think you already know what's going to happen until it begins happening.",1368403200,8,437,4.214285714285714
8148130,5,B000IZJR38,"This is a great movie too.  I would recommend this to anyone and I would also suggest everyone see this movie. Shahrukh plays a great part- falling in love with this girl, there is a terrible accident-car.  They both survive but the girl is left blind. The families don't get along, and even in Shahrukh's(Guddu) family there are religious differences.  Guddu finds out he has a tumor, and he wants to give his eyes to his love. Which he finds out he does not have long to live, but there is an operation that will help him if it is successful-it is a slim chance it will be successful.  Guddu's father fights Guddu on him giving his eyes to his love-they go to court over this.  This is a wonderful movie and t is great to see how it turns out and how different religions come together and get along-it doesn't just have to be religion it can just be different people.  WE SHOULD ALL GET ALONG NO MATTER WHAT.",1180396800,18,910,4.323529411764706
