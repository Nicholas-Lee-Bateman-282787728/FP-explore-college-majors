8062788,3,B0009KS904,"Stiletto is a film that did not age well, because, when it was made, in 1969, it was way too trendy, without any enduring substance. This is not surprising, considering it was based on a Harold Robbins book, whereby it is totally commercial, without the slightest concern of being thought-provoking or having any other form of intellectual merit. It has plenty of action and sex, which, by today`s standards, are very mild and ho-hum.
I gave it 3 stars only because it does have an impressive cast of actors who, at the time the film was made, were little-known, but have since become big-name actors, most of them far surpassing the film`s protagonist, Alex Cord. The film does have one more attribute: the penthouse apartment where it was largely filmed; it has the largest and most impressive swimming pool I've ever seen in a private apartment - the film may be worth watching just for the penthouse!",1480291200,,904,4.764331210191083
