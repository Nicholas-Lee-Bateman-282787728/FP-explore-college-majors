8339935,5,B001SJPLE2,"RKO Studios produced (1933) this wonderful story of John Wells about a hard-pressed young woman (Ginger Rogers) and a young man (Norman Foster) falling in love in `1930s Greenwich Village. They come to New York to work but unable to pay the full rent; they find an apartment with an arrangement with the landlord. She will occupy the same apartment during the evenings/night when the man is at work, and he takes over during the day when she is at work. The two roommates never met but they definitely make opinions about each other. He thinks she must be a fussy old spinster and she thinks that he is a crabby and belligerent young man. They complain about each other to the landlord but to no avail. He never gives them away! They finally meet at a place away from the apartment and fall in love. This is the second movie together for the young and upcoming actors in 1930s Hollywood. Both of them did well in their first film Professional Sweetheart. Norman Foster was on loan from Fox Studios to do this movie for RKO Pictures. William Seiter directed this film with George Sidney, Robert Benchley and Laura Hope Crews in supporting roles. RKO Studios re-made this film again in 1937 under the title Living on Love with James Dunn and Whitney Bourn.",1464739200,,1254,4.602678571428571

8339939,5,B001SJPLE2,"A fun tongue-and- check comedy with a subtle, sweet romance at the center of this opposites attract film.  A man and woman share the same apartment as a solution to affording the rent all with the help of an unexpected matchmaker.  One of Ginger Roger's best films!",1429747200,2,265,4.617021276595745

8339941,5,B001SJPLE2,Rafter Romance is probably one of my most favorite movies that Ginger Rogers ever made other than some Fred and Ginger movies.,1391644800,3,126,4.7727272727272725
8339942,4,B001SJPLE2,"The premise is interesting. Two tenants in an apartment building that are behind on their rent are forced by their landlord to share the attic apartment. One works days and the other nights, so they get to be ""home"" in 12 hour shifts. They resent the arrangement and immediately hate each other without having ever met. They play some pranks on each other, which add to the mutual mistrust. Unknowingly, they are falling for each other, having met in the real world, not realizing who the other really is. This is a precode production, but there isn't anything too shocking in it. At one point when she is alone in the apartment Ginger removes her suit jacket and what had looked like a blouse is obviously just a scarf draped around her neck and tucked into the front of her skirt. As she prepares to shower you see her feet as she steps out of the last thing she had on. Nothing improper occurs between the two ""sharing"" the attic apartment, though Jack (Norman Foster) is being pursued by an alcoholic wealthy matron (Laura Hope Crews) who wants to ""forward his career,"" but he wants nothing to do with her. Mary (Ginger Rogers) is receiving undesired attentions from her new boss (Robert Benchley). Something about Ginger Rogers movies--no matter how poor her character is supposed to be, she always manages to have very nice clothes. This isn't one of Ginger's best movies, but it is a fun little diversion.
**Some may be disturbed by the Jewish landlord's son chalking swastikas on the wall by the payphone. When his father scolds him he replies that it is for luck. Consider when this was made.",1253404800,9,1601,4.660777385159011
