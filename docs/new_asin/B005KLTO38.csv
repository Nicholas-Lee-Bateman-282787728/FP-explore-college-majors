8476938,5,B005KLTO38,This movie is very entertaining and manages to be authentic Mexican.  The humor is subtle and funny.  The plot is entirely original.  I saw it in the theater and bought it for my Spanish speaking friends.,1324425600,2,204,4.611111111111111
8476939,4,B005KLTO38,"Maybe C. Scanlon saw an edited version of this movie on DVD. I saw it in a theatre and the points he mentioned seemed clear in the movie.

The woman who lived with Chema (Jesus Ochoa) was his daughter. The two brothers seemed easy to tell apart to me: Julian (Miguel Rodarte) was the older brother who killed a man after his father's death and then rose up in organized crime; Juan (Juan Carlos Flores) was the younger brother who stayed with their mother, moved to Los Angeles with her, and eventually joined the Army and went missing in Iraq. Carmelo (Gerardo Taracena) the Indian character had more depth than C. Scanlon saw - it was shown that he had been Julian's best friend and right-hand man as he took over the criminal group but at some point Carmelo broke with Julian. It was implied he couldn't live with the things Julian did as a crimelord.

Overall, I found this a good action movie. It did have more comedy moments than its American equivalent would have had but I didn't find that a problem - American action movies often take themselves too seriously.",1320710400,3,1069,4.533678756476684
