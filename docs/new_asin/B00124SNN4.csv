8243896,5,B00124SNN4,"Flatt & Scruggs pretty much ""wrote the book"" for first class professionalism, as well as first class Bluegrass music. These videos may be over 50 years old, but are solid testimony that Lester & Earl have NEVER been surpassed--even by today's standards.",1391644800,,253,5.0476190476190474

8243898,5,B00124SNN4,"Another 5 star stellar performance from Lester and Earl and The Foggy Mountain Boys.  I remember as a kid how excited I would be when Lester and Earl were guests on The Beverly Hillbillies Show.  These well preserved vintage tv shows are a real treat not to be missed for the Flatt & Scruggs fan.  If you are not a fan, you will be after you view these DVD's.  Thanks to all who made these wonderful shows available.  They are classics!  I am already looking forward to the release of volume 6 & 7.",1209427200,5,498,4.24468085106383
