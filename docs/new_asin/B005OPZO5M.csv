8481672,5,B005OPZO5M,It makes a great gift...my friend thought it was cool.,1416268800,,54,4.5
8481673,1,B005OPZO5M,"This is the absolute worst video I have ever seen in my life!  Trust me... I gave it a shot for a solid 20 minutes and the only regret I have is that I wasted 20 minutes of my life.  If you are a Blink 182 fan this is as close to torture as you can get.  A bunch of nobodies talking about nonsense.  i can't believe I have to give it ""A"" star just to post this.  Consider it my sacrifice for all Blink fans. I actually feel speechless... IT. IS. HORRIBLE!",1406160000,,455,3.849462365591398
8481674,1,B005OPZO5M,I expected the band to be talking and have more involvement in the film so I found out that it said no interviews with the members when I unwrapped and played it. I highly don't recommend buying this,1362700800,,199,4.2631578947368425
8481675,1,B005OPZO5M,This product is not at all what it seems it will be when you order it. It has no music from the band and is full of almost pornographic like images. The quality is awful. I sent it back immediately. The fact that this is even being sold without a rating or warning about the nudity is very offensive. I wish I did not even have to give this one star. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY PURCHASING THIS!,1357603200,2,399,4.0
8481676,1,B005OPZO5M,"I'm a huge Blink fan so when I saw this Documentary I was stoked and thought even if it's not that great it will still be worth it. Well it was the worst piece of trash I've ever laid eyes on. No Blink music, the same b-roll shots over and over and over and over and over. I'm pissed that I spent money on this but I'm more pissed that I actually wasted an hour of my life that I can never get back. It had about 10 seconds of actual band interview footage. The production was a disgrace. This is someone trying to capitalize on somebody's success. Very sad.",1329609600,6,558,4.081818181818182
8481677,1,B005OPZO5M,"I got this box set as a gift for my brother because Blink 182 is one of his favorite bands. When I received the item I noticed on the back of the box that this dvd was not authorized by the artist. That was a red flag and also the fact that whoever created the box cover spelled authorized with an ""s"" instead of a ""z,"" so I knew that this could not be legitimate. I returned the dvd for a full refund because I did not feel comfortable owning it, not to mention that the dvd is supposedly horrible from what I read. Don't waste your time buying this junk.",1324512000,5,556,4.018018018018018
8481678,1,B005OPZO5M,"Do not buy this item.  These are unauthorized bio's that are made like cheap tv tell-alls that give you nothing.  Hopefully one day Blink will get the doc treatment like Foo Fighters or Pearl Jam has in the past few years, but this is not the doc you are looking for.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS",1323993600,8,287,4.181818181818182
8481679,1,B005OPZO5M,"This box set was terrible.  It included two DVDs, Punk Poets and Up Close and Personal.  Punk Poets was decent.  It had a few interviews with people that knew Blink before they became famous.  Up Close and Personal was the worst documentary I've ever seen.  On the cover of the DVD is Blink and what they look like now.  On the DVD, the most recent footage of them is from the late 90's during Dude Ranch, and they keep playing the same footage over and over again.  They also interview a random porn star that was in a movie with Janine, who was the woman on the cover of Enema of the State.  She says she likes Blink once and then flashes the camera the rest of the time. Also the ""host"" of the DVD is unprofessional, and you can tell he knows nothing about Blink.  He calls their hit song, ""What's My Age"".  I would not recommend this to anyone.  I would recommend buying punk poets separately or watching it on Amazon Instant Video.  It was defiantly not worth 20 dollars.",1323129600,14,976,4.302197802197802
