612441,5,6303257445,Arrived on time for Christmas. Packaged nicely and is a great collection of cartoons for kids and adults. I recommend for all Ghostbuster fans.,1326067200,2,143,5.0
612442,3,6303257445,"I have the first three volumes and volume three I got a few months ago. Due to time restraints I have just started watching it. I made it to disc four last night and after three attempts of putting in the DVD player and taking it out I have not been able to watch it. The DVD player is saying it is a ""bad disc."" I will be trying to get ahold of someone from AMAZON.com to try and get a replacement disc. This is the first time in all my orders through Amazon that I have had something wrong. Other than that I would defenitely reccomend getting it. It has been great watching all the episodes. Just wish I could watch disc four which I was hoping to watch since it has to return of Samhain and Boogeyman!",1304640000,,705,4.079136690647482
612443,5,6303257445,Since I was a child I have always loved The Ghostbusters film and seeing The Real Ghostbusters Television show took my love of it even further. To me the show laid out the ground work for a childhood dream becoming a Ghostbuster. Unfortunately the occupation does not exsist. Being a child in the 80's is one of my most cherished memories and Television shows at that time were among the best so to me this product is a virtual time machine. Overall the product itself is impressive in terms of package design and quality and the special featurette's included are the icing on the cake. To any Ghostbusters fans out there this DVD is truly a must for your collection.,1292284800,,667,4.566666666666666
612444,5,6303257445,"Oh the Memories! Loved the show as a child and not much has changed! The show has some of the best writers I the Business including pre Babylon 5 creator  J. Michael Straczynski! This season includes the return or both the Bogeyman and Samhain! I also love the episode where the Ghostbusters are brought to an alternate reality version of New York called Boo York and have to face off against the People busters (Basically ghost like version of themselves).

An excellent set for anyone who loved the show as a child. My only complaint is the fact that the box mentions that the episodes are digitally remastered which in my opinion is clearly false. There is tons of artifacts and color loss within the episodes; however this doesn't change the fact that it's an awesome show and highly recommended!",1289952000,,800,4.707142857142857
612445,4,6303257445,"As we get into volume 3 we do still have some very good episodes, but a lot of these episodes were largely forgettable. This set includes the first episode of the transition to ""Slimer! and the Real Ghostbusters,"" however, ""Flip Side"" -- one of the best episodes of the whole series. I applaud Time Life for releasing the series in volume sets so that those of us who want to purchase them individually can do so.",1289433600,,413,4.447368421052632
612446,5,6303257445,"Aw, nice to see some episodes in volume three.  It has some fun ones.  Especially when they bring in the terror dogs.  Good times.",1283731200,,130,4.333333333333333
612447,5,6303257445,"After waiting patiently, Time Life has finally been putting out the single volume releases of The Real Ghostbusters cartoons. And I must say, It's about time. On to the review...

There are 5 discs to volume 3 for a total of 31 episodes. The series picks up the rest of the Syndicated season and continues through the 2nd and 3rd original seasons. There are 15 on-camera introductions from the episode writers which are very short, but done well given that each episode are their own. Each episode is exactly like it was when it was aired, each with the logo talking, ""The Real Ghostbusters will return after these messages."" I'm very happy Time Life kept that in...

The overall picture quality is very good and to be expected of a 20 year old cartoon. It says on the back of the box that they are remastered, and I don't think they could look any better than they are presented in this collection unless Time Life decides to put them on Blu-Ray. I honestly think that won't happen. You never know though...

The sound quality is also very good. It is presented in Dobly Digital 2.0 if I'm not mistaken. Each episode has its distinct feel of eeriness, and that's one of the reasons why this show still holds up today. Within season 3, (at least I think it is season 3), the voice of Peter Venkman changes from The Great Lorenzo Music,(the voice of Garfield), to Dave Coulier, (Joey from Full House). It is a noticeable change for those who preferred Lorenzo better. That is not to say the show isn't good without him. I myself still prefer Lorenzo over Dave. To each his own though...

As for special features, there is an image gallery for the characters, an image gallery for their equipment, 5 isolated music and effects tracks for specific episodes, 5 on-camera Visual Commentary tracks with the writes and artists for specified episodes, and a special episode long documentary entitled, ""Who You Gonna Call? The Heroes of The Real Ghosbusters."" A very good supplemental package.

In closing, this is a very good dvd set of a very good show. If you were hesitant to pick up the Time Life Set of all volumes, (like I was), you will find that these individual sets are cheaper in the long run. You may have to wait a bit longer for the last 2 volumes, but I find it is well worth waiting for. Hope this review helped out.",1282089600,13,2324,4.536992840095466
612448,2,6303257445,"Owning this video myself, I want to say that this is an excellent title, but then I'd only be saying that to make myself feel better. While it's not the worst cartoon I've ever seen, it is the worst episode in my opinion. Of course, this could just be that I don't like the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" song. I like valkyries, just not the song. Anyway, rent it if you can before considering purchase.",1003276800,,396,4.293333333333333

612526,5,6303257445,"I grew up watching The Real Ghostbusters when it aired on Saturday Mornings (yep, network television actually aired cartoons in the mornings back then). I could never afford the expensive complete series, so I have waited for the volumes to be released. The episodes in volume 3 is when the producers changed some of the voice cast and focused the episodes to be more kid friendly.

612527,3,6303257445,"For whatever reason, a lot of adults watch cartoons that are aimed at children. I think part of the reason is that sometimes cartoons are only nominally aimed at kids. That was certainly the case when The Real Ghostbusters started. It was more or less, a continuation of the movies, albeit with the characters changed a little. Peter Venkmen was more of a slacker than an out and out lech, though he still was drawn to any female on the show, while Ray had more of a childlike quality than in the movie. Egon didn't have all that much of a personality in the movie, being played rather drily by Harold Ramis, but comes out of his shell on the show. And Winston, though played very well by Ernie Hudson in the movie, didn't have much of a role - here in the show, his character really did become a true, full fledged Ghostbuster.

Unfortunately, not everything can last. They made a lot of these shows, going into syndication almost immediately and the quality suffered towards the tail end (which are the shows here). Sure, they are funny, but not as clever as the ones earlier on.

But worst, at the start of Season 3, there was a shift in the show - apparently the TV execs didn't think it was aimed at children enough, so they revamped the style somewhat. Unfortunately, this resulted in a very dull show. They also made some changes with the voice actors - Lorenzo Music, famous for being the voice of Garfield, was replaced because Bill Murray thought he sounded too much like Garfield, and not him (only to voice Garfield himself later).  His replacement was Dave Coolier, who tries to impersonate Bill Murray but comes off just as a buffoon. Jeanine was also replaced, then finally Aresenio Hall was replaced by Buster Jones, who did an okay job, but by then, the magic had left the show entirely. It would last a couple more seasons, including a try at a longer format with Slimer as the main character, but the show is basically no longer worth watching halfway into this set.",1339545600,22,1985,4.539106145251397

7842176,5,6303257445,"I enjoyed the first Ghost Buster movie, so when the cartoon version came on, I started watching it. I was disappointed when the cartoon went off the air. I have all 3 seasons of the Ghost Busters on DVD. They are much more family/kid friendly than many of the cartoons on both network and cable today. Some of the cartoons might be a bit frightening for a child under 7 or 8, so I would recommend watching as a family. My kids and grand kids all like the Ghost Busters and Real Ghost Busters.",1445212800,,492,4.24468085106383
