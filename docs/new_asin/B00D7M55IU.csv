8615096,1,B00D7M55IU,This video was disappointing as it shows three very similar family situations where mobility does not seem to be an issue and really does not help in conveying the reality during an attack or flare. I found it to give a very rose colored view of a disease that can be very debilitating and not useful in assisting children come to terms with it.  A younger child would see this and wonder why mommy or daddy isn't taking family walks or being active because all of the parents in the video are able to do so.  A better approach would have been to also show a family where symptoms are more visibly present.,1493078400,,606,4.353982300884955
