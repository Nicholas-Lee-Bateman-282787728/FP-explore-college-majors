8523543,1,B008049SCO,"DO NOT BUY THIS.  Aside from the fact that the video quality is horrible, and shot on consumer 8mm film camera in the early 70's, late 60's, the seller is a scammer!  Product consists of 4 DVD-Rs, with 4 typos on the printed labels.  The first typo is a misspelling of the title: ""Hiistoric ..."".  Whoever printed the labels, English is not their native language, despite the packaging saying that the distribution company is from New York City.  DVD1 and DVD4 are exactly the same, even though the labels are different.

Further evidence the seller is a scammer:  They did not allow an email to be sent where I could rate the transaction.  So they KNOW the product is bogus.

I reported this to Amazon and got a refund, but why is Amazon still allowing this product to be sold!?

This seller needs to be arrested and thrown in jail.  FBI take notice.",1368144000,14,851,4.496732026143791
