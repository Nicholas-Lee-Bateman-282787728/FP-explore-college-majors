348470,4,6301720385,this Movie for it's time frame was Ground-Breaking.in 1971 to be doing a Movie with a Black Actor&White Female Lead was Big.well sorry to say it still is in 2001. James Earl Jones was Good as Jack Johnson.but I'd dig a New up-dated take on it.anyway The Soundtrack was a Knock-Out. Miles Davis&His Band went the full 15 Rounds.this Film has a Cool Pace&isn't like many other films for that Reason alone. It's History seldom mentioned.,1000080000,9,434,4.723684210526316

348542,5,6301720385,"This is a great film with James Earl Jones' great acting along with Martin Ritt directorial controll.

But if you expect something like ROCKY, this is not it.
It's more like raw movie with few New Orleans Jazz music in it.

This is a true story about Jack Jefferson an Afro-American boxer who live in early 20th century who bacame a first black heavyweigh champion.
He lived a freestyle life with White woman girl friend and rather a strange style life.
Since he lived with a White girl both White people are Afro-Americans hated him.
Even in the ring, peole despised him all the time.
Even the people from the boxing wanted to bury him and eventually they did. To make him fight again, the suggests him to loose the game.

He finally has this match with a guy. Now that fight was memorable and won't get out of my mind for awhile.
James tries to loose the game easily but then again his fighting instinc came back and he fought the guy back.
but then again, he has to live. He loose the game at the end.
I don't know he regain the title after this game since the movie ended that way but I would say the acting of James Earl Jones and the actress Jane Alexander were really great.
They both end with having a lot of award from different festivals.
Jane Alexander is a classic looking actress who knows how to express her anger, shows her inner beauty and abstain from showing everyghing at the same time. She is let's say one in a million actress.
To gather both, this movie becomes a marvelous creature somthing that you shouldn't miss.

To be add,..
The festival scenes were great, the festivity of Afro-Americans are hillarious to watch too.
The way how White people almost flatter to James because he is a moneymaker boxer is quite rediculous.
He was a majestic free man who lived in early 20th century.

348601,3,6301720385,"The Great White Hope, 1970 film

The title referred to any white boxer who could defeat Jack Jefferson and demonstrate white racial superiority. A group of men want a former heavyweight boxing champion to return from retirement and defeat Jefferson. Jack is warned about his white girlfriend. Reporters visit for an interview. Another woman returns to cause trouble. The reporters agree to hold back this news. There is a parade in Reno. Brady shows his gold championship belt, he will do his best. Jefferson appears, he smiles. Whites are angered, the colored want a champion. [Unhappy are those who want a champion.] There is a celebration. One man objects. Lively times. There is an objection to Miss Eleanor Bachman. The District Attorney calls her in for an informal inquiry about her past. [They are looking for a crime.] She doesnt fall for it.

Jefferson goes for a drive in the country with his girl. But they crossed a state line! [Was this a set-up?] Federal marshals invade their cabin to arrest Jack. [The Mann Act was supposed to ban the transport of prostitutes across state lines, but it also applied to lovers. Some of the language is censored for broadcast TV, which shows the changes since 1970.] Jefferson chooses to avoid prison. He has friends who play baseball and will play ball with him. Singing helps. Jefferson fled to Canada, then London. But they refuse to allow him to fight in London. Its different in France. In the USA there is a migration of colored folk from the South to the North, their admiration of Jefferson is a problem. In Europe there are few fights now.

Jefferson appears in a play in Hungary, Uncle Toms Cabin. Jack gets bad news from home, his Mom is very sick. There are threats of war in Europe. Jack goes to Mexico. Is this better? As the years pass Jefferson ages. Do what they want you to do she says. There is conflict. [Hard times affect people.] A government man arrives to make a deal for a fight in Havana. There is more bad news about Miss Bachman. Jack will take the fight now. It is held outdoors. Will it end soon? Will there be a surprise? The crowd cheers when a man is knocked down. The winner gets a gold belt, the loser walks away. Will there be a happy ending for all?

This movie is based on the life of Jack Johnson, who broke records in the early 20th century. Was there similar racial feelings in the Patterson-Johansen fight in 1958? Was there anything strange in these matches? The overwhelming favorite lost in both matches.",1415923200,,2498,4.632054176072235

It is great cinema and James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander, reprising their roles from the stageplay, deliver tour de force, Oscar-worthy performances. This was Jones' break out movie role and the movie debut for Alexander. Jones' characterization of Jack Jefferson is consistent with the historical cocky, flamboyant, Jack Johnson, who spurned the Jim Crow boundaries of his era by driving fast cars, wearing expensive clothing and consorting with fast women, including numerous affairs w/white women. He married three white women...Jane Alexander's Eleanor Bachman is probably meant to be a composite; but is more consistent with Etta Terry Duryea, a Brooklyn socialite and former wife of businessman Charles Duryea, than with the other two. Their romantic involvement and marriage was very turbulent; and she did commit suicide by shooting herself with a revolver, not by jumping into a well. While this movie is an excellent fictional dramatization and highly recommended, if you want the real story, watch Jim Burns' ""Unforgivable Blackness"".

348711,4,6301720385,"I remember when my father took me and my siblings to see this; It was when it first came out and I won't lie to you, most of that stuff went right over me, but I can tell that there was something serious to this, and later, they explained to me about Jack Johnson and who he was. As I got older, I realized that this man was a force to be reckoned with in the early 1900s. he was the darling to African Americans in the early 1900s and 1910s and in spite of restrictions, he lived and did as he pleased yet paid a high price for his troubles. In this film, James Earl Jones plays Jack Jefferson who fights his white contender amongst a lot of boos; His manager goes to get him a good purse and gets robbed just because he's black. He loves a white woman, who can't understand why they can't be fully happy and is harassed at all turns. When things get too hot, he leaves the US and goes overseas, doing things he don't care for and trying to keep some respectability with himself. In time, he hates his woman and she goes and kills herself. By now, the US is on him to fight another fight, and him sad about his lady love, and tired of wandering and running, agrees to it, and he loses the fight. James Earl Jones did a brilliant job in this film as well as Jane Alexander(both did it on Broadway) and makes for a great classic.",1280188800,,1328,4.091954022988506
348712,5,6301720385,"I have seen this film on TV over the years, and always thought it was a well done film, especially in light of the fact it was released when Muhammad Ali was protesting being arrested for refusing to be drafted into the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War. Ironically, it was on this very day (as I type this) that Ali famously refused to be inducted into the U.S. Armed Services in Houston, Texas back in 1967.

Anyway, back to the subject: the film starring James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander. Both play their parts with conviction and humanity, making you feel for both of them as you know that early 20th Century American society will make it impossible for them to be happy together, with Jim Crow in force throughout the U.S.  Amazing to think that Jones in a few years would become the voice of Darth Vader (actually, I take that back-- his voice is perfect for Vader!!)

An enjoyable movie.",1272412800,,896,4.484662576687117

348714,5,6301720385,"As an 18-yr old, I vividly remember when this movie came out and the swirling controversies that accompanied it. Whites were cautious because it openly dealt with not only an interracial love affair but because of the depiction of an unrelenting, proud, and VERY angry black man. Interestingly enough, with the advent of Black Power/the Revolution and the emergence of the Black Panthers, most black audiences were equally cautious as well and for exactly the same reasons. Also keep in mind I was living in the South then too. Even in 1970, few southern towns would actually show the film.

This is a variation on the real-life troubles of Jack Johnson, one of boxing's earliest contenders.

Hands down the most compelling performances are those of James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander that leave an indelible imprint on the viewer. Because of the racial fabric of the time, Jack knew he was asking for trouble by openly defying white authority and then compounding that by becoming involved with a white woman. Both undoubtedly knew full well what they would be up against. While they may have deeply loved each other in the beginning, they soon discovered that simply love does not conquer all.

The movie is also filled with treasures of African-American performances by the likes of Beah Richards, Moses Gunn, Roy Glenn Sr. and Virginia Capers. This alone is worth the price of admission.

In many instances it is most difficult to watch. Two mesmerizing and thoroughly wrenching scenes were Jane's suicide and when Jack and company were reduced to performing ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" in Europe to survive.

The film is most certainly uncompromising which was a MAJOR achievement given the social fabric at the time. James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander both deserved Oscars for their performances but that would have been like condoning their whole situation and god KNOWS Hollywood would NEVER have done that.....(sigh) Another example of not being able to see the forest for the trees.

Nonetheless, this is an eeeeeeeeeexcellent film and most worthy of your movie collection",1213574400,5,2076,5.037900874635569

348716,5,6301720385,"You don't have to be a fan of boxing to enjoy this movie.  THE GREAT WHITE HOPE is the story of Jack Johnson, the famed illustrious 'Negro' boxer.  Fortunately, James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander reprieve the role they played in the successful Broadway play (1968), each giving a powerful performance.  It was said that Mohamed Ali saw the play and later modeled his boxing 'personality' after the famed Jack Johnson.

I've read many biographies of the late Jack Johnson, and I think that the movie does not follow true to the actually events in Johnson's life.  Still, the movie is gripping, thanks to James Earl Jones' intense electrifying portrayal of Jack Johnson.  I highly recommend this movie.",1208131200,3,701,4.898305084745763
348717,5,6301720385,"I saw this film in the theater while in High School and was blown away. Loosely based on the life of Jack Johnson like so many other so called ""film biographies"". The 1968-69 Pulitzer Prize winning play by Howard Sackler, brought to film in 1970, with James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander repeating their Broadway roles. Just a taste of what the real Jack Johnson was up against during the turn-of-the century. Arrogant black man not afraid to say anything he pleased while winning the heavyweight boxing title, and freely flaunting his love for white women when lynchings were the rule for ""uppity n*****s"". A very unfortunate part of America's legacy.

A real gutsy, meaty, in-your-face role for Mr. Jones that brought him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. And his love interest, beautifully portrayed by Ms. Alexander was also rewarded an Oscar nomination for Best Actress as well. A powerful drama, with a rarely seen strong romantic coupling of a black man and a white woman. Another Martin Ritt directed masterpiece. Another film that took forever to release on DVD.",1183939200,,1081,4.93956043956044
348718,3,6301720385,"Neither this movie, nor the play it was created from were

directly based on true events.  The work is loosely based on

events in the life of boxer Jack Johnson.  But major portions

of the story diverge greatly from the story of the real man.

Thats not a bad thing in that movie tells a compelling story

by changing the facts, but the side-effect is that it distorts

the history of the real man.

The film gives a really distorted picture of the life of a boxer

in that era.  The typical boxer was a drunk surrounded by

hangers-on, prostitutes and women attracted by money and

celebrity.  It wasn't really any sort of world of romance and

deep love as shown in the film.  It was about greed, violence

and the ""rewards"" (the women) of being a champion.

Where the movie misses the point totally is in not understanding

that root problem wasn't just racism, but a business and media

culture who were totally willing to use racism and racial

conflict as a way to sell tickets and newspapers.  Jack Johnson

(and the search for the great white hope) was a godsend for

the boxing establishment.  By combining racial conflict

with sports, interest in boxing and newspaper coverage of

boxing went way up.  It was never how he was openly living

that was the problem (even in 1910), it was the decision of

the newspapers to focus in on how he was living.

Also, despite all the outrage and the ill-treatment of Jack

Johnson, he kept both the title and his freedom until age

(not racism) caught up with him.  The film spreads the old

lie that the fight in Cuba was thrown.  It was not.  He lost

because he was old and his lifestyle (like all boxers of that

era) had caught up to him.

The acting in the film is first-rate, but the story doesn't

hold up.  Its a 1960's era political film that makes valid

points about racism and hypocracy of that time.  But these

days, the issues at hand are atheletes who are either made

into saints or devils at the whim of a few reporters.

All to sell papers or get viewers.  While the reality of these

mens lives isn't reported at all.",1106524800,29,2091,4.404761904761905
