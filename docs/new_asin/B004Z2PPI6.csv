4505609,1,B004Z2PPI6,"This movie will bore any horror fan. It doesn't have gore. It doesn't have any suspense or edge of your seat thrill either. It's about a group of young people who have to stay in an abandoned prison and deal with their fears. It's too predictable to be scary. Just watching the trailer is the most fear your going to receive out of this movie. If you didn't get any scares from the trailer then you won't get any scares from this movie.

I'm sure some people are still going to wanna watch this movie despite all the negative reviews. My advice is to not buy this movie. Rent it, if you really want to see it. But a full-priced purchase is a waste of money.",1318809600,,657,4.214285714285714
4505610,4,B004Z2PPI6,"This is a pretty good movie. you can tell, they really tried hard with this movie, to make it as good and surprising as possible, and i think that they pulled it off. When you think that something is for sure in this movie, it turns out not to be! And They left you hanging at the end! The acting, at times, could be a bit bland, but overall, a pretty good movie.",1313280000,,363,3.9863013698630136
4505611,2,B004Z2PPI6,"Imagine a TV reality show that kidnaps their contestants, doesn't get them to sign any kind of waivers, dumps them into an abandoned prison, and only offers a shared $20,000 prize!  That's what you get in THE TASK, the latest entry in the sinking After Dark originals.  After a promising series of films earlier this year, ADO has dropped two bombs on us--SCREAM OF THE BANSHEE and the marginally better THE TASK.
Aside from the incredulity of the plot, the movie suffers from pandering filler, really bad lighting and every clich in the cinematic book.  This premise has been done several times recently, with no memorable films to warrant its continuance.  Even worse, you know from the beginning where the movie is going and a preposterous ""twist"" ending is inevitable.  THE TASK's ending is dismally bad.
The actors are trapped in Horror 101 caricatures, with no real standouts.
I had high hopes that ADO's would set new standards in modern horror, but if THE TASK is a preview of what's to come, this is one viewer who might jump ship!",1312070400,3,1040,4.7555555555555555
4505612,2,B004Z2PPI6,"Whether you know it or not, you've seen The Task before.  Granted it was in the form of plenty of other unoriginal slashers, but you've seen it before, and seen it done way better as well.  A group of college kids all get to participate in a reality game show that takes place in a huge, creepy, run-down prison; with each having to accomplish various tasks that correalate with their own worst fears...or something.  Such things as story, plot, character development, and any sort of logic are all tossed out the window.  None of this would be that bad were it not for the fact that the first hour or so of The Task is so slow and boring and it takes forever to get anything going.  Still, once it gets going, it provides some decent shocks and offers a nice enough denouement, but other than that, there isn't anything else about The Task to recommend in the least.",1311811200,3,867,4.427672955974843
4505613,3,B004Z2PPI6,"I just watched The Task and was very disappointed.
It had elements of several other horror films but none of it added up to a good movie.

First you have the Rip Off of the reality show with the people in the RV ala Wrong Turn 2 and even have the last guy standing from that film 'Texas Battle' in the cast.

I can't mention the other films that it ripped off or it will give away too much of the movie.
There was very little gore,the storyline was obviously lacking and it was very slow paced.

it even ripped off the old MTV show Room Raiders.
The atmosphere in the abandoned prison was creepy I will give it that and the use of camera was not bad but the entire effort was a fail as far as I'm concerned. The fat guy in the RV where all the producers and technicians were working made me cringe he was so annoying ,I was hoping he would  go outside and smoke or something and get offed.

Bottom line,This year,so far watch Seconds Apart,Husk and even Prowl.but I say skip this unless you have money to throw away and there is nothing else to watch.",1311638400,2,1051,4.157635467980295
4505614,4,B004Z2PPI6,"The movie starts out with a young male, Dixon, (Texas Battle) strolling down the street and then he becomes abducted. He is one of several people who have been abducted and forced to wear pig head mask. As it turns out, all those who were abducted (interesting that they could get them all in one afternoon) have tried out for a reality TV show. The characters are all introduced by playing a portion of their interview tape. They will split $20,000 if they spend the night in abandoned Benneville Prison with tasks and scares provided by the producers...and oh yes- 20 homeless people have died there recently.

The cast are hand cuffed, like a chain gang, girl, boy, girl, boy, girl, boy with the black man at the end. There is an Indian(subcontinent)girl (Amara Karan) who is super intelligent and a blond (Ashley Mulheron as Shoe)who isn't. Antonia Campbell-Hughes is delightful as Angel who is a contestant who enjoys frightening the other contestants.

The story goes that the warden, in order to cut costs killed 85 inmates and then later was sentenced to death himself. His soul roams the prison. Or that is at least the story they were told...

Contestants randomly select a chess piece to represent them. Tasks are assigned by a prerecorded tape based on the chess piece...first up the white queen. While the tasks seemed to be at random, they are actually based on the interviews where the contestants disclosed their biggest fear.

As it turns out there are things in the prison the producers didn't count on...and the producers think it is just their network playing a game with them.

Good acting for a B movie. The soundtrack is not overpowering, but it is effective with drum rhythms inconspicuously mimicking heart beats. The horror is mostly pyschological and not blood and guts. Yes, we've seen this type of movie before, and I don't mind watching them again when they are done right.

F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1311465600,5,1930,4.798192771084337

8449405,3,B004Z2PPI6,"What can I say? Well, I'm glad I didn't buy it, that's for sure. It was a fun story, made you feel like you were one of the characters, made you feel like you were in it.. But what got to me, what I didn't like was that the base that the storyline stood on, felt too much like Smiley, Cry Wolf, and April Fool's Day (the 1986 version) which in my opinion are amazing movies and I highly recommend you (whoever is reading this) to watch those 3 movies before watching this.

I gave this movie a 3 star rating based on the setting and the kills.",1436659200,,543,4.027777777777778
8449406,3,B004Z2PPI6,"The Task is a really average horror movie.  Not only does it contain a concept that's been done a million times already, it fails to deliver for the entire first half in the most important area- being scary!  I think the movie got off on the wrong foot.  We first see a group of teenagers being kidnapped, thrown into a van and taken away.  We're led to think that the people responsible for kidnapping these kids are going to be ruthless thrilling bad guys without mercy, however when everyone arrives to their location the ""kidnappers"" take their masks off and reveal they're part of a reality show TV crew where teens have to stay in an abandoned prison.  That was a VERY disappointing turn of events, but it gets worse.

For the next 40 minutes, we're not seeing anything resembling true horror taking place.  It's some of the tamest horror imaginable.  I wouldn't even say it's written for teens- more like kids.  It's *that* mild.  It turns out, predictably, that the reality TV crew are staying in hidden camera rooms orchestrating/watching the entire way these teens are supposed to spend their time in this dark dreadful prison.  Of course, you can probably guess- there's a real murderer on the loose that neither the teens or the TV crew are aware of, and he pops up on camera to make a surprise appearance every so often.

There's barely any horror while this murderer is walking around either.  We see the murderer- he's big, bald and bulky but besides that, he's hardly what I'd call intimidating.  He has several opportunities to kill teens but for some bizarre reason he hardly uses them.  Instead he's more concerned making sneak appearances before quickly shying away from the overhead camera.  This means we don't see much in the way of violence for the most part- the occasional stabbings, one teen being placed in a sticky fly-buzzing situation (hehe), other teens playing up to the reality TV role by revealing their biggest fears and having to face them (such as one vegetarian having to eat meat, another being trapped in a secluded area, and another receiving ass while being placed in an electric chair).  It feels awkward how the teens reveal their biggest fears by way of an interview as the story rolls along too.

Everything about the killer seemed off to me.  He should have played a bigger, more violent role.  The twist at the end which I don't reveal isn't really a twist because we all saw it coming a mile away (and we all noticed the second twist as well- like I said I won't spoil it so let's just say you can't have one twist without the other).  Taking forever to get going in the first half and doing a lousy job building memorable characters is one problem, but failing to deliver in the second half while avoiding creativity in the murders and violence with clichd writing just really hurts this one.  Only the one redheaded female teen was memorable because she was feisty and determined to run out of the building once it became apparent what was going on- the rest of the characters were forgettable.  Skip.",1425168000,,3053,4.654850746268656

Creepy but won't keep you up at night.  Entertaining.

Not fabulous but I don't regret the time I spent watching it either.",1382745600,,161,4.482758620689655
8449409,4,B004Z2PPI6,This movie is people get kidnapped on the street and placed on a game show where they must spend a night in an abandoned prison for a cash prize. Of course they rigged the jail with effects and there is a story going around that a sadistic warden haunts it. I really enjoyed this film with a few tense moments. The ending just ruined it for me. I have no idea what the hell they were trying to do with an ending like that but it sucked. Worth a watch but be prepared to say what the hell at the end because I don't understand it either.,1381363200,,536,4.018691588785047
8449410,3,B004Z2PPI6,"From the companies that brough you Horrorfest, comes the Task, a unique story with a twist. I really liked how ambitious the Task was and just what lengths it went to in order to try and trick the audience. It's unusal to find good writing or much of anything that isn't predictable in a film like this, and I really didn't expect it to be as entertaining as it was. This unique story begins with seven people being kidnapped and brought to a remote location to compete in a reality TV show, that combines Survivor, Fear Factor, and Ghost Hunters. The game requires the contests to spend one night locked in an abandon prison, with a seedy reputation. The contests must complete the tasks that are put in front of them to win a large cash award. The contests were as different as can be leading to a fantastic dynamic between them, it's a shame they didn't build on that dynamic and show more interaction between characters, that only would have added to the story. The cast, as usual, is mostly newcomers, but talented newcomers, who do an excellent job in making this story believable. A movie like the Task really comes down to the cast, because if they're not believable the movie ends up being only good for a few laughs. The cast was good, the plot was great, but what really put the film over the top was it's terrific ending, which was very reminiscent of another Lionsgate classic, Saw. It's an ending you shouldn't see coming, but one that really brings the whole thing together.",1368230400,3,1489,4.559701492537314

8449412,5,B004Z2PPI6,"I've been watching ""Gore"" & ""Psych"" Horror/Thrillers since the age of 8y.o., I'm now 45. It's quite possible that I've become biased and/or soft,forgiving,generous..But I REALLY liked this movie, much more so than After Dark's ""Prowl""(albeit Prowl was good all the way up to the point in which I tried to swallow the whole""killer bird/human"" bit towards the end ~ mean, REALLY?) I ABSOLUTELY LOVED the end of The Task,the music even felt instinctually threatening&terrifying in itself. Then to see that there really WAS an actual spirit of the evil Warden&his group of cannibalistic(forgive my horrible spelling!)""victims""..My anxiety level ran high thru out this movie,from the 1st contestants ""task"" in which he had to go into the chapel&after saying the Lord's Prayer backwards must sit in complete darkness(whether he wants to or not,as even his own flashlight gets shut off!))to the very last ""task"".To be honest I own Prowl, Husk,Fertile Ground&The Task, the one I watch the MOST is The Task.. I think it ROCKED!",1363132800,,1018,5.175757575757576
