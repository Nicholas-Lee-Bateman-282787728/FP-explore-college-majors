2380479,5,B000A9QKT6,What I read about in an artical but I forgot where I read it from. But if fox went on with Point Pleasant for a 2nd seasson the seasson would so Christina evil side and in her glory. Well that to bad because the people at fox are fools. Maybe they might be hope that USA network or Sci-fi channel could pick it up if the dvd sales do good. Remember what happen to family guy let just hope that Point Pleasant get that same support.,1122940800,6,431,4.023255813953488
2380480,4,B000A9QKT6,"First of all, Elisabeth Harnois, the lead, is just a vision. Not only that, she's a good actress.

  This series has several story lines working at once, and she's not always onscreen. Each one hooks you in. What's going to happen next??!! I am 37, and I appreciate the adults having their own twisted storylines weaving in and out. You don't always get that on some series aimed at a younger audience.

 I've seen the bootleg, and the series just builds and builds.

 I'd say my favorite episode is ""the dance"".",1122595200,11,512,4.56043956043956
2380481,5,B000A9QKT6,"""Point Pleasant"" was just another one of the wonderful, original shows FOX is known for--known for introducing and then barely giving a chance before cancellation, i.e. ""Wonderfalls"", ""Firefly"", ""John Doe"", ""Tru Calling"". This show got better and better with each episode and had me hooked, even though there weren't nearly enough episodes. Unfortunately, FOX decided to cancel it before we could see the 'scariest episode yet' that was advertised. What a shame. I was hoping that it would be released on DVD so that I could watch the episodes over again and see the ones that were never aired for the first time. This show was clever and inventive. It had mystery, horror, interesting relationships and great chemistry between the main teenage characters. Grant Show also did a wonderful job of playing the show's villian. I hope this show does well on DVD. I'm definitely looking forward to the release of this DVD set.",1122163200,99,921,4.987012987012987
2380482,5,B000A9QKT6,"I thought the show was great, Marti Noxon (of buffy fame)it was amixture of drama horror and at times tender and evil, agreat way to spend a thursday night.

2380520,4,B000A9QKT6,"I really liked this show and wish it had continued, I hate to be left hanging the way that it ended so that's why I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars.",1370131200,,149,3.6875
2380521,4,B000A9QKT6,Point Pleasant is a very good series no matter what other reviwers have said about the series.  I wondered why I enjoyed the theme song so much come to find out it is done by Tim Burton's composer Danny Elfman.  Bascially storyline is good vs evil as the characters develop over the episodes.  As the series progress little by little Christina's powers become more known for the bad in her but people see the good in her also.  It also has some good actors staring in it I reconize the main bad guy from Melrose Place from Fox.  The storyline progress and people have to choice which sides they are on either good or bad then people start to disappear and head to the church.  Jesse and Christina get closer and Jesse senses bad things about Christina and what shall happen to the town they live in if he doesn't do something about it but someone warns him thou shall not kill but does he listen... you have to buy the series to see for yourself.  Overall I liked all of it just had a few dragging moments in some of the scenes but overall I give it a 4 star rating because it keep my intrest from first to 13 episode.  So if your looking for a mixture of drama science fiction so forth then pick this show up and enjoy some good drama science fiction and action sprikle here and there.,1359244800,,1286,4.2633744855967075
2380522,2,B000A9QKT6,"I remembered watching this show as a kid and  enjoying it so I thought i would buy the series and see the whole thing. The series started off really interesting, and then continues to go down hill from there and was cancelled after 1 season. Don't bother.",1356825600,,255,4.425531914893617
2380543,5,B000A9QKT6,I loved this show and it's a shame there's only one season of it. I would have loved to see many more seasons. Still worth the money for the one season since it's really enjoyable.,1349049600,,180,4.171428571428572
2380544,1,B000A9QKT6,"I've struggled, suffered and made it through a lot of bad TV in my time, but this show, this show is the first show I've ever found completely unwatchable.  I only made it through episode 4 before I couldn't stand it anymore.  As noted by others, horrible, horrible writing.  Boring.  Confusing.  Convoluted.  With virutally NO decent drama or action or romance or anything remotely entertaining.  THE WRITING IS SO BAD.  Bad casting.  Bad acting.  Horrible editing.  Even the music from Danny Elfman is bad.  So I suggest avoiding this disaster at all costs!  Total waste of money and time.",1338681600,,591,4.848484848484849
2380545,3,B000A9QKT6,"This show had an interesting premise, but the description made it sound better than it was. The show was sort of slow in developing, and you had to work to keep your attention on it. Add in the fact that it was cancelled right when it finally started getting really good, and I can't say I'd recommend sending your money on this one. It left me feeling unsatisfied, and wishing I'd spent the money on something else instead.",1306195200,,424,4.448717948717949
2380546,4,B000A9QKT6,*Contains spoilers. Just finished watching Point Pleasant + I was really surprised at how good it was. From the moment Christina is pulled out of the ocean Point Pleasant begins to be well less pleasant. Her prescence begins to magnify everyone's emotions. Including that of Jesse(her rescuer) who seems to be extremely drawn to her and the Kramer's who take her in. As she begins to realize who she is and what she can do things begin to unravel. Her struggle to overcome her dark side comes w/ a price to those around her. And as things don't pan out for Christina she uses her dark abilities more and more. Jesse + Christina's realationship goes from hot to cold when he realizes he's the one that's supposed to stop her. Needless to say being on opposite sides of good + evil puts a strain on their relationship. For the Kramer's well things begin to implode as Christina goes dark side. I'll let you see for yourself how the show ends. But I have to tell you that it being cancelled does leave a very big cliffhanger w/ no resolution. That's the reason for the missing star which like most cancelled shows there is no follow through. Not even w/ the little commentary that there is you don't get anything extra than what you see. But then again it does leave room for you to fill in the blanks on your own if your good at that sort of thing. Give it a look see you won't be disappointed.,1300752000,,1392,4.39922480620155
2380547,5,B000A9QKT6,"This series is enjoyable from start to finish.  The acting is very good and the story is engrossing.  I highly recommend this to anyone who loved ""The Omen"" or shows of that ilk.",1273622400,,178,4.363636363636363
2380548,5,B000A9QKT6,"I liked the entire series; its sometimes uneven and over does the angst thing but its got decent acting (show is very good) and an interesting story.

The last episode has me wishing the entire series had that same spirit and humor. The dinner thing LOL! It also shows that harnois is a pretty good actor as well.

I recall seeing the ads for this when it came out and I ignored it (looked like an oc clone) and I regret that. Too bad it didn't have more episodes. At least it ends on a good note.",1263513600,,497,4.11340206185567
2380549,5,B000A9QKT6,"The story line was totally different, and ahead of its time when it was on. I never watched it until I found in on Chiller one weekend of old series. I was thrilled to be able to find the ending of the series. The reruns never showed them in sequence.

If you love dark comedy, paranormal shows, this is one to watch!",1255564800,,317,4.112903225806452
2380550,5,B000A9QKT6,"""Point Pleasant"", a series set in a small town on the coast of New Jersey.  It is about a community that is impacted by the arrival of a young girl.  From all appearances, both the town and the girl are normal.  But, don't look too closely.  The girl, Christina, turns out to be the ""daughter of darkness"" and the presence of evil brings out the worse in the community.

""Point Pleasant"" is called a supernatural soap opera but it is so much more.  Even though the story is often predictable, there is an element of surprise-often frightening at times. One reason I especially like the series is the thread of good vs. evil.  It is more than your typical battle-there is a reminder that there is light and darkness in everyone-in all of us. Circumstances and people impact others in this respect throughout the series.

Often, the difference between evil and good in the characters are not easily distinguishable.  One character, Lucas Boyd (brilliantly played by Grant Snow) is evil defined yet there are times that you start to feel sorry for him.

Every part of the story will keep your attention-it is compelling and suspenseful.

Unfortunately, the series lasted only one year.  Only 8 episodes of the 13 were aired and I was glad to see a conclusion to the story with the complete DVD set.  All the mysteries were explained and there is a finale.  Even so, It would have been interesting to see where the show would go if it continued.

""Point Pleasant"" is a great place to visit-but, be warned, it can be addicting, disturbing and decadent.  Another way to put it, it is like chocolate: you know it is probably bad for you but you can't resist.",1251676800,,1651,4.602739726027397
2380551,5,B000A9QKT6,"I don't watch much television.  I started to watch the series on the Chiller Cable Channel and liked it.  However, the cable network didn't show all the episodes so I ordered it from Amazon because it was relatively cheap and I wondered what happened in the series.  This would have made a GREAT movie.  A little too intense for a weekly series.  Your service was great.  I like ordering from Amazon.  I KNOW I will get the products in good shape and in a timely fashion.  Can't say that for Alibris.  I tried to talk my daughter into NOT getting her college textbooks from Alibris.  She had alot of problem ordering from them.  Will only use Amazon from now on.  Thanks for the great service!",1251158400,,693,4.456
2380552,5,B000A9QKT6,"This is by far as good as it gets for a Point Pleasant Fan. The quality and presentation is at 100%. You will love this DVD set. This is one of the best canceled TV shows, next to Dark Angel.  The new Fox show Dollhouse came close to never having a season two. This is a classic and the people at Fox know it. I highly recommend to buy while the price is low.",1249344000,,359,3.8513513513513513
2380573,5,B000A9QKT6,"First off, I want to say that I loved this show and was sick when it was canceled.
I watched all 13 episodes in the last 2 weekends. Each episode got better and better. However, I wish I would have read the reviews as I normally do. I had no idea that the ending was a cliffhanger.
Shame on Fox for pulling this crap on us again and again. There should have been a second season of Point Pleasant ~ or at least an ending to the series.
I'm still glad I purchased this, but upset that we'll never know how the story ends.",1249084800,,520,4.009615384615385
2380574,4,B000A9QKT6,I watched this during it's original run on Fox. I thought it wasn't extremly good show but it good acting and writing. Too bad Fox didn't give it a chance.,1246924800,,155,4.2
2380575,5,B000A9QKT6,"Too bad.  This little series had the makings of fascinating storytelling from writers and producers who have a history of great, unique work.  The characters and story idea worked from the beginning, and when viewing the episodes back to back as you can with a DVD set, it is enticing and addicting.  Would have loved to have seen where it went, but even the episodes here are enough to truly enjoy and well worth the watch. Too many ""outside the box"" programs like this die too quickly.  Makes me sad.  Leaves me wanting for more.  Try it if you like something that takes you somewhere new and lets your mind wander into uncommon places for a little while.",1238889600,,657,4.52542372881356
2380576,5,B000A9QKT6,"I really enjoyed the series.  I do not understand why it was cancelled.
The story line was great.  It was about a teenager who washed up on shore.
She discovered she had certain powers.  There was a reason for her to be
in Point Pleasant.  Whe was received well by a family.  When here secret
start to come up, things start to change.  Good story line.  I do not want
to give away the movie.  Must see.",1229904000,,402,4.12987012987013
2380577,5,B000A9QKT6,"Well, after some of the reviews I read I was hesitant to purchase this little gem.  I am SO glad I followed my instincts and got it.  I haven't been able to stop watching since I got it.  I can only guess the bad reviewers were not fans of Dallas and the like?  This show is a great blend of the nightime soaps and the supernatural genre.  I agree with the comparisons to Dark Shadows.  While this show is not perfect; I was hooked from the pilot.  I found the acting and story to be quite good and a creepy feeling of dread pervaded the show from the beginning....making for some nice chills up your spine.  Very rarely will a show start out being all it can be.  The only example I have EVER seen of a show being absolutely perfect from the first minute is Wonderfalls!  The main flaw I had with this show is that I don't think it could have gone for more than one season and remained the unique, interesting show it was.  The whole premise revolved around Christina finding out who she was and fighting her dark nature.  Will she fight for good or evil?  Once that decision is made, basically the show is over or if it continued you would have a killer of the week trying to off Chris for various reasons.  One person responded to a reviewer that Chris went ""evil"".  I totally disagree with that.  ***SPOILER ALERT***
Had she truly gone evil the whole town and the people would be dead, wiped off the map, period.  She let them live....they can still save her, deep down, she is good and wants to be good.  I can excuse her killing Jesse.....God he was WAY too goody goody anyway and totally betrayed her.  That MIGHT have worked better and the angst been able to build between them.  Anyway, this is a fun and entertaining show, you won't go wrong with it!!",1222300800,4,1761,4.310975609756097
2380578,5,B000A9QKT6,"I love this TV show. I watched it until it was canceled by the geniuses at Fox. It's been about three years since then and I had kinda forgotten about it, then I saw it on the list of DVDs you could use your Pepsi Points on and thought ""hey, why not?"" Best descision I've made this year, besides where I'm going to college (where definitely, not just considering it. That definitely tops buying the DVD).

2380603,5,B000A9QKT6,"I loved this series when it was on TV.  I could not believe that Fox network cancelled it so soon.  It was a great good vs. evil plot with good actors, too.  I had to buy this collection so I could see what happened in the last couple of episodes.

It begins with a pretty young girl (maybe in her 20s) found floating in the ocean.  She has no memory of who she is and a local family takes her in.  The family has a daughter about the same age so they become like sisters.  Things start to heat up rather quickly as a local boy gets interested in her while the boy's girlfriend gets jealous.  Slowly, the new girl begins to discover that she has some unusual abilities, especially when she gets mad. All kinds of little conflicts begin to develop and you begin to realize she is the daughter of Satan.  Grant Show (""Sex & the Single Mom"") is also great as a sort of emissary for Satan, sent to watch over his daughter.  There is a lot of conflict with the daughter because she is constantly resisting her ""powers"".  She does not want to be ""bad"" or hurt people.

Even though it only plays in one series, it ends well enough to satisfy you.  It also ends where they could continue the series if they really wanted to.  Unfortunately, you would probably not be able to continue with the original actors now because it's been several years.

I really enjoyed this series, even though it was short-lived.",1201651200,3,1400,4.3307692307692305

This dvd collection is very worth buying if u were a real fan when watching it the first time around. It's perfect, and fun the second time watching it- and so on. I liked that it came with the 5 unaired episodes with it.... at least we can find out what happens at the end of the first season. THe cliffhanger continues... but with the end.... at least we know where it was heading... and what side won.... until it continued.

2380605,3,B000A9QKT6,"Just finished watching the full season on DVD, and I have mixed feelings on it. But I respect that it was at least TRYING to be something cool, and I also have to wonder at FOX's judgement in cancelling it after a mere 8 episodes (in much the same way they gunned down 'Wonderfalls' and 'Firefly' before their times): HELLO guys?! *raps on a Fox exec's forehead*. Anyone in there?

Seriously, its nice that Fox is willing to give edgy, original fare (half) a chance, but they are only understanding half the equation. Offbeat shows like these need TIME TO BUILD AN AUDIENCE. Duh. Can you imagine if 'Seinfeld' had gotten its start on Fox? That thing would've been cancelled in half a season, and replaced by the generic awful reality show of the month. Wooo.

Fox's addled decision-making aside, the show IS a bit of a mixed bag. As the Amazon review rightly points out, the PREMISE of the show is great- the daughter of the Devil himself comes to a small town and things slowly go to hell. Awesome.

But the problem is that the show is slanted a little too heavily towards teenage (and even middle-aged) angst, and a great many of the actors aren't really up to even that task. Marti Noxon, executive producer and creator of the show, is an alum of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and 'Angel', where she learned that even horror- and action-based shows need to play off the personal and emotional for the goings on to have any real impact or resonance. Too true.

But, unfortunately for this goal, and unlike the stellar (before it got decimated by departures) 'Buffy' cast, the 'Point Pleasant' cast is extremely uneven.

On the one hand, we have talented actors and actresses like Dina Meyer (Amber), Aubrey Dollar (Judy- who's very fresh and real in the role), and Grant Show (Lucas Boyd) plugging away with quality portrayals that bring you in and make you care about these characters and the scenes they're in. Meyer's no surprise, she's been good in nearly everything, but Show is a revelation-- he used to be a 'Melrose Place' ham? Wow, what a difference, and so much for the better, as he makes Boyd not only cooly malevolent but a rounded individual, and much more than a 'generic evil guy'.

Heck, even Cameron Richardson (Paula), previously known mainly for taking her top off in bad movies, is perfectly trashy as a stuck up, shallow-but-yearning-for-love small town princess. Not sure she's really a good actress, but she's good for this role.

Unfortunately, the few good performances are offset by a great many wooden pretty boys/gals who just don't understand how to play their roles. And some of the pretty boys/gals are even middle-aged, as everyone in this town seems to look great.

For example, we have Alex Carter playing Logan Parker, the town cop, as a quietly angry man who appears to have graduated from the Steven Seagal School of 'only one facial expression' acting. Clare Carey, plays his wife Sarah as a slightly spaced-out religious fanatic, who is just as tedious as those slightly spaced-out Hare Krishnas you meet at the airport. Oh, and she berates her husband for still being mad about her cheating on him. Very religious, in a Jimmy Swaggart sort of way.

Both are exemplary, though, compared with the hapless Brent Webber, portraying Terry. I think I've seen scrimshaw sculptures that communicated more raw emotional intensity. He has no range whatsoever. The kid was selected purely on his Abercrombie & Fitch looks, and it really shows. Most scenes he's in seem to go thud, the only exception being those between him and Paula.

There's also a good-looking, and, of course, extremely young Latino priest (Marcus Coloma) who doesn't do much except look hot, develop an inappropriate crush on Christina (the devil's daughter), and get killed halfway through the season.  I half expected to see him surfing in tight Speedos while wearing his rosary beads.

We also have Richard Burgi (he of 'Desperate Housewives' fame) and Susan Walters trying gamely as the Kramers, but they either don't seem to understand their roles completely, or are hamstrung by some pretty mediocre writing and dialogue, maybe both. You can slot them in as acceptable, but you don't end up caring much about either character, even though you really should (especially in the case of Meg, given her horrific backstory).

Then we get to Jesse (Sam Page) who's 18 but is being played by a nearly 30-year old actor (which is true of a lot of other roles here). Whatever, it's the Hollywood way, aka the 'Luke Perry' effect.

The problem is, whatever the actor's age, he's simply not that good at giving Jesse any kind of convincing emotional depth or range... he's just kind of the classic 'hero on a pedestal', the ideal boy that Paula and Christina are fighting over in the first few episodes.

While Page is good at portraying THAT guy (the aww shucks emotionally-distant crush figure), he's a lot less self-assured later in the season when the show zeroes in on his and Christina's relationship, and he's presented with some very hard choices as the s*** hits the fan.

Some of the problem is the trying-too-hard-to-keep-us-guessing writing, which intentionally keeps us away from much of Jesse's thought processes, but a lot of is Page himself, who really needs to dredge up some adult-sized and very real agonizing and intensity, and largely fails.

Which brings us to Christina, the Angel of Darkness herself, played by Elisabeth Harnois. THIS is the pivotal role, the make-or-break for the series. And, unfortunately, she is not quite up to it.

I can completely understand WHY Marti Noxon et al cast Harnois... she definitely has the exact right LOOK for the role, a sort of ethereal beauty that seems innocent and a bit alien at the same time. You could see how someone who looks like that could be the Devil's daughter. Unfortunately, you can't see how someone who acts like Harnois does could be that.

The role requires a certain 'wise beyond her years' sadness and heart-wrenching vulnerability, and while Harnois tries, you just don't quite buy it. She doesn't seem like an old soul in a young body or an outsider, but rather, too much like the girl next door and not terribly different from any of the other cute teenage girls (though Harnois is around 25) running around on the beach.

This becomes more and more noticeable as the show goes on and the intensity is ratcheted up. In the final couple of episodes, where Christina is well and truly losing her battle with her own inner darkness, Harnois' take on it is more 'teenage temper-tantrum' than 'Carrie'.  One character describes Christina is more ""fluffy looking"" than you'd expect ultimate evil to be, and, sadly, she's right- Harnois couldn't scare her way out of a paper bag. The rage and betrayal and anguish should be there, and terrifying, and it just isn't.

The uneven acting aside, the show is a bit better than the Amazon review notes, and doesn't quite deserve the gently mocking tone of same.

The pace isn't really 'slow', as the Amazon review purports. I'd say the foreshadowing and build-up of the early episodes is actually a good deal of the fun, in the same way that much of the interest of 'Twin Peaks' was in seeing a small town slowly give up its secrets. That, and you have to flesh out the characters, so you actually care about what happens to them.

Additionally, the photography is GORGEOUS, the natural beauty of the place is stunningly highlighted in big sweeping pans of the shoreline, town, etc.  Almost makes you want to go on vacation there, and it nicely contrasts with the dire events going on.

That said, the show just isn't near scary enough, except for some parts of the final couple of episodes. More of the characters should've been in peril (and from someone other than Christina) from fairly early on, and even in the rare spots when they were, it wasn't done right.

For example, Father Tomas is simply killed off at the end of one episode, seemingly on Boyd's whim. There should've been more dread, more build-up, more fear... Father Tomas should've FELT stalked by evil, should've feared for his life... instead of, 'bang I'm dead'.

Also, you really can't characterize the writing and dialogue of 'Point Pleasant' as any more than adequate- I can think of only one or two memorable or clever lines, and few plot twists that I didn't see coming. If you think a guy's gonna get konked on the head, yep, he pretty much is, and if you think that someone's going out a window and falling to their death, yep, they sure are, about 30 seconds after you saw it coming. This is in contrast to the pilot, which I thought was pretty well-done.

Another problem is that of no payoff in some major subplots. For example, throughout most of the season, its a very big deal that Christina is looking for her mom, who she hopes will be her link to the good side of her nature. But when she finally finds her mom, its totally disappointing... she's literally walking along, and a woman sitting on a bench just basically says, ""Hi, I'm your Mom.""

Nor is there any real buildup to her betrayal of Christina. The whole encounter and character ends up feeling very much out of left field, and you don't care near as much as you should. There should've been more clues, there should've been more of a mystery to unravel, there should've been more EFFORT for Christina to get to her mother. Not a dead end (a suicidal doctor) and then a deus ex machina.

But, the BIG, central problem with 'Point Pleasant' isn't stuff like that, even as damaging as it is. Again, it's the 'looks over acting ability' casting... seems like EVERYTHING'S a teen melodrama these days, even a series about the (potential) AntiChrist. You 'gots to have' your army of pretty 26 year old cast members pretending to be teenagers these days. Maybe they should've retitled this show 'Abercrombie & Uberb****'.

Ok, so maybe Fox wasn't *completely* wrong in cancelling this one, for once, though it should be pointed out that there is much less ambitious, much lower quality TV fare out there doing well. You can kind of fall in love with 'Point Pleasant' for what its TRYING to be. Even flawed, it's still a great guilty pleasure, and with some revamping, could've had a pretty strong second season. We'll never know, because Fox has the attention span of a gnat. You could probably put together a pretty great network with all the good shows they've cancelled.

Though you'd think a two-hour 'Point Pleasant' TV movie wrapping it all up would still have some ratings appeal. Hmm... nah. We couldn't get this cast together again... they'd all be out tanning or getting their hair done.

Ah well. Here's hoping someone can get a good gothic horror series off the ground sometime soon. I really miss the good ol' 'Buffy Seasons 2 and 3' glory days, and I'm far from alone. Whoever gets it right will do well.

Sidenote- Reading some of the other reviews, people REALLY need to ease off some of the comparisons to other shows being made. 'Buffy' is fair game, since 'Point Pleasant' creator Marti Noxon was executive producer on both shows, but... 'Charmed'? 'Dawson's Creek'? The 'O.C.'? Get real. Just because a show has the supernatural or teenagers in it, does not automatically make it like all other shows that have the supernatural or teenagers in them.

By that logic, 'Lost' and 'Magnum P.I' are the same show, because they both take place on a Pacific island. Sigh.

2380607,5,B000A9QKT6,"This show is such a guilty pleasure.  Like (most of) the other reviewers I was extremely unhappy when FOX yanked this off the air 5 episodes short of the finale, especially as they had spent a fair amount of time introducing us (the viewers) to the wonderfully twisted characters of Point Pleasant.  I thought the acting in the series was well above average for primetime dramas, particularly the leads who are very convincing in (let's face it) roles that could have been very cartoonish in the hands of lesser actors.  The production values of the show were also very good.

Now thankfully we have the DVDs so we can see how the season ends and the show doesn't disappoint.  The ending stays away from predictability, and the final few episodes in particular are much darker in tone than what came before.  The last few episodes do seem a bit rushed compared so I have to wonder if the producers rushed them because they knew the series was ending.  I would love a Season Two but I don't think that will happen.  However the show ends in a way that most of the major mysteries are answered so while it is a cliffhanger, it is quite satisfying.

2380637,4,B000A9QKT6,"Point Pleasant is a great show, plain and simple. The plot is engaging and ever-evolving, the acting, in most cases, is great, and it's left me thinking about it days after seeing the final episode. If one single show can do that, I consider that a big accomplishment. Forget that Point Pleasant was cancelled, forget they didn't even air the final five episodes, I think it ended rightfully. I loved the Kramer's (well, I loved Judy, I didn't much like Meg or Ben), but I don't want to watch them follow Christina for an entire season. Seeing how Christina grasped her powers throughout the season, seeing how she dealt with love and anger, seeing how much she wanted to know her mom, all of that worked wonderfully. What would she have done in the next season? Kill people? No, it ended how it should've.

SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD!

Point Pleasant's plot isn't difficult to comprehend. Christina is the daughter of satan. She's somehow sent to a quaint town, Point Pleasant, because a priest had foreseen that a young girl would be the one to commence the end of days. When she shows signs of grasping her true abilities (i.e., being able to do anything imaginable), a man, Boyd, comes to influence her to come to the dark side (excuse the Star Wars reference). But in the end, it's all up to Christina in what happens with Point Pleasant.

My biggest gripe with Point Pleasant is the sub-plots. Interesting? Sometimes. Needed? Not entirely. We can see from the get-go that Ben Kramer doesn't think his wife, Meg, is sane. What we don't need is nearly entire episodes devoted solely to those two characters. I want to see how Boyd influences the town. I want to see how Christina deals with her emotions. I want to see how Judy and Christina really get along. Those are what I want to see, I don't want to see how some ex-girlfriend of a main character goes on without him. I don't care. That aside, when Point Pleasant is focused on Christina, it's chilling, it's engaging, it's hard to look away.

If the plot catches your attention and you think you might like it, check it out. Sure the only bonus feature is a 'making of' but the episodes speak for themselves. There's suspense, there's humor, there's love. Point Pleasant was destined to fail. It deals too closely with religion and believing, but if that stuff doesn't bother you than you just may have found a show that won't disappoint.

2380642,3,B000A9QKT6,"I have to agree with the rater who compared Point Pleasant to my favorite show Twin Peaks. The first thing that came to mind was that Point Pleasant tries to be kind of like a ""modern"" Twin Peaks for a younger generation. But this does not work. The substance was just not there. It staid too much on the surface without really touching the evil that lies within (except for Grant Show who did deliver at times). Plus the humor, which is an important factor, was missing.

With that said, I have to confess that I did enjoy watching the plot develop on disc two. There were some good ideas there that could have / should have been developed. The last Episode seemed like it was made up in a hurry when the show was cancelled. Everything was packed into that  episode and then there was this cliffhanger at the end.

The next 6 episodes were fast-paced, focused, tightly written, filled with surprises. Just a total turnaround and I couldn't stop watching. My only disappointment was with the last 30 minutes, which leaves the series with a major cliffhanger and does not provide resolutions clever or satisfying enough for me.

The overall season plot is very similiar to the Dark Willow descension/revenge arc in Buffy, but frankly, not as poignant or accessible. Unlike Buffy, Firefly, Angel, Tru Calling, Wonderfalls or Roswell, the series lacks any sense of humor which made it less endearing. Lastly, it was difficult for me to figure out if I should be supporting the protagonist character or not.

There are numerous attempts to be ominous, attempts at ""something larger"" or ""something deeper,"" but the show simply doesn't have that substance to carry it out.

It's reminds me of something like The Simpsons episode where the dog has ""shifty eyes"" so you know he is evil.  This is a string of already-done-better plot devices with no substance - hence my suggestion to look at Twin Peaks to see how something like this should be done.

2380662,3,B000A9QKT6,"This show never aired in my home country, and all I knew about the show was what I'd read on the Internet.  When it aired in the US, it got mediocre reviews at best.  Even the Buffy fans, who tuned in because of Marti Noxon's involvement, seemed largely disappointed.

So when I decided to order it anyway, I didn't have extremely high expectations.

I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  While the show was far from brilliant, I did find myself being drawn in from the first episode and eagerly wanted to find out what happened next.

The premise of the show is very interesting.  I think that the way in which the plot was set up was quite well done.  The gothic look and feel was also different from what you see in other shows, and provided the perfect setting for the plot.  The show was also quite ""gutsy"" in its use of religion, which is not something that you would normally find in a TV show.

However, there were also some major flaws.  Firstly, the show's blending of soap opera and supernatural drama often didn't work, with some episodes focussing too much on the soap elements.  Yes, the show's exploration of how the supernatural elements would affect human relationships was interesting and essential, but could simply have been done a bit better.

The show's second major flaw was the pacing.  The show started off very slowly, with the focus clumsily shifting between different characters.  Luckily, this was resolved by episode five, at which point things started moving comfortably.  Unfortunately, again, the pacing flaws returned during the last two episodes when the writers tried to cram too much into each episode.  This is however somewhat understandable, given the fact that the show had been cancelled and they only had a few episodes left in which to resolve the story.

Another flaw was the writing.  The writing wasn't bad per se, but there were certain points where the dialogue was really atrocious, almost the kind of lines that you would expect in a low-budget daytime soap.  Also, character motivations were often forced and not allowed to develop realistically.  As I've already mentioned, towards the end of the series the writers tried to cram way too much into too little time.  Given the show's premature cancellation, one couldn't really expect a total resolution of all plotlines, but I was still disappointed with the ending.  While the build-up to the final ending was commendable, the payoff wasn't worth it as no plotlines were really resolved, with a mostly open ending.  This does leave quite a bit of room for the series to continue in some way or another, but given the show's lack of success this is quite unlikely.

The show's biggest flaw was the casting, particularly that of the teenage characters.  The two lead actors, Elizabeth Harnois (as Christina) and Samuel Page (as Jesse) give lacklustre performances at best, not really managing to pull off the emotional depths required of their characters.  Brent Weber (Terry), Cameron Richardson (Paula) and Marcus Coloma (Father Tomas) are almost laughably bad, giving the kind of terrible performances you would expect from a really LOW-budget show (such as 'Passions').

The acting isn't all bad, however.  Aubrey Dollar (Judy) is the one teenager who gives a really commendable performance, while most of the adult actors are also very good.  However, Grant Show (Lucas) and Dina Meyer (Amber) steals the show with performances that are simply stellar.

Overall, the show definitely had some major flaws, but it was still good enough to become a delicious guilty pleasure for me.  It was certainly better than a lot of high-rated shows still running, and the cancellation was really premature and undeserved.  However, I can't imagine the show running for three or more seasons as I felt that the plot simply didn't provide enough potential for more than two seasons.

Regarding the DVD set, the video and audio quality is consistently good and the behind-the-scenes featurette is worthwhile (though too short), but it would've been nice if they'd included some commentaries at least.

2380692,3,B000A9QKT6,"Axed by Fox after airing eight episodes, Point Pleasant was another of a handfull of shows to never get the time needed to grow.  However, for everything that Point Pleasant does right, it does a lot wrong.  The storyline centers around a girl named Christina (Elisabeth Harnois) who is taken in by a family and is soon revealed to be none other than the daughter of Satan, and will play a role in the coming apocalypse.  The storyline is nothing new, but there was a lot of room here to work with to make the show something special, but thanks to Fox it never took off.  Grant Show is undoubtadly the best part of the series as the evil Lucas Boyd, but the rest of the cast isn't anything to write home about.  Besides TV veteran Richard Burgi and Starship Troopers' Dina Meyer, the rest of the cast is stiff and wooden, but when it appears that they were cast on mostly their looks alone, this isn't much of a surprise.  The story has it's share of fumbles and predictability and it's too melodramatic for it's own good, but that is something that occurs with most first seasons before the show really takes off (remember the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer?).  Speaking of Buffy, it should be noted that Point Pleasant is co-created by Buffy alum Marti Noxon (who it is rumored tried to recruit James ""Spike"" Marsters for the show in a guest role), so who knows what direction the show could have taken had Fox given it more of a chance.  Just like countless other sci-fi/dramas to hit Fox over the past decade, Point Pleasant was axed too early by the geniuses at Fox, but for die hard fans of the show, this DVD set is a must have, although a few more extras would have been more than welcome.",1132617600,9,1707,4.414012738853503
2380693,5,B000A9QKT6,"Following on the heels of Firefly and Wonderfalls, Point Pleasant joins the ranks of great shows cancelled by Fox before it had a chance to find its audience.  The story centers around Christina Nickson(Elisabeth Harnois), a girl who falls off a boat, is rescued and then taken in by the Kramer family in the town of Point Pleasant.  But Christina's father isn't her real father, her real father is is in fact Satan himself while her mother is a human who she has never met.  I starting watching this show because Dina Meyer was in it. I'm a fan of hers, in particular of her portryal of Oracle on ""Birds of Prey""(another great show canceled too soon, this one by the WB, that's one show Fox doesn't get the blame for, and puts Dina as starring in two shows canceled prematurely).  Dina plays Amber Hargrove, a hot single mom, and the town whore.  On lesser shows that's all her character would remain, but as the series goes on she's not as one dimensional as she seems, another reason why Point Pleasant is a superior show.  Relative newcomer Elisabeth Harnois is excellent as Christina. As the series opens, she appears to be a sweet innocent girl, but with a few flashes of darkness.  With each episode her character gets a little bit darker, as the part of her that is her father fights for supremacy.  You can't help but feel sympathy for Christina, you're cheering for her good side to win out.  Elisabeth plays both sides of the coin so well.  If the right opportunities present themself, she will be a breakout star in the next few years. Also must give high marks to Grant Show, who is the main villain in the series, Satan's right hand man who is there to encourage Christina's dark side. Harnois, Show, and Meyer are the top actors on the show, but the entire cast is capable. As other reviewers have noted, the series starts out much like a supernatural version of the O.C., but with each episode, it becomes more supernatural drama and less teen soap opera.  Series cocreator Marti Noxon said the show found it's identity about halfway through, then Fox canceled it after episode 8 just when it was hitting its stride.  What's even more unbelievable is they replaced it's timeslot with leftover episodes of Tru Calling, a vastly inferior show that Fox had already decided to cancel.  After buying the DVD, I watched all 13 episodes in four days.  It gets better with each episode as it builds momentum.  If you watched the eight episodes on TV, it is definitely worth buying the DVD to watch the last five.  If you watched Point Pleasant and gave up on it before the eight episodes aired, get the DVD and pick up where you left, you won't regret it.  And if you never watched Point Pleasant and are looking for a good supernatural drama, get it.  Be warned, the series does not end with resolution, all the more reason there is more story to be told.  A Point Pleasant TV movie or miniseries would be great.  If that's ever to happen, the DVD sales will be a major factor.  So all Point Pleasant fans should spread the word.  Buy it as a gift, if you don't have it yourself yet, put it on your Christmas list. Point Pleasant should go on.",1132444800,14,3152,4.512323943661972

2380697,5,B000A9QKT6,"So how good was this this. I couldn't wait to watch it every week. Then I ordered it thru Netflix and watched all three discs on my days off. Tonight, I ordered the 3 DVD's new. Yes, it was that good. Great really.
  Every actor on this show became their charactor. Every single one. Unlike a review I read tonight, this in my opinion was not The Omen meets the O.C. I don't watch the O.C. but I did see the Omen. In the Omen the ""Star"" was rotten to the core before finding out who he was. He loved being Satans kid. The opposite was true in point pleasant. She was a beautiful girl who hated who she was. The poor kid much like the series never had a chance.
  When she's kicked out and says, ""You're  all the family I've got"" I never felt worse while watching a show. The acting was unreal. She was so real. No camera tricks or music to hi-light the scene. Just great great acting.
  You can't compare this to Buffy or Angel, long running shows with this but I'd love to see this for many years. I write few reviews but this show ""moved me"". So sad to see a person who comes off as so real get hurt so bad.
  When she meets her Mother I felt her pain. People worse than devils everywhere.
  So what about Fox. Great entertainment and then they cancel. Go figure.
  Slow start? Not that I can remember. Great top to bottom.
And futhermore.

  Would the ""Anti-christ"" beg to save the life of a friend? Like in the real world, who your parents are matters. I have to admit your father being Satan is different than being a jail-bird or drug addict but still seeing the world wanting to kill a young girl, a victum of her-own birthright, it's still sad. The ending should not have been the ending. This show should have joined Buffy and Angel but Fox doesn't like to do things like that anymore. I want more.",1131321600,6,1807,4.209302325581396
2380698,5,B000A9QKT6,"Point Pleasant was a series that never really got given a chance. Unfortunately, it was subject to a very long lead up to the action and special effect (6 - 7 episodes). I realise this was to do with the background to the story characters, but nevertheless this could have been much shorter (say 3 episodes). Thus, audiences quickly got bored unless you were a die hard fan. I think if all episodes had been aired, then viewing figures would have easily increased towards the end of the series. I thought it ridiculous that everywhere it was airing it was suddenly taken off TV without warning due to American audience figures!! I have read all reviews online and in the newspapers and the majority outside the states say it was a fantastic series. It is a pity that Fox could have not sold the rights on.  Anyway, for a DVD set this is a fantastic buy, and finishes with a very explosive end to the series! - Well worth watching!!",1131235200,6,931,4.476470588235294

Anyway. The show itself: sensational acting, spooky plot, believable characters and yeah, quite sexy too. TV just doesn't get any better than this.",1131148800,7,588,4.70873786407767
2380700,5,B000A9QKT6,"When Point Pleasant first aired I was addicted to it. It was something I'd never seen done on television, especially during that network season last year. It combines many different plot elements: a little soapy at parts with teen melodramas and adulterous attractions, but there is also the heavy undercurrent of the supernatural, which is what holds the series together. Such an interesting concept: teenage girl finds out she's the daughter of the Devil himself and must combat the evil within her if she has any chance of preventing an Apocalypse.

I loved this show so much, and waited in anticipation every week, wondering what new twist or secret we would learn. I was very saddened when the show got cancelled because the audience was left hanging, so I am so excited Fox at least released all 13 episodes (even the 5 unaired ones!!) on DVD. I'm glad they at least did that for Point Pleasant fans.

I just bought my copy of the DVDs and I can't wait to watch the final 5 episodes, as I hear they are the best. I just hope the story reaches a good enough resolution at the end, and from what I've gleaned from other reviews, it does. I guess I'll just have to see for myself!!

So, definately look into this wonderful series. The cast is beautiful, and for the most part, it is well-acted too. Elisabeth Harnois, who plays the lead, Christina, is gorgeous, and you really feel for her when she's struggling between good and evil. She does her transitions so well, and I was impressed with how much emotions she exuded from me while watching her on screen.

Overall, Point Pleasant is absolutely amazing, and it is shame it got cancelled without really giving viewers enough time to discover it's greatness. But as the saying goes, time is money these days, especially when it comes to TV shows, which is too bad. Maybe, just maybe, if sales for this DVD are high, Fox might re-look into bringing back this series. Keep your fingers crossed!!",1131062400,4,1949,4.6405797101449275

The show is great; having a nice little, Gothic/Buffy/The O.C. meets the Omen and what ever happened to Rosemary's Baby, kind of vibe.

It just really sucks that shows like this get cancelled before they get a chance to really shine, and other shows that are mediocre at best, keep getting renewed.

My hope is that they'll get enough DVD sales that will allow them to at lest make up a concluding mini series, like was done with Farscape, because even though the last few ep's manage to tie up some loose ends, the show still screams for a second season.",1130889600,3,777,4.3310344827586205

One, ""The O.C."" sucks and shouldn't blend with anything. After the first four episodes the show turned more towards the supernatural and improved but got cancelled after eight episodes, sadly. Thankfully, this DVD set includes the last 5 episodes that never aired and they are good. Especially the last 3 episodes which are phenominal!! Absolutely brilliant!!!! It was a very unconventional ending!!!!! The only special feature is a 14 minute making-of-featurette which is better than nothing!

That said, Point Pleasant was an absolute pleasure to watch, not in spite of but because of its trashiness.  I think the reason that it was such a great guilty pleasure was that the cast (mostly soap opera cast-offs) knew exactly what the show was and didn't take it too seriously (and maybe even played up the cheese factor intentionally), whereas the director(s) seemed to be going for real, genuine drama.

2380727,4,B000A9QKT6,"**MAY CONTAIN SLIGHT SPOILERS*

""Point Pleasant"" is a gothic soap opera created by Marti Noxon, best known as the woman who writes great depressing stories on The WB's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". I am a huge fan of ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"", but I personally enjoy ""Point Pleasant"" better.

Now don't get me wrong. This show has serious problems, it's biggest one being that the pilot was specially designed to best ensure a pickup by FOX. It has many elements of ""The OC"" and FOX was right in thinking it would work best with ""The OC"" compared to the other shows on their schedule.

""Point Pleasant"" has loads of potential. Everything is there. A great premise, capable actors, beautiful locations, character backstories, everything that was there could have become a huge ongoing battle between good and evil, with the forces of heaven and hell battling on Earth. And I do believe that's what it would have become if the writers were able to run with it.

What 13 episodes there are, however, are still good even with their faults. The actors aren't exactly award-winners, but they get the job done quite nicely. Elisabeth Harnois, our protaganist, is the perfect choice for the daughter of Satan and a God-fearing woman. She's beautiful, and usually angelic but can become overcome with her hellborn powers in an instant. Harnois is good at instant transitions and I love the scenes where her character knows that she's too weak to drown her evil nature but doesn't know what to do. Anyway, the series opens up on Point Pleasant, New Jersey, although we're not sure if this is Point Pleasant or the town of Point Pleasant Beach. There's a difference. But it's a nice day with hot girls sunbathing on the beach, but an otherwordly storm quickly gathers and runs everyone off the beach. Jesse, a young lifeguard, spots something floating in the ocean and swims out. It's Christina. He takes her to the Kramers since the roads are closed so the doctor can look at her.

Soon Christina is living with the Kramers, and befriends their daughter Judy, whose older sister died years earlier. Her mother still has not gotten over it.

The show begins to shed its allusions of ""The OC"" immediately, although it does not completely do so until about the fifth episode. We see the characters evolve. The town whore soon stops her ways and tries to make things right, the love triangles become actually important to the actual story, etc. The series uses LOTS of symbolism and is very, very smart with it, proving that it is not the shallow waste of time people claim it to be.

The character relationships and the things that happen are important to whether the townspeople will be on the side of evil or the side of good. Judy's mother realizes that she is not crazy like people believe, but she has a connection with the spirit world and may be psychic. We also discover that Jesse died as a child but came back, and he is destined to kill Christina, the Antichrist, even though they have an unbearable attraction for one another. This adds much flavor and promise to the show, as Christina does not WANT to be evil and tries fighting it, yet people keep having visions of what she's destined to do to the town, and it's not pleasant. (Pun not intended.)

As different as the two shows are, ""Point Pleasant"" could be compared to ""Dark Shadows"". Both are a part of an extremely rare breed. How many gothic/horror soaps appear on television? Not many at all. ""Dark Shadows"", both the 60s and 90s versions, are also favorites of mine. And the short-lived CBS horror drama ""American Gothic"" was similar in style to ""Point Pleasant"", so if you like those shows you might want to check out ""Point Pleasant"".

Other things I'd like to point out is the EXCELLENT music used in the opening title sequence. It was written by Danny Elfman, who also did the ""Desperate Housewives"" theme song and has done nearly every Tim Burton film. The music used throughout the show, while not written by Elfman, is also good and sets up the atmosphere nicely. The filmwork is also nice, and looks great in widescreen, and a blue film is used quite a bit and it can be effective.

Overall the show is good, but it's no surprise many ""Buffy"" fans were displeased, because the two shows are completely different. However, if you are into dark, religious themed shows and movies or you just like creepy supernatural adventures, ""Point Pleasant"" is definitely worth a buy or rent.",1129248000,36,4438,4.7001287001287

It wasn't just some crazy nonsensical tv soap (in fact, the soapy parts were the ones that should have been cut in my opinion, I'm not some silly person who watches crap like the OC). Well, I decided to watch it again next time and see how it went, and, of course, the second episode was even better. Somehow this reminded me of the comic series Spawn. It was great, and each episode answer some questions, added some new ones, and gave us tiny hints to some others, and then put twists on even more.
