I'm no fan of Luhrman and his excess.  That said, this is early Luhrman on a budget.  It never overreaches (which can't be said of GATSBY etc).  It achieves great things in small details.

Like West Side Story, Boheme wants a youthful cast and voices.  What matters so profoundly and with such feeling in our 20s is so very different as we have the opportunity to age.  Boheme is about youth and possibilty.

Small details work so effortlessly.  The ""lost key"" in between Mimi and Rudolfo adds a nice element for the actors to play while acquiting themselves (beautifully, I must say) of their big first act numbers.  The revolving stage to reveal the lit sign at the end of act one is a coup de theatre that any director/design team would want on their resume.

POEM VERSE; A RENT PLAY FANS GUIDE TO WHAT HAPPENS IN BOHE`ME, NON FI

by

Mark Walter Meredith

  It all begins on Christmas Eves day.

  Marc. C. is living in the attic studio apartment of a building making a picture.

  It is Christmas Eves day, and Marc. wants to get out that evening, and do something but he only gets enough money barely to finally eat every once in a while, and sometimes eat dinner at the nearby Caf.

  Still he doesnt want to stay inside all evening: even if Marc. has to use an errand as excuse to get out, and Marc. has to do drudge work on that errand.

  The window in the back of the stage is practically a wall of smaller windowpane in general making a giant windows -wall.

  In the middle of the large studio apartment there is an old fashioned wood burning stove, a table, and a backup candle in case its too dark.

  Marc. starts to ask what R. is doing.

 Marc.s roommate R. is putting off his writing of stanzas that rhyme: finally: after so long.

  Collin. comes back to the building, and gets the key so that Collin. could open the door.

  Marc. has recently been broken up with by Marc.s girlfriend so that she could date a richer person.

  Marc.s ex-girlfriend has always been a vivacious person who people like to party with, and it is very easy to be jealous of the people that hang around her: and mistake her friendships for romantic interests in others that isn't really there.

  A rent slip is soon held out as the person sings out, Rent!!!

  There is no electricity so Marcs. roommate has lit a candle because it is too shadowy to see what they are doing.

  Marc. notes that, were [hungry.]

  Marc. jokes that the writing that R. has written sounds awful.

  Marc.: R.: hear the property owner, and try to screen Bennie but he still gets through.

  An interval was now up, and Ben wants the rent that is then due now that he arrives.

  R.: Marcs. roommate has grabbed some pages of his writing, and has burned them for warmth.

  Marc. had wanted to burn two of his pictures.

  Marc. had been burning one of his thousand word descriptions: but when the room mate was then burning Rs. poetry: he was saying things like how the fires warmth was like the warmth of a womans ardent, passionate: love.

  R. says that his papers have the spark of wit!

  He didn't want to spend what little Marc.-himself was wanting to save for dinner at the Caf` so Marc. drew a line, and made a stand, and didn't agree to Bens payment.

 Ben walked away from that door of the building without his payment: yet at least: and Ro.: Marc. close the door with the lock behind them.

  Marc. C., and R. have to pay at least three months of rent backed up.
Meredith-2 A RENT PLAY FANS GUIDE TO WHAT HAP

  Later when Collins finally meets up with Schunard.: Collin is asked if Collin is dying: he says he is not dead unfortunately: not yet at the least.

  Mimi: walks up the stairs: blowing out Mimis candle.

  R. tries to write but cannot.

  Mimi is a young Latino woman.

  A petite young woman: later: knocks on the door to the apartment: her name is Mimi: she lives in the building, and Mimi pretends that she needs a match: for somebody to help ignite her candle with her.

  When Mimi spins around, she feels faint, and loses her balance for a second.

  The room is spinning around Mimis head: to her.

  R. catches her before Mimi regains Mimis balance shortly: and her composure too.

  R. asks if Mimi is O.K.

  After R. lights her (Mimis) candle: Ro. D. says, Good night.

  Mimi walks to the doorway, and the breeze coming through the edges of the window, and making a draft near the door is about to blow out the candle.

  The ideal woman lets the candle blow out purposefully.

  Mimi says that she has dropped the key to: how Mimi was going to spend the rest of her evening.

  R is staring at Mimis head, and how beautiful it is in the moonlight.

  R. looks at Mimis hair in the moonlight: shining: Mimi has a halo of light around her head: looking like an angel of the first degree.

  Mimi asks R. D. to help Mimi look for her key to the rest of her evening.

  The candles they both are holding coincidentally are snuffed out just then.

  Mimi, and R. feel along the ground hurriedly, and R. coincidentally finds her key, and puts it into R.s pocket because R. doesnt want her to have it.

  Mimi, and R.S hands meet, and R., Mimi hold hands for warmth!

  Mimi gets Mimis key from R.

  She says, They call me Mimi:

Mark W. Meredith

  Marc. sings along a musical number about how Mos eyes burn when she feeds on other mens burning desire for Mo.: Marc. sings along with his musical song about the dance that Mo makes the people Mo flirts with: go through.

  Mo  has sung a musicals song about how when Mo is walking down the street everybody stares at Mo.

  Mo, and life partner both say, Good by at the same time as Mo walks off going Mimis own way!

  Three days have passed.

  R. gets jealous that Mimi is cheating with someone else.

  Who is R. jealous of?

  Most likely Rs jealous the landlord Ben is having an affair with Mimi: Ben: who has said that he has cheated on Bens wife.

  R.s jealousy makes Mimi, and R. miserable.

  R. is leaving the building, and thinks that Mimi isn't there listening when R. says out loud that R. cannot let himself get any closer to Mimi because R. is afraid of Mimi dying soon: and R. cannot let himself be hurt by Mimis dying.

  When R. sees that Mimi was there listening to R. the whole time R. was talking: Mimi says good-by. to R.

  The weather is cold again when Marc.  has left a tavern, and was overhearing Mimi saying that Mimi is miserable because R is jealous, and that R., and Mimi were going to break up.

  Mimi has to say, Good by love. R. cannot split up from Mimi: nor be away from Mimi.

  Mimi had been driven outside into the snowy-day by Mimis misery.

  Mimi is coughing because Mimi was driven out into the snowy day by Mimis misery over Rs. jealousy.

  R. tries to write R.s poetry with a pen but cant find his song because R. is thinking about Mimi, and R. is being consumed by love.

  Mimi doesnt want R. to split from Mimi so they decide to stay together, and wait for spring, and take it day-to-day, and see where the day takes them until Mimis sickness claims her: and live for the moment: because its better to forget the past: because the past is gone: and there is no day but today!

  Mimi has gone to live in a rich place but when the end of the opera comes it turns out that Mimi has gone missing, and Mo is helping to look for Mimi.

  R. knows that Mimi was Rs. writing-piece since the night R. was procrastinating all R. poetry, and Mimi became his inspiration.

  Marc. when he is making Marc.s picture:  Marc. keeps sensing a pair of lips: inspiring Marc. to make Marc.s picture.

  Finally, Mo happens upon Mimi in the cold: barely able to walk.

  R. tells Mimi not to talk, and to rest, and Mimi instead whispers.

  Marc. has said that R. has found Rs. poetry.

  Marc, Collin., and R. are back in their studio apartment all  without life partners: now.

  Doctors are called but they aren't coming in time.

  Mimi is dying of disease when Mo happens to come across Mimi so Mimi says to bring her to Marc.s apartment building.

  Mo helps carry Mimi to Marcs. apartment building.

  Mimi wants to spend her last moments with R.

  R. in Mimis presence has sung: letting her know that Mimi is the incarnation of song itself.

  Mimi was told that she was Rs. poem all along.

  R. told Mimi that R. didn't get mad at Mimi because R. didn't love her: it was because R. did love Mimi, and he didn't want to be hurt by getting close to her right before she died.

  R. has said about how R.s love came into Rs. life when R. saw Mimi Mos eyes come into R.s door for the first time.

  R. has said to Mimi that her brown eyes had surprised R. the night Mimis pretty eyes came into R.s life.

  R. cradles Mimis lifeless body.

  Suddenly: Mimi has an out-of-body experience because her heart stops, and Mimi stops breathing for a while.

  R. after a while R. cries out, MM-II-I-MI-I-III-I!!!!

  Mimis hand falls off where shes lying when Mimis spirit leaves her body.

1060411,3,6305639426,"This opera is well sung and the music is well played, but I don't care much for Baz Luhrmans staging.  In particular I was really disappointed with the overall look of the third act.  Traditionaly, this act is an opportunity for the stage people to show off their skills and create a breathtaking outdoor winter scene.  This third act looked like it took place in a concentration camp.
Another thing I didn't like about this production, is the half-dead Australian audience, who apparently feel that applause is impolite. The only time they reacted was at the end of each act.  I never heard any ""bravos"" or ""bravas,""  even though they were clearly deserved.
If you are looking for a nice DVD of this opera, I suggest one presented live by the Metropolitan Opera.",1191974400,,763,4.706766917293233
1060412,5,6305639426,"When I first saw this production on television, I was mesmerised by the stunning performance of the cast, but David Hobson in particular. Here is a Rudolph who sings his heart out to an exciting Mimi. Hobson's voice fills the auditorium with its richness, and power. He also is a talented actor, making one believe that he is very much in love with Mimi. The added advantage of subtitles makes watching all the more enjoyable. The scene is set in 1950's Paris, and the principals are all young enough to be playing a band of Bohemians with positive conviction. (Not overweight, not over aged). This DVD should be included in every opera lovers collection, and those who enjoy excellent classical singing.",1162944000,,704,4.8264462809917354
1060413,3,6305639426,"This is an overall satisfying production of La Boheme, including the cast, sets, camerawork, and musical direction. Yet I believe that the advantage of having a youthful cast for this opera has been much overplayed. True, that is a significant factor, but the music should always be paramount over considerations of appearance. Particularly, it seems to me that tenor David Hobson's rather thin voice is not very well suited to late 19th century verismo operas such as those of Puccini. Some reviewers here have stated that he usually has sung music from an earlier era, for which his voice is more suited. I have not heard him other than in this production, but that seems likely to me. However, Cheryl Barker is fine as Mimi. My favorite production of La Boheme is 1972 audio recording with Mirella Freni and Luciano Pavarotti, with Von Karajan conducting, in which everything works splendidly. At any rate, I think that this Australian Opera production of La Boheme is a good one, just not my favorite.",1161129600,,1005,4.883040935672515
1060414,5,6305639426,"Young, passionate performers with voices to match their passion and their acting - innovative staging but, most impressive to me - the pefect blend of acting and singing, bringing tears more than once. This version of La Boheme is outstanding!",1146441600,,243,5.1
1060415,5,6305639426,"I was introduced to opera literally by a friend who sat my wife and me down on his deck overlooking San Francisco Bay back in the 60s, and played selections from Bjoerling's Boheme. A couple of years later we went to the San Francisco Opera to see Pavarotti and Freni in an earthquake interrupted triumph. Over the years I've seen Boheme many times (most recently two years ago a snoozer the Met) and own many recordings and videos as part of a very extensive collection.

This afternoon I put this dvd on my computer, thinking I would stick it up in a corner and go about other work. Impossible to do. Soon I had it almost full screen, had turned out the lights and just let it rip on a good monitor and through a superb sound system. I'm not really an expert about these things, and I'm certainly not a purist. But if I wanted to create for someone else the excitement of hearing Bjoerling on that old RCA recording I'd give them this and a bottle of wine. They, too, would be hooked. Even without English subtitles (which I didn't miss for a second).

Sure, it doesn't star Luciano or Jesse at their best, but Hobson and cast, thanks to fine direction, bring it to the video medium with style and, incidentially, very fine singing and, especially in the case of Barker, wonderful acting. And, though a few have quibled about some of the ensemble bits, I found them rather fresh and fun -- in this case fine theatre. There probably are some minor issues. Now and then I found the audio just a tad too crisp, but at the end of the day this is the one I will watch over and over.",1134172800,,1579,4.331081081081081
1060416,5,6305639426,The Australian Opera production of La Boheme is superb viewing.  The singing is moving and the vocal quality excellent - what fabulous singers!  Baz Luhrmann created a magical production and every aspiring opera singer should watch how these singers combine the beauty of voice with the demands of acting.  Excellent production - bravo!,1134086400,,336,5.30188679245283
1060467,2,6305639426,"DVD looks GOOD. Mimi sounds OK. Rodolpho sings with little strength and less conviction. For those who put more credence in surface quality and less on singing find this Boheme wonderful, but I must caution those prospective buyers who still consider the singing in an opera as first and foremost: you will be disappointed. I bought this and stopped it during the Gelida Manina, as the sound of beautiful music being sung by this Rodolpho was too much to bear. I suppose that the appeal of this version of La Boheme is for young people who long for a classical MTV with pretty faces and not so much talent. Sad.",1121299200,,611,4.5636363636363635
1060468,5,6305639426,"What's the point of opera on DVD if the singers aren't reasonably attractive?  Everyone here is good looking and just the right age.  I don't know if Hobson's voice is too thin for the role, as some people here have said, but it's good enough for me... che gelida manina brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it, and when he sobs at the end, I do too...everyone else in the cast is great...I don't think I'd feel the same if the singers were old and fat.  True, Jussi Bjorling's old recordings of this make my hair stand on end even more, but for a visual performance, you can't do better than this, I think.",1118880000,,613,4.222222222222222
1060469,4,6305639426,"La Boheme is one of my favorite operas and I own a couple of different versions.  I bought this out of curiosity and am glad I did.  To see Boheme performed with such youthful exuberance and innocence is a joy - it is fitting that Hobson and Barker are youthful as that is how the characters are meant to be and they played their roles beautifully. The voices lack experience, but are more than adequate, especially David Hobson.  Cheryl Barker can sound a little strained in the top range, however all of this can be forgiven because of the delightful perfomances and sheer emotion they bring to the role.  The only version that I can say I prefer is the Carreras/Stratas version, and that is mainly due to Theresa Stratas.  My thirteen year old daughter actually sat and watched this Boheme and the modern setting and youthful singers were very appealing to her - this may well be a good introduction to opera for younger people.  If you want to see something other than the usual standard opera, buy this DVD, have an open mind and enjoy.",1118793600,,1041,4.540106951871658
1060470,5,6305639426,"More than half a year ago, I ordered this DVD after a rather disappointing live Boheme experience. I made my choice based on some of the reviews I read here. But, little was I prepared for was an opera performance that totally blown me away! Needless to say that this has been the most watched opera DVD in my house, ever since! This performance of La Boheme is so refreshing, so genuine, and so touching, that I was totally grabbed from the first note to the last.

With an updated timeline, presented to us were the young bohemian's poverty, careless life style, and the most heart breaking love story, portrayed by singers who gave the most compelling, and brilliant performances. This is the greatest cast for Boheme. David Hobson's Rodolfo is simply magnificent! His beautiful voice sings the famous aria ""che gelida manina"" with such power and tenderness, and duets in the 3rd and 4th acts with such caring and heart breaking emotion. Cheryl Barker's Mimi is beautiful, vulnerable, and moving. However, what made it most memorable is that they are both great actors, and their acting is so drastic a contrast to the long established opera stereotypes. Key to the success of this production, their acting helped convey the music and story beyond the play itself!

What prompted me to write a review after so many months was because of a new discovery from the Internet. A website, dedicated to the great Australian tenor David Hobson's career, [...] I fell completely in love with David's performance in Boheme since I saw him for the first time, and have been looking for more information about him online. This website provides the most detailed and fascinating biography, stories, reviews, opera performances, recordings, pictures and sound clips. Not only it's most fun and satisfactory to browse through, also, it gives people more understanding and appreciation of David Hobson as a true musician and artist! It's a shame that he is not known to more American opera goers!",1110412800,,1983,4.916417910447761
1060471,5,6305639426,"This is a wonderful....simply rapturous staging of La Boheme.  These singing actors put to shame the ancient Stand and Sing tradtion in Opera.

  First I will voice what few reservations I have about the prodution.

Although there is no problem with the transfer to 1950's France, the english translation is sparce, it leaves out jokes and wordplays, and taks alot of liberties.  But this is forgivable.

 Vocally Marcello (Roger Lemke) has a thin and unattractive top voice.  He makes up for this by being a very convincing characher with an exrtremely cool stage deportment.

David Hobson as Rudolpho sounds very much like Juan Diego Florez with a piercing Rossinian tone.  He delivers the top notes with great ease.

 David Lemke's huge baritone makes for a excellent Schunard.  Gary Rowley is a hillarious colline, the coat song is, however rushed.

  Cheryl Barker is a good Mimi, a touch spread at the top, but very effective.  Christine Douglas is a wonder Musetta with a generously sized voice.

  Musically this production does not stand out from the pack.  Its value as a production, however, is inestimable.  The acting is on another level and the staging is so intricate.  It is moving to see such involved stage action.  It is a stark contrast to the immovable Pavarotti (Who is undoubtedly a more gifted tenor) who cannot seem to identify with his characters.  Carreras and Stratas, on the met Boheme, compete with this production with their convincing acting, but for this generation Baz Lurhmans Boheme has a more profound impact.  it is a matter of personal taste whether you prefer the sensitive drama of classic Pucinni or baz's in your face realism.  Either way, the updating of Boheme really brings home its importance as a work.  It really works!!!!  This is a must have!",1099094400,,1793,4.8996655518394645

While this visually updated Boheme may not be the most perfectly sung Boheme I've ever heard - it is nonetheless one of the most nearly perfect performances I've ever seen.  Under Baz Luhrmann's guidance Australian Opera has put together a true Boheme that should speak to any age.  Cast with then mostly unknown young singers, the magic of Puccini is given prominence in a way that is not often possible with bigger named stars.

Here also is an urgency here that captures the true youth of these characters and makes these characters jump out in to the drama.  The Act II Caf Momus scene is just about perfect in ensemble and catches the right amount of fire to make the scene genuinely sparkle and pop.

Cheryl Barker gives a unique perspective to Mimi and David Hobson is nothing short of amazing as Rodolfo. The supporting cast and Luhrmann's production team make this a Boheme for the ages.",1095984000,,920,4.648148148148148
1060473,5,6305639426,"Think ""Moulin Rouge"" was the first musical extravaganza that Baz Luhrmann directed? Think again -- he directed the opera ""La Boheme,"" at the world-famous Sydney Opera House. With his usual colorful flair and touching romances, Luhrmann presents Puccini's classic in rare style.

It's Christmas Eve in 1950s Paris, and a bunch of bohemian artists are rooming together in a cramped apartment. It's freezing, so they burn Rudolfo's (David Hobson) play to keep warm. When his pals go out on the town, Rudolfo stays behind for a few minutes -- only to have a beautiful young woman (Cheryl Barker) stumble in, asking for a candle.

Rudolfo and Mimi fall head-over-heels in love with each other, without regard for their poverty -- after all, they share a belief that beauty, love and gentleness is what is important. But Mimi is frail and consumptive (ie, tuberculosis), and her illness threatens to tear the young lovers apart.

Baz Luhrmann clearly knows that a really riveting performance -- be it stage, opera, or movie -- is not just about acting or vocals, but also about the trappings. The singers are the right age, dressed in simple clothes and with a shabby, colorful backdrop of rotating sets behind them. In a way, you can almost forget that it's an opera, and enjoy it just as a performance.

Luhrmann's direction is a mix of humor and romance -- one moment we've got the merry bohemians prancing around, eating baguettes and wine in a bathtub. The next, we have the exquisite scene where Mimi and Rudolfo introduce themselves to one another, and slip out into the darkness hand in hand.

And he keeps his splashes of color, as in his other films -- whether it's a flickering fire, red splashes of paint or a purple bathrobe, he injects color into a lifeless, dark place. Not to mention the time frame change. But aside from bright electric lights and leather jackets, there's barely any reference to the time being the post-war 1950s -- truly timeless.

The cast is not the best, vocally -- they're not bad, but they're not the best either. However, they can act. Very well. Hobson appears to be really weeping at the end, and Barker really does look sick. Moreover, their scenes are not just about singing, but about exuding what appears to be genuine adoration. When it comes to giving emotional (rather than vocal) performances, the cast is perhaps the best there has been.

Baz Luhrmann puts his unique stamp on Puccini's classic opera, filling it with color and emotion. Even people who don't normally like opera may feel a thrill as they watch ""La Boheme.""",1094688000,,2570,4.800904977375565

All singing and acting is close to perfect. The directing is, to say the least, imaginative and well-conceived.
My only beef (which prevents the 5th star) is with the conductor: his tempos repeatedly fail to square with the score, and the orchestra seems woodwind-heavy under his baton.
Buy it? Yes, siree.

1060475,5,6305639426,"I am not a fan of opera at all.  When Rent first came out (a show I deeply love and connect to), I was surprised to discover it was modeled after Puccini's La Boheme.  So, I decided to culture myself and by a CD version of the opera.  I enjoyed it, but again, it was not something I'd play over and over again.  Then the hoopla began with Baz Luhrmann's production of the show coming to Broadway, and I was excited.  Here was an amazing visual director doing an ""updated"" version (set in 1950s Paris, France) of an opera.  I was excited to see it, but unfortunately it closed before I had a chance to make my way to NYC.
Then, I came across this DVD version of his original production performed at the Sydney Opera House.  I bought it just to check it out for myself, and I was blown away by the quality of the show.  Luhrmann moves the story to post-war 1950's Paris, and it works completely.  The main plot of the opera involves the love between Rudolfo and Mimi, who meet one evening when Mimi comes asking for him to light her candle, and the rise of their love, the jealousies, and eventually the downfall.
The production quality of the show is superb, and the design of the whole show is very similar to Moulin Rouge.  Luhrmann even goes so far as putting the ""L'Amour"" sign in his La Boheme into Moulin Rouge.  The color design of the show is very similar as well.  There is ver very ""black and white"" movie quality to the show, and Catherine Martin's costume design throws in the added primary colors making each cast member stand out in their owen individual way.  The set of Marcello and Rudolfo's apartment matchces Christian's apartment in Moulin Rouge as well.
The singers are wonderful, and they sing Puccini's music with such ease and grace it's enough to make anyone jealous of their talent.  Also, much has been said about Luhrmann's casting of age appropriate actors to play the parts.  In my opinion, this is a definate asset to the show. Visually and vocally, Luhrmann's opera is a sight to be seen and heard.
This version of Puccini's opera is perfect for someone justing getting their first exposure to opera.  It totally accessible with the universal plot of love gained and lost, and Puccini's music is superb.",1080691200,,2234,4.506203473945409

A few things I can add to the other 5-star comments:  I defy anyone to get past ""Che gelida manina"" without hitting the back button at least twice.  (8 times for me)  Also, if you have any doubt that David Hobson poured himself completely into his ""Rodolfo"", then check out the extended curtain call at the end.  He never does seem to compose himself.  Totally believable. (Men, you may not want to let your wife see it.  This guy could steal her heart!) And, delightful to see an attractive Mimi (Cheryl Barker)  Though this charachter was sickly, the background history of the book says she was based on an attractive model.  The higher priced Met version features a normally attactive Teresa Stratas' eyes made up to look quite frightening.  Was it a special Halloween edition?  To believe Rodofo could have fallen in love with HER eyes was impossible.  On the contrary, in this version, Barker masterfully balances the combination of ill health and beauty. And, the appropriately youthful cast doesn't short you at all on voice quality.  The other players were consistently excellent, and lovable.  Like the Lyon version of ""Figaro"", a great one to get a friend started on opera.  Bravo!",1080259200,,1240,4.815165876777251

This live performance by the Australian Opera has some new ideas (setting in the 1950's - though the change in year's has negligible effect on the message or even justification for the 100 years jump ahead, addition of peculiar but effective characters in the Act II Cafe Momus scene, Act III unexplainably at the French/Belgian border, etc), but fear not: Lurhmann leaves this Boheme intact.  The singers are all good with David Hobson and Cheryl Barker at the forefront as Rodolfo and Mimi, with radiant voices and looks and acting.  The stage direction seems appropriate although the film director favors close-ups to  stage pictures (this works well because the singing actors are so credible, but it is a touch distracting to watch the sweat role down their faces while they sing of the bitter winter cold...).  Gratefully there is no audience applause after the big showstopper arias so the action is not broken.  The lighting, costumes, group movement, set and use of ramp in front of the orchestra are all effective.  In the end we are left weeping as Mimi dies, even though we know it's coming and have seen it countless times. This is the genius of Puccini and now perhaps as Luhrmann's ""show"" is on Broadway and touring companies across the USA, more people will be caught up in the beauty of opera.",1072915200,,1563,4.879245283018868
1060540,4,6305639426,"Yes, this is one of the most BELIEVABLE Bohemes you can see.  Luhrman's direction is full of great details (just look at how Mimi and Rodolopho listen to each other and play off the words). I loved the end of Act III where Rodolpho playfully throws some snow at Mimi!!  Tthe updated 1950's production works fine, and the acting is superb.  There's not a trace of ""standard opera acting"" (i.e., stand and sing with an occasional stock hand gesture).  The up-close video shots allow (and force) the singers to act with their eyes and faces far more than they could do in a live opera house, where such things would be lost beyond the 10th row.
No, this is not anywhere near the best SUNG Boheme you can find. The Rodolpho and Musetta, particularly, have tight, thin voices, and would have trouble making the finals of the Metropolitan Opera auditions.  I was afraid Rodolpho's voice would give out before his high C's in Act I.
For great voices and great VOCAL ACTING, listen to Callas, DiStefano, Tebaldi, Georghiu, Bergonzi, Bjorling, etc.  (Avoid Bocelli if you want great tenor singing.)
So buy this DVD, for Chrissakes, and get to know what really happens in the opera and WHY they are singing their hearts out.  Then move on to the great singers of the past and present, who are not on this DVD.

1060543,5,6305639426,"La Boheme is one of the fundamental works in any opera lover's collection. It's plot has been called ""saccharine"" by critics who confuse sentiment with cloyishness, but it's score is nonstop lyricism from beginning to end. Anyone who has dry eyes at the end lacks a heart. I have seen it many times, but this performance, in many ways, is like seeing it for the first time.
It is set in Paris in the 1950's rather than in the late 19th century. I believe that the staging is ""minimalist"", but if that is the wrong term, it is certainly unconventional. Yet everything works so well!
The singers are all young, vocally talented and are capable actors. For example, in scenes where the camera does close up work on Mimi and Rodolfo, the singers are totally focused on each other. Neither looks for a prompter or at the conductor.
All of the singers are good, from a vocal perspective. More importantly, they are all believeable in their roles, even when the viewer KNOWS that this is ...opera! Opera which has been referred to as the ultimate in unbelieveability. I  cannot say enough about this aspect of this DVD. There are many versions on CD, some better than others, and at least one other version ( an excellent Met performance with Stratas and Carreras ), yet this performance, with all its departures from tradition, has a youthful intensity that has to be experienced to be understood
The disc quality is excellent. The video is crisp, with no degredation at any time, and the sound has Dolby 5.1 as an option, which makes the immediacy of the performance so compelling. Conductor and orchestra, minor players and principals, stage director and producer combine to provide the viewer with a memorable theatrical experience.
La Boheme is an excellent ""starter"" opera for those who want to learn about it, and this performance is an eye opener for those of us who are perhaps too familiar with it. For those who live in areas where stage performances are nonexistant, the DVD experience can enable the operatic experience as ""next best"" to live.

1060544,4,6305639426,"La Boheme happens to be one of my favorite operas along with La Traviata, Marriage of Figaro, and Pagliacci.  I like Baz Luhrman's production of Puccini's work.  It presents the original themes of the opera in a manner which bridges the gap between traditional theatre and today.  The presentation is also easier for the younger audiences to understand, set in Paris in the 20th century.
  The performances were satisfactory.  Not the most spectacular ever heard, but still very very well done.  Favorite scenes of mine include Musetta's aria in Act 2 and the opening of Act 4 (duet: Rodolfo, Marcello).  I highly recomend this as an introduction to opera for those less knowledgeable.  I highly enjoyed it.
  Now, Moulin Rouge is a completely different story - more like a continuance of the same theme but with lame music.  Listening to a regurgitated 80's love song medley is not my idea of a good musical.  La Boheme is great.  Moulin Rouge - not so much.",1061942400,,959,4.7682926829268295

And I'm glad I did. Because this is one AMAZING film. It is new and fresh. The singers are young and vibrant. I was iffy about the different time setting but I was pleasantly surprised. The set was gorgeous and amazing. Its mobility gave the production many more dimensions and brought a certain intimacy to the audience. The singers are not only beautiful people, but also have amazing voices and gifted actors. I was in tears the first time Mimi said good-bye to Rudofo and bawling by the end.

The songs just pour forth in a spontaneous release of emotion that looks genuine and heartfelt.  The more popular arias at the end of the first act were just stunning.  I was so awe-struck that I had to watch them over and over before I could continue with the rest of the show.
By the end, you'll be in tears.  Even David Hobson (Rodolfo) was crying during the curtain calls, and I don't think it was just from the last scene.  He looked truly overwhelmed with emotion - probably from the opera itself, as well as the exuberant adoration of the audience - and it was really quite touching to behold.

David Hobson(Tenor-Rodolfo) ""sings"" (I use the "" because it appears that he is not actually singing but rather mouthing to someone else) with one of the most nasal and brassy sounding voices I have heard outside the Rossini rep.  Only every once in a while does he seem to line up.  The Mimi of Cheryl Barker is tolerable at best, her high C at the end of the Act 1 duet is pinched and forced.  Christine Douglas as Musetta is probably the best of the cast.  She does an exceptional job of driving the strong voiced Marcello (Roger Lemke) mad with envy.  My only problem with Ms. Douglas is her high B flat at the end of ""Quando men vo"" (she sounds like she's going to die).  I would rather listen to a 72 year old Carlo Bergonzi crack his way through Otello than listen to much of the singing in this production.  The singers sound unpolished, they must only have been chosen for looks rather than vocal technique and abilities.  Give me a tenor who sings well and I will not care what he looks like.  I only wish that Jin Tea Kim, the tenor who plays Parpignol, was Rodolfo.  He has a wonderful voice and hopefully we will hear more things from him in years to come.  If I were anyone who loves this music I would look at either the Carreras or Pavarotti DVD's of this opera, even the Ramondi/Freni movie is better sung.  As far as I see it the only redeming qualities of this DVD are the sets and costumes.

By using his logic, he'd better use his ""trained ear"" to hear Hobson singing, in person, in opera house, sans microphone, before making any comments about his voice. It is also very rude to make judgment by saying that Hobson is lip-synching to a recording without reliable evidence. Hobson, who has sung more than twenty leading opera roles in opera house (without being ""swallowed up in an opera house and buried by an orchestra""), does what everybody else is doing in the business, which is singing without amplification.
Many opera purists like to cling to voices that are familiar to their ears, which is understandable. But please be a little open-minded! To praise ""great voice"" of Hobson's doesn't mean to belittle others. Domingo is great, and so are many other tenors. But if tenors on the opera stage all sounded like Domingo, it'd be a very boring world, and opera wouldn't be very far from losing its appealing and vitality.
Opera, as a comprehensive art of staging, singing, acting, orchestrating, isn't just about voices. That's why this production La Boheme deserves a very solid five-star.",1046736000,,1304,4.904977375565611

But those who remark on Hobson's ""great voice"" should be aware that the singers were either heavily miked or lip-synching to a recording.  To the trained ear, Hobson has a tiny, light ""tenorino"" voice that without amplification would be swallowed up in an opera house and buried by an orchestra.  No voice can be judged until it is heard in person, sans microphones.  Any good tenor can sound as powerful as Domingo or Heppner with plenty of amplification.

1060619,4,6305639426,"This production of Boheme has prompted a great deal of ink to be spilled, much of it focused on how unique it is.  To me it is very good, but hardly unique.  It resembles a good production by one of the regional companies in the U.S.  It has young singers who sing their roles most satisfactorily. The staging (scenery and action) is OK, but its primary distinction is that is does not distract from the music.  Ditto the orchestra.  I think that anyone who views this Boheme will enjoy and even love it, but to claim that it represents a breakthrough is overreaching.
Much has been said about how this production uses young, photogenic players who more closely resemble what the protagonists are than the ""typical"" opera singer.  This is a red herring.  Yes, Cheryl Barker is a beautiful and sexy Mimi, but is she more compelling in the role than Teresa Stratas or Mirella Freni?  Not likely.  The same argument can be applied role-by-role to this DVD versus the others on the market.  This fantasy of the typical opera as being peopled by old and fat singers who can't move on stage is simply not today's reality.  Yes, this opera has compelling actors-singers; but guess what -- they all do!

In this production, whether or not the singings are perfect takes second place in the face of vitality, passion, and intensity brought out by the brilliant young cast.

Bravo, David Hobson for giving such a wonderful wonderful Rodolfo. This is the Rodolfo you'll be dreaming of. He is handsome, he is tall, and his tenor rings out with beauty, clarity, and youthfulness. To make things even better, he acts brilliantly. He gives life to every note he sings. When he belts out a high C, it's not a matter of showing off his tenor, but a real emotional outpouring. Seldom did I see vocalist acting with such depth and sincerity. He put himself so deep into the character that at the curtain calls he is still in tears.

Brava, Cheryl Barker for conveying a tender and lovely Mimi. At some places Cheryl Barker's voice is not at her best in portraying Mimi, but her acting makes up the weakness, and in the end, she has become real Mimi. Her highlight is Mimi's death scene. Of all the times I have watched this scene, not a single time was I not in tears. She and David Hobson make a very good match, between them the chemistry is convincing, which makes their parting all the more heartbreaking.

Bravo, Baz Luhrmann for the creativity and courage of blazing new trails for classical opera, and for the raw artistic design. Instead of making a clich of yet another production of classical opera, he has turned it into a great piece of modern theater, in which the essence is embodied with realism and bestowed with novelties.

What an unbelievable work by Puccini: surely the opening theme must be one of the greatest melodies of all time. It moves me near to tears: To think anyone could imagine music this beautiful and be able to write it down for others to hear for time eternal.

The scene is Paris 1957. The 2 main actors are young and handsome: someone you could really believe to be falling in love. But the best parts are the acting qualities of the singers and what voices!!!!
In particular, David Hobson as Rodolfo: his rendition of ""che gelida manina"" will make the hair on the back of the neck stand up and salute! When done well, it must be one of a handful of great tenor arias in all of opera.
Cheryl Baker does an excellent job as Mimi. A great voice and her death scene in the end is very moving.

This production done by the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra is a fine example of an excellent use of people and resources. Filmed before a live audience (really the only way great opera should be recorded) we actually see stagehands moving the sets, and yet they do not distract from the magic that is happening but instead are part of the drama unfolding before you.

The only unrealistic part of the entire performance was the audience: Silent, except for an occasional cough, they sat on their hands if they were watching paint dry. Did they not see the unbelievable performances that were unfolding before them? I mean, is that not the purpose of live theatre??: Audience reaction to great performances: If I had been an actor on that stage I would have been so disappointed: wondering what we were doing wrong.

1060676,5,6305639426,"When I watched Luhrmann's more recent film, Moulin Rouge, it was fun to recognize the large ""L'Amour"" sign from Act I of this opera production.
I've used this version of Boheme to introduce friends to opera. It's a very entertaining production, and looks great on DVD. There are occsional minor lip-synch problems but not enough to be truly distracting.
The DVD has the bonus of removable English subtitles so both opera fans and newcomers to the work can get maximum enjoyment from the disc.",1008374400,,492,4.869047619047619
1060677,3,6305639426,"This is an interesting update of the most popular opera currently in the world (except for maybe ""Figaro"") and an excellent choice for young people or those new to opera.  I have the LD and enjoy it but prefer the traditional treatment of Zeffirelli's Met production with Stratas and Jose Carraras (prior to becoming ill).  It is adequately sung and acted with young singers who will never be international stars.  Charming and worthy of adding to a collection.  There are just others that I prefer.  This opera is so beautiful that you can't have enough versions of it.",995587200,,570,4.775510204081633
1060678,3,6305639426,"As a DVD, I found this disc a great disappointment both sonically and visually.  This is particularly sad as the Sydney production obviously had something special that deserved a descent recording and presentation.  The picture is often soft with poor blacks.  Voices are aggressive at the top and need taming whilst the orchestra has little stereo space.  It may have been partially due to the original TV recording but after Image Entertainment's ham-fisted effort with Parsifal one doubts their commitment to quality mastering.  I have recently seen the Glyndebourne Touring Opera perform a modern interpretation of Boheme, which I thought in many ways surpassed the Sydney production.  Considering the quality of Glyndebourne DVDs, eg Le Nozze di Figaro, my recommendation would be to pass on the Sydney Boheme and wait for Glyndebourne",974592000,,840,5.325757575757576

Using post-war privations of 1950s Paris as a convincing setting and capturing - above all else - the  youthfulness and intensity of the story with a raw sincerity. Handsome  David Hobson as Rodolfo, and beautiful Julian Smith as Mimi, are just  wonderful. I have all three La Boheme DVD versions (Carreras and Pavarotti,  being the other two), but this by far is my favorite!",948672000,,475,4.974683544303797

While there are no superstar voices here, the principles are all MORE than capable.  The acting is superb and VERY believable.  My reason for not giving it a 5th star is because the audio / video production is very much to 1993 standards.  Still, very much worth the investment.",1514246400,,432,4.783783783783784
