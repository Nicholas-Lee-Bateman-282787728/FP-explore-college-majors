8085183,4,B000BCJ4VI,Very basic but also informative and quite helpful in the learning how to work with myofascial tissue. Go ahead and get the others in the set. You'll want all of them.,1321747200,,166,4.387096774193548

Don't all therapists hear this every day of their careers? But how many of us can provide a short, clear, easy to understand explanation? Beginning Myofascial Release not only does that but offers a wealth of information and suddenly all these things we learned in our anatomy lessons start making sense. When doing deep work we are told to ""do a few nice strokes first"" and ""do not forget to stretch"". Instead of doing it mechanically as a part of a sequence, after watching this DVD, all pieces fell back to place and I can freely integrate myofascial work in my massages.

Un the beginning of the video Sean Riehl introduces himself and begins by pointing out several important theoretical points. He takes his time explaining the structure of soft tissues and pays special attention to the structure and properties of the fascia. A very important point he makes is about the speed and force involved in the work. It is very different from deep tissue massage as all done with very light pressure - there is an extensive section on why this is so fundamentally important.

Next, release techniques are shown and discussed and they include skin rolling, cross-handed stretches, arm/leg pulls and transverse diaphragm releases. Evaluation of tissues and recognizing the places where the fascia is stuck or restricted are also commented on in lenght, followed by a short demonstration. Treatment of scars is the next topic covered, with the related specific techniques.

In the next portion of the video Sean Riehl explains how fascia restrictions in one area of the body can learn to distortions elsewhere as well and how to correct them. The leg and arm pulls are shown with pointers how to test the fascia for restrictions. Then several fascia lines are explained and also the best way to approach and treat them.

Total run time is about 75 minutes and it's packed full with information. Unfortunately, despite its paramount importance, myofascial work isn't covered very well in schools and the only way to learn it is through continuous education. While it can't replace a real workshop, it's a great way to learn the basics for a fraction of the price. It's packed with very useful information, Seal Riehl is a great teacher who is easy to understand and follow.  I feel that the $40 I spent on this DVD are a priceless investment.

Even though I'm not confident to add ""myofascial release"" to ""what I do"" on my business card, I'm able to integrate it in my bodywork and I've found it to be extremely effective paired with deep tissue massage. As light touch is the key to myofascial work, tissues cannot be damaged and in the worst possible scenario you will just waste the time of your client. Unlike some other DVDs where a more forceful approach is necessary, I felt pretty safe to test any of the techniques suggested in this DVD. I was very pleased with the results.

I also recommend purchasing the Advanced Myofascial Release as it complements the first video and allows for more savings.",1230940800,13,3119,4.752310536044362
8085186,5,B000BCJ4VI,"If you want to learn myofascial release- I highly recommend this DVD. It covers alot of ground, and I found that I was able to apply the technques immediately into my practice. The filming is clear and there are alot of great graphics that help to make the information easy to understand. Some programs that I have watched have hours of explanation and just a little technque- this is not that way, Mr. Riehl explains the rationale concisely, and then shows the technques- so it never gets boring. This DVD along with Advanced Myofascial Release make a great set.",1136764800,26,563,4.696969696969697
8085187,5,B000BCJ4VI,"I have taken a few classes on myofascial release, and this video plus the advanced one were more complete than both the classes that I attended, and really help to clarify how to apply this work to my clients. This video is well filmed, and doesn't get boring to watch- unlike many massage videoes.",1113091200,,298,4.537037037037037
8085188,5,B000BCJ4VI,"I found the information in this video to be presented in a very clear manner. Riehl seperates each technique into an individual lesson, including great computer graphics and descriptions to enhance learning. I have been practicing Myofascial Release for one year now, and Riehl's tape accurately describes the technique, and offers extra insight. This video really is the best one I have seen on Myofascial Release- it kept my interest as I watched it and really enhanced my practice.",1077580800,4,484,5.139240506329114
8085189,2,B000BCJ4VI,"I was very disappointed in this video and Riehl's follow-up video. I don't know what irked me more: the new age mumbo-jumbo music at the start of the videos, Riehl's mispronunciation of fascia, or the mispelling and mispronuciation of plantar fasciitis. One of the misconceptions of this video is that there are specific techniques for different conditions. This is a very wrong thought. Myofascial release is very clinician and patient dependent. In other words, two clinicians could treat the same patient in totally different ways; likewise the same physician could treat two patients with the same problem differently. Myofascial release therapy has two components: the treatment of muscle (myo) and fascia (fascial). Riehl stresses the theory of fascial therapy which is very controversial even among osteopaths. By doing this, Riehl gives this therapy a more ""new age"" spin. Myofascial release involves treatment in three planes: compression, traction and twist. Riehl's technique involves only stretch. If you're a physician don't waste your money and if you're medical student you'll fail your boards if you rely on this video!",1073088000,17,1135,5.418079096045198
8085190,5,B000BCJ4VI,"This video is great! The graphics are wonderful and the techniques are clearly filmed and easy to follow. I have both videos- Beginning and Advanced, and together they really give full coverage of Myofascial techniques. This is important information that will help any proffesional massage therapist who wants to work with postural distortions and injuries in a gentle and skilled way.",1012867200,10,385,5.327868852459017
