8022322,1,B000255LFM,this movie sucked big time. i thought it was the stage play and it was an immature movie about 3 virgin males trying to lose their virginity. i would rather watch the growth of a bean before i would ever watch this movie again. the storyline was not funny nor the different situations they placed themselves in. this movie should not be seen by anyone under the age of 16.,1282262400,,372,4.328571428571428

8022326,1,B000255LFM,"Sweet Potato Pie is an exact clone of American Pie, down to the sex scene with a pie. The movie is less funny than Pie and it's not as riske. Every scene has rap music, even if it adds nothing too the scene. Sweet Potato had potential, but ends up being a lame wannabe.",1090972800,11,269,4.0
