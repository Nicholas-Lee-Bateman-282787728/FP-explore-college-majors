8308247,2,B001H9IPBE,"Newt Gingrich promotes a wide variety of energy sources in this film.  The linkages between energy security and national security are clear and the U.S. has learned hard lessons about being dependent on oil imports.  Gingrich does a public service by raising this topic again.
The film's shortfall is that it misses the potential of North American uranium and thorium to provide about 80% or even 90% of our total energy use.  Even though the safety and cost advantages of Generation IV reactor designs are cited in Gingrich's ""Drill Here!"" book (pp. 50-51), and Pebble Bed Modular Reactors (PBMRs) are mentioned in an earlier book, these advanced technologies weren't a major focus of this film.  For a nuclear engineer's summary of US and EU energy independence, including the more efficient use of fossil fuels and selective use of renewables, see Dr. Jeff Eerkens book ""The Nuclear Imperative:  A Critical Look at the Approaching Energy Crisis"" (2010).  Retail copies are pricey for Eerkens' books, however, it can be viewed for free at various universities.",1437264000,,1062,5.109826589595376
8308248,1,B001H9IPBE,"I found this documentary to be awful. The only justification I can give for its one star is promoting the use of hybrids and electric cars. The ethnocentrism and hate directed towards foreigners and ""extreme environmental groups"" was radical and inappropriate and majority of the statements and facts were questionable. It is said there is absolutely no reason why we shouldn't go full board in the U.S. with nuclear energy, however obviously there must be reasons otherwise America would have already.",1420588800,,502,5.209876543209877
8308249,5,B001H9IPBE,"Here's The Argument:
Americans are being stymied by the religion of environmentalists.
Congress is beholden to the votes of the environmentalists (I would guess mainly the Democrats and those Democrats disguised as Republicans).
Therefore, for decades now, Americans have been hindered majorily (in the courts, in bureucratic red tape, in Congress) from developing their own energy-rich resources and becoming independent of countries that are hostile to us.
What is at stake here is not only energy independence but our national security, because we are becoming poorer economically not only because we pay more at the pump for our gas, but because we send millions of dollars a day to unfriendly regimes instead of providing for jobs here at home and paying less for our energy costs, which money could be used by Americans to buy commodities at home.
These hostile regimes such as Iran are, as we know, pursuing nuclear warheads.
The solution: Government needs an overhaul, expensive and needless litigation needs to be stopped, and the overburdensome regulations need to be swept away.

Unfortunately, at the time the film was made, there was still a lot of trust that CO2 was a greenhouse gas that is driving global warming.  The film assumes the premise that CO2 is driving up the temperatures.  I would recommend two very good DVDs: The Great Global Warming Swindle and Global Warming or Global Governance which present good scientific information to counter the misinformation about CO2.  For example, among other strong evidences,  they show that CO2 is not correlated to the  earth's warming, the sun's activities are.  They bring in experts to explain this including leading climatologists and those who have contributed to IPCC reports but which now disavow the political shenanigans at the IPCC, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.",1330214400,4,1858,5.235690235690235
8308250,5,B001H9IPBE,I wish everyone could see this. We have the ability to become energy independant. Why do the liberals want to prevent that. Their real agenda is World Socialism and that's why all their legislation is geared toward destroying this country. Newt should be the next president.,1322352000,,274,4.978260869565218
8308251,5,B001H9IPBE,"This is an excellent and ground-breaking documentary produced by Citizens United.
It explains that America needs to be energy independent instead of relying on foreigners who are soaking us.
This documentary also gives a summary of the many different energy solutions that our nation can use to be energy independent.
Film shares about other fascinating, efficient energy solutions that are still being researched.
We can reduce the price of our utilities and provide jobs to Americans if we will only become energy independent.
This documentary is a MUST SEE for every American to watch.",1317945600,3,588,5.26595744680851

8308253,5,B001H9IPBE,"This title was released on Oct 8th by Citizens United.

Why does Amazon not release it until Election Day (!), thereby making it too late to take this movie into account with respect to the upcoming election?

Is that exactly why? Have Amazon been ""Blocked"" like ""The Path to 9/11"" was?",1224201600,6,286,4.588235294117647
