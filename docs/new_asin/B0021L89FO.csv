8349085,1,B0021L89FO,"As a martial artist with a background in kenpo, krav maga and escrima, I have recently begun studying the use of a cane as a weapon, and to do that I have purchased several different instructors instructional DVDs from Michael Janich, Kelly Worden and Charles Davis.  Of these 3, Davis' was fair but no great, while Janich and Worden did a great job. So as I continue my search for more ideas and training materials I came across this DVD (which did not have any reviews) and decided to take a chance on it.

If you were to research Ted Gambordella, you'd find a wealth of information on him on the internet, plus many accolades for writing a lot of books on different aspects of martial arts, being a speaker and a great martial artist, which would lead you to believe that he would probably make a decent DVD on use of the cane - and you would be wrong.

The DVD is separated into 2 sections, beginner and advanced; however, it really feels like Bad and Worse.  The beginner section is aptly named because it is simply a recording of Gambordella teaching cane to a kids' class.  Now, I find this wrong on so many levels it is hard to know where to begin.  First, the camera is unmanned, so it never moves, despite much of the action taking place in locations and angles where it is hard to see what is going on - would have been better to have had a wider angle of more of the class.  The next issue is that simply taping a class you are teaching is not a basis for putting out a DVD that you claim will teach people how to use a weapon of any sort.  If you watch the other 3 instructors' DVD's they spend time talking to the viewer about the cane, how it is used in general, why you use it, essentially explaining a lot of points that Gambordella either isn't aware of or doesn't feel needs explanation.

Even worse is the fact that he is teaching these techniques to children.  Yes, I agree that kids should have an understanding of weapons, and can be taught these things under certain circumstances, but the way Gambordella does it is just flat wrong.  First, he fails to explain on camera to the kids, and the viewer, that a cane is a very deadly weapon when used correctly, and that when working with partners for practice it should be used very carefully.  Instead, he just seems to jump into teaching kids who seem to have no experience at all with a cane, which could easily have led to someone getting hurt.  And if that is not bad enough, this so-called expert, is teaching kids, and the viewers, that they should use a potentially deadly weapon on a person when attacked with something as simple as a kick or punch.  There is no explanation about the fact that deadly forced used against non-deadly force could easily get the defender into serious legal trouble, and that you should think before using such force. He never even seems to mention the fact that using a cane to strike or attack the throat could easily lead to the person being killed.  Finally, the instruction itself about the use of the cane is poor at best.  He teaches in a stream of consciousness method, just teaching whatever comes to his mind, and that is no way to teach the use of a weapon, especially when you are teaching something to people who lack experience.  He fails to address the most basic and simple uses of the cane, opting instead for more complicated methods which always require the use of the crook (which he never refers to with the proper terminology - instead calling it the hook), which will require the cane user to be extremely proficient in its use before those techniques would ever be possible.

The next section is labeled as advanced, but again is nothing of the sort.  This section was filmed in someone's living room, with a partner who looks like he would prefer to be anywhere else but working with Gambordella.  Once again, there is no real explanation about the use of the cane as a defensive or offensive weapon, just Gambordella wielding it in a haphazard and entirely unrehearsed manner - apparently just making it up as he goes - and it shows.  Both his unenthusiastic assistant's attitude and demeanor along with Gambordella's apparent lack of skill in teaching or using the cane make this section extremely cringe-worthy to watch.

The bottom line is that this DVD is a waste of time, and will likely teach you nothing, whether you are a beginner or advanced student using a cane.  Take my advice and do not buy it, and spend your hard earned money on something from Janich (whose cane DVD is the best I have seen so far), Worden's, or Davis' - all of those will teach you great practical skills and use of the cane in short order.",1382054400,13,4659,4.461719670200235
