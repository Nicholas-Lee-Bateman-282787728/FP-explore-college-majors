7001684,2,B00T6NP2BE,"Love Randy from QAF, but this movie is about as dull and boring as knife blades sitting in grandma's kitchen, unused since Buddha was around.

What a disappointment and embarrassment for the actors and script writers. Save your precious hours on the planet and DON'T rent or buy this flick, no matter how good you think these people are.",1460332800,,337,4.711864406779661

7001692,3,B00T6NP2BE,"This film was okay, at best.  As much as I love a good screwball comedy, SGP was just a bit too silly for me.  Kudos to Richard and Alex for wanting to donate the money to a good cause, but to schlep it around L.A. while it was still inside the shop vac???  A pretty weak attempt to get a quick laugh.  The chemistry between the two main characters was very good, but there were too many stereotypical supporting characters...such as the conniving sister and her dorky husband; the tough-talking female detective; etc.  Overall, a somewhat cute, inoffensive film with a warm, but completely predictable ending.",1447718400,,610,4.716981132075472

7001694,1,B00T6NP2BE,"This was an enjoyable romp about the trials that come from unexpected windfalls.  Add a bit of deceit, murder, and selfishness and you have the story line of this film.

7001698,3,B00T6NP2BE,I had such high hopes for this film.  I really like both the actors who play the main characters!  Michael Uriel has wonderful range and I was so glad to see Randy Harrison back on screen.  But ultimately their acting ability couldn't make up for the lousy writing.  The story did have a great start but slowly spun into incoherence and stupidity. Let's see Michael and Randy in a Josh Lanyon story where they can show a full range of their acting ability in a plot worthy of their choos!,1444521600,,488,4.388888888888889
7001699,5,B00T6NP2BE,"A quirky, indie dramady, with the dash of screwball, and some fantastic actors - this is the film. It was a great compilation of elements, what more could you want? I really enjoyed it. Also, the soundtrack to the film is very sassy. Loads of fun overall!",1443484800,2,255,4.446808510638298

7001701,1,B00T6NP2BE,"Where to start. A terrible screen play. Trite, predicable dialog. I could almost tell you the next line and the next shot before the actors did them.

Harrison is getting a little old to continue the little slightly naive blond boy. His face has aged. He and a couple of others appear to be sleepwalking through this Did they do it just for the money?  None of the actors is really interesting. But with the script and the direction it's not all their fault.

7001710,1,B00T6NP2BE,HORRIBLE!  Just an absolute waste of money - I couldn't even finish the movie!  How can two actors I've loved in other movies/series be expected to save this terrible script??!!  Maybe someone thought that if they did a movie that was 'Sharknado bad' that it might be thought of as good?  I dunno.  Save your money.

It could have been such a better movie with the storyline enhanced and better acting. Personally I like Michael Urie, LOVE Randy Harrison, love the Ugly Betty cast as half of them were in the movie. I almost expected a cameo from Vanessa Williams. Drew Droege (Eating Out: Drama Camp) was only in the movie for a few minutes at the end. Lance Bass served as non humorous and not really a necessary role. Although he does look buff in this movie. That chest!  Go ahead and rent it or buy it or see it.

There are several  characters who give such 'queenie' performances it is embarrassing to have to  watch.  One male  character ,near the finale, was so effeminate that I cringed  when I saw him on screen. The two male leads  may be good looking but their  performances are bland.

7001741,1,B00T6NP2BE,"Just stopped watching ""Such Good People"" released by Breaking Glass Pictures.
It's extremely rare that I will stop watching a movie when I get to the mid-way point, but ""Such Good People"" is one of the movies that makes anyone who is watching it question their judgement in not hitting the eject button on the remote after the first ten minutes have elapsed..
When ""Such Good People"" arrived in my mailbox, I had such high hopes for it.  It seemed like a classical comedy in the vien of ""For Pete's Sake.""  Sigh, it wasn't meant to be.  For a comedy to work, it must have likeable characters who have goals you can relate to.  Sadly, not in this movie since no one is likeable.
Which is a shame because all the elements for a really great comedy movie are present, just not accounted for.  We have a couple who is house-sitting for their new friends, when they discover a secret room that has nearly a cool milllion stashed away.  The homeowners are killed in a freak rickshaw accident in Bhutan whle aiding orphans and naturally our young couple are heading down the road to hell because they have such good intentions in wanting to do the right thing with all that money that surely nobody will miss.
Yes, greed can be funny, but when everyone is so self-centered they become unsympatheic, it's not funny anymore.
STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED!

7001749,3,B00T6NP2BE,"This could have been a welcome screwball comedy for folks hungering for that type of material, but even in screwball, there has to be a foot planted somewhere in reality. There are not many situations or characters here than ring true. Also, the folks involved should not behave as though they know they are doing comedy, and this is the worst part about this movie: it suffers from an acute attack of all things cutesy. The cast has been encouraged to be constantly over the top when restraint would have been more effective. (In the 1964 Pink Panther only Sellers is doing prat falls; the rest of the cast act with a perfectly straight face.)

A pity, because this wide screen independent film does not suffer from the usual lack of production values - every penny is onscreen. Bottom line is more time should have been spent on script development and in having the care to hire a director with a light touch and not a sledge hammer.

The DVD is presented in a gorgeous 2:35 wide screen format, and comes with a plethora of Extras.",1429660800,2,1033,4.548387096774194

  I had expected, with Michael Urie is starring, it would be a movie with him playing that over-the -top, snotty character he always plays. Not that I object to it, it's that I thought that a whole movie of that, after having seen him do it so often, might be  be a bit much. Boy, was I wrong ! The character he plays is just your ordinary Joe, married and making his way through life. This is a bit of a caper comedy. Urie's character and his partner are lusting after what they think of as their dream home when suddenly, it becomes available because the owner is planning a religious retreat in Asia ( or is that REALLY why he's leaving the country?). He needs someone to house sit. The owner and his wife taking a preference for the gay couple who has been forced to compete with Urie's partner's obnoxious sister and her husband for the privilege of house sitting. Things take a strange turn when the house's owner is mysteriously murdered in Asia, followed by a rumor there is hidden treasure somewhere in the house that many are interested in.

But it seemed to drag a lot and make the serious parts just quite not fitting in with the rest of the movie.  It was jumbled and the twists and turns weren't twisty or turny enough.

They attend a party where a straight couple asks them to house sit while the carry on the charity work in Bhutan. The couple perishes in Bhutan and well the hijinks happen from there. There are a few good laughs when worlds collide over the money the late couple had along with other items. As I said Randy and Michael are the cutest couple ever and they are at odds with how to handle this dilemma. Silly fun but fin nonetheless. You will have a smile on your face.

8700629,4,B00T6NP2BE,"I'm not sure why this film has gotten so many negative reviews.  I mean, what do people expect?  It's a B flick.  I'll be honest, I only picked it up because the teenager in me was excited to see Randy Harrison in a new film.  Obviously the movie isn't going to win any awards, but it doesn't have to.  It's funny enough that I laughed out loud at a couple parts.  It's well acted, being that it's a goofball comedy which isn't supposed to be taken seriously.  The four main characters react really well off one another.  Randy Harrison and Michael Urie are awesome together, despite the fact that they're both very stereotypically ""gay"" in this film.  They're adorable.  And funny.  So if you're looking for a cute, light-hearted, fluffy film to watch one night, give it a shot.  I liked it quite a bit.

Note: I'm pretty sure Randy Harrison doesn't age.  He looks just as young and cute as he did during his QAF days.  Such a doll.",1468281600,,933,4.405882352941177
