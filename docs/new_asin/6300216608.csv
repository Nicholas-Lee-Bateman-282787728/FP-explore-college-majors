One of the finer movies of its era, Bang the Drum Slowly is the story of a big-league pitcher, superbly played by Michael Moriarty, and his roommate, a catcher dieing from Hodgkin's disease played by a young Robert DeNiro in a wonderful performance that will come as a surprise to many used to the, by now familiar, DeNiro persona.  Here he is a dumb-as-dirt, but amiable Georgia farm boy and he is absolutely believable in the role.
A touching story told with great humor, I think it one of the best baseball movies made, though it really isn't about baseball.  This is the 70's, before super star salaries and temperaments have forever changed the game, when Managers were still King and the top salary of an ace pitcher was 100K.  The film is told at a leisurely pace, 70's style,  somewhat episodically, which will put some off.
Quite frankly I loved the sidetrips and distractions, because it allows a great cast to all have their moments.  Vincent Gardenia as Dutch, the prototypical big league Manager ""Never mind the facts, give me details"" a cigarette forever planted on his lower lip, ashes dripping down his chest; Phil Foster hooking unsuspecting fans to play TEGWAR (The Exciting Game Without Any Rules)with himself & Arthur; Patick McVey as the father; Marshall Ephron as the weasely Bradley; the scheming Ann Wedgewood:  Selma Diamond, Danny Aiello and others.
The story is narrated by Moriarty, and that narration and much of the dialogue is done in beautifully articulate mangled English.  It feels lived-in. The story is told with an odd mixture of dead-pan delivery that is unsentimental and yet is very touching in the last analysis.  Bittersweet.
Although they avoid the big emotional ""moment"", the film builds its emotions slowly and carefully, and when it is done if you haven't been moved by this funny/sad story, well....too bad for you.  Well worth your time, for some laughs, some tears, an insight or two and some sterling performances by Michael Moriarty and Robert DeNiro who hit all the right notes.
""I don't know why you don't live it up all the time when dieing's just around the corner, but you don't.  You'd think you would, but you don't.""  4-1/2 Stars all the way.",1055721600,38,2353,4.797029702970297
291923,4,6300216608,"In the Mark Harris novel (which I suggest you read before watching the movie) Henry Wiggen, the narrator, often says to himself ""Lay it on thin, boys.""  He fears that Bruce, the terminally ill catcher, may suspect false sentiment if his teammates treat him too well, as he has been the butt of their jokes in the past.  Bang the drum ""slowly"" suggests only a modicum of fanfare, and that is exactly what makes this film great.
Against the backdrop of Big League baseball, the viewer is given only small glimpses of DeNiro's character's pain.  Too many films dealing with death as the major theme pour it on heavy.  Who wants to sit and cry for an hour and a half, for God's sake?  What's the point in that? It's as much what you DON'T see that gives the film its depth, and that is, in itself, a breath of rarefied cinematic air.
Excellent performances abound here.  The young DeNiro is nearly perfect as the slow - witted yet big - hearted country boy.  Moriarty shines as Henry Wiggen, the big time pitcher, card hustler, insurance salesman, author and ultimately big brother to the doomed catcher.  Vincent Gardenia is just plain hilarious as the manager of the fictional New York Mammoths, a team loaded with talent, yet fraught with eccentric players and inner turmoil.
What begins as a secret (Bruce, the catcher's, illness) is ultimately leaked to the other members of the team, and in the end, he unknowingly pulls them together.
Moriarty and DeNiro ""lay it on thin,"" each giving subtle, yet dead on performances.  Watching the friendship of the two characters grow is one of many things that makes Bang the Drum Slowly a special film.  Your heart will not be torn out at every turn.  On the contrary - there are more comic scenes than dramatic ones.  But this mixture works amazingly well, and for that reason you'll remember this film, and the narrator's final words, for a long time.
""He wasn't a bad fellow.  No worse than most and probably better than some.""
Simple as that.  ""Lay it on thin.""",990662400,66,2006,4.629943502824859
291924,4,6300216608,"Bang the Drum Slowly is quite possibly the best baseball film ever.  It rivals Sayles' 8 Men Out and Field Of Dreams and stands alone as a very complex and emotional portrayal of a sick man playing out his dream.  Robert DeNiro plays a somewhat reserved character in comparison to his  Scorsese roles, and succeeds alongside Michael Moriarity in relaying the  deft emotion constructed between the two baseball players.  Sports films  are always either horrible or excellent (Celtic Pride and Bad News Bears  respectively) and this film is far beyond any rote definition of  excellency.

291967,5,6300216608,"By far, this movie is the best ever made about baseball.  This version and the earlier version (with Paul Newman) is a fantastic story even if one know nothing of baseball.

Imagine today if a Major League pitcher comes to the front office and states; instead of 20 million, I'll take 10 if my catcher stays with me wherever I go.  The pitcher in the movie discovers that his catcher is going to be sent down to the minors.  He knows the catcher has terminal cancer and makes a significant sacrifice for a fellow human being to stay with him in the Majors. The pitcher throughout the movie shows how much good can become of a person dedicated to human values and his fellow man.  The movie also shows how unfair life is and how evil people attempt to take advantage of others who are in dire need.

Could this happen today?  Gil Meche, a pitcher for the Royals, gave up 12 million because he said he didn't deserve it.  He was a good relief pitcher with his bad shoulder, but he felt an ethical obligation to receive a reduction in pay.  The players union wouldn't let him play for less so he retired.  Could the Royals have made it to the last two world series without this capital to invest; of course not.

Every baseball fan and Robert de Niro fan (I think this was his best performance) needs to watch the film.  In fact, it is time for a new version. They need to have a Oscars for forgotten movies.

You will notice that Moriarty throws right-handed so, obviously, there was no reference to the original left handed Henry.

292059,4,6300216608,"Memorable films usually stick with us best if they have memorable characters and good acting melded together with an endearing or captivating story and a musical score that pushes your emotions all into the same emotional pot.  We enjoy watching films decades later because those elements were blended just right to strike a chord in our minds and/or our hearts.  ""Bridge on the River Kwai,""  ""Lilies in the Field,"" ""The Good, the Bad & the Ugly,"" ""Rocky,"" ""American Graffitti,"" ""The Way We Were,""  ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" ""Dr. Zhivago,""  ""ET,""  ""Hoosiers,"" ""Animal House,""  ""Bull Durham,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""Dan in Real Life"" -- all were able to do that well and we will continue to enjoy watching them years and years later and reminisce about the feelings they still bring out in us.

Well, ""Bang the Drum Slowly"" may not be a classic like most of the others just mentioned, but it certainly hits the same beautiful rhythm with all those components and still hits a home run with our hearts.  Robert DeNiro's character Bruce Pearson finds out he has a terminal disease and Michael Moriarty sticks by the simple minded catcher in a bond that drives home the true meaning of empathy.  A young DeNiro plays his country boy with a perfect blend of humility and genuiness.  Moriarty's Henry Wiggins protects Pearson's short time left with dogged determination and growing realization of what's really important in life -- relationships.

With Stephen Lawrence's beautiful musical score, Moriarty's caring voice narration pull on our emotions like ""Brian's Song"" did.  Add in some great little characters -- especially the coach, played splendidly by Vincent Gardenia -- and the tease of just how long can they keep Pearson's terminal condition a secret and you have one entertaining, memorable movie -- whether you like baseball or not.  This one's all about the people, the hands their dealt, both good and bad, and how they react in the face of tragedy.

Again, maybe not worthy of an all-time classic, but, it certainly touches all the bases when it comes to our hearts and minds and what's really important -- treating others with decency and living each day as if it could be your last.  Forty some years later, it still ""gets me"" in a good spot.",1400284800,7,2260,4.87696335078534

292061,4,6300216608,"BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY is a baseball movie (adapted from a 1950s live TV drama) that's actually about friendship, life and its end. Based on Mark Harris's novel, it was partly filmed at Yankee and Shea stadiums. Vincent Gardenia (as manager Dutch Schnell) received a Best Supporting Oscar nod. Danny Aiello's minor role (as 'Horse') marked his first big screen credit.

The story concerns roommates Henry 'Author' Wiggen (a pitcher) and Bruce Pearson (his catcher). They're intellectual opposites-- Henry's sharp-mind is in total contrast to dimwit Bruce, who often gets ribbed by other New York players.

Bruce discovers during the off-season that he's terminally ill. Another obstacle is catcher Piney Woods (Ligon), a young yahoo up from the minors who's after the always-marginal Bruce's job. Dutch's plans to trade Bruce are disrupted by Henry-- the star pitcher (the only man who knows about Bruce's illness) demands to be traded to wherever the catcher is going, so instead Piney gets sent back down to the minors.

Henry has a typically great season and surprisingly so does Bruce-- the best of his career, in fact. Eventually, the entire team learns of his battle with Hodgkin's disease and everyone pulls together. As their standings in the league rise however, Bruce clearly is in decline.

Robert DeNiro gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as a simple yet heroic man facing life's ultimate challenge. Michael Moriarty is equally excellent in his top-billed role as DeNiro's best friend.

I ran out and rented it and loved DeNiro in this film.  I believe it was one of his very first movies and he is great in it.  However, what nobody mentions in the reviews is that this movie was made in the 70's and the portrayal looks dated, not very true to the time it is supposed to be portraying.  Also, in my mind it has a fatal flaw.  The SOUTHPAW is played by someone who is not only the most non-athletic person I've seen, but a RIGHT - HANDER.  I have a hard time imagining that for a baseball movie, where this stuff matters, they couldn't find a good actor who is left handed to play Author.  As a baseball fan in kindof ruined the movie for me, although I continue to love the book.

On another note, I keep seeing that this team was based on the Yankees, but I thought it was the New York Giants.  Wasn't 51 the year they won the pennant?  I had also always read that Dutch was based on the Giants manager Leo Durocher.",1340668800,3,1066,4.0285714285714285

It has no climactic home runs or championships. It ends in a quiet, low key way, and yet it packs a lot of wallop. Like life itself, it can move from the sublime to the ridiculous in a heartbeat. The Singing Mammoths scene is hilarious while the slow motion pop up scene is profoundly moving. Philosophically and stylistically, it sometimes evokes Hemingway's fatalistic ""grace under pressure"" emphasis. From the ace pitcher to the telephone operator, the acting is superb.

292099,3,6300216608,"""Bang the Drum Slowly"" is a 1973 adaptation of a 1956 TV program (Paul Newman and Albert Salmi) based on the Mark Harris novel of the same name. The film stars Michael Moriarty and Robert DeNiro.

Michael Moriarty is best known to us from his years playing ADA Ben Stone on ""Law and Order."" ""Drum"" was Moriarty's third film and that same year he appeared in a TV version of ""The Glass Menagerie"" for which he won his first Emmy. He won again in 1978 (""Holocaust"") and 2001 (""James Dean"") and along the way picked up 5 more nominations as well as a Golden Globe (""Holocaust"") and a Tony (""Find Your Way Home"") in 1974.

There's not much you can say about DeNiro. He won the Oscar twice (""Raging Bull"" and ""Godfather 2"") and was nominated 4 other times (""Taxi Driver"", ""Deer Hunter"", ""Awakenings"" and ""Cape Fear"") and in later years was nominated twice for the American Comedy Award (""Meet the Parents"" and ""Analyze This""). ""Drum"" was his 10th film and 2 months later his breakthrough performance in ""Mean Streets"" launched him on his way - the next year he appeared in ""Godfather 2"".

The role of the dying catcher Bruce Pierson was originally offered to Al Pacino, but Coppola wanted Pacino for ""The Godfather"" and had him released. DeNiro was supposed to play Paulie in ""The Godfather"" but had to give up that role in order to play Pierson. It worked out OK for both of them!

The film co-stars the great character actor Vincent Gardenia, comedian and sometimes actor Phil Foster, and Thelma Diamond

-Vincent Gardenia appeared in nearly 100 films and TV shows. He was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Bang the Drum Slowly"" and ""Moonstruck""), won an Emmy in 1990 for ""Age-Old Friends"" and won a Tony in 1972 for ""Prisoner of Second Avenue."" He gave us many memorable performances, but my favorite is Detective Frank Ochoa in ""Death Wish"" (1974). Gardenia plays the foul-mouthed manager of the New York Mammoths.

-Phil Foster was a great comedian, part of the borscht belt comedians that emerged in the late 30s. He's best known to us from his recurring role in ""Laverne and Shirley"" produced by his old friend Gary Marshall. Foster plays a team member.

- Selma Diamond plays a raspy-voiced receptionist in the New York hotel where the players stay. She's best remembered for her continuing role in the TV series ""Night Court"" for which she earned an Emmy nomination in 1985 (Rhea Perlman won for ""Cheers""). Diamond also received an Emmy nomination for her writing work on ""Caesar's Hour"" (1954). She is terrific as the nosey switchboard operator.

- Ann Wedgeworth has a small role as a hooker. Wedgeworth won the National Society of Film Critics award for Best Supporting Actress in 1977 (""Handle with Care"") and won a Tony as Best Actress in 1978 for Neil Simon's ""Chapter Two"". She was a well-known soap actress at the time the film was made, having appeared in ""Another World"" (1967-1970) and ""Somerset"" (1970-1973).
The film is basically a character study of the relationship between Moriarty and DeNiro.

The author of the novel upon which the film is based was Mark Harris. Harris is known for his baseball novels (e.g., ""The Southpaw"", ""A Ticket for a Seam stitch"", ""It Looked like Forever"") all of which center on the experiences of pitcher Henry ""Author"" Wiggins, played by Moriarty who does an absolutely terrific job as the experienced star pitcher who takes the ailing Denier character under his wing.

John Hancock directs. This was his third film, and he went on to do a dozen undistinguished films and a few TV shows. His best known film is probably ""Weeds"" which he also wrote. Hancock went on to have greater success on the stage.

The film was a box office success and critically acclaimed. Vincent Gardenia got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor and DeNiro won a NY Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actor. Writing for Time Magazine, Richard Schickel called it an ""extraordinarily well-made film"" and say that it was a ""funny, gentle and honestly sentimental movie that is easily one of the best of the year in any category, and very possibly the best movie about sport ever made in this country."" Roger Ebert called it ""the ultimate baseball movie""

DeNiro's performance as the dumb catcher is not among his best performances. He spends a lot of time chewing tobacco and smiling, and slips in and out of his ""southern"" accent. His facial expressions, at times, come directly from Johnny Boy Civello, the role he did the same year in ""Mean Streets"" which was a completely different character. If you want to see a good performance from the young DeNiro, ""Mean Streets"" is the better choice.

Another problem I had with DeNiro's performance is that he doesn't look like a ball player. Whereas Michael Moriarty has us believing that he is a big league pitcher, DeNiro never looks the part. The camera tries to hide this fact in several ways (e.g., every time DeNiro comes to the plate he is filmed by himself) but everytime he is filmed with the other players, it's obvious that he is out of place. This is never more apparent than when 5 players get together to shoot a commercial, and DeNiro looks more like the bat boy than a MLB catcher.

Despite the accolades at the time, unfortunately, the film does not stand the test of time very well. ""Brian's Song"" provided us with a far better version of the ""sports/buddy/dying"" movie and the baseball scenes appear highly staged. Personally, if I wanted to watch a film about baseball, I'd look at films like ""Eight Men Out"" (1988), Bull Durham"" (1989), and ""A League of Their Own"" (1992). If I wanted to watch a baseball comedy I'd watch ""Damn Yankees"" (1957), ""Bad News Bears"" (1976), or ""Major League"" (1989).

The greatest single virtue of this film is Michael Moriarty's performance.",1271548800,3,5771,4.757

When Bruce gets diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease they form a close bond as Henry looks out for Bruce, covering up his illness and sticking up for him, making sure he stays on the team and can play out his `last season'.  There is growing suspicion as Bruce has to make plenty of doctor's appointments, and their coach Dutch Schnell roots around trying to find answers to his many questions, which makes it harder and harder for Bruce to keep his condition a secret.

Sooner or later, it all has to come out.

I know that many will not agree with me, but I felt that `Bang the Drum Slowly' lacked a lot of heart and soul.  It just seemed very textbook and came off like an overly manipulative `Lifetime' movie.  It had all the elements to create a satisfying tear jerker, but it couldn't quite construct them properly.  The film wasn't as touching as it could have been because it lacked a natural spark, a life that made it feel a part of the audience.  I think that De Niro is to blame for some (not all) of that.  I actually found this to be a very weak performance given by one of the best actors to have ever worked in the business.  I was shocked to see him sift through each scene rather lazily.  Some will balk at that accusation, but hear me out.  He gave a very clich&eacute;d and expected portrayal of a sick under educated man.  Technically it was proficient, but it lacked any real emotion.  He seemed almost bored half the time.  There is a way to project the feeling of being weight down by your own anxiety without stripping the character of his appeal, and apparently De Niro didn't know how to do that yet.

But like I said, he's only partially to blame.  The script was very heavy handed and the films director didn't quite know how to use that to his advantage.  It had no real flow.

I will say that both Michael Moriarty and the Oscar nominated Vincent Gardenia do fine jobs with the material and actually turn in very good performances.  I actually agree with Gardenia's nomination; for he brought a comedic flare and sincere concern to Dutch.  Sadly, his performance is not enough to get me to recommend this movie.  So, disagree all you like, but I'm not going to lie to you; this didn't work for me.",1239235200,5,2635,4.426195426195426

292104,5,6300216608,"bang the drum slowly is one of the few movies that lives up to the book.  deniro/moriarty.  wow!  this is a slice of the majors before a backup catcher was a millionaire.  and a 20 game winner sells insurance on the side.  the concept of ""TEGWOR,"" (the eternal game without rules) is machiavellian by way of jocks playing cards and playing the fans.  it's true to a wince.  this movie is the equal of bull durham and almost matches field of dreams. a true comedy in the classic sense.

292135,4,6300216608,"To say the book and this movie is not really about baseball is not quite right. Yes, it is about more than just baseball, but baseball provides the rhythms, the spring, summer and ultimately the winter for us all. Baseball is the only major sport where time is not a factor, it can be played into infinity. That said, the cut aways from the actors to the real ballplayers was pretty well done. I did think it was strange for the Yankees to be playing the Reds and the Pirates. I wish DeNiro had spent as much time on baseball as he did on the accent. Also, Harris wrote four books with Henry Wiggins as the main character, from rookie to veteran on his way out. I highly recommend his books. ""From now on I rag nobody.""

292137,5,6300216608,"DeNiro as a tobacco-sptting, toothless country bumpkin, third string catcher on a championship ball club [an awful lot like the Yankees], gives his greatest against-type performance.  Not the wise-ass, street-wise hard-guy we love but a vulnerable, ignorant young man, invisible among tv-star athletes, personfied by Michael Moriarty as the star pitcher.

  It's a story about the casual cruelty of modern life, and companionship springing up between bitter teammate rivals in response to a crisis bigger than their own lives, let alone the pennant race or the Series.  Sport again is an apt filmic metaphor for life.  Success and failure are public  --  hugeley public  -- but in the dugout and locker room the players are themselves with each other.  First-rate performances by the supporting cast  --  Danny Aiello, Selma Diamond, Phil Silvers, Vincent Gardenia  --  The apotheosis of the guy-cry.  Some of the stylistic pleasure of the book  --  the narrator's under-educated prose  --  are missing from the film, but still, it is after seeing movies in their thousands, still my favorite movie of all time.",1197504000,2,1111,5.2102272727272725

292139,4,6300216608,"There was nothing hokey overly melodramatic about this story, and usually you get that with a sports story or about a good person dying. In this case, we have a combination of the two.

This is simply a mellow, sweet-natured human interest story well-acted by the two main stars: Michael Moriarity and Robert De Niro. Both are nice to watch, playing very easy-going non-offensive characters.

Moriarty plays a pitcher on a pennant-contending team who lovingly looks after his not-so-smart-but-dying teammate and friend (De Niro). By today's standards, it's slow-moving but I never got bored with it in several viewings. As nice a film as it is, there is one warning: a lot profanity by the manager (Vincent Gardenia) but it's not a kids' movie anyway.

I watched it years ago and then again recently when it came out on DVD. It's hard to get excited about it, yet it's a memorable story that I could never get out of my head. We all wish we had friends like the one Moriarty portrays here.",1145145600,6,989,4.705202312138728

intimate friend helps DeNiro cope with Hodgkins as well as
make the season to the end. This is one of the more touching
films that I have watched. It would compare to ""Brian's Song""

292144,4,6300216608,"""Bang the Drum Slowly"" is a line taken from the cowboy dirge ""The Steets of Laredo"" which is about a cowboy dying young.""Bang the Drum Slowly"" which is based on a novel by the same name, is about a dying dim-witted, country boy catcher and a sophisticated, star pitcher. The catcher (Pearson), played by Robert DeNiro, is dying from Hogkin's disease and the only one who knows about it is the Michael Moriarty character (Arthur). The story goes on how Arthur is suddenly nice to Pearson. No one knows why and everyone becomes more resentful of Pearson. Slowly everyone learns that Pearson is dying and starts to treat Pearson nicer. In addition, the team, a talented but bickering group of ballplayers,  are finally united because of Pearson's condition and go on to win the series. The continued subtle references to the business side of baseball pulls us back to the harsh reality of life and prevents the movie from being too corny. The movie is superb, but the DVD would have been better if some extras were included especially if there were something about history of free agency in baseball. $124,000 is not even the the base pay of today's rookie major leaguer, but in 1974 (when the movie was made) this was a huge amount of money. 1974 was also significant because this was the year that Andy Messersmith of the Dodger's challenged the reserve clause and became the first free agent.",1082764800,12,1392,4.728395061728395
