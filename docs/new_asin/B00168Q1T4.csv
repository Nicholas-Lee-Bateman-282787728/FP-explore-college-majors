8261623,1,B00168Q1T4,I purchased this DVD for my son and I was disappointed it had nothing on it. I had this Laurel and Hardy short on VHS tape and it is scratchy at best and wanted it on DVD. This was one of my son's favorite movie when he was a small boy.,1288483200,,236,3.6470588235294117
8261624,1,B00168Q1T4,"Am I missing something?  Is ther an advantage to watching a classic movie, produced in the square picture full frame 1.33:1 format, cropped on the top & bottom so that you can watch it on a wide-screen 16X9 TV?

This is like the old days when Ciemascope movies were cropped off on the sides so that you could watch it on a standard TV screen.",1235779200,,342,4.246153846153846
