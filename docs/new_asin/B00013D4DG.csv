1969062,5,B00013D4DG,"After watching Evita the musical which I love I wanted a more truthful account of her life, I understood that the common people loved her so I knew there had to be more to this woman, there is, this account tells us her life story brilliantly.

Loved it.",1346889600,,254,4.291666666666667
1969063,2,B00013D4DG,I was disappointed with the quality of the movie. It also stopped right in the middle and I was not able to watch the rest.,1335312000,,123,3.96
1969064,4,B00013D4DG,"An excellent movie. First, the actors. Victor Laplace has been made up to look uncannily like Peron and has captured all his mannerisms. Great acting. Esther Goris does an outstanding job; she does not look exactly like Evita, but she ""is"" Evita, at least in her public life (of course, we don't know firsthand what the private Evita was like, but testimonies of people that knew her indicate that Goris' approach is dead on). The rest of the actors are generally good.

The script by Jos Pablo Feinmann is excellent; it is historically correct (although some details may be subject to discussion) and enough is shown in the movie to give a good picture of Argentina under Peron (e. g. the blind hatred that the propertied classes had for Evita). The movie is not a whitewash; the good and the bad are there.

If you have seen the Madonna take on Evita, forget it and watch this movie. You will probably enjoy it better if you are familiar with Buenos Aires slang (it translates with difficulty, although the subtitles do a good job).",1314576000,,1034,4.644808743169399
1969065,5,B00013D4DG,"This is the best movie I have seen in years,I have always been fascinated with Evita,and this movie catches perfectly why she is still loved nearly 60 years after her death. Esther Goris,looks enough like the real Eva,is magic in this film,the final scene will move you as if you are watching someone you love die. It's great to see the politics behind the Peron's decisions,why Evita did what she did,and especially for her love of her beloved descamisados. I recommend this film to those EVITA aficionados,who want a little more truth and reality than what you get from the musical,although I like that as well,it's just not that honest.",1297296000,,639,4.818181818181818
1969066,5,B00013D4DG,"I give this five stars for the performance by Ester Goris, she is riveting as Eva Peron.  Like other reviewers stated it is not idolizing or demonizing her.  It is a good insight into how tough Eva can be.  One key scene to watch is when she has a luncheon with a Marxist ally that respects her but will not kowtow, and she is impressed with that.  She states then ""Maybe I'm just a dictator"" and he replies ""dictatorship without revolution is just a dictatorship..nothing more"", it makes her think on the course she is taking, and influences her.",1204588800,3,547,4.494949494949495
1969067,5,B00013D4DG,"This Argentine feature was release around the same time as Alan Parker's film version of the hit musical ""Evita"". For those interested in learning about Argentina's controversial first lady, I recommend both films. Desanzo's version is lower-budget and therefore not as spectacular as Parker's interpretation, but ""Eva Pern"" is more historically accurate and fair in it's treatment of Evita. At least when compared to what has been written about her in a historical context.

The film deals with the final stages of Eva Pern's life. It chronicles her bid for the vice-presidency and her illness in detail. Other stages of her short life, childhood, artistic years, etc, are seen in flashbacks.

My only (minor) complaint lies with, surprisingly, Esther Goris. I say surprisingly because her performance is great (more on this a little later) and she does resemble Eva Pern during her final stages but when playing the younger Eva Duarte de Pern or the actress Eva Duarte, Goris doesn't even come close in her resemblance. Maybe it's because I have seen one too many pictures of the historical woman pre-1950 (before her disease) and the differences in physical appearance are too apparent. The real Eva's beauty was more radiant, her hair more elaborate and her body was more voluptuous in those earlier years. Goris is too thin, to abrasive and does not possess the softness that is evident in pictures or newsreel footage of the young Evita during her earlier years as the First Lady. I usually have difficulties watching a bio-film when the leading actor does not resemble the person they are portraying. I had a similar problem with Leonardo DiCaprio portraying Howard Hughes in ""The Aviator"".

Goris's voice and personality are also too over-bearing. Granted, the real Eva, according to many, was just that and her voice was indeed shrill when giving her impassioned speeches on the balcony of the Casa Rosada but during her less intense speeches and moments such as speaking to her Descamisados over the radio, her voice was calm and peaceful. According to those who knew her best, she also had a sweet and gentle side to her. That's not really seen in this film.  Eva Pern was a diamond with some rough edges, Goris is rough around the edges.

With that said, since Goris is portraying Eva during her final years, for the most part, she does indeed capture her essence physically and vocally and her performance is riveting. Like Madonna in Parker's film, Goris appears to have become Eva Pern and her passion for the role is evident in this performance.

Those thinking that this Argentine version will portray Eva as a saintly deity may be shocked. This interpretation portrays an Eva Pern who liked to wear nice clothes and hats but had the will of a survivor. A strong woman who talked the talk and walked the walk and was able to change, for good or bad (take your pick), an entire nation forever due to her overwhelming fire and passion. This is a much tougher Evita than in Parker's film and if Madonna's Evita and Goris' Evita would ever face off in a boxing ring, Goris' Eva would stand victorious.

Despite my above comments, Esther Goris is outstanding in her portrayal and the production as a whole is excellent. Considering the tremendous amount of misinformation about the real woman on film: ""Little Mother"", ""Evita Peron"" (starring the mis-cast Faye Dunaway) and even the rock opera, this film is a blessing. And for those, like me, who are thirsty for something more truthful to history, we finally have a film that is pretty accurate historically and unbiased in it's treatment of it's leading lady and her legacy.",1119830400,20,3639,4.888168557536467
1969068,5,B00013D4DG,"I recently recieved this as part of a birthday gift after purchasing Andrew Lloyd Webber's EVITA a few months previous to it.  While I found Webber's version a bit dry with substance it led me to this DVD which provided me with an understanding to how Argentina viewed their political figure.

Unlike Webber's version, the Director shows Evita in several political situations, such as meeting a woman from the Charity Association, and talking to the railroad workers when they begin a strike.  Also unlike Webber's version, the director in this one concentrated solely on Eva's vice presidency which Webber short-changed during the filming of his Evita.

Ester Goris, looks impressively like the real Evita and also has the ability to show emotions very well.  For example, when Peron ignores Evita going up for the vice presidency she launchs into a tirade about how she has been discriminated against all her life, and when Eva finds out about her cancer Ester calmly sits down in front of a mirror before striking it four times with her fist.

I highly recommend this movie as a resource to all Evita fans who have a project or are just curious about the life and death of Eva Peron.",1113868800,18,1186,4.78921568627451
1969069,3,B00013D4DG,"An interesting take with astonishing performance. The movie lacked some exciting cinematography and character development of the real Eva Peron. She was portrait as hard blooded socialist and commonest propagate but there were some other aspects of her life that was not developed. for example her deep desire of knowing God and willing to ask him for help. Instead she faced a washed out, doubtful, and not even a Catholic believer who performs the rituals with out having faith in it. This spiritual aspect of world's famous leaders are worth exploring. Great examples are; John Paul II, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Desmond TU Tu, Nelson Mandela, Mother Theresa, and on and on.",1380758400,,685,5.125
1969070,5,B00013D4DG,"An excellent and biographical movie of Eva Peron, I first saw it several years ago and I love the great performance of Esther Goris .",1373760000,,133,4.36
1969071,4,B00013D4DG,"This movie was my introduction to the subject, so I can't vouch for its accuracy one way or the other.  However, the story is told as an unvarnished, realistic portrayal of the use of power.  It's a compelling story, and a beautiful piece of filmmaking.  Esther Goris' acting is brilliant and compassionate, and utterly honest.  The supporting actors and actresses were also inspired.  It was beautifully shot, directed, and edited.  Definitely two thumbs up.",1371254400,,459,5.135135135135135
1969072,2,B00013D4DG,Having to depend on the subtitles takes away the spontaneity of the other films. Watch Madonna and Antonio Bandaras instead.,1369267200,,124,5.25
1969073,5,B00013D4DG,This film is great in that it really explains and develops how Miss Eva Peron rose to power. It really helped me to understand the personality and type of person she was.,1365120000,,170,4.34375
1969074,5,B00013D4DG,"An old man's rewiew. The cast in this production is nothing but full of superb actors. Headed by Esther Goris,who I believe gives every ounce of her acting ability in portraying an ill and troubled Eva Duarte de Peron. However I also believe that the director had sense enough not to get into the devistating effects that the horrible cancer the Senora was afflicted with. My mother,father and of course myself (a young boy of 14 at the time)witnessed day by day over the last few months of her life. We were part of the,what was known at the time as,direct staff housed at Unzue. The script of this movie is also remarable in it's informative way but as in most presentations on the life of famous individuals somewhat incomplete. Again my respectful comment is thumbs up ten fold for all that this film represents. Quality and a mostly accurate message portrayed to the viewer. In my viewing of this film (several times)I am swept up in the BACK and THEN of it all. Yes I cry.",1361577600,3,978,4.531073446327683
1969075,3,B00013D4DG,"This movie would have been rated a five star had it not been for an over zealous translation in the sub-titles of the movie.  Although I am not a huge fan of vulgar language, there were times when it seemed as though the translation was made for the expressed purpose of scintillation versus a desire to provide assistance to the viewer.",1360108800,,337,4.524590163934426
1969076,5,B00013D4DG,"This movie is captivating, and the story is true. The actors played the characters so well, when watching the movie, it takes you back in time when the events really occured. It is phenomenal!",1355875200,,192,4.676470588235294

8006025,4,B00013D4DG,"I love Eva Peron as a character who influenced the political history of Argentina. She was an actress or used sex for political purpose, that is beside the point. She gave breakthrough for women in Argentina and south America. She helped poor people in practical way. I find lot of
parallel in her story and the stories acted out in third world countries. Pity she died so young. The film is very effective. Esther Goris's acting is
superb.",1447804800,,440,4.653846153846154
8006026,5,B00013D4DG,"I love the movie of Eva Duarte de Peron, she was a progressive in the quest to find equality for the disenfranchised and she broke all types of barriers. She defends the weak giving them much attention and dismissed the affluent women whom detest her. However, her spirit could not be broken, she rose to any challenge until her unfortunate last breath. She was noble at its very core of the word. She ran the government of Argentina  with grace and intelligence, long live Evita for will always be in my heart.",1427328000,,511,4.554347826086956
