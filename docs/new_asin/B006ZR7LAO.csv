8507190,5,B006ZR7LAO,Very fair price for an interesting production of an intriguing opera by a composer I love. Quick and careful shipment.,1442620800,,118,4.95
8507191,5,B006ZR7LAO,"Contrary to what one reviewer says, this blu-ray does have English subtitles.  (The overture to this production happens to be on youtube, so you can preview it there.)  For some reason, Amazon has prized this blu-ray at $5.75.  That is an incredible deal. I ordered it.",1376179200,,269,4.804347826086956
8507192,3,B006ZR7LAO,"The notion of a woman over three hundred years old trying to retrieve the lost
recipe for her elixir of youth is fascinating, even if the music seldom takes
us to lyrical heights. But this is a disappointing production. There's nothing
especially wrong with it (though the lengthy pantomime sequences add nothing
but running time), but no spark, either. The old Decca audio set, with Elisabeth
Soderstrom under Charles Mackerras, gets much more out of the music.",1364515200,,462,5.012987012987013
8507193,3,B006ZR7LAO,"The weird regie theater production went over the top for me. Too much irrelevant and incomprehensible distractions. Others have described it in detail and some liked it, but the old woman chain smoking in a glass cube or popping in and out of doors served no purpose that I could divine. I had hoped to show it to my opera group but I will use the dated but wonderful Anja Silja version instead. Blu ray does not redeem this oddball production. No complaints from a musical point of view.",1362268800,3,488,4.49438202247191
8507194,5,B006ZR7LAO,"This opera concerns a 314 year old diva Emilia Marty, played by Angela Denoke,who is embroiled in a complicated lawsuit and who is hunting for a document that will renew her lease on life. Marty,a true femme fatale,possesses a nearly magical ability to bewitch men. This power she uses to confound lawyers,make her courtroom adversary fall in love with her, and,inadvertantly,drive his son to commit suicide. All of this Marty greets with an indifference mixed with disgust because she has come to regard existence itself as a drab and pointless burden......Angela Denoke dominates the opera. She conveys an allure that is at once fascinating and frightening. She is also able to convey a vulnerability as her character is literally worn down by the weight of time...The Makropulos Affair is an ""actor's opera"" in that the opera takes precedence over the music. The score combines a kind of atonality with lyricism and adds greatly to the strange and disturbing power of the entire opera.the set includes an old fashioned courtroom and a modern '60's style waiting room, the costumes suggest the 1920's. All of this is meant to convery a disjointed conception of time...the video itself is sharp and clear with English subtitles. I highly recommend it, even for those who are not drawn to 'modern' opera.",1354233600,4,1304,5.041666666666667
8507195,1,B006ZR7LAO,"This is an opera in Checkoslovakian without any sub-titles, which is unheard of in the world of opera DVD's. Typically, every DVD comes with a main screen where you do choose the sound, the sub-titles, the scenes, etc. This Blu-Ray has none of this and again no sub-titles in any language. Normally an opera DVD will give you a choice of sub-titles in five or six languages. This is a pity, because just watching the beginning, I could tell that the mise-en-scene was quite interesting. I am returning my purchase.",1345334400,4,514,4.722222222222222
8507196,5,B006ZR7LAO,"Vec Makropulos has a verbose libretto with no real set pieces, except for the final scene and aria. However, one characteristic of Janaek 's vocal music is his focus on replicating Czech speech patterns, so the music is always interesting, and always commenting on the action. The entire opera is only 90 minutes long; and it really repays repeated viewings/hearings. I got a lot more out of it the second time around.

The entire opera takes place on a single set. On stage right is a glass-enclosed break room.  The area on stage left looks like an airport waiting area. The main playing area is a courtroom, as the plot turns around a court case (although a courtroom is not specified in the libretto.) The whole scene conveys a sense of waiting for something to happen (or not happen.)

Emilia Marty is the opera diva at the center of the story. In the course of the opera, we learn that Emilia is 337 years old and is in fact rather bored with living so long--constantly reinventing herself and finding a new life and lover (but always as a singer of unnatural beauty).

This production definitely falls into the Regieoper category. There is a lot of sub-textual action on the sidelines. The action doesn't literally mirror the plot, but director Christoph Marthaler has created repetitive action that comments abstractly on the many lives of Emilia Marty. Among other elements, on stage right, during Acts 2 and 3, two bits occur (and recur) involving an orderly, an elderly woman, and some flowers. The overall effect of the symbolic movement was probably a lot more effective in the theater, since most of this action takes place simultaneously with the opera.  In the opera house, the viewer would be able to take in all the action at once, or at least decide for him/herself where to focus.

Emilia sings in her final aria that the relative brevity of life is what gives human existence its joys and meaning. Never-ending life seems to blur and ultimately render meaningless the differences between good and evil, happiness and sadness, and even life and death.  In the end,  the diva who has the power to live forever decides it's not worth it, (During this final scene, on stage right, the young woman collapses. When the doctor enters, he ignores the young woman, and examines the elderly woman; then picks her up and carries her out.)

Musically, this is a solid and convincing production. The Vienna Philharmonic provide their usual lush support with Janaek's sweeping, colorful score under the attentive direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.

This opera succeeds or fails on the lead soprano. Angela Denoke provides us with a resounding success. She has strong and lovely voice, one that also serves the music of Richard Strauss well. She portrays Emilia's dignity, elegance, sensuality, and world-weariness beautifully.

Danish baritone Johan Reuter is another standout voice, warm and lyrical. Other noteworthy performances are by Jochen Schmeckenbacker, Ryland Davies and Raymond Very. Overall, this is a strong cast. Most of the cast are not native Czech speakers, but to my non-Czech ears, they sounded convincing.

I highly recommend this DVD. It is a stirring performance of a fascinating opera.",1343779200,8,3212,4.960893854748603
8507197,5,B006ZR7LAO,"Leos Janacek wrote what many consider his operatic masterpiece, The Makropoulos Case (The Marhropoulos Affair/Vec Makropoulos) in the mid 1920's, premiering in 1926.  Based on a comedy by Czech playwright Karel Capek, this is certainly one of Janacek's best scores, but is also a fairly dense and symbolic story that unfolds gradually. This is a very enjoyable production, recorded live at the 2011 Salzburg Festival with a modernistic set design and somewhat surreal feel in this staging by Christopher Marthaler.

Musically, this is a very interesting work, containing some ""recognizable"" Janacek (brass flourishes and chattering winds that will remind many of bits and pieces of Taras Bulba or the Sinfonietta). However, the score also flirts with styles that echo everything from late Richard Strauss to early Schoenberg to Debussy. Both musically and dramatically I have always liked The Makropoulos Case but in the small, but impressive Janacek operatic output, I am partial to From the House of the Dead with its fairly grim, but direct libretto.

The plot to Makropoulos is - all at once - simple and very heady.  Essentially, a mysterious opera singer and a bit of femme fatale, Emilia Marty, shows up while in opera productions to offer information that can unravel clues to a century old lawsuit between two families involving secret documents, spurned love and unproven lineages. The real catch - which does not even begin to become clear until the late second act - is that Marty is probably (later - admittedly) the daughter of the physician to the Emperor Rudolph II who had commissioned the personal physician to concoct a ""fountain of youth"" potion which the Emperor tested on the doctor's daughter, Elina Makropoulos. After it is revealed that Emilia Marty has, indeed, been alive for over 300 years and has assumed various identities, each of which is a woman with the initials ""EM"", the proof of this finally emerges. Along the way, Emilia encounters many men who are attracted to her; who have an inkling of her mysterious nature and - in one case - is actually a former lover from many years ago.

The story is considered a comedy by author Capek and by Janacek but the humor is broad, satirical and subtle; falling mainly along the lines of poking fun at the folly of those who seek immortality, the arrogance of the upper class who think they can, literally, buy such a thing and the frailty of the human nature; especially into old age. If Makropoulos is not performed more often it is not for the music, which is accessible and ethereal; just ""modern"" enough while being very audience friendly. It is, perhaps, for the libretto, which requires full audience concentration and more than a little acumen for irony. In fact, many would find it a stretch that the story is a ""comedy"". While there are stock characters and some very creative unsung doddering laborers who are treated a bit shabbily at the hands of the upper crust in satiric fashion; ultimately Emilia's centuries old roulade ends when her secret is discovered.  She leaves several forelorn admirers, a son and a starry eyed admirer of opera all somewhat shocked and disappointed and Marty - in the libretto - drops dead (In Marthaler's staging, she walks off stage symbolically never to be seen again). The ""comedy"" is the broadest of satires and the tone is actually quite bittersweet.
The reason to acquire this very engaging new DVD is the modernistic staging, coupled with the wonderful and insightful performance by the forces of the Vienna Philharmonic under the always amazing Esa-Pekka Salonen; one of my favorite conductors. All performances are quite good but the real - and central - star of the show is Angela Denoke as Emilia, who exudes the necessary uneasy blend of sexiness and intrigue.

This is a very fine disc to own to have a wonderful performance of this very esoteric and somewhat rare opera by the Czech master but also to have an unusually riveting staging of a work that does not get staged often at all. Following at home is worth your while and I recommend this production strongly.",1343001600,3,4099,4.9062049062049065
