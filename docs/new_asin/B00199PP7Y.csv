8505616,3,B00199PP7Y,"There is one glaring problem with this DVD for Americans. In the US, Waltz and Viennese Waltz, have the opposite feet as leads than those of Britain and Europe. In the US, the man's lead foot is the left and the woman's lead foot is the right. It is an adage of US social ballroom dance that ""the woman is always right!"" This DVD teaches European leads. If you learn these basics using the European lead feet, when you attend a US social dance, you will have issues with lead and follow with everyone else.
Having said that, this is still a solid teaching DVD of the 3-4 most basic steps of Waltz and Viennese Waltz. Simply remember to reverse everything said about direction, except for the counter-clockwise line-of-dance.
One improvement that should have been made of this otherwise solid basic DVD would have been to discuss and demonstrate 'rise and fall' nature of waltz movement.",1405123200,,886,4.685897435897436
8505617,4,B00199PP7Y,"If you're looking for pure Waltz, this is not for you.  If you are a beginner, this DVD is definetly not for you. This DVD emphasis is on Viennese Waltz.  Inexpensive Viennese Waltz DVDs are hard to find, so although I wanted normal Waltz, I was happy with surprise.  DVD provides good narration and examples.",1237161600,5,309,4.581818181818182
