8323491,4,B001NDHM2W,I ordered this as a gift for my mom because she loves Paula Deen so I don't really know how good the book is.  My mom was excited when she got it so I'm assuming its good.,1366761600,,171,3.6216216216216215
8323492,5,B001NDHM2W,"I love this one! This is the one where she visits Jimmy Carter. Except on this  dvd version they show ""edited"" pieces of the interview that that they couldn't show on t.v.  Also, it's the one where she cooks the blueberry coffee cake on her pourch. One neat part of the ""Extra spoonful of Paula"" she shows you the house that she and Michael are building as it's being built as well as some other things. She also makes soup and sandwhiches. If you love Paula you'll love this one! But, The real retail price is $15.00, not this high amount.",1239494400,,540,4.336633663366337
