2460654,2,B000CEXF5G,"B-movie horror actress/hottie Cerina Vincent stars in this low budget flick as a ranger who spends most of her days drinking herself to the point of passing out, in hopes of drowning her sorrows after being responsible for the death of her best friend. As if matters couldn't get any worse ,she comes across an acient creature that was once thought to only be a Native American legend, and being alone in the outpost, her survival instincts kick in when she realizes that she has only herself to take it on. Most of the movie is pretty much a bore, mostly since all our lead does is drink and whine about her problems. At one point a male counterpart steps into the picture only to offer a shpulder to cry on and some sexin it up. Throughout the movie we'd get a kill her and there, but the action doesn't really pick up until towards the end when our heroine the beast. When the creature was fully shown it reminded me of the monsterfrom Split Second an underrated film starring Rutger Hauer. By the look of the creature, you wouldn't have gussed it was a low budget flick, because instead of a cheap costume or fake looking CGI, we're given a cool looking monster that can equal to something seen on a big screen production. The cinematography isn't bad and I have give credit that they really  tried to pass this off as an above average DVD feature, relying mostly on performances and a story than blood and guts. We don't get a lot of on screen deaths,but we're at least treated to some decent look corpses. Aside from the annoying whining and rants from the heroine, the film is fairly decentin parts, especially when it came down to the creature. However, don't expect a lot of action until towards the end.",1150761600,,1713,4.490384615384615

This film dragged bigtime with some b.s. about Cerina Vincents characters guilt over a car accident she caused that kills her friend...lush!  The amount of time spent on these flashbacks of drunken guiltiness has nothing to do with the problem at hand; some supernatural creature killing everyone in the forest valley. I would have given this film another star if it had one of two things, more gore,or if Cerina vincent took off her top. Bottom line..Dull.",1150243200,4,551,4.913978494623656

2460657,3,B000CEXF5G,"IT WAITS is a notch above many similar-themed movies, but does suffer from trying to be a psychological study as well.  Cerina Vincent plays Danni, a forest ranger who feels guilty after the auto accident death of her best friend, Julie.  Moreso because everyone thought Julie was driving, but Danni was actually behind the wheel.  She has a supportive and loving boyfriend, Justin, and she has turned to booze for escape.  What this has to do with the movie is not clearly stated, but once the monster starts killing off people, IT WAITS becomes a pretty intense and spooky thriller.  While the monster isn't up to standards these days, it's not as bad as some of the more obvious men in costume howlers.

There is a lot of slow/boring acting shots with stupid music choices that get old real quick.  The thing I didn't like the most, was the evil creature.

2460678,2,B000CEXF5G,"Predictable horror stuff: some college students accidentally let loose an ancient monster. It kills them off-screen. Then it begins to rampage through the British Columbia wilderness. It eventually targets our buxom heroine, Cerina Vincent, ace forest ranger because she's really depressed or...something something.

Things I have to say about this flick:

1. Cerina Vincent constantly wears skimpy outfits, revealing her large bust. While other characters will completely zip up, Vincent will be unzipped, exposing the curves of her boobs in a tight, white tanktop. Obviously by exposing her boobs in tight shirts, the director wants to arouse male audiences. But where's the nudity? There's a sex scene, but still she doesn't get naked. The director lost points with me for that letdown.

2. Vincent isn't a convincing forest ranger. Her makeup, hair, and skin is always perfect. Is there a beauty salon in that forest?

3. The deaths are predictable. In many horror movies, there's that cliched stock character who acts like a jerk to everyone with little or no provocation. Is anyone surprised when he's killed? There's a character that knows a horrible creature is killing people. So what does he decide to do? He decides to leave the protection of the ranger's tower...at night...without a firearm. I hope no one is reading this review wondering, ""Does he live?"" What do you think?

4. There are there weird MTV, Dawson's Creek, Party of 5 type music montages. Vincent will sometimes be sitting around moping, staring into the distance. Then there will be this Lilith Fair, Sarah McLachlan type music playing. Why is this in a horror movie?

There are two types of horror fans: those who generally prefer psychological horror that's mysterious and suspenseful; those who generally prefer exploitation, action, and gore. This movie doesn't have enough mystery and suspense for the former. Nor is there nearly enough action and gore for the latter? So this movie isn't memorable for any type of horror buff. This movie is ""meh"" at best.",1347753600,3,2040,5.129518072289157
2460679,4,B000CEXF5G,"I liked this movie very much. One of the aspects that sold me on it was that the emphasis was on the people and their actions much more so than the more common 'action' or 'fright' type horror movies. The main characters were likable, flawed and reasonable. The acting was good to excellent. All the technical 'goofs' were minor. The 'monster' was kind of just another character and was depicted as not omnipitent but possible to be fought. I liked it for the same reasons that I liked the original ""The Thing"", ""The Blob"" and ""Them"". This movie is worth the price.",1334275200,,565,4.549019607843137
2460680,3,B000CEXF5G,"What are the odds of finding a marauding, mythological monster AND the world's hottest ranger in the same forest? It boggles the mind! Cerina Vincent (CABIN FEVER) plays said hottie -a forest ranger named Danielle- going up against one horrid beasty! Unfortunately, the first half of IT WAITS is mostly about our heroine's breakdown after losing her best friend in a car crash. She drinks vodka, cries, and feels guilty. Verrry guilty. Luckily, the monster emerges from it's cave lair and goes on a murderous rampage! Oh yes, there will be gore! Meanwhile, Danielle is consoled by her worried boyfriend. Everyone gets in touch w/ their feelings. Then, the monster attacks w/ a vengeance, forcing Danielle and co. to stop their therapy session in order to survive. Blood flows, heads are removed from shoulders, and Danielle forgets all about her emotional upheaval. IT WAITS is a decent monster movie w/ a slow beginning, an ok middle, and a superb ending. The only thing I actually hated was that stupid parrot! Jeez, that bird was annoying! The boyfriend was goofy, but at least he ran head-on into the creature!

2460682,3,B000CEXF5G,"It Waits is a movie that stuck with me since I saw it, back in 2007. It has some decent visuals and an interesting monster. It also has decent characters, although other than Cerina Vincent's character they aren't that central to the film.

Fans of older monster movies will be relieved to hear this monster does have some personality. It's intelligent and enjoys messing with its victims' heads before killing them.

Actually the biggest downside can probably be written off as character stupidity, Other than that, it seems (its more apparent in the trailer) that there was supposed to be some kind of duality or parallels or something between Vincent's character and the monster, which didn't really work...

The only real emotion I felt was in the sad scenes; I've seen movies where the feel of isolation came across better, and during some attack scenes I didn't really feel the sense of urgency they should have had.

Don't get me wrong I like this film but because I try to be analytical in my reviews I don't think I can justify giving this four stars. I think Steven R. Monroe is a good director and while this isn't Wyvern or Sasquatch Mountain i think it's worth watching.",1261785600,,1183,4.700483091787439
2460683,4,B000CEXF5G,"2005's ""It Waits"" was directed by Steven Monroe and written by Richard Christian Matheson -- the son of famed writer Richard Matheson -- and Thomas E. Szollosi.

THE STORY: A forest ranger in the Great Northwest named Danny (Cerina Vincent) assuages her guilt & grief via alcohol while alone on the job. When her boyfriend comes to visit her in the wilderness they become increasingly aware of a creature or demonic entity that is killing off everyone in the local area and playing headgames like a cat plays with a mouse before slaying it.

It dawned on me after watching ""It Waits"" that it combines the plots of two 1979 films -- ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B003GXJ072/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prophecy/dp/B00005RDAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prophecy</a>"" (not the '95 film ""The Prophecy"" with Christopher Walken), both of which were out that summer. The aspects it borrows from ""Alien"" are obvious (BASIC PLOT SPOILER): A tall, hideous monster kills off a group of people in an isolated setting one by one; the creature's not fully shown until the ending wherein the lone female protagonist has a showdown with it. It resembles ""Prophecy"" in that there's a creature on the loose in the forest killing off people (both films were shot in British Columbia) and the creature is linked to a Native American legend. (END SPOILER)

Even though ""It Waits"" isn't very original it's not bad for what it is. Besides, it has two or three qualities that set it apart.

WHAT WORKS:

- The film stars Cerina Vincent who's one of the most awe-inspiring women in God's creation. I admit she's the main reason I bought the dvd, the secondary reason being that I enjoy creatures-on-the-loose flicks. The only other film I've seen Cerina in is 2006's ""Sasquatch Mountain."" Both films are great if you never tire of viewing Cerina in all her curvy, full-maned glory (sorry, no nude scenes or exploitive t&a shots like, say, the dumb ""Frankenfish""). Some may question the believability of such a smoking-hot babe as a ranger in the wilderness, but let me tell you a story: Last July I was primitive camping at Great Basin National Park in Nevada, which is about as desolate as you can get in the USA, and one morning I went for a solo hike in the high timber. In the area I was in I didn't see one other person the whole 2 hours except for a ranger at the trailhead checking the hiker sign-in box. This woman was gorgeous from head to toe with incredible eyes and a bright smile; on top of this she was genuinely friendly. A few days later I was visiting Craters of the Moon in Idaho and brushed with another ranger cutie, albeit blond. So, yeah, it's definitely true-to-life.
- The story maintains a serious tone throughout -- this is no goof-fest like ""Lake Placid.""
- The creature, when fully revealed in the third act, is well done and slightly reminiscent of the main gargoyle in 1972's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gargoyles/dp/B004S8UTII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gargoyles</a>"" and The Creeper in 2001's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeepers-Creepers/dp/B00005RHGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeepers Creepers</a>"" and its&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeepers-Creepers-2/dp/B002Q32OQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeepers Creepers 2</a>. The creature has some interesting qualities (!!SPOILER!!) It's female and, even though it likes to play headgames with its victims, it possesses some nurturing qualities.
- Native American Eric Schweig has a small part as the Indian sage. Yes, it's a stereotypical, hackneyed part but it's official tradition for this type of flick (see ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prophecy/dp/B00005RDAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prophecy</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-Thing/dp/B0009A409S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man-Thing</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clawed-The-Legend-of-Sasquatch/dp/B000EPFCKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clawed - The Legend of Sasquatch</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Orca-The-Killer-Whale/dp/B000MD9WCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Orca: The Killer Whale</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grizzly/dp/B000CSTKDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grizzly</a>,"" etc.)! Anyway, you might remember Eric from 1992's ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and 2003's ""The Missing."" He gained quite a bit of weight in the meantime.
- The British Columbian locations are gorgeous, filmed a mere four miles outside of Vancouver; you'd never know it while viewing, however.
- Steven R. Monroe is adept at doing these low-budget tv flicks in a classy, professional manner. He also directed 2009's well-done ""Wyvern"" and ""Sasquatch Mountain."" If you appreciated those flicks you'll likely enjoy this one.
- Some complain about the score and songs chosen but I like the music in Monroe's films. He strives for the dramatic and emotionally-stirring rather than cliched horror, e.g. ""Friday the 13th."" Monroe knows full-well he's not making ""Citizen Kane"" and that these are essentially (supposedly) throw-away tv horror flicks but he does his best to make a classy, worthy product. Gotta respect that.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:

- Aside from the film's aforementioned lack of originality, this is a low-budget tv flick and is therefore not as technically good as ""Alien"" and ""Prophecy,"" the films from which it heavily borrows, but this isn't overly obvious.
- Like those films ""It Waits"" has a very slow build up. I know everyone always raves about ""Alien"" -- and I'm a fan (although I prefer the sequel ""Aliens"") -- but it does have a plodding vibe. This approach can be boring unless you're braced for it or in a kicked-back mood.
- It's commendable that the filmmakers attempt to give us some depth with the subplot of Danny's struggle over a drunken car accident, but it's not nearly as moving as ""Sasquatch Mountain,"" which reaches for depth and largely achieves it (yes, despite the Bigfoot trappings).
- Aside from the opening cave massacre, ultra-horror fans may be disappointed by the low body count.
- Some cite the relatively moderate gore but I saw quite a bit. Are beheadings, headless corpses and impalings thru the rear-end mediocre gore?

BOTTOM LINE: ""It Waits"" is a must for Cerina Vincent fans and those who enjoy monster-in-the-woods flicks, or both. It's well-done for what it is, although we've seen (a lot of) it before. Still, this is a classy horror flick with some notable aspects, like the nature of the creature, the protagonist's stuggle with guilt and the non-horror soundtrack.

2460684,2,B000CEXF5G,"It Waits (Steven R. Monroe, 2005)

I was just reviewing another Monroe movie (Ogre, above), then I'm paging through the headers of the movies I haven't reviewed yet, and I find another Monroe joint. So if you've read that one, you probably have a good idea of how this review is going to pan out. I might as well just come right out with it: there are three certainties in life. They are death, taxes, and the badness of Steven R. Monroe movies.

It Waits for Cerina Vincent (Fashion Victim), who here plays Danny, a forest ranger with some recent demons in her past that have been driving her to drink. She's alone in a secluded section of the woods one weekend when all the other forest rangers have been called off to an emergency in another part of the forest. Or she thinks she's alone until her boyfriend Justin (Iron Eagle IV's Dominic Zamprogna) shows up. Now, Danny has been thinking of Justin as an ex, but she hasn't gotten around to telling him that. Welcome to tensionville. Things get a lot worse when they find out they're not the only ones in the woods--a long-dormant demon/monster/thing that's been awakened by blasting is out there with them, and the only one who knows about it besides the only two to have seen it and survive is an old Indian (Skins' Eric Schweig) who remembers his tribe's old tales about the beast and how to send it back to its dormancy. Why, oh why, is it always an old Indian? (A stretch for Schweig, who was under forty at the time the movie was made.)

The old-Indian clich should tip you off to the amount of thought that went into the script. Pretty much everything here is a clich, dressed up with some different monster makeup and a couple of ludicrous subplots aimed at developing Cerina Vincent's character. Every time I see Vincent in a movie, I think that somewhere under there is a good actress straining to get out, but she shows up in such awful movies that she never gets the chance to really spread her wings. I can't say the same about anyone else here, as the rest of the cast is comprised of either flat-out bad actors or capable actors who simply can't do anything with the awful script they were given (Schweig is the obvious example here). The movie is trite, silly, and all-around awful, though in its defense it does have the best creature effects I've seen in a Steven R. Monroe movie. Still, that's not nearly enough to recommend it. Avoid. * ",1243814400,,2411,4.485193621867881
2460685,3,B000CEXF5G,"A sexy but unstable forest ranger named Danny (Cerina Vincent - the naked chick from Not Another Teen Movie) who recently lost a friend seeks refuge within a Smirnoff bottle.  Along with a hilariously prophetic and verbose parrot named Hoppy (who steals every scene), and an underdeveloped love interest with a barely post-pubescent pseudo Jake Gyllenhal, she has various responsibilities, to include searching for lost hikers or the bodies of a massacred archaelogical dig.  Little does Danny know - mostly because she's a morally loose, easy, drunk emotional wreck - that the college archaeologists unearthed an alien, skeleton zombie (ASZ) of some kind.  In the words of Hoppy before every tense scene, ""Uh oh.""

With a complex understanding of electronics, engines, and a rudimentary concept of pulley-based booby traps, ASZ is a formidable foe.  Factor in the strength to lift a jeep, the ability to jump 20+ feet, and claws that make Freddy's knives look like a fresh manicure, and there's a guaranteed gutting on the horizon.  Oh, it gets better.  My boy FASZ (Freddy Alien Skeleton Zombie) alos likes to leave mangled and decapitated body parts for survivors to discover, and voyeuristically watches their shock from behind a row of trees (think flaming bag of poo on the doorstep, but for psychopathic monsters).  Playful AND murderous!  Look for the corpse dinner table and the anal Indian impalement scenes; they're a hoot.

I won't ruin the ending, or spoil the surprise, but the lead up to the final battle involves a rural alarm system of tin cans on a string, some of the worst marksmanship in cinema history, and a ridiculous Native American mumbo-jumbo lecture about cross-dimensional demons or something.

Overall the production, music, sets, scenes, and gore are fairly well done.  Nothing spectacular, but nothing incompetent.  Cerina Vincent is beautiful throughout.  The only downside of the movie is final unveiling of the monster, which looks so much like the Jeepers Creepers beast that this may as well have been the prequel.  Overall, it's lacking true scare, and most of the typical horror fare, but it's still enjoyable enough for sadistic horror fans to cheer for FASZ.",1240963200,,2199,5.120448179271708
2460686,3,B000CEXF5G,"It Waits is a moderately entertaining flick.  It's not compelling, but has its moments. Some genuine scares, a terrifically scenic wilderness setting, and a charming but flawed heroine (the mammiferous, mass of tangled curls known as Cerina Vincent) help propel the story.  Danielle (Vincent) is a forest ranger spending a lonely and besotted existence in the observatory that is both her job location and her escape from the outside world.  She is drenched with guilt over the loss of her BFF, who died in a vehicle accident for which Danielle feels responsible.  What jerks her back to reality is the appearance of estranged boyfriend and fellow ranger Justin, who drops by for a ""sleepover"".  Interrupting the healing process is a strange, powerful unseen ""rogue animal"" who begins wreaking havoc and claiming victims in the woods.  As Justin and Danielle fight for survival, it becomes clear that this is no ordinary denizen of the forest.  Danielle learns that a monster from Native American legend has been unleashed, and she must figure out a way to stop its rampage and escape the mountain alive.

As reviewers have noted, the story and its presentation are quite ordinary, drawing upon several previous and better films for inspiration.  As with all such similar plots, this one is aided by behaviors that make viewers wonder ""Why don't they just...?"" or ""Why didn't she..?""  Unlike other reviewers, I felt that Vincent did a creditable acting job, and I didn't mind the back story about the death of the girlfriend, because it injected her character with some vulnerability.  What I do take issue with is the treatment of the monster in the final climactic scenes.  Up to that point, the creature has been barely glimpsed, and only then under cover of darkness.  This heightened the tension, leading the viewers to wonder, like Danielle and Justin, just what the heck they were dealing with.  Once the monster makes a daytime appearance, it proves to be one of the ugliest conceptions since ""Alien"" and ""Predator"".  But then too much CGI takes over, and what had been a wily, elusive and destructive force begins to feel fake and less formidable.  The final confrontation seems somewhat rushed and the denouement is rather lengthy, although not inappropriate.  In all, the film is both predictable and different.  Some viewers may come away dissatisfied with both aspects.  But I think It Waits provides decent escapist fare - just not enough to appear at the top of anyone's wish list.",1224892800,,2496,4.9855072463768115
2460687,4,B000CEXF5G,"This movie surprised me.  I wasn't sure about it at first.  Cerina is awesome.  She is why I thought this one worked. The monster was brutal and I liked how it played emotional games.  I saw it twice already and would probably watch it again.  Now you also have to understand that it will be a little cheesy, but that helps me to get through some of them better.  I say watch it!  give it a chance.  I think you may be surprised.",1221350400,,429,4.0843373493975905
2460688,3,B000CEXF5G,"Let's face it, if you are picking up ""It Waits"", you aren't looking for a well acted, plot driven film. Most likely you are hoping for a standard ""creature feature"", maybe some blood, maybe a nifty rubber & latex creature out to cause mayhem and maybe a little suspense thrown in. If that is what you are looking for, then ""It Waits"" fits the bill. Cerina Vincent is quietly becoming a fun Scream Queen to look for. She provides a nice little perfomance here, not relying on her...ummm assets...to carry her scenes. This time around Cerina Vincent plays a US Forest Ranger hunted by ""something"" that has been awakened by some pesky college archeologists. I'm not sure what the ""something"" is, the Indian professor who conveniently shows up two-thirds of the way through the flick to give us that handy info, isn't too clear, and he isn't really around long enough to give further explanation or clarify. That's okay though, I don't need too much back-story, and I'm not really looking for plausability in a flick called ""It Waits"" either. Just get the creature out there hunting the campers quickly and I'm happy.
The only real downside to the film was the lack of victims. I would have preferred this thing get a few more kills in before setting it's sights on Cerina and company. Just a few odds and ends campers, folks lost in the mountains, a small hillbilly community. The low body count was a drawback for me.
On the plus side, ""It Waits"" features mostly old school special effects. I'm sick of CGI monsters, and it was nice to see a genuine ""guy in a rubber suit"" creature. It's old school fun. The blood, while not very heavy, is effectively spilled when done as well.
If you are looking for genuine scares, maybe you should pass on ""It Waits"" for something else, but if you just want a fun Saturday late night creature feature flick, then give this one a shot.",1219708800,,1869,4.598802395209581
2460699,5,B000CEXF5G,A good roller coaster ride! Terror in the deep dark woods with Cerina Vincent. What more could you want in a Horror B movie? Cerina carries the movie in an almost solo performance. Good FX and acting. Don't Wait on this one.,1218585600,,224,4.357142857142857
2460700,1,B000CEXF5G,"Going into this I was hoping to see some good old fashioned low budget B horror. When done right, a low budget film can be just a good as anything out there. Either they can turn out to be really solid well written works or be so bad that they are hilarious. This one was neither. It fell into that desperate middle spot where it wasn't anything except boring. I really couldn't even get any laughs out of it.

The main character is played by the attractive Cerina Vincent who is primarily known for horrific acting and showing off her um..expensive assests. She plays a park ranger who spends every waking moment hitting the bottle and staying depressed over her friends accidental death. While completely intoxicated she speaks with someone in her organization who informs her she will be on her own in the woods because they had to pull some of her back up. I could explain a little more of the story but I won't even bother. Bottom line is some creature starts tearing up people it finds throughout the woods and juggs with her terrible acting is the one who has to stop it. You barely get to see the creature and finally when you do you'll wish you didn't. It looked like a rip off of the creature in Jeepers Creepers only much cheaper.

I would say ""It Waits"" should wait on your list of films to watch. It has nothing to offer in the field of entertainment unless you are a big Cerina Vincent fan. Then you get to watch her run around in a nice white tank top a show while she is destined to be in these type films forever.",1212883200,,1530,4.327526132404182

Very bad acting, very bad direction and a slow boring plot. the monster looked silly and nothing special, the special effects were really bad,
there was nothing professional about it, it was as if it was made by some amateurs..a very low budget movie that really sucked..
It starts with an attractive forest ranger who is going through what seems to be an emotional trauma because she lost her friend in a road traffic accident, and she has feelings of guilt, then hikers start dissapearing and getting killed, and its up to this psychologicaly traumatized girl to save the day and face the demons of the monster !! so cliched ! and the directiong really sucked with the type of scenes when the monster attacks, you don't really see it, but the director makes the veiwers as the eyes of the monster and you start seeing the victims running away from the camera..very silly !
I actually couldn't continue watching to the end, i really couldn't and stopped after about an hour, but im guessing the ending wouldn't add much to this mess..

2460702,4,B000CEXF5G,"""It Waits"" begins with a group exploring a cave and unleashing the titular ""It,"" which promptly kills them all (off screen). Fast forward a bit, and we meet Forest Ranger Danielle St. Claire (Cerina Vincent), who is the sole tenant of a Ranger station deep in the forest. Having survived a car accident that killed her friend, Danielle is trying to find solace in the bottle to assuage the guilt that she feels because she was the one driving. Her boyfriend arrives, and Danielle confesses her role in the accident to him. Before the night is over, though, the tower is attacked by an unseen creature that destroys the sole transportation from the tower, a Jeep, and sabotages the communications. Before long, the creature kills two campers and turns its attention to Danielle and her boyfriend.

This film is hard to assess. On the negative side, it is entirely predictable, so much so that I felt as if I had the script in hand and were reading ten pages ahead. The disparate aspects of the plot (i.e., Danielle's grief and the creature's murderous spree) do not mesh well or indeed much at all. There is also an attempt to link the creature to a vague, apparently Native American, mythology, but this attempt falls flat--very flat, in fact. Danielle comes upon someone who seems to know about the creature, lectures her, and provides her with something to read so that she can defeat the thing. As it happens, though, these elements play almost no role in the film's resolution, and they seem pointless as a result.

On the other hand, there are a great number of things that work well in ""It Waits."" Foremost among the positives is Cerina Vincent, who must carry a large part of the film since she is the only human on screen for long periods of time. The scenes with her boyfriend (Dominic Zamprogna) seem genuine, and both actors make their relationship thoroughly believable. Vincent's vulnerability and Zamprogna's support amply convey an implicit longstanding relationship and a back story that make the characters seem much more real. Their scenes are accompanied by a couple very nice songs (especially ""Believe in Me"" by Melanie Monroe, who was previously unknown to me).

Danielle's vulnerability early in the film contrasts nicely with her strength in the second half of the film. Determined to stop the creature, Danielle finds the strength to fight, but this strength is not so over-the-top that her past is forgotten.

The strengths of ""It Waits"" outweighed the flaws for me. The beautiful scenery, the masterful performance by Vincent, and the good, old-fashioned sense of suspense here made the eighty minutes enjoyable. As I write this, though, I am aware that there are several negative reviews here. I am not entirely sure why those who wrote the reviews were so unimpressed by the film, but I wonder whether they expected something more like most contemporary horror films. In trying to come up with a similar film, I kept thinking of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creature-from-the-Black-Lagoon/dp/B0002NRRRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creature from the Black Lagoon</a>.

2460704,1,B000CEXF5G,"It Waits is one of those modern day, low budget horror snooze fests that we've been getting a lot of lately, and it's abysmal from start to finish.  Cerina Vincent (from Cabin Fever, whose large ""attractions"" are the only thing that'll keep your eyes on the screen) stars as an alcoholic forest ranger (yes, you read that right) who gets stalked by a murderous, blood thirsty creature (because there are no other kinds) from Native American mythology that makes short work of her boyfriend and a few hikers.  Normally, under the right circumstances, I try to be understanding of a low budget horror flick of this type, but everything about it so bad from the wooden acting, creaky attempt at giving Vincent a weak backstory, and the poppy soft-rock is about as welcome here as a claw in the guts.  The gore and makeup are halfway decent, but that's it.  Beyond bad, avoid.",1162598400,16,872,4.6797385620915035

2460707,2,B000CEXF5G,"Some monster chases some girl around in the woods.  The scenery is gorgeous and the setting excellent;  one of those ranger towers way up above the forest canopy.  Unfortunately, all the other reviewers are dead on when they say this thing is a Lifetime movie of the week.  The main character spends the first half of the movie wallowing in a pool of self pity over causing the accidental death of her friend in a drunk driving accident.  We get numerous flashbacks.  All this crap has absolutely nothing to do with the plot of the movie, it's just filler and tedius dreck filler at that.  The theme music absolutely sucks - it would be more appropriate for a movie about a heroine addict slowly spiraling into oblivion.

The movie gets better in the last half, but by then it's way too late.  The dialogue has a real TV show quality about it as well, witless and not at all realistic.  I give it two stars for the setting and the hot babe, but it's a complete failure as a horror movie.  These people have no clue what they're doing in this genre.",1153094400,17,1048,4.40625

I didn't quite catch where this was supposed to be occurring but from the references to North Arizona University (NAU) and Bryce Canyon, I am assuming it takes place in either Northern Arizona or Southern Utah. In neither location will you find rain forest but you will in Canada where they actually shot the film. Putting that bit of irritant aside, along with the Native American myth angle, this is a well done, well acted film. The protagonist is a forest ranger who is drinking her problems away. Ultimately, her cat-and-mouse game with the demon (who is the ""playful"" cat) forces her to confront and own up to the issue she was trying to drink into oblivion.",1515801600,,776,4.798507462686567

Vincent also never seems very terrified or really even that scared or bothered when people do start to die. There is some decent low budget gore, but we don't get to see the monster nearly enough, and there really aren't any cool kill shots.

8098374,4,B000CEXF5G,"Written by Richard Christian Matheson, son of the legendary Richard Matheson but a fine horror writer in his own right, It Waits is a surprisingly high quality low-budget horror film. Cerina Vincent stars as our heroine, a Forest Ranger tortured by the death of her best friend and drinking herself deeper into oblivion every day. But when a strange creature escapes from the forest-shrouded cavern in which it has been imprisoned for centuries, she must overcome her personal troubles and rise up to face the evil that is hunting her.

It Waits benefits from several factors, not the least of them being Cerina Vincent's personal charisma. The beautiful actress makes her character come to life, and at least as much of the story involves her struggles with her inner demons as it does her fight to the finish with the monster from the forest in which she finds herself stranded. The forest itself is virtually a character in its own right, stretching ominous and implacable in every direction around Vincent's watchtower, harboring secrets and even demons in its black shadows. As for the monster, it is a fearsome one, and one which reeks of evil insatiable. Interestingly, the demon seems to possess a vile sense of humor--no, it never blurts out any ridiculous one-liners, or for that matter ever speaks at all, so don't worry--but it does enjoy stalking and terrorizing its prey, toying with them until it swoops in for the kill.

Suspense is well-managed, and the characters caught up in the monster's wrath generally behave realistically given the bizarre situation they are in. Special effects are minimal but sufficient when utilized, and while not as gory as some might wish the film still offers up several brutal and bloody moments. An effective low-budget horror film that deserves a bigger audience than it has reached so far, It Waits is efficiently written and executed and is a great showcase for the gifted Cerina Vincent. At times chilling and blessed with great atmosphere from beginning to end, It Waits is just waiting for another viewer to give it a chance.",1438387200,,2081,4.942857142857143

8098378,4,B000CEXF5G,"I have an abiding fondness for monster movies (good and bad).  While this one does lose points for style, it sticks to the rules of the genre long enough to be satisfying.  The plot involves a forest ranger with a deep dark secret that gets shown and shown and shown in way too many flashbacks (a better use of that wasted time could have been served in setting up the story).  The main character (Cerina Vincent as Danny) is a bit on the mopey side of whiny, she's quickly joined in the forest by her boyfriend Justin (Dominic Zamprogna), he's an enabler.  By the time they realize they're not dealing with a bear or an elk, it's too late for a lot of people.  Sadly, most of the murderous rampage is done off screen, the results revealed later.  Delayed reaction doesn't always serve horror best.  The monster is fairly well designed but rarely seen to good effect.  I would have liked to have seen more of the monster, less of Vincent brooding.  The last half of this movie is better than the first half.  It could have used a few more rewrites.  It's by no means a great monster movie.  (There's also way too many intrusive songs shoved in for ambiance.)
