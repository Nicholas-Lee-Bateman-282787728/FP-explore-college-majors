2638662,4,B000HKKZQ2,"""If Hitler is dehumanized and shown only as a devil, any future Hitler may not be recognized, simply because he is a human being."" - Intro to Swastika

Adolf Hitler, the Fuhrer of Germany and the dictator who will be remembered as the evil devil incarnate of modern history which led to the death of eleven million people.

Through many staged videos shot during the 1930's, the images that people have seen of Hitler was the military leader who would transformer the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship which was based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism (National Socialism which incorporated biological racism and antisemitism).

But what many people have a difficult time understanding is how can millions of people follow such an evil man?  How can they look up to this person who preached hatred?

Fastforward decades after World War II and the death of Adolf Hitler and his bride, Eva Braun (in April 1945, as the Red Army closed in on Berlin, Eva killed herself by biting into a cyanide capsule while Hitler shot himself in the head with a pistol).

Philippe Mora and Lutz Becker had wondered about how can people follow someone like Hitler?  What kind of research material is available?  And through their research, what was found were the home videos of Adolf Hitler captured by Eva Braun.  Never touched or viewed by the American military who confiscated it.  So, this is 16 mm footage that has never been seen since they were in the possession of the Hitlers until 1973.

Both Mora and Lutz found eight hours of home videos showcasing video taken by Eva Braun but also footage that no one has ever seen of Adolf Hitler before.  Away from the staged military propaganda films, Mora and Becker assembled the footage along with other historical footage to show how people of Germany fell for Hitler and why they followed him.  The power of propaganda film could help ignite the nation to back a leader, which many soldiers vowed to God to follow Hitler and his ideology.

And thus ""Swastika"" was created.  A controversial documentary featuring banal home videos but showcasing a side of the evil leader among his family and friends and inter-weaved with propaganda footage as we see Hitler with Eva Braun, with children, dogs and being shown as a compassionate and beloved leader.

For the film, the audio-less footage which was overdubbed (but verified by those who were featured in the film and also by German lip readers) by actors and featured music, and while the film received a tumultuous reception at the Cannes Film Festival in 1973 (to put it bluntly, a fist fight among the audience had taken place), the film was also banned in Germany for 37 years until 2010 in worries that the humanistic footage of Hitler may inspire Neo-Nazi's, nor did they want footage to be shown of a time when Germans absolute adored their ""charismatic"" leader.

The film had been used as educational tools for universities as a way of understanding Nazism but also to engage viewers of why the documentary was deemed as controversial.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Swastika"" is presented in 1:33 Full Frame and in color and black and white.  As expected from a documentary featuring older footage, footage was restored back in 1973 but the fact that Eva Braun's video were not tampered with, the quality was very good considering the age of the film.  According to Lutz Becker, the film was shot using American 16mm color stock, Ektachrome.

For the most part, picture quality is very good for archived and historical footage and the editing of putting together Eva Braun's home video along with propaganda and Nazi film were done well, although some may find the home videos quite banal as they are old home videos.

As for audio, while the audio was dubbed by actors utilizing research by German lipreaders to people who were featured in the film, it gives you an idea of what types of conversations were being discussed on the home video.

JUDGMENT CALL:

He has been called a demon.  A murderer.  And his name will be forever linked to hatred and evil... Adolf Hitler.

There is no forgiving a man who led to massive atrocities and the deaths of millions but it's important to remember that he is also human and that one human can inspire a country to do horrific things.  How is this possible?  How can this even happen?

As a person who loves watching documentaries especially to see a city and lifestyle of a time period that is no more, I am also fascinated by watching footage of propaganda films that have been used to fool a country and disguising the truth of their people.

""Swastika"" is rather intriguing in a historical sense because in other footage,  the most vile person of this century, Adolf Hitler, typically shown as a dictator, shown during his speeches but mostly as a military leader.  But with ""Swastika"" and the home video footage shot by Eva Braun, we see a side of Hitler that no one has seen before.

We see footage of a man discussing hunting of a bore with his colleagues, the discussion with his colleagues (such as Hermann Goering and Joseph Goebbels) of the young children that look up to him as a hero, the dictator out walking his dogs and of course, his time with his Nazi soldiers and also with his mistress Eva Braun, as she stretches and has fun in the water with her dog.  Shots taken at Hitler's Bavarian mountain retreat in Berghof in Obersalzberg.

But by no means was ""Swastika"" trying to show the good-side of Hitler.  The film was banned from Germany for 37-years in fear that the documentary's humanistic approach may make Hitler look like a good guy than an demon.  In fact, because of the home videos of Hitler...people were so uncomfortable at Cannes that a fight broke out in the audience.  It's a controversial film but this is an anti-Nazi film that shows how a nation was fooled by Hitler's grasp on the city.  The control that the Third Reich had in instilling this belief in men, women and children.  But a film that shows that evil tyrants are human and it's important to show how a human can lead a country to do terrible things.

It's important to also note that the director, Philippe Mora is Jewish and when he took on the goal to make Swastika a film, it was during a time he wanted to document the making of Albert Speer's (a photographer for Adolf Hitler and friend of Eva Braun) book about the Third Reich.

Also interesting is how the film came about.  According to various news sources, including an interview with Australia publication, ""The Age"", Mora began to become interested in the project when he saw a photo of Eva Braun in a book and she was holding a 16 mm camera.  Lutz Becker then tried to find out more information and talked to an army officer who was part of the raiding party at Berghof and was told that ""a pile of cans"" had been taken away.  Becker contacted the Pentagon and it was revealed that a bunch of film cans were found in Eva Braun's bedroom and when they received permission to look at it, there were eight hours of footage with only a fraction being used for ""Swastika"", footage featuring Adolf Hitler.  And the footage featured Hitler with Goebbels, Goering, Himmler, Heydrich, Eva and her sisters and Hitler's dog Blondi.

But the question that has been raging since 1973 when it comes to ""Swastika"" was will this documentary humanize Adolf Hitler or will people see the anti-Nazi message of this film.

It's one thing to have seen footage of similar situations in North Korea with the late Kim Jong-il and seeing his near rock-star presence to his countrymen, the tight grasp the country has on what their people can see on television and seeing their propaganda films that reinforce their belief in their leader, their country and their goal to have this Aryan utopia.

""Swastika"" shows us along with the home video footage these other historical footage of how thousands of people were enchanted by Hitler, women going so far to jump barriers to see him.

To see y0ung German soldiers making an oath to God that they will follow their leader, to see child soldiers fighting each other and then are back to marching.  To see these young women sing in glee to their leader and to see even American Olympic champion Jesse Owens smiling to the camera and talking about how great the German people are and actually praising the treatment he received during the 12th Summer Olympics in Berlin.

But when you look at the history of dictators, they all have similarity in the fact that they controlled communication and people saw their leader as charismatic and wonderful.  And while the film does showcase Germans being wooed by their leader, we are also given that image of what their had lead them to do as we see images of dead Jewish people, nearly skeletal as they are being bulldozed and buried.

The German people were so ignorant of what was going on around them that they were continually fed the good news about their leader and the Third Reich. One story that Philippe Mora had told was of a sculptor who worked with Hitler and when he saw the documentary, he felt everything featured in ""Swastika"" was factual until the part of the Jews being bulldozed and insisted that the video footage was constructed by Hollywood.

As for the DVD release of ""Swastika"", viewers are treated with an insightful filmmakers discussion plus discussion about the manipulation of the people and the power of Nazi propaganda, classic interviews with Lutz Becker and also Albert Speer, the use of color film in Nazi Germany and also conversation of the amorality of filmmaker/actress Leni Riefenstahl who worked with Hitler.

Overall, ""Swastika"" is an intriguing documentary especially with the home video footage of Hitler/Braun which I have never seen before and many others haven't.  But as far as the argument goes and the worries about whether or not this documentary will humanize Hitler, my feeling is that it's all subjective on the viewer.  This film is obviously an anti-Nazi film when watched from beginning to end but it's also a film that easily shows us that the worst in humanity can be disguised through propaganda and how many people believed in it.

For those who are interested in older historical footage  of Germany especially the Nazification of the German population, will find ""Swastika"" to be a surprising and possibly disturbing documentary.",1335571200,2,11900,4.8088452088452085
2638663,5,B000HKKZQ2,"I found this to be quite enjoyable. I have only read a short documentary of Hitler before this dvd, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-the-Third-Reich-A-History-of-Nazi-Germany/dp/1451651686/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany</a>&nbsp;is sitting on my desk waiting to be read, so this came as a welcome view of 1933-39 Germany through the eyes of Germany itself at a time where I am searching to know more. It's really not hard to see how they fell for Hitler's deception when you look at it like this...

The makers of the dvd are trying to show Hitler's more human side (which is made clear) so that we can avoid having another Hitler pop up in the future somewhere. I found it to be quite intriguing in that regard as Hitler didn't seem that far off your average, well, any politician could fit into the shoes this footage shows him in.

I recommend this!",1332806400,2,979,5.35064935064935
2638664,4,B000HKKZQ2,"Thought this documentary quite informative with some new information. Good addition to your collection with film footage I had not seen before,so if you have an interest in this dark time in world history it's well worth having",1331424000,,227,5.0
2638665,3,B000HKKZQ2,"If only we could get unaltered, unpoliticized footage from that era, as this seemed to promise. As the movie starts you have to sit there and watch a swastika move all over the screen with this eerie music playing in the background like some 60s/70s startrek film. And then you watch all this incoherent footage. There was no meaning to it. You just sat and watch Adolf play with a dog. Then it cut to him making a speech. THen it cut to Jessee Owens in the Olympics talking on camera about how great Germany was him to. Then it cut to Adolf lounging around with some women. Then it cut to Adolf talking to some children. Then the ending (of course this had to be shoved in there) was of a bulldozer pushing bodies into a pit . . . the makers of this ""film"" would have us assume (given the hysteria built up around this man and Germany of WWII that time) these were victimized Jews. But if watch with an open mind you will see just what the prologue says--a man. Not a monster. Not a superhuman alien being with mystical powers that some would like Adolf to be . . . known as ""Hitler"" . . . like it is his first and last name . . . but you see a man. A man who looks tired in some footage. Playful in others. Soft spoken and speaking in a normal tone in speeches not screaming and foaming at the mouth like most ""historical"" footage of him and this era. You see him reciting a pledge and the German officers repeating it . . . including their allegiance to ""God"", not to the Devil as American history books would have us think. You hear the British PM talk about how England declared war ""on"" Germany for not withdrawing troops from Poland, not that Germany invaded England running all the Londerners underground like Hollywood movies would have you think. You see protestors trying to disrupt his speeches. You hear him singing/saying ""Glod Bless America"". You see aerial footage of a totally destroyed Berlin, not the partying whooping it up hey dayers that movies would have you think of Germans during this time. You see Adolf going to an art museum and attending an art parade. You hear him playing around with some women at his house talking about Clark Gable and their liking of ""Gone with the wind"". So in other words you get glimmers of who he really was, not the rotten to the core villain complete with horns coming out of his  temples and poison dripping from his veins instead of blood certain groups in the US have to make him out to be to keep their political and economic livelihoods going strong. The captions were hardly readable as they were in white and the background they were supposed to be ""commentary"" on (not labeling for) was light. But you could make enough of them to see that they were very politicized . . . one read ""Hitler's Propaganda Minister"" or something like that . . . in other words it is was his Press Secretary or the equivalent of the US Chairman of the Democratic or Republican Parties. If you watch enough of these documentaries you begin to get some semblance of what really was going on back then . . . something you don't get from the fictional Schindler's List and other dramatizations of WWII. There is a British documentary on here that showed how the concentration camps came about . . . how those were not the goal or drive of the nazis. Etc. Anyway . . . this is somewhat useful but mainly boring and very typically propagandistic for the subject matter.",1328659200,5,3408,4.40095087163233
2638666,3,B000HKKZQ2,"For those who are avid students of WW II, those who have seen the better WW II documentary films and those who watch a lot of The Military Channel and The History Channel on cable, 90% of the Berghof footage is old news. A lot of the Nuremberg footage is well known. There is a very short scene of one of the Braun sisters skinny dipping up in the mountains which was new to me. Yes,they played with their doggies, sipped tea, doted over the children, frolicked in the Alpine meadows and murdered millions. There are numerous scenes of ordinary Germans doing mundane things especially Bavarian farmers who look like Appalachian hillbillies. There is some interesting footage of German kids going to summer (indoctrination)camp and it looks like everybody in Germany wore a uniform. Look at the faces of the people in the huge crowds and you can see and feel the hysterical ""fatal attraction"" Hitler had over these people. This film is an excellent slice of German life from 1933 to 1939. The ironies are overwhelming. It is well worth watching.",1326412800,45,1044,4.741758241758242
2638667,5,B000HKKZQ2,"Home movies of Hitler with Goering & Goebbels & Eva & the gang (much of it at der Berghof, much shot by Eva), a bit of Bormann, Himmler, & Speer as well, interspersed with plenty of domestic documentary footage, predominantly from 1933 to 1939.

Eva exhibitionistically posing in a swimsuit whilst hanging from a lakeshore tree branch; Adolf lovingly petting a German shepherd, & elsewhere observing that a recreational-boar-hunting ""Gring should go into the forest with a spear."" A squadron of planes flying in perfect swastika formation, Neville Chamberlain's declarations of triumphant diplomacy, even Jesse Owens praising his hosts' treatment at the 12th Olympics.

These were gay, heady times in the Third Reich, and the camera was there to capture it. Fairly fascinating to hear Adolf talk in a calm, conversational tone without spewing venom, and even more refreshing to endure no predictably prejudising Allied-oriented narration, even when things inexorably but slowly begin to take a darker turn in the last third of the film, and der Juden problem begins to emerge (to which a recently fled Einstein vaguely makes a public response).

Quite enlightening to just slowly take it in and in a measured manner comprehend for yourself what you're seeing; thank you, Mr. Mora, for that liberty. Released in the year 1973 (apparently causing something of a riot at its Cannes premiere), was banned im Deutschland for the next 36 for fear that seeing the human side of Hitler would de-demonize him. (The director followed up this effort with his first feature film, Mad Dog Morgan with Dennis Hopper.)

Among the special features (in the Australian version of the DVD, at least), the Leni Riefenstahl attack piece has received both praise and excoriation.",1325980800,9,1757,5.15438596491228
2638668,5,B000HKKZQ2,"This is an absolutely fascinating look at pre-war Nazi Germany.  The film attempts and I believe succeeds in allowing the viewer to experience what it was like to live in Germany prior to the Second World War.  This was before the bombings, death camps and all the horrors that are now associated with the words Nazi and Adolf Hitler.  Hitler as well as his inner circle are shown in a manner that makes them all too human and, for me; quite easy to relate to on a human level.  That alone would make the film worth watching but what I really found extremely powerful was seeing how much the German people idolized Hitler and watching it could understand why.  The film was vilified when it first opened and considered by many pro Nazi because it lets the viewer interpret this material for themselves.  This is a film that doesn't ""tell"" the viewer anything.  It is a film that makes the viewer experience something radically different and having experienced it forces them to understand exactly what they have experienced.  If you have ever asked yourself ""why Nazi Germany"", this film will set you on the road to answering that question.  In my opinion, the film's preface says everything:  ""If the human features of Hitler are lacking in the image of him that is passed onto posterity, if he is dehumanized and shown only as a devil, any future Hitler may not be recognized, simply because he is human being.""  Swastika is a one-of-a-kind must see film.",1276387200,50,1457,4.674509803921569
2638669,4,B000HKKZQ2,"Swastika was really quite an excellent film and the DVD release quality is very good. The only bad elements about the DVD were the grandiose commentaries by the original production team, which are peppered with inaccuracies, distortions and , pardon the term, propaganda. Buy the DVD, watch the film, avoid the so called ""special features"". There is an especially vicious little vignette on ""The Leni Riefenstahl Myth"" which undoubtedly has her spinning in her grave.",1160438400,28,467,5.24
2638670,4,B000HKKZQ2,"I first saw this documentary in 1976.  It took several days for me to shake the chilling, disturbing effect it had on me at the time.  I just bought the DVD and watched about half of it.  It still has the same effect, particularly if you have not seen it before.

What makes it so upsetting?  It's not what you've come to expect in a documentary about Nazi Germany.  This is the Nazis through their own eyes.  The entire film is archival footage from the time.  There is no narration.  There are no post-facto talking heads.  In short, there is no editorializing, and, lacking that, you start to see why the German people were willing to follow such evil people.

The bulk of the film is from before the war.  The highlight is Eva Braun's home movies of Hitler and the Nazi leadership.  We see Hitler relaxing at Obersalzburg, talking to friends, greeting children, petting dogs.  As the film says at the beginning, it is necessary to see the human face of evil in order to recognize it the next time.",1156377600,79,1001,4.458563535911602

It doesn't have a lot of dialogue, but has the actual characters of the era with subtitles throughout.

But with no commentary and with the actual German (is it a dubbing or the real thing?) it makes it more interesting to watch. One of the more fascinating clips to me was a short interview of a very young Jesse Owens at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. It not only included the racing clip we typically see but also a 30 second interview on his thoughts about Berlin and the German people.

Hitler talking about how silly it was for Goering to dress up and go shoot a boar was really fascinating as he also stated if he went into the woods to kill a boar with a spear it would be a feat.

2638722,5,B000HKKZQ2,"The overwhelming portion of the footage here is not new to students of the history of Nazi Germany.  The continuity created by the director of this film is the most powerful aspect of this work.  It takes a more sophisticated viewer to understand and to place into context this creation, understanding that concentration camps, death squads and all the other evils of the Nazi regime were established concurrently with these tranquil domestic scenes.  There is no narrative.  The viewer must bring with him- or herself the understanding that this is not a picture of some idyllic pre-war Germany, explaining the German people's acquiescence to something that later turned malevolent.  This is blindness to the suspension of law, the establishment of Dachau, the death of political opponents - all the things that took place right from the very beginning.  The blindness is part of the film.  There has been continuing debate as to whether Eva Hitler was actually the empty-headed know-nothing who documented most of these scenes, or if she knew and ignored the reality.  This film does nothing to answer that question.  You must find the answer elsewhere.",1429401600,,1155,5.101063829787234

With no commentary, occasional translations, and well-chosen footage, we see the Nazi leadership as human beings, and the ego-feeding mob hysteria of many Germans who clearly (and literally) adored Hitler and the ""ideals"" he proclaimed. Mass spectacle, the Olympics, hypnotically rhythmic chanting, songs and marching, marching, marching were all used to great effect. It is clear how so many could be duped into blindly supporting this grotesque ideology. Perhaps one day, we'll have a similar films about ISIS, Pol Pot, and other fanatics, all of whom we dismiss as aberrations, psychotics and lunatics. This film tells us a very different tale.

2638767,5,B000HKKZQ2,"This is a great video which uses the comments and films of the time to express the view people had at the time of Hitler.  The danger we have now is that we often look at Hitler with an assumption that he was a complete monster and obviously always was easily seen as a monster even in 1933.  The reality is much more difficult.  If Hitler had died in a car crash or of a heart attack in say 1935 or 1936 many people would have considered him a great statesman and scholarly papers would have been written describing how despite his ""unfortunate hatred"" of Jews his rule was one of great progress for most Germans.

The most important issue is the obvious one - when one thinks that all moral monsters are completely and totally evil and thus obvious to the view, this stereotype allows one to be complacent and not see the possible dangers in the next such monster who is appealing to the masses for political and/or economic power.  The monstrosity of Hitler and his Germany was not that Hitler could appeal to people but that the faceless bureaucrats and the masses who supported them willingly were complacent in his actions carrying out the dictates which allowed his bloodthirsty actions to be accomplished.  The registrar in the local city hall who kept the careful records of Jews and all others in the community, the railroad scheduler who made sure the trains transporting undesirables to the concentration camps ran promptly with the needed equipment to operate and the others who did their little bit to allow that monstrous dream to be accomplished.  They did not see the caricature we often view in documentaries of Hitler.  Likewise unless we realize reality is not so black and white and thus are always on watch for the banality of evil, we will be at great risk of it happening again and again.",1408579200,4,1812,4.623052959501558

I understand the footage, the time frame, what it is supposed to be about... but I'm really struggling to find a footing in the information being shared. Thus far it's been a few quotes about seeing Hitler as a human being, a bad acid trip technicolor CGI spinning swastika (which lands in the traditional cultural symbolical standing instead of the historically accurate ""tilted"" or ""on edge"" angle that Hitler adopted....leading me to believe that this so called controversial documentary is already being presented in a fashion that's ignorant of the swastika's roots and feel no need to elaborate on why the film is freaking named after the symbol let alone explain why Hitler chose the symbol or even display it as he displayed it when he adopted it... I could rant and rant about the inaccuracy but it may simply boil down to someone being lazy in their need to name their film something that would grab the public's attention long enough for them to try to watch it and they thought a trippy, spinning traditional swastika was a good enough introduction rather than a decent narration about what we are about to see.

Maybe when I'm really bored one day I'll finish this, but I doubt I will.

Actually it was a collection of home movies of things going on in Germany from 1933 to 1939..I had thought that Jesse Owens had been mistreated while at the olympics but his interview while there was very gracious toward the Germans.
I have read that Hitler and his nazis were very angry that a BLACK man could win a gold medal and he won 3.  Maybe he was.
But it also showed how he lived when in his moutain top retreat..I wondered how he was able to spend so much time there.
and Eva Braun...that was an eye opener.  The nude scenes of her surprised me..Guess people in the 30's weren't as moral as they were in the 50's.

""Swastika"", however, shows this evil man in ways that were not posed or choreographed.  Taking in the sun on the open porch at the Eagles Nest, playing with his dog Blondi, talking with his mistress Eva Braun and his lackeys Himmler, Goebbels, Goering are all included.

The film covers mostly the 1930s when it seemed nothing could go wrong for the man or his country.  It would have been better if the producer and director had included scenes from the 1940s, especially toward the end of his life when the war was nearly lost and Hitler was suffering from advanced syphilis.

What the movie shows is what most historians have known for years.  There never was a plan by hitler to engage in mass murder against Jews.  This fact seems to aggravate a lot of folks who for some reason need for the hollow-cost to be a historical fact.  Wake up white people, turn off your tv, put down that beer,  and at least be able to speak your enemies name without apology.  WW2 was about looting Germany, and stealing nazi technology.  All you taxpayers should be the most angry.  The bulk of your federal tax dollars go towards interest on the cost of fighting the Jew war (WW2) and German reparations go to Israel which did not exist during the war, and suffered therefore no damages.

Concept of film is an illustration of the non-militant side of a monster depicting his personal life.  Interesting concept.  Understand the context is not hero worshiping but putting a human face on the most infamous tyrant in history to draw the correlation that monsters look human so be careful.  Old low grade footage.  Needs updating.  From the part I watched before giving up it's not the biography style expected but the boring and outdated video montage style that only film students and directorial academics appreciate.  Not a relevant format medium enjoyable for modern day audiences.  Could be re-rendered to make it relevant.  Modern video editing could have made it acceptable with modern scene transitions and modern voiceover narration.  It leverages personal home video from Hitlers personal library however also leverage lots of old stock footage with grainy audio to tell the story in the montage format.  I get old film will look old but my gripe was the audio track was low, muffled, and dirty.  Additional cleaning of the audio is necessary at a very minimum.  Some A/V purists may blast me as the current format is historically correct for the period blag blag however from a fiscal standpoint where Amazon is licensing the streaming rights for distributors to build their Amazon Prime video library this one did not make the grade as it's inferior A/V quality would only appeal to a limited audience.",1400889600,2,1591,5.0

This movie showed me that he was a frail and scared of impressions as I have been in my life.

If you truly want to get past your hate you need to learn how to love. When you love your enemy you feel their pain. When you feel their pain you are destroying their legacy. You are taking the power from them which they had over others before you.

I am continuously fascinated that the majority of Germans could so easily fall under his spell and later buy into - so completely - his desire to rid the earth of Jewish people. And while this film doesn't shed any new light on that, it does show a side of Hitler that he kept private and actually shows that he was not a monster at all times.

One scene that really hit me was when Hitler was trying to pet his beautiful German Shepherd, Blondie. They say that dogs can detect good or bad in people and to see Blondie shy away - as if she were afraid of being beaten - was really telling. ""Swastika"" isn't the film that reveals what drove Hitler, rather a film that shows him at various states out of the spotlight; in the comfort of his home or the occasional public appearance and it's really like watching a train that you know is just about to derail... you know what's coming, but there's nothing you can do to stop it and you just can't take your eyes off of it.

Just because an evil leader has friends and a home life, that doesn't mean he's not a monster. We need to judge by actions, not by what's portrayed.

There's footage that you might not have seen of Hitler and his band of madmen putting on that human face, and trying to appear as normal humans. How anyone could not see that Goebbels and Goring were madmen just by looking at them is beyond me. Both have a vile and dissipated look to them that is clear in this documentary. It's always surprised me that Hitler and company were accepted when all of them were so far from the Aryan ideals they espoused.

Knowing where these events led and what some of these people did makes it all the more upsetting, of course, but perhaps the viewer can also get a taste of what it was to ""just go along"" with it all, to shout with the crowd, to blend in- which is what the bulk of German citizens did.

We will never see something similar in belief when it comes again. It's erroneous to state that he was the most evil or destructive dictator even in modern history. Stalin actually did worse but not on the epically world stage.

The point is to remember that Hitler regardless of all the evil and pain he wrought on the earth as a man he was not all bad. I'm not saying that in a matter of defense for him but a fact that every man has those points which are warm and even loveable, something relatable to all. There were points of policy that were not wrong. The point it drives at is people accuse you of being an apologist if you say such things but without that very humanity and being able to have sensible points is what makes a man such as Hitler truly scary. For he appeals to that human center and heart and much as the German people said during the Holocaust was that our beloved compassionate leader could never do such things.

It begins in 1933 and shows throughout how Germany appeared and was a normal beautiful life like any other nations in so many ways. Not just a deceiving picture but all enveloping reality. It takes us straight through to 1939 all the while giving us views of the German culture and society. Well giving us the private films with views of him and his conspirators relaxations and respite from the rigors of conquering Europe. Just showing us how it was all life and business as usual.

I think this is very vital for students of history and for us all to remember that men commit horrible atrocities on earth. Not some demons of a darker and greater spectre.",1361836800,,1761,4.412307692307692

2638846,4,B000HKKZQ2,"This film is quite good because it uses original film footage and gives some insight in the personal life of Hitler and his entourage.  The film shows the personal side of Hitler's life and how he was able to separate himself from the wickedness of his actions and his personal enjoyments.  I was reading a biography about Hitler titled, ""The Horns of the Moon"" when I watched this documentary and both were in agreement as to what Hitler was most interested in, being theater, building bridges, structures, and most importantly, himself.  I was especially impressed by the huge statues that were made (horse, naked statues, etc.) and how he must have thought that art and building would progress his cause.  His cause was to annihilate anyone who stood in his way and went against what he wanted to do.",1358467200,2,803,4.755395683453237

2638850,4,B000HKKZQ2,"The German Camelot of the XX Century?

Disturbing  documentary.  When I saw it after dinner, it took me longer than usual to fall sleeping.  I got sort of hallucinations, nightmare.
How can one conceive the Hitler we have known in so many books and in movies and films, based upon historical facts, with all the brutalities committed in occupied territories by the SS and the Wehrmacht, to have the sort of gentle, caring, completely human personality shown in Swastika. People like Bormann, Himmler, Goering, and Ribbentrop behaving all like normal and even nice people.
Master of crime and propaganda like Goebbels (read the book, Symphony just to learn on how he played the game having a Jewish Symphonic orchestra until the USA entered the war when musicians were sent to concentration camps) playing with children, giving gifts and smiling, enjoying Christmas. Hitler moved by a girl crying during the commemoration of the death of his father and other participants of the September 1923 revolution fighting against Nazi opponents.  We see Hitler as Godfather in a Christian church with a tender attitude during the baptism of Goering son.  The same person that ordered the elimination of all Jews, Gypsies and all people considered sub human.  The same that ordered the massacre in Russia and the same that encouraged the final solution and the use of gas chambers, ovens, and the starvation of Jews in the concentration camps.
You finally sort of realize the fact that perhaps there are so many Hitlers, Bormans,  Goerings, Himmlers and even Speers (not as a criminal but willing participant in the Rich as professional Architect and also as Manager of hard labor enterprises for the Reich war production) around ready to terminate other human beings one way or another.  All of them masters of atrocities.

Some shots appear with images of starving Jew kids in Poland and the corpses of former concentration camps inmates pushed to a common hole dig in the ground by a British tractor but these are less that 10 minutes intervals in the 1 and a half hours film.
If one is to summarize the film in one word, I would say controversial.
One thing is true. This film should be for people exposed to WW II history mostly in books or documentaries from respected sources. Otherwise it can mislead the understanding of a dark period of the XX century.
I have read many books on the subject starting when I was 20 years old with the classic Rise and Fall by William Shirer and followed by at least 20 more including visits to the British War Museum and the underground museum in Paris as well as the beaches of Normandy.  The last book read was In the Garden of Beasts written by William E. Dodd the USA Ambassador to Nazi Germany appointed by Roosevelt and the picture shown there is vivid and dramatic.  The only similitude is the air of strict military organization in cities and the cleanliness of streets and the people in the streets well dressed and healthy plus the hard working spirit in the air.
Who knows, but Swatika gets close to project Hitler and friends as living in paradise with the total support of the German people.
Technically is fine, excellent color considering the year when filmed, fine editing and above all the Bonus material is of top interest and very professional.  In fact I think the film without the Bonus to explain details is incomplete.  I would have preferred the introduction with less exposure of the Swastika. Too long shot and does not add value in my opinion.
At the end after watching the film and bonus I closed my eyes and these question are unanswered:

Were all Germans Nazis at heart?  Was it their Camelot?

How do you separate fact from perception?  Were all Germans associated to this bunch of criminals because of their petit bourgeois aspirations?
At the end you still wander the whys behind this film?  Reason to marketing it?  Show a friendly Nazi structure? Encourage the revival of Nazism?  Show common people becoming monsters?  Show that most Germans were happy with the regime?  Show that most Germans were also culprits of the Nazi atrocities?
How did the world let that happened when there was time to stop it?  Did not the world powers realize that a monster was growing in front of their faces with a diabolic capacity to start the destruction of all we believe and replace it by a myth of blood?  Only Churchill saw what was coming but little could he do until the storm burst all over in a war that left more than 50 million people dead (military and civilians including 7 million Germans).
And the most terrible question:
Is that man in his 40s seating next to you in the cinema or in a restaurant or smiling to your son, daughter or grandchildren perhaps a potential criminal if given the power?
How do you know who is good and how is evil in this world?",1340236800,3,4823,4.7199046483909415
8140194,1,B000HKKZQ2,"Some interesting home clips but overall not what i expected.  There is no narration, plot or sequence to the documentary and the subtitles that translate the exchanges from German to English are few and far between. I expected home movies but this seems more like a number of home videos randomly spliced together with no sense of structure. A photo album from a stranger's home would make more sense and have more structure.  If you're a WWII student, you're likely to have seen a lot of these home clips in other films anyway.

8140197,5,B000HKKZQ2,"It's hard to give a 5 star review to a movie about the Nazis but this was remarkably done - if the viewer is aware of what they are seeing.
Starting with happy propaganda films from the Minister of Propaganda himself - interspersed with happy home videos by Eva Braun - an avid home movie enthusiast. Gradually though, we begin to see brief flashes of REAL footage - for instance, Hitler playing with the children at the Berghdorf, with a quick flash of starving children on the street. If you know enough about WW2 history, the use of Propaganda from the Reich, and being able to differentiate between the two, you will find this quite geniously done. I think it's terrible that it was banned in Cannes - perhaps they didn't grasp what the film was actually trying to say. It is NOT a pro-Nazi movie. It merely shows Hitler's human side, which is absolutely essential for people to understand. He was not a monster - he was a disturbed HUMAN, and there are many more like him out there.
