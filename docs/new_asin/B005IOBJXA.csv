8474861,4,B005IOBJXA,"I take 1 star away because the video concert needs to be in USA format.
Godseed is Gorgoroth minus one member - not as good as Black Mass Krakow.",1476576000,,145,4.0344827586206895
8474862,5,B005IOBJXA,The quality and performance from God Seed was just perfect. I enjoyed every minute from the concert and CD. A job well done.,1378166400,,124,4.434782608695652
8474863,5,B005IOBJXA,"Both the DVD and CD content presented here is amazing, the visuals, sound and experience are true Black Metal form.  God Seed are an amazing band and im glad to see King and Gahll still making great black metal music after their parting from Black Metal God's Gorgoroth.  The sound quality is exellent, the performance is superb and will be enjoyed and appreacheated by any fan of true Black Metal.  Horns up \m/\m/  God Seed 's new album (yes they are reunited and Ghall is no longer retired from metal) titled I Begin hit's soon so be on the lookout for that as well.",1349136000,2,569,4.4423076923076925
8474864,3,B005IOBJXA,"The only thing holding me back from giving this DVD/CD package a higher 4-star review is the fact that this is a region 1 DVD for North America but the video is in PAL format! Imagine my surprise when I loaded this disc into my PS3 to watch it and couldn't! Very annoying! I can watch it on my PC though, but still it's annoying!

Though this is credited as God Seed, technically it is Gorgoroth. It was recorded when the dispute over the ownership of the name Gorgoroth was still up in the air. I'd go into the details but chances are if you are interested in this then you already know about the Gaahl/King vs Infernus Gorgoroth dispute.  The concert was played as a Gorgoroth and 2 of the 3 official members of Gorgoroth at the time are on this performance.

Some may call what I am about to say Black Metal blasphemy, but I think Gorgoroth's best output was when Gaahl and King Ov Hell were in the band. Gaahl was Gorgoroth's best vocalist and King wrote grest music! I love all of Gorgoroth's muscial output, both pre and post Gaahl and King, but I feel the band was really at it's height with Gaahl and King.  Infernus is truly the heart and soul of Gorgoroth and credit is due to him for always being the Satanic guitar-shredding force behind the band. I should point out though that at this point in Gorgoroth's history (we are talking about 2008 here) Infernus had taken a back seat as a creative and song writing force in the band and that Gaahl and King had entirely written all the music and lyrics for what was at the time Gorgoroth's most recent album (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ad-Majorem-Sathanas-Gloriam/dp/B000FII3BK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam</a>, which I highly recommend, it is excellent).

So how is this concert? Awesome. It's very similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Mass-Krakow-2004/dp/B0016XR5Q2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Mass Krakow 2004</a>. Which is better?&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Mass-Krakow-2004/dp/B0016XR5Q2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Mass Krakow 2004</a>&nbsp;is definately the better of the two concerts, but this is still great. The lineup is good and the playing is top-notch. Audio and video quality is great and the song selection is superb. Sign Of An Open Eye is my favorite song on here, and the standout of the set with it's slow Blackened-Doom quality.  All the songs are Gorgoroth tunes penned by Gaahl and King so if you're into that era of Gorgoroth you'll love it. Plus it's a 2-disc set which comes with an audio CD of the concert. Very excellent!

The cons are that the set is short at a mere 9 songs. The stage setup is exactly the same as the Black Mass Krakw 2004 concert (goat heads, nude crucified people, etc..) and the setlist has songs that you can already find on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Mass-Krakow-2004/dp/B0016XR5Q2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Mass Krakow 2004</a>. It's just like Black Mass Krakw 2004 except with fewer songs and no Infernus. Though it does contain songs not performed for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Mass-Krakow-2004/dp/B0016XR5Q2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Mass Krakow 2004</a>&nbsp;as well. Plus the whole PAL format thing is really a bummer.

I certainly like it more than any gripes I have and would recommend this for all Gorgoroth, King Ov Hell, Gaahl and God Seed fans. You might be better of just getting the single disc CD audio only version of this which is also available as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Mass-Krakow-2004/dp/B0016XR5Q2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Mass Krakow 2004</a>, which is definately better.",1335657600,,3889,5.798598949211909
