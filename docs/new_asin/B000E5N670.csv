2492583,4,B000E5N670,"The collectible die-cast Mach 5 is a definite improvement over the round tin case from volume 3. It is pretty durable and measures 3 3/8"" long x 1 3/8"" wide x 3/4""high. The only moving parts are the wheels/tires. It rolls forward very easily but has trouble rolling backwards. The interior is painted red (as it should be), and you can see the steering wheel, two seats, and stick shift. The steering wheel, however, has no buttons (too small). In addition to the headlights, you can also see the outlines of the two doors, trunk, homing bird hatch, and periscope hatch.

The height and width of the outer box matches the same dimensions of a standard DVD case but is almost 1 1/2"" deep to accommodate the die-cast toy.

The DVD begins with four previews, which you can just skip (run times in minutes:seconds):
Ultimate Avengers The Movie 1:55
Dragons Metal Ages 1:47
Inspector Gadget's Biggest Caper Ever 1:13
Pinocchio 3000 1:59

All four are either 2D or 3D animation. Beyond the previews, I found no other DVD extras, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five.",1143763200,7,1073,4.636842105263158
2492584,5,B000E5N670,"If the reports are correct, this volume should contain only 8 episodes of Speed Racer from the original series. This means you'll be seeing:

The Terrifying Gambler

The Secret Invaders (Part 1)

The Secret Invaders (Part 2)

 Man Behind the Mask

The Car Destroyer

 The Desperate Racer

The Dangerous Witness

 Race the Laser Tank

So it appearsLionsgate will stretch this out one more year by since there's still the final 8 episodes left to be release. At least they're making up the lack of episodes (since Vol. 3 had 13 episodes) by including a Mach 5 car - which is a better gimmick than the theme song cover that had the battery die after six months.

As for the show, it's always amazing. Before my cousin shipped out to Iraq, we spent an afternoon watching Vol. 2. It was like we were back to being in elementary school - except we didn't need a fake ID to buy our beer. The limited animation techniques in the series don't detract from the story.",1138147200,39,957,4.494186046511628

2492686,5,B000E5N670,"Though it wasn't the very first Japanese animated cartoon to be released in America, Speed Racer was the first to be successful here. With that in mind; Speed Racer is, as I've said before, considered to be the Godfather of Anime here in the USA. Many of us have fond memories of this show in its' original run which is why we're so excited it is on DVD now. Volume 4 has rolled around but it isn't quite what fans are hoping for. At least, not what I was hoping for, anyway. Volume 4 only includes 8 episodes of the show. They are episodes 37 through 44 of the show. That leaves 8 more for volume 5.

Episodes in this volume has Speed and the gang going up against thieves, crime bosses, and the occasional person out to rule the world. Pretty typical for Speed, actually, for any who've seen the show. Still, as bizarre of adventures that Speed finds himself in, it is so much fun to watch. Thanks to there being only 8 episodes, the quality of visuals looks surprisingly better than the previous volume. No grainy look to this volume, thank goodness. This volume, however, only has one episode that is a two-parter as the rest are single episodes with stand alone stories(which is really unusual for Speed Racer). Sadly, other than the die-cast car of the Mach 5 that was included with this volume, there are no extras to speak of. The least they could have did was spoke to the vocal actors of the show to give their insight on Speed Racer. Unfortunately,no.

All in all, I loved this volume..even though we only got 8 episodes. I really wish Lionsgates had put the remainder of them with this volume. Course, it might have brought down the visual quality of the episodes, I don't know. This volume will probably only appeal to fans of the show but casual fans should get into Speed Racer, it is a true classic.",1236816000,,1815,4.4474474474474475

2492688,4,B000E5N670,"I just let a review for the other volume that I have (I have all of them) and so I am not going to tell the whole story again, but if anyone wants to read it just go check out his reviews for volume 3 I believe and you can read it. However, I will state that these dvds that he is selling are in great shape and wonderful quality and I would recommend them to anyone who wants to buy the Speed Racer series.",1222646400,,407,3.8
2492689,3,B000E5N670,"Speed Racer Volume 4 includes episodes thirty-seven through forty-four of the series.  There are only eight episodes on the disc, and no special features were included.  I managed to purchase the limited edition that came with the diecast Mach 5.  However, the little Mach 5 doesn't make up for the fact that the disc could have had more episodes and it didn't make up for the lack of special features on the disc itself.

However, I have to give kudos for the fact that Lions Gate actually put chapter marks on the DVD that the viewer can actually use to skip over the beginning and ending credits if the viewer so desires.  However, I do have to complain about how many trailers were tacked on at the beginning of the disc, as well as the fact that you can't skip over the trailers (even if you fast forward, the disc will start playing again when it hits the next trailer).

Any die-hard fan of the Speed Racer anime series needs to get this disc if they want all the episodes on DVD.",1217894400,2,987,4.395604395604396

2492691,5,B000E5N670,"The other day I walked past my tv and saw my 7 year old son watching The new speed racer. I informed him that there was a speed racer before that one, the original speed racer that had no computer generated effect like the one in the movie or wild looking machine like on the next generation. I bought a few of the DVD's and he viewed them. He loved the show and can't get enough. No fancy computer generated graphics just simple plain animation. Now I have to purchase the remaining two DVD's and yes I enjoyed them also, it was a blast from the past.",1215302400,2,552,4.168224299065421
2492692,5,B000E5N670,"I remember when my brother was a kid and how he'd rush home from school to

2492694,4,B000E5N670,"I loved Speed Racer as a little Girl, and my daughter, age 6, loves the series as well.  A lot of reviews have already been written about this vol., but I wanted to make a few points.

First of all, of the first 1-4 volumes, this is the most violent.  Again, it's cartoon violence and doesn't seem particularly gratuitous, but I waited a full year until my daughter was 6 before letting her watch these.  Older kids, I'm sure, will have no trouble with the material.

Second, one of the series is very much like a previous episode ""Car Hater"", but it's still a good story.

Finally, I have to say that there are more twists and turns in this one than I remember in the First Two sets of Speed Racers.  One of them, ""The Man in the Mask"", actually left me and my daughter gasping with shock at the end!

Very exciting stories; and, I think they have a good message, too, of Right Vs. Wrong, Good Vs. Evil, etc.

Great series, and this is sure to be one that you'd like to include if you liked the previous three volumes.",1210896000,9,1019,4.238341968911917

The Secret Invaders (part 1)

The Secret Invaders (part 2)

The Man Behind the Mask

The Car Destroyer

2492718,5,B000E5N670,Obviously Speed Racer is timeless.  Our kids love the DVD.  We don't leave home without it.,1172188800,,91,4.625
2492719,5,B000E5N670,"I have all 5 DVDs of Speed Racer.  What a nice blast from the past.  It's also somewhat refreshing to let my child watch it vs. the endless drone of Dora or Diego.  He loves it.  We watch all of the DVDs depending on his mood and he even wants to be Speed Racer for Halloween.  It's a shame that the Speed Racer ""comeback"" on the internet seems mindless.  Speed Racer was almost like James Bond, fighting bad guys back then.  You don't see that nowadays in many cartoons.  I was 3 when I first was watching these and I still think they are all awesome.  Even more fun to watch now that I'm older and understand what is going on now.

It's too bad they aren't bringing it back, old school style.  That would be the way to do it.",1171497600,5,727,4.085106382978723
2492720,3,B000E5N670,"As a fan of this show, ""Speed Racer"" volume 4 is a complete disappointment. Why did the Studio decide to split the final 16 episodes of ""Speed Racer"" into two volumes? The entire series only had 52 episodes, so why 5 volumes instead of a complete series set?

The Studio has resorted to cheap gimmicks from the start to sell their DVD's and that's just wrong. The first season had rubber tire packaging (neat). The second season had a slip cover with music and blinking headlights (cool). The third season was a DVD in a cheap tin can (very cheap). The fourth season contains only 8 episodes and comes with a 1/64 scale die cast Mach 5 (big deal). I don't know about the rest of you but I stopped playing with dinky cars a long time ago and I would have liked the final 16 episodes in one volume. Why didn't the Studio just release the entire series in a limited edition boxed set with a bigger die cast? Maybe some TV shows need gimmick's to sell, Speed Racer certainly doesn't!

2492721,3,B000E5N670,"If you enjoy Speed Racer, this is an essential part of the series to have as a die-hard regardless.  However, most of the episodes are only one part episodes.  They wrap up much too quickly.  I say get the other volumes if you like the multi-part episode series.  The two-part storylines are needed to make a good plot and development.  There is only one two-part series on this DVD.  And the collector's car isn't anything special to look at.  It's just a neat little bonus to have I guess.  If you want a better looking model car, Johnny Lightning brand is the ticket if you can fine one.",1156809600,4,590,4.398148148148148
2492722,3,B000E5N670,"Only 8 episodes not in order as the Tv broadcasted,the last one compressed and fast paced. Only the die cast collectible makes the set worth.

2492723,5,B000E5N670,"I really looked forward to this release, since it featured my favourite episode  Race The Laser Tank. Unfortuantely this episode has been ""time compressed"" in other words they sped it up. It flys by at a frustratingly fast pace. It is completely annoying and it sucks. Lions Gate

sucks for doing this (but then what can you expect from a company that creates a logo that is so dark you can barely see it.) I am not a gerbil. I really want to see these episodes the way they were originally shown.",1146873600,11,497,4.391304347826087
2492724,4,B000E5N670,"I agree with the other reviews regarding the limited number of episodes, but rather than give us 16 episodes on the last disk, they decided to stretch it out a fifth and last year.  They should have reduced the price.  The die-cast Mach V was a nice touch and I do wish I had it when I was a kid and the show was on TV, and I could really enjoy it.  But to another reviewer's point, the back wheels do not move as easily because it is a pull-back car....you pull back on the car, the wheels wind up, and then you let go...the car moves on its own.

I also am giving the DVD 4 stars due to the limited number of episodes, but like all Speed Racer episodes, the content rates 5 stars.
