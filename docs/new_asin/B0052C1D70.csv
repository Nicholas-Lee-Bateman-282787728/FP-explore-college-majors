8453771,4,B0052C1D70,"[THE LIFE AND WORK OF CLAUDE CHABROL - (2006) - Documentary directed by Oliver Bourbeillon - 62 Minutes]  Filmed at the 74th birthday bash thrown for cinema master director Claude Chabrol, this documentary is a heartwarming look at the man who directed almost one film a year for the last 50 years or so. The charming nature of this documentary is that we feel as though we were present at the party (what do you mean you didn't bring a gift? What were you thinking?), an intimate gathering of friends, children, ex-wives and actors who worked repeatedly with Chabrol, and who obviously loved, admired and respected this man who was larger than life as well as the grand films he prolifically produced. As an insiders view of the man who was all too constantly compared to the great Hitchcock (as tedious as this gets), we are privileged to hear the musings of an artist who, along with Goddard, Truffaut, Rhomer and Rivette, revolutionized and revitalized French cinema forever, having the most abundant harvest of all.

Present at this festive celebration were ex-wife and frequent muse Stephane Audran, actors Michel Bouquet, Sandrine Bonnaire (who's near tears at one point during one of the toasts), Suzanne Flon, Jacques Gamblin, son Thomas Chabrol, Gwenhael de Guevello, Bernadette Lafont, Benoit Magimel, Cecil Maistre, and a few others. They eat and drink like royalty (quite fitting indeed) while the host hams it up, exchange jokes and stories, reflections of working with Chabrol, read a wonderful poem penned by son Thomas and Jacques Gamblin, open gifts and, as end credits roll, facetiously implore Chabrol to stop his boisterous singing.

There are about a dozen clips of his films and a few serious comments and insights offered as he reflects on his career, but this is much more a feast than a critical exam. Lighthearted and lyrical, these festivities are to enjoy and entertain, not dissect and ponder. The brevity of this chronicle is its only shortcoming (ok, a more in-depth critical analysis would be additionally appropriate, but I was easily sidetracked by the merriment)- I wanted to spend more time with this man who savored and frequently loomed larger than life. An obvious labor of love released shortly after his passing acknowledges that we will miss him greatly, but we will also bask in the consolation that he will always be with us thanks to the prodigious body of work he left for us to enjoy. Vive Chabrol!",1314403200,4,2446,4.932038834951456
