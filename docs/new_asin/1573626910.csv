192808,3,1573626910,"Loosely connected sequel to Sometimes They Come Back and Sometimes They Come Back Again plays the Thing from Another World game as a military rescue team (of only two people!?!) is dispatched to an Antartic drilling station.  Seems the miners broke through to hell...and something wants out.  For low budget schlock this plays fairly well, no real surprises, but director Daniel Zelik Berk manages to craft an eerie moment or two amongst all the to be expected satanic hokum.",1022803200,7,475,5.0
192809,3,1573626910,"This is a pretty good horror flick, I rented it a while back and it was pretty enjoyable.
I could see where the director/producer was trying to elevate the film up from its ""Creature Feature"" underpinnings with an interesting plot, and he/she succeeded in some respects. Unfortunately, the obviously small budget of the film coupled with it's setting kept the film from being really interesting.",990489600,4,395,5.092307692307692
192810,4,1573626910,"I rented the movie and I havn't seen the first three but this one was pretty good. It wasn't the absolute best horror film but good pace of the movie, good plots and story line. I don't recommend going out and buying it  righ away cause you should rent it first and decide for yourself.",940118400,3,286,4.2
192825,1,1573626910,"Inspired by a story from Stephen King but having very little to do with it just the same, ""Sometimes They Come Back... For More"" ensures you probably won't be coming back for more any time soon. The third installment in the increasingly absurdly-titled and logically-flawed ""Sometimes They Come Back For More"" series, ""...For More"" finds two soldiers crash-landing on a remote base in Antarctica on a mission to investigate some rather strange occurrences. See, it appears that somebody gave a group of amateur film-makers a little bit of cash and a license to leave their mark on a vaguely recognizable franchise.

""Sometimes They Come Back ...For More"" is about as bland as direct-to-video horror gets, especially late '90s DTV fare. When most of your talent lies at the feet of Corky from TV's ""Murphy Brown,"" you know you're in dire straits. And while the thinly-veiled attempt at ripping off John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" should at least make for a mildly interesting watch, the film-makers lack the skill or the means necessary to squeeze any tension or dread out of the situation. However, if  you consider boredom a form of horror, then prepare to be scared out of your skin!

Really, if not for the fact that this film carries a somewhat familiar title, it would never have seen the light of day, let alone been made. While there is a remotely interesting twist towards the end of the film, its execution is so clumsy, it bottoms out long before the credits mercifully roll out. ""Sometimes They Come Back ...For More."" But you won't. And unsurprisingly, a fourth film has yet to be produced in this franchise.",1445472000,,1617,4.851449275362318

192831,4,1573626910,"Sometimes They Come Back For More is the third and final movie of the 90s Sometimes They Come Back trilogy. This time the plot centers on 2 military officers who are sent by the CIA to venture out to an isolated military base in an Antarctica after learning of a disaster that has taken place there.

Military police officers Captain Sam Cage and Major Callie' O Grady are ordered by the CIA to travel to a remote military base located in Antarctica to investigate after receiving word of a tragic catastrophe that recently took place on the grounds of the base. Upon arriving at the base's cabin, they encounter Dr. Jennifer Wells and Brian Shebanski; the only 2 survivors of the big tragedy that took place.

Cage and Grady try to get answers out of Wells and Shebanksi about what happened and why they're the only 2 alive; but the survivors' answers seem none too helpful. Because of this Cage and Grady venture out to investigate the mine of the base for themselves just as nightfall hits with a big blizzard on the way. Their investigation is cut short and soon return to the cabin after Grady experiences a mild reaction to fumes in the base.

Soon after, one of the crew begins seeing ghosts constantly haunting them and when bodies begin turning up left and right, they and the rest are under the suspicion that despite being in the middle of nowhere; evil demonic spirits are lurking around the base and are responsible for the disastrous events. In heat of the moment, it's revealed that one of them is intentionally or unintentionally the cause of all that's happened. Through it all; patience is tested, trust is put on the line and soon enough; they all will come face to face with who or what's been causing all the trouble.

Overall: For the second sequel and final movie to the Sometimes They Come Back trilogy, this wasn't half bad. I remember the first time around when I watched it, I felt very bored and uninterested with it. But watching it again some years later, it turned out to be a pretty okay final. This wasn't as good as the previous 2 films, but it was decent. Of course, just like the other 2 films, Sometimes They Come Back For More revolves around the main character of the movie being forced to face their demons (literally) from the past that have come back to finish the game that was started many years back. The story telling is very interesting as there's something happening almost every minute, so it does its best to keep the viewer's attention focused on the movie. The acting is standard at best; nothing more. This movie does however deserve a gold star however for keeping the movie unpredictable and making it a bit creepy. There are so many twists and turns throughout, you won't see most of them coming. Also, you can't tell me that the idea of being in a remote cabin in the middle of Antarctica with demons after you wouldn't scare or creep you out just a little. When it comes down to it, Sometimes They Come Back For More is a fairly good thriller/horror (it's a mix of both) and is a perfect ending to a rather forgotten 90s trilogy.",1419724800,,3087,4.5368043087971275

192861,3,1573626910,"As for the movie title I can't say I always go back for more on most these B horrors, but this one I will. Sure it looks like they borrowed heavily from John Carpenter's 1982 version of ""The Thing"", but I loved that movie and I don't mind that they did. I always felt there should be more books and movies about remote settings like that. It makes a great setting for mysteries, SciFi, or horrors especially. Besides this movie is about a bunch of Satanic zombies trying to get a couple people, not a single alien terrorizing a group of scientist. After seeing this on the SciFi channel I came here to order it as it is reasonably priced even for a new copy and with Amazon prime shipping I consider it a bargain.

192864,3,1573626910,"This movie has to have some of the worst outside snow scenes in cinematic history---you can't tell anything what's going on.  Inside, things are not a whole lot better, but this thriller does have some unexpected plot twists, including one with Max Perlich who portrays the resident pain in the neck.  Clayton Rohner in the lead tries hard, but can't overcome the script's many discrepancies.  Emmy-winner Faith Ford looks completely lost in her role as Jennifer, the doctor, and Chase Masterson as Rohner's sidekick gives her Sigourney Weaver imitation.  Damian Chapa as Schilling possesses a nasty smarm that belies his good looks.
Not a total waste, but you might want to rent it in lieu of buying.",1073001600,5,701,4.965811965811966

7798353,4,1573626910,"You know, I enjoy writing reviews of films I've bought through Amazon.com and I always enjoy watching and reviewing the too bad they are good ones the most. The reason is if you watch enough of them that eventually you find a 'diamond in the rough' so to say. This film is that diamond. I'm sure Stephen King was very happy for the check they wrote him to use his SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK story. However, even the only thing remotely close to his story, and even that's not 100%, is the title. The title for this film is SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK...FOR MORE (which I think makes it the third film to use King's story title, sort of anyway. This film takes place in the Antarctica where a small CIA outpost has come under attack by something that has left only two survivors of a classified drilling operation that has claimed several lives (but of course, they come back for more) because they have evidently broken through to Hell. This is what comes the closest thing to King's story. A person whose life has had some type of disaster in their past (usually a religious falling out because of that disaster) that brings them to finally face that nightmare again. In this case, two military officers are sent in to find out what has happened to leave Faith Ford (Murphy Brown show) and another person to fight off the dead as best they can. The film even tries a nod to John Carpenter's version of THE THING but it just doesn't quite fit into the story very well. This is another story of good versus evil in a remote setting. (probably can't get much more remote than Antarctica). No Spoilers from me but you know how this storyline proceeds anyway because if you're a fan of horror movies, you've seen dozens of movies proceed and end the same way. So, this story is enjoyable especially on a cold snowy day where you can sit in a lounge chair in your nice warm house but if you hear a knock at your door, just remember...SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK..FOR MORE.",1482624000,,1959,4.459610027855153
