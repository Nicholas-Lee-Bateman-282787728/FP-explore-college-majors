6036147,5,B00FXOO0R2,"I love this show so I was just as excited to watch the new DVD Tickety Toc: The Unstoppable, Unpoppable Bubble as my kids were! I just think its so cute and creative and I can how it appeals to kids with the fun characters and bright vibrant colors.

There are six episodes but my kids loved the bubble episode the most! They wanted to immediately go get bubbles and try to make them as big as Tommy and Talulah! They wanted to make one big enough to fit our house in! I love how this show makes their imaginations soar and they start putting themselves in the characters positions and wanting to be like them.

When your kids want to emulate everything they watch on TV, its so important that the characters they look up to are good examples of what you want them to be. Tommy and Tallulah and their friends always work together to solve problems and do the right thing which is exactly what I want my kids to learn.

The premise behind this show is so unique and creative. They live in a clock and have to have their adventures and get back before the clock goes off again. It always reminds me of a coo coo clock my Grandma had that had little characters that used to pop out every fifteen minutes. How fun for kids to imagine they are going back in that clock and having adventures behind the walls.

Tickey Tock: The Unstoppable, Unpoppable Bubble is fun, creative and will make your kids use their active imaginations even more!",1390176000,,1434,4.359550561797753

Very disappointing when these companies plaster tv episodes on a dvd, and don't label it correctly.",1410566400,,273,4.708333333333333
