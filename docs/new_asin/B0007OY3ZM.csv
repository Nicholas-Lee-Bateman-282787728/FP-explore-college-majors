8049838,5,B0007OY3ZM,"I'm 25 years old. Lately I've been reminiscing the old days when I was a kid. I thought it would be a good idea to get this cartoon series to watch since I loved watching it when I was little. Couldn't get back into it. It's a kind of t.v. show like Barney were if you watch it when your a child, you grow out of it when your older.",1400803200,,332,3.757142857142857
8049839,5,B0007OY3ZM,"I just loved this DVD it reminded me of when my girls were little, I bought this for my grand daughters Birthday and it arrived in time for her birthday, just like when her mom was little and enjoyed it so did my grand daughter.",1395446400,,228,4.088888888888889
8049840,5,B0007OY3ZM,"This was a great purchase, while in the hospital our daughter had access to a movie room and she loved watching the movies from sky dancers, so I ordered this one for when she was released to watch at home- She loves it !",1365033600,,221,4.045454545454546
8049841,1,B0007OY3ZM,"This is a great buy for a child. It's a good series. My problem is that I want the whole series, and not just 4 episodes. I can't find a dvd with more than 4 episodes, so I assumed that being the first volume, this would have the first 4 episodes. It doesn't. It contains episodes 5, 9, 8 and 10 (in that order!!!). Why would you put episode 9 before 8?! So I'm not even going to bother buying volume 2, because who knows what episodes are on that one. Hopefully one day they will release the whole series, in correct order.",1357862400,2,524,4.097087378640777
8049842,5,B0007OY3ZM,"This is an old cartoon, but my daughter loves it. Someone gave her one of the Sky Dancers books and she has been interested ever since. Netflix had the Sky Dancers show on streaming for a while but then they took it off. For the price of this dvd - $5 - it's a steal and she enjoys watching it. I would like to get more, and I wish the books were more widely available too!!",1321488000,,374,3.9342105263157894
8049843,5,B0007OY3ZM,This is the cutest video and the kids are facinated with the wonderful flying and dancing creatures!,1247011200,,100,4.9411764705882355
