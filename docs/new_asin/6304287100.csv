I can't think of any man-made or natural disasters, tragedies, or sheer acts of stupidity that even come close to matching the horror, torture, and the evil this movie makes you endure. Viewing this classic gem is like watching a truly neverending story.  I constantly questioned ""why"" so many times during the film that I lost count during the first 5 minutes.  Of course, you might say, ""how could I possibly resist the 700 or so lobby scenes that inundate this homeric classic?"" to which I reply, ""The scenes shot without any lighting (aka the rest of the movie) were far superior.""

840015,4,6304287100,"Ever since Tim Burton brought attention to the quirky, cut-rate work of director Ed Wood it's been a race to discover the next ""Best of the Worst,"" with unearthed atrocities like Manos, The Hands of Fate and Troll 2 vying hard for a place in the hearts of bad movie fans everywhere.  And, ironically enough, all that competition has resulted in a second life on Blu-ray for films that were lucky to get a theatrical release in the first place!  Now you can toss 1968's Astro Zombies into the ring, a movie so tediously terrible it's sure to rank in top five most atrocious things ever captured on celluloid...newly re-mastered in HD!

Mixing cheapie sci-fi schlock with some tepid T & A, director Ted V. Mikels and screenwriter Wayne Rogers (Cpt. John McIntyre from M.A.S.H.) concoct a nearly unwatchable mix of international spy thrillers and Russ Meyer skin flicks.  Wendell Corey gets top billing as a CIA agent trying to track down a missing scientist (horror legend John Carradine) who has perfected a method of transferring information from one brain to another with the goal of using expendable astro zombies for space exploration (don't ask).  Unfortunately, a dangerously seductive criminal mastermind (Tura Satana of Faster Pussycat!  Kill!  Kill!) is also after the secret recipe and will ruthlessly eliminate anyone who gets in her way.

The first 15-minutes of Astro Zombies pretty much secures its position in bad movie history, starting with the opening credits which play out over a montage of wind-up robots knocking each other over in someone's driveway.  This is followed by five minutes of a pointless driving POV and the eventual attack by the film's sole astro zombie, which is actually a guy in a corduroy jacket wearing a Halloween mask.  And it only gets worse (or better, depending on your perspective) from there, with Carradine spending what seems like hours fiddling with knobs and switching out blood in his basement laboratory with help from his slow-witted assistant.

There's so much to make fun of here that the film is mentally exhausting, stretching out a full 90-minutes before giving the dancing robots an encore during the end credits.  As Kevin Murphy of RiffTrax jokes, ""It's like Dad caught us watching one lab scene and made us smoke the whole pack!""  Luckily, Kino Lorber's release features three different audio commentary tracks, including an essential one from the guys at RiffTrax (featuring ex-MST3K cast members) that makes the film bearable and hilarious at the same time.  Director Ted V. Mikels courageously gives it a go himself, covering the low-budget production process and the several sequels he produced over the years (God help us!).  And finally, ex-Fangoria editor Chris Alexander provides a loosely information take to wrap things up.

Transfer-wise, Astro Zombies looks damn good!  There's a bit of film damage and bad splices here and there, but the original negative looks to be in pretty good shape compared to the recent Manos restoration.  An original theatrical trailer and some sweet cover art complete what is an essential example of bad filmmaking at its finest.",1475107200,2,3135,5.054368932038835

 Almost everything about this movie strives to push it down into the muck of the worst movies ever made.  It may not be as bad as the immortal Plan Nine From Outer Space but it isn't from lack of trying.  The acting, led by John Carradine, isn't the problem, although the acting can considered good only by Zombie movie standards.  It is the erratic script that is the un-doing of Astro Zombies.  The writers throw in maniacal Mexican killers, Chinese spies, mad scientists and the humano/robotic Astro Zombies more or less at random.  Sometimes having plenty of ideas running through a film is a real plus, but not here.  Lets say the story line lacks continuity.
 The Zombies in the title are actually robots using space age materials and the brains of dead criminals.  Naturally, nothing good can come from this experiment by the evil Dr. DeMarco, the John Carradine character.
 Director Ted Mikels strains his limited abilities to make something from the chaos of the script.  He fails.  Even B side director Mikels cannot make a silk purse from this sows ear.

Most of the film has the ""B"" movie feel with stilted dialog and erratic scene changes. There is something also very suspicious when you look on the wall behind the good guys and see a picture of Pres. Johnson.

A scientist Dr. DeMarco (John Carradine) is figuring out the formula for Astro Zombies the only way to go into space. These creatures can be mowed remotely controlled and programmed with knowledge from other people. Unfortunately Dr. DeMarco stepped over the line and could not tell the difference between subjects and corpses. Therefore he had to go.

A series of really dumb looking mutilated murders leads authorities to believe the Dr. DeMarco is still roaming around out there. Parallel to this several governments also realize that Dr. DeMarco is out there and watches secrets. One of Dr. DeMarco's assistance naturally female is a prime target or the goat on the string. Can DeMarco get her before he becomes de-markacated by his own creation?

The movie is permeated with scantily clad women; in one scene a woman has to display her bra just before she gets stabbed to death OOoooo. Don't forget to clean off your glasses for awfully long filler where topless green woman gets to play snake dance like the audience we have to watch it to make sure that there isn't any information that's relevant to the story.

840106,2,6304287100,"The Astro-Zombies (Ted V. Mikels, 1968)

Over the past year or so, The Astro-Zombies, one of the films that sent Ted V. Mikels down the path from serious movie director to maker of exploitation trash, has mysteriously disappeared from the IMDB Bottom 100. It currently has a rating of 2.2, which ties it with such timeless film classics as Epic Movie (currently sitting at #76 on the list) and a movie I recently reviewed, the Paris Hilton vehicle Nine Lives (#77). But it's not there. I'm not sure why that is, but I buy it; The Astro-Zombies is far from the worst movie I've ever seen. It's not even the worst movie I've seen this week. (That honor goes to Schizophreniac: The Whore Mangler, which I'll be reviewing right after I finish this one, and which somehow has a 3.4.) Don't get me wrong, it's still a bloody awful movie, but it is at least technically somewhat competent, has some big-name (at least for the genre) actors who really can act (kinda), and has a coherent plot, at least if you're on some sort of controlled substance.

Do you really need a plot summary? Okay, then. Dr. DeMarco (John Carradine), a researcher who has been cast out from the fold, has holed up with his assistant Tyros (The Blob's Vincent Barbi) in a secluded fortress-like laboratory where he's been experimenting with making Astro-Zombies. Why are they called Astro-Zombies? Well, there's something nuclear about them, though it's never quite explained what, but they're very much human. In fact, they're made from mixed parts of folks that Tyros has gone out, abducted or killed, and brought back to the lab. Now, one of the Astro-Zombies has gotten out and spoiled DeMarco's surprise, alerting two different groups to their existence: there's the cops and the good-guy scientists, all led by the dashingly handsome Holman (the great character actor Wendell Corey, who died of liver failure not long after the movie's release), and then there are the foreign agents Satana (Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!'s Tura Satana) and her ominous sidekick Juan (Where the Buffalo Roam's Rafael Campos), who want the technology for their own twisted means.

It's all a mess, to be sure, but it's a glorious mess. Corey poses. Satana glowers. Carradine...gets far too little screen time. Mikels, who is still very much active (and is, in fact, working on a third Astro-Zombies movie as I write this; the sequel was released in 2002), is a decent director, if nothing special, and knows where to put cameras to get maximum effect. That effect may be unintentional hilarity, but still. This is not a movie that you're going to want to go seeking out, unless you have a thing for bad movies, but if you happen to catch it on late-night TV and there's nothing better on, it's a hoot. * ",1285027200,,2761,4.781970649895178

840108,4,6304287100,"Astro Zombies is another legendary ""worst movie of all time"" playing second or third fiddle to Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space.  And also like that film, though bad as it is, something actually clicks and the film becomes entertaining.  So, it's a bad film, but not a truly bad film because a truly bad film would have no entertainment value at all(Michael Bay's Armageddon for example).
Schlockmeister Ted V. Mikels whips up a bizarre drive-in tale of spies, government agents, extremely fake looking solar ""zombies"" and insomnia curing mad scientist lab scenes.  John Carradine is making these ""Astro Men""(a kind of synthetic human made from live human parts.  An early form of a cyborg if you will.)to be used in space travel.  In the Frankenstein tradition, Carradine's first Astro Man has the brain of a psychotic or something and is out on a killing rampage.  Carradine doesn't seem give a s*** about this in the least as he starts production on a new Astro Man.  Also in the Frankenstein tradition is Carradine's mute, hunchback-like assistant.  Meanwhile, government agents and spies(led by Tura Satana of course) are all trying to track down Carradine and get a piece of the Astro Man action.
Astro Zombies is known for it's very low budget(though it's not as shoddy looking as Mikels' the Corpse Grinders), low production values, low quality acting and FX, and just low everything!!!
But it's fun!  In fact, I probably liked this movie more than I should have.  That's not to say you will, but if you dig cult films, Astro Zombies is required reading.",1240358400,,1563,4.842105263157895

The hat that 'Juan' wears as Satana, himself and their deceptive partner drive through L.A. using the device that Spock used on Star Trek to search for life on the surface of planets is a fashion statement! The scenes shot in broad daylight that are supposed to be taking place at night...the head that's chopped off that's clearly a wig stand with flanged edges...I could go on and on...but, again, this movie is worth it just for Tura Satana's role as 'Satana'.

840203,2,6304287100,"I am continuing my mission to review every movie with the word ""zombie"" or ""dead"" in the title.  I'm on the fence when it comes to ""Astro Zombies"".  It's barely a good ""bad movie""; and comes quite close to crossing the line into being a bad ""bad movie"".

First, and most important, what strain of Zombie are these Astro Zombies?  These are the solar powered, plastic ""space man"" masked, stabbing and killing variety of zombie.  There are no flesh-eaters here, but these zombies are so unique that they are almost endearing.  Especially when one has to run around holding a flashlight to his solar panel, so he may ambulate at night when his power reserves are low.  The zombies get a 6/10 for uniqueness.

The gore is barely existent.  A few splashes of red here and there, and some jiggling hearts and brains in jars.  Gore score: 1/10.

Speaking of jiggling, the gratuitous sexism and nudity is low on the scale as well.  The zombies ""happen"" to rip open their victims' shirts while stabbing them, but it's so poorly shot that it doesn't really matter.  There is one naked dancing girl, who is painted head to toe, and another young lady strapped to a torture table (for no reason what so ever).  Once again, these scenes are poorly shot/lit/edited.  Late 60's jiggly score of 3/10.

Unfortunately, the zombies in this movie are barely in this picture.  Most of the film is taken up by John Carradine using a screwdriver.  Or John Carradine flipping a switch.  Or John Carradine telling his hunchback assistant about how he is going to flip a switch.  Or the hunchback giving the camera a creepy look.  Or federal agents talking in a room about John Carradine flipping a switch.  After a while I found myself fast-forwarding lengthy sections of this movie.  Boredom scale (0 being boring, 10 being Dawn of the Dead) 3/10.

Cheesy dialogue.  A good ""bad movie"" will have a wealth of terrible one-liners and pseudo science.  A bad ""bad movie"" will have dialogue too bad to make fun of, and acting worse than a 70's soft-core porn movie.  I did enjoy the cheesy dialogue in this film.  The best source of laughable lines came from Tura Satana, who was so cool and cruel that she almost seemed out of place in this film.  Her bad acting was far better than everyone else's terrible acting.  I give Astro Zombies a delicious cheesy dialogue score of 7/10.

Overall, I can't recommend this movie to fans of Zombie films.  It is o.k. if you have a fascination with bad movies, though.  Try to rent it, or pick it up used for under five dollars, if you are curious.",1175472000,4,2559,4.59070796460177

840206,2,6304287100,"Unlike other truly horrible B-movies, like lets say Ed Wood's movies, this movie lacks the entertainment factor and becomes bogged down in numerous sub-plots and intricacies. Over all the movie is pretty boring.

Everybody is trying to get their hands on the ""Astro-Man"" who is sometimes referred to as an ""Astro-Zombie."" The Chinese spy, Satana, who never actually identifies herself as from that country, desperately wants to deliver the all-obeying ""Astro-Man"" to her government. The authorities and the mad scientist's former partner also are looking for the ""Astro-Man"" who was stupidly ressurected from a psychopath's brain and is now on a murderous rampage through town, killing off young gals.

The movie is flawed in almost every way. Many scenes are dragged on for much too long, especially in the labortories. The mad scientist talks to his wannabe Igor in B.S scientific lingo for a  good chunk of the movie. If it made sense then it might have then made a valuable addition to the movie unfortunatelyu it does not and is as I earlier said B.S. The director decided to plop down numerous scens like this throughout the movie. Also it was never explained how the authorities came to the conclsion that a zombie was killing people. They tried to somehow make sense of it and they were not able to. Yes, I know this is a B-movie, it isn't supposed to make sense.

However the most egregious flaw in this movie is also what makes this a sub-par B-movie is that the zombies were only in the movie for about 5 minutes. The first zombie was exposed to us in the first 5 minutes then dissappeared for about half an hour. Instead the movie focused more on the ridiculous and boring sub-plot of spies and police officers which was neither funny nor scary nor anything that should be in a 'quality' B-movie. When we finally get some zombie action by the end on the movie we are already bored out of our minds and then dissapointed that that action oly lasts for less than 5 minutes.

The movie fails as a good movie but more importantly it fails as a B-movie as it is boring and overall not funny. I would recommend a little bit of use of the fast forward button if I were you.",1093132800,3,2178,4.6175710594315245

840208,3,6304287100,"Oh, where to start? The movie, co-produced by Wayne Rogers (Trapper John from M*A*S*H) is a bit difficult to follow, which is not one little bit surprising seeing that it is the directorial brainchild of Ted V. Mikels. The plot is fairly typical B movie fare, but has a few subplots and distractors to keep the viewer on their toes. The movie shows off the ample talents of Tura Satana as much as possible in the lead role of ruthless Chinese spy. She and her two henchmen (one is a Hispanic man who may be supposed to be Cuban, all we know is that he likes to dance around with his switchblade a lot, the other is a cranky old coot who reminds me of Abe Vigoda with constipation) are trying to get the secrets of lunatic scientist John Carradine's Astro Zombie project. When John enters the film, the problems start.
Carradine and his conveniently mute French Igor character, 'Franchot"", work in a lab in a huge mansion bringing back people from the dead. This is not a good situation. While Tura is pretty (as are the good lab assistant women we meet later), and the spies vs. the CIA subplot is kind of interesting, as soon as they show the lab I cringe because only one thing happens there: Carradine explains every painful little bit of his procedures to Franchot is pseudo-science technobabble like ""We must feed this memory circuit through the emotional quotient rectifier!"" This just never ends. Apparently Wayne Rogers picked up a physics textbook, flipped to the glossary and started writing. Man, the Carradine stuff is just painful. The only thing that is good about John's lab is his equipment. He has all the bubbling test tubes, of course, but when he is doing his dirty work he straps what looks for all the world like a colander to his victims head; no doubt it has something to do with the dekrelnification redundancy circuiting of the gauss plasma ion generator of the prefrontal cortex of the brain stem. (But I digress. Of course John will tell you what it's for; I must have dozed for a second during that monologue.)
Eventually, the cops get involved and start looking for the Astro Zombies, who are, of course, on a killing spree. There are many plot cul-de-sacs to be negotiated, including my favorite which involves the absolute lamest 'exotic' dance that I have ever seen in a movie; yes, even worse than in Mikels' much better ""Girl In The Gold Boots"", from 1969 (and notably starring the same male lead.) The three spies lug around a radio detector thing that makes the exact same sounds as Spock's panel on Star Trek, and locate Carradine's lab. The spies try to hijack the Astro Zombies, but Carradine sees the error of his ways, and the good guys show up. For some reason the head lawman (we aren't sure what agency they are from, but are led to infer the CIA) brings his girlfriend to the bust. It is a wild melee and justice is served. I particularly like the John Carradine/Tura Satana joint death scene and the zombie with a machete.
This movie has some fun spots for bad movie fans like me. It has some hilarious scenes, like when the zombie holds a flashlight to the photocells in his forehead to get recharged. It also has some classic day/night confusion a la Ed Wood, and this is compounded by the fact that some of the film is way too dark, especially when the spies and CIA guys are having a shootout in the apartment complex (I may be wrong, but that apartment complex looks to me to be the exact same one from Mikels' later film ""The Corpse Grinders"". Did Ted live there?) The wacky plot and all it's needless but fun twists are big pluses, but I just couldn't give it more than three stars for the huge chunk of John Carradine rambling on about infusing the memory proteins in the hydrogen recombiners, or something like that. Good luck!",1074556800,28,3783,4.556534508076358
840209,3,6304287100,"Lets face it. The point in making a movie like Astro Zombies is not to win an Oscar, it is to take 10K$ and turn it into 50K$. The flick opens with a shapely middle aged woman driving what is now a vintage Mustang convertable through her ""Malibu"" neighborhood while listening to upbeat elevator music on the radio. I know this because the camera made a point to film the radio twice. Well as soon as she parks her car in the garage, even with the barking dog outside trying to warn her, an Astro Zombies' smoke alarm goes off and she gets nailed. A promising beginning eh.
We have a host of bumbling C I A men trying to track down the zombie. How we ever survived the cold war is a mystery to me. Now the spies: Satana,representing Red China. Juan, representing Cuba. Yes, and there was an Oaf from the DDR. Satana had to be the worst spy in history. The only interrogation she performed was on one of the Bumble Bureau agents. She asked him. ""Who are you?"" (Something Juan had already learned from his wallet ID.) When he doesn't answer she burns him with a cigarette and tells the others to kill him. Alas, cigarettes were only .30$ a pack back then, so she could afford to have a little fun. Then when she finally confronts Carradine who plays the mad scientist that created the zombies, she tells him they want his knowledge. Lo' and behold the first time he does something she doesn't like she shoots him in the back. Satanas' great looks make up for her lack of interest in James Bond Movies of the time. But, I beleive even Bubba the redneck could take one look at her and tell that, ""That's a commie spy.""
Now Juan, looks like a Hispanic member of the Monkees. He loves to kill folks with his switchblade. I know this because he appears to have an orgasm every time he makes a kill.
As for the German Oaf he's just there for Juan to have someone to stick when he attempts to cut Mao and Castro out of Zombie Technology.
One of the coolest characters in the film is Franchot, the Mad Scientists' assistant. Since he is mute' he doesn't have any lines.
Carradine, who has been in more movies than I can remember is contantly fidgeting with fake looking lab equipment and explaining to Franchot what is going on. He does crack me up when he tells Satana he must destroy the ""crazy"" astro zombie, right after re-animating it. Then he says he can focus on the astro man whos' brain is morally pure. This was five minutes after Franchot pumped Lime Koolade mixed with carbon dioxide pellets into the neck of a lovely, vibrant young woman, stapped to a slab.(Who had her whole life ahead of her.) Makes you wonder what his version of a morally sound mind is.
I first saw A Z back in my ""blurred years"" (early 20's)at a drive in theater. Since I was blurred, there were many gaps in the film. so I purchased the DVD.
If you are a collector of horror/gore genre. I say go for it. But, please remember you are not going to stimulate your intellect with this film.",1072051200,12,2961,4.346570397111913
840210,3,6304287100,"""Astro Zombies has two major flaws. #1- Not nearly enough of Tura Satana! Of course, I could watch a 3 hour movie of her just standing around smoking cigarettes!! #2- Way, WAY too much meaningless babbling from John Carradine (as the astro-scientist)! Listening to him explain everything to his henchman ""Franchot"" is like watching your mother-in-law knit! His scenes (which take up like a third or more of the movie) are excruciatingly painful to both mind and body! They drag on and on until inducing a coma-like state. A limbo between suicide and hysteria. The rest of the flick is cool enough, with it's solar powered zombies, spies, thugs, cops, murder & mayhem, etc. Ted V. Mikels ain't no Hitchcock, but he just might be hitch's neighbor's brother's gardener. Enjoy...",1056412800,19,775,4.969230769230769
840211,4,6304287100,"Indeed, as a zombie film, it hardly has the right to use the plural in the title. Two zombies are available, but only one appears in a mobile fashion for the largest part of the film. As far as the zombie meter reads, there are far more in prior films like 'Last Man On Earth' and even way back in 1933 with Legosi's 'White Zombie'. It would be unfair to kick it out of the running for a fun film, though.
Essentially, the plot involves a mad scientist, (played wonderfully by John Carradine), has lost his job with the government and goes rogue to create 'astromen', or walking corpses able to survive in the rigorous environs of space. So far, so good. Adding to this, Tura Satana plays a sultry and violent vixen as an agent of a foreign government trying to obtain his secrets, and some government agents looking for the scientist.
This film is pretty campy with wooden acting, but you didn't expect less with such a title, now did you? It is, however, a fun kind of campy movie with a concept reminescent of 'Frankenstein', including an Igor character. An overweening 60's style fetish for fake-looking blood and scantily clad women being attacked, Astro Zombies doesn't offer much new concerning these old cliches. Some humorous diologue, and funny scenes (check the Astro Zombie holding a flashlight to his head!).
If you enjoy camp movies with a budget not equal to the concept, Astro Zombies is a fine film. Acting wise, only John Carradine shines, though Tura has talents beyond the poor dialogue provided. It fits the time well, and a fine introduction into zombie concepts on film 1 year before N.O.T.L.D.
As a DVD, it really is pretty sparse; the print has a couple of glitches, though it's presented in a nice widescreen and very watchable.  Ten scenes to choose from, nice packaging, and a very messy non color corrected theatrical trailer.",1051315200,6,1855,4.707692307692308

There was the barest hint of a plot, toy robots for no reason and characters who acted like they were drunk/stoned/partially embalmed.  Pretty girls in skimpy outfits was the only selling point.

But now there's an actual reason to buy the movie after the MS3K crew gave it the riffing it so desperately deserves.  There were times I laughed so hard at their jokes that I had trouble breathing.  Other commentators correctly noted that there were audio issues where you couldn't hear the movie, but if you've heard the dialog you wouldn't mind missing some parts.",1497398400,3,661,4.7631578947368425

If you buy the blu-ray or dvd you basically have two choices: you can either hear ONLY the Rifftrax commentary comfortably and NOT hear the movie audio, or you can turn the volume up to where you can hear the movie audio just fine, but the Rifftrax commentary is blaring! When you buy a Rifftrax movie from their website, they do the perfect balance of movie audio and commentary audio. That just simply isn't the case in buying this physical copy of the movie. If you want just the movie then everything is fine. The picture is crisp and clear. The audio is good.

Watched this with the RiffTrax, and the mix is horrible!  You can't hardly hear the movie at all!  And I'm talking about the times where the guys aren't riffing.  It is WAY too quiet!  This also effects the riffs, because if you can't hear what the characters are saying, a bunch of the jokes don't land.

7867692,5,6304287100,"The Kino Lorber blu-ray release of ASTRO ZOMBIES (1968) -- a movie unwatchable without this disc's RiffTrax commentary -- is the best-looking transfer we'll ever see of a movie that looked like crap even when it was new. Ted V. Mikels (""Girl in Gold Boots,"" ""The Doll Squad"") shoots the film in his trademark who-the-hell-can-afford-good-lighting-anyway style, alternating between washed-out color and impenetrable gloom.

Mikels, never a fan of tight plotting, outdoes himself in the incoherence of this story. John Carradine, playing a mad scientist for the millionth time, revives the dead in an effort to preserve the world's most brilliant minds; what he gets are bulletproof, skull-faced zombies obsessed with tearing the clothes off the women they attack. Sleazy government agents, who could belong to the FBI, the CIA, or the NRBQ for all the movie cares, race double-D spy Tura Satana and her minions to find Carradine and his leering, hunchbacked assistant first.

The movie deserves and gets the full RiffTrax treatment: it's got enough blatant sexism, amateurish acting, mumbled dialogue, mismatched shots, shoddy, zero-budget sets, tedious car-parking and knob-twiddling scenes, and vertigo-inducing whip pans for two or three movies. Director Mikels and horror historian Chris Alexander provide two additional audio commentaries for those who can't get enough of ASTRO ZOMBIES. Kudos to Kino Lorber for the reversible blu-ray inlay card. Both illustrations are ridiculous, but it's nice to have options.",1476403200,8,1517,5.5344827586206895
