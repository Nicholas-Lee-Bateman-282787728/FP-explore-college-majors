If it was not for Winston Churchill's undaunted leadership and his inspiring speeches, I and many more millions like me would have perrished.

This extremly authentic historical DVD, in his own voice and his actual visual presentation, will lay proof that he WAS the greatest and most important humanbeing of the 20th century.

UPDATE Jan. 25,2006

I am a fanatic Winston Churchill enthusiast.

I find, that Sir Martin Gilbert,the most authoritative person still alive, with many (official) written biographies that he has authored on Winston Churchill, along with the last (and no longer living) son of Winston Churchill, who benefacted Sir Gilbert and also authorized Sir Martin Gilbert, to become the official biographer of Winston Churchill.

Since I had previously bought ""Biography of His Life and Speeches"" DVD, (among many other such dvd's,) I have recently also bought the (two disk)""Winston Churchill (2000)"" DVD that Sir Martin Gilbert supervised and narrates.

After collecting a vast amount of documentations, books,DVD's, as well a vast amount of memorabillia, pertaining to and about Winston Churchill. As far as all the DVD's regarding Winston Churchill that I own, I consider THIS ""Winston Churchill (2000)"" DVD the most authoritative (warts and all)and being the most informative (DVD) biography on the life of Winston Churchill.

If you truly are interested in the history of WWII and the part that Winston Churchill played and was actually was responsible of the victory of WWII, then THIS (""Winston Churchill (2000)"" DVD is THE ultimate essential DVD.

Amazon. Com has (limited) copies available.
