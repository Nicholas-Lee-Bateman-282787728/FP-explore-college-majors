4188365,5,B003SKWR6O,I LOVE this workout!  Super easy to follow but yet a very challenging workout.  It is by far my favorite!,1305936000,2,105,4.2
4188366,5,B003SKWR6O,This is a kickboxing workout that is effect and easy-to-follow. Fans of kickboxing will like this workout. The three sections are great to do separately or combined. The moves are not too jarring for the knees nor back. Chris Freytag is a great motivator and not annoying at all. Time flies when you do this workout. I recommend it!,1304726400,6,332,4.6440677966101696
4188367,5,B003SKWR6O,"This is a great workout.  I love the moves and I definitely see a difference in my legs and overall muscle tone.  There are 4 different workouts and I do two at a time so my workout totals 30 minutes each time.  I am instantly sweating, which is great, and I have seen fast results.  Chris Freytag is a great instructor.  Highly recommended for someone who loves the burn and wants to sweat to something new.",1300147200,7,408,4.315789473684211
4188368,5,B003SKWR6O,"This workout is a lot of fun, but it's quite challenging! I'm an intermediate exerciser and I've had to work up to being able to do the whole thing from beginning to end. The first section (kickboxing) is the easiest, but I work up a light sweat and it gets my heart rate up a bit. The second section (abs/core) is fairly simple, but effective, and by the end my heart rate is really up there and I'm sweating. The third section (body sculpt with weights) is killer after the first two. Sometimes I actually do it first before the other two sections.

Chris Freytag is a great instructor, motivating and energizing, without being annoying. This dvd is definitely harder than her other Prevention workouts though. I have her 3-2-1 Workout and Abs Advantage dvd's and didn't find either to be as effective as this one.",1299888000,8,816,4.589041095890411
4188369,5,B003SKWR6O,"I view myself as an upper beginner/intermediate exerciser... at the gym 5 days a week with a mixture of cardio and weight routine. However, with road construction around the gym... I purchased some videos to fill a void....

At first I didn't really like this video but it is because I had to get used to the kick boxing moves. I am new to aerobics videos and have since viewed other kickboxing videos and have really come to appreciate how spot on Chris' cueing is and how simple this video is. Compared to many other kick boxing videos this one is so uncomplicated and easy to follow. I flubbed my way through Kimberly Spreens Combat Surge kick boxing the first time; which is also advertised as uncomplicated...(another good video, a bit more intense though) I found the kick boxing section in this video with Chris to be easier choreography wise.

This is a great cardio video, however just as an FYI, I found that Chris focuses a lot on squats... I didn't know this so I worked my legs the day prior to this video at the gym and tried to use this video as my cardio day. HA HA. Well, my legs are definitely burning now.",1297382400,3,1124,4.42512077294686
4188370,5,B003SKWR6O,This DVD is so enjoyable & motivating. Fantastic music and of course nothing but the best instructor-chris Freytag :) LOVE HER STYLE A+,1288656000,,135,4.913043478260869
4188371,5,B003SKWR6O,"I was looking for a kickbox video that was fun and challenging. I enjoy kickboxing and do a lot of tae bo and was looking for something new to try. This fits the bill. Chris Freytag is an excellent instructor and has great cuing. The workouts are challenging but not exhausting. I got a great cardio workout along with some resistance training.  As I have problem knees, this workout didn't put any unnecessary pressure or strain on my joints. Highly recommend it.",1285459200,21,464,4.658536585365853
4188372,5,B003SKWR6O,"Take charge of your health!

Some of you may recognize those instructor's names from their ten minute solution DVDs.  Cat did the modifications.  The combinations are not very original, but they definitely get the job done.

I was disappointed that you can only select play all sections (Fat Blast, Ab Attack, and Body Sculpt) or an individual section.  When you select play all, you also do a warm-up and cool-down.  If you just select an individual section you don't.  Both warm up and cool-down sections were adequate preparation or cool down for each section.  There is also an introduction, an Express Kickstart, and Kickbox 101.

Fat Blast (20 minutes)
You warm up with boxer shuffles, moving squats, half-jacks, and knee thrusts.  The workout consists of typical kickboxing upper body (jabs, hooks, upper cuts, and crosses) and lower body (front, back, roundhouse, and sidekick) moves.  The routine should not be difficult to pick, if you have experience with kickboxing or use the Kickbox 101 segment.  You are always moving so you really do blast the fat.

Ab Attack (16 Minutes)
In this section you target your midsection (obliques, upper, and lower abs), and even your back.  Instead of doing all crunches, you do a kickboxing routine that focuses on moves that work your core and some floor moves.  Some sample kickboxing moves are side to side squats with elbow thrusts, knee thrusts and side arm pulls (like what you would find in Tae Bo), rotating torso, kicks with arm pulls, squats with punches.  The floor moves are different variations on the plank.  There are also some moves lying on your side. For example, for one move you lie on side with legs at 90 degree angle and stacked on top of each other.  Make sure to lift abs.  Place arm closest to ground at 90 degree angle and your other arm straight at aide.  Then you pull in arm and lift up leg.  For the next variation you straighten both legs and lift them up at same time. Finally, you do some typical crunches, but add punches when you pull yourself up.  This section is also 20 minutes.

Body Sculpt (17 minutes)
This section incorporates combination moves that work upper, lower, and core together.  Pick up weights, if you are going to use them (the modification is not to). Hold one weight in each hand and do reverse lunges.  First, alternate between each leg.  Second, stay on one leg and do hammer curls.  Third, as you bring leg up from lunge, kick leg and punch opposite arm at same time.  Switch legs.  Next, is a squat series with arm rows.  Following that, you move on to a series of diagonal lunges.  Then, add punches low and high on first one side and then the other.  Alternate sides.  Next, you do static lunges with a series of slow punches on first one side and then the other.  Following that, you put weights down and do a series of different jump rope moves.  Next, is series where you alternate between plies and squats with ""speed bag arms.""  Pick up your weights.  You will do a series of bicep curls with both arms while you kick back one leg.  Next are side arm raises with palms facing upwards.  Then, you keep arms raised while you curl your arms in and out.  Then, you lift up, curl in, and lower.  Then, you start lunging and lifting arms straight over your head with palms facing inward.  Go back to lunging only.  Next, lunges with jabs.  Next, you drop the weights and hit the floor for push-ups.  Pick one weight up and do a tricep press back with one arm, while you kick opposite leg back.  Switch sides.

Express Kickstart (10 Minutes)
This section is for when you are short on time or want to play with the other sections.  The routine has typical kickboxing moves (jabs, bob and weaves, boxer shuffles, squats, front and back kicks, jump rope, etc).  It has its own quick warm up and cool-down.

Kickbox 101
You learn the kickboxing moves and terminology used in the routines.  The instructor focuses on proper form.

I enjoyed the DVD and will definitely use it again. I debated giving it 4 or 5 stars for a few reasons.  First, you can't mix and match the different sections, only play all or one.  Second, the moves are effective, but not very original.  However, I decided on five stars because I liked that is has the Kickbox 101 for newbies and the moves are very effective.",1283990400,47,4809,5.025348542458809
4188373,4,B003SKWR6O,Easy to follow and easy on your joints. Love kickboxing,1413331200,,55,4.6
4188374,5,B003SKWR6O,"I love Chris Freytag and I love this workout, too.  Sure.it's not all, 100% kick boxing, but the moves in this one work and you will get a GREAT work out.  If you're looking for just kick boxing, this is not the work out for you, but if you're new to kick boxing it will help you to learn some of the moves.  I love the different segements and the bonus work out at the end is great if you want to get a work out in, but don't have a whole lot of time or just want to do a little bit more.",1396224000,,489,3.6826923076923075
4188375,5,B003SKWR6O,This dvd is great and it will get your heart pumping. Give it a try I workout with Chris 6 days a week. I love this kickboxing dvd.,1394496000,,131,3.7142857142857144
4188376,5,B003SKWR6O,"It is a good workout.  I have several kickboxing dvd's and I rotate them to keep things interesting.
I use my weighted gloves to this to get an even better workout.",1393545600,,164,4.290322580645161
4188377,5,B003SKWR6O,I love this video. This is a lot of fun plus Chris Freytag is so motivating! I would highly recommend.,1390262400,,102,4.15
4188378,5,B003SKWR6O,"This is one of my favorite exercise videos, and I have many.  Chris Freytag is an excellent instructor with clear cuing and decent musicality.  The workout has a lot of variety and the moves are safe and effective.  I would categorize this workout as intermediate to advanced, but not hardcore like P90X or something along those lines--so if that's what you are into, look elsewhere.  It is divided into sections of cardio, abs, and strength with a bonus mini- workout you can do alone or tack on to the complete workout.  Highly recommended for video exercisers!",1387152000,2,563,4.822916666666667
4188379,5,B003SKWR6O,"I love Kickboxing!  Chris Freytag is awesome!  She isn't irritation like many other fitness coaches.  I specifically sought out a DVD by her after doing a 40 min kickboxing workout of her on exercise TV. This has good variety in quick workouts.  I can mix and match to get different lengths of workouts.  Get it if you are on the fence!

Cons:  you can't select specific workouts and link them together.  You have to select the next after you finish one if you didn't want to do the whole things straight through in the order they have.
And...no warm up if you don't start at their beginning.

Overall though, I'm so glad I bought this.  I can do 8 minutes fast....or 15,  or pair those up for a 23 min workout,  two 15's for a 30 min workout,  45 min,  or even all 3 main workouts with the 8 min express for 53 minutes.

The moves are fun,  it gives me a good energy boost and/or workout.",1386374400,,889,4.233532934131737
4188380,3,B003SKWR6O,"I usually love chris Freytag but I found this dvd a little disappointing, I didn't even break a sweat.  I guess I do it every now and then on days when I don't feel like working out :-)",1372032000,,185,3.8684210526315788
4188381,5,B003SKWR6O,"I am a Chris Freytag fan anyway, but I really enjoyed this DVD.  She is a very motivational trainer, and she keeps you going when you feel like stopping.  I also like the fact that she has another girl (I can't remember her name) that doesn't do the advanced moves.",1369785600,,265,4.28
4188382,5,B003SKWR6O,"I really like this dvd its effective and has a nice doable pace. The choreography is simple and overall it's a really fun workout. I easily get bored with dvds, but not with this one because I love Kickboxing and it has a nice variety.",1369353600,,235,4.2444444444444445
4188383,5,B003SKWR6O,Chris Freytag never disappoints.  This workout is challanging but easy to follow and you have options for how long you want to commit to doing.,1367193600,,143,4.72
4188384,4,B003SKWR6O,"good, but some of the moves don't really flow.  wish there were more ""kicks"" in it.  Not too crazy about some of the music.  But, a decent workout",1363478400,,146,4.142857142857143
4188385,5,B003SKWR6O,Kickstart Your Metabolism is an awesome fitness DVD. Of Course I am a big fan of Chris Freytag and I purchased several of her DVDs. This is my most recent purchase after actually misplacing the one I had before. I enjoyed it so much that I had to replace it. For people who are looking to start their fitness/weightloss routine this is an awesome buy. If you want to switch up your routine I advise purchasing her other DVDs as well. This is my 11th. Helped me lose 40 lbs! Now how awesome is that!,1346198400,3,498,4.252631578947368
4188386,5,B003SKWR6O,"Excellent cardio workout with simple moves so you don't have to worry about memorizing choreography. I just wish each section was longer rather than just 15 minutes, but overall I love it.",1335830400,,188,4.90625
4188387,2,B003SKWR6O,"This DVD gives you a nice workout, but really isn't kickboxing. I was hoping for something more extreme. It does have a nice pace to it.",1334534400,3,136,4.269230769230769
4188388,5,B003SKWR6O,"Love, love, love Chris Freytag workouts. I have an extensive workout DVD library at home to prevent boredom but I find myself going back to Chris Freytag's workouts.  She makes the most of the workout time by combining upper and body moves, and she is never annoying.",1334534400,,267,4.680851063829787
4188389,4,B003SKWR6O,"I do like Chris Freytag as an instructor, she is always encouraging. I consider myself an intermediate/advanced & I didn't find the cardio sections of this very challenging. It was too repetitive for my tastes. That being said, I really enjoyed the "" Body Sculpt"" section - used only 5 lb weights but I felt it. I enjoyed the weights/kickbox combos. I will work this one into my rotation on light days.",1334275200,,402,4.597222222222222
4188390,5,B003SKWR6O,"I love this kickboxing routine.  Chris Freytag is so funny and encouraging.  She is like having your own personal trainer.  She challenges and encourages.

Love it!!!",1333411200,,166,5.269230769230769
4188391,5,B003SKWR6O,"Chris Frietag's videos are so good, but I don't feel like I'm exercising for less than 20 or 30 minutes.  The Prevention DVD is too short.  I'm looking now for the 40 minute Chris Frietag kickboxing video that I saw in 2011 on Exercise TV.  That DVD is really worth my time and money.",1333065600,,284,4.222222222222222
4188392,5,B003SKWR6O,"This Chris Freytag DVD is one of the best exercise videos I have ever used.  It is a fun and decent workout.  It contains some unique moves.  Chris's direction is so easy to follow and she is also very encouraging.  I've always found side kicks difficult, and there are lots of them in this DVD, but I can still keep up and get a good workout.  I like the option of watching parts or all. Chris is a wonderful teacher. I can't help but smile when I'm following this one. Highly recommended!",1329523200,2,490,4.282608695652174

8404404,5,B003SKWR6O,"I love this workout! This is my 2nd Prevention/Chris Freytag DVD and both are great workouts. I like how it is broken down into segments so that I can do just a quick 15 minute workout, or extend it to 45 minutes if I want. Chris is also a great instructor; she explains things at an easy to follow pace and isn't suuuuper annoying like some instructors. She is the perfect balance of spunk and motivation.",1433289600,,406,4.355263157894737
8404405,5,B003SKWR6O,"Lots of fun and you can really feel it the next day. I like how it has so many different levels of difficulty. I'm on the easy level now, but I'll be doing the hard stuff soon!",1426464000,,176,3.7837837837837838
8404406,4,B003SKWR6O,"I am enjoying this video so far.  She does expect you to know the lingo used in a gym because she says it and jumps to that move and you are like ""what?' what's that move again?  She explains it as she goes.  She keeps it moving yet you don't feel like an idiot because you can still keep up.  It's all good.",1425859200,,308,3.8412698412698414
8404407,5,B003SKWR6O,"Great workout.  Simple, effective and easy to figure out.  You'll be on target the second time you do it.  If you like Leslie Sansone this one is a step up.  It works all areas with a faster pace and a bit more intensity.  Chris is more of a friendly trainer than a chatty friend which is nice for a change.  When you watch a video over and over for years the chatter gets in the way of the workout.  There are 3 main workouts and I've found that pairing them is best for about a 32 minute workout without my body having complete muscle fatigue the rest of the day.  Chris does love squats and all the usual side step, grapevine type moves along with the kick boxing routines.  Her goal is intensity and powerful use of the muscles to tire them out. Most of it is low impact and I did a few simple modifications to do all of it that way.  Great for us middle agers to keep things from sagging too much.",1424304000,,902,4.102857142857143

8404410,5,B003SKWR6O,"I've tried a lot of exercise videos, and I think this one is my favorite. I've enjoyed several videos by Prevention that feature Chris Freytag, and haven't been disappointed. I would highly recommend this video to others looking for a great exercise video. The only thing that could be a drawback is the fact that you do need a good several square feet of space.",1414454400,,362,4.584615384615384
