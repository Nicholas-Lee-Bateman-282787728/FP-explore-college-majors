1739819,5,B00006AUMZ,"I finally bought this when I should have done so long ago. This movie is surprising, suspenseful and unique. It caught me off guard. Impressive for a directorial debut. Would be interesting to see what more he could do.",1518307200,,219,4.641025641025641

1739821,5,B00006AUMZ,Definitely not what I expected. A magnetic screenplay that does not stop and the ending is abrupt and surprising.,1513036800,,113,5.0
1739822,5,B00006AUMZ,"One of my favorite, most underrated movies of all time.  Matthew McConaughey narrates a story about him and his brother growing up in motherless household with a father who claims to have been told by an angel to do God's work by killing ""demons"" in the guise of human beings.  One son believes, the other does not.

The movie moves at a fairly slow, but consistent pace; the setting, the atmosphere, the tone of the movie are perfect for this movie.",1510704000,,450,4.530864197530864

1739842,3,B00006AUMZ,"It was okay,  Always love Bill Paxton (RIP).  The child actors were particularly good.  I really didn't think it was Scarey or suspenseful.  Not sure why anyone would give it 5 stars but to each his own,  A good little twist at the end and I liked the eventual explanation of what was happening when the father touched someone,  I am glad that this was made clear by the end of the movie as I thought the father was just randomly killing people because he was insane ( not that he wasn't insane!)",1503705600,,496,4.279569892473118

1739867,1,B00006AUMZ,"The dialogue is so astonishingly hokey that the first few minutes make you think you accidentally watched one of the lesser episodes of Columbo. Paxton has no eye for setting up shots and zero ability to film action. Flaccid instead of tense, with wooden performances from all the actors, this is a straight-to-inflight film if ever there was one.",1501718400,,347,4.898305084745763

1739869,1,B00006AUMZ,"There's only one reason to write a story like this, and that is to justify vigilantism. The movie takes the viewer on a trip through the eyes of reality, the entire time making the viewer think this is another case of a psychopath mass murderer. Of course, they drop little clues to make the viewer think that maybe the murderer really does see something through supernatural means. In the end, the killer reveals that he has some magical power that can see people's crimes, which bad guys must be punished for. So the killer is the hero? The writer of the story just justified murderous vigilantism. It's these little poison pills in movies that twist the minds of mentally ill people and make them think crimes are ""god's work"". But then, you can call anything ""art"" and wash your hands of repercussions.",1497830400,,806,4.683098591549296

1739903,5,B00006AUMZ,"TOTALLY worth viewing! I thoroughly enjoyed Mike McConaughey's performance, although it isn't his most challenging, just very intriguing and well executed. The film was intellectually spooky (no ugly half-deads jumping out of a closet) that went to my core (that disturbing kind of spook when you saw Linda Blair's head twist around 360 degrees for the first time in The Omen) and I found myself satiated on it's close, and then scaring it down on streaming to see it again six months later. You've nothing to lose by giving this a once through...you might even add it to your thriller collection.",1495584000,,597,4.920792079207921
1739904,4,B00006AUMZ,Weird movie but good  !  t u  Peter,1495152000,,35,3.125
1739905,5,B00006AUMZ,"A fascinating film that takes a very different take on how a serial killer is created, ""Frailty"" became the late Bill Paxton's debut film as a director (he only directed two) and it remains a masterful thriller with great performances from Paxton, Jeremy Sumpter and Matt O'Leary as the younger versions of the characters played by Matthew McConaughey and Levi Kreis. The late Powers Boothe also gives a nice performance in a supporting role as an FBI Agent pulled into the case of a serial killer.

Fenton Meitks (McConaughey) turns up at the local FBI office and tells an amazing story to agent Doyle (Boothe) -- the serial killer they are looking for is his brother and Adam (Levi Kreis) he was turned into a killer by his crazy father (Paxton) who believes God has chosen him a d his sons to aid in the final battle between Heaven and Hell.

I don't want to give too much more away as this moody thriller deserves to be seen spoiler free as much as possible. ""Frality"" is a remarkable character study as well as a thriller that features strong performances and a sure, steady hand from the late Bill Paxton as director and star.

Recommended.",1495065600,,1146,4.607843137254902

1739912,1,B00006AUMZ,"This is a truly repugnant film. A religious zealot is ""told by God"" to kill people who ""look like normal people"" but are actually ""demons."" Not only does he proceed to kill half a dozen people with the help of his six year old son, but (oh, SPOILER ALERT!) it turns out that it really WAS God who told him to do it! ""Surprise! Surprise!"" as Gomer Pyle would say, this is a CHRISTIAN SPLATTER FILM!!!

Bill Paxton must have been one sick puppy to create a film in which a six year old child is trained to become a Serial Killer in the name of God! I know that (in the real world) this is the way genuine terrorists and Ku Klux Klansmen are created, but to pass this film off as ""entertainment"" is chilling. SICK! SICK! SICK!",1489881600,,723,4.201438848920863

1739934,3,B00006AUMZ,"The story was very interesting and it kept me wanting more. However, the way that it turned out was very underwhelming. I'm not sure if that was the point of the movie or not but it made me feel like I was the crazy one. Watch to see if you can keep up and to see how you end up interpreting the movie.",1489104000,,302,3.8095238095238093
1739935,5,B00006AUMZ,Great Horror film. Bill Paxton at one of his best role's ever.,1488844800,,62,4.25
1739936,5,B00006AUMZ,"Every once in a while a unique, intelligent, spirited film comes along that's completely different from the generic hyped same old story stuff we seem to be force fed to we're like viewing drones. Frailty is one of these rare delights. Frailty is a 100% gripping, unapologetic, manipulating little suspense horror film that grabs you by your terror bone and shakes you relentlessly while twisting you through its delectable story. There's no mercy even up to the wonderfully unpredictable end. Bravo to screenwriter Brent Hanley for the intelligent and wickedly scary story!

Taboo subjects and mental ""frailty"" are addressed with an almost Hitchcockian flare. I was surprised to find out this was Bill Paxton's (RIP brother) first film as a directorI mean it's so tight and precise. I think had there been a less sensitive a director Frailty could have been nothing more than some run-of-the-mill hack fest; which it is decidedly not.

The film starts as Fenton Meiks (Matthew- all-scruffy-looking-MEOW- McConaughey) waits in an FBI agent (Powers Booth) office late one night with a tale about a wanted serial killer. Fenton explains he knows who the ""God's Hands"" killer is, er, was. The killer was his brother Adam, who just took his own life. The agent listens and ultimately takes Fenton to the Rose Garden where Fenton claims his brother, and many of the victims' bodies lay. As they drive to the small town to the terrible site Fenton flashes back with the tale of his twisted childhood and our horror begins. It's 1979 and the Meiks' boys are busy growing up in their loving home with their widowed dad. Dad (Bill -uber creepy- Paxton) is one of those unsung great fathers; involved in their daily routine and is open with his love. The smiles abound and the wonderfully normal American family looks like a poster for single parenting done right. It's an idealic home front

Till one horrid eve when dad wakes up the youngins' from a deep sleep with a madman's tale. He's a tad upset but manages to calmly, and disturbingly logically explain to the two young boys that an angel has visited him from God. The angel, he explains, told him the families true mission while on the Earth is to basically kill for God himself! They will be given a list when called upon. This 'list' will expose the demons that walk among them disguised as regular townsfolk. These demons must be destroyed, and the lucky Meiks family has been chosen for the gruesome duty. Night night sleep well....kisses.

Fenton ( The younger played by Matt O'Leary) thinks his father has popped a gasket and may need a mental facility--pronto. Dad is talking about killing people after all. Younger lamb eyed Adam (played by lamb eyed Jeremy Sumpter) agrees with his father and thinks the lord's work is their duty. Demons are bad and the family is now kind of super hero's for the lord. They are God's hands at work.

Super creepy or what?",1488844800,,2912,4.80439121756487
1739937,5,B00006AUMZ,"This movie is so good. It's in my Top 10 for sure. Bill Paxton kills in his role. Pun intended. Well, not initially, but as I was writing it, I recognized the pun and then smirked as I kept writing.",1488499200,,198,3.975

1739939,5,B00006AUMZ,"Most reviewers have been careful not to reveal the plot.  I will try to do the same.  To me, the main question of this film is, where do serial killers come from?  From that it asks, given such depravity, are there then demons?  What about angels?  If God were to send an angel to speak to you, how would you know if you were sane or insane?  This is a dark movie but one I found intriguing.  Just remember -- very, very dark.",1488067200,,426,4.0602409638554215

I won't spoil it, but I think it would've made for a more interesting story if it had ended differently. Good movie though, and I recommend it.",1484092800,,284,3.830508474576271

1740144,4,B00006AUMZ,"**************Possible Spoiler Alert***********
This movie definitely left room for interpretation. For example, because there were two scenes of Fenton's/Adam's character being killed--one scene of him shooting himself and another of McConauhay's character possibly beating him up with a pipe--I wonder if McConauhey's character had multiple personalities. The only characters we saw outside of his stories were him. Was there ever really a brother? I think McConauhey's character did all of the killings--in the name of god and also as a demon. He made a decision to ""destroy"" Fenton which gave him the feeling that he can rightfully say that he never ""killed"" anyone as Adam. If there was a brother (Fenton), wasn't Adam committing a sin for misleading the FBI agent--which leads to the question of who's to determine which sin is greater? Overall, I like thought provoking movies and this one is one of them. There are so many angles and layers to it. I wonder if this is what the writer wanted or if the message is clearer than I think.",1454803200,,1041,5.023121387283237

1740151,5,B00006AUMZ,"Frailty is one interesting thriller, even though the conclusion and the events leading to the finish are pretty confusing (because we don't know exactly who did the killings).  It's about a man played by Matthew McConaughey (before he annoyed us with his presence in all those redundant car commercials we see on TV every night) walking into a police station claiming he knows who killed a bunch of people to an FBI agent (the agent played by the underrated Powers Broothe).  Matthew's apparently the older brother and claims his father and younger brother are responsible for the murders.  Of course Powers doesn't believe this mans claims because he doesn't initially back it up with any kind of substantial evidence... that is until he shares his story.  And it's quite the disturbing story indeed!

The movie now flashes back to his childhood to tell the story.  We see two brothers (Matt O' Leary and Jeremy Sumpter) and their father (Bill Paxton) who appear to be a normal functional family living together in a small country house.  Everything's a little too good to be true.  The sons are very respectful towards their father, and the father is equally as nice.  However... one night while the boys are asleep the father walks into the bedroom, wakes them up and claims he received a message from God.  Get this- the father says he's been instructed to kill people that are demons.  People who walk around disguised as people but are actually demons.

Apparently just by touching them, Bill can strongly sense if they're evil or not!  The kids are young and vulnerable and eat it up... well the younger brother does anyway.  Over and over Bill claims that none of this might not make much sense now, but it will soon because there's a battle of good versus bad taking place in heaven.  The sunlight... er, the angelic light shining down on a barn while coming home from work is proof enough for Bill that he must go through with his mission to kill, as is the moment while at work as a mechanic he's fixing underneath a car and looks up to see another sign.  I'm trying really hard not to laugh at all this unbelievable silliness because it's obviously far-fetched (and even unintentionally comes across as such) but the movie turns out to be too disturbing to make fun of.  The writing never really touches on the subject of the father being mentally ill either.  You'd think when the movie switches back to the conversations between the FBI agent and Matthew McConaughey we'd get some answers.

I like how Matt O'Leary's character questions everything his father says and does, even risking potentially destroying the relationship between the two, because his actions make no sense whatsoever.  I was preparing for the father to explode on his son violently given his now bizarre/unsettling change of personality but that never happens (thankfully!)  Bill does question if his own son is a demon however but refuses to believe it.  Instead... well this is a slight spoiler- he later makes his son (Matt O'Leary) dig a humongous hole in the ground and basically works Matt to the bone, and later after questioning his father's actions for the last time Bill forces his son underground until he can see the light and actually see God.  That way Bill will know that his son sees demons too!  Of course what's really happening is that Matt's getting delirious due to starvation and claustrophobia symptoms and is near death due to being trapped for so long.  This is what makes Frailty VERY disturbing.  To make matters worse, the other younger brother (Jeremy Sumpter) constantly sides with their father which messes up the relationship between the two brothers.  They used to get along just fine until Jeremy decided to jump ship and stick up for his father.  Matt constantly remains reasonable at least.

Since the movie often jumps back and forth between Matthew and Powers in the present time as Matthew unravels the story (while the meat of the story focuses on the father and two sons going around kidnapping and killing victims because these people are apparently demonic and this is all supposedly God's work) it's unfortunate that the ending doesn't really make sense.

Let's just say we're not really sure which brother is responsible for the killings.  I *think* the way we see the events unfold on screen are accurate and true, but it's possible the plot twists at the end reverse the roles (after Matthew leads Powers to the spot of the dead bodies) and it's actually Matt O'Leary's character (the older brother) who was sticking up for his father the whole time and going through with the killings.  I don't know man, it was pretty confusing at the end.  Either way REALLY suspenseful, and disturbing to see a father try to brainwash his two sons into doing the unthinkable and kill.  Great movie, but not just anyone can watch a movie like this.",1450742400,,4867,4.789221556886227

1740195,3,B00006AUMZ,"I have to wonder if Amazon's Hand of God might have sprung from this movie, which has pretty much the same scenario, only we get a God-fearing Dad instead of a corrupt judge.  Bill Paxton took matters into his own, starring and directing this film from a Brent Hartley script.  Paxton more or less pulled it off thanks to the help of Matthew McConaughey as one of his grown-up sons, who narrates this grisly tale of dubious faith that looks like something taken form the Grimm Brothers.  In defter hands, the movie might have reached the metaphysical heights it appeared to be reaching for, but it barely transcends camp horror thanks to a clever plot twist in the end.

When Dad Meiks gets his vision from an angel, cleverly projected on a trophy, he involves his sons in a gruesome killing spree to rid the world of demons masquerading as human beings.  Paxton doesn't give us too many details as that would have spoiled the ending, which this film depends on.  As a result, the viewer  is left to guess what is driving Dad, as he seems like a decent enough guy.  Is he experiencing some kind of post-tramatic stress from the Vietnam War, as the initial story is set in 1979, or from the loss of his wife, or has he just gone crazy as Fenton tries to explain to his younger brother in hopes that they can both escape their father's clutches.  But, young Adam is drawn into his father's vision and stands by him, or so we're told.

Mercifully, Paxton spares us the brutal scenes, although the film still ended up with an R rating.  PG-13 would have been enough.  More disturbing is how religion drives the father to carry out these horrible acts of violence in front of his children.  This kind of fanaticism is what you expect to see in cults, but Dad Meiks is on a one-family mission to rid the world of evil that apparently only he can feel with the touch of his hand.  It is a worthy subject to explore, but Paxton relies much too heavily on suspense to carry this film, giving him little room to explore the metaphysical aspects of a demented quest like this.  The film also speeds too quickly to an end not to lose the viewer's attention.  It is clear that the main goal of this film is to provide a shocking plot twist and make the viewer think it over.for a couple days, like a pastor would a clever sermon.

This film is less about faith, or frailty for that matter, but rather whether we should accept what we see on the surface of persons or what we imagine to be the darker lurking demons beneath.  Only the last victim appears to have a dark side.  The others look like innocuous persons which Dad Meiks plucked from the phone book, so that we are just as much in doubt of his mission as is Fenton.  It is pretty hard to accept your father chopping up persons based on a single touch unless you can experience the same feeling, which apparently young Adam does.  Anyway, the film will hold most viewers' attention and give a few something to think about afterward.",1442275200,,2978,4.427522935779817

1740201,5,B00006AUMZ,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Frailty"" (USA, 2001)

1. This is one of the most underrated psychological horror movies of all times.

2. Its theatrical release was really only into art houses, and it's still pretty unknown today - probably because the sensitive subject matter and extremely dark undertones keep it from being talked about much.

3. Matthew McConaughey kind of stars in it as a guy named Fenton, but most of the movie is a flashback to Fenton's childhood in Texas, where he lived with his younger brother Adam and their father (played by Bill Paxton, who also directed this movie). One morning, the father tells his sons that he got a vision from God and now he needs to destroy demons. Adam is excited to help his father, but Fenton is much more skeptical. As Fenton learns what his father means by ""destroying demons"", the three develop a strained relationship.

4. I can say no more about the plot. The less you know, the better, whether you want to see the movie or not.

5. The script and the acting are so tight and tense that it manages to be a pretty shocking horror film even though it shows almost no blood.

6. The movie makes some serious statements about religion. It also makes you reflect on family and what you would (and wouldn't) do for them.

7. There are different levels of sadness and horror here, depending on how deep you want to look into the darkness.

8. I've seen the movie four times in the past 13 years and I'm still chewing on the ending. And the title.

9. This is a bold, unflinching contemplation of the terrors of faith and the trauma of childhood. It's a legitimate ""hidden gem"" of American cinema, and will probably always remain that way.",1439596800,,1691,4.536184210526316

It is my understanding that he obtained financial backing for the movie and lent a hand in not only the Production but also some Directorial work in this chilling masterpiece of a film.
This is NOT a movie one should simply rent but if ever there was a movie worth purchasing for re-viewing from time to time, this is one of those.
I just happened to stumble on the movie being a McChonoghy fan as well aa having enjoyed a number of films Bill Paxton had starred in. I didn't go in expecting much but sure left amazed that I had found a true gem of a movie.

1740264,5,B00006AUMZ,"This is one of those small gems that slips in and out of theatres before anyone knows about it.  Highly recommended for anyone who wants a thoughtful movie that takes a few unexpected but highly believable twists and turns before reaching a great conclusion.  The movie is about a father and his two sons who are living a quiet unassuming life until the father receives a vision that he says is from God.  This vision tells him that there are demons among us, and the father and his boys must kill these demons.  One of the sons believes his father with all his heart.  The other thinks the father has gone crazy.  What happens from there is truly remarkable story telling.  The movie challenges what you believe, and why you believe it.  It is a bout faith, loyalty, and betrayal.  The description may sound like an odd premise for a movie, but it really works.  This is a movie that you will want to watch twice so you can see where you missed the clues the first time.  For the parents - It is not a slasher movie.  There is some violence, but it is more tension violence than on screen violence.  It is not gratuitous in any way.  There is not any overly offensive language.  It is a movie you can watch with your older teenagers.  It has some religious undertones to it, but nothing that is in any way preachy.  Highly recommended.",1411344000,,1336,4.409836065573771

I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, because what seems to disturb people the most, specifically those who hated the film, is its spiritual content, specifically its Christian references. The film is also superbly acted and directed, but people with a heavy anti-Christian bias will not allow themselves to admit that.

Story told mostly from older of two boys perspective. Subject matter Involves serial murders - or does it (?) - you decide.

Mathew McConaughey delivers on of his best performances and Bill Paxton does a fine job as the single father of two boys. This  movie is Paxton's labor of love - his 2001 directorial debut - and quite a sleeper IMO.

It isn't as visually impressive or as intricately woven as those movies, but what it aspires to, it executes with minimalistic competence. It suffers in spots from bland dialogue and wooden acting, and I never felt truly terrified at any point in the film, but the movie does succeed in pulling off an interesting twist that flips the audience's perceptions of what happened earlier. One drawback is that Frailty subsists entirely on the revelations of its final act. There isn't much to be gleaned from subsequent viewing because the film is straightforward and not particularly challenging in the artistic sense.

In the end, this is not a film you will regret skipping, but might be worth an hour and a half of your time should you stumble across it on late night cable. You would be better served seeing Se7en or The Usual Suspects.",1391126400,,963,4.836363636363636

1740315,4,B00006AUMZ,"I liked this movie although I thought it was a little slow.  It kept my interest and I thought it was an interesting plot.  What has bothered me and prompted me to write a review is the pro religion/anti religion outcry over this movie. I don't think Bill Paxton or anyone associated with making this movie is trying to force religion on you or sending you a warning.  It's a movie, that's all.  Just like the Exorcist was a movie.  It's for entertainment purposes.

I thought it was an interesting twist at end.  For whole movie, I thought the father was some crazy religious zealot and his son followed in footsteps killing innocent people.  To find out they were really killing demons all along was best part of the movie.  Especially the FBI agent.  That was unexpected.

Ending was much better than if the anti religious fanatics had their way and...someone ended up in mental hospital for criminally insane?  Snore.",1384560000,,921,4.6875
1740316,3,B00006AUMZ,"FRAILTY (2001) reminded me a lot of the TV series Grimm  but with a backdrop of religion instead of fairy tales.  The story is told by Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey), who goes to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth) with information on a serial killer called the Hand of God.  The killer, says Fenton, is actually his younger brother Adam, who has just committed suicide.  The rest of the film is then Fentons flashback story about his father (Bill Paxton), a religious fanatic who believed he had been visited by an angel who ordered him to destroy the demons hiding among us.  As Fenton explains it, both he and young Adam were enlisted by crazy Dad to help him round up and kill a number of ordinary-looking people, chopping them up and burying them in a rose garden.  So is it any wonder poor Adam turned out to be a serial killer, just like dear old Dad?

Its fairly obvious in the first half of the film that Fentons father is insane.  The horror  and its definitely horrifying  is in Fentons predicament.  Paxton is very convincing as a lunatic assassin, wielding an axe he believes has been handed to him by an angel of God.  And Matt O'Leary, who plays Fenton as a child, is totally believable as a boy torn apart by his fathers insanity.  Should he assist his father in his deranged activities, or should he risk his fathers vengeance by turning against him?  Its not an easy dilemma.

Unfortunately, there is a major twist in FRAILTY that undermines Fentons story.  Because a deranged religious fanatic is only a monster if hes truly insane.  If he isnt, then he's really a hero, right?  At the start of this review, I compared FRAILTY to Grimm, a television series focusing on a different sort of demon hunter.  In the series, Nick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli) is able to see fairy tale demons hiding among us  we might see only a cute girl with a nice smile, but Nick sees the monster underneath.  So Nick is a hero  he goes after the creatures of the night to protect the rest of us.  But its all based on fairy tales and folklore, not on things a whole lot of people really believe!

In FRAILITY, Fentons dad isn't going after Blutbaden and Hexenbiesters  hes going after real demons (the devils spawn, even) on a mission of God.  And if hes truly Gods emissary, then hes doing the right thing when he hacks a woman to death, or when he drags a middle-aged man into the back of a van, or when he buries the body parts in among the rose bushes.  Right?  I mean, if hes NOT insane, then hes a holy man.  And if hes a holy man, doing Gods work, then hes blessed among men.  And anything Fenton might do to try to stop him is . . . well, its wrong.  Right?

At the end of this film youll be asking those questions.  And if you're like me, you won't have any answers.  FRAILTY would have worked a whole lot better for me if the answer to the ultimate question (is Fentons dad crazy, or is he really Gods right-hand man?) was left open ended.  Because once you know the truth, you're stuck with a reality that is just too close to some of the craziness that has really happened in this world of ours.  A whole lot of people do a whole lot of terrible things in the name of God.  FRAILTY suggests that terrible things aren't terrible at all if God has ordained them . . . even if its an axe-wielding lunatic whos carrying them out.

I appreciate the performances in FRAILTY, and Paxtons direction is on point and compelling.  This is a gripping film.  But its also disturbing, and not in the expected ways.  The true horror of FRAILTY is that there are tons of people who will watch it and believe  really believe  that God directs people to do horrific things in His name.  And thats too scary, even for a horror film.  Watch this one with a huge grain of salt  and talk about it afterwards.  Because once we accept  even for a little while  that a serial killer can be doing Gods work, then were truly lost.  Good film, creepy message.  Be warned.",1384041600,,3960,4.363511659807956

1740390,5,B00006AUMZ,"(Note: this review contains NO SPOILERS!)

""Frailty"" is a truly unsettling film, a rare movie that questions the power of faith and religious devotion.  All too often, popular works raise issues like these, then fail to deliver the goods...but that's not true here.  And, as a result, we're left questioning not only what we've seen, but our own beliefs as well.

And that's really it, after all, given any work of fiction: don't we always ask ourselves what we would do in such a situation?  Would we fight for what we believe, even flying in the face of danger?

Here, however, we're not simply opposed by a big palooka with a big gun.  We're faced with our own faith, and the power of our belief -- in conflict with everything a rational person holds to be true.

""Frailty"" is not afraid to ask the big questions, and one viewing will not be enough to answer them all.

That this film is directed with conviction by actor Bill Paxton is relatively amazing.  Impressive as an actor (logging over 75 movies, he is probably best remembered for his ""Game over, man.  Game over!"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B001609SQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>), he has done nothing of note as a director EXCEPT for this film...and what an extraordinary film it is.

The movie begins with Matthew McConaughey's character Fenton Meiks coming into an FBI station in Dallas on a dreary, stormy night  with a mind-boggling confession to make: he has been part of a homicidal string of murders known as the ""God's Hand Killings,"" and needs to speak to lead investigator Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe).

From here on in the film travels back in time to describe those killings, and to the role the young Meiks played in them...along with his younger brother Adam.  The two boys live with their father (Paxton), a widower whose wife died before movie began.  Their life is not idyllic, but comfortable; that is, until Dad rushes out to tell the boys that last night he received a vision from God, and he and the boys have been given a divine mission: to find ""demons"" and destroy them.

While the impressionable Adam is quickly aboard with his father's quest, Fenton is disturbed when he finds out these ""demons"" look like ordinary men and women.  True, their father has their names on a list he says God gave him, but to Fenton their father's actions constitute murder, plain and simple.

Soon, their father gathers his materials: the list, an axe (which he names Otis) and a pipe (for knocking out the demons), a pair of gloves--soon to be explained, and a pit they must dig beneath a shed, where their missions will be finalized, and their bodies are soon after buried in a  rose garden behind their house.

The first mission goes off without a hitch...Dad comes home with a female ""demon"" whom he carries down to the pit, and when Dad takes off his gloves and places his hand upon her he is struck by a vision and ""sees"" her crimes, which are left undescribed to us, but he clearly finds them to be horrible.  Called upon also to touch her by their dad, Adam claims to see her deeds as well, but Fenton does not, and believes that his father is crazy, and Adam is brainwashed not only by his love for his father but also by his need to believe him.

And thus the heart of the movie is laid bare:  are his dad's visions real?  Was he truly visited by one of God's angels, or has he gone crazy?  Is he truly smiting demons, or is he only committing murder?  Fenton clearly does not believe his father, and director Paxton intelligently does not allow us to see anything other than what he describes, leaving us to decide what we would do in Fenton's place.

There is more to this movie...the plot makes some twists and turns that deliberately disorient us, and thus our own decisions are tested.  Boothe's character clearly does not believe the authenticity of the confession he is hearing, and toward the end of the movie he accompanies McConaughey to the rose garden itself, where we will learn the ugly truth behind it all.

The beauty of the story is that the layers do not get peeled off all at once, but bits at a time, and the result is a movie that you can talk about for hours afterward.  I have seen the movie three times, and each of them has revealed levels to me that I did not grasp before.

Many viewers have questioned the meaning behind the title of the movie, and after thinking about it I will leave behind my not-so-terribly cryptic clue.  I believe ""Frailty"" refers to humanity's greatest weakness concerning our belief in God-- in the absence of hard proof.",1360972800,,4626,4.6786155747836835

1740393,5,B00006AUMZ,"This is one of my favorite horror/suspense films. I recently bought the blu-ray to replace my DVD copy.

A very creepy film, it took me three viewings to finally get what was going on. Bill Paxton (who also directed the film) plays the father of two pre-teen boys. One night he announces that God has visited him and has given him a mission. The father along with his two sons will hunt down demons and destroy (not kill!) them.

After destroying their first demon (who looks just like a human) the younger son is on board with the mission, the older son rebels and thinks his father is loony. The father punishes the older son for his own good, he wants the older boy to get on board with their mission to kill demons.

As the flim opens, one of the sons (now grown up) contacts the FBI as the other son has become a serial killer.

At the end there is a twist that took me completely by surprise.

The film is creepy and violent, but the violence is mostly implied. All of the killings take place off camera.

1740408,3,B00006AUMZ,"Before writing this review, I read many of the other posts. INTERESTING. But, I can see how this movie could create some controversy.
Firstly, I think the acting was, basically, good. The two boys, I thought, were very good.  Bill Paxton was good and Mathew McConoughhay was very good.
I thought the movie was fairly predictable, but that did not dull the IMPACT because this is about some pretty GRIM stuff (serial killing, demons, visions and instructions from GOD, FOR STARTERS).
This is not what I necessarily like to watch, but for what it is, I thought it was pretty well done. I will share this DVD with people who like this genre.
This movie is not necessarily about religion or religious fanaticism--it's about INSANITY. The two are NOT ALWAYS mutually exclusive.

Regardless, I finally finished it and it is THAT good that even with the inconveniences of a crappy stream, this movie was unbelievable.

***SPOILER ALERT***

First of all it is FULL of twists and turns.  Some I saw coming.  Others I totally got blown away by.  Frailty is difficult to label.  Is it horror?  Some parts about it, like the blind faith and brainwashing clearly could scare any sane person.  Or how about the fact that it wasn't impossible to sympathize with the father.  Other parts of the movie are more of a mystery/suspense story being played out by the narrators memories.  I was always thinking during this movie and appreciating the characters and the plot.

Bill Paxton is incredible as an average widower raising 2 kids who suddenly begins having visions which to his older son look suspiciously like the ravings of a madman.  Matthew Mc-whatever is surprisingly clever and enjoyable as his adult son who relives his past in a confession to the FBI.  The rest of the cast was great though I didn't notice any other big names just actors that were vaguely familiar (like Sal from Deadwood as the FBI agent).

I liked how the movie constantly was pulled between the fathers faith and proof (like always just knowing where to go to find his demons) and Fenton's skepticism and facts and up until the very end the viewer is never really sure which is right.  I was extremely entertained during the entirety of the story.  Im a huge fan of Bill Paxton and seeing this I understand how he got cast for HBO's Big Love, another favorite of mine.

Overall, I rated this movie 5 stars.  I considered giving it less cuz of the streaming problems I had but I don't want to take away from such a fantastic film just because amazon failed to properly deliver it to me.",1351036800,,1949,4.561959654178675

I personally enjoy the whole moving inculding the ending to it because I like to think at end of some movies to see if I was right about who the killer is and or so forth.

1740420,1,B00006AUMZ,"I have watched this film twice now, though ironically not because I thought it was great but because I could not believe how disappointed it left me. The beginning is fairly believable (free of spoilers) and builds up fairly interestingly but as the tale stretches on, it's difficult to understand exactly who Bill Paxton's target audience is. (spoiler alert) Are we really to believe that you can decide that someone is a ""demon"" from a few (supposed) snippets of a person's life? Doesn't circumstantial evidence or possible mental instability come into play at any point? You would have to be someone of either very low intelligence or very poorly educated to believe that those targeted by the killer are ""evil"". That said, towards the end, we are shown short scenes which supposedly prove that those targeted by the dad are ""demons"" but essentially, what we see are the usual cross-section of individuals targeted by religious fanatics in the news as ""evil"" (people who ""kill babies"", people who dare to have sex for reasons other than procreation, guys who live at home with their moms rather than follow the whole ""wife and two kids in the suburbs"" ritual of adulthood, etc. etc, etc,) Are you bored yet? I know I was. I was really hoping to get an interesting mystery about what it's like to have to live with mentally unstable parents but instead what I wound up with was an hour and a half, Christian conservative propaganda film justifying the vilification, judgement (and murder) of human beings whose lives and personal choices we do not agree with. Scary stuff indeed, but not for the reasons intended by Bill Paxton to be sure. The interesting thing I've learned here today, is that apparently dumb, rednecks now can make blockbuster films in place of thoughtful, well-educated worldly individuals. Yeesh! Bill Paxton really should stick to acting because writing (and directing) really aren't his forte. Feeling slightly ill now so I think I'll go watch something by Francois Trauffaut or maybe Akira Kurosawa.

Here is a superbly creepy & disturbing film. A single father believes he's been chosen by God to destroy all the ""Demons"" on his list. He drafts his two sons to do God's bidding, as they stalk the ""Demons"" & kill them one by one. One child is skeptical & horrified by his father's actions, as the ""Demons"" look like humans. The other dives in head first in the killing spree, that adds a body count so high, that the FBI is on their trail.

Intelligent script, great acting, & great direction by one Bill Paxton in his first directorial debut. A ride for the mind, & a trip for the soul. Are these ""Demons"" real, or is the father a complete religious psychopathic murderer?

The twist was brilliant in that it was well executed AND it back-tracked to let you know how and why the movie is what it is.  This movie also harkins back to a lost movie making tool that lets the viewer's own interpretation play a role.  It lets you draw your own conclusons to the small gaps in the storyline, which for me, adds to the overall appeal.  Sometimes things get lost in translation when plots have to be jammed down your throat, and this one allows you to do your own swallowing.  Great acting job from everyone involved...okay, except maybe for Becky :-)  Glad I stumbled across this little gem again and I'm glad to be able to add it to my collection .",1322956800,,731,4.223021582733813
1740438,5,B00006AUMZ,"SPOILER ALERT!

(This review contains spoilers so don't read this unless you've already made the smart choice of watching this incredible film!)

First things first:  I'm a horror and thriller film junkie -- if it's part of either genre, chances are I've seen it.  ""Frailty"" holds the top spot on my list, hands down.

Matthew McConaughey walks into an FBI office, after-hours on a rainy night, asking to speak to the agent in charge of the God's Hand serial killer case.  (With Powers Boothe playing the agent, it's a joy watching these two commanding actors in a simple head-to-head exchange.)  McConaughey identifies himself as Fenton Meeks and rather matter-of-factly informs Boothe that his younger brother, Adam Meeks, is the God's Hand killer, something that all began with their father (Bill Paxton), the original God's Hand killer.  Intrigued, Boothe listens to McConaughey's story and the film kicks in, with McConaughey as the narrator, taking the audience back to the 1970's and a small Texan town (props to the set designers for the beautifully shot scenes and set design -- very minimalist yet evocative):  Bill Paxton (who both stars as the dad AND does a BRILLIANT job in his directorial debut) is a hard-working automotive mechanic and widowed single dad, happily raising his two healthy, well-adjusted boys, Fenton and Adam.  All is well in the Meeks household, until dad suddenly informs the boys one night that he has received a vision from an Angel.  The mission?  As part of the war between Good and Evil, there are demons that must be destroyed and it's Dad's mission to do it, who has been assigned a small role in this war.  The crux?  The demons are in human form.  Uh-oh.  Dad was told he will receive the names, and weapons, to carry out his God-given task.  Adam, the younger boy, eagerly jumps on the ""superhero"" bandwagon while Fenton, the eldest, is understandably thinking: ""Dad's lost his marbles.""  We the audience, of course, empathize (as we are expected to) with rational Fenton.  As Dad reluctantly but somberly seeks out and executes several of the demons one by one, Fenton resists -- to us, the audience, Fenton is the sole voice of reason against his fanatic, seemingly-insane father and his all-too-naive little brother.

***SPOILER ALERT***:  The twist???  (and this is what makes this film one-notch above sheer brilliance) Dear ol' Dad wasn't insane after all.  And McConaughey isn't Fenton but rather Adam Meeks.  The seeming ""victims"" Dad and Adam eliminated (we later learn in quick flashbacks what Dad and Adam could see upon touching their victims before executing them) were indeed demons: a child molester, a matricidal murderer, etc.  OK, well, we the audience wonder, ""maybe these insights were a product their insane minds?""  Nope.  In one of the last scenes, with the FBI agents feverishly reviewing every tape to identify the man who walked into the office (McConaughey), the tapes are all inexplicably blurry on facial recognition.  Indeed, seems McConaughey was right when he confidently proclaimed: ""God will protect me"" (in my mission).

So what makes ""Frailty"" so genius?  Setting aside how one feels about its premise/conclusion, it is incontrovertibly UNIQUE.  In 95% of Hollywood films of the past 25+ years, the supernatural is ridiculed, always giving way at the end to a revelation in favor of the 'rational' and scientific answer.  The ""witch"" is always simply a victim of hysteria, the religious are always mere fanatics proven wrong by the time we walk out of the theatre, the medieval Crusader is always broken, cynical, and disillusioned.  ""Frailty"" has the chutzpah to actually posit the idea that, hey, maybe there ARE supernatural forces out there.  Maybe there ARE demons and angels?  Maybe there ARE people who are, perhaps not demons themselves but influenced by demons at certain points in their lives?

Those who are hostile to religion and easily offended by the notion that there is Good and Evil on earth will, of course, hate the film for that very reason.  But those who aren't religious yet are good sports and have an open mind / enjoy a good thriller, will be able to appreciate the film, if only for its provocative and original conclusion.  And those who are religious, across every spectrum and denomination, mild or extreme, will be grateful for a film that finally presents the supernatural's existence as a possibility.

You know those films you watch with someone and can't stop talking about and analyzing it for hours after?  This is one of those.  A GEM.",1322352000,,4555,4.9880636604774535
1740439,5,B00006AUMZ,"I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It ranks up there in the top of psychological thrillers. I was never a Bill Paxton fan, but he did an excellent job directing this. A very dark and sadistic movie that takes so many twists from the norms of society. It is one of those rare movies that stays with you. I would rank it up there with ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Psycho"", but that is just me.",1320364800,,416,4.085365853658536

I felt so disturbed by the father turning into for better lack of word, a fanatic demon killer. The transition is overnight, so you are left asking yourself is he crazy, he must be.  Then he includes the boys in his crazy mission.  At this point you really start to feel sorry for the boys, but then the movie takes a twist, that I didn't see coming. Everyone did superb acting in this movie, and I was quite surprised to have liked it so much.",1303776000,,631,4.338983050847458

1740442,4,B00006AUMZ,"I will not go into lengthy detail about this movie as it already has nearly 300 reviews already.

I watched this film for the first time nearly ten years after its debut. I enjoyed how the movie left all the gruesomeness to the viewer's imagination. I thought the story was well laid out and of course there is a twist toward the end.

Perhaps the only thing I would suggest is that the movie had a lightheartedness about it that left me unaffected by the movie. What I mean by that is after I view a scary movie I am usually haunted by it and think about it for hours afterward. I personally think a good scary movie is good because it has the ability to leave you feeling affected in some haunting or disturbing way. I did enjoy this movie a lot but after the film ended within minutes I found myself thinking about other things in the back of my mind. Not that what I am going to say has any correlation but due to the fact that Frailty has a religious theme to it I just wanted to mention that the movie Stigmata (1999) with Patricia Arquette is a religious based thriller that had me absorbed into the storyline for quite some time after I finished viewing it.

But overall I am glad I watched it and I would recommend this one to friends and family. It has an almost Twilight Zone and/or Alfred Hitchcock modernized quality to it.",1301702400,,1336,4.2936507936507935
1740443,4,B00006AUMZ,"This is a fine movie, heavily reminiscent of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Usual-Suspects/dp/B00005V9HH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Usual Suspects</a>&nbsp;for set-up and dnouement. Bill Paxton is to be commended on producing such an inventive first feature. Unfortunately I also found it lacking in structure with a botched, haphazard ending that could have been handled much more successfully.

The premise is quite stark: A widowed father claims to have been given a vision and mission from God to destroy demons; people he believes God has told him are evil. Suddenly the lives of his two children are thrown into chaos. The older child refutes utterly his fathers calling, claiming him to be nothing but a murderer, but the younger boy is a believer.

The story is told in flash back by the older child, now grown up to an FBI officer, in a similar play to that followed in the Usual Suspects. As the story unfolds a definite empathy builds for the horrific situation the older boy finds himself in; is his father having visions or is he just a serial killer? And there are several heart-stopping moments of drama and genuine shock.

This part of the movie works well and, despite the grimness of the story and situation, is quite gripping. Unfortunately, I also feel this method of storytelling, flash-back, is detrimental to the flow of the film. The beginning and middle, concentrating on the Father and two boys, would have benefited from a continuous, monologue free, presentation. The interview of the now grown older child coming only at the end of the drama he faced as a boy, and only as he is with the FBI officer in the car being driven back to his Fathers old house.

That ending too suffers from feeling slightly rushed. The reveal, the secrets, could have been held right until almost the last two or three scenes. Instead the twist is explained away in a shockingly bad ""now I shall reveal everything"" type speech by the bad guy to the FBI agent. It's clunky at best, yet would need only a minimal rewrite to have kept the tension and reveal until the very end, giving it a genuine Usual Suspects level of twist.

Despite my qualms this is a great film and recommended for fans of films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Se7en/dp/B00011CZRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Se7en</a>&nbsp;and the aforementioned Usual Suspects. It's dramatic and exciting, psychologically scary rather than overloaded with blood and gore and has enough tension and thrills, and a great final twist, to make further viewings worthwhile and rewarding.",1297123200,,2795,5.613744075829384

Nonetheless, a very good movie.",1295827200,,386,5.046875
1740455,4,B00006AUMZ,"FBI special agent Wesley Doyle is called in late at night by a man claiming to know the identity of the God's Hand killer, a serial killer the FBI has been tracking for years. Fenton Meiks claims that his brother, Adam, is the killer. Adam believes that demons are taking over the world, and he has to take them down. But there are too many, too many, and Adam, in anguish, kills himself. Fenton promised Adam, years ago, that he would take him to the ""Rose Garden"" when it was time, and tonight he stole an ambulance with Adam's body to do it.

Through flashbacks, we learn that Adam is Fenton's younger brother, an angelic looking boy who enjoys singing Bible songs. They live behind the deserted Rose Garden, Fenton taking care of his brother because their mother died when Adam was born, and their father works hard as a mechanic. The three men make a picture-perfect home together.

Until Dad has a vision from God. In the vision, an angel came to tell him that the end of the world is near, and demons have been released to fight the final battle. Only a special few know, chosen by God for special jobs. They don't fear demons, they destroy them--they are God's Hands. What follows is a tight psychological thriller that forces us to question our assumptions about good and evil, insanity and faith. Highly recommended.",1286323200,,1326,4.590717299578059

The acting, especially for a young cast, was believable.  Everytime I see this movie, the final scene sends shivers down my spine.  Everything is essentially not what you would expect.  The filming and different cinematic views are in line with the time period that the different scenes were taking place.  The beginning past time frame scenes are like looking at old pictures from the 70's and it's so realistic you feel yourself going back to that era.

Fenton opposes his father and pays the price. He is locked in the shed cellar and left to starve unless he conforms to his fathers demands. Ultimately Fenton kills his father in order to escape the terrible murderous life style. He has been so damaged he becomes alcoholic and is doomed to death by Adam who views him as evil.
  Adam never opposed his father and lived to carry on as a murderer just like his father. He chooses the role of a cop because as  the FBI agent says he has the instincts of a cop.
  This movie is well worth buying. All the actors are outstanding. The theme for me is that the father figure can have a complex and enduring effect on their childrens' emotional and cognitive development.",1278547200,,869,4.509554140127388

1740460,4,B00006AUMZ,"Frailty is a movie that keeps you guessing `till the very end.  We know early on that this is going to be a battle between good and evil, but the tricky part is, you don't know which person is which.
Is the dad the good guy here, acting as a messenger for God?  Or is he the bad guy who's using religion to justify murder?
Is the son really the perpetrator here...or the victim?

This movie definitely messes with you.  Having the possibility where a child might have to be killed is a tricky plot to have in a story.  I've no doubt many people will be bothered by this....especially because of how the child is portrayed throughout the movie.  It's not like you have a clearcut evil villain here, like Damian in the movie, ""The Omen""...but instead have a scared little boy.  Watching this movie made my motherly instincts kick in and I wanted to protect him!  By the way, I thought the acting job by the oldest son was exceptional.  The other cast members performed well, too.

There's a plot twist at the end that's very shocking and very entertaining...but also a little confusing, too.  I mean, I finally understood who was who, but I didn't understand why there was a switch in characters in the first place (I'm trying not to give away the ending).
Anyway, there's not much more to say without giving away the great plot twist.  If you're looking for a suspenseful movie that'll keep you guessing, then this movie is worth checking out.",1271635200,,1442,4.503846153846154

1740462,5,B00006AUMZ,"Frailty.  Frailty.  Frailty.  What do I say about this lovely gem of a film?  It is the directorial debut of Bill Paxton.  Yes, he is the same Bill Paxton of films like Wierd Science, Apollo 13, Twister, Tombstone, and Titanic, among many others.  And is it an amazing film to say the least.

This has to be one of the best, if not the best, directorial debut's in recent memory.  It stars the up and coming star at the time Matthew McConaughey, Powers Boothe, Bill Paxton as Dad, Jeremie Sumpter as Young Adam, and the most amazing performance by a newcomer I have ever seen Matt O'Leary as Young Fenton.

The story is told through McConaughey's eyes in flashback format and the whole movie takes place during a long car ride. (One of the best scenes ever filmed of a car that NEVER MOVED on set.  Amazing.)

It is a story about the ""God's Hand"" killer.  Fenton, played by McConaughey, walks in one stormy night to FBI headquarters and tells Boothe (the lead FBI agent assigned to the God's Hand case) that he knows who the killer is.  Then the story begins and it completely sucks you in.  It has a really eerie Gothic feel to it.  The way that Paxton weaves the story is amazing.  You would think this film was directed by a seasoned veteran.  Also, One of the best things about this film is that most of the violence of the film happens off camera.  It isn't a movie that needs to be gory.  It is scary in the subject matter.  It doesn't need gore to get under your skin.  And believe me, it will get under there.

I will give none of the essential plot away because it is TOO good to spoil.  I will say this though.  If you haven't seen this film, you are missing a wonderful hidden gem.  Buy it or rent it immediately!  You will not soon forget FRAILTY.

1740463,5,B00006AUMZ,"A film (on Blu-ray release) about religious fanaticism as only a Texan could write it. Screen writer Brent Hanley starts with the premise of, ""What if the God of the Old Testament was actively involved in events of the modern world?"" The answer is events not much different than what you see on the nightly news--religious fanatics killing people (""demons"" for some, ""infidels"" for others) in the name of God. Hanley states that he is amazed by the different interpretations people give for this film. That is what brings this film to a higher level than what he originally intended, a Stephen King story line with a ""Twilight Zone"" ending. Comparing this film to ""Psycho"" or ""The Sixth Sense"" is not really accurate either because it carries the weight of our religious heritage. Violence for the sake of scary thrills is one thing, but when that violence is combined with overt religious themes, that is something else. The reason is obvious to anyone who has read the Old Testament--it is violent and too often psychotic. You can blame evil on the devil (as this script does), but who created the devil? Hanley misses the point of why people blame God for the evil in this film, saying they misinterpreted it (in the writer's commentary). He would have looked so much smarter if he said the film was really a satire on Western religion. As it is, we do have some great comic moments: God's ""magical weapons"" being those of a common serial killer--work gloves, a lead pipe, and an ax sent directly from heaven.

One is reminded of the Texas mom who murdered her children saying that she was told to do so by God. Where would we be if every mother did the same when they felt their children were demons? (Of course, Leviticus recommends stoning to death children who disobey their parents). By the way, didn't President Bush say God told him to send troops into Iraq because there were ""weapons of mass destruction?"" These must have been magical too because they completely disappeared when we got there. Must be a Texas thing.",1260576000,,2028,4.7126760563380286

1740499,5,B00006AUMZ,"I remember walking by ""Frailty"" in the video rental store and was interested when I discovered Bill Paxton starred in this, as he rocked in ""Near Dark"". Anyway, a friend of mine recommended this to me (thanks again, Captain!), and I caught it about two weeks ago.
Now, I probably should have reviewed this about two weeks ago, but this movie is so powerful, it's STILL fresh in my mind. If you don't know about the plot, it's about the ""God's Hand Killer"", a father of two played by Bill Paxton, and his two sons. The father gets a religious epiphany that God has chosen him to kill off ""demons"" living among humans in the world, so that the world will be a safer place. Whether or not they were real ""demons"" or just evil human beings, I can't quite recall. Either way, this movie is TWISTED!

What makes this movie so great? Well, it's just incredibly well-written, lots of stunning twists in the plot that you couldn't see if you had the telescope at your local science hall. The acting is also superb. I must admit, I was a little doubtful when I saw big name actors like Paxton and Matthew McConaughey. Not entirely sure why I was doubtful, I just thought getting commercially successful actors in a horror film, a genre that isn't all that commercial (thank goodness!), wouldn't work.
But, THIS MOVIE DOES WORK! It's an intelligent, gripping, psychotically limitless exploitation of a madman. It's almost like getting a first-hand view of what drives a murderer. Bone-chilling stuff, ain't it?
The movie also has a Southern feel, since it is set in the South, and there's something about a Southern feel to movies that just appeals to me.

Well, if you like psychological horror or are a fan of either Bill Paxton or Matthew McConaughey, this is a movie that will blow your mind! It's a deranged look at what drives a maniac, and it's very realistic, and incredibly-well portrayed, so this IS a horror movie ESSENTIAL. Plus, the DVD comes with lots of extra, including the trailer and some commentary by Bill Paxton, who also wrote and, I think, directed this movie (proving that in real life, Paxton IS NOT a maniac! HA HA!) Anyway, this is a very highly recommended, chilling piece of psychological horror, one of the best to come in the last, ten years. It's as good as ""One Hour Photo"", entirely different than it, but still just as good. Ahhh, ""One Hour Photo"", THAT'S a movie I might get to soon.

Anyway, hit the lights, grab some snapple and get ready to get freaked out and amazed at the same time, because ""Frailty"" does just that! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1219190400,,2579,4.602173913043479

Everything about this movie was great, the cast, the story line, how it keeps your attention from begining to end. Here is a short explanation about this movie, it basically deals with a father of 2 who one night claims that an angel came to him to tell him God has a plan for him. There are demons walking among us disguised as humans and it is his job to destroy them and send them back to hell with special tools that God will provide. Needless to say He also drags his boys along for the ride because he beleives what he is doing is Gods work. The movie just spirals from there, you see how it consumes him and his boys lives right untill the end. Great movie 5 Stars, a much watch.",1204588800,,796,4.012578616352202

1740502,5,B00006AUMZ,"Fenton Mieks (Matthew McConaughey) goes to the FBI one night and calmly tells the agent (Powers Boothe) that his father and brother were mass murderers known as the ""God's Hands Killers.""  In flashbacks, we see young Fenton and little brother Adam sharing a good life with their father (Bill Paxton), until the night Dad claimed he was visited by an angel and told to destroy demons.  Dad received the names of his victims from God, brought them home to be killed, and then buried them in a nearby rose garden with the help of his sons.  Little Adam thinks this is all great, but Fenton thinks Dad is crazy.  For his disbelief, Dad puts Fenton down in the ""dungeon"" and leaves him there...

This is quite a creepy, intense, and effective thriller that has kept me glued to the screen for five viewings.  The first time, I was confused about what I saw, but my questions have since been answered.  The script is terrific - the father commits horrifying acts in an almost serene way, because he is convinced he's doing the right thing; this keeps you wondering:  Is he really divinely called to kill demons, or is he just insane?

Star/director Bill Paxton is completely convincing and scary as the father, and Matt O'Leary gives a heartbreaking performance as young Fenton.  This is an unusual and unforgettable horror story.",1200700800,,1324,4.717391304347826
1740503,4,B00006AUMZ,"Given the onslaught of astoundingly stupid horror movies that have hit both the large and small screen in the last several years, it's a real eye-opener and a great pleasure to find one that's truly smart, and doesn't take the audience's brains to be those of 8-year olds, which is typical for fright flicks these days.

Bill Paxton, who directed this effective shocker, also stars as a widowed auto mechanic in small town Texas, present day, who, he says, is visited by God telling him to destroy seven people who are in actuality demons. With two young sons, he sets about his grisly business. This is a frame tale, in which the story is related by one of the two sons, now grown up (Matthew McConaghey), to an FBI agent, Powers Boothe. Paxton is a canny director; as he mentions in one of the several bonus features that comes with the movie, he selected Texas actors he felt were strong choices for the roles--and did a great job with casting.

There are several reasons this is such a great movie. One is that it doesn't hit the viewer over the head with obvious horror cliches; another is that the violence is shown, but not its immediate aftermath, which means the standard blood and gore is significantly minimized. It's clear that what's important here is not the blood and gore but instead the intense psychology of what is real and what isn't in the context of religious fanaticism, and/or emotional desperation. Is Paxton's character driven to this by overwhelming grief--which he can never show--from the loss of his wife? By his own internal demons? Or by actual visitation from God, as he claims?

As Paxton also says in the bonus features, the casting of the two young boys playing his sons was crucial and here again he did a sterling job. The two young actors are superior, terrifically complementing McConaghey and Boothe in their one-to-one standoff, contrasting present day with 1979, when the events depicted (the destroying of the seven demons) actually occurred.

This is a terrific, strong entry in the horror genre and should be seen as such. If you want a movie that is seriously disturbing without relying on cheap shock effects or volumes of blood and gore--and that really does rely on smart dialogue and solid acting to deliver its punch--this is the movie to see.

Definitely recommended.",1197676800,,2320,4.79
1740504,5,B00006AUMZ,"Hollywood more often than not goes out of its way to portray religious (specifically Christian) people as heavies or villains or antagonists, or pompous hypocrites, or just plain mentally unstable nutjobs.  Even though most Americans are themselves religious and statistically Christian, Hollywood heedlessly and brazenly persists in its willful oblivion of and arrogant condescension towards the sentiments held in esteem by the majority of Americans (demonstrated again in the recent spate of anti-U.S. military films that are being released into well-deserved dismal box office failure).  Even Stephen King, an immensely capable writer whose work I have enjoyed and praised, regularly uses religious (Christian) characters as villains or at the very least as buffoonish one-dimensional stock characters meant for ridicule and disdain.  On the other hand, extremist religious sects that actually promote and practice violence are often ignored, or given a sympathetic depiction (SYRIANA), or replaced with implausible politically-correct substitutes - as in the case of the remarkable cowardice and craven pandering which turned an adequate though highly farfetched book like ""Sum of All Fears"" into the inane and excrementally insipid film SUM OF ALL FEARS.

But what if someone could make a decent movie that depicts Christians as good people AND scary as well?

I had not heard about FRAILTY when it was released and was not familiar with the film until it had reached the rental market.
In spite of what seemed like another unflattering and stereotypically caricatured depiction of  religious (and Texan) folk, I was slightly intrigued by the storyline and thought it might make for at least relatively interesting viewing at a time of very few other promising alternatives worth renting.

For those who do not know and are interested, FRAILTY tells the story of a man named Meiks (Matthew McCaugheney) who claims to have knowledge of the ""GOD's Hand killer"", a serial killer from the 70's who was never caught or even identified.  Meiks relays his alleged information to the authorities, in particular to a skeptical FBI Agent (Powers Booth) who regards Meiks as somewhat of an unsettling mystery.  The bulk of the film mainly consists of Meiks's recollection of events past and current, as presented through flashbacks and his testimony.  There is more to the plot, but I really don't want to give too much of the story away for those who want to see the film, because I think very highly of it and believe it should be seen unspoiled.

Though there won't be a unanimous consensus of support for the following opinion, Bill Paxton is a capable and effective actor, though perhaps not the most skilled thespian to ever appear on screen.  Nonetheless, he is invariably believable in his character roles.  Where his even greater talent and skills seem to lie is as a director.  I have seen two of his films (FRAILTY and THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED) that he directed, and enjoyed them both.  The reason I watched THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED was because of how impressed I was with FRAILTY.  And I thought that both were skillfully made and entertaining, although they represent VERY different sensibilities of the psyche.  In addition to finding the right tone and energy and performance level for his actors, Paxton also has a talent for creative and effective visuals, even when just using relatively simple techniques.  This film does not rely on any flashy or high-tech effects, yet still makes for effective scenes.  Without giving too much away, there is a scene in FRAILTY where Bill Paxton's character is driving and sees a barn off in the middle of the countryside.  Though it is a fairly simple setting and premise, it is one of my all-time favorite sequences I have seen in movies, and possibly one of the most effective and compelling.  It's a goosebump-raiser for me, even just thinking about it while I write this.

This film has some critics and detractors, in addition to the usual coterie of obnoxious loudmouths who unnecessarily spew hyperbole and exaggerated pejoratives about films that don't conform to their own narrow screed.  And in all fairness, this film may not be everyone's cup of tea.  There are those who might not like the film for their own valid reasons.  But I think it is a very impressive and engaging film - especially considering the relatively modest budget.  It is a story that is well-written and creative, as well as capably and effectively directed.",1196208000,,4502,5.082880434782608

1740507,5,B00006AUMZ,"Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey) walks into a police station and confesses to Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) that he knows who the God's Hand Killer is - insisting it's his brother Adam, who just recently killed himself.  The movie then fades back to 1979 as Fenton begins telling his story to Agent Doyle.

Adam and Fenton (the boys are expertly played by young Jeremy Sumpter and Matt O'Leary), are being raised by their father Mr. Meiks (Bill Paxton).  Mieks is an everyday mechanic who suddenly receives a vision from God and becomes a religious fanatic.  Meiks saw an angel that revealed his special purpose in a battle with the devil, and told him that God would provide him with three magical weapons.  An axe, some gloves, and a pipe.

With the guidance of God and his magical weapons, Daddy Meiks begins to round up the daemons and execute them, burying them in the rose gardens next to their house.  But Fenton doesn't believe in Dad's visions.  He believes Dad is killing in cold blood.

The movie switches back and forth from Fenton's memories of what happened in 1979 and present day where he is confessing to Agent Doyle.  But not all is as you think it is, and the ending will bring a very satisfactory surprise.  Who, or what, exactly is the daemon here?  'Frailty' earns a solid five stars.

1740520,5,B00006AUMZ,"""Frailty"" was quite critically acclaimed, but it doesn't seem quite as popular among horror fans as it seems like it ought to be.  Some of them will tell you, no doubt, that ""Frailty"" isn't a horror movie and while they're free to have their position, I feel that ""Frailty"" represents everything that horror should be.  Some will tell you that something isn't *really* horror unless it has a lot of traditional scare scenes and whatnot, and while ""Frailty"" isn't scary in the conventional sense it's definitely one of the most unsettling movies of the last decade.  It's short on action, for sure, but the general mood and the bleak ideas found in this movie can match up well against just about anything.

The film opens as Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) arrives at FBI headquarters to find Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey waiting for him in his office.  Meiks has some exciting news:  His brother, Adam, is the God's Hand killer is, who is responsible for a half a dozen or so disappearances and who claims to be acting as, well, God's Hand.  Doyle is understandably skeptical, so Fenton launches into a disturbing tale of his childhood:  When Fenton (Matt O'Leary) is about 10 and his brother Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) a few years younger, their single father (Bill Paxton) has a peculiar vision:  Late at night an angel comes to him and tells him that the final days are at hand, that demons have released on the earth, and that Meiks family has been charged with the duty of fighting them.  These demons, however, aren't beasts or monsters, but look just like ordinary humans.  The young Adam takes these proclamations mildly, but Fenton is far more skeptical, and is, reasonably,  convinced that these demons appear human because that's all that they are.  Fenton wants to run away, but he doesn't really want abandon his father and he absolutely doesn't want to leave trusting Adam behind.  The rest of the film focuses largely on Fenton's struggle to pacify this mad situation, somehow.

""Frailty"" is the quintessential psychological horror film.  Most of the time the protagonists of the film aren't in much physical danger, but the mental trauma that Fenton undergoes is almost beyond belief.  We don't see much of Dad before the vision, but we see enough to know that he's a good man and quite an ideal father.  He's still the same man after the vision, in fact, apart from the fact that he occasionally drives off late at night, and returns home with some stranger bound and gagged and takes them to the shed out back, where the rusty ax waits.  Though we learn the basics of the situation pretty quickly, first-time director and long-time actor Bill Paxton draws out the exposition, slowly building to the first horrific murder and the turmoil that follows in the wake of Dad's spree.  The film proves quite chilling before anything really happens, largely because of the disturbing, calm way that Dad discusses the mad plan, the sheer horror of the whole situation and in the cool, distant visual style of the film.  Horror movies are often garish and overblown, but ""Frailty"" takes the opposite tack, focusing on the dull, hot light of Texas and the yellowish tones that dominate landscape, giving the whole film a sense of reality that is often lacking in other films.  This method makes the few more stylized visuals all the more effective, like in the great scene where Dad realizes that his sacred weapon is found in a lonely  barn which has an unearthly shaft of light pointing down towards it from the sky and through the cracks in the walls.  The murder scenes are uniformly nerve-wracking, even if they aren't graphic. (This film is probably rated R for it's themes and a bit of profanity, not for what you actually see.)  How affecting this movie is is probably based to some degree on how you got along with your parents.  If your father was indifferent or not around perhaps this won't effect as much, but for someone who always was close to their Dad it can be a pretty disturbing concept.  Or, it is for me, anyway.

""Frailty"" has a small cast, and they're all capable.  You always gotta worry about kids in horror movies, but O'Leary and Sumpter both do a fine job.  O'Leary has the much meatier role, and he's very believable and identifiable, and McConaughey is good as the adult Fenton.  He's considered something of a lightweight actor, but he fits into the bleak story nicely, and what can I say, I like the guy.  Paxton is excellent as the father as well, and gives a truly unnerving performance.  On the downside, Boothe's FBI Agent is something of of a clich, but that's okay, he's mostly just a plot device, he doesn't really do much of anything in the story.  He is what he is effectively enough, anyway.

The film is fairly slow-moving, but it really comes to life at the end, where Fenton's struggles against his father become more open and dangerous all while their are some surprising developments in the current timeline.  There are some significant revelations in the final act, and I must admit that I didn't see the big one coming.  Probably lots of people will, but it pretty well blindsided me.  I think it's great, and the film all wraps up quite nicely in the end.  I'm not saying there aren't a few implausibilities and loose ends, but these things are inevitable in this kinda movie, and ""Frailty"" pulls this off a lot better than most.

Hmm, that's it.  ""Frailty"" is just a great, very creepy, very nasty horror movie.  Check it out if you want some mature, serious horror.  Let's hope Paxton and Hanley each get around to making some more horror stuff someday soon.

Grade: A-

SPOILER ALERT:  On a closing note, I think it's hilarious how so many film critics refuse to accept the import of the ending, and pretend that it's ambiguous.  Did these people think that Bruce Willis wasn't really a ghost at the end of The Sixth Sense too?  God.  I guess they were just too enamored with the anti-fanatic commentary that they couldn't accept it when they found out they were watching a horror movie all along, a horror movie with no message whatsoever. (According to writer Hanley, anyway, and I'd say he has the final word on that.)  It's funny to listen to his commentary, he seems baffled and a little angry at the way people refused to accept it for what it is.  But anyway. . .",1170547200,,6335,4.677506775067751
1740521,4,B00006AUMZ,"What a sleeper Frailty apparently was. I suggest this simply because I'd not even heard of it until it was recommended to me by Amazon based on other stuff that I've purchased or reviewed.

And no wonder. Frailty was somewhat controversial as it dealt with religion, kids and serial killers. I can definitely see some objections to the content. The MPAA gave it an R rating, but after viewing I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be a tamer PG-13. It seems to have been slapped with the R more for its controversy than its content.

Frailty is certainly not a Horror movie, which is the label that it seems to have gotten here and there since its 2001 release. It's really a psychological thriller about a father (Bill Paxton) that has an epiphany and believes that God has chosen his family of 3 to be The Hands that hunt down and kill demons that have taken human form. Now that sounds like a Horror movie, but the demons that are hunted aren't traditional Horror movie boogyman/vampire demons. They're people.

The film gives you the perspective that you're seeing a serial killer born and takes you through how the killer, right from the get-go, gets his two young sons involved in his heinous criminal intent.

Has God commissioned a man named Meiks (Paxton) as a Holy Vigilante to track down people that had done bad things or has Meiks simply gone mad? One of Meiks' sons believes the former and the other the latter. But both are forced by their father to help carry out ""justice"".

The story is very well done and also Directed by Paxton. Matthew McConaughey stars and does a great job. But the real star is young (at the time age 14) Matt O'Leary (Brick [2005] & Havoc [2005]). O'Leary plays the brother that thinks his Dad has gone gaga.

Brent Hanley wrote this excellent thriller with his only other credit being a Showtime Masters of Horror, John Landis directed, episode called Family where mom and dad execute vigilante justice. So it seems that Hanley's got a knack for families that bond by killing.

The film moves along at a quick clip. It's suspenseful and has some decent twists. The Powers Booth portrayed FBI agent takes some imagination stretching, but otherwise Frailty is well worth renting.",1168214400,,2221,4.664961636828645

1740525,5,B00006AUMZ,"The Meiks brothers had a troubled childhood. Very troubled. Their mother had died after Adam was born, leaving his older brother Fenton to take care of him with the help of their father. The three males seemed to fend well for themselves, not running into too many bumps in their simple yet strange road in life. It was a fairly close-knit family with plenty of pleasant memories and more to come. But all of that changed one night when Dad (curiously, his name was never revealed in the film, being credited as ""Dad Meiks"") rushed into the boys' room, flipped on the light, woke them up, and began to unravel an unusual tale that would change the very course of their lives in a most dramatic way. Dad had been visited by an angel - an angel sent by God himself. The heavenly apparition told him of his new calling: to be a destroyer of demons. According to the angel, the biblical end times had come and there were demons of Hell now walking among mortal man, disguised as humans. Dad would be given sacred weapons from the angel soon, and thereafter he would receive a list. The list held the names of the demons in disguise - names that appeared to be mere human identities, but, just like the demons themselves, were simply cover-ups for the true evil that lurked in their soul. It was now up to this family of three to become warriors of God. The young Adam obeyed his father and came to believe every bit of it. But Fenton was disturbed by these ideas, insisting to himself that his father had lost his mind and nothing this crazy could be real. Yet surely enough, step by step, it all began becoming a reality. The main slaughtering weapon had been retrieved - an abandoned axe in an old shed, with gloves by its side. They came to find out, that the gloves were for Dad to use when capturing the demons and bringing them back to the house. Because when he would remove the gloves and touch them with his bare hands, he could see their dark sin nature and know for sure who they really were. They weren't humans of course, they were pathetic demons - no match for the wrath of God that was being handed out through this divinely chosen man and his sons. At first Fenton wanted to run away and get help. But as time moved on, trapped within this world of madness and extremism, he began to question his reality as a whole. Could he brake away from this terrible mess he'd been drawn into, or was he destined to become a demon-slayer, just as his father was, and just as his brother would come to be? Years later, as a full-grown adult, he gets a frantic phone call from his brother. Shortly after, he decides to give FBI agent Wesley Doyle a visit and finally relieve himself of these secrets that have plagued him all his life. At first Doyle is confused as to why he would come to him to reveal the mystery behind the ""God's Hand"" serial killer case. Yet once he unveils this deranged tale and the story progresses, they take a trip to the burial site of the victims, where reality warps and warps until it all comes into focus. It turns out that the truth is more twisted than the viewer could have ever imagined.

2001's Frailty is a dark web beautifully spun by it's makers and deserves a look from any and every fan of suspense and horror films. It's a clever, disturbing, thought-provoking piece with plenty of twists and turns that will leave you impressed - if not a bit creeped out! Starring Bill Paxton, Mathew McConaughey, and Powers Booth (among others) you can be assured that the acting really brings out the depth and haunting minds of the characters. And with a great script and crew work, it's no wonder why this is one of the best films in years for fans of the genre. Not to mention several nice extras on the DVD (including deleted scenes, documentaries/featurettes, and commentary by director/actor Bill Paxton). For sure, Frailty is a winner all the way!",1152748800,,3884,4.455056179775281

Bill Paxton really proved he is a great actor and film maker.  The young actors who play his children were flawless in their roles.  I think if my father claimed to be on a mission from god to destroy demons I would have reacted like the older kid did.  The whole religion thing really seems to freak people out so I guess that's why this movie never faired well in theaters.  People are too dang afraid of everything these days.  If they are so faithful then why would a little ol' indy movie shake their faith so much.  Anyway the movie is awsome and thensome.,1152489600,,689,4.328125
1740537,3,B00006AUMZ,"One night, a man appears in FBI headquarters saying that he knows who ""The God's Hand Killer"" is.  After sitting down with the head of that particular department, he tells his story about his father and brother, and the events that surrounded his father's sudden acquirement of Godly duties from an angel.  It is the job of the family to hunt down and destroy demons.

The movie that follows would be a very intense and interesting look into the way one father's insanity affects his young and impressionable children, and the damaging results that follow.  Instead it's actually a reinforcement of the father's own insanity, eventually leading itself to unnecessary and counter-intuitive plot twists that are camp when taken not seriously and preachy when taken seriously.

Overall the general stylings of the film are okay.  The directing, acting, and cinematography are well-enough done, though the acting tends to shudder sometimes towards bad, especially during the end.  None of it really seems to hold itself together by the end, when the film just decides to be stupid.  Even then it had a moment to save itself, but then it went on for exactly five more minutes and ruined itself again, so I for once I can say about a movie, ""It was exactly five minutes too long.""

1740541,4,B00006AUMZ,"Bill Paxton gives cinema the scariest parent since the 1976 Oscar-nominated performance of Piper Laurie in ""Carrie"". And those, my friends, are some very big shoes to fill.

This film is enjoyable on many levels, because it teeters deliciously between stylish American Gothic horror film and Disturbing Dysfunctional Family Psychodrama.

The cast is exceptional, the script is taut, the cinematography is top notch, and the atmosphere is chilling. I am a big fan of creepfests that aren't overpowering, where less is more. Give me a stormy night and a dvd of ""The Others"", or the 1963 version of ""The Haunting"", or ""Don't Look Now"".

And ""Frailty"" is so original and shocking in its concept: Dad tells his two boys, ""God told me that we have to kill some of our neighbors because they're really demons"".  Wow. Heavy stuff.

The ultimate boogey man nightmare is offered here because the parent, whom you love and trust completely, has become homicidal. This is powerful and extremely frightening. It shakes the foundation you stand on.

This film is not a gross-out horror movie. We don't need excess gore or buckets of blood here. It's disturbing enough thematically. The scariest thing about ""Frailty"" is that this could happen in real life, may have happened. It is a horror that is potentially real in your own back yard.

********SPOILER AHEAD*******PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK

My only issue with this movie is a plot hole involving a phone conversation that Matthew McConaughey has with his brother early in the movie where he calls him by name. This should have been left out, for obvious reasons. It ruins the twist at the end. If you've seen the film you know what I mean.

But that is my only problem with ""Frailty"".

Bill Paxton (director and actor) has given us a creepy treat.

Amen.",1141257600,,1793,4.845901639344262
1740542,4,B00006AUMZ,"Prologue

There are two factors that drew me in to this somewhat obscure film.

First, Paxton has played some of the broadest and entertaining characters

in Hollywood. Although he's not your typical main eventer, from the easily

freaked soldier Hudson in Aliens, to the cocky playboy Ray in one of

my favorite films Boxing Helena, Paxton's charm eventually becomes

addictive. So in short, much like a young, virile teenage boy will run to

the latest brawny, Arnold Schwarzenegger flick, I've become a sucker for the

modestly multitalented Bill Paxton. The second reasoning behind my rental of

Frailty is also, strangely enough, Paxton related. In his promotional

appearance for the film on the Tonight Show With Jay Leno  he talked

about the project with such refreshing promise and enthusiasm that after

hearing his plea to see the movie it seemed the only polite thing to do.

Now onto the film itself.

What I Did Like

Frailty's most important quality was that certain something so many

movies today lack: Character Development. Paxton's portrayal of a loving

father was so thoughtful and consistent, till the end you find yourself

emotionally falling deeper into the family's gruesome predicament, almost

wanting to believe the crazed father's tale of ""Heavenly Guidance,"" while at

the same time intellectually assuming he's a cold-bloodied killer. Also,

McConaughey's subtly disturbed character travels from one extreme to

another, without distraction or lack of emotion. I've never been a big fan

of McConaughey, in fact I was about ready to give up on him after The

Wedding Planner, but this film definitely granted him a reprieve.

As for the plot itself, although along the way it might seem a bit sluggish

and bizarre, eventually there is a method to the madness. Between the

intriguing storytelling and some serious ""What In The Bloody Hell?"" moments, you're

left fearful, wondering what could possibly happen next.

What I Didn't Like

What's not to like? I wasn't too fond of McConaughey having a lip full of

chewing tobacco (and he never spit once), but that's probably just me.

Rather disgusting, but not vital. Other than that, depending on your point

of view, the ending will either find you looking back on the entire film

with an unfulfilled void or a renewed curiosity.

Bottom Line

Whether you feel the void or are fully satisfied with the climax of

Frailty, one thing is certain - you won't be able to look at

religious fanatics or backyard sheds the same way again.",1140912000,,2518,5.004842615012106

1740544,5,B00006AUMZ,"""Frailty,"" actor Bill Paxton's feature-film directing debut, is a remarkably structured, thriller; a film with religious and supernatural themes you are not sure whether to believe, but are, nevertheless, utterly convincing throughout.  Without giving too much of the story, all you need to know is that ""Frailty"" tells the story (through flashback) of a father (Paxton) and his two young sons.  They live in small-town Texas, and one night, the father has a vision from an angel, who informs him he and his two sons have been chosen to destroy demons, who are hidden all around them in human form.  The film deals predominantly with the feelings of Fenton, the eldest of the two sons, who is old enough to understand that perhaps his father is going crazy.
  However, throughout the film, there are many hints to suggest the father is not making it all up, and in this, the film is successful at completely engrossing the viewer.
  The film has a terrific - and more importantly, believable and fully explained - climax, and it will leave you with a lasting sense of discomfort.
  Also, the musical score by Brian Tyler (""Six-String Samurai,"" and ""Bubba Ho-tep""), is appropriately gorgeous and haunting.
  The DVD itself has two great featurettes, one of which is a basic 'making-of', the other, a special from the Sundance Channel, the ""Anatomy of a Scene"", where one of the film's most crucial scenes is picked apart from concept, through production.  It is a fascinating documentary, and offers amazing insight in to the making of films in general.
  My only complaint is that the DVD transfer seems to be lacking a bit, visually.  But, it is not enough to destroy the movie, by any means.  This is a must-see for thriller-fans, if you can stomach some of the difficult themes.",1137024000,,1781,4.847682119205298

1740546,5,B00006AUMZ,"I like to read reviews by first re-ordering them starting from the one-star ratings on. These reviewers got me interested. A movie that would shock and disturb so much, so many people? People who loved the movie until the ending twist that made them give only one star and an overall negative review? I had to see this one!

Well, for starters, I was disappointed. This was quite an ordinary serial killer movie, where a highly religious but possibly crazy man goes on a killing spree - with the forced help of his young sons. He justifies it all (for himself and for his sons) with the claim that it is God's will.

Well he dies eventually, never getting caught. But his two sons don't grow up to be really healthy men, you know... The younger one especially grows up pretty crooked and thinks he is continuing his father's work for God.

The older brother never quite believes the stuff, but with enough ""persuation"", and dehydration, even he starts to ""hear"" the voice of God.

Pretty standard stuff if you ever read about real life serial killers, right?

Where this movie exells, is the ending. In a thriller movie, it's all about the ending. And this one is good.

SPOILER ALERT: SPOILER ALERT: Don't read further if you don't want to know too much of the plot.

Right when you thought the father and son were insane, you get hit by a surprise. They really felt they saw what sins their victims had committed. Now here's the kicker: the FBI-agent had never told anyone that he himself murdered his mother. Yet, Adam (the younger son) ""sees"" this and kills him. Guestion is: is he just smart (as is hinted in the in-car conversations) and he just guessed it? Or does he really hear someone talking to him - and if so, is it God or The Devil that is speaking to him?

Now you see why all the bible-lovers shun this movie, the ending is really great.",1132790400,,1853,4.4777448071216615
1740567,4,B00006AUMZ,"It's the people who think that they are right without considering others' feelings or wants that are the most dangerous.  They are the ones who feel that they are on a mission in life, powered by God or some other cosmic force to make the world a better place by eliminating the bad things or bad people.  This was a movie about so called average so-and-sos who are making the world a better place by eliminating bad people all the while justifying thier evil.

Fenton Meeks calls the police one night after the suicide of his brother Adam.  He wants to tell the chief of police that his brother was the infamous God's Hand Killer who had terrorized the area years ago.  He went on to tell the story of their youth, when he and Adam were living with their widowed father in a small town in Texas.  One night, their father wakes them up to tell them that he had received a message from God that they are to cleanse the world of sin.  Suddenly, Fenton and Adam find themselves as accessories to their father's quest to rid the world of sinners and evil.  Fenton is terrified, Adam being the younger and more impressionable, believes their father and is more than willing to aid them.  The movie unfolds with the series of murders they commit as a threesome, and the efforts Fenton makes to break free of their father's mad grip on them.

As an adult, Fenton and Adam are dysfuntional adults without cause or discipline.  Once the police discover Adam's home with all the trophies and tell tale evidence of his past, it seems an open and shut case.  There are two nice twists at the end, however (of which I won't reveil here).

This was a good movie in the sense that the boys were complete pawns and helpless to rebel against their father's madness.  Being an accomplice is one thing, but with a parent being a villan adds a new dimension to it.

I then watched it when I got home and loved it. The movie is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. Bill Paxton and Matthew McConnaughey are great and the twist at the end was great.

The plot of the movie is very good and unique and thought provoking. The movie is about Bil Paxton and his two children, Adam and Fenton. Life is fine for them until Paxton starts seeing visions from God. God tells him that his children and him hve been chosen to kill demons, under human form. From then Paxton receives the weapons he must use, and the list of the people that he must kill. Fenton is shocked and terrified when his father starts bringing demons home and killing them. Adam claims that he also can see that they're demons. Adam and his father are a team. But Fenton knows that he is killing real people. What is so interesting is when Paxton touches the demons with his bare hands. He then sees their sins. Adam sees them also but not Fenton. The movie is thought provoking because you wonder whether or not Paxton is nuts or whether this is true. And when a killer like Paxton reappears, Fenton thinks that he knows who it is and tells the detective assigned the case his story. But, then, you're in for one hell of an awesome plot twist. The movie is excellent and is possibly my favorite movie of all time. Bill Paxton does a great job acting but also does an umbelievable directorial debut.

Great. You'll love this ""small"" but gut-wrenching film.

You have the synopsis from the other posts and the editorial reviews, so you know what it's about.  Here are some additional comments from me:

I disagree with the previous poster who gave this a one-star review because the ending doesn't work. I think the ending works. The director and writer made the film in such a way that they drop many hints (visual and verbal) that make the ending probable and believable. Now, probable and believable are both subjective concepts, aren't they? I mean probable and believable within the scope of the film's reality.  Do people lie? Sure. Do people plot and scheme? Yes. Can people become wild religious fanatics and have visions (false or real)? Indeed. Can deeds be deemed good or evil based on context? Absolutely. If a man sticks a knife in a woman's gut he could be evil (as in murdering a girlfriend who rejects his control in a fit of jealousy) or good (a surgeon removing an ovarian cancer). Context is all. Perception can be skewed.

This film is all about context and perception. What is really being said? What is really being done? And who is good and who is evil?

You'll have to decide that by the time the film ends. You may not like the answer.

I also disagree with the reviewer who said this film is not for Christians. It certainly can be enjoyed by Christians (I'm one, and I'm pretty dang devout! I have been called a ""holy roller"" and ""Bible thumper"" in my day.)  I found this highly involving and emotional. This is a film full of deeds we would be quick to label as moral/immoral, of people we will be hasty to judge, but it is also one that never really denigrates God. If anything, it has something to say about the ""frailty"" of human choices and perceptions, but it is not disrespecting of God.

What is tragic becomes tragedy by film's end. What is sad becomes nearly unbearable. Be ready for a descent into a dark, dark world. And yet, one that rings oddly true, at least for anyone who believes the stories in the Old Testament. Once you ""see"" , you understand. :)

Matt McC and Mr. Paxton were terrific in this, as were the young boy actors. I hope Mr. Paxton gets to direct some more. He did a fine job with this movie that asks and answers the question: ""What makes a good man and loving father become a serial ax murderer?""  It's a great answer!

1740597,5,B00006AUMZ,"In acting the question is: Do you believe?  If you do not believe the actor is who he/she says he/she is, then you don't have a good actor. You absolutely believed Anthony Hopkins was Hannibal Lector because Hopkins is superb in his chosen profession. I had not given Bill Paxton any particular due as an actor and the fault is mine. After seeing Frailty, though, I have come to the conclusion he has been really underrated. In Aliens I did believe in the whiney Marine. In Twister, the hunky weatherman. In Frailty I believed in the good father. In fact, I wished to myself I'd had a father like that about the time someone else in the room voiced the same opinion.

The movie scenario depends on that belief. Paxton plays a single father raising two boys and the portrait he paints of a good, caring dad is absolute. One night he wakes up the boys to tell them his has receieved a vision from God telling him to kill demons in human form.  There we have the crux of the story: Has he truly had a vision or has he suddenly gone mad?  Son Fenton is confused and of the opinion that madness is the answer. Young son Adam believes and swears he shares the visions. Most will think the child is merely saying what he thinks his father wants to hear. When the killing begins Fenton is horrified and desperate to stop it.

It actually begins with an adult Fenton (Matthew McConaughey) showing up to talk with Agent Doyle (Powers Boothe) about some recent serial killings and says it is his brother, Adam, committing them. Through a series of flashbacks he tells Doyle about his childhood, the killings, his own brutal imprisonment, and his father's madness which has been tranferred on to his little brother.

This sleeper of a movie is very, very good. It keeps you wondering about truth and madness throughout. I'm sure it isn't flawless, but darned if I can find any fault in it. The child actors were great and Bill Paxton surprisingly perfect in his ""good father"" role. Even while killing his ""demons"" he still projected that.

Meiks tells about his father, a loving father but religious zealot (Bill Paxton, for whom this film is also his directorial debut) who claims to have been commanded by God to kill ""demons"" living among them. He enlists his two young, impressionable sons to help him in this pursuit. The younger son follows along and believes in everything the father says, while the older son questions his father and attempts even to stymie his apparently delusional plans. The story takes various twists and turns before revealing its true nature and its interesting twist.

This has got to be one of the best films that I have ever seen in this genre. It  is a veritable masterpiece, delivering a great storyline, an amazing directorial debut by Bill Paxton, and excellent performances by the entire cast. What could be better?

The film revolves around the happy and loving Meeks family, which consists of a Texas widower (Bill Paxton) and his two boys, Fenton and Adam. All is well until late one night, when this pleasant, mild-mannered father claims to have received a visitation from an angel with a very special message for him from God. It seems that demons are among us, disguised as human beings. It appears that Dad, as well as his boys, are being given a very special mission. They are to destroy these demons. God will supply the weapons and the names of those who are to be destroyed. Dad will be able to ensure that he is destroying a demon simply by laying his hands upon the purported demon.  Therein lies the tale, and it is a positively chilling one.

This living nightmare is recalled in  flashback by one of the now grown boys (Mathew McConaughey) to FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe), who is investigating a series of killings referred to as the ""God's Hand"" murders. He recounts what life was like for the Meeks family after dear old Dad got his divine calling and woke them up one night from a sound sleep to tell them of his new found mission. The boys are sworn to secrecy and are called upon to assist with this divine calling.  While the younger boy, Adam, gets with the program, the older son, Fenton,  is clearly disturbed by what he sees as the psychotic transformation of his formerly benign father. He is only hoping that things will blow over, and Dad will return to normal. Unfortunately, things will never again be the same.

Bill Paxton's directorial debut may best be described as stunningly self-assured. His direction is deft, yet restrained, as he is obviously someone who knows that less is more. He certainly realizes  that what passes through the viewer's imagination can often be far more terrifying than any garish special effects.  Consequently, this is not a film for those who look for mindless blood splatter and gore, as there is virtually none of that in this film. The camera rightly turns away at the crucial moment, leaving the viewer's imagination to work overtime.

The performances that are exacted from the cast are uniformly terrific, but there are two that merit special note. Bill Paxton is simply astounding, giving a bravura performance that is complex and compelling. The viewer believes all along that he is truly a loving father, even when he is seemingly at his most psychotic and on his divine mission destroying demons. Matt O'Leary also gives a singular performance as young Fenton, the son who has difficulty accepting the tune that his beloved father is now singing.  His is an angst filled performance that will tear at the viewer's heart.

This is truly a terrific tale of gothic horror and one that deserves to become a classic. It boasts an intelligent and clever screenplay by Brent Hanley with enough twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing until the very end. It is a screenplay that has many layers of complexity. The question for the viewer is whether or not Dad was simply a delusional psychotic killer or truly acting upon a divine mission. This may not be as easy to answer as one may think.

If you have seen the trailers for the movie then try to forgot them because the movie is totally different from what the trailers made the movie look like. It is a horror/thriller but more of a thriller than gory or sneak-from-the-behind horror. This movie is about lot of violence but all are off camera and one hardly sees any blood. What makes the movie a masterpiece is how the story comes together at the end. There are several twist at the end, but none of them could be predicted.

1740617,5,B00006AUMZ,"Ahh finally! A movie like Frailty does not come around frequently, believe me when I say that this is one of the best unknown flicks around. Also noteworthy is that this is a big screen directorial debut from Bill Paxton (Twister, Apollo 13, A Simple Plan) who really impressed me on various levels, I always enjoyed seeing him on the big screen as an actor but now that I know what he is capable of, I am sure that I will enjoy him in whatever future project he might be attached to.

This movie gives you one of those *old-school* horror/thriller moody feelings. It is set in present day but it is told through flashbacks of the late 1970s. We are introduced to the Meiks family, Dad Meiks is a typical Texan who takes care of his two boys, Adam & Fenton, all by himself. They do not seem like a regular religious family until one day Dad Meiks wakes up and tells his sons that an Angel appeared in his dream and told him to serve God by killing Demons disguised as humans. One of the sons, Adam thinks this is very cool and sees his father as a superhero, but Fenton thinks that his father has lost his mind and that this whole idea is absurd. He is against it from the get go but this does not stop his dad from doing what he must do, kill those who are demons. So, with a single touch, Dad Meiks can tell what that person has done and after that, yep, he kills them. So needless to say, young Fenton freaks out and tries to go up against his father but that does not go all too well, without giving anything else away, I suggest that you rent this movie and watch it carefully because you are in for a really good treat.

The movie's been thoughtfully reviewed by many folks here, and there's not much more I can add. But some of these overly negative reviews...I dunno, I do respect their opinions and all, but it seemed like more than a few of 'em took this film a little too personally. Some even concluded that the message said Christians get a ""free pass"" on Earth. I don't know why they'd think that. I mean, I've talked about Frailty with friends of various religious beliefs/opinions, Christians included, and not one of 'em would ever want to walk in ""Dad"" Meiks' shoes, even with the assurance of earning a ""free pass"". But I gotta admit...some reviews, while I might've disagreed with 'em, were nonetheless pretty thought-provoking & brought another perspective to the table. But that happens to be one reason I liked Frailty so much...it definitely stirs up the passion in people, regardless of whether they liked it or not. The thin-skinned might want to avoid this movie, but I highly recommend it to anyone else...a second viewing (or third, for that matter) is essential as well.",1105488000,,1235,4.85781990521327
1740619,5,B00006AUMZ,"What a punch this movie packs.  Frailty unfolds like a beautiful origami of horror as the movie moves seamlessly between past and present and in one moment of true cinema magic - simultaneously.  Bill Paxton directs himself in his greatest role, a widower raising two young sons alone who receives a message from God that it is up to him and his boys to seek and destroy the demons on earth posing as humans.  In the present we have Matthew McConaughey as one of the sons - now grown - ""assisting"" FBI Agent Powers Booth in uncovering the infamous ""Hand of God"" murders.

Where ""Frailty"" differs from other religious fanatical type horror stories is that - for once there is a believability factor . . . as an audience member I was incredibly uncomfortable having to make  the decision of whether or not this was real.  Paxton's performance is raw in its honesty and total in commitment of the young father.  He is so loving and caring a parent that when he takes up the burden of killing it is disturbingly real.

Paxton also proves to be a great storyteller and his work with the two boys that play his sons pays off in spades.

The film takes sometime to unfold at the start (as the plot requires), but your patience will be rewarded ten-fold in the end.  Bill Paxton's switch from ""Dad of the Year"" to crazed serial killer had me hiding my dad's axe.  Sometimes child stars can detract from the weight of a horror flick, but the two young actors in this flick are perfect.  The transition from Paxton's young children to their adult counterparts was natural and seamless.  I love the film's ""Usual Suspects"" type ending, the M. Knight Shyamalan tumbling down the stairs plot reveal.  I felt in need of company when this film was over and when the credits were rolling, there was the longest eery silence I've ever heard.  I see big things in Paxton's Directorial career, though I love his acting as well (""A Simple Plan"" was simply amazing).  I highly recommend renting/buying this DVD. This movie needs and deserves to find the cult-like audience it should have found in the theaters.  What are you waiting for?.",1102723200,,1054,4.811111111111111
1740621,5,B00006AUMZ,"Frailty revolves around a serial killer called the ""God's Hands Killer"" and a man named Fenton Meeks ( Matthew McCoughaney) that claims to know the true identity of the killer. Fenton walks into the office of FBI agent Wesley Doyle ( Powers Boothe)and tells a story that he claims will shed some light on the case. The story goes back to Fenton's childhood, and revolves around him (Matt O Leary)and his younger brother Adam ( Jeremy Sumpter) raised by their father( Bill Paxton). One night, their father says he is visited by an angel that was sent from God. The angel says God has a mission for him. The mission is for him and his two sons to kill demons disguised as humans. Adam, loves his dad, and is eager to assist him. Fenton however, refuses to participate and sees it as murder. Throughout the whole film, the viewer must ask themselves - Is the father really doing God's work, or he is out of his mind?

Frailty is probably one of the best films that I have ever seen. If I had to make a list of my ten favorite films of all time, Frailty would definately be on it. The film's story unfolds briliantly because the focus keeps switching from the present conversation between Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe, back to the boys' childhood with their father. It is all tied together wonderfully, and culminates in one of the best endings I have ever seen. It will literally shock you. The film overall is an intelligent horror film that offers a whole new take on a serial killer. It is not your everday pointless Hollywood slasher film. It uses the characters' emotions and what they went through, to drive the story. I also love the controversial take on religion that the story offers. Bill Paxton did an amazing job in his directorial debut! The two young actors Adam ( Jeremy Sumpter) and Fenton ( Matthew O' Leary) were the main reason for the film's success. Paxton successfully manages to make them give the most convincing performance possible. Their performances make what the boys went through very convincing. Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe were also great.

Frailty was flawless in my eyes. The story unfolds very well, the ending was outstanding, and the performances were all great. The DVD offers an outstanding featurette that takes you into the making of the film. It was very interesting to see the process that went into making the film.

1740622,5,B00006AUMZ,"Faith, like sex and sacrifice, is one of the most mysterious aspects of human existence; what is it that would spur a man to give his own life for that which cannot be glimpsed with the eyes, or proved by the senses? With that in mind, ""Frailty"", Bill Paxton's fine little nugget of terror in the American Heartland is a fine film that marks the actor's promising directorial debut, and a desperate, dark journey into the depths of religious hysteria and the implosion of what seems a picture-perfect American family.

The movie is awe-inspiring, stunning, mystifying; it is so good that I'm not going to spoil any of its twists and turns, other than to say that Paxton's movie (with spare and well-paced writing by Brent Hanley) is a taut, nasty little homage to Alfred Hitchcock.

The plot, very quickly (and spoiler free): the FBI have been hunting for the ""God's Hand Killer"", a West Texas axe murderer who has been terrorizing the region for two decades. The film, presented as what Hitchcock would have called a 'frame story', begins with Matthew McConaughey confessing to the startled Dallas FBI Agent Wesley Doyle, played succinctly by Powers Boothe. McConaughey, who plays Fenton Meiks, contends that his brother, Adam, is the killer the FBI is looking for.

The movie then flashes back to Thurman, Texas in 1979, where Fenton and Adam (played remarkably by two awfully poised and very natural young actors, Matthew O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter)are growing up with their father (Bill Paxton), an affable auto mechanic and a good father, who wakes his sons in the middle of the night to tell them that he's had a vision from the Angel of the Lord. Paxton, whose acting is solid and discomfiting, announces to his startled boys that the End of Times is at hand, and the family has a new duty: to cast out demons masquerading as people.

Paxton's new religious fervor don't come from the peaceful New Testament side of Christianity, either: new 'visions' follow in rapid succession, and Paxton brings home some grisly new tools the family of ""Holy Superheroes"" will need to carry out their new mission against the forces of Evil, including an axe named Otis. As might be expected, bloodshed and horror (though not gory horror; this is not meant to be a splatter film, and the camera averts its eye during the more horrific sequences).

What follows in the next hour and a half is an taut and astonishing suspense thriller in which the audience naturally empathizes with the plight of young Fenton Meeks: what do you do when you're 10 years old and your beloved father (and only parent) goes stark raving mad? Even better is the growing rift between older brother Fenton and the rest of the family; as Paxton's character drifts further into religious madness and blood frenzy, youngest son Adam embarks with him into credulity and a kind of idol-worship.

The cinematography (by Bill Butler, who worked on both ""Jaws"" and ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"") is stark and haunting; Paxton uses the sere, flat, barren California landscape to telling effect, and the sequence in which Paxton finds 'Otis' is haunting and eerie. The acting here is also solid; Paxton portrays his religious zealot with an unnerving practicality and steadiness, McConaughey turns into a fine performance in which he gets to use his native Texas accent, and the two child actors lend strength and vitality to a film that would have been lost without good child leads. It's also nice to see Powers Boothe back in a film, and he does a nice job with the meaty role he's been given.

Be warned: ""Frailty"" is not a piece of horror-movie fluff, and it is not for those who are easily disturbed. Its horrors are as familiar as a family reunion, and its terrors linger long in the mind's eye. There are rewards for those who follow this unsettling little film to its end, but be warned: the price of looking is having to watch.",1099785600,,3899,4.767407407407408

1740624,4,B00006AUMZ,"Depending on your definition of insanity is how you'll watch this film.  As for me, I was screaming out ""THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY!""

This gloomy horror begins with a meeting, between FBI agent Wesley Doyle, and Adam who is pretending to be Fenton his older brother (Matthew McConaughey), who claims to have information about the identity of the God's Hand killer, the case Doyle presides over.

Fenton jumps back in time to his childhood, revealing the relationship between himself, his younger brother Adam, and their father.  They're a normal family who get along and seem to be doing well even without a mother figure.  One night, things change. The father wakes his son's in the middle of the night to tell them of a vision from an angel.  This angel spoke to him about his role as God's servant in destroying demons that walk the earth in human form. He claims that when he places his hands on the person, it will reveal them for who they really are. He says he will be receiving weapons and a list of those to be destroyed.

Okay so this is one hell of a nightmare right?  So Fenton thinks!

Adam, willingly accepts his father's role (he thinks his dad is a superhero). Fenton, is like this is 100% WRONG!  This is MURDER!  OR IS IT?

The two story lines, past and present, weave into one another gracefully without missing a beat.  McConaughey's character is questionable, and filled with so much mystery.  But what about our F.B.I agent Doyle?  Now that's a hell of a twist!

1740636,4,B00006AUMZ,"Good grief to all of you 'This is an unethical movie' crybabies.
First of all, this is a complex, challenging film that has many layered messages. Even the messages it presents are not exactly definable nor are they without debate and this is the sign of a strong work of art.
Next up;
MESSAGE TO ALL OF YOU SO CALLED 'OFFENDED' CHRISTIANS.
Let's be frank.
I am sick of listening to uptight Christians screaming bloody murder over everything that doesn't fit into their very small box of ideas.
CHRISTIANITY IS THE SILLIEST OF ALL RELIGIONS and I for one am glad to see a film with enough guts to call a spade a spade.
If Jesus Christ even existed, his followers certainly don't follow his lead. This man preached 'Do Unto Others' 'Turn the other cheek' and 'The Meek Shall inherit the Earth'.
Hardly the precepts of Christianity.
Christians have, throughout history, bullied, persecuted, and BUTCHERED more people than ALL other faiths combined (including Islam).
It's treatment of women remains despicable even today.
And then we have all of the so called Bible's errors.
From Genesis to Revelations the Bible is loaded with so many contradictions that anyone with more than a single digit IQ cannot take it seriousely.
From the hypocricy of Thanksgivng (sure the Indians welcomed us with turkey and then within 2 years we started slaughtering them for refusing to convert to our beliefs) to the Quite clear religious right administration we now have, Christians have long stuck their god forsaken noses in everybody's business and have insisted on all following their so called codes of morality.
Hell, even in old Hollywood the Legion Of Decency was dictating  to the studios on how to make film!
Today everytime a movie comes along which shakes up the BS of the Christian faith all you whiney Christians start yelping about the loss of ethics and how your faith is being persecuted. HELLO. Chrisitanity has been in power since Constantine.
But then, most Christians aren't even aware of that.
As a matter of fact most Christians don't even know their own book of beliefs.
Which proves one thing:
For the most part christianity is for the stupid masses and even little incidental reviews like for a small little known film gets the Christians all bent out of shape.
doesn't take much to shake them does it?
PS.
NOTE TO WRATHFUL BUDDAH.
first of all, I didn't read your review at all. And I wasn't referring to ANY particular reviewer, not even the one with heading 'most unethical film ever', but i was referring instead to some other reviwers context.
secondly, while I appreciate your review and think it well written I cannot agree totally with you on one major difference.
I happened to have read Paxton's own take on this (his) film. Now while I admit that a lot of films are so complex that many many interpetations can be forthcoming (Kubrick's films are like that) I think I will take the director's view as being one the one with the most authority.
and Paxton; a professed Non-Believer (!) said the film was not about God, but about obsession and he pointed out that ALL of the ax murders take place off screen, indicating that the Father and BOTH sons are religiousely demented. ALL are hallucinating and it's possible that the murders actually never even took place.
I can see why some might take this as right wing but from the words of Paxton, who comes across as very liberal, none of the charcters are sympathetic and the point of the film is that religious zeal becomes so blinding that all that remains in the aftermath is total confusion. And the world's no better off with religion. which I think is apt. The test of a true religion is this:
Has it made the world better and has it given us structure, order, truth?
The answer is an absolute NO. It's done just the opposite of all of that and these point are the drive of Paxton's film.
Several (unnamed) reviewers were spouting off regarding the film's Anti-Christian message. And they're right. The film is definitely Anti-Chrisitanity and that comes straight from the horse's mouth.
One might also check out the movie called 'RAPTURE' with the vastly underrated Mimi Rogers. It has very similar sentiments.",1091836800,,4183,4.769655172413793
1740637,4,B00006AUMZ,"Frailty is a movie that I only heard a little bit about when it first came out, all positive stuff, but it quickly dissappeared from theatres before I could get around to seeing it. I caught it on the movie channel one night and was captivated by it right away. Matthew McConaughey stars as a guy who goes to the FBI to report on his brother, who is a serial killer running rampant, but McConaughey wants to explain what brought about this manifestation of evil in his brother. The story is told in flashback, where Bill Paxson plays the father of two boys who has a 'vision from God' one day and becomes one of his Archangel defenders on Earth. So, he goes about killing people he believes are demons. One of the boys isn't convinced however, while the other claims that he can see the demons just like his father. The film chronicles the family's descent into madness and fanaticism. What makes the film really clever and well put together is the final 20 minutes, which comes out of left field and leaves us with a very un-Hollywood ending. I don't agree with the final 'message' of the film, but it made it that much scarier in the end. Matthew McConaughey was quite good in this flick, actually he's always pretty good in offbeat little films...it's when he's doing Hollywood-leading man type stuff where he comes across as cocky and arrogant, rather than laid-back and charming. Bill Paxson has always been great as these down-home Southern characters and his portrayal is great at exposing the dualities of man...from loving, doting father to merciless 'Angel' of vengeance. And Powers Boothe really should be a bigger star. He's always been supremely underrated and is a master at conveying authoriatarian menace. A lot of people are claiming this film to be a tool of the Religious Right, but I don't buy that at all. There's all this talk of conspiracy, like the Moral Majority somehow is duping us into watching what we 'think' is a conventional thriller but is really their 'wicked propaganda' in disguise. Ooooooo....scary! Now, I'm not a religious guy at all, but I took the ending for what it is, open-ended and ripe for many interpretations...usually a sign of a great film, no? Hell, I'm sure a lot of religious people will get upset with this movie and say that it's left-wing propaganda because it portrays Christians as axe-wielding fanatics, no? Man, someone even went so far as to claim this is a pro-death penalty movie and how its no coincidence that all three of the male leads are from Texas. Ridiculous! I didn't get the impression that the film was pro death penalty at all. It's unfortunate that when a movie presents an idea that you may be uncomfortable with, so many people cry out against its message and declare it 'propaganda' for the OTHER side, and the Left and the Right as equally as guilty in this regard. This was a great tale of Southern Gothic horror, and let's not forget that there's an element of 'fantasy' here that asks you to suspend your disbelief. For me, the ending is at the same level of sophistication as the 'What If?' comics that Marvel put out in the 70s. And that is NOT a put-down of the film, but let's remember one thing, it's a HORROR film for God's sakes! I certainly didn't view it for lessons in personal morality. I thought it great that someone could look at the ending anyway they want to. It demands that you use your own intelligence, that you make up your own mind. What amazes me is that some of the lefties reviewing the film out there, people from whom I expect a MODICUM of intelligence, totally misinterpret the movie and overpoliticize it. The so-called 'demons' in the flick aren't athiests you dummies! All of them committed heinous crimes, which I think we'd all agree weren't 'good' things, no matter what your political leanings are. As well, how can you say the ending wasn't effective, when that SAME ending is what prompted you to take keyboard in hand to decry the film? Or the guy calling it unethical? Because the person he wants punished isn't? And I don't see where the film was a rip-off of the Dead Zone, nor how that film had a GOOD message and this one had a BAD one. Ha ha, you guys are a pathetic joke. Sooooo predictable, sooooo lame. I love how one guy said that he wishes that these fanatical ""actors-turned-directors"" would keep their intolerant right wing politics to themselves. Of course, I suppose left-wing fanatics like Michael Moore should be allowed to continue to foist their heavy-handed, inaccurate rants upon the world, no? Give me a break.

1740638,1,B00006AUMZ,"After reading my earlier review, my wife informed me that in the scene when Daddy Meiks (Bill Paxton) lays hands on the blond female ""demon,"" there actually was a flashback shown (I must have been dozing off during that scene), in which she is lying in bed with a man wearing a dog collar. I'm glad she pointed this out to me because this makes the scene even more lame. Either we are being told that she is a ""demon"" because she engages in ""kinky sex"" (typical example of ""conservatives"" trying to tell people what ""god says"" they can and can't do in the privacy of their own bedrooms), or that she is a prostitute who ""specializes"" in kinky sex, or perhaps both. In any case, hardly cause for ""demonization.""

 Also, in the interest of accuracy, besides the two women mentioned in my earlier review, there were four other females who briefly appeared, or who were alluded to: 1) the little girl who was the victim of one of the ""demons""; 2) the woman inside the house to whom another ""demon"" yells, ""shut up, bitch!""; 3) Mama Meiks, who had died during childbirth, so that she could be conveniently absent, along with any other shred of family that the Meiks boys had; 4) The FBI agent's mother whose picture sat lovingly on his desk, and who it is later revealed he had ""whacked"" several years earlier. Again, ""stellar""--i.e. typical old fashioned, conservative--portrayal of females, as either helpless victims, ""temptresses,"" or merely vessels for carrying babies...while the ""men folk"" do ""god's bidding.""

 In any case, again, this film's a bunch of ""hooey,"" imo, and not anywhere near as benign as about 80% of the reviewers here--and elsewhere--seem to think. We are all entitled to our opinions, but let's not be naive enough to pretend that all films are just ""pure entertainment,"" completely devoid of any other agenda, ""moral,"" or message. Btw, to the reviewer who repeatedly referenced ""catholics:"" I think we ""conspiracy theorists"" are referring more to ""evangelical/fundamentalist christians,"" i.e. the American ""religious right"" more than catholics, being ""behind"" the making of this movie.

 There is nothing wrong with this movie, it's not promoting killing all non-catholics. Nobody is going to watch this movie and be convinced that they should go out killing any ""demons.""(but then with the thought-pattern of some of the people who reviewed this film, im not completely sure..)

 The main character in Frailty is obviously not right in the head.. thats probably why they have Fenton there to even out the father.

1740640,1,B00006AUMZ,"nothing more than conservative propaganda; a pro-death penalty movie ""in sheep's clothing;"" and a millennial, new testament ""end times"" movie. If you dispute my opening sentence, consider the following...

1) The murderer goes completely unpunished by the end of the film. As a review I read elsewhere aptly put it, the director didn't take ""the stinger"" out.

2) The fact that the director didn't remove ""the stinger"" strongly suggests that the film was intended to have the following disturbing and controversial ""morals:"" a) That only a chosen few christians have the ability to ""see"" ""true"" EEEEVILL; b) those who don't believe in the ""christian god"" are ""demons,"" so it's okay to torture and ""off"" them, even if they happen to be one's own sons or brothers.

3) The film takes place in ""pro death"" Texas. I couldn't help but think that, in this respect, it was the antithesis of the equally crummy and self-righteous, but politically opposed, The Life of David Gale. Btw, it's probably no coincidence that actors Paxton, Booth, and McConaughey are all from Texas.

4) Many other reviewers (here and elsewhere) seem inexplicably puzzled by the title of the movie. It seems fairly obvious to me that ""Frailty"" refers to the character Fenton Meiks, who is too morally ""frail,"" i.e. weak/""meek"" to see the ""demons"" and carry out ""god's will."" The family's surname probably has another connotation as well, i.e. the biblical proclamation that ""the meek shall inherit the earth,"" but obviously that connotation would refer more to Fenton's more ""righteous"" father and brother. As an aside, the youngest son is biblically named Adam.

5) I'll throw another one in for good measure. This movie doesn't present the most flattering view of women. There are only two women in the movie: one is depicted as one of the ""demons"" who ""gets the axe""--presumably viewers are being led to believe that she is of ""questionable repute,"" although we do not get the same glimpse of her past that we do of the other victims, when Paxton ""lays hands"" on her; the only other female is the pregnant dispatcher who is depicted  as little more than a vehicle for covering for the ""righteously"" murderous Adam, and as vessel for carrying his ""spawn,"" i.e. bearing the next generation of ""demon slayers"" (oh brother).

Small wonder the cast was kept so small in this curiously acclaimed ""low budget thriller:"" I don't think there are too many adult actors, other than the ""choir"" of like-minded zealots who participated in this movie, who would've wanted a part after reading the script. This in nothing more than a ""doomsday flick,"" made by some of the fanatics who believe that the end of the second millennium A.D. (or C.E.) signals the biblical end of the world; just as ""doomsday cults"" of superstitious people thought the same thing at the end of the first millennium. Don't let this silly movie get too far inside of your head, folks.

8/8/04 Addendum: Thanks to CATTY (and others here) for helping to illustrate my point...ironically, by NOT really paying attention to what I--or the first reviewer who called this film ""unethical""--was REALLY saying. What is it about our species that our attention spans seem to be DEvolving? Could it be that the same poor attention span that made you miss my point, also made you miss this movie's REAL message? Hmmm.

I can't understand why it's not obvious that my reviews were anti-Christian--or at least anti-fundamentalism--and I am about as diametrically the opposite of a ""religious fanatic"" as anyone can be. Know EXACTLY what you're railing against before you ""go off,"" folks.

8/9/04: Hi Catty, I greatly respect you for ""getting back to me."" Your point is very well taken; and, yes, I have heard/read about Paxton's comments that you referenced--all though I have not been able to find the actual interview. I guess what it comes down to is that, either I'm not convinced...or, as my wife and I discussed right after we watched the movie: even if the message of the movie was not we thought; at best, it is irresponsible filmmaking/directing to not know how your movie could come across...esp. given how many religious fanatic nuts there are in this country. In the final analysis, we didn't like the movie even before we BOTH thought we ""deciphered"" its thinly veiled message. It wasn't until the scene with the videotape ""glitch"" toward the end of the movie, when we looked at each other and I said, ""Is this movie saying what I think it is?"" It seems that the implication was clear that some sort of ""divine intervention"" had caused the tape to go haywire just in the right place. From that point on the movie seemed to convey exactly the message we had suspected...and the ending seemed to us to clinch it, in a pretty unambiguous manner. If we are wrong, so be it, but I personally wish that filmmakers would be a little more aware about what kind of messages their films can take on, simply with a couple of directing decisions.

You and I seem to be in agreement that religious fanaticism, in all of its forms, is one of the biggest threats facing the world today...so I try to point out anything that strongly seems to me to be fueling its fires, whether it's done so intentionally or not. That's where I'm at. Namaste.",1090195200,,5258,4.824639289678135

It's about the creepiest movie I've ever seen in my life. I get scared just thinking about it. Not because of blood and gore. That doesn't bother me. It's about the mental state the movie puts you in because in a way you are one of those two sons and whichever one you side with it's either redemption or hellfire.,1085356800,,469,4.222222222222222
1740642,5,B00006AUMZ,"""Frailty,"" Bill Paxton's directorial debut, is a swift, tightly focused and darkly compelling thriller that leaves us with a lot of fascinating, disturbing questions at the end. Screenwriter Brent Hanley's story begins simply: Dad Meeks (Paxton) is a friendly, uncomplicated blue-collar guy in small-town Texas who adores his two small sons, Fenton (Matt O'Leary) and Adam (Jeremy Sumpter), whom he raises alone after the death of his wife. Everything goes smoothly until one night when Dad tells his sons that he's been visited by an angel of the Lord, who has told him the world is about to end. To further the Lord's mission, Dad must become an avenging angel himself, slaughtering demons in human form with the help of his sons. Fenton and Adam have very different reactions to their father's revelations, and it's absolutely no fair to reveal anything else about the plot, except that it uses the framing device of one of Dad's now-grown sons (Matthew McConaughey) relating the tale of slaughter to an FBI agent (Powers Boothe). The story can best be described as Hitchcockian, with liberal dollops of ""The Usual Suspects"" and the ""Left Behind"" novels; intellectual snobs may even detect a whiff of Borges. Paxton gives the film's best scenes a Hitchcockian clarity and breathlessness. The actors are also very, very good, particularly Paxton and young O'Leary, a real find. The DVD extras--including deleted scenes, a making-of-the-movie documentary and an analysis of one of the movie's key scenes that ran originally on the Sundance Channel--are fascinating and testify to the astuteness of Paxton's choices in this movie. Here's hoping his first film isn't his last!",1084579200,,1675,5.18450184501845
1740643,5,B00006AUMZ,"On a quite day in 1979, Bill Paxton (Dad) has a vision that changes his life and the life of his sons, forever. As a single parent mechanic living in rural Texas he now has a new mission - his family are really superheros, chosen by God to do his will, go by the name of ""God's Hands"", and Dad must kill demons with his children, Fenton and Adam... but Fenton does not believe... and we are not so sure either.
The theme of Frailty is moral weakness as Fenton, the older of the two children, is having trouble coming to terms with the fact that his father has probably gone insane. Adam, however, trusts everything and when his father uses three magic weapons (given to him by God) to `destroy' the evil, he sees the demons too, but Fenton has no faith and can not see the demons. Also Dad has learned some secrets about Fenton that he hopes to prove wrong. Fenton challenges his father's beliefs, but Dad is having none of that because the mission is to relentlessly destroy demons (who look human) on a list given to them by an angel and to bury the decimated bodies in a rose garden behind their home. It is a destiny that Fenton must recognize before it is too late... but Fenton is frail and he wants to expose his father's sickness to the local town's sheriff.
Frailty is told in flashback style as Matthew McConaughey turns up at the FBI, over 30 years since the killings began, to tell Agent Doyle (Powers Boothe) that he knows who the ""God's Hands"" serial killer is, but in order for Doyle to understand more he must listen to the story of ""Dad"" and why he believes that his brother is the ""God Hands"" killer. Are you a little confused? You will be until the final credits role but by then you will have connected everything and the twists are good and many.
Frailty is a brilliant movie. In fact it has been a long time coming but Bill Paxton not only has his best role to date, but shines as an actor turned director in the same vein as Clint Eastwood or Sean Penn. The story is near perfection and the acting is on flying form. Frailty will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. It will mess with your mind and turn your world upside down. Seeing Dad slaughter a woman in front of his children will transmit a shrill up your spine every time. You don't know what is going on and your doubts will be many... but maybe your doubts are correct and like Fenton you have been tricked by Dad...
Frailty requires repeat viewing to absorb the material entirety. You MUST listen and watch absolutely everything that is going on. Pay attention especially to the names of people. It is an extremely detailed film with much more going on inside than what the story presents us with (and it presents us with a lot and gets even deeper in the final minutes). If the film has any flaw it is only in not revealing enough about the latest work of the ""God's Hands"" serial killer but the motives are there and if you watch the film carefully then you will realize that it is near perfect and any holes in the plot are in fact your own confusions. Repeat viewing is a must if you do not get everything. It is all there though.
The bottom line is that Paxton was essentially an 80s actor of mostly horror and sci-fi movies. Here he takes the same 80s horror themes, along with a great story, some fine casting, solid acting and creates a psychological horror of the kind we have not seen in over a decade. If you are a fan of 80s horror, like intelligent psychological horror or feel that the 21st century has delivered on some really dismal horror movies, then Frailty will restore your faith in the system. I am a fan of this genre and I have not seen a good film like this in a long time. I can safely say that DVD ownership is an absolute must have and I will be watching this one for many years to come... and I am sure you will too....

Remove this aspect by let's say a tree talking to him then I would have believed it more.

1740645,5,B00006AUMZ,"This film is a great respite from the usual characature of the insane axe-wielding human (in this case The God's Hand Serial Killer)and takes us through a more spiritual journey.
After being visited by an angel and given three special weapons by God, himself - Bill Paxton and his two sons are drafted in God's Army.  Bill has been given a list of ""demons"" by an angel and instructed to destroy them, with explicit details on how to accomplish the destroying and burying of the corpses.  A waitress, a young man, and an elderly gentleman are just a couple of the demons on the list.
One by one, Bill lays his bare hands on the demons/people before chopping them up with an axe named Otis, and he can ""SEE"" what evil they have done. Or so he says...
This film has lots of surprises, twists and turns, a ton of biblical prophesying along with the psychological/brainwashing aspects of the story.  PLUS - Of course a GREAT ENDING!

This is one of those films that did not get a wide Theatrical release that may have slipped through the cracks. It is the story of a father and his two sons, and the fathers revelation that God has tapped them to kill demons that walk among us, to be God's hand.  While one son assumes that his father has gone crazy, the other believes in him without question.  After the kids have grown up, one of them decides to follow in their fathers footsteps and kill demons (who look like normal people) while the other eventually decides to turn in his brother for being the God's hand killer.  The movie is told in a narrative by Fenton Meiks (Matt McConaughey) as he is convincing an FBI agent that his brother is the murderer. This is a well written, suspenseful film that tears at you, and is wonderfully crafted.
About the DVD:  This one is chock full of extras, including the trailer, the making of, scenes, a documentary from the Sundance channel, and three different commentaries. An absolute goldmine of information.  Even without these features, the film would still rate a five.

1740657,4,B00006AUMZ,"I'd never heard of 'Frailty' before I rented this DVD, and, wary as I am of renting movies I've never come across before (see my review of 'Fear of the Dark' for proof of that!!) I was hugely surprised and very impressed with this excellent 2002 offering starring the excellent Matthew McConaughey.
The quiet family life of young brothers Fenton and Adam Mieks is turned upside down when their recently-widowed Father loses his mind, and begins to kidnap and execute what he believes are 'Demons', after an audience with an Angel. Cut to some years later, and the adult Fenton is recounting the tale to a police officer investigating the 'God's hand killer', whom Fenton believes to be his brother Adam.
Pretty much a vehicle for Matthew McConaughey, 'Frailty' also contains some excellent performances from child actors Matthew O'Leary as the Young Fenton and Jeremy Sumpter as the young Adam.  For child actors they display a feeling for their roles far beyond their years, and it's their opposite reactions to their Father's insanity and misdeeds that give this excellent picture much of its credibility. Bill Paxton as Dad mieks is decent enough (he also directed the movie) but we can;t help feel that he doesn't give enough depth to the character of the psychopath.
Direction, though, is first-rate, and shooting most of the movie at night creates an excellent contrast between the darkness of the murder-scenes and the garish bright of the daytime sequences. The actual murder scenes themselves are neither gory nor unnessecarily violent, and are all the more tense and enthralling because of it. Paxton seems to be a far superior director than he is actor, and he does an excellent job with this picture.
There's a great twist in the tale, and while we are expecting a twist, it's not the one we were thinking of.
All in all, 'Frailty' is an excellent, tense horror-cum-suspense movie, with some excellent performances and top-drawer direction. Recommended.",1076198400,,1965,5.009174311926605
1740658,4,B00006AUMZ,"Frailty, suspense movies have been waiting a long time for a movie like this to come aroung. Now many people think that this movie is a horror movie. Well your wrong, it is a suspense (I would barely consider this a thriller) This movie is very easy to follow and yet it's still clever. One pro about this movie is that it throws you off. It messes with your mind and it also drives the fear into you of if you are or if you aren't a demon... I know what your thinking ""Demon what? This movie is going to suck!"" Well let me explain to you what it's about.
When Fenton (Matthew McConaughey) comes to the FBI claiming that he knows about the god's hand killer. God's Hand Killer? Yes, God's Hand Killer. God gets the sense that there is demons on earth. So he sends an angel to talk to Fentons father and asks him, Fenton and Adam (Fentons little brother) to slay demons. A demon slayer if you will, well the father accepts being a religous man. So he tells his sons about it, Adams believes but Fenton thinks that his father has lost his mind. The demons are real people. So Fenton tries to tell the police, run away, and as his last resort he tells his father that he has seen the demons. So he is about to slay a demon when he turns and gives his father a heavy blow in the torso, but wait Adam is now the heir demon killer, so will he step up to the demon killing position.
Back in the FBI office Fenton tells the chief, that he can show him where the bodies are buried. So they take a ride back to the graveyard where they buried the demon corpses. Then Fenton reveals something, an important little detail...
This movie is very suspenseful, not scary and not that gorey. I feel that anyone that is up to it can watch it. Like a sprinkle of language, they drop the F-Bomb twice and it isn't that bad. So watch this movie and have fun...",1074556800,,1839,4.183098591549296

1740661,4,B00006AUMZ,"This is the sort of story that comes along once in a while that makes me look at my neighbors with curious suspicion.  What dark secrets could they be hiding?  Bill Paxton plays the widowed father of two boys, portrayed handsomely by Matt O'leary and Jeremy Sumpter.  One night he comes into their bedroom to tell them an angel has visited him and that it is God's will that they destroy the demons inhabiting our world; but those demons look and act just like normal people.  Thus the creepiness of this unfortunately realistic yarn unfolds amid great mood lighting, solid acting, and surprisingly excellent direction from none other than Bill Paxton.  This is an auspicious debut for him and I for one hope he continues to be this inspired with any future attempts.  The suspense and tension are so eerie at times that the scene brings about bona-fide chills.  Matthew McConaughey, not a usual favorite actor of mine, is actually quite good in his scenes with Powers Booth, an actor who draws your attention with each calculated phrase.  The plot twist at the end is both good and bad.  It is good because it made me want to see the film all over again and try to catch what I know I missed; but it's bad because during the entire film I was seeing the movie from the eyes of Matt O'Leary's character when all of a sudden the rug is yanked out and I was forced to re-evaluate the entire movie in a span of about 5-10 minutes. However, this is a well made film with many unnerving moments, and is easy to recommend.  The screenwriter said something that was especially creepy.  I'm paraphrasing: The scariest thing about religious fanaticism is...what if it's true?  The used copies are unusually cheap here, as well, making this a supreme bargain.

This movie starts out in the present when a man called Fenton comes into tell the FBI that he knows who the god's hand killer is. The person head of the FBI comes in and starts to talk to Fenton. Fenton then begins to explain that the god's hand killer is infact his brother.
The Head of the FBI started at first thinking that this guy is just feeding him BS. Fenton then starts to say that this all began in 1968 when his father, (the mother had passed away) and his brother and him all lived together happily. Well, it all ended when his father had a vision from a angel telling him that there are demons among the earth and that him (and his sons) must slay them. Well, Fenton knows that his father is insane. These were real people that he was slaying. So time passes and Fenton actually starts to watch as his father going on and filling out these missions. Fenton has to make a decision, desert his father or save the innocent people.
This Movie freaked me out at the end. The end has a real twist that scares you, Bill Paxton did a great job as the Dad, and Matthew McConoughy (did i spell that right?)really scared me as the older version of Fenton (well... and Adam) If you don't like scary movies don't watch this, if you do watch it.

1740678,5,B00006AUMZ,"Over the years, serial killers have become a staple of the horror genre.  The concept that such intense cruelty and brutality can be committed by someone who could live right next door to you is infinitely more terrifying than any vampire, werewolf, or zombie could ever hope to be.
Still, the serial killer genre is in danger of becoming stale and overused.  For every ""Silence of the Lambs"" there are about 10 ""Jason X""s, and for every ""Se7en"" there are a hundred ""Urban Legend""s.  And between the two extremes lies a hoard of forgettable, mediocre films.
Frailty, however, is just the sort of film to breathe new life back into the genre.  In his directorial debut, Bill Paxton brings us a dark, surreal crime thriller with a touch of the supernatural.
The movie begins when Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey) arrives in the office of FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth) claiming the serial killer calling himself ""God's Hands"" is really his younger brother, Adam.  In an effort to convince Agent Doyle of his sincerity, he begins to relate the horrifying tale of his childhood.
As Fenton talks, the film flashes back to 1979, showing Fenton and Adam as young boys (played respectively by Matthew O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter) living with their recently widowed father (Paxton), referred to only as `Dad'.  Dad is your average working-class father, working as an auto-mechanic and trying his best to raise his two sons right.
Fenton's idyllic world begins to crumble around him, however, when one night Dad claims to have been visited by an angel.  He's been told that he and his sons have been made ""God's Hands"", and it is their duty to destroy demons.  Although these demons have taken the forms of normal humans, Dad claims he and his sons will see them for what they truly are: utter monsters.  Over the next week, Dad is sent a set of holy tools (an axe and a pair of gloves found in an abandoned barn), and a list of demons to destroy (a seemingly random list of normal people).  Before long he's destroying demons, or as Fenton sees it, killing innocent people.  Worse still, as the killings progress, Adam is being drawn further into his father's world of religious mania.
Most of the movie takes place during the '79 flashback, making O'Leary, Sumpter, and Paxton the stars of the movie.  O'Leary skillfully depicts young Fenton's struggle between his love for his family and his horror over Dad's actions.  Sumpter displays a similar conflict in his character, but he is torn between his brother and his father's mission.  He's the innocent youngster who loves his father unconditionally, and refuses to believe he's gone insane.  Paxton's performance is simply chilling.  He discusses destroying demons with his sons in the same tone he might use to talk about baseball or homework.  He feels only duty towards ""destroying demons"", but gets physically ill when he's forced to commit a real murder.
McConaughey is barely seen until the end of the movie, and spends most of the film narrating his flashback.  When he is seen, he's chillingly detached and morose.  You can tell he's hiding something, but you can't tell just what until it's almost staring you in the face.
For his directorial debut, Paxton does a remarkable job.  He cuts deftly between the present day and '79, without making the story confusing as could easily be done.  The death scenes show everything up to the moment of the killing, forcing you to cringe and imagine the gore rather than see it for yourself.
Of course it helps that he was given a fantastic script to work with by Brent Hanley.  There are a number of twists throughout the film that you probably won't see coming until they're revealed.  The ending makes the film all the more terrifying and shatters any preconceived beliefs you may have had, although some may find it a bit heavy-handed.
Frailty isn't just scary; it's creepy as hell.  Any fan of horror and psychological thrillers should find this movie more than worth the DVD price.",1068336000,,3989,4.81524926686217

1740680,5,B00006AUMZ,"There is no one word to describe Bill Paxton's FRAILTY (2002), his directorial debut.  All three of the above words apply to this tantalizing, amazing film--the most amazing fact is that this IS Bill Paxton's directorial debut.  This movie is so well crafted with a master's artistic hand that you would swear that a suspense veteran such as Brian De Palma (CARRIE, OBSESSION), Ridley Scott (ALIEN), Barbet Schroeder (SINGLE WHITE FEMALE) or Taylor Hackford (THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE) had directed it.  I personally cannot wait to review Mr. Paxton's next film; I'm sure that it will be different, but great nonetheless.
FRAILTY itself is different--a very different kind of movie.  It begins by being told in a conventional manner, via the flashback technique.  In fact, it sets the story up so conventionally that we fall rather easily for the direction in which Paxton takes us.  This film successfully manipulates us to believe that the story is heading in one particular way.  By the end, we've been duped, and duped so brilliantly that we had never seen it coming to us in the first place.
FRAILTY is regarded as a horror/suspense thriller.  If this film has to be categorized, then this would probably be the most accurate label to put on it.  If you're reading this far, you undoubtably know that it is about religious fanaticism and the violent acts resulting from it.  You know that it concerns Bill Paxton as a Texas ""Dad"" (who is, interestingly enough, never named in the film, another tactic of artistic brilliance on the part of Brent Hanley, who wrote the film's screenplay) who awakens his two young sons in the middle of an otherwise ordinary night and breathlessly tells them of a ""revelation from a heavenly angel"" about what they ""now must do"" in the name of ""God's work.""  What they ""now must do"" involves killing ""demons in human form"" by way of decaptitation via the axe.
The family last name is ""Meiks"" (which phonetically sounds like ""meek""--I wonder if the film's title relates to that?), and the two sons, Fenton and Adam (ages 12 and 9, respectively) are now left to take this information all in.  The younger one does, the older one doesn't--in fact, he believes that Dad has just flipped, as he had apparently never been much of a religious man and, besides, this plan to ""rid the world of demons"" sounds just plain crazy.  However, the axe-slayings do begin to occur; one son goes along willingly and the other tries to resist as best as he possibly can.
You know all of the above by now.  But if you think that this is all of what FRAILTY is about, then you don't even know the half of it.  This brilliant film has more twists and turns that you could shake a Magnolia stick at; however, these twists/turns are handled with a maximum of subtlety and with a minimum of incredulity.
The acting performances of all of the principals are genuine, and never step wrongly even once.  Bill Paxton walks an incredibly fine line of portraying a character who remains sympathetic even as he is systematically decapitating those he believes are not human beings, but demons.  Matthew O'Leary does an excellent job of portraying the elder Meiks child as emotionally conflicted between the love of his father and the hatred for what it is he's doing.  Jeremy Sumpter creates a perfect counter-foil as the younger, more impressionable and believing son for whom this murderous rampage either makes total sense, or he is simply following the wishes of his father.  But it us Matthew McConaughey's performance that is the most memorable; it is an absolute outrage that he did not receive a nomination for Best Supporting Actor in this role, the most enigmatic of his career.
Lastly, it is the screenplay by Brent Hanley and direction by Bill Paxton that are the real stars of the film; inded, this movie should have received Oscar nominations in both categories, and for Best Picture, to boot.  It is just another example of unfair bias against the horror/suspense genre; that a film of markedly greater quality than most of the overblown and overrated dramas that are usually honored becomes lost in the Hollywood shuffle of the Holiday Season.  It's too bad, because most of the axemurders depicted in this film are offscreen; indeed, what is most palpable in each and every scene (and, ultimately, more horrifying) is the *psychological* horror involved in the telling of this story.  It is a story that is totally believable; indeed, it is amazing to my mind that it does not even claim to have been based on a true story!  It is also a story that is emotionally draining.  Finally, it is a story that is so well-told that it makes you reflect on it for a good long time afterwards.

1740681,4,B00006AUMZ,"""Frailty"" tells the story of two boys, Fenton and Adam, who live with their father (director and actor Bill Paxton) who, one night, has a vision coming from God that guides him to a path of killing. He has to kill demons that live among humans, and that have the aspect of human beings. The two boys are forced to witness and participate to the slayings, but the oldest, Fenton, has a different opinion on all that...Seems very simple? I'm not telling you more than that, because any other detail about the plot would be too much...and let me tell you that the film is much more than that, really. There is an impressive amount of sub-plots and it truly is one of the most complicated films since Curtis Hanson's ""L.A. Confidential"".
Directed by Bill Paxton, known for his roles in James Cameron's ""Aliens"" and Sam Raimi's ""A Simple Plan"" among many others, this man proves that he's not only a good actor, but also a very promising director. Paxton's film is dark, hypnotic, it truly has a creepy atmosphere that reminds of Danny Boyle's ""Shallow Grave"". The film is structured in two different periods of time, one is the sons' youth, and the other is their adulthood, but both of them are haunting and amazingly moody and well-done.
The acting is really great too, and the boys surprised me...personally, except for Danny Lloyd in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" and a couple of other young actors that did a good job, I didn't see god young actors very often...but these guys are very good. Bill Paxton, Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe all made an extremely good job acting, especially Paxton, who plays a very believable and likeable father that is tormented and deranged but still believes in what he does. His character is full of dilemmas, goodness, and a part of evil (that borrows the name of good in the film). McConaughey reminds me of Kevin Spacey's character in Brian Synger's ""The Usual Suspects"". You'll have to see the film to understand what I just said...really. Powers Boothe is great too, with another character that brings plot twists, even though that could be the last thing you'd expect. Great acting.
And now, a very strong element in this film, the scenario. It is really good. It takes the skeleton of an horror movie, to which rich plot twists are added in addition of interesting characters we TRULY care about. And that's a rare thing in an horror film. The dialogues are quite good, and the story, even though it may first sound pretty simple is very developped and complex. Brent Hanley (the man that wrote the film) is close to Christopher McQuarrie (the scenarist of ""The Usual Suspects"") and I'd even say he (kind of) has more merit because he made an HORROR film scary and truly intelligent taking a different path than Stephen King with ""The Shining"", which has intelligent horror based on insanity...""Frailty"", somehow, took this path, but wrote a scenario that could still make sense in a Crime film or Film-Noir...and he still gave a scary flavor to his story, and Paxton enriched it with his nice directing. Hanley is the Ray Bradbury of these days, really.
Overall, those who are tired of recent horror films (the boring ""Resident Evil"", the ridiculous ""Queen of The Damned"", or the fundamentally awful ""Valentine"", among others) will be pleased. People who think horror movies are stupid will be stunned. People that believe horror movies contain gallons of blood will be speechless. This film is very good. Very good. It is entertaining, but not in the usual Hollywood way to be entertained...there are no special effects, no CGI, no creature effects, no gore...but that's not the point! This is an (unfortunately) unusual way to make an horror movie...this film is original, simple but at the same time very complex (you may need more than one viewing to catch it all). You'll watch five minutes of it, and you'll be hooked until the very uncommon and GREAT ending. Some scenes are disturbing for the characters, but not for the viewer, the nuance is that the viewer feels how disturbed the characters are, and we feel really close to them...that's how an horror film should work! Also, there are many discussion topics in this film, and they question many things and believe me, this film will make many think...especially about religion. ""Frailty"" criticizes religion, especially the way believers understand it. ""Frailty"" has many faces, it's a rich film, and it is very enjoyable, especially for those who love horror films. But the range of viewers is much wider than that. Haunting film. Great directing and scenario. Oh yeah, and acting too. Thanks a lot Mr. Paxton, you delivered a very good horror film.",1065484800,,4664,4.83125
1740682,5,B00006AUMZ,"The end of the world is coming. No one is safe.
Twelve-year old Fenton Meiks leads a normal life albeit the absence of a mother. He feels secure growing up in a small Southern town, looking after his younger brother Adam and being cared for by his loving, average-Joe widowed mechanic father. Until the night his father receives a visit from an angel. According to the `angel', Fenton's father is assigned the divine mission of destroying demons. Demons, Fenton's father claims, walk this Earth in human form and commit acts of heinous evil. From that night, Fenton's life was never the same again. His father believed that he found the magical weapons he needed in a shed, and brought home an axe (with the name `Otis' carved in its handle - most eerie!), a steel pipe of some sort and a pair of gloves. While at work, Fenton's father receives another visitation wherein the angel gives him a list of names of demons that he, as `God's Hand', has to destroy. The first abduction and killing takes place that night and it is a grisly event witnessed by the two boys. Adam is a fervent believer while Fenton is skeptical and fearful as he watches his well-loved world crumble around him. Both child actors give not merely credible, but utterly compelling, performances. It is not until many, many years later that Fenton goes to the police, specifically, FBI Agent Doyle, with his sinister tale. The central imagery in this story is a rose garden that lies beside the Meik home. It is to this place that Agent Doyle is led, and another story unfolds. Is the boys' father a psychopath, or something else? Was the young Adam so impressionable that he had been brainwashed by his father into believing that their little family was chosen to be God's Hands? Is there no end to this terror, this series of seemingly mindless and unjustified murders that can neither be traced nor stopped?  The element of horror in this movie is not of the scream-out-loud, in-your-face variety. Instead, it is a plot as quiet and dignified as it is disturbing and macabre. This is a tale that makes you rethink your classifications of good and evil. The excellent lighting, cinematography and flashback effect in the plot lends a mythical quality to this movie. A brilliant departure from the usual redneck rampage, axe-murderer story, `Frailty' is a poignant movie with a sound storyline that will intrigue, frighten and haunt you.",1065052800,,2410,4.779376498800959
1740683,5,B00006AUMZ,"Matthew O'Leary.  Remember that name.  Although he'll probably be remembered most for his roles in the two SPY KIDS movies, this is a performance of rare depth and power from such a young man.  He plays little Fenton Meeks in this richly layered directorial debut for Bill Paxton.  Paxton co-stars as his father, who one day out of the blue is told by angels he must start killing ""demons"".  Along with Jeremy Sumpter as brother Adam, he is coerced in helping destroy these demons.  We find this out through the reminiscings of a now adult Fenton, played with controlled passion by Matthew McConaughey.  Fenton has come to an FBI agent's office (the delightfully morose Powers Boothe) to tell him that he knows the identity of a current serial killer called ""God's Hand Killer.""  The killer, he says, is his brother.
Brett Hanley's script is full of twists and turns, and a shocker of an ending.  Paxton gives us some really disturbing imagery, including an angel that visits Paxton while he is working underneath a car; and some riveting scenes involving young Fenton's imprisonment in a cellar.
This is a dark and disturbing film, but is well made and sticks with you after you've seen it.

1740684,4,B00006AUMZ,"Watch this without expectations, it has a plot like I've never seen before and handles it in a pretty credible manner (although some agnostic folks may cringe). Bill Paxton's character has apparently been chosen by an ""angel"" who appeared in his dreams to rid the world of demons, and his two young boys react differently to his newfangled agenda in life. One thinks he's gone off the deep end, while the younger son is all set in his father's ways.
Through a fairly long-winded but gripping flashback, Mathew McConaughey explains to an FBI agent what it was like growing up witnessing this and he thinks his brother has grown up to be as crazy as their father. Some intriguing twists and turns follow, leading to a smokin' denouement.
Definitely worth a cool Sunday afternoon viewing, and I suggest refraining from reading too many reviews. Spoils the fun for movies like this where the crux hinges on one little notion, a bit like Sixth Sense.",1061683200,,945,4.7682926829268295
1740685,1,B00006AUMZ,"Personally, I'm scared stiff of rural America. You never know when some innocuous looking town you've just entered may just be the murder capitol of America, nay the world. You know, just about everyone behind a counter is either a wife murderer, child killer, guilty of matricide or on a homicidal mission from God. And that's just the tourist office. They even kill the sheriff too and presumably solve the conspicuous car with flashing lights problem by burying it in the rosebed next to him. Killing people by starving them for weeks is a non starter, though. You won't even go blind nor lose a single lock of hair. No, the best method is still a trusty axe. Just remember to carve your name in the handle for easy forensic identification. Yup, just passing through. No time to visit the barber in case he cuts your throat. Sheesh, I'd rather walk around looking like the Uni-bomber. Or Grizzly Addams if you thought that was tasteless. Speaking of tastlessness, can I recommend a film called 'Frailty'? No, I can't really. Whenever visiting small town America, look out for Bill Paxton. If you see him, hit the gas. Film wise, Bill Paxton and the deep south definately don't mix. I'm not fond of films that mix kids up in adult sleaziness anyway, because you don't know what the psychological effects will be at such a tender age. Like 'Funny Games', this film crosses the line.

Now I see that Matthew McConaughey was Adam, but he told the FBI agent that it was his brother Adam who had killed all those people. I thought I understood what was going on during the boys' childhood, but during the grown-up scenes I became completely confused.

1740738,4,B00006AUMZ,"Directed by and Starring Bill Paxton, FRAILTY is one of the scariest and most effective horror films I've seen in a long time.
A serial murderer known as the God's Hand Killer is terrorising Texas; but the police investigation into the slayings is throwing up nothing but false leads and dead ends.
This changes when a man named Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey) shows up at the local police station claiming to know the identity of the killer: his brother Adam. FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) listens to his story, with the principal portion of the movie told in flashback mode.
This takes us back to the Summer of 1979 in rural Texas where we meet the Meiks family: The young Fenton (Matt O'Leary), Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) and their Dad (Paxton) a mechanic, who is raising the boys on his own after their mother died giving birth.
At first glance the Meikses appear the epitome of a happy, loving family. But all that changes when one night Dad has a dream in which an angel visits him and warns him  that demons are taking over the World to prepare for the forthcoming apocalypse. God will give Dad the power to be able to see inside people's heads to identify if they're demons or not, the Meikses will be the only people to know of this. If the people are demons, then Dad must kill them. He will receive automatic immunity from this because by disposing of them Dad is doing God's Will (What ever happened to Thou shalt not kill? Talk about hypocrisy!). Dad and his sons will be among the only survivors if they obey. Judgment Day is coming (minus Arnie).
So Dad gets to work. God's Will involves kidnapping ""sinners"" and imprisoning them in his barn; then forcing the boys to watch while he kills them with his trusty ax. (The murders themselves aren't shown). What a model father! Then Fenton and Adam are given the job of burying the bodies in the rose garden-a popular place for burying the deceased in the movies.
It becomes blatantly obvious that as the bodies pile up and Dad makes the boys start digging a shelter that will keep them safe from the end of the World; that their father has become a major league fruit cake, with extra nuts.
Criticism aside, in general I found FRAILTY to be a film about a man who loves his sons but is severely mentally ill, driven over the edge by mania; with his fundamentalist dogma psychologically scarring his sons for life. Thus creating the Adam who would go on to become the God's Hand Killer. (Personally I'd like to think God is jolly like Santa- but then again Santa is an anagram of Satan!!).
FRAILTY works brilliantly mainly because the horror it portrays is chillingly plausible, so kudos must go to writer Brett Hanley. It takes a little while for the viewer to get fully involved, but once it gets going FRAILTY is a great little horror/thriller with a climactic twist you won't see coming.
If you enjoyed movies like ROSEMARY'S BABY and JEEPERS CREEPERS you'll have a lot of fun with this one. FRAILTY is one of those movies that inevitably will anger fundamentalist Christians (Gee, I wonder who?). Thankfully, FRAILTY went to DVD in NZ with an R16 rating and no problems- maybe this film hit too close to home for NZ's self appointed moral ""watchdogs""? Highly recommended.

You have 10 times the terror, suspence, and tension that you' d get from the run of the mill slasher film, without the gore.  I'm not much into blood for the sake of it in films.
There are some very disturbing scenes but the film's tension is based in the brilliance of the screenplay, cinematography, and the fabulous performance of the actors.  I'd recommend Frailty to anyone.",1058054400,,515,4.565217391304348

1740741,4,B00006AUMZ,"FRAILTY could be considered a horror, but it's too good to be placed in that genre.  Most horror films are fairly B-grade, but Frailty is a well made film, with excellent acting and a nicely paced plot.  I would class it as a thriller movie.  An interesting theme about a father who receives a 'message' from God asking him to rid the earth of certain demons.  The father enlists the help of his young sons, willing or not, on his mission.  Surprise ending which perhaps puts a question mark over the father being a total nutcase.
Matthew McGaughley plays the son retelling the story later in life.  This helps pace the film nicely and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I wasn't expecting much to begin with, as I had almost given up on so called new horror and thriller films - but Frailty is a very enthralling, if not disturbing, film.  It made me think of two Christopher Walken fims ('At Close Range', and 'Dead Zone').  You'll see what I mean when you watch Frailty.

I did finally see the film now that it has been out on video and the like. I was totally surprised by how it developed and turned out. Some people are classifying this as horror and that is not the case. This film is more in the mystery, suspense territory: (the UNBREAKABLE league). I mean what the story sets the viewer up for takes a very stunning twist and turn at the end. Because I know movies well, I kind of was on target with my initial prediction but it was further off point than I would have ever imagined.
This is one of those films that contain many religious elements about God but SEEMINGLY taken too far to the zealous and fanatical level. However, although I am a devout Christian, I was kind of turned off by the craziness of Bill Paxton towards his children about killing the demons that lurk the earth. I thought for sure that he was out of his mind; that he had some kind of mental condition that was seriously affecting him. I was wrong as the film went on though because it is something that was substantial. It was actually a mission from God that he was put on with his sons who have their own twists with who is really who and who is not on the dad's side and who is really what the dad is against. I do not want to give all of the plot away but this is definitely a film that you gotta see. I really do not promote films that much but I am going to get all the people I know to see this masterpiece of a film. The directions that it travels down is fascinating. Although it did not make too much noise at the box office, it stil is a very good film. Get it and watch it to see what I am talking about.",1055289600,,1763,4.054441260744985
1740743,2,B00006AUMZ,"Frailty is the type of suspense/psychological thriller that relies heavily on a surprising plot twist to make it stand out in a genre that is usually over saturated each year.  If done well, this type of film leaves a lasting impression and usually develops quite a fan base, the prime example being The Usual Suspects.  By placing so much emphasis on the plot twist or surprise ending though, the film effectively ""puts all its eggs in one basket"", so to speak.  The surprise ending therefore must not only be excellent, but must also be able to stand up to scrutiny from viewers who will attempt to punch holes in the plot.
Frailty is based on a very promising and intriguing, albeit unoriginal, concept.  The film presents a killer who takes the lives of sinners in God's name, then blurs the lines between whether or not that killer is actually justified in his actions.  The premise itself certainly raises questions, sparks debate, and provokes thought on the part of the viewer, all of which are aspects of good filmmaking.  However, this idea has already been explored and presented much better in the film Seven.
The area in which Frailty really suffers though is at its very heart, its surprise ending.  The film does a good job of leading the viewer down one path and then completely turning around and catching the viewer off guard, but the twist seems forced and rushed, and we are left with very little evidence to strengthen its plausibility.  The film expects its viewers to accept much of its plot twist on faith alone, which is ironic and clever, considering much of the film deals with faith, though I doubt it is intentional.  In the end, the surprise ending of Frailty, and therefore the entire film, does not pack enough punch to remain nearly as memorable as many other movies based upon similar formulas.",1053388800,,1828,4.7413249211356465
1740744,4,B00006AUMZ,"This movie has got one of the most twisted endings I have ever seen, but it only adds to the characterization and storyline that makes ""Frailty"" stand alone in the world of horror movies. Relying more on plot than on gore, you learn more about the characters in the film rather than the anatomy of their insides. With excellent acting by Bill Paxton and newcome Matt O'Leary as young Fenton, the film shows religious fanaticism and doubt. Based on God in the old testament, it shows how God's will is above the law in order to protect His kingdom. Another great aspect of this film is trying to figure out who is telling the trunth and who isn't. We all know Fenton doesn't believe his father, but the question ""Frailty"" asks is, who do we believe? Even at the end your head is still spinning from the fast, dramatic plot change, so even seeing the movie once isn't enough to figure out EXACTLY what happened. An excellent movie promising scares and suspense, in a gothic version on the Old Testament.",1053129600,,1001,4.566666666666666

1740766,4,B00006AUMZ,"This is probably one of the better horror movies I've seen in a long time. Unlike those cheesy, slasher flicks that cause you to jump maybe once or twice in your seat, this movie presents a subtle horror that stays with you long after you have watched it.
The movie is about a widowed man, played with fierce intensity by Bill Paxton, who wakes up in the middle of the night one night and has a vision. He believes God came to him and asked him to rid the world of evil demons aka humans by murdering them and that God would send him special weapons to do the task. The religious (insane?) man wants to fulfill God's will and asks his two sons to help him.
The oldest son believes his father is crazy while the youngest boy is too little to believe anything different than what his father says is true. Skip to the future and the oldest son, now played by Matthew McConaughey, goes to a detective to tell him everything he knows about the murders.
Flash backs and flash forwards help this unsettling tale unfold. The scariest part for me wasn't the murders themselves (which aren't really seen), its the fact that these boys' innocence was stripped from them and they watched helplessly as their father went on a mad murder spree.
Also unsettling are the questions this movie raises about the father's sanity and God. Was the father really insane or was it really God's will for him to rid the world of those people? Does God seek out certain people to take out the bad seeds for him? If the man was insane and God didn't want him to kill those people, why did he find that mysterious axe and where did ""the list"" come from? Its questions like these that will leave you hanging and leave you feeling spooked.
With great performances (what else would you expect from Bill or Matthew?), an incredible cast and an extremely spooky setting, this is the perfect scary movie to watch if you want to be scared out of your mind.
The most gripping moment of the movie for me was how the father punishes one of his boys for telling the police sheriff about the murders. That scene will stay with me for days now and I'm sure I'll have nightmares about it too.

1740768,4,B00006AUMZ,"It might seem that a movie like FRAILTY owes its very existence to the succes of THE SIXTH SENSE and a subsequent renewed interest in surprise plot twists--the kind that make you go ""Wha'??"" and resolve to see the film again and again.  Actually, given the timing of its release, it seems just as likely that FRAILTY was already ""greenlighted"" by the time the former film had taken the movie-going world by a storm.  Still its creators could only hope that they had stumbled onto an emerging trend--at the very least--and await a similar audience  reaction.
It didn't happen, of course.  It could be because the film is ultimately a lot grimmer than SIXTH SENSE.  As others have pointed out,below and elsewhere, the movie does not actually show a lot of blood and gore (thankfully, because more than enough is implied).  But this is the kind of film that begs to be labled ""disturbing"" by reviewers everywhere.  It's an apt term in this case. I left this film wondering if its producers could be cited for child abuse.  I figured there's almost no way that the child actors involved could not have been unduly traumatized.
Having said all that, I will add that this is a pretty effective suspense film.  Like the reviewer above, I find its ending more ambiguous than some reviewers.  But to say much more risks having to put a spoiler warning in my review's title.  In fact, I suspect that most of the reviews posted below should bear such a warning.

1740769,4,B00006AUMZ,"Directed and starring Bill Paxton, this round was much better than the last Paxton did with Traveller in which is starred in and produced.  Which was not bad for a first directorial effort.  It is dark and mysterious and has a great twist ending (I surely didn't expect).  I liked it even though my friend Louis didn't.  He teaches lighting for film and video and was disappointed in most of the film particularly the lighting.  I liked the story and felt it was a fun 'ride' through Fenton Meeks (Matthew McConaughey) telling of the murderous tale.  A surprising eleventh hour revelation puts the movie on its end of this well made psychological thriller.

By the way, there are spoilers in this review, but you might want to read it if you don't get the movie.
The main editorial review is wrong.  The movie is not about religious fanaticism. The father (Bill Paxton) really did receive messages from God and was really killing demons.  The older son is a demon, and Paxton's character's fatal flaw was not killing him.
If you really want to enjoy this film, watch the writer's commentary and then watch the film again.  Note, that I would not suggest this with just any film, but Frailty is a film that really deserves to be appreciated.",1051315200,,659,4.567796610169491
1740771,5,B00006AUMZ,"I loved this movie. it was creepy and a little scary but the main thing was it was a great story and and the filmmaking was superb. On the dvd, tricks of the trade were shown and i couldn't believe how easy some were. (like two flashlights looking like headlights) The plot was fastpaced all the way through and you find yourself not knowing whose side your on. you know soon enough though. I loved little quirky things about the film like the ""magical"" weapons dad recieved. (an axe named OTIS, a lead pipe and a pair of gloves.) I definately think this was one of the best films i've seen this year. i didn't understand one reviewer's comments. they said it was good, well done movie yet they gave it 1 star because it might make people go crazy or something. that jsut doesn't make since-if it's good, it's good, regardless of how some people might react. you can't rate a movie like that, if you like it you like it.

I thought that Matthew McConaughey had higher standards than this also. Frailty was as dumb as they come. The acting was miserable, the directing was extremely corny and the plot lacked. The dialogue was completely unreal. This was a lousy movie. I would put it on my list as one of the ten dumbest films that I have ever seen in my life. For a better Bill Paxton role, see Apollo 13, Vertical Limit, or Twister. For better Matthew McConaughey, see A Time To Kill. Don't waste your time with this.

1740773,5,B00006AUMZ,"Frailty in an amazing movie.  It is genuinely creepy and it presents everything that you see in a serious way that suggests that it is real.  The story is narrated by Matthew McConaughey.  McConaughey plays Fenton Meeks, a man who went to the FBI with the information that he knows who the God's Hand killer is.  Fenton tells the FBI agent that the killer is, in fact,  Fenton's brother.  However, to convince the agent, Fenton has to slowly tell the family history of how this would have come to be.
Fenton tells of his family, a widower and his two sons.  Everything is normal until the father wakes the two boys up in the middle of the night and tells them that he just had a vision from God.  The vision told him that there are demons walking around, and the Meeks family has been chosen by God to destroy the demons.  Sounds kind of whacked out, huh?  The movie presents this straightforward, with the only doubting coming from a young Fenton (though the comprise the bulk of the movie, these are flashback scenes).
Fenton tells the story to the FBI agent as they drive to where the bodies are buried.  It is a creepy story, but a very compelling one to watch.  Like any good horror movie, there is a twist, but how much you anticipate it depends on how perceptive you are.  There is a second deeper twist beyond the obvious that you might expect.
This is a well crafted first movie directed by Bill Paxton (who also stars as Fenton's father), and is worth watching without question.  Frailty is also worth owning.  An excellent movie.",1048464000,,1540,4.489208633093525
1740774,1,B00006AUMZ,"First of all let me say that it was a well-done flick.  The O'Leary youngster was exceptional, but...
The message of this movie is that there are demons on this world, and God can give any one of us a mission to destroy them.  This is a message that it frightens me to hear at this time, with fundamentalist religious fanatics all over the earth running around killing people.  The guys who killed 3000 people in New York were as religiously committed as the hero of this movie.  And we have people in this country running around attempting to murder people, abortion doctors for instance, who believe they have a mission from God.
I don't believe in censorship, nor have I ever thought that the material our entertainment industry gives us is damaging to normal minds.  But a disturbed person can find a message in almost anything, and this message is NOT subtle.
It might have been okay if the demon-killer had been damned, but I am very sorry that this film ever hit the screens.",1048291200,,982,4.556818181818182
1740786,5,B00006AUMZ,"""Frailty"" begins with Mathew McConaughey going to the FBI office in Texas an telling the agent in charge (Powers Boothe) the most-wanted serial killer who calls himself the ""God's Hands"" is, in fact, his brother. The story of the movie develops as McConaughey tells the FBI agent how his little family fell apart when his father (Bill Paxton, in one of his best performances) received the visit of an angel, 20 years ago, and this angel gives his father weapons and a list of ""demons"" that must be slain.
Of course, there's much more than this in the story, but I don't want to give anything away.
Paxton's first time direction is surprisingly competent and strong, although simple. The movie was shot in only 37 days. The visual is also very simple, but effective. Paxton is able o manipulate the audience, showing in the screen only what is needed to understand the movie. There are lots of violent scenes, but only once we are shown blood.
I felt this thriller's story was a mix of a Stephen King's book  (""Bag of bones"", for example) with similarities to movies like ""Seven"". In the last five minutes, the dozens of plot twists may be confusing, but I was able to understand all what was happening because of the good edition and script of the movie.
In the end, there are lots of subliminar implications that made me think about the motives and reasons for the serial killings. I was also impressed by the children's performances, and that is a hard thing to accomplish if you're a first-time director.
""Frailty"" is the simple kind of movie that is hard to forget because of its strong presence. Another movie I could say the same thing about, although in the sci-fi genre, is ""Event Horizon"". They're low profile, they almost don't get the attention they deserve, and they're a good surprise when you watch them.

1740788,5,B00006AUMZ,"I saw the trailer for Frailty shortly before it was released theatrically, and knew I had to go see it as soon as I saw that Sam Raimi had given it a great review.  When the director of the Evil Dead trilogy, A Simple Plan, and most recently Spiderman gives a movie a good review I know I have to see it.
  So I found myself in the theater a week or so later, viewing for the first time what would become one of my favorite films in recent memory.
  Frailty is an edge of the seat thriller.  Bill Paxton, in his directorial debut, stars as the father of two young boys, who claims God has chosen him as a warrior, a man chosen to battle the demons that roam our earth in human form.  He convinces the youngest of his sons, but has trouble getting his eldest son to believe the story.  The scary thing about this film is, Bill Paxton truly believes it himself.
  The two kids are witness to their father murdering a number of ""demons"" in their toolshed, and with each murder the oldest son feels more and more tension growing between him and his father, and even tries to convince his younger brother to run away with him.
  The kids are wonderful actors, and Bill Paxton is amazing.  He is a truly talented actor, and as he proves with this film, a very talented director as well.
  Some of the scenes in this movie are very disturbing, and they deal with murder and child abuse, but it's all key to the plot.  I strongly recommend this movie to any fan of suspense thrillers, most notably A Simple Plan by Sam Raimi and more recently Panic Room by David Fincher.

Not many movies can do that now.

I love this movie. The acting is top-notch, the cinematography is spectacular (includes my favorite scene of all time, the one with the barn, and the light... you know what I mean) I believe that this is a classic, and should be seen by anybody who can stomache it.

1740790,3,B00006AUMZ,"***1/2 Sometimes the sign of a great talent lies not so much in what an artist does, but in what he chooses NOT to do.  This is the case with Bill Paxton, whose ""Frailty"" marks his debut as a director of extraordinary promise and note.  Paxton begins with a story that could easily have served as the basis for just another cheap exploitation picture, just another slasher film filled with gruesome carnage, senseless violence and inane stereotypes and clichs.  Instead, Paxton has utilized intelligence and restraint to turn his project into that rarest of cinematic commodities: a ""thinking man's"" thriller, a breed almost unheard of in this day and age when unbridled excess and smash-and-grab sensationalism are the too-familiar hallmarks of the horror movie genre.
Written by Brent Hanley, ""Frailty"" is a chilling tale of madness and murder, a horror story more concerned with character and tone than with mayhem and bloodshed (though there is certainly some of that in the film as well).  Paxton plays ""Dad"" Meiks, a blue-collar widower with two young sons, who late one night in 1979 experiences what he believes is a vision from God, informing Meiks that he has been set apart for a special purpose:  to root out and destroy the ""demons"" who have infiltrated this world unnoticed, hidden in the guise of ordinary people.  As the Lord's specially appointed Avenging Angel, Meiks, with the help of his sons, sets off on his mission, searching out and brutally eliminating numerous people whose identities have been ""supernaturally"" revealed to him.
The story is told from the viewpoint of Meiks' older son, Fenton, played by Matthew O'Leary as a child, and by Matthew McConaughey, as an adult (at least ostensibly).  The film is framed in the form of a flashback, with a disturbed ""Fenton"" coming forth at long last to unburden himself to the authorities, in this case Agent Wesley Doyle, played by Powers Boothe.  As ""Fenton"" reveals the intricate details of the case, a gripping tale of the power of insanity and of filial love and commitment emerges.  It would be unfair to reveal the surprise twist at the end that puts an entirely new spin on the story we have been watching.  Suffice it to say that it succeeds in making us rethink every single detail of the film in an entirely different light.  The result is that the film haunts us for days after seeing it.
Unlike most filmmakers working in this genre - who mistakenly believe that terror is achieved in direct proportion to how over-the-top one can get - Paxton understands that the greatest horror is the one rooted in the mundane realities of everyday life.  It is only when those realities suddenly twist themselves into unfamiliar and unsettling shapes and forms that true bloodcurdling terror occurs. Young Fenton, in particular, has his safe, happy world shattered the moment his father bursts into his room in the middle of the night to reveal his macabre plan.  From then on, Fenton's existence becomes a waking nightmare, as he has to live with the gruesome reality of what his father is doing.  Yet on the surface, life appears to go on with an air of banal normality, a disturbing tone Paxton exploits to maximum effect.  In fact, the sheer matter-of-fact way in which Paxton tells his story is what makes the movie so unsettling.
The performances are excellent, particularly by O'Leary, as the bewildered young boy who loves his father dearly but who simply cannot reconcile and countenance the incomprehensible and grisly acts he sees him performing.  In subtle strokes, this superb young actor reveals the terrifying helplessness that occurs when rational goodness goes up against the implacable force of an unreasoning, twisted mind.  Jeremy Sumpter also does a fine job as Adam, Fenton's younger brother, who seems less resistant to his father's mad ranting than does Fenton.  McConaughey conveys the utter sadness of a man who has lived too long with a terrible secret, and Boothe demonstrates a quiet assurance as the authority figure to whom this disturbed young man finally reveals that secret.  As the killer, Paxton himself underplays his role beautifully, making us almost sympathize with the strange obsession that has taken hold of his character.
""Frailty"" is not your typical serial killer movie in that it remains low-keyed and understated throughout.  By choosing to not go over-the-top with this material - as he so easily could have done - Paxton has created a work that is genuinely creepy, chilling and disturbing, and also demonstrated that he is a director who bears serious watching.
And that turnabout at the end is a real kicker.",1044057600,,4633,4.953548387096774
1740791,3,B00006AUMZ,"This is a highly original and thought-provoking piece which, in terms of its story, sits somewhere between Stephen King and Jorge Luis Borges. That's a very good starting point, so it's slightly disappointing that it's partly undermined by a repetitive screenplay (just how many times do characters need to state their positions on God's will?) which relies too heavily on voiceover narration. While it's true that McConaughey's character is literally telling the story for most of the film, his insistent voiceover yanks us out of the moment and dilutes the tension. And in general, it isn't required: Paxton gets such good performances from the kids that we don't need to be told what's going on inside their heads - we can see it on their faces. Imaginative viewers might predict a few of the plot turns, but the story never reveals where it's headed too soon. And while Act 3 does employ the twist-laden high jinks which cap most thrillers, it doesn't resort to explaining every last detail of what you've seen. Writer Brent Hanley and director Paxton have the sense and the confidence to leave things with an appealing ambiguity which helps maintain the unsettling tone to the end. Overall, Paxton's direction is rock solid. This is a very impressive debut.  A quite timely one, too, given that religious fanatics are both attacking and defending the West these days.",1043884800,,1372,4.965217391304348
1740792,4,B00006AUMZ,"Frailty, I will admit is better than most of the modern horror films out there, but at the same time it's kind of poorly acted and lacks a little common sense. The ending is predictable, and the music is bad. Frailty is about a guy who murders people with an axe because he thinks they are demons. It's not gory (sorry gore fans), and Bill's preformance is somewhat laughable. No offense though, I've seen WAY worse!(ala Scream and Jack-O) Anyway if you are thinking about seeing it, than go right ahead, but don't expect to much, because this movie doesn't deliver.",1043193600,,566,4.6138613861386135

1740794,4,B00006AUMZ,"Imagine you're an average man.  You have an average job and an average family, an ordinary life.  But one night, perhaps a little early to bed, you have a vision from God.  This vision informs you that demons are walking the earth, and you and your two young sons are God's appointed demon slayers in these last days.  Not long after that, an angel with a flaming sword appears to you at work, and gives you a list of demons to slay.  The problem is that these demons inhabit the bodies of other ordinary human beings.  They look like people, not demons.  But you're not deterred from your mission for an instant.  Because you're doing God's work, and God must be obeyed.
This is the plot of Frailty, starring Matthew McConaughey  and Bill Paxton.  The chilling part is that this sort of thing happens in real life; perhaps it's happening right now as you read this review-somewhere, someone believes they are driven by God to slay demons, demons that look like you and me, but the slayer can see that we're demons.  By the end of this movie, you will re-evaluate the plausibility of the story's premise, but trust me, father and son alike are as crazy as banshees.  Nowhere in God's Holy Bible does it say anything about human beings going forth to slay demons in the name of God.  But no matter.  Most serial killers don't care about that small detail anyway.
I was left wondering how someone with such a normal and quiet life could suddenly become gripped by homicidal delusions, and be so assured in his mission that he'd subject his children to the most gruesome abuse.  Sadly, Frailty is a kind of American gothic, where ""serial killer"" is a household word and almost everyone lives in a town that has been turned into a media circus during a manhunt, a trial, or both.  It's the realism of Frailty that makes it so scary.  This isn't a splatter movie, but you know what happens.  The story is told effectively with a minimum of graphic violence.  You see it in your mind's eye, and that is enough.
Thought-provoking, stick-to-your-ribs scariness.  Don't see this movie if you are prone to nightmares or obsessing on the horrific.",1042243200,,2136,4.6005291005291005
1740795,5,B00006AUMZ,"This movie is crazy. During Frailty, you'll wonder who is right and who is wrong. You'll wonder what is real and what is not. And that's why Frailty is great.
 No, this isn't some sissy Halloween or Scream [movie]; this is a gung-ho, hell, fire, and brimstone jubilee. Frailty is about people killing through the divine influence of God. Yeah, that's pretty screwed up. Would God really have people here on earth do his dirty work? No way, the people in this movie must be insane. They're just imagining things. At least that's what Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey) thinks. Unfortunately, his father (Bill Paxton) disagrees.
 I suppose it'd be pretty rough to see your dad hack somebody to death with an axe, especially as a child. If my dad was that serious about something, rest assured that I'd believe him. Fortunately, Frailty shows scenes like these discretely, politely, and tastefully. The movie isn't as appalling as it sounds. I mean, it sure isn't family fun, but it's such a great movie.
 It just hit a note on me. I was chilled down to the bone. I remember walking out of the theater with my mouth open. I looked over to my friend and said, ""That was insane.""

Most know the plot of the movie. Bill Paxton plays ""Dad"" (we never know his name). He wakes his two sons up telling them that God told him to kill all the ""demons"". ""Dad"" rationalizes it saying that killing people is wrong, but since he's killing demons, it isn't wrong. ""Adam"", the youngest son believes his father, while ""Fenton"", the oldest son is hestiant about the whole thing and thinks his father has lost it.
Matthew McConaughey tells this FBI agent played by Powers Boothe that his brother, Adam, is the God's Hand killer. The story is told in flashbacks by Fenton (McConaughey).
The twist is that you start to think that maybe, just maybe the father isn't all that crazy.
I hate to say anymore, but Matthew McConaughey is awesome. This is one of the best roles of his career. I want to say why, but let's just say, I would like to see him in more ""not nice"" roles.
Even after you watch this movie more than once and you know the surprise, it will still leave you with your mind all twisted up!!

1740807,5,B00006AUMZ,"After missing this film in theaters (the rave reviews got me, but I had no time to see it), I finally got a chance to see this film on dvd.  This film is very unusual.  It starts off as a seemingly standard thriller, but it mesmerizes you with a build-up that makes the ending nearly impossible to guess.  That to me is the markings of a superb first-rate thriller/horror film.  Bill Paxton is truly a talented director and the screenplay is excellent.  The acting work of the principal characters is compelling and the film at first appears to be the story of a man gone mad.  Paxton's character is seemingly a man who is going insane as he claims that he is receiving visions from God that instruct him to kill people who are demons in disguise.  What's more disturbing is that he drags his two small boys into this venture of being ""god's hands"" on earth.  The two child actors (Matthew O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter) also do an excellent and natural job as the Mieks brothers.  Fenton, the older boy, opposes his father's new ""divine"" mission, while Adam seems to have fallen under his father's ""spell"" and believes that they are a family of demon-fighters.  The film is presented in two timelines, one taking place in the present and the other described in flashbacks by the grown Fenton Mieks (played nicely by Mathew McConaughey) who narrates the events to an FBI agent played by Powers Boothe.  This is a gem of a film and disappeared at the box office almost overnight (not surprising as it has a weak title and was not marketed effectively in my opinion), but is worth checking out if you enjoy surprising thrillers made with an independent vein.",1041206400,,1653,4.607508532423208
1740808,3,B00006AUMZ,"It's good to see McConaughy, finally, in a film where he gets to use his considerable talent. That said, while Frailty gets off to a good (and chilling) start, I had problems with the premise and even bigger problems with the resolution. When the widower father of two young boys suddenly awakens with a mission to rid the world of demons, what ensues can only be viewed as horrific child abuse:  forcing two children not only to see their father commit axe murders but to participate in the disposal of the bodies cannot be dismissed by a surprise ending that's intended, somehow, to justify the beginning.
I couldn't buy into a lone FBI agent going off alone with the McConaughy character, without any backup, without leaving any mention of his destination. It's a quantum hole in the plot that is very hard to buy, as is the notion that a man might come into possession of a (literally) god-given gift of seeing into the souls of people both good and bad. That ""gift"" which is the core thesis of the script cannot redeem the horror that is forced upon two innocent children. I was left with the unsettling idea that I'd been sold a justification package to excuse madness decorated to look like goodness.
No amount of good acting, good editing, good cinematography can elevate this film above a gruesome reality that turns two little boys into adults who kill--for whatever reason. This is one seriously creepy movie--primarily because it attempts to offer validation for murder, as if it's okay for a possibly nutso dad to coerce his reluctant older son into participating in his ""vision."" For anyone who takes a step back and seriously considers the plot of this film, you're left with a very bad taste in the mouth.",1041033600,,1721,4.717607973421927
1740809,4,B00006AUMZ,"""Frailty"" is a very good film and the only reason I would not claim it was a great movie is because it is not quite a film that you would want to see over and over again, which I think is a key part of what makes a film great.  You should watch ""Frailty"" a second time, primarily to pay attention to how the film was put together in terms of setting up the payoff.  You will see that this is a solid little film, without any major holes, which is certainly a rare enough state of affairs with regards to movies today.
Like reviewing ""Memento"" it is hard to explain why I liked ""Frailty"" without giving away too much and spoiling your enjoyment of the film.  The script by Brent Hanley tells of a Southern gothic horror story that plays with and off of our assumptions about religious fanaticism.  This is a haunted film, both in terms of the story and the look of the film, the latter due to Bill Butler's photography.  Matthew McConaughey's character shows up at the office of Powers Booth's F.B.I. agent to say that he knows who is the serial killer called God's Hand.  Like Booth's character, we are suspicious from the first and the success of this film is based entirely on how deep in the spell of the story being told we fall.  I think most people who are fans of this genre are going to fall pretty deep.
Included in the DVD extras is a Sundance channel ""Anatomy of a Scene"" feature that provides nice in-depth analysis of a key scene from the film of the sort that you rarely get to see outside of a college film course and provides graphic evidence of Bill Butler's wonderful work with lighting.

What a shame this movie didn't get the press it so richly deserved!
A widower of two boys receives a vision one night, and he is 'tapped' by God as a destroyer of demons. He enthusiastically confides this to his two son, one of whom believes his father, the other one listens to traditional voice of reason. Because this story is so full of surprising and well-constructed plot twists, I won't rob you by revealing them. But from the moment Matthew McCoughney's catatonic trip to the police station opens the movie until the final, chilling shot...this film will hook you and you won't be the least bit sorry it did.
Another aspect of the film that was handled BRILLIANTLY is the violence. This is a violent film that shows you very little blood at all. Paxton wisely realizes that the grisliest horror often resides in our own heads, and uses that to full effect.
Paxton, in his directorial debut, manages to tell a story that could have easily fallen flat if not given the right attention. Paxton directs a complex story as if he were walking through the rose garden! I was impressed, and that's putting it mildly. Paxton would be robbing us if this is where he stops at directing.

Fenton goes on to tell Doyle (and the audience via flashbacks) that the killing spree started many years before when he and his brother were pre-teenagers. One night in the small hours, their Dad (Bill Paxton), by day a soft spoken auto mechanic, awakens them to announce that he's had a vision of God, who's given them a special mission - to kill demons. Soon, the Almighty provides the tools - a pair of work gloves, a length of metal pipe, and a double-bladed axe named ""Otis"" - and a list with the names of the first seven targets, all of whom are strangers. Adam buys into the concept, but Fenton has to be coerced into doing his part. Soon the axe starts to fall on very real human necks. Back in the present, Fenton tells Wesley that he knows where the case's missing bodies are buried. Does he want to go and see?
FRAILTY is a gripping story about that sort of obsession which compels otherwise normal people into committing horrific acts. Matthew O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter are excellent as the young Fenton and Adam respectively, and Paxton, who also directed, is chilling as the loving father who conscripts his sons into the Lord's army.
There were times when I thought FRAILTY verged on the improbable, but then said to myself, ""Well, after all, it's rural Texas"", and went with the flow. And because of a completely unexpected twist at the end, it's one of those rare films that my wife and I verbally re-ran to clarify in our minds what we just saw. This fact ranks it an intellectual step above most thrillers released to the Big Screen.
Were the victims of the Meiks trio really just normal folks like you or me? Why was the adult Fenton so pre-occupied with the photo of Agent Doyle and his mother on the former's desk? And who messed with the Bureau's surveillance cameras? Trust me, you want to see this tautly told and clever film.",1038700800,,2475,4.601809954751131
1740812,2,B00006AUMZ,"The New Testament half of the Bible has been axed in this distasteful re-creation of the film noir. Execution becomes a family business after a loving bachelor father experiences a vision. Vengence is mine, sayeth the Lord, and the grunt work is delegated to the father, who, needing help, proceeds to turn his young boys into the Blues Brothers' evil twins. They are on a ""Mission From God"" executing demons who appear in human form. Or so they think. Are they for real? Are the demons for real, or are they just ordinary people? That is the mystery which would pique our interest if only we weren't so grossed out. Retribution is messy, and a key ingredient is child abuse, we learn. It's dirty work, but somebody has to do it. In Frailty, serial killers are the true heros. Parenting and career building are wholly perverse endeavors. Whereas our kids use the computer to do their school work, the Frailty kids use an ax. Years ago, the ads for the film The Loved One said truthfully that the picture has ""something to offend everyone."" So does Frailty. Both films turn everything you take for granted about good and evil upside down. However, The Loved One works because it has a worthy purpose: satire. Frailty serves no useful purpose that I can divine. So unless you enjoy the fascination that the mouse feels as it stares paralyzed into the ravening fangs of the viper, I suggest you pass on Frailty.

I am neither the biggest Matthew McConaughey fan nor the most enthusiastic Bill Paxton viewer but this movie will shock you, terrify you and make you look at the world a little differently.

Anyone who likes a good creepy suspense, this is it.",1038009600,,453,4.6375
1740815,2,B00006AUMZ,"The problem with enjoying this film is that we have to accept that God would give a hit list to a serial killer and go around blurring video screens & hazing the memories of FBI agents to protect the killers.  This view of God is so backward, that it predates the Old Testament God of Wrath.  It's a kind of Osama Bin Laden approach to the Almighty.  Beyond obnoxious, it doesn't work.  So as a flick with any theological basis, ""Frailty"" is awful.
That said, there are still some amazing things in the film.  The best is the performance of Matthew O'Leary as the older son Fenton who sees his dad going crazy.  O'Leary also did a similarly excellent job fending off stepdad Vince Vaughn in ""Domestic Distrubance"" with John Travolta.  Here, he has so many shadings as a youth dealing with a mentally unbalanced parent, that it is a marvelous film for showing that.  We feel his uncertainty, defiance, condemnation and love for his father.
Director of photography Bill Butler does a great job with giving the film its own look.  His work on Conversation & One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest shows the class he brings to this project.  From the dark shadows of the cemetery to the shaded cellar to the light of day where we breathe a bit easier, his contribution is masterful.
Matthew McConaughey as the grown son of Bill Paxton does a great job of relating the tale in flashbacks.  Powers Boothe as the FBI agent has a nice cameo as does Luke Askew as Sherriff Smalls.  Paxton does a decent job of directing this, with great pacing that tenses and relaxes repeatedly drawing us to the film's climax.  The DVD version has interesting deleted scenes including Fenton trying to outwit his dad with Bible references.
As a cinematic experience, this was a pretty good movie.  If you are not disturbed about the implications of the nature of God the film offers, you may find it more enjoyable than I.  Taxi!",1036972800,,1898,4.5905044510385755
1740828,4,B00006AUMZ,"Frailty (Bill Paxton, 2001)
Given that Frailty is Bill Paxton's big-screen directorial debut, and his first trip behind the camera at all in almost twenty years, it's rather amazing how little press this movie actually got. The critics liked it overall, which is usually a bad sign, since the critics and the public agree on almost nothing. The advertising budget was woefully misused, and thus the film pretty much flopped when it came out (just over thirteen million on a budget of eleven). It's a shame.
Frailty is billed as a mystery, and perhaps folks who haven't seen many mystery or horror films will buy into that; for anyone who's read more than one Agatha Christie novel, though, the ""surprise"" ending will be obvious within ten or fifteen minutes of the beginning of the film. (If you haven't seen it and are planning to, avoid IMDB.com, as well; it, too, gives away the twist. Don't blame them; it's unavoidable.) And this would have been a stronger work had Paxton and scriptwriter Brent Hanley not spent so much time on the twist and spent more on the film's real subject-an examination of genetic mental illness that is far more disturbing than the mystery itself.
Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) is an FBI agent on the case of a serial killer known as God's Hands. One day, Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey) walks into Doyle's office, sits down, and says ""I know who the God's Hands killer is."" Offering proof, Meiks takes Doyle on a two and a half hour trip to where he claims the bodies are buried, and during the ride, Meiks tells Doyle how he knows that the God's Hands killer is his brother, Adam. The story he tells is the bulk of the film, told in flashback, when Fenton and Adam were much younger.
Bill Paxton stars in the flashback as the Meiks' father, and it's his best screen role since Near Dark fifteen years previous. Dad is obviously nuts (as Fenton tells him repeatedly), but Adam is very much taken in by his father's beliefs that an angel is visiting him and telling him he's supposed to kill demons in human form. All three principal players in the flashbacks (Paxton, Matthew O'Leary [Domestic Disturbance] as Fenton, and Jeremy Sumpter [Adaptation, Peter Pan] in his big-screen debut as Adam) are so convincing in their roles that after a while, the viewer starts to wonder if maybe Fenton's the one who's nuts.
Fans of the atmospheric thriller will find much to enjoy here. Paxton keeps the blood to a minimum given the subject matter (one thinks that if Boothe and one minor character hadn't each used what Jean Shepherd called ""the F dash dash dash word,"" the movie would have been solidly in PG-13 territory), and the pace is far more in tune with movies like The Others than it is with your typical Van Damme movie. And while you'll probably get the main question figured out early on, you'll find yourself with many questions about the Meiks family, and you will have them long after the film ends.

Really weird movie I would say, just the kind I like, makes you think at the end too. Also exploits the values of good and evil in all of us. Extremely good performance by Matthew McConaughey and an even better one by my old favorite Bill Paxton for whom this was his first directorial effort.

1740830,4,B00006AUMZ,"Halfway through this movie, I found myself so disheartened by the zealously horrific activities of a Texas father seen through the eyes of his two young sons, that I wondered why I had rented this video in the first place.  However, as the final moments of the denouement played out on my screen, I breathed a sigh of complete enjoyment and immense satisfaction.
Bill Paxton portrays the older Meiks with the confused yet calm grounding of a man who believes himself appointed by God to rid the world of some of its less savory characters.  The unformed sensibilities of Adam and Fenton, his two elementary-school-age sons, diversely emblemize the two states of Paxton's befuddled mind. While one becomes a true believer, the other struggles adequately between what his conscience tells him is right and what he knows he cannot deny: his unconditional love for his father.
The film is a story within a story, Matthew McConaughey relates the tale of his bizarre childhood to an FBI agent portrayed by Powers Boothe amidst the backdrop of a present day investigation of a serial killer's rampage known as ""the Hand of God"" killings.  As McConaughey's narrative reveals more and more of his father's incensed mission, Boothe's suspicions are aroused and challenged.  The audience can almost hear his mind ticking with questions as to why McConaughey has appeared in the first place. When he aggressively attempts to trap McConaughey into making a full confession of the crimes, the absolute truth of the film is disclosed with chilling clarity.
Paxton's performance is great; he plays parent and vigilante with utter seriousness while giving new meaning to questions like 'what do people do way out here in the boonies?""  The cricket-chirping country ambiance adds that frightening ""I'm-in-over-my-head"" feeling the cityslicker gets when trespassing on unknown territory where there isn't a Starbucks on every corner.  The setting, character, tone and dialogue all cleverly aid in supporting the audiences' already convinced attitudes about what is right and wrong and than masterfully acts as a buttress for just the opposite. Nicely done and entertaining to boot.",1036195200,,2162,5.198275862068965

It is not very fair and nice to reveal the plot of this movie. This is a big spoiler for everybody who wants to see it for the first time. At least mark it in your titles, that you are revealing some of the content!!!

It seems predictable at first and yet it keeps you interested. Then there is a still quite surprising twist at the end which makes it a nice and chilly picture after all. Great acting, limited gore, good filmmaking without a too big budget and therefore innovative (the special features' reel ""anatomy of a scene"" shows that). Paxton has done a very respectable job for his directing debut and so this is a nice surprise among all those lame thrillers that we have seen in the past.

I am still not sure if I liked this movie or not.
Part of me liked it but part of me didn't.
It certainly left me a bit disturbed at the end.
The movie starts off well enough. It focuses on Bill Paxton and his two sons, his wife has recently passed away and he is left to raise them. For me, Bill Paxton ranks in the Mel Gibson arena of likeability, meaning he's very likeable. The story takes place in Alabama or one of it's neighboring states and begins by showing what a straight, honest man Bill Paxton's character is.
His family seems to be very close-knit and you just want to cheer for them. All this changes one day when Bill Paxton's character sees ""an angel"" from God. The angel gives him a list of ""Demons""
that he has to destroy. When he comes home that day he tells his sons what he's heard. His younger son believes him but the older son begins to think that his father is crazy.
Throughout, this movie was genuinely captivating.
I had heard that 'Frailty' had a whopper twist at it's end and it does. Although I had guessed the conclusion long before it had unfolded. There is great acting all around with very notable performances by the two younger boys.
Nearly everything about this movie works until the last half hour,
then it all falls apart. Not only is the twist ending extremely
predictable for all who have seen the better twists in 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Others' but the ending doesn't seem to turn out right. Are these people really ""demons""?
The movie would suggest that, and that's when 'Frailty' moves from
new, unchartered territory to an ""insane"" ending that is too close to other films of it's kind. Still though, it was a lot of fun getting there.",1035590400,,1722,4.418238993710692

He enlists the aid of his two very young sons to carry off his mission.

1740859,5,B00006AUMZ,"I was absolutely spellbound the entire time this film played.  I do not ordinarily do well with films that are horror genre allied but this was the exception.  One big reason this film succeeds is that it has a story that catches hold of you and never lets go.  I found myself wondering what I would do if I were the son, Fenton, whose father embarked on an avenging angel serial killing quest and expected me to be his helper along with my smaller sibling.  There does seem to be a side issue too as to whether the father and the younger son actually have some psychic ability too so that they can actually see the ""crimes"" of their victims which make them ""demons"".  That ultimately is left to your own viewer judgement, however.

The next big reason this film works is that the acting is first rate.  Paxton is superb as the father (and the film director) who is gripped by this apocalyptic vision and quest.  The two boys playing his sons are equally great as his followers, one willing and the other unwilling.  And Matthew McConnerghy and Powers Booth bring it all home as the adults years later who are left with the aftermath of the father's legacy.

1740860,4,B00006AUMZ,"Directorial debuts by actors are always received with a certain amount of skepticism.  However, when Bill Paxton's 'Frailty' was released it was awash with praise from such prestigious sources as James Cameron (who worked with Paxton on 'Aliens' and 'Titanic'), Sam Raimi and Stephen King.  And to an extent this is rightly so.  Paxton has produced an effectively put together, suspense-filled horror movie that marks itself from the rest of the batch of scary films flooding the market right now.
The premise has Paxton as an ordinary guy that believes he has heard a message from God to go out an kill 'demons' with an axe.  Taking his sons along for the ride he tells them that such demons look like ordinary people but they're not.  And so the death toll mounts up, with one of his sons being a great deal more skeptical than the other.  Fast forward to the present day and we have Matthew McConaughey telling the detective in charge of investigating the God's hand murders why he believes it's his brother committing the crimes, thus unravelling his own knotted childhood in the process.
What's most impressive about this film is that it is actually quite disturbing, something that is certainly praise-worthy given that you don't actually see any of the murders (a wise decision, given the recent proneness to blood and gore).  Paxton understands that the most disturbing aspects of the story aren't the crimes themselves but the gradual corruption of the two children in the story and the juxtaposition of what the family does at night with their humdrum existence watching TV or eating family meals together (even if there is one murder scene in particular that will make you jump out of your skin).  However, it is the immensely assured and matured performance from Matthew O'Leary as Paxton's son, Fenton, that provides the emotional centrepiece of the entire movie.  Managing to convey fear, love and loathing all at the same time puts him in the Haley Joel Osmont category of child acting and if his work on 'Frailty' is anything to go by, he's destined for greater things.
Given this, it's a real shame that the twist at the end is so obvious and that the action that takes place in the present day is too muddled and confused to provide any kind of real climax.  Still, kudos should definitely be awarded for not only a very impressive directorial debut but also a great performance from Paxton, and a story that really sets you on edge.  This is probably the best horror film of the year so far, especially given the fact that Paxton didn't feel a need to overpopulate his screen with hormonal teenagers and excessive violence.

The ambiguous ending will not answer that question for you, rather, instead it will allow you to draw your own conclusions. It's a powerful directorial debut by Bill Paxson, who is also great in the role as the father. There is hardly any gore. Much of the violence that takes place is off camera. Yet the horror is even worse than if you would have seen it. Just the anticipation and the facial expressions of the children will cause you to cover your eyes.

I'm sure many of you have read the other reviews, so I won't repeat what's already been said, but this is a movie that is a definite classic and will hopefully be re-released at full length.

I've recently been going over the whole genre on film with notables like 'The Exorcist - The version you've never seen', 'From Hell' and 'Near Dark' (another Bill Paxton masterpiece), `Frailty' is quite possibly the Exorcist of this decade. I say this for the following reasons:

1. As dark as the movie was and shocking in places, after listening to the writer's commentary and Paxton's commentary (something I've never done before), they actually cut a lot of footage out that might have sent it to the outer bounds of Film Noir, which is actually something I would've liked to have seen, but was cut for the concern of it being ""too shocking."" A movie that's too shocking?, wow! The commentaries are excellent and well worth the multiple viewings and give so much insight to this movie that it's astounding.

2. The responsibility of thinking is placed in the viewers lap and is not drawn out for you as though you were a simpleton and couldn't grasp basic moral and story / plot concepts, I really appreciated this. It's very evident in watching Fenton become more and more like a demon.

3. The narration by Matthew McConaughey is very worthy, unlike many other film narrations.

4. Bill Paxton's characterization of the 'Texas father' is dead on. It's jaw dropping to watch him carry on like that. Anybody that knows a Father from Texas, as I have, knows this to be true.

I seriously recommend this movie for purchase if you want to watch it more than once. If you're a writer and like good study material - this is it.",1033603200,,1924,4.530259365994237

It reminds me of two other very fine independent movies about the possible nature of God - ""Eye of God"" [1997] and, especially, ""The Rapture"" [1991].
On a dark, rainy night, a Dallas FBI agent [Powers Boothe] arrives at work to find an enigmatic young man [Matthew McConaughey] in his office. The man, who says his name is Fenton Meeks, claims that his brother, Adam, is the `Hand of God' serial killer. Though skeptical, the agent lets Fenton tell his tale - one of horror, madness and murder dating back more than twenty years. It begins when his father [Bill Paxton] tells the boys that God has come him in a vision and told him to rid the world of certain people because they were demons. The boys are to help him.
At first the story sounds too ludicrous to be believed. How could such things happen in a small Texas town without anyone's finding out? Why couldn't Fenton simply tell someone or run away? In the end, though, all is explained in an ending as fantastical but as logical within the framework of the story as the ending of ""The Sixth Sense"".
Paxton, McConaughey and Boothe give fine performances, but it is 12-year old Jeremy Spencer, as young Adam, who shines. The movie revolves around him and might have fallen apart in the hands of a less talented actor.
""Frailty"" is creepy, unsettling but very well made. Best not viewed on a dark and rainy night.",1033257600,,1781,4.586206896551724
1740866,5,B00006AUMZ,"In a word - Amazing.  This movie completely blew me away.  I was so excited about seeing this movie and it lived up to and surpassed every expection I had.  I work in a video store so I was able to take it home before its release date.  I watched the movie and it took forever for me to go to sleep.  I wasn't too scared to sleep, I was too pumped up and restless.  I just kept going over the plot and story in my head over and over again.  I wanted to wake up my wife and tell her about it.  I just had to talk to someone.
This movie works on so many different levels.  It challenges your mind with thoughts of faith in religion and with your moral beliefs.  It was a brilliant murder mystery and it adds strong horror elements without being very graphic. It is also very darkly humoured.  One of the deleted scenes is a prime example of the humour.  It was good that it was deleted from the movie for pacing's sake, but I'm glad I got to see it.
At this time, I could go into a summary of the movie.  But if you're taking the time to read this review I would assume you are already aware of what the movie is about.  And I'd be afraid of giving too much away.  I want people to see this movie based on my excitement for it only.
I watched this movie three times that first weekend.  Once for real and then twice with different commentaries.  I highly recommend doing so as well.
The movie is filled with great performances all round and many twists and surprises.  It is a very impressive directorial debut for Bill Paxton.  I hope he continues to direct. I could go on for ever, but I'm gonna end things here.  Thank you for taking the time to read my review.",1033171200,,1662,4.086687306501548

With the help of his younger son Adam goes along and kills them. His Older son Fenton thinks he's crazy and doesn't believe there's a God and doesn't believe there are any demons. The movie will leave you full of suspese til the end. Filled with losts of horror that will leave you on the edge of your seat and chills running up your back.

The ending of this movie is so unexpected the way it turns out. So do yourself a favor and go rent this, no, better yet go out and buy it because it's worth it.",1032998400,,511,3.7850467289719627

1740892,4,B00006AUMZ,"Frailty is a frightening film about a man's fall into religious fanaticism, and the devastation it causes for his children later in life.
Bill Paxton plays the father of two young boys who one day believes an angel tells him the end of the world is coming, and he has to destroy demons in the disguise of humans. He enlists the help of his sons and goes on a killing spree.
Scary? Yes, especially in this day and age of extreme cultists. This kind of thing happens in our world, and Frailty takes us right into the disturbing heart of the matter.
Though this film isn't perfect, it still provides an excellent, chilling story. The acting is well done, in particular the young actor playing the eldest son Fenton. He skillfully plays a boy caught in the midst of his father's delusions and not wanting any part in it.
Frailty made two major mistakes though. One is during the first half of the film, narration of one of the sons as an adult is so prevalent it becomes annoying. Most of the scenes can speak for themselves, and it ruins much of the natural tension. Fortunately the narration becomes more intermittent as the film progressives, and helps rather then hurts the film. Also, the ending builds up to become very ambiguous, then makes the truth more obvious in the final moments, ruining much of the terror the film could have left its audience with. Sometimes not being sure about something is more frightening then knowing the truth.
But despite these flaws, Frailty is an excellent film any suspense or horror film love will embrace. It leaves you guessing what happens next; hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. Frailty is a great debut from director Bill Paxton. This one promises more good things from him in the future. But this film isn't for the weak at heart. Check it out if you dare!",1032652800,,1816,4.590769230769231
1740893,5,B00006AUMZ,"Bill Paxton must've been really thinking smart when he decided to direct this high-octane chill-ride from start to finish. FRAILTY is a major success for Paxton on all levels, and his role in the movie is every bit as important. His chilling lines and his more-than-frightening atmosphere really keep you on the edge of your seat. Although the pace of the movie is a bit slow at times, Paxton and other stars like Matt O'Leary and Matthew McConaughey provide excellent roles and really manage to shine bright. The scenes where the supposed ""demons"" are disposed of are truly frightening, without having to show any blood, guts, or gore. And one particular scene involving Matthew McConaughey and the detective will truly make you jump (let's just say the ""ax"" is chilling in this scene). This movie has thrills, chills, and all the right ingredients for a scary movie...and succeeds quite well.
Bill Paxton was smart to make FRAILTY. Critically acclaimed and hailed by many who went to see it, myself included, this DVD movie is worth the purchase and worth the ultimate attention. If you watch this movie before bedtime, you might not want to go to sleep right away...it's just that scary. And for more reasons than one can think, that's exactly why Paxton, McConaughey, and FRAILTY shine. A brilliant movie, and a solid director debut for Bill Paxton. Two thumbs up...WAY UP!",1032566400,,1377,4.914163090128755
1740894,1,B00006AUMZ,"Bill Paxton appears to be constipated as he attempts to act.  He is not fluid nor is he believable.  He's got to be the worst working actor in the business (except for perhaps Adam Sandler).  You just want to shake him or something everytime he speaks.  And as far as his directing - nothing special at all.
For the movie itself - convoluted plot, pointless in meaning, and very laughable.",1032480000,,389,4.514285714285714
1740895,5,B00006AUMZ,"Yes!  Finally, it is here on DVD!  I could not wait to purchase it!
""Frailty"" is a dark and terrifying film that surprised me so many times. Just when I thought I knew what was going on, the next scene would prove me wrong. The complexity and creativeness that went into this film is so mind-blowing.  It takes risks, and forces us to ask questions that are better left unanswered.
A series of murders has been contaminating a small town. The case is known as the ""God's Hand"". The movie starts with McConaughey entering the FBI station, claiming that he knows who the ""God's Hand"" killer is. With this, he tells his story and we witness shocking flashbacks to when he was a kid.
Paxton, who is also the director, stars as a very religious and loving father. His two sons, (remember, this is all McConaughey's story, so this entire part is the flashback) mean all the world to him. Everything seems perfect, until Paxton awakes his sons, telling him that an angel visited him at night, telling him that there were demons lurking around and they took the form of human-beings. He instructs his sons that they must ""destroy"" them. (Meaning, ""killing."") The oldest son thinks his father has lost it, but he has no idea how far things are about to go. I cannot tell you anymore, otherwise it'll ruin the movie for you. Know this, however, you will be shocked, and you will feel disturbed when it is all said and done.
Bill Paxton does an outstanding job as a first time director. This is the type of movie that really requires talent from famous and acclaimed directors, but Paxton proves to us that not only can he act, but he can direct. Every shot in the movie is very well planned and laid out. He also proves exactly what kinds of emotions he wants his actors to show us. That task, I'm sure, is not a very easy one.  The acting was really impressive, and must've been quite a chore to accomplish in this type of film.  It is the direction and the acting that makes this movie so unique and chilling.
Yes, this film is very disturbing and very violent. Not in graphic detail; there's hardly any blood or gore. It's just the overall idea and the way the ""destruction of the demons"" are presented to us. Be warned; this is not for people with weak hearts or stomaches.
This movie still shocked and frightened me, even seeing it for the second time.  Even though I knew exactly what was going to happen, I still felt very uneasy and disturbed, as if I were just experiencing it for the first time.
Now, on to the DVD.  For it being an independent film, it has some pretty neat features, including commentary, a making of feature, theatrical trailer, and more.  The picture and sound quality was also very good.
This movie isn't for everybody, especially if you are the really religous type who get offended easily.  This movie IS NOT FOR YOU!  Don't even attempt it!  If you can handle dark and terrifying thrillers, than chances are you will enjoy this film.  All in all, ""Frailty"" is gut-wrenching, dark and twisted thriller that will keep you guessing until the very end.  And even after it's all over, this movie will still be on your mind.
Want to try something fun?  Watch this movie really LATE.  Right before bedtime.  See if you can get a goodnight's sleep after that.",1032480000,,3275,4.516074450084602
1740896,5,B00006AUMZ,"This one has something to satisfy everyone. If you're looking for truly creepy, spooky events, you won't be dissappointed. But if you also like movies that aren't predictable and make you think, really think, about issues of faith and belief, this is also the movie for you.
  While I'm not a huge fan of horror movies, this isn't really a typical horror movie -although I've heard it described as one. Instead, it has more to do with commitment to one's beliefs, even if following them means murder.
  Bill Paxton is believable as a father who suddenly has a vision from God who gives him a list of demons to kill ( demons who are disguised as people living ordinary lives). When he tells his two young sons this, one of them, Fenton, is sceptical and, understandably, fears his father is going crazy. The other son is an instant believer.
  From this beginning, the movie veers off in different directions, all of them fascinating. I thought could see the twists in this one coming but I was wrong. I'd say more but I think you should discover the special pleasures of this movie yourself. It isn't always an easy ride (I had to turn my face from the screen several times) but it is well worth the trip.",1032480000,,1205,4.529953917050691

1740918,4,B00006AUMZ,"FRAILTY escaped audience attention when in the theaters, probably because of the critical scrutiny of the fundamentalist religious Right, the content of the story line, and the overall repulsion of the story.  But it is these very excuses that make this film exceptional in quality when it is viewed in the privacy of the home on DVD.  The story relates the thin line between sanity and insanity, between faith and the over-the-edge messages from the messengers of God about the encroaching Millennium, and the viscerally tough distinction between parent/child love and induction of madness.  Blessed with a fine ensemble cast that includes actor/director Bill Paxton in an amazingly understated role of a man mired progressively deeper into insanity, Matthew McConaughey as the narrator of this twisted tale of multiple murders, Powers Booth as the FBI agent investigating the confession of McConaughey's character, and excellent young actors in the pivotal roles of the victimized sons.  Paxton and his lighting director and editor have elected to keep a suffocatingly bland surface on which to paint this macabre tale, a technique which leads the viewer to be more sympathetic to the range of the characters affected by this God's Hand trail of mayhem.  The murders are graphic only in the eyes of the victims and the perpetrators which increases the grisly effect of what is being done before our eyes.  The only flaws in this fine little film are the somewhat wooden script and the over the edge musical score that is unrelenting in its morbid atmosphere.  A surprise for film lovers........but be warned that this story may offend some religious minds.",1032393600,,1658,5.141263940520446

This is one disturbing movie, folks. It aims to creep you out, and it delivers on all sides The story was intriguing, the mood was devastatingly eerie, the transition between the family's early days together and its eventual path was well handled, the psychological effects on the kids was credible, and the scenes in which certain people were murdered, were also quite shocking
 But I have to say that what really kept me into this movie was the relationship between the father and his sons. This flick could've been blown off if this connection had not been played out with tangible credibility or love behind it, but Paxton does a great job, as both an actor and director, of giving the audience a true sense of the father's struggle between the love for his sons and his apparent ""mission from God"".

He tells them that the angel said to him that he was chosen to destroy demons that would look like ordinary people. Fenton is the only boy who is against it and very disturbed by the fact that his dad is murdering people. This film was actually directed by Bill himself and he did a terrific job at it too.

While I never thought of the late Bill Paxton as the greatest actor of our time, I have always liked the roles he has played in every one of his films and this one reminds me of how much he'll be missed in the coming years. It's also a very interesting film to look back on and see Matthew McConaughey at an earlier era in his career and while there are times I tire of him these days, earlier roles such as this one bring back why he has been so popular and make me once again a fan (""well Alright, Alright....""). This film also achieves somewhat of a timeless feel that not all films end up earning so it's worth noting for that as well. Overall this is a true favorite of mine, almost a comfort film that one can rely on to take you out of the present time and put you fully into the plot.
