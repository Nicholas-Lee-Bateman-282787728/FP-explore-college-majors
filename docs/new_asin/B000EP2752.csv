8112428,5,B000EP2752,"I really loved getting this DVD, was a super reminder of all the cool places I've been fortunate enough to visit.  One extra good thing about this video is that it takes you to some out-of-the-way places that are just as amazing as the high-profile destinations.  If you want to get a great flavor for the Four Corners region and see some awesome places ""off the beaten path"" buy this DVD, you'll probably love it too.",1376352000,,418,4.4868421052631575
8112429,5,B000EP2752,"the only negative thing is that ""they"" told me that there was a sort of code to download a iPhone/Pad file to use on my trip but I did not find that I needed a computer to download the second disk",1374710400,,196,3.8048780487804876
8112430,5,B000EP2752,We visited the Southwest last October and did the Grand Circle.  This video was like reliving every moment of that trip.  The quality was outstanding and all the most important features were covered.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone planning to visit this area and anyone wanting to remember every moment of their trip.,1363392000,,324,4.8545454545454545
8112431,5,B000EP2752,"I am currently planning a future  trip to Las Vegas with two weeks touring the Grand Circle region and this Blu-ray is very timely.
There is an incredible amount of amazing scenery crammed into a relatively small region and to do it justice, you would either need many weeks at your disposal or would need to live there.

The HD photography brings the region to life in this film and there is just enough time spent on each subject to whet the appetite and give you itchy feet. Most people will only have limited time in these places and what you see in this film is a good example of what there is to see on a short visit.

As with all the Blu-ray films I have seen from Finley-Holiday, the production is of high quality and this is very enjoyable and relaxing to watch. This is indeed a grand DVD on the Grand Circle and I thoroughly recommend it.",1344902400,,849,4.29375
8112432,5,B000EP2752,"I really like Finley-Holiday's National Park series, but I was expecting this to be a bit of a rehash.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that there seemed to be very little reused footage from the individual park videos.  More importantly, this video covers much, much more than just the major national parks in the Grand Circle.  Quite a few state parks, especially in southern Utah, were included.  If you're planning a trip to the Southwest, this would be a very good planning tool.

As with all the F-H videos I've watched, the footage and video quality were great.  My only complaint was that the narration seemed a bit rushed at times - probably because they were trying to fit so much in.

I ordered directly from the Finley-Holiday website and had no difficulty receiving my order.",1333065600,6,791,4.7299270072992705
