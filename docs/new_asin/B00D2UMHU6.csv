5769061,5,B00D2UMHU6,I used to do Tae Bo tapes (ha ha tapes!) back in college and loved them because every muscle got a workout then I got away from Tae Bo because I felt like there was too much instruction and not enough doing with subsequent videos. I have come back to Tae Bo and this is my first DVD since doing them in college and wow! I loved it! I like that he does a couple of sets for each exer at a slow pace to get the combination then amps it up for a cardio blast.  The pace is quick which I like cause I get bored easily during videos. If you are an avid Tae Bo user then this might be more of the same for you as I have read on other reviews but if you're looking to add in a cardio video to your rotation this is a great one!  I couldn't finish it the first time.  The only thing that is annoying is the counting which can be distracting at times esp if you did this video everyday.,1391817600,,877,3.8076923076923075
5769062,5,B00D2UMHU6,"I love Taebo and find the DVDs I have to be effective, even enjoyable sometimes. I know some of his workouts are a little easy, but most of what I have is good. This has to be the best Taebo cardio based DVD I've tried. I haven't tried them all, but I think he got it right with this one. It gets your heart rate up like it's supposed to, there's less standing around and talking, and he does both sides of the body unlike some of his past workouts. I'm kind of proud of him for stepping up his game. Billy Blanks delivers in this one. Great job!",1390694400,,546,4.018348623853211
5769063,5,B00D2UMHU6,I gave this as a gift to my sister who is in great shape since she works out regularly. She says she loves it and It was even challenging for her!!,1390262400,,147,3.774193548387097
5769064,5,B00D2UMHU6,"it has great combinations, and as all Billy Blanks Videos its very motivating. great for my fitness purposes. Billy Rocks",1389916800,,121,5.1
5769065,4,B00D2UMHU6,"Judging an exercise workout is an extremely subjective activity.  One morning I will jump out of bed and be totally in the groove and the workout is fantastic--my adrenaline moves it along despite any deficiencies.  On other mornings--just the opposite:  my energy takes more time to activate and when Billy stops the action to talk or motivate, the effort is lost on me.  When my enthusiasm is low or I simply haven't fully awakened--I don't want to do extreme moves like jumping or kickbacks.  During these moments, the workout becomes tedious and I have to fill in for myself--running in place or modifying the exercise to make it work for me.  Unfortunately, having to think to much, simply doesn't always mean an optimal workout.  With all this in mind, I will review this workout from the perspective of a veteran Tae Bo participant on a ""good"" energetic day.

""Billy Blanks: Tae Bo Max Intensity"" could have been disappointing to this long-term Tae Bo exerciser.  I say this because, nothing has compared to Billy's original Tae Bo Live Advanced series that consisted of twelve different sixty minute sessions with good music, floor work and consistent momentum without a lot of ""motivational"" breaks.  Tae Bo Max Intensity keeps moving and when Billy lingers in his pauses to start a new sequence, the action is intense enough in the moments beforehand to warrant a few deep breaths without feeling that your heart rate is waning.

Winter in New Orleans can be cold, dreary and just plain bone-chilling making outdoor exercise less than optimal.  I try not to put the heat on too often--I hate dried up sinuses.  This workout is the best thing to do to kickstart the body first thing in the AM. The warm-up in cold weather is slower and extremely enjoyable as it reaches a sweat stage.

Like many of Billy Blanks' recent DVDs, this workout lasts for almost sixty minutes and includes the usual warm-up and cool down of stretches and tai chi breathing moves. The actual cardio is fairly fast-paced with stirring electronic music recycled from one of his other recent DVDs.  For the most part the workout has a few slow ""learning"" moves and then the more intense ""cardio"" portion of the same move, amped up at about 3 times the original pace.  However, once Billy rushes out of the warm-up gate, the movement doesn't really stop until the tail end of the cardio segment.

Billy includes more jumping and sliding movements in this workout than usual. I work out on a slab, so these moves are less than perfect for my situation and I find that I must modify in order to save my joints from the pain and damage that could ensue.  Instead of these ""jumps"" and ""kickbacks,"" I would prefer floor work that includes butt work and push-ups--my personal nemesis.  When Billy slides, I pick up my knees and attempt to keep up with the beat rather than have my shoes catch on a hard floor.

As always, Billy continues to be fun and motivational.  If you like his personality and his workout ethic, you cannot fail to enjoy watching him work out with his posse.

Bottom line?  ""Tae Bo: Max Intensity"" is a good workout that might challenge veteran Tae Bo exercisers because of it keeps the action going.  Jumping and sliding moves that don't work for those of us who do not work out on a padded or raised floor might change the momentum a bit.

Billy Blanks, TaeBo, Push Your Limits</a>&nbsp;presents another even workout using a step to increase cardio with weights.  As much as I appreciate Billy's additional ""Intensity"" moves that compete with newer ""Insanity"" workouts, I simply do not have the facility to incorporate them into my workout.  For me adhering to a program with more cardio and smoother transition Tae Bo moves is the key.  Recommended.

5769066,5,B00D2UMHU6,I have been doing Tae Bo on and off for some time now and I love Billy.  This workout will definitely make you sweat!  I've done the Insanity workout and lived to tell the tale!  It's not as intense as Insanity but it's close enough that you will be a little sore the next day. It's fast pace with a few low intensity spots. It has some old moves and some new moves all rolled into on.  I highly recommend.  It's a great cardio workout!!,1383004800,5,437,4.094117647058823

5769068,3,B00D2UMHU6,"You will get a great workout with this DVD.  Although for those that have done a lot of his DVD's, nothing is new with the movements and you may get bored.  The combinations get a little stale. I think at some point he should just hang up the boxing shorts because it feels like the last three or four of his releases (approx. 2010 to present) are more of the same.  One benefit to this is that there are almost no breaks, and for most of his stuff you slow down a couple of times to catch breath, but  NOT here!  This is true maximum intensity.  For those with knee issues, beware, there are lots of jumps and squats so be prepared to modify.  He never stretches enough at the end --EVER in any releases.  The Tai Chi-esque cool-downs are good but after 50 minutes of pouring sweat, some deeper, longer, choreographed stretch sequences would be good - and would he stop picking on poor Eli already!?",1379289600,9,900,4.347305389221557

5769080,5,B00D2UMHU6,"A 700 calorie burn is always great in my book! The moves are familiar to other tae bo workouts and there seems to be less recovery time in between the ""kicking it up a notch"" pace. It was challenging and has a bit more jumping moves (burpees and high knee jumps) but if you have done other tae bos in the past, you can do this.",1453334400,,327,3.9696969696969697
5769081,5,B00D2UMHU6,This workout is intense so be prepared to sweat and have your breath taking away! I'm glad I decided to order this dvd.,1442707200,,119,4.217391304347826
5769082,5,B00D2UMHU6,"I had bought the Tae Bo Platinum collection that contained 4 of his workouts. This workout was on it...and it is by far one of my favorites from him so far. I love it because it's actually harder than normal. There are more intense cardio moves, and it feel like your heart is going to explode out of your chest. I actually have to take tiny breaks in between because I get so worn out, and that's a lot for me because I have exercised for years. Anyways, I'd HIGHLY recommend this for cardio. You will literally BLAST and MELT fat from your body. It's so good. It will give your heart the workout of it's life. Thanks Mr. Blanks.",1434672000,,630,4.258333333333334

5769087,5,B00D2UMHU6,"I admit that I  was disappointed with the Tae bo Classic DVD and a few other Billy Blanks DVDs, because I felt it wasn't challenging enough.  But this workout is awesome!  I love it!  I'm in good shape and work out every day, so I'm always looking for a new work out to keep myself from getting bored.  I've done the Insanity workouts and while they are very challenging, I ended up with my clothes getting tight because of the muscle that I'd built up.  This workout is great!  Billy does different kick-punch combos that he doesn't do in the other workouts and it's long enough to feel like I got my heart rate up.  If you don't work up a sweat from this work out, you're the most fit person in the universe or you simply aren't working hard enough and just going through the motions!  Yeah, the counting is monotonous, but I find myself either ignoring it or actually counting along with them.  I've done it about 5 days now and it doesn't bother me anymore.  I hope that Billy continues to produce more DVD's in the future that are comparable, because if they are like this, I'll be buying them!",1418860800,,1099,4.364532019704433

5769109,5,B00D2UMHU6,"Today is my third day of doing this work out. It it Tae Bo at it's finest! First, I like billy's outfit ( coz Lord knows I HATE his wardrobe - very distracting ).

This Video is full of moves after moves after moves.....The dvd is 60 minutes long, but the actual workout is 57 intense minutes. 3 minutes of cool down at the end, about 4 minutes of warm up at the beginning, but the warm up starts off upbeat too.

Billy doesn't do a lot of talking in this one, he's a bit distracted by his gloves some where in the middle. A lot of the typical moves, and a couple of new ones, some challenging and awkward but after 3 days, am getting used to them.
If your are a beginner, don't even try, if u are a tae bo addict like me, this one will challenge you, you'll sweat calories, you will be sore for days. I love it!",1410393600,3,812,3.9754601226993866

5769117,5,B00D2UMHU6,"I have been working out to Billy for almost 10yrs. I have many of his DVD's so of course I have my favorites. I get rid of the ones I don't like. I would not recommend this DVD if you're new to Tae Bo. If you've done Tae Bo before then I highly recommend it. It's a pretty intense cardio workout. Some of the moves are a little complicated but I've learned that the more I do it, the better I get. Instead of just pulling knees up to work your stomach he has you sliding across the floor while raising knee. Well I don't have the space or the ability to do it. I'm just too clumsy. lol There is one move on this one that I will NOT do since I pulled my back muscles last year doing it. So I just do jumping jacks instead. (Took 5 months before I was completely healed). Billy does less talk and more action with Max Intensity. I hate when I'm just marching in place while he talks. He does give a speach during cool down. He is quicker going in to the exercises. That's why I say don't get this one if you're new to Tae Bo. I am very pleased that Billy goes straight from one exercise to another one. He's pretty good about doing both sides. There's one exercise move, at the end, that he does not do the other side, but I will improvise next time so both sides get worked out. This DVD is definitely less talk, more action. 60 minutes of action. I won't do this one everyday, but will rotate it with my others.",1400716800,,1411,4.042857142857143
5769118,5,B00D2UMHU6,This is old-school Billy Blanks with a contemporary feel.  It is a great cardio workout that keeps you moving from start to finish.  Billy does not waste time talking in this one.  This workout has burpees and lots of jumping in addition to some of his classic Tae Bo exercises.  I felt a sense of accomplishment at the end.,1394323200,2,324,4.440677966101695

8588753,2,B00D2UMHU6,Not what I was hoping for. It was basically an over-extended warm up. By the last 10 minutes I was so bored. My heart rate only picked up a couple times throughout the workout but slowed right back down like I was just taking a stroll. I was so disappointed. Billy Blanks is great though. He loves what he does and wants to help people get healthy. Beginners may find this challenging.,1484870400,,385,4.361111111111111
8588754,3,B00D2UMHU6,"You should definitely have a few other Tae Bos under your belt before you try this one. I mean, I did, and I still wasn't ready; he doesn't mess around in this one. Very little time to learn the moves compared to his other DVDs, and moves from one move to the next without any real warning. Lucky for me, almost all of them were moves he covered in his other videos.",1481241600,,366,4.097222222222222
8588755,5,B00D2UMHU6,Great workout from Billy.....takes familiar moves to a higher level of intensity and he keeps you moving through the whole workout.
