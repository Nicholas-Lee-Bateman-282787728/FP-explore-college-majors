In the Garden Of Eden, the eating of the forbidden fruit, and Adam can't live without Eve, his true love. Being banished from the Garden of Eden, Adam looks to Lucifer to fulfill his promise and grant them the secret knowledge of the trees.",1242000000,19,417,4.473684210526316
3010171,4,B000Y01X9I,"THE ANNUNCIATION sends twelve-year-old Adam on an existential odyssey through time and space. He becomes a general in Athens, a crusader in Byzantium, Danton during the French Revolution, and a witness to plague and poverty in London. As guided by a deceptively sweet, ultimately contemptuous Lucifer, Adam confronts an endless procession of rapists and concubines, betrayal and savagery, mindless cruelty and fanaticism. Superbly photographed, colorfully costumed and stunningly acted, THE ANNUNCIATION makes Pasolini-like use of its youthful cast to illustrate the horror and irrationality of our times.

Viewers beware there is a lot of nudity in this movie (most of it is during the first part and towards the end). The choice for Eve was right on and she and Adam did a fine acting job. As a matter of fact, many of the child actors put on great performances.",1224806400,52,864,5.171428571428572

For child actors in their first film they did the best that they could but you can't expect quality if the script is written horrible.  I would still recommend it for people who like foreign films though.",1213401600,10,292,4.596153846153846
3010173,5,B000Y01X9I,"THE ANNUNCIATION

(Hungary, 1984) Director: Andras Jeles. Cast: Peter Boscor, Julia Mero, Eszter Gyalog. Color. In Hungarian with English subtitles. Running time: 101 Minutes. Unrated. Incidental nudity.

Photographed against the breathtaking fields, forests, steppes and shores of southern Hungary, THE ANNUNCIATION sends 12-year-old, dark-haired Adam on an existential odyssey through time and space. He becomes a general in Athens, presiding over the trial of a traitorous soldier. He is a crusader in Byzantium, Danton during the French Revolution, and a witness to plague and poverty in London. As guided by a deceptively sweet, ultimately contemptuous blond-haired Lucifer, Adam confronts an endless procession of betrayal and savagery, rapists and concubines, mindless cruelty and fanaticism. A grandiose painting in motion, THE ANNUNCIATION is superbly photographed, colorfully costumed and stunningly acted. Each child is lovingly framed and recorded with Sandor Kardos' lush cinematography. By no means a ""school play"" on film, these exquisitely beautiful young actors sing heartrending arias, murmur hypnotic chants and speak their sophisticated parts with the utmost earnestness and candor. Jeles' young protagonists tremble against the cold, whisper, beg and bleed, struggle and cryout, make war, execute their traitors and die. THE ANNUNCIATION's unique dramatic narrative hammers home its dark sardonic observations on humanity, subtly illuminating the innate eroticism of Jeles' subjects. A unique and intense offering, THE ANNUNCIATION is perhaps Award Films' most remarkable find yet.",1155945600,3,1602,6.052863436123348

8230366,1,B000Y01X9I,now who will spend this much on 1 DVD.  I will like to buy this movie but hundreds for 1 DVD now come on.  To much.,1330560000,,115,3.3846153846153846
8230367,3,B000Y01X9I,"The IDEA had merit but it took too much energy to follow.  ALL of the young actors played out their part well but it felt too much like ""theater"" on film (DVD).  If this were on ""stage"" it probably would have done very well, but for film, it lacked Quality in Picture and overall Story.  It started and ended well but the middle was, like.... HUH???",1307145600,2,349,4.257575757575758
8230368,3,B000Y01X9I,"I bought this film mainly for the Biblical message.  For that it was fairly well done.  It went along with the Bible for the most part but some of the acts were very difficult to make out what Bible story they were trying to portray.  The filming is terrable, shaky camera work and most of the film is slightly out of focus.  There are no adults in the movie, only child actors, which makes the film more innocent in nature.  After all we all come to God as a child.  That is scriptural.  All of the children do an excelent job of acting. There is child nudity in the film briefly at the beginning and the end.  Although the nudity is tasteful and fits the part of Adam and Eve.  The ending is the best, where Satan finds out that he has not seperated God from man and he apears upset about it. Rightfully he should be.  I gave the rating as 3 stars mainly due to the camera work.  I know it was low budget but that could have been done better.",1284854400,7,944,4.103825136612022
8230369,4,B000Y01X9I,"Have you ever one of those dreams where everyone was acting very strange, or doing unnormal things for no reason but it all makes since to them, than you turn your head and look back and everyone is doing something different or the group of people are gone and new people are there doing something totaly different. Or have you ever tried to run in a dream, feels like your running in place and getting no where, no matter how hard you try running in a dream never works.

Now to include all this into a movie is good but to have all the people in the movie being under the age of 18, now that really impressed me! This movie has the best dream sequence I have ever seen in any movies.

The warning about movie is there is nudity in it but some of it made since to me, acording to story adam and eve were nude in the garden of eden so to make them nude in the garden made the movie come more alive to me.

The things I either didn't get or didn't like was I didn't understand why all the people in this movie were kids, either it's to show that were all kids in the eyes of God or it's because the creator of this movie enjoyed kids. The second was I didn't understand why they were nude in the final part of the movie, I could understand it in the garden of eden but the story says they were ashamned of their nudity after that and covered up. I thought it was going a little over board on the nudity. Thes things are why it got 4 stars and not 5

Overall this was a very good movie and was well acted and I am happy to own it.",1260748800,6,1528,3.96742671009772
8230370,1,B000Y01X9I,"Having read the other reviews I was intruiged enough to watch this movie. Honestly, it was terrible. The film is sub-titled and the language was stilted and hard to believe. The film was almost impossible to follow. I find it hard to believe that anyone could say that there was suberb acting by the cast, mostly they stood around and talked phycho-babble. As I have said in my title, please save your money.",1256860800,5,408,4.602739726027397
8230371,5,B000Y01X9I,"Andras Jeles stunning and beautiful film is an unforgettable experience. The entire youthful cast in The Annunciation is fantastic. The cinematography is wonderful, this is a true gem. It's brilliantly directed with spectacular scenery from southern Hungary.",1254787200,21,258,6.0
