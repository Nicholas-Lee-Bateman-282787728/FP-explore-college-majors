8541977,4,B009INALD6,"Beautiful views of Israel mostly from a helicopter or private plane.  DVD did not focus on specific sites with close-up pictures, but an interesting look at the overall land.  Enjoyed the interview with the maker of the DVD at the end of the movie.  Liked the fact that the take on Israel, its past, present, and future are from a Biblical standpoint.",1444694400,,351,4.629032258064516
8541978,5,B009INALD6,"I was blessed to have toured Israel twice. I plan to give the DVD to a friend because of the unique perspective of the creator.  There are a multitude of ""travel films""with views of places and explanations with Bible quotes.
I concure with the reviewer who finds the montage of aerial views satisfying and fulfilling. This film is an "" experience"".  With all films of Israel I feel a connection with places I have actually been.  But watching ""Israel, my home"" I feel the author's sense of HOME.",1434153600,,495,4.6022727272727275

8541982,5,B009INALD6,"My husband and I watched this DVD last night and really enjoyed it. It was very interesting and we loved things about Israel we never knew before. We are traveling with our church to Israel this October and feel that this DVD has helped me to organize my thoughts and my minds-eye view of locations to see while on our trip. We are very excited to go to Israel for the first time to see first hand where our Jesus walked, taught, and performed miracles!",1369094400,2,453,4.341176470588235
