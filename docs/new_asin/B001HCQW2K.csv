Functionality during playback is very poor, you can't skip chapters without returning to menu, DVD will not play through w/o returning to menu at the end of each segment, etc. Information is mediocre (2-star) at best, but crummy production and a complete lack of functionality of the DVD killed any modest usefulness that might have been present. If you're on Amazon, you obviously have internet service. Go watch YouTube videos, instead. They're free, and you'll get a better product, if you click around a little bit. This, coming from a guy who HATES YouTube!!!",1445212800,,660,5.009090909090909
8308700,1,B001HCQW2K,"Save your money- this DVD is nearly useless. Get a manual for your unit, take your boat out, and play with your Humminbird- you'll learn more,  be less frustrated, and still have money to fill your boat with fuel. Video has different chapters patched together, many of which seem to be ""generic"" info, as opposed to specific to the 1100 series. DVD features don't work properly, and it doesn't play continually- goes back to menu. It's a pain to try to find your place again on the video. I was extremely disappointed!",1429833600,,518,4.630434782608695
