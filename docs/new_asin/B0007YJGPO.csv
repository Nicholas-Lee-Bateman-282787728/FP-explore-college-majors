8053992,3,B0007YJGPO,"The advice and suggestions on this DVD are great.

Unfortunately, it only plays on my laptop.  Something about the formatting won't allow it to play on any of the regular DVD players in my house.  You can get the audio but the picture skips all over the place.  I'm not a 100% sure what the problem is.

However--the substance and content of this DVD are really worth looking at.  Just be prepared you may not be able to play it on your TV.",1250985600,4,440,4.240963855421687
