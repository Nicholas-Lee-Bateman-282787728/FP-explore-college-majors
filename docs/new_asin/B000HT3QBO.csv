2641931,5,B000HT3QBO,I bought this because I saw it on IFC channel when they showed Janus films every Tuesday. The movie is absolutely great. The Disc 2 extras which includes a TCM film about 60 min. on Louise Brooks life and career. The best part is an interview with Louise and film clips. Lulu in Berlin is also on the disc. On Disc 1 is the movie and commentary on it. A must buy. Louise Brooks is an icon. Once you see her on screen you will see why.,1168732800,4,434,4.0
2641932,5,B000HT3QBO,"Not only is this the restored, 133 minute original version, but it comes with a selection of four music scores from which to choose for accompaniment and an optional discussion by two scholars commenting on the film as it progresses if you like.  There is an extraordinary video interview with Louise Brooks, a video biography of her and Kenneth Tynan's original 1979 ""New Yorker"" article ""The Girl in the Black Helmet"" in a little book along with two other articles one of which is by Louise Brooks herself.  The content of everything is marvellous and has made viewing this film an unending delight for me.  This is truly a classic rendition of an all time classic film and a must for the collection of any lover of the cinema.",1168473600,5,729,4.635658914728682
2641933,4,B000HT3QBO,"The film is much cleaner and easier to follow with the new subtitle cards.  The only complaint I have about it is the absence of the hauntingly beautiful piano music score from the Kino VHS release by Stuart Oderman.

Mr. Oderman's score completely conveys the darkness and hopelessness of the film with his haunting score.  This score compliments this film in the same way as the score for the film ""The Piano"" did.  I don't understand why Criterion didn't make it a part of the DVD release.",1168300800,7,492,4.620689655172414
2641934,5,B000HT3QBO,"I recently received my copy of the newly released version of ""Pandora's Box"" from Criterion and I can honestly tell you this is my vote for THE best release of 2006,bar none!!

To start with just picking this set up is impressive in itself! It comes in a handsome light and dark gray cardboard slip case almost an inch thick and inside it contains a two disk set absolutely loaded with fabulous and unexpectedly surprising extras AND a thick booklet!

The two disc set itself has the nice light and dark gray theme carried on for IT'S covering. When you slip the DVD into your player the screen gives you the usual surround and stereo audio options. However it also gives you your pick of FOUR(yes FOUR!!)different scores in which to choose from when viewing the movie. This is totally unprecedented in my experience. The scores are piano,orchestral(an approximation of what the late 20s European theater goer might have experienced),cabaret(a light and whimsical small band style) and modern orchestral. All these choices are absolutely wonderful but my favourite is the piano. However just having these options in the first place helps place this collection right at the top of the heap.

And if this wasn't enough film studies professor T.Elaessan and author Mary Ann Doanne together offer up a nice and very informative optional commentary on the film....one which I recommend at some point you give a listen to. And things don't stop there my friends!!

Two wonderful documentaries are also included. First is one I had heard of but had never seen called ""Lulu in Berlin"" produced back in 1984 by Richard Leacock and Susan Woll. It's a delightful film and mainly revolves around an interview of Louise in her home in Rochester,N.Y. a few years earlier. This comes in at around 48 minutes.

The other documentary is one that many Brooks fans will know that has come and gone on both DVD and VHS called ""Louise Brooks:Looking for Lulu"".That's right the self same documentary made by Hugh Hefner back in 1998 with commentary by Shirley MacLaine!!!This finishes in at about 60 minutes.

If this hasn't put you flat on your back by now I'm going to execute the coup de'gras. There are also two other interviews included here. One is with Richard Leacock the co-producer of ""Lulu in Berlin"" and the other with G.W.Pabsts' son Michael. Criterion went back about a year ago and interviewed these two just for this upcoming collection!

Next is the astounding and beautifully bound 98 page(from inside cover to inside cover) booklet. The booklet contains information relative to the movie plus three super articles. The first is by Village Voice film critic J.Hoberman,the second a reprint of Kenneth Tynans'article on Brooks ""The Girl in the Black Helmet"" first published in ""Sight and Sound"" magazine in June/79 and lastly Louises' own piece titled ""Pabst and Lulu"" taken from her own book ""Lulu in Hollywood"".The booklet throughout is lavishly illustrated. A great primer for the novice or a great read for the seasoned Brooksie fans!

The only soft spot in this entire release is on the techincal side. Even though it could be considered minor or ""picky"" by some I think in all fairness it should be brought to your attention. The print itself I don't think is quite as good as it could have been. It is a composite print from the Munich Film Museum/Pabst Collection who's two main sources seem to be Nero and Janus films. When I saw Janus appear on the screen my heart sank because I have never known Janus to release anything but severely slashed and inferior product. In fact the 1986 VHS release by Embassy was a Janus print and it came in at about 110 minutes.

The blurb in the included booklet reveals just a small portion of the restoration process on the print which included removing dust and dirt but that's about all. It's a shame the same care that was lavished on Kinos' ""Metropolis"" release(see my review on that) wasn't extended to this one because it would certainly have made a difference. While this print does show  its' age with the usual scratches and streaks evident in many films of this era(maybe a bit more than I'd like!) the most disappointing defect however is the recurring problem of the film going in and out of focus periodically. This is usually a sign of film shrinkage and its' uneven traversing during processing. I have only seen prints of this film like this and was hoping that this release would somehow come from another superior source which would have no such problem. While the Munich Museum doesn't seem to have such a print in its' hands it certainly doesn't totally rule out its' existence. Having said that however I must admit that they certainly did the best they could with what they did have on hand and they have also released the longest print of Pandoras Box I have ever seen  which comes in at two hours and 11 minutes!! All inter-titles are in German with English sub-titles.

In conclusion Criterion,as usual,has gone the extra mile and delivered a product everyone at every level of its' issue can be proud of. The above mentioned technical flaw aside this release is to me without doubt the BEST release of 2006. This is a higher priced set to be sure as are most of Criterions' products but you can be sure that a Criterion product is a superior product and with all the extras you are getting in this release in many ways it is a steal. And it is a release that no serious collector should be without!",1164931200,90,5464,4.74
2641935,5,B000HT3QBO,"This is not my personal opinion (I prefer F. W. Murnau's FAUST) but it is the general consensus regarding this groundbreaking adult film which made a screen icon out of Louise Brooks and assured G.W. Pabst his place in cinema history. The movie is based on two plays (EARTH SPIRIT and PANDORA'S BOX) by controversial German playwright Frank Wedekind who wrote them at the dawn of the 20th Century with the deliberate intent of shocking his middle class audience by talking bluntly about the consequences of sex, violence, and hypocrisy. Austrian composer Alban Berg would later use them as the source of his unfinished opera LULU.

G.W. Pabst already had a reputation as a director of German neo-realism thanks to the 1925 Greta Garbo film THE JOYLESS STREET (influenced by D.W. Griffith's ISN'T LIFE WONDERFUL of 1924). In the sound era he would make the film version of THE THREEPENNY OPERA (1931). PANDORA'S BOX mixes realism and German expressionism in equal amounts to tell the story of a naive dancer/prostitute and the tragedy she brings to everyone who tries to become close to her. It's amazing how Pabst saw something in Louise Brooks that no one else did and then brought it out so effectively onscreen. From the performances to the lighting, the editing and the camerawork, to the relentlessly downbeat mood, PANDORA'S BOX is a true landmark of the cinema (silent and sound) that anyone seriously interested in film should experience.

Finally available in the U.S. on DVD, this Criterion 2 disc set is all that you could ask for. The print for its age (1928) looks great and you get the choice of 4 different background scores which show how important music is to silent cinema. Each one makes it a different viewing experience. My personal favorite is Peer Ruben's modern orchestral score although you also get classical, cabaret, and piano to choose from. It also comes with 2 documentaries on Louise Brooks, informed commentary, and a 90 page booklet. Now that's the way to treat a cinema classic!",1164844800,109,2013,4.900293255131965
2641936,5,B000HT3QBO,"G.W. Pabst is perhaps the most underrated of all the early German film makers.  Unlike his contemporaries, Lang and von Stenberg, Pabts never successfully transitioned to Hollywood and was declared a traitor for creating films under the Nazi regime, although he would continue to make films in Germany for the rest of his life.  Pabst was not a political man, but a great auteur able to capture the condition of social exile within the changing culture of his time.  Based on the controversial plays by Wedekind, Lulu is Pabst's towering masterpiece.  She is a symbol of tradition battling modernity, the emergence of the New Woman, the corruption of the old European establishment after WWI and most important, the outsider who is devoured by the forces of legitimate policy and law.  However, Lulu is no martyr.  She represents the threat of the marginal and its ability to creep into the  fragile  constructed social reality.  She exposes the weakness of this aparatus and lives on as image in the mind of the viewer.  Like Pabst, Lulu rises above the compressing political and cultural views of the times, the people and the regimes that followed to become one of early cinema's most potent icons.",1163203200,18,1201,4.930348258706467
2641937,5,B000HT3QBO,"I bought Pandora's Box on VHS from Amazon some time ago and was impressed with Brook's subtle and disaffected but altogether timelessly erotic performance, made all the more amazing considering its great age (although Berlin in the late 1920s was totally unlike Hollywood, or even New York, in terms of liberal lifestyle). I had already seen Brooks' similar performance in Diary of a Lost Girl (1929), along with her charming flapper-girl-next-door appearance in The Show Off (1926). But I didn't really warm up to the actress until I read the engaging, articulate essays she had penned in the latter part of her fascinating life. In my opinion, her inciteful and thoroughly entertaining writing style confirms that she could have been both an extraordinarily successful actress and writer if she hadn't been what many have viewed as a self-destructive loner. However, Brooks consistently disdained fame, money, success and all the other outward prerequisites of conventional happiness in order to be a truly liberated human being. For better or worse, she succeeded in the effort, and expressed no regrets.

It is all too easy to become infatuated with the ghost of Louise Brooks, who in my opinion is the most beautiful actress who ever lived. But to truly understand this person you'll want to read her essays (collected in ""Lulu in Hollywood,"" with an introduction by Kenneth Tynan) along with Barry Paris' excellent book, ""Louise Brooks - A Biography."" Paris' 600-page biography of Brooks is a scholarly masterpiece -- comprehensive, well researched, and brilliantly provocative, and I guarantee that you will know Brooks personally when you have finished reading it.

As a Christian, I cannot recommend the lifestyle Brooks advocated and led. But if you (like me) love silent films and are fascinated with the impossibly-distant world of the 1920s, I think you'll find that Louise Brooks epitomizes both more than any other star of that era.

As for the 2-disc DVD set, it's simply great. The digitally remastered Pandora's Box is the best I've seen to date, and the four separate musical scores really add to the film. The filmed interview with Brooks late in her life is worth the DVD's price alone. This and the many other extras make Pandora's Box a fantastic bargain and a treasured addition to any silent film collection.",1160438400,27,2333,5.0861618798955615
2641938,5,B000HT3QBO,"I am delighted that Criterion is doing the dvd edition as it

2641939,5,B000HT3QBO,"This film is a must for silent film lovers and connoiseurs of film in general. G.W.Pabst directed and co-scripted a mesmerizing story (based on two plays) and filmed it in Germany with the stunning American actress Louise Brooks. She plays Lulu, a beautiful child/woman who doesn't understand the effect (and destruction) her open sexuality has on those around her. Considered daring in it's day, ""Pandora's Box"" still carries the emotional and sexual charge it did in 1928, thanks to Brook's striking beauty and performance and Pabst's straight-on directing of the story and it's subject matter---including a Lesbian countess who also falls for and helps Lulu when she's arrested for murder. Lulu is more or less an innocent in that she sees nothing wrong with sex therefore she can't understand the problems she unwittingly causes because others take her seriously and seek to possess her. Criterion is presenting a two disc set of this legendary film and it's been a long time coming. See also Pabst's other excellent German silent with Brooks made the following year (1929) ""Diary of a Lost Girl"", available from Kino. It's a fine companion piece to ""Pandora"" with Brooks playing another beautiful and misunderstood waif who ends up in a bordello. Both are collector's items and deserve viewing by modern audiences who are interested in the evolution of film as art.",1157241600,36,1370,5.093333333333334
2641970,5,B000HT3QBO,I was looking to reorder the movies and documentaries that were stolen and I ran across this collection.  I ordered it and couldn't be happier!  I've watched them twice & can't wait to let my niece watch them!!!,1401235200,,211,4.526315789473684
2641971,5,B000HT3QBO,"PANDORA'S BOX is the photoplay that earned beautifully bobbed flapper Louise Brooks international fame. Her most acclaimed role almost went to Marlene Dietrich, who was in director Georg Wilhelm Pabst's office waiting to sign a contract when news arrived from PARAMOUNT that Miss Brooks was available and willing to be in his latest picture.

""Pandora's"" is an at times eerie, and always mesmerizing melodrama that stars Brooks as Lulu the dancer and girl-for-hire who uses her enormous sex appeal to drive men mad with passion and jealousy. Lulu's sad fate is determined by a pre-film character list, for she is destined to tangle with Mr. Wrong: Jack the Ripper. Scenes between the serial killer and Lulu have an electric quality because Miss Brooks was attracted to Gustav Diessl, the actor playing Jack.

Pabst's masterpiece is a towering classic of German cinema. Highest recommendation!

(8.0) Pandora's Box (""Die Bchse der Pandora"") (Germany-1928) - Louise Brooks/Fritz Kortner/Francis Lederer/Carl Goetz/Alice Roberts/Gustav Diessl",1399939200,,1115,5.465116279069767
2641972,3,B000HT3QBO,"Agree with the consensus that this film is a classic: great b&w atmosphere, effectively conveys the decadence of Weimar Germany, etc., and set the Louise Brooks screen persona for all time. However  I'm also with the mixed to negative reviews Ive read about the film being overlong, an acquired taste and primarily of interest to Louise Brooks and silent film enthusiasts.
My other major reservation is the film score. I agree that the Kino piano score was much better than the Criterion cornucopia of Viennese schmaltz, ragtime and other styles that just don't work for a story like Pandora. The music finally got on the right track  if temporarily  with Tchaikovskys Romeo and some Wagner-esque passages from Liszts Faust Symphony. Ill give the film a mild thumbs up for historical significance (was it the inspiration for a lot of pre-Code movies?) but would not place it in the class of, say, silent classics like Sunrise or Metropolis.",1397347200,,940,4.974522292993631
2641973,5,B000HT3QBO,"A fantastic package. If you did not know Louise Brooks before this you will feel you have gained the acquaintance of a person with a star crossed but interesting life. It's not just the film itself, which is extraordinary, but the bonus interviews and the booklet. Louise Brooks shimmers on the screen, giving off toughness and vulnerability at the same time. To me this is one of Criterion's best packages.",1383523200,,407,4.828571428571428
2641974,5,B000HT3QBO,"Anybody who is a fan of silent movies should definitely track down this masterpiece by Georg Wilhelm Pabst.  Frankly I kept putting it off because of the length (133 minutes).  You may find other abbreviated versions but this Criterion DVD (not available on Blu ray) features a new (in 2006) restoration by the Munich Film Museum.  The German produced movie opens ambiguously with 20-something Lulu (strikingly beautiful Louise Brooks) flirting playfully with an older gentleman who turns out to be a meter reader or something.  He answers the door of the swank apartment and an even older guy enters.  He and Lulu obviously know each other, so in he comes and out goes the meter reader.

Once inside, the old guy known as Schigolch (Carl Goetz) starts snooping around in Lulu's purse and other personal affects.  He's looking for cash, but what is going on?  It turns out that Lulu has known the guy for many years, perhaps even as a child.  She tells someone that Schigolch was her first ""patron.""  That could mean several things.  Was he a wealthy nice guy who helped support Lulu when she needed it?  Was he giving her money in return for something else?  Does she owe him?  Based on Lulu happy-go-lucky attitude, she seems to like the old guy perhaps as a father figure, sleazy as he turns out to be.

While the film never overtly portrays Lulu as a prostitute early on, she is clearly attracted to older men with money.  In fact she has been set up by the wealthy newspaper editor, Dr. Ludwig Schon (Fritz Kortner).  Lulu is also a wannabee dancer who gets a leg up (pun intended) on a new musical, thanks to Schon's influence.  Schon insists that his relationship with Lulu must end.  His social status peers have frowned on his relationship with the tawdry Lulu.  After announcing his engagement with another young woman, more of his status, Lulu objects.  Schon tries but can't resist Lulu's charms and neither can most men.  It's how she gets her way.  And she's good at it.  Even Schon's wimpy son Alwa (Franz Lederer) is in love with Lulu.

After Schon and Lulu get married, he becomes enraged after finding Lulu playing ""tickle me"" or something possibly more salacious, with Schigolch and his constant idiot sidekick Rodrigo (Krafft-Raschig).  Later, drunk and armed with a pistol, Schon struggles with Lulu and bang, Schon goes down.  After being sentenced to 5 years in the slammer and with help from the son Alwa, Schigolch, Rodrigo and a business acquaintance of Alwa's, Countess Anna Geschwitz (Alice Roberts), Lulu and her entourage hightail it out of there, eventually ending up in London.

This has been said to be the earliest film that puts some emphasis on a possible Lesbian relationship.  The Countess clearly has her sights set on Lulu.  We see that upon their first meeting.  There is another scene when the two women dance together that seals the deal, at least for the Countess. The Countess continues to help Lulu, even when it means having sex with Rodrigo.  The Countess disappears from the film after coming out of a room disheveled and unkempt, apparently raped by Rodrigo who is found dead in the room.

The remaining trio (Lulu, Alwa and Schigolch) are desperate, living in an unheated London building eating frozen bread.  We see Schigolch's despicable character more clearly now as he pimps Lulu out on the street.  Her first customer?  Jack the Ripper.  You can figure out the rest or better yet, see the film.

It is beautifully constructed and is thoroughly entertaining.  I can't say enough about Louise Brooks.  She is truly stunning in this silent film.  Her emotional range is quite remarkable, especially in this early era of film.  Rarely do I get drawn in by a single character, but I could certainly understand how the men in Lulu's life were captivated by her charms.

This Criterion DVD has some very cool extras.  There are 4 different musical scores to choose from, 5 if you include one that has a Dolby Digital stereo and a Dolby Digital 5.1 option.  The rest are Dolby Digital 2.0.  You can sample each before selecting and it is easy enough to change the audio option during the film.  I listened to about 10 minutes of each before settling on the 5.1 option.  There are several other extras in the Criterion package including several pieces highlighting Louise Brooks and a mostly academic audio commentary by film scholars Thomas Elsaesser and Mary Ann Doane.  The restoration itself has some unfixable damage but for the most part is excellent and certainly, always watchable.

Unfortunately much of Louise Brooks' earlier films have been lost.  Her last was with John Wayne in 1938 (""Overland Stage Raiders"").  In an interesting piece of trivia, Jonathan Demme's 1986 movie ""Something Wild"" features the main character whose nickname is Lulu (Melanie Griffith).  She looks and acts much like Brooks character and even has the same dark hair bob.",1379980800,2,4906,4.827130852340936

She never shines as much as in this film... and Pabst's later films weren't nearly as interesting or memorable. The criterion collection includes 3 soundtracks but it is missing the subtle piano soundtrack that was on the vhs release. This soundtrack is a big part of how I originally saw and came to love this movie so that is a major nix for me. As respected as Criterion is, the soundtracks included don't seem to match the movement or themes of the characters nearly as well and for silent film releases I think the use of music is a major issue. So a disappointment.",1356912000,7,685,4.359375
2641979,5,B000HT3QBO,"No one could create Louise Brooks, just like no one could create Pabst's 'Lulu'. No. Pabst's 'Lulu' had to be real, had to exist, and had to do so naturally; unaware. No. Louise Brooks is not a Pabst invention, and neither is her performance in Pandora's Box. What Pabst did, quite simply, was find his 'Lulu'. The film itself is pure invention, Pabst used psychology as his weapon and his intellect as his charm. He pinned actors against each other, he favored one actor on Monday only to dismiss him by Tuesday. Pabst created the purest form of realism possible. By exposing his actor's insecurities, hiding the plot from them, and initiating mind games with every member of the cast on and off set. Pabst loved chess. His love of chess is evident in Pandora's Box. Pandora's Box is his 'check-mate'.

So. No. Pabst did not create Lousie Brooks. Pabst made Lousie Brooks what she is today; an ultimately tragic relic of a bygone age. I cannot believe how astonishingly perfect Pandora's Box was conceived. Pabst is a true nobleman of the cinema for a number of reasons, my confidence will never sway in that regard. Pabst made the perfect film. A rarity, a pleasure, and a true art. His direction, the key to the enigma, only comes out of its perpetual hiding after a few viewings. It is Louise Brooks, and only Louise Brooks, that your eyes and heart feast on during the first time you watch Pandora's Box. Brooks was the most enchanting, dazzling, and transcendental of the silent screen goddesses. In the scene where Shon's is caught making love to her by his fianc and his son, Brooks delivers the greatest facial expression ever captured on film. An act of dominance and sexual achievement. A grin that is truly timeless, as if she's staring through time and space, testing your wildest urges, daring you to love her, and begging you to beg to forget it. Although Brooks didn't know then, or even cared to know at the time, soon she would have Pabst all figured out. She realized that the greatest performance of her career, and one of the most legendary in all of cinema, was not a performance at all, it wasn't even acting. It was her. It was documentary. I was real. Perhaps the greatest invention belonging to G. W. Pabst was the invention of truth. Things look different when they are being filmed, it is a natural reaction to put on on an act of sort when one knows he or she is being watched. Pabst bypassed that fault in cinematic realism and created reality. Untouched by fabled hands, pure and innocent, L. Brooks. Arguably, Pabst is the only director who has ever accomplished such a remarkable feat.

And the Criterion Collection's DVD is remarkable. Stunning bonus features that will keep you occupied for hours. One of the finest Commentary Tracks I have ever heard on a Criterion disc.

This version of Pandora's Box is a pristine print, but the four musical score that it come with are lousy.  They are boring and sleep inducing rather than hypnotic.

2641985,5,B000HT3QBO,"It was a dark and stormy night... I lay on the couch drowsily flicking through channels... and came instantly awake  when Louise Brooks, slinky, sexy, and completely captivating, came onto the screen. Lulu, they called her. I was mesmerized to the very end. The movie was this Criterion restoration of Pandora's Box.

Puzzling, amoral LuLu! A pantomime and a book of the pantomime,at least 10 movies, two plays,an opera, and a comic book (yes, this LuLu). The tale of descent and disaster story has inspired the utmost daring in playwrights, composers, and movie makers since the 19th century. Fritz Wedekind saw the story in pantomime and wrote two famous and germinal plays. Georg Pabst masterfully distilled both plays into this silent movie (at least the third LuLu film) in 1929.

The film is wonderfully restored, sharp, bright, and with hardly a speck or scratch, and there is far more in the Criterion set than you will ever get from TV or Netflix. You can choose from four (wonderfully well played)scores -- one for each of the first four times you watch the movie. There's a documentary about Brooks and an interview with her and more interviews and commentary and a nice big booklet. And you can watch the culmination of silent movie technique, where expression and gesture speak more clearly than words. Quite a bargain, and Louise Brooks is THE LuLu. Or Pandora, releasing death and destruction on a world of lovers.

I glimpsed the exact forehead of spit curls that Hercule Poirot's secretary (the David Suchet version) wears, and came to understand that Pandora's Box must be a major reference for costume, hair styles, and The Look for films and videos set in the 20's and 30's. Just part of the fun of rewatching.

Lovers of opera -- or of Alban Berg-- might study this movie. It's perhaps not certain that Berg ever saw it before he started on LuLu (he worked from the Frank Wedekind plays and made a much longer and more muddled story from them), but Pabst's Pandora's Box echoes through all the productions of LuLu I've seen or heard of.

2642001,2,B000HT3QBO,"I wanted to like this film. And there is a lot to like about it. It is directed by G.W. Pabst, a German director, and it stars American actress Louise Brooks.

You may not know who Louise Brooks is, but if you see her picture you will be immediately familiar with her startling for its day but now iconic look. Like I said, there is a lot to like about the film, including the participants, the direction (which is amazing) and the incredible use of light and shadow and dramatic imagery. But the film falls apart on the story. It's pretty maudlin and unbelievable, even for Hollywood, even for the silent film era -- and those are its good points.

This is a famous silent film and deservedly so. I can see why. The direction and images, again, are second to none. But the story of a woman who uses her sexuality to get what she wants, and then meets a Jack the Ripper kind of killer in London later on, pales. It could have been a much better story, I think, but whoever wrote it just phoned in the dramatic elements and left everything else to chance.  Pabst, being something of a genius, did the best he could with such third-rate material.

Anyway, that's how it seemed to me. Sorry, but even though this is a very famous silent film, and Louise Brooks is exceptional, and the direction of Pabst is first-rate, I can't recommend it at all. Oh, for the record, the music soundtrack blows chunks, too. It often doesn't match what's happening on screen. Too bad.

It would have been excellent if vertical wear lines were removed (mostly at the start or end of what were the old reels) and the annoying second-to-second jitter between being in-focus and being slightly out-of-focus corrected (most of which occurs toward the end of the film).  It's star, former dancer Louise Brooks, and the character Brooks plays, Lulu, seem to be distinctively defined (and apparently best remembered) by, well, a striking hair style exhibited at the beginning and at the end of the film. Trivial, but none the less it seems true.  When Brooks/Lulu changes her hair style for a short time midway through the film, she becomes just another pretty face in the film crowd.  This is not to say that Brooks is not attractive (she is but a bit on the chubby side).  Her performance is also energetic, exceptionally expressive (especially her face), and she exhibits a wide range of acting abilities. The film is often bogged down by  episodic ""Acts"" that are overly abundant (they just keep coming and coming), erratically juxtaposed (the narrative flow frequently suffers), and drawn out (even the more action-packed Acts are negatively impacted) due to repetitious shots and torturously slow-paced, overly-melodramatic acting.  The ""script"" exhibits a ongoing credibility gap: no matter where in the world Lulu goes, the same troupe of characters keeps turning up.  Sort of like actors traveling from town to town in a road show.

 Recommend having a caffeinated beverage close at hand when viewing for the first time.

2642003,5,B000HT3QBO,"Probably no movie star was ever more perfectly suited for black and white photography than the captivating Louise Brooks. Her iconic look - the shiny black bob and porcelain skin - transcends her own era and has become one of the most timeless images of the silver screen. The film that epitomizes the enigma of Louise Brooks is G. W. Pabst's 1929 masterpiece, PANDORA'S BOX. It caused quite a bit of controversy on its initial release and brought Brooks worldwide acclaim for what proved to be the most memorable role of her career.

In PANDORA'S BOX, Lulu (Brooks) is a young showgirl whose incredible beauty and passion for life leaves a trail of broken admirers in her wake. Brash yet essentially innocent, she effortlessly gets what she wants until events ultimately spiral out of her control.

A strikingly modern melodrama, the film is also an extremely stylish, visual feast. It's impossible to overstate the brilliant use of lighting - practically every shot is akin to a work of art. Complete with foreboding shadows cast across sparse art deco sets, PANDORA'S BOX is German expressionist filmmaking at its most hypnotic.

As Lulu, Louise Brooks radiates sensuality with a unique subtlety of expression and gesture that's never been equalled. It's one of those rare instances in cinema where actress and role became inextricably linked and immortalized.

The Criterion DVD set gives us a fabulously restored, uncut version of the film with four separate music scores to choose from. There's also an insightful commentary track by film scholars Thomas Elsaesser and Mary Doan.

Bonus features include the in depth documentary ""Looking for Lulu"" (1998), narrated by Shirley MacLaine; ""Lulu in Berlin"" (1984), which features a fascinating interview with Brooks from 1976; other interviews with historian Richard Leacock and Michael Pabst, the director's son.

 If you've never been exposed to the legendary Louise Brooks or you just want to check out one of the greatest silent films ever, take a look inside PANDORA'S BOX - you'll be in for a dazzling, unforgettable viewing experience.",1268611200,8,2094,5.141176470588236
2642004,5,B000HT3QBO,"Pandora's Box, a reference to Greek mythology about a woman named Pandora created by Zeus as a punishment to mankind.  Zeus gave Pandora a jar and told her not to open it but her curiosity led her to open it and thus the evils and diseases that mankind has never seen before was unleashed.

In 1929, the silent film adaptation directed by Georg Wilhelm Pabst (""The Threepenny Opera"", ""Diary of a Lost Girl"") of Frank Wedekind's plays ""Erdgeist"" and ""Die Buchse der Pandora"" was released in theaters.  The film would star one of the most erotic (non-nude) icons of the silent-era, Louise Brooks who played the main character of Lulu.

This 1929 silent film is a major achievement with its progressive content seen way ahead of its time.  As many films in Germany were known to push the boundaries that many people in other countries have never seen before, especially from a silent film. ""Pandora's Box"" is a true classic and this Criterion Collection release features the film, digitally remastered and restored (although those who saw various versions of the classic film have mentioned that the film is not 100% complete) with four optional musical scores.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Pandora's Box"" is featured in black and whit and presented in its original aspect ratio of 1:33:1.  Since the film is over 80-years-old, it's understandable that the picture quality is not going to be free of scratches and dust.  But Criterion has done a great job in remastering this film as the film is truly watchable and there are some scenes that look great with a few scenes having more dust and scratches than others.  According to the Criterion Collection, the digital transfer was created from a 35mm composite print provided by the Munich Film Museum/G.W. Pabst Collection.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System.

It is important to note that since 1973 to present, there have been a variety of restoration done on the film.  Each presentation of ""Pandora's Box"" featuring something new or something incomplete.  In fact, as mentioned, the film has been edited in various countries, so different films received had a different cut.  I personally have not watched any of these versions to answer what scenes were included and what were not but I trust that the Criterion Collection using the Munich Film Museum's version to be a wise choice.

As for the audio, ""Pandora's Box"" features four musical scores.  It's important to note that while many people who have viewed this film in the 1970's and 1990's were treated with different scores.  I will say right now that none of those scores are featured on The Criterion Collection DVD release.

The choice for audio scores are the following:

  * Orchestral Score by Gillian Anderson - Anderson who has scored for films such as D.W. Grffith's ""Broken Blossom"" and F.W. Murnau's ""Nosferatu"" .  This score is in Dolby Digital 5.1 and Anderson said the inspiration came from what an orchestra director of the grand European ""cinema palaces"" might have chosen.  This was my preference for the musical score for the film.
  * Cabaret Score - Dimitar Pentchev's score was reminiscent of the German cabaret music of the 1920's and 1930's and is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo.
  * Modern Orchestral Score - By Peer Haben, this score was used for the Munich Film Museum's restored Print from the 1997 Berlin Film Festival.
  * Piano Improvisation - Featuring Stephan Oliva's score and immersed himself in the atmosphere of Berg's opera ""Lulu"" in creating this piano score.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Pandora's Box"" comes with the following special features:

Disc 1:

  * Audio Commentary - Audio commentary by film scholars Thomas Elsaesser and Mary Ann Doane.  These two have studied this film for a long time and both give their interpretation of what they got out of the film.  Very intriguing, in-depth and informative commentary.

Disc 2:

  * Louise Brooks: Looking for Lulu - (59:44) A wonderful documentary made by Hugh Munro Neely for Turner Classic Movies from 1998 which goes in-depth of her life as a child to her latest years in seclusion.  Interviews with family members, friends and talent who appreciate her work.
  * Lulu in Berlin - (48:05) Verite documentarian Richard Leacock interviews Louise Brooks in 1971.  Louise Brooks talks about her experiences working with Pabst and the other talent in the film.
  * Richard Leacock on Louise Brooks - (5:08) A 2006 interview in which Richard Leacock talks about what happened before and after his interview with Louise Brooks back in 1971.
  * Michael Pabst on his father, G.W. Pabst - (34:25) In this 2006 featurette, Michael Pabst talks about his scholarly interest in his father's films including interviewing his father but not publishing the interview.  Also, about his father and the challenges he faced in his later years.
  * Stills Gallery - Stills from ""Pandora's Box""

Also, included with this release is a 98-page book featuring Kenneth Tynan's 1979 essay ""The Girl in the Black Helmet"" which appeared in The New Yorker featuring one of last interviews with Louise Brooks, an article titled ""Pabst and Lulu"" written in 1965 for Sight and Sound by Louise Brooks on her relationship with Pabst, and a new essay ""Opening Pandora's Box"" by critic J. Hoberman.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I absolutely enjoyed Pandora's Box and I also enjoyed the overall presentati0n and content from what was provided by The Criterion Collection.

""Pandora's Box"", adored by many as a silent film to be so involving and deep but a film ahead of its time.  Also, for the film's portrayals of its characters, its editing and overall storyline.  From Lulu's power over those who love her and seeing these individuals succumbing in one way or another but to find her match with Jack the Ripper.  A film in 1929 that would feature a woman showing her passionate eyes towards Lulu and an early film showcasing lesbian tendencies.

Of course, not all countries wanted to feature these story elements that can easily be misconstrued as too controversial.  In the US version, the Countess (the lesbian who is in love with Lulu) became a childhood friend and the tragic story would be no more as there would be no Jack the Ripper and somehow the story would feature Lulu joining the Salvation Army. Personally, I can't imagine such a thing but then again, I did not grow up in 1929 and it was a different era.

In Germany, ""Pandora's Box"" was not too popular in Germany.  In fact, Pabst's decision to go with an American actress instead of a German actress was seen to be too bold and I'm sure many looked as the bypassing of Marlene Dietrich for the main role to be quite blasphemous.

But for those who discovered the film many decades after its release were amazed by the complexity of the story for a silent film and what was featured on camera.  The film would be regarded by many film historians and cinema fans as a true classic and would be looked as G.W. Pabst's masterpiece.

Seeing how Pabst was so well in-tuned in what he wanted from his talent, treating them differently, having them do things that may have made them feel uncomfortable but was needed to obtain the performance he imagined (note: A lot of these stories you will learn about in the special features included in this release).  From Pabst's working in tandem with his cinematographer in capturing the scene the way he wanted, being their early in the morning and late at night to make sure they planned the details of what shots they wanted.  It's amazing to see all that is captured in this film.  It may seem a bit complex for a film that is not a talkie but the fact that he was able to capture so much in a silent film and show how Lulu is literally a pandora's box and somehow hurts those who gets close to her.  You have this sense of ambiguity if Lulu is even conscious about the things that she has done or does she even care, or is this just a matter of people who got caught up in situations that led to them to their demise or having them  spiraling downward.  And as much as this is a Pabst masterpiece and what he was able to get out of the characters and capture in camera, I also have to give praise to Ladislaus Vajda for creating the scenario of the characters.

Aside from the various versions, the film is just captivating.  This is a film that utilizes facial expressions and action to tell a complex story and Pabst does a wonderful job in crafting this masterpiece.  Louise Brooks is absolutely wonderful as Lulu and I agree that I can not see Marlene Dietrich performing the role of Lulu, this is a character that Brooks commands and it possibly helps that Louise Brooks and Lulu had many things in common and that people who have discovered the film are just intrigued by both Brooks in real life and Lulu in the film.  Through various interviews, the real actress was very similar to Lulu in some sense.  Brooks was an actress that worked hard and played hard but did things on her own terms which surprised one of the largest film company's by turning down a multi-year contract to film ""Pandora's Box"", she also was a Ziegfeld Follies dancer who quit because she was bored with it.  She was one of the most wanted silent actresses of her time but because she went against the Hollywood way, she was informally blacklisted.

This is another excellent release from The Criterion Collection.  I know it's not a perfect release as some fans of the film who have seen various versions say that this the film is not 100% and that many regard past scores to be much better and wished for inclusion in this release.  Granted, perhaps there could have been an inclusion of the US edited release of the film to show how different these edits would have made the film but personally, I'm quite content with what the Criterion Collection has provided.  I remember when I first saw ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" and wished there were multiple scores featured and the fact that Criterion did provide four well-done audio scores is fantastic.

In some sense, we are getting three stories with this collection.  On one side, we get the silent film ""Pandora's Box"" but on the other side, there are two intriguing stories that capture your attention.  We get the story of G.W. Pabst and the challenges he had face in his career as a director but we also get this in-depth look at the career of Louise Brooks who embodies Lulu.  In some way, it's quite tragic because you see the connection of Lulu from ""Pandora's Box"" and for Louise Brooks, how a horrible incident at a young age led to her lifestyle but in the end, even bedridden, she still managed to be a strong woman vocally and I can see why so many people have appreciated her as an actress.  She lived her life, made her own decisions even though it may have been a detriment to her career.

Overall, ""Pandora's Box"" is one of those silent films that must be put in your list of silent-film's to own or to see.  The presentation, the content that is included in this release is absolutely fantastic and once again, another release from The Criterion Collection that is highly recommended!",1262822400,4,11168,4.725581395348837
2642005,5,B000HT3QBO,"I generally prefer black & white films to color--if they're good, of course--but I really viewed that many silent pictures, and PANDORA'S BOX came as a real surprise. The overall ""look"" of the film is modern & there must have been extra effort spent to preserve this masterpiece of early German cinema. Another reviewer expressed dismay that the Nazi era completely interrupted the flow of German film--and I fully agree with that sentiment. [Incidentally, I did not view a copy purchased from Amazon, at least I don't think it was--but it did have the Criterion label & I think that's how the visual quality was so lovingly preserved.

Louise Brooks' Lulu is thoroughly contemporary, she reminded me of a ""hip"" chick. I believe her cropped hairdo was called an ""Eaton"" because so many University age women were sporting. It was the early days of the Liberated Woman. I was unfamiliar with Louise Brooks the actress and at first assumed that she was German. German expressionism is one of my favorite genre & it worked perfectly with Brook's add naturalism. There are deep rouged or thick eye makeup in the movie--for the exception of Lulu's father who is sort of ""grostesque"" character.

Lulu is the early 19th century A-Moral Poster Girl. Sometimes it's difficult to get a clear grasp on the character because she is so mercurial, seductive...and strange. The melodrama follows Lulu's sexual conquests in Germany (including a lesbian Countess) to her eventual self-exile in London. The conclusion of the film reminded me of THE ROMAN SPRING OF MRS. STONE starring Vivian Leigh as a middleaged American recently widowed and living at very loose ends in Italy (incidentally, the movie also featured legendary German actress Lotte Lenya as a sort of female pimp.)I won't say any more because I don't want to give the end away--and it's a real jolt.

Louise Brroks is wonderful & PANDORA'S BOX is great.

2642007,5,B000HT3QBO,"In Greek mythology, the story of Pandora's Box was the story of the havoc that can be unleashed when a woman recklessly fails to head the advice of a man.

In that way, the story is sexist and mysoginistic in much the same way as the story of Eve tempting Adam to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil and of this story here where Ziegfield girl Louise Brooks bumps and grinds her way through this silent classic.

Brooks' character Lulu dances.  She glides.  She effortlessly turns the men around her to jelly because...well, she can, and also because she just enjoys it.

Like any reckless actor, the naive Lulu leaves carnage in her wake that ultimately and perhaps in an act of poetic justice ends up including even her.

Rightfully regarded as one of the great products of Weimar cinema this movie sadly reminds of what promise the German cinema may have had if only the Nazis hadn't put it out of existence (an event mirrored to a lessor degree in the United States as to American cinema by the creation of the Hayes Code).

Highly recommended.",1249603200,2,1062,4.5
2642008,5,B000HT3QBO,"Somewhere emblazoned in the pathos of Greek mythology, the God's created Pandora, a female object of pristine beauty and unbridled sexual ferocity.  She possessed a box, one that contained all the evils of the world.  And once opened, chaos was unleashed in frenetic fasion.

This classic story here features Louise Brooks, who is a goddess in her own right.  She plays Lulu, the most gorgeous, alluring, hypnotic, and dangerous female character in the history of cinema.  High praise, but believe me, she casts an irresistable spell over any man who wanders into her vicinty.

Lulu is a real charmer, seducing men with her radiant smile and affectionate ways.  Her beauty is so powerful, so controlling, that it could drive a man to do foolish things.

Like when one poor fella tries to resist, she replies with a sweet sort of keen elegance, ""YOU'LL HAVE TO KILL ME TO GET RID OF ME.""  Whoa ho ho, a powerful bit of foreshadowing.

The story advances with a murder, trial, and escape, with the camera rarely drifting far from Lulu's glorious visage.  The drama builds as she's eventually forced into prostitution, with an astounding climax with Jack the Ripper.  Few cinematic exchanges hinge with such an absorbing level of uncertainty.  Movie making at its absolute finest.  This silent film offers some incredible scores as well, to lull you into a state of beautiful oblivion.

On a side note, Quentin Tarantino tried to somewhat recreate this mesmerizing femme fatale with Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction.  The likeness in undeniable, but really you can only catch lightning in a bottle once, if you're lucky.",1228521600,,1612,4.936802973977695

Even if you hate the movie- it's worth the money just to see the beautiful shots of Louise Brooks.

He is quite charmed until an elderly man appears at the door and Lulu hustles him inside.  The scene tells us a lot about Lulu, but not all of our first impressions are correct.

While there are some tense scenes in PANDORA'S BOX, it's not what most people would call a thriller.  It is, in fact,
... a tragedy,
... black and white,
... German, and
... silent.
... Obviously, not what most people look for in a popcorn movie.

For all that, however, this film is a great romance and one of the most moving dramas on DVD.  It remains a showcase of great dramatic acting, all the more remarkable when actors' voices were not recorded and communication was through glance and gesture.  While Louise Brooks' portrayal of Lulu is justly famous, her costars are also extraordinary.

One example:  Lulu's lover is Dr. Schoen, the editor of a prestigious newspaper.  Their affection is mutual, but because Shoen cannot possibly marry a ""modern woman"" like Lulu in class-conscious Berlin, he announces his engagement to a woman from a respected family.  But when Schoen and his fiancee walk backstage at a musical review in which Lulu plays, there is an exchange of glances.  Schoen sees Lulu in costume and his fiancee immediately understands their relationship.  No words are exchanged; we see the recognition in the way lips tighten and eyes widen, we see the history revealed in a glance.

Few German films of the late '20s (PANDORA'S BOX was released in 1929) have left clean prints for the DVD era.  The Criterion disk is a little cloudy at times and the scenes occasionally seem out of focus and, since the story feels disjointed in places, there may also be missing footage, but this is likely the best restoration we're going to have.  Such minor defects do not detract from a deeply moving story and extraordinary performances.

Several alternate musical scores are included.  An audio commentary is a somewhat academic discussion of the social themes that inform the film and, in particular, feminist theory of ""the gaze"" is invoked to explain how Lulu's character is interpreted by the camera. The theory, I think, is interesting enough but is stretched beyond its applicability to this film.

One critic called this the best release of 2006.  Yes, indeed!",1218672000,,2416,4.815533980582524
2642018,5,B000HT3QBO,"Georg Wilhelm Pabst's 1929 film Pandora's Box is a masterful melodrama. Based on Frank Wedekind's character Lulu, Pandora's Box is a classic of German cinema detailing the life and downward spiral of a sexually vivacious yet innocent young woman. The original plays (Earth Spirit and Pandora's Box) which served as inspiration, were vast and rambling accounts of Lulu's many relationships. G.W. Pabst felt that theatregoers would lose interest in what would have been for the time a terribly long film, so screenwriter Ladislaus Vajda greatly edited the original stories. Rather than focusing on Lulu's multiple relationships, Vajda uses those with Dr. Schn and his son, Alwa as the principal examples of Lulu's unintentionally destructive sexual appetite. However the eroticism of the film isn't ever directly shown, rather it is implied through longing glances, physical gestures and even in the costume design.

The film tells the story of Lulu, an irrepressible and irresistible young woman, who inadvertently uses her nave sexual charms to seduce men into giving her what she wants. Though, she is clearly aware of her affect on men (and women), Lulu is oblivious to the disastrous consequences that her unrestrained affection causes. At first her flirtations help her to get ahead and Lulu is given a part in a musical revue, but when one of her lovers, Dr. Schn, tries to kill her in order to keep their affair a secret, he is accidentally killed instead. Lulu must flee the country or else suffer the legal penalty. She spends time on a gambling barge where Dr. Schn's son looks after her, but he has developed a serious gambling habit and they are being blackmailed. A man who knows of Lulu's identity says that he will inform the German authorities of her whereabouts if they do not pay him. After Alwa is caught cheating in a card game, trying to win the money, there is a riot and the boat catches fire and all aboard are evacuated. Alwa and Lulu end up in London where she becomes a prostitute and on Christmas, out of charity, she offers herself to a handsome stranger. This man turns out to be a conflicted killer (Jack the Ripper, in fact) and he murders Lulu. The irony being that Lulu in life was selfish in giving herself away to men and accepting their tokens of affection, all the while their lives fell apart and now Lulu gives herself away out of charity and she pays the price. But it is ultimately this final act that redeems her.

When the film was released it was unfairly criticized. German audiences were outraged that an American actress was playing the quintessentially German Lulu, and most critics felt the film to be emotionally shallow and the story to be disjointed. Only recently has Pandora's Box become so beloved by critics and film historians. The main reason for its current success is the rediscovery of Louise Brooks' naturalistic performance. One must remember that during the silent age many actors were stiff and gave forced performances while Louise Brooks was effortless and breezy, a true breath of fresh air.

The 2006 Criterion Collection edition is spectacular. The film has never looked so sharp nor sounded so good. Included are four different musical scores* and an excellent audio commentary. Also included is a fascinating book about Louise Brooks and the making of the film, a documentary by Hugh Munro Neely, a lengthy interview with Brooks, an interview with Pabst's son and a photo gallery. Overall this 2-disc Special Edition set is a must-have for fans of silent cinema.

* = The six audio tracks are:
1. & 2. Orchestral Score by Gillian Anderson (in both stereo and surround)
3. Cabaret Score by Dimitar Pentchev
4. Modern Orchestral Score by Peer Raben
5. Piano Improvisation by Stphan Oliva
6. Audio commentary with film historians Thomas Elsaesser and Mary Anne Doane

2642019,5,B000HT3QBO,"Not only do you get the classic Pabst film, PANDORA'S BOX, but you get it with a choice of background music; a wonderful booklet, ""Reflections on Pandora's Box"", containing screenshots from the film and illuminating articles by Kenneth Tynan (who had an interesting relationship with Ms. Brooks in her last years) and an article by Louise Brooks herself; and a bonus DVD which includes the TCM biographical documentary ""Looking for Lulu"", as well as a rare filmed interview made in 1971 with Louise Brooks, and an interview with Pabst's son.

PANDORA'S BOX was the first of 2 German films Louise Brooks made for G.W. Pabst. She was a fairly well established silent screen actress before that, but in PANDORA'S BOX, Pabst made her into an icon of innocent sexuality. In this film she is absolutely radiant..the sun which draws several men into her orbit, with tragic consequences for them, and ultimately, for herself. Louise Brooks does not act the part of Lulu. She is Lulu incarnate, and in interviews readily admits it. Pabst at one point, even told her that if she didn't reign in her personal life and take her career seriously, she would suffer the same fate as Lulu. Aside from Brooks' performance, the film was groundbreaking in it's depiction of a dissolute Weimar Republic Germany, a society drowning in it's own vice and corruption, and in it's (for the time) bold approach to both heterosexual and homosexual relations.

Louise Brooks was that rare individual, who marched to the beat of her own drummer. A woman of rare beauty, intelligence, and keen wit, who epitomized the uninhibited, independent woman of the Roaring 20s. A woman who wouldn't play by Hollywood's rules, and as a result, essentially ruined her career as an actress. Later in life, she gave us a glimpse into that brilliant mind by becoming a writer for various magazines and film journals.

This Criterian package would make a great gift for any film buff. The movie, book, commentaries, and tributes help establish the place of Louise Brooks in the pantheon of great talents of the 20th century.",1215734400,,2079,4.917378917378917
2642020,5,B000HT3QBO,"One of the last great works of the silent cinema, G.W. Pabst's PANDORA'S BOX was cruelly-ignored and dismissed by both audiences and critics upon it's original release in 1929.  It wasn't until the George Eastman House revived the movie in the 1950s' that it finally started to receive it's full recognition--and resurrected it's luminous star Louise Brooks from an impoverished, destitute existence in New York in the process.

Based on two separate German plays written by Frank Wedekind (""Der Erdgeist"" and ""Die Bchse der Pandora""), Louise Brooks plays Lulu, a beautiful young dancer, full of life and vitality, and with a special talent in luring respectable men to ruin.  Lulu is involved with an older newspaper magnate, Schn (Fritz Kortner), despite his engagement to another woman.  Their affair blows wide open when his fiancee discovers them in a very compromising position; and Schn is forced to marry Lulu in order to avoid a scandal.  On their wedding night, Schn tries to force Lulu to shoot herself, but in the ensuing struggle it's Schn who ends up dead, and Lulu is sentenced to five years in prison.  Her friends create a distraction in the courtroom and Lulu flees the country with a ""borrowed"" passport.  Accompanied by Schn's son Alwa (Franz Lederer), Lulu runs to London where her ultimate downfall is just around the corner...

Louise Brooks, with her shiny black bobbed hair and lithe dancer's body, was the ultimate 1920s jazz baby, a hoofer from the Midwest who never wanted to become a movie star, but unwittingly created one of the most haunting characters in movie history with Lulu in PANDORA'S BOX.  Brooks made only a handful of movies (most of her early silents have sadly been lost forever), but we can be thankful PANDORA's BOX is still here, as vibrant and as vital as it was when first released back in '29.

PANDORA'S BOX is filled with lots of haunting imagery, the provocative storyline genuinely shocked audiences of the times (the film was heavily-edited following it's American debut).  Perhaps most importantly, it preserves the heady atmosphere of pre-war Weimar Berlin, just a few short years before Hitler took power.  According to sources, Pabst was just about to sign a young unknown called Marlene Dietrich until Brooks (in self-imposed exile from Hollywood) became available for the part.

If you're a fan of silent cinema, PANDORA'S BOX will be an essential title.  If you want to start exploring the slender catalogue of Louise Brooks films, it's a great place to start.",1208563200,3,2523,4.990453460620525
2642021,3,B000HT3QBO,"I have to at least mildly dissent from the overwhelming number of rave reviews.  This is certainly not a DVD that should be purchased by the casual film fan.  It falls into the ""interesting, rather than entertaining"" category.  The plot is convoluted, implausible, and difficult to follow.  You definitely want to watch it with the commentary turned on to help you figure out what is going on.  (By the way, this is the first time I've listened to a film commentary where the two film critics have significant differences of opinion about the meaning of the film.)  To enjoy the film you have to appreciate the way the scenes were set up and the images were composed, more or less ignoring the plot and the overwrought acting.  To some extent I could do this (with the help of the commentators), but the film has deteriorated to the point where many of the images are somewhat cloudy and obscured.  A pristine print - probably impossible - would greatly improve the watchability of this film.  There is no denying that Louise Brooks was beautiful and tremendously alluring, but at more than two hours, this film was definitely heavy sledding for me.

By the way, [SPOILER ALERT] I don't understand why the serial killer who murders LuLu at the end of the film is referred to as ""Jack the Ripper.""  The two commentators on the DVD make this reference, as does the Amazon critic.  But the serial killer in this film is clearly not Jack the Ripper.  The film is set in London in 1928 and Jack the Ripper lived in the 1880s.  No one in the film refers to the killer by name.  I guess at some point, a critic must have decided that since it's London and the guy is a serial killer, he must have been intended to be Jack the Ripper.",1205539200,11,1726,4.487179487179487

2642024,5,B000HT3QBO,"The silent black/white film made back in 1928 by G.W. Pabst is a beautiful striking gem of German Expressionism that was released by Criterion in 2006 as a wonderful set of two discs. The film comes with four musical scores, each offering its own interpretation of ""Pandora Box"". I decided to go with ""Cabaret Score"" and was not disappointed. Composed by Dimitar Pentchev, the score sets the film in a Weimar-era (1920s) cabaret, incorporates elements of popular European music of that time with the contemporary techniques of presenting it. The set also features a biographical documentary about Louise Brooks and her career that began in dancing and took her to Hollywood first, and then to Europe where she had made ""Pandora's Box"" for which she will be remembered as long as the movies exist.

""Pandora's Box"" is a screen adaptation of the play ""Lulu"" from expressionist playwright Franz Wedekind and it follows a showgirl named Lulu, charming, amoral yet childishly playful, innocent, and absolutely irresistible for every character in the movie, both male and female. On the road of self-destruction, Lulu unintentionally  causes downfall and tragedy for every man she meets and eventually she will arrive to London just in time for a Christmas Party in a company of Jack the Ripper.. In the Pabst's film, which is a perfect modern realization of the ancient Pandora's myth, Louise Brooks plays Lulu as ""a beautiful evil"", ""all-gifted"" perfect woman-child desirable by every man (and woman), and unaware of the disastrous effects of her sex appeal. 22 years old Brooks, a native Texan, a trained dancer turned actress is extraordinary as Lulu. She made the part of Lulu her own, mixing in the performance great acting abilities and rare instinct. The 133 minutes long film is surprisingly modern, complex, controversial, and fast-moving. It's got many memorable scenes and performances. Louise Brooks' performance under G.W. Pabst's inspiring directing makes the film a real cinematic treasure and perhaps the sexiest movie ever made. You don't have to take my words for granted - just watch the film.",1195430400,4,2107,5.139941690962099
2642025,5,B000HT3QBO,"You have to love silent movies and Weimar movies in particular to enjoy what a treat Pandora's Box is.  It was a stroke of good fortune for G.W. Pabst to land Louise Brooks, the hottest actress in her day, for this cinematic version of Frank Wedekind's Lulu Plays.  The plays were notorious in their day for bringing the more seedy aspects of German life to the stage.  Pabst tones down the subject matter in a well crafted film that put Louise Brooks front and center as Lulu.  It is hard to accept her as a femme fatale, more a victim of circumstance, in these 8 acts that develop the tragic life of a showgirl, who goes from riches to rags.  Brooks had essentially walked out on Hollywood as the industry was shifting from silent movies to talkies, drawn to Berlin in the 1920's.  Her trademark haircut had become the rage of the Art Deco era, and this film immortalized her.

Criterion has packaged this set beautifully with two DVD's that also include numerous musical scores, commentaries and insightful interviews.  There is a nice booklet that comes with the set that offers various critical reviews as well as photos.

Who is the fairest one of all?

The mirror, with a convoluted sense of humor, (and presumably drunk), responds:

Louise brooks nary a rival
(Louise Brooks, brooks (to put up with) nary (not a one) rival)
Any pretender will she stifle! (Stifle rhymes with rival? Well, kinda...)

At any rate, Louise Brooks and Snow White's stepmother, (the queen),
have a lot in common, i.e., they both metamorphosed from great beauties into
ugly old hags. The Criterion Collection offers ample proof of this. In Pandora's Box,
Louise Brooks appears beautiful, sensual, and vivacious. Alas, in her later years
she is a startling train wreck of her former self. But, getting back to Pandora's Box, she
outshines everyone else in the film like a nova. The dismal pathos so prevalent in
german cinematography of the day, is smacked into smithereens by the radiant effulgence of Brooks.
In the movie, her lover, a rich tycoon, slouches all over the place, his head hung in quiet despair.

skimping merrily to and fro.  Enjoying this wondrous woman is an experience not to be

2642044,4,B000HT3QBO,"G.W. Pabst's PANDORA'S BOX is not a perfect film. It's not even close to perfect. By contemporary tastes, it is too long and too slow. But none of that matters because this is the movie that made Hollywood rebel Louise Brooks a timeless, international film icon.

  Norma Desmond's line in SUNSET BLVD (1950)--""We didn't need dialogue. We had faces!""--could have been written with Louise Brooks of Cherryvale, Kansas, in mind. Her face, like an object of Art Deco, framed with the ""black helmet"" hairdo, was perfectly symmetrical, a face no camera could catch from a bad angle even if it tried. On film, her use of that face--or, rather, how Pabst used it in PANDORA--is endlessly fascinating. The line of her profile is extraordinary. Her eyes can flash from flirty to fatal with the bat of a lash. Her expressions, whether pouty, seductive or simply blank--onto which the viewer can write anything--are ample evidence that Louise Brooks was born for a love affair with the lens. While Brooks and Hollywood never hit it off, that face and the camera hit it off right away.
  When you watch Brooks in PANDORA'S BOX, you are a voyeur, watching a great love affair between a camera and a soul.

  Blessed with beauty beyond measure, Brooks said, perhaps because of that beauty, that she was seen ""in Hollywood...(as) a pretty little flibbertigibbet whose charm for the executive department decreased with every increase in my fan mail."" Savagely nonconformist--after appearing in 13 movies within the studio system that were, to her keenly intelligent mind, no more than fluff--she walked out on Paramount chief Budd Schulberg. She left for Germany in response to director G.W. Pabst's call to star her in PANDORA'S BOX.
  Leaving Hollywood behind, she crossed an ocean and walked into screen history.
  ""In Berlin,"" Brooks would later say,""I stepped to the station platform to meet Mr. Pabst and became an actress.""

  It was, she said, ""as if Mr. Pabst had sat in on my whole life and career and knew exactly where I needed assurance and protection.""

  The result of that assurance and protection is on the screen in aces. With skin of alabaster---as if illuminated from within---Brooks is Lulu, the good-time girl, the prostitute who flits from affair to affair, blending ammorality and innocence, blithely unaware of the tragedies she leaves in her wake. That is, until her world crumbles. Convicted of murder, she flees the courtroom in the ensuing fracas. From there, we follow her to the final moments of her life. Brooks herself described the final scene in PANDORA'S BOX this way: ""It is Christmas Eve, and she is about to receive the gift that has been her dream since childhood: death by a sexual maniac.""

  When the Cinematheque Francaise in Paris held a Louise Brooks retrospective in 1955, founder Henri Langlois, standing in front of a huge banner emblazoned with Brooks's image, exclaimed to the crowd: ""There is no Garbo. There is no Dietrich. There is only Louise Brooks!""

  Many have asked whether Louise Broooks was a great artist or only a dazzling creature whose beauty traps the viewer into attributing complexities to her of which she is unaware? But complex she was and that projects onto the screen as well. A reader of Schopenhauer, Proust and other writers rarely found in the bookcases of Hollywood stars, she also is said to have had a marvelous voice and could have returned to Hollywood in the age of sound pictures and had a glorious career. But she grew tired of making movies---""tired of doing the same thing over and over""---and made her last film at the age of 32.

She devoted her later years to painting and writing essays on Hollywood with a frankness of opinion, a lucidity in her observation of people and a habit of speaking her mind with total candor. But she finally gave up her writing; without mincing words, she wrote to a friend on a Christmas card: ""I shall write no more. Writing the truth for readers nourished on publicity rubbish is a useless exercise.""  --- Hoyt Harris",1170979200,12,4025,4.856515373352855
2642045,4,B000HT3QBO,"There is no argument that Louise Brooks was a galvanizing presence during her relatively brief movie career, and no one knew how better to capture her mercurial personality and timeless beauty than German director G.W. Pabst. Certainly the deluxe royal treatment given this silent classic in the double-disc 2006 Criterion Collection DVD package would portend a masterpiece, but due to a combination of factors, the 1929 film just misses its mark. Part of the challenge is the deliberate pacing and extensive 133-minute running time. Based on two plays by Frank Wedekind, ""Erdgeist"" and ""Die Bchse der Pandora"", the screenplay by Pabst, Joseph Fleisler and Ladislaus Vajda is refreshingly frank in its treatment of sexual ambiguity and promiscuity and provides intriguing insight into the social decadence of Weimar Germany. At the same time, the film keeps its epic length focused on the whims and travails of an amoral, rather unsympathetic showgirl/prostitute named Lulu, and the net effect can be somewhat enervating in spite of the potent combination of Pabst's creative vision and Brooks' charisma.

The plot begins with Lulu leading a comfortable life as the mistress of newspaper mogul Dr. Peter Schn. A vivacious and unapologetic flirt, she also tantalizes Schn's nave son Alwa and the mannish Countess Geschwitz, but she becomes determined to marry Peter when he announces his engagement to the respectable daughter of a government official. As she readies to take the stage in a musical revue, she jealously throws a temper tantrum to prevent Peter from marrying, an overlong episode that exposes his lustful feelings for Lulu in front of his fiance. Through this twist of fate, Lulu becomes socially prominent, but fate deals harshly with her as she is arrested for murder and sentenced to prison. She manages to escape to a gambling boat where shorn of her famous pageboy bob, she is blackmailed and then winds up walking the streets of London where she eventually meets her destiny.

As Lulu, the stunning Brooks is credible as a tart though not quite to the Shakespearean degree demanded by the story. She has moments of enigmatic power when Pabst's vision becomes palpable, but she never quite transcends the tawdry dimensions of the story. Her severe coquettish look has inspired subsequent generations of actresses from Liza Minnelli in ""Cabaret"" to Drew Barrymore in ""Fever Pitch"". The supporting cast is filled with typically excessive performances, in particular, Carl Goetz as the gargoyle-like pimp Schigolch and Alice Roberts as the smitten Countess. The expressionistic look of the film adds invaluably to the story's emotionalism thanks to Gnther Krampf's striking cinematography and Andrej Andrejew and Gottlieb Hesch's modernist sets. The first disc has a satisfactory print with some overexposure evident at key moments.

There is an informative if rather academic commentary track by film scholars Thomas Elsaesser and Mary Anne Doane. You can listen to their comments or select among four different musical scores (although the orchestral accompaniment tends to be too overpowering). On the second disc are three solid documentaries - an hour-long 1998 TCM biography, ""Louise Brooks: Looking for Lulu"", narrated by Shirley MacLaine; a new feature, ""Shadow of My Father"", where Pabst's son Michael discusses his father's idiosyncratic filmmaking techniques; and a fascinating 48-minute interview with a particularly tough-minded Brooks produced a year before her death in 1985 by filmmaker Richard Leacock and Susan Steinberg Woll. The best extra is the 98-page booklet which includes noted film writer Kenneth Tynan's 1979 New Yorker essay, ""The Girl with the Black Helmet"", which launched Brooks' renaissance.",1170633600,10,3741,5.3805460750853245

I now have the R2 euro release from Second Sight, which I bought due to its addition of the 'Looking For Lulu' documentary, as well as the Korean import (all region), which was my first acquire (and preferred, due to its better score, IMHO). Please note: I have an extensive Criterion collection, but I have not paid collector's prices for any one of them. I do still relish acquiring a classic film, even if from a lesser source. . .  Oh, I guess I should comment on the quality of these two releases. BOTH are more than watchable, are quite clean -but not pristine-: the R2 has German OR English intertitles, and the 'Lulu' doc,; the Korean release has German intertitles with yellow English subs. Korean subtitles can be removed.
(and RE: multi-region player: I spent $60 for one here - an LG - that did the job just fine for BFI's 'Napoleon', a release that is NOT available in this country in Region 1 format. Initially bought this player just to experience this one magnificent and historic film. Was more than worth it . . .)",1519171200,,1458,4.380073800738008

8141287,5,B000HT3QBO,"The story is timeless and still holds your attention today. I was amazed as to how modern the film is its self. Probably the best know of G.W. Pabst's works. Being a film from the silent era gives this film a collector's value; yet five minutes into viewing and you do not realize it is silent.

LuLu (Louise Brooks) an amoral entertainer in 1928 Berlin, is having fun taking men for all they have and snubbing those that may care for her. After moving to London she is still in the habit of entertaining men at her place. She is about to open Pandora's Box as she has no idea who she has lured up to her place.

If you are looking for an ending with a moral statement you will be disappointed as it is more of a Quid pro quo.

If it is not already included on the media you picked for this film there is an available separate documentary Produced in 1998 for Turner Classic Movies called ""Looking for Lulu"", narrated by Shirley MacLaine, which is almost as interesting as this film.",1506902400,25,983,4.302702702702702

8141289,2,B000HT3QBO,"Pandora's Box, the movie is excellent.  Louise Brooks is sensational.

That said, this review concerns the Criterion Collection's quality control over their ""publication"" (their word) of the movie.  Specifically, their digital enhancement/transfer of the movie.  Criterion Collection movies are expensive.  They, generally, take older, often out of print movies; restore them to their original (often the director's desired) format; enhance them via a high definition digital transfer; provide some, generally, superficial ""extras"" as well as a slip case and then sell them for $30 to $40.  Some times, the Criterion Collection version is the only version available.  Generally they do a good job (excepting the silly extras).  Not this time.

The digital enhancement on Pandora's Box is terrible; it's so bad that it becomes a nagging annoyance to your enjoyment of the film.  The digital enhancement fades in and out during each and every scene, throughout the entire movie.  Portions of the frame are enhanced with the remainder of the frame being soft focus and then the enhanced portion slips into soft focus.  Also some times the soft focus slips into enhancement?  I can understand that it can be difficult to enhance a film, given the director's and cameraman's manner of photographing the film; however, this version of Pandora's Box does NOT satisfy due to the Criterion Collection's failed digital enhancement.

I watched Alexander Nevsky prior to watching Pandora's Box and it was flawless (the digital enhancement).  I watched Inherit the Wind after watching Pandora's Box and it too was flawless.  All three were digitally enhanced, black and white movies.  It's not my TV; it's not my DVD player - it's the Criterion Collection's crappy digital enhancement of Pandora's Box.  Avoid.",1432771200,,1797,5.334519572953736
8141290,5,B000HT3QBO,"I already had this film on VHS and on DVD but when I saw there was a Criterion release there wasn't any real debate about getting it again.  I fell in love with Pandora's Box (and obviously with Louise Brooks) when I first saw this on BBC back in the 1980's.  I have watched it countless times since and have often experimented with new soundtracks (usually Orbital it has to be said) so I was really buying this edition for the extras.  And they are excellent - the accompanying booklet could be released as a book on the film by itself.  Kenneth Tynan's very long article is a great read largely as it centres around an interview with the actress herself.  Lulu in Berlin is entirely an interview with Brooks performed by Richard Leacock (himself a legend in documentary film) in 1984 and Looking For Lulu is a solid enough documentary narrated by Shirley MacLaine - although I did feel it was a bit rushed at one hour.
The print quality is as perfect as you'd expect from Criterion who also go the extra mile by providing no less than FOUR scores.  As any silent film fan (me) will tell you the accompanying soundtrack is a huge part of the viewing experience, so effectively here you have four different versions of the film.  Dig out Orbital's Insides and you could have five - or may be that just works for me!",1430438400,,1316,4.435684647302905

8141292,5,B000HT3QBO,"""Pandora's Box"", a silent film made when ""talkies"" were just coming into vogue in 1929, was not very successful at the box office.  Still it has come to be regarded as an essential film, and perhaps the first truly ""modern"" movie.

There are various reasons for the film's status.  The film's director, G.W. Pabst, was renowned for his fascination with feminine psychology, and his ability to work sympathetically with actresses.  In these aspects, he early on succeeded in some of the same territory that Ingmar Bergman explored so brilliantly, decades later.

He built the story of ""Lulu"" on Frank Wedekind's character.  Wedekind, too, embraced Freudian ideas about repression and female psychology.  Reportedly, his character of Lulu grew in part out of an encounter with Lou Andreas Salome, an associate of Nietzsche, Rilke, and Freud, and herself an icon of early feminism.

So, in ""Pandora's Box"" we get a convergence of artists who are concerned with the emergence of a ""new woman"".  And then Pabst had the fortune of finding Louise Brooks, a free spirit out of the depths of staid, Victorian Kansas.  Brooks was perfect for this movie.  She was an iconic beauty and a trained dancer (Brooks said that Pabst as a director ""choreographed scenes""...they worked together beautifully).  Pabst as a director was turning away from expressionism and toward naturalism.  Louise Brooks, who once said that she ""basically played herself"" in films, knew how to convey everything in a look, gesture, and movement.  ""Pandora's Box"", one of the last silent movies,  reaffirmed the primacy of the image to film... the frame that embeds in the mind more deeply than words ever could.

""Pandora's Box"" was modern in that it was one of the first psychological dramas, paving the way for things like ""Citizen Kane"", and hinging on the emerging liberated woman.  That's why it still speaks to contemporary audiences, and why it will continue to be revered.

Barry Paris' biography of Louise Brooks provided me with many of these insights, within a brilliant chapter on ""Pandora's Box"".  Seeing the film made me want to seek out information on Brooks.  I think it probably has that effect on many who encounter it for the first time.  If there is any modern actress who comes close to the kind of physicality and naturalness that Brooks projected, it would probably be Juliet Binoche.  Brooks turned down an offer to star in ""Public Enemy"" with James Cagney, and turned away from Hollywood.  Nevertheless, ""Pandora's Box"" etched her name in film history.",1408579200,2,2540,5.023923444976076
