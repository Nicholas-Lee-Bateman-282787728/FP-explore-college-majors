1178498,5,B000003KH7,"I saw this film while I had first entered high school way back when. This movie holds a special place in my heart. The film was told through the eyes of Neil Klugman (Richard Benjamin). I know he was enraptured by the lovely Brenda Patimkin (Ali MacGraw) but I also knew he had another eye on the success of her family. I know that I had my eye on Ali MacGraw. At that time in my life she was the epitome of poise, grace and beauty. The way I see this film it is about two lovers or would-be lovers that never seem to be on the same page. Benjamin is genuinely attracted to MacGraw but does she really like him or is he just a convenient partner for her sexual coming of age? Is she just using him? Then there is a change. By the end of the film you wonder if the message is that you make the bed that you sleep in. I read Phillip Roth's novel after I had seen the film. I thought the scene in both the film and novel where Brenda and Neil first meet was heartfelt and magical. However, the most memorable scene in the entire film is between Ali MacGraw and Jack Klugman (Mr. Patimkin, Brenda's dad) at the wedding. Jack Klugman gave an excellent performance throughout this film. But in this wedding scene you can really feel a father trying to protect his daughter from the worldliness of life and if only he could really be there all the time for her to help ease her pain. This film may look dated but for me it is eternal.",1004832000,49,1427,4.136690647482014

1178500,4,B000003KH7,"'Goodbye Columbus' has been compared to 'The Graduate': it's another late-60s study of an aimless, young Jewish graduate disillusioned by the time-honoured, soul-destroying route to success - conformity.
It is certainly a very enjoyable romantic comedy that deserves to be better known.  It is more sympathetic to its young hero than the more famous film, without sentimentalising him or over-looking the fact that his integrity could simply be moral cowardice or immaturity.
Neal Klugman as an individual is always contrasted with groups - his family, Brenda's family, his work environment, the wider Jewish community.  He finds there is no such thing as individualism, that people are tied down to, and dependent on, families and work, quashing their own dreams and desires.  At the wedding, Neal is faced, in the midst of raucous gaiety, with a host of unhappy men who sold out.  But these men have roots, a community, that he is always excluded from; and he doesn't even seem to have dreams like the young boy who stares at Gauguin reproductions in the library every day - 'Man, that is the life'.
What makes 'Goodbye Columbus' so enjoyable, however, is the surprising chemistry between Richard Benjamin and the usually inert Ali McGraw.  The sense of a long, lazy summer romance is beautifully captured, with the restrained use of jumpcuts and visual tricks giving a kind of urgency to the uncertain romance.  This is a film that celebrates the private moments cocooned from the wider, public picture: the giggling, the frustrations, the tantrums, the great sex, the epiphany of a young woman skinny-dipping at night, the farce of a young man's premature expression of his desire in a car, outside the house of his lover and her disapproving parents.",999734400,14,1755,5.055363321799308

1178502,5,B000003KH7,"Ali McGraw is distant and beautiful as the spoiled gal that seemingly has it all. Dick Benjamin gives a very controlled and superb performance as the  guy who falls for Brenda Potemkin.
Its sexy for its time, Its alluring,  its true to life and its heartbreaking because we know that girls like  ""that"" do not really want male librarians for a mate. Or do  they?
After some verbal dueling Brenda and Neil are walking and Neil says  "" Well is our ""date"" over""?  Brenda: I don't want to  have a date now"" she turns away in a beguiling way and mumbles her  phone number so that Neil can barely hear it and runs off.

1178593,4,B000003KH7,"This felt like a time capsul of 1970. The clothing, music, furniture, attitudes are dated in a fun way. I hoped they would follow through about the boy that visits the library and the racism he encounters but maybe the book has more to say about it. It's something I would watch again and think I would get even more out of it.",1425686400,,327,4.2063492063492065
1178594,4,B000003KH7,"I first watched ""Goodbye Columbus"" in July of 1970 at the U.S. Army Overseas Replacement Station at Fort Dix, NJ. I was headed across the Pacific, like so many other guys in those days.  I liked the movie but loved Ali MacGraw! But through all that intervening time, I never saw ""Goodbye Columbus"" again until now (Winter, 2015). No, I did not pine over Ali in Southeast Asia! Maybe I should have.

I still believe ""Goodbye Columbus"" revolves around her. True, the supporting cast is fine but she stands out. This is the basic nice Jewish boy (Richard Benjamin) meets nice Jewish girl, boy falls in love with girl plot. There are some class issues but this reviewer feels they are minor. The two make a nice couple. There is a big fancy Jewish wedding here and viewers should watch closely. It says here that the ending is subtly telegraphed during the ceremonies.

That's important because ""Goodbye Columbus"" has a very stark and sudden close. There is an almost visceral slamming of the door. No plot spoilers here-viewers will just have to watch this nice movie for themselves. Previous reviewers have complained that the studio removed some Ali nude scenes just to secure a ""PG"" rating. What on earth for? In protest, one star is deducted from the rating above. If the studio wanted to cut they could have deleted that Association sound track!  GC is the best chance for movie fans to appreciate a ravishing Ali MacGraw in her Spring.",1422576000,,1438,4.717131474103586

She is young, sleek and beautiful as the Jewish American Princess Brenda Patimkin. Jack Klugman is also great as her father.

1178643,5,B000003KH7,"Beyond all else, Goodbye Columbus is a meditation on how the divisions of class surmount all others. The two young people are the same race, the same age, and the same religion, but their class differences make their relationship impossible. Neil works in a library, has just been discharged from the Army, and lives with his aunt and uncle who are one generation removed from the shtetl. He has more in common with Brenda's father, who appears to be a successful self-made businessman from a humble background - his brothers are shown as still scrabbling desperately for a buck. Brenda can still remember ""when we were poor"" when she shows Neil the old furniture in the attic, while her younger sister is oblivious to this history. Julie at least has the excuse of youth - the mother seems to have willfully forgotten their origins.

Neil reveals himself to be a Holden Caulfield, unwilling to commit himself to what he sees as the phony, superficial rat race with its alienation and empty rewards. Brenda, on the other hand, is perfectly complacent and satisifed with swimming at the country club, playing tennis, and getting her nose ""fixed."" The diaphragm episode reveals their fundamental differences. Brenda doesn't give a thought to getting pregnant, confident in the belief that nothing bad can happen, and if it does, it can be easily remedied. Neil, however, lives in the real world where unwanted children are a real danger. Brenda gets the diaphragm to allay Neil's fears, then absent-mindedly leaves it at home where her mother finds it. Her explanation makes no sense - the truth is that she really didn't think about it at all. Neil's reaction is not so much to her getting caught as to her attitude - to Brenda's confidence that her parents will take care of everything, and in this case, ""take care"" of Neil by making it impossible for him to continue to see her. The big difference is that in Neil's world, nothing will be ""taken care of"" unless he does it himself.

From centuries of historical conflict, we tend to think that the significant differences are race, religion, and nationality. However, within particular societies, the greatest differences are those of class. I've met Brenda's and Neil's counterparts from all over the world, from the unlikeliest places, and have seen how surprisingly similar people from the same class are, despite other differences. This is a fact that no one wants to discuss. The recent spread of the Occupy movement and the ""99%"" briefly made this a hot topic, but not for long - it's already faded. Maybe now is the time for a remake of this significant film - this time, without the 1970s ""psychedelic"" gimmicks.",1402704000,4,2672,4.857456140350878

Movie is very parellel to social differences between two very different caste systems.

1178739,3,B000003KH7,"Bought this because I was unable to find it at any of the few remaining ""brick & board"" retail stores remaining in business in San Francisco that sell these items.  The price was hefty, as it looked to be ""out of print"" & in high demand.  The film is a romp, a sort of critical look by American Jewish screenwriters & filmakers  @ a slice of their own culture-framed by a story line that displays what it's like for a young boy coming from a poor family to fall in love with a young girl from a family with a higher social standing.  Seeing Richard Benjamin & Ali Magraw in the prime of their youth is a plus, but the funny & silly situations that hover in the background seem to serve a purpose of sending messages that this relationship is doomed & not meant to be.  The viewer does not get an absolute answer to this question, in the end, the poor boy from the Bronx makes it clear that he is not ready for marriage, and the ""pampered Jewish princess"" (that's what it says on the liner notes, I didn't invent this!) is just as unready & has been put on notice by her parents that she's to be shunned by the family for losing her virginity before marriage.  In today's world, this may seem quaint.  But then, in the not so distant past, this  was a huge issue, and not many young, adult children have anything in their background to prepare them for parental rejection.  Thus, the film ends, the beauty & hope of the romance has turned grimy, and the future bleak, and the credits roll.  We never know if they re-establish their relationship, or break it off and move on with their lives.  So, after the time spent in joy of two pretty people having a beautiful & fun romance, we are left with a sadness that the world they lived in was not ready for them.  While the focus is upon Jewish culture, it could just have easily been poor Methodist boy meets rich Episcopalian girl, with more or less the same dynamics.  Therefore, this pie, this cultural pie, is really universal in nature--a poor person going out of one's class to marry, and the shame brought upon a family by a member who breaks the rules, especially female children.  Double standards go beyond all these ""cultural"" boundaries.  It was a sort of The Graduate Lite of it's time.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goodbye-Columbus/dp/B0001WTWNI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goodbye, Columbus</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goodbye-Columbus/dp/B0001WTWNI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goodbye, Columbus</a>",1328918400,7,2550,4.995271867612293

1178743,5,B000003KH7,"The title of this review is from the movie poster, one of the few tag lines of any poster for any movie I've ever remembered, but it caused such curiousity in me, I had to go see the movie. The poster showed a virginal girl smelling a perfect rosebud and the line was because father's never know for sure what their adult kids are up to. They just want to hope that their kids never have sex and become as tainted and spoiled as the rest of the world. You know, being a virgin is like being a brand new car; being promiscuous is like being a very used rental car!

I saw this one in my very early 20's, just going out into life as confused about love and sex as everyone else. I for sure didn't know about the cruel ""games"" people play on each other, but I found out just by living. I found this movie to be a sort of roadmap to get through life.

I fell in awe of Ali just like everyone else. She seemed perfect physically, but what I really loved was her total confidence in life and around people and her F.U. attitude. I think I must have gone back several times to see this amd study it. I would  have given it 3 stars in the late 60's because there was so much cinematic competition, but nearly 40 years later, it has a bit of genius in depicting human nature and compared to the poor quality of movies nowadays it's a little gem.

Brenda's parents are nouvo riche (newly rich, not OLD money), but behave like a bunch of crude blue collar workers at times, a little too crude for the upscale neighborhood they've moved into. Michael Myers who portrayed Brenda's brother was not an actor, this was his first role and he nailed it like an old pro! He had said he took the role to finance his college education to become a physician which he did.

Of course Richard Benjamin can do no wrong. He nails every character he takes on. My favorite of his ""Diary of a Mad Housewife."" We don't see enough of him.

The only weak scene in the movie was the wedding scene where Mr. Patimkin is talking to Brenda and she is supposed to break down and cry. Well, as everyone found out, Ali McGraw can't ACT! Only her eyebrows and nostrils do. She was trying darned hard to dredge up those tears, but it only came across like she was faking an orgasm. It was painful and embarrassing to watch. The scene would have worked better had they not made it one complete, uncut scene, and instead cut away and sprayed something that stings into her eyes to get those tears there faster. I'm sure Jack Klugman, who's a consummate pro, was wondering how long that scene was going to take.

I just found the book tucked away in a corner of my collection and I'm reading it now. The movie is almost an exact copy so far, but it's extrememly well written. I highly recommend the book too.

A Classic for sure!",1228867200,4,2785,4.241509433962264
1178744,2,B000003KH7,"My mom had told me about this movie recently, I remembered seeing it as a kid.  The title came across my list of Movies To See and I decided to give it a whirl.  I found the material dated, unrealistic and rather annoying.

Richard Benjamin plays a middle class library employee in New York state who meets Ali MacGraw, one of the most beautiful women of all time, at a country club swimming pool one summer day.  He falls for the siren (and who wouldn't with her gorgeousness) and they begin a happy, carefree summer romance.  Of course her parents, upper class and Jewish who had risen up thanks to MacGraw's father's plumbing business, do not approve.  When alone, they assure each other ""She'll get tired of him"", and ""It won't last"".  MacGraw doesn't seem very serious about much of anything at this point in life, Benjamin doesn't seem to have much of a plan either, and it should be lite, airy and fun.  Which it very much is.

If it was left at that, I would have been happy.  Add her whiney little sister into the equation for a comic relief and it turns into a bad experience.  The brother is in it only to provide some background for the title (he goes to Ohio State).  The parents have some moments together as well as seperately (such as the scene where her father is telling MacGraw that he will always love and sheild her from how precarious life can be).  The part I didn't like was when Benjamin suddenly finds out that MacGraw isn't taking her birth control pills because they make her feel fat.  Now in real life, I can understand this.  But, she is so shallow and foolish that she will REALLY not take her pills but she will indulge in unprotected sex?!?  Then again, even though we're nearly done with the first decade of the 2000s, I never cease to be amazed that girls do not protect themselves.  But where is the consequence?  If this movie was made today, MacGraw would end up pregnant.  Which she doesn't in this movie.

The ending?  Well, I understood it.  The reaction of the parents is a little dated.  They found her diaphram in a dresser drawer and wrote some kind of angry letter to MacGraw telling her that they were disappointed.  Benjamin leaves, knowing that this could never be.  Times were different then.  Nowdays parents would or should be happy that their children are protecting themselves.  Maybe they would be disappointed that their kids were having sex, but they might feel powerless to stop it.  This dates the film.  And it shows.",1217203200,2,2478,4.530474040632054
1178745,3,B000003KH7,"I think that I have only seen this movie twice in my entire lifetime and I
could barely remember any of it. So I rented the dvd and I must say that I
really enjoyed it. Some of the neighborhoods looked familiar(I've lived in
the Bronx for over thirty years)and I would love to know where in the Bronx it was filmed because I love that library!
The ending of this film has always left me a bit puzzled; but I would love to have had ""Brenda's"" carefree life for just one day. Seeing this movie really took me back, and I actually found it strange not to see a single cell phone. I hope I passed the audition. Peace.",1209600000,2,613,4.116666666666666
1178746,4,B000003KH7,"Goodbye, Columbus seems on the surface like a sweet, inconsequential tale.  And maybe that's all it is.  But reading it tapped some really nice pleasure zone in me that made me feel good while and after I read it.  Who's to argue with that?

Part of its specialness was that as a young man I worked in Newark near the Library in the same general time period as this novel.  I didn't much like the regimented boredom of adult life and responsibility, so I used to frequent the library (even when I was supposed to be busily working at Prudential Insurance Company) where the protagonist of Goodbye, Columbus worked.  I was able to remember the marble staircase and the main reading room fondly and vividly based on Roth's evocative descriptions.

The book is hard to analyze and critique.  It has lots of humorous and charming characters; everyone is a little kooky and flawed, just as in real life.  But there is no evil to be seen anywhere.

The romantic plot just drifts along in a realistic way, and the hero is almost transparent, featureless, better allowing the reader to directly enter into the experience themselves.  I rarely give 5 stars, but would to this book, except that I wonder if part of my especial appreciation of it was based on how well it evoked my own similar Jewish girlfriend and Newark experiences.",1201478400,,1324,4.663793103448276
1178747,5,B000003KH7,"Watching ""Goodbye, Columbus"" for the first time I flashed back to my sophomore year at Temple University when I was still undeclared.  I took an American Lit class taught by an inspiring professor whose name unfortunately escapes me.  His course offerings were a veritable stew of literary styles.  I recall reading Henry James' ""Daisy Miller"" which spawned an underrated film by Peter Bogdanovich.  I also recall reading Thomas Berger's ""Neighbors"" starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd that was generally reviled by the critics(I liked it, though).  My impressions of ""Goodbye, Columbus"" is it is painstakingly faithful to Philip Roth's novella.  Your opinion of the film I think depends on how much you liked the book.  I like the film and the book.  My only quibble here is that the principal actors, though ideally cast, may have been a tad too old for their parts.  Richard Benjamin is superb as the Bronx librarian returning from a stint in the Army only to fall head over heels with a girl whose value system he finds contemptible.  Ali MacGraw gives a sympathetic account of the spoiled preppie because you feel that she acts the way she does only because she's been programmed to do so.  The attraction between the two is more than physical.  Despite their protestations, Neil and Brenda possess character traits that the other finds desirable.  The question you ask will the pull of their respective social classes accept this relationship or find it unacceptable and pull Neil and Brenda apart.  The film is rich in Jewish color but the scenario that unfolds here could apply to any tightknit ethnic group.  A real gem has been made here from a fine literary source.",1186099200,10,1678,4.900709219858156
1178768,4,B000003KH7,"First, the film which was written and set in Newark, New Jersey and Livingston, New Jersey was replaced by the Bronx, New York and Westchester County, New York. The characters remain the same but the setting which I always find crucial in Roth's stories are often disregarded in favor of something more familiar.

Brenda and Neil come from two different worlds. Richard Benjamin and Ali McGraw are both excellent as the young couple and make an impressive film debut in this film. Surprisingly, Susan Lucci has an uncredited role in the film. Nan Martin and Jack Klugman are excellent as Brenda's upscale parents.

Just because Neil and Brenda are Jewish, doesn't mean that they don't have problems. They do because Neil is a poor Bronx librarian living with his aunt and uncle while Brenda is rich and lives in Westchester county with a housekeeper and multiple telephones in the house, a rarity in those days.

The story remains intact but I would like to see Philip Roth talk about his novel made into a film. I think the author speaking out would have made me want to give five stars instead of four.",1176595200,,1104,4.709844559585492
1178769,4,B000003KH7,"I first saw this movie on HBO around 1990 and immediately took to it.  It provides great insight into Jewish social sensibilities in Greater New York during the 1950s.  The 2 principal actors, Richard Benjamin and Ali MacGraw, are well-suited for their respective roles.  In the midst of a July-September romance, Neil and Brenda expose various prejudices, while trying to conform to expectations placed on them by their parents and by society.  We all know that a rich Daddy's princess from Briarcliff Manor wouldn't really develop a serious romance with a poor boy from the Bronx, but it is still interesting to see her go through the motions.  When the academic year returns, Brenda finds a convenient way to drop Neil without saying so much.  This leaves her free to go back to Radcliffe to continue pursuing her MRS. degree.",1174780800,,829,4.885714285714286
1178770,2,B000003KH7,"I remember seeing this movie in the late 1960's and thought it a decent comedy. However with the perspective of some 40 years, I now find it trivial. That is, a wandering aimless sequence of dated cliche's. Perhaps Roth's novel would fare better. Even Jack Klugman, who would normally dominate a scene, seems laid back. At the same time as I purchased this film, I also purchased ""Lovers and Other Strangers."" The latter has certainly withstood the test of time and I would recommend it highly for someone who wants to see a good comedy.",1169596800,,537,4.663157894736842

1178772,3,B000003KH7,"A splendid film for a lot of reasons. The Phillip Roth novel from which the film was adapted supplies unusually good dialogue for the script and an excellent structure on which the director can hang visual and audio elements that meaningfully support the story. Check out how well the musical score shifts to support the mood of each scene. Then there is an excellent cast.

The title is a reference to the brother, a basketball player at Ohio State in Columbus, who frequently listens to an OSU sports commentary that signs off with ""Goodbye Columbus"". And the song lyrics ""Hello life, goodbye Columbus"" relate to leaving the protection of home/school to face the world.

Although ""Goodbye Columbus"" is usually thought of as the ""The Graduate"" with a different ending, it is much more like ""Adam at 6AM"". The three films were made at the very end of the 1960's, all had a searching young man as their main character, and all revolved around a new romantic relationship. But in ""Goodbye Columbus"" and ""Adam"" the tension is not between different generations but between different backgrounds and values. In both the young man eventually realizes that these differences cannot be overcome and both films go out with shots of him leaving.

The soundtrack album featuring ""The Association"" (and incidental music composed by Charles Fox) was probably the kiss of death for that group's credibility whatever their musical merits. While cool to be part of an outside film like ""Easy Rider"", it was uncool to be associated with a Hollywood product like ""Goodbye Columbus"". This was the summer of Woodstock and by then ""The Association"" had pretty much lost their audience. In addition to the title song they contributed ""It's Gotta Be Real"" and ""So Kind To Me.""

It's two most famous scenes have held up very well: the montage of Ali MacGraw swimming during the title sequence and the comical wedding guests ""pig-out"" at the buffet table.

The cinematography is first-rate and while the widescreen DVD showcases this, the original theatrical release  has been trimmed of its most explicit material, it was probably done originally for broadcast television. As on some of the VHS versions, entire sequences have been deleted including the critical first sex sequence where birth control methods are discussed (foreshadowing) and the sequence with the rationale for his moving in with the family for two weeks. Also missing is all the vaguely graphic elements dealing with her initial refusal to have sex. If you are a first time viewer watching a sanitized version, and find puzzling narrative gaps in the story, or incomplete motivational explanations, the trimming is the reason.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1112745600,50,2720,5.015521064301552
1178773,5,B000003KH7,"Sadly, it was a matter of timing. On September 10, 1969, two films opened on the same day. One was ""Midnight Cowboy, the other was ""Goodbye, Columbus."" Both films were aimed at the young college crowd and the managers of the two theatres in our town which played the respective films made a bet on which one would outdraw the other. ""Midnight Cowboy"" won by a landslide and ""Goodbye, Columbus"" limped out of town. That was too bad, for ""Goodbye, Columbus"" was a great film, worthy of success. The story of a poor Jewish boy from the Bronx (Richard Benjamin) falling in love with a rich Jewish princess (Ali McGraw) from the suburbs, was one of author Phillip Roth's most popular stories. The film is rich in detail and atmosphere and is hilarious in many scenes, while achingly dramatic in others. It was this juxtaposing of drama and comedy (ala ""The Comic"") that threw many viewers and critics off during their initial viewing. But seen more than once, this opposing chemistry comes together in a unique and satisfying manner.

The film is seen through the eyes of Benjamin, a down to earth, unpretentious fellow, who is thrown into the rich excessive world of surburbia. Ali McGraw, in her first film role, is perfect as the spoiled oldest child of a successful wholesale plumber (Jack Klugman), a man who built his business from the ground up and now spoils his children rotten.

While the lead characters, McGraw and Benjamin, handle most of the scenes, it is an unknown actor, Michael Meyers (No, not Austin Powers) as McGraw's, gangly, lug-nut basketball-star brother who steals the film. His nearly wordless scenes are hilarious as his body twitches, shifts and undulates with almost unnatural ease.  Watching Benjamin trying to do his lines with Meyers is almost as funny, as the veteran actor knows he is being had on camera by this unknown talent. The rest of the cast is superb, brash, loud and stressed to the max. The highlight is the wedding between McGraw's brother and his fianc, who is just as down to earth as Benjamin, but has seemingly made the adjustment to life within this zoo of a family.

This is a film that grows better with each viewing, a testament to its ability to bring both laughter and tears and a wonderful look into the world of class separation.",1109980800,13,2283,4.728643216080402
1178774,3,B000003KH7,"I loved this film when I first saw it. I must admit to being a fan of Richard Benjamin. I waited and waited for the film to be released on dvd and when it became available, I immediately ordered one. Imagine my HORROR when upon the initial viewing I realized that the studio had released an EDITED version on dvd!! I have never heard of such a thing. All of MacGraw's nude scenes have been severly cut to allow a PG rating as opposed to the original release which had an R rating. I absolutely HATE censorship. I don't care whether the cuts are of sex, violence or simply to shorten a film. I want to see a film as the director wished it to be seen. Is the movie still good? Yes, of course...but this release will always be tainted by the cuts the studio made to attain a wider audience. Shame, shame.",1092787200,69,801,4.207792207792208

A wonderful home, with all the clothes any young woman could want, a college education to die for, and a boyfriend that was so grown up and so perfect?  Alas, Brenda (Ali) had to find a reason to break up with Neil (Richard Benjamin), whether it was because he wasn't ambitious enough, or enough of a butt kisser to her uptight parents, or whatever...anyway, the summer weeks they spent together were the ultimate fantasy of a lot of us that were teens in the late 60's.  The soundtrack by the Association is so fitting...I love it!  My favorite scene is the wedding of Brenda's brother Ron, because a couple of years later, I attended a Greek Orthodox wedding that was so similar to this movie's Jewish wedding.  Dancing and food and just wonderful!  I have watched this many times on TV, and was so happy it finally came out on DVD.",1091923200,7,972,4.426966292134831
1178776,5,B000003KH7,"For years ""Goodbye Columbus"" has been an old movie favorite of mine, popping up sporatically on late night, broadcast television in various edited forms. I'm delighted, that this satirical 'slice of life', romantic-comedy (based on a novella by author, Phillip Roth) has now finally made it's appearence in the DVD format. The story is pretty simple. Neil Klugman (Richard Benjamin) is a guest at his Cousin, Doris' ritzy, country club. It is there, he catches sight of and is instantly attracted to the beautiful, Brenda Patimkin (Ali MacGraw). This poor young man from the Bronx asks out and starts dating the wealthy, spoiled girl from Westchester. We watch the relationship blossom over the course of the summer, as Neil falls in love with Brenda and gets involved with her crazy family. On the simplest level, this film is a satirical look at being young, Jewish and dating in 1960's suburbia. But it is also a film about being young and not knowing what you want out of life. Throughout the film, Neil is questioned repeatly about his low paying, Librarian's job and what his plans are. The truth is he dosn't really know. He dosn't want to ""grub his whole life away trying to make money"", yet he also finds the counter-culture answers of 1960's youth just as ridiculous. The film looks at the different view points on a variety of topics (sex, marriage, children, work) between baby boomers and the WWII generation, that came before them. This is all wrapped up in delicious satire, that pokes fun at Jewish life in suburbia (including, the most overly ostentatious wedding ever put on film). Director, Larry Peerce and Screen Writer, Arnold Schulman have created a wry movie, which is both humorus and inciteful. I love the scene where Brenda's father gives Neil a speech about the ""contempt"" that today's youth show for their elders. He pointly reminds Neil, that at one time he felt the same way. The casting for the film is also brillant. Actor, Richard Benjamin shines as the young man in love, who is trying to find his place in life as well as among Brenda's loud and obnoxious family. Ali MacGraw (in one of her first roles) is equally good as the spoiled, rich girl. But the cast member who really gives a memorable performance is actor Jack Klugman as Brenda's Father, Ben. He gives a great nuanced reading, showing us a father who works hard, loves his family and will do anything to make his daughter happy. The DVD itself has both good and bad points. The mastering of the picture is crytal clear, but the sound is only fair (but what do you expect from a 1969 film). The DVD is bare bones without any extras (not even a trailer). I would have loved to hear audio comentaries from either Bejamin or MacGraw. This is a great film comedy which makes for a wonderful evening of entertainment!

1178777,4,B000003KH7,"I saw this movie when it first came out in 1969 with my first real boyfriend.  Somehow, even though our situation was nothing like the one portrayed in the movie, I really identified with Neil & Brenda's relationship.  Maybe it was the intensity of the relationship, or maybe, I was just a silly 16 year old, ah youth!!!
Even though this movie is 35 years old, it still has a very contempoary feel, and there is a genuine chemistry between Ali McGraw & Richard Benjamin, which is a great credit to both Benjamin & the director of this film, because Ali McGraw is one of the world's worst actors.  I must admit, Ali was a beautiful girl, I was so jealous of her & her model skinny body.  She looked great in all those Villager & Bobbi Brooks outfits.
