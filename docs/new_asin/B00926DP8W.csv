5243191,5,B00926DP8W,"This is a short story that is full of LoveCraftian themes and horrors. It is an older film so the background and special effects are not as strong as current movies, but I found that it only enhanced the story.",1401926400,,210,4.275
5243192,3,B00926DP8W,"Sadly, typical of HPL stories made into movies.  It does have the one-two punch of Coombs and Crampton, but you can tell its an early one.  Nonetheless, for the serious Lovecraft fan who has heard about this film, but never saw it when it was aired, it is worth a watch or add it to the collection.",1399161600,,298,4.2105263157894735
5243193,4,B00926DP8W,I thought it was a bit too short.  Jeffrey Combs was great as the Evil Clergyman who committed suicide but his spirit/soul remained to reek havok on his girlfriend. David Warner was superb as one of his victims.  David Gale played a rat  with a human face who helped the Evil Clergyman with his schemes.,1393113600,,303,4.472727272727273
5243194,4,B00926DP8W,I've been waiting years to see this piece and was psyched to finally get the chance.  The picture and sound quality are not very good but it's worth it for the great David Warner levitating across the room and screaming like a banshee.  Go for it!,1383696000,2,247,4.3478260869565215
5243195,5,B00926DP8W,"To be honest, the film itself is OK, in my opinion its too short, but then again, it was only 1/3 of ""Pulse Pounders"" that got shelved/lost over 20 years ago :(. I am glad they finally found it and put it out! It was nice to see Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, and David Gale together again in a HPL story, though Mr. Gale's part was rather short and he was wearing a rat suit XD! On the bright side though he still had his way with Miss Crampton - some things never change ;). Just a fun film really, especially for fans of the Re-Animator cast and HPL in general, nothing too grand or special, but takes you back to the good old days of horror movies before all the CGI garbage they are shoveling out now. Well worth the money, I would make one last recommendation, before watching the film, please read HPL's original (very) short story, its a pretty groovy read and it will help make sense of what the film is showing you. I had read the story probably 20 plus years ago and of course forgot everything about it, I'm glad I re-read it, the movie made total sense.",1378512000,6,1068,4.240196078431373
5243196,2,B00926DP8W,"Rather than distributing the unreleased mid-80's anthology film PULSEPOUNDERS in its entirety, Charles Band decided to release each episode in the anthology on a separate DVD. This way he can get three times the amount from unaware customers. He advertizes this episode as ""remastered"", but don't believe it for one second. It's not remastered from film elements, but from a VHS master. Proceed at your own risk!",1373760000,5,412,5.164179104477612
5243197,5,B00926DP8W,"when you see a H.P. Lovecraft film.. you cannot go wrong by watching it... they are really great! when you have Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton in it... you have a great work of art. this film was made several decades ago and has been finally released to DVD. after having seen Reanimator with combs and crampton this was really over the top and fantastic. but The Evil Clergyman doesn't quite come up to reanimator, but is really not that bad of a movie. Basically this film is about a love story between a clergyman and beautiful woman. how far will one go when they love one another? A scene in the film that may have been censored was where barbara was laying on her bed and a small twisted rat/man kisses her butt... quite weird and utterly perverse. this scene has surely been cut but maybe sometime there will be a later un-cut version with the entire deleted scene. another film : The BeYond is quite entertaining and stars both combs and crampton... hopefully they have not retired from making more films.. one can only hope?",1371340800,3,1037,4.550802139037433

5243200,5,B00926DP8W,Every Combs and Crampton fan should enjoy this and it is painlessly short and the sets are rather unique.,1431043200,,105,4.578947368421052
5243201,3,B00926DP8W,The movie is interesting but the film quality is terrible. I gave it 3 stars because I like anything Lovecraft but I though about returning this as soon as I started watching it.,1422316800,,178,4.424242424242424
5243202,2,B00926DP8W,I WAS DISAPOINTED EXPECTED MORE STORY AND ACTION,1420588800,,48,5.125
5243203,4,B00926DP8W,What can I say? This is a small classic from an era we will never see again. Nice twist on the short story.  As is often the case this movie twists two completely different story lines into one. Not that I'm complaining because the chemistry between the two leads makes them the Spencer Tracy and Catherine Hepburn of trashy slasher gore bucket Lovecraft gems.,1416960000,,360,4.625
5243204,4,B00926DP8W,short but good the dark atmosphere was great in this movie Jeffrey Combs did a great job in this like always does,1414454400,,113,4.181818181818182
5243205,5,B00926DP8W,it was excellent,1413158400,,16,4.666666666666667
5243206,5,B00926DP8W,"Excellent version of this story by H.P. Lovecraft--presented from a VHS tape original and not standard movie film, but well worth seeing all the same--both acting, writing, and directing are well done.",1409443200,,201,5.3125
5243207,3,B00926DP8W,"After Stuart Gordon made a name for himself with ""Reanimator"" and ""From Beyond"", Charles Band saw opportunity in continuing to use Lovecraft properties as the basis for his features. Band then came up with the idea for an anthology of short sequels called ""Pulsepounders"" that was eventually shelved due to the financial troubles of his studio, Empire Pictures, which would eventually fold and give way to Full Moon.

25+ years later and we finally get to see Band's attempt at a Lovecraft film and the results are... um, interesting. The problem is that this short isn't much of a Lovecraftian story nor does it deal with any of the themes that preoccupied the author's stories. Instead, this more of a Lovecraft freestyle with various elements and iconography mixed in with the standard horror tropes. The film survives mostly on the strength of a small, dedicated cast that includes David Gale as a Brown Jenkins. Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton and David Warner acquit themselves nicely as well.

The best part of the film is the implied violence, sexual degradation and homosexuality that gives the proceedings an eerie quality. It's all VERY implied, but it's interesting at least. Be aware that the film is sourced from a VHS work, so image and sound are both pretty poor. This is definitely only for seasoned Lovecraft or movie fans.",1408752000,3,1341,4.955555555555556

8534650,4,B00926DP8W,"I like Charles Band movies but even I realize most of them are too long. For every solid movie he gets out the door with his production team like Trancers or the first Puppet Master, he produces numerous other boring movies that lead up to one pay off scene. Thankfully, with only 30 minutes to work in, his interests all have to collide in a single moment and it's a hilarious ode to immature males.

Jeffrey Combs plays a sexy pastor who might just be an evil clergyman. For some unknowable reason, Barbara Crampton is a horror writer who is in serious lust with him. So in lust, that molesting rat men, ghosts with grave warnings, and a mean old lady can't scare her off from heading up to a room in an obvious haunted place for some leg up action with Combs. You'd think that'd all be enough but nope way more crazy stuff goes down in the space of 28 minutes than I can list without spoiling all kinds of wacky stuff.

Everyone gives it their best here too. Combs does a hilariously fun version of sexy that he picked up from the Vincent Price ham store. Barbara Crampton is genuinely good here. She has to sell some stuff that is way harder to sell than most people probably realize like pretending to get molested by a rat man puppet. She does it. It's a shame she didn't get more work but at least these movies exist. Plus, she's been a career resurgence as of late. Everyone else is really good too.

As far as the Lovecraft influences go, it's all here. In fact, it works a lot better than most Lovecraft stuff because they keep things in check due to time and I'm assuming budget. Band doesn't have time to try and film an evil goat god in space. So, instead, you get much more manageable Lovecraftian threats. It's all for the best.

The movie is a rescue job. Because of that, it can look a little rough but it's good. I hope they release the other parts of this as it's part 1 of an anthology. Trancers 1.5 can't be anything other than gold.",1489449600,,1954,4.301630434782608

8534653,4,B00926DP8W,"I purchased this so I had it for my HPL collection.  It is a tad on the ""Boobs and beasts"" side of things, but it is still well done, and as usual, the actors are just some of the best.  Worth the price, and worth having to round out your collection.",1458518400,,250,3.8823529411764706
8534654,1,B00926DP8W,"I don't understand why people make so called ""Lovecraft"" movies which has nothing to do with him. Mr. H.P. Lovecraft wrote stories that were neither gory nor explicitly sexual. It has become routine in movies to use his name to get publicity and then put the ""formula"" to get dollars.",1451692800,2,284,4.7
8534655,5,B00926DP8W,Probably one the best H.P. Lovecraft adaption despite being 30 minutes long and Barbara Crampton is not nude in it .,1448150400,,116,4.571428571428571
