7931425,5,B000055ORT,After a five year absence from the screen Lana Turner returned in this older female star vehicle horror story in the Baby Jane mold ! It is wild ! Really probably for Lana Turner fans only.,1363996800,,189,4.277777777777778
7931426,2,B000055ORT,"My mom and I were big horror movie fans when I was growing up. We got this for 1 dollar I think...like sometime in the 80's or 90's and if you ask me, I think we paid 99 cents too much for it! This movie is TERRIBLE! The only reason my mom and I watched it more than once was to make fun of it and believe me when I say there is a lot of comedic material but for all the WRONG reasons! It was not intended as a comedy but if you like to make fun of movies it can be hilarious! It must be one of the worst movies ever. Bad plot, bad camera work, cheesy acting and it isn't even scary. It is about a newlywed couple and a psycho mother-in-law who has a thing for white cats named Sheba...And a cat graveyard for her dozens of dead cats who were all named ""Sheba"" as well...and soon we find out the reason for all the dead kitties...BOOWAHAHAHAHA!

If you are having a bad movie party this would certainly be a fine candidate. It might also be funny if you happen to have a psycho, cat-loving mother-in-law! Apart from that don't watch this. If you love animals or happen to belong to PETA, do NOT watch this for sure. The son drowning the poor cat in the bowl of milk is disturbing! I think whoever wrote this either had an Oedipus complex or had a nasty mother-in-law! I won't spoil the ending, though I doubt ""spoiling"" this travesty is possible. It is already as rotten as a year old carton of milk to begin with!

The only reason why I would ever give this monstrosity an extra star it has some ""So bad, it's good"" elements and also because I do have to admit...its ORIGINAL! I have never seen another movie like it and that is probably a good thing in this case! After seeing this you will probably react one of two ways: 1) You will say ""That was so bad it was hilarious!"" or you'll say, ""Too bad I can't drown this MOVIE in a bowl of milk!""",1264550400,,1845,4.079889807162535
