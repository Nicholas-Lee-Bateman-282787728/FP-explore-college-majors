2075890,5,B0002CH8C4,"La Tosca, a play written by the French playwright Sardou, was Produced in Paris in 1887. In 1889 Puccini saw the play,which he liked. Eventually, it became the opera we know. The original play had five acts and 23 characters. Puccini's opera has nine characters and is in three acts. He was only interested in the interaction between Scarpia,Tosca and Cavaradossi. The opera is set in June 1800,the time of the battle at Marengo, where Napoleon defeated the Austrian forces. The Libretto was written by Giuseppe Giacosa and Luigi Illica. The two worked as a team and were responsible for La Boheme, Tosca and Madame Butterfly. Illica made the prose sketch of the work and Giacosa then versified and polished it,with Puccini's input. Tosca's premiere  was in 1900 in Rome.

This version of Tosca sounds and looks like a play with singing and music. Set in the Period of 1800,the staging and costumes which are stunning are traditional. The centre piece is of the head ,shoulders and hand with a sword of Emperor Constantine,who first made Christianity a state religion. The symbolism shows the power of the Church and the state. In the Church service  the monks carry the cross and so forth. Cannons are used. I hope your neighbours are tolerant. In the second act, Scarpias desk is shown. The third act we are on the roof of the prison. This opera is staged in the huge open air arena at Verona,with what I call traditional minimalism sets. The orchestra and chorus of the Arena of Verona are conducted by Daniel Oren, passionate and fast tempo when required. Fiorenza Cedolins who is a singer actress, brings out the human character of Tosca,as opposed to the usual over the top rendition of the part.  Marcelo Alvarez is Cavaradossi. Scarpia sung by Ruggero Raimondi, is not the usual evil  police chief, but subtle,charming,sly,and ruthless. What is amazing is that all three are believable. On such a huge stage and theatre,this opera seems intimate. Usually it doesnt. Probably, because Raimondi and Cedolins are Italian, this makes a difference. All the parts fit the whole and works. As I stated it seems like a play, not a opera. The blu ray is amazing,probably one of my best. Worldwide.",1312329600,4,2196,4.8453333333333335
2075891,5,B0002CH8C4,"I think I can safely say that this is the best-known and best-loved opera of all (well - perhaps we must make a Trilogy of this, Butterfly and Turandot [not 100% Puccini], should be included. So placing another offering in the market-place is a risk. Some will find it too-oft performed. And for other's the Verona is not a satisfactory production venue.

When reviewing an opera, I look to see how well the characters and story come off. Quality of orchestra, chorus and conductor must have a unified presentation, along with settings,and, of course, the direction. Without these qualities, the world's top soloits can find themselves in a disaster

I am happy to say that all aspects unite in a production that holds no significant flaws to detract from the performance The skilled team of singers/actors, second-layer soloists, chorus, orchestra,  and, of course, conductor,designs and construction, excellent lighting, sound, camera work and editing, video direction -- all seem to unite in this quality, traditional version. Seeing it on the screen the cameras cn bring intimacy or grandeur. You will find one or two productions where Tosca sings slightly better. But ask yourself :is this a production to exhibit a famous singer or two, or is it a production that would satisfy Puccini's intention? To me, in the item under revew, yhe singing is uniformly good, but the unity of the performance is what make this Tosca shine.
The first thing that impressed me was the settings, ample space being available for the singers/actors to give an outstanding disc. There is something special about going to a live performance, but for me, with a large projection screen and a quality sound system; I can take my pick of what seems the best performance from around the world, and I would include this in that group -, and watch it in  ""you-are-there"") presentation in the comfort of home.

In this review you are not going to get any analysis of voice-production, etc., just s subjective response as to whether everything ""worked"".  And, as you will gather from the above, this performance really ""works"". There is no sense of being lost in the vast arena at all. And at this point, I can think of little more to say. If you want a good strong presentation of the opera, I would suggest you investigate this. If you want a production with a world-famous soprano overshadowing the opera itself, then look elsewhere.. I prefer to see/hear what the composer intended.

Final comment:Europe is brimming with opera companies and soloists, who don't want to travel too much. Consequently, many opera-lovers miss some wonderful prodoctions. If you are primarily interested in the totality of opera, investigate little-knwn (to us) worthwhile productions. Amazon usually stocks them.",1297900800,49,2773,5.028322440087146
2075892,3,B0002CH8C4,"The Arena di Verona is a spectacular venue seating an audience of 15,000 but its open air situation makes any musical ambience near impossible.  The orchestra is well recorded in DTS-HD audio but does sound flat because of this and the singers come through less intimately. The artistry is ok with Florenza Cedolins capturing a couple of nice moments in her role as Tosca but this traditional production is generally less than riveting. I feel there are better renditions of this opera to come on Blu Ray so this version cannot be enthusiastically recommended.",1255478400,31,560,4.957446808510638
2075893,5,B0002CH8C4,"This ""Tosca"" is a pure joy for the eyes and the ears. Daniella Dessi, Fabio Armiliato, and Ruggero Raimondi form the cast of fascinating principal characters. Director Nuria Espert has created an original environment where power, love, desire, and revenge intertwine in many ways. Dessi's Tosca is a true Diva--simultaneously flirtacious and somewhat enchanted by Scarpia. Armiliato's Cavaradossi is a sunny soul with a good heart and lots of love for the Diva. Baron Scarpia is brilliantly portrayed by Raimondi whose magnetic presence is felt in even the smallest of sounds and exchanges. His Scarpia is a powerful man, reserved and yet sensual, highly emotional and torn by contradictions.
The chemistry between the characters is palpable and present in every word and gesture, which makes this ""Tosca"" one of the most exciting and beautiful experiences you can have.",1203638400,8,870,5.311594202898551
2075894,4,B0002CH8C4,"The main selling point of this production of Puccini's 'Tosca' is the luxurious staging at the Arena di Verona, an outdoor theater built into the ruins of a public building dating from 30 AD. The stage is huge and the scenery needs to be huge as well for it to work effectively. And in this production it certainly does that. The stage is dominated by enormous broken statues of a noble Roman head and of its arm holding a sword and a crucifix. This is somehow transformed into the interior of the church in Act I, Scarpia's headquarters in Act II and the scene in which Cavaradossi is killed and Tosca leaps to her death in Act III. Act I features an enormous painting on which the painter Cavaradossi is working; it stands at least twenty feet high. And, without giving the coup de th&eacute;tre away, it figures in Scarpia's dramatic entrance late in that act. The costumes, too, are rich, colorful and appropriate to the era circa 1800 in which the opera is set. Tosca's and Scarpia's costumes must have cost a fortune. The stage direction is fluid and telling without interfering with the action. Both the intimate moments and the crowd scenes are packed with interesting details. Someone entirely unfamiliar with the opera's plot would have no difficulty following the stage action. There are no liberties in which some European opera directors have indulged themselves except for one small, not bothersome solecism: the shepherd boy at the beginning of Act III is, instead, a little boy with a fishing pole sitting on the bank of, presumably, the Tiber into which Tosca latter jumps.

Musically there is more to argue with. There are many DVD Toscas available, and this one is a notch below the best of them. I am particularly fond of the two that feature Pl&aacute;cido Domingo:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puccini-Tosca-Kabaivanska-Domingo-Milnes-Luccardi-Mariotti-Bartoletti/dp/B0007P0LOI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puccini - Tosca / Kabaivanska, Domingo, Milnes, Luccardi, Mariotti, Bartoletti</a>&nbsp;with Raina Kabaivanska and Sherrill Milnes, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puccini-Tosca-remastered/dp/B000FTJEBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puccini - Tosca (remastered)</a>&nbsp;with Hildegard Behrens and Cornell MacNeil. In the present performance Fiorenza Cedolins is not in her best voice and although she portrays the drama effectively, there is a rough edge to the voice that is bothersome. Marcelo &Aacute;lvarez as Cavaradossi is in better voice but his acting is rather routine, I fear. Ruggero Raimondi has always been a very good Scarpia, but in this 2006 performance he is sixty-five years old and the voice is worn. Dramatically his Scarpia is malevolence personified, although I prefer MacNeil's dramatic portrayal. A find, for me, was Marco Spotti as Angelotti. He's a tall, good-looking man, a good actor with a baritone that rings with metal and fire.

Musical direction by Daniel Oren and both the orchestra and chorus are good. They are given excellent recorded sound. Stage lighting, difficult in an open arena like Verona, is creative and effective. Videography is expert and unobtrusive.

2075895,4,B0002CH8C4,This is a very good Tosca. Dessi is a little shrill but otherwise good and a good actor. Her real life husband Armiliato is very good. Where has this man been hiding? Good actor as well. But the show belongs to Raimondi who exudes evil and menace as Scarpia. Benini gives us a fairly slow performance which allows us to luxuriate in Puccini's melodies. The ochestral sound is quite thrilling in DTS. The production is on the lame side. They have made Scarpia a church figure although what kind is hard to say. Certainly a cardinal or bishop would not wear pants but a surplice. The settings are quite dark. You never do get a good glimpse of Scarpia's palace. But at least nothing interferes with this wonderful performance. Probably that best Tosca one could hope for today.,1098057600,16,775,4.6231884057971016

2075899,5,B0002CH8C4,"Beautiful production. Loved the outdoor amphitheater. English subtitles are included, which had been a concern of mine. The performers were good but not incredible. Lot of optional previews of this publisher's blu-ray catalog on the disc, which are nice even if many of those productions didn't seem particularly enticing to me.",1432339200,,328,5.450980392156863
2075900,5,B0002CH8C4,The audio was excellent.  I have seen this in a theatre in the 50s.,1417824000,,67,3.7857142857142856
2075901,3,B0002CH8C4,"This production was ok, I enjoyed the amount of space and certain aspects of the set. However it gets old in the 2nd act, where they kept the same stage but only added Scarpia's desk and a few other minute things. The set for act 3 remains the same but feels even emptier.

Now that the sets are out of the way, the singing is pretty good. Cedolins is a bit mid-cast, her singing is good but just not a Tosca I could endear, she shines in Vissi d'arte and at several points in this production but she left me feeling unsatisfied, it feels like she hasn't completed Tosca for me. Marcelo Alvarez is a good Mario, but like Cedolins, he leaves me wanting more than what he delivers, E Lucevan le Stelle was one of his shining moments. Ruggero Raimondi is a very good Scarpia, despite his age, I've seen him in the 2002 film along with Angela Gheorghiu. Scarpia seems to be the highlight in this Tosca.

(SPOILER AHEAD: I apologize in advance for the details in this next part, but it bugged me so I just had to include it.)

One of the biggest let downs for me in this production was the finale, it was fine all the way up until Tosca discovers Mario is dead and after that, the finale faltered. It carried no ""oomph"" or power, it was very flat. When Tosca is supposed to escape the soldiers clutches, the soldiers don't enter to find her, and Cedolins (instead of running) walks nonchalantly up the steps of the huge statue. After the brief dialogue between them, she, during the dramatic final movement, makes her way slowly to the top of the statue and opens her arms wide, holding a crucifix and the lights go out.

Maybe in person this production was a bit better, but now it just feels empty. It's not completely bad, there are some good moments and some not so good moments but I would not consider it a must-see. In my opinion, you should avoid this Tosca unless you are hell bent on seeing it and go for a better production.",1413849600,,1930,4.337950138504155

2075909,1,B0002CH8C4,"I highly anticipated this version of Tosca.  I am a Callas aficionado and put aside any expectation of seeing a performance like her's on this blu-ray.  I had to settle for Callas' recordings and a poor quality Covet Garden 2nd Act on DVD.  Which I would pay five times the cost of that poor quality in comparison to this train wreck.  This tenor of little note only makes his acting and vocal choices even more ridiculous than any on film.  Raimondi-I expected 100%! More than you even put into your vocal and acting choices
ad more expectations of himself.  HE SOLD HIMSELF TO THE DEVIL JUST TO GET A PAYCHECK.  In reviewing this by just listening we have so many questionable tempo and embellishments than Maestro Puccini wrote - yes this is why Callas relearned the role when performing it new.  The soprano was a audio and even worse of a train wreck visually. Her performance had none of Tosca's subtle interactions with her Cavaradossi and with Scarpia it was a train wreck in action from the minute she came into the church.  By now you know I hold this blu-ray as a sham.  AMAZON RETURN MY MONEY!

I come from a position of knowledge in this having been a trained musician and conductor,finally Artistic Director.  Now opera afficianodos must judge this on their own, but listen to me, watch a Zefferelli production filmed on location and so much more intelligent acting and vocals are self evident.  Zubin Mehta only know fffortisimo as a volume.  He brings poor choices to the podium and overall interprets Puccini through clouded eyes (and ears).  This was not a film made in India but certainly seemed to adapt the overproduced products that we see.  Look at the sopranos cringed face throughout and that says everything.  That  is why we Italians threw our lunches at performers.

2075911,1,B0002CH8C4,I was very surprised that Dessi was cast as Tosca - she is unsuitable for this role both vocally and dramatically. Her Vissi d'arte does not move one emotionally! And it's Vissi d'arte!!! It is a sad sign of the sorry state of the operatic world that we are being served shoddy work such as this performance. For a good Tosca I would recommend either Tebaldi or Gheorghiu.,1366761600,,372,4.485294117647059
2075912,1,B0002CH8C4,"There are two reasons why you shouldn't waste your money on this dvd: first, the sound is not nearly as good as that of indoor productions; second, Cedolins portrayal of Tosca is mediocre both vocally and dramatically. There are so many good recordings of Tosca around. In my opinion, the best vocal and dramatic characterisation of Floria Tosca is to be found in the 2012 Covent Garden production with Terfel, Kaufmann, and the insuperable Angela Gheorghiu (available as blu-ray).",1366416000,2,481,5.10126582278481

Despite that, after watching this recording, I felt that something was not right. I then bought the DVD with Pavarotti and Verret. And my God, it all made sense! The image quality of Pavarotti's recording is, of course, not thrilling. But the singing and music are so much better that I could never play this Blu-ray again.

The production is passionate and beautiful with fabulous sound.  It is set in the Arena di Verona outdoors with an interesting set.
Ruggero Raimondi is the GREATEST Scarpia.  Marcelo Alvarez is GREAT as Mario.  Fiorenza Cedolins is GREAT as Tosca.

2075919,5,B0002CH8C4,"Ruggero Raimondi in this bluray is the best Scarpia I have ever heard. Even Gobbi in the mythical Callas/De Sabata recording can not match Raimondi perfidy: he is scary, smart, lecherous, and in remarkable vocal form. When he is on scene he completely steals the show. And what a show! The production of this Tosca is a great combination of tradition and innovation, big and bold. The Te Deum scene is breathtaking, and both singers and orchestra seem to be as emotionally taken by it as I was.

What about Tosca? Fiorenza Cedolins looks stunning, she is passionate in her acting. She is no Callas though, her voice feels closed up top and lacks agility. At the end of Vissi d'arte (her big aria) she sounded strained but also fearless and generous. Similar remarks could be made about Marcelo Alvarez as Cavaradossi. At times is he is really good (O dolci baci) and at times he sounds like he is singing Trovatore rather than Puccini (the opening aria, Recondita Armonia was particularly bad).

I also bought it before the price was reduced to the current bargain range (depending on the Arthaus version advertised) so it seems to me to offer terrific value.

The venue at Verona is spectacular with everything being presented on a large scale. This produces a situation of swings and roundabouts. The voices can get somewhat submerged, but not inaudible, at the big moments - and there are many. However, with the aid of the subtitles, it is easy enough to precisely follow the words being sung without any guesswork.

At the same time there is also conveyed a degree of required effort which I personally find appropriate to the scale of the drama being portrayed. The crucial death of Scarpia must equally be conveyed with an overwhelming passion and hatred and in this respect we are fully catered for. Several otherwise fine performances fall at this hurdle. The singers here are all up to the task vocally and as actors. The orchestra are well recorded especially when considering the demands of the venue.

Better than most from the same venue.

Not the greatest singing, but very good and an enjoyable production...

Well worth the price asked. You can't go wrong with this one....You could pay a lot more and get a lot less.",1329696000,4,453,4.5

I took advance of the good price to buy this DVD with a great cast.
The production at the Verona Arena was great, the scenery in the vast stage was very successful as well as the costumes and lights .All these elements were very effective in maintain the dramatism of this opera .The end of the first act when Scarpia and a chorus sang ""The Sbirri ,una carrosa""(Te Deum) and people arriving at the church at the same time of a procession began, the combination with very good music, scenery and lights were very effective.
The main characters: Tosca, Cavaradossi and Scarpia played by Fiorenza Ceddolins, Marcelo Alvarez and Ruggerio Raimondi were very good in their roles showing the complexity of there personality's .Scarpia has his intend on getting Tosca as his lover using the power of his position to create doubts about Cavaradossi's love for her, on the other hand Tosca goes from love to jealousy and at the same time tries convince Scarpia to pardon Cavaradossi, and in exchange she will accept him although she will kill him before this. At the same time Cavaradossi prefers to die before renouncing to his ideas.
This is a very dramatic opera and it is very well reflected in this production.",1329436800,4,1350,5.283720930232558
2075931,3,B0002CH8C4,"I'd never seen Tosca before, and was expecting it to be as good as the hype. But it was not -- it was just barely okay. There's nothing I could recommend on this disk besides its Blu-ray video quality. However, I just watched Tosca with Placido Domingo and Raina Kabaivanska, and that version of Tosca was great! Those two singers were amazing! And the music was beautiful. And the setting and acting were just right. Tosca is as good as its hype on the right DVD...",1329436800,,466,4.430232558139535
2075932,5,B0002CH8C4,"This is an impressive and entertaining performance of this beloved Puccini opera and I'm very happy to have it added to my collection and in addition the quality of this HD recording is excellent.

It is evident as one watches that this was performed on a very warm summer evening in Verona; if one checks one discovers it was recorded on July 15, 2006. I am always impressed by the dedication exhibited by opera singers as they valiantly perform under what is on occasion rather difficult circumstances. Wearing those heavy costumes under lights on a warm summer evening at the Arena di Verona certainly qualifies as one of those occasions. In spite of these obstacles the entire cast turned in powerful performances that on occasion brought tears to my eyes.

A major contributor to the success of this recording is the camera work and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. The camera shoots much of the opera close up so as to make it difficult to remember it's being performed in an open air arena that seats 15,000. There are occasional shots of the Arena Di Verona that shows the size of the venue and the audience; I think it's a charming touch that the members of the audience are given candles to light.

During the performance the camera work focuses on the stage and the singers enabling the viewer to forget the size of the place and even imagine a theater setting; I found myself able to do that on several occasions.

The major feature of any opera for me is the music; I have delighted myself with beautifully sung opera on CD's and LP recordings for many years. One of the major advantages of surround sound is the immersion effect; one feels as if the music or action is happening all around the hearer. This DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 does an outstanding job of placing the listener on the stage in the middle of the action which I find rather appealing; if one has the volume loud enough, the first cannon shot could make one jump it seems so close by.

The audio is available in PCM stereo and DTS-HD Master Audio; the default seems to be the PCM stereo and one must manually select the DTS-HD option to get the surround sound. I tried both options and the surround version is clearly superior if you have the system required for playback.

The overall effect is of a grand evening at the grand opera hearing beautiful music effectively performed and at a price that is irresistible. I'm delighted with this addition to my opera library.

There are also a number of selections from several other Blu-ray recordings identified as ""Trailers"" on the main menu; these include a wide range of performances and styles from the Vienna Boys' Choir to Daniel Barenboim performing Chopin piano concertos via many opera and some ballet segments. All told there are 47 segments lasting over 140 minutes. The audio and video quality on those I've watched to date is very good although I'm still not a fan of Wagnerian opera in a contemporary setting.",1328572800,7,2945,4.651923076923077
2075933,4,B0002CH8C4,"For an open air production of Tosca, you cant get better than this. I am impressed with the way that the producers and audio recording personnel have gone about their job.

I have always had a thing against open air productions, and there are some very lousy recordings from the same venue that I have trashed just because the audio as well as much of the video was not up to the mark. But they seem to have redeemed themselves beautifully, given the limitations of the venue.

I would always enjoy a Tosca recorded from an enclosed theater. Yes, most of the other Toscas I have are better sounding than this one, but I have to admit that Alvarez and Cedolins do a great job. I could not have expected more from Raimondi in that role. His voice is not really up to the role, is what I feel about this wonderful singer. Comparing his Scarpia to the likes of Tito Gobi or even the recent Brynn Terfel I think would be unfair. Maybe 20 years ago, Raimondi may have pulled it off beautifully in an auditorium, but the open air venue seems to have got the better of him, in spite of the electronic help. Cedolins pulls off a rather 'un-fiery' Tosca in this - a totally new approach. The murder of Scarpia is not very well done, just OK. She is no match for some of the other Toscas, of which there are plenty, but still, comes through quite competently voice-vice. Cedolins seems to be better suited for La Rondine, a part she has pulled off superbly, and of course in the Donizetti opera, Maria Stuarda, where I actually noticed her first.

This is the best of Alvarez I have seen. He towers above the rest of the cast and really pulls it off fabulously.

The sets, being where they are situated are not really adequate (or convincing) for the Puccini Opera. I wish they could have done a bit better. The staging however, is quite good.
The Video is superb, and I must take my hat off to that crew

All in all, really worth owning. There are really lovely moments in this production, especially for Cedolins that are worth watching over and over again...

BUT WAIT...

There is a huge huge bonus of clips from other operas and a smattering of ballets, which is really worth flipping through and can fill an evening of varied works of different moods, that makes this blu ray doubly worth buying. In fact, if they had sold this without the main opera, it would still be worth keeping as a potpourri of attractive pieces..",1325376000,18,2416,4.427927927927928
2075934,4,B0002CH8C4,"This is a recording from a live performance in ""Arena di Verona"", in Verona (where else) Italy.  It is an excellent performance all around.

First of all the music: All three leading stars were very good.  Ironically, Scarpia (sung by Ruggero Raimondi) was the best despite the fact that he is the clear number-3 singer in Tosca.  All three sung nearly flawlessly, but the singing was somewhat emotionless by Tosca (sung by Fiorenza Cedolins).  The orchestra was listless at times, but maybe that was a reflection of the fact that this was an outdoor performance.  OK, for singing, this performance is probably not in the same class as the very best I have heard in the past (sung by Domingo, Freni, and Ramey), but it is darn good. I was delighted the whole time I was watching it.

Next the peripherals: the acting, the set design, the costumes, all that stuff that is secondary to the music (for me), but still makes the experience so much richer, if well done.  In that sense, this was one of the best Tosca performance I have ever seen.  The set design was a cross between ancient Roman and ultramodern.  It worked surprisingly well.  The costumes were beautiful (more on that later.)  Acting was pretty good, but don't expect ""Masterpiece Theatre"" performances from Opera singers. For an opera, this was much better than average acting.

Next the Blu-Ray: it was fantastic. The cinematography was nothing short of exceptional. When you get a close shot of the singers with their ornamental clothing, you can see every minute detail on the screen (on a 48"" HDTV on 1080p).  This stuff is typically so small and intricate, that it gets blurred when played from a DVD.  (On the negative side, you can also see the tiny specks of perspiration on the singers' faces as well.  You cannot hide anything in a well made Blu-Ray.)  Subtitles were very good and their timing were perfectly synchronized with the music.  Time to retire my DVD collection.  From now on, I am buying Operas only on Blue Ray.

Finally the price: it is a steal!!!  You can't buy many excellent Opera performances on Blu-Ray for less than $10. Grab this one, and you won't regret it.",1324944000,4,2155,4.693333333333333
2075935,4,B0002CH8C4,"I have seen this opera several times, and own over 15 different dvd's of this as well.  So, in this one, what particularly moved me?  Taking in mind the huge setting in the Verona arena, I was surprised at how well this rather small scale opera worked in this vast space.

The arena sits 15,000 people, so VERY large productions like Aida, Nabucco, etc, work especially well.  Here, the ending of Act 1 (with the full church service) was spectacular, and looked even better on the Blu-Ray disc.  THIS is really what the Verona arena is for.  But the more intimate scenes of Act 2 still worked well for me, even with the large scale.

Marcello Alavarez was terrific as Carravadosi, and all three major roles were well sung and acted.

Finally, the video  was excellent, I thought the sound was terrific as well.

This opera is always a fun watch as it is so deliciously melodramatic.",1320624000,53,882,4.560509554140127

I had never seen Tosca before, and frankly I liked the fact that it was live stage performance and not just a movie version. That would have been a disappointment. There is nothing here to put off a newcomer unless you're just not going to like opera no matter what--that's what you're getting here--opera. No cars blowing up, graphic sex and violence, or elves...and only bits of fake blood.

My only gripe with the packaging is that the ""bonus features"" are trailers for other disks--not my idea of a ""bonus feature,"" which usually includes behind the scenes, biographical and other material (although a blooper reel would probably be asking too much here.)
