7913500,5,B00000JS6A,"Every Canadian should own this documentary, which was produced by the CBC in the 60's.  It takes the viewer on a trip into Cohen's brilliant poetic mind and the city of Montreal at the same time.  He has so many amazing insights into poetry and life during the course of this film, and to be honest, this film has helped me to be more honest about my own life and work, and to realize that, like Cohen says, ""There is nothing at stake,"" which should free you up to experiment with your writing and your consciousness.",1445817600,,517,4.375
7913501,5,B00000JS6A,"For all you people who got to know Leonard Cohen after his 1988 album ""I'm your man"" this should be  a must see video. You will find out that this living legend received a very classical training and was  groomed for a high position in the Canadian world of poetry. Instead of  course he threw it all away for ""an education in the world"" and  became a pop singer. This is an important video that almost didn't happen.  The documentary was supposed to be made about five poets but Cohen was the  youngest and least stuffy of them all and the director wisely focused on  Cohen and saw the genius in the bard of Montreal. All of this is news to  the new fans of Cohen but for the old timers like me this is ancient but  never the less pleasant history. Anything by Leonard Cohen is welcome. Yes,  he is that good.",949363200,37,810,4.235294117647059
