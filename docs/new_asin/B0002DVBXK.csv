8026992,5,B0002DVBXK,"I you like movie like the KRANES ARE FLYING, this movie is for you.

It is not unlike the classic, however modern russia has put it's

touch on it. Do not expect a light and uplifting romantic story, it is not.

It rather tells a story of the cruelty of war, and the heartship.

Nevertheless you feel with thw young women, to go on with life and the pursuit of happiness. My russian is rather poor, I watched this movie without english subtitles, but I wish to purchase a copy with english or german subtitles, and watch it again with my girlfriend.

The movie claims to have English subtitles, but they aren't there, so unless one understands Russian, it is impossible to watch the movie.",1128124800,5,246,4.590909090909091
