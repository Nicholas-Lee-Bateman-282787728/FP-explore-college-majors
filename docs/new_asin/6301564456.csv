335086,4,6301564456,"The Official Story has it that Orson Welles saw, in Tarkington's novel, his own story. The 'completed' film, such as it was, and the mess that led up to it, really IS Welles' own story - though not in any way he could've foreseen, or relished the irony of afterwards. The simplified version of events has philistine Hollywood & RKO cutting the genius Welles' legs out from under him on the AMBERSONS film, while he was off in Brazil shooting IT'S ALL TRUE. The actual chain of events is a lot more complicated than that, and has as much to do with the star-crossed history of RKO as with the movie colony's dislike of Orson Welles, enfant terrible. Put bluntly, the saga of Welles-in-Hollywood could not have ended any other way, given that his deal was with RKO - the most ineptly run studio in Hollywood, beset with warring factions and Borgia-like intrigues among its braintrust. For Pete's sake, at one point the head of production was JOE BREEN! The miracle is that Orson Welles managed to finish one picture on his own terms, and parts of two others. All that said, I hope anyone who hasn't yet seen AMBERSONS will make plans to do so. The first 70 minutes or so IS Welles' picture, and as beautifully thought-out and detailed a film as he ever made. There's a burnished glow to the production that heightens the viewer's emotional connection to the events onscreen - the script, performances, photography and art direction are flawless. Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead and Tim Holt were never better than they are here. Those last 20 minutes, unfortunately, are hackwork - a porridge of flat and flavorless new scenes spliced into mutilated existing Welles-shot footage, julienne-sliced at the studio's behest by then-film editor Robert Wise (who remained on Welles' s**t-list for the rest of his life because of it). Enough greatness remains - even in this compromised botch - to captivate and carry an audience back to turn-of-the-century Indianapolis. But you should feel a slight sting at every mention in the narration of George Minafer's long-awaited 'comeuppance', since it was Welles himself who took the full brunt of that comeuppance.",998697600,8,2150,4.8931506849315065
335087,5,6301564456,"Really.  That's how good this film is.  It could make an inept loser like George Lucas into a good person.
History:
On ""...Kane"" Welles got everything he wanted. On Ambersons they took it all away.  In a way it's a shame this situation wasn't reversed.
For me Kane has always been pyrotechnics -- Welles parades his ideas like a drunk ... in a whore house.  Ambersons is darker, more introspective, and more interesting territory -- what Ovid might have thought about in his last years alone.  Of course this is like comparing a Who concert to a Shostokovich symphony (4 or 6).
Anyway:
In Ambersons Welles began his love afair with the long take and mise-en-scene.  The lighting from journey-man DOP Stanley Cortez is magnificent -- certainly equalling that of Toland's in Kane.  And there are shots, blockings, and compositions that are simply astounding, even today.  There are scenes and moments, so completely unlike Hollywood, that they stay with you forever:  Cotton's speech at the dinner-table, the Major waking at the moment of his daughters death; Agnes Moorehead leaning against the cold boiler; Anne Baxter fainting in the drug-store; the Amberson's ball; that newfangled auto-mobile in the snow...
And then there's the gliding camera, the astounding compositions, and the simultaneous dialog...
I think Kane was Welles' step up to ""...Ambersons"", because, while I remember the ideas of ""...Kane"" (and what astounding ideas they are), I remember *The Ambersons* of ""...Ambersons"".
Of course how good it was will probably never be known.  Reports of how badly mangled the final product are contract each other.  Time makes them even less reliable.
Hence the title of this review:
When I look at what's going to be out this year, and next year (like Star Wars II and III), it seems ironic that a guy like George Lucas, with money to burn, can re-cut a piece of nonsense like Star Wars, and the world can't find the time or money to restore ""...Ambersons"" before it's too late.  James Cameron is trying to go into space (best place for him), you think he'd give up a few bucks?  And what's Speilberg done for us lately?
Robert Wise directed some of the ""studio's suggestions"" (including the last shot), and edited the film.  If anyone could solve/save this masterpiece it's him.  And I belive he's still alive?  Gee, if RKO's vaults are still around, if the footage is still there...
Because until this film is restored, it'll be just Orson Welles greatest *mangled* masterpiece.  And it would be a tradgedy, knowing what we know about the man and his work, to miss out on the real thing.",998438400,6,2597,4.865909090909091
335088,5,6301564456,"Orson Welles's adaptation of Booth Tarkington's award-willing novel and follow-up to Citizen Kane is a true screen classic.  As with Kane, this film contains many wonderful performances by all the leads including Joseph Cotton, Agnes Moorehead, Dolores Costello, and Tim Holt as George Amberson Minafer.  Welles continued his experimentation with film technique and you will notice similar camera angles and lighting,  to those in Kane.  The lighting is something exploited to good affect here, especially in the scenes inside the Amberson mansion.  The story is a simple one:  Eugene Morgan (Cotton) and Isabel Amberson (Costello) young lovers, who through a somewhat frivolous circumstance end up marrying other people.  After they've both raised children, they again find themselves free to begin where they left off in their youth.  But Isabel's son (Holt) does not approve of their relationship, in spite of the fact that he is in love with Morgan's daughter, Lucy (Anne Baxter).  Set at the turn of the 20th century, the movie has a wonderful feel and texture, which effectively evokes the period.  An interesting backdrop is the development of the automobile, with Cotton an early proponent and tycoon, and its effects on not only the American economy, but on the changes it brings to society as well.  Morgan, once spurned as a little too common for Isabel returns again to his hometown a successful industrialist.  As his fortunes climb, those of the Ambersons fall.  As already mentioned, the film is packed with wonderful performances.  Agnes Moorehead was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and won the Best Actress award from the New York Film Critics Circle.  As the lonely, sorrowful Aunt Fanny, hers is a delicately crafted characterization.  Cotton as the auto tycoon Morgan, gives another understated and subtle performance; a young Anne Baxter is lovely as Cotton's daughter Lucy; and Tim Holt, a name all but forgotten today, is magnificent in the pivotal role of George Amberson Minafer.  One of the most interesting scenes in the film is the ball at the Amberson mansion.  The camera seems to float along with the players seemingly without a break, putting the viewer right in the midst of the cast.  A great film, worthy of multiple viewings, The Magnificent Ambersons has earned its place among Hollywood's greatest films.",982022400,66,2349,5.183023872679045
335089,5,6301564456,"We all can think back at what has come before in our lives with all types of emotion and ""what ifs"" It is apparent that many filmgoers feel the same ..after the fact.
After Welles profound artistry in "" Citizen Kane"" he was practically doomed in hollywood. "" Ambersons, merely put the final exclamation point on the final sentence. "" Surely, "" The Magnificent Ambersons"" is much more emtional to view and to revel in. This is because Tarkington,s work is really meloncholy and probing. Instead of a tyrant ( Kane) we can swim in the pools of the characters in "" Ambersons"" with much more attachment.
We can also suppose that Welles, was rather naive in thinking RKO would allow him to edit "" Ambersons"" while in South America shooting that "" disaster"" All the history is more or less in place...for sure..certain lines spoken by Joseph Cotten are more relevant today than ever. one item always seems to come up....when you consider all that happened with ""Kane"" ..why would Welles assume anything with regards to the studios intent.
When the Ambersons are stunned by the reality of their financial ruin..we must feel for them because some know of that same path in life.",973987200,,1170,4.712195121951219
335090,5,6301564456,"While it's impossible to think about the cutting of ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" without regret, it's also pretty easy to forget about it while watching the finished work, which is difficult for me to think of as anything less than perfect (save in theoretical comparison to the lost version).  Since I'm unencumbered by expertise, I have no technical grounds on which to argue that ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" is a better movie than ""Citizen Kane, "" all I know is that it's a much more important movie for me emotionally.  And I can't help wondering if Welles felt the same way about it to some extent.  Certainly, Welles' biographers suggest an overwhelming emotional involvement with the story-not least because of his claim that Tarkington had Welles' father in mind when he created the character of Eugene-and that this was the source both of the movie's power and its sad fate.
Although I dislike kneejerk psychoanalysis of artists, it does seem clear that Welles' colluded to some extent in the destruction of his film.  He refused to take the role of George, with which he'd had so much success in the radio version; I don't mind Tim Holt's performance, but he was very poorly received at the time.
More seriously, Welles insisted on a drastic cut of all the footage between Isabel receiving Eugene's letter, and the gathering of her family in the hallway outside her sickroom. He replaced the cut footage with a single, ludicrous scene of Isabel getting the letter, reading it, and dropping dead. This version is the one that was shown at the disastrous premiere in Pomona. The second screening, for which the excised footage was restored by Robert Wise, received a reasonably warm reception from the good people of Pasadena.  And it's telling that even though Welles had signed away his right to a final cut at the commencement of shooting, the  studio refrained from making the daft substitution I've just described.
The ins and outs of the editing process are described exhaustively in Richard Carringer's ""The Magnificent Ambersons-A Reconstruction,"" which contains the full shooting script of the lost version--as well as storyboards and stills of missing footage--and is an indispensible aid to understanding both the released and the lost version.  It also presents copious evidence of Welles' conflicted emotions about the project.
To me, that Welles' was emotionally driven to sabotage his greatest film--or was too involved in it to use proper judgment--is far more interesting than the hackneyed, almost impersonal myth of the genius whose work is destroyed by greedy and uncomprehending philistines; the myth is attractive, and lets us take a vicarious stand against the bad guys, but things are seldom that simple in real life.  No doubt ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" could've been better, but to this ignoramus, one minute of it is worth five of ""Citizen Kane,"" or the entirety of the vastly overrated ""Touch of Evil.""",971654400,8,2938,5.068322981366459
335091,5,6301564456,"The story of the original preview of Welles's film is illuminating.  As was then the custom, audience comments were recorded on response cards after screenings.  Studio executives for some reason decided to preview the  film on a double-bill with ""The Fleet's In,"" a light-hearted  musical starring Dorothy Lamour, before an audience of teenagers.  Remember  that this was March of 1942, when the outcome of the Second World War was  in question.  Welle's serious and innovative picture met with mostly  negative comments from the kids.  And although the movie was later  previewed to an older, more thoughtful audience, the damage had been done.",958953600,2,646,5.235294117647059
335092,5,6301564456,"While my personal favorite Welles film is ""Touch of Evil"" (when do we get the new version on DVD?) I can definitely say that ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" had the potential to be his greatest work.  Even after being trimmed by a third of its running time, however, it  remains a marvelous spectacle, even if it is the worst example of studio  interference.  While Welles must be held somewhat accountable (for thinking  his film would be safe after the fight over ""Citizen Kane""), the  actions taken by RKO Studios regarding ""Ambersons"" must be  considered the most atrocious in film history.  The missing footage is  almost certainly gone forever (an unearthed print of said footage would be  the holy grail of lost film), but there are numerous books mentioned by  previous reviewers available for study, and hopefully one day Criterion  will update their laserdisc edition to DVD.  It includes the film's  complete shooting script and storyboards, a film historian commentary, and  Welles' Mercury Theater radio production of ""Ambersons"". This  edition is probably the closest we'll ever get to seeing what ""The  Magnificent Ambersons"" might have been.",958780800,9,1153,5.179347826086956
335093,5,6301564456,"For those truly interested in what Welles' original version of ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" would have been like, I strongly recommend Robert Carringer's ""The Magnificent Ambersons: A Reconstruction""  and Peter Bogdanovich's ""This Is Orson Welles"". Both books  provide considerable detail regarding the significant re-editing and  re-shooting which took place on this film. What remains in the released  version of Welles' second film is astonishing, but much of the story's  logic was lost in the re-cutting, as was important character motivation.  Exactly why did the Ambersons lose their fortune? What propelled George to  rebuff Eugene? Welles' original version answered these questions and  presented an incredible vision of a world overrun by industry. The  destruction of this original version of the movie is simply the greatest  injustice done to American cinema. Alas, we can still marvel at the film's  beautiful performances, the gorgeous ""snow ride"" scene, the  astonishingly realistic ""kitchen"" scenes and Welles' incredible  narration. By all means, watch this movie, but do some reading about what  it was meant to be and then use your imagination to see the greatest  American movie ever made.",948844800,93,1209,5.565934065934066
335094,5,6301564456,"A lot of attention has been paid to how the studio butchered the film by imposing its own ending.  I hope that doesn't take away from this achievement by Welles.  The film, ending and all, is a carefully crafted  story about the fall of the Amberson family, and in particular, the  arrogant George Amberson Minafer.  The opening sequence, which sets up the  story of the family and its relationship to the community, is perfect and  sets the tone for the film.  Welles narration becomes as much a part of the  story as the characters themselves.  The cast is uniformly excellent, with  strong performances by Joseph Cotten, Tim Holt, Agnes Moorehead, and a  young and very beautiful Anne Baxter.  Moorehead, in particular, is  incredible in her role as the frustrated spinster aunt.  Her scenes toward  the end of the film are riveting.  I've watched this film several times and  I am still amazed by the simplicity of the story and the incredible detail  of the filmmaking.  It's difficult to imagine that the scenes edited out  could have improved this final product.",947894400,6,1069,4.8277777777777775

I think this is one of Wells' best works. It's not as good as Citizen Kane but it does come very, very close for me.

335245,5,6301564456,"Someone mentioned the usefulness of Prof. Robert L. Carringer's book on Ambersons. It is a great read, essential for anyone who wants to learn more about this butchered masterpiece. Prof. Carringer was my primary mentor for cinema studies when I was in grad school in the early-to-mid-80s. He had several research assistants. I was fortunate to be one of them. I was one of many who helped him with his book The Making of Citizen Kane, which is also essential for folks who want to know more about that film and about Welles. Highly recommended. In 1984 when he was finishing the Kane book, I also helped him with the early stages of his work on Ambersons. I was alone in his office one afternoon. The phone rang and I answered it. The caller had heard a rumor that Bob had found the missing footage for Ambersons, and he wanted to know more. I do not recall who that was, another film scholar, I think. I took down his name and telephone number, and I passed on the message to Bob when he returned to his office. Of course, Bob had not found the missing footage. What a glory that would have been! But he was beginning to work on the Ambersons book, and somewhere along the grapevine that information was scrozzled into the misinformation that he had found the missing footage. Would that he had. We could have restored the film to the masterpiece it should have been. As it is, Bob's Amberson's book is an attempt at a reconstruction. The film and its history are fascinating. I hope you enjoy the films, Bob's books, and discussions of all. As for Warner Brothers, I wouldn't be too hard on the decisions that corporate hacks make regarding films that they neither understand nor cherish as we do, but I would write a letter politely pointing out how they could have done a better job.

335327,5,6301564456,"The follow-up to Citizen Kane is revered both for what it is -- a broody slab of American Gothic -- and what it isn't -- 50 minutes longer.

Yes, the studio re-edited the film without the input of Welles, chopping it down to 88 minutes and filming a newer, happier ending. Legend has it that the lost footage was quickly destroyed by RKO Pictures to prevent Welles from editing it back in.

While Welles was already notorious for going over budget, the fault really lay with RKO. They knew that The Magnificent Ambersons, a Booth Tarkington novel Welles and his Mercury Theatre had previously adapted for radio, was a tragic downer when they greenlighted it with an unheard-of-for-RKO million-dollar budget. But Welles would get the blame, and never really have full control over a decently budgeted studio film again.

What's left here is a magnificent, truncated Gothic tale with more than a hint of Great Expectations about it, though it's Great Expectations as seen in a funhouse mirror. Welles' brilliant use of shadows and textures, and his uncommonly fine understanding of how to achieve depth of field with the camera technology of the early 1940's, is on display here. The movie looks great as the camera flows through the chiarascuro rooms of the Amberson mansion.

The other fascinating intertext for this film would be The Great Gatsby, again in a funhouse mirror as the pseudo-Gatsby character, played by Joseph Cotten, becomes a true (and benevolent) success while the old-money family of the woman who rejected his love in a fit of pique, played by Dolores Costello, disintegrates under the onslaught of Time and the 20th Century.

While he was away shooting another film out of the country the studio heads cut almost 50 minutes of footage from the film and burned it, making it impossible for anyone to restore the lost footage. It's a wonder though that this film, despite how much it was butchered, is still a masterpiece. Both Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums and Ingmar Bergman's Fanny and Alexander owe everything to this film, in one of its directors greatest films.

This DVD contains a great restoration of the 1942 film, with a lush picture with minimal deterioration and a great soundtrack transfer. A worthy release of one of Welles' best films!",1371772800,,795,4.719424460431655

335380,3,6301564456,"I watched this immediately after finishing Tarkington's novel. It's set in turn of the century America, where unpleasant rich kid George Amberson is just leaving college, planning to live an idle life as a gentleman. Then the Morgans arrive in town - lovely daughter Lucy, whom George is set on marrying, and her father Eugene who is developing the new-fangled 'horseless carriage.'
But Eugene was once an ardent admirer of George's mother.... And George's spinster Aunt Fanny is also setting her cap at him...
The book is quite enjoyable as indeed is the movie. Watching a 1942 film now, one is immediately struck by the costumes and hairstyles looking more 1940s than of the Victorian era. Also of a somewhat stilted tone to the acting. However Agnes Moorehead as Aunt Fanny is really brilliant.

335385,2,6301564456,"THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS is often cited as one of the best American films ever..a masterpiece by visionary director Orson Welles that was destroyed by in the cutting room by a greedy studio. I've heard the title mentioned so many times through the years and I finally had to see the film. I knew nothing of the plot so I viewed the film with a clean slate.

What I found was a slow-moving story about uninteresting and mostly unlikeable characters. The Amberson family was magnificent because of their wealth and their stately home--the largest and most modern in town. Isabel Amberson (Dolores Costello) and Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten) are in love but a drunken mishap by Morgan leads Isabel to marry another. Their paths cross again many years later when both have a adult children - a son for Isabel and a daughter for Morgan. No surprise that the second generation is attracted to each other as their parents' romance is eventually rekindled. Nothing much exciting to this story. Isabel's son George loathes Morgan for reasons never fully explained--jealousy? Everyone continues to live their miserable lives as the world changes and modernizes around them. George's spinster aunt Fanny (Agnes Moorehead)slowly slides into her psychosis and fuels George's hatred and mistrust of Morgan and the world.

THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS is a sad and dark story where love never rules the day. The film itself is mostly shot indoors and in dark lighting and in shadows (pure Welles here). The story is often confusing and motivations are unexplained. The world collapses around the Ambersons but why? Dreams are destroyed and lives are shattered but what just happened? It's hard to make sense of this scattered film.

What could it have been? will always be the question. What we now know as THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS is a fractured portion of Welles's film. RKO eventually took control of the film editing and drastically changed the film by removing scenes and refilming sections. Welles's orginal ending was changed to something happier, though the ending doesn't seem all that happy or enlightening. The story is the portions removed from Welles's original cut of the film were destroyed and no copies of the original exist. Could Welles's have saved the film?
Yet, despite the destruction of the original film, THE MAGNIFICENT AMERBSONS was nominated for an Academy Award as best picture. Critics seem to have loved the film though it was not a box-office hit. I think it is important to know the backstory to the film to better appreciate what it eventually became.

The magnificence of the production and photography  alone would be reason enough, but the acting (Cotten's in particular, but Judith Anderson's also, of course) and the tension of many scenes (what is left of the Ball Scene at the Ambersons'mansion, for instance)make the film unforgettable even after years and weeks, I cannot forget many of the shots and scenes ( my fist experience was in Paris in the sixties ( 1960""s that is). I recently saw it again on digitally remastered dvd and I found all my original admiration came back at the richness of this real American epic, maybe not quite the equal of Citizen Kane, but certainly superior to later ones, such as the overrated Giant. The melodrama of the Booth Tarkington novel is unavoidable, but so magnified and Tranformed by the master director that it becomes comparable to a Greek tragedy. And what a lesson it is to our times, devoured by greed and the pollution created by industry and the frenzy and congestion of city traffic! What a striking prophecy is held in the scene between Cotten's character, a motor car enthusiast and industrialist, and young Amberson who has just insulted him. What a lesson in civility, masterfully carried off by that inimitable actor and what a lesson for our politicians to day!
Unforgettable, inimitable, I said and I will repeat: do not deprive yourself of this great film because it was trunkated by stupid money-grabbing distributors.

335518,5,6301564456,"I almost didn't buy this DVD because of the negative reviews. Let's set some stuff straight:

1) The cutting and restructuring of this film, as well as the unbelievably inane happy ending, were all done by RKO in 1942 while Orson Welles was off blowing the studio's money in South America. Amazon and the current rights holders (Warner Bros) had nothing to do with this. This is the way the movie has existed since its release in 1942.

2) The cast list on Amazon's description that starts with Georgia Backus is just a fluke on Amazon's part. The packaging actually lists the major players. No reason to give it a one-star review because of this error.

3) The DVD, as of this point in time (July 2012), has about 10 chapter markers. Someone earlier complained that there were none. If that was so, it's no longer true.

4) The print is beautiful. There are no extras. Oh well.

If you're interested in Welles, film history, RKO, or life in the 1900s, you want this DVD. And even if none of these things appeal to you, this is still a great movie - beautiful cinematography and a compelling story. True, the original Welles cut may have been better, but we will probably never see that cut - no one else except for a few RKO employees in the forties has ever seen it. In the meantime, this DVD is great.

335520,4,6301564456,"The recently released DVD of ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" Orson Welles' second and final film for RKO, is welcome indeed.  Warner Bros. has provided us with a bare-bones DVD without commentary, special features of any kind or even a chapter menu.  The quality of the DVD, both in picture and sound, however, is very good.  It is of a cleaned up and restored print with excellent clarity, steadiness and contrast for a film of this time and the audio is of good quality for a film of 1942.  I would judge the overall quality to be nearly but not quite as fine as the  2001 Warner DVD release of ""Citizen Kane.""

As is common knowledge, the film was taken out of Welles"" control and heavily edited with the ending reworked to provide a more ""upbeat"" conclusion.  At the previews of the rough cut of the  film audiences laughed at some of the scenes intended to be dramatic.  Several portions of the film, not just the ending, were cut by a total of 40 minutes.  Robert Wise, editor of this film and ""Citizen Kane"" felt that the revised ending was an improvement to which Welles vehemently disagreed.

The excised footage was ultimately destroyed purportedly to ""make room in the vaults"" and a copy of the rough cut, supposedly sent to Welles while he was working in Brazil on another RKO project, is believed to have been lost.

There are no printed credits at the end of the film but they are instead recited by Welles.  I noticed immediately that there was no credit for music score -- obviously the work of Bernard Herrmann -- and discovered that, because of the cuts that were made, he insisted on his name being deleted from the credits.

335523,5,6301564456,"This is one of those films that do not get dated despite released in 1942. I guess we should in part credit the maestro Orson Welles for this achievement. I really recommend this film to all those who feel nostalgia for the past and have the feeling that many aspects of present day life changed for the worst. The movie is immersed in times where automobile industry was emerging as a sign of the new era that was to come. On top of that, characters depict an old traditional family whose wealth, name and pride were fading away. Family proud, son-mother jealousy, and never corresponded woman love are the negative forces that prevent an old love to flourish. Tim Holt as George Amberson and the great Joseph Cotten as Eugene Morgan play great characters and give excellent performances. As a note, you don't have Orson Welles on the screen this time, but he recites all of the credits at the end of the film.

Technically, this Universal PAL, zone 2 release comes in full frame, something expected for movies at this time. The transfer is a good one, with no scratches, but could have been better in terms of definition. The movie runs for 88 minutes, which is sad as the original version was supposed to last for about 148 minutes. RKO people at that time seem responsible for this ""sin"". The audio is in English, and English subtitles are provided.",1331424000,,1353,4.614107883817427
335524,3,6301564456,"The release of this film on DVD has been held up for years by lawsuits. And unfortunately now it has been released as a sort of meaningless afterthought. No extras. No special edition. No Blu Ray. I guess having a release of some sort is better than having no release at all.

Its a film with unending problems. The characters are generally unlikable. The theme of the rise of the automobile being a bad thing is completely undone by the fact that George is a person without qualities. The film makes solid attempts at the beginning and end to appeal to nostalgia, but its difficult to raise much sympathy for someone like George. And those who have read the book know how goofy parts of it (like the end) are as source material. The music didn't help either.

The casting is also mostly bad. Tim Holt isn't the right actor for the critical part of George. Cotton, with his aristocratic bearing, is also totally wrong for his part. Angnes Moorhead is of course the exception. She was cast in a part that was ideal for her and arguably gave the performance of her career in the film.

And the truth should be told about what happened to this film. Orson Welles walked away from it. A couple days after filming had been completed, he ran away to make another film in South America. He made the personal decision to abandon Ambersons and he has to bear a large portion of the responsiblity for what happened after. Much of the greatness of Citizen Kane was accomplished in the editing of the film. To suggest that Welles had even produced a true rough cut by the time he left the US is likely an overstatement.

He tried to edit the film via telegram between parties and film shoots in Rio. But it didn't work. How could anyone edit a film via telegram? And then when the crisis came, he wandered around south america for a month playing around rather than rushing back to save ""Ambersons"".

We are constantlty told that ""his"" cut of the film was somehow lost. But the ugly truth is that he seems never to have produced a cut himself at all. It would be more accurate to say that elements of the Robert Wise cut were lost. To even credit Welles with having cut the film is giving him more credit that his involvement deserves. Welles ultimately made the decision that being in Rio for Carnaval was more important than anything to do with ""Ambersons"". And a person who walks away from their own work and hands it off to others to finish can't later claim to have been an artistic victim.

As to the film itself, there are some moments of technical brillance. Some moments of good writing. Some nice film composition. And there is Agnes Moorhead's performance. The narration pieces at points in the film are excellent. But the casting of key characters like George, the story, and dark plodding mood of the whole thing make it a very flawed film.

I think the film could have probably been saved in editing. But not by any editor other than Welles himself. And certainly not by staff like Robert Wise, no matter how talented, trying to edit the film based on telegrams.

If RKO (the studio) made a mistake, it was in allowing Welles to leave the country before editing the film. That single decision doomed the film.

The actual movie - although butchered by a pack of money-mad pirates prior to the film's initial release back in 1942 - was most probably as magnificent as its title indirectly suggests.  What remains of Welles' original vision is still magnificent.  The dastardly doings of meddlers who cut here and there with all the perverse glee of cinematic Jack the Rippers and the replacement footage shot by hacks for an idiotic restructuring of the original film go far in compromising the impact and power of what was most assuredly in the original version.  All of RKO's inept attempts to make the film a better one have merely ruined a masterpiece.  What happened is somewhat akin to far lesser artists cutting apart Da Vinci's ""The Last Supper"" and rearranging the apostles and even leaving a few out of the picture all together.  So, in its original form, AMBERSONS would most likely have garnered a full five stars.  Compromised by morons and strictly viewed as just a movie...three stars seems more honest.

Sadly, on these boards we commentators cannot accord votes to a product's various elements. I wish that such a system were enacted by Amazon, as too often folks have to explain why a certain something only gets a few stars - with the reason often being that the stars are for the quality of the item and not the quality of what the item is presenting.  In this case - after having waited years for THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS to finally become available on DVD - what does Warner Brothers do to make this moment memorable?  Pitifully, hardly a thing!  No commentary whatsoever - even though the story of the plight of this ruined masterwork is a tale that must be told!  No assemblage via frame grabs or story boards of what the actual Welles version was like before it was previewed in Pomona! (The picture of Joe Cotton and Agnes Moorehead on the DVD's backside is, ironically, a picture from the original ending before it was cut out and destroyed and its ending sickeningly re-shot.) But perhaps the shabbiest thing of all is that the DVD has NO chapter stops!!!  WB initially released this film as part of a package deal when the recent 60th anniversary release of CITIZEN KANE graced store shelves late last year.  Back then, if you wanted AMBERSONS you had to shell out for both films.  Now it is available individually.  I am happy it is finally on more durable DVD and not tangle-prone tape.  But....is this the best Warner Brothers can do???  Doesn't this already savaged and mutilated masterpiece deserve much, much better?????

I think so!!!  P.S.  Am I in the Twilight Zone or what? Who is Georgia Backus and why is she the only person listed beside the DVD title here on Amazon?  The IMDB tells us that she played a ""matron"" in AMBERSONS.  Wouldn't it have been far wiser to list Agnes Moorehead or Anne Baxter or Dolores Costello instead????

Directed by Orson Welles

Believe this is a better film than 'Citizen Kane' in some ways.  With one of my favorite character actresses from radio and the cinema, Miss Agnes Moorehead, she's nails every role she appears in, Miss Moorehead is sorely missed in the media and in this household.

The young & handsome Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten) wants to marry Isabel Amberson (Dolores Costello), daughter of a rich upper-class family, but she instead marries Wilbur Minafer. Years later, Eugene comes back, now a mature widower and a successful automobile maker. After Wilbur dies, Eugene again asks Isabel to marry him, and she is receptive. But Isabel & Wilbur's only child, George (Tim Holt) resents the attentions paid to his mother, and he and aunt Fanny (Agnes Moorehead) set about sabotaging the romance.

A Tour de Force from Orson Welles - Academy Award nominations for Picture, Best Supporting Actress (Agnes Moorehead), Cinematography (B&W) & Art (B&W)

* Special footnote: -- RKO chopped 50 minutes of the film and added a happy ending while Orson Welles was out of the country. The footage was subsequently destroyed; the only record of the removed scenes is the cutting continuity transcript ~ Interesting that Tim Holt and Anne Baxter walk past a movie theater advertising a film starring Jack Holt, Tim's father.

The Wells style, used so effectively in ""Citizen Kane,"" is totally botched here. Wells style of having people talk over and interrupt each other (used for realism) is effective in ""Kane,"" but badly misses here. Even the redemption scene at the end does not get the message across. I usually like the Wells films, but this one is a flop.",1269388800,7,485,4.586206896551724
335601,2,6301564456,"Orson Welles (1915-85) made only one truly magnificent film, and it wasn't about the Ambersons.

Welles' film was originally 131 minutes long, but the final cut, by editor Robert Wise (who would later direct such films as ""West Side Story,"" ""I Want to Live"", ""The Sound of Music""), reduced it to 88 minutes. Welles said it had been edited ""by a lawnmower"". Scenes were cut that included George's interaction with his peers in a secret society, the financial ruin of the Ambersons (only hinted at in the final version), the final death of the Major, a room by room tour of the deserted mansion, the meeting between Eugene and Fanny after Fanny has moved to a boarding house, etc. The ending was completely re-shot to be more upbeat.

BTW - Wise (1914-2005) got the chance to shoot several new scenes for the film, and this helped launch his career from editor to director. His first film as a director was the much over-rated ""The Curse of the Cat People"" (1944) which actually used the sets from ""Ambersons"". He continued to make unremarkable films until 1951 when he scored with ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". Wise's role in the severe editing of ""The Ambersons"" is unclear. He had worked with Welles on ""Kane"" and Welles considered his work with RKO to be a betrayal. They remained enemies for the rest of their lives.

The film is based on Booth Tarkington's Pulitzer Prize winning 1918 novel which was part of a trilogy about the effects of industrialization. The George character in the film mirrors many aspects of Tarkington's life - Tarkington was from a prominent family in a mid western town, had relatives in politics, had traveled around the world, and his patrician family lost most of its wealth in the Panic of 1873 (interestingly enough, this is where the film starts). Unlike George, however, Tarkington could ""do"" things and was married twice. There is some speculation that George is also based on Welles himself. Welles real first name is George and the Welles and Tarkington families knew each other. Indeed, Welles played George in his 1939 radio production of the novel for his Mercury Theatre. Ray Collins was the only cast member to have been in the 1939 radio production and the part of Aunt Fanny was absent. Welles used a copy of the radio production to convince RKO to make his film.

The film stars several Mercury Theatre alumni including Joseph Cotton, Agnes Morehead, and Ray Collins.

Joseph Cotton (1905-94) was a close friend of Welles and appeared in ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), ""Journey into Fear"" (1943), ""The Third Man"" and ""Touch of Evil (1958). He went on to star in such memorable films as ""Gaslight"" (1944), ""Duel in the Sun"" (1946) and ""Portrait of Jennie"" (1948). He continued acting until 1981.

Agnes Morehead (1900-74) earned an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress, one of four she would earn over her career (""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"", ""Johnny Belinda"", ""Mrs Parkington""), along with 6 Emmy nominations for her role in ""Bewitched"" and a win for a role in ""Wild Wild West"" (1965). She won two Golden Globes.

Ray Collins (1889-1965) appeared in ""Kane"", ""Ambersons"" and did a great job as the DA in ""Touch of Evil"" (1958) which was his last film before moving to TV where he appeared as Lt. Tragg on ""Perry Mason"".

Tim Holt (1919-73) is little remembered today. He had a small role in Ford's ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946) but is best remembered as the prospector who is killed by Humphrey Bogart in ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1948).

Welles uses his deep focus photography, shadows, and image size to great effect. His grace with the moving camera is also evident in the ballroom scene, in the multi-level conversations at the mansion, and in street scenes. For his time, these are all revolutionary camera work and remain some of our finest examples. Scenes are staged so elegantly that they appear to be paintings, a skill matched only by Stanley Kubrick and John Ford.

The film was a commercial failure. It cost $1,000,000 and was said to lose over $600,000. ""Kane"" had also been a commercial failure, and in fact, ironically this resulted in the resignation of RKO executive George Schaefer, who had played such a large part in editing the ""Ambersons."" Of course, bear in mind that 1942 was the start of our entry into World War 2, so a depressing film about the perils of industrialization and the fall of a great family were not culturally sanctioned. Some big hits from that year were ""Bambi"", screwball comedies ""The Man Who Came to Dinner"", ""Talk of the Town"" and ""The Palm Beach Story"", Jack Benny's ""To Be or Not to Be"", ""The Pride of the Yankees"", and ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"".

From a critical POV the film was a success, achieving 4 academy awards nominations (Picture, Supporting Actress, Art Direction, and Cinematography)  and Agnes Morehead won the New York Film Critic Award as Best Actress.

Some fun things to look for -

- When Tim Holt and Anne Baxter walk past a movie theatre, the film playing stars Tim's father, Jack Holt.

- In the paper reporting George's accident, the left hand column features ""Jed Leland"" - Joseph Cotton's identity in ""Kane"".

Although considered by many to be a great film, personally I find it mediocre. True, Welles is active with lots of camera tricks that make it an interesting film to watch, but the omnipresent violin accompaniments are annoying, and the constant use of fade to black gets annoying. Moreover there is entirely too much time spent on the romance between Joseph Cotton and Dolores Costello, at the expense of the film's theme which is the response of a family (and a town/city) to industrialization. True, much of the theme related scenes were cut from the final production, so there is no way to say what might have been.

In addition, there is a fundamental lack of exposition regarding the two romances - Eugene and Isabel, and George and Lucy. It's difficult to fathom what the appeal is for Eugene or for Lucy. Isabel is not particularly pretty, nor insightful, and as she ages her seeming incestuous relationship with her son gives her no credentials in the prospective mating department. George's appeal is even stranger. For most of the film he has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Of course we know love has no reason, but that isn't the theme of the film, so a romance with two such questionable characters is strange indeed. Moreover, there is something vaguely distasteful in the Eugene Lucy relationship, changing from pimp to incestuous father and back again. If this is meant as subtext, there is little else to support it, so it stays beneath the surface without resolution.

Welles fans will find much to enjoy here, but I don't think it's in a league with ""Kane"".",1267142400,12,6748,4.807592752372735
335602,5,6301564456,"While `Citizen Kane' is a masterful film to say the least, and one that I will always admire, respect and laud; `The Magnificent Ambersons' is, without question, Orson Welles's masterpiece.  A film that is the epitome of poetry in motion, `The Magnificent Ambersons' can certainly steal descriptions from its very name, for it is `magnificent'.  The fact that the studio could go in without the director's consent, completely butcher his film (taking out roughly forty minutes or so of footage), change the ending and strip away the films `heart' as Welles would put it, and yet still leave us with such a brilliant picture is outstanding.

I am saddened that I will never see the film Welles intended me to see, but I cannot fathom how this could be much better than it already is.

Despite the short running time, the film never lacks in character development, which is a true testament to the script, the acting and Welles impressive grasp of direction.  The film is beautifully fluid, allowing each scene to simply float into the next, giving us a relaxed composition that aids in our attentiveness and willingness to get to know each character.  I loved Welles's narration, which really helped tie up lose ends, and I felt that the films overall construction is really to be desired.  It just fits, each piece, perfectly together.

The story told is that of a wealthy and well known family living in Indiana during the late 19th century.  The film chronicles the fall of the Amberson household at the hands of the young, selfish and rather spoiled George.  The film shows how his actions pay a heavy toll of his family, most notably his mother Isabel, ruining her shot at a second love with the wealthy inventor Eugene.  His Aunt Fanny is also affected by his manipulative interferences, not to mention Lucy, the girl who is tangled up in his heart (and he in hers).

The film is littered with wonderful performances, but for me it is two names that really outshine the rest.  Joseph Cotton is outstanding as Eugene, really developing his disappointment and disapproval without appearing clich&eacute;d or predictable.  He delivers a superb and memorable performance that is so close to `best in show' it's not even funny.  Those honors though, go to the brilliant Agnes Moorehead, who delivers one of the greatest supporting performances of all time.  She just commands every scene, and her teary emotional explosion in the boiler room is just unforgettable.

This is a hard one to find, but if you find it HOLD ONTO IT!  TCM plays it occasionally (if you can DVR it, protect it!) and I think you can find it youtube, so you can at least see it (in parts).  It is a film that I deeply respect, adore and highly recommend.",1258934400,3,2727,4.763829787234043
335603,5,6301564456,"I cannot say anything more about, ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" that has not already been said.

335605,5,6301564456,"There is nobody like Orson Welles. The man can even end a film with this looming microphone swinging in the distance, and it seems more like art than what is released today. My favorite director/actor, Welles proved once and again that what lurks in the shadows are men, and their spirits are more sinister than anything a horror film could produce. Being an avid fan of Citizen Kane, I wanted to experience more - and that is where The Magnificent Ambersons comes into play. Surprisingly, I didn't even know anything about the drama behind this film. I wasn't privy to the knowledge that the studio burned most of Welles' 113 minute long cut, and instead kept with this 88-minute version ... which ... in my eyes ... is still a powerful film. I didn't know he didn't have much say over the final results, and instead, was left with a choppy, studio-driven version that left a soured note in his eye. Oh, the drama. Yet, here it is - found on VHS for now, this was a powerful film about the turn of the century, the introduction to modern technology, and the depression of the status quo. Oddly, created in 1942, this film seems more relevant today - with the current economic distress - and making the overall experience a powerful Welles outing.

I would first like to say that any film that focuses on a central character getting his ""come-uppances"", is already going to receive high marks. Secondly, narration by Welles himself - guess I asked for a second scoop of cinematic pleasure. The only downside was that Welles should have played the role of George. I completely understand that he didn't want another Kane looming in the distance, but he obviously pulled a Woody Allen trick, where he wasn't the lead role, but had the actor take his mannerisms. Ergo, he was in the film. With that small element aside, the narration did add a rather strong voice to this film. Giving us an everyman's town, a place not unlike where we all live now, with the wealthy experiencing the same issues many of us see daily. That is what pulled my strings the most with The Magnificent Ambersons was Welles' ability to pull such an ordinary event into the view of this wealthy family. We see these things happen all the time with average couples in film, so it was a distinction to see it happen to the wealthy Ambersons. This story is simple, and I am eager to read Booth Tarkington's version as well, just to see what Welles left out. I want to get to know these characters more - and the book should bring that to me.

To end, I loved this film for more than just the actors and the narration. I loved the introduction of the automobile into the story. I loved how the ending (albeit choppy) pulled in more than just a dramatic closure, it spoke to audience about fears, modern advances, and the uncertainty of life. It transformed this film about the turn of the century into a film that could be watched today - nearly 67 years later - and find current relevances. It is more than just a story about a family. This is a story about the future, about depression, about love, and about children. It is about small town America - it is about the changing world - it is about Welles' deep dark soul. This isn't a happy film. In fact, it is rather full of gloom and doom, but it is 100% Welles (or at least the parts not taken out). I loved the cinematography, the looming dark scenes coupled with Welles shadow angles. It was brilliant - from beginning to end, this is not the film you expect when you sit down. This isn't a love story. This is a life story.

The Magnificent Ambersons is known more for what it represented in Orson Welles's film career than as a film itself, but if you get a chance you should check out this well-made slice of family drama that admittedly gets murky towards the end (where the studio's fingerprints are all over it) but is a fine companion piece to Citizen Kane even if it's not the complete version.

The second unkindest cut of all is that it is not available in U.S. format at this writing, on DVD.  There are possibly two generations of Americans who have not seen it.  Those lucky foreigners who DO have the movie.  It is a great and bittersweet story of a family at the turn of the century, their relationship dramas and the trauma of going from a pioneer society to an industrialized one--one that we are similarly going through now because of the techno-revolution.  Products become outdated as soon as they are manufactured, fortunes are lost, new fortunes are gained, the ""haves"" trade places with the ""have-nots"" and back again several times over.

A story of one stubborn and unflinching wealthy family and what happens when they cross paths with an idealistic father and daughter. There's romance and curiosity that draws them together while suspicion, jealousy and selfishness that keeps them apart. It is photographed with stunning results. Welles' tragedy is as spellbinding as a Shakespeare play. The camera shots and sets are incredible!

Welles uses camera movements and techniques that define modern cinema; background dialogue interloping with foreground dialogue, depth of field to show two actions at once and then bringing both foreground and background into one shot without editing. And the editing is brilliant with a certain playfulness in many scenes that again personifies the modern sensibility of modern cinema to a larger effect than most modern concepts that have been introduced to cinema since; all to say that Welles was most probably influenced by Hitchcock's British films of the thirties or is it two brilliant minds think alike?",1226188800,,1130,5.348314606741573
335639,5,6301564456,"This 1942 classic was written, produced and directed by Orson Welles (who is also the narrator) and based on the 1918 novel of the same name by Booth Tarkington.

The movie chronicles the life of Isabel Amberson/Minafer (Dolores Costello) - a matriarch of an Indianapolis family dynasty - and her pompous son, George Minafer (Tim Holt), who destroys what has taken several generations to create due to his jealousies and greed.

With the backdrop of old money and the new ways to seize a slice of the American Dream, it is a timeless story of a perilous journey on eroding trails in life during the heavy rains and cold crosswinds that are bringing permanent change.

The original rough cut by Welles clocked in at an epic length of 2-hours, 28-minutes, but he ultimately lost control of the final editing to the studio, RKO. About one hour was deleted and a different ending was shot. There are no surviving prints of the rough cut.

In 1991, the movie was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. It was included in Sight and Sound's 1972 and 1982 lists of the top 10 films ever made.

The fact that it's not available at all in a region 1 version, even a poorly executed edition, tells us much about those who run the media conglomerates that control the rights to film masterpieces like the Magnificent Ambersons.

The executives at such corporations must be coarse, unsophisticated, lawyeresque troglodytes, the type who eat $100 ala carte steaks while quaffing a central valley merlot in trendy restuarants... and if they even know of Agnes Moorehead, it's as Samantha's mother from Bewitched. There is no sense of culture, no concept of history, no love of cinema, much less any understanding of art and its importance to culture and life.

And yet, they are, quite simply, among the most powerful driving forces in modern American culture. They'll put American Pie on DVD, but not the Magnificent Ambersons. That is very, very depressing.

335642,5,6301564456,"Although 99% of movie buffs, experts, etc., believe Citizen Kane to be Orson Welles' greatest film ever made, I beg to differ with them.

I will, however, grant them that Citizen Kane is his greatest complete film. It is such a shame that nobody has yet found any of the pieces recklessly cut from this, certainly, his greatest masterpiece.

Don't get me wrong, I dearly love Kane, and Macbeth, King Lear and The Stranger, amongst his others, but Magnificent Ambersons is a towering achievement. While we could all stand around and wring our hands, and say ""but it's not complete, how can we get anything out of this?"" and stuff like that, we should be thinking that we very likely would not have what we do, had he not put up as much of a fight as he did to save it, with, I assume, some hollywood supporters that he luckily did have.

The care, and effort put into this film, photographically, is mind stunning...the man was a genious, and he understood lighting, depth perception, and stuff like that, instinctively...if not, then very well learned. The very opening sequence from a photographic viewpoint is an absolute piece of genious. So many places throughout this film are simply mind-boggling as far as from a creative standpoint. The complete understanding of black and white photography, and what would and would not hold up cinemagraphically were all thoroughly explored and understood by this great ""misunderstood"" master. His core group of actors, all carefully chosen, and able to work together like clockwork, I have always felt was not completely fathomed by many also.

Of course, probably the grandest thing about this film, was the tracking rails laid throughout the house for filming this masterpiece, allowing the camera to roll from room to room, and around rooms. This had never been done before, and it was a major achievement for film-making, and would, later, be championed by Alfred Hitchcock, (in particular) among other great directors. Also, Welles was a master at ""deep focus"" photography, used extensively in Citizen Kane. Here, also many scenes demonstrate the powerful effects of great, large, scenes with everything in crystal-sharp focus throughout the image, from foreground to the deepest recesses of the background.

As far as the big, bleeding, chunks that have been cut from it; well, one can only surmise what might or might not be missing. But, you can bet ""a lot."" So, for insight to what may have been removed, we must consult Booth Tarkington's book. From here, then, we must sort this out ourselves. We DO, however, know that we are missing 50 minutes, cut and thrown away, taking this 131 minute masterpiece to 88 minutes... I always wax sad, here, when thinking, and wish, and wonder, why we were not lucky enough to have had someone in hollywood, in Welles' later years, back the production of a reconstructed, refilmed version of the complete screenplay. Alas, this never happened.

But, again, we are extremely lucky to have the footage that we do. And, I personally am grateful every time I watch this great film (I have the Criterian LaserDisc S/E of it).

This Masterpiece desperately needs to be brought out on DVD, the public should be CLAMORING and SCREAMING; DEMANDING it's DVD release, and letting their voices be heard! ~operabruin",1185580800,10,3294,4.935018050541516
335643,5,6301564456,"After intense study I have changed my view of this film. I believe we are lucky to have this version of the movie. Welles had his chance to edit the film and came up with some very strange cuts. He reduced the ""rough"" cut of 131 minutes to 110 minutes. In doing so he left out some of the best scenes and also left out the emotional core of the film. When the film was previewed it was a disaster. For the second preview editor Robert Wise, who Welles had given complete authority while he was filming a documentary in South America, added back most of Welles' ""big cut""(the elmination of everything from Isabel recieving Eugene's letter to the family gathered outside her room before her death) and cut other scenes that had not worked. This second edit was 117 minutes. The second preview did better but there were still problems. Wise and others associated with the film and who were all friends of Welles came up with a compromise plan. Welles accepted some of the cuts and additions. He even agreed to the reshuffling of scenes after the death of the Major. However, he still wanted his ""big cut"" of 13 minutes and 40 seconds. He wanted to preserve the ballroom scene, the montage sequences, and his revised ending. It was only at this point, after two and a half months of effort, that studio head George Schaefer told Wise to do what was necessary to fix the film. Schaefer's indulgence of Welles led to him losing his job shortly after this. After two more previews and more cuts and additions the film was released at 88 minutes. Post-production was compelted before the new studio head took over. So the film was finished by people who had a stake in the film and were friends of Welles. Wise did an outstanding job editing the film, as one would expect of the man who edited ""Citizen Kane"" and later would win two Oscars for best director. The only filmic element we lost was the ""dancing camera"" effect in the ballroom scene. The reason for the edits in this scene was bad acting and poor audience reaction. Small portions of the montage sequences were also cut. The audience was restless during these and the cuts tightened them up. Some of the scenes that were cut were unnecessary, long and boring dialogue sequences. The new and reshot scenes were unavoidable due to bad acting and poor audience reaction. It would have been better to have Welles do these sequences. However, that was impossible because he was in South America. We are very lucky to have as fine a film as we have. Welles was mostly upset about the new ending. However, he agreed with the rest of the film and he did not ask for his name to be taken off. I think he was mad that it turned out so well without his direct participation! At times it seemed as though he was trying to destroy his own film! I can now watch the film without thinking that we lost a masterpiece. If we ever find the ""rough"" cut, thats what we will have, a ""rough"" cut, not a finished film. If Welles would have had nine months to edit his ""rough"" cut I am sure we would have a masterpiece to rival ""Citzen Kane."" But given the circumstances that was not to be. I am glad we have what we have. It is a five star classic movie.",1181260800,8,3185,4.418367346938775

The film still remains a brilliant and ironic portrait of a declining aristocratic 19th century family but the final part feels like a lot's been taken from there. At least, the unique end credits when Welles introduces the cast and all members of the crew were left alone. Still, it is an awesome film with every scene arranged and shot like a rare painting. The one which is imprinted in my mind is the scene when Eugene is leaving Isabelle's (the love of his life) house forever and Isabel's arrogant son George (who will finally get his come-uppance) is watching him through the window in his mother's room.

335705,4,6301564456,"Most of you have already read the synopsis, so it won't be repeated here.

Many of the reviews have commented on the acting; I couldn't disagree more on this issue. Based on the personality of the characters, I believe the acting is exactly as it should be. Major Amberson and Uncle Jack, stoic characters in the book, would have acted exactly as they were portrayed by the actors. Aunt Fanny would have acted as hysterically as Agnes Moorehead portrayed her. Wilbur Minafer, ditto.

I agree that Lucy was portrayed as overly mature and unduly wise, but this could have been partly the director's fault. Tim Holt may have been miscast; somehow, his portrayal of George Minafer does seem a bit ""off"".

The first half of the film, cuts notwithstanding, still stands out as a masterpiece of cinematography. Catch the long takes of the ballroom sequence and the kitchen scene with George and Fanny. It makes you wist for what must have been; these scenes, as powerful as they are, were cut, blunting their already intense impact. Mention should be made of Stanley Cortez's camera work. The use of shadows, and complex lighting arrangements, give it an unforgettable look. The scene with Fanny at the boiler was filmed with Cortez and one other director. The different use of lighting is immediately obvious and jarring to the senses.

After reading the original cutting script of the movie, the much maligned cuts really do appear to have ruined the movie. Much character development was cut; important plot points concerning the decline of the Amberson's fortune are also gone. For those interested, the cutting script really does seem to have made a much better movie than the print RKO left us with.

The kitchen scene seems to be the turning point; after this scene, the movie as cut by the studio suffers very badly. It's a mish-mash of almost-disconnected scenes that makes almost no sense. Before-the-kitchen scene and after-the-kitchen scene almost play as two different movies. These cuts are obvious even to the casual observer;  for example, quite suddenly, and for no apparent reason, George's character softens dramatically. In addition, scenes that aren't remotely connected to each other in content jar the senses due to their close proximity. The last half of the movie, simply put, is a mess.

It's because of the last half--and the much-discussed butchering of this movie by the studio--that I must give this movie a 4, rather than the 5 that it certainly would have gotten in the original form.",1155859200,3,2509,4.945368171021378

335707,2,6301564456,"Based on the largely glowing reviews of this film, Orson Welles' second, it seems to be a hit with his die hard fans.

While impressed with the all-star cast, however, I was not blown away by the script, the performances, or the movie as a whole. The problem is bigger, I think, than a half hour worth of segments sliced from the 88 minute film by Welles' RKO editors while he was traveling in South America.

The story tells of the long decline of a wealthy New England family in a small nameless town, where during the 1870s and 1880s, everyone knew everyone's business. After a brief narration and a scan of several of the town's fancy houses, small and large, the camera focuses on the largest mansion of them all, that of the Ambersons.

Outside the neat and gated front yard, a drunken Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten) attempts to play a serenade to the love of his life, Isabel Amberson (Dolores Costello), who is watching him from a curtained second-story bedroom window. But Morgan trips and falls on his cello, smashing it. Humiliated, Isabel from that moment on refuses his calls to her home, his boxed gifts and flowers.

Very shortly, the humiliated Isabel begins dating another man, Wilbur Minafer (Don Dillaway), whom she marries. Almost at that moment, a neighbor predicts that Isabel will have an unhappy marriage and many children whom she will spoil as a result.

Wilbur is staid, somber and altogether more serious than Morgan. So it's understandable when it ultimately comes out that Isabel was in love with Morgan all along, albeit faithful to Minafer until his death. But her neighbor was correct: her son George (Tim Holt) is indeed a spoiled brat --- both in his early youth and as a young, recent college graduate. Indeed, he begins insulting guests almost the moment they begin to arrive at a grand party his mother has thrown to celebrate his homecoming.

And one of those chaps he insults is none other than Morgan, now a widower, who after many years of moving from place to place throughout the U.S., has at last come home to town, with his devoted daughter Lucy Morgan (Anne Baxter, granddaughter of architect Frank Lloyd Wright). As time goes on, the Minafers spend more and more time with the Morgans, while George unsuccessfully courts Lucy. She rejects him because George, ever the profligate son, is determined never to work in any ""useless"" profession --- law, medicine, engineering or anything else --- but simply to live the good life, as a charitable gentleman.

Wilbur, worried about his investments in stocks, appears to lose money, and dies young. Lucy's father Eugene Morgan is then free to rekindle his old flame with Wilbur's chaste but widowed wife Isabel.

Minafer's spinster sister Fanny (Agnes Moorehead) also eventually turns out to have lost everything in an unsound investment. She grows increasingly jealous of Isabel, but ultimately defends her in the face of George's insatiable jealousy of his mother.

Now to the problems: While costumes replicate the clothing of the early twentieth century era that most of the film is supposed to cover, the dialogue most certainly does not. I admittedly have not read Booth Tarkington's Pulitzer Prize winning 1918 novel of the same name, but I seriously doubt that conversations in that book are filled with 1940s lingo, which is terribly out of place here. Georgie is always exclaiming, ""Look here,"" and ""Now see here,"" and calls everyone all manner of names in a definitive World War II style.

Holt's Georgie is selfish to the hilt, as Tarkington undoubtedly meant him to be, but there is also something phony, flat, and, well, Hollywood, about the performance that just doesn't fit.

The same is true of the acting by many of the other big names. They play their roles well, but in the typical style of 1940s melodrama. Besides for failing to develop as the story moves along, most of the characters remain flat, and lack authenticity. I can see why Agnes Moorehead's Aunt Fanny was derided by the film's early critics. And I can see why the film flopped.

Orson Welles fans may swoon over this classic, which perhaps contains special technical feats never seen before he produced it.

Nevertheless, all of a piece, the movie is just not that good.

Question: Thanks first of all for the excellent catalogue 2-disc special editions we've been seeing. Now, what is the status on The Magnificent Ambersons?

[Warner] We're still looking for better materials on AMBERSONS. We waited for KONG and KANE and it was worth it. It will be worth it for the AMBERSONS, and yes,we will release JOURNEY INTO FEAR when we do AMBERSONS.

Thus, one of the great films of all time might just see home release after all.  I, personally would pay the extra for a single-edition now, and certainly still purchase the potential two-disc edition when it's released.  The fact of the matter is that Welles is finally receiving the notice and respect he always deserved.  I know any film fan hoped for a Criterion edition of Ambersons, but this new ""Complete Mr. Arkadin"" surely can rank as being greatly anticipated.  The fantastic critic Jonathan Rosenbaum is completing his ""Discovering Orson Welles"" right now, which should be just as delightful.  Surely Ambersons released in its original form would the be Coup de' gras for Welles lovers, and my personal anticipation combined with just a questionable little rumor allows for a great amount of excitment to stir.

335709,3,6301564456,"The Magnificent Ambersons is an interesting film but not a great one, in my book.  Like so many others of the old movies,it seemed to me very creaky and the acting either flat, hammy or over-the-top (in the case of Agnes Moorehead, particularly).  It was a reasonably engrossing tale of the rise and fall of a family that wasn't able to move with the times and was afflicted with an arrogant twit of an heir to make matters worse;  but the characterizations of the family members and friends were curiously deadpan for people supposedly in the throes of strong passions.  Only Georgie Minifer and his Aunt Fanny expressed their feelings as they might have been expected to and their rantings seemed curiously detached from the realities.  The Welles touch was certainly apparent in the moody cinematography and the voice-over narration, and those were the best parts of the film.  I couldn't see that the ending made much difference one way or another since it was all over long before the final frames.  I found myself thinking that the modern remake of the movie wasn't that bad, after all, although I had thought it pretty poor at the time.",1139788800,12,1143,4.742424242424242

Welles did not sleep in the laurels and decided to recreate the declining portrait  of a wealthy Midwestern family and the comeuppance of the youngest member of the family.

Filmed in the middle of the WW2, the film still captures all the quintessence of the sweet smell of the decadence but told with impeccable good taste.

You can even appreciate the powerful and remarkable influence of the supreme Master of the American Cinema who would die absolutely forgotten in a hotel of L.A. in 1948: David Ward Griffith.

335711,4,6301564456,"I didn't really love THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, and I hoped for years that more footage would show up to let us in on what Welles had in mind to round out the picture.  He had said in interviews (with Peter Bogdanovich) that RKO's cutting supervised by Robert Wise took out the ""heart"" of the movie.  But even Welles' best movies aren't much for the heart.  Their appeal is not about ordinary humanism or even emotion; they are studies in disintegration, really a series of physics experiments conducted on studio time.

Reading the novel by Tarkington I can see where a longer movie might have filled out the sidelights some more, and perhaps given us a broader social picture of society way back when, but does the cut version have any important plot points taken out?  I've looked at the ""reconstruction"" book which prints the shooting script and shows where dialogue was filmed, and what kind of scenes were shot then killed, and I'm still not convinced that TMA would have made a good movie.  The Alfonso Arau version, in that lovely Mexican color and Jennifer Tilly, used the entire shooting script and it still wasn't enough to draw you in with its intimate knowledge of the heart.

The truth is (what am I saying?  I mean, ""My feeling is"") that there's something basically awry in the original conception of the plot, and this is a fault that goes right back to Tarkington, and that is that George is not much of a hero, or even an anti-hero.  It's as though THE CHILDREN'S HOUR was entirely focussed on the little Bonita Granville character and we saw everything through her eyes.  What's great about TMA is the photography and the casting.  Anne Baxter is, on the face of it, quite the wrong actress to play Lucy Morgan, Joseph Cotten's daughter.  She's too mature, too wise, and to anyone it would be obvious George is a selfish nut who doesn't deserve her affections--to anyone especially Anne Baxter; and yet she brings a exuberant life to a movie that suffers from the dry heaves mostly.  Dolores Costello, once married to Barrymore, the heroine of Curtis' epic NOAH'S ARK and Selznick's wonderful LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY, shines at age 39 playing Isabel, George's mother, Gertrude to his Hamlet.  Costello should have kept acting for years and years, shame that the failure of TMA hastened her retirement from cinema.  Tim Holt does wonders with the role of George, but talk about a thankless part!

(Are there stills from the cut shots of the streets gradually filling up with automobiles? No one ever talks about those but a lot of atmosphere was lost from those cuts too, I think.) Having that footage on a DVD would be helpful because Carringer's book is hard to get hold of -- expensive and not available in many libraries.

I did find it odd finally reading the novel and discovering that RKO's dumb tacked-on ending was actually closer to the book than Welles' ending -- it's almost appropriate that the cinematography was so bad in that part the film, given how flat and silly Tarkington's writing goes at the end!

What mars the picture, however, and prevents it from being fully realized, are the last 5 minutes: the studio wanted a syrupy, happy ending; Welles refused and walked out.

Welles' managed to follow up his landmark debut ""Citizen Kane"" with another masterpiece, despite studio meddling which reduced the film's length by 43 minutes.
Eschewing ""Kane's"" fragmented structure, ""Ambersons"" employs a linear narrative to chronicle the rise and fall of the Amberson family, who become an allegory for pre-industrialized America.  Though the film undeniably laments the passing of the simpler, 19th century way of life (most effectively in a nostalgic prelude narrated by Welles himself), the conflict between past and progress is complicated by the impudence of George Minafer (Tim Holt), scion of the Ambersons, and the amiability of Joseph Cotten as the inventor whose automobiles contribute to the decline of the Ambersons' magnificence.  ""Ambersons"" is characterized by masterfully choreographed long takes, which allow Welles to extract thematic content from the material through sheer compositional virtuosity.

335750,5,6301564456,"""The Magnificent Ambersons"" is two stories rolled up into one.  I will explain them one at a time.
First of all, it is the story of a late nineteenth century family, the Ambersons.  The Ambersons are a large, wealthy, New England family who are held in high esteem in their community.  They live in a large, beautiful mansion where they hold balls and invite all the town folk.
Unfortunately, the Ambersons are also very old fashioned and are unable to keep up with the changing times.  When Wilbur Minafer dies, it is discovered that he has made some bad investments that has left the Amberson clan bankrupt.  Meanwhile, his widow Isabel Amberson begins to see her old flame Eugene whom she had stood up years before.  Eugene is in the process of developing a new contraption called an ""automobile"".  Eugene is prospering while the Ambersons are going bankrupt.  Also, as one of the Ambersons points out, if automobiles become common and roads are built around their property, then the houses will lose their value.  This leads to a wise speech that Eugene gives in response to a rude comment that George makes about Eugene's profession.
Indeed, it's not only financially that the Ambersons have trouble adjusting to.  George Amberson Minafer, the son of Isabel, has grown from a spoiled young child to a spoiled young adult.  He is the scallion of the Amberson clan and the Isabel's pet son.  He is the person that the neighbors keep predicting will one day get ""his comeuppance"".  George does not approve of his mother's relationship with Eugene and is determined to pressure her into breaking things off with him.
""The Magnificent Ambersons"" is an affectionate look at a bigone era and a dark look into the changes that the automobile brought to some families at the dawn of the twentieth century.  It was adapted from a novel by Booth Tarkington and directed with care and affection by Orson Welles.  Welles had previously done a radio play adaptation of the Ambersons with himself in the role of George.  As in that play, Welles narrates throughout the film, even signing off at the end.  The black and white cinematography is gorgeous, indeed some of the shots bring to mind some of the pictures I've seen of nineteenth century houses.  The music score by an uncredited Bernard Herman adds just the right touch.
However it's impossible to watch this film without thinking about the effect it had on Orson Welles.  Which brings me to the second part of the story.  George Orson Welles was a child prodege who, as he put it, had ""genius"" whispered into his ear from the time he was born.  Starting in the thirties, sixteen-year-old Welles bluffed his way on stage into a Shakespearian production carving out a career as an actor.  He also formed the ""Mercury Theatre"" which produced some highly original stage and radio plays.  His radio production of ""War of the Worlds"" scared people across the country into believing that Martians had invaded Earth.  On top of all that, Welles successfully broke into films making ""Citizen Kane"" for RKO, arguably the greatest film of all time.  And this was all before he was twenty-six!
By this point, many of Welles' detractors were just waiting for Welles to get his ""comeuppance"".  They wouldn't have to wait long.  While Welles was away shooting a documentary in South America, RKO cut 45 minutes from the Ambersons and added three minutes after the film tested badly at a preview screening composed of rambunctious teenagers.  RKO then put a stop to Welles' documentary and released the Ambersons with few previews where it flopped badly.  While it's a testament to Welles' talents that a film that was so obviously butchered can still get a five star rating, the lost footage is still one of the ultimate Hollywood tragedies.
As for Welles, he suddenly found himself with an undeserved reputation as an unreliable director and a spendthrift.  Welles' career never fully recovered, and although he would manage to cough up enough money to continue his film career, he would never again have the artistic and financial freedom that he had once enjoyed.
Like George Amberson Minafer, George Orson Welles finally got his comeuppance.  He got it three times over and brimming.",1029888000,17,4221,4.861538461538461
335751,5,6301564456,"The sad production story of ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (1942), Orson Welles' follow up to ""Citizen Kane"", is well known to film buffs. The original rough edit of the movie was two and a half-hours and had a depressing, downbeat mood. When shown to preview audiences, it was poorly received. So, though Welles planned to tidy up the movie, RKO took the film from Welles when he went to South America and they reedited it (Apparently under the supervision of film editor Robert Wise). The movie was reduced to a little under ninety minutes, with original Welles footage and new studio footage, along with scenes that were edited with both. And there was about an hour's worth of scenes that was cut out all together, including the original ending, and scrapped by the studio. ""Ambersons"" was released to the general public, where it stank up the box office.
This is unfortunate. While ""Citizen Kane"" is an excellent movie, being stylish, well acted, directed and written as well as tremendously entertaining, ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" had the potential to be even better. As it stands, in my view, it is only a very good movie on the edge of being a great movie. Still, it got four Oscar nominations (Including Best Picture) and is often considered by critics as one of the greatest of all movies.
The movie certainly has some great acting, provided by Joseph Cotten (Eugene), Tim Holt (George), Dolores Costello (Isabel), Anne Baxter (Lucy), Ray Collins (Jack), Erskine Sanford (Roger Benson), Richard Bennett (Major Amberson) and Agnes Moorehead (Aunt Fanny). Four of these actors (Cotten, Collins, Sanford and Moorehead) were veterans of ""Citizen Kane"". The cinematography and film editing are also similar to ""Kane"" and, once again, they work very well. Same with the music score by an uncredited Bernard Herrmann (The original, unedited score is sometimes considered the best in cinema). The set design is spectacular, with many of the interior sets having a large, vast scope about them (Though a lot of what we see may be matte drawings like in ""Citizen Kane""). Orson Welles' narration is booming but not shouting and sets the perfect mood for the story. He had a terrific, moody voice that was certainly due to his years on the radio.
Based upon Booth Tarkington's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, the story follows the rise and fall of one family (The Ambersons) during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. The Ambersons stubbornly stick to their old ways, although things are changing. They find automobiles, an idea believed by Eugene Morgan (Cotten), to be an impractical and absurd idea. Eugene once romanced Isabel Amberson (Costello), but thye had some troubles and parted ways. Later, Isabel gave birth to a son, George (Holt), who is now the spoiled heir of the Amberson family. George romances Eugene's daughter Lucy (Baxter), while Eugene starts to mend things with the now widowed Isabel. But, George will not allow Eugene to marry his mother (The reasons for what he dislikes about Eugene are never really explained). But it's possible that George's dislike of Eugene caused his mother to become ill. Also, cutting Eugene out also ends things between him and Lucy, who remains loyal to her father. But, the Morgans become wealthy as a result of the automobile, while a series of tragedies in the Amberson clan cause them to loose their power and social status. And, for the first time in his life, George has to find work. But one day, he is nearly killed by an automobile (Symbolic of the destruction of the Ambersons by the Morgans?) and is hospitalized.
""Ambersons"" just lacks something that would make me put it over ""Kane"". It may be the editing by the studio that leaves gaps in the story at times. For example, what became of Major Amberson? (According to Tim Dirk's of ""The Greatest Films"", he died. But his last scene in the movie seemed to me to suggest senility.) What caused Isabel to become ill? (Some of the deleted footage, again according to Tim Dirks, elaborated on this. And the answer, as I said above, may be depression.) And, most importantly, what caused the Ambersons to loose their fortune? One minute they were the wealthiest people in town. The next, they're dirt poor and struggling to earn a living. There were deleted scenes that gave answers to these questions. But they were probably seen by RKO as useless fat. I have a copy of Tarkington's novel. And I hope that, when I read it, I'll get the answers.
But the biggest disrespect to Welles, in the opinion of many, was the tacking on of a different ending. The one that exists now has a shot of Eugene and Fanny walking down the hall of the hospital as Eugene explains about the reconciliation between him and George. The original film ended in this way (Told again by Tim Dirks):
In the original film's ending (footage that was destroyed), Eugene visited an aging, bitter Fanny in her sparse boarding room house/old folks' home and told her about his hospital visit to George and their reconciliation, as she rocked back and forth in a creaking chair and listened to a phonograph record playing in the background.
I'm sorry if I have given the impression that I don't like this movie. It is well made and well acted. It might even be able to give ""Kane"" or ""Touch of Evil"" (Restored version) a run for their money. But, if RKO had allowed Welles to do the editing himself, it could have been even more realized and completed. Not only that, but Welles' career afterwards could have been more prestigious and productive. It was four years before he directed another movie. And, though he made a couple of great or very good films afterwards, he was never able to make another movie without being molested by the studio.

Tim Holt plays Georgie Minafer, the last bastion of this aristocracy, and Eugene Morgan (Cotten) is the representitive of the industrial pioneers. Georgie is egoism incarnate; he belongs to the scorpions of Welle's world: like Kane, or like Quinlan in TOUCH OF EVIL (1958) he frustrates and blights the lives of those around him almost in spite of himself. Rarely had Welles been so gentle and affectionate in his approach, than here. According to Orson Welles, about 45 minutes was cut from the released version of this famed movie (""the whole heart of the film, really"") he once said, and futhermore, the closing sequence in the hospital wasn't written nor directed by him. No matter. It's still a fascinating venture into the cinema, with a fine Proustian flavour fully intact. The Dresden doll beauty of the rarely seen Dolores Costello is memorable as is Agnes Moorehead's superlative portrayal of the frustrated Aunt Fanny: hers is a classic performance which realistically conveys a spinster revelling in the Indian summer of her respected family. Welles the creative technician is in evidence as well. By merging several soundtracks, he achieves the babble of voices that lends such conviction to the leavetaking at the Amberson Ball and to the excursion in the snow. The genius of Welles is also notable during the conversation between Lucy and Eugene in the garden scene; only later does one realise the ingenious parallel between the Indian tale and the Amberson saga itself, because it is done with such subtlety.",1025481600,,1660,5.129151291512915
335753,4,6301564456,"I don't disagree with the high praise lavished on this movie.  It's just that social commentary isn't my favourite viewing field.  If it were, maybe I'd rate it 5 stars.",1016668800,,169,4.6
335754,5,6301564456,"There is, as of February 2010, no DVD available for this great film [update -- a DVD was issued in 2012, but without extras that would enhance one's appreciation] -- it deserves a deluxe Criterion DVD edition.  So my review is based on the RKO VHS tape that was available in the early days of VHS releases.  The RKO tape was an unusually sharp copy of the movie compared to many other VHS tapes of the time -- the container claims that the tape was made from a copy of the film in the studio vault.  It's too bad that the studio did not preserve the other 50 or so minutes of film that Orson Welles intended to be part of his movie -- apparently, all that's left of these deleted scenes are stills and Welles's screenplay.
  There are at least two books by academics dealing with films based on novels -- comparing the relative artistic status of the novel & film adaptation.  These books rate Orson Welles's film higher than Booth Tarkington's novel.  I wonder if these academics actually took time to read the novel, or whether they just accepted the artistic status of the novel as ""received opinion"" from ""on high,"" accepting the pigeonhole assigned to the novel by the literary critical establishment (which amounts to accepting fashionability and departmental gossip as objective fact, or at least as a convenient ""letter grade"" for the novel).  I was dazzled by the film, so I read the novel -- twice.  I thought it would be written in an old-fashioned wordy style.  I had the impression that it was no longer fashionable to read Booth Tarkington.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the novel is a great read by today's or any day's standards.  The novel is, in its own terms, the artistic equal of Welles's film of it.  I highly recommend reading the novel as a way to increase your enjoyment of the film.  It affords a lesson in how to film a complex novel -- how to eliminate characters & subplots, how to emphasize the main strengths of the novel.  Most of the dialogue is word-for-word from the novel.
  And here's a bit of trivia.  Snobbery is a theme of both the novel & film.  So it is appropriate that the name of Georgie's horse is ""Pendennis"" -- this is the name of the title character in William Makepeace Thackeray's novel satirizing snobbery -- usually the novel is simply known as ""Pendennis,"" but the full title is ""The History of Pendennis : His Fortunes and Misfortunes, His Friends and His Greatest Enemy.""  This is the horse involved in the great scene where all the main characters are out for a ride in the snow.  The horse is mentioned by name several times in both the novel & film.
  Another major theme of the novel is air pollution (and the general decline in quality & pace of life).  Welles wanted to include this in his film, but most of this material was cut from the final released print.  Tarkington wrote 3 novels about the way factory smoke & automobile exhaust started to pollute the air in the early 1900s -- the 3 novels (including ""The Magnificent Ambersons"") were published in one volume under the collective title ""Growth.""  Tarkington was ahead of his time in being concerned about sooty air.",1014940800,4,3147,4.575

7812825,3,6301564456,"Orson Welles loved to play ""the victim"" when it came to ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" which was supposed to be his follow-up ""masterpiece"" to ""Citizen Kane."" Welles spent his life telling anyone who would listen that ""Ambersons"" was ripped away from him and unceremoniously butchered by RKO, thus stripping away it's artistic value in favor of commercial viability, but cutting out key scenes and then tacking on a contrived ""happy ending."" And that the original print of the movie--as he had left it--was irrevocably lost. That's what Welles wanted sympathetic ears to hear, when that's not quite true.

First, RKO gave Welles his own personal 35mm print of ""Ambersons"" as Welles had directed, pre-cut cuts/editing done by RKO. What Welles did with his print is anyone's guess. Knowing how often scattered and ADD Welles could be, it's no telling what happened to the print.
Second, it was probably an impossibility to do a film that would equal or eclipse the artistic tour-de-force  ""Citizen Kane,"" immediately thereafter. As such, expectations for ""Ambersons"" were unrealistically high, owing much to Welles' self-promotion. In short, anything after ""Citizen Kane"" couldn't help but be a disappointment, no matter how good it may have been.
Third, Welles didn't stick around to put the finishing touches on ""Ambersons"" because he was in such a darn hurry to rush off to Rio De Janeiro to start filming a documentary.
Fourth, the reviews after the initial screening of ""Ambersons"" was so bad that RKO was in a panic to try to save it.  With Welles out of the country and basically inaccessible and the very real likelihood of a flop on its hands, RKO had no choice but to re-edit the movie and resort to tacking on a happy ending.
Fifth, objectively, ""Ambersons"" just wasn't that good from the get go. It was stagey in appearance, extremely talkative, lots of philosophizing, and downbeat. Also, critics derided Anges Morehead's performance as being over-the-top.
Lastly, all the above was cited as evidence that Welles refused to take responsibility for ""Ambersons"" not being the masterpiece he said it would be by blaming RKO.",1457654400,,2130,5.08

7812827,5,6301564456,"""The Magnificent Ambersons"" is a great movie. I've seen it a half a dozen times at least; and the older I get, the better I like it. Probably it's because when I was young, I focused on the young lovers, and they are the smaller part of this film. While they are sweet (although George Minafer is a brat who needs a comeuppance), it's the older lovers, portrayed by Joseph Cotten and Dolores Costello, who are the heart of the story; it's their unconsummated love that gives the film its power. And now, much older, I get it. Even with cuts to Orson Welles's scenes (and, heaven help us, their destruction!), it's really one of the best movies ever made. It's one of those must-sees.
