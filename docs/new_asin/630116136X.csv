7810278,5,630116136X,"I purchased this Orlando concert video circa 1990. My husband was reluctant to view it as he wasn't a big fan of country music, but when it ended he said, ""I wouldn't mind seeing that again."" It became one of our favorites. Its George in the 80s, when he was struggling personally but peaking professionally. Pretty old-school, the Jones boys all wear identical outfits, etc. but George is freaking unbelievable! I hope they re-issue this one.",1369440000,,443,4.842105263157895
