5679880,5,B00BWWZT1U,"So far, this is the absolute number one top-of-the-list with a bullet most inane cartoon movie I've ever found.

You see, I can't handle watching most live-action movies, with the exception of horror films, because I lack the attention span, and being bored in that way makes me manic. I watch cartoons, usually the most inane I can find, and horror films, usually the worst I can find, in bed while I am waiting for my medication to kick in so that I can sleep, because I find either equally soothing, not emotionally, but sort of intellectually numbing. Keeps me calm. Not much in this world keeps me calm, and every thing I find that does has a great deal of value to me.

It's about these, no s*#!, ""Princess-ballerinas"" that live in like, strawberry milk ocean teapot island mushroom tree cuckoo clock world, and one of them is planning a tea party, and she drops her sugar cubes in the strawberry milk, so she has to go on her steam boat through the strawberry milk ocean to the other teapot islands and ask all the other ""princess-ballerinas"" if she can borrow any, which they don't have any. The fairies do, but she doesn't even &%$#ing ask them. It's cool though, she eventually gets some from ""The Horses"". Then, they have the tea party, and when the other ""princess-ballerinas"" get on their donut/upsidedownumbrella/teacup rafts to go back to their own islands, the rafts won't move, because there's no current in the strawberry milk ocean, and they notice that the milk level is dropping, and the lanterns are flickering, and their cuckoo clocks are getting less cuckoo-ey, and the milk is just less milky in general, and they discover that this is because there's no strawberry milk coming out of the straw on the giant milk carton in the middle of the world. So, they decide they have to take the steam boat, or river boat, or whatever, back to their respective islands, pack some things, and head to the milk carton to investigate. While doing this, they meet these mermaids, and the mermaids also noticed that the milk was less milky, so they agree to meet at the milk carton to help. Then, the riverboat or whatever breaks down for some reason. Then more stuff happens and the mermaids pull these chains that are anchoring the giant teapot islands to the bed of the strawberry milk ocean together so that the islands are all together instead of far apart, for some reason, and then, for some reason, the mermaids pull the riverboat to the milk carton, ""princess-ballerinas"", fairies, and mermaids, and they all look at a different part of it, and the fairies find a...berry...jammed...in the straw. It's a strawberry jam. That whole pile of text up there was the set up for...that...joke.

TLDR; everything is pink, even the sky.",1391212800,5,2746,4.716666666666667
5679881,3,B00BWWZT1U,"The inane story line and annoying voices didn't deter all the five-and-unders in our family from watching this DVD over and over in the days following Christmas.

5679884,1,B00BWWZT1U,Rented it for my niece and little sister bug 15 mind into they both had tuned out... and they love lalaloopsy; maybe they should stick to making dolls only! There's little excitement in the characters voice to were it seems kinda funny...,1385856000,,238,4.690476190476191

8574920,2,B00BWWZT1U,"This has got to be one of the girliest movies I've ever seen in my life. My daughter enjoys Lalaloopsy but she could not get into this movie. It was too over-the-top for us. It didn't include any of her favorite characters and the story was too ridiculous. There are mermaids, fairies, ponies, princess ballerinas, and they all live in a pink world. The gait of the ballerinas is strange and freaked my daughter right out. She loves ballerinas so I thought she would like this. I guess not! She likes girly girl type things but not THIS much.

The only positive thing I can say is that I love how polite everyone is. All the characters have pleasant manners and are helpful to each other, which I liked very much.",1424217600,,713,4.442748091603053
