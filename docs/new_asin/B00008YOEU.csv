1870739,5,B00008YOEU,i love this dance dvd....i do it everyday and my turn out had already inproved... it is a great warm up and for your technique to get stronger.,1295222400,3,143,4.142857142857143
1870740,4,B00008YOEU,"This dvd was more or less what I expected. Sure, it was filmed in the 80s so the music and costumes are somewhat.... vintage. But the dancing instructions are good and the dvd is a good solution when there is no time to actually attend a dance class, or when travelling. It kept me in shape during my summer vacation, so I could spend 3 weeks  away from a dance studio without my turnout suffering too much. You of course will have to solve the problem of not having a barre in the middle of your living room... I lined up a couple of high-back stools and it worked out well. The barre excersises are good, the frappes are particularly challeging. The center work is on the fast side without too much instruction, to follow it definitely requires previous dance experience. The grand allegro at the very end is only meant for the dancers on the dvd to show off, just a montage with no choreography and no instruction... But then again, how would you do a grand jette in your living room without suffering fatal injuries? Overall a good purchase, David Howard's dancing has  a lyrical style which I really like -in contrast with most other ballet dvds which feel more like a gymnastics workout than a dance.",1283731200,38,1206,4.502283105022831
1870741,3,B00008YOEU,"I will admit, I only bought this to see Peter Fonseca. But, I will say this about it. I like the way David Howard leads the class. If I were a dancer, I think I would really enjoy being in his class.",1266451200,5,199,3.761904761904762
1870742,4,B00008YOEU,"This DVD is definitively for intermediate/advanced.  But if you have taken a class (or 20) and go through it a few times, you will get it!",1243382400,6,138,4.3076923076923075
1870743,4,B00008YOEU,"In general the DVD is good, but it's a really old class....the first part is really good..barre exercises, but when it comes to the center parctice, it's missing a lot....not good explanation of the exercises (2nd part)",1229904000,10,219,4.945945945945946
1870744,5,B00008YOEU,"I would definately recommend this video to any of my friends in the dance hall.  It is fast-paced, fun and a very good work out.  This video is DEFINATELY NOT for a beginner.  Be prepared to sweat when buying this video.",1057363200,14,220,4.317073170731708
1870745,4,B00008YOEU,"I was surprised when I got this video at how much it was like my ballet class.  I had the New York City Ballet Workout and thought this would be a good supplement.
This video teaches your muscles to work the way a dancer's muscles should, so when you go to class, you will be able to receive the full effect of teaching instruction.  I live 45 minutes away from the ballet studio, so I like this video because I can practice as often as I should to keep my body ready to dance.
There are two minor things that I need to get used to with this video:
a) the sound is not very good, so I have to turn it up loud to hear the music to keep in time, and
b) plies, tendus, and degages move quickly;  I usually like a slower plie, a slow tendu, then a fast tendu and fast degage.  I suppose the video is not as long as to incorporate all elements of the 90 minute ballet class I am used to.",1022889600,62,882,3.910614525139665
1870746,5,B00008YOEU,"This video takes you through an intermediate ballet class. David demonstrates the combinations, and seven professional dancers perform them. I am currently an advanced ballet student who lives far away from a  professional studio. I do this ballet class video on days when I can't make  it to the studio. David Howard has many other great ballet class videos  available to aspiring dancers and dance teachers who want to learn ballet  technique.",956361600,36,445,5.138888888888889
1870787,5,B00008YOEU,It's a great ballet class video. Very usable.,1446422400,,45,4.75
1870788,5,B00008YOEU,I practice this video often.,1442534400,,28,4.8
1870789,4,B00008YOEU,"I recognize the barre work and center combinations. It's old and dated, but that's irrelevant because it's very good. My ex ballet master was David Howard's contemporary. They danced and taught at NYC and ABT. So I feel like I'm 16 again when I work out to this DVD. It will work for you if you want to maintain or improve your technique and build your strength, even if you aren't interested in joining the corps!",1437264000,4,414,4.4605263157894735
1870790,4,B00008YOEU,Nice video for an intermediate/advanced class as described.,1433116800,,59,6.5
1870791,5,B00008YOEU,It's a must have. Even if just to see D.H. In his pink spandex bell bottoms.,1429056000,,76,3.8125
1870792,5,B00008YOEU,"I love this video! I am 40, and I haven't taken a ballet class since college. But, at one time I was pretty advanced and have been looking for a suitable class at local schools. I was taught by a very technical, classicly trained ballerina and admit to being a bit of a ballet snob, particularly when I look at websites for schools and it appears more emphasis is placed upon costumes than technique. Also, adult ballet classes can be pretty pricey, so I opted to try this DVD first. It is exactly what I was looking for! It provided a great workout and a flood of memories from my early ballet days. I was able to keep up through about 3/4 of the barre routine, and then it got more challenging. But, that's exactly what I wanted - nothing too easy that would not provide a challenge, nor nothing too hard for my 40 year old body that hasn't taken a class in 20 years.",1425254400,7,869,4.240963855421687
1870793,3,B00008YOEU,"The class is truly beyond beginner level.  You must know all the basics and can do them correctly before trying this DVD.

However, I have to say that the camera work is atrocious.  The operator obviously did not know how to film dancers.  This is an instruction DVD therefore the focus should be whole body and no jerky movements from dancer to dancer.

Half of the time the focus is on dancers' face, not the body.  I have a hard time piecing the sequence because I can't see what the dancers are doing.

It can be so much better but I am somewhat disappointed because of the camera work.",1421884800,7,590,4.3577981651376145
1870794,5,B00008YOEU,"I danced for 13 years or so until I no longer had time to attend classes because of college and work.  The exercises in this DVD are very similar to what I would be doing if I were still going to class.  It's really nice to be able to do this at home, though some exercises are made more difficult because a barre is somewhat necessary (that's not the DVD's fault, though).  Love the teacher's style, too - he's very clear in his directions.",1420416000,2,441,4.226190476190476
1870795,5,B00008YOEU,Second purchase.  This time for a friend.,1420329600,,41,4.857142857142857
1870796,5,B00008YOEU,Best ballet class ever,1419292800,,22,4.75
1870822,4,B00008YOEU,Great ballet class but very dated. I would love an updated one!,1413590400,,63,4.333333333333333
1870823,1,B00008YOEU,"The video is very good however; this was shipped to me as new and was damaged upon arrival. The video even stated ""skipping over damaged section"" for something to that extent. the damaged section was approximately about 5 min into the video and lasted approximately 15 min.so much for the warm up! Seller had to have known this was damaged goods!",1411603200,,346,4.688524590163935
1870824,3,B00008YOEU,"If it didn't look so dated, I would have enjoyed it more.  Definitely meant for those who've had ballet training at some point in their lives.  It's a ""so so"" alternative to being in a live ballet class.",1400976000,,203,4.315789473684211
1870825,3,B00008YOEU,"I was hoping for an ""at home"" class I could do to get a good ballet workout and pickup some technique tips. I am not a beginning dancer, so I am familiar with the terminology used. However, the execution was very difficult to follow because:

1. The teacher does not fully demonstrate the moves, nor does he do them with the rhythm that will be done by the class.
2. Speaking of rhythm, every single dancer here does their own take on interpreting the time, and the counting done by the teacher bears little relation to the music that is playing. So confusing.
3. The dancers do things during the exercises that were not specified during the ""demonstration"" phase. Huh?
4. Oh, the camera work. Really? Focusing on the head when we should be seeing a body shot in order to follow the moves. Walking with the camera, making me dizzy with the shaky picture. Randomly moving from one dancer to another instead of focusing on one to follow a move through its progression. As I said, each dancer has his/her own way of doing the moves, so it's hard to keep any sort of continuity.

As ballet DVDs go, it's not the worst. If you're willing to put up with the confusion and stay strong and not give up because you don't know what the heck is going on, then this might be for you. Yes, as others have said, it is dated, but I don't find that particularly a negative, as it is ballet, after all. How modern are you going to get with it? The production value, other than the really poor camera work, is acceptable, even by today's standards.",1400025600,16,1530,4.402826855123675
1870826,2,B00008YOEU,Video was very outdated.  Didn't  like the class content or the way it was presented.  Wish I could have seen a clip before I purchased it.,1394668800,,139,4.269230769230769
1870827,5,B00008YOEU,"This was exactly what I was looking for.  It's a nice traditional ballet class -- even if the production value of the video is a bit dated.  They repeat both sides, and you have multiple views of students at the barre to follow, if need be.  You will need some room for the floor routines.  I only wish the floor routines showed the dancers from the back, as well as from the front and side.  In a regular class I'm used to learning a routine by following behind the instructor.  The instructor, David Howard, is a dance legend who performed with Gelsey Kirkland.  I'm only sorry I never got to take a live class with him -- he died in 2013.  If you're an intermediate ballet dancer you'll love this.",1385251200,5,700,4.3307692307692305
1870828,3,B00008YOEU,"This DVD is good for someone who has taken some ballet lessons enough to know basic barre work.  Some of the exercises seem a bit unusual, maybe to engage people who are truly ""advanced."" The video itself is rather dated but well directed.",1384300800,2,239,4.558139534883721
1870829,4,B00008YOEU,"I had not taken ballet for years and wanted a DVD that would duplicate an authentic ballet class. This is it. The only problem is I am more out of shape than I realized and found it difficult to keep up with the class as it progressed. Some of the bar work was way too fast and advanced for me. I should have realized that after not taking a ballet class for 20 years, I cannot pick up where I left off. So I just do the beginning 20 minutes of the DVD. Now I need to find a beginner version DVD that is not too basic.",1377129600,3,518,3.850467289719626
1870830,5,B00008YOEU,"IF you are someone who is really in to the art of ballet, especially classisically ballet this DVD woun't let you down. Whether you are intermediate and or advanced be prepared to move up even more faster past intermediate, advanced level. It is not for the light hearted but the truly dedicated dance artist. Just pace yourself.",1375747200,,329,4.7894736842105265
1870831,3,B00008YOEU,"I know this is an intermediate & advanced DVD, however, it would be nice to have the teacher demonstrate the moves a little slower. I am not a beginner, but it's been a while since I've taken a class. I am not a professional dancer, so the moves he demonstrates are not ones I've done/seen before. Ballet barre DVDs are hard to find. I suppose after I take this class (in my home) around 20 times I will know the routine. But it's not easy to follow the first few times, and that makes it discouraging and lends itself to giving up. Disappointing.",1371945600,4,547,4.320388349514563
1870859,5,B00008YOEU,"This video met all my expectation. I took ballet for 15 years and the video makes you feel as if you are in a real ballet class. You begin with bar routines, then move on to floor choreographed routines. It is very challenging and the perfect length for a hard workout. This video is exactly what I have been looking for!",1361664000,5,321,4.278688524590164
1870860,5,B00008YOEU,Very nice workout for beginners as well as experienced/professional dancers. especially good for those who are retired or in between seasons.,1357862400,3,141,5.761904761904762
1870861,5,B00008YOEU,ive taken ballet through school. being finished i was looking for a replacement. most ballet dvds are random exercises. this dvd is structured like an actual ballet class. i love it!! so worth it.,1357689600,3,196,4.794117647058823
1870862,5,B00008YOEU,I recommend this for all intermediate/ Avanced Ballet dancers.  This is a good DVD to use in between classes or just because.,1351814400,,125,4.681818181818182
1870863,5,B00008YOEU,"I've been searching around forever for a ballet class dvd that fits my technique level. This is perfect. Mr. Howard does not spend a lot of time explaining the combinations, so you should have sufficient training to understand the terms used (""en de hors"" ""en criox"" ""en de dedans"", etc). The barre includes everything you would expect to see in an int/adv class, like plies, tendues, degage, frappe, fondue, rond de jamb en lair, stretching, and grand battement. The center section includes adagio, releves/developes, pirouettes en dehors/en dedans, 2 allegros, a variation, and grand battement. The exercises are split into sections so you can easily skip between them.

Sure, it's totally 80's, there's some cheesy slow motion at the end, and yes, Mr. Howard's pants are VERY tight. But if you are looking for a dvd to supplement your current training, this is it. The dancers are beautiful and Howard is a great teacher. His commentary helps to keep viewers thinking about their technique throughout the class (""roll up the back"" ""liven up the feet"" ""relax through the neck"" etc).

My only frustration is that most of the center work is filmed face-front, instead of from behind, as all ballet classes are taught. When will they understand that we learn from behind the teacher! W/e, it's still awesome.

Tip: You will, more than likely, need some sort of barre to follow along with this dvd. A railing works okay, or just make one out of PVC pipe.

PS: The dvd goes through both left and right sides (barre and center), so you will never end up feeling uneven.",1334793600,37,1565,4.8283582089552235
1870864,4,B00008YOEU,"I enjoyed this dvd.  It is exactly what I was looking for.  Watching the students front and back gave me the perspective that I needed to follow the class. The instructor was a little brief in his class drills and he went through them so fast that I missed what he was saying.  However, as I had stated, watching the class members helped me in going through the drills.  The only problem I have with the dvd is the instructor's sweat marks under his arm pits (a bit distracting).  Not really a minus but, it was hard not to notice.",1334620800,3,531,4.27
1870865,5,B00008YOEU,"I remember Ballet class from so long ago and remember how good a work out it was.  Bought this DVD and MAN! I didn't realize how out of shape I had gotten.  While I have only gotten thru the first couple of segments on barre work I can already tell I'm going to be feeling those 20 minutes.
Great workout!  The teacher is every bit as good as my former ballet teacher.  May have to get the beginning ballet dvd as well.",1327104000,3,419,4.073170731707317
1870866,4,B00008YOEU,I like this video because the dancers execute the steps and movements very profesionally and through repetition one can aspire to imitate them.,1312588800,,143,5.260869565217392
1870867,5,B00008YOEU,"No, it doesn't have the best production value... but it was filmed in the 80s. What do you expect? As a former ballet student who is now a mom, I longed to take real ballet classes again (NOT ballet boot camp, NOT pilates which is more like ballet on your back.) This video is just like a real ballet class ... only all the students have extraordinary form. The bar and center work are classic - just like a real class. I would not recommend this video if you haven't had previous ballet training. It's far too easy to get injured if you haven't learned proper form already. But if you want to use your postural muscles, improve your strength and flexibility and feel like you're dancing, not just exercising, then this is a great choice.",1309564800,21,738,4.4338235294117645
1870868,5,B00008YOEU,I really enjoy this class.  Apart from just liking David Howard's voice and instruction I love the combinations in this video.  It is a fun and interesting class for home all demostrated and performed on both sides.,1300752000,4,215,4.783783783783784

7988086,5,B00008YOEU,Although this DVD is quite dated the ballet barre is not. It is Royal style and the perfect barre to do at home. It is advanced so you need to know what you are doing. good workout for dancers.,1502841600,2,193,3.9743589743589745

7988089,5,B00008YOEU,This man was such a gifted artist I am glad to have his class on DVD. Film and pictures are a moment in time this one definitely is. His death was trendeless loss on the dance community. Great class,1488067200,,198,4.102564102564102
