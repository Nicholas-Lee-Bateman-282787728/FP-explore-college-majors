5788967,4,B00DCCZO2W,"This is a hour and a half conversation with the Isaacs with Bill Gaither asking the questions and providing the glue.  Most of the videos are from previous Gaither DVDs but there are a few ""live"" songs thrown in.  I have most of the Gaither/Isaacs videos and have seen them in concert several times, so there was not much new material for me.  Still, I love there music and this DVD provides a nice video bio on the group.  I only gave four stars because so much older material was repeated.",1377302400,4,491,4.362637362637362
5788968,5,B00DCCZO2W,"Great music from my all-time favorite gospel music family. Perfect harmony. In this DVD they reflect back to some of their upbringing. Interviewed by Bill Gaither in an informal setting... they also do a couple of songs of nostalgia ""Mr. In-Between"" is one... They do a remake of the 1989 Mike & the Mechanic's hit ""The Living Years"" as well as the Judd.s 1986 #1 hit, ""Grandpa (Tell Me about the Good Ol' Days).",1435190400,,412,4.581081081081081

Bill Gaither, thank you for finding them!  I love the interviews and all the music, and the hardships with a silver lining in the clouds---Jesus!

5788978,5,B00DCCZO2W,"This is another great dvd with this amazing family group,  Another favorite. Can always find what we are looking at Amazon!!",1402272000,,124,4.904761904761905
5788979,5,B00DCCZO2W,The only regret I have is that there aren't more dvd'd of the Issacs. There is so much trash on tv that I play the Issacs every day. Very inspiring.,1389398400,,148,3.966666666666667
5788980,5,B00DCCZO2W,I have enjoyed their music for years.  Each family member is great performer.  Their humor is real as is their love for Jesus Christ.,1389312000,,133,4.5
5788981,5,B00DCCZO2W,We love the Isaacs and this music video is not disappointing in the least. It is great to watch a series of wonderful Christian performers like the Isaacs without any interrupting commercials. Love this item and would highly recommend it.,1388016000,,238,4.975
5788982,5,B00DCCZO2W,"I RECOMMEND THIS DVD (THO IT CAN BE HAD CHEAPER AT MOST DISCOUNT DEPT STORES) BECAUSE OF THE WONDERFUL MUSIC & VERY INFORMATIVE PERSONAL HISTORY OF THE FAMILY.  THE MUSIC IS TOP NOTCH (EVEN IF MANY SONGS ARE FROM PREVIOUS ALBUMS), ALTHO I WASN'T TOO CRAZY ABOUT BILL GAITHER'S HAVING THEM SING THE REFRAINS OVER & OVER (COULD'VE FIT ANOTHER SONG IN FOR ALL THE REFRAINS SUNG OVER), THEY CHEERFULLY OBLIGED.
  BILL IS RIGHT, THO--THEY ARE A FUN BUNCH TO WATCH, ALL THE FUNNY BANTER BACK & FORTH--SONYA EVEN TELLS A ""BLONDE"" JOKE--AND IT'S CLEAR THEY DON'T ALWAYS TAKE THEMSELVES TOO SERIOUS.  THE MUSIC BUSINESS IS SERIOUS, THO, AND THEY ARE A VERY PROFESSIONAL, MULTI-AWARD WINNING (NUMEROUS IBMA & DOVE AWARDS) & TALENTED FAMILY BAND.
  THE SERIOUS SIDE IS WHEN THEY DESCRIBE THEIR TRIP TO THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM IN GERMANY WHERE THEIR GRANDMOTHER & HER FAMILY WERE HELD PRISONER BY NAZIS DURING WW2.  THE VIDEOS (WE GET TO SEE THEIR GRANDMOTHER!) WERE ESPECIALLY MOVING, & I BAWLED WHEN I SAW THEM.  THEIR GRANDMOTHER HAD EMIGRATED WITH HER PARENTS & FAMILY FROM POLAND & IMPRISONED IN THE DEATH CAMPS FOR SEVERAL YEARS--TRAGICALLY ONLY THEIR GRANDMA (LILY'S MOTHER) & HER (GRANDMA'S) SISTER SURVIVED.
  MORE, THEIR TRIALS w/DEVASTATING & DEBILITATING HEALTH PROBLEMS AND THEIR FAITH TO OVERCOME w/VICTORY & LIFE THRU CHRIST JESUS IS DESCRIBED, AND NEW SONGS THAT PRAISE & WORSHIP THE LORD JESUS IN LIGHT OF THESE VICTORIES (WAITING IN THE WATER, WHICH THEY WROTE) ARE INCLUDED IN THIS INTIMATE VIDEO.
  ALSO, WE GET TO SEE THEM IN ISRAEL, AND SINGING IN HEBREW--WHAT A TREAT!  NOT ALL THE MUSIC IS BLUEGRASS, AND 2 SONGS ARE PERFORMED IN ISRAEL, ONE IN THE BEAUTIFUL GARDEN OF GETHSEMENE (THEY ALSO WROTE SHALOM MY HOME--SURE WISH THERE WAS MORE VIDEO COVERAGE HERE OF ISRAEL), AND BEN w/o HIS ""DISGUISE"" OF HAT/GLASSES (I MAY SEND HIM A NEW DISGUISE:  A GROUCHO MARX BUSHY-EYEBROW GLASSES/PLASTIC HONKER BEAGLEPUSS FROM ORIENTAL TRADING CO ;} WILL HE WEAR IT?).
  ANYWAYS, I WATCH IT OVER & OVER (EVEN THE RE-REFRAINS!) AND ENJOY IT ALL, EVEN BILL'S FUNNY JABS AT HIS VOCALIZING THE BASS ""BOOM-BOOM"" HARMONIES.  PS:  I ALSO BOUGHT THE TWIN CD --THE LIVING YEARS, WHICH DOES NOT HAVE ALL THE SONGS THE DVD HAS (""WALK ON"" IS MISSING ON CD, & I MISS IT!), BUT MOST OTHERS ARE THERE, & I ENJOY THAT DRIVING MY VAN AS WELL.  ALMOST FORGOT TO ADD:  THE AUDIO PREVIEW CLIPS OF MOST SONGS CAN BE HEARD ON THE PAGE FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED CD.  TKS FOR READING THIS LONG-WINDED REVIEW!",1383177600,3,2476,4.778823529411765

5788987,5,B00DCCZO2W,"What can you say except they are wonderful. Their singing is amazing and they have great music. Bill Gaither has the best singers that I have ever heard. I love all the old gospel songs and most of the new. I love the style of this music,a little country and a little bluegrass. What a great family. I also have a CD of Sonya Isaacs and she has a beautiful voice. She writes and brings a lot to the table for the family. Thank you to Bill Gaither and keep up the great job that you do.",1380844800,6,485,4.010309278350515
