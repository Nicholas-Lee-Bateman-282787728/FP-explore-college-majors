I think this made ms rokk a star. Oscar sima runs a night club where his niece ,ms rokk, works as a dancer and singer. She has a boy friend name i think sindulfo son of the head of the police chief played by walter slezak, He dissaproves of her and wants him to marry the daughter of a higher up. Oscar sima illegally imports a certain kind of coffee in which marika helps by exploiting the old gasparone legend. Secret police agent johanne heesters goes to the village to catch this illegal importer of mountain grown coffee! or is it expresso? It all falls when the police chief realizes that the grand dames brother has a dozen wives. What a joke of a plot but it works . The musical numbers are almost in the style of busby berckley, Marika husband and director george jacoby must have been fan of the choreographer  american musical befor it was cut off.
