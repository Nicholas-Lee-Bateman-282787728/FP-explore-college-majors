8377634,5,B002QBXL8O,This is a terrific movie with a couple of the great classic Christmas titles.  I was happy to receive it last week.  The image quality isn't great but it's just what I needed to feel a little X-mas nostalgia.,1384992000,,208,4.3076923076923075
8377635,1,B002QBXL8O,"The video was a nice collection of wonderful features from the past.  However, my decision to purchase this item was because Rudolph the Red Nose reindeer was supposed to be included along with others from the same series.  They are not on the CD and I had to go back and purchase another CD.",1357776000,,292,4.388888888888889
8377636,1,B002QBXL8O,"I am not sure where all these other reviews came from.  The movie I got was not what is stated.  I got a disk with a Michael Landon movie, and a couple other movies, my family was interested in none of them.  If you want the good Christmas specials advertised, get the boxed set.",1355270400,,279,4.12962962962963
