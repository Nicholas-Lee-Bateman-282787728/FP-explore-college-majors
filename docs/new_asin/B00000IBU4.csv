7910585,1,B00000IBU4,"""Times of Terror"" here presents ""Terror on the 'Titanic,'"" a wholly unremarkable DVD that is full of speculation (especially with regard to Captain Smith's decision making) which could be misleading to people new to the subject. The DVD is inadequately researched and presents numerous ""Mysteries"" that aren't mysteries at all. As a documentary it is quite stilted, particularly in the case of J. Bruce Ismay and Captain Stanley Lord of the ""Californian."" I'm neither defending nor promoting the actions of either man here, but this production paints them into villainous roles, when the truth is much more complex and nuanced. Charles Lightoller also gets unbalanced treatment at the hands of the filmmakers.

The box claims to be ""in color"" which is largely referring to the absolutely terrible and inaccurate CGI renderings of the ship. Obviously none of the vintage footage is color, but they did colorize still photos in at least one scene I can recall. All is not what it seems here: some of the footage presented seems to have been of the ""Olympic,"" but much of it is just vintage footage that has no particular relevance to the accident or ""Titanic"" specifically. The most interesting footage is of Captain Smith. To my knowledge there is only one very brief motion picture film taken of ""Titanic"" which predated the voyage substantially, and it is not shown here.

Inaccuracies abound here. As an example, the narration refers to ""Titanic"" having four inflatable rafts, where it actually had four collapsible boats. The bulkhead system is explained largely adequately, though there is a design theory about the segregation of third class passengers that I would like to see evidence of; the filmmakers seemed to believe that the bulkhead system was designed to spite these passengers, when largely the issue was that third class passengers got the worst spaces in the ship because they paid so much less than first of second class passengers. (That's certainly not to say there weren't class restrictions on the ship or that there weren't restraints on third class limiting their escape options, but the bulkhead design did not incorporate that discrimination as a planned design element.)

The box claims ""'Terror on the 'Titanic' reveals the shocking truth behind one of the worst disasters of the millennium!"" What is this dynamite revelation? Simply that ""Titanic"" had a fire in a coal bunker. That part is actually true; the ship had had a fire in the bunker during its crossing. The documentary claims that the reason Captain Smith had to race through the ice field was because the fire was essentially an inferno, and they needed to get to New York to put it out as it was out of control. Nothing could be further from the truth. Coal bunker fires were relatively common at the time, and were taken seriously. At the time of the sinking the fire was under control (as it had been throughout the voyage) and was essentially a smoldering annoyance. It certainly was not a decisive item in Captain Smith's decision making.

At the end the narration explains that the ship had been discovered at the bottom of the ocean, which is intermingled in with wholly irrelevant footage of divers on a smaller shipwreck in very shallow waters, the implication seeming to be that the ""Titanic"" was available for diving. I cannot imagine even the newest ""Titanic"" enthusiast believing that. The box claims that the film is 45 minutes long, but it's really just over 40 and the last five or so are simply padding. The flawed, incomplete, and brief presentation and analysis are at the heart of why I can't recommend the production. Everything about the DVD is poorly executed; it does have some interesting archival footage, but there are so many excellent documentaries on the subject that I would pick something (virtually anything) else in the genre instead of ""Terror on the 'Titanic.'""",1368748800,,3889,4.969278033794163
