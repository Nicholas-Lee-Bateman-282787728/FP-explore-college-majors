4009984,5,B002XUBE0A,"I love this movie.  It is entertaining but yet documentary/commentary.  Very well done.  The message, while delivered in the context of an African American experience, is universal to all interested in creating a better tomorrow.",1310169600,3,229,5.485714285714286
4009985,2,B002XUBE0A,"..I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  This is a horribly written story about a group of con artist / thieves called the 'Stick up Kids'.  The script throws every b movie cliche at you, and the bulk of the actors and actresses involved really seem like they are just phoning it in.  The lead male actor has horrible timing and can't deliver a line to save his life.  The lighting sound and editing where pretty good for a low budget movie...but it's just not enough.
I can understand what the other reviewers are saying when they mention that its a black cast..and that at least they get a chance to shine..but the message in this movie is the not a good one.  The theme of the story is that if you are a thief a lier and a con man who breaks the law on a daily basis, and is a general detriment to society..it's okay if as long as you give back to the community.  This is the same ridiculous message in allot of today's modern rap music.  There is a culture of respect for criminality in the African American community that should be eliminated, not celebrated.  This movie is not only not a good movie....it sends a horrible message.  If African American actors and actresses get a chance to create something they owe it to their community to be socially responsible with the message they are sending....or don't try to send a message at all..just make a good movie

..I threw this DVD out after one viewing....save your money",1284595200,2,1432,4.4106463878327
4009986,1,B002XUBE0A,"It was a shame,this could have had some potential,quite a bit of big names that semeed to fade,-not shine from Mel Jackson to Bryce Wilson-who are already great actors,but bad parts. Also, with all due respect,a veteran actor, Hawthorne James-Big Red from the Five Heartbeats,Color Purple, and so many notable movies and shows, who plays Uncle Bo in here. This man, woo-is cut from a different cloth,excellent actor. You give him a great part, he feels it and does it justice. They gave him a poor part in here though,too. The co-stars Tariq Alexander, Taurean Blacque,John Crann,and Lloyd DeLeon had an opportunity but, did not own up to the characters. They could have been as good. This movie was so terrible I want to throw it back as far as I can to where it came from. The acting was horrible and music as well, it was unsuspecting coming from a movie with a music producer like Bryce Wilson who could have helped them out with the soundtrack,very cheap! The story line could have came together better, very sketchy,all over the place. I can't say don't get it,cause the industry can be a tripp,all actors even the great ones have in-between or slow periods too, they gotta eat!",1278806400,6,1184,4.697115384615385

4009988,4,B002XUBE0A,Let's just say this film is full of surprises. I was impressed with the quality of the film and the overall cast as well. I would definitely recommend this movie!,1266796800,3,162,4.433333333333334
4009989,5,B002XUBE0A,"I recently had the opportunity to watch the film ""Two Stick Up Kids"" and I agree with the review above. As far as indie flicks go, I'll give it a 5. It is pretty impressive for an indie flick. The rivalry between the born and raised Harlemites and the Slumlord is interesting and one of my favorite themes throughout the movie. The music selections are dope too and put a great finishing touch on the film.",1266364800,3,406,4.355263157894737
4009990,4,B002XUBE0A,"This film impressed me! I thought this would be just another NYC crime flick but they tackle some real issues that New Yorkers are experiencing in several of the newly gentrified neighborhoods. This movie also taught me some stuff I didn't know about New York City's first settlers (hint: it was not the dutch). Bryce Wilson and Mel Jackson are great on the screen. I would give 5 stars except for a couple scenes that are a little too corny, other wise a great flick!",1265932800,7,468,4.517647058823529

4010047,2,B002XUBE0A,"A group of Harlem con artists rob rich people and live by the Three Musketeers' motto. After amassing millions and living in a low end rental, they decide they need to pull one more big job before retirement. One gang member gets shot and put in a wheel chair. While in prison he gives us the ""great white conspiracy"" speech to give a substandard movie some mock substance. Somehow I don't see the Feds controlling interest rates as targeting blacks, but maybe that is just me.

At this point the movie turns from a light con artist film to a heavy film about the Moors, the original owners/ settlers of NYC, and how the white man keeps the black man down. The movie gets bogged down with this theme and doesn't integrate it into the film as well as other films have done. Coupled with bad acting and poorly written dialogue, this production lost my interest after the wheel chair speech. For those who believe in the white vs. black conspiracy ideas, they might find an interest in this film in spite of its short comings.

4010048,5,B002XUBE0A,This was a great movie good story line I enjoyed. I think the critic is a little harsh I love how they help there neighbor need more of that to go on.,1327795200,,150,3.71875
4010049,4,B002XUBE0A,"This was a good movie, it had real substance and historical value. I did the research on Manhatten and found it to be on point. while their method may not have been the best approch (Robin Hoodist) the point of making conrtibutions to our community and to others were clear. We have to both invest in our own and become knowledgable about vision. Vision is not what you see but how you see it, it is not want you see but seeing what it can become.",1327363200,,447,4.209302325581396
4010050,1,B002XUBE0A,"This is probably THE WORST movie I have ever seen.  I can get with the concepts of making the most of one's life, black-owned business/neighborhoods, etc., but the presentation is WAY off.  The well-hidden positive messages in this movie will go over 99.9% of youths who will be the ones watcing this movie.  Furthermore, the acting was beyond terrible.  I'm sooooooo disappointed in this film and the fact that I wasted a couple hours watching it.",1326931200,,448,4.855263157894737
