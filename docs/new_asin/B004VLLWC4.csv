8443517,5,B004VLLWC4,As a dancer of 7 years and a teacher I am always looking for different ways to explain movements to students as well as a variety of techniques. This was very easy to understand and beautiful movements. Great for beginners and advanced dancers!,1397692800,,244,4.6976744186046515
8443518,4,B004VLLWC4,"Lovely dancer, Bozenka. She has incredible form and grace, a fantastic posture, and an even more fantastic figure making it all look great.

In this DVD, from the Bellydance Superstars label, Bozenka takes you through bellydance arm work basics. You can see from her every move that she has something other dancers don't. Perfect, perfect form. If you haven't done your arm basics, this is the right person to learn them from. If you've been dancing a long time but think arms are your weak point, go back and work on them with Bozenka. Even watching the video many many times will make a difference, as the image of her flowing so very elegantly through the arm work imprints itself into your brain. In fact, I really think watching will be just about as important as dancing along. A good idea would be to combine these arm basics with something that works on arm strengthening, even a regular upper body sculpting and strength training video. Or go do push-ups. On the other hand, if you he work enough with practicing the basic positions on this video, it will also make a difference. The whole lot done together would be quite a workout.

After a few minutes on an arm warm up and posture setting, Bozenka explains the basic arm positions, briefly, but neatly. From here on, there's chapter after little chapter of separate arm paths, each lasting barely a minute, but together making up a good collection. We have the usual snake arms, sunrise and sunset arms, sweeps, ""seagrass"" Persian and other moves, some of them not readily found on other DVDs. The sections are overly broken up, with a slight increase in difficulty or a variation of alternating arms getting a fresh chapter of its own. Going by the menu then, it looks like you have some fifty moves. There's a summary after every few sections and it's wholly unnecessary as Bozenka just demonstrates the moves to music without speaking. There's no additional takeaways and the individual chapters are in any case far too short to require a summary. It almost seems like the video was structured to inflate the menu. If the moves weren't done so well, I'd be rather ticked off.

The instructional style is all voice-over and we don't have Bozenka ""interacting"" or relating to the learner. I'm afraid she seemed as mesmerized by herself as I was by her. There are absolutely no practice sessions and no other moves on which the arm work is layered. So, you learn them in isolation and have to figure out the appropriate moves to use them with. Although transitions are mentioned, they aren't really explained or demonstrated. Take ""seagrass"" arms, for example. It's a move where you slightly sweep your arm behind the head and corkscrew it up. You can use alternating arms. But what other than a shimmy, I can't figure out what move it should go with. I also can't figure out what you do with one arm while the other is active and how you flow into the move in the first place. These things would have been clear if we had some practice combos. Of course, the DVD is already 73 minutes long, so I can't imagine what would happen if more were to be added, but well, raise the price and give what's needed either on a longer video or a two-disk set.

The music is a bit of a disappointment. It's the same throughout the whole DVD and it isn't what I'd call arm-friendly. It's almost synthetic. There are so many pretty pieces of music that could have gone so well with these beautiful movies demonstrated by such a beautiful woman. But mostly you may find you're too absorbed with the moves to notice the music. Would have been nice if it had helped though. No harm in that.

The performance at the end is filled with arm work and this is the one place you do get to see what the moves look like in dance. The song, Yearning, is a favorite of mine.

If Bozenka had done a half-sloppy job, I'd have wanted to rate this video a 3, but if you get anything of her style and form from this instruction, you've got your money's worth.

Didn't like
* It's all voice-over. That puts some distance between you and the teacher, somehow. In fact Bozenka looks into the mirror during the instruction. She looks directly at us when she says thank you (rather sweet) at the end.
* There's no practice sessions that involve us, the learners. May as well call it a demonstration then, not instruction.
* It would have been nice to put the arm moves together with other moves to show how they could be used rather than just see each move in total isolation. Although you do get to see this in the performance at the end, I think a practice session with typical moves and the arm move layered would have been the way to do it.

Totally loved
* Bozenka's perfect, graceful style. The grace goes right to the tips of her fingers.
* Beautifully executed moves, forgetting no details. Note every gaze, finger position and stance because these are not explained but are there to be observed if you pay attention. .
* The big list of arm paths
* The arm-filled performance at the end, set to the beautiful song, Yearning
* Bozenka's smile",1341878400,5,5075,4.550930996714129
8443519,2,B004VLLWC4,"I was looking forward to this dvd. However, was disappointed:

- The presentation could have been better.  The background & lighting is drab with a crinkly velvet curtain that distracts the eyes from following her movement. And in parts she seems too absorbed in following her movements in the mirror in front of her rather than demonstrating a movement to the viewer.
- The filming has been done from behind and the sideway. So you don't really get to see a good full view of each movement. And unless you zoom in the dvd player, you can not clearly see a front view of the movements in the mirror in front of which she demonstrates the moves.
- The moves are demonstrated in isolation and there is not enough explanations for each movement as if she is careful not to give too much away.  No combination of movements demonstrated.

The performance part is ok, but not as good & natural as she usually is.  The dvd is mostly for beginner's level and doesn't have much originality.  Apart from her choosing good descriptive names for a few of the moves, on the whole this dvd lacks substance as an instructional one.",1329091200,12,1116,4.555
8443520,4,B004VLLWC4,"I have over 30 belly dance Dvds by now but in hand and arms my creativity is blank. I have been looking for a good hands and arms DVD, found a few good ones that taught the basics. Bozenka expands the arms routines into a larger vocabulary. She presents 12 different arms movements with 3 diff series from basic to advanced and 6 hands movements. She concludes with wonderful 4 mn performance which demonstrates how to use the hands and arms movements while dancing. I am learning various arms movements which I hadn't found in others. The cons is the dvd is too short, each movement is demonstrated in about 2mn, I would ve appreciated to see each movement taught with music before moving on to the next. Overall this DVD is great, I am happy I bought it.

Here is the list:

*****************
After 3 months , I realize this Dvd would have been musch better if she took the time to teach and also added a routine to use the arms, making it at least 100mn",1323475200,12,1328,4.68
