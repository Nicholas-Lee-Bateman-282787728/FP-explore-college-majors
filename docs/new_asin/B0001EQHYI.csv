1994577,4,B0001EQHYI,"This academy award-nominated 1977 film is a co-production of western and Soviet film professionals, narrated by the late Princess Grace of Monaco.  There are no subtitles--all translations are done by voiceover.  It is one of three documentaries about the Kirov Ballet and its school, the Vaganova Choreographic Institute, in St. Petersburg, Russia (called Leningrad at the time of this film).  The others--""Backstage at the Kirov"" (1984) and ""The Leningrad Legend"" (1989)--are better in terms of production values and believable candid scenes.  But ""Children of Theatre Street"" is the only one that focuses primarily on the students, and therein lies its great appeal.
Theatre Street is the popular name for Rossi Street, on which the entrance to the Kirov's school is located.  Entrance exams are held annually.  Thousands of children, aged 10-12, apply; only 20 are selected.  Some of the rigorous audition process is shown--the children are chosen for specific physical proportions and natural physical abilities.  As the narrator tells us, ""Talent is considered worth measuring only when it occurs in the right body.""  Those chosen face eight years of relative luxury and privilege in the Soviet Union, but also a life of hard work and discipline.
Featured are an 11-year-old girl, a 13-year old boy, and two girls from the graduating class, with much of the focus on preparations for the upcoming graduation performance.  The students are shown going to performances, a beach on the Gulf of Finland, and Petrodvorets, the tsars' summer palace near St. Petersburg.  They are also shown in a meeting of the Pioneers, the first step in becoming a member of the Communist Party.  Some of the activities and interviews with the students were obviously staged (such as a pillow fight when the boy ""sneaks"" into the girls' dorm) and many are suspect.  I wondered how much of the purported closeness between the featured students was for the sake of the film.  One real and touching moment, which the scriptwriters chose not to translate, was when the two graduating girls, who are roommates, have finished their much-anticipated (and dreaded) graduation performance and are congratulating each other, full of excitement and relief.
Marring the film is its frequent stage-iness, as well as one messy sequence which intersperses classroom scenes with performances of ""Swan Lake,"" while the music of the ballet is superimposed over the classroom piano, and music from one part of the ballet is played while the dancers perform another part.  However, there are plenty of views of beautiful St. Petersburg, and the scenes of the students in classes and performances are delightful, so I give this film four stars.  One of the Kirov's illustrious alumni, Rudolf Nureyev, is quoted on the jacket:  ""...at the Kirov School, there will always be another vintage year, and 'Theatre Street' tells why.""",972259200,75,2891,5.209503239740821
1994578,3,B0001EQHYI,"I enjoyed this peek into the young performers at the Kirov, but I would have liked more.  It was a nice surface view, but did not get as deep as I would have hoped.  Given the time it was filmed, I guess I should have expected that.  Still worth the look.",1359763200,3,255,3.9607843137254903
1994579,4,B0001EQHYI,"Grace Kelly's voice is just right for this classical theme.  The story is a bit whitewashed....Russia was a hard country to live in, which was not revealed, but the children were well cared for. It was very much stricter and classes were fuller is what memory tells me from other reading, however I enjoyed the DVD very much. It arrived safely, obviously!",1355702400,,355,4.725806451612903
1994580,5,B0001EQHYI,"Though made years ago, the training method hasn't change and is still as valuable as ever. The narration by Grace Kelly is excellent and the children are superb.",1354406400,,161,4.785714285714286
1994581,4,B0001EQHYI,"""Talent is considered worth measuring only when it occurs in the right body,"" announces the narrator as hundreds of children are paraded across the camera.  They're all aged 10-12 and gleaned from an application pool of thousands who are eager to be chosen to attend the illustrious Vaganova Choreographic Institute and Kirov Ballet.  It's an incredibly rigorous audition process, with children measured and chosen for the specific physical proportions historically required of ballerinas even before their skill is evaluated but, as this movie keenly illustrates, the audition is only the first step in the lifetime of rigorous discipline that awaits those who make it past the application process.

The narrator here is Princess Grace of Monaco, also known as Grace Kelly. The movie is The Children of Theatre Street and is directed by Robert Dornhelm and Earle Mack. Produced in 1977 by a team made up of both Soviet and western filmmakers, this academy award-nominated film gives an incredibly interesting look at the arts in Russia at the height of Soviet control.

But the focus here is on the children referenced in the title.  The movie follows various students of the school through one year in their life.  We see several students prepare for the performance that marks their graduation from the school, observe their activities and interactions, and find out just how much dedication is necessary for ballerinas to truly perfect their craft.

We are also introduced to the teachers and staff at the school and are treated to a history of the Kirov Ballet and beautiful scenes of St. Petersburg. Partially because of the time it was produced the film can occasionally seem a little staged, but the interactions between the young ballerinas more than makes up for this.

The movie is about hard work, about the sweat and the tears that these students put into every day of their training, but it's also about the joy that lies in the dance.  For the children of Theatre Street, ballet was their life- a life they were determined to live to the fullest.",1330646400,2,2061,4.968023255813954
1994582,5,B0001EQHYI,"Part propaganda, part humor, part documentary and all true this is the only chance left to see the Kirov as it was for the children who aspired to be the Stars of Soviet Ballet. You overhear today the comments of audiences worldwide when they say ""how old are those kids"" in awe, but when you see the sweat and tears that go into classical dance all you can have is respect. There are other schools but try to name a world class first star who didn't graduate from the Vaganova Academy.
The film is narrated by the late Princess Grace of Monaco and that already announces a 'class act.'  She is careful, tasteful and sensitive towards the youngsters who are the protagonists of the film.  The most obvious is a boy who really understands his role as an ambassador for the school, ambassador for the USSR and Young Pioneer (as one would say, he's downright ""Timuresque"" in the best possible way). Perhaps another aspect of the film is you go from it aware that all of these artists are, first of all, people.  That nothing great is accomplished without effort. That we find joy in doing the impossible.
There are some who will say that this DVD is 'dated' but they are wrong. The students at the Vaganova Academy today will be doing pretty much the same things they did when this was made.  That's what you have to do to become the greatest.
What has changed?  Tickets are still hard to get. Entry to the school is still highly limited.  The buildings have been renovated and the Mariinsky Theater is about to have a major and total renovation. The current Director, V. Gergiev, has waited until they were able to acquire the former popular assembly hall (Party meetings back when) so that they will have a place to work from while the Mariinsky/Kirov is being rehabilitated.  The 'new' Bolshoi may have the 'glitz' for now, but the Kirov/Mariinsky is, and will always be, the home of the Vaganova Academy which has no equal.
See it and decide for yourself.",1328054400,3,1956,4.571428571428571
1994583,5,B0001EQHYI,"I'm not sure why this got such low reviews, this video was such an interesting insight into the Kirov. Granted, this is a Soviet era documentary, I think things have changed greatly, but, for someone obsessed with Russian ballet, like myself, this documentary is a valuable addition to your library. On an interesting side note, there is a young dancer featured in this documentary (sorry, I don't recall her name), that is featured 11 or so years later in ""Backstage at the Kirov"" and then again, as artistic director of the Kirov twenty-something years later in ""Ballerina"".",1326412800,,576,4.948453608247423
1994584,1,B0001EQHYI,"Some of the footage here might be earlier than 1977, it's Soviet Russia, eons before the place opened up.  What we see in the footage is much too old to describe the school in the 21st Century.  Grace Kelly drones on and on, and at one point quietly informs us that Nureyev, Makarova, and Baryshnikov are never mentioned because they defected.  Well, they were rehabilitated years ago, and Grace herself is long gone.  It's a humorless, dated documentary, and should be retired to the dust bin.  Ignore any recent dates for the video's release, it has nothing to do with 2004.  It's 35+ years old, and does not follow up on students who built careers.

Although different in purpose, Born To Be Wild, featuring 4 top male dancers from American Ballet Theatre a few years ago is highly entertaining, and I ended up buying some ballet DVD's featuring those guys.",1302307200,5,860,4.693333333333333
1994585,5,B0001EQHYI,I donated this DVD to my daughter for use in her class (she is a public school dance teacher). She has used this DVD in teaching the history of dance to her students. She feels this has been a very helpful tool in her classroom.,1288224000,,228,4.088888888888889
1994586,5,B0001EQHYI,This movie takes you into the lives of children who aspire to have a professional career in the ballet.  It takes you behind the scenes and allows you to see the committment these children make as well as everything these children go through in order to reach their goal.  Wonderful movie which I highly recommend.,1264809600,2,314,4.6909090909090905
1994587,5,B0001EQHYI,"Bought this for my mom- a devoted Ballet Fan- after her precious VHS copy was lost (and so that she could enjoy this timelass classic on DVD!). She should really be the one writing this review because the film takes her breath away- it's originality, its truth and, of course, the fabulous Grace Kelly as 'herself'.
A unique insight into Kirov draws everyone- young and old, and dancers AND athletes. Through the eyes of its students, one learns that, no matter your sport, you can do anything you want, with PASSION, COMMITMENT, HARD WORK and COURAGE.

I would have paid 3 times the amount of the DVD- this is really very special.",1264809600,4,631,4.633928571428571

1994590,5,B0001EQHYI,This DVD is specific to dance audiences.  Good for children and adults interested in the history of the Kirov and how ballet dancers are selected from an early age.  Very informative for students studying ballet seriously.,1194480000,4,222,5.138888888888889
1994591,5,B0001EQHYI,"This candid, lovingly made 1977 tribute to the Kirov strivers who make big sacrifices to attend the legendary training ground of Balanchine is a sheer delight, both aesthetically and narratively, letting us peer into a highly disciplined world of pure art where expectations are high and the weight of tradition almost oppressive. With Grace Kelly's warm, vivid narration providing the context and translations, we watch as 20 students out of 1000 are carefully selected according to predetermined physical requirements, then spend close to a decade mastering their dance skills. You can't help feeling anxiety and then excitement watching one graduating ballerina make her heart-fluttering debut on the Kirov stage after months of punishing practice. ""Street"" is a tremendously enjoyable, behind-the-scenes look at greatness in the making.",1183593600,8,840,5.674603174603175
1994592,4,B0001EQHYI,A very interesting look at a students' life at the Kirov showing how they work hard but play hard too. The narration is informative but the narrator speaks throughtout in such a very sad and monotonous voice even when she is talking about the inner joy of dancing that this film is best watched with the sound turned off.,1180828800,,321,4.4576271186440675
1994593,4,B0001EQHYI,"This film gives a nice overview of what life is like for children in a russian ballet school...almost too nice. Having trained with a former dancer of the Moscow Rennasciance Ballet and Kirov Ballet School (the school in this video) I know what things are really like from hearing her stories. This film tends to be all over the place, taking the opportunity to give some history about the russian captial, etc. More footage of the students in training would have been nice, but like I said, it is a nice over view. It may be a little outdated...it was made in the 70's after all, and a few changes have happened in Russia since then...",1179360000,,636,4.491379310344827
1994594,5,B0001EQHYI,"I found this DVD very inspirational in terms of motivating students of ballet to really work hard and strive for perfection.  It was interesting and informative to see how the Russian students were picked and what happens to them in their schooling, up to a final performance where they are seen by the public and how they later become successful dancers.  There is a wonderful segment showing the older student and how she learns old choreography from an older former great Russian ballerina, like it is handed down reverently from generation to generation.  I loved the dancing of these students, as well as the joy they showed in their training.",1139356800,11,648,4.872727272727273
1994595,5,B0001EQHYI,"I thoroughly enjoyed this video. It is the story of several Russian ballet students, and just how much work goes into becoming a professional ballet dancer.

8011502,5,B0001EQHYI,"This film captures as nothing else could the minute details of what it really means to become an accomplished ballet dancer under the rigorous guidance of the best teachers in the world. It uniquely shares with viewers the process by which a group of very young children, chosen simply for their potential,  sustain a commitment which demands 100% of their attention for a very long period of time, inspired by teachers who themselves were among the greatest dancers of their time. My husband was a student at Vaganova, and judging from his comments every time we watch it, this film is the real thing, and absolutely precious. For any child who is thinking of becoming a serious ballet student, this film should be de rigeur. It raises all of the right questions, and provides many of the answers to encourage or discourage such a decision, and sets an unmatchable standard. When I was a child, what we had was ""Red Shoes"" with Moira Shearer, which was both inspiration and warning. In a way, this is its companion piece: real life, examined in minute detail, without the tragic message, but with all of the aspiration, discipline and hard work required for artistic achievement left intact.",1401840000,,1192,4.8431372549019605
