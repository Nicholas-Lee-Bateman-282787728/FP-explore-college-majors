It does a great job mixing in scenes of actual golf with more kid-friendly animation and kids playing golf. The narration isn't irritating or patronizing, which is one thing I was concerned about before purchasing this. The animated tiger (""Turner"") is cute without being ""cutesy"" or silly. Overall, this DVD treats the subject matter with respect, but at the same time is entertaining.",1172188800,2,532,4.98876404494382
2354452,5,B000A2X9QU,"Thought it may be too immature for my kids after we started watching the first time.  It has a very 'baby einstein' feel to it with the music and cartoon character.  Turned out that my kids were VERY into it and have asked to see it again and again.  They were saying ""putter"" and ""shot"" after the first viewing.  I have other ""baby"" sport videos but they tend to get too creative and gimmicky with the camera angles, speed and silly chatter to hold my kids' attention.  I recommend this video and plan to purchase the soccer and baseball versions due out late 2006 (I found this information on their website after searching for more offerings from this company).",1153612800,4,663,4.53781512605042
2354453,1,B000A2X9QU,"This is suppose to be a video for babies and toddlers, yet they are forcing instruction.  I am a coach and former athlete recognizing that instruction should not come to children prior to school age.  I am disguisted by the way parents today are burning their children out.  I have found other similar videos that introduce children to sports in a fun playful manner.  Can not recommend this video!!",1141084800,4,399,4.739130434782608
2354454,5,B000A2X9QU,"This has got to be the best 16 dollars I have ever spent on my son Tyler.  Tyler wants to be like his daddy and play golf and this video makes him feel all grown up, helps him use the terminology, and swing the club correctly.  He loves to putt on his daddy's practice green now because of the video. Mia, my 1 year old is barely walking but is already carrying around the club and points at the screen when the Tiger comes up - she loves him! Can't wait for soccer to come out! BRAVO to the minds behing this great video.",1132531200,2,522,4.009615384615385
2354455,5,B000A2X9QU,"I bought this for my husband who loves golf and wanted to get a head start with Connor, our 15 month old grandson.  He has picked up his plastic clubs and is swinging them all over the house! It is so cute.  He is starting to talk and some of his words are golf words -- a little Tiger Woods in the making??? Definitely recommended!!!!",1131148800,,335,4.138461538461539
2354456,5,B000A2X9QU,"I was a bit skeptical about ordering this DVD but I must say that not only do my kids love it, I love it too! It was very professionally done - with Disney like quality to it and it was very good at teaching the basics of golf to my two sons who I must say do not want to learn it from me....I am very keen on the series and think it is intelligently put together and I would defintely recommend it to others who love Golf or want their kids to love it!",1130457600,4,453,3.778947368421053
8073433,5,B000A2X9QU,"Our 18 month old son loves golf and loves this dvd.  This is the only thing he wants to watch.  It does a great job of explaining the basics of golf to kids and pairs it with music.  Highly recommend to anyone with kids that enjoy sports, especially golf.",1430265600,,255,4.163265306122449
8073434,5,B000A2X9QU,My grandson asks me to play it every time we get in the car.  It teaches some good golf etiquette at early age.,1372896000,,111,3.8260869565217392
8073435,5,B000A2X9QU,"i bought this for my 2 year old son over a year ago (he is now 3) and he literally will watch it 5 times in a row everyday if i let him. he loooooves it and it taught him all the names of the clubs and how to stretch before swinging. i have to order and new copy actually, because he's worn it out!!!",1362096000,,300,3.6307692307692307
8073436,4,B000A2X9QU,"My three year old just started taking golf lessons and I thought this would be just a cute movie with the animated characters, shockingly, there really is not much of the cute little tiger that's shown on the cover, but to my surprise, even without the tiger character playing a big role in the movie, my daughter loves watching this.  It has a lot of great reiteration of what she's learning in her lessons and she watches this almost daily.  If your child is into golf, they will enjoy this movie.",1301270400,,499,4.472527472527473
8073437,5,B000A2X9QU,"My daughter, 13 months, loves watching this video.  The instruction is very, very light.  Telling kids to swing ""back and thru"" or that when you hit off a tee it's called ""driving"" or that when you roll the ball that's called ""putting"".

My daughter had already shown interst in her plastic clubs and I believe this has helped her learn from watching to swing the club and not pounded it like a hammer on the ground.  It's also got fun annimations and lots of kids hitting balls.  It's even got a section on animals that you might see on the course.",1277078400,,549,4.396039603960396
8073438,5,B000A2X9QU,"My son developed an interest in golf at age 4 and no, we are not avid golfers pushing him into the sport.  He chooses to watch the golf channel of all things so I was not sure if this would be too babyish for him or not but at 5 he still watches it and loves it.  Now, my daughter who is 3 watches it with him and enjoys it too.  It seems to be a great, basic introduction to golf for young children.",1274918400,2,400,3.738095238095238
8073439,5,B000A2X9QU,My 23 month old and 3 year old boys are obsessed with this DVD.  They want to watch it again and again and again.  I think it's well made and very entertaining.  It has pleasant music and not too much chatter - so it's easy on the parents too.  Highly recommend.  Wish they made other sports...or do they??,1253664000,,306,4.206896551724138
8073440,5,B000A2X9QU,"My husband bout this DVD when our son was 7 months old at that time he wasn't interested in any cartoons but at soon I put this one he liked it. He is 3 1/2 and he still likes it and now he loves golf. He ask his dad daily to take him to hit some balls. Its a great DVD and I recommended, he learned a lot from it.",1237680000,,314,3.5
8073441,5,B000A2X9QU,My 3 yr old triplets love this video!!!!  Highly recommend for anyone who wants to introduce their little one to the world of golf.,1199232000,,131,4.458333333333333
8073442,5,B000A2X9QU,Both my three year old and my 1 and 1/2 year old LOVE this video. It has taught them the correct terminology and technique and gotten them excited about golf.  Both my sons are on the autism spectrum so that is quite a feat.  I even got one for my cousin's shower since her husband is a golf addict. It was their favorite gift!,1177027200,,327,4.09375
