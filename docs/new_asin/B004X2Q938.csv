8445991,5,B004X2Q938,One our third week of the supplements and my son is definitely more engaged and witty. He has started swimming underwater which before he hated getting his face wet. We always had to push him to try new things. He seems to be experimenting more like other peers.,1529020800,,262,4.479166666666667
8445992,5,B004X2Q938,"CURED MY DAUGHTER OF BIPOLAR. I know what you're thinking--she probably wasn't really sick. Yes, she was. She got sick around her 2nd birthday. She was the baby of the family and I had never seen behavior like this in a child, really bizarre stuff. It was a nightmare. Diagnosed at the age of 3; had every single symptom of childhood bipolar as described in the DSM. Children's hospital evaluated her as impaired enough to need medication. Hospitalized twice, at 5 years and 8 years old. We had started looking for a residential hospital for her. We couldn't handle the screaming anymore. Then I remembered Dianne Craft. She often presented at the local homeschool convention. So we began rebuilding our girl's biome (she was a meth baby; meth devastates the body's biome). I noticed improvement in 3 days. After a month, we started weaning her off of her psych meds. At the end of 90 days, she was like someone waking up from a coma, experiencing everything like it was new (i.e.,we'd been to the museum 3 times and she remembered none of it!) We continued to rebuild using PRO-15 (sold here on Amazon). That has brought us even further. She is a completely normal calm happy child and we are having a blast re-doing all the stuff she doesn't remember. I've been told it also works for adhd, depression, even tourettes in children and adults. If you suspect you or someone you love needs this, don't wait. We lost 8 years; 8 hours still would've been too much.",1486857600,11,1461,4.644787644787645
8445993,5,B004X2Q938,I found these CDs extremely helpful and have shared them already with others....excellent information.,1409961600,4,102,6.357142857142857
8445994,5,B004X2Q938,"Ms. Craft is brilliant. If you have a child that struggles with sensory issues, ADD, autism, ect. this cd is an excellent resource. She explains what is happening and how to help them in a very clear, easy to understand manner. I only wish it was in book form so that it was easier to refer back to.  One word of caution...do not loan it out. You will want to listen to it again but you will never get it back.",1408406400,13,410,4.061728395061729
8445995,5,B004X2Q938,It gave me I nights into my sons inattention I had never before considered. I would highly recommend  it to everyone with children. The information is helpful for almost any child. Nutrition is so important!,1394582400,7,207,4.914285714285715
8445996,5,B004X2Q938,"We started this program and saw a little improvement.  Nearly gave up about half way through but increased our son's probiotics (which we realized he hadn't been taking) and saw DRASTIC improvement.  If you want to avoid prescription meds for your child with ADHD symptoms, start with this!  It is an investment in the supplements BUT imo, it's comparable to all the co-pays for doctor visits/evals, prescriptions, and collateral meds that would be the case going the medical route.  However, this program actually heals rather than just managing symptoms.",1390867200,25,556,5.213483146067416
8445997,3,B004X2Q938,"The audio program (and the reference insert) list a ton of natural supplements to use.  Our first order for two kids was over a hundred dollars - they do seem to be behaving a bit better after doing the program for a month, but we've been doing a number of other things too.  Before you buy the CD, be sure that you're ready for a continuing investment.",1324771200,25,353,4.253731343283582
8445998,5,B004X2Q938,"While doing research on my son's behavioral problems, my chiropractor let me borrow this audio book.  IT IS AMAZING. Every symptom my son has ever displayed is in this book.  We've begun the treatment as Dianne has outlined, and I am very excited to see the results.  If you google the title of this book, you will find Dianne Craft's website.  She has a video on the site that is an overview of these discs.  If your child has had more than three ear infections or treated with strong antibiotics as a child and now displays behavioral issues that resemble Sensory Processing Disorder, you defintely want to hear what this author/teacher has to say.",1314662400,25,650,4.666666666666667
