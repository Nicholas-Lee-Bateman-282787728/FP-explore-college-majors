For example at the time of writing their Gothic Spirits CD range is now heading into Volume 18(!). Replicating the formula - and a lot of the material if truth be known - is the CD series Symphonic Metal - Dark and Beautiful which is currently standing at around Vol VII as well as a series under the subtitle Dark Ladies (the fourth instalment came out a short time ago) as well as a series of CD's under the banner Opera Metal which also has several releases under its belt. Each of them has a lot of the same material - hey, if you are gonna pay for that licensing you might as well use it huh?

In terms of DVD's we've not got such a rude array of ZYX releases to choose from. There are some Gothic Spirits DVD's and live DVD's with the same sort of bands. And we now have a couple of Opera Metal DVD's.

Another reviewer has gone to the trouble of writing out the whole playlist so I'll not replicate that here. What I will do is to point out that these release should only be picked up cheap if possible because much of the material you could almost certainly source for free. Also note that apart from the nice cover art from Luis Royo there is no booklet, no insight at all. Just a DVD with music videos on it.

The navigation is simplicity itself here and my copy is zone free so happy days for all those people who buy discs from overseas and then write up one star reviews because they can't play the thing.

With over an hour of music from its 18 videos this package is value, there is a lot of variety here in and pretty darn broad use of the term Opera Metal to warrant the inclusion of some of the featured bands is in use. Bigger names here - and the ones that by and large bring home the bacon - are Xandria, Avantasia and Nuclear Blasts stab at the pop limelight Indica. Battlelores offering has an interesting drum beat usage and the bare chested ladies dancing in parts of the video of the Heavenly song Fullmoon may prove diverting for some.

Nightwish, Epica and Cradle of Filth are other larger bands at the tail end of the offering and they are safe hands for those who like this sort of metal. Surprise packages for me personally were Darkwell with their interestingly put together tune Fate of Prisoner which looks like it cost about ten dollars to make, but which makes excellent use of those ten dollars. And that's a compliment, not sarcasm. Though speaking of production values it's clear many of these bands are not selling in the obscene quantities of, say, U2 or Metallica. And hence their videos have not had bucket loads of money thrown at them.

All up if this is your sort of music - Eurocentric symphonic/gothic/power/ metal - and you have difficult or uncertain access to the internet this is probably a brilliant pick up. The value for those of us who can get this stuff via other means is probably less.",1413504000,2,3006,4.3303730017761985
8402628,5,B003QUBTGU,"I'm a big fan of female fronted metal bands and this has a good amount of the females! I don't mind some of the male fronted bands here cause they're Euro-Metal bands. Living here in the states, I don't ever get to see any videos of bands from Europe or anything outside the US! So, I cherish these DVD's of videos of bands I love. Ok, you get a total of 18 videos here, making it a total of 1 hr and 20 mins of pure symphonic sight and sound!
