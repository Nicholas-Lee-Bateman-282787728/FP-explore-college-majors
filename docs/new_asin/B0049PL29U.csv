8419184,4,B0049PL29U,"It was pretty good and it was nice to see some ""minor"" bands that actually played a big roll at the time.

If you want to see how ""major"" bands of the era had an impact on the fall of the wall, google ""Moscow Music Peace Festival""  which took place just weeks before the fall of the wall actually happened.",1501286400,,306,4.083333333333333

8419186,4,B0049PL29U,"There aren't many people in this generation that might remember how rash and how dangerous the Cold War was; movies such as The Day After showed us the grave consequences of what might have happened had a confrontation slipped out of control between NATO and Warsaw Pact countries. Yet it was more about the ideology that split our societies apart rather than nuclear weapons.

In a world where we take our culture for granted, its hard to believe that the music, the fashion, and just about anything from The West was banned throughout half of Europe for nearly half a century. But this music that was being broadcast over the airwaves from Radio Free Europe would eventually give people in oppressed countries such as The USSR, Poland, and Hungary a voice to stand up and hear what society beyond the Berlin Wall and beyond The Iron Curtain was really like; they too wanted their share of it and over time it finally happened.

As rock and rolls embryonic stages in the 1950s helped distract teenage youth from thoughts of nuclear annihilation and begin to create the coming of age soundtrack for rebellious American youth, its raw power and energy became a friend, a symbol of hope for those who lived in fear and were deprived of democracy. The Documentary Rockin The Wall: How Music Ripped The Iron Curtain takes us on a journey through Cold War Europe with the stories of how this music was banned and seen as a threat to what was seen by the communists, as the proper way of life. Escapes through railway tunnels, the smell and sights of freedom, friends who turned out to be spies, a soldier destroying someones Yes album, the tension of bands having to go through customs, the fear of being sent to prison camps, bootleg recordings, plus the anguish and the longing for something else; we are there with them, we feel the pain and the tension. Yet the signs of things to come were prevalent as well; rock music being allowed in Russia, bands finally getting to tour behind the Iron Curtain, and even stories of how Russian soldiers themselves were fans of the music (often wanting autographs from bands going through customs), showing that even those in the government couldn't be kept down for long.

It didn't happen overnight, but eventually the walls came down and a weight was lifted off the shoulders of many who were starved for freedom. Stories from members of Vanilla Fudge and Mothers Finest, whom the latter saw first hand the actual strain of events having played West Berlin many times during the cold war; other appearances from Robbie Krieger, Rudy Sarzo, as well as a whole host of Eastern musicians and music fans give us their account on how music affected them and how the political events inspired not only lyrics, but also the tone and the vibe of the music as well. Its an account into a world that was and how no one should ever underestimate the power of rock music. In the end its the words of Bob Geldolf that rein true, as he once made the statement that The international language isn't English, its Rock and Roll, cant argue with him on that.

For those  like me - who lived through the cold war of the 1950s and 60s, it will be a reminder of events that occurred in our lives from the duck and cover exercises in school (remember fallout shelters?) to the Cuban missile crisis. And there is music of the period too, though much of it is limited to recreations by the musicians who participated in the interviews. (Obviously licensing costs were the reason for this.).

Writer/director Marc Leif was able to get a good balance of viewpoints in securing his interview subjects. Starting with a History Professor who was once a member of a rock band in the early 60s the viewer is shown how the Iron curtain  and later the physical presence of the Berlin Wall came to be. A former manager for the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe operation tells how the US and its allies were able to broadcast jazz and rock to those in the Communist countries in Eastern Europe. We also hear from a half dozen people who were behind the wall and how they would smuggle or trade 10th generation cassette tapes of rock music. One interviewee in particular tells his harrowing story of escaping through a train tunnel to get to the West where he became a well-known record producer.

Speaking of well-known Leif was able to get new interviews with the two original lead members of Vanilla Fudge (who recreate their hit psychedelic version of the Supremes hit You Keep Me Hanging On, as well as a member of the band Toto and one from the Yellow Jackets and another from Quiet Riot. Another trio  Mothers Finest  was new to me but this Atlanta-based group was apparently big in Sweden (based on the concert footage).

The flow of the film is excellent with discussions of world politics, repression in the Soviet Union and what it was like for American musicians to travel to play and go through Checkpoint Charlie (the only opening in the wall.
This would make a great film for history classes in both high school and college. And, because there is no strong language, I think it still appropriate for any junior high level student as well.

Sadly, there are no special features on the DVD  just chapter stops  but when the Eastern European interviewees are speaking English, the director also includes easy-to-read English subtitles.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Schweikart briefly disucssed this film during a talk at the Heritage Foundation about his book ""A Patriot's History of the Modern World: From America's Exceptional Ascent to the Atomic Bomb, 1898-1945"".  The talk was October 2012, but I did not watch the dvr until yesterday.  I have already ordered the book to my Kindle.  I hope this film becomes available soon!

When I get the CD I will add to this review.",1362873600,,517,4.446808510638298
