7931995,4,B000056BPJ,A nice story and a nice film.  See it. Not hardcore porno but a nice film anyway. The Norwegian stylists Jan Thomas makes his debut on this film.,1383350400,,145,4.178571428571429
7931996,3,B000056BPJ,I enjoyed the way the movie put me at ease.  The men in the movie were very handsome. Hot eye candy and playful.,1314576000,,112,3.869565217391304
7931997,1,B000056BPJ,"The premise is confusing - guy in relationship has commitment problems, has dream while in Mojave desert with his partner, a guy, walks throuhg Mojave and meets in three scenarios with attractive guys, is denied sex by first guy, watches two twinks simulate love-making and get ""come-hither"" signal to join in, then makes it (maybe - all sex is simulated and hidden) with a young nymph of a guy. He then wakes up and for the next interminable period (seemed-like-an-hour) makes soft-porn love with his partner.

There are pretty bodies, the scenery is great, but there is too little of it, the music is an intrusively repetitious guitar, and the photography very good. But there is very little dialogue - a few sentences in the opening scene, a few in the ""gee, I fell asleep"" stage. Enough to be sure that these aren't actors, just very handsome men better watched in a darkened theatre than in the light of day.

One has the feeling of a 1960s softcore porn flick made with all the lavish detail of a 2008 porn film, but with the same caliber of actor - eye candy, no more.

If see it you must, have your fast-forward button well-lubed, and try to get a much-used copy at a knock-down price. You'll probably not watch it again.",1221264000,2,1229,4.577272727272727
