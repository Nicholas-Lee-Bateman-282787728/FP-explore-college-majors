8317149,5,B001L4I26I,"A Visually Stunning Film!  A great Art Film and filled with everything you wanted to know of Courtesans in the Yoshiwara.  It was glamorous to be an Oiran or so one thought.  Behind the scenes, a very different take behind that facade.  Jealousies abound.  Who was to be popular next?  Love Affairs and Seductions!  To Fall in Love usually spelled disaster for Courtesans.  You had to be tough in the business and shoulder all the responsibilities to make money for the those in the House you were sold into.  A Historical view of a life in such a place.  There is nudity in it, and some sex scenes, but nothing I would call pornographic.  If anything it is an Art Film and the visuals are amazing like the decor and and sets they use.  The Kimonos are Spectacular and even the Hairstyles are accurate.  They really did that to their hair!  Get yourself an All Region DVD Player and get this movie!  While you wait for your DVD player and movie get the Book Sakuran Blossoms Wild.  Read it first, (I still can't put it down) and get to know the characters, story etc.  It helps understand the movie even more!  The Movie does you a favor after you read the book.  The Book  stops where she returns to the House.  The Movie Continues on Forward to when she does indeed become The Greatest Oiran.  You will want to keep reading the book and watching the movie.",1519603200,,1358,4.412955465587045

8317151,3,B001L4I26I,"The story is similar to that of ""Geisha"". In the reviews I read much was made of its visual opulence, so being a fan of eye-candy I decided I had to check it out. I'm not as impressed as the other reviewers, but I suspect the visual quality might be much improved on the new BluRay version. My reason for buying this edition was to see if the BR version would be worth the money. I'm not going to buy it. My reason for writing about this product, however, is to report that it plays fine on my all-region Oppo upconverting DVD player and LG HD TV. At the price, it was worth the risk.",1348444800,,584,4.086956521739131

I have no idea why it is not more famous!",1229558400,2,214,3.953488372093023
