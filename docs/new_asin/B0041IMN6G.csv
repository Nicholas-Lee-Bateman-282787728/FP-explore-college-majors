8638087,5,B0041IMN6G,"BABEL tells four interconnected stories in four languages. The link for all is a Winchester rifle that once belonged to a Japanese businessman. Perhaps the most compelling of these situations involves that man's teen daughter, a chronically depressed deaf mute who's obsessed with a police detective.

Director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu gives us enough information along the way to hold our interest, revealing facts when necessary or timely. For instance, we don't learn of the rifle's origin and its chain of owners until well after an unintended injury occurs.

There's troubling events in all of this film's locations: Morocco, Japan, Mexico, and to a lesser extent, California. A mostly unknown cast give naturalistic performances, some of which will haunt you long after the credits start to roll.

Highest recommendation for a brilliant motion picture.",1396656000,2,858,5.43609022556391
