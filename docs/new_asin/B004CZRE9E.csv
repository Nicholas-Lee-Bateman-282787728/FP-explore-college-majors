8424236,3,B004CZRE9E,Should have been a real masterpiece with what they had to work with. Instead it's an endless game between long retired legends with minimal attention to anything else.,1366329600,,167,5.0
8424237,5,B004CZRE9E,DVD covers the anniversary basketball game interspersed with highlights/recollections of players and coaches from past decades. Nice to see film of past players and hear their comments today.,1360540800,,191,5.857142857142857
8424238,4,B004CZRE9E,"This dvd was just what I expected.  I was fortunate to attend the 100 year celebration live and I wanted something to look  back upon it like this dvd.  I was hoping for some extras but basically this was just a recording of the event.  If you did not attend this event, you would probably enjoy it that much more.",1320537600,4,314,4.183333333333334
8424239,5,B004CZRE9E,"This DVD was good.
A great production for any true tar heels fan. It was great to see the alumni game. But, I wish the whole pro alumni game was shown with the current NBA players and more recent graduates in it's entirety.  I felt this would have made DVD better.  The older alumni game should have been just highlights.",1314576000,3,321,4.333333333333333
