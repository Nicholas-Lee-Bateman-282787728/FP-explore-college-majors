2154523,5,B00030A5IE,"There is nothing out there for men, just for women, except Gilad.  My wife introduced me to all of her other workout DVDs which are great but the cardio hardly makes a sweat pearl run.  Then she suggested Gilad.  I am just very slightly overweight and I am getting now back into shape.  Gilad makes me swim in sweat doing cardio.  He also makes me not hungry after the workout which is also a good sign of a good workout, so you don't overeat and put the weight back on.

After the anaerobic toning workout part my WHOLE body is completely weak and tired, but I am not hurting.  Another good sign of a good workout, because ""pain is the bodies natural sign to make you stop"" (Arnold Schwarzenegger).  Gilad does the perfect workout for men.  Women are not excluded.  (After all, there are women in the exercise DVD.)  But for men, this is THE DVD.  ""You gotta want this"".  This was a great buy.  Gilad makes my fat run away and muscles tone out.  I love it.",1163980800,27,957,4.297752808988764
2154524,5,B00030A5IE,"This tape is all you really need because it has a great workout.  The first is 45 minutes of aerobics and the following 45 minutes is a toning workout. While I don't know if there is a previously released tape for the first 45 minutes, the second 45 minutes is actually his previously released 'Gilad: Hips Abs & Arms Toning'  workout.  I already had that in VHS format but was glad to now have it in DVD.  It took me a while to master the first 45 minutes of the tape because I would get very tired half way through it but now I can finish it even though my face is very red and somewhat swollen when finished, which I welcome as indication that I was challenged.  The second 45 minutes is my favorite as it warms up first then has approximately 10 minutes of arms, 10 minutes of hips/legs and 10 minutes of abs followed by the cool down.  The fact that Gilad has a great accent and is very easy on the eyes is a plus.",1157587200,11,919,4.106145251396648

2154559,4,B00030A5IE,"There are basically two workouts, one cardio and the other toning.  What I like is that you can choose to do just the cardio portion twice (you can skip the warmup the second time around).  The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because the DVD says it's for intermediate to advanced users.  I don't consider myself advanced, yet I didn't have a problem keeping up.  You'll do one series of exercises and then repeat those same exercises a few more times then go on to another set.  Admitted, the clothing that the people are wearing is a bit outdated, but I can get past that, the exercises are good and to me that's what's important.  The exercises aren't real ""dancey"" or complicated yet it keeps your heartrate up.  I like Gilad's workouts.  Nice background if that's important to you.",1406851200,,787,4.531914893617022
2154560,5,B00030A5IE,I purchased this DVD to replace the VHS version.  I have worked out with Bodies in Motion for about 20 years!  I am now almost 61.  The aerobics workout is my all-time favorite.

2154563,5,B00030A5IE,"Gilad, Gilad...Oh how I missed you so!  I was introduced to Aerobic (Gilad) back in college ('90s), and his video workout has ALWAYS been on the very top of my list of faves.  Anyways, after reviewing the reviews on this dvd workout, I knew it was the one to get.  And yikes, the workout is TOUGH, but fun!!  In the beginning of the workout, it seemed that it was going to be too easy; but after 10 minutes or so, the pace went from easy to whoa I-need-to-catch-my-breath!  I'm in relatively okay shape (I can stand to lose 5-10 pounds) - which, working out with Gilad, I KNOW that I will get back in shape in no time!!

It is definitely worth the buy. I really like the 45/45 routine because you get an awesome workout in 45 min. You can do cardio or strength training or both. He has great warm ups and cool downs.

I alternated these workouts as well as an abs workout three times a day, 24-7, while my infants slept. Needless to say, I dropped so much weight that when I returned to work after maternity everyone was speechless.

The time has come for me to once again ""turn up the heat"" with exercise, and I know with these workouts I can again achieve amazing results. I actually feel the results after the first day, and the routines are not hard to follow. The toning workout is truly amazing. If followed as Gilad directs - at least 3 times a week, you will see and feel a difference. I've done these before and they really DO work. The only reason I am repurchasing is because my first copy is VHS format. I highly recommend.",1345680000,3,813,4.413333333333333

2154596,5,B00030A5IE,"If you can only buy ONE workout DVD, get this one. It's complete, basic fitness for any level. There are no dancy moves to mess with your head, or to mess up your knees - you are free to really concentrate on your form and keep your muscles tensed.

The cardio routine is very good, but the toning one is great, one of my all-time favorites (I have almost 100 workout tapes) If you really put everything into it, and pay close attention to form, you not only get tight, focused toning, but just might break a decent sweat in that segment, too.  It covers everything - squats and lunges, a butt routine, varied ab segment, good shoulder,arm and chest stuff, without the need for any weights or equipment -  the instruction is excellent but not deadly serious, and there are NO silly or wasted moves. At only 45 minutes, it's compact and efficient.

I used to have this on a set of two VHS tapes, and felt it was worth upgrading to the DVD.",1230595200,10,938,4.3428571428571425

If you like the ability to do the cardio on one day and the strength training the next, this is perfect.  If you've got extra time and energy, do both! Very versitle, no special equipment or mats required. With that said, you can even add small hand weights to both workouts.

2154619,5,B00030A5IE,Gilad really gives you a good workout on this DVD.  Does he have one that is a little more strenous?,1218412800,,100,4.0
2154620,5,B00030A5IE,"Two very good, moderate level, routines on one disk.  I must abmit that some of the leg exercises in the strength /anaerobic routine are still killers for me.  The aerobic routine is a mix of low and high impact ( jumping jacks, for example).  The moves are not dancy, like so many of the aerobic vids nowadays. Even a clod like me got them down afer a few run-throughs.

Gil's style is very engaging.  I think someone well described him as a ""genial drill sargeant"".  The fact that it's,what, about 20 years old doesn't detract a bit.  It's fun without being trendy and very effective.",1213833600,3,586,4.523809523809524
2154621,5,B00030A5IE,"Somewhat simple yet effective exercises.  When I first started, I could not get through the entire program, I had to pause to catch my breath during the aerobics session and I could not complete half of the toning exercises.  With each day, I became stronger and with each day I completed more of the exercises.  I like to alternate between the two sessions, so I end up doing something each day.  Gilad is fun to follow and gives clear directions on what to do.  Nice warm-up routines, too!",1205280000,2,491,4.534090909090909
2154622,5,B00030A5IE,"I used to be a Billy Blanks devotee until I discovered Gilad on FitTV. He's energetic and enthusiastic without being preachy, and he actually pays attention to the workout, unlike Billy. The 45/45 split is a great workout, whether you do them alone or separately. Not for the beginner, though- you have to be in decent shape to avoid falling over during the workouts. They are pleasantly challenging. This one's a winner!",1200096000,5,421,4.861111111111111
2154623,4,B00030A5IE,"A bit of background info on me: Being a serial gym goer for the past five years (I am 26 and, according to my doctor, in ""great shape"") I have recently decided to mix things up a bit by purchasing some workout DVD's that I can do in the comfort of my own home, on the days I don't feel like trudging to the gym.

So while I am a relative ""newbie"" to workout DVD's, I am NOT a newbie to fitness. For the past several months, I have been doing workout DVD's about twice a week (to supplement gym workouts three times a week) and I already have several workout DVD's in my collection.

Gilad's ""The 45/45 Split Routine Workout"" is one of my favorite workout DVD's thus far.

PROS:
-The cardio workout is very basic.  It raises your heart rate and keeps it raised to a pretty constant rate throughout the entire DVD.  There are no intervals.

-Gilad keeps the workout interesting.  Rarely is a move repeated twice.  The movements flow from one exercise to the next, and the movements are ridiculously easy to follow.  A completely novice could follow along with him.  Someone with two left feet (like me!) will find this workout doable.  Want to do jumping jacks?  Jumping rope?  Running in place?  He incorporates very basic moves in a way that keeps it from getting boring.

-Gilad has a great camera presence.  He's funny and engaging without being forced or cheesy.  Okay, so the ""play the guitar"" move is a little cheesy.  I love walking around after I have done this DVD and saying, ""Good tunes, good tunes!""

CONS:
-I can't do the ""toning"" workout in this DVD, although I bet it's very good.  That is precisely why I cannot do it. Even though you don't use weights, it is VERY challenging.  I had to give up about 15 minutes in.

-Hello 80's!  They are fully decked out in the high-top sneakers, socks, sheer pantyhose, and leotards.  I think Gilad is even wearing a fanny pack.  Sexy.

-For a good calorie burning workout, this falls a little short.  The 45 minute cardio workout includes about 15 minutes of warming up and cooling down (plus another 5 minutes after the warm-up before you get to the nitty gritty) so that leaves about only 25 minutes of real calorie burning exercise.

Overall, this is one of my favorite DVD's to do on days where I need to exercise, but don't want to push myself too hard.  This is a good DVD to do on days where I want something easy.  This workout DVD is great for those who are new to exercise and also for those of us who have been exercising for quite awhile.

This workout DVD is NOT good for those who want weight training, interval training, or anything that is really challenging and really pushes the heart rate.",1199923200,16,2662,4.43801652892562
2154624,3,B00030A5IE,"I love the newer Gilad from his show on FitTV, but this is from 1980's.  This is high-impact aerobics.  However, if you can physically do this sort of workout, it is challenging and will get you in the best shape ever.",1199577600,6,218,4.2926829268292686
2154625,5,B00030A5IE,"Gilad presents two excellent routines that require no additional equipment.  If you are looking for one exercise dvd that you can depend upon, this is it.  I find it very helpful when travelling.  Simply choose the conditioning or toning routine and comfortably do them in your hotel room.

2154640,4,B00030A5IE,"I was looking for something to get in shape with, after having four children.  In the past, I was an intermediate to beginning advanced exerciser, but I had lost a lot of muscle and stamina over the past several years.  I needed something that I could do as a beginner, but would be challenging enough to stick with for several months.  I think this workout fits the bill.  It would probably not challenge a non-beginner enough.

Some things I like: you get two workouts on one DVD, which is nice.  Makes it worth the money.  The toning workout is good enough to do everyday, even if you are low on stamina.  The cardio workout takes a little more energy, but it is really only 30 mins when you take out cool-down and warm-up.",1186531200,3,726,4.406015037593985
2154641,4,B00030A5IE,"I am a big fan of Gilad's workout routines and wanted one in particular that didn't depend on weights that I could use when traveling.  This one is pretty good for that purpose, particularly the toning portion.  When I have ready access to a gym, I've been using the toning sections of Gilad's ""Quickfit"" series which I can highly recommend.  This one is a little less comprehensive, but would get the job done if you mainly want a solid program that can be done in less than an hour and that doesn't require weights.",1182816000,5,517,4.4787234042553195
2154642,5,B00030A5IE,"I love this DVD.  The 45 minutes of high impact with low impact areobics is GREAT!  It's funny I use to exercise to Gilad's show on TV when I was in my late teens/ early twenties and I thought he was great then.  I just bought this DVD a week ago.  I started the 45/45 split DVD and first thought ""wow, this is easy."" then I was barely keeping up with the excerises!  It felt great to finally get a good workout.  Worth every penny!",1174521600,6,432,4.023529411764706
2154643,5,B00030A5IE,"I have been a hardcore Gilad fan since the 80s when I was a little kid and he inspired me all the way back then to do his workouts.  I needed an alternative for the nights I couldn't go to the gym and based on the reviews purchased this DVD.  It takes a LOT to really give me a workout.  I am a marathon runner and a lifetime athlete but this video really does it for me.

Normally I am disappointed in the instructional areobic videos that I have but this was a slam dunk.  The first 45 minute routine is fast paced and intense.  His moves are simple but connect and build on one another.  You will feel your heart pumping and work up a sweat but won't feel exhausted after his workout.  More like energized and feelnig accomplished.  His cool downs and warm ups should not be skipped because they prevent soreness.

His muscle toning excercises kicked my butt!  Again all the movements are small and simple not requiring any equipment or advanced knowledge of excercise but wow are they effective.  You will feel the strain on your muscles and he hits your abs, inner and outer thighs, buttocks, arms, shoulders and chest.  It was so intense I really was expecting to hurt the next day but again the cool down is so effective that I had very little soreness and felt great afterwards.

Just as a side note this is not for the casual athlete.  You should be in decent shape and have some coordination if you expect to get through these routines.  If you are a beginner to areobics get his low impact stuff and build up to this later.",1171238400,70,1534,4.348591549295775

I use it on days when the weather is bad, or in between TA and Jillian Michaels workouts.  gilad queues well, his moves are easy to follow, and you will be sweating buckets.  I took off one star because it gets boring at times.  there are some moves he repeats way too many times.  but don't let that deter you.  I still use it fairly regularly.  I wish he made more like this.  it's hard to find a full 45 minute cardio routine that isn't complicated or interspersed with weight lifting, or some other distracting moves.  I've watched his other videos on youtube and they all seem to have the same moves, just in a different order.  this is really 2 routines in one and probably all you will ever need of Gilad.  the strength training part is nice too.  his warm ups and cool downs are nice.  I sometimes use them to warm and cool down before and after Tracy Anderson.  he is thorough.",1476144000,,908,4.295857988165681

8035592,5,B00030A5IE,"I am totally OVER THE MOON with my new Gilad CD. I have been doing the toning section of this work out - I kid you not, since 1990 and know it by heart - to the extent that I actually had my old VHS tape made into a CD before this was available in CD format!. I misplaced the last one and had come on line to buy another to repeat the performance, when I discovered it was now on CD!
In this format of course it is made even better by the fact that you can now go to sections of the workout with ease and create a perfect workout to fit your schedule. This is without fail one of the best exercise CD's available. Gilad's routines are timeless and totally effective!",1469404800,3,666,3.9776119402985075
