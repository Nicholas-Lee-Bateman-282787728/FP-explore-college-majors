8333894,1,B001PNAV9G,"The condition of the DVD itself didn't appear to be a ""new"" copy like I thought I had purchased.  It has many visible scratches on it, which caused parts in the DVD to freeze.  The material itself was alright, not one of his best DVD's.",1243209600,2,236,4.222222222222222
8333895,2,B001PNAV9G,I love katt williams so I own all of his standup dvds. So it was very sad when I purchased what I thought was going to be a brand new special and it is just clips of everything I already own. I thought I was getting something new but I ddnt.,1242950400,5,241,3.7450980392156863
8333896,1,B001PNAV9G,"I am highly disappointed in amazon. This was either extremely low budget or a bootleg of something else. I'm going to return this item. If you've seen it's pimpin, pimpin or the pimp chronicles, you've seen this. HORRIBLE!",1242691200,5,222,4.868421052631579
8333897,5,B001PNAV9G,This dvd is slammin.  I love the behind the scenes footage that captures Katt's humor even when he is not on stage. Katt is a rare comedian of our time and has yet to reach his apex. Keep pimpin.,1241654400,,195,4.0
8333898,1,B001PNAV9G,"I am a Katt Williams Fanatic....But this is bad! Don't buy it, if you have seen the other DVD's you have seen this one. Also, the picture quality is bad.  I was very disappointed.",1241395200,2,179,4.264705882352941
8333899,5,B001PNAV9G,"This is one of the most hilarious DVD's i've seen in a while. This is Katt in rare form. Its a great blend of stand-up and raw behind the scene footage of Katt on tour like you never seen him before. This guy is super funny on and off the stage. There are maybe one or two jokes of his on this dvd that i have heard before but the majority of the material i've never heard before and i've seen all his dvd's and been to several live shows. There are appearances from Katt's celebrity and comedian friends that compliments the video. Rickey Smiley is extremely funny,among other things. If you are a Katt Williams fan you would definitely want this for your collection.",1240790400,3,668,4.352
8333900,5,B001PNAV9G,"This DVD is a home made compilation of behind-the-scenes and comedy shows across the USA starting out in the Nation's Capital - Washington, DC. It also features other well known people such as Lil Kim, Hammer, Adele Givens, Alonzo Mourning, Lyfe Jennings, plus many, many more people from the entertainment world who you've heard and seen mentioned with Katt's. You also get a lil peek inside the world of what his day is like from a limo ride, to golfing, to clubbing, to just being the 'pimp' he is. It's too bad it's only a lil over an hours worth of material and that it does not include one on one interview sessions. Backed with Katt's own music, the video is dated somewhere around 2005 which puts this pre 'The Pimp Chronicles' and before 'Katt Williams Live's' release. The jokes are ones you've probably heard before if you're a die-hard, so nothing new there. It's a surefire collector's item as there's a segment where Steve Harvey hypes the crowd for Katt in a Miami club. Will that... ever happen... again? Serious Katt Williams collectors/fans/supporters - GET THIS DVD.",1240704000,3,1085,4.776595744680851
