7964516,3,B000068Q86,"Very good choir singing in a gothic church .  The ""Choral Classics"" song choices are quite good.  I was disappointed that this was not a live performance, as in performed for an audience.  Having audience feedback and interaction would have added warmth to what I felt was a rather bland recital.  Having said that, the choristers were all engaged and performed with enthusiasm- in a big empty church.  Of major importance to myself as a viewer is audio quality, of which I can only rate as average.",1509148800,,499,4.689655172413793

7964518,5,B000068Q86,"This is by far one of the best choral performances I have ever had the pleasure to listen to.  I am somewhat of a newcomer to the world of English anthems, but this recording has become my all-time favorite. The sound mixing is amazing: the baritones, altos, and trebles are always at their proper level and the pipe organ never overpowers.  The singing is not only flawless, but moving and inspiring.  Standout selections are ""Insanae et vanae curae"" by Haydn (I can hear the ancestral beginnings of Yes and Led Zep and have played this everyday for about 3 weeks), and ""Bring Us, O Lord"" by William Harris, a beautifully toned acapella arrangement (there are so many different sounds going on at the same time, you will swear you hear an instrument in the background, but it is only the pitch-perfect voices of the choristers ringing out complete 5 part harmonies)!
