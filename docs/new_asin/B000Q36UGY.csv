I bought both of the Costa Rica titles and they are just so relaxing and soothing. I've been putting them on the tv and just leaving them on for hours and they warm my soul on these cold winter days.",1230940800,,347,4.1940298507462686
8194062,5,B000Q36UGY,"I first want to say that both of the soothing environments DVD's I own are really great, well made products. I find them truly inspiring and relaxing and put them on a lot. I've tried a few different brands of these kind of DVDs and I found these to have the best quality. Each one gives you around 2 1/2 hours of video too, so its like getting 2 DVD's for the price of one.

I don't normally write reviews but I had to comment on what one of the other reviews here said about frozen skies, lack of wild life and small waves. This DVD has more changes in the skies than any I've ever seen. Most DVD's have short scenes where nothing really evolves. Each one of these scenes basically goes from day to night or night to day.  I have no idea what they mean by frozen skies. There's one scene here where it starts with just a sliver of light on the horizon and as the sun rises and it changes to daylight, there is a flock of birds circling and fishing the whole time.  No there aren't any 20' swells on this DVD but I would say calling them, ""lap pool waves"" is misleading and inaccurate. Some of  them are quite gentle and small and some of them seen to pack a bit of a punch. Maybe someone is just looking for something that doesnt exist.
I would definitely recommend these DVD's to a potential customer.",1206230400,6,1304,4.183266932270916
8194063,3,B000Q36UGY,"The wave DVD I am looking for has swells.  Large swells that the scenery changes some and the sky has bird life and so does the sand.  The US East coast has swells but when you get near the tropics the waves just lap.

I bought both of the DVD's from Costa Rica and the sky seemed to be frozen on some of the scenes and I did not like that.  The colors were vivid.  The waves were lappers on these two DVD's. It just depends on what you are looking for in this type DVD.",1203724800,2,470,3.8541666666666665
8194064,5,B000Q36UGY,the only thing missing is the sand between my toes. i've never been to costa rica but this is about as close as you can get. this is by far the best quality dvd of its kind. my search is over. i've already ordered the sister dvd and am anxiously awaiting more releases. buy this dvd!,1179878400,4,283,4.071428571428571
8194065,5,B000Q36UGY,"I use this DVD in my reiki practice to create a soothing environment for  both  me and my clients. The quality of it is really amazing. It's so much better looking and sounding than similar DVD's I've seen on the market. The colors are great, the sound is great, the photographer must have been suspended in air to get some of the shots that he did.
This DVD and it ""sister"" DVD would be a great gift for yourself or others. I highly recommend it.",1179792000,3,447,4.247058823529412
