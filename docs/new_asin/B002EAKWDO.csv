8366998,5,B002EAKWDO,"Excellent 4 disc set of Chaplin's early films at Keystone studios, painstakingly remastered using the best surviving elements. The content of this set is identical to the more expensive set released in North America by Flicker Alley. If you do buy this PAL version you will save about 75% vs the NTSC set, but will need a region free player to watch it here. Chaplin was a genius and this is a great deal!",1491696000,,405,4.486486486486487

8367000,4,B002EAKWDO,"As silent-film buffs eagerly await Flicker Alley's ""Chaplin at Keystone"" DVD set, this out-of-print Kino video provides the best showcase of the Little Tramp's yearlong tenure with Mack Sennett's Fun Factory. Running nearly an hour, ""Charlie Chaplin at Keystone Studios"" features good transfers of five embryonic shorts from 1914: ""Making a Living"" (the comedian's villainous film debut), ""Caught in a Cabaret,"" ""Mabel's Busy Day,"" ""The Masquerader"" and ""The Rounders"" (a memorable teaming with Fatty Arbuckle). The knockabout slapstick and hints of pathos in these rough-edged Keystone exercises would lead to greater artistic glories at Essanay and Mutual. Recommended viewing for any admirer of early cinema.",1279670400,,711,5.780952380952381
8367001,4,B002EAKWDO,"Mack Sennett's KEYSTONE studios were Charlie Chaplin's first cinematic home. He began to define the famous ""Little Tramp"" character with his second Sennett short. Although the Keystone brand of rapid fire slapstick and tight shooting schedules were points of contention for Charlie (as was being subordinate to Mabel Normand), he still managed to appear in 35 movies in 1914 (including the first feature-length comedy), making artistic progress with each and every one. Chaplin also wrote and directed many of these.

KINO's ""Charlie Chaplin at Keystone Studios"" consists of five short films.
Tape is recorded in SP mode and transfers are quite good. (Not available on DVD.)

CONTENTS--
MAKING A LIVING--  His screen debut as a trickful ""dandy"" beggar. After taking a newspaper job, the Swindler sees a car go over a cliff. He grabs a rival's camera and presents the photo in it as his own. He's then pursued by the angry fotog.

CAUGHT IN A CABARET--  Charlie the waiter rescues Mabel from a thug and is invited to dinner at her parents' home. The card he presents misidentifies Charlie as a Greek Ambassador. Mabel's jealous boyfriend follows him back to the restaurant, learns the truth and plans to expose her hero as a fraud.

MABEL'S BUSY DAY--  Chaplin as one of his music hall characters, the Tipsy Nuisance. Brief comedy showcases many early Keystone heavyweights, including Sennett himself.

THE MASQUERADER--  After getting kicked off a movie set for his bad acting, Charlie returns in full drag. Although the director likes ""her,"" Chaplin still doesn't end up in the film.

THE ROUNDERS--  Two drunken sophisticates go off on a toot together. They disrupt a dinner crowd and end up passed out in a slowly sinking rowboat.
