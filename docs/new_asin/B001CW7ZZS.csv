3520334,5,B001CW7ZZS,"Have waited a long time for ""Holiday Affair"" to come out on dvd!!! ""Blossoms in the Dust"" though not a holiday movie is another favorite tear jerker.  ""It happened on 5th Ave""  was a nice surprise; watched it w/my older son & we both liked it alot. ""All Mine to Give"" was ok..a little on the depressing side. All & all; being an old movie buff; I highly recommend the collection.",1230076800,,379,4.323943661971831
3520335,5,B001CW7ZZS,I have been trying to find All Mine To Give for years in either VHS or DVD.  It is a great Christmas movie to cry with at some point in the Season when you have a pity party moment.,1229212800,,181,3.641025641025641
3520336,1,B001CW7ZZS,"SPOILER ALERT!!! Don't get me wrong; I love Blossoms in the Dust! But to include this in a holiday collection is absurd. The only holiday reference in the movie is when Greer and Walter's kid gets killed on Christmas day. Also, in All Mine to Give (a truly sappy movie), a kid gives away his brothers and sisters on Christmas Day since they're all recently orphaned; their mother having died on Christmas Eve. Talk about your feel good, holiday movie! LOL. Somebody at Warner Bros. has a sick sense of humor....or is just plain stupid!",1219104000,22,535,4.6421052631578945
3520337,5,B001CW7ZZS,"Of the four films in this collection, only ""Blossoms in the Dust"" will not be available as a single DVD. The following is the press release.

All Mine To Give (1957)
A touching drama, All Mine To Give tells the sad story of six pioneer children who struggle to stay together on Christmas Day following the deaths of their parents. It stars Patty McCormack and Glynnis Johns along with Ellen Corby. This is perhaps one of the saddest movies I've ever seen, and I can remember the first time I saw it 40 years ago when I was 10.

Holiday Affair (1949)
This classic Christmas romantic comedy stars Janet Leigh as a poor young widow torn between a boring successful businessman and a romantic ne'er-do-well. Robert Mitchum and Wendell Corey co-star. I'm sure you can figure out which actor plays which man. This movie is very mature and realistic. Nobody is all bad or all good in this film.

It Happened on 5th Avenue (1947)
This screwball comedy is about a hobo and friends who move into a mansion while the owners are out of town for their Christmas holiday. The film was directed by Roy Del Ruth and stars Don DeFore and Ann Harding.

Blossoms in the Dust (1941)
Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon star in this true story of Edna Gladney, a woman who devoted her life to finding homes for unwanted infants. Felix Bressart co-stars. Directed by Mervyn LeRoy. This film is good, but doesn't tell anywhere close to the true story of Edna Gladney. She didn't need all of the family melodrama portrayed in the film to motivate her, and she was a real force in the care of children in Fort Worth,Tx. throughout her life.",1217030400,44,1611,4.544827586206897
8290154,3,B001CW7ZZS,Can't say first hand on this item as it was a gift. It was exactly the thing they wanted. No complaints or issues known.,1428364800,,120,4.041666666666667
8290155,5,B001CW7ZZS,"I can't even remember how many times I have watched, All Mine to Give.  It is such a lovely love story and oh so tragic.  Great acting.

Blossoms in the Dust is another great classic with great story line and tells of the ups and downs in peoples lives and how they manage to live through it.  A good bio of the lady Greer Garson portrayed.

It happened on 5th. Ave was a delightful comedy and shows the goodest of most folks hearts.  A great Christmas story.

Holiday affair gave us a new and different character for Mitchum and he played it to the hilt.  Very cute story line.  A feel good movie.  The young boy in the story was very cute and believable.",1313280000,,656,4.217741935483871
8290156,5,B001CW7ZZS,"I purchased this for my mother this past Christmas as she had been avidly seeking the DVD ""Blossoms in the Dust"" and to my delight I found this set of not one but FOUR DVD classics for the price of one!  Extremely fast shipping and wonderful, classic movies... a must have!!",1297296000,,274,4.372549019607843
8290157,2,B001CW7ZZS,"My wife was very disappointed with this purchase, because the title ""It Happened on 5th Avenue"" is advertised as Color, even on the case, but the dvd is actually in Black & White. The return policy requires that the item be in its original plastic wrap, but by the time my wife discovered the movie to not be as advertised, she had already opened three of the cases.  I guess we're stuck with someone's mistake, but we won't make this mistake again on Amazon. This is the first time we have been disappointed with an Amazon purchase.",1296518400,2,533,4.494845360824742
8290158,5,B001CW7ZZS,Blossoms in the Dust is ome of my all time favorites. And It happened on 5th Avenue is alot of fun.,1294617600,,99,3.761904761904762
8290159,5,B001CW7ZZS,"The movies wasn't for me, I bought them for my sister. All I can say is, she loves them. I know because she tells me evertime I see her.

Thanks!",1292544000,,145,3.8333333333333335
8290160,5,B001CW7ZZS,"I love Christmas movies! I watch them year round and have been looking for some new ones to add to my collection. I have been wanting to get Holiday Affair, which I love, for a while, and since I already owned W.B. Vol 1, I thought I would give these other movies a try.
I didn't think I had seen All Mine To Give until I put it in and realized I had seen the end on TV last year, but didn't catch the name and had wondered what it was. Although sad, the movie is also sweet at times. And I was glad to finally see the beginning.
And speaking of sad, another movie to watch with a box of tissues is Blossoms in the Dust, which I really enjoyed! I have thought of purchasing this set for my mother for Christmas, just so she can watch this movie, which is somewhat based on the true story of the main character.
And then there was It Happened on 5th Avenue, which I watched last, with somewhat low expectations, which also turned out to be a very charming Christmas movie. And no tissues required.
I was very pleased with this collection and would recommend it to anyone looking for more Christmas Classics to add to their collection. Some have complained that both All mine to give and Blossoms in the Dust, are not really Christmas movies, but just have scenes that happen at Christmas, but I feel it has the Christmas spirit, so to speak. However, I'm one of those people that consider Die Hard a Christmas movie, so maybe others will still disagree with me, but I feel all deserve the genre of Christmas movie.",1289433600,,1513,4.293706293706293
8290161,4,B001CW7ZZS,"The degree to which these movies are ""Christmas-y"" are very mixed, beforewarned.  The drama 'Holiday Affair' with Rober Mitchum and Janet Leigh being the most (though one feels sorry for the Wendell Corey character who loses his long-time love).  ""It Happened On 5th Avenue' is a light classic comedy set against the post-WWII era and ends with a Christmas scene which shows that 'family' should not just be limited to one's biological family... include any and all folks who might be alone that day!  ""All Mine to Give"" has to be the saddest and most bittersweet holiday movie ever made - It's a wonderful film, believe me, esp. if you are in a particularly 'blue Christmas' mood and feel the need to shed a few tears!  It is definitely NOT the movie to show with small kids present, who I think would be quite upset after viewing it, since it is about children who are made orphans right before Christmas.  My least favorite movie was ""Blossoms in the Dust""... it's not a bad movie, though not particularly great either, and strikes me as bit of filler material for this collection.",1265760000,,1084,4.684210526315789

I wish people would review the actual product and not the movies! It's bothersome to wade through the many wanna-be movie reviewers to get to any information about the product, which is what we're here to purchase! One can get competent movie reviews elsewhere.

Each DVD comes in a keepcase, and the covers contain classic or original poster artwork. However, if you are a fan of Vol 1, don't expect the same here! The DVD presentations of these movies is extremely minimal. There are NO extra materials, no direct scene access, just play the movie or setup languages (subtitles). While the movies themselves have chapter stops, you can't even get to a specific chapter from the menus.

Vol 1 had fantastic presentations, with extra materials, period shorts and cartoons, and trailers. If you're expecting the same for Vol 2, you'll be disappointed. However, if you're a fan of classic movies and specifically these movies, you will find a few hours of enjoyment here.",1254268800,16,1351,6.06282722513089
8290163,5,B001CW7ZZS,"I love the movies from the 30's and 40's; I really only ordered this because I wanted Blossom's in the Dust, and because I had seen and enjoyed the original Holiday Affair (I like the recent version with David James and Cynthia Gibb as well); But I enjoy all the movies, and found that ""It Happened on 5th Ave"" is a wonderful movie, and one that I will enjoy over and over!!! As far as the ""Holiday"" collection - if there is a meaning or message, I don't wait for the holidays to enjoy them, I watch them all year round!
