8163244,1,B000LPS4DO,"This is just a terrible movie. The acting is horrible and there is no story line at all. The actors, as part of the movie, just keep saying ""the toe tags are missing"". Big deal like that statement is suppose to be scarey. Try some other B movie in the horror genre. Don't even rent this one!!!!",1203552000,6,294,4.175438596491228
