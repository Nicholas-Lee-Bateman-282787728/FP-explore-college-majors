2886917,5,B000SM6FJA,"I love this workout and can't wait to try the other DVDs in this series. It is a carto-strength training-yoga-pilates fusion, but no sun-salutes here, yeah! The instructor (Tanja Djelevic ) is not too chatty, but motivates to get you going. The music really is not disco, it is modern, upbeat, and wonderful. The setting is beautiful in the mountains of Utah. You get 50, 30, and 10 min workouts. In the 50, she'll start you with a fun warm-up; move on to challenging cardio, then weighted movements (with or without weights), pilates abs, and yoga/stretch cool down. The moves are easy to learn and perfectly paced. I'm not much of a pilates fan, but her moves were fun and just my speed. I have been looking for a challenging workout like this and I was in a sweat as time flew by. Tanja makes it so fun.

If you want good results, definitely get this DVD. I have also tried her new balance ball DVD and you can read my review...it's great too! I can't wait to try the other DVD's in this new series from Gaiam and will post reviews soon.",1194652800,39,1040,4.38860103626943
2886918,5,B000SM6FJA,"This is a fun and challenging ball workout. It is perfect level of aerobic activity and stretching. The instructor, Tanja Djelevic, is very motivating, but not over chatty. It is very easy to follow and was neither too simple nor difficult. I definitely broke out in a sweat! This is the perfect ball workout and I think one of best DVD choices out there! (I have tried just about all of them available.) I love the scenery and the music is very upbeat. If you do this workout on a regular basis you're sure to make improvements to your physical body and emotional well being.

You get 3 workouts: 50, 30, and 10 min, so it's nice to have that choice too!",1194652800,50,655,4.368852459016393
2886919,5,B000SM6FJA,"The music is what I'd call classic aerobics music--synthesized and not really my favorite--but the setting is outdoors, and the purpose of the exercise tape is to enjoy being embodied and healthy. Yoga steps are blended into aerobic and strength-building exercises, although I would say there is more pilates and aerobics than yoga. Tanja Djelevic has a smiling, vibrant personality that encourages you to have fun and work hard. I plan on buying more of her DVDs soon.",1193961600,20,469,5.0256410256410255
2886920,5,B000SM6FJA,The 50 minute workout has a lot of cardio and has toning excercises as well. I don't usually gravitate toward excercise videos but this video makes working out with the balance ball fun.,1192579200,21,186,4.666666666666667
2886929,5,B000SM6FJA,For low impact exercise that gives you a good work out buy this product.,1487289600,,72,4.214285714285714
2886930,3,B000SM6FJA,"I had such high hopes for this DVD, but I was very disappointed.  I tried the 30 minute express workout twice and both times I couldn't finish due to the stress and strain on my lower back.  If you have lower back issues do not buy this DVD",1486857600,,240,3.9791666666666665
2886931,5,B000SM6FJA,it keeps you moving so lives up to its name...but not really many new moves from her prior dvds,1480809600,,95,4.052631578947368

2886934,5,B000SM6FJA,Just my speed. I am a beginner. No fancy & complicated moves to confuse u. All u have to do is concentrate on having a great form & ur workout. I could only do 13 mins of the 30min part of the video and I felt every muscle the next day. Like I said I am a beginner. Lol,1474934400,,269,3.5762711864406778

2886952,5,B000SM6FJA,"It really does work if you are consistent. I also like Tanja teaching style, her voice unlike other aerobic instructors is not annoying or overly hyper or aggressive, she's just cool and calm, and refreshing.",1464307200,,208,4.9714285714285715
2886953,5,B000SM6FJA,"This work out was better than I expected, and I can really feel my core getting stronger.",1462406400,,89,4.294117647058823
2886954,5,B000SM6FJA,"Great instruction, easy to follow and perfect for my morning work out routine",1461715200,,77,5.0
2886955,3,B000SM6FJA,"Tanja is a wonderful instructor.  My issue with this DVD is that the background music is so loud, I have difficulty hearing her instructions.  That makes it extremely difficult for me to perform the exercises without stopping to look at the TV since I can't hear her verbal cues.  This would have been a great DVD for me if it wasn't for the loud music.  I'm really disappointed...I would have enjoyed the workouts.",1460764800,,415,4.6438356164383565
2886956,5,B000SM6FJA,"great workout, nice scenery",1460246400,,27,6.0
2886957,5,B000SM6FJA,This a tough workout but very effective and works your whole body. I recommend any of Tanja Djelevic's workouts especially the balance ball core cross train and the balance ball cardio burn.,1456012800,,190,4.96875
2886958,5,B000SM6FJA,This is tough but the results are worth it.,1448496000,,43,3.888888888888889
2886969,4,B000SM6FJA,A good workout. I was surprised how much I was sweating and how many calories my fitness tracker showed I burned! She goes a little too fast though so you'll need to be coordinated enough to keep up (which is probably why I was sweating a lot).,1447804800,,244,4.212765957446808
2886970,3,B000SM6FJA,"It's not a bad workout but Tanja's instructions are very poor.  Her comments on a new movement are made often after she starts the new action, and her instructions are incomplete with little or no indication of correct body position or breathing. Even with some of the standing movements, I had to keep on stopping to look at her body position and figure out what I was meant to be doing. I'm not an inexperienced exerciser - have enjoyed both pilates and yoga for years, but I found the lack of clear instruction really annoying. It ruined the flow.  I may keep it and try it again, but I doubt this will become a favorite.",1447027200,,624,4.417391304347826
2886971,5,B000SM6FJA,Really like it,1446508800,,14,4.0
2886972,5,B000SM6FJA,"This is a really good DVD.  One 30 minute workout and another one of 50 minutes.  The music is great and the scenery is just breathtaking.  I wish Gaiam would still produce DVDs like this one, filmed outdoors, instead of just providing digital subscriptions on their website.  Both workouts are total body, and you have the option to use weights or not.  Tanja recommends starting with the 30 min and progressing to the 50 min one, if you are not very fit.  I would not say this is for beginners, but more intermediate level.",1444348800,2,525,4.531914893617022
2886973,5,B000SM6FJA,Very happy with my purchase.,1437868800,,28,4.8
2886974,5,B000SM6FJA,Tanja does a great job of instructing you as you move through the workout. She is very encouraging and makes it easy to follow along. This DVD will make you sweat!,1432684800,,163,4.290322580645161
2886975,4,B000SM6FJA,"I enjoyed this dvd. I never used a balance ball before. I found it very easy to follow and I still felt like I got a good workout, especially my abs! I try to use it 3 times a week. I've noticed it's making a difference. I would definitely recommend this to others who are looking for a really good workout.",1432425600,2,307,4.049180327868853
2886976,5,B000SM6FJA,Nice workout. The pace on some of the moves is pretty quick but the disc is labeled as a cardio workout. The location for the filming is beautiful.,1431734400,2,147,4.285714285714286
2886977,4,B000SM6FJA,"I liked it but being 52 it's not the pace i'm looking for anymore (too fast). It is a great product, but not for my age and fitness level, because I'm trying to transition to low impact, pilates and yoga.",1430697600,,204,4.125
2886978,5,B000SM6FJA,"Love this video. Lots of great stretching, strengthening and cardio work while mostly low impact. The scenery is breathtaking. The instructor has a great attitude, very likeable and makes fitness fun. She does a lot more reaching and interesting arm movements compared with other fitness DVDs to give your arms as well as your legs a workout. It was challenging enough to give a good workout without leaving me gasping for air. There is a lot of variety you can mix and match, if for instance, you prefer a mostly standing routine.",1429056000,,531,4.782608695652174
2886989,4,B000SM6FJA,"It's a little tough on the knees, but still a good workout.",1428105600,,59,4.0
2886990,5,B000SM6FJA,"I have a neurological disease that affects my balance and mobility, which makes aerobic exercise very difficult. This DVD is fun and interesting. The ball helps my balance so I can do most of the exercises. There are a few exercises done while standing that I'm unable to do, but there enough using the ball to stabilize myself that I finally feel like I am getting a decent workout. I wish there were more exercise videos geared for people with disabilities who are able to do more than just seated exercises.",1424995200,,510,4.615384615384615
2886991,5,B000SM6FJA,I really enjoy this workout. Works up a sweat and the next day...you know you did a workout. Easy to follow. Very happy with this purchase.,1423526400,,139,4.384615384615385
2886992,2,B000SM6FJA,I did this for a few times and got bored.  Not for me.,1421366400,,54,3.1538461538461537
2886993,5,B000SM6FJA,"There are two things that I didn't like about this workout but that doesn't have anything to do with with the quality of the workout. First she does a lot of standing exercises while holding the balance ball (i.e. lunges and bending with the ball to touch the floor) and when I hold the ball while standing I kind of have to bend at the waist a little. After a while this makes my back hurt. This is not really a problem because I can modify this, I don't have to hold the ball, I can use a small weight or a smaller ball. Secondly, the format of this exercise video is to do a series of exercises, then she repeats them, then she does another series of exercises and repeats them. There is nothing wrong with this format I am just not a fan of these workouts and I tend to avoid them. Overall, this is a good quality workout and the instructor is very good. It didn't seem too difficult or too easy. I would recommend it, but I probably would not purchase this DVD again.",1420761600,2,972,4.175531914893617

2886998,5,B000SM6FJA,This workout video gets your heart rate up! Tanja is not annoying (as many workout video girls/guys can be) and the setting is beautiful.  This is one of my favorite videos.,1396569600,,173,4.580645161290323
2887009,4,B000SM6FJA,This video is great and very motivating. I have done the 30 minute (shorter) workout from this DVD several times. It is a great workout and goes by so fast too. The main lady in the work out motivates you and keeps you going.,1396051200,,225,4.136363636363637

2887011,5,B000SM6FJA,"This is a fantastic all over body workout. I just love Tanja's positive attitude and encouragement. She's not overly giddy, but simple, positive and makes you want to work. My only problem is I have all of her videos and want more. My other favorite is her ball workout. Great job!",1390608000,,281,4.529411764705882
2887012,4,B000SM6FJA,"I thought this was going to be an extreme cardio ball tape but its more. It comes with 2 sessions, full session and express. The express had me sweating and sore without all the movement because it is mostly Yoga and Pilates moves and exercises and the main session is cardio mix. To me it like 2 for 1. Great deal and good tape!",1390348800,3,329,4.15625
2887013,5,B000SM6FJA,"This is a challenging and effective video. Tanja does a great job of describing the moves. It is fun, energizing, and well paced.

2887014,5,B000SM6FJA,"Great and challenging workout.  Showed me different routines to use my balance ball with.  My balance ball has been not used much, lately and this refreshed my interest in it. I would like to add I workout regularly and this workout was a challenge for me.",1382659200,,256,4.543478260869565
2887015,5,B000SM6FJA,"Seems like a risky gift to get your wife but, I swear, this is what she wanted. She loves Tanja. My wife curses her while she's working out but says Tanja is fun and motivating so she keeps moving and working hard.",1380931200,,214,4.119047619047619
2887016,5,B000SM6FJA,"I bought my wife this and Tanja Djelevic's ""Cardio Burn Sculpt"" video. Seems like a risky gift to get your wife but, I swear, this is what she wanted. She loves Tanja.

2887017,5,B000SM6FJA,"I love this video... it is great for cadio and core strengthening, really pushing you but not too extreme that you can't keep up.  Tanja is fun and she makes you feel like you are right there exercising with her.  I do the quick workout and the longer one, depending on the amount of time I have.... both make me feel like I accomplished a great workout.  I have a few DVD's from Tanja, but this is my favorite.",1376611200,,411,4.177215189873418

2887030,5,B000SM6FJA,I have a couple of these videos and really like them so I was happy to see that there were a couple more of them available.  I was not disappointed this one is good too!,1372464000,,169,3.8285714285714287

2887032,5,B000SM6FJA,"I bought this DVD because I was looking for a new workout DVD that I could do that wasn't too intense, because I'm out of shape and lunges/squats hurt my knees.  I like intense though, but I just want to start slow.  I did this workout for the first time two days ago, and again today.  No feelings of injury (well my right bicep felt a bit pulled the first and second day, but I iced it and it feels better today).  The first day I did it, later that day I was sore in areas that I didn't even know that I worked!  I was sore from my calves, to my forearms, and my upper back, but that good muscle soreness.  The only thing that wasn't sore was my abs and low back.  So it's a great all over body workout.  I didn't even realize I was working that hard - I sweated, and moved, but I never felt like I was over-doing it.  So it was good.  Plus I really like the instructor, the camera focuses on her and not the stand-ins, she is smiley and kind of goofy, and the scenery is beautiful.  I really recommend this DVD for beginners.  Seasoned exercisers can probably still use it, add weights, and have it be maybe a easier day workout.  But you will work muscles that you probably are not working in your normal workouts, the common ones like running, elliptical, and common workout DVD's.  So this is a good cross train DVD for people who workout and are in shape.",1372204800,,1363,4.152671755725191
2887033,5,B000SM6FJA,"Really gets the blood pumping and strengthens the rest. Contains exercises not in my original DVD, adding to my fitness repertoire.",1368489600,,131,5.285714285714286
2887034,5,B000SM6FJA,"I really like working with my body ball...it's effortless. This product is geared for those with good muscle tone, flexibility and for those familiar with working out on the ball.",1367971200,,179,5.0
2887035,1,B000SM6FJA,"I have used exercise videos/CDs for years, and this is by far the worst I have encounter. The Balance Ball is an awesome piece of excercise equipment, but this routine uses it mostly to hold or slide around to stretch while you do squats and lunges again and again.  Very little meaningful use of the ball.  When the instructor finally attempts to demonstrate the Pilates 100, she flaps her arms like she is trying to take off.

Can I get my money back?",1366675200,6,453,4.433734939759036

2887050,5,B000SM6FJA,I loved this workout DVD. There's a 20 minute workout that I really like. It's not a die hard workout and she gives you lots of options for easier things if you're a beginner.,1362528000,,175,4.176470588235294
2887051,5,B000SM6FJA,"In my opinion, this one along with the 10 minute Solutions DVD is a great full week of workouts that give you so many variations so as not to become bored with it all. This trainer is easy to listen to and follow along with. It's fun and really targets troubled spots. You can choose the shorter version workout if your in a hurry or the extended version.

2887057,3,B000SM6FJA,"This video seems to be a good video that includes cardio along with toning.  I was actually looking for a video that pinpointed Abs.  I did find a good video for Abs, so will probably use both videos.  I already have a good cardio routine, so the Ab video will probably get more use.  It is shorter also.",1351814400,,304,4.189655172413793

2887069,4,B000SM6FJA,I work out at a gym during the week so I am always looking to do something different on the weekends and this is it. It's about an hour and also has a couple of shorter workouts. The workout goes at a good pace and the scenery is beautiful. It's worth buying.,1330214400,,259,4.0
2887070,4,B000SM6FJA,"I am a runner and bicyclist who recently developed planar fascitis.  I needed some good ideas for keeping fit in a less-stressing way to my joints and muscles.  I borrowed this DVD from my local library and I was hooked, so I bought it.  The exercises are targeted and effective, but they don't feel exceedingly difficult.  And there is not so much repetition that the video gets old.  Tanya demonstrates a lot of low impact alternatives and gives you suggestions to increase intensity.  She's pretty entertaining and distracts you pretty well during the harder moments.  I love all the yoga that's integrated as well.  I feel that she takes time to stretch parts of the knee that many videos ignore.  And the balance portions are great.  The ab work integrates a lot of pilates, which I love.  This is a great workout that masks as a nice, relaxing yoga and pilates-based session.  I have added weights to the upper body portion and I am already feeling good results.  And the setting is gorgeous.  You won't regret buying this DVD.",1326585600,10,1033,4.698324022346369
2887071,5,B000SM6FJA,"I'm new to exercise but not to life and I find Tanja's approach really good. This program is very good because it combines upper, lower body and core with stretching. I'm still far from completing the long workout but you can feel how you get better every time. I tried some other videos before and I have to say Tanja managed to create a workout that is not boring. I have also her Balanceball video and mix them. The other great thing about this video, and the Balanceball as well, is you have options for your workout, it's not a single routine. You have the express and the long versions and thus you'll go back to the DVD over and over. Most DVD's have a single maybe 30 to 45 min routine and that's it. This one to me is money well expend: fun, progressive, easy to follow, Tanja is very nice (not bossy or yelling, and keeps you smiling), and great for starters. I can see how the routine might feel easy-moderate for someone in good condition but you can always scale it up with weights or slight position changes. If you are one of those having a hard time starting in working out, like myself, I'd strongly recommend to try Tanja's.",1317427200,4,1142,4.366197183098592
2887072,4,B000SM6FJA,"This is a great workout for beginners who want to work their way up to a more advanced level of exercising, and intermediate exercisers like me who don't always want to use weights.  The portion of the workout in which you can add weights feels a little silly w/out them, but I'm sure there's still some good toning happening.  The only thing I don't like is the ""yoga stretch""/cool down in the longer workout, b/c it doesn't feel like a cool down.  I'm sure some enthusiastic yogis feel that holding downward dog and one-legged dog is relaxing, but after a 50-minute workout I'd prefer to sit on the floor (or just stand) and stretch.  Tanja is a great, fun instructor.",1315785600,,670,4.558333333333334

2887076,3,B000SM6FJA,"This is my first Tanja Djelevic DVD. She's pleasant and gives great form tips (e.g. when you are kicking, instead of throwing your leg out think of pushing through your heel) and the Sundance, Utah background is beautiful. As with all Gaiam videos, the production is excellent. This is a fusion workout combining yoga, pilates, and basic cardio moves (lunges, squats, plies, front and rear kicks.)

The main thing that I didn't like about this DVD is the left/right cuing is not mirrored. If this is being billed as a beginner workout, it's unthinkable that the instructor wouldn't give mirror cues. This is particularly egregious during the (long) warmup that features some yoga stretches where you cannot see the TV. I have a real issue with workout DVD's in general that don't mirror cue when even the instructors at my local gym can do it. For me, this automatically lowers the rating.

Otherwise, the cardio is basic but held my attention. She mentions plyometrics in the warmup but it's all just high impact added to pulsing lunges and squats so it's nothing that can't readily be modified to low if need be. The standing toning segment will be far too easy for anyone who isn't a novice or injured. Plan on using your intermediate weights at least. But the abs segment that follows was fairly lengthy and difficult (lots of pilates moves like the criss cross and single leg stretch) so I'm not positive who this DVD is aimed at. I did like it but I probably won't use it that often.

There are 30 and 50 minute versions of the workout available plus a bonus 10 minute standing core segment in the Bonus Materials. I've only done the 50 minute workout thus far.",1305849600,,1667,4.663265306122449

30 minutes into this workout, I checked my calorie count because I knew I had not broken a sweat or done any heavy breathing and discovered 150 whole calories torched.  I fast forwarded through the rest (which was upper body push up work and some ab/glut work) and decided I did not miss much calorie burning time by skipping on to another workout DVD that would actually get my heart rate up.

The ball, you and the movements are not meant for small spaces.  The instructor is not annoying (unless you get annoyed by her svelt figure like I do!)and the scenery is nice to look at.  Music is nothing special either, but it's also not annoying - which is a plus in my book.  I recommend!",1297987200,3,557,4.0181818181818185

I am proud to say that I have lost 20 lbs and am closing in on my goal and I still have 3 months to go.  A huge help in taking off this weight was due to this DVD.  I went straight into the 50 minute workout and struggled at first but within just a couple of weeks I could start to see changes in my body.  I alternate this DVD with Jillian Michaels ""No More Trouble Zones"" and my body is starting to look slimmer and more defined.  I cut my food portion sizes in half and have done no pills or fads, just the DVD workouts.  My metabolism is coming back thanks to the muscle tone.

This exercise is not for the advanced exerciser, I barely worked up a sweat, that said this is the first I've heard of her and I liked her voice, and her approach. jillian et al screaming is not my style, and i loved the yoga.

2887095,5,B000SM6FJA,"This is a fun exercise DVD that lets you do more or less, depending on what you're up for. I appreciate how the exercises can be more challenging if you're willing to put more into them. For instance, she demonstrates push-ups on knees (no thanks), which can easily be changed to regular push-ups (yes!). The squats are made more challenging by going deeper into the sit, just as the front/back kicks are harder if you do them for real (I trained in competitive kickboxing for a number of years). Same with the sit-ups. Keep your head up throughout them and voila! More of a workout.

Yes, of course, if you want a serious cardio workout this is not the DVD for you. Is there such a thing as a DVD with serious cardio? I don't think so. But this DVD offers a great mix of exercises and can leave you sweaty and sore if you're willing to push yourself.

This is the first balance ball workout that I have found that successfully merges a cardio routine with the more standard balanceball toning moves.

There are two options - a 30 minute & 50 minute workout. While the 30 minute routine is great for days when you're short on time, the 50 minute is awesome & really gets you sweating! I was surprised at how much cardio Tanja gets in with the ball - especially working on your abs/obliques.  I love how the cardio bursts are interspersed with toning moves, which you can make more challenging by adding weights.

So I was surprised to find a dvd that incorporates the ball into both strength training and cardio exercises.  I thought it was challenging, but not exhausting, and I definitely felt the soreness in my legs the next day.  Also, I have lower back problems and this workout really tends to focus on strengthening these muscles without causing any pain (so long as you're careful not to overdo it!)

My only complaint is that the cardio segments are a bit repetitive.  Still better than jogging or using a machine, but I wish she had come up with some different movements to make the time go by a little faster.

The toning segments touch on most major muscle groups.  The problem is that the workout is too easy for me.  It is a mix of very short cardio intervals, toning, & stretching.  The problem is that the cardio is too interrupted for true cardio benefits.  I definitely am not even approaching my target heart rate, much less for the recommended 20-30 minute minimum.  I don't even break a sweat.  That said. This would be a great starter workout for a young to middle aged sedentary person just starting to exercise.

The setting is beautiful, Tanja is easy-going and natural and the workout targets your whole body without requiring huge energy outputs.  If you're not up to doing a tough cardio some days, this DVD will keep you toned and flexible.  You'll still sweat and feel challenged but none of it feels like it's hard on you or over the top.  Tanja has a 50 minute workout and a 30-minute express workout as well as a bonus ab workout on this DVD.  You'll feel great after doing this as almost every move targets the core, helping with posture and strength.  I highly recommend this DVD as the movements are very loose and flowing although there are two sets of more explosive jumps.  Her stretching section at the end is very slow and relaxed.

I've only done the 30 minute section of this tape and while I did break a sweat....it is more for beginners.  Not someone who exercises regularly.  I'm used to doing ball exercises with weights (Tracy Mallet's) and doing Tanja's arm exercises without any weights didn't appear to do a thing for me.

Instead its a toning, strengthening, sculpting, stretching workout whch moves quickly from one exercise to another, with few pauses. The pauses came between the blocks of workouts. The workout keeps going. There are moves from yoga, pilates, and kickboxing, and also gym workout types like squats. Its a great combination. It's quite challenging from start to end. A lot of the exercises at the end are done in plank position. I really like this workout. Some of the exercises also also explained with modifications so you can notch up as you get stronger. The exercises also focus on lengthening while strengthening. The choreography alternates between sculpting/ strengthening and stretching.

The instructor has a unique style, and she's encouraging and friendly. She gives helpful reminders and pointers as she goes along.

I like this because it works my muscles. I am looking to strengthen my muscles. Yet, it also incoporates stretches helping me to maintain my flexibility. I like this combination of strength and flexibility, in an alternating fashion. Rather than leaving all the stretching to the end as a cool-down, the workout incorporates stretches and some of the exercises are strengthening and stretching all at once!

2887155,4,B000SM6FJA,"I really enjoy this video.  Tanja is one of the most pleasant exercise video instructors I've ever come across.  She's motivating and funny in a good way (like when she says during ab work, ""Some people have a three-pack... that's okay).  The music in this video is both soothing and invigorating.  There are a lot of yoga-based moves throughout the workout and a good amount of core work.  The scenery is beautiful.  I also recognized the cast members (Deazie Gibson and Teri-Ann Krefting) from other workout videos.

I got this workout when I was just venturing into exercise DVDs in early 2008 and I really enjoyed it.  However, the title is a bit misleading.  In the full 50 minute workout, there's really only about 15 minutes of cardio (near the beginning).  The rest of the workout is good, but it is more light-weight muscle toning work and definitely not cardio.

This is not a very high calorie-burner.  The last time I did it a few weeks ago, I burned 194 calories in 50 minutes (I typically burn about 350 calories per hour in most other moderately intense cardio exercises).  However, it is a nice well-rounded workout for somebody who's just starting out (especially because it has the shorter 30 minute option) or someone looking for an easy workout for a recovery day.

I don't do this video very often anymore because I'm usually looking for a higher calorie burn, but I can't help but pick it up from time to time because I really enjoy Tanja as an instructor.",1242864000,,1478,4.656370656370656
2887156,5,B000SM6FJA,"I liked this workout a lot, Tania is nice, but sometimes her verbal indications lack a little, you have to watch her. In the last 10 minutes she's doing yoga stretches, and is good to take your shoes off and practice on a yoga mat, carpet is very slippery. Very good workout.",1242604800,,275,4.3076923076923075
2887157,4,B000SM6FJA,I really feel like I have gotten a great workout after doing this.  I also did the bonus abs workout after the 50 minute workout. This also has a 30 minute workout.

2887158,4,B000SM6FJA,"I just got Cardio Burn Balance Ball and have been enjoying it! Background on me--I'm overweight, and exercise on and off, so I look for workouts that are not jarring to the back or knees.

Here's what I like:
* The instructor: she's high energy without being screamy. She obviously loves what she's doing. She reminds me a bit of Jennifer Lopez. Her cues are right on, and she makes sure to say things like, ""just do what you can,"" or ""if you have lower back problems, do it like this..."" That's very reassuring and helpful info.

* It's a fun workout! Before I got this DVD, my balance ball had been collecting dust. I didn't realize how fun it is to use it...and how challenging!

* There are 2 workouts to choose from, 30 minutes and 50 minutes in length. I've been doing the 30 minute one and it's work for me to get through it.

What I thought could have been improved:
* There are 2 people behind her exercising along with her. At one point, late in the 30 minute workout, she says, ""if you're a beginner, follow the guys behind me.""  It confused me if they were serving as modifiers all along or just for that one exercise. It seemed to be just for that one exercise, b/c they were pretty much doing the same as she was all through the rest of the workout.

* The audio. I could hear her well enough, but she was a hair overshadowed by the music. When it got to the stretching portion, then I was able to hear her just fine. It could be my DVD player or the DVD I got. Like I say, she's certainly audible, just had to turn the volume up one or 2 notches more than normal. No biggie.

This is a great DVD if you want to mix up your workout. I would definitely buy another DVD by this instructor.",1241740800,49,1701,4.1676829268292686
2887159,5,B000SM6FJA,"I've tried lots of different balance ball workouts and this one is the first one I found challenging enough for me to work up a decent sweat in 10 minutes. Love the fact that you can workout for 10, 30, or 45 minutes depending in your time and energy levels. I just found it awkward that the 10-minutue workout was hidden in the Bonus Features section.",1241395200,2,352,4.348484848484849

I am even able to get my husband to do it with me even though is he pretty out of shape - it's easy for him to tailor to his own skill level.  In addition there's a 30-minute workout to do for a few weeks before you move to the hour workout.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.",1235520000,2,480,4.053191489361702

I've been trying out different fitness videos and this one is the one I always return to. I have a rotation of videos I'm trying out, but I like to do this one at least twice a week. Tanja is very encouraging, not overly peppy, and the pacing in the video feels just right.

It has a nice balance of cardio and toning. The combo of squats and lunges are great for the legs and I can actually feel the definition in muscles in my thighs after three weeks... My butt is looking much shapelier too :) I don't think the exercises for the arms and abs push me to my limit, but I'm tired and out of breath after the FIRST set of squats and lunges and sweat drips from my forehead by the time I'm done. This is one of my favorites and I am definitely going to check out more of Tanja Djelevic's DVDs.",1235174400,,905,4.112994350282486

I finally decided that the $30 it cost to get 3 videos to workout at home was a way better deal than a $40/month gym membership. So far, so good. The setting of this video is beautiful (Utah mountains), and Tanja's instructional style is mostly not cheesy.  Tanja doesn't give exact instructions on the moves she does, but I have made a point these first few times using the video to pay attention more to the form than actually working out. And I definitely know that I am getting a workout.  I am just a beginner, who hasn't worked out in a long time, and I find the workout to be challenging (I will be using the 30 minute version for the first few weeks for sure!).",1234310400,,753,4.326241134751773
2887165,5,B000SM6FJA,"I am delighted with this Cardio/Ball DVD featuring Tanja. She is great. The long session is almost one hour long. Every part of the body is exercised and there is a lot of cardio. I used my handweights with some of it for an added boost. Great AB work and use of the ball. Some Pilates, as well.

The second part is Express. It features most of the first without the stretching in between. It's an incredible 30 minute session. Powerful.

If you only have one balance ball DVD, this is great. Any of Gaiam/Tanja DVDs are worth the price.",1234137600,,537,4.36

She also is really good about warming up and cooling down, which is extremely helpful if you're a beginner and are not sure how to do this on your own--I don't feel at all in danger of hurting myself when trying to do this workout.  I also find it to be really good cardio, and if you are careful and do the movements correctly, you can also get some good toning (at least if you are a beginner like me).  I come away from this workout feeling energized (but also like I really worked!)",1233964800,2,648,4.209677419354839

I actually look forward to starting this workout and smile throughout. Tanja is cheerful, funny, and makes the workout fun with her positive energy and jokes. This workout is intense enough to get your heart rate up and really make a difference. You feel like you accomplished something, but it isn't so complex as to be intimidating. Even though some moves may be hard to get at first (lateral lunge jump anyone?) but you know with enough practice you can get it eventually. Not only is this cardio, it's pilates, yoga, and strength training all in one. Even on the first time with or without weights you really feel like you've made a difference without having push yourself quite to the breaking point. I also like how her backup girls have more curvaceous forms. It makes it feel all the more accessible for those of us who are a little more voluptuous. And after watching the interview and hearing what Tanja has to say, I love it even more. If I could afford it, I'd hire her as my personal trainer in a second!",1233014400,,1148,4.497607655502392

I'm very impressed.  It's fast paced - but paced just right for you to keep up even as a newbie. I like that she's enthusiastic but not bubbly and annoying. I also love that she shows you how to do each move JUST enough to get it... she doesn't talk down to you, she doesn't treat you like you're dumb, and she goes fast enough that you aren't getting bored with the pausing and explaining like in some videos, after you've done it many times and know what you're doing.

I was really impressed with this workout. Most balanceball workouts I've bought are either too easy or too short and don't allow me to feel as though I got anything out of the workout. This one really delivers. I was sweating quite a bit and could feel the fatigue setting in. The instructor is nice, quiet (no obnoxious yelping or ramblings) but at the same time is encouraging and supportive without being ""syrupy."" I really liked this one and would highly recommend it.

I have had it for many months but have only done it once.  I even put it in this morning to give it another try and the preview was so boring I could not hit play. I liked the idea of cardio/toning/pilates/yoga fusion, but as I said it is a little slow.

I tried the 30-minute ""express workout"" and it was perfect- simple to learn but not boring, because Tanja gives such great cuing without being cheesy. And it's definitely a workout- I was pouring sweat by the end!
One of my favorite things about this DVD is that she keeps such a great rhythm with the music that it's easy to get back on track if you make a mistake, and you can also drop out for a couple reps on the more challenging moves and then get right back in with the rhythm.
The only minor problem I have is with the yoga-stretch cool down- she doesn't explain some of the positions very well, so if you've never done yoga before (like me), you just have to try and follow her body as best you can. But if you're familiar with yoga it would probably be easy, or you can just do your own cool-down stretches.

She's funny too and not annoying, most importantly she's motivating.  These workouts are not super advanced which I am used to but you can make them advanced by adding light weights and really concentrating on tightening your core.  These workouts are so refreshing, you'll do movements that you may not of tried before but are super effective and the one thing I noticed is that she is constantly challenging your balance and your core.  This theme is throughout all 3 of the DVD's.  The filming is excellent, no camping elevator music here.  It is instrumental music but has enough of a beat to keep you motivated.  The filming location is just absolutely breath taking.  I don't know where these were filmed but think National Geographic gorgous back drop, not your usual studio background with fake plants.

It really is a video about the workout.  The background scenery is also really pretty.

About the actual workout:  The express workout is great.  The longer workout is good too, but it starts to get too slow paced for me.  If you like pilates and other slower paced toning stuff, you'll love it all.  There are some parts in the longer workout that they do without weights in the video, but unless you are super wimpy or recovering from surgery, I would recommend having some light weights around to make those exercises seem worthwhile.

Everything about this workout is great, the instructor, the moves, the instructions, the scenery, the music, the price ... go buy it.
What I also like is that Tanja shows the toning sections without weights, but you can use weights if you want to.

The 30 minute segment is just an abbreviated version of the 50 minute one, in case you don't have the time or energy for the longer workout. Even if I feel tired, I try to start the 50 minute one - when I finish the warm-up, I feel better and I'm able to do the whole workout. The workouts are definitely challenging - my heart rate goes up and stays up until the yoga stretch, and I feel like I've worked every major muscle group. The 10 minute ab workout is good, and incorporates some stuff that you don't see in the other programs.
Tanja is joined by 2 other exercisers in the 30 and 50 minute segments, and is by herself for the ab workout. Tanja is fun and energetic - she never sounds fake or scripted, nor does she have annoying catch phrases to repeat. Overall, she is a joy, the workout is excellent, and these workouts have been my absolute favorites since the day I received the video.",1208995200,4,1381,4.3565891472868215
2887226,5,B000SM6FJA,"If you are tired of all the other cardio routines, try Tanja. She is so refreshing and her workouts are filmed outdoors. This workout is a nice 50 minutes if you do the full workout, which I think is great (all my other dvds are around 30 minutes). Tanja is inspiring and motivating, and very natural. I already own more of her dvds and I am waiting for the next one that I just ordered. Everything about this workout is great, the instructor, the moves, the instructions, the scenery, the music, the price ... go buy it.
The express workout (30 minutes) is not just a shorter version of the full workout, it's a different workout, so you get two workouts on one dvd.",1208736000,2,667,4.387096774193548
2887227,5,B000SM6FJA,"Terrific work out--keeps your heart-rate up all the time.  Great moves which target many muscles in the body.  It combines teh best of all worlds, yoga, cardio and an option for weight training for the upper body.  Background music decent enough; only gripe is that it does not have an option to turn off the background music.  But otherwise, terrific work-out routine that i highly recommend.",1208390400,3,393,4.909090909090909
2887228,5,B000SM6FJA,"I actually look forward to doing this workout (and I can't do it every day, because my muscles (every single one in my body) need to recover)! I think it has something to do with Tanja's positive, fun personality; with the variety that comes from combining aerobics, pilates moves, strength training, and yoga; and the sense of exercising outside in the sunshine in the gorgeous mountains of Utah (which is really motivating when the actual weather where I am is cold and gloomy). Definitely my favorite workout DVD, and I have a lot of them!",1207958400,,542,4.71578947368421
2887239,5,B000SM6FJA,I love this workout.  This is the first time I've used the balanceball and I like it alot.  Tanja is great!  She is not annoying - and that is so important.  I would like to see her a lot more.,1207526400,,193,3.75
2887240,5,B000SM6FJA,"In 10 minutes I was already sweating and I'm not even out of shape; I work out on daily basis (dance & yoga). This dvd is amazing if you want to burn calories, get energized and feel great. I know it sounds silly but I was giggling all the time because of all the positive energy I was getting from the workout. This is the best spent 10$.",1207353600,,339,4.0
2887241,4,B000SM6FJA,"This is a stability ball workout led by instructor Tanja Djelevic.  The DVD offers 3 workout options, a full 50.5 minute workout, a 30.5 minute Express workout (different footage but the same basic exercises), and a 9.5 minute Cardio Lower Body workout (really a short lower body strength session).

The main workout begins seated on the ball for a warm-up that is just under 7 minutes long; the warm-up includes slow squats and lunges to begin raising the heart rate.  Tanja then alternates 3 cardio segments with 3 toning segments.  Each cardio segment consists of the same series of moves--including squat, squat with side leg lift, lunge, lunge with twist and arabesque, lunge with knee lift and arabesque, and side-to-side twist--although the moves are sped up in each subsequent segment.  The first toning segment focuses on biceps, shoulders, and obliques (not using any weights, although Tanja mentions that you can use them), the second on back and chest, and the third on hamstrings and abdominals.

I enjoyed the music for this workout, which had an upbeat, pop sound to it, and I really liked the cardio segments, which incorporated the ball well and definitely raised my heart rate.  What I didn't like were the toning segments, which slowed things down too much to continue providing an aerobic benefit yet were too light to really provide any significant strength benefits.  However, I did find Tanja to be a likable instructor, and some advanced beginner/low intermediate exercisers may find that this workout provides the right mix for them.",1207008000,31,1558,5.05859375
2887242,3,B000SM6FJA,"This is a unique cardio workout incorporating Pilates moves and lots of lunges.  Tanja is a good instructor, easy to follow and she is motivating.  However, this workout incorporates a lot of moves that can put strain on the lower back - especially if you do not do them correctly.  I would recommend something else if you are prone to lower back pain or strain.",1206835200,14,362,4.538461538461538
2887243,5,B000SM6FJA,"This DVD has a 10 minute, 30 minute or 50 minute workout option. So, no matter what time you have for that day you can fit a workout in. It's got some cardio and some strength training which is great. The instructor is easy to listen to and upbeat and she moves right through the different moves so you don't get bored. I would definitely suggest this DVD to a friend.",1206748800,2,368,4.197183098591549
2887244,5,B000SM6FJA,"I don't normally write reviews but this is one purchase I'm super pleased with.  When I get a new workout video I like to watch it first so there's no surprises my first time through.  Just watching it I thought, ""There's no way someone as uncoordinated as me could follow that!""  Well surprise, I managed to make it through the whole workout first try and when I did miss a step or two it was very easy to pick back up.  Tanja's queuing is spot on and she makes the workout fun.  She is genuinely happy without a trace of that fake perkiness that turns me off so many instructors.  I also felt like the workout was really solid.  The fusion of cardio, weight traning (if you want it), and yoga is just my style.  If you're wondering whether you should get this I say go for it; you won't be disappointed.",1205625600,7,805,4.25
2887245,5,B000SM6FJA,"This workout is nearly perfect! Tanja Djelevic is a terrific guide, and she leads you through a very energetic (yet not too intense) 50 minutes of total body conditioning. The first 20 minutes are devoted to raising the heartrate, followed by toning which includes elements of Pilates as well as yoga. Being a regular practitioner of yoga, I love a cardiovascular workout that incorporates these poses. There is also an ""express"" workout of just under 30 minutes, and a bonus workout. The setting is great, Tanja's cues are terrific, and she is appealing and motivating! I just completed this dvd for the first time this a.m. and it is in my top 10 fitness dvd rotation. I highly, highly recommend it!",1204934400,4,701,4.801652892561983

I wasn't overly sore the next day, but I really got worn out during the actual workout. She switches up movement a good deal and really gets your heart rate up. Great host - charismatic and fun! After repeated tries, I got significantly better at the moves, but it is still challenging enough to be fun! I recommend it for beginners and more experienced exercisers.",1202860800,,538,4.444444444444445
2887247,5,B000SM6FJA,"I bought this based on the reviews. I was looking for something a little different than waht  I have been doing (not that I don't love my other DVD's). This is a different style workout - for me at least. I felt the instructions were good - lead ins acceptable (for moderate/experienced) - perfect pace to get your heart rate up and clean recovery periods. The name Cardio may be a bit missleading in that there is no hard arobics/dancing here! She uses Yoga, Palaties - and your own body weight to get your heart pumping - that's not to say you will not be jumping she does this at a controlled pace.

The only thing I did not see anyone mention or recomend is some basic knowledge of yoga or pallaties is needed. If both practices are not done properly you will never get the full benenifts. I did not feel the instructions were at a beginners level.",1201910400,4,852,4.352201257861635
2887248,5,B000SM6FJA,"I looove this workout. The instructor is great! I wish she had more balance ball DVDs. The only part of this that I did not enjoy was at the start of the workout where you move side to side warming up on the ball. I think this is because my ball is too soft though, because its too hard to stay on the top of the ball while doing this move. Otherwise, 5 stars!",1201824000,2,360,3.8783783783783785
2887259,5,B000SM6FJA,"My favorite thing about this is the tone.  It's simple fitness, no more no less.  There's no gimmicks, no outrageous claims, nothing.  And the instructor is AWESOME.  Very charismatic, but not cheesy at all.

The workout:  the first time, I would have given this 4 stars.  The funny thing is, like Pilates or anything that requres great control, it almost gets harder the better you do it.  Some things that I thought weren't challenging are actually VERY challenging when done correctly, and you can always make it more challenging by simply moving your body an inch or so.

I would like to see more variety in the cardio section, however.  The cardio is fine for now, but I feel like after a couple of weeks it will probably be both easy and boring.  Each of the 3 cardio sections are the same, as well.  It would be nice to have some variety in there.

But a great buy.  I pondered about giving it 4 stars because of what I say above, but given the nature of a lot of these cheesy videos, and the instructor, I think 5 stars suits it better.",1201478400,12,1044,4.369791666666667
2887260,4,B000SM6FJA,"In the past I have hated any aerobics type DVD's because the instructors always seem to be so perky I can't manage to take them seriously. However, I needed one and found this and was SHOCKED! She isn't painfully perky and it is actually a great workout and can be used from beginner to more advanced by adding weights. The music isn't too bad like in a lot of videos and it's a great way to vary your workout. For anyone who wants to try out a video and has been skeptical this is a good one. She also does a lot of core, stability exercises which is really good and is left out of a lot of videos. Good overall workout. I would strongly suggest it.",1201219200,4,650,4.125984251968504
2887261,5,B000SM6FJA,"I normally don't like Yoga based workouts, they're just not my thing.  I prefer kick boxing and lots of sweating and kicks.  However this workout I found to be a great combination and lead by one very long and lean instructor.  I chose this workout due to the reviews posted here on Amazon and have been very pleased with this purchase.  Everything everyone has written if very true.  I find I get a great cardio workout from this and have an overall great feeling of strength when complete.  I found the moves to be doable and enjoyable.  I think the setting is very scenic and a nice change of pace from the hum drum studio set you normally get.  I can only wish I looked like Tanja and had those amazing long limbs.  The workout leaves me refreshed and energized and feeling more flexible then I have in a long time from a workout.",1201219200,17,834,4.363636363636363
2887262,5,B000SM6FJA,"I'm an avid exercisor, but I'm new at using a stability ball. I'm also just getting back into regular exercise after having a baby four months ago. I love aerobics, but most of my aerobics DVDs are totally cardio, or mostly cardio and just a little strength training. This workout DVD is great because it offers cardio intervals that get your heart rate going while simultaneously toning muscles all over the body. The first time I did the workout I thought, ""This is hard!"" I don't mean hard to follow (it's really easy), but hard because it woke up a lot of muscles I hadn't used in a while! It's the good kind of hard that tells you you're doing something great for your body and spirit. This workout makes you feel good while doing it, and feel even better right after you finish.

The DVD has one main 50-minute workout (inclues warm-up, workout, and cool-down stretch), a 30-minute express workout, plus a 10-minute lower body cardio burn.",1200614400,10,945,4.625
2887263,5,B000SM6FJA,"I bought this DVD because I loved Tanja Djevelic's exercise ball cardio workout through Gaiam and figured I'd give the Total Body Cardio workout a shot.  I do more than break out in a sweat with this workout and feel that Djevelic is so great at motivating and inspiring the viewer.  Tanja is one of my favorite instructors because of her open and welcoming personality.  She stresses that the viewer add his/her own ""flavor"" to the workout moves and how can one not put in 160% with someone like her pushing you to give it your all?

I also love the fact that there is a condensed 30 minute version when I want to squeeze in a small segment of cardio.  Weights aren't needed, but for some of the arm exercises, I do them in for an extra challenge.  The ab section of the workout is a short one, but it is very efficient.

Give this workout a shot if you're looking for a great cardio workout with an instructor that never fails to put a smile on my face, even if I can't stand plyometric squat movements.",1198540800,4,1005,4.3138297872340425

I love using this video to mix up my regular gym work out routines and I feel my body is much firmer and toned now. Especially my butt!! Can really recommend it.",1197763200,10,463,3.9361702127659575
2887265,5,B000SM6FJA,"I decided on a whim to try this workout and can honestly say that for someone who considers herself intermediate in that I'm not new to an exercise program, I was sore for the next two days.  Given that I don't like instructors who expect me to be an expert at what exercises I'm doing, I loved how the transitions were great, and the moves were effective and not difficult to pick up on.  (Not to mention, the scenery is a gorgeous backdrop to the workout.)

Tanja Djelevic is an amazing instructor who proves that sometimes keeping things simple, exercise wise, is better than having someone jump around for the sake of raising the heartbeat.  Alternating between strength training and cardio worked well with this workout, unlike some others that I've tried recently.  She is great as an instructor and motivator, but not overly peppy to a point where she comes off as fake.

The DVD is loaded with a few extras, including an interview with Djelevic.  Also, the extra nine minute lower body cardio workout is great on days when I have to squeeze in a workout on a short amount of time.

I'm looking forward to trying more of Djelevic's workouts, and Gaiam's got a winner with this one!",1197072000,10,1188,4.597156398104265
