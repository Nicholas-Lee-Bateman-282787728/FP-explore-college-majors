8061321,5,B0009IRKLU,"This includes 2 episodes, the first,""A Dark and Stormy Night"", is a crazy adventure in which Sara, Felicity, Felix and Gus get mixed up with some jewel theives. Christopher Reeves plays a good bad guy and the lady who is his partner is good too. The storyline is a bit confusing but it is entertaining and mysterious!",1239062400,,317,4.578947368421052
