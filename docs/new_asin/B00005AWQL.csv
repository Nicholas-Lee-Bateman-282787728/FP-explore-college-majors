1419476,5,B00005AWQL,"i saw this movie on the shelf one day and read the back of the box. i love horror films -- espicially old, cheesy ones. the reason i bought this set was [except for the cheap price] for 'silent night, deadly night'. however, that film isn't on the disc. it's actually 'silent night, bloody night', and older, more psychological film.
that kind of bummed me out at first, but then i discovered some treasures! [i had already owned 'night of the living dead', house on haunted hill' and 'pieces' on dvd]. my favorite [aside from the above-mentioned classics] is 'snowbeast'. it's a made-for-tv movie from 1977 about a yeti-like monster attacking a ski resort. it stars yvette mimieux and sylvia sidney [best known from tim burton films]. yes it's horrible, but it is quite entertaining.
as for none of these movies being remastered, that's fine with me. it only adds to the charm seeing these movies when they were actually released. i already own a remastered 'night of the living dead', so seeing this one is just like seeing it on television when i was eight or nine. extreme nostalgia!
if you are a horror movie fan and not expecting too much from a movie [which you can't with any horror film], don't need much in the way of extras [there are some cast and film info for some of the movies], and you're just looking for some dumb fun, i highly recommend this collection.
i also recommend its sister sets, 'fright night' and 'tales of terror', each with 10 so-bad-they're-good horror films!",1034208000,16,1492,4.67680608365019
1419477,5,B00005AWQL,"I can't stand double sided DVDs because, they get scratched up so easy! I just don't let my friends borrow this because, I want to make sure that it stays in good condition. I do occasionally bring it to my friends house so that we can watch this what I like to call box set of cult classic horror movies! This doen't have very many special features but, it is worth buying! It doesn't just have George Romero's Night Of The Living Dead but, has nine other movies including the original House On Haunted Hill! This is a horror movie set that should not be missed but, wanted especially for Night Of The Living Dead! Get this for it truely is a masters work!",1030752000,3,657,4.306451612903226

These were recorded from old tapes or film reels (uncleaned) with continuous tracking line and graining. Not worth the money at any price. They are used the WOW factor to get your money.

1419483,4,B00005AWQL,"All of the reviews of this film are INCORRECT!!  So be very cautious when reading them...

This ""Vault of Horror"" is the 1973 Amicus film anthology made by the same people who made ""Tales from the Crypt"" and ""House That Dripped Blood"".  It has nothing to do with that ""lousy"" boxed set everyone is reviewing here.

This was actually a rather fun, black comedy series of tales about 5 men trapped in a tower basement who tell their nighmares to each other.  Each ending with gruesome ends, that follows events they created in their own lives.  This was 1 of a number of films made in the last 60's, early 70's dealing with this same genre, and it's a shame we here in the USA have no avaliability to get any of them on DVD, with the exception of Torture Garden and House that Dripped Blood.  Asylum, also made by Amicus was quickly released a few years back, but is now gone.  I am waiting for both Tales from the Crypt, the 1972 thriller and Vault of Horror from 1973 to be released.  So when reading other reviews here, be careful, they are describing ""The Vault of Horror"" boxed sets of garbage films, not this well acted and fun thriller from 1973.  Hope this helps to clarify.",1134864000,39,1180,4.3963133640553
1419484,4,B00005AWQL,"First of all, if you've bought any of these Brentwood/BCI Eclipse box sets before you know what to expect.  If not, be forewarned that many of these movies are pretty poor quality prints, probably acquired in most cases from VHS versions of the films.  On the plus side, you're paying a low price for 10, count 'em, 10 movies.  If you're addicted to low budget horror movies like myself, you might just find a few hidden gems here.  I will now strain my warped lil' brain and attempt to rank these suckers from worst to best.

(10) Moon of the Wolf.  TV movie, pretty dull involving a werewolf.  Starring David Janssen, better known for the TV series The Fugitive.

(9)  Scream of the Wolf.  See above.  Starring Peter Graves, better known for TV's Mission Impossible.

(8)  The Wolfman.  Star Earl Owensby produced several of these cheapies for the Southern drive-in movie market in the 70's.  His character turns into a werewolf, as you might have guessed.  Hit and miss but picks up in the last 30 minutes when the monster finally goes on a bloody rampage.

(7)  Snowbeast.  Another TV-movie, but succeeds where our wolven friends failed because it's utterly entertaining crap.  It's about an abominable snowman terrorizing a ski resort.  Bad dialogue and lots of ugly colorful 70's snow gear add up to the cinematic equivalent of a big-ass handful of Pop Rocks, i.e. a fun junk food movie.

(6)  Silent Night, Bloody Night.  Weird, kind of artsy 70's flick , for me the highlight was seeing Mary Woronov star as the heroine in what was a pretty straightforward role.  Woronov played the evil principal in Rock N' Roll High School and was one of the killers in Eating Raoul, so usually she camps it up quite a bit onscreen.  Dull at times, but some effective moments including a strange, Manson family-inspired ""flashback"" scene at the end.

(5)  Jack the Ripper.  OK, Eurotrash movie fans, it's the legendary director Jess Franco taking some extreme liberties with the Jack the Ripper legend.  Klaus Kinski plays the title role, and there were a couple gore/nudity scenes to please all the pervs (ahem).  The only drawback here was a lame ending and the dubbing, but that's to be expected with a lot of these Euro-quickies.  Good stuff.

(4)  Satanic Rites of Dracula.  Many Hammer fans were understandably disappointed in this last installment starring Christopher Lee as the infamous Count.  But B-movie fans may take lots of satisfaction in such things as the basement full o' sexy female vamps, and the motorcycle-riding thugs wearing fur coats.  I like Chris Lee in almost everything he's done, and this one is no exception except that he's kind of underused.

(3)  House on Haunted Hill.  This is the original black and white version starring Vincent Price.  Normally that would be enough to shoot this one up to the #1 or 2 spot, but the low quality of the print is pretty distracting and makes it look like you're watching the movie through a TV screen that hasn't been dusted or cleaned in awhile.  Still, a classic if you've never seen it.

(2)  Don't Look in the Basement.  Simply put, a 70's trash classic.  Extreme, ridiculous, disturbing, funny, I could go on with lots of adjectives to describe this bizarre, no-budget story about a loony bin full of weirdos.  Take my word for it and watch it.  You may even be surprised how convincing and good some of the acting is here and there.

(1)  Night of the Living Dead.  If you've never seen it (the original black & white version) dig yourself out from under that slimy rock with Internet access and watch it!!! Watch it!!! Many (including myself) believe this to be the best horror movie of all time.  My only disclaimer here would be the fairly poor quality of the print.  However, the first couple times in my life I watched this film, I watched a crappy, beat up VHS with even worse picture and it still kicked butt. This film is so good I'd watch it through a swarm of killer bees or a blizzard of flying broken glass if I had to.  But if you're already familiar with the film, pick up the Milennium edition, an amazingly clear, crisp remaster that is so good it's like watching a whole different movie.

The moral of this horror story is: a cheap 10-movie set in the hand is, uh, better than paying $20 for a boring, lame movie like Demons III: The Ogre, or Black Demons, or Bloodlust-The Black Forest Vampire.  But such is the life of a horror addict.",1122595200,16,4424,4.630154639175258
1419485,4,B00005AWQL,"Definitely worth getting if you're looking to fatten up your horror collection.  These movies vary from absolute classics (""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""House on Haunted Hill"") to entertaining (""Snowbeast"" and all of the werewolf movies) to downright boring (I literally slept through ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"").  I really enjoyed seeing all of these forgotten horror films that I probably would never have heard of, much less seen, had I not picked this collection up on a whim.  If are a true horror fanatic, there's no question about it; you must own this set.  If you are a casual horror fan looking for some serious gore and high-quality scares, don't bother.  You won't find much of that here.",1080864000,10,704,4.882352941176471
1419486,5,B00005AWQL,"I love how people buy a DVD with a big skull on the cover, and then are disappointed because the horror movies are cheesy.
I ESPECIALLY respect the guy who gave ""Don't Look In The Basement"" a ""0"" rating. Of course, there was someone who gave ""Last House on the Left"" 1 star also, so...you summer blockbuster types are everywhere, aren't you?
If you liked The Scream Trilogy The Blair Witch project and you can't sit through anything that has less action the Night of the Living Dead, then you shouldnt buy this film, because it isn't for you. Go to Blockbuster Video and rent Freddy vs. Jason and stop rating movies about which you know nothing.",1062806400,16,645,4.521367521367521

7936128,5,B00005AWQL,"I bought this for ""Scream of the Wolf,"" and was not disappointed.  I believe I saw this as a child when it first aired as a ""movie of the week"" special.  It was one of those made-for-TV films which oozed mystery and atmosphere, and the ads made it seem like must-see TV.  Mom and I watched and thought it was great, even with Spic-and-Span commercials interrupting the fun ;-)

It's wonderful to see it again after all these years.  Robert Cobert certainly was a fine composer and seeing so many faces from my youth was like a visit from old friends.  There are other interesting titles on this collection as well, one to a side of a disc in a large, well-made case.
