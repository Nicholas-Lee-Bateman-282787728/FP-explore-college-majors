8254780,5,B0014ABB76,"It is so amazing that ancient people knew of earths energies, and knew of certain points where that energy is especially focused. They knew so much more than we do of metaphysics! Our society of doubt & cynisicm holds us back. This was a well made, interesting documentary.",1374883200,,273,4.708333333333333
8254781,5,B0014ABB76,I had had heard of dowsing and the earth's energy but had never learned as much as is explored here. You will be taken on a journey to a time where the ancients knew the power of this energy. The exploration of the sacred sites is spellbinding.,1374883200,,244,4.212765957446808
8254782,4,B0014ABB76,"Better than I expected. very interesting and well put together.
Discussing sacred sights etc. Beautiful views. Will watch it many more time.",1355702400,,140,5.409090909090909
8254783,5,B0014ABB76,"This is a deep look into the earth's energy. By using dowsing, healing and quantum physics earth's energy is explained. The idea that the earth's energy flows the same way human energy does really resonates with me, we are deeply connected to the earth.",1233619200,3,253,4.7727272727272725
8254784,4,B0014ABB76,"Ever heard of ""earth energy"" or ""dowsing?"" If so, this will give you feedback from some experts in the field, including a healer, a psychic, and experts on quantum physics and earth sciences. If this is new to you, it will be a most credible introduction through a tour of sacred sites.",1216425600,3,286,4.519230769230769
8254785,4,B0014ABB76,"This dvd delves into the theory that many of the ancient sacred sites, like the circle of rock called the Merry Maidens in England, are spots in the earth where a special energy exists. Intelligent archeological experts have come together to show that these ancient sites were probably chosen for their earth energy.  These sites were located with the use of quantum physics.  Some of this was a little over my head but the crazy beautiful scenery made up for that.  Highly recommended!",1214352000,,486,4.831325301204819
8254786,3,B0014ABB76,"Explores the ""earth energy"" at sacred sites with input from a healer, a psychic, and experts on quantum physics and earth sciences. There is much discussion of ""dowsing"" a practice I never heard of, which is apparently a way to spiritually divine the presence of water as well as other earth energies. Hamish Miller's story is further recounted in the DVD The Parallel Community.",1213833600,3,379,4.9375
8254787,4,B0014ABB76,"An interesting examination of the relationship between energy was and many of the sacred sites of the ancient world. The film posits  ""the Merry Maidens,"" in Cornwall, England, as the site at which these  ""energy lines"" intersect.  A great film for anyone who is interested in connectivity and quantum physics.",1213401600,,310,5.16
