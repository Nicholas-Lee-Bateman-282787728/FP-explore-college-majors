8603161,2,B00EADUWHO,"With a big budget and two star actors including Mikael Persbrandt (from BECK fame), THE HYPNOTIST has everything going for it.

Set in Stockholm around Christmas, it concerns the mass slaughter of a family, a traumatized boy (Jonatan Bokman), and a hypnotist (Persbrandt) who uses his powers to try and coax information out of the boy. Brought in by the local CID inspector (Tobias Zilliacus), the hypnotist thinks he is doing a good job, but matters take an unexpected turn when his son Benjamin (Oscar Pettersson) is unexpectedly abducted. The plot becomes a race against time to rescue Benjamin, a hemophiliac, before he hemorrhages.

Lasse Hallstrm's production is highly atmospheric, using the snow- covered streets and gray lights of a Swedish winter to create a sense of foreboding in a story that proves more complicated than initially suggested. The film brings out the hypnotist's complicated past - he was struck off for having been involved in a child abuse scandal a few years previously. Persbrandt conveys an air of injured pride, as someone trying to do his job but victimized by circumstances beyond his control.

As the action unfolds, however, so the plot begins to fall apart, leaving plenty of unexplained holes: how does an apparently catatonic patient manage to escape from the hospital and try to stab the hypnotist? Why should the mother of one boy want to kidnap another family's child? And how did she find out about the other family anyway? The film comes to a highly melodramatic conclusion in the frozen wastes of rural Sweden, involving a minivan gradually sinking under the ice and at least one unwanted death.

The film invites us to speculate on the morality of hypnotizing someone so as to obtain information, but loses the courage of its convictions by the end.",1467936000,,1797,4.98
8603162,4,B00EADUWHO,"Adapted from the Swedish novel by Alexander Ahndoril this is classic Nordic noir. It centres around the murder of a physical education instructor; detective Joona Line wants to investigate and then hears of another call - this is the murder victim's house and his entire family have been attacked. The only survivor is the son, who has also been badly injured.

In a desperate attempt to find the culprit; the help of a disgraced doctor is asked. He is also a hypnotist - Erik Bark. Once he is involved though, both the media and the murderer are alerted and he himself becomes the story and the target.

This is a really good film, but many people have taken exception to it based on the fact that they all loved the book so much more. I recently saw an interview with a well known author who was asked `did you like what the film makers did to your book?' He said they have done nothing to the book it remains intact and the film is a version of the story based on the novel. That is how I approached this. The book is excellent and the film is rather good. It has high production values, an air of menace and enough twists to keep most thriller fans happy - so all in all a pretty good effort.",1422662400,,1196,4.287610619469026
8603163,3,B00EADUWHO,"Since it was a foreign film, it did not allow my Blueray player to play it.  My computer did allow the showing of The Hypnotist. It was a very good show and followed the book as well as could be expected.",1405123200,,204,3.975609756097561
8603164,4,B00EADUWHO,"This was a delightful surprise.  I thought I had exhausted the available inventory of Nordic Noir movies and tv murder mysteries but kept overlooking this movie, thinking it would be about mindreading or the occult.  No, this is a real Swedish mystery thriller with the always excellent Swedish actor MIkael Persbrandt (co-star in the Beck series), directed by the Academy award winning Lasse Hallstrom --what a winning team! And what a fantastic plot with a twist.  I was finally drawn back to it by Persbrandt's consistently good choices of parts, (not overlooking his blue eyes and good looks), and he did not disappoint. I recommend it highly!",1399766400,,647,5.02803738317757
