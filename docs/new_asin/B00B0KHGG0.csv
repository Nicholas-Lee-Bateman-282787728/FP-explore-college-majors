5540404,4,B00B0KHGG0,The only downside for me was there is no English Subtitles.  Hopefully there will be a part 3 because I love the First and Second movies.,1408838400,,137,4.269230769230769
5540405,2,B00B0KHGG0,"TENGO CANAS DE TI (I WANT YOU) fizzles. Were is not for the eye candy of Mario Casas, Clara Lago and Mar&iacute;a Valverde this overly long, plotless film would not be worth watching. It is a chick flick with the usual too frequently filmed  story - `boy pouts over lost love, can new girl win his torn heart or will he return to his old love?, another girl gets pregnant from a fling, a mother discovers her husband is cheating on her, another mother lies dying in a hospital, a motor race to settle scores'. Based on a book (believe it or not) by Federico Moccia, adapted for he screen by Ram&oacute;n Salazar and directed by Fernando Gonz&aacute;lez Molina, it is supposedly  a sequel to another film `Tres Metros Sobre el Cielo `(Three Steps above Heaven). The film is in Spanish with English subtitles, but there is so very little that happens in this very long movie the subtitles are not necessary. Turn off the sound and just admire the actors' physical appearances. Mario Casas should be working in Hollywood! Grady Harp, March 14",1395360000,2,1039,4.641304347826087

5540407,3,B00B0KHGG0,no english subtitles. is there a transcript lying around in english? watched the first movie when i turned on the tv in the morning... was ready to flip channels. didn't think i would be hooked but watched and was happy to read that there was a second movie. i took a gamble and purchased the second movie.,1388361600,12,306,4.385964912280702

5540411,3,B00B0KHGG0,"Its a good movie but I don't like the end,  I hoped that at the end of the movie Babi and H end up together.",1374710400,,108,3.32
5540412,1,B00B0KHGG0,"Perhaps I'm the naive one, but I thought that a movie in Spanish sold here would have English subtitles.  Most English language movies I've ever purchased have subtitles in Spanish and often several other languages.  At a minimum you should have a note on the purchase ad indicating whether it has subtitles.  My Spanish is not good enough for me to enjoy this movie without some help so it's pretty worthless to me.  My bad, but I won't get burned again by Amazon.",1370390400,4,465,4.566265060240964

8560319,4,B00B0KHGG0,"I felt Hugo (Ace) was a much more likable character in this, the sequel to Tres Metros Sobre El Cielo.  This story was about love and loss, living and learning and he had some very hard lessons to learn.  It was bitter sweet.  The acting was very good.  Once again, no English subtitles came with the disk.",1502409600,,306,4.315789473684211

8560322,5,B00B0KHGG0,"I loved 3msc, so I had to purchase the 2nd part. Tengo Ganas De Ti follows the lead characters lives after 3 years. I like this movie, but the 1st part is still my fav. Tengo Ganas De Ti is a bit more darker than the first and shows more of a reality than a fairy tale happy ending unlike the first. However, they did a great job putting it together. Product arrived on time and was brand new. Definitely a must see.",1482796800,,416,4.024096385542169

8560326,1,B00B0KHGG0,"The cinematography was great. There were pretty faces and bodies. Good music score. However there was one problem with the movie there was no story. I mean OK guy falls in love with one girl. One gets pregnant in a bar. One of the characters has trouble deciding on a girl.

For me this movie was so bad I had to write this review.

I mean the movie had potential. The acting was decent. The characters were pretty but there was no story!

I'm done with Netflix. They just put the worst movies.",1456358400,,494,4.290322580645161
