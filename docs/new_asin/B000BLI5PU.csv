2423661,5,B000BLI5PU,"When I was in high school, I discovered the Drive In cinema and the triple features. In the late 70's, I understood and watched many of  the B rated trash and grindhouse film on the drive in screen. In those days, there were a large amount of trailers between the films.  Sometimes watching the trailers were better than the movie itself.

It's 25 years later from my drive in days, I got a copy of this DVD. I watched this dvd with an open mind.

 As I watched, memories of old flashed thru my mind. The trailers of many films I had seen ran on my DVD screen. Many bad as well  as good film's trailer showcased the films of the 70's and its low budget drive in wonders. One would only hope some of these films would make it to DVD, so i could enjoy these trahy offerings again.

If you are looking for trailers from great cinema masterpieces, DONT GET THIS! if you are looking for Disney or family movie trailers, DONT GET THIS!

However If you want the previews of badly dubbed karate films (the Crippled Master), Schock Science Fiction films (The Green Slime,The Raider of Atlantis), Documentaries (Secret Africa, Shocking asia), Motorcycle Movies (The Pink Angels,Werewolves on Wheels) and misdubbed europian sex comedies (Charlie and the Hooker,Black Veil for Lisa)....THIS ONE'S FIOR YOU!

So if you are a child of the 60's or the 70's, you may remember some of these films from the trailers. If You are fan of film, you may enjoy this video trip down B rated memory lane of grindhouse cinema.

2423662,5,B000BLI5PU,"During the golden age of films, prior to television, massive, palatial, ornately decorated theaters were constructed as going to the movies was often an event.  After television came about, many of these theaters (which subsequently suffered from neglect as audiences dwindled), particularly those in the inner cities, began catering to different audiences, becoming what was known as grindhouse theaters, with those located on New York's 42nd Street probably being the most relatable examples.  Grindhouses would specialize in showing the stuff you probably wouldn't take your mother to see, as the films were often extremely graphic, sleazy, contemptible, and schlocky in nature from both foreign and domestic distributors...blaxploitaion, sexploitation (hard and soft core), hixploitation, nunsploitation, violent chop socky features, Japanese monster films, European horror sleaze, gore, giallo (Italian thrillers), `mondo' style films, nudie cuties...these were many of the various genres popular prior to the subsequent disappearance of the grindhouse venues by the mid to late 1980s, as the areas these theaters were located in were populated by what was generally considered the underbelly of society, and became easy targets as city leaders sought to garner favor with their constituents by sweeping clean the `scum', so to speak...but I digress...

In this DVD release of 42nd Street Forever Volume 1, Synapse Films provides an excellent representation of the diversity of the material popular over the years in these palaces of sleaze, in the form of 47 trailers, which were often better, by the way, than the actual features.

There's just over two hours of material on this DVD, presented in 1.78:1 letterboxed, enhanced for 16X9 TVs, with obviously formatted from different aspect ratios.  The Audio is Dolby Digital 2.0 mono.  Both the picture and audio quality vary from trailer to trailer, but most are quite good.

2423663,5,B000BLI5PU,"If you were too young to sit in a grindhouse movie theatre in Times Square back-in-the-day, (or too sensible), then you can recapture some of the seedy glory of times (square) gone by with this DVD in your own living room, with a much lower likelihood of a rat biting you or a drug addict puking on you.

You get a wide variety of trailers here in a wide variety of clas-SICK genres, from stomach-churning horror shows, to lead-blastin' action flix, to soft porn epics (no chillen, please!  Adults only!)  Great for throwing on at a party, as long as you have a bunch of sick individuals just like yourself partying down with you.

I could go into detail, mentioning all the great trailers like ""They Call Her One Eye"" and Fred Williamson's western ""Boss N****r""  But take it from me, this is a wild ride into a long-gone cinema wonderland.

There was a previous DVD with this title by Ban One Productions.  That company has also assembled this DVD, but never fear if you have that earlier disc.  There are only about 2-3 repeats on the whole show, so it's worth buying.  Get it!",1133049600,19,1079,4.492307692307692

I thought that will be about great movies, but I found out that it was about movies never heard about them mostly B, C, D,... and Z movies with an awful picture,And if the person who made this video is little smart, he could put one good movie from that era on the disk with his punch of commercials to make it worth the money, So save your money, and time, and get a real movie instead of that crab.",1438992000,,497,4.081632653061225

8088769,3,B000BLI5PU,"I mistakenly thought this was similar to the other 42nd Street Forever collection, which was a focused collection of movie trailers which ran across several genres over a couple of decades.

These are not trailers for movies.  These are the actual drop-a-dime-in-the-slot movies you would have seen at adult stores or clubs.

Once I realized my mistake, this was interesting for including John Holmes, clips with three or more sex partners, and girl-on-girl short films.  Honestly, in this day of instant gratification, online or offline, and having never been a huge fan of porn in the first place, this was more hypnotizing as a peep into the past than as a peep through the keyhole.",1397692800,4,685,4.930434782608696
8088770,3,B000BLI5PU,"Fans of 1970s and early '80s adult loops may very well regard this as their DVD of the year.  However, I expected more than this collection ultimately had to offer.  Make no mistake, this comprises entirely of hardcore, adult content.  So if you have an aversion to such material, especially from that era, best to keep your distance.  This DVD goes beyond the scope of previous 42nd Street Forever releases which featured mostly exploitation (and some X-rated) film trailers.

Included in this DVD are fifteen (15) sex loops remastered and presented in the best possible video quality.  Granted, this means they're still fraught with many scratches, chips, or fibers on nearly every frame, but the source materials are 8mm film prints and the high-resolution transfers make the most of them.  As it was with such prints, there is no audio.  Impulse Pictures fills this void with the sounds of a running film projector.

You'll see John Holmes, Annie Sprinkle, Lisa De Leeuw, and Susan Nero, but little else.  No special features of any kind - unless you regard choosing which loop to view or a 'play all' option as being particularly special.

Though Amazon does not seem to allow the posting of all fifteen titles as they are, let me assure you that no sheep were injured or placed in any danger during the making of 'Sheep Weren't Never Like This.'  Though it must be said that an egg does indeed make an appearance in 'Come on My Eggs', and is served over easy.

When all is said and done, they're just a bunch of loops running a total of less than 2 hours.  But if it's a small collection of remastered '70s and early '80s silent sex loops you're after, this is the DVD to buy.",1394668800,20,1682,4.619528619528619

8088772,4,B000BLI5PU,"This DVD from Synapse Films is great. 42nd Street Forever contains over two hours of grindhouse movie trailers from the 1960's and 1970's. These trailers are packed with uncensored nudity, sleaze and violence. Try not to watch them around children, religious people or sensitive people. There's trailers for Hard Candy, Matango, Thriller A Cruel Picture, Panorama Blue, A Black Veil for Lisa(starring Thunderball's Luciana Paluzzi), The Green Slime, Starcrash, Wicked Wicked and more. Wicked Wicked was a 1974 thriller told in ""Duovision"". It bombed and never received a home video release. This DVD is a must see for movie buffs.",1361664000,3,630,5.31
