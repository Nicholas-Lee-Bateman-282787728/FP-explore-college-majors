1077703,4,6305807671,"Garner made 2 movie for disney.  if your on the look out for good family movie that are fun, no cursing or nudity, a little action and a little romance... you want Castaway Cowboy, CC not One Little Indian, OLI.
CC is a nice movie about a cowboy that ends up stuck on an island.  He shows the nice widow woman how to start a cattle ranch instead of tring to far or fish.
OLI is very boring.  Not one of my three kids stayed for the end.  And isn't that the true test of a movie.  It isn't totally what mom or I like, it is also what they will like enough to sit and watch and enjoy.",1059177600,3,582,3.857142857142857
1077704,4,6305807671,This is a nice family movie for all even if it is a bit on the long side. Great DVD treatment from Anchor Bay. Let's hope they get more Disney films to release as Disney treats the majority of their classics in miserable shoddy full screen format. Kudos to Anchor Bay!,1047772800,,268,4.2745098039215685
1077705,3,6305807671,"This movie was ok, but I found myself looking through magazines and such as it had many slow parts in it making it seem so much longer.  It is hilarious in spots where Garner is attemting to teach the islanders how to ride a horse and rope cattle.  I would rent first, it is fine for kids of all ages, hey, it's Disney!",1004227200,2,319,4.0476190476190474

1077924,5,6305807671,"Just to be clear (and for those who do not change the review filters for the various formats,) this review is solely in regards to the movie itself as I purchased the digital download through Disney Movies Anywhere and linked it to my Amazon account.
  James Garner and Vera Miles have always been family favorites (especially in their western genres), so when we came across this film years ago we gave it a shot. We enjoyed the film so much that when a neighborhood video store went out of business, we purchased their VHS copy and put many more miles on it.
  While not a Western in the traditional sense, James Garner still portrays a ""cowboy"" who finds himself washed up on the shores of Hawaii. Vera Miles portrays a widow, trying to support herself and her son by running a failing potato farm riddled with nuisance wild cattle. Garner finds himself trying to understand and adapt to the culture of the Islanders while trying to introduce them to the world of cattle ranching.
  This is a good, light-hearted and enjoyable story suitable for all ages. It contains the usual good guys, bad guys adventure, and humor combined with some beautiful scenery of Kauai.",1462838400,3,1168,4.700980392156863
1077925,1,6305807671,"I personally love James Garner and Vera Miles, and was excited to see a *new* old movie. Besides being definitely one of the weaker movies they both played in, as a Christian, I was disappointed in the story plot of this movie. There's a witch doctor who plays a major role through demonic activity (although it all turns out good), that should not be apart of this story. Demonic activity is very real, and is not to be played with but combated through the blood of Jesus Christ. This movie left me feeling uneasy.",1453334400,,515,4.48936170212766

He comes up with the idea of gathering the cattle and selling them to trading ships.  Then he trains the local natives on the large
farm to become Pineapple Cowboys.  Fun movie.  Toss in a little villainy by Robert Culp to go with fine performances of James Garner and Vera Miles and you have good movie.",1401753600,,554,4.401960784313726

1078355,4,6305807671,"This movie is about a cowboy (James Garner) who washes ashore onto Hawaii, having been previously shanghaied and escaped.  He hesitantly sticks around to help Vera Miles and her son make the farm profitable, and decides they can do much better raising cattle than potatoes.  He has to face his own longing to return to Texas, and external challenges:  a thug hired by the wealthy man who wants the farm, the challenges of training Hawaiians to be cowboys, and the logistics of transporting cattle to ships.  There's not a lot of character development, but there's some humor and several sections of intense action.  I think it's a fairly good movie because it has an interesting story, decent script, and decent amount of variety (and it has a cute Hawaiian melody that gets used throughout).  And if you like James Garner, his character has the components he's best-loved for:  his unique kind of verbal comeback, his confident yet careful card-playing, and standoffishness.",1361491200,,975,5.0186335403726705

1078428,3,6305807671,"If you like Disney, and if you like James Garner, what's not to like. It's classic Disney, with the lead played like only James Garner can play a cowboy role. And it's always nice to see familiar faces from back in the day, like Robert Culp and Gregory Sierra.

However, I bought it to play on my big screen t.v. for the family and - on the big screen t.v. - the picture quality was disappointingly poor. I am also leery of buying a ""video"" instead of a DVD. With a DVD, you have something you can hold in your hand - something you actually own, having purchased it. I purchased the video with the thought that I would be able to back it up on a DVD. Otherwise, all you've purchased are temporary electrical impulses - like buying air. It appears that backing up do disc is not an option with these ""instant video"" purchases and the quality appears to be less than DVD quality in any case.

I don't think I'll be purchasing ""instant videos"" in the future, nor will I rent through Kindle, as I can rent the same movies of interest through Red Box for $1 (slightly more for blue-ray) and I prefer to have a disc in my hand for about the same cost as the ""instant video"". Amazon should do the same thing with their videos that they're doing with their music.

It looks like this must have been made from an old tape. It was very contrasty in most of the dark scenes (proably 10% of the time) to the point it was hard to see what was going on. In good light (full daylight) the visual was fine. I recommend this for the quality of the movie but don't expect perfect visual viewing.

I talked to someone at Amazon and he directed me to this version of the movie.  I ordered it and it arrived on time and in order.  We as a family live where we don't get regular reception of anything and have to keep a landline so simple is good.  My teenagers tolerated it well from ages 13-18 and the little ones 3-7 loved it and have requested seeing it several times.  Movie nights are a family event, popcorn and all.  The setting was beautiful and I thought it was captured well considering the time it was filmed.  This was a Hit with mystery, fun, a scarry character, a bad guy, and suspenseful moments.  Anything with James Garner is welcomed since he's a fun actor and pulls off humor and tough guy well.  Watching them mix Hawaian and cowboy was very interesting, a great idea.  This movie doesn't have a lot of fast paced excitement or super hero action so I would recomend this to people who want a clean family movie even teenagers will enjoy.

1078436,5,6305807671,Disney at his best is depicted in this film which takes place on the island of Maui. The usual theme of hero who rescuses the financial strapped widow escape from the trappings of the greedy landowner is evident. What makes this film delightful is the humor while the castaway cowboy tries to train the natives to be ranchers. I highly recommend this film for families who want a wholesome evening's entertainment with their families.,1337817600,2,434,4.878378378378378

Imagine my delight when Amazon.com had it, finally, at a good, affordable price!  I was so delighted, that I ordered a copy for her and for us.  Unfortunately, this affordable version of the movie won't play on DVD players in America!  It's made to play in Europe!  I returned both DVD's and was promised a refund.  Very disappointed!  The version that plays in America is around $40 while this version is $21 and some change.  Why the discrepancy?",1337385600,4,578,4.7

1078482,4,6305807671,"It's a little-known fact that the Hawaiian Islands are the location of several notable cattle ranches, staffed by native wranglers known as ""paniolos"" (a word that probably derives from ""Espanol,"" or Spanish, the ethnicity of the Western Hemisphere's original mounted cattle-herders).  This Disney double-length TV episode suggests how they came to be.  Sometime in the 1870's, Texas cowboy Lincoln Costain (James Garner)--""a wronged man"" who was presumably shanghaiied to sea, though details are never supplied--washes ashore on the island of Kauai after leaping overboard from a sailcraft and is found by Booton MacAvoy (Eric Shea), whose widowed mother Henrietta (Disney stalwart Vera Miles) takes him in.  Linc soon discovers that the MacAvoys have two major issues: their potato farm isn't doing at all well financially, and their home compound is frequently invaded by small herds of half-wild cattle (""the animals"").  Wanting to repay their hospitality, he suggests that they try to round up the creatures, which are worth $20 or more a head in California, and that leads him to trying to make cowhands of their Hawaiian farm workers--not the easiest job he's ever undertaken.  (""I better get back to Texas before I lose my stitchin',"" he says-- ""I have nightmares about these people you wouldn't believe!"")  Coping with local produce factor, moneylender, and storekeeper Calvin Bryson (Robert Culp), who's courting Henrietta in defiance of Booton's doubts, the cultural gap between Texas and the Islands, a native sorcerer (Nephi Hanneman) in Bryson's pay, and the contrary nature of bovines, he keeps at it, and triumphs over all obstacles in the end.  How he does it is funny, fast-moving, and full of action.  Garner made several Disney films, but this is among the best.",1263427200,13,1782,5.27208480565371

I saw this movie several years ago and have searched for it for sometime before I finally found it on Amazon. Now I go to Amazon for any movie I am looking for first!!! Way to go Amazon. There are not enough stars in the rate this item for this movie. Great movie for parents and kids to watch together, but then most of the shows we watch, are suitable for parents to watch with their kids. I can't stand the new shows with all the Sci fi and the horror shows. Disgusting. What is out younger generation coming to.
Thanks again Amazon, for having this title available. You are Number 1 with us.

1078486,3,6305807671,"In the early '70's, James Garner made two films for Disney studios, ""One Little Indian"" and ""The Castaway Cowboy.""  Of the two, ""Cowboy"" is by far the best: a slight but entertaining little comedy-western co-starring the lovely Vera Miles (who was also in ""Indian"").  She plays Henrietta McAlvoy, the owner of a failing Hawaiian (known here as the Sandwich Islands) potato plantation whose native workers fish a nearly drowned deserter named Costain (Garner) out of the ocean.  While Costain waits for a ship home to Texas, he hatches a plot to save the farm by turning it into a cattle ranch, using the Hawaiian workers as ranch hands.  Of course, in Disney films of the era, there is always a villain, and ""Cowboy"" features Robert Culp as Bryson, a local businessman who romances Henrietta in order to get her land and when she won't sell, stoops to some nasty business to sabotage Garner's plan.
Everything is predictable and ends just like you think it might.  Also quite predictably, Henrietta is a widow with an irrepressibly cute (i.e. cloying and obnoxious) preteen son played by ""The Poseidon Adventure""'s young Eric Shea, who gives an even more annoying, don't-say-your-line-shout-it performance than he gave in the previous film.  The only other performances of note are given by native Hawaiians playing the workers as stereotypes who exist merely as goofballs to be laughed at.  (More about that later.)  Only Elizabeth Smith as Henrietta's housekeeper escapes with her dignity intact, since she manages to make her character more than a one-note stereotype.
Finally, about Anchor Bay's DVD presentation.  Even though the copy I received was in fullscreen format (instead of the advertised widescreen--grumble, grumble) I kept it because of the excellent remastered print and the addition of a cool copy of the original poster art from the 1974 release on the back of the scene breakdown card.  I still would prefer widescreen, but at least the picture and sound are much better than the awful transfers Disney have been ripping us off with on its own lazy releases.
Now, a word of warning about the presentation of the native Hawaiian characters:  if you are sensitive about racial issues and potential racism in the movies, you may want to steer clear of this film.  The Hawaiian workers are stereotyped as lazy and undisciplined men-children who would rather swim and play than work.  This fact may make the film as offensive to some as ""Song of the South"" is to African-Americans.  However, the natives do become better, more competent workers by the end of the film, so proceed at your own risk!",1084924800,16,2613,4.977011494252873

7895259,4,6305807671,"What an unexpected surprise. The Castaway Cowboy is set in the lush island of Kauai in Hawaii. The timeframe is never clear but it must be mid to late 1800's. Lincoln Costain (James Garner) is a mysterious stranger who washes ashore and is taken in my lovely widow Henrietta MacAvoy (Vera Miles) and her precocious 12-year-old son Booton ( Eric Shea). Henrietta's potato farm is failing and Costain, a Texas cowboy, herding in and selling the wild cattle that roam her 10,000 acre ranch. Sell the cattle and ship them to the mainland and the ranch is saved.

Disney Studios was still finding its way after the death of Walt Disney. Ron Miller (Walt's son-in-law) headed the studio and produced this film that was one of many ""family"" films of the 1970's. It's great to see a young James Garner and Vera Miles never disappoints. The lush scenery really makes this film stand out among the countless other films of this era. The story may be hard to believe at times but their is a genuine goodness about this film.

Wealthy Calvin Bryson (Robert Culp) has his eyes on the lovely widow. He ""kindly"" lends her money for the ranch only to find ways to make it fail. With the aid of his henchman Marruja (Gregory Sierra) and the local witch doctor, trouble can only be around the corner. Well, there always has to be a conflict. Adding to the villains is the dilemma of how to get the cattle to the ship when there are no docks or port and ships can't get close to shore. Cargo is transported to and from the ship in long boats.

Costain attempts to turn the Hawaiian workers into cowboys. Of course, there is humor in people who've never ridden a horse or lassoed a steer but sometimes it gets too comical at the expense of the Hawaiians. Although they are a happy crew, the Hawaiians would rather run off and play at the bench or local waterfall. Their portray would unnerve some people in today's era of political correctness but needless to say they are good-hearted people who rally around Costain when needed. Another cringe-worthy aspect is the rounding up of cattle--roping and tying them down. Again, by today's standards it all seems excessive.

In the end, THE CASTAWAY COWBOY is a fun film with beautiful scenery. Since it is a period piece, it is not so dated but the story and portrayal of native Hawaiians and treatment of cattle is from a different era. Things would be done differently today. A different setting and a young James Garner. It's a classic Disney film from the era.",1495065600,3,2491,4.591011235955056
