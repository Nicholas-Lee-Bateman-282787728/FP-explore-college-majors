1981954,5,B00019G8EW,"A totally enchanting production with all the elements needed to make it worth watching over and over.  Lovely voices, wonderful interpretation, fine acting, beautiful directing/conducting and a set that fits without being distracting. The Callas/Gobbi/Alva studio recording CD is a terrific addition to this.",1101081600,12,308,6.0
1981955,1,B00019G8EW,"I checked the reviews before I bought this DVD and am wondering if we're talking about the same item.  I've seen this opera live several times as well as on VHS, and this is the worst version.  Even with an excellent sound system, the sound of this DVD is awful and the staging and costumes annoying.  Once the lovely overture was over, my husband and I could stand to watch it for about 15-20 more minutes and gave up.  What a waste of money.",1178496000,5,443,4.238095238095238
1981956,5,B00019G8EW,"Firstly, I can understand that some people may not like this production. It is ""live"", raw and different. But I love it because of the energy and verve of the singers, the sheer exurberance of the acting and the obvious enjoyment of the whole cast (even when they have to work very hard).

Technicaly this may not be the best production on disk, but in the end it doesn't matter. If you let-go and just roll with the punches you will enjoy it as much as I.

For me, the highligh of the work is Claudio Desderi's ""A un dottore della mia sorte"", an incredibly difficult piece to sing well (and he does!). I am also quite biased by Maria Ewing, who is one of the joys of our times in whatever role she choses to appear in",1175990400,6,718,4.195652173913044
1981957,1,B00019G8EW,I had to sell my copy for one dollar on Ebay - I couldn't stand to own it.  The Marriage of Figaro DVD from the same production company/Glyndebourne Festival is wonderful so I hoped this production would be as well but it wasn't.,1169510400,3,229,4.325581395348837
1981958,4,B00019G8EW,"I can only agree with all the other positive reviews of this work.

The singing is excellent, the set likewise and John Rawnsley is the Figaro I have always had in my mind's eye.

But what I liked best about this production is that not only are the singers excellent (which is what one expects anyway) but that they are (by and large) excellent actors as well. Contrary to many operatic productions where the acting is wooden at best, here the acting is expressive (without being excessive) and suits the music and the situation. Perhaps my favorite is the Buena sera scene where Basilio is being chivied out of the room by Bartolo, Figaro, Rossina and Almaviva. The expressions of resignation and exasperation on Basilio's face are superb.

My only quibble is about Maria Ewing as Rossina. Somehow I just couldn't warm up to her. She sings very well, but as a tempestous Spanish maiden who will attract the dashing Count Almaviva she just isn't convincing.

If you like Rossini and Figaro, this is for you.",1169337600,12,1007,4.704545454545454

Your service is all right! Amazon is serious.

1981960,5,B00019G8EW,"An obscure artist/painter named Cozzens, just before the turn of the century , made one of those paradigm shift remarks when he said, "" A painting is a two dimensional surface upon which to explore design possibilities"". Not long afterward the world exploded away from photo realism. One example might be Gaugin with his two dimensional, high contrast colour juxtapositions. Again and again he explored those possibilities, yet we would always spot a Gaugin a block away. This is known as the artist's signature style.

It is this way with Rossini. I have heard from several sources that Rossini 'recycles' his music material - certain passages, and certain bouncing lofty melodies do sound similar. But only in the same way that we find Gaugin's work ""similar""...

What I delight in is how Rossini does it. I found I had to replay ""Se il mio nome saper voi bramante"" by the romantic lead, Cosotti as Count Almaviva. What really had my jaw all a-slack was John Rawnsley as Figaro.

Here was a slightly devious,mercenary, mischevous, meddling, Quack Doctor, psychologist/counselor, matchmaker,( oh,...and barber...) who positively brimmed over with supreme self assurance....and we like him!

 Analyzing this, I had to confess that  I liked him because of his command of this role, in tandem with the powerful voice he possesses. One reviewer refers to it as 'yelling'...but that is what a powerful singer does, is to sound almost startling to us, it is so loud.  But if it is a beautiful sounding voice, and it certainly is one of the best I have ever heard, I say bravo, bravo. This just harkens back to the days before microphones when this is what it took to be heard all the way back to the cheap seats.

Now was Signor Rawnsley all by his lonesome? Nay, knave. Cosotti's sweet tenor voice with not quite as much bravado or spinto as Rawnsley's, was nonetheless a wonderful counterpoint with the most delicate of soto voce, and top A's with violin like clarity and purity.

Regarding Maria Ewing as  Rosina, I was most enamored. She was the perfect young woman chafing at the bit for ""coming of age/sexual"" release.

Her full, sensual lips, and glistening, ""talking eyes"" as they were described by Figaro,  and all that coquettish pouting made her enormously adorable. I found her voice just plain gorgeous to hear. I re-played her arias several times also. She is pure delight, visually , aurally, and she can act wonderfully.  All of them can. This is always the amazing thing to me, that they can remember their ""blocking"", or position on stage, remember all the words, remember every single note, and there are thousands of them to recall on cue...and act all at the same time.

Only one stood apart from the rest as 'marginal', and that would be the warmed over death Basilio. Now there is a part that would torpedo one's career on stage. How can anyone like a pale, scrawny, hideous plotter/schemer/destroyer ""By Slander"" specialist? (shudder). Rossini and his librettist knew exactly what they were doing to include this creep in a romantic comedy. For slander is not a joke, it is the most deadly and destructive force on earth (C.S.Lewis). It  destroys lives, marriages,  and careers. Yes Basilio  can't do anything but give us the creeps. But we have to admire anyone willing to play the creep in a play or opera- and run the risk of being typecast forever after.

And one last standout, the 'bad guy', so to speak, Dr. Bartolo played by Claudio Desderi. He played ""Dandini"" in the Ponelle directed ""La Cenerentola"" - another fabulous piece of staging , orchestra, and singing extravaganza guaranteed to please! Claudio does a terrific job as the control freak who keeps the lovely Maria Ewing in her cage all to himself.  This is, of course ""the plot""...our perrenially cheerful Figaro, who has all the answers, and all the ways, and all the means to put two people in love together...but not without a few mishaps, (ala the Cohen Bros. ""Fargo"" where a staged kidnapping went horribly wrong).

Of all the ""Barbers"" to choose from, I and many others give this one an enthusiastic endorsement. But like some of the other reviewers, I too may try another production just for fun. AFter all...what music!",1162166400,15,4215,4.835883171070932
1981961,5,B00019G8EW,"Once, a friend of Richard Wagner's (yes, he had a few) discovered him sitting in the shadows at the back of an opera house box watching ""The Barber of Seville.""

""How I love Rossini,"" said the great man, ""but you must not tell my Wagnerites.  They'd never forgive me.""

This is a good-looking, bright, energetic and wholly entertaining production of opera's reigning comedic warhorse.  If the singing is hardly likely to make hard-core fans throw away their recordings with Callas or Berganza, it is nevertheless perfectly respectable.

This is one of the all-too rare productions in which it appears that the stage director has bothered to read the text.  Why, wonder of wonders, when young, lovesick Count Almaviva is supposed to be singing a serenade, the director actually has him do just that.  And when Figaro, the town barber, is supposed to be shaving Dr Bartolo, the comic sort-of villain, he actually applies foamy shaving cream.  Astonishing!

Maria Ewing sings pretty well as she manages to be strange-looking-but-beautiful-anyway, funny, indomitable and adorable all at once.

This is probably as good a DVD as you might hope to find for introducing a newbie to the mad, illogical and ultimately addictive world of opera.

Five stars.

A NOTE ON CASTING: One Amazon reviewer has noted with dismay that Maria Ewing who sings Rosina is actually identified as a soprano, not as a mezzo-soprano for which the role was written.  Be reassured.  More than a few sopranos have succeeded as Rosina in the nearly two hundred years since ""The Barber"" was premiered.  Rossini, himself, coached soprano Adelina Patti in the part.  She scored a triumph.  (She later became so famous that the barbershop standard ""Sweet Adeline"" was written in her honor.)  Closer to our own time, a certain Greek-American lady named Callas had some success, too.",1150416000,29,1844,5.02970297029703
1981962,5,B00019G8EW,"The major quality of this production is the acting.

All the characters are so silly it's really amusing.

It is surely intended so.

They all suppose to be comic figures, and everyone who try to present them otherwise do injustice to the piece!

Cosotti sings very accurately without neglecting the quality of voice. He is much better than the tenor in dvd with Kasarova as Rosina.

Rawnsley does yell a bit, but it suits his part, and altogether he makes a fine barber.

Ewing's voice is not the appropriate lyric mezzo needed for her part. Her voice is uneven throughout the range - the changes of sound between her chest, middle and head voices are too obvious.

On the back of the cover she is actually described as a soprano.

Nevertheless, she excels in the coloratura passages and definitely looks her part.

The minor roles are very well-sang. The wonderful London Philharmonic led by Camberlin produce a comic atmosphere.

It's well sung, but even better acted.

Buy this if you are fond of comic operas!",1145750400,5,1014,4.7371428571428575
1981963,5,B00019G8EW,"After watching a number of opera videos now, this is the first that simply overwhelmed me with it's enthusiasm and love of the stage.  John Rawnsley was incredible as the playful, mischevious, witty Figaro.  I subsequently recognized him in ""Les contes d'Hoffmann"" (The Tales of Hoffmann) / Pretre, Domingo, Royal Opera Covent Garden (1981) available on Amazon, as one of the fellows in the opening tavern sequence.  (Quite a good dvd as well, if you want a recommendation.) I hope to see Mr. Rawnsley in more starring roles.  Having seen a few stodgy, dark, ungenerous and inapropriately costumed Wagner dvds, this one made me give opera a second chance.  Rossini is my new hero as well, of course.

Rawnsley's ""Largo al Factotum"" was excerpted for a DVD on great opera solos, which it certainly deserved.

8008614,4,B00019G8EW,"Great performance. I wish, for children having their first experience with ""The Barber,"" the subtitles were more frequent. My grandchildren followed a score with the Martin translation, so that was just fine. I loved the singers, but my heart remembered Roberta Peters and Robert Merrill. I know Rosina was written for a mezzo, but there is nothing like watching a gorgeous coloratura, such as Peters, having a ball with the role.",1434672000,,430,5.070422535211268

8008618,3,B00019G8EW,"It is so hard to purchase operas!  I want to enjoy the full presentation, not just the musical proficiency.  This one was a mix.  I could have used a lot more subtitles.  Don Bartolo was an arrogant older man, but not a ridiculous character (that was interesting).  On the other hand, Figaro was a bit (deliberately) ridiculous.  The singing was good, but can't compare to the more recent bel canto of Juan Diego Flores and Joyce DiDonato.",1307318400,4,439,4.636363636363637
8008619,3,B00019G8EW,"I'm omitting a star for each miscast baritone in this opera.

The staging is innovative.  The orchestra is sublime.  The set is pleasing with its view of the city behind the room in question.  Rosina is captivating and engaging, visually and vocally.  Basilio is a hoot, a good-looking man who dirties up nicely and plays the homicidal maniac of character assassination with comic glee. Almaviva is a sweet-voiced lyric tenor capable of both of ardour and light runs.

Unfortunately, the title role itself is miscast.  So is the villain.  it would have been a much better production on the whole if the singers playing Figaro and Bartolo had switched roles.

 John Rawnsley is a wonderful Rigoletto, but vocally, he's just not a Figaro.  He's a dramatic baritone, whereas Figaro, with all his runs, really needs to be a lyric.  Rawnsley overpowers Cossotti in ""All'idea di quel metallo"" and completely fails to keep pace with Maria Ewing in ""Dunqu io son""; all his fast notes turn to mud, and Figaro really has too many fast notes to let that slide.  This role demands that rare thing, a baritone capable of clear, light, quick runs--such as Claudio Desderi.

Meanwhile, Claudio Desderi has a beautiful voice and good agility (not to mention diction), but he is not a Bartolo.  He is looks too fresh-faced (I'm guessing he was about 35 at the time),  too good-looking except for a bit of a paunch, too benign, and far too melodious to be believable as this character.  In fact, the role is staged to make Bartolo something of a softie--his response to ""La Calunnia"" is not so much impatience as repugnance--but this man would never try to force his unwilling ward to marry him in the first place.  Bartolo should really be more loud and blustery--characteristics amply shown by John Rawnsley.

What were they thinking?

Oh well, too late now.  I would advise renting or borrowing this one first, and only buying it if you can live with the defects described above.  Luckily for me, I borrowed it from my local library.",1258675200,3,2018,4.771676300578035
