8516352,2,B007GI18TG,"I can do a ""cut/paste"" of my review on ""David Bowie: The Calm Before the Storm.""  I gave it 2 stars because I cannot ""hate"" anything Bowie, however it is not recommended as a buy.  If you find a used, cheap copy maybe... It is narrated and has interviews with people, many of which are not really big Bowie fans.  All the same it's maybe interesting if you can find it cheap enough.  The thing to know is these are being reproduced and packaged to look differently.  If you see ""David Bowie - The Final Changes"" which is a two DVD set that is slickly packaged -- this is the exact same DVD as the "" one entitled, ""David Bowie 1976-1979"" in that packaged set.  Completely different covers --appears to be different companies but the EXACT same DVD.  So just know what you're buying.  As a fan, I didn't learn anything I didn't know.",1466294400,2,831,4.35064935064935

By

Rob Jones

The Bowie in Berlin DVD traces the period surrounding probably the most fertile years of the recently deceased rock god. 1969 kick started the Bowie buoyancy as he transformed himself from just another folk pop artist in to a Space Oddity sensation. From that elevation it was onwards through other phases heading towards the monumental Ziggy Stardust and then soul boy come Thin White Duke era.  The creativity was evident as David Bowie morphed from 60s wannabe to 70s wonder!
A lead part as an alien in the Man who fell to Earth movie had the man born David Robert Jones shift gears. This androgynous idol was also drawn towards the aural adventure apparent in Germany. Bowie packed his bags and Iggy Pop joined him for what was to prove to be a successful stint in Berlin. These pop pioneers sought to clean up their acts while taking their respective careers in new directions. It certainly worked for Iggy who with the assistance of David made some of his most memorable music.
Meanwhile, Bowie as per usual used his skills to hone in on key players such as Kraftwerk and the underground stars of the krautrock scene. The magpie mechanics of the Brixton boy was to score fresh praise and personnel such as Tony Visconti, Brian Eno and Robert Fripp played roles in another new and exciting Bowie chapter.
An era of electro experimentation blended with an already pertinent ability to create a  premier pop/rebel rock mix enabled alternative album aplomb to flourish across the years 1976-1979. As a result the remarkable records: Low, Heroes and Lodger surfaced and in turn stamped their phenomenal fare upon the musical world.
Associates, analysts, affecters and admirers unveil the details surrounding these renowned studio triumphs-and, once again the brilliance of Bowie comes to the fore.
As 2016 opened the life of Bowie ended-and, the great man is sorely missed! To soften this hammer blow we can rejoice in a sublime sonic style and dexterous documentary delights such as Bowie in Berlin also present monumental memories!

8516356,5,B007GI18TG,"This documentary covers the trilogy of records Bowie did with Eno in Berlin in the late 1970s. Not only does it discuss the tracks, but it does touch upon the works of Bowie previous to it and his state of mind prior to their creation. One of the highlights was an interview with German musician Michael Rother. While Bowie was a fan of Rother, their potential collaberation was sabatoged by Bowie's management.. Each Bowie and Rother were told separately that the other was unavailable. This Stopped what might have been a great collaberation between two incredible talents. I hope Bowie and Rother still work together in the future. RCA can not stop it this time.
Even though Rother was bypassed from these recordings, they still represent a unque set of musical pieces in the history of Bowie and pop music in general. The story of their creation deserves to be told. Recommended  for fans of Bowie, Electronica, and rock historians.",1363392000,6,936,4.85
8516357,2,B007GI18TG,"I've just finished watching this DVD and it has indeed been released under another title several years ago.  The program is very dull, with little in the way of visuals.  There are some clips from an old Bowie audio interview, from which some interesting comments were selected.  I found the few minutes with Michael Rother from Neu! to be of interest.  There's also a soft-spoken fellow who at least demonstrates some care and consideration in his commentary and observations.  The other people here are ""critics"" and generally offer their opinions, which aren't worth much.  Very little information is conveyed in the program, so I feel like I didn't learn too much about Bowie's work in this period, just a few things.

Some of the video consists of audio and video clips to other artists, including one of the Moody Blues (simply because they happened to use a Mellotron, which was something a bit like the Chamberlain that Bowie and Eno used to make synthetic samples... but really this had nothing to do with the Moody Blues, so why show their video?)

There is an extra, short segment of the critics weighing in on their feelings about Bowie's post-Berlin career, with only the soft-spoken fellow offering anything interesting to think about.

The main program ends with some look at Bowie's 1995 re-meeting with Eno: ""Outside.""  Mostly the critics find it boring, but give them props for giving it a go.

All in all, I'd say this could be edited down to a decently interesting half-hour program.  As it is, I'd have to say it is not worth your time.",1355875200,12,1557,4.768656716417911
