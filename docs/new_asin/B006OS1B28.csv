5011010,5,B006OS1B28,"Richard Tyson (Black Hawk Down, Something About Mary, Kindergarten Cop) as Johnny Dunn gives the performance of his career as an NFL star who owns an isolated town in the high desert of Arizona. Dunn's life is forever changed when his young nephew comes to live with him.  This is a heartrending and finely nuanced film.  The cast includes a fantastic Danny Trejo (Heat, Grindhouse) who goes far away from his usual tough guy role and plays a simple and sympathetic man.  It's also a pleasure to see 3-Time Academy Award Nominee Diane Ladd (Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Wild at Heart) return to the big screen.  There are great moments of comedy mainly from David Della Rocco (Boondock Saints) who plays the town grill master.  5-Time Grammy Winner BJ Thomas (Hooked on a Feelin, Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song) is superb as the town doctor and saloon singer.  Thomas sings a few new tracks in this film and his voice is as pure as it was when he sang the Academy Award winning song ""Raindrops Keep Fallin on my Head"" from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

This is a film that you should watch with your family.  It runs the gamut of emotions.  Jake's Corner is optimistic and implores all of us as humans to ""keep on keeping on""...  I recommend people ""keep on seeing"" this film.",1266451200,3,1290,4.593886462882096
5011011,4,B006OS1B28,"Jake's Corner is a very enjoyable movie, especially when I realized that I had been to the REAL Jake's Corner which is an old Stage Coach Stop just northeast of Phoenix.  It is still in operation and is just like it is depicted in the movie, comfortable and homey with good food.  Richard Tyson and Diane Ladd were very good but it is a young actor from Phoenix that steals the show.  It is good family entertainment with family values at heart thanks to Jeff Santo. As always, B. J. Thomas does a great job with the music soundtrack.  I highly recommend it!",1266364800,4,558,4.388349514563107
5011062,3,B006OS1B28,Good feel good story.  In the beginning of the movie the young boy is referred to as 5 years old.  I believe they meant to say 5th grade.  The movie was good but won't win awards for acting. The ending has a religious twist that I didn't expect from the flow of the movie.  The scenery of the area was the best part.  The Roosevelt Lake area is beautiful!,1409788800,,355,4.086956521739131

5011065,4,B006OS1B28,"I bought this movie because BJ Thomas was in it,I wish he had been in every scene,The premise of the movie was what I found odd,-SPOILER- parents and son are in an accident ,parents die,Uncle refuses to tell the son his parents are dead,and gets the people that live in the  little town he lives in too lie to the boy as well,They're confused I'm confused,,odd movie.",1377734400,,367,4.477611940298507
5011066,3,B006OS1B28,The movie wasn't to bad. Dragged on in a few places. I live 13 miles from Jake's Corner and was impressed with the correct directions they gave for where Scottsdale was and Payson.,1373846400,,180,4.484848484848484

5011069,4,B006OS1B28,"Jake's Corner was an inspiration movie out of a vist from Jeff Santos (Son of Cub's Star Ron Santos).  The Storyline if good with colorful characters.  The music selections, many from B.J. Thomas who sings Rock'n Roll Lullaby and When the Hero Dies.  This DVD has a special segment specifically on B.J. Thomas and his work on the film to include site filming and the aforementioned songs.

Overall, great entertainment and good storyline.",1295049600,3,438,4.958904109589041
5011070,5,B006OS1B28,"This is a very heartwarming movie and the characters are entertaining. For those of us who have driven in the area where the movie was filmed, it is kinda neat. It is a ""safe"" movie for all members of the family to enjoy. There is humor mixed amongst movie, my favorite reference is to The University of Arizona having a Heisman trophy winner.",1289606400,,343,4.4603174603174605
5011071,5,B006OS1B28,"Filmed in Tonto Basin, Arizona which shows the historical site with a heart-warming story that shows caring and love from several types of characters.  It has humor, and has some good guy bad guy examples for youth.  We stayed in this area during the winter months and it gave us fond memories of the area and the versatile folks that visit Jakes corner.",1283212800,2,354,4.603174603174603

8502164,3,B006OS1B28,"This started out a little hokey, but we go to Jake's Corner a lot when we are out riding our Harley, we know some of the people who are in the movie, so of course we had to get it! It turned out to be such a great story, and a great movie! Don't let the first 10-15 minutes deter you from watching. You will be glad you stuck it out!",1440633600,,333,3.704225352112676

8502168,3,B006OS1B28,"This is a loving film. No guts and blood. A bar Caf where some misfits ran the place on the Arizona boarder. It's a film about people taking care of each other.  Richard Tyson is a soft spoke man who cares for the group and takes care of his small nephew , whose parents are killed in  car accident.  He remembers back when his own parents died in a car crash and all these feelings well up and tries to protect the boy by not telling the boy they had died. This eventually, fails and the nephew  runs off to see his parents in another town,,... then, the cash is on.
I give this  film a three star rating.",1434499200,,606,4.0588235294117645
8502169,5,B006OS1B28,"This movie was heartwarming and Jeff Santo did an exceptional job as the Director, I loved the way he demonstrated warmth with the people from a small town in Jakes Corner. I feel that Richard Tyson took on the role of Johnny Dunn and nailed it. I had the opportunity to meet Richard on the set and took a picture of him with Jeff Santos. I want to take the time to give a shout out to Hollywood Heard for being humble with the crowds during the filming. Richard was one of the most down to earth actors you could ever meet. I was very impressed with how he took his role professionally and never once shut out his fans. I loved B.J Thomas music he was awesome. I found Danny Trejo very comical and refreshing in his character as Clint. Colton Rodgers was great as Spence. All in all its a movie I would recommend to anyone looking for a family movie. I enjoyed this movie and I just can't say enough. I thank Ebay for the opportunity in purchasing the DVD.",1426118400,2,957,4.2349726775956285
