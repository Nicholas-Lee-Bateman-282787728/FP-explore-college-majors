8015202,3,B0001NBLWC,"GREEN EYES (1934) opens w/ a costume party gone wrong, when the host is found dead, w/ three stab wounds in his back! With his granddaughter (Shirley Grey) as a handy suspect, the police believe they've quickly solved the crime. Obviously, this would result in an extremely short movie! So, the cops end up w/ a huge house full of suspects. The bulk of the movie is the grilling of the guests by Inspector Crofton (John Wray). While it's not bad, anyone expecting a fast paced film, populated by oddball characters spouting snappy dialogue, could be disappointed. Still, the story is interesting enough, and gets sewn up nicely...",1516492800,,630,4.842592592592593
8015203,5,B0001NBLWC,"Great 30s whodunit that starts a bit silly and slow but stick with it and you'll be glad you did. Movies from any era are chancy if they're good or bad but I liked this one and although some of the mystery is predictable, at least for me the ending was a complete surprise.",1515974400,,273,4.074074074074074
8015204,3,B0001NBLWC,"The thirties was a dynamic decade where films turned form stilted and simple to dynamic with depth. This is a film that was made in the transition. At first you think it is too simple with a hokey sound track. Then you get wrapped up in the story and find that this is a great short and to the point who done it. The film is black and white. It sort of has that Charlie Chan feel.

The story is a screen play that has the look of a stage play. It is based on a novel ""The Murder of Steven Kester"" By H. Ashbrook. Jean Kester is in the process if eloping with Michael Tracy. So people will not follow them they cut the phone lines and everyone's distributor wires. Now Jean's ruthless grandfather is found disposed of. It looks mighty suspicious. The house is full of people that were invited to a costume party. The police gat little cooperation from any of the guests. Before the day is over it will look like everyone had motive and opportunity. We may even find a few more deaths.

What part do Green eyes play in the movie?",1504483200,,1027,4.208121827411167
8015205,4,B0001NBLWC,"A fancy dress party ends in MURDER most foul (the victim was brutally stabbed three times and shoved in a closet).  Considering the victim's vast age and ill health, the murder might be misconstrued as a favor.  The victim was rich and uncompromising in his views, to know him was to hate him, practically everyone at the party had reasons enough to want him dead.  He reveled in shady deals and ruining lives.  One of his favorite pastimes was buying off his granddaughter's ill-suited suitors.  ""She has bad taste in men, just like her mother!!!""  (Claude Gillingwater, as the murder victim Steven Kester, is only viewed in a flashback.)  Most everyone accused is snotty and combative towards the gruff Inspector Crofton (John Wray).  His investigation is hampered and helped by a carefree writer (Charles Starrett as Michael Tracy) not opposed to pocketing clues he happens to find first.  Along the way, there's a great sum of money that goes missing, a new unsigned Will pops up, the servants are equally peculiar and suspicious, and there's mention of some bad doings down in Mexico.  Accusations fly in all directions.  People are caught saying incriminating things at all the wrong times.
I found it quite fun if not a little creaky.  But it's a product of 1934 so some leeway must be given to the style of the time.  The transfer is passable.  I thought it was a very amusing diversion and something I'm happy to include in my collection.  I love old black and white movies.",1434067200,,1483,4.76078431372549
8015206,2,B0001NBLWC,"ALPHA VIDEO offers bargain priced, often hard-to-find vintage movies that are ideal for those willing to skip DVD extras. Their transfers show no evidence of restoration, so quality varies from one title to the next, with ""fair to good"" being the average.

Not sure what the significance is of the Oriental face on ALPHA's cover art for GREEN EYES.

This Poverty Row murder mystery fails on many levels. Most egregious is John Wray's investigating cop. He hammers every interviewee (suspect, if you will) as if a member of his own family was the victim. This heavy-handed tactic goes on interminably. If I was being harrassed like that I wouldn't even tell Wray my own name. He rachets it back later, but by then you can't stand seeing him on screen.

Crime scene work is laughably inconsistent. The murder weapon in Steven Kester's death is found, a letter opener, and it's passed from one hand to another without concern for fingerprints, yet later a pistol next to a ""suicide"" victim is carefully picked up by Wray with a handkerchief. Hmmm.

When dull as an elbow ""hero"" Charles Starrett set himself up as the next murder victim, I kept hoping the bad guy would succeed. Shirley Grey is more watchable in any number of John Wayne 'B' westerns (or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-HURRICANE-EXPRESS/dp/B000HXDEWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE HURRICANE EXPRESS</a>) than she is here. We'll be generous and blame a bad script. Miss Grey retired from films in 1936, to concentrate on her third marriage. Her post Hollywood life was a sad one.

Despite ""Green Eyes"" being from my favorite cinematic era, the early 1930s, I cannot in good faith recommend this 68 minute eternity.

8015207,1,B0001NBLWC,"I thought I had seen some really bad movies in my many years of watching (and mostly enjoying) Poverty Row films. But I will have to say that ""Green Eyes"" wins the dubious ""Whoopie Cushion Award"" for being the worst Poverty Row flick I've ever suffered through.

This plodding, stagy film is full of poor acting, endless dialogue, and almost no action. Charles Starrett, years away from his Durango Kid days at Columbia, is very annoying as a wisecracking crime novelist. He follows the dull and totally boring police inspector around who is trying to determine who killed the miserly owner of the mansion where a costume party is taking place.

Shirley Grey sleepwalks through her role as the spoiled young relative of the old miser who threatened to cut her off in his will if she doesn't stop throwing his money away in pursuit of her wild lifestyle. She tells him that he can threaten all he wants, but she is not going to cut back on her spending. Shortly after that, he is found stabbed to death in a closet. Did Shirley commit the crime, or was it one of a long list of partygoers subjected to endless, dull interviewing by the police inspector?

""Green Eyes"" is one of those films that fails to generate any interest. It was filmed at Universal City as the opening credits proudly announce, so the sets look more expensive than the usual Poverty Row film. Aside from that, there's nothing else on the screen worth watching.",1316304000,,1431,4.625984251968504
8015208,2,B0001NBLWC,"This somewhat less than rewarding production is based closely upon a novel by Harriette Ashbrook: ""The Murder Of Steven Kester"", to a point of its inclusion of substantial swatches of Ashbrook's stilted dialogue, but since the original book remains safely confined within a rather narrow spectrum of sleuthing utilized by the English writer, it can be no surprise that the film is also dull and generally predictable.  Action opens briskly with assistant director Melville Shyer, who also contributes the script, effectively leading a congregation of extras during a lively costume party sequence, this festivity organized at the home of wealthy Steven Kester by his granddaughter Jean (Shirley Grey) as a diversion to facilitate her unobstructed elopement with beau Cliff Miller (William Bakewell).  Here the pace of the film begins to flag as journeyman director Richard Thorpe mishandles the tempo following discovery of Steven Kester's corpse, decorated with stab wounds, and a homicide investigation then begins under the supervision of Captain (or Chief, at times Inspector) Crofton (John Wray) who fails to acknowledge any recognizable form of correct investigative police procedures as he browbeats a large contingent of available suspects.  Needless to report, many of these latter have apparent motives to have committed the slaying, and if Crofton neglects one of them, a meddlesome crime novelist, Michael Tracy (Charles Starrett), a recurring lead character as ""Spike Tracy"" in the publications of Ashbrook, is on hand to abet the detective.  Viewers, however, will not require similar assistance, due to the story hardly being abstruse enough to challenge most armchair detectives.  Production values for this low tier Chesterfield Pictures item are expectedly paltry, but some performances from players are to be valued, in particular a brief turn by Lloyd Whitlock, and neatly developed characterizations from Grey and Dorothy Revier as female suspects.  Director Thorpe, ever respectful of his cast members, and especially of those whom are stage trained, leads with a loose rein.",1140134400,,2097,5.5375
8015209,3,B0001NBLWC,"A rich 70-year-old man is murdered during a costume party he is hosting and the killer is sought.

 GREEN EYES is an old (1934) murder mystery that talks way too much and flashbacks way too little.  It was directed by the competent Richard Thorpe, who's unfortunate claim-to-fame is that he was the first director on THE WIZARD OF OZ, fired a few weeks after shooting began when his work proved unsatisfactory.

  Among the suspects are the murdered man's granddaughter Jean Kester, played by pretty young Shirley Grey.  The 20-something Grey would drop out of pictures in a couple of years, presumably against her wishes.  Another suspect is wise-acre crime novelist Michael Tracy, played by Charles Starrett, who would appear in scores of b-movies up through the 1950s, most notably as the Durango Kid in many b-westerns.

  GREEN EYES is an okay mystery that would have benefited from brisker pacing, a bit less dialogue and some less obvious `surprises' - I'm no great shakes at such things and I figured a thing or two out way too early. The transfer print quality is fair, with some wear evident on almost every frame.  Some vital dialogue is missing, lost when the film jumps because of missing film frames.",1111017600,5,1214,4.839805825242719
