8648591,1,B00B8H1V2A,"Very disappointed in this. Compared to the season 1 and season 2 DVD box sets I have, this season 9 set is terrible. So bad, in fact, that I honestly believe this is a pirated copy being sold. Firstly, there is no top menu for these DVDs, meaning you have to fastforward through previosuly watched episodes to get to new ones. Second, the image quality itself is poor, so much so that the text displayed onscreen is horribly blurred, considering this is from 2012. Third, the packaging: the disks included have a plain blue background, unlike the very elaborate disk design of seasons 1 and 2. Looking closely at the disks, the blue background printed on them isn't even the same shade of blue. It also doesnt include an overview pamphlet of the episodes in the box itself.

Im really sad I missed the return window for this product, because I would return this without a second thought.
Ill include pictures of my comparisons.

EDIT: at the bottom of the product description, Amazon writes: ""When sold by Amazon.com, this product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media."" This is why the quality reflects a pirated DVD. I stand by my original review and WOULD NOT recommend anyone to spend this kind of money on this home-burned DVD.",1510876800,,1249,4.724770642201835
