8758441,3,B01EG1R9OI,"This is a two disc, no extras, films of Skull Forest and Devil's Farm.

Skull Forest is a cheaply made slasher film which features Lisa Neeld's bare chest which is worth the 3 star ranking.

The second film is a terrible found footage film and should not be viewed. If you have seen Skull Forest, don't waste your money like I did. Only worth buying if you want to get Skull Forest and can't get it cheaper as a single. Yes, seriously Devil's Farm is that bad...almost so bad it is good.",1524182400,,487,4.282608695652174
