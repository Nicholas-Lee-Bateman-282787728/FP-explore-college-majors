8624652,5,B000MGBQIW,"Tangerine Dream, from TGR, is a film that represents 10 years of broken down trucks, whiskey bottles and the most insane, down and dirty skiing you have ever laid eyes on. This is a story of TGR's roots, the outlaw athletes and the ragged lifestyle that has kept this posse's dream and way of life alive.

The movement is stronger than ever with Nobis accomplishing the impossible in Alaska, the Olenicks taking their park skills to AK, the ever so talented, Jeremy Jones straight-lining 50 degree spine walls, Sage fusing style and big mountain and Dana Flahr emerging as a dominant force in skiing.

This vagabond tale will take you through the lifestyle of skiing and the passion that continues to change the face of the sport. This film will lead you on a road trip through India, Turkey, Switzerland, France, Alaska, Aspen, Utah, Montana, California and the infamous Jackson Hole.

This film is a must for your collection! Anyone who wouldn't give this film a raving review and five stars is simply clueless....

Oh... and let's not forget the music! I can't be the first person to suggest this, but they should make an audio CD every year or include it with the DVD....",1243728000,2,1175,4.717073170731707
