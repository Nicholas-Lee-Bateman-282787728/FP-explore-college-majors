5750665,5,B00CX74O28,"Whether you are expecting or have already delivered your baby you need these videos!  Leah is highly regarded and is an expert in pre and postnatal fitness.  I have used both the pre and postnatal Dia Method techniques and am so thankful to have found them.  With these techniques, not only was I able to have a successful VBAC delivery but also quickly returned to my pre-pregnancy size and healed my diastasis!  These techniques provided the knowledge I needed to safely work out with this condition and not worry about making it worse.  Ladies please note, diastasis is very common as a result of pregnancy and is often not diagnosed unless you ask your doctor to check for it.  Stop struggling with other work outs, this one will help you get your sexy body back fast!",1373155200,4,772,4.639705882352941
5750666,5,B00CX74O28,"This product is absolutely a MUST HAVE for any new mom.  I have been working out with the Dia Method program and I'm really seeing results - my abs are flatter than pre-pregnancy!  Here is what I love about this product:

1. It is a workout system - you get a total of 9 DVDs, including 5 full workouts, the essential 10-minutes flat (the secret to the flat abs), and additional tips and information! This is way more than what you would get from something like Tracy Anderson who has one dvd, one workout you have to repeat over and over.  With this system, you get a variety of workouts for a full week (or longer) PLUS all the extras.  The workouts are more than just abs, they are for full body.  Leah knows what muscles we moms use most with our babies and the resulting issues (example: the breastfeeding hunch back), so she designs moves to counteract (example: the chest opener).  She also knows that it's not just the stomach that is affected by pregnancy - somehow the hips, butt and thighs seem to expand, so she focuses on those areas too.

2. You learn the secret to having truly flat abs - core compressions.  The best part is you can incorporate these into your daily routine and literally do them anywhere - on the subway, in the shower, at your desk. I've taught all my friends (pregnant or not!) how to do these themselves.

3. It feels like Leah is your own personal trainer - the videos are all shot in one long shot (not edited together), so she is talking right to you and working out right there with you, giving encouragement, explaining the exercises and making common corrections. She gives modifications and variety using real moms as her workout buddies.

4. I love the tips!  The system is designed for moms with information that we need, from working out safely and effectively post-pregnancy, to nutrition suggestions, labor / c-section recovery tips and more.  We get the benefit of all of Leah's experience specializing in training pregnant and post-pregnant women for the last 10+ years.  I love how she understands that moms need to multi-task, so every single exercise she teaches incorporates the core compressions - why wouldn't we want to workout our abs with every move?!

5. It is based on science and the science actually makes sense.  If you check out the product's website (thediamethod.com), you can learn about why it's critical to focus on diastasis (the ""Dia"" of Dia Method). The diastasis is what causes the post-pregnancy ""pooch"", and no amount of working out can cure the pooch - you need these exercises!

6. You don't need any special equipment!  You get the resistance band, and while she does incorporate weights, you could just use cans of soup if you don't have weights.  Some other workout DVDs I've seen seem to require multiple sets of weights and benches.

7. I love the digital option.  I now can access it from anywhere, in hotel rooms when I'm traveling, or on the weekend at the grandparent's house.

If you have any friends who are pregnant or recently had a baby, this product or its companion system,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dia-Method-BellyGuard-Prenatal-Fitness-System/dp/B00CXT9BKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dia Method: BellyGuard Prenatal Fitness System</a>, make an excellent shower gift. It truly is a MUST HAVE!",1372809600,22,3346,4.9375
5750667,5,B00CX74O28,"I have been doing the videos and nutrition plan for 6 weeks and i love it! The exercise videos are awesome! I previously did the Tracy Anderson post pregnancy but i thought the video was too long, so most times i didn't do it because i didn't have the time and i found parts of it near impossible to do. The Dia Method videos are easy to follow, just under 30 minutes for each one so sometimes i even land up doing them late at night (the only time i have a moment to myself). I definitely feel like i've worked my body even though it's short and my favorite part of all... there's a countdown to each exercise so you know when the agony is going to end! ;)

I definitely recommend it to anyone who is short on time but wants to see results!",1372723200,15,741,4.075342465753424
5750668,5,B00CX74O28,"I started The Dia Method post natal system two weeks ago and I'm already amazed. Leah starts you off with a non intimidating core strengthening workout which is so easy to commit to. I had a very difficult delivery and I was able to start building back my abs immediately. You then add additional workouts as you feel stronger. I couldn't find anything like this after my first baby so I was thrilled that The Dia Method is now available. The extra tips, newsletter, and nutrition plan are excellent resources as well. Unlike other exercise programs this one is for every mom and addresses our specific concerns!",1371254400,5,612,4.728971962616822
5750669,5,B00CX74O28,Could not believe how well the exercises worked - the instruction was very easy to follow and the results were remarkable - I can now fit into pants that were too small before the pregnancy!!,1371254400,5,191,4.485714285714286
5750670,5,B00CX74O28,"I was skeptical, especially since I've heard diastisis recti can only be fixed through surgery. However, in my attempt to avoid surgery and the recovery I decided to give this a try. I've been doing the 10 minute abs (I do 20 minutes now) and another CD (I like numbers 5, 6 and 7 the best so I rotate those every morning) for 7 weeks now.  My stomach no longer sticks out and actually feels tighter, plus my clothes fit so much better now! Definitely recommend this. It's important to really focus on what she's saying though and bring your belly back constantly every exercise. When I first did the DVDs I thought they were way too easy, then I really listened to what she was saying, focusing on technique, and realized they're VERY good, specific workouts. Couldn't be happier!",1443312000,14,781,4.578571428571428
5750671,5,B00CX74O28,I've been using to for only 1 week and I can feel my abs getting tight and sore in a good way.  Can't wait to see the progress after 6 weeks!,1430697600,5,141,3.5483870967741935
5750672,5,B00CX74O28,This was recommended to me by a friend. I ordered it and have been doing it for 4 weeks now. I have seen good results and am so glad I tried it. I would recommend this and I have to many friends.,1417737600,4,195,3.6666666666666665
5750673,5,B00CX74O28,"I really feel like I'm getting a workout with the DVD's that incorporate weight lifting. I sweat a lot for the short amount of time that I'm working out. I also really appreciate the ""Everyday Moves"" DVD, so that I can get up, lie down and pick up things without stressing out my ab muscles. I've only been doing it for a week, so time will tell if my diastasis closes and my abs become flatter. The other thing that I really like is the countdown, so you know how much time you have left with each exercise and the DVD as a whole. The DVD's go by fast, since they're about a half hour. Compared with P90X I like this much better. It incorporates a Paleo diet (no starchy carbs), which I'm already doing. I will update in a few months or so, to let everyone know how much my diastasis has improved. It's about 2 finger widths a the moment, so I'm hoping to close it. The only thing this set doesn't have is cardio, but lifting weights gets your heart pumping plenty, and simple walk after dinner would do for cardio, especially, if you're trying to take it easy while you're still recovering.",1410393600,4,1092,4.305825242718447
5750674,5,B00CX74O28,Every woman should know about this exercise! I've had 2 children and thanks to this method I've reduced that post partum bulge more in a month than I did between having the 2 kids- and I tried!,1404691200,6,193,4.243243243243243
5750675,5,B00CX74O28,"My kids are 15 months apart.  Which means I never lost the baby weight, AND I had no time to work out.  My friend told me about the Dia Method and she looked amazing! I was 2 years post-pardum and no matter what I did I just couldn't lose those last 10 pounds.  I joined a gym, did 2 different cleanses, started running, skiied when possible, but NOTHING got that weight off.  And I had all this weird fat on my back and sides.  I didn't feel attractive anymore, and I couldn't wear half my pants.  I thought, ""What have I got to lose""?  And it didn't seem that expensive either.  Cheaper than yoga classes plus a babysitter!  I didn't know there was a nutrition aspect to it, but after reading through all the info I realized I needed do change my diet a bit too.  I really followed the food and workout suggestions to a T.  I found it very easy to eat healthy (with a bit of dark chocolate every night) and did the workouts as she suggests in the weekly plan.  I stopped doing cardio the first 2 weeks as she suggests, but then added in running and biking.  This is definitely a low impact workout and (someone else mentioned this) you'll need to add in some cardio if you need it. The low impact was great for me though, as I have a bad back.  Since doing the Dia Method I haven't needed to go to the chiropractor either!  It made my back and core stronger in a safe way!  I found the videos easy to follow and interesting.  I think a lot of at home workouts get boring VERY quickly.  But because there are about 5 different videos I never felt this way. It always felt like I was doing a different workout.  You are working out almost every muscle group in every video.  Some focus on specific muscle groups more but it was definitely a varied workout on each video.  I can't say I noticed a smaller waist immediately.  I noticed other changes first.  My thighs got smaller.  (OMG yay!) My arms started getting nice definition.  My back half got round again.  THEN, I noticed my abs about 6 weeks in.  I had them.  And I had a waist!!  I lost about 1.5 inches on my waist overall, and dropped all the baby weight, PLUS SOME!  I weigh what I weigh when I got married!  I finished The Dia Method 6 months ago, and I'm proud to say I've kept ALL the weight off.  I still do the videos 1 or 2 times a week, plus I added in the gym.  If I can't make it to the gym, then I do an extra video.  And I'm smart about how I eat now too!!!  Thank you Dia Method!  I feel like my old self again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1393632000,9,2499,4.122661122661123
5750676,3,B00CX74O28,very simple and easy workout.  poor diet recommendations/suggestions for vegetarians. pricey item for amount of useful information provided. nice simple combination core and upper body moves.,1378425600,6,191,6.346153846153846
5750677,5,B00CX74O28,"A great gift for yourself or for moms or moms-to-be.
Leah's a knowledgeable and accessible guide, and I love that it's a fitness system designed to fit into a busy woman's life and yet effectively help her feel fit and empowered during and after pregnancy.
I like the variety of short workouts, and really like using the resistance band.
Highly recommend!",1376611200,5,355,4.836065573770492
5750678,4,B00CX74O28,"I am a very active 27 year old mother of two.  When I began the Dia Method videos a few weeks ago, I was hoping to quickly notice a difference in my abs, and I certainly did!  Within the first week, I noticed a definite tighter waist, with my jeans fitting more loose around the waist as well. The workouts don't provide an intense cardio experience, but I found that they were a great (and short!) addition to my morning run.  Instead of coming home and doing crunches (which I'll never do again), I came home and did the Dia Method videos.  I also did the core compressions throughout the day, and I think that made the biggest difference in tightening my abs. I love the reminder that in whatever exercises we're doing, we should always be focusing on ""belly back.""  It is clear that Leah knows exactly what areas of the body are affected from pregnancy/motherhood, and those areas are targeted to provide the best possible workout.  I also love that committing to the Dia Method made me feel like I was part of a team - with newsletters, a website, nutrition tips and multiple workouts to keep you from getting bored, there's no way you can fail with this method. This Method is for real moms with busy lives, and I believe everyone who has had a baby should make this a part of their workout routine. Thanks Leah for a Great set of workouts!",1374364800,12,1346,4.42914979757085
5750679,3,B00CX74O28,"I am a physically fit mother of 2 (20 months apart). I was very interested in this product when it came out, so I gave it a go quickly and have been doing it for over a month now. I cannot see any visible difference in my abs, but I am sure they are stronger from how much easier the small movements are now. My diastasis is already closed (before starting this workout) and I will explain below how I did that.
First all the PROS:
No doubt this works to close the diastasis separation from pregnancy. I had it with both of my kids. Fortunately I was told about the Tupler Method (similar concept but without a workout DVD) by a physical therapist and also used a splint and girdle afterwards. What I wished post pregnancy for was a DVD workout that stressed the importance of not stretching out my abs. I had to do modified versions of everything. I even asked my OB and she replied that my abs will never be the same and to get over it!
Well, after doing Tupler's version of core compressions, I was mercifully back into all of my clothes within 2 months after BOTH babies and proudly wear a bikini during the summer.
So on to this workout system:
Her constant refrain is ""belly back"". Well, if I could just have this reminder during ANY workout, that would be helpful in restoring your abs.
These are quick workouts- a must while nursing, and when you have multiple children.
The 10 minute ab DVD is simply sitting and doing core compressions.
She tends to focus on some smaller, stability muscles, which is neat, because my other workouts don't stress those.
Bottom line of the PROS- YES, you can get your abs knitted back together, and this is genius to have a DVD system created around that idea of ""belly back"".
Now onto the CONS:
I don't know about most women, but I do not follow a perfect diet, I eat chocolate, ice cream, and every sort of carb on earth. SOO her nutrition plan is just not going to work for me. I HATE broth. YUCK. So I will never lost all my fat (but I am still quite thin and fit).
I think the DVD system is not well explained. I bought the digital and the DVD versions and I had no idea how to really start, when to do which workout, what each workout worked, etc. I really believe she needs a better intro. Still now, I only alternate days between the strictly ab workout and the other ones.
And now to the largest complaint: NO CARDIO (very little). I am not a runner or cardio freak, but I need to torch calories after having a baby! I have to alternate these workouts with a high intensity workout such as Jillian Michaels or Lindsay Brinn's Post Preg Boot Camp (HIGHLY recommended). I just never felt like I had worked out after these DVDs.

ALL IN ALL- this is great for anyone who needs her abs back together, especially women who have NO weight to lose. However, if you are going to lose weight quickly after baby, then you will have to add cardio from another source. I would recommend this product, but only with the above disclaimer. Any fitness enthusiast would tell you that it is not strenuous.",1374364800,68,3039,4.350352112676056
8587109,4,B00CX74O28,"I really enjoy these workouts - they are the right amount of intensity I find for post-partum recovery (I have tried other post-natal dvds and I wouldn't be able to complete them even in my best pre-baby shape!). The dvd that covers breathing method was particularly helpful for me; in 5 minutes they explain a concept that I've struggled to grasp in 5+ years of yoga and other physical training. The set also comes with a recommended meal plan for faster results, but I haven't used it; I don't believe in cutting whole swaths of food groups out of my diet. The fitness band is of alright quality, though you can find better ones for relatively cheap from other suppliers.",1503792000,2,673,4.616666666666666

8587111,4,B00CX74O28,"I ordered the Dia method after my obgyn recommended it following my third pregnancy. I'm happy to report that after a month and a half of doing the Dia method (along with eating paleo), I've lost 3 inches in both my waist and mommy pooch area (just under my belly button). I'm not sure if it's just my body slowly going back to normal or this workout (I'm about 3 months postpartum), but so far something is working! I do wish it came with a more structured calendar, something like Day 1: do this disc, Day 2: do this other disc, and so on. I also think it's a little expensive for what it is, but in the end it's a lot less than joining a gym. I'd recommend for mamas that want to get their tummies back in shape!",1491782400,11,715,4.114285714285714

8587116,4,B00CX74O28,"After having two kids in less than 3 years I was looking for a work out that I could do safely postpartum. After my first child I didn't start working out until 9 months after due to just feeling exhausted and having no time.  With my second child I enlisted more help and while it is still hard to find time I liked this work out because it is short (the minimum is 10 minutes a day) and is low impact. One of the complaints I have seen is that this workout isn't intense enough.  I think this is intentional--I started working out 6 weeks after a c-section and did not want a super intensive workout. I have done P90x, P90x3, T25 etc. and while I think these systems are good, they are not what some one should be doing post-abdominal surgery. I'm in the medical profession and although you are ""cleared"" for normal activity realize that your abdominal muscles do not completely heal for many months (doubly so if you have had a c-section). I wanted something that would strengthen my core muscles without concern for developing a hernia.  It was also great to know you CAN work your abs without crunches.  In fact after doing this workout and listening to her tips about not bulging your abs I believe you could substitute some of the moves learned in this workout into other workouts and avoid crunches altogether.  Another plus is that there are other moves to tone your arms/legs.  I have been working out for 5 weeks (the first two weeks are very mild--5 minutes a day the first week, then 10 minutes the next week.  After that you incorporate the other workouts into your regimen).  Most of the other workouts are ~25 minutes so this is helpful when you have two kids and work.  I can honestly say I've had big improvements in just 5 weeks--my husband commented that I had gotten my waist back and I can see definition in my abs. It's also nice to ease back into working out before I do some of the more intensive workouts I'm used to as I am not anywhere close to my fitness baseline.  I think my baseline is average fitness (ie. worked out regularly but not doing iron mans or triathlons) and did work out for about 5 months of my pregnancy but at the end I was simply too tired to do anything regularly other than walk. This is NOT cardiointensive so if that's your goal again this is not an appropriate workout for you.  Post pregnancy I got my cardio by going on long walks with the baby.  So if you're looking to be back in shape in 2-3 months I'm not sure this workout is for you--if you're okay with taking things at a slower pace I believe this workout is a good first workout post pregnancy to safely get back in shape. I also liked the tips about c-section massage and moves to incorporate into everyday activities so you don't bulge your abs.  I would recommend this to anyone who has recently had a baby--even those post c-section.",1458345600,22,2852,4.399239543726236
8587117,1,B00CX74O28,"Things to consider -

1.  I bought this for my wife, and while her belly temporarily looked flatter, it instructs you to move in certain ways (for the rest of your life) to avoid undoing the ""progress."" Going the rest of your life never doing a situp because it could reopen the diastasis is Not a solution. It also does nothing to tighten the skin. My wife's diastasis reopened after a few months.
2. If you buy the Dia Method on Amazon, you miss out on the website membership, despite paying the same amount. My wife was able to join the facebook group, but she never got to access the website members area.
3. The creator, Leah, has never had a diastasis.
4. The true solution was a mini tummy tuck. The doctor sewed my wife's diastasis closed, and her abs look great. She's thrilled with the results she could never get from The Dia Method.  The cost was around $5,000, but it was money well spent, versus the money I originally wasted on this nonsense.

Hope this helps someone else.",1448928000,31,988,4.441988950276243
