8307724,5,B001H29FBU,"The choice of hero ships to feature in these 13 fascinating individual documentaries, also available in this edition&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/History-Classics-Hero-Ships/dp/B005ELVCOI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">History Classics: Hero Ships</a>, was clearly constrained by a couple of choices the History Channel made.  First, they wanted a ship to film on.  Thus, all but three of the ships are museum ships that you can visit today.  The three exceptions are the USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58), an active naval vessel at the time of filming, since decommissioned, the USS Enterprise (CVN-65), an active naval vessel at the time of filming, now in the process of decommissioning, and the USS New York (LPD-21), under construction at the time of filming, now commissioned, all namesakes for previous ships that saw more action (though all three modern ships faced their own trials by fire and by sea), DE-413, CV-6, and BB-34, respectively.  USS Laffey (DD-724) is a bit unique in this regard because both she and her sunk in battle predecessor (DD-459) saw extraordinary action.  Second, they wanted to film veterans recounting their experiences.  Thus, all but the USS Constitution saw action in WWII or later, and for her, the History Channel was allowed to film a CPO Heritage Week, in which the Navy's best and brightest CPO Selectees are given the opportunity to learn how to sail her.  This constraint is arguably why other old museum ships like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/USS-Olympia/dp/1591141265/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">USS Olympia</a>, Admiral Dewey's flagship at the Battle of Manila Bay, are left out.

Two of the ships, USS LST-325 and SS Jeremiah O'Brien, are essentially class representatives, used to tell the story of all LST's and Liberty Ships respectively, and that is where I have my only nit to pick with this otherwise excellent collection, the fact that they failed to mention the most heroic Liberty Ship of all, SS Stephen Hopkins, which sank a German surface raider, despite being shot to pieces by its much more powerful opponent:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Action-in-the-South-Atlantic/dp/1889901385/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Action in the South Atlantic</a>.",1450483200,,2338,6.1067073170731705

I never realized how quickly these ship came into and left the service.  short lives.",1386720000,,217,4.684210526315789
8307729,3,B001H29FBU,"The takings are good, the format not so good, but above all the text is high school at best, and gung-ho in the best John Wayne tradition. This is the norm for History Channel. The choice of ships is questionable, some of them never having fought a sea battle, and yet made to seem a ship of great merit, as if they were the USS Constitution or the USS Enterprise.
Good for the eye, if a bit long. As for information, get a book, of which there are many.",1382832000,,454,4.112359550561798
8307730,5,B001H29FBU,"I bought this album for two of my uncles who were in the Navy during WWII.  One made six trips to the beaches at Omaha Beach on D-Day.  Thank heavens he did not end up in the American cemetery at Coleville, France as so many did.  He has enjoyed the videos although they bring back some gut-wrenching memories.  The album is well done.  It was a joy to be ablt to give it to ""two old salts.""",1301788800,,391,4.025974025974026
8307731,5,B001H29FBU,"Having served on an LST in Vietnam it was enjoyable to view the program on the use of the LST in WWII.

Credit is given to this work horse for serving in WWII. Even though it was a rough ride the LST provided a vehicle that carried men, material, fuel, etc. to the battle.

This WWII ship also provided a way to move men, material, fuel, etc. and even more in the Vietnam war.

I salute all who served on an LST.

I will be viewing the rest of the DVD's later and will post a review on them.",1287360000,3,491,3.9292929292929295
8307732,2,B001H29FBU,"This review is of the DVDs, not the show.

Unfortunately, the DVD set is seriously flawed. Amazon lists the aspect ratio as 1.33:1 and technically that is correct. But the DVDs are actually non-anamorphic letterboxed 16:9 matted into a 4:3 frame. Why the History Channel continues to use this outmoded format for their DVD releases is a mystery. Even cheap, direct-to-video DVD releases are in anamorphic format. I can author a disc in anamorphic format on my home PC so it can't be that hard or expensive to do.

If you have an older home theater system, this set being letterboxed may not matter to you but if you have a HDTV with your DVD player connected via HDMI, it is likely that you will not be able to watch this in other than letterbox format without lowering the resolution of your system.

Come on, History Channel, move your DVD releases into the 21st Century.",1261526400,5,873,4.619354838709677
