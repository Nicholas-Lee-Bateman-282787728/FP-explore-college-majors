5108938,3,B007RMQ508,"So there's a casino/bar where some locals are partying, a couple of people in particular are Tom (Grant Bowler, TV's Ugly Betty) and Tori (Evalena Marie, ""Serena and The Ratts"") who get knocked out after a nuclear explosion rocks the town but strangely doesn't flatten the building they are in. They awaken to find that most everyone is dead.... well dead as in the walking dead, there's only a couple of more people alive among them are Jensen (Miko Hughes, ""Mercury Rising"") who bands together with Tori and Tom to try and fend off the hoards of flesh eaters that want to break in and feast.

Sometime later a band of military people come to town to seemingly rescue them, with their leader Ramsey (Lance Reddick, TV's Fringe) and his daughter Tawny Cypress (TV's Heroes) are in charge and well things don't turn out too well once their real motives get revealed. The rest of the movie involves the survivors trying to elude the zombies and escape the town before they get eaten, though it seems like Tori may just be looking out for herself more than anything else.

Director Steve Niles does try for some different take on the zombie franchise, such as zombies actually sleeping (weird and kinda goofy to me) and them getting smarter as time goes on. The ideas in the movie aren't the problem its the budget (which I'm fairly certain was no more than $500,000), especially when any computer effects are used, such as an SUV tipping over in a rushed and silly effect.

The acting isn't all that bad for this type of made for cable movie, even Evalena Marie is decent playing a.... well.... (rhymes with witch, which I do mean with respect as it was the type of role that was written), Miko is good as is Lance and Grant, Tawny also isn't too bad. At least Evalena seems like she could have a good future in Hollywood as she's certainly better than others who just start out in these type of movies.

No its not a perfect film or even something good, but its amusing and acceptable material, I would at the very least rent it, just turn the brain off before hand. ** out of 4 stars.",1345680000,,2084,4.505291005291006
5108939,4,B007RMQ508,"After seeing the ""made for television"" 2012 Zombie Apocalypse, I had little hope for Remains, thinking it was going to have a lot of the same production value; mainly over used and cheesy C.G.I. affects and a thrown together story line with a poorly written script, which would all lead to annoying, clichd characters that were under developed. Well, zombie movie lovers rejoice! The Chiller Channel has got their stuff together and made a durn fine, rooting, tooting zombie movie! Yes, it does have a slight ""made for television"" feel to it, in that there is no gratuitous loads of gore and blood and the intelligent actors don't have ""f-bomb"" diarrhea of the mouth! Some folks like that in their zombie movies, I however prefer a though out and well written story and script! And I got just that with Remains!
Now in other zombie movie reviews I have read where folks are disappointed that the movie didn't add ""something new"" to the zombie genre... sorry, but Remains is not a movie where the zombies ""sparkle"" in the sunlight while line dancing the Macarena ... maybe next time!!! Steve Nile has added a few ""fresh"" twists and turns to the zombie mythology which I liked a lot. In fact, I like Nile's infected cannibals a lot more that some of the ""traditional"" dead undead zombies. Yes, they are fast, but they are not the undead! This movie is not a bunch of ""read between the lines social commentary"" either... it's all about a group of survivors fighting zombies ... some live, some die, some make dumb mistakes and well, no one's character is an over inflated, typical Hollywood wanna-be action hero... the characters were all your average everyday person who was believable and did believable things that were in character. The added prequel bonus material was great too, I just wish it had played as one long segment instead of 3. And with that, here is some negative about the movie... there were a few places where the show stopped,  an ""insert commercial here"" pause which took me out of the film for a brief moment. It would have been nice if the production company had done a tad of editing for the dvd edition! There were also some pacing / story line / plot hole problems that I felt could have been resolved had this been a mini series, or at least been a 2 part movie. We just don't get to see how the characters interact and bond with each other that much... we get little snips but nothing very deep.  And then there is the C.G.I. affects ... they were minimal which was a good thing, but there were 1 or 2 that just screamed C.G.I.!
But all in all, I was pleasantly surprised with this movie! I really, really liked it a lot! The story was great and believable! The actors were wonderful and believable!!! The make-up was top notch and believable! The movie was totally worth my time and money!",1345248000,12,2817,4.576237623762376
5108940,4,B007RMQ508,"This zombie film starts on international ""Peace Day"" when some undisclosed process will neutralize radiation and make nuclear weapons useless. While these sketchy details are televised in the background, Tom (Grant Bowler) and Tori (Evalena ""cleavage"" Marie) go to a bomb shelter to get it on at a Reno hotel casino. When they emerge I expected to see Burgess Meredith looking for his glasses, but instead there is a full blown zombie food riot going on outside. Like ""Dawn of the Dead"" the first rule is to secure the perimeter and eliminate zombie hazards within the safe zone...which isn't that easy as this appears to be the only hotel casino that doesn't have a gun stashed anywhere.

Our non-zombie people group narrows down to four, with one openly gay character. (Guess who dies first because killing off the brother first has become too cliche?) The radioactive zombies require head shots and are a combination of fast moving and foot dragging zombies, whichever suits the mood of the director. They have the unusual characteristic of sleeping while standing up and unlike the standard zombie fare, they do feed off each other. Bites appear to cause infection. At one point they talk about going to Catalina, which made me think of this being a ""Zombie Apocalypse"" prequel...which it isn't...I think.

Tom and Tori are the main characters who have a rocky relationship. There are some CG fire effects that are rather poor, i.e. holding a match in front of a picture, but they don't last long. Good acting performances for a low budget zombie film. The script needed some tightening up. Worth a view for zombie fans.

PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bombs that I recall, but it does have adult language (SOB etc.) sex, no nudity. Evalena Marie sports cleavage for much of the film in her red bra.",1345248000,7,1793,4.852941176470588
5108941,4,B007RMQ508,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting too much from this movie. The last few zombie movies that I've seen have left a bad taste in my mouth, lol...so to speak.. and haven't been very well for movies. Another thing it had going against it was the fact it's a movie from the Chiller Channel. I figured it was going to be like those hokey Sy-Fy movies. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that not only did it not suck but it wasn't at all like those hokey Sy-Fy movies.

Steve Niles' Remains is about a group of survivors that takes refuge in a vacant casino and fights a losing battle against zombies who are growing steadily stronger, smarter and more aggressive by the minute. The movie stars such genre actors such as Lance Reddick(of Fringe), Tawny Cypress(of Heroes), Grant Bowler(of True Blood) and Miko Hughes(of Pet Semetary, Spawn & Wes Craven's New Nightmare).

Steve Niles, as most of you know, wrote 30 Days of Night(which spawned two movies). I'll have to give credit. He came up with some fresh approaches for his zombies(like having them sleep, for one thing).

I really enjoyed Remains. Alot more than I figured I would, truthfully. Great movie, loved it!",1344902400,2,1164,4.696078431372549
5108942,3,B007RMQ508,"I saw this film on Chiller Channel when it first premiered last year on cable.  What attracted me to the film was that there were several genre actors, primarily Miko Hughes from such films as; 'Pet Semetary', 'Wes Craven's New Nightmare' and 'Mercury Rising'.  The performances were genuine and I thought the new twist they put on the classic zombie was interesting.  I used to think if you saw one zombie film then you've seen them all, but adding more to the mythology of well established supernatural creatures is always a great thing to witness.  The concept of having zombies sleep was a vast difference as opposed to the other zombie flicks that have come before i.e. throughout the decade of the 21st century.

5108943,3,B007RMQ508,"Maybe its just because I've watched so many terrible zombie movies that were made with more money and less love, but I thought this was kind of okay. It could have been better, yes. But it was enjoyable. There were a few moments that made no sense, but there were also a few moments where i cringed, and a few moments where i unexpectedly laughed my butt off at something that was SUPPOSED to be entertaining. SO i call that a win in this genre. I believe that this movie is a good example on the positive influence the success of ""The Walking Dead"" TV show is having on networks and studios throwing a couple dimes behind a director with a bit of vision.

Just about the worst zombie movie I've ever seen.  OBVIOUSLY made in about a week for a SyFy ""movie"" (you can tell this because every 23 minutes, it fades to black for a commercial break).

I can't  believe this was written by the same guy who did 30 Days Of Night.  Don't believe the hype.  Sorry.  I love ever zombie movie from Redneck Zombies to Tokyo Zombie, but this one makes those look like masterpieces.

5108949,3,B007RMQ508,"First,
I love zombie movies, sometimes because their well written and acted and sometimes just for escapist fun.
Steve Niles' Remains falls in the latter category.
The idea of having a zombie outbreak on the Vegas Strip is original but fell way short of my expectations because it was neither scary or funny leaving me scratching my head.
The special effects and makeup were almost non existent adding to the disappointment.
The acting was marginal as well but if your looking for a Zombie movie to watch and you have not seen this one then go ahead and check it out.
However I would not recommend adding it to your video library.",1388016000,2,630,4.633928571428571

I caught this move on a cable channel one night and was pleasantly surprised. Is it the scariest, best acted, best written, best shot zombie movie ever made? No. However, it is far from the worst and if you rank it against others with similar budgets it fares well.

Definitely worth a watch and I'll probably end up either buying the DVD or the instant video version and adding it to the library because I'd definitely like to watch it again and I've only seen it on TV the one time.",1379116800,,599,4.292035398230088

5108952,4,B007RMQ508,With being a long time zombie fan I've come to appreciate that not every zombie movie is going to compare to Romeros classics so I keep my expectations in check. With that said I found it to be an entertaining movie with comedic elements not unlike SHAUN OF THE DEAD and perhaps ZOMBIELAND.  Some of the special affects looked downright awful but with the budget they had to work with it could have been far worse. For a low budget zombie movie it was pretty good.

Another film based on another Steve Niles piece, with expected results. This one, which pays tribute to 80s B movie Night of the Comet, sets its action in Las Vegas, and if you've seen a half-dozen random zombie movies, none of that action is going to be unpredictable--you have zombies, you have holed-up survivors, and you have the group who intrude on the survivors' territory and mess everything up, in this case military types led by Fringe's Lance Reddick. There is some amusement to be had with a hamster-ball-like contraption that allows folks to wander around outside, but that is in no way enough to allow you to suffer through this ridiculous attempt at horror.

Sometimes a really poor quality zombie movie
is hidden behind a really interesting box.  This
zombie movie is good. The make-up quality was
as good as ""The Walking Dead"".  Some of these
zombies can run, and most of them stand at night
in a form of sleep.  These zombies are caused by
a form of nuclear attack.  There were two scenes
where the CG effects were awful, but they were
short scenes.  The three main charactors were good
at acting. The possibility for a sequel exists.
Every time there is a zombie apocalypse the first
place California people suggest is Catalina Island.

5108960,3,B007RMQ508,"Its an original take on the Zombie genre. it touches on certain topics and questions that you may hear someone ask when they try to understand/evaluate the zombie genre. (Such as, ""Why don't the zombies attack each other?"", ""if it's a virus, how would it evolve, if at all?""
  The movie had a few original feels to it, first being an original yet typical disaster theme that caused the creation of the zombie like creatures. which is a new power source that is supposed to be great for the tree huggers and hippies goes bad and boom! which is typical for a disaster movie or a apocalypse movie, but i don't recall see that particular disaster somehow creating a zombie menace in any movie. So, kudos for the orignality, but pppfffft on practicality.
  Another difference, was the way the zombies acted and their shared traits, which actually made me wonder if they could even be considered zombies at all. Certain traits such as gaurding their food like an animal, barking and growling. Sleeping at night time in the standing position, eating each other as time went on, and a few other traits that i will leave to your discovery.
  Although the movie had a few original points, the characters and the way they were portrayed was pretty lame. very stereotypical and extremely aggravating. i literally looked at my buddy and told him that if he ever acted like any of those clowns, i'm knocking him out and using him as a distraction.

Overall rating is a 3 star. it had me interested with the different zombielike theme and approach, but the acting and characters kept telling me to watch something else.",1357084800,,1604,4.686832740213523

5108964,3,B007RMQ508,"Wow...I honestly didn't know how to rate this movie, so I'll just say that my 3-star rating is a 'weak' 3, but the movie is definitely a 'strong' 2. I gave it the benefit of the doubt.

In the zombie genre, it's a pretty well know fact that 90 out of every 100 movies made suck, but this one...didn't completely suck. With the exception or 2 or maybe 3 characters, you got the impression that they were at least trying. Yes, the acting wasn't that great, and seemed a little wooden at times, but the production staff did a pretty decent job with the makeup and locations. Also, there was a couple of interesting twists on the theme, twists that I've never seen. Zombies eating each OTHER, for one, and two, zombies needing to sleep.

The story, though, left you scratching your head in confusion. Little, if anything, was ever explained. How did the zombie apocolypse even start? Was it a solar flare? A nuclear echange between the U.S. and some other country? A virus? A military experiment gone awry? What makes it even more frustrating was that at least one character HINTED that she knew what went wrong. But the audience is never given an explantion. Not one. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Sorry, but that's just lazy, cop-out writing.

Other things that weren't explained/didn't make sense: Exactly why the blonde chick was so angry/angsty. How could a guy fall several stories down, and catch himself, by his fingertips, no less, on a window ledge? Seriously, even Superman couldn't do that. There are a couple of other things, but it's 2AM, and I'm getting kind of sleepy, so I'll wrap this up.

Is it worth watching? Yes...I guess so, at least once. If you're bored. If you're really in the Halloween spirit. If you don't mind plot-holes/lack of explanations that aren't TOO bad. Also..and this is the biggie...if you don't go into it expecting a ""Dawn of the Dead"" type experience.

5108965,2,B007RMQ508,"Remains is a zombie horror film that follows a small group held up in a casino after an accident causes a zombie outbreak. It has a few great moments, like the scenes where they are clearing out the casino. (for those that have seen it, the scenes in the hotel rooms and parking lot were specifically intense since everything goes wrong.) So, it has its moments. I also felt like the music matched the atmosphere, although it was a bit repetitive. One of the major flaws was the acting; Evalena Marie as Tori was particularly bad at times, the rest of the cast had bad moments as well but had some decent screen time. I also felt the story was too similar to every other zombie that has ever released; they have the perfect setting to innovate, but they barely use it to their advantage. (I was expecting  something closer to Dead Rising 2.) The effects were great, except for the green screen environments and explosions. Also, some transitions were off; it had some lengthy and random fade out transitions like you'd see on a TV Show going to commercial break. (was this a web series or miniseries pieced together to be a movie?)

Overall, it has a few great moments, but not enough to justify a full length movie; add on bad acting and a generic plot and you have Remains. As of 10/7/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, I highly recommend you stream or rent before purchasing unless you're a fan of the source material or zombie films.

5108971,3,B007RMQ508,"From what I remember of the comic, this 'remains' (no pun intended) pretty faithful.

However this may be unfortunately it's undoing as elements that you can pass off or are acceptable in print, in this come off as slightly pantomime and lame if not just a bit farcical (the plank across buildings scene and the jumping into the pool escape come to mind if you've seen it) .

Zombies sleeping or resting at night wasn't all that bad, but they would wake up to order. Music would blast out and they would all wake up at once, however gunfire would erupt and only one or two would seem to react at a time or when threatened with gunfire en-mass they would be kept at bay sometimes but not others.
It gave you the impression they were not mindless, with them being aware of danger (gunfire) and getting into rooms etc, but then they struggle to climb onto a flat bed truck (at waist height) to reach a group of people, which again was inconsistent.

The soldiers arrival scene was rushed, to the point where it may have been better to omit it all together because you began to feel they were trying to cram too much into a short space of time (trying to illustrate cabin fever and boredom of being trapped in the same environment with the same people, as large as that environment is takes time and this is what eats up most of the movie but unfortunately it doesn't really do even that justice)

Don't get me wrong, as I did enjoy it and Evalena (apart from being hot....LOL) was great as the cow from hell to be trapped with (again very faithful both physically et al to the comic).

Some of the CGI was poor (the truck flipping over on it's return to the City is most memorable as is some of the fires etc), but on the whole if you have slightly lower expectations than perhaps say the Dawn Of The Dead remake (in both effects, acting and general story) and treat this more like a 'camp' zombie flick then you won't be disappointed.

Had some genuinely funny moments which I don't normally care for in a zombie film (don't hold Shaun Of The Dead in high regards because of this) but finding the only car they had keys for and then attempting to get out of the shuttered garage did make me laugh (as an example).

Worth a view if you can obtain it relatively cheaply but just don't expect an edge of your seat horror, treat it more like a made for TV zombie film and you'll enjoy it (although it's far better than Sci Fi channel stuff).

Story was good, acting was good, make up was not bad at all ---- and liked it enough that I won't shy away from suggesting you add it to your collection.....I just really prefer my zombies dead and coming back, not the result of some giant microwave going bonkers.....the behavior(s) of the zombies - now that, was a refreshing change!",1346025600,4,632,4.401709401709402

8521407,3,B007RMQ508,"I had some hopes for this due to some of the glowing reviews here, but I'm afraid I just can't rate it as actually good. It's not totally terrible though, and in the bottomless pit that is the world of zombie movies that's saying pretty much. For one thing, there's a bit of money being spent here. Reportedly $750,000 was spent making this, which is not quite what is spent making one episode of The Walking Dead, but at least it's something. For one thing we're out of the woods. Most low to no-budget zombie films are filmed in rural areas for budgetary reasons. Trees lok like trees, zombies or not. but here we get a zombie infestation in a city, and Reno at that. Well, maybe actually Norwich, Connecticut, but at least the establishing shots were shot in Reno.

It starts well and follows the usual infection scenario but in this case it's a reaction to some kind of nuclear accident. After that it's your basic survivors holed up with zombies outside. This time it's in a Hotel/Casino. I thought that was going to make for some interesting scenarios, but they didn't use the casino-angle much and besides, it wasn't a fancy casino, more like a glorified card room in a lower end small hotel. The zombies/infected are unique to this film. That's not necessarily an improvement, but it is different. These Z's are sometimes fast and sometimes slow and lumbering. Some are weak but others are very strong. The sleep (!!) and you can even sneak out and tiptoe among them. And after a time, they even start attacking and eating each other (!!!). That's a violation of one of the most cardinal rules of zombies or infected, but that's what they do, in Reno at least. But they still crave live meat the most and will stop munching on each other if a fresh soul wanders by.

The film could have ben good given all this but it fails mostly in its script and some indifferent acting. The plot starts meandering a little way in and loses all sense of pacing. Worse than that it loses all sense of tension and dread. The characters just hang out, quarrel with each other and sit around the lounge drinking cocktails. this is not the mall of Dawn of the Dead which was temporarily secured so well that it allowed some down time. This is a cheap hotel with only glass doors and some piled up furniture between life and death. But the way the characters act you'd think the film was about a power outage and everybody is bored. The developments that do occur don't make much sense. You expect characters in these films to make some dumb decisions, but here characters completely change their personalities without apparent motivation.

The acting is not very helpful. Grant Bowler tries his best as the lead and is fairly convincing. for most of the others it's just the script. Tawny Cypress is good as Cindy, the daughter of ""General Reddick"" but only appears briefly and isn't given much to do. This is also true for Miko Hughes (trivia:the original baby in The Omen),the gay character Jensen and most of the others. Evalena Marie has some fans online but it's not for her acting, which is wooden. Overall you just don't care about these undeveloped and mostly unlikable people.

The movie was made for the chiller cable channel and has typical TV editing. There are some fun moments and a little suspense but it doesn't add up to much. it's pretty much a by-the-numbers zombie flick with a moderate budget that at least makes it stand out from the truly low budget fare. it's worth a watch on a slow night.

By the way, Steve Niles is a writer of the graphic novel that the film was based on, and not a character in the film. The title is actually ""Remains"". His name was added to be sure his fans watched it. I guess he has some reputation among the cognoscenti.",1471651200,,3760,4.539823008849558
8521408,2,B007RMQ508,"I can watch any zombie flick. The proof in the pudding is whether I feel the need to skip through the sappy character histories before the next victim gets eaten. I found myself fast forwarding a lot. Too slow of a pace, too much filler in an effort to reach full length. This film could have been made into a 30 minute short and been great.",1470182400,,341,4.181818181818182

I also like the redhead firecracker who ends up being the ""hero's"" sidekick.  The two of them make this movie (in my mind) and I find myself watching it over and over again.  My hat's off to Steve Niles and SyFy Network for this one.  I won't give the ending away, but there is a hint that there may be a sequel.  Please SyFy and Mr. Niles, make a sequel.",1434672000,,452,4.137931034482759
