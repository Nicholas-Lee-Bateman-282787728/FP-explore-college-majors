2290861,5,B0009HLBR0,"This series is a very light hearted, funny one that's highly enjoyable.  ***Sadly, they did Not release the entire series.***  Only 4 or 5 episodes were put on 4 DVD releases.  But, for what it is, this is a very good DVD, ... just don't expect it to be the full Season.",1349654400,4,270,4.153846153846154
2290862,4,B0009HLBR0,"I bought this DVD free through the Disney Reward Program. I had only seen a handful of episodes of the series before, but I had some points to waste so I thought I would give it a try.

The four episodes on the DVD are:

  Art Breaker
  Country Cousins (Part 1)
  Country Cousins (Part 2)
  The Grill Next Door

The series is silly, reminding me of some of the TGIF sitcoms I watched as a kid.",1345939200,,393,4.0394736842105265
2290863,5,B0009HLBR0,i watched this dvd of this show and i really enjoyed it a lot because it was very funny.the show had a funny sense of humor but it also had good friendly quality between each character in the show.so i would recommend to the fans who used to watch this show to buy this dvd and really enjoy it all over again.sincerly chrisfan.,1341532800,,327,4.2063492063492065

2290865,5,B0009HLBR0,"I absolutely love ""Disguise The Limit""!!!!

It is the best ""That's So Raven"" DVD released to date!

Raven-Symone is super-talented, and the cast is one of TV's best casts ever!",1216684800,,176,4.833333333333333
2290866,5,B0009HLBR0,"This is a great DVD. Our kids love Raven, and the episodes featured are definitely some of her best. I had not seen the Country Cousins episodes, and have enjoyed giggling over them with my kids. Raven shines! The only thing I would change is to add more episodes per DVD!",1168300800,,272,4.352941176470588
2290867,4,B0009HLBR0,"I find That's So Raven to be a cute and light hearted show. It was one of the best shows Disney ever created, making it surpass the 65 episodes Lizze McQuire, Evens Stevens,and The Jersey made. I haven't brought any of the DVDs, because I'm waiting on the complete seasons.

Go Ray.",1147910400,2,282,4.423076923076923
2290868,5,B0009HLBR0,My daughter just loves this programme on Disney & knows most of the episodes off by heart. Pity Disney don't think about kids in the UK as you can't get any Raven merchandise here at all. Thank goodness for Amazon !!,1142985600,,216,4.2926829268292686
2290869,1,B0009HLBR0,"What is wrong with you? i have read atleast 5 reviews and most of them are mispelled and make no sense. It is unbelievable how bad the reveiws were. Having said that, i do agree with most people.

I have not liked the show, ""Thast so Raven."" it is not funny and is very stupid. Raven Baxter, daughter of an owner of the chill grill, sister of Corey who i really don't like  and her mother who is freaky. Chelsea is retarded and thinks its cute to be dumb and Eddie is weird.

Raven can see in the future and tries to change it, good or bad. Its the same in every episode. the show is dumb and i do not like it. it is really not funny and raven needs to loose weight.",1137542400,,666,3.955223880597015
2290870,5,B0009HLBR0,"What can I say about ""That's So Raven"" that wouldn't undermine the brilliance of this comedy series? We only purchased this DVD out of the three released so far, but I am hoping that Disney will release a box set of each season on DVD. I have to give credit to the writers and producers of this show which take this show beyond what would be expected of a Disney Channel series. What really makes this show special is Raven herself. Raven is truly a gifted young woman with many talents and is very deserving of many more accolades for her work on this show. The entire cast (Anneliese Van der Pol, Orlando Brown, Kyle Massey, T'keyah Crystal Keymah, and Rondell Sheridan) is also really great and their hard work and talent really shows.  This show has truly expanded Disney's audience and has consistently been the highest rated series on Disney as well as the first series on Disney to be signed into a fourth season. Over the past year, this show has been the most eagerly watched show among everyone in my household and we've gotten other friends and family members into it. Unlike some other shows geared for tweens where the comedy is corny and old, this show is hillarious and in my opinion can be enjoyed by both adults and children equally which is very hard to find this day in age. This is such a wonderful show and I'm glad Disney did the right thing!!",1135814400,4,1365,4.481927710843373
2290871,5,B0009HLBR0,"1  Episodes

A  Art Breakers

  Chelsea finds this sudden art talent and is chosen to make an art. She makes a sculpture of Raven as a raven. She has birds and feathers and a beak. Raven plays statue after she breaks it. Meanwhile Cory and William take action cause they've been banned by sugar.

B  Country Cousins Part 1

Raven visits her cousins. She used to always visit them but then they stopped calling and returned the letters. Chelsea comes with her. They get all hyped when Rae askes for gravy. Meanwhile, Eddie stays at Cory's house and covers for him.

C  Country Cousins Part 2

 Raven makes peace with everyone. Cory learns not to use Eddie.

D  The Grill Next Door

Raven has a vision of the Chill Grill going out of business. So she has to lower herself (literally). She has to go out with Stanley so he wouldn't play at the Hill Grill (How original!).

2  Bonus Feautures

A  Master of Disguises

  This is pretty cool. It shows how they did Raven playing 4 different characters and how they did the masks. How they did the statue in art Breakers.

B  Video Commentary with Raven

  This basically shows what she has to do for the episodes and I think she works really hard. It's not a boring commentary. It's really interesting.",1125619200,23,1246,4.441964285714286
2290872,5,B0009HLBR0,"The second dvd release of That's So Raven once again is magnificent. Although it would be nice if they would release whole seasons but this will do for now. The storylines are hilarious and the comedic skills of Raven are impecable. She is one of a kind!

This is a great black family comedy that everyone can enjoy. If you love Raven-Symon and/or love to laugh this is a great choice for you.

(ps it's obvious the last FOUR comments are from the same person, they could at least do it a different day, idiot haha.)",1124755200,5,516,4.364583333333333
