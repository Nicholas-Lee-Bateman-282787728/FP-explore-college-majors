1711429,4,B000066755,"A well rounded movie, fight scenes are no different than any other new movie you may see. I bought it because of an actor I am a fan of but the movie was very good. Awesome for its time, If you can deal with English speaking with English subtitles A movie. I enjoyed it. action, drama, fighting, competition, I think of this like a pre tekken",1412553600,,342,4.196969696969697
1711430,1,B000066755,"EXPERT FIGHTERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD FACE EACH OTHER IN A MARTIAL ARTS TOURNAMENT. THE WINNER WILL RECEIVE $5 MILLION. MOVIES LIKE THIS GIVE MARTIAL ARTS MOVIES A BAD NAME. THE STORY IS VERY CLICHE'D, ALL THE FIGHTS ARE BORING, THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE, AND IF YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT, THE MOVIE'S JUST PLAIN STUPID! ... TRUST ME, YOU'RE BETTER OFF LEAVING THIS ONE ON THE SHELF.",1077494400,5,380,4.602941176470588
1711431,2,B000066755,"The whole movie is based on a competition that is meant to be live over the internet.  When this movie was made, YouTube was not yet around, so the idea at the time was revolutionary, but an entire movie of just fighting just didn't do it for me.  Not much of a storyline other than the younger prodigy wanted to prove to the older prodigy that he is just as good if not better.  Also, a slight love story with hardly any love shown.  The acting was poor at times and the fighting sequences were not impressive.  It was like watching a Godzilla movie, but without Godzilla, instead, it was pairs of people fighting in every scene.  The main characters are good looking though; that's about it.",1445472000,,693,4.417322834645669

1711439,4,B000066755,"Whoa, a movie with a storyline but I hated the ending. They could have done something else at the end. So what will you see? To start off with you will see Martial Arts and lots of fights. There is character development and in the end, you want the good guy to win. Ah, the twist (spoiler alert) he doesnt.",1429228800,,306,4.116666666666666

7961772,3,B000066755,Parts of drama and not so extreme although I can't do half of the motions. Good movie for kids to watch.,1447632000,,104,4.0

7961774,2,B000066755,"The movie is not that great, however, some of the fights are well choreographed. I bought the HK dvd version way back in the day specifically for the nunchaku fight. Scott Adkins (Ninja, Ninja II) who was just getting his film career started back then is the nunchaku fighter and puts on one hell of a show. But overall, the plot is lame, the acting is horrible. If you love martial arts fights and don't care for plot, etc. then gives this a look.",1445558400,,448,4.345238095238095
