3608645,4,B001GD6VX0,The movie was okay. Seemed really long to get to the main plot tho. That ghetto black girl who worked in the restaurant was funny tho. LOL,1296518400,,138,4.148148148148148
3608646,2,B001GD6VX0,"No disrespect, but you might want to look up the definition of ""bootleg"" - unauthorized, counterfeit, etc - to make sure it conveys the meaning you intended.

(If so, please forgive my intrusion.)

3608650,5,B001GD6VX0,"i must admit i was skeptical when i first watched this movie... But I was pleasantly surprised that the movie had a well thought out story line, coupled with just enough comic relief to please all types.  I watched it over and over... great movie!!",1223769600,8,248,4.511111111111111
3608731,3,B001GD6VX0,"I cant say this movie was great but it do have potential i can truly say it couldve been better but i understand the budget, i cant say on the person who made this movie because im sure they probably did a movie i probably have seen but don't remember at this moment, low budget movies can be good or bad but this was an inbetween it had it good moment like when u was ready to get hyped it failed to come through like",1517875200,,418,3.929411764705882

3608736,5,B001GD6VX0,The plot was unexpected but good. I just kept getting the characters mixed up because of the blond hair. Good job and looking forward to watching another piece of work by Alyze. I enjoyed the wisdom spoken about marriage as well.,1516492800,,229,4.609756097560975

3608739,4,B001GD6VX0,"Great independent film production! The one actress (Angel)  sounded very scripted and didn't really make the script her own, connecting with it to deliver it as a message from her soul so to speak but as though she was reciting lines. The story line was pretty direct and forward on, plot twists throughout to keep it interesting to the finish! If you like ""hood love"" based books and films, this is definitely a good watch. One of the better ""underground"" films I have seen lately.",1516406400,,482,4.670588235294118
3608740,5,B001GD6VX0,This movie was good..all Alyze Elyse movies are good..keep doing your thing love..we need more African american movies that let you see that somebody has been through this or know somebody that has been through it..,1514505600,,215,5.0
3608761,4,B001GD6VX0,"this was a pretty good movie .never try to be a player..i thought the cop that arrested the baby mother was a lesbian because he looked like a female but turned out to be a male this needs a part 2..oh yeah and alot of the actors ,actress i saw them on other movies i watched on prime so they ain't known",1514419200,,304,3.9193548387096775
3608762,2,B001GD6VX0,This movie is poorly written. The characters are one dimensional and they make juvenile decisions.,1514332800,,98,5.6

3608764,1,B001GD6VX0,"This is my first review, and I had to write one because of just how bad this pile of dog poop  is. From the editing, acting, writing, directing, casting, location, camera, sound, music, costume...please  stop doing movies if you still are. For the love of God I hope everyone who had anything to do with this poor home video (not a movie) are no longer doing anything to do with movies.

Worst movie on Amazon, and trust me they have alot of crap on Amazon!",1514160000,3,457,4.352941176470588
3608765,1,B001GD6VX0,"I enjoy all types of genres, but this was terrible. If you enjoyed it great. For anyone else who prefers quality movies, pass on this one. My son's film class in his junior year of high school created a better gangsta short film. The story may have been good, but I couldn't get past the bad editing, sound, or poor picture quality. I stopped after 15 minutes, so my review isn't a full/true review.",1514073600,2,399,4.405405405405405

3608767,5,B001GD6VX0,"I always enjoy watching movies with black actors and actresses.  This movie has no white actors in it all.  That's unique in black films.  The four women who are in love with the main  character are just plain gorgeous.  The main character whose name is Serious  played by Leonardo Black is average looking, but boy does he have a line.  That's how four women could fall desperately in love with him. and that he could  keep them. Turns out that Leonardo Black in real life is a member of Que Psi Phi. He  is a  Que  Dog as am  I.  So he's not really acting in his success with the ladies..  He's being a Dawg. Plus he can act. He is however greatly out shone by Sandra Isley who plays LuQweesha the cashier at black take-out restaurant. If the viewer has ever been to  one of these places, what is shown  at that joint,  the incompetent and dismissive  staff, the furious manager and a raving dissatisfied customers with half-hour waits for a greasy hamburger, you cannot keep a straight face.  You really can't. Kudos to  Kamau Rochelle, the much aggrieved manager and  again to LuQweesha a huge woman, ( NOT is Serious' stable).
The story is well  conceived and carried out. Mme Elyse writes it like  it is. The story is logial, and well put together.  the end flows naturally from the events that proceed it. And the writing is very consistent. Alyze Elyse is a talent.  This is the most enjoyable black film since ""Thirty Years To Life."" with Erika Alexander of ""GET OUT.""  I look  forward to more of Alyze Elyse's work. May she include LuQweesha. Jerrell Crump, director, and Matt Bartus  and Anthony Cortese whose editng was brilliant. I really liked this  film.  One quibble with this film and the film Loving a Thug.  Negroes really do make love with our clothes  off.  Ask Brenda Jackson.",1513468800,,1798,4.536050156739812

3608769,4,B001GD6VX0,"I like the character Sherita, she embodied the deepest kind of passionate lover that I admire and respect. I become in love with her. I was very disappointed that the main character Serious treated her with disrespect for he most part. The other characters were mostly unremarkable and not very memorable or relate-able to me.",1512777600,,326,4.945454545454545
3608770,1,B001GD6VX0,"one of the absolute worse films I have ever seen. The worst cast of actors ever can  you please do a better selection of black films, please. This was awful and does not depict what true black cinema is supposed to be it is embarrassing.",1512345600,2,237,4.266666666666667
3608811,1,B001GD6VX0,Horrible movie OMG waste of time and effect extremely low budget is this what we as a culture have to look forward to bad acting and directing,1511568000,2,142,4.296296296296297
3608812,2,B001GD6VX0,"It's exciting to know the folks of color are taking advantage of the opportunity to be on film, but this movie budget likely prevented the director the ability to do more with this movie perhaps?. In any case I thought the movie was borderline wack at best.",1511308800,,257,4.48936170212766
3608813,2,B001GD6VX0,"This was a very silly movie glorifying young people making incredibly bad deisions which end horribly for the most part.  Whenever I had seen movies like this I am always asking myself ""Are young people in general, and young women, in particular, devoid of personal integrity to this degree, REALLY?!!""  It is worth watching if you want to see how to waste your youth with ""bad-for-you"" friends and lovers.",1510272000,3,406,4.869565217391305

3608865,4,B001GD6VX0,"I rented this DVD because I enjoy watching movies with black actors.  I have seen many, poorly made, low-budget black films, so my saying this film was funny and entertaining is saying a lot!  After turning on the DVD, I continued to work on my computer, but right away, the story captured my attention.  If you are looking for a Tyler Perry-ish looking film...keep looking because the movie is very, low budget. There is an obvious lack of ""lighting"" and ""stage preparation that most the high budget and mainstream films have, but the actors did a fairly good job of acting. One of the actors in the film, a guy by the name of Leonardo Black, looks just like LL Cool J and I could not stop thinking it was him.  I would have liked seeing a few more subplots added to the story, but because the dialogue was sharp and witty, and actors entertaining I rated the film four stars.  Perhaps, if this production company produces another film they will make some of their movie's ""scenes"" longer, but overall the writer and director did a good job of holding my attention.",1394496000,2,1066,4.53125
3608866,4,B001GD6VX0,"I liked it...I think that Alyze Elyse is a very talented person. She has a new movie out and I will purchase that also, Behind Closed Doors is the title.",1393200000,2,153,4.133333333333334
3608867,5,B001GD6VX0,"I think Alyze (the drink?) is very talented. She is a good actress. She is an excellent songstress, too.  I would like to see a sound track come out since she writes and performs the tracks to the movies. There are some characters from her other movies that are not as good, like the BBW in the fast food restaurant.",1388534400,2,316,4.266666666666667
3608868,5,B001GD6VX0,Great movie. Love the way Alyze brings real life situations to the light. Somebody has been through this or knows someone who has been through something like this.,1378339200,,163,4.857142857142857
3608869,5,B001GD6VX0,I really enjoyed this movie...I was really shocked at the end....I did quite a few OMGs.....this is real life situations....there are believe it or not plenty of women who go to jail or die for the cost of loving an unworthy man.....I've seen it play out many times....great joy Alyze....keep doing you boo!!,1358985600,6,308,4.830188679245283

8305048,3,B001GD6VX0,it was another low budget movie so I knew not to expect too much. What confused me was why Alicia was in the front row at the BM's funeral?? Like they didn't even know each other. Another thing is I can't believe that the BM loved this man more than she loved her own child. To kill herself and leave her son motherless is just as low as you can get smh,1527552000,,353,3.9166666666666665
8305049,2,B001GD6VX0,"Innocent?  This Z rated movie is guilty of being awful.  Poor quality, terrible acting, stereotypical characters, and the plot had too many holes.  The only thing innocent about this movie was the little boy who played the main character's son.",1523404800,,244,5.05

8305054,5,B001GD6VX0,GREAT!!!! Enjoyed the acting and the cinema-photography!,1521504000,,56,7.142857142857143
8305055,2,B001GD6VX0,"One of the worst pieces of amateur drivel I've watched on Amazon Prime...ever! Poorly acted, poorly edited, poorly written. One scene in a cab seemed like it was lifted from another movie, and inserted into this one for no apparent reason. The plot didn't seem like something that would be happening in 2000s at all. However, if people really do live this way, then we as a nation (or culture) are in trouble. I know it's supposed to be fiction, but it wasn't even good at being fictional. If I have piqued your curiosity at all, then by all means, watch it for yourself. Otherwise, save your money and time. I give it two stars because hate is too strong an emotion to waste on this one.",1518825600,,688,4.425196850393701
