8427180,5,B002T44YR0,"A funny, entertaining comedy from beginning to end. The characters are good and well - written, but some jokes do fall flat on their faces. The film also relies too heavily on sci - fi references at times, but not enough to interfere with the enjoyment of the picture.",1502064000,,268,4.489795918367347
8427181,2,B002T44YR0,"This movie looked like someone's no budget home made movie.  It was really really bad, the storyline and especially the acting.  I don't think there was one person in the movie who could act.  The alien looked like a Halloween costume.",1440201600,,235,4.682926829268292
8427182,3,B002T44YR0,"LOL, I thought this was going to be scary, and like the one bad review, I almost gave up on the movie because at times the characters long drawn out debates were more than I could handle.  But it did have it's few moments that totally cracked me up.  Definitely should be categorized as a Comedy.  Credits and etc. took too long at the beginning!  Probably should be rated one or two stars but for sake of the comedy I will give it 3 stars.",1439769600,,440,4.141176470588236
8427183,1,B002T44YR0,"Love ET movies in general.  Sorry, but this was unwatchable for us.  Atrocious acting and scenes done on a very low budget.  We do appreciate quality ""B"" grade movies.... but whatever this was.... we just couldn't do it and had to turn it off...!",1432166400,2,246,4.545454545454546
