3454570,5,B001ALYGZ8,"I watched this dvd with a couple of family members and have to say it was extremely informative.
My one big problem with it though was the length, it seemed to go on and on for hours, and while I understood the overall concept, I felt much of the data was too detailed for the average person. I think people with really technical minds would have an easier time taking it all in.
Having said that, I did learn a lot from this lecture and certainly enough to learn that gasolene is a waste by-product that was foisted upon the American people. Sadly 'we the people' learn little from history or past mistakes and seem to allow ourselves to be lulled into a slumber that keeps us ignorant of so many things. If each one of us would take the time to do some research and seek a solution, we'd be much happier and more in control of our lives.
Well, David Blume has done exactly that and does a good job of explaining about how gasolene is the end product of the oil refining process and is actually a waste product. He gives us the story about how it came about and the solution to our dilemma.
I think he could have shortened his lecture quite a bit though because it's very tiring to view it in one sitting. My brain felt taxed trying to take in so much information at once, hence my family members and I had to cut it off mid-way through with a promise to finish watching it later.
The dvd and book are definitely worth the time it takes however to learn about gasolene consumption and the strangle-hold it has on us today.",1223164800,4,1523,4.273356401384083

8277952,5,B001ALYGZ8,"This video I haven't watch in a while so I need to do that again.
What I will tell you is that it tell how our country was fuel back before the prohibition era. Which how one business owner took the government use of power to take us off Alcohol fuel to make his company money which is wrong use of power.
What you lean in school was a lie.  How big oil companies make money for themselves which they should but the government shouldn't take money to stop running our vehicles on alcohol. Watch the truth and how south American went from Alcohol fuel to regular fuel and then back.
It's sad that we aren't running off this as a country.

Buy this information and enjoy the video.

8277953,5,B001ALYGZ8,Anyone who is ready to start using alternative fuels should read this book.  It's reasonably priced (through Amazon.com) and easy to understand.,1357948800,,144,5.545454545454546
8277954,4,B001ALYGZ8,"This book goes overboard on the process and history of alcohol production. Gets into the science. Weak on actual How to, but gives a complete spectrum of various fruits and other organics that can be processed.",1338768000,,210,4.861111111111111
8277955,5,B001ALYGZ8,David Blume's dvd is great!  I love how comprehensive it is.  I do wish that the sections were longer and more coherent (so I could choose which ones to watch) but I understand that this is a workshop and not meant for dvd exclusively.  Still it is very helpful and has an outrageous amount of information from a variety of perspectives.,1238371200,,337,4.491803278688525
8277956,1,B001ALYGZ8,"Like others this is a timely yet dated version of how the US can become energy independent.

While the general overall thrust of the book is to be applauded, the material is dated and of little use for the current automobiles now in use.

Carburetors went out of vogue years ago and if your car still has points chances are the old beast doesn't run anymore or is so environmentally unfriendly that the cult surrounding this book would quickly run you of the parking lot organized rally of environmentalists.

As a social comment the points on technology suppression remain accurate but the solution provided by the author has not worked in the past and is destined to the same failure because not enough specifics are provided in the book to let the average person convert or produce ethanol. In short it just ain't as easy as the author says it is folks.

The era of revolution ended with the 60's for most and the anti-corporate tone in light of the current economic mess will do little to help the owner of any modern fuel injected vehicle make the change being advocated by the author.

Rather than buy this book and try to convert your car to ethanol the better plan is to lobby your congressman/woman and vote with your dollars by buying fuel efficient flex vehicles from whomever will remain producing cars in North America.",1231459200,7,1332,4.651063829787234
