2460098,5,B000CEGXWS,"Jessy Dixon, a memorable gospel singer and songwriter died Sept. 26, 2011 at 73.  Jessy Dixon is someone to watch, not only with his dapper and meticulous appearance, he is a smooth dancer across the stage.  Bill Gaither chats with Jessy Dixon, and if you are not familiar with Jessy Dixon, take a look at these many performances, from some classic Homecoming Series Concerts.

Born in Texas, Jessy Dixon had chronic asthmatic but tells how he believes  God healed him and he hasn't had an attack.  He lives in Chicago with many animals, including llamas.  And you will hear of his travels in Europe.  He played the piano with James Cleveland, sang with Mahalia, and was an influence to Paul Simon.

There are some soulful rousing performances, beginning with ""I Saw the Light"" & ""I Stood on the Banks"".  These songs are taken from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memphis-Homecoming/dp/B000309A30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memphis Homecoming</a>&nbsp;a memorable concert!

A favorite of mine is written by Nancy Harmon, ""The Blood Bought Church"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Irish-Homecoming/dp/B0001UZZWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Irish Homecoming</a>.  Nancy has sang on the Gaithers before, and she does it excellent! Also, one I had not heard, I especially enjoyed the upbeat ""I'm So Glad"".

The coming together of black and white gospel was a concert called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Build-a-Bridge/dp/B00016MSTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Build a Bridge</a>&nbsp;and Jessy sings ""Get Away Jordan"" and ""Yes"".

A few memorable songs include one with Andrae Crouch, who wrote ""Soon and Very Soon"", and listen to this beautiful Rusty Goodman song, ""Leavin' On My Mind"", very emotional song.  Plus, I love ""The Wicked Shall Cease Their Troubling"",  ""I Can't Even Walk"" and ""Master the Tempest is Raging"".  You will see a song from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Tribute-to-Mahalia-Jackson-Lynda-Randle/dp/B0009DTZ5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Tribute to Mahalia Jackson : Lynda Randle</a>, wonderful and intimate setting and Jesse sings  ""God is Standing By"".

Other performances include:
God Be With You;  Heavenly News;  Lord, Give Me Wings;  The Night Before Easter;  I'm Rich;  I'm so Glad;  I Am Redeemed  and from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gaither-Gospel-Series-Jerusalem/dp/B0007M23JM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gaither Gospel Series: Jerusalem</a>, Moses Take Your Shoes Off. Plus, Jessy does his signature song, Sanctuary.
