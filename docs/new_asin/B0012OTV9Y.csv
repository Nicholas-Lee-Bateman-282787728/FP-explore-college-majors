8247086,5,B0012OTV9Y,"This film is an engaging look into several aquariums in America. Accompanied by affable young hosts, we have a front row seat to all that these aquariums have to offer, and all the animals that call these aquariums home. A fun film to watch with your kids!",1360022400,,256,4.468085106382978
8247087,5,B0012OTV9Y,"My kids have been watching this series on TV and they were thrilled when they saw they could get DVDs of the series to watch anytime.  Not only is the series educational, it is very entertaining and relatable to kids.  While there are many shows about aquariums, this series uses other kids as hosts so that kids put themselves in the show.  They see that fellow kids can go out and do things, and they believe that they can do all this themselves.

I really can't say enough about what a well rounded series this is for 4-12 year olds.",1208822400,3,536,4.33
