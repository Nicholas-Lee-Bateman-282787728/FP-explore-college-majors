Buy the official season releases of ""The Lucy Show."" We already have seasons one through three out. Season four should be out sometime in March 2011. You won't believe the difference between the shabby quality of the public domain episodes and the unbelievable quality of the official releases. It's like they were filmed a month ago. In addition you get great bonus features. So stop buying the same 30 episodes. I was fooled twice and decided to wait for the real thing.",1291420800,,615,4.811320754716981
8206724,4,B000SSONMA,"Alpha, the most venerable of all the budget-priced DVD companies, recycles the same old episodes of THE LUCY SHOW that have fallen into public domain limbo.  Serious ""Lucy"" fans have probably purchased these eps over and over again, but the price is right for the casual viewers too.

Five years after the last episode of ""I Love Lucy"" aired, Lucille Ball was back at CBS, sans Desi Arnaz (whom she had divorced by this point) for another shot at sitcom success.  THE LUCY SHOW cast Ball as Lucille Carmichael, a widow who lived with her best friend Vivian Bagley (Vivian Vance) and their respective children in a large house in upstate New York.  The show was later re-tooled, with Lucy moving to California to work as a secretary for bank manager Mr. Mooney (Gale Gordon).

Episodes:

""Lucy and the Efficiency Expert"" - Mr. Mooney's office is invaded by an overzealous efficiency expert (guest star Phil Silvers) who quickly takes Lucy under his wing.

""Lucy and Paul Winchell"" - Lucy becomes a life-sized puppet when ventriloquist Paul Winchell must entertain at the bank's annual gala night.

""Lucy and Pat Collins"" - Lucy and Mooney attend a performance of ""Hip Hypnotist"" Miss Pat, when Mr. Mooney complains of insomnia.

""Lucy Meets the Berles"" - Whilst on loan as secretary to Milton Berle, she suspects the comedian of having an affair with Ruta Lee.

""Lucy and Robert Goulet"" - After he's turned down for a loan, Lucy enrolls a truck driver into a Robert Goulet look-alike contest.",1283126400,,1491,4.834645669291339
