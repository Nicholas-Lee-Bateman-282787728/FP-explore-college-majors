A series that captured the hearts of so many Canadians and others from around the globe should not be kept in hibernation.  Hopefully before too long, we will see every episode of this wonderful series brought to DVD.  As its famous theme song suggests, the world should run with the Raccoons once again, and hopefully, forever more.",1109808000,,1046,5.023121387283237
