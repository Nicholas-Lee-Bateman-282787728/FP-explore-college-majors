508957,5,6302763193,"True enough, movies about serial killers are just too many around, and the theme is simply overdone.  Now, J8 has been shot in 1992, and if you make abstraction of all the dullest things done ever since, it IS a damn good movie.
First, Garcia's character John Berlin is no body-built, trigger-happy superman. He's merely a lab-tech, a forensic-oriented cop who stumbles upon what he thinks is the work of a serial. No shots fired, no wild car chases. The whole story is very plausible : from the cars they drive (a regular unmarked brown Police pack Caprice,and an 10-year old, battered 380SEC Mercedes as Berlin's personal car), to the clothes they wear, or the guns they carry. No fancy suits (although Garcia's short coat is really cool), and no 5-pound cannons (plain, California police regular issue Beretta 92). Creative police work, brainstorming and trial by error. Sounds a lot like your next door homicide cop daily bread and butter. And last but not least, the movie is shot in rural California...(well, BC posing as...) But it could have been New England ! A definite must see for those who enjoy Puccini, foggy morning ambiance rather than loud noises, squealing tires and shotgun blasts.",987033600,25,1201,4.887254901960785

509082,4,6302763193,"After just recently seeing and reviewing Final Analysis I saw Jennifer Eight which had me on the edge of my seat. It was a mystery and thriller and horror mixed into one. I was scared when the stalker was prowling in and around Uma Thurman's home.

Leonard Maltin said: ""Taut, entertaining thriller in which burned out LA Cop Garcia relocates to a small Northern California town, where he finds himself investigating a series of brutal murders."" He also went on to say that the credibility dwindles as the plot progresses. His rate was a Two and a Half Star rating out of Four Stars. That translates to Three Stars out of Five. I don't think it was that bad. I give the movie Three and a Half Stars rounded up to Four out of Five Stars. This is a movie that will keep you guessing and the ending was very original. I won't give it away suffice it to say that you will never expect what you finally see.

My one complaint was the name of one of the bad guys. John Taylor was a great NFL football player and for the writer to choose that name for the villain was nothing short of irresponsible!

509167,2,6302763193,"I did not like this movie's dream version of God portraying Him as being a little old man who lives upstairs and then alleges that prayers are like God's unopened junk mail. What a cheap shot by the writer-director to try and ridicule our Creator by using a fiendishly foul insult that embodies the kind of blatantly unjustified accusation one might expect to hear coming from the likes of Lucifer or Caligastia. Perhaps the pathetically sad little creature who penned this small collection of painfully pitiful scribblings of a babbling blasphemer had been praying for a box-office hit and when this flick only grossed a little over half of its $20 million dollar budget, he chose the I AM WHO AM to be the innocent target of his poison arrow of blame. You know, it is generally not a good idea for a planetary mortal, despite having the spiritual potential to be immortal, to pick on some One who is exponentially if not infinitely bigger when viewing things through the undiluted cosmic perspective that transcends time and space let alone unwisely choose the eternally existent Creator of all things and beings to be the intended victim of such a reprehensibly irresponsible word-weapon attack. And the very fact that God didn't hire a robustly verbose lawyer and sue for defamation of character is proof enough for me that He is not like human beings who often forget that we were created in His Image and not the other way around. When God expressed Himself as a Man among men through the mysterious bestowal of Jesus a little over two thousand earth years ago, He demonstrated once and for all that He is a full-time God. He doesn't have a part-time job somewhere else doing something else on nights and weekends not to mention religious holidays. Being a loving and merciful God who is genuinely concerned about His created sons and daughters is a divine choice uninfluenced by any external conditions. Despite the fact that His infinite nature becomes a very real obstacle to being fully understood by less-than-infinite beings such as ourselves should not in the least lessen our faith that opens the door to a deeper understanding that will progressively lead us closer to the indwelling Spirit of God who resides within the minds of all mortals until eventually an up-close-and-personal, face-to-face encounter with our Universal Father will become a past event instead of a future possibility.",1418342400,,2406,4.914004914004914

509229,3,6302763193,"Jennifer 8 (Bruce Robinson, 1992)

I first saw Jennifer 8 twenty years ago, right after it had come out on video. I hadn't watched it since, and pretty much all I remembered about it was ""Uma Thurman nude! Yaaaaaaaaaay!"" and then hitting the end credits and ""body double! Boooooooooooo!"" So I figured I'd give it another look and see if it held up after all these years. Surprisingly, it does, though it is certainly not without its flaws; while I was watching, I was also reminded that this was one of the first times when Andy Garcia, who was just beginning a decade of can't-go-wrong flicks that lasted till (or through, depending on your POV) 2001's The Unsaid, made an impression on me. It is not a movie without flaws, but it's still some decent watchin' that presages Blink, released two years later (with many of those same flaws).

Garcia (Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead) plays John Berlin, an LA detective who, desperate to get out of the city, transfers to the sleepy town of Eureka, where he gets partnered with Freddy Ross (the ubiquitous Lance Henriksen) and immediately finds himself involved in a murder investigation that bears possible ties to a serial killer Berlin was investigating in LA. Problem is, he could never convince anyone there was an actual serial killer wandering around. Berlin meets Helena (Kill Bill's Uma Thurman) and becomes convinced she's the guy's next victim, while his new squadmates think he's downright nuts...until a few of them start thinking that maybe there is a serial killer wandering around, and his name is John Berlin.

The drawbacks are simple and easily pointed out: the pacing is abysmal in places (this is an hour and a half long movie that takes place in two hours and four minutes), and the setup for the last twenty minutes or so has a few bits where the viewer has to, shall we say, stretch the bonds of credibility farther than they're usually willing to go without snapping. (Without being spoily, I'll just say ""cheese and crackers, but the scene on the fire escape..."".) Balancing these drawbacks are a plethora of solid-to-incredible performances not only from the principal cast, but from some minor characters whose parts are elevated by jaw-dropping casting decisions (John Malkovich is basically a cameo; I'm amazed he took such a small part, but he does a wonderful job with it. Ditto Kathy Baker). Bob Gunton, Graham Beckel, Perry Lang, Kevin Conway, and a host of other ""you know these folks, but you don't know you know them"" character actors give top-notch performances in roles that, had they had the meat they deserved, might have made the movie's bloated running time well worth it and then some.

509249,4,6302763193,"Back in the days of VHS I was working in video distribution. This was introduced to hit the rental market and, when I receive my promo kit, I took it home and popped it into the old VCR. I liked it enough but didn't think much about it afterward. It''s resurfaced on Netflix with better user reviews than I would have imagined, so I figured to give it another shot. Glad I did.

Here's the scoop. Andy Garcia was a detective in L.A. His life unraveled after his girlfriend bailed on him so he moved to a small town up north (Oregon?) to get his life back on track. He latches onto a case that suggests he might be looking at a serial killer targeting blind women. When he visits an institution that assists blind women, to interview a possible witness (Uma Thurman), he begins to get involved with her and the case takes some turns that get him into serious trouble and have his co-workers doubting his sanity.

This is not what you would consider great art as far as film making is concerned but it is good craft. The script navigates the story very evenhandedly and the directing is very decent. I thought there was good use of location and weather. At times it was raining, other times snowing and other times broodingly overcast. The locations were varied but no concrete and steel here. These were mostly remote locations that gave a sense of things being bleak. The blind card was used well. The way Thurman remembered small things, or was able to point out seemingly minor details, added up nicely and was evenly spaced so it didn't telegraph the ending. It was good seeing Uma Thurman in an early role. She already had some decent films under her belt but wasn't quite a household name. I don't dislike Andy Garcia but I won't ever be the first in line to see his next movie. He's Okay here. Not bad but not great. The supporting actors do a good job. Lance Hendrickson, as his partner, is always likable. Graham Beckel is usually cast as a slimeball and that's where he's at here.

All the production values are good so the viewer isn't distracted. Some could argue the ending but I liked it. It was a quick way to pull a lot of strings together. No fuss. No Muss. I like this type of movie. Mystery thrillers are always good fodder for film. Though not the best of its ilk it's more than watchable.",1352764800,,2308,4.425882352941176

And after an initial viewing, I dismissed it as a formulaic thriller. But more recently I came across an old VHS copy, and have watched it couple of times.

I think the attraction may be Uma Thurman. And the fact that she plays a blind person increases her attraction - i.e. her vulnerability.

The repellent aspect of the movie: may be that it is a ""cop"" movie. Is it a ""cop"" movie? And the ""cop"" gets the girl too.

I read some of the other reviews. And I agree there are some ""holes"" in the plot, or it gets a bit convoluted at places.

First, what bugs me is - what is the connection between the blind girl ""Amber"", whom we never meet, the most recent victim, and this serial killer cop? She apparently left the ""institute"" with him. Didn't she? And how come no one else saw them together?

Second - when Berlin (Andy Garcia) searches the VW van at the beginning of the movie and finds a small piece of plastic, part of an inhaler, and then later in the film this helps Berlin make a connection between the killer and the Frisco area, Oakland more precise.

Naturally, one of his first calls is to a homicide investigation at a dump and he's back with big-city crime and a case that's been haunting him.

Is a serial killer on the loose?  He's the only one who thinks so.  He's not just dealing with blind justice, but a blind witness as well.  Helene (Thurman) can only help him with what she hears.

Can Berlin keep himself together and keep Helene safe as he tries to solve the crime?  While the movie plot's weak, the dialogue could come out of a classic noir novel and some of it is brilliant.  Also brilliant is John Malkovich's appearance as  an Internal Affairs officer late in the film.

509275,5,6302763193,"""I've got a bad feeling about this. And I've been doing this too long to be wrong."" -- Garcia's John Berlin

There is a quiet and haunting quality to this crime mystery which begins during the opening credits and is sustained to the very end. Andy Garcia rarely gets the spotlight he deserves but his low-key yet unmistakable charisma blends perfectly with the subdued thriller elements of this engrossing whodunit. As the lonely cop who leaves L.A. for the smaller Eureka after a messy divorce almost destroys him, he really excels, and seems to completely understand that this is a mood piece more than anything. And Uma Thurman, too often the centerpiece of Tarantino's high octane and quirky films, is marvelous as a shy blind girl as vulnerable to a serial killer as she is to Garcia's attentions toward her.

John Berlin (Garcia) hasn't even clocked in when a body in the Eureka dump leads to a starling and more gruesome discovery; body parts he believes belong to one of the ""Jennifers"" in a serial killer's spree which has baffled law enforcement. Even his old pal, portrayed by Lance Henrikson from Chris Carter's Millenium doesn't see the connection, and the new kid on the block must battle resentment of his presence and skepticism about his investigation as he tracks a killer. Uma Thurman is wonderful as the blind Helena; the only person to have seen the serial murderer. Most of the best scenes are between she and Garcia, the score by Christopher Young and intermittent songs by artists like Lenny Welch augmenting his growing love for Helena, and fear for her life.

Kathy Baker is excellent as Berlin's big sister of sorts and old pal Erikson's wife. Garcia's cop is more like a C.S.I. that an action hero, lending a certain depth to his character. Director Bruce Robinson also wrote the screenplay for Scott Rudin's production, and while the story becomes implausible towards the conclusion, as a director, he never lets the atmosphere waver.  Garcia and Thurman make a nice couple here, and the believability of their romance overcomes a few plot problems to make this a quietly terrific film. The R rating of the film stems from a couple of brief shots of Thurman topless in a bathtub to highlight her vulnerability when a killer is nearby. Today it would only be a PG-13.

The elements of snow and rain and nighttime are used to help create an atmosphere many will love. Critics had strong reactions to this film on both ends of the star rating. The chemistry between Garcia and Thurman, and a mood captured and maintained, made this one a big success as far as I was concerned. I've always had sort of an affection for it, in fact, having seen it on the big screen years ago upon its initial release. Fans of the original C.S.I. from television will recognize elements and a mood sometimes found within that show. But Jennifer Eight was filmed years before. The final shot brings the viewer back nicely to the reason they've hung around till the end. If you like to pick apart plots, you probably won't enjoy it as much as those who lean towards atmosphere. A good one for Garcia's fans to enjoy, and a refreshing chance to see Thurman at her best.",1232064000,,3173,4.70990990990991

509277,4,6302763193,"As many of my fellow reviewers have noted in their reviews, this is a very understated, and underrated, thriller in the film noir tradition. Andy Garcia's character, to me, perfectly personified a police officer who'd had too many ugly years on the job, giving him a varnish of cynicism and brusqueness that translated into impatience with his new co-workers and surprising gentleness for his new star witness. Uma Thurman was terrific as a blind student who may or may not have something to add to the possible serial killer Garcia's character has discovered.  Her personification of a blind woman - the way she didn't focus her eyes, her fumbling hands - were sensitively done and, to me anyway, perfect. The scenery and camerawork are beautiful and juxtapose wonderfully with the violence and chase scenes.  However, am I the only reviewer who noticed that John Malkovich plays a dual role in this movie? He is the aggressive, sarcastic IA investigator who hammers Garcia's character, but he is ALSO the mentally challenged janitor. You know, the creepy one who is in the bathroom with Uma in that scene where she thinks she's alone, undresses and gets in the tub, completely in the dark (literally and figuratively.)  For sheer creepiness, that scene alone gets a 5-star rating. The rest gets 4 stars, mainly due to a couple of plot holes that are never tied up at the end.  Stellar performances from Garcia, Thurman, Malkovich and the rest of them.",1162598400,3,1453,4.894308943089431
509278,5,6302763193,"A superb thriller much maligned when first released, ""Jennifer8"" is first rate on all counts: acting (who plays conflicted, emotional, intelligent better than Andy Garcia? who plays sensitive yet powerful better than Uma Thurman?), directing and writing (Bruce Robinson's only directing credit...but this is the man who acted in Zefferelli's ""Romeo and Juliet,""  wrote the screenplay for ""The Killing Fields"" and was the object of Isabelle Adjani's obsession in ""The Story of Adele H"").
The plot involves a serial killer, a beautiful blind woman (Uma), a  Los Angeles police officer (Garcia) who, for mysterious reasons, decides to move to Eureka, California and a series of 7 murders.

Andy Garcia heats up the screen as an LA cop who relocates to a more serene environment in Eureka, California. Not so serene, however, when he finds himself looking into an open serial killer case.  Lance Henriksen eschews his usual villainous role to play Garcia's friend and partner who doesn't know what to make of Garcia's obsession with the apparently unsolveable case.  Uma Thurman is graceful as the blind Helena, who Garcia feels is in jeopardy as a possible witness.  Kathy Baker gives a controlled, effective performance as Lance's understanding and loving wife.  John Malkovich is brilliant in his brief but overwhelming role as as the internal affairs officer who wants to nail Garcia for murder.

509281,4,6302763193,"The first thought that springs to mind is 'UNDERRATED.' Andy Garcia plays a cop who has recently relocated. He stumbles onto a case that is only a small part of a much bigger picture. What evidence is available leads him to an institution for the blind. He then meets Uma Thurman. Uma is able to give him some information, but obviously, her blindness limits what evidence she can offer. But she offers some interesting bits of information that she can. (What the different cars sounded like....knowing that the killer knew how blind people shake hands....etc) Eventually, Garcia and Thurman strike up a more friendly relationship, and there are some really beautiful scenes. (Like when Garcia takes her on the boat and she is enjoying the sensation of the water falling on her.) I don't want to say too much and possibly ruin the movie for you, but suspense gradually builds, and Andy eventually finds himself facing dangerous accusations, and of course Uma finds herself in danger as well. While the pace of this movie may seem on the slower side, it is well done. (Sometimes this is done so we get a chance to know the characters.) Without ruining the ending, there is an unusally frightening moment towards the end where Uma has to defend herself, and her blindness differentiates this climactic moment from other movies. This movie was made in 92, but it has charm from the 70s and 80s. The scenery is beautiful; the background music fits into the story (rather than being a commercial for new tapes/cds on the market). For some reason, a lot of people who made movies in the 90s decided that for a movie to work, there have to be an absurd amount of special effects; someone has to get beaten up or killed every 5 minutes; there has to be a lot of cursing; and humor only works on a slapstick level. Interestingly, this movie currently only has a few reviews, and some of them are on the lower side. To all of you reading this, sometimes a great deal of value is found in the more obscure things. WARNING: DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED BECAUSE THIS MOVIE ONLY HAS A FEW REVIEWS WITH SOME OF THEM NEGATIVE.

The music and mood make this picture.  You have to soak in the pace.  The ending is great.  All movies have to end, and sometimes they are disappointing, but this has a great twist.  I saw it in the theaters and it was a shock.  I immediately wanted to see this movie again the next showing.

The supporting characters are great...perfectly cast.  They stand in their own right and never interfere with the stars of the movie.  This movie isn't without its flaws, but it is very good.  Don't watch it alone at night, especially when it is raining.  A great movie watching with friends on a cold night.

Then there's Malkovich!  This movie is my first witness to his masterful style and personality.  He was great in In the Line of Fire and owns that type of character.  Here, he plays such a stylistic FBI agent and you become drawn into his confidence...you don't hear a script with Malk, just his strong personality.

509284,3,6302763193,"Writer/Director Bruce Robinson, best known for his cult hit ""Withnail & I"", has crafted a creditable little thriller in ""Jennifer 8"".  It gets all the technical elements right, features some fine work from its actors, and does its best to screw around with the genre.  But it rarely adds up to anything more than the sum of its parts.
One of the strengths of Robinson's script is the stylish and effective dialogue he gives to his police officers.  Most of the best bits come from the mouth of Sergeant Ross, like when he tells his wife he can't stay for dinner because it's ""Friday night at City Hall... I've got a chance to frighten the fat.""  He's talking about securing a confession from a suspect, but it hardly matters, doesn't it?  ""Where are the ladies?"" asks Sergeant Berlin, before a party.  ""Putting on the warpaint,"" comes Ross' reply.  My favourite line, and probably the film's most ostentatious, is this little nugget which falls from the mouth of a visiting FBI investigator: ""You're confused... you don't know if Tuesdays come in twos or happen once a week.""  It's the kind of raw poetry that Quentin Tarantino specializes in (or at least has learned to crib from Elmore Leonard).
Andy Garcia carries the movie on his shoulders.  His John Berlin (quite the pregnant name, as the film was released three years to the month after The Wall came down; are John's walls ready to crumble too?  Stay tuned...) is a rather complex man, burdened by a shady past that is slowly alluded to, but never fully explained (""I feel like I said sorry on every street in [Los Angeles],"" is the closest he comes to an explanation).  Berlin is a model of patience and intuition (although I didn't buy the one moment of inspiration that lead him to his key witness; it's a ""movie moment"" that takes away from the reality Robinson is trying to inject into the film), quiet and reserved for most of the film, but prone to fits of rage when pushed.  It's almost like Garcia, fresh off of working with Al Pacino, was modeling his character on that actor's work as Michael Corleone in the first two ""Godfather"" films.  That's high praise, indeed, but Garcia's work here deserves it.
Uma Thurman plays Helena Robertson, ""the worst witness [Berlin's] ever had,"" a blind music teacher who may be the only witness able to identify the man that killed 'Jennifer'.  And what fates do ""only witnesses"" usually have in suspense films?  They're the next victim, of course!  Which gives Berlin a great excuse to stay close Helena, and fall in love with her.  Thurman here really only has two jobs: to look adorable and play blind credibly.  The first, of course, she does with ease.  I've always thought of Thurman as kind of a female-version of Keanu Reeves: she's at her best when not saying much, and letting her physicality and obvious screen presence carry much of the load.  Which she gets to do here.  As for that second job, portraying Helena's blindness, Thurman achieves some semblance of credibility there.  Affecting a dead-eyed look, you believe her as a blind girl, albeit one with startling mobility.
Lance Henriksen does what Lance Henriksen does best: he makes a rugged, [angry], misanthropic and misogynistic cop, constantly stuck in fourth gear, come across as rather likable.  In his hands, with that map of the world face and baritone voice, Sergeant Freddy Ross is almost endearing.  He's a big fish in a small pond, the kind of small town man who would name his boat ""Duke"" and not think twice about vocally ogling the... of the local waitresses.  He and Garcia have kind of an oil-and-water relationship, but Henriksen's over-the-top showiness meshes perfectly with Garcia's solemnity.
The one way in which the film doesn't play fair with its audience is in listing John Malkovich's name in the opening credits, and then making us wait eighty-minutes before the man shows up.  But when he does, that distinctive whisper of a voice is heard before the face appears, it's vintage Malk.
He plays an FBI investigator named St. Anne, who locks horns with Berlin in several lengthy scenes.  Watching Garcia match wits with Malk is a real treat, the latter man's cool and whimsical aura offering a perfect counterpoint to the former's repressed fire.  In Malk's hands, St. Anne has seen it all, giving himself leeway to toy with Berlin, trying to catch him in verbal traps and constantly rolling his eyes.  But, like Garcia, Malk is able to let his instrument loose, erupting in violent outbursts periodically, which show the character's true power.  And in a silly bit of business, Malk, for some reason, chooses to play the latter half of his scenes with a rather comic stuffed nose.
Being an avid fan of the serial killer genre, I was looking forward to finally seeing ""Jennifer 8"".  It lived up to my expectations, mostly, but for some reason I just couldn't fully give my heart to it.  I liked it well enough, but it never gave me the visceral thrill I was hoping for.  I suspect the reason for this is that this kind of story has been done many times before, often with much more verve and wit and fun.  Seen in the shadows of the heavyweights of its genre, ""Jennifer 8"" is a workmanlike effort, sure to give a modicum of thrills.  I recommend it on an intellectual level, but have my doubts about its effectiveness on an emotional one.",1031097600,24,5339,4.722761596548004

7830761,4,6302763193,"I have always really enjoyed Jennifer 8 - it is definitely one of the more under-rated and effective 90s thrillers.

The early 90s really was a golden era in terms of detective thrillers and whodunnits. Aside from the well-known thrillers such as Silence of the Lambs and Basic Instinct, there were plenty of others, of varying quality, such as Frantic, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, Malice, Final Analysis, Single White Female, Deceived, Sliver, Sleeping with the Enemy, Under Suspicion, Disclosure, Consenting Adults, Fear, White Sands, Dead Again, Unlawful Entry and Pacific Heights.

Of all of the second-tier thrillers, I find Jennifer 8 to the most interesting and haunting. As someone else has commented, since it promises so much, the end product is also slightly disappointing.

The film starts brilliantly - I love the damp, drizzly scenes at the rubbish dump where the mystery begins with a dead tramp, a dead dog and a severed hand among the steaming wet bin bags. It really sets the atmosphere well. After that the film definitely has a tendency to drift, but I don't mind that, it's not a hurried film. But it definitely could be tighter - the initial discovery that the victims might be blind and the revelation that a serial killer may be at work are really clever and gripping and the later investigation in Oakland is really tense and well handled. The internal affairs investigation with John Malkovich is a bigger problem: it feels like it belongs to a different film. It certainly should have been a lot shorter. It really feels as if it were included simply to showcase Malkovich's scene-chewing acting tour de force, but it slows the film as it is building to a climax and diverts attention away from the central mystery. As for the climax, it is strangely truncated given the slow previous pacing. Personally, I am glad it doesn't have a ridiculous coming-back-from-the-dead-a-dozen-times ending that is so common in thrillers, but the fact it doesn't even really feature the main character is odd.

By 1992 Andy Garcia was being talked about as a future Hollywood leading man. He had been in The Untouchables, Internal Affairs and The Godfather Part III and the magazines Empire and Premiere were touting him as the next big thing. Jennifer 8 tanked at the box office and Garcia never did become the big move star, with arguably his bad guy role in Oceans 11, 12 and 13 perhaps his most well known. I am not really surprised he never became a star (though the early 90s was still dominated by action starts like Bruce Willis, Stallone and Schwarzenegger), he just didn't have the charisma, likeability and vulnerability of someone like Michael Douglas who would have been far better in the role. In Jennifer 8 I never cease to feel that Garcia is miscast. I just don't believe that he is close to Lance Henriksen and his family and I have a hard time swallowing his relationship with Uma Thurman. His behaviour is also unexplained - his animosity and conflict with his colleagues comes out of the blue as do his outbursts.

In contrast, Lance Henriksen is perfectly cast. It's hard to think of anyone who could have performed the role better. A very young Uma Thurman is delicate and beautiful but doesn't have a lot of lines and spends a lot of the time just simpering and stumbling. Thurman is almost too young, ethereal and vulnerable; a tougher, older woman might have been better. Ellen Barkin was brilliant in Sea of Love and she would have been a more interesting Helena.

The script by Bruce Robinson doesn't contain any memorable zingers and is not quotable like his debut feature, but that suits the picture; it is about a police investigation in a sleepy, rural northern California town. Robinson was also the director and at that time one of the Brits looking to take over Hollywood (like Michael Caton Jones) after the cult success of Withnail & I and How to Get Ahead in Advertising. The experience was evidently so bad he didn't direct another film until 2011.

Jennifer 8 is not a film that would be made theatrically today (perhaps it would make a short TV series). Unlike the current obsession with very small depth of field photography, lots of focus pulling and choppy, frantic editing and camera wobbles, Jennifer 8 feels positively sedate by comparison. It is languid with lingering shots of isolated cabins in the snow and cars driving along deserted lanes. The great cinematography really adds to the haunting, claustrophobic atmosphere, and that is where the film really excels. It's one I can't stop thinking about after watching, as at its best it really is quite disturbing and affecting. As early 90s thrillers go, it really is one of the best.

Finally, I watched this on blu ray. The quality is fine but nothing special, this is definitely not a film that shows off high definition in any way, but it looks reasonably sharp and clean.",1496620800,,4892,4.808561236623068
