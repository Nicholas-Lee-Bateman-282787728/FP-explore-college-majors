3705433,5,B001N26GSY,"I bought the DVD for my boyfriend's birthday, and it was a perfect gift! He  (and I) love Ricky Gervais. This stand-up special is very funny. I highly recommend it! Well done Ricky! Carry on!",1241654400,2,191,4.457142857142857
3705434,5,B001N26GSY,"I think that this is the best stand up ever. You have to be smart and listen to what he says to get this movie. I showed it to some of my friends and nothing, it weeds out the stupid.",1241481600,3,183,3.6
3705435,5,B001N26GSY,"Ricky Gervais is a comedian who is not afraid to push the boundaries of good taste.

In this 72-minute special, filmed during his successful tour of the United States, the British funnyman not only pokes fun at charities that help the mentally and physically challenged, but also the Holocaust.

The amazing thing is that you find yourself laughing out loud, sometimes uncontrollably, at the humor Gervais finds in these ordinarily taboo subjects.

He also does extended hilarious routines on the male sexual organ and even Humpty Dumpty.

Gervais is, indeed, one of the funniest comedians of this generation.

Included on the DVD is a conversation with Gervais.

3705436,1,B001N26GSY,"I actually attended this show last year and was very disappointed that it is just the best bits from his 3 other stand-up DVDs (Animals, Politics and Fame). If you've seen those, then there is no reason to buy this DVD. If you haven't, well then I'd recommend you get the other 3 indiviually rather than this 'Greatest Hits'.",1240272000,6,325,4.52542372881356
3705437,3,B001N26GSY,"I'm a big fan of ""The Office"" - the original created by Gervais, not the US version - and have enjoyed the interviews added to those DVDs. I missed this show on HBO last year and caught up with it on the DVD.

While not a ""stand up"" comic per se, Gervais is more of a ""story teller"" and some of those on this DVD are pieces I'll remember for a while. Others are somewhat offensive - though that's what Gervais is trying to make fun of. They can just be a bit uncomfortable. Also, most  lower-level stand-up comedians I've seen have to resort to ""male member"" jokes to try to get a laugh. They usually fail, except for young kids who are hearing these for the first time. Gervais hits his low points when he resorts to a riff on the size of his, shall I refer to it as, ""male member"". (Note that he uses cruder language in the show.)

The show is not very long (70 minutes) and there is a 10-minute ""Interview"" as a bonus - though half of that 10 minutes is devoted to replaying scenes you've already seen in the concert.

I'm hoping he'll go back to writing comedy shows like ""The Office"" and ""Extras"". He's had his 15 minutes (actually 70 minutes) of ""stand up"" fame.

3705439,2,B001N26GSY,"It made my mom laugh.  I guess this is good.  It just seems like he's going through the motions.  I think Fosters beer sponsored this thing.  He keeps drinking from his can of Fosters and it just seems like he was getting paid for it.  Also, could someone who has seen this explain to me his joke about 'going commando'?  I know it's a stupid point but I don't think from his routine that he knows what it means to go commando.  Whatever, Gervais rules, but I think we all expected a little more from this stand up.",1238457600,3,515,4.1938775510204085

3705441,5,B001N26GSY,"I watched this special on HBO over Thanksgiving 2008, and it was one of the funniest acts I have seen in awhile.  I would consider Ricky Gervais on the fast track to one of the best comedians ever.  His humor while edgy at times, is extremely clever.  I am a huge fan of George Carlin (R.I.P.), Larry Miller, and Bill Cosby, and Ricky Gervais can entertain using anyone of the styles used by these comedians.  Some parts you don't watch this with your children or grandmother and others are perfectly fine for anyone.  This is one is on my list of must haves.",1231977600,18,559,4.388349514563107

3705468,5,B001N26GSY,"..... hysterical.  I love the british comedians.  Benny Hill & Monty Python started it all for me.

Tho Ricky Gervais can have quite the ""potty"" mouth his materials are intended for mature audiences and not for children.  There are no boundaries for this funny man and nothing is held back.

He expresses his views on many a topic with the funniest of ides.

Highly recommend to adults who can enjoy this refreshing man from the UK.

so far have watched about 10 or more times, doesn't get old, so far, to watch",1365638400,,299,3.6875

3705474,5,B001N26GSY,"We watched this three times in a row the first night we got it.  He's raw, he doesn't hold back and if you like that kind of thing, you'll laugh... a lot.  And then you'll watch it again and laugh some more.  He doesn't hold back - He picks on everyone and everything including kids with cancer and obese people.  It's Ricky - It's what you have come to expect from him.  He's now on my list of those I need to see live after watching this DVD.",1327881600,,444,4.0
3705475,5,B001N26GSY,Great DVD. He is very funny. It is british Humor but still funny for an American also. Shipment was fast and in great condition.,1324771200,,128,4.375
3705476,3,B001N26GSY,"Sort of a terrible version of his other routines.  Out of England only reminds me that he's so much better IN England.  American audiences don't suffer much from all of the British references, so I felt this was unneeded.  Not really any notable extras, picture quality so-so, packaging very cheap.",1320278400,,298,4.92
3705477,2,B001N26GSY,"I watched and watched this guy's routine and just didn't find him funny. After paying the rent fee for this, I could only watch about 15 mins so I wouldn't feel like I wasted my time along with my money.",1307664000,,203,4.1
3705478,5,B001N26GSY,"Somehow I got the feeling that Ricky was toning the show down for the American audience.  I think what he would say about Americans to the British would be far more entertaining.

Still, he is soooo funny.

I only wish he did less phallic and penis jokes, and stuck more to sex-neutral themes.  For example, his take on nursery rhymes is hilarious.  Sex is so overdone, cheap, lowest common denominator, and repetitive.  It takes real wit to shed light on seemingly harmless stuff like children's songs.",1296086400,,503,4.790697674418604

3705480,5,B001N26GSY,"Keeping this review short and sweet. Ricky is hilarious and delivers one of his best stand ups ever. His deliver is so genuine and you get a bit of his character from The Office. Awkward at times but can be a bit cocky when joking on people. I was laughing hard the whole way through and love the fact he called the US a ""third world country"". Highly recommended.",1294617600,2,363,4.27536231884058
3705481,5,B001N26GSY,"Ricky Gervais is hilariously funny, whether it be on his special or as a guest on The Daily Show or Ellen.  His is a great clean humor that doesn't miss.  If you have the chance to see him on ANYTHING, take that chance and you'll not be disappointed!",1254355200,,250,4.1875
3705482,2,B001N26GSY,"Ricky Gervais is not perfect, thank goodness. Obviously his second show Extras wasn't as good as The Office. But no show would be and Extras was in fact quite funny on its own terms. So he did seem a bit infallible. But while he's been a big success doing stand-up (which is still highly regarded in the UK), his first special feels a bit forced. So, funny at moments (especially that goofy cover costume) but not SO funny that we will all feel inferior forever. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com.",1245369600,2,496,4.461538461538462
