8193513,5,B000PUBA7W,"R. D. Laing ... if you're old enough, the name will conjure the heady days of the 1960s, and the dazzling (if sometimes disorienting) pages of ""The Politics of Experience"" ... the emphasis on ""breakdown as breakthrough"" ... the fierce & fiery denunciations of not only the psychiatric establishment, but all establishments, especially the power pyramid of the family.

And then what?

Laing's fame & influence faded with the passing decades, and he suffered unjust dismissal by his peers & by history at the time of his death in 1989. No question that he was sometimes a flawed human being -- who isn't? Certainly the specifics of some of his theories have been largely discredited -- by the establishment, of course! Perhaps with some just cause, too.

Even so, what emerges in this fine, insightful film is the portrait of a passionate, driven, often tormented man striving to help his fellow human beings, to see his patients as flesh & blood individuals first, rather than as convenient labels from a diagnostic manual. Deeply suspicious of the way in which mainstream society so easily equated ""different"" with ""mentally ill"" -- even more suspicious of the ways in which anguished outsiders were marginalized & their personal experiences denied in the name of the status quo -- Laing comes across as a man wounded by his own upbringing, but also made sensitive to suffering because of it.

In several sequences, actual patients allowed themselves to be filmed discussing their lives & wounds with Laing. The courage & vulnerability on display here is stunning ... and so is the degree of trust they show in Laing. And clearly that trust was honored in full. Laing makes the point about simply ""being with"" the patient several times in the course of the film, as one human being with another, and its importance cannot be understated.

What must be realized & remembered about Laing is that he was as much a philosopher, visionary, and even angry prophet as he was a psychiatrist. As such, he never fit any pre-cut social niche; and also as such, he made a lot of powerful enemies. Nowadays nearly all emotional problems -- ""problems"" rather than ""gaping wounds"" is so much nicer, isn't it? --are treated solely as biochemical in nature, to be resolved with (or concealed by) medication. Granted, sometimes medication is the proper response ... but these days things have swung so far to the pharmacological that actual treatment of the soul, of pain, of suffering, is an afterthought at best. So many psychiatrists & psychologists have had to abandon any sort of in-depth therapy in favor of pills, because the insurance companies & their profit-minded bean-counters won't allow anything else. Laing would have been properly scathing about this!

He saw it coming, of course. Just as he saw the ways in which a diagnostic manual could be used to control & suppress dissidents, or anyone who refuses to accept the official story promulgated by society. In works such as ""Knots"" he explored the cruel & insurmountable double-binds that both families & societies use to control errant children/citizens. His was a constant voice for the helpless & oppressed against the social mandate for conformity at all costs.

By the time the film ended, I was in a somewhat contemplative mood, all the more aware of the fragility & needless suffering of so many human beings. And so much of it is unnecessary, inflicted upon one another for reasons we don't permit ourselves to know. Above all else, Laing made it his life's work to shed light on those dark places, and to give his patients the chance to emerge from that darkness.

When you watch this film, pay special attention to Laing's face & expressions, particularly in his quieter moments. That's just as revealing as his words, which are rich food for thought. You'll come away with the sense of having encountered a remarkable man, and perhaps even the desire to examine your own life more deeply. Most highly recommended!",1329004800,5,3974,4.9120715350223545
