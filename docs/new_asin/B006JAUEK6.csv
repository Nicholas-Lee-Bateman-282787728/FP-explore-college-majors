4992915,5,B006JAUEK6,Candace Cameron Bure and David James Elliot are Fantastic in this movie.  They made a terrific couple.  This is a family movie you can watch with your whole family and not be worried about foul language or sexual overtones!  I really loved it.  It proves that Honesty is always the best policy!  I loved the ending.  I guarantee that anyone who watches this movie will love it too!,1394064000,2,381,4.529411764705882
4992916,5,B006JAUEK6,"It is fun and teaching everyone how important to be truthful.  Candace and David made a beautiful couple with 2 teenage kids.  I loved the performance of Chris.  Since I am used to see David in JAG who flies in F-14 and F-18, I had to chuckle when he got air sick and terrified riding in a helicopter.  In his real life he claims he never got sick flying with Blue Angels.",1392940800,,372,4.125
4992917,5,B006JAUEK6,Saw the preview for this in a store had to have it cause I love both major characters.  After watching it almost all the way through i realize I had seen it on tv.  But still love the movie.,1383177600,,190,3.8461538461538463
4992918,5,B006JAUEK6,"I think Candace Cameron is a terrific comic actress, and I have seen her in several movies which I enjoyed immensely.  David James Elliot is also a very charismatic actor.  These two should do romantic comedies more often.",1381017600,,222,4.815789473684211
4992919,5,B006JAUEK6,"Like the tilte implies: Truth to be told is the message of the story, nicely and funny told. You can also get involved with a whole family which is carrying their package of daily struggels within the different family member generations.",1376870400,,237,4.804878048780488
4992920,5,B006JAUEK6,"I have always loved David James Elliot, ever since he starred in JAG. This movie is a different story for him. LOVE!!! Between him and Candace Cameron Bure it is pure family entertainment. I laughed and yelled so much. It was just what the Dr. would order. If you haven't seen it then this has got to be on your to do list. Love, love, loved it!!!",1375747200,,347,4.1940298507462686
4992921,5,B006JAUEK6,"This was a movie that I enjoyed very much!

Great acting and important truths!",1362700800,,236,4.642857142857143

4992936,4,B006JAUEK6,Not as enjoyable as other Candance Cameron Bure movies.  Alot of her shows have the same basic themes so they are a little less interesting.,1447891200,2,140,4.6
4992937,5,B006JAUEK6,"Mark Crane (DJE) is desperate to find funding for his after-school sports program.  At a charity event he meets Bishop's (Ronny Cox) son who says there is at best a slim chance for consideration by his father.  Annie Morgan (Burre) is there with a friend who is also seeking funding.  Annie meets and impressed the elder Bishop and he calls her to visit at his NM ranch to interview for a talk show on his radio station.  He emphasizes that she bring her family.  Mark loved Annie from first sight when she tutored him in college, but she transferred to another college and he lost touch.  He married and had 2 children.  His wife died at home, with only the young daughter at her side, 3 years ago.  Mark recognizes Annie at the charity event and the 4 of them pose for a picture.  The Bishops think they are a family, so when he insists Annie bring her family with her for the weekend, she and Mark decide to pose as a family.  It's a rewarding weekend in many ways, and Bishop offers her the job and Mark his funding...until they disclose their deceit.  In a typical family movie ending, everything works out.  It's a great story to watch again and again.",1443916800,2,1158,4.410377358490566

4992940,3,B006JAUEK6,"This was a cute movie, but not cute enough to be worth a second viewing. All of the actors did a good job and the importance of correcting a lie in a family and in a business relationship was just one part of the story.  There was also the sweet history of the H&h having known each other in college and the ability of the h to counsel people including the H's daughter who had lost her mother.  The setting was rich with every toy the country had to offer--horses and scooters, etc.--and everything worked out so easily that it just wasn't very interesting IMO.",1437523200,,562,4.3428571428571425
4992941,2,B006JAUEK6,"I fell in love with a little movie Candace was it called ""Finding Normal"", so set out to watch everything she was in. I didn't hate this, but didn't like it either. The fact that the parents involved their children in a lie, offset any attraction for the romance. I was intrigued with the premise, but am not interested in watching it again.",1436918400,3,341,4.428571428571429

She truly loves her fans.  I saw this at walmart and have been wanting to see it.....and then I noticed it was a few dollars cheaper on amazon, so I ordered it off here.  I watched it, then my parents actually watched it too.....we all loved it.  Such a cute movie!  Family appropriate......and a good lesson in it as well!",1498435200,,475,4.053763440860215

You have to love this type of movie to watch.
I could have wrote a better story.",1496102400,,108,3.9545454545454546
