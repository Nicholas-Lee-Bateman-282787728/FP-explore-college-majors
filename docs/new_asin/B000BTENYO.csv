Each show has matches & coming from Iraq along with the troops shouting out family & friends at home and footage of WWE wrestlers visiting the troops and various sites in Iraq.  Disc one is the SmackDown from Iraq in '03 with APA vs. Hass & Benjamin, Rikishi vs. Rhyno, Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit, John Cena vs. Big Show and special appearances by Mr. McMahon, Stone Cold, Sable, Dawn Marie, and Torrie Wilson.

8092451,5,B000BTENYO,"This something that should be done by more American companys. The WWE did somthing that needed to be done for our troops in the war zone, Bob Hope was the man that made life better for our troops and I guess WWE filled that void, it's too bad this was the only war zone they went to because with 2 fronts it need to be done every month till the troops come home. If you love this country, then you will love this dvd. God bless America...",1277424000,,438,4.045977011494253

TRIBUTE TO THE TROOPS

{I felt the need to review this and feel all patriotic because one of my friends just came back [here's to you Jose] and one just left [Mason], so to them and the rest of our Armed Forces I thank you guys}

First off I must say that I could care less if you agree with me or not any thing that supports the troops is a 5 star worthy thing, so the DVD is 5 stars as is every match because this was not for us this was for them. Whether you support or hate this or the previous administration in the White House the one constant should be the unwavering support for the people who put their lives on the line daily for us. Another thing is I hate that every news channel out there has never really covered what the WWE does every year for the troops. Vince and company every year go over seas to put on these shows for them and the media never mentions a thing. Also all the wrestlers and WWE crew that go over there for these events are volunteers, so I thank all of them for doing this for them. I have fam and friends over there and one of my best friends in the service was actually at one of these shows [not on this set but one of the following ones] so I know the troops really do appreciate this. Of course it starts off with Vince thanking the troops for all that they do only to be stunned by Santa I mean Stone Cold. There is also a rap from John Cena, a Santa's little helper segment and much more but it is the segments with the troops getting to know them that is the best about this set.

1. WORLD'S GREATEST TAG TEAM VS APA-really fun match right here that the troops seemed to really enjoy. I could care less what people say about JBL but that guy helped set all these tributes to the troops up so he gets crazy amounts of respect from me. The match is great as APA really destroy these two and take home the win for the troops. 5/5

2. RIKISHI VS RHYNO-another really fun match that the troops are all about and it gets right down to business with the baby face winning and then delivering a stink face. Of course it would not be a tribute with out some of our brave women in the armed forces dancing with the Kish. Great moment and makes me smile every time I watch it. 5/5

3. EDDIE GUERRERO VS CHRIS BENOIT-one of the best matches from the entire set as if you did not know that. These two put on one of the best matches for the troops going back and forth and hitting some high spots. Each hitting their moves they are known for trying to end the other. Eddie gets the win on this one with his classic lie/cheat/steal ways, the show continues afterwards for the troops with a nice USA chant. 5/5

4. BIG SHOW VS JOHN CENA-as mentioned earlier when Cena was rapping for the troops he went at it with the Big Show. The contest is dominated for the most part by Show but of course Cena pulls out the win for the troops. But his celebration is short due to Stone Cold laying him flat along side The Big Show. A great match to end the show with. 5/5

DISC 2

This is the following year's event over seas for the troops and of course it is great as well. We get Vince of course at the beginning as well as Santa again this time played by Mick Foley. There is also a lot more great moments but like the last time the best moments come from the solders them selves.

1. RENE DUPREE VS BOOKER T-the first match of the evening was great as these two go at it for the crowd. Dupree is the classic villain in this one and of course looks as if he will win it. But the baby face Booker T pulls out the victory to the applause of the troops. 5/5

2. UNDERTAKER VS HEIDENREICH-great match right here that took place during their feud at the time. The match is actually back and forth more than I thought it would be only to end in a count out. Taker starts to take it to him and he tries to escape only for the troops to keep him from leaving. 5/5

3. HARDCORE HOLLY VS KENZO SUZUKI-another wonderful match for the troops to enjoy as these two underrated talents went at it. It is a great back and forth battle but in the end Holly pulls out the victory. I don't care what others say I have always liked Holly and he is actually one of my favorites. 5/5

4. REY MYSTERIO, EDDIE GUERRERO VS KURT ANGLE, LUTHER REIGNS-the main event from this one is a great contest between these great athletes. The battle they put on is great and the ""good guys"" hit some great high spots for the crowd. The match is great and ends with Rey and Eddie taking the victory followed by Eddie thanking the troops. 5/5

This disc is full of bonus features that showcase the trips over there and every thing. I recommend buying this and adding it to your collection. I can't commend Vince and company enough for doing this every year for the men and women that represent this country. So as I am 30 minutes away from the largest military base here in the states Fort Hood in Killeen Texas I say thank you to all of the troops.",1248912000,,4934,4.105809128630705
8092453,5,B000BTENYO,"Any pro wrestling DVD is a snapshot of a particular moment in time, with a ""main event"" storyline possibly stale before the material reaches the stores. But these events chronicled on two DVD's are much more than the typical releases...or matches.

The talent may appear in character, but they toss the soap opera-styled scripts aside for these special events, while reminding fans at home of the sacrifices from the men and women in the military. The matches are from the 2003 and 2004 tours, along with bonus material that includes tour highlights from the WWE program, Confidential.

The performers include Undertaker, Hardcore Holly, Kurt Angle, Eddie Guerrero, John Cena and Big Show, along with several of the WWE Divas. The set is oftentimes difficult to find, but is one of the best releases in the bulky DVD catalog of the company.",1231286400,,840,4.950354609929078

Some good action and alot of bonus features about the tour. If you can get it at the price I paid, then its worth it. Over ten dollars and its not.",1196294400,,285,4.107142857142857
