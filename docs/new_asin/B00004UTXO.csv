7924065,5,B00004UTXO,"This video contains episodes 11-13 and on episode 12 Heero awakens and  mistakenly thinks that Catherine Bloom is Relena! Trowa informs Heero that  he has been unconsious for a WHOLE month and that there have been no  missions for the Gundams since Heero self-detotnated. In episode 13 Trowa  decides that it would be in his best intrest to self-detotnate too,but  Cathering cries and claims that Trowa is selfish. He feels guilty and  decides he would rather not destroy himself. Trowa then asks Heero what he  would have done and claims that Heero would have gone through with  eliminating himself. Heero reminds Trowa that he said to ""Act on your  emotions"",and tells Trowa that's exactly what he did. Catherine  angrily blames Heero for Trowa's suicidal actions and claims that he won't  get away so easy next time. Over all,this an excellent video and I highly  recommend it!!! I can't wait for 'Endless Waltz' to be aired! (BTW, Heero  is my favorite character(except for his -100 personality)and I think  Trowa,Duo,and Quatre are really cool too!) Did you know that Trowa is  REALLY Triton Bloom (Catherine's younger brother)??Also!!!Heero's father  was an assasian and left Heero when he was a newborn baby!!Duo's actual  name is Solo, and his close friend (Duo) was murdered in the war,so....  Duo(Solo) named himself Duo! Note: Duo(Solo) was going to be a priest, but  when his friend was killed, he decided to abandon that idea! Well....Thank  you for listening to me!  Sincerely, Relena ^_-",969235200,15,1502,5.048979591836734
7924066,5,B00004UTXO,"This tape has three awesome episodes.  It contains episodes 11-13 and has lots of action.  Relena picks off a rose on Lady Une's military uniform  with deadly accuracy, the Maguanac Corps dukes it out with Oz, and Trowa  literally brings down the house during a circus performance at an Oz base.  This is a must have video for any Gundam Wing fan.  This is the Uncut  version so things like bad language and blood(not shown in the edited  version that is shown during its 5:30 Toonami time slot) are included.",965606400,9,509,4.5777777777777775
