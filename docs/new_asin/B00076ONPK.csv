You can't even hear the interview over the very loud music in the background.  Don't even think of wasting your money on this trash. This is coming from a very loyal and aware Last Poets fan.",1242604800,2,344,4.246153846153846
8045036,2,B00076ONPK,"This video (and its companion piece ""Last Poets Interview"") is very poorly done.  I own both VHS tapes and they are THE SAME FOOTAGE!  The sound quality is very disgusting, whomever filmed and recorded the interview did a piss-poor job.  The camera stays on Ole-Woye more than Umar Bin Hassan, and you can't even hear what Umar says when interviewed!

These are VERY neophyte and ameturish in production and quality.  I wasted my money purchasing these tapes.  I met the Last Poets when they came to Sacramento, CA and they are cool, down to earth people.  I'm sorry that these videos are out in the public, it does them a great disservice.

DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!",1176940800,6,663,4.655172413793103
