5681416,5,B00BXWIMQS,"Realistic look at a dark corner of Canada wrapped in a compelling story with a shocking twist.

Amanda Crew shines as the fallen angel seeking justice.  We definitely need to see more of Ms. Crew in mainstream cinema.

Highly recommended!!!",1370390400,7,240,4.95

Excellent film. Superbly acted. Dark, Unrelenting in it's bleakness. Until the unfortunate saccharine ending. Suddenly we are to believe all the elements conveniently come together and both our heroes not only resolve all their life problems but redeem themselves as well. It's a false ending unfortunately. I have no problem with a happy ending but not when it does not arrive realistically from the events. It's a shame to see such a good film blow the ending with half a dozen unrealistic sudden developments.",1439251200,,540,5.067415730337078

8575209,4,B00BXWIMQS,"There's always some risk in viewing a low-budget production, but I was pleased with both the story and acting in this one.  Both Glen Gould and Amanda Crew turn in nice performances that pull you into the story and make you invested in the characters and their plight.

Glen Gould plays a washed-up boxer and ex-con who gets hired to rescue a runaway, played by Amanda Crew, from a life surrounded by drugs and criminals.  It's not clear whether she'll come willingly, so he enters the situation appropriately prepared.  Things rapidly go downhill as the story unfolds, and he soon finds himself dealing with more than he bargained for.

Low-budget indies live or die by their casting decisions more so than most films, but some good choices were made here that really helped bring the story to life and give it credibility.  I'd not heard of Glen Gould before, but he gives a solid, convincing performance as the somewhat taciturn ex-boxer engaged in morally grey actions to try to get back on his feet.  Amanda Crew is not well-known either, but her fine, gritty performance here as the young woman being rescued really helped to get one emotionally invested in both characters and hope that they find a way out of their situation.  She displays a nice balance between streetwise wariness/intelligence and a sense of vulnerability.  This helps us to identify with her when circumstances later in the story present some difficult choices.

The rest of the cast are unknowns or actors that tend to appear in lesser supporting roles, but I found most to be good choices who gave pretty reasonable performances.  This is a fairly dark landscape of humanity overall, and the players did a credible job in bringing it to life.  There are weaknesses in the screenplay as some aspects of the story were underdeveloped, but the core plotline was sufficient to give the actors something to work with.  Lastly, as an American viewer I appreciated some of the local color stemming from a story set in Canada and a few of the characters being members of an indigenous tribe.

I recommend this film to anyone who likes off-the-mainstream indie dramas filled with tense situations.  The performances by Gould and Crew are particularly engaging and are good reasons to see this movie.",1399075200,,2270,4.85974025974026
8575210,5,B00BXWIMQS,Amanda Crew is a great actor that is vastly under rated. I have bought several movies she has starred in and enjoyed everyone.,1398384000,,126,4.521739130434782
8575211,2,B00BXWIMQS,"Wonderfully acted movie down to every part in a thoroughly disturbing film. Kidnapping, violence, off screen child molestation are featured in this film.",1381622400,,153,5.695652173913044
8575212,4,B00BXWIMQS,"i liked the movie, i watch so many movies, i find it cheaper than going to the movies, and for the price you would pay for one month. you can see alot of movies, esp staying up on the lastest",1376956800,2,191,3.8

Thought the story was interesting the whole way through and the acting was great.
I'd recommend it :-)",1376611200,2,183,4.411764705882353
8575214,5,B00BXWIMQS,THIS MOVIE IS VERY GOOD. VERY WELL WRITTEN AND WITH A MULTI-FACETED PLOT. GOOD ACTING WITH VERY LIKEABLE MAIN CHARACTER. REALY DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY ANY OF THE MANY SURPRISES SO YOU WILL JUST HAVE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.,1372118400,7,263,4.387755102040816
8575215,3,B00BXWIMQS,"Avery (Glen Gould) is a prize fighter turned street fighter/dock worker. He is hired to rescue Jan (Amanda Crew) from a smack house to return to her parents. He runs into some issues as Jan really doesn't want to be rescued at this time and there are all kinds of people looking for her and will kill anyone who gets in the way. Avery gets in deep, and stays committed as the story takes a twist.

This is a crime/drama with some action. The characters didn't grab you. There was nothing special about the twist, in fact it made the film cliche and formulaic. Glen Gould plays a rather boring leading man. It makes for an acceptable Canadian rental at best.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity.",1371254400,,701,4.46875
