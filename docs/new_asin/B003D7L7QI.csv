8394709,5,B003D7L7QI,"This is a story of a man who never has or will compromise his artistic vision. His demons keep popping up to haunt him at times, but he perseveres. He's a tough cookie. I found his story to be both inspirational and a bit tragic in some parts as well. At the end of the day Andre Williams lives up to his own code and though he sometimes slips up into his own frailities, his will and intentions are good, and he makes no apologies. And well he shouldn't.",1272931200,,455,4.123595505617978
