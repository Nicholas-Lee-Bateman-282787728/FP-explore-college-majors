3895362,5,B002BUDY7I,I was very happy to get this DVD.  It is a lot of fun to watch Frederic create so many dishes that are lo-fat.  It is what I have been looking for. The instructions are clear and the dishes yummy.  It goes perfectly with the second DVD in this series.,1248134400,5,251,3.98
3895363,5,B002BUDY7I,"When I first started a raw vegan diet, it was a high fat raw vegan diet, filled with raw analogs of everyone's favorite ""cooked junk food"" - raw pizza, raw cookies and cakes, etc. I could never stick to it and reverted back to cooked food (ironically, my cooked vegan diet was probably healthier, as it was lower fat and included lots of veggies).  Then I found the lowfat raw vegan diet and it all made sense to me!  But there aren't many resources devoted to it, and as far as I know this is the first time raw vegan recipes have been introduced in DVD form.

Frederic is very accessible, makes lots of great suggestions throughout, and leaves room for variation in his recipe presentations.  For example, in his section on salad dressings, he offers a grid of ingredients that you can mix and match to make a dressing you'll really enjoy based on your own tastes and preferences.  Amounts for ingredients are also open for variation.  In a nutshell, the recipes are more like ideas, and Frederic offers great suggestions for you to play with them.  I think this is great and minimizes the likelihood that you'll get bored with the raw vegan diet.

I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in a raw vegan diet, and in fact, to anyone who is interested in adding more fruits and veggies to their diet.  Be sure to get PART 2 - his lowfat raw vegan recipes, which include ""overt fat"" - i.e., avocado, nuts, seeds, etc.",1248134400,9,1429,4.486486486486487

Thank you. I now have a much better understanding of the low-fat diet and how to prepare some tasty meals.

Thank you Fred,

3895365,5,B002BUDY7I,"Of all the plethora of books, magazines, articles, web information, etc. that I have collected over the last couple of years, Frederic Patenaude's recently released DVD/Part 1 is by FAR the best information I've received so far.  Simple, to the point and easy to follow, this DVD is a pleasure to watch and helps you easily incorporate the raw food diet as your normal lifestyle.  Many thanks--I can't wait for the next ones to come out!!",1248134400,8,438,4.75
3895366,5,B002BUDY7I,Fred's DVD help to remove the mystery about a truely low fat vegan diet and how easy it really can be. Any one who wants to be really healthy can easily learn how from Fred. I look forward to more of his video products.,1248134400,2,219,4.0
3895367,5,B002BUDY7I,This DVD contains a wealth of information for any interested in becoming healthy and getting away from the SAD diet.  Frederick delivers information regarding recipes that are fat free and delisious.,1248134400,2,199,5.419354838709677

8361943,5,B002BUDY7I,"Very useful recipes, great tips from how to process fruit and vegetables, to why they are good for you, I loved all the unusual recipes and tables that helped me to mix and make the right combination of fruits and vegetables that go together taking stomach acids into consideration.",1418083200,,282,4.775510204081633
8361944,2,B002BUDY7I,"boring.  I was really looking foward to the raw fat free aspects of this,  but had a hard time staying awake through this.  I will say I like his ideas about dehydrating some flavorful veggies ( red cabbage and celery )  grinding in a food mill and using as a spice.  That is really the only takeaway .  I also purchased part 2, so will see how it goes, and review it separately.",1416009600,,379,4.123287671232877

As the author of this video series, my goal was to present , I've often asked my readers what they think is missing in the raw food movement in terms of educational material.

The number one response I got back from them has always been the same: ""We want DVDs showing us how to make low-fat raw recipes"".

So in May 2009, I finally released the Low Fat Raw Vegan Cuisine series.

Here are some important highlights that make this series completely unique:

*  With over 3 hours of information, the two DVDs in the series literally show every single kind of essential raw food meal you can present

*  The first DVD in the series features ONLY recipes where no overt fats are used. This includes: fat-free dressings, soups, salads, and more!

*  The second half includes recipes with a moderate amount of fat, such as dressings, soups, salads, and desserts

*  Throughout the DVD, charts and slides highlight the main points and give additional information.

Watch the video preview to get an idea of what's included and the level of production of this DVD!",1255392000,9,1424,6.065
8361947,1,B002BUDY7I,"I have been following Frederic Patenaude for 3 years now.  When I heard that he had a video out I was thrilled.  I can't stress enough how disappointed I was with these videos.  The recipes are for those who have absolutely no knowlege of mixing ingredients.  Now, I know that there are people like this but that's not the only problem.  Frederic Patenaude should never speak in front of a camera again, until he takes some acting lessons.  It looks like he set up a camera in his house and just spoke into it.  No expression or excitement.  Just charts and putting a banana with water into a blender and calling it a perfect smoothie.  If I could return the video I would, but I had to watch it to see just how I wasted my money!  I am so disappointed.  I will NEVER buy a video from Patenaude again.",1253836800,14,801,4.273333333333333
8361948,5,B002BUDY7I,"Frederic Patenaude's ""Low Fat Raw Vegan Cuisine"" DVDs are great!!  I've just started out on the raw food diet Journey and it's been very challenging and confusing, but Frederics DVDs spell things out in a step-by-step manner that makes then easy to implement. He explains the principles behind the meals and has comparison charts.  The DVDs cover meal planning and how to create your own menus, as well as having a balanced diet.  I highly recommend these DVDs, they're great!!  Thank you Frederic!!  TJ",1252195200,3,503,4.940476190476191
8361949,4,B002BUDY7I,"I've been gradually increasing my raw food intake over the past 12 months and needed to find inspiration to take this lifestyle up a notch.  It's difficult to think of combinations that go well together when you've lived your whole life on cooked food!  So I devoured the info, and have been so inspired to be more adventurous since I bought this DVD - I've watched it about 6 times so far and feel drawn to different recipes each time.  I'm really enjoying the tastes of new-to-me fruits and also veggie combinations in soups and salads. The charts of variation possibilities are tips that I will refer to again and again.",1250121600,9,623,4.594594594594595
8361950,5,B002BUDY7I,"I advise anyone who wants to make changes in their diet by incorporating more fruits and vegetables to buy these dvd's.  They are simple, easy to get ingredients and little amount of time to prepare delicious meals.  I advise to buy both of the dvd's part 1 and part 2, they are worth the money.",1248393600,5,295,4.345454545454546
8361951,3,B002BUDY7I,"I am new to raw foods, and found this video on the internet. I purchased it in the hopes that I would learn how to create my own dishes (I'm a novice cook). I was impressed with the quality of the DVD and found the information to be very helpful. The only con I found was that the viewer couldn't replicate the recipes exactly from watching the DVD. The recipes are available for download through a bonus material link given on the DVD's insert. It was nice, however, that the recipes were available to those who purchased the DVD. I would recommend it for someone who is absolutely new to raw foods.",1248220800,8,600,4.366071428571429
