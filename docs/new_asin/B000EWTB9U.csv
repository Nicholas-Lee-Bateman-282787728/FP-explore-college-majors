8115221,4,B000EWTB9U,This is a lovely and funny italian film. The english dubbing is awful! I watched it in english then in Italian and having understood the story was much happier to watch it in its original language-of which i speak not a word! Wonderful atmosphere though!,1377302400,,254,4.666666666666667
8115222,5,B000EWTB9U,"This is a great cute movie, well worth watching,the actions and acting in the movie made the story a joy to watch.",1330819200,,114,4.2272727272727275
8115223,4,B000EWTB9U,"Fabulous movie...unfortunately, it was dubbed into english with an actress that sounded NOTHING like Gina Lollabrigida. I would not have bought it if I had known that it was dubbed. Otherwise, perfect!",1266019200,,201,5.3125
8115224,1,B000EWTB9U,"The lack of English subtitles in the Mya/Ryko release of this major 1953 Italian film is shameful -- especially at a list price of $24.95. Mya is an Italian-based company producing DVDs of European films -- mostly but not entirely horror/action/sexploitation films -- for the US market. If they think American viewers are content to put up with cheesy dubbing by nonactors who sound nothing like the original performers, they are sadly mistaken, and deserve to be boycotted.",1244592000,11,474,5.089743589743589
8115225,3,B000EWTB9U,"I rented this DVD because I had seen this movie listed in a book that included it in their top 1000 movies of all-time.  I really don't think it belongs in that category but I wasn't able to give it a real proper evaluation because I only had the option of listening to it in English or Italian.  The Italian version didn't offer subtitles so I was stuck with dudded English dialogue.  That meant listening to ""actors"" whose talents were more along the lines of timing their monotone English dialogue to fit the movement of the actual actor's lips.  That's too bad because I had a sense that there was a lot of emotional Italian being spoken.  In all fairness, there was SOME animation to the dubbing voices but it couldn't have been the same as the real deal.

The story line was simple and got simpler as it went on.  The characters were rather predictable yet likeable.  Nothing too grandiose takes places here.  It's more of a glimpse of life in a remote Italian village.  However, in order to appreciate the local color, you'd do better to find a version that had Italian language with English subtitles (assuming, of course, that you don't speak Italian).  It might just elevate this film from a 3 star to a 4 star rating.",1239321600,13,1228,4.51131221719457
8115226,5,B000EWTB9U,"BREAD, LOVE AND DREAMS is a gem, a film to be treasured and seen - as its sequel, BREAD, LOVE AND JEALOUSY - when one feels nostalgic.

It evokes a bygone era, village-life in the poverty-stricken mountains of central Italy in the immediate post-war period.  Its simple storyline, its colorful cast of characters and the naive quality of the situations in which they are involved tend to bring about laughter and tears, sometimes alternately, sometimes simultaneously.

The actors are all first-rate, beginning with the great Vittorio DeSica, followed by Mario Carotenuto, Tina Pica and Roberto Risso.  This is the film, along with FAN FAN LA TULIPE, that made Gina Lollobrigida a major star.  She is perfect as the young bersagliera. A truly unforgettable performance.",1233619200,,769,5.169354838709677
8115227,5,B000EWTB9U,"This lovable and amusing romantic comedy still stands out as one of the most reminded in its genre. A young and very alluring girl (as beautiful as humble) conquers the heart of a mature officer, thanks to her kindness and wishes to be kept in mind. But she really is in love with the shiest guy of the Police.

A smart and brilliant comedy that it has become a reference film. Gina Lollobrigida is fresh and fabulous in this delightful movie.

Don't miss it!",1213920000,4,459,4.4523809523809526
