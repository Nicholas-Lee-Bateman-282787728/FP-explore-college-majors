1778275,4,B00006IUFZ,"I enjoyed Van Damme's ""Derailed.""  The production values and the dark way the frames are shot makes it come across as a ""B"" flick, but it keeps our attention as we roll through this action.  I enjoyed Susan Gibney who plays Madeleine, Van Damme's wife.  She's appeared in a number of ""Star Trek"" TV episodes, ""Waterdance"" with Helen Hunt, and an independent film from last year called ""Besotted.""  She plays a doctor and wife. She thinks that Claude is cheating on her when she shows up on the train with the the kids to surprise him for his birthday and finds him with Galina Konstatin, played by the beautiful Laura Harring.  I enjoyed how her doctor impulses come to the fore as she ministers to the passengers exposed to the deadly SP-43 strain of smallpox. Van Damme as Jacques Kristoff does his usual number of stunts, climbing through vents, wrestling on the top of a moving train, and driving a mototrcycle off the train & back again!  Jean Claude's real-life son also plays his cinematic son here as Kristopher (Van Damme) Van Varenberg gets a couple sweet kicks into the bad guys himself.  The film concludes with the lessons that no matter how high up one is, they must be accountable as Jacques' NATO boss Lars gets hauled off to jail.  This may not be the quintessential Van Damme film; however, it serves to keep our attention and moves nicely with director Bob Misiorowski's pacing.  Enjoy!",1044403200,3,1405,4.678861788617886
1778276,3,B00006IUFZ,"Jean-Claude Van Damme's latest film, ""Derailed,"" is a treat for his fans, but beyond that it serves little purpose. Van Damme plays Kristoff, a secret agent or something who has to escort this woman to Munich via train. But things go bad when the train is hijacked and we learn that the woman has a deadly virus in her possession. Add to this Kristoff's family is on board and we have ourselves some classic dumb-action mayhem! Unfortunately for Van Damme fans, he does not do his jumping crescent kick, but he gets the roundhouse in a couple of times. His son, Kristopher Van Varenburg, also does a little bit of high kicking. Could there be a future action star in the works? Who knows!",1040688000,2,688,4.556451612903226
1778277,5,B00006IUFZ,"Its been a long time since Van Damme has produced a decent film worthy of watching. For a long time he lulled us to sleep on some really cheasy films. This one though very similar to Under Seige 2 with Seagal, was actually decent. The plot really is simple but here's the funniest part the martial art scenes aside from the stunts were actually mostly realistic. He actually employed a lot No Holds Barred combat in the scenes and I realize most people are too ignorante to tell what is real and what isnt.
Coolest scene: Van Damme ties the villans Tie onto the train as it delrails.",1040256000,2,583,4.407407407407407
1778278,2,B00006IUFZ,"Jean Claude Van Damme made his reputation in the late 80's and early 90's with martial arts movies that involved his entering a kumite, winner take all.  In BLOODSPORT and KICKBOXER, his athleticism, good looks, and never-say-die persona were magnified in confrontations with a killer bad guy, usually played by Bolo or Michel Quissi.  The fights in those films were seen as intriguing choreographed versions of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.  As long as JCVD stuck to that type of film, he stood out and the movie did good box office.  Eventually, he felt that he could branch out into being an action star along the lines of Steven Seagal or Jackie Chan.  The brutal truth about his acting talent is that it is limited to the savage ring fighting of his early career.  With DERAILED, JCVD proves once again that his acting, when combined with laughable special effects, cheesy writing, and illogically paced fight sequences, cannot compensate for these other deficiencies.  In DERAILED, he plays Jacques Kristoff, a CIA type who is hired to bring in a sexy Russian female who has ripped off her Mafia boss to the tune of a deadly smallpox serum, which is released into the air of the train on which all are riding.  The plot holes are big enough for that train to drive right through without hitting a bump.  His wife and children surprise him by meeting him on the train, only to be taken hostage along with the other passengers.  If this sounds a little like DIE HARD meets SIEGE, then you have already figured out the ending.  The bad guys are tough enough, but JCVD's fights with them are claustrophobic, thus negating the allure of his high kicks. Instead, he has to resort to the grappling devices like chokes and ankle locks that I found to be the most interesting part.  DERAILED is a glitzy movie with lots of pretty girls, tough guys, and short combat scenes, but the feeling that I had at the conclusion is that if JCVD wants to avoid the continual embarrassment of straight to video flicks like this one, he would do well to remember the kind of movie that made him a superstar in the first place.",1036800000,6,2116,4.658602150537634
1778279,2,B00006IUFZ,"I used to be a big Van Damme fan. Timecop, Hard Target and Lionheart are still among my favorite action movies. However, recent Van Damme's movies are rather weak. It is my personal opinion that without a interesting original script and quality professional actors portraying the ""bad guys"" Van Damme's movies aren't' worth the time nor money.
Brief comments about this movie - very lame story, much weaker than Segal's Under Siege 2 Dark Territory. Some sickening pictures portraying Small Pox outbreak. Supporting cast, excluding Tomas Arana, Laura Harring, range from weak to complete amateurs. Also, special effects are very weak.
On the positive, if you love Van Damme, you will see him doing his usual stuff in the movie. Also, his son makes a theatrical debut with some nice martial art moves.
Overall, I would rather watch again one of my favorite Van Damme movies than this one.",1035504000,4,887,4.959731543624161

1778281,5,B00006IUFZ,"""Derailed"" is another straight-to-video movie of Jean-Claude Van Damme. The lord played Jacques Kristoff and he had to transport a mysterious woman by train. A group of hijackers wanted something from her and it could have caused world domination. Once they got a hold of the woman, they dropped some of the virus and it started to infect all of the hostages, including Kristoff's family! Big mistake! Kristoff then punished the hijackers with high kicks and new Jujitsu moves. Talent. You need to see the fake helicopter and the really bad computer effects. But, this is Van Damme's version of ""Under Siege 2: Dark Territory"" and it is still good. Once a god, always a god.",1034467200,4,674,4.818965517241379

Derailed is no different, except that his ""family"" is part of it in Derailed, whereas in most if there is a family they are in the background.

1778333,2,B00006IUFZ,"I've seen most Van Damme movies, and even when they are bad they're still oh so awesome.  However, this is the only one that I thought was just down right bad.  Here we go:

Pros:
1. Has Van Damme in it.  Usually, that's enough to carry a movie, but this proves to be the exception the rule.
2. Features Van Damme punching a guy in the crotch.  His recent films have been showing less of that, so it's good to see his signature move back in action.
3. Film takes place in Europe...I guess that's kind of neat.
4. They avoid deluging you with over the top CGI effects, but...

Cons:
1. ...quite possibly the worst miniature effects I have ever seen.  It seriously looked like they were using an off-the-shelf train track set for their effects.
2. They never explain who Van Damme is.  Is he like a secret agent or hitman or something?  Who is he working for?  His character is just shown as some kind of specialist in doing dangerous things for some other guy (who is never really explained either).
3. Tired plot (it's basically ""Die Hard"" meets ""Dark Territory"" meets ""Contagion"" [yeah, why not, I'll throw ""Contagion"" in there]).  Sure, ""Sudden Death"" was a bit of a ""Die Hard"" knockoff, but it at least it had memorable things like Van Damme murdering a villain in a penguin custom.  Nothing all that interesting happens here.
4. The opening fight/escape scene is the most bizarre I have ever witnessed on film.  Basically, it's Van Damme and some woman fighting like they were in the cirque du soleil--that's the only way to describe it.  Actually, I stand corrected from my previous point, this was a memorable scene in the movie...just not in a good way.

In summary, even the most hard core fan should avoid this.  I would only recommend seeing this out of morbid curiosity.",1342569600,,1781,4.553459119496855
1778334,2,B00006IUFZ,"In this direct to video action adventure, lovely Laura Harring (Mulholland Drive, Sunset Beach) is Galina Konstantin, a performer/thief who uses her unusual skills to steal deadly vials of smallpox virus.  Jean-Claude Van Damme is Jack Kristoff, a special agent assigned to lead her to safety, as the pair make their escape via Train 681 from Bratislava to Munich.  A crisis arises, when thieves seeking the bioweapon take over the train.  Things get worse, as Kristoff's family is aboard when one of the vials breaks and exposes the train's passengers to the disease, and people start to get sick.

Van Damme's performance is perhaps slighter better than his usual standards.  Older, but still physically fit, he perhaps shows a skosh more depth as an actor.  His various fights combine flash with some gritty street fighting moves.  Susan Gibney plays his wife.  The supporting cast is serviceable, with the villains, lead by Mason Cole (Tomas Arana) having a typical comic book demeanor.  Van Damme's real life son, Kristopher Van Varenberg, appears as his character's son.

Directed by Bob Misiorowski, the story could use some polishing, as nearly every movie clich involving action on a train, short of Sinatra getting shot in the back is employed.  Though extremely poorly executed, Van Damme even rides a motorcycle across the roofs of moving train cars.

The special effects, definitely suffer from budgetary limitations.  Lots of crappy looking CGI, and some of the shots of model trains and a helicopter look terrible.  Frequent cuts and choppy editing are often used in action sequences, to speed things along, and give the illusion that the action is continuous.  In general, the film often suffers from poor editing.

There is an unreal time shift, probably attributable to special effects, as it is technically easier to do a crash at night, rather than the day.  While Train 681 is traveling at night, it is struck by another train.  The crash results in damage to both trains, and several cars fly off the track.  After the crash, Train 681 is able to continue on its way, however instead of still being dark, the sun is now up.  Even in the darkness, the stunt still looks terrible.

Derailed has a serious tone, but just does not have the budget to carry it off very well, and ends up looking pretty ridiculous in places.  With all its shortcomings, the film rates two and a half stars tops, and is mainly recommended to Jean Claude diehards, or those who really enjoy an adventure on a train.",1270425600,,2512,4.888888888888889
1778335,2,B00006IUFZ,"I don't know what impelled JC Van Damme to make this movie because its such a low standard performance from virtually everyone involved.
While I haven't see all of his movies, I've seen most of them and that's why this is such a disappointment.  I mean, movies like Time Cop, Universal Soldier, Sudden Death or Hard Targets, were all great and absolutely watchable action flicks but Derailed has nothing even remotely watchable in comparison.

I think we can all agree that a good movie consists of the following elements: a good preferably exciting story, good to excellent acting, and if necessary great action and special effects scenes.  Yet, Derail has not a single one of those necessary elements in it!
First of all, there is the story, or rather what is being called a story. It is so riddled with down right rediculous plot holes that it makes you wonder how a straight thinking person could come up with something this unbelievable.  Then there's the acting, or shall we say earnest attempts at acting.  Honestly, I've never seen JC Van Damme so uninspired in terms of acting, but unfortunately the rest of the crew seemed to feel right at home with this lame performance and join the protagonist in what can only be called substandard acting.  Then finally, there are the so-called special effects, which are simply laughable.  I mean, who are they trying to kid with these cheapo effects.  The train on which most of the movie takes place is for example a toy train when viewed from above and the helicopters are also cheap models.  Really, this should be way below Van Damme's dignity to pass off such cheap scenes for action that is supposed to rescue a sinking ship.

If you want to see a good to great action movie that is taking place on a train go for Steven Segal's Undersiege 2, there he shows what a great train action movie has to look like.

So drop this from you shopping list, if you ever had it on it.  There are so many better films by Van Damme, virtually all of them beat this one by light years.  This must be his worst movie, ever.",1264896000,,2062,4.555555555555555
1778336,1,B00006IUFZ,"Since beginning his tenure in direct-to-video cinema, Jean-Claude Van Damme has been remarkably aware of how important it was for his movies to keep from blending in with the crowd of countless other DTV flicks. This willingness to try for originality gave rise to several better-than-average low-budgeteers like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Replicant/dp/B00005N5QW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Replicant</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Hell/dp/B0000DBJ2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Hell</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JCVD/dp/B001PWY4NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JCVD</a>, and it has generally given Van Damme fans more reason to celebrate than those of Steven Seagal or Dolph Lundgren. ""Derailed"", however, has the dubious honor of fulfilling our hero's quota of having at least one universally uninteresting, poorly-made film. The premise of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>&nbsp;on a train"" has been done before and done better, so if you're in it for the theme, go watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-Siege-2-Dark-Territory/dp/6304712898/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under Siege 2: Dark Territory</a>. If you're just watching it for the leading man, you're going to have to be a lot more tolerant than me to enjoy what feels like Van Damme's first mail-in movie.

The story: NATO operative Jacques Kristoff (Van Damme) is sent abroad to escort a secret agent (Laura Harring,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mulholland-Drive/dp/B00005JKJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mulholland Drive</a>) across Europe via train to deliver a top-secret biological weapon. When the train is hijacked by a group of terrorists (led by Tomas Arana,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator/dp/B00009ZYBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator</a>) and the virus is released, Kristoff must race to take out the bad guys in time to save the passengers and stop a deadly railway collision.

Let me start off by saying that there is no actual train in the movie - only models, like the kind your grandfather may have collected. The behind-the-scenes featurette gives the impression that a lot of effort went into constructing these, but on screen, they represent the entire production by looking cheap. So does the pardon-the-budget CGI. So does the majority of the supporting cast - a collection of accented internationals whose casting qualification was being able to look menacing or frightened. The highlight of this collection is Van Damme's real-life son Kristopher getting to throw a few karate kicks of his own. He outdoes his old man by doing this, for the fight scenes are collectively poor. Even though Stefanos Miltsakakis was an excellent opponent for Van Damme in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maximum-Risk/dp/076780970X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maximum Risk</a>, the fight director seems to favor grappling over kickboxing, so their encounter and most of the other fights are just a bunch of rolling around.

Director Bob Misiorowski's resume includes mainly bad TV films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shark-Attack/dp/1573627488/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shark Attack</a>, and the production of ""Derailed"" looks the same. You can tell from the first set of titles that this movie has been made with limited inspiration, so prepare yourself for some weirdo editing techniques and convenient reality snafus for the sake of story progression (e.g. a henchwoman remains oblivious while Van Damme is beating up her buddy right behind her back). Potentially cool things like Van Damme riding a motorbike atop the moving train are ruined by how inefficiently the editing department worked the shots together, and, in the end, it's difficult to care for the poorly-conceived characters. Were it not for the wonder of IMDb, I wouldn't even remember their names.

Following ""Derailed,"" JCVD went back to making much better films. Fans ought to count their blessings that they've only got this one to contend with when it comes to blatantly bad vehicles for their hero, and put it completely out of their minds. Newcomers, stay away. Stay far away. Pretend you don't even know this one exists.",1259452800,,4555,6.8347676419965575

I have always been a huge fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme; in fact I own every one of his films. So the other day I said to my self I should watch one of his films I hadn't seen in a while, ""Derailed"" was the one I went with. It was a wise choice because this is a very entreating movie, much better then I remembered. I still don't know which I think is better, this film with Van Damme or ""Under Siege 2"" with Steven Seagal which was also on a train.

The story is about Jacques Kristoff who is hired to escort a woman named Galina Konstantin onto a train and get her across the border. Of course it wasn't that easy since she is carrying a bio weapon on board and some terrorists are after it. Of course in true Van Damme fashion he fights them all on board a speeding train. And to make things worse his family is on board and the virus breaks loose on all the passengers.

Writer's Adam Gierasch, Jace Anderson, and writer producer Boaz Davidson have created a pretty good movie with plenty of action. Under the direction of Bob Misiorowski this film is actually a really good film, even my grandmother liked it. Also along side Boaz Davidson there is seven other producers including Avi Lerner, that is a lot of people producing one film. Of course what sets this apart from other similar films is Van Damme and his style of action, which is excellent and exciting. And of course Van Damme's performance is great as is the rest of the cast. Laura Harring does a good job as Galina who has the virus, and Tomas Arana as Mason Cole is excellent as the lead villain in this film. The rest of the cast is just as good, all the bad guys Van Damme's family [including real life son], and train passengers are amazing in their supporting roles.

This is a very good movie for a boring day at home when you just want to relax. This isn't the best Van Damme film ever but it isn't the worst either. I recommend this film to any body reading this.",1216771200,,1950,4.247978436657682

I found this to be a very bad movie with very low production values. There was nothing in this movie for me other than annoyance. Very poor direction, cheap and laughable special effects, particularly the exterior train sequences where the train looks like it is made of wood, illuminated with a light bulb from the inside and pulled along by a piece of string. Bad lighting, badly filmed, executed and edited martial arts and action sequences. Laughable acting performances from all including Van Damme. Very bad audio post production special effects to such an extent that at times you can't hear character dialogue. I got the impression that a lot of this was filmed in very low lighting conditions to hide the cheap sets and obvious poor special effects. Basically the movie is a cheap rip off version from a mix of Under Siege 2 with Steven Seagal and The Cassandra Crossing with the late Richard Harris.

This was a good Van Damme movie and that its a copy of under siege is a lie (ive seen under siege its not) this movie was good not just for a Van Damme film but a fan of a good action movie period.

The movie starts off showing a thief, she breaks into a government facility and steals from there. Then later on we see Van Damme at a resturant talking to a man about a mission hes gonna do, hes to meet up with a Thief and the man shows van damme the picture. Van Damme agrees to this but his wife is mad because he never gets to spend time with his kids but he says hell be back.

Later on in the movie Van Damme finds out that he was set up from the beggning, theres a bilogical weapon on the train and if it gets out it could destroy all of mankind (or those born after like 1980 it said or something).

All in all this is a about a man whos trying to stop a deadly virus, knowone else can but we know that VAN DAMME CAN!!",1105660800,,1016,3.7783018867924527
1778352,1,B00006IUFZ,"The movie to me was very horrible,first of all the sound effects in this movie were very cheap. The movie wasn't one of his best. The other thing is that the whole thing of him having a family and being married was stupid.",1083456000,,222,4.186046511627907

1778354,3,B00006IUFZ,"Van Damme is back and his movies are getting worse . . . sure he has made some great ones like SUDDEN DEATH and KICKBOXER, but this one, from the people that brought you CROCODILE and SHARK ATTACK(and its sequels!) is so bad it's hilarious. Van Damme plays a government agent(AGAIN?!) who has to escort a prisoner across Europe by train, but in the process terrorists steal and unleash a bioweapon on board which she is transporting. And to add to the complications, Van Damme has his family, or the usual oh-the-humanity interest on board. The authorities, fearing a Europe-wide plague from the dealy smallpox bioweapon, attempt to destroy the train. Sound familiar? A rip-off of the far superior CASSANDRA CROSSING with hints of the equally superior UNDER SIEGE 2 thrown in. However, the enjoyment comes from the incredibly bad special effects that you will see. Check out the toy helicopter chasing a train set through papier-mache mountains! Exploding cars on the autoracks that blow up as soon as a bullet hits them, lack of route knowledege through Austria by the producers(all main lines in Austria have overhead wires and do not operate Bulgarian diesel locos), two toy train wrecks set alight by a kid with a match or so it looks and horrendously bad acting and dialogue that makes bad movies like BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and SHARK ATTACK 3 look brilliant. So at least it's funny. Recomended if you love dreck and want something to compliment that bad movie cheese-fest you are putting on!",1076198400,4,1504,4.87890625

Im a huge fan of Van Damne,im just gonna say,this movie was pretty good,but not wanna Van Damnes best. Van Damne is not been a movie in a while but when he comes back i hope its like the one in his old days. When i saw Derailed on USA,the beginning,like the first 20min of it was some boring,but it got better and better with the fighting and explosions. Even though this movie was good,but this one will be the one that Van Damne will be lest know for. I cant wait till he comes back, and when he does,i hope the movie is filled with his high flying kicks.",1071273600,2,637,3.984375
1778356,1,B00006IUFZ,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie, my friend told me he saw a new Van Damme flick in the video store titled 'Derailed'. I am a Van Damme Fan, but after getting this film on DVD it hit me like a book it was horrible! It was pathetic....it SUCKED! I own Under Seige 2 and I liked it, there is NO COMPARISON. What hurt the most is how happy I was when I got the DVD, and how much I was looking foward to seeing it before and after I got it.
Derailed is the worst Van Damme movie AND the worst MOVIE I have ever seen and yes I am also a Van Damme fan.
Jean really stuffed up BIG TIME with this flick.
On another note, Van Damme's son starred in this movie aswell, he is a good lookin' kid, has his fathers good looks and skills.
Jean should be ashamed of himself! Putting his son in a terrible first flick like this.
0 star film:-
EXTREMELY OVER-RATED BY THE LOOK OF THE DVD/VIDEO COVER.
DONT BE FOOLED.
In conclusion, don't even pick up or look at the packet if you see it in a store.",1069891200,4,990,3.955
1778357,2,B00006IUFZ,"Van Damme's most recent effort has a plot similar to UNDER SIEGE 2 and BROKEN ARROW which is scripted by B action film maker Boaz Davidson, the man responsible for such hilariously awful garbage as AMERICAN CYBORG.
Van Damme plays Agent Jacques Kristoff, who is assigned to escort gorgeous thief Golina Kostantin (Laura Elena Harring from JOHN Q) from Slovakia to Eastern Europe by train. Coincidentally, on board the train is a deadly biological weapon. After the train's first stop terrorists; led by the sadistic Mason Cole (Thomas Arana from GLADIATOR) board with the goal of finding and stealing the vial containing the deadly virus. What they plan to use it for is anyone's guess.
Now for coincidence #2: Among the train's passengers are Kristoff's wife and son. Things really start getting heavy when the virus is let loose throughout the train thanks to the bunglings of one of the terrorists. The leader lets him off lightly though: the culprit is promptly shot through the head, as all nasty terrorists types are won't to do. But as we all know by now, you don't mess with Jean-Claude. Especially when his family is involved. Butt-kicking time.
The movie starts starts OK, but soon derails itself. The addition of unconvincing minature setpieces and an overall air of stupidity make DERAILED about as explosive as a Bay City Rollers reunion. This movie looks and feels no different to any of the other direct to video actioners with stars like Michael Dudikoff and Jeff Speakman. DERAILED is a pretty anemic effort, but not Jean-Claude's worst: NO RETREAT NO SURRENDER and CYBORG are both tied for that dubious honor, but if like myself you're a Van Damme completist you'll want to watch it anyway. Don't say you weren't forewarned.
Extras include a behind the scenes featurette, trailers and subtitles in English and Hindi.",1056585600,3,1834,4.957792207792208

Van Damme's most recent thrillers that have skipped the box office and straight to video {The Order,Replicant}haven't been to bad and I can't believe The Order didn't make theaters. But his newest action flick Derailed is a disgrace to action movies and Van Damme himself,I can't believe Van Damme took the script after all the classics he's made. The storyline has been done before and the special effects look like it came from an old Godzilla movie. Terrible! The whole movie is garbage,I'm sorry Van Damme but this film is horriffic.",1053993600,,715,4.821138211382114
1778359,1,B00006IUFZ,"Okay, okay, I admit it. To all the world (well, Amazon.com users) I am a BIG Van Damme fan. Yeah, I have been taking the heat on this for a number of years now, but I can't help loving the guy. From the guitar-twanging thrills of HARD TARGET to the vicious (and balletic) brawling of KICKBOXER and BLOODSPORT, 'Van Dammage' has constantly entertained and kept my faith in bad action cinema alive. Even though he seems to be appearing in Direct-to-video movies now, he still has the knack for picking interesting riffs on the action genre. Check out his collaborations with two of Hong Kongs' finest: Tsui Hark (the underrated DOUBLE TEAM and KNOCK OFF) and Ringo Lam (MAXIMUM RISK and the killer comeback movie REPLICANT). These movies have shown his ability to choose difficult and 'Non-Hollywood' product, opting to make something far more different than formulaic.
Having said all of that in support of my hero, here comes DERAILED. A near train wreck of a movie (Cliched I know, but I'm sure I stole that line from a friend of mine.), it ambles along like a dodgy episode of an old TV show, with awful production values and terrible visual effects. The dull story is a lazy retread of DIE HARD and UNDER SIEGE 2. A virus has been leaked out on a train by some dastardly terrorists, and only Van Damme can stop them before the world(?) is taken down by smallpox. And, er, thats it. Okay, there may be a little more going on, but from the bad acting, uneven direction and lack of genuine suspense, all you want to do is stop the movie, eject the disc and watch LIONHEART again. Maybe, just maybe, this total waste of time will be just a figment of my imagination.
This movie is that bad. Don't be fooled by the obvious 10+ year old shot of Van Dammage on the cover, or the stills of him riding the motorbike across the top of the speeding train. None of these things will change the fact that this film is like watching paint dry on a very cold day. Coming after his other mistep THE ORDER, this ranks as the lowest dip in his career. Which is a shame, as 2000 saw his excellent comeback flick REPLICANT show that he could still flex his action muscles, as well as delivering a solid performance wrapped up in a decent story. As I have stated previously, this one hurts. To pinpoint what is the worst thing about it, would be a worthless exercise as the movies' problems are legion. Bob Misiorowski's direction is pedestrian and uninvolving (I couldn't believe my eyes when he informs us of the state-of-the-art effects sequences that have been used in the depiction of the speeding locomotive. Try toy trains, bub), and the pacing lacks drive or energy that is needed to make this kind of adrenaline-pumped film work. Summing up, I hate to admit it, but stay away. Movie like this are dime a dozen and seem to turn up on cable TV with alarming regularity. Van Dammage should have steered clear as well, saving his fans from wasting $ and giving his detractors another reason to naysay him. I can only hope that he keeps to his word (on the doumentary accompanying the flick), that he is going back to the movies that made him a star in the first place. The BLOODPSORTS', the KICKBOXERS' and hey, even CYBORG. Now, that would be something to look forward to.",1052006400,3,3260,4.517766497461929
1778360,1,B00006IUFZ,"Unlike other reviewers, I went to see this film to watch the actress Laura Elena Harring, the brunette beauty in David Lynch's cult film ""Mulholand Drive.""  Like Naomi Watte, she had to endure the long period of thankless roles -- films like ... er ...""Lambada"" or ... ""Little Nicky""(!).  And now Academy-Award nominee Naomi Watts hit the paydirt with ""The Ring.""  So what about her in ""Derailed""?
Bad news.  She is terribly wasted.  She appears as a female thief internationally chased by the police.  And the secret agent Jack sent by NATO Jean-Claude Van Damme arrests her in Slovakia and send her to Germany on night train.  Don't ask me why night train.  I just forgot why they didn't use airplane, but never mind.  And for some reasons I still cannot comprehend, Jack's entire family members show up before embarrassed Jack on the platform, including his daughter (Jessica Bowman, ""Joy Ride"") and his son, who is Jean-Claude's real-life son under his real family name.  Huuuum.
And the actions mainly happen on this train, where some deadly virus is spread.  Before you can say ""Under Siege 2"" or ""Cassandra Cross,"" the film rushes into a series of very cheesy, trashy action sequences, which are painful to see.  The settings are too incredible (bikes on the train roof?), the special effects are little better than B monster flicks made in the 50s, and acting and dialogues are simply awful.  As to the last part I could have forgiven and forgotten, if only the film gives decent action scenes or some original ideas.  No such luck here.
And about Laura Elena Harring, all I can say is this.  She is as beautiful as ever, even among the mediocre dialogues and the poorly shot screen, and I really feel sorry for her.  This film is another proof that good directors like Lynch can induce the actors to give their best while ... the rest of it, no need to say.
Like another action star Steven, Jean-Claude Van Damme skyrocketed to stardom in the 1990s, and I was then a faithful fan of both of them.  OK, they cannot act, I admit, but they are always entertaining, and got some kind of brio, only those guys can show.  I loved them for being what they were, and still do.  But now, I think somebody should stop them, especially Van Damme, who still has a good chance of comeback, judging from his works (such as ""Replicant"") done with Hong Kong film masters.  And fans, do not say this is HIS film.  He has made much, much better films like ""Timecop,"" and we should remember that.",1050278400,3,2486,4.617312072892939

The story finds a government female operative stealing a small package containing  highly contagious viles of small pox. She gets into trouble and Van Damme is called to extract her successfully from the country she is in. He gets there and he just barely manages to get her out....by train. However there are other baddies also looking for the vials,and at the train's first stop they all climb aboard. To make the situation more awkward Van Damme's wife and two children surprise him,as she walks in on he and his ""client"".It is his birthday after all. The wife is now miffed, and with her nose firmly out of joint she and her children retire to another part of the train.
The baddies soon get their act in order and finally take over the train,looking for Van Damme's charge. With a lot of folks killed or being threatened she finally gives up. While being interrogated one of the vials are accidentally broken and soon a good portion of the train comes down with smallpox.
Van Damme never rests and is constantly on the move trying to either regain control of the train and/or fight/kill the bad guys. Slowly but surely the odds come around in Van Damme's favour and eventually he is able to regain control of the remaining vials  and manages to save the lives of the trains remaining passengers before it  falls into a wide chasm(a bridge was blown by NATO in order to stop it from reaching a large city).In quarantine Van Damme questions his boss,whom he believes set him up to also cash in on the deadly vials. He is arrested by NATO officials. Van Damme and his family walk happily into the sunset...so to speak.
The plot and film are both fast moving. It is a solid one,I believe. Van Damme has some nice little emotional/acting moments throughout,usually with his family. The fact that the film is set on a train also heightens the tension. The biggest thing to set this film back though is its lack of good production values. Specifically, the poor use of CGI and miniatures really bring it down. It is all too apparent when you are watching it. Van Dammes motorcycling moments and weapons firing,and the trains hitting of another one and its eventual precarious perch on the edge of a blown bridge,for instance. The green screen moments were,at times, amateurish beyond belief. I suppose the Bulgarian""budget"" was blown on JCVD,with little left over for the more crucial S/FX.Too bad.
Technically speaking this DVD contains BOTH w/s and f/s versions of the film. The film is grainy in the f/s but alright in the w/s. There is an approximately  15 minute featurette on the films making.
If you are looking for a decent Van Damme film,this would be a good one to watch. It could have been better though if the budget had been bigger, along with the production values. But alas this short coming brings the film down quite a bit,as much as every thesp did a good job in their respective roles. Btw,this was Kris,Van Damme's son's,second film,and he apprises himself quite well. 3 1/2 stars.",1419638400,,3266,4.765017667844523
