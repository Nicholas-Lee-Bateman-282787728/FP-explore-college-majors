8439725,5,B004SHW4W8,"Nice stage setting/backdrop, good perfromances, and good view of the performances. There are some cut-aways & close-ups, but it doesn't detract from the performances.

I really liked the whole DVD pretty much. It was nicely put together. Just a few of the performances I really enjoyed...

Amanda Rose -nice interpetation of the song & fun to watch
Willow -very slow & exotic
Sedona -loved her dancing, she is a pleasure to watch & her costume was lovely.
Bellydance Soulfire -just awesome, loved the choreography, costumes, high energy!
Aziza - ethereal in white 'Cher"" looking costume with veil
Sheri Cherchez -Tribal Fusion
Ansuya & Karim Nagi -do a nice 'Live"" drum solo together
Karim Nagi -does a fun & creative drum solo on his own, I loved it. I sometimes get bored with those, but not him-lots of fun & he moves around!

All performers included on the DVD:  Sedona- Guzel Gileeva- Aubre- Dilek - Karim Nagi- Maria - Lumina Dance Co.- Bellydance SoulFire - Amanda Rose -Sherri Cherchez LaFemme - Willow -Ansuya

I assume this is the companion to the ""Soul of Bellydance"" DVD, (which is good also). It looks like the same stage and looks like it was taped at the same time.",1312329600,2,1180,4.764705882352941
