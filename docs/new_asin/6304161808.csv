800340,5,6304161808,"Shopping was a cult hit throughout Britain several decades ago and should be treated as such. While I love this film, it is not for everyone. The action and plot line are not what you would expect, should you be looking for some English version of Gone in 60 Seconds. However, those of you who appreciate artsy British independent cinema (as well as some scenes with young Sean Bean, Jason Isaacs, and Sean Pertwee...worth drooling over) will really enjoy this film.",1098921600,7,466,4.765432098765432
800341,1,6304161808,"For a flick which is chock-full of car crashes, cop-fleeing, and massive explosions, damn, this is surprisingly boring.  Jude Law is fine with what he's given to work with, but most of the other actors--Sean Pertwee, Sean Bean, and an achingly young, gangly Jason Isaacs--are completely wasted in this silly movie.",1088121600,4,314,5.1568627450980395
800342,4,6304161808,"Here's the plot- some cool criminals in a not too distant future industrial London steal cars, only to drive them into posh shopping malls to loot what they can before hearing police sirens, basically for the rush- wicked.  This debut from PAUL ANDERSON (EVENT HORIZON) is a nifty little film that manages to exite in it's short running time.  Gritty and well acted by some up and comming English talent (SEAN PERTWEE is excellent as usual as a tough scumbag), this flick has some slick production for an indie.  A movie that looks good, moves with purpose, and draws the viewer into a world of grime and crime is always worth it.",1067040000,10,630,4.607142857142857
800343,5,6304161808,"What can i say this movie is not for most people. It is in a class of its own. It takes guts to make a movie like this. Death,destruction, car chases, cheesey british rock. It almost reminds me of vanishing point meats darkcity its a classic in my book.",997142400,,253,4.183673469387755
800344,1,6304161808,"I remember seeing this film at a preview screening at the time I was a paid film critic, mainly because it was one of those (thankfully) rare occasions where I wanted to walk out, but couldn't (though that didn't stop others from leaving). It was one of the worst experiences I had, with only the Michael Keaton/Geena Davis Speechless beating it as intolerable. (For Speechless I stretched my legs in the foyer before venturing back, so at least I could still hear the dialogue). It can now be considered with hindsight since it features Jude Law in an early role, but who could tell from this he would go anywhere. ""Shopping"" is the term used to describe driving a car through a store's front window, which is what the characters in this film aspire to, in their car-fetish underworld. Director Paul Anderson attempts to create a futureworld as a parable for the rampant nihilism of British gangland youth but his film fails to connect with an audience on any level. It's so negligible that it's almost a parody eg the police apear for elaborate car chases when no-one has called them. The only remarkable thing about it is the odd visual - the opening aerial view of smoky industrialism, heads looking up in a roofless lift, a stop-motion video camera, and sad Dalmation statues. The actors are so under-directed that they just stare at each other. Wax beauty Law is like Tom Hanks with collagen lips, standing in the middle of oncoming traffic to get attention. His girlfriend is straddled with a ridiculous Irish accent and plays a car GameBoy, and their friend Tommy scowls like Caligula. Law keeps a manniquin and rebukes his girlfriend with ""It's not safe to have sex in the 90's. She then goes to Tommy who runs a switchblade over her face. It's not safe to be a woman in the 90's.",992995200,5,1789,4.646687697160884
800345,1,6304161808,"This is one of the few movies I've seen over the past 20 years that I have wanted to walk out of after ten minutes.  The story, setting and characters all suck. A creaky script is dragged further through the mud by  the clumsy attempts of Jude 'quite posh really"" Law to portray a  joyriding adolescent, and all action is pedestrian, predictable and  clich&eacute;-ridden in its presentation.  The phenomenon of teenage boys TWOC and  driving Volvo estates through shop windows is potentially a great cinema  story, but it's not one that is told here.  This is a piece of tat which  was an embarrassment to British film-making at the time and, next to a  genuine criminal caper like ""Lock, Stock..."" looks like one of  the Children's Film Foundation's poorer efforts.  Really, don't waste your  time on it.  I wish I hadn't.",940291200,3,824,4.75177304964539
800346,5,6304161808,"Riveting drama with first class direction by Anderson and excellent performances by leads Sadie Frost and Jude Law (who incidentally are now married in real life).  Wonderful noir-ish photography in the industrial  wastelands of London masks the fact that the car chases are not really  as  high octane as they seem (the Police drive Ford Sierras for goodness sake).  Dated now, particularly by its thumping soundtrack but still a film which  proves beyond doubt that high budgets are not necessary for good movies.  Don't miss the opening sequence, Pertwee and Bean's sinister villains and  the violent ending.  A film that will have you thinking about right and  wrong and offers some real insight into youths who sincerely believe that  theft is property.  Not for the squeamish.",937699200,6,782,5.119047619047619
800347,5,6304161808,"There are few things in life that would be better than driving around in the fastest and best engineered automobiles Europe has to offer.  Among those better things are not caring about the damages to these automobiles  and getting all kinds of free stuff in the process.  Since I'd rather not  spend the rest of my life in a cage or in a ceader box, this is the closest  I'm gonna get.  Phenominal.",929836800,,399,4.397260273972603

7863821,4,6304161808,"This film understands something that 99% of Hollywood films dont. Its the journey not the destination that matters. Most films are like inanimate objects these days, skeletal building frames carefully joined together to get to the pre-determined and cliched ending. Boring. Most Hollywood movies make me want to shoot myself in the head they're so trite.
 If you breathe life into the characters, setting, and film itself you don't need a destination, you don't need black and white. Everything speaks for itself.
 Thats why theres so much hostility towards this film, it doesnt fit in a box.
 The hero is an immoral thief, yet his humanity shines through and you cant help but like him. This film is reminscent of Menace II Society in the way you excuse the criminals to some degree for their crimes.
 I deduct a point because the film is a bit glossy and the characters sexed up a bit for the screen.
 Great film for those who don't need to be spoonfed.",1185753600,,955,4.6946107784431135
7863822,3,6304161808,"This film about big city boredom could have been written about any young people in any industrialized nation in the world.  Jude Law plays an angst ridden young man, recently out of jail, dogged by bad decisions, an embarrassment to his family, who chooses the thrill of stealing cars and crashing them into shopping malls to ""shop"" as a way to add a missing something to his life.  He's at odds with a gang of vicious thugs that are bent on his destruction.  The film is well done for the most part, but it feels like there's something missing - some critical piece just around the corner, hovering just out of sight - that will make it all come together.  Jude Law does well, but even then it's only good, not great.",1166227200,,718,4.416666666666667
7863823,3,6304161808,This is actually the edited version of Shopping. I taped an uncut version off of a network here in Canada called Show Case that runs unknown smaller films like this. I also own this DVD and thats how I know this DVD is edited. My taped movies run time is about 1 hour and 42 minutes (102 min). This DVD is only 89 minutes. The uncut version is a bit better as a couple of key scenes were left out of this DVD.,1134432000,2,409,3.9397590361445785
7863824,5,6304161808,"This was an amazing piece of cinema. Soundtrack, acting, and cinematography was wonderful. It is a bit dated now, but otherwise well done. It never tries to justify what these people do and how they live, but merely make us understand why they do it, and maybe have some sympathy as well. They treat life like ride and they have to face the consequences: it shows we eventually have to take responsibility for our actions, no matter how fast we run (or drive) away from them.

Sean Pertwee's performance as a drug-addicted, crime tycoon was especially good. He had a constant flow of energy just under the surface, making him seem unpredictable and dangerous, which he is.",1130112000,5,672,4.743589743589744
7863825,1,6304161808,"What a waste of time. I feel like the producers owe me 90 minutes of my life which I'll never get back.

You read the back cover about guys ""shopping"" that is, crashing cars into stores and stealing. Sounds interesting, right?

IT NEVER HAPPENS IN THE MOVIE.

There is one scene where the main characters crash into a huge department store and one takes a teapot, the other a tshirt.

WOW! THAT'S PRETTY EXCITING.

Cult hit? Cult crap.

Don't buy this, don't even rent it.

It's horribly edited, obviously pieces are missing from the story.

Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings) is listed as one of the actors. He has about a 2 minute role.

Save your money and your time. The ad copy only serves to trick people into buying.",1119484800,9,718,4.419847328244275
