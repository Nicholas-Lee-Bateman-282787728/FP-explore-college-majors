8669943,4,B00M31VE22,"THE RECKONING is a pretty good little crime thriller.

Filmed in Australia, it stars Jonathan Lapaglia and Viva Bianca as police detectives investigating the roadside execution-style murder of a fellow cop.  At the same time, they are looking into the disappearance of a cancer-stricken teenager (Hanna Mangan Lawrence), whose image appears on a mysterious video found on the dead mans body.

Written and directed by John V. Soto, THE RECKONING has a couple of surprising plot twists, as well as an interesting backward/forward storytelling structure.  The cast, which includes Luke Hemsworth and Alex Williams is first-rate.  Fans of this genre will not be disappointed.

Extras on the DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment include a Making of featurette, cast interviews and more.",1412640000,,778,5.3884297520661155
8669944,3,B00M31VE22,"After the way the film started with Hemsworth's quick death and Lapaglia being the usual burnt out drunk cop, I was a bit put off.  As I hung in there the film started to intrigue me and keep me interested.  I would call this a 3 1/2 stars almost a 4.  I ended up liking the film, but I am not sure it would appeal to everyone.  It follows a cop, who drinks all the time, and his partner as he investigates the death of his fellow cop and friend Hemsworth.  He is also looking into a missing girl who is dying of cancer and finds the two cases are connected.  Add also a string of bodies and the girl's boyfriend being a young man who he arrested for burning his father alive.  A nicely tied together mystery worth viewing.",1412035200,2,723,4.121428571428571
8669945,4,B00M31VE22,"I was lucky enough to attend a preview screening of this film earlier this year and I was very impressed. It's a quality thriller with a complex story, but what stands out most are the good performances from Jonathan LaPaglia and Hannah Mangan Lawrence. Plenty of twists and turns along the way so its a bit of a roller coaster. Highly recommended!",1408147200,,348,4.629032258064516
8669946,3,B00M31VE22,"If you read the Amazon editorial review you get the whole movie, including the ""twist"" you had already figured out. If you watch the film for Luke Hemsworth, he gets killed in the second scene and only appears in flashbacks. When Detective Jason (Hemsworth) is shot and killed, Detective Robbie Green (Jonathan LaPaglia) and his partner Jane (Viva Bianca) are on the trail.

The film implies that Robbie and Jane were once an item to the dismay of his family. Robbie also likes his drink which he sips on all day while working. We know who the killers are in the film and why they are doing it. In fact they documented their deeds and made sure the cops got a thumb drive. Rachel (Hanna Mangan Lawrence) who has terminal cancer along with her mentally ill boyfriend AJ (Alex Williams) are on a killing spree, getting everyone who was involved in Rachel's sister hit and run death.

This is not the best vigilante film out there, nor is it exciting crime drama...yet at the same time it isn't bad. You knew where the film was headed and I was hoping they would come up with a different ending...something with a clever twist from some useless piece of information I missed...but they didn't.

The film uses Bible quotes in the killings, but not Samuel L. Jackson quality. In spite of what the film claims, Romans is in the New Testament, not Old. An okay rental if you're bored.

Parental Guide: Occasional F-bomb. Sex. No nudity.",1407542400,2,1429,4.6141732283464565
