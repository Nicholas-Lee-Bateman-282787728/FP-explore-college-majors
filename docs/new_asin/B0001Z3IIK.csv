8187506,4,B0001Z3IIK,Really cute and colorfull and pretty funny. Starts out a bit slow but it does pick up. All the characters are (and Nanas) pretty loveable. My favorite is the violet Nanapon (i think that's what she's called) if you watch this you'll see why. The animation for this show is very lovely. And the songs are pretty cute.,1147824000,2,316,4.4655172413793105
