3106810,5,B0013FW05O,"For starters, I spent two years living in Brasil, and a good part of that time was spent living in favelas. This movie, even more so than City of God, shows exactly what life is like in the favela.

If you have seen City of God and liked it then you will certainly like this.  The beginning, while slow, is necessary to set the stage for the story, and the story is amazing. The story of City of God was epic, heart-breaking, and shocking, and is, in my opinion, one of the top five gang films ever made, and probably the most underrated gang film of all time. But it did have one flaw, City of God, at its core, was mostly a soulless film. It's purpose was mostly to showcase the goings on of gang life in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, and more specifically, how terribly bloody and horrifying they can be.  This film, which was equally amazing albeit in a very different way, focused more on how the actions of the gangs can affect those who live within their territory. It showed how the bad choices of some, tear apart lives far from them and end hurting people in ways that they could not have foreseen.  The film is also about forgiveness and the realization that, at a certain point, you have to be the one to end the chain of violence, even if you feel justified in your actions, or it will take everything you have left from you.  Violence begets violence, and he who lives by the sword, will die by it, and that is definitely the message of this film.  In a way, that was largely the lesson of the last film as well, but again, the last film told the story from the point of view of the gangsters, this one tells it from the point of view of the ""moradores"", the people who have to try to live their lives in peace while destruction rains down around them.  There is plenty of action, but there is also plenty of heart.

Also:
The synopsis says: ""Paulo Morelli's film is a pacy, bloody thriller that pays warm tribute to a diverse cross-section of American directors including Quentin Tarantino and Michael Bay.""  That is a very offensive statement. First of all, this movie pays no tribute to ANY american films and borrows absolutely nothing from any american film (I am american by the way). This movie follows in the same genre and style as its predecessor City of God, and in the same genre and style as Tropa de Elite. It merely drops the narrative style that both of those movies use, instead favoring a first person view through two characters perspectives.  Michael Bay's filmmaking is based on the theory of filmmaking developed by Steven Spielberg. The base idea of that theory is that you boil down a story to being black and white, good guys vs bad guys, without any realism in it, then you put in as many flashy effects as possible, then you add an emotional storyline, one that has you cheering for the white knight, hoping he saves the day and gets the girl. This movie is NOTHING like that, this movie is gritty and complicated, and there is no clear bad guy. This story is very real and leaves in the necessary complexity that life adds to difficult situations.  Furthermore, this movie managed to have incredible cinematography that in my opinion is BETTER than what Michael Bay could do without CGI despite being filmed on a budget that probably resembles what Michael Bay spends on food alone during the filming of a movie. That statement is also offensive because though Tarantino has made one or two amazing films, most of what he makes really fails to live up to the hype, and furthermore, Tarantino's style of filmmaking is to make a violent fairytale that has no connection to reality, and highlight the cartoony aspects of it. In essence, he tries to give every film he makes the ""Sin City"" effect, only to a lesser degree.  Once again, this film does not play up anything, nor does it play anything down. It merely tells the story of people closely related to gangsters in the favela. Having lived in the favela and met people like everyone in this movie, I can say that this story is so realistic that there was really nothing in it that I found at all implausible. (some people might say that one scene where the boss orders a guy killed because he robbed in their territory is unrealistic, but they would be wrong. That is very realistic, if you rob in a gangs territory they will kill you, because they don't want the cops in their neighborhood. As long as only gangsters are dying, and no one is getting robbed, the cops usually let them sell all the drugs they want. But as soon as someone gets robbed, the cops start coming around.) In fact, it was so realistic that one scene where the cops come to the favela starts with little kids lighting firecrackers on a rooftop. In the favela, unless its after a soccer game, or its a holiday, the only reason that fireworks go off is to announce to all the gangsters that the cops have entered the hood, and gangs actually employ little kids to sit and watch for the cops with fireworks. Its so realistic in fact that I could easily see this story actually happening in the favela.  This film and its predecessor City of God should go down as some of the best gang films of all time. Especially because, unlike most american made gang films, this film is realistic as hell.  Of course, it helps that the favelas in Rio de Janeiro are so intensely violent that you really don't HAVE to make anything up to have a good story.",1342051200,3,5412,4.442540322580645
3106811,5,B0013FW05O,"There's quite a bit going on in this last movie in the 3-part trilogy.  The scenery is stunning.  But the story is good as well. The guy who plays Wallace's father looks remarkably like him. Part of the ironic genius of this show is the extremely stunning scenery in which all the violence of the story takes place.  If you've started with City of God, continued with the TV series ""City of Men"" then you'll surely be catching this last part of the trilogy also called City of Men (the movie, not the series).  See the top-notch TV series before this.  This last movie as with all the previous installments does not disappoint.  Both the picture and sound quality on this DVD are excellent as well.",1318550400,,698,4.5

3106813,1,B0013FW05O,"I had already seen this movie by the time I ordered it and wanted it for my collection. But what I didn't notice is that the product description for the version I ordered says that the dialogue is dubbed. I consider the vast majority of dubbed movies to be tacky, and have little use for them unless the original audio track is also on the disk. So I haven't opened this disk to watch it, because I might need to return it. The actual back of the dvd case says that it has English, French, and Spanish subtitles, but who really knows? I gave it one star to grab the attention of whomever else might be checking out the product. I'm actually hoping that the product description is erroneous.",1314144000,2,690,4.3565891472868215
3106814,4,B0013FW05O,When I first found out this was being made I almost pissed my pants lol.  As I said in a previous review I did City of God (this movie's spiritual prequel) is one of my favorite movies of all time.  So when I found out it would be getting a successor I was beyond ecstatic.  This movie however is not City of God quality by any means.  Don't get me wrong it's a good movie but not what I was truly expecting.  I guess if I had did some research those expectations could have been spared some.  This movie is actually the conclusion of a tv show (u know how HBO did Sex in The City) the show has excellent reviews but I couldn't really get into it because it focuses on the lives of two friends and is kinda gritty but not gritty as City of God or most crime dramas are.  Mainly because they are different genres City of God is like Scarface or Goodfellas as were City of Men is like Wonder Years set in a Brazilian Favela (think the hoodest ghetto you can think of and square it).  City of Men does aim to gain more of that City of God grit towards the latter part of the film but I think that may have just been thrown in to appease people (studios) who were fans of City of God.,1301702400,,1180,4.012820512820513
3106815,4,B0013FW05O,"This is a very nice film which talks about groups of men from different place trying to take over the control of ano9ther pleace by means of weapons firing etc to gain control over territory. There are a lot of shooting done in the later portion of the film which cause some to die during the firing attack. This piece of film is done in The Cathay, PictureHouse which this piece of film is showing now.

3106819,4,B0013FW05O,"It is a movie of an art to survive, of Rio de Janeiro/Brazil, where kids become parents much faster than graduating from primary schools, where drugs and guns are not for playing but real stuff to survive and grow up.

Action movie is of life as it is in local favelas looks like a sci-fi story for outsiders from other parts of a different world.",1251676800,2,347,4.338461538461538
3106840,4,B0013FW05O,"""City of Men"" is a feature film version of a blockbuster series that ran on Brazilian TV from 2002 to 2005. It is also a sequel of sorts to the earlier ""City of God,"" an award-winning movie directed by Fernando Meirelles.

Paul Morelli's ""City of Men"" focuses on Laranjinha (Darlan Cunha) and Acerola (Douglas Silva), two honorable teens who are struggling to make a decent life for themselves in the slums of Rio de Janeiro.  The former is searching for the father he's never known, while the latter is only beginning to learn what it means to be a father to his own son.  Their personal story is set against the backdrop of a violent turf-war between two rival gangs that are battling it out for preeminence in the city.

""City of Men"" reveals its origins as a TV series in the novelistic approach it takes to storytelling and character development.  From the beginning, we feel as if we have been thrust into the midst of a story ""already in progress.""  With little explanatory background, the screenplay (by Elena Soarez) introduces us all at once to a multiplicity of characters, whose relationships with one another we are forced to pick up almost on the fly as it were.  This allows us to become both an observer of and an active participant in the drama that unfolds.

Certainly, one of the most important characters in the movie is the city itself, since it is this very environment of poverty, hopelessness and violence that, in large measure, determines the kinds of lives these people will lead and the types of futures they will have.

Morelli's directorial style is up-close-and-personal in the more intimate moments, and vivid and exciting in the pulse-pounding ""action"" sequences.  The sense of immediacy that he and cinematographer Adriano Goldman bring to the work acts as an effective counterweight to some of the more melodramatic elements that creep into the screenplay towards the end.

With excellent performances and a surprising amount of optimism given its generally depressing milieu and setting, ""City of Men"" is a tale of friendship and adult responsibility that will move the spirit and touch the heart.",1247356800,,2133,4.880886426592798
3106841,4,B0013FW05O,This movie was prett good. Not as good as the original but still worth watching.,1244592000,,80,4.4
3106842,4,B0013FW05O,"The Bottom Line:

An interesting companion piece to City of God (though it's not in the same league cinematically) and a good film in its own right, City of Men tells the story of two friends growing up in modern-day Rio De Janeiro on the periphery of the gangs; if you love City of God you owe it to yourself to watch this, but neophytes will probably enjoy it too.",1241568000,,366,4.228571428571429
3106843,4,B0013FW05O,"""It didn't look real""??? Have you been to a favela??? Have you even been to Rio de Janeiro or Brasil for that matter? Because by your comment it is very obvious that you haven't. This movie is relatively slower than City of God but this movie is portraying Rio currently instead of in the 70s (when City of God is set). The drug wars are still brutal but aren't year long ordeals. This movie is exceptional at showing modern day Rio and I very highly recommend it. Make sure to watch the TV show first!",1237939200,5,502,4.294736842105263
3106844,5,B0013FW05O,"I watched City of Men once before I had seen the 19-episode TV series of the same name (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-of-Men/dp/B000GNOGWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City of Men</a>) and after I had watched the TV series.  The movie is literally one hundred times more powerful and exciting if you have watched the show and understand the characters.  If you have not watched the City of Men TV show, my recommendation is to buy that before you watch this movie and if you have watched the show, this is an amazing follow up to the series that wraps things up very nicely and is for all intents and purposes an excellent final 'episode'.

Don't buy this expecting a sequel to City of God because they are not in the same league as far as production value and entertainment are concerned.  The pacing is much slower and there is certainly less action, but this movie assumes that you already know what happened in the sereies.  There are a healthy dose of flashbacks that take place throughout, but these are more to remind the viewer of moments that took place throughout the show than they are to catch new viewers up to speed.  In closing, I highly recommend City of Men the movie, but only after you have seen the TV show, otherwise it will still be an entertaining film, but it was made to be coupled with the series.",1232668800,16,1366,4.8412017167381975

In a way, that was largely the lesson of the last film as well, but again, the last film told the story from the point of view of the gangsters, this one tells it from the point of view of the ""moradores"", the people who have to try to live their lives in peace while destruction rains down around them.  There is plenty of action, but there is also plenty of heart.

Also:
The synopsis says: ""Paulo Morelli's film is a pacy, bloody thriller that pays warm tribute to a diverse cross-section of American directors including Quentin Tarantino and Michael Bay.""  That is a very offensive statement. First of all, this movie pays no tribute to ANY american films and borrows absolutely nothing from any american film (I am american by the way). This movie follows in the same genre and style as its predecessor City of God, and in the same genre and style as Tropa de Elite. It merely drops the narrative style that both of those movies use, instead favoring a first person view through two characters perspectives.  Michael Bay's filmmaking is based on the theory of filmmaking developed by Steven Spielberg. The base idea of that theory is that you boil down a story to being black and white, good guys vs bad guys, without any realism in it, then you put in as many flashy effects as possible, then you add an emotional storyline, one that has you cheering for the white knight, hoping he saves the day and gets the girl. This movie is NOTHING like that, this movie is gritty and complicated, and there is no clear bad guy. This story is very real and leaves in the necessary complexity that life adds to difficult situations.  Furthermore, this movie managed to have incredible cinematography that in my opinion is BETTER than what Michael Bay could do without CGI despite being filmed on a budget that probably resembles what Michael Bay spends on food alone during the filming of a movie. That statement is also offensive because though Tarantino has made one or two amazing films, most of what he makes really fails to live up to the hype, and furthermore, Tarantino's style of filmmaking is to make a violent fairytale that has no connection to reality, and highlight the cartoony aspects of it. In essence, he tries to give every film he makes the ""Sin City"" effect, only to a lesser degree.  Once again, this film does not play up anything, nor does it play anything down. It merely tells the story of people closely related to gangsters in the favela. Having lived in the favela and met people like everyone in this movie, I can say that this story is so realistic that there was really nothing in it that I found at all implausible. (some people might say that one scene where the boss orders a guy killed because he robbed in their territory is unrealistic, but they would be wrong. That is very realistic, if you rob in a gangs territory they will kill you, because they don't want the cops in their neighborhood. As long as only gangsters are dying, and no one is getting robbed, the cops usually let them sell all the drugs they want. But as soon as someone gets robbed, the cops start coming around.) In fact, it was so realistic that one scene where the cops come to the favela starts with little kids lighting firecrackers on a rooftop. In the favela, unless its after a soccer game, or its a holiday, the only reason that fireworks go off is to announce to all the gangsters that the cops have entered the hood, and gangs actually employ little kids to sit and watch for the cops with fireworks. Its so realistic in fact that I could easily see this story actually happening in the favela.  This film and its predecessor City of God should go down as some of the best gang films of all time. Especially because, unlike most american made gang films, this film is realistic as hell.  Of course, it helps that the favelas in Rio de Janeiro are so intensely violent that you really don't HAVE to make anything up to have a good story.",1342051200,3,5412,4.442540322580645

The guy who plays Wallace's father looks remarkably like him. Part of the ironic genius of this show is the extremely stunning scenery in which all the violence of the story takes place.  If you've started with City of God, continued with the TV series ""City of Men"" then you'll surely be catching this last part of the trilogy also called City of Men (the movie, not the series).  See the top-notch TV series before this.  This last movie as with all the previous installments does not disappoint.

But what I didn't notice is that the product description for the version I ordered says that the dialogue is dubbed. I consider the vast majority of dubbed movies to be tacky, and have little use for them unless the original audio track is also on the disk. So I haven't opened this disk to watch it, because I might need to return it. The actual back of the dvd case says that it has English, French, and Spanish subtitles, but who really knows? I gave it one star to grab the attention of whomever else might be checking out the product. I'm actually hoping that the product description is erroneous.",1314144000,2,690,4.3565891472868215
3341311,4,B0013FW05O,When I first found out this was being made I almost pissed my pants lol.  As I said in a previous review I did City of God (this movie's spiritual prequel) is one of my favorite movies of all time.  So when I found out it would be getting a successor I was beyond ecstatic.  This movie however is not City of God quality by any means.  Don't get me wrong it's a good movie but not what I was truly expecting.  I guess if I had did some research those expectations could have been spared some.  This movie is actually the conclusion of a tv show (u know how HBO did Sex in The City) the show has excellent reviews but I couldn't really get into it because it focuses on the lives of two friends and is kinda gritty but not gritty as City of God or most crime dramas are.  Mainly because they are different genres City of God is like Scarface or Goodfellas as were City of Men is like Wonder Years set in a Brazilian Favela (think the hoodest ghetto you can think of and square it).  City of Men does aim to gain more of that City of God grit towards the latter part of the film but I think that may have just been thrown in to appease people (studios) who were fans of City of God.,1301702400,,1180,4.012820512820513

3341337,4,B0013FW05O,"""City of Men"" is a feature film version of a blockbuster series that ran on Brazilian TV from 2002 to 2005. It is also a sequel of sorts to the earlier ""City of God,"" an award-winning movie directed by Fernando Meirelles.

Paul Morelli's ""City of Men"" focuses on Laranjinha (Darlan Cunha) and Acerola (Douglas Silva), two honorable teens who are struggling to make a decent life for themselves in the slums of Rio de Janeiro.  The former is searching for the father he's never known, while the latter is only beginning to learn what it means to be a father to his own son.  Their personal story is set against the backdrop of a violent turf-war between two rival gangs that are battling it out for preeminence in the city.

""City of Men"" reveals its origins as a TV series in the novelistic approach it takes to storytelling and character development.  From the beginning, we feel as if we have been thrust into the midst of a story ""already in progress.""  With little explanatory background, the screenplay (by Elena Soarez) introduces us all at once to a multiplicity of characters, whose relationships with one another we are forced to pick up almost on the fly as it were.  This allows us to become both an observer of and an active participant in the drama that unfolds.

Certainly, one of the most important characters in the movie is the city itself, since it is this very environment of poverty, hopelessness and violence that, in large measure, determines the kinds of lives these people will lead and the types of futures they will have.

Morelli's directorial style is up-close-and-personal in the more intimate moments, and vivid and exciting in the pulse-pounding ""action"" sequences.  The sense of immediacy that he and cinematographer Adriano Goldman bring to the work acts as an effective counterweight to some of the more melodramatic elements that creep into the screenplay towards the end.

With excellent performances and a surprising amount of optimism given its generally depressing milieu and setting, ""City of Men"" is a tale of friendship and adult responsibility that will move the spirit and touch the heart.",1247356800,,2133,4.880886426592798

An interesting companion piece to City of God (though it's not in the same league cinematically) and a good film in its own right, City of Men tells the story of two friends growing up in modern-day Rio De Janeiro on the periphery of the gangs; if you love City of God you owe it to yourself to watch this, but neophytes will probably enjoy it too.",1241568000,,366,4.228571428571429

Because by your comment it is very obvious that you haven't. This movie is relatively slower than City of God but this movie is portraying Rio currently instead of in the 70s (when City of God is set). The drug wars are still brutal but aren't year long ordeals. This movie is exceptional at showing modern day Rio and I very highly recommend it.

The movie is literally one hundred times more powerful and exciting if you have watched the show and understand the characters.  If you have not watched the City of Men TV show, my recommendation is to buy that before you watch this movie and if you have watched the show, this is an amazing follow up to the series that wraps things up very nicely and is for all intents and purposes an excellent final 'episode'.

Don't buy this expecting a sequel to City of God because they are not in the same league as far as production value and entertainment are concerned.  The pacing is much slower and there is certainly less action, but this movie assumes that you already know what happened in the sereies.  There are a healthy dose of flashbacks that take place throughout, but these are more to remind the viewer of moments that took place throughout the show than they are to catch new viewers up to speed.  In closing, I highly recommend City of Men the movie, but only after you have seen the TV show, otherwise it will still be an entertaining film, but it was made to be coupled with the series.",1232668800,16,1366,4.8412017167381975
