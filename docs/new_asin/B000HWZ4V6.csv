2645869,3,B000HWZ4V6,"I don't know if you've noticed but some of these Korean Dramas start out with so much promise and then just fizzle up and die at the end... this was one of them. The heartbreak part dragged on and on and honestly it didn't make enough sense for me and so I started to loathe the grandpa and got sick of everyone. I think when you invest over 16 hours into a movie viewing, you should be satisfied with the end most of all. I wasn't.",1287792000,3,432,4.034883720930233
2645870,5,B000HWZ4V6,"I have to say, the casting in the 4 major roles was perfect, especially ""My Girl"" Lee Da Hae.  She can make you laugh, cry, and everything in between during the course of the storyline.  Which brings me to my second point, the storyline is one of the few where I felt was perfectly paced, and the twists and turns made sense and at the right time.  Most of the recent dramas I've been watching have been super slow in some parts and then have a rushed ending, but My Girl does a great job not getting bogged down in a stupid side story.  The music is quite good, if you search the internet, I'm sure you can find a copy of the OST available for download.",1253750400,5,654,4.125984251968504
2645871,5,B000HWZ4V6,"Must watch! Great acting, refreshingly unpredictable script, witty lines, lots of laugh out loud moments, as well as many heart-moving scenes. I've watched a lot of Korean dramas but ""My Girl"" is still my favorite. Plus, it introduced me to actor Lee Jun Ki, a versatile likable actor. Check him out in ""Iljimae"".",1218153600,6,313,4.9245283018867925
2645872,3,B000HWZ4V6,I have to admit this was a great show.  But is it worth $115?  The photo of the box is a trick.  It's not that thick.  You get a thinner slip case with 2 DVD boxes in it.  Look at the customer photos for a true view of the package.,1213315200,3,231,3.54
2645873,5,B000HWZ4V6,"Excellent cast. Wonderful acting. Lee Da Hae pulled off the comedic scenes nicely, and everyone else within the drama also did a very good job. From the get-go I was immersed into the story of what is ""My Girl"". The plotline is your typical drama, with quarreling, jealously, lovers left and right and whatnot, but this is a must see if you are a fan of any of the actors. Being rated as one of the top ten dramas in Korea in 2006, I can see why this has made it up there. Check it out and I am assured you shall be pleased. Read plently of summaries, reviews, get a feel for this drama and you'll fall in love with it.",1181606400,9,619,4.081967213114754
2645874,4,B000HWZ4V6,"I really liked this Drama;however, when I put in my 8th Disc, It messed up. The episode would automatically play, and the ""English"" subtitles were in Korean or Chinese. Other than that, everything was great! It came really fast.

This series is really great. I recommend it for anyone.",1166659200,13,285,4.816326530612245
2645875,5,B000HWZ4V6,"This was the first KDrama that I finished, and I have to admit that the first episode didn't draw me in but I persisted and I am so glad that I did. I LOVE this KDrama.. even more than Full House.  It's a cute drama filled with laughter and poignant moments. The characters are all great in their roles. The best part is that nobody dies in this drama.  I always hate when the main character dies from some illness...",1164585600,20,417,4.2
8141938,5,B000HWZ4V6,"My favourite Korean drama ever, and I've watched all the big ones with new shiny cinematography and top of the line smartphones, My Love from Another Star, Pinocchio, Dream High, Master's Sun, the Heirs, all of them and THIS, is the one I love the most. I have chosen. Well rounded cute lighthearted drama with a couple who are respectful towards each other, the male isn't overly aggressive and abuse isn't passed off as love like in so many dramas, and despite those facts they have undeniable chemistry, the leads. I drop korean dramas, or lose interest if the plot drags on or bores me, but this drama made use of its sixteen episodes to deliver a good pace.",1462060800,,662,4.571428571428571
8141939,5,B000HWZ4V6,"This was one of the first dramas I watch that made me fall in love with the Korean wave, this two were a good pair, they were dating at the time of this drama, so you can see and feel the chemistry between them, love it.",1426809600,,220,3.8043478260869565
8141940,3,B000HWZ4V6,"I purchased this when first discovering Kdramas and Romantic Comedies, so was more easily impressed than I am now, after viewing probably a hundred.  The best thing about this one was Lee Dong Wook, whose career I have followed since.  I can recommend it to viewers who want a fun comedy with satisfactory performances by the actors.",1396742400,,333,4.824561403508772
8141941,5,B000HWZ4V6,Who doesn't like Lee Da-Hae? I love her acting and she's so funny and cute. I would recommend this korean drama. It's worth watching.,1373673600,,133,4.583333333333333
8141942,4,B000HWZ4V6,"Entertaining but toward the end the story becomes illogical and melodramatic  Also, why promote lying? There are also some ridiculous dream scenes that seem juvenile. Outside of that it's fairly entertaining.",1370736000,,208,5.709677419354839
8141943,5,B000HWZ4V6,"My Girl is my favorite k-drama, which was why I was sooo happy that it got the full treatment in this region 1 release!  After watching My Girl via various internet sources with under par video or subs, this was a welcome buy!

I found that My Girl has a nearly perfect episode count for the story they were trying to tell.  You see, I'm one of those viewers who will stop watching a k-drama if the plot falls off.  I was never tempted to do that with My Girl!  The humor was great, the characters were likable, and the story was well told.",1361145600,,540,4.153846153846154
8141944,3,B000HWZ4V6,"Looking back on the drama itself, it's okay--better than most I've seen. There are some cliches and stereotypes (such as the love square and rich male heir + malicious ex-girlfriend) but the story's execution gives the drama some charm from the humor. There are also some loopholes, things left undone, overused plot devices/situations, abrupt & unsatisfying ending, as well as the story becoming slow-moving and dry towards the end--all of which I've come to expect from any work of the Hong sisters. Character development could be better; the female protagonist is more intelligent, cunning, and independent than most of the female protagonists in other Korean romance-comedies I've seen--ONLY in terms of personality. Like someone else said, she is far sillier than the male characters and is made out to be weaker than them (physically and mentally) as well as the ""malicious ex-girlfriend"" in the aforementioned. The men are the overplayed characters themselves--one is the stoic, wealthy, hotel heir and the other is an unambitious playboy. Both have machismo behaviors and are possessive of the women in the drama; it's borderline creepy. I like that the side characters have a story line and aren't forgotten but the stereotypes don't bode well for the drama's characters.

As far as the actual product goes, it's near-shoddy as the title states. I wish there were special bonus content that have to do with the drama, like ""Outtakes"" and ""Making Of"", on the DVD itself. The subtitles also make for awkward reading because very few people actually talk the way the subtitles say on a daily basis, accurate or not. For example, in one of the scenes, a character tries to express to another character: ""You make me crazy."" Instead of saying that, the subtitles say, ""You have me in a frenzy."" It briefly breaks the flow of the kind of emotion the drama is trying to create at that moment. Other than that, the subtitles keep true to the story plot. As long as you don't mind the awkward reading and the stereotypes, the drama will be good for you. The price is also extremely steep for a near-shoddy product and NOT worth more than $40...just saying.",1328054400,,2156,4.9393939393939394
8141945,5,B000HWZ4V6,"This is one of my favorite Korean Drama past or present.  It was highly entertaining with great dialogue, the characters very well developed and the pace of the series was fast.  The two leads are probably the best TV couple I have come across, their chemistry was amazing.  I've watched many Kdramas, this one was very well balanced with lots of laughs and some tears.  I can't say enough about how great this drama is.  If you're looking for a very good series and pretty people to watch, then you will not be disappointed with this drama.  I absolutely love it!  Even the music was great.

I bought this box set from Amazon.  Even though the note under this item said out of stock, the item was shipped within two days of ordering yet item still has an ""out of stock"" note attached to it.  Prime Shipping only took two days.  Item arrived packaged well and very quickly.  Amazon.com needs to do a better job of updating the stock availability.  I almost didn't buy it based on item being not available until after Christmas based on Amazon's note.",1292544000,,1050,4.5212765957446805
8141946,3,B000HWZ4V6,"I would recommend this series if you are a fan of KDrama's.  The reason I am giving it 3 out of 5 is because it is like so many of the other KDrama's...  Korean series tend to make women look silly , weak and overeaters.. Also, Kdrama's tend to make it seem like a crime if a woman wants to have a career, maybe that's a cultural thing but I don't get it.  Also, A woman may start out strong but she ends up weak and dependent.. It's rare in a KDrama to see a woman be triumphant on her own and be strong from beginning to end.. Out of 20 Kdramas i have seen so far the closet i have ever seen to a strong woman througout was in the series ""Cinderella's Sister"" and "" Boys over Flowers, (Loved the latter)..  This series i'm afraid is very typical, nothing to original and the ending is what you would expect.. So if you like Kdrama's this is for you... I keep watching them because they are sooo addictive!!!",1291248000,5,909,4.089887640449438
8141947,5,B000HWZ4V6,This could be my favorite Korean drama of all time! Love the music SO much! Story is great and I never found it slow! Love the cast and characters! I love the humor! People keep saying its a copy of Anastacia...but besides someone pretending to be a missing relative there isn't much in common...Amusing drama! Watch and enjoy!,1290816000,,327,4.655172413793103
