8704029,4,B00U2MZU4M,"First, I'm a big Therion fanboy so take this review with that in mind. I was sad when Lori Lewis left Therion although she is still a permanent member. This is a fitting tribute for Christofer Johnsson's Villa Adulruna art project and Lori's exit.

It has six excellent live clips from Santiago Chile and Prague, Czech Republic along with several video clips for Les fleurs du mal and Making of and Behind the scenes clips. The interviews with Christofer and band members are quite nice. I just wish there were a few more live songs hence the 4 instead of 5 stars.

These are limited edition with only 1000 made which I think makes this special.",1475971200,,645,4.551724137931035

8704031,2,B00U2MZU4M,"This blu-ray is essentially a $20 companion disc to the newest Therion album, Les Fleurs du Mal. Almost everything on this 146-minute disc revolves around that album. You get five or six music videos for songs that were on LFdM; you get two seperate interviews with Christofer that are about 30 and 25 minutes long, respectively (unfortunately these are quite mind-numbing and uninteresting regarding the questions he answers and the general discussion he holds). You get six live song performances, three of which are official bootleg quality so don't expect anything stellar but it's not bad, either. The live stuff is about 25-30 minutes total. There are a few very short ""behind the scenes"" videos of the making of the music videos, and lastly there is a 32-minute short documentary chronicling Lori Lewis' final day touring with the band. All of this, as stated earlier, is about a solid two and a half hours of content.

This is absolutely for hardcore Therion fans, and to be even more specific, super hardcore fans of Les Fleurs du Mal. I absolutely love Therion, I think their musical composition/output is the equivalent of Karl Orff and Richard Wagner putting a metal band together - but this release was, for me personally, a waste of money. I don't care about the interviews, the live stuff was just OK, the music videos were not great (plus I can always watch them on YouTube if I wanted to anyway), and the only thing I didn't bother watching was Lori's last day because by that point I was so disappointed with this release.

Only 1000 copies of this were produced, indeed making it a collector's item - but I don't collect, I consume. If the product isn't worth me watching multiple times (unlike Therion's Live Gothic, one of the most phenomenal live concert DVDs I own), then I have no reason to hold onto it. This is either a watch-once-and-sell-it disc or it's a hold-onto-it-because-it's-Therion disc, depending on your personal choice.",1448755200,9,1958,4.859281437125748
