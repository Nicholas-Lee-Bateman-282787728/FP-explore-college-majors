747485,5,630397788X,"This film touched my heart! The innocence of childhood (or boyhood) and a rude awakening, a caring and beautiful mother, a fascinating, strong father, an adorable little sister,  two eccentric Uncles (who aren't short  on love for the kid) - all of these combine to create a great story.
A  lot of the reviewers here seem to have been let down by the fact that the  film did not do justice to the book or the understanding of  ""Jewishness"" or New York... But really, this movie is about  heart. And there's plenty of it in every scene.",943747200,5,535,4.463917525773196

Sadly, the filmmakers were too callow to take even minimal risks and follow  the book, which is exciting and volatile and genuinely affecting.

747600,5,630397788X,"I have not read the book, and so I did not come to this film with any particular expectations.  That noted, film and literature are two different media and ought to be considered within the context of what is possible with each.  A book may take 20, 30, or 50 hours to read - a film must tell a story in a much shorter period of time and with far fewer words.  Having read many of the comments here, I have little doubt the mother's character was simplified and/or sanitized for the cinema version - my guess is that all of the characters were amended in some fashion or another to, again, accommodate the medium.  As far as film-making goes, I consider Unstrung Heroes to be a success and rate it among my favorite films - I find it entertaining, emotionally compelling, and particularly poignant.  The musical score is also, in my estimation, outstanding and complementary.

Although it is occasionally mocking, it is otherwise an accurate depiction of dealing with mental illness, especially paranoid fixations and the condition known as ""hoarding."" Competently directed by McDowell and beautifully scored, the ending is happy but not too happy. It's occasionally dull and lags at times, but what comes across is its title and opening line--that sometimes people are heroes but they become unstrung.

747655,4,630397788X,"This story stayed with me long after I first watched it, which was almost 15  years ago. Since the movie goes back and forth between a comedy and a really sad, dramatic story, I guess you could call it unique. (The drama is much more at the end involving Andie McDowell's character.)

Supposedly, this is a true-life story of Steven ""Franz"" Lidz and his wacky family - the kid (Nathan Watt), the father (John Turturro) and the two uncles (Maury Chaykin and Michael Richards.). The story has a lot of Jewish flavor and religious themes, pro and con. It's not an easy story to explain so I won't go past what I've said that it's simply an interesting portrait of a different-kind of family with lots of laughs early on but tears later.

747657,5,630397788X,"This movie is funny ,toching and heart-wrenching film that is never cloying. The soundtrack is fantastic too! It makes you think about what's most inportant in life. It teaches a lesson about how we need each other and can learn something from anyone

My most favorite part of this film is Maury Chaykin's role of Uncle Arthur. In my opinion Maury is the greatest actor living. No one can bring the authenticity to any role they play like he can. Maury plays the role of Uncle Arthur with gentleness,whimsey and poigancy. I watch the scenes he's in over and over just to see him work his magic. This film should've won every award out there. It's more worth watching than lots of films people rave about and praise to the high heavens. Maury you should've won an academy award for this one and if had been up to me you would have!",1137801600,3,830,4.4605263157894735
747658,5,630397788X,"Wow! I am shocked at the low ratings on this wonderful movie! I saw this first because I am a Maury Chakin fan and I immediately loved it!

I enjoyed the way they showed how the scientist father is lost when his wife is dying, and his son finds comfort in Judaism. I love the way the two uncles enter the film, Arthur with his sweet bumbling walk and gentle ways; and Danny with his talk of conspiracy and hemlock.

I especially loved the part with the housekeeper and the way she wrinkled her nose when she said, ""We love eggs!""

All I can say is ""Whose we?""

""Call me Franz or call me nothing!""

In any case despite the few swear words I loved the fan and give Diane Keaton loads of praise for such a moving picture. The music was perfect and from his further work on ""Little Woman"" Thomas Newman is great, I can say he is delightful.

One of the most moving parts is after Steven's bar mitzvah and he asks his mother if she is dying. ""Yes, yes I am Franz.....I'm so sorry.""

I totally broke down here and every time I see it I cry. Get this movie and you will never feel sorry it is sweet, funny, and enduring.",1113609600,4,1113,4.125
747659,3,630397788X,"Normally I would rate this movie higher, I just feel that the movie is a little too hollywood.  But as a film, this is Sentimentalism at it's best.  John Tuturo gives a great performance (as usual) as a boys father who is so in love with his dying wife that he overlooks this needs of the rest of his family.  Michael Richards plays the dufus (is that spelled correctly?) as usual and I must say, he's damn good at it.  I feel that this is a great movie as a family love story, but I can't let slip the Hollywood affect.  Film buffs will know what I mean.",1107475200,,555,4.101851851851852

747691,3,630397788X,"This is a very well-made movie but it is nothing like the original book. The movie has elements of the book, but it has an all-together different feel to it, almost a diltuion of the story. Of course, as has been said, the book will always be better, but the film (directed by Diane Keaton) stands on its own.

I would recommend if you've read the book, see the movie only as a visual representation. If you've seen the movie and would like a wider appreciation of the movie, read the book.",1101513600,2,490,4.326086956521739
747692,3,630397788X,"but I really enjoyed this movie. Most of the reviewers seem to knock the movie because they have read the book. In any case, I think I liked it because the topic of hoarding is close to my heart and the eccentricities are charming and fascinating. I wish it had more depth and so I will probably end up reading the book. If you're interesting in gleaning- another side of hoarding- try ""The Gleaners and I"" for a superficial look at the subject.",1092960000,,445,4.373493975903615
747693,3,630397788X,"After reading the other reviews, I would love to read the book because it sounds like a wonderful book.  With that said, every film watcher must face the reality that books and films often have very little similarity if the book probes into the deep emotions of its characters.  Therefore, this review will focus on what the film has to offer relative to other films of its kind.
First, the cast is magnificent and do an excellent job in the movie.  Although Michael Richards has type-cast himself due to his strong personality in Seinfeld, he did an amazing job of portraying an equally quirky character.  John Turturro is generally amazing in everything and although Andy McDowell is a bit mechanical in her acting, she showed a range in this movie that was well beyond what we're use to in her other pictures.
Second, the story itself, albeit altered from the book, had a very nice flow and for a two hour film, conflict and depth was developed.  These things made the film not only watchable but also thought-provoking.
So, if you like thought-provoking movies and willing to accept that character depth is difficult to achieve in a movie, you might just like this one.  The price ... is not incredibly steep but a viewing from a library copy might be just the thing to convince you this movie is worth buying.",1076716800,2,1314,4.666666666666667
747694,2,630397788X,"Too much of a bad thing can be terrible. It's fish 4 days old, I wouldn't buy it. Or even rent it. The movie drips with treacle. Whoever said they cried during this movie must have an open canister of tear gas left around the house. Insanity runs in MY family, infact it practically gallops. But this adorably silly family acts more like silly putty.",1075075200,,350,4.4
747695,5,630397788X,"Sometimes a film should be taken on its own merit and not compared to the book on which it was based.  A film by nature creates a fixed reality not subject to the imagination of its viewers, so comparisons will always fall short.  This film is full of quiet beauty and captures moments of honest, deep emotions, and, regardless of possible variances from the memoir by Franz (Steven) Lidz and Uncle Danny's unfortunate similarities to ""Kramer"" from ""Seinfeld"", it is heartbreaking, life-affirming, and satisfying film experience.
Diane Keaton's first feature length not-made-for-TV directorial debut is a poignant and often humorous story.  Young Steven Lidz (Nathan Watt) is a normal boy growing up during the Cold War with his sister, mother, and his slightly quirky father.  The father, Sid (John Turturro), is excitable about science and his visions of a techno-topian future, endlessly inventing household gadgets, but he's also a romantic and deeply loves his wife Selma (Andie MacDowell).  Those future visions are blurred when Selma's health begins to wane.  Unable to cope with the slow demise of his mother, Steven runs away to stay with an odd pair of uncles, who seem to be two extremes of his father.  Uncle Danny (Michael Richards) is high-strung and sees anti-semitic conspiracies everywhere, while uncle Arthur (Maury Chaykin) is child-like and finds joy in the simplest of things (he collects lost balls in the park because he believes, if you listen closely as with seashells, you can hear the sound of the children who played with them).  There's a hilarious scene where the landlord sees the three outside the building and begins to chase after them; they escape to the apartment as if their lives were being threatened by a raging grizzly bear.
The strange, inventive, and sometimes playful, behavior of Steven's uncles is distracting enough to keep him from brooding about his mother's last days.  Instead of filling him with paranoia and neurosis, however, his uncles teach Steven about faith and family and the joys of life.  Thomas Newman's (""American Beauty"") music is perfectly suited to this bittersweet film.  In fact, I bought the soundtrack CD after watching the film for the first time.
By the way...the reviews by ""a viewer"" from Evanston and ""fred q. walrustitty""  have absolutely nothing to do with the film, and it's likely the reviewers wrote them as a joke.  Unfortunately, 11 out of 15 people believed them and found them helpful.",1054944000,12,2469,5.066666666666666
747696,5,630397788X,"This is one of my favorite, all-time movies. I have read the book and while the book is probably more accurate in recounting the actual family experiences, the movie can be seen as a parable reflecting some of the cultural tensions today. The mother, who represents humanism, is dying, leaving behind the scientific method (the father) who is eccentric because he is less than human. The mother and father balance one another. The son is an everyman figure, imitating his father at times, but also taking on the warm, humanistic tone of his mother at times. The recording of experiences with the camera is perhaps the memory of the boy, seeing the injustice of life (the caretaker) but also the warmth of his mother and the craziness of science without the human component.

The boy eventually goes to live with his uncles, who represent postmodern thought--a little crazy, sometimes paranoid, and open to religion (the father is anti-religious, while the mother is open to the more positive aspects of religion, as is often the case with their respective views of the world). With his uncles, the boy tries on their roles of paranoia and craziness, as well as religion, and finds the fit is not too bad, injecting some scientific method borrowed from his father to avoid the apartment owner. The death of his mother brings the symbolic throwing away the home-made movies of the mother by the father--the attempt to erase the memories of humanism, but the boy grabs the tapes and takes them to the synagogue to relive the memories of his mother. It seems that religion provides one last place to feel deeply in modern life, since humanism is so quickly vanishing. The last scene is deeply moving, as the camera (again recording life and existence) has the father, son, and uncles united, as a humanized science allows companionship with postmodern thought because of the everyman figure's acceptance of both.

Funniest scene--in the restaurant. This is a classic moment, regarding the multiple meanings of words an the individual's ""take"" on life (a very postmodern concept).

I hope it comes out in Blu Ray one of these days. I have watched the movie many, many times, and almost every time I see a bit more of the parable coming to the forefront. That seems to be the result of the film version (whether intentional or not), as the parable does not fit the original book. A great film; it should have received awards for many more things than just the music!

747697,2,630397788X,"Diane Keaton's film of Franz Lidz's dark, hilarious memoir bombed in the States - amid charges of anti-Semitism - and it's easy to see why. It's norra lorra laffs. Lidz's book about his four (count 'em - 4, not 2!) crazy uncles and his borderline-crazy father has a Dickensian scope and a Joycian dynamic. His view is gently ironic, and propelled by pace, bite and pathos. In this movie, simplification and scaling down - plus huge Hollywood compromises and significant changes in ethnicity - lose the balance. A great opportunity lost and, ultimately, a terrible shame.",993254400,16,570,4.947916666666667
747698,2,630397788X,"The psychedelic era's silliest secret agent is resurrected in a world that's moved on three decades. John Turturro (as Sidney Lidz) gets so much of the detail right, it's easy to take his resourcefulness for granted.  Everything, from Sidney's velvet frock coats and frilly shirts to the  casting (Andi McDowell's slinky sidekick Vanessa Kensington, scheming  henchman Richards, and Watt's Basil Exposition, the Ministry Man who  explains the plot) demonstrate how much Turturro, the creator of Barton  Fink, enjoyed doing his homework. Someone, however, should have weeded out  the dud gags and dissuaded Turturro from playing the villian (Ash) as well.  Overall, it would take a stone face not to crumple at Sidney's dodgy  catchphrases and irrepressible sexual desperation. ""Shall we shag now,  or shag later?""

747699,4,630397788X,"A wonderful, sensitive film. See it for the score alone (by Thomas Newman), but also for a surprising, underplayed performance by Andie MacDowell. Keaton's light touch provides enormous weight to a too-often  ignored subject in films: faith. While some object to the adaptation from  its original novel, I enjoyed seeing it fresh, not having read the book on  which the film is based. Books and movies are like apples to oranges--they  cannot successfully be compared. I'm a filmmaker myself, and I have yet to  meet another filmmaker who did not like this film. While it is by no means  a masterpiece, UNSTRUNG HEROES addresses the importance of the role memory  plays in forming a person's values and identity, connecting what has past  with what will be in a heartbreaking, breathtakingly beautiful narrative.
