3549749,3,B001ED3JGE,"Dear Brian,

I quote:

""For that matter, even the version voiced by Mark Hamill in Warner Bros.' just-released animated DVD, ""Batman: The Killing Joke,"" tops Leto's.""

Seriously? You get paid to write for CNN?

What you wrote is like saying, ""Even Da Vinci's Mona Lisa is better than the scribbling my 2-year-old made"".

Brian you are uneducated and unworthy of your job. Mark Hamill IS the joker. Do your homework next time (though I hope there isn't a next time for you.)",1470182400,,473,4.719512195121951

8297765,1,B001ED3JGE,don't see how this movie did so well at the movies the special effects seemed dated and no Harley Quinn or joker anywhere.,1519084800,,122,4.3478260869565215

8297767,1,B001ED3JGE,The movie really isn't that bad. People have gone into hysterics and trashed it without cause. I gave it a 1/5 because the sound is out of sync on my download and it really ticks me off,1488585600,,185,4.027027027027027

8297771,1,B001ED3JGE,"I love capes. What I don't love is when a decent concept, okay actors, and lots of money, get run through a grist-mill of ""nowness"". Joker isn't scary if he looks like he smells like axe body spray. I can't even blame the actor. Just the club promoter. His club stunk and wasn't worth the cover charge.

The plot: A tropey, never-identified, serious-toned, company woman talks for a really long time to some old military white dudes about how bad all these meta-humans are. The guys in post try to keep it interesting by doing violent cutaway scenes. Meanwhile, the guys in the Soundtrack Dept. and Warner/Chappell are doing elicit drugs with the guys in Marketing to keep up and keep things ""fresh"" like the kids say. Queue old foogy classic rock song number 59. Yeeeaah. Tha's right.

About halfway through the movie, the meeting ends. Yup. That meeting. The one at the beginning of the movie.  And thus, the ""story"" begins. The inciting incident is so buried in special effects that even the actors can't figure out something is now happening. But before you can say, ""Wait. Whaaaat?!?""  The bad guys are all gathered up to go somewhere to fight something. It's not that I don't remember -- it's that no one bothered to make some dialogue up. It's an attack. Maybe terrorism. And bullets are happening. And another lil wayne song. Then there are monsters. Who, although they don't really look like zombies, are basically zombies. You gotta get in close and hit the head and stuff. Some Squad members fight. Some don't b/c, you know... those kooky bad guys. Presto, a theme emerges: teamwork matters.

At this point the quest they're on becomes obvious. And not just because the music just got really loud. They have to stick together and go in search of the story.  Spoiler: they fail. But guess what they do find? Uhp. You guessed it. Dramatic irony. > Plot twist kinda < Who needs a story when you can say that none of this would ever have happened if that sassy lady at the beginning of the movie hadn't set out to do whatever it is the characters were brought together to do?  Bam. The snake ate it's tail. Along with several lost scenes that might have had some explaining to do.  And you thought you were gettin to old for this shit. The guys in music licensing ended up in Arkham. With the guys in post who were left to make a movie from the lesser half the dailies and the minutes to the meeting. That meeting. And the teams of writers hired to work on this movie until probable replacement with other teams of writers started huffing axe body spray and developed no powers. What. So. Ever. The suits decried their unappreciated effort to tolerate ""diversity"" by making things ""urban"" and landscaping around the henna tattooed third-generation-American hispanic dudes who got Taft-hartleyed into Screen Actors Guild with all their hours on set, except where the lost footage from the SiFi versions of Indie III Temple of Doom Mortal Kombat Mummy Meets Quetzaquatl Hokus Pocus crap was being spliced in. Will Smith's character assassinated his agent for making him dress like a pimp. And finally, a lesser known Kardashian sister took a crap in joker's club. The end.

Batman makes a cameo as a person who once caught the bad guys way before the meeting at the beginning of the movie happened, but it's Ben Afflick in need of a lozenge, so who cares.",1480291200,,3609,4.932454695222405
