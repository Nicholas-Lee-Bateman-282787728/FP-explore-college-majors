2922302,5,B000ULM980,"Great product, we loved this DVD, excellent quality, good color, just like the show.  I bought this to share with my 7 yr old daughter, we love the old stuff, it's so clean, language, situations and all.  Thank God for good old TV sitcoms and Family drama. It's what we need in this world again. Order this you won't be disappointed!!!  Thanks, from Tennessee",1214784000,8,359,4.578125
2922303,1,B000ULM980,Do yourself a favor and buy the complete first season.  You will surely want it after seeing these few episodes.  It will cost you a lot more to buy it in this broken down form. The original box sets are very well thought out and produced. Whose dumb idea was this anyway? Why not leave well enough alone and bring on Season Four already?,1209427200,7,338,4.265625
2922304,1,B000ULM980,"If you are curious about That Girl, you should skip merely buying this DVD since it's only the first DVD in the boxset and get Season 1 of That Girl. You must behold the Impeccable hair of Ted Bessell",1208131200,9,200,4.153846153846154
2922305,1,B000ULM980,Why are the DVD fairies wasting their time working on releasing only a part of Season 1 when the ENTIRE first season has already been released and is currently avaiable for anyone and everyone who wants to acquire it.  Would it have not seemed more logical to spend their time and effort working on getting Season 4 ready to be released for those of us who are presently still waiting????,1207008000,25,388,4.542857142857143

Also loved the remarks Marlo Thomas made about making the series,etc.  Will eventually have to get the remaining series.",1404432000,,253,4.5777777777777775

2922313,5,B000ULM980,"Born long after the 1960s? Curious about how your mother looked (or wanted to) in her teens and twenties? This compilation sets the stage for That Girl, the wildly-popular television comedy that broke new ground. The premise may seem tame today, a series of sketches about a stylish, vivacious young actress zooming around New York, fending off advances from producers,  attending caattle-call auditions and juggling low-paying jobs to pay the rent on her fabulous East Side apartment. Casting was inspired: it's impossible to imagine anyone but  Marlo Thomas as dreamy-eyed Anne Marie, and Ted Bessell as her faithful boyfriend Donald Hollinger. This first series doesn't quite measure up to the second. There are some awkward scripts and contrived plots. But if you want the full immersion in That Girl, opt for this sampler of the first season to get the full effect of the series.",1366934400,,884,5.089655172413793
2922314,5,B000ULM980,"The DVD was in perfect condition, well packaged and came in a timely manner.  I'd recommend this seller to others and I'd recommend the DVD for those who want a sampling of the show but aren't ready to invest in an entire season.",1364428800,,229,4.325581395348837
2922315,5,B000ULM980,It was in great shape. I sent it to my mom so I don't know how they played but it looked great and came early,1362355200,,109,3.4

2922317,1,B000ULM980,"The character yells, runs through rooms, hasn't one refinement to herself, and has a standard of living so unrealistic for her income, not just beyond typical ""Hollywood"" nonsense of 1966, but in her person, that it was to watch madness.  Her lack of the most basic manners alone would have then and would today destroy any opportunities in her life.

That Girl is a loser.  I found it as a nostalgic moment to be worthless.

In some cases, ""Hollywood"" is doing much finer work today than it did in yesteryear.  I recommend Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life) in its place.",1332374400,,566,4.564356435643564
2922318,2,B000ULM980,"This was not my first time buying 'sampler' DVDs, and I'm fully aware that some 'first season' broadcasts were mid-season replacements. However, normally 'season one' means a compilation of easily 6-8 episodes. This was a great disappointment. Only four episodes are included.

I well remember enjoying ""That Girl"" in its first run, and had not seen it in years. I'd expected a pleasant trip 'down memory lane.' I regret now that (since, as it true of many, I cannot afford Netflix or $36 DVD sets) I'd purchased what I thought could be some enjoyable breaks, only to find just four episodes, and those before the characters were well-developed. Even at this price, it is not worth the money.",1309824000,2,692,4.864406779661017
2922319,5,B000ULM980,"I remember this show as a little boy so i bought the 1st. season because it was a real bargin price,the following eposides we're quite a bit more than this and thats why i made the purchase...and it was a wholsesome show of that day just like gidget with the very popular sally fields...",1289692800,,287,4.333333333333333
2922320,4,B000ULM980,"THAT GIRL is one of the benchmark sitcoms of the 1960's, starring adorable Marlo Thomas as Ann Marie, an actress looking to make her mark in New York.  Ted Bessell is Ann's ever-faithful boyfriend Donald Hollinger.  This DVD presents four episodes from the landmark first season, along with some great extras.  THAT GIRL's die-hard fans will definitely want to spring for the complete sets instead, but for casual viewers, or buyers wanting a small ""sampler"", this DVD is a good start.

Episodes:

""Don't Just Do Something, Stand There"" - The show's debut ""preview episode"".  Ann Marie first meets Don whilst filming a commercial in the lobby of his building.

""Good-Bye, Hello, Good-Bye"" - Ann Marie leaves her small town of Brewster to seek fame in New York.

""Never Change a Diaper on Opening Night"" - Ann's audition for an acting job is almost ruined when she has to fill in as a babysitter at the last moment.

""I'll Be Suing You"" - A pedestrian, pushing a sewing machine, runs into Donald's car and sues Ann.

Extra features:  The original THAT GIRL pilot episode, which casts Ted Bessell as Ann's agent Don Blue-Sky; retrospective featurette ""That Show...That Woman...The Creation of That Girl"", ""That Girl in New York"" (a collection of outtakes from the New York location shoot), original network promos; plus audio commentary with Marlo Thomas and co-creator Bill Persky on ""Good-Bye, Hello, Good-Bye"".",1285459200,,1411,5.012875536480687

2922323,2,B000ULM980,I was very dissapointed in this DVD as it contained only 4 episodes. It should have contained the entire year for this price. :-(,1258502400,,129,4.416666666666667
2922324,1,B000ULM980,The entire first season has been out for over two years now. It can be purchased brand new for around seventeen bucks....So please...give me a logical explanation for this partial season one release! Help me make sense of it...bacause I am having a hard time making sense of it on my own!!!,1226966400,,290,4.596153846153846
2922325,5,B000ULM980,"No offense intended, but in regards to the other reviewers who haven't figured out why introductory DVDs of shows are being released...it's to INTRODUCE people who have never seen the show, or haven't seen it since its original airing.  If you're a diehard fan already, then you already know you can skip the intro DVD, and go on to the complete volumes.  (Duh!)  Let's stop picking on the producers who simply want to attract more viewers, who might not be ready to invest in 20-30 episodes.  I am so glad they're doing this finally.  For example, I fondly remember watching ""Alice"" after school as reruns, back in the 70's.  So, I got the intro 6-episode DVD.  Am I glad I did, instead of buying a whole season: I don't care for the show nearly as much as I did 30 years ago!  I DO love ""That Girl,"" though.  Marlo Thomas was a ground-breaker with this progressive show for its time.  She was TVs first truly independent woman.  She had to open the door before Mary Tyler More could walk through!  She's all for women's liberation, yet she does it so tastefully and adorably.  She's Ann Marie, and she's free-spirited and bubbly, a fun-loving extrovert with an amazing wardrobe.  It's a show that showcases all the fabulous 60's styles!  If you love the 60's or remember liking this show, go ahead and spend the measly cost for this intro DVD.  You will not regret it.  If you go on to buy the series, pass this one on to someone new.  Yea!!",1215561600,19,1443,4.484615384615385
