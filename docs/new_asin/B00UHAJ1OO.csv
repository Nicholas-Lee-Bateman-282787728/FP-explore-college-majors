7040513,5,B00UHAJ1OO,"What's not to love about Jill Scott, Eve, & Regina Hall!!  Great movie to watch on a rainy day, lazy Sunday afternoon OR girls night in. Storyline and characters are believable, NO overacting and best of all it's an hour and 20 mins.  You'll be able to consume just the right amount of popcorn, nachos, chips & salsa, chip & dip etc., without running out or having to pause the movie to go make more.",1504051200,,400,4.32
7040514,1,B00UHAJ1OO,"I am so disappointed in this movie. It was NOTHING like the book. They literally changed the entire movie and it was so fluffed and extra for no reason! From beginning to end the entire storyline was disappointing. The only good thing about it was the actresses, except Jill Scott who, as usual, was extremely extra, but then again I didn't like her character in the book neither!",1494115200,,380,4.602941176470588

7040518,3,B00UHAJ1OO,"No star for the script: but I do admit that I am saying that the ""flavor & texture"" of the women was not comfortable for me nor for them it appeared in too many spots.  At one point I was peeved because I thought they were doing a 'white' comedy: acting white and I didn't like that.  I thought I was going to see some black women doing some things delightful, confident and feminine but ''''real and solid''''... but I realize that's not reality nowadays.  [The Reality today is: What Selling!]  And that competes with ART.  (Art mirrors society and society mirrors art is what I'm trying to garner.  I'm cool with that.  But I can say this: ''''what is REAL nowadays and every day'''''' was real in the past and will be into the future.  OKAY, so for the sake of this argument, let's just say: what is real is real always....okay, so now, let's talk about ''''ethnicity'''' and  '''identity''''.  Okay.  I said it.  '''Art mirrors society and society mirrors art.'''
So, according to the Old People the young would greatly benefit from ART that helps them with ''''reality''', ''''the current stream of consciousness'''' during their times.  (Know what I mean?)  Okay.  So.  (what am I saying?): Since the African American ancestry, the lineage at the beginning...was The Great Mama, the great wise mama...Okay,  and solid and sensible....okay.  Well, suppose I said that is what I'm looking for in the movies starring AfricanAmerican women...I want to see her: Solid and Sensible and styling and making herself awesome like she has been for centuries...THEN...let us see what's on her mind: how she gonna do things.  OKAY....I GOT THAT OUT!!!
SHE HAS A LOT OF COMPETITION FOR HER '''MAN''', HER ''''MEN'''', and some say it is up to her '''man''' to find his way back to her, to them....
Women will always do these kind of exercises: the kind in this movie.  If they are in a ""no-free"" society
or if they are in a so-called ''free-society''...they will do these exercises where they have to '''discuss marriage'''' with their friends and themselves.  And it will always go something like this....(something like in this movie).  But then, that is where you come in as the viewing audience...  That's the way women do this stage....okay, that's art mirroring life. What about the rest of the movie...(with him in it) did that '''art'''' mirror life?
Women have to put their house/soul in order.  They have to establish their priorities and settle things out within: 'DO I'  OR ''DO I NOT,,,get married, have a kid, have a career////? Both.''  What do I really think?  What do I really feel?  What do I want?  What do I really want?  That's all very, very natural and normal.  And, it ain't pain free.
BUT...a lot of times women can't work it out within because it is so difficult.  Then it comes time to stop and take time and '''ask the universe'''.  Most people past and present say this is a ''vital choice''.  You will get an answer but it may not be one to your liking but you will come to see where it leads you.  And, of course, you are growing up in the path of it and it is the growing that is so painful but natural.  We have to be reminded that '''the dream'''' is one thing and 'l'''real life''' is another and so....IS IT BETTER TO KEEP IT REAL???...like the African American Lineage said to keep it during the 60s and 70s when the sex-craze began in America as Americans shed their Victorian Era sexual repressive and oppressive worldview.  And, it was the era to set women free with human rights and civil rights....BUT, that is part and parcel of ''''The Dream''''....that's not real.  So then, okay, what is women gonna do?  Will African American women keep their solid base....with their feet on the ground: sense and sensibilities that make sense: real and practical sense.  (Now somebody asked me, ""What are you saying?  Are you saying African American women should not think like Republican women...all dreamed up and can't deal with real life or poor people kind of thing, and, poor after they are repressed and depressed?)  Okay.  That's enough.
So.  Do African American have to reinvent themselves?  And lead the way for American women to gain something solid and strong that is dependable when dreams fall apart?  [And they will....and they will.]

I will watch this movie again.  Because I love the actresses. I loved the background: those white sheets and all those flowers and fashions.  (But I didn't like the scene where she gave him his clothes and put him out into the hallway naked with a towel.  (wHY?  She was embarassed by something she did. I didn't like that at all.)  It didn't seem ''black woman"".  Unnecessary.)
I had such problems with the script.  And the woman who came out of the bathroom and walked out without washing her hands.  I didn't like that either.  (Is this modern????)  Details.  Details.  [And what did I think of the great speech in the mirror in the bathroom???  Let's just say I won't think about that.  I don't understand that.]  The script does not show her realizing a real man wanted her.....but then today that's happening very, very often.  In other words, this character represents women out there who think they """"""should get married before it is too late"""""" and like I said before: THIS TIME, this period and this event IN YOUR LIFE IS SO VERY NATURAL...so then you work it out with yourself...  with the understanding you can always change your mind.  So.  With that venue in mind this movie represents a GENRE that needs to be explored a lot in the movies to help us all out.  Because society benefits from great people, great marriages, great single people and great business people (and) great parents in any style.  It would help the young people to see the question and the problem and let them know there is no '''one''' answer.
My PET PEEVE....
WAS THIS.....WHAT BLACK WOMAN WORTH HER SALT WOULD DELIBERATELY BREAK A GLASS AT A POOL AREA?  IN FACT ANYWHERE???
SO... OUT OF CHARACTER.... (I HOPE this is not part of the new black women.)  THAT WAS THE KIND OF STUFF I DIDN'T LIKE.  (And I have loss count as to how many white women have put their faces in a toilet to throw up....now that .....
THERE WERE SEVERAL SUCH INSTANCES OF '''NOT BLACK WOMEN'''' IN THIS MOVIE.

7040627,1,B00UHAJ1OO,"Don't waste your money. The entire movie is about women who constantly state that they won't be happy unless they get married. The women are so desperate to get married that they scheme and cheat. The main character even commits to an abusive relationship just so she can get married. In my opinion, the movie sends a bad message. The actors showed skill, but the lame script and the ditzy theme of the movie overshadowed any talent.",1440979200,2,433,4.636363636363637
