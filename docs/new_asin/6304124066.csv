7862762,4,6304124066,"I haven't bought all of the volumes yet but I have seen the entire series.  Like many reviews have pointed out, the series has a couple of different  aspects of importance.  One being that the past is an important thing to  remember and learn because in thisd series it is the only defenswe they  truely have.  In this episode we see Momiji pursue her wish to protect  people when a little girl is kidnapped in order to get to Momiji.  The  second part is the introduction of a new and very brazen character.  Its  here in the second episode on this tape that you get a strong glimpse as to  how Kusinagi and Momiji will connect.
This series has medium violence  with minor gunplay.  You don't see the constant percasion of flesh anfd  blood regardless of how the box and story seem to lead a person.  There is  some definite sexual references made.  Mainly being a running gag about  Momiji having cartoon creatures on her undergarments.  There a few moments  here and there where nakedness and undergarments are presented but no  actual nudity happens.  Its mostly like the upper back of a woman or  something nothing direct.
I'd say that this is a good series for those  beginning in anime because it has a lot involved that usually associate  with anime series.  Meaning that it has the elements of a continuously  developing storyline with character development.  Minor to medium battle  scenes with monsters.  It gives the exposure of what some violence in  animes have.  Again its great for new anime fans because it gives a little  of everything that animes have.
But remember this is NOT for young  children  more like maybe 10 or 11 and above.",964396800,,1653,4.637630662020906
