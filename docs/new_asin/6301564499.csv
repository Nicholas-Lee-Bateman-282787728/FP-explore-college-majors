7812420,5,6301564499,"This was actually a very good PPV from the NWA.  This event would start the tradition of other great Havoc's to come.  Let's get to the matches.

Tom Zenk vs Mike Rotundo:  Pretty good match.  A lot of great wrestling from both men.  I actually think that Rotundo was a very underrated wrestler and in this match he got to showcase his skills a lot.  Pretty good way to start the PPV.  I give this match a 5/10.

SST and Somoan Savage vs Midnight Express and Steve Williams:  Really good match from start to finish.  I think the SST (Somoan Swat Team) was a very underrated team and they actually brought it for this one.  The Midnight's were as always a joy to watch.  I liked this match.  It had a lot of back and forth wrestling, reversals, some arial manevers as well.  I give this match a 7/10.

Tommy Rich vs The Cuban Assassian:  Just a throw away match for the PPV.  I give this match a 3/10.

The Dynamic Dudes vs Freebirds for the NWA Tag titles:  Pretty good match actually.  I think the Freebirds were the real stars of this one but otherwise a good match.  I give this match a 6/10.

Steiners vs Doom:  Really good match as most of their matches were.  This was a good, hard hitting, stiff match that is worth the price of the video or DVD alone.  I give this match a 8/10.

Lex Luger vs Brian Pillman for the NWA US title:  Also a good match.  Pillman was always fun to watch for at the time he was the ""ultimate underdog.""  Good back and forth action and I actually thought that Pillman was going to win at one point but that did not happen sad to say. Otherwise, a great match.  I give this match a 8/10.

Skyscrappers vs Road Warriors:  I don't know why this was a huge feud at the time but it was and it was a decent one.  This match was a good hard hitting match between two very tough teams.  The only problem I have with this match is the DQ ending but other then that it was a great match.  I give this match a 8/10.

Main Event:  Sting and Ric Flair vs Terry Funk and Great Muta in a Thunderdome Cage match:  For those of you who haven't seen a Thunderdome match, it's basically this huge cage that's over 20 feet tall and it surrounds the ringside area.  It is a barred cage as well not the chain link.  This match was cool but got off to a rough start when the pyrotechnics caught some streamers or decoration that was on the cage on fire and Muta had to climb up the cage and put the fire out with his trademark mist.  After that though the match was off and running and a good match it was, mainly because of Muta and Sting.  They put on a great show and kind of made Flair and Funk look like they were standing still.  Each team had a man on the outside to represent them and they carried a towel.  Flair and Sting had Ole Anderson while Muta and Funk had Gary Hart.  At the end of the match it was Hart who threw in the towel for his team and allowed Sting and Flair to walk away the winners in a very hard fought contest that went over 20:00.  This match is a good example of the creativeness that the NWA had at the time and they pulled it off very well.  It was the first time for the Thunderdome but that match would be used countless times to settle the biggest feuds of that time.  I give this match a 9/10.

This is a really good PPV and started what would be a tradition with NWA and WCW.  The matches to really watch is the Steiner match, the US title bout, the 6 man tag bout, the Road Warrior match and of course the Main Event.  Each of these matches represent what was good about the NWA and what was good about this particular PPV.  On the whole I give this PPV a 8/10.  Definatly worth checking out.",1300320000,,3643,4.092198581560283
7812421,4,6301564499,"Another classic WCW/NWA event that I was able to get my hands on. Most wrestling fans that have been around for a long time can argue that the NWA's run during the late 80s especially during the year of 1989 was the best run that the company had when it came to high quality wrestling matches that really became an alternative to the sports entertainment that WWF was doing at the time.

Z-Man vs Mike Rotunda. Z-Man is actually Tom Zenk while Rotunda was the man that would go on to be ""I.R.S."" during his WWF run. Besides that, this was just an average opener that was nothing really memorable but watchable.

The Midnight Express & ""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams vs The Samoan Swat Team. The crowd was heavily into this match as Dr. Death was really over at this point in his career & even showcased his dominance over the Samoans whenever he was in the ring. A good match to watch as it not only did it's job in continuing the tension between Jim Cornette & the Express but was so well done in getting Williams over.

Tommy Rich vs The Cuban Assassin. This was just another match that came off as a filler & was nothing memorable or special about it.

NWA Tag Team Champions The Fabulous Freebirds vs The Dynamic Dudes. An interesting fact to point out about this match was that even though the Freebirds were the heels, they were being wildly cheered by the crowd since the Dudes just weren't getting over with that stupid gimmick that they had. Besides that, this was a solid tag team match as both teams worked well together & the atmosphere was very interesting to hear as well.

The Steiner Brothers vs Doom. This was the debut of the tag team of Doom that was lead by Woman (Nancy Benoit, RIP) while Ron Simmons & Butch Reed were the ones that were under the mask. Anyone that knows me knows that I loved the Steiners when they were in their prime & this match continued to showcase that as this was a great tag team match with both teams taking turns to control the action including Doom cutting off the ring & double-teaming with the referee's back turned. The ending involved Woman getting involved that lead to a series of matches between both teams but this one lived up to the expectations going in.

United States Champion Lex Luger vs Brian Pillman. This was one of those matches where one man completely carried this match from start to finish as Pillman really showed just how great in the ring he really was as he dominated Luger. Pillman used his speed & quickness to out-wrestle Luger by working on the arm & even using his high-flying ability while Luger tried to use his power to try to take control of the action. It was a good match but again, that was thanks to the effort of Brian Pillman than Luger.

The Road Warriors vs The Skyscrapers. The beginning of their fued started here as this was probably the best match in the history of Skyscrapers as Sid & Spivey held their own against Hawk & Animal. A very good stiff contest between both teams with Sid actually showing more athleticism here than he is known for while Spivey used his power to clash with the Warriors. The ending was sort of a jip but it really didn't take away from a good match between both teams.

Thunderdome Cage Match: Sting & Ric Flair w/Ole Anderson vs Terry Funk & The Great Muta w/Gary Hart along with Special Referee Bruno Sammartino. Before I begin, I just want to mention that I never noticed before but the Thunderdome Cage looked very similar to the Hell in a Cell except that it was a bit smaller. Anyways, the rules of this match was that for the match to end, the cornerman must throw the towel in for his team which would result in submission for his team. This was a wild encounter that really started to pick up some steam as time went on with moments to look out for like Sting & Flair using the cage to their advantage, Sting swinging around the cage into Terry Funk, Muta putting out a fire near the top of the cage with his green mist that was kinda funny, the wild exchange between Flair & Funk along with Ole Anderson, Gary Hart & even Bruno Sammartino getting involved in the action as well.

Overall, this was a classic show from the NWA although I did enjoy Great American Bash & Starrcade from this same year more, this is still one event that I would recommend to check out as again, it was a classic show.",1259884800,3,4332,4.398252184769039
7812422,5,6301564499,"I have said this many times before but this is when WCW was at its best under the NWA name. While it was failing financially, the action in the ring was first rate! I saw and still have this event from the original PPV so many of my memories come from that rather than the official video (which I guarantee you is edited down to fit a 3 hour card into 2 hours). Here are the matches:

Tom ""Z-Man"" Zenk vs. Mike Rotundo - Not a good bout, just average. I will say that the crowd in Philadelphia was much like the crowd you would've saw in the ECW area in the mid to late 90's (minus the bad language) as they royally booed Zenk and cheered Rotundo even though Rotundo was the heel!

Ends when Zenk reverses a flying bodypress on Rotundo after getting his tail kicked for almost the whole match!

""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams & Midnight Express vs. Samoan Swat Team & Samoan Savage - A great six-man tag as all six men put in a great effort and had the crowd going! Ends when ""Sweet"" Stan Lane accidentally runs into manager Jim Cornette's tennis racket!

Tommy Rich vs. Cuban Assassian - Much like the first match, nothing special. Just a filler to calm down the crowd.

NWA Tag Team Champions Fabulous Freebirds vs. Dynamic Dudes - The team of Shane Douglas and Johnny Ace challenged Michael ""P.S."" Hayes and ""Gorgeous"" Jimmy Garvin for the NWA World Tag Team Titles (back when holding an NWA title actually meant something)! The biggest surprise in this bout was that The Freebirds, though the villians, were wildly cheered while the Dudes were booed out of the building! Ends when Michael Hayes stops The Dudes from doing their double-slingshot back suplex and Garvin reverses it into a pin!

Steiner Brothers vs. Doom - A good tag team match as we see the first appearance of Butch Reed and Ron Simmons as DOOM. I should also note that they wore masks at this point and that Woman (the late Nancy Benoit) was their manager.

The match was very hard hitting and exciting! You have to see this if for no other reason than to see Scott Steiner in his prime! If all you know of him is ""Big Poppa Pump"" then I would DOUBLY recommend seeing this!

Anyway, it ends when Butch Reed (I think) puts a foreign object in his mask to headbutt Rick Steiner, knocking him out for the pin!

United States Champion Lex Luger vs. Brian Pillman - This was for the U.S. title and I will note that this was another match where the hero (Pillman) was booed while the villian (Luger) was wildly cheered. In this one though, you would've thought Pillman was the veteran as he pretty much carried Luger in this match! Ends when a miscue on Brian's part allows Luger to get the pin. This is pretty much a Pillman show though. This match is also on the ""Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon"" DVD from WWE that's still available.

Road Warriors vs. Skyscrapers - This was a very stiff, hard hitting bout. If you want to see how Sid Vicious could've been if he was a more dedicated worker, then this is the match to see. Spivey also had a very good match here and The Road Warriors were their usual impressive selves. Ends when Spivey is caught using a metal key on the Road Warriors! Warriors win on DQ.

Thunderdome Cage Match w/special referee - Bruno Sammartino: Ric Flair & Sting w/Ole Anderson vs. Terry Funk & Great Muta w/Gary Hart - Its never occured to me before but this match actually pre-dates Hell In The Cell in a lot of ways. Another unique rule to this bout was that only the teams' seconds (Ole Anderson for Sting/Flair, the late Gary Hart for Muta/Funk) could end the match for their teams by throwing in a towel.

This match started slow but picked up steam as time went on. Ends when Flair catches Funk in his figure-four leg lock while Sting repeatedly splashed Funk from the top rope! Meanwhile, Hart gets into it with Anderson. During the scuffle, Anderson hits Hart and sends his towel flying into the ring, thus ending the match! I should note that even Bruno gets in on the action as he decked Muta out of the ring too!

Overall, this was a great card. While wrestling has always been a soap opera to some degree, this is when the main focus was in the ring, not on angles. This is what wrestling I wish was still like sometimes. I know things change and all but there are some things that were just done so much better back then. That's why I liked guys that are eitiher retired now or are no longer here like Bret Hart, Owen Hart, Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit, an early Steve Austin, Tully Blanchard, Barry Windham, Arn Anderson, a young Sting, The Great Muta, Ric Flair in his heyday, The Four Horsemen, The Road Warriors, The Freebirds (I am thinking more of the original trio of Hayes, Terry Gordy and Buddy Roberts than the later version of Hayes and Garvin), The Von Erichs, The Rock n Roll Express, The Midnight Express among others. They spent years developing their craft to be the legends and remembered guys they became (I know that Benoit is not fondly remembered, and justifiably so these days, but I still mention him from time to time).

Sorry to go on a rant but when I review a card I remember seeing as a child and watch it again as an adult, it shows me a time that will never be back BUT it also reminds me of somethings that I am glad are gone but others that I wish was still here. Anyway, I would highly recommend this one!",1213574400,2,5337,4.394123606889564
7812423,4,6301564499,"Thanks once again to WWE 24/7, I was able to catch an old school classic event from the NWA in the very first ""Halloween Havoc.""  Keep in mind that the event was edited down to two hours however since I saw the live PPV replay & not the tape version, I don't know which matches were edited.

Z-Man vs. Mike Rotundo - Just an average opener, nothing more or less.

""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams & Midnight Express vs. Samoan Swat Team & Samoan Savage - This was a real fun match to watch as all four men here meshed well to bring forth a good match.  The story behind this match was mostly to put over Dr. Death as he completely dominated the Samoans whenever he was in the ring while the Somoans would gain control whenever the Express was in the ring.

Tommy Rich vs. Cuban Assassian - Same as the opening match, there wasn't anything special or noteworthy here.

NWA Tag Team Champions Fabulous Freebirds vs. Dynamic Dudes - The match itself was a solid match from top to bottom but the one thing that was more noticeable than anything else in the match was how the Freebirds were loudly being cheered despite being heels since the audience didn't buy into the ""surfer"" gimmick the Dudes had at the time.

Steiner Brothers vs. Doom - This was the debut of Ron Simmons & Butch Reed as the team of Doom, who were masked at the time.  This was tag team wrestling 101 as Doom looked very impressive as a team here by double teaming behind the referee's back, suspension for Scott Steiner to finally make a tag after getting beat on for minutes.  Good first match in their series of matches.

United States Champion Lex Luger vs. Brian Pillman - This was one of those matches that gives Luger his reputation of being a bad wrestler because Pillman completely carried this match.  Brian dominated a majority of the match with his mix of high flyin' moves & mat wrestling.  He worked on Luger's shoulder with the story being that he was tryin' to keep Luger off his feet thoughout the match which dominated.  Luger was on the defense most of the time & his offense consisted of punches,  kicks, and clotheslines whenever he was in control.  Luger got the win in the end off Brian making a big mistake but for the most part, this was a Brian Pillman exibition match.
(Also available on ""Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon"" DVD)

Road Warriors vs. Skyscrapers - Unlike the Steiners/Doom match, this was perfectly fits the ""irresistable force meets the inamovable object"" as this was a stiff match with both teams trying to outpower each other thoughout the match.  This was a good match to watch as this was the most athletic performance I've ever seen from Sid Vicious in his career as the best performance I've ever seen from Dan Spivey.

Thunderdome Cage Match w/special referee - Bruno Sammartino: Ric Flair & Sting w/Ole Anderson vs. Terry Funk & Great Muta w/Gary Hart - The rules for this match was that Ole Anderson or Gary Hart had to throw in the towel for their team for the match to end.  This also used the Thundercage structure that was WCW's version of Hell In A Cell that not only covered the ring but the outside area as well.  This match started out as a regular tag match but evolved into a four man brawl with each man using the cage at one point or another.  Some ""highlight moments"" to look out for was Sting & Flair at various times using the rope that was the in the top corner of the cage to swing onto Terry Funk like ""Tarzan"" and Sting doing a huge leap splash from that same top corner of the cage all the way into the middle of the ring.  The match was wild (the usual with Terry Funk matches) and truely one of the best matches held inside the Thundercage structure.

Overall, this PPV doesn't rank up high there as other NWA PPV's this year (Great American Bash, Starrcade) but the matches were still good quality overall and it's an event I would recommend to get whenever you get the chance.",1193702400,,3907,4.4411764705882355
