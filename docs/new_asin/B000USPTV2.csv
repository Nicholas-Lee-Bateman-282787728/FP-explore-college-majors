8214624,2,B000USPTV2,Visually lovely and probably an interesting story but this Italian movie is dubbed in German with no sub-titles.  I re-examined the data sheet for this item on Amazon and no language was listed - I assumed that meant English - big mistake.,1336176000,2,239,4.690476190476191
8214625,4,B000USPTV2,"I just saw a small snippet of this film on a DVD called ""Celebrity Nude Revue: The Saucy Seventies: Volume Two"".  As a kid, I loved Nastassja Kinski almost right away.  First I saw ""Tess"", and then she blew me away in ""Cat People"".  She is so gorgeous!  And in this foreign film, she appears nude in several scenes.

When I wrote down the title of this film, I went to Amazon right away to look for it.  But, unfortunately, it is only available as a PAL region DVD.  And even that with no English subtitles.

Well, I found this film available somehow on eBay.  Someone who has the Italian import of this film and he burns Region-free versions of this film for sale on DVR.  I bought this movie from him through eBay.  It's not the greatest mastering of the film, plus it has no English subtitles (only Japanese), but I still wanted it anyway.

I don't understand the story thoroughly because there is so much obvious dialogue in German or Italian.  But, to me, it doesn't matter too much.  Nastassja Kinski was just about 18 or 19 years old then, and was so frisky and free-spirited in the movie, that I just enjoy seeing her on film.

Who knows?  Someday, it might just surprise us that there will be a remastered Blu-Ray release of this film someday, and with English subtitles. I'm telling you right now, that I would gladly pay over fifty bucks for this movie in High Definition Blu-Ray because Nastassja Kinski is just so beautiful.

I'm sure many of us are still waiting for ""Tess"", and ""Cat People"" on Blu-Ray.  I sure hope all these films, and anything else starring my beautiful Nastassja Kinski, will be on remastered Blu-Ray someday soon.",1318464000,5,1649,4.513513513513513
