7045438,5,B00UIFDWKM,"If i was the president of HBO i would hire Tetsuya Nakashima to write and direct True Detective Tokyo, this is astounding fearless filmmaking, no holds barred and no consession and no mercy for the viewer in this detective case of inmense personal destruction. This is the type of films that hurts and punishes you yet it entertains you.
A schizophrenic detective finds out that her gorgeous daughter has been missing for more than a week and he starts the case making inquiries about her with family and friends, slowly and painfully he and we start to find out that she is not that angel face girl that every teen adores.

This one deserves to be seen in the biggest screen available. Kudos to main actor koji yakusho for not pulling punches, stand in awe for Nana Komatsu for her debut role of the devil in disguise as Kanako, and finally Tetsuya Nakashima for making a film noir unlike any other.",1449187200,12,900,4.590062111801243
7045439,1,B00UIFDWKM,"Beware. This is a rip off, a crop from 2.35:1 to 1.78:1 and even that is poorly done so that the faces are elongated. Barely made it through twenty minutes before giving up to wait for a proper disc. The subtitles, though not the worst I've seen, are Chinglish. Despite the legitimate looking packaging, it looks like it was copped off Chinese television. I should have noticed the usual giveaway -- Malay in the subtitle options -- but hit buy too quickly when I thought I saw a way around my frustration at the SFIFF scheduling only one impossible to attend late night screening.

7045442,5,B00UIFDWKM,"An amazing frenzied tale of love, sweet revenge and stomach-clinching angst, hatred and fear. Think the tween romance manga First Love meets Quinten Tarantino.

7045445,3,B00UIFDWKM,"A down on his luck former cop finds out that his teenage daughter Kanako has disappeared after a call from his ex-wife and he tries to find her.  In a parallel story, a bullied male classmate of Kanako is seemingly befriended by her, but the previous boy she was close to committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the school--which is only the first clue that being friends with Kanako is maybe not such a great idea.

The World Of Kanako is a genuinely crazy movie featuring graphic violence, rape (male and female), copious drug use, flashes of animation and scenes with so much cutting they might make Michael Bay dizzy--but it all kind of feels like a lot of flash and fury put to the service of a story that is fundamentally soulless, much like the title heroine who is a pretty but empty vessel, incapable of empathy or love or regret--or hate.  She glides through life unaffected by the pain she causes because, to her, life is like a dream where there are no rules, no morality, and no logic.

It's very likely The World of Kanako is intended as some sort of social commentary on Japanese society but that element was lost in translation, at least for this American viewer.  What's left is a crime film that is lively but genuinely nasty, a parade of violence and degradation without a single likable character or a reason for the viewer to care about what's going on or whether the title heroine is actually alive or dead.

Some people will undoubtedly appreciate The World of Kanako a whole lot more than I did.  I found myself impressed at times with how over-the-top-crazy the movie was but also relieved when it was finally over.  It wasn't really my kind of film but there's something compulsively watchable about it anyway--which is as close to a recommendation as I can offer.",1457136000,3,1795,4.5875
7045446,5,B00UIFDWKM,"Nine Things About the Film ""The World of Kanako""

1. Japan has mastered the art of the ultraviolent, bitterly bleak movies that destroy any good thoughts that exist anywhere in your body. Recent examples of this are I Saw the Devil and Killers in 2015. This is one of those movies.

2. It's about a guy named Fujishima, who used to be a cop but is now a security guard. He learns that his daughter is missing, and uses his skills to track her down. He discovers that his daughter is not who he thought she was.

3. The opening credits make you think of a comic book movie, or maybe a Tarantino movie. The words ""KILL!"" and ""F#*K!"" are printed large on the screen. It's a great attention grabbing device. But this is not a comic book movie.

4. There is really nobody to root for in the movie. At first you root for one person, but something happens and you can't do that anymore. So you try to root for someone else, but that doesn't last long, either.

5. This movie offers up drugs, bullying, suicide, torture, rape, pedophilia, and lots of blood. If that's your thing, this is a treat.

6. To keep the movie frenetic and wild, there are a few hyper, drug-fueled fast-edited scenes. There are also a few animated scenes.

7. It's hard to find any deep, underlying message here, unless you take Kanako's world as a metaphor for the rest of the world. It's mostly just about the complete and final breakdown of a man that doesn't fit this world.

8. Did I mention this movie was violent and cruel and depressing?

9. This is an nihilistic movie that makes you feel like you're on acid mixed with cocaine. It's not exactly a pleasant trip, but once you start it, you won't be able to stop until it lets you go.",1457136000,10,1709,4.349056603773585

8706938,3,B00UIFDWKM,Interesting watch that almost mimmiks Siono Sano work outside it's ability to tie up it's philosophical point with a satisfactory ending. If this film was edited down to an hour and a half you would end up with film that didn't drag for it's last quarter.,1519776000,,255,4.565217391304348

8706940,1,B00UIFDWKM,"**POSSIBLE SPOILER**
This is a movie that seems to have been written by committee. A committee of people who wanted a highly stylized, Tarentino-esque circus with some Old Boy and Infernal Affairs thrown in. The characters are almost all hateful, unsympathetic and what is the true cinematic poison here: uninteresting. There is just no one to identify with or cheer for or care about in any way shape or form - to the point that you lose interest pretty quickly. The protagonist is an alcoholic who beats and rapes women (including his wife and daughter) several times during the film which simply makes you want bad things to happen to him - if you still care at that point. The film's run time it way too long with what feels like multiple endings and not only are there bad, uninteresting characters everywhere, there are ones that pop up half-baked and we are supposed to be interested in their part of the story. It is just such a mish-mosh mess that the only emotion it elicits from the viewer is anger at the filmmakers imo.

Not only is this movie bad it is also silly. And silly in places where it shouldn't and isn't trying to be silly. I really can't say enough bad things about this film and I am no novice when it comes to over-the-top Japanese Cinema being a big fan of Miike and particularly Ichi The Killer. So when I tell you that The World of Kanako offends me, but I love Ichi I think that tells you A LOT...

I wasted my time and money on this one. Please don't waste yours.",1495411200,2,1495,4.413043478260869
8706941,5,B00UIFDWKM,"""The World of Kanako"" is a terrific thriller. Kaji Yakusho stars as a divorced ex-cop with severe mental problems who goes on a quest to find his missing teenage daughter Kanako, played by the lovely Nana Komatsu in her film debut. Just be forewarned: it's definitely not for the squeamish.",1494374400,2,290,4.82
8706942,3,B00UIFDWKM,"This movie is put together very well. Great scriptwriting, directing, cinematography, editing, etc.  All very cool.  Unfortunately the violence and torture gets worse and worse and begins to detract from enjoying the good filmmaking.  Not only is the violence excessive but it becomes outrageous (and implausible; the main character is somehow indestructible) but not in a comedic way like a Quentin Tarantino  movie. I don't know why people keep making movies with gruesome torture.  I've seen enough already and it's really not entertaining. Despite the gratuitous violence the movie is still worth watching once.  Or skip it and watch the better movies from this director.",1494201600,2,675,5.380952380952381
8706943,5,B00UIFDWKM,"This is one of those films that you need to pay attention to. It is about Kanako Fujishima who is a bright and beautiful high school student. She is the cool set all by herself and everyone wants to know her. Then one day she goes missing with no trace and no apparent reason for having done so. She lives with her mum who has divorced her father due to his atrocious behaviour.

He was a cop who quit the force around the same time and has become a drug and drink dependant security guard ever since  a state of affairs which has done little to improve his behaviour. However, when their daughter goes missing he is called by his estranged wife to find her. Thus begins a search in which he wants to find his daughter, but in doing so he uncovers a whole side to her that he had never imagined.

Now this is a film that I completely loved and was a bit bowled over by to be honest. It starts a bit full on with plenty of blood splatter  a theme that is repeated rather a lot throughout the 114 minute run time. Ex cop Akikazu is a real piece of work, brutish, violent, paradoxical and about as likeable as a bout of gangrene.

He explodes onto the screen is a flurry of abuse which he sort of maintains throughout. He drives a 1970s Nissan Gloria which is in keeping with a lot of the styling here. That being the opening sequences are very seventies and full of Batman like words imposed in cartoon on the screen  mainly violent or profane. There is animation throughout too. It is violent, it is bonkers in places and to my amazement I actually laughed a couple of times. There are a few minor issues with continuity but nothing that could possibly detract from the overall impact of this great piece of Japanese movie making.",1482278400,,1729,4.304615384615385

I didn't get all the way through, but if watching girls and boys (*yes both) get raped by older men, then this is your movie. Otherwise, I'd advise to avoid this film. This kind of content should be disallowed in an R-rating, in my opinion it is unwatchable.",1468800000,4,322,4.295081967213115
