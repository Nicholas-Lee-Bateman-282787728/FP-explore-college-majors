2472512,5,B000CS43OY,"I, too, took my family to see this amazing production in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park.  The music is riveting, inspiring and breathtaking.  The dancing is spell-binding and thunderous.  We enjoyed all the performers and heartily recommend the CD and the DVD.  The message is universal - don't become lost to the daily grind, but rather embrace your heritage and family.  Five stars isn't high enough a rating for the emotions evoked.",1150329600,6,434,5.142857142857143
2472513,5,B000CS43OY,"Spirit the 7th Fire is a stage production built around Native American prophecy, and it's message has never rang truer than it does right now, not just for First Nations people, but all peoples.  The Spiritual Power of 7th Fire is undeniable, as is the electricity and passion of the performances.  The three main charachters, Brandon Oakes, Tamara Podemski and Chief Hawk Pope all turn in work that you will not soon forget, and Brandon doesn't even utter a word during the whole show!  Tamara Podemski's voice and stage presence will leave you breathless and longing for more from this talented artist. Hearing Chief Hawk Pope sing is like hearing 7 Generations of Ancestors reverberate through time.  In a nut shell, 7th Fire is a DVD for the ages and one you will watch again and again.

The only thing better than the DVD was actually being there in Philadelphia and really feeling a part of the whole production. It was truly a life altering experience and one I hope someday to experience again, should the show come of hiatus.  Until then, I will enjoy this DVD and remember.......",1134864000,17,1089,4.735449735449736
2472554,2,B000CS43OY,"By itself, the work is well done.  What I was looking for was a DVD version of the ""Spirit"" that was performed in Green Bay, Wisconsin in 1999 (I think).  I have the VHS version and have watched it dozens of times.  Of course, VHS is going the way of the Dodo bird.  The new version falls short of the old one that was first aired on PBS.  The modern dance company added the punch that is needed to make the production really pop.",1355961600,,430,4.071428571428571
2472555,5,B000CS43OY,Very well done and easy to follow.  Loved the music and the regalia was beautiful.  We watched this with our Naive friends.,1355011200,,123,4.545454545454546
2472556,2,B000CS43OY,"I too was very disapointed with the DVD version of Spirit. I have the VHS original and have watched the performance, spellbound, each and every time since I first saw the performance on PBS. The DVD version is a ghost of the original. It lacks power, and cohesion. Gone are the brilliant dance segments. The performance has lost the rhythm and fluidity which made the original so powerful and deeply profound.  I found the visuals to be distracting at best. The feather dancers are wonderful and, thankfully, Chief Pope Hawk remains compelling.  With all due respect to the performers and creators there is just no comparison. I'll be looking into someone to copy my VHS to DVD.",1324512000,,678,4.786324786324786
2472557,5,B000CS43OY,"I'm from Australia, as far away from Native Americans as you can get.

This was wonderful from start to finish.  The music from the 4 pow wow singers, to Chief Hawk Pope and Tamara Podemski was powerful and uplifting. Brandon Oakes comes to life as the journey unfolds.  Patrick Mirabel, who I thought was definitely as good as his brother Robert was a fine addition to the music.  I was impressed with Rudy Youngblood and Marty Pinecoose, their dancing is wonderful and you can't help wanting to get up and join in, add to them the beautiful shawl dancers and you have wonderful native dancing.  Kudos to cello player Micheal Kott, his beautiful instrument is heard from start to finish and adds a depth of sound that only a cello can.  Finally Peter Buffet should be commended for writing and producing such a wonderful piece of entertainment.

I would have loved to be able to see this production live but alas will have to do with this DVD.

You will not be sorry watching this, the colours, costumes, drums, music and dance is woven together to make it relative to all who watch it.

I watch this, on average, at least three times a week.  It is a DVD that never fails to lift me from feeling down, by the time I'm finished watching this I'm calm and relaxed.

A perfect addition to ones DVD collection",1323302400,5,1307,4.495762711864407
2472558,5,B000CS43OY,"Spirit: The Seventh Fire is about one American Indian's journey back to place. From the screams of cell phones, fax machines, and endless city life, a successful business man finds himself confused when an eagle feather enters his life. Throughout his journey, he discovers himself, his spirit and where his ""place"" truly is. A moving, graceful, musical performance. At least I thought so.",1266105600,2,389,5.190476190476191
2472559,4,B000CS43OY,"An uplifting, get up and dance, and within the dance you'll find yourself kind of movie.
Highly enjoyable. Glad I have it.

2472560,5,B000CS43OY,"This DVD was absolutely breathtakingly beautiful to watch.  At times during the film it brought tears to my eyes and at other times filled me with joy.  This is truly a spitiual journey of life and what it means.  The dancers be it pow wow or other were absolutely wonderful.  The music exceptional, The visual effects beryond your imagination.  Isn't it funny how it takes our first people to get the message across to us(without words) on what happens when you get too caught up in our technological lives. Ditch the cell phones, ipods, tvs, and puters. Life was simple before them and beautiful.. and has become complicated and problematic since then. This vidio is worth the bucks and should be seen by every man, woman and child over 10.
I can see why it is up for a NAMMY Award for Best Video 2007 and by George I sure hope it wins.  Fabulous piece of work - added note - Bill Clinton and Tom Brokaw are two of the noteables that help bring it to life on film. I applaud them for doing so.",1189209600,5,995,4.351351351351352
2472561,3,B000CS43OY,"I expected more from this performance after seeing the first Spirit, a journey in dance. But compared to the original show, this one lacked cohesion and unity, as well as visual appeal to me. Except for the excellent Rudy Youngblood, the dancers seemed clumsy and out of shape, Patrick Shendo is doing his best but can't measure up to brother Robert and the main character seems just to be going through the motions without any real conviction. Even the music doesn't ""flow"" the way it did in Spirit, a journey...Chief Hawk Pope still has his hypnotic voice, but the lady singers and dancers lacked grace and ultimately, the whole thing left me frustrated.",1182556800,6,656,4.814159292035399
2472562,5,B000CS43OY,"You don't have to have an ounce of Native American blood in you to enjoy the messages this DVD brings. How do we seek out enjoyment in life? There is much more meaning in life than that weekly paycheck, and we keep searching for it. The loudest message for answers is those little voices you have a habit of avoiding. This performance is teaching us the lesson to listen before you are MADE to stop the fast merry-go-round we ride, usually caused from going to fast and breaking something you don't want broken. We have to admit though, the worse break is within our spirit. Money doesn't mend this, but listening to our spirit voice does. Many of us are visual learners, and we may need a heavy dose of entertainment to watch it as well. This film gives you what you need without having to hear the words spoken to you.",1170720000,3,820,4.401315789473684

8101628,5,B000CS43OY,"The other ""Spirit"" does not compare at all.  That version was a Hollywood version and it shows.  If you want the truth, you go to the source, right?  No difference here:  a Native American story told, scripted, acted and scored by Native Americans.  My grandkids love watching this for the music and the story.  REAL history is taught in this.",1428537600,2,343,4.633333333333334
