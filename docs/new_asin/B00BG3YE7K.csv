5615711,5,B00BG3YE7K,"A sure sign of a great documentary is one you find compelling when its subject would not normally be of personal interest to you. To me, the outdoors is that space between my front door and my car door. A film about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail is not one that I would have normally sought out for myself (I didn't even know what the PCT was before I saw this doc). So it was with a bit of trepidation that I agreed to follow a friend's suggestion and watch ""Tell It On the Mountain."" I was glad I did.

The film follows several hikers as they set out on the Pacific Crest Trail, a 2,663 mile path that begins in southern California at the Mexican border, winds through California, Oregon, and Washington to the Canadian border.

The film is an awe-inspiring scenic tour of some of the most diverse and beautiful terrain in the world. The jaw-dropping, breathtaking photography takes us to places we mere mortals will probably never venture. And on all that alone, this film would be well-worth viewing.

But that's not what this movie is really about.

Like all great sports movies, ""TIOtM"" is not truly about sports. The film's greatest strength is its decision to focus on people rather than the trail. We meet a group of folks who all set out with the same goal but for different personal reasons. Their individual stories collected present a multifaceted, textured journey: the strive for a personal best, a way of life, a spiritual transformation, even an adventure for a couple to share.

The film is about how the Pacific Crest Trail defines several individuals' view of who they are and to what limits they will go in order to further define themselves and achieve their goals.

""TIOtM"" had me rooting for its characters only to discover by the end of the film that I was  actually rooting for myself all along. Through these extraordinary individuals I found myself thinking of all the dreams and goals I still have in my life. Seeing their passion and commitment was inspiring. I realized that the only thing between what I am and what I can be is simply my decision to be it well, that and 2,663 miles, but whose counting?",1362960000,,2136,4.575916230366492
5615712,5,B00BG3YE7K,"Being a nature lover and hiker personally this documentary was a must watch for me. I have hiked small trails around my home but watching this film about the Pacific Crest Trail has made me want to try doing a long distance hike in the future. The film follows hikers from the U.S doing the trail and also foreigners that traveled there just to do this amazing 4-6 month, 2,663 mile hike from the border of Mexico to the border of Canada. Watching these hikers throughout the long hike and seeing how it effects each of them both physically and mentally is a inside look that many people never see or understand about what hikers go through. The trail tests ones mind and body's ability to handle the 5 months of solitude and the weather conditions and trail conditions. They did a wonderful job on this documentary giving us viewers a look into life on the trail and how it is a life changing experience for anyone. Overall I feel it is a must watch for anyone to see how hiking and experiencing nature can be a good way to just relax and find yourself and go and be worry free for however long you may choose to hike. A very inspiring and motivational film that I plan to recommend to my friends and family!!",1362873600,,1210,4.3822222222222225
5615713,5,B00BG3YE7K,"This movie is a must for the person who enjoys soul searching, for the future and current backpacker or simply for the beauty of simplicity that comes from hiking for 3-5 months. As a college professor, I have shown this movie to my students at various occasions, and it has allowed for great discussions on the subject of backpacking, life,  human journey and the importance of adventure in our lives.

While this movie is entertaining, it offers spectacular views of the Pacific Crest Trail and subtlety teaches about the many small details that make backpackers lives so unique and meaningful. But importantly, it allows for reflection time on the challenges that come with hiking long distance and the connections that grow from such an accomplishment. Thanks to intimate encounters with the characters and their hand held cameras, it allows us to get a glimpse into the mind frame of backpackers, athletes, couples, foreigners, and more, like not many movies have done.",1362787200,,974,5.043478260869565
5615714,5,B00BG3YE7K,"A documentary told from the viewpoints of an ultralight marathon hiker, several couples en route and other well known trail figures, I could feel their challenges, rewards and struggle in a personal way.  ""Tell it on the Mountain"" is a glimpse into a different world, a revealing view into life beyond the routine we know everyday, but they will eventually have come back to.  This film superbly captures the flavor of the subtle but epic journey hikers experience as they make their way the length of the Pacific Crest Trail.  Thumbs up !",1362700800,,539,4.774193548387097
5615715,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I've seen PCT documentaries before, and really enjoyed myself, but not NEARLY as much as when I watched ""Tell It On the Mountain"".
As an avid hiker and sadist I have toyed with 'doing' at least one of the three trails comprising the Triple Crown.  That being said I have done research on the requirements for the Pacific Crest Trail, the Appalachian Trail, and the Continental Divide Trail, I have watched movies that were dry and regimented that didn't really give me a sense of what it's LIKE out there on the trail.
This documentary is kind of a mashup Reality-Documentary that follows several individuals, and pairs, on their journey emotionally, physically, naturally, and mentally all the way up the PCT.  It brought me the nitty-gritty, emotional draw that makes me go out into the mountains, meanwhile being helpful for technicalities and gear, and it reaches into the philosophical mentality of living-in-the-wilderness during an age of technology-based lifestyles.  I got that ""story"" that I was looking for, that ""realism"" that only people can bring to others through experience and storytelling.
After watching this film I couldn't help but feel inspired and moved to get out on the trail.  It's an experience.",1362614400,,1222,5.064676616915423
5615716,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I'm a basically sedentary person, but watching Tell It On The Mountain made me want to find some hiking boots and get acquainted with the great outdoors. The interwoven stories of several thru-hikers and section hikers, each on the trail for his or her own reason and with drastically different levels of experience, really bring home both the difficulties and the rewards of the 2600+ mile hike.  I found myself admiring the tenacity of all of the hikers both on the trail and in the incredible amount of planning they had to put in before ever setting foot on the ground.  Watching it with family members, I could hear audible gasps at some of the more challenging aspects of the trek (the altitude... mosquitoes... injuries... inclement weather...), as well as many sighs of appreciation at the beauty of the scenery.

Although I don't expect to hike the PCT myself in the near future, I am glad I got to experience it vicariously through this movie, and I recommend it for anyone who does hike, has ever hiked, wants to hike, or just appreciates seeing the gorgeous variety of terrain in California, Oregon and Washington.",1362614400,,1126,4.793814432989691
5615717,5,B00BG3YE7K,"Nature documentaries are usually not my thing, and when my friend recommended this film to me, I was not so sure at first. I can honestly say that I was surprised with the content of this movie, in that it really made me want to get up and go--even though backpacking is not necessarily my thing. The Pacific Crest Trail is epic, and I wish more people knew the facts about it, or even how intense it can be hiking back and forth from Mxico to Canada.  My hope is that this film will find a greater audience and maybe one day get a more wide release. If anything, I think that visitor centers along the Crest Trail should stock their shelf with it because it is so entertaining.  It made the Trail come alive and not many other films can boast the same.",1362528000,,753,4.222222222222222
5615718,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I had a vague idea what the Pacific Crest Trail was, but I did not know the extremes that hikers go through to conquer it in a single season.  This film is very entertaining and gives a glimpse into a great challenge of mind and body of a few hikers and the various experiences encountered along the way.  I recommend this to anyone based on its entertainment value alone, and highly recommend it to hikers, backpackers, and even non-outdoors folk looking for the motivation to attempt a great personal challenge.  You can take away as little or as much as you like, regardless, you won't be disappointed.  I might buy a couple more copies to give away as gifts.",1362528000,,662,4.53781512605042
5615719,5,B00BG3YE7K,"If you want to know more about what it's like to hike a long trail (particularly the Pacific Crest) there's no more entertaining or realistic depiction than this film.  Tell it on the Mountain follows a small cast of characters (Including Scott Williamson, and Billygoat) along their journey, through the joy of their wilderness adventure and all the hardships, blisters, and sore muscles that come with it.  More so than any previously produced film I've come across, you get truthful, sincere insight into the life of thru-hiking the PCT from hikers during their experience.  With no hesitation, I recommend this to anyone who is thinking about undertaking a thru-hike of their own, or anyone who is seeking to understand why your loved one is so passionate about long distance hiking or outdoor adventure travel.",1362441600,,815,5.067164179104478

5615736,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I have seen many of the long distance and thru hike films. Tell It On the Mountain follows several individuals and couples as they go from the Mexican border to the Canadian border on the Pacific Crest Trail. As a lifelong long distance hiker, I notice that some of these films concentrate too much on the drama or too much on the scenery. This film does a great job of balancing these two aspects of a long distance hike. The editing is well done, a challenge with a film made up of footage from disparate characters. We like it enough to make it a feature film at the Dahlonega Trail Fest.",1421712000,4,591,4.333333333333333

5615738,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I received this DVD in exchange for an honest review.

This documentary takes you on the epic journey, from beginning to end, of several thru-hikers of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). These hikers come from different backgrounds and walks of life. Fitness levels and hiking experience among the hikers also differ. The PCT, one of the Triple Crowns of Hiking (the other two are the Appalachian Trail and the Continental Divide Trail) is 2,650 miles long and takes most thru-hikers between 5-6 months to complete.

The documentary offers a peek into the physical rigors involved in hiking the trail. Even as an avid hiker, I shudder at the thought of attempting what must be an incredibly arduous and punishing hike. Through on-the-spot field interviews, I was also able to get a visceral sense of the hikers' states of mind -- apprehension, frustration, discouragement, quiet confidence, elation, and a myriad other human emotions.

The cinematography is beautifully done. The film captures not only the beauty and serenity but the desolateness and austerity of stretches of the PCT. As a nature-lover, this aspect of the film was a real treat for me. If you're one of those people who like to rough it in the outdoors, trust me, this one's for you. For those who plan on hiking the PCT for the first time, this documentary will help you get a bit of a foretaste of the journey that awaits you.

The experiences of the hikers in the documentary really resonated with me. I also learned a lot about the PCT. I'd have to say I really, really enjoyed this DVD. I would highly recommended it to hikers, backpackers, nature-lovers, or anyone who simply wishes to learn more about the Pacific Crest Trail.",1417910400,2,1698,4.824742268041237

Very well done, good footage, nice insight into the PCT, and what through hiking entails. Not only did this film give great insight to the trial itself, it also gave a glimpse at the hikers that undertake this adventure. It is nice to meet the real people and characters that call the trail home for 5+ months a year. This film made me want to skip work and go backpacking...actually I want to quit work and go backpack. I recommend this for anyone who is an outdoor or hiking enthusiast. Or better yet if you are thinking of undertaking a PCT hike, (through or section,) this is a must watch.",1406764800,,694,4.4296875

5615748,5,B00BG3YE7K,"Hands down, the best film/documentary I have ever watched, related to hiking/backpacking, long distance trails and the beauty/grandeur/sanctuary/significance of the backcountry.  A masterful piece that intertwines very diverse personal stories, with a common love and desire to experience the simple yet challenging life on the trail.

Nothing else really captures the reasons, the feelings, the emotion and the beauty as effectively as ""Tell It On The Mountain"".  Great cinematography of the trail including perhaps the best footage ever, of Forester Pass.  You're practically there with Scott Williamson, as he makes his approach and ascent of the highest point on the PCT.

This will be considered a masterpiece by anyone who loves the long trails, hiking, and the backcountry.  Job well done!",1400889600,2,796,5.537190082644628

5615752,5,B00BG3YE7K,"Hiked 2,000 miles of the PCT in '11, and this brought back a lot of memories. Was fun to see Donna Saufley out hiking in this, as well as others...if you love hiking, if you've hiked the PCT, going to hike the PCT, have never heard of the PCT, if you think PCT is a drug (actually...),  well...let me sum it up easier:

But it, watch it, pass it on to a friend. You, and they, will be glad you did!

I have an adventure-based non profit I started, and everyone I sponsor that's going to hike the PCT gets this as part of their package. It's that good. :)

It gives an accurate picture of what a thru hike is like, who does this kind of thing and why they do it. It really captures the heart of the experience, in my opinion.

I've sort of lightly thrown out, ""Oh, yeah, I'd like to hike that some day...""  But, no.  Thru-hiking is not for me.  However, I thoroughly enjoyed watching these people make their attempts and will probably end up watching this documentary again...and again.

5615758,5,B00BG3YE7K,"Whats remarkable about this film is its quiet grace. Producer Shaun Carrigan and Director Lisa Diener did not mar the pristine landscape with personal tragedy in order to dramatize the scenery. They did not get lost in the mire of self-hood and sulking, so popular with memoirs these days. Instead, they told deeply personal stories about life outside, keeping their focus on the scenery and the human expressions of delight, fear, pain and happiness.

That took incredible skill. The film touched on many themes: the freedom and beauty that envelopes the very soul and heart of hikers, the sense of individualism and unity that comes with walking alone and with others, and the incredible feeling of being alive and connected to the wild landscape. With only the essentials on your mind and beauty before your eyes, you forget all about the material world with its excess and instead are free to examine yourself, your life and the mountain skyline.

Carrigan and Diener tell great stories here, seven of them, and they effectively enshrine the wilderness as a sacred place and show life on the trail as a spiritual, physical and mental odyssey. This film is a triumph. Bravo.",1391472000,2,1177,4.9393939393939394

We get to follow several different types of hikers (solo, couples, yo-yo) and see the trials they face as well as the joys, sorrows, and amazing views that they encounter.

The music is great, the cinematography is wonderful, and the most important part, the people, are endearing.  From the legendary Billygoat to the intrepid Matt to the newbies, the hikers were a blast to follow along with.",1389139200,,670,4.758620689655173
5615766,5,B00BG3YE7K,"This visually stunning film patched together the stories of passionate hikers doing what they had to do to hike the PCT. These stories told a tale of bravery through vulnerability and connection to both themselves, their loved ones and ultimately to nature that was so inspiring that I've made it a personal mission of mine to do a 24 hour solo hike in 2014 - like Scott says in the film, I want to be ""purified by a hike""... ever so slightly. :)

This was more than a story about hiking, though, it was a story about seeing dreams through to the end, no matter what permutations they may take along the way. I'm still thinking about the kind of passion and drive it took for these hikers to make it across the trail (and back, for some!), and I'm still inspired by all of it.

If you are anything like me, you will alternate between, 'someday I will do that', gazing enviously at the wonderful country, the ambition and the ambition, or 'no, perhaps not!', watching as skin is peeled from feet, blisters cut away, and toenails hacked off.
Beautifully shot and edited, the film-makers were fortunate indeed to pick the right handful of 'stars' for their film. The dichotomy of opinion, the wisdom and the foolishness shine through, as does the sheer doggedness of a bunch of individuals, though very much a strung out community, who decide to walk the length of their country- from Mexico to Canada.
I meant to watch this film in shorter sessions, but it drew me in, only stopping after an hour when my downloaded copy failed. An email was followed by a reply within minutes and a link to a new download. No problems that time, excellent vendor feedback and response.

Documenting the thru-hiking attempts of several different groups of people, the film showcases the amazing views encountered on PCT as well as the day-to-day experience of backpacking including the mundane and the dangerous. Because the film covers the experiences of people of various backgrounds attempting the PCT in various ways, the pace of the film is fast and even carries a bit of suspense as you grow curious about the fate of each of the hikers. As a result the film delivers not just scenic views of the trail but also a meaningful dose of plot that will keep you attentive until the end.

5615780,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I thru-hiked the PCT in 2009 and the experience is one that I've never regretted and that I think about daily even four years later. This documentary successfully captures some of the elements that make thru-hiking a magnet for some but a mystery to most. Because of the obsession a hiker must have to complete a long-distance thru-hike, it is a foreign concept to most people. Thus, any film about a thru-hike of 2650+ miles is going to appear a bit foreign to most observers unless they've been through the trials and victories of a thru-hike attempt.

Despite that inherent obstacle, the producers of this film did a great job of focusing on the daily challenges encountered on the trail--from the physical challenges like the extreme heat and long, waterless stretches in the desert to the never ending mental challenges that begin as soon as you wake up in the morning and realize you've got to cover another 20+ miles on blistered feet after doing the same thing the day before. The most fundamental element to finishing the PCT is a sustained motivation and that varies from hiker to hiker. Some desire to commune with nature, some are running away from demons, some just need a crazy physical/mental challenge, obviously there are others. This film did an exceptional of job of trying to sift through the noise and identifying what makes these people commit to such an intense endeavor.

As it should, the story has a chronological flow. After all, on a northbound PCT thru-hike, you don't get to the High Sierras without first toiling through the 700 miles of Southern California desert. The characters are fantastic and a good mix of PCT lifers (Billygoat, Scott Williamson, the Saufley's) and some new ones like Sauerkraut and Alina who have the vision and done the planning for a successful thru-hike, only to encounter health setbacks out of their control. Through it all, the PCT and the people who hike it tell a story about the human spirit. The personal stories and sources of motivation for the hikers are the strength of this film and aside from an awkward snippet about forest management practices near the end, it recognizes this.

For anyone thinking about hiking the PCT or someone who is just interested in knowing a little bit more about the trail and a lot more about the people who hike it, I highly recommend this film.",1374105600,,2347,4.790123456790123

5615787,5,B00BG3YE7K,"With the popularity of books like Cheryl Strayed's Wild, our curiosity with hiking long trails like the PCT has been piqued. While the PCT used to be known mainly among hard core hikers, now the general populace has at least some awareness of the trail. Tell it on the Mountain takes a close-up look what it's like to hike the 2,600 mile trail.

Rather than tell about the Pacific Crest Trail, this film focused on the experience of the trail. For that, Shaun Carrigan worked with specific couples and individuals with varied backgrounds and perspectives. You feel their nervous excitement as they start the trail at the Mexican border. The joy as they come across a desert water cache diligently hand-carried by caring trail angels. And you walk with them as they become accustomed to the rhythm of life on the trail.

I loved the varied characters of the film. I've read about Scott Williamson before, as he is well known in distance hiking, but I'd never met him. Seeing him on screen gave me insight into what makes him tick. He came across as a very humble, unassuming guy. Well-spoken, and yet driven to hike the PCT faster (and further) than anyone. And... he never filters his water anywhere along the trail. Yep, he's in the ""dip and sip"" camp.

I met Billygoat at the Annual Day Zero Pacific Crest Trail Kick-Off  (better known as ADZPCTKO or simply, ""the Kick-Off"") in Lake Morena earlier this year. He is a John Muir look alike who spends a good part of every year on the PCT, and has seen it change over the years. Case in point -- his stand on those desert water caches might ruffle the feathers of a few other PCT thru-hikers.

The story of Saurkraut and his girlfriend Alina was bittersweet. Imagine saving, planning and preparing for a five month long trip of a lifetime. Saurkraut worked long hours in his home in Germany, while his girlfriend did the same in Spain, knowing that by prudently saving, preparing and planning, they would soon be spending every day together for five months on the PCT. And then... an injury that keeps one of them off the trail. Everyone hiking the PCT knows it could happen, but how do you adjust your plans to deal with it? Their story was a reminder that hiking the PCT requires flexibility. Hiking it is less about reaching a goal and more about the journey.

Tell it on the Mountain is a must-see film for anyone who loves the beauty of our wilderness, the excitement of epic adventure, and the stories of real people on a remarkable journey. The scenery is spectacular, and following the hikers as they make their way toward the Canadian border, you share in their experience, taking in the challenges, the beauty, the heartbreak and the joys along the PCT.",1370736000,,2712,4.627858627858628

""Tell It On the Mountain - Tales from the Pacific Crest Trail"" provides the most complete documentary-style coverage of a thru-hike that we have found. You will follow individual hikers and couples as they trek across the majestic High Sierra of California, enter the slightly less demanding trails of Oregon, and then finally cross the lush forests of Washington as they near the finish just across the Canadian border. We were most impressed by the perseverance of one hiker, who not only went from Mexico to Canada, but also hiked back to Mexico - all in one season!

That's sort of what this film is like.

There have been other documentaries about backpacking, and even about the Pacific Crest Trail itself. But this might be the only one in High Definition, and it would not have been possible without lightweight HD equipment.

Aside from the spectacular scenery captured by HD (available at the film's website for digital download), the compelling narrative and interviews from multiple points of views of various hikers attempting the thru-hike, are priceless snapshots of the human experience along this grand vista of an adventure.

Perhaps this film is exactly what is needed at this moment in time to remind those of us who understand this stuff, and awaken those who do not, what true beauty is in a world ravaged by a species precisely because it has forgotten its natural identity and affinity.",1369094400,,1113,4.78125

5615803,5,B00BG3YE7K,"For those of you who don't know, the Pacific Crest trail is a 2600 mile trail from the Mexican border to the Canadian border, roughly following the highest mountains along the trail. It encompasses weather from blistering hot and dry high deserts of Southern California to traversing glaciers (and permanent snow fields) of the the highest peaks. Some of the trails that make up the PCT are quite famous like the sections in Yosemite.

I've done sections of the PCT in California, but personal health issues and, frankly, the amount of time has always made it impossible. But I've always wanted to see what everyone experienced.

This movie, focused on 7 individuals who attempted the thru hike from Mexico to Canada. The start of the movie sort of introduces each of these people, and gives us their PCT nickname, apparently a tradition of the PCT. The nickname is given to you, and you don't get to choose your own. The movie tell us a bit about the motivations and preparations for each of the seven (although the oldest person, Billy Goat, a legend of the PCT doesn't get as much screen time). The movie follows each of them as they face challenges, get overwhelmed by the vistas, and have personal problems. Sauerkraut (a German who attempts the trail with his girlfriend), for example, has a medical problem of a severe nature.

Even if you don't care about hiking or the outdoors, this movie has some amazing characters, a few of whom personally engage the camera and the viewer. And the photography of those vistas-I cannot say enough. The deserts, mountains, temperate rain forests of the Pacific Northwest, everything is just lovely to behold. I love rewatching the scenes from the Sierras. I just love watching it.

If I could nitpick, the character, Scott, who doesn't have a nickname which would be indicative of his popularity or lack thereof, is a complete jerk. As I watched the movie, every time he appeared, I would get angry because he is one arrogant jerk. (I have actually worse names for him, but I'm keeping it clean.) He is one of the hikers about whom I've read who thinks their way is the right way, despite how bad it goes for him. He doesn't filter water, so he gets all kinds of parasites and bacteria. You NEVER become immune to these things, so every time you ingest one of them, you get sick. And Scott gets very sick. This lowers your ability to hike aggressively, and it could be deadly. Don't listen to him, filter the water. And he tries to save a few grams of weight in his pack by removing the bottom. The results are not going to be good for him. Remember, a thru hiker loses 20-30% of body weight, so worrying about a few grams seems silly. But that's a debate that infests the PCT hiking community, and I probably shouldn't start anything.

I liked that the directors showed him, because he's a fascinating person to me, the type of person I deal with in business and medicine all the time. It's just that Scott is a jerk.

Tell it on the Mountain is an inspiring movie. It is a beautiful movie. It is a passionate movie. And it is one that you could keep on your shelf to watch whenever you want. Maybe it's time for me to plan on hiking it.

Note: I received a pre-release copy of the movie from the Producer several months ago. I decided to watch it for the 4th time (yes 4 times) before writing the review.",1368230400,,3351,4.538079470198675
5615804,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I am nowhere near being a thru hiker.  While I truly appreciate those who do it, I have no desire to join them.  I do, however, love a good documentary.  ""Tell it on the Mountain"" is that and so much more!  The photography is gorgeous. If you have never seen the mountains of California, Oregon and Washington, this film gives you a good idea of what you're missing.  I loved meeting the hikers, and joining them on their adventures.  ""Billy Goat"" I'd heard about before, and it was nice to ""meet"" him face to face. The soundtrack is a wonderful complement to the visual treat.
I have seen a few videos on the PCT, and read a few books written by those who have hiked it. Most recently I read Cheryl  Strayed's ""Wild"" about a woman's solo trek of the PCT.
But perhaps what I liked most about this movie is that you don't have to be a long distance hiker to enjoy it.  It's magnificent scenery and interesting characters draw you in and hold your attention to the extent that when it's over, you're disappointed and want more.  I will watch this one again, and again.

5615807,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I wasn't sure what to think when I sat down to watch this movie.  I had read ""Wild"" by Cheryl Strayed knowing nothing about the PCT.  I had never hiked more than a few miles and never without complaining or drinking a  few beers at the pub after.  Then I heard of this movie.  I'm not even sure how or why.  I had our purchasing department buy it for our library and as soon as it came in, I watched it.

If you're expecting to learn about the trail and how to gear up or train for the most incredible hike you'll ever take, then you're buying the wrong movie.  There are books for that, I hear.  This is a movie that follows five adventurous people 2,663 miles and one insanely amazing man 5,326 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail (and a few others along the way).  When they started making this movie who would know the things that would happen to them on the trail?  Who would know the things that would go on at home that would take them off the trail?  I think this movie is a must-see if you've read Cheryl Strayed book.  I think it's a must-see if you plan to or have ever hiked the PCT.

I had read about this movie and was so excited about it I pre-ordered it.  I am so glad I did!  The scenery is beautifully shot, the music perfectly sets the mood, and the story is woven together seamlessly.  As research for my PCT hike it was great.  I got a real sense of the highs and lows (both literally in elevation and emotionally).  Every hiker's story covered a different experience.  Even if I weren't a hiker this movie would have been enjoyable.  The beauty of this trail and this part of the country is breathtaking and the cinematography really showcases that.  But the real story here isn't the trail or the scenery, it's the pursuit of dreams.  It's incredibly inspiring to follow other people on a journey toward their dream and this film pulls you into these stories immediately.  Whether you're a novice hiker, a seasoned veteran thru-hiker, or just someone looking for some inspiration in the world, this movie will fit the bill.  Watch it, buy it, give it to everyone you know.",1366675200,,1111,4.555555555555555

5615813,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I recently received my copy of Tell It On The Mountain, and overall, I am very happy with it. The case for the disc looks awesome. There is a nice little map of the PCT printed inside the cover with key points highlighted, which is great for those of us that enjoy visuals. As well, it also does an excellent job at displaying the magnitude of the PCT for those that may not be so familiar with it. And as if the map were not enough, there are bullets that break the information down a bit more. Very nice!

As far as the movie, it is of the same, high quality. The footage shot looks great on my big screen tv. The picture is very clear, and the commentary is just as clear. The live footage is even of high quality, which is nice. Other than the quality of the picture itself, the film is filled with passion. As I followed the small group of hikers along the PCT, I was able to gain a to-the-heart type of perspective. Hiking a long trail is no easy task, but it is not simply the physical aspect of the hike that makes it rough, but also the mental aspect, and may be more so. This film does a great job at pointing out all the ups and downs of a long hike.

I think that Lisa & Shaun have done an outstanding job with this film. I would recommend it for everyone, not just hikers. I have heard others say that this is a great film to show families, or friends, of hikers, so that they can get an idea of what the hiker is really going out to do, and I agree whole-heart-idly. There is a truth in this that is not found in just any movie, but it is one that I think we can all relate to one way or another. This film is about living our dreams, and despite that this particular dream is about hiking the PCT, I feel like it can help inspire us all to go for our dreams, no matter what they are.

2 thumbs up.

After watching Tell it on the Mountain all I have to do is hand them this wonderful documentary of the Pacific Crest Trail. I have watched it twice in the last week. My next hike will be the PCT. If anyone cant figure out why the trail family you make on the trail becomes so important in your life off the trail. They need to watch this movie. If you have friends that don't understand why you hike the trails. They need to watch this movie. If you know someone that whats to hike a long distance hike. They  need to watch this movie.

5615815,5,B00BG3YE7K,"This documentary was filmed the year that I first attempted to hike the PCT. Watching it the other day took me back to that life changing summer and allowed me to 'revisit' some of my friends and my beloved trail.

Out on the PCT we would sometimes say, ""It doesn't always have to be fun to be fun."" The struggles and pains that the featured hikers go through is common to all of us that walk the long trails, though the details are different for each of us. This film does a fantastic job of letting the viewer ""get in the head"" of the hikers and experience the emotional and physical highs and lows. Seeing Donna Saufley, Billy Goat, Scott Williamson, and my good friends Jackalope and EagleEye on their journey made me recall in vivid memory (and a few tears) the grand adventure that setting out north on the PCT is.

If you are an armchair traveller, this will almost let you feel the heat, rain, snow, sun, wind, mosquitoes, blisters, and joy of hiking the PCT. If you are thinking of hiking the PCT, this will inspire and motivate you. If you are a former PCT hiker, this will take you back and make you want to quit your job and go hiking again!

Thanks for making this movie!!!!

WARNING: watching this movie may result in months spent on a long trail being dirty, tired, sore, hungry, and totally and completely happy and at peace.",1366588800,,1341,4.417004048582996
5615816,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I own, and enjoy, many of the ""thru-hiking"" genre of DVD's.  I have several that cover the Appalachian Trial, a couple about the Continental Divide Trail, and several of the Pacific Crest Trail.  I have also watched many You Tube type video trips from the Pacific Crest Trail.  Additionally, I own and read many books about all of the above.  My own hiking experience does not include those trails, but I have section-hiked the Idaho Centennial Trail, which is equal to the PCT in length through Washington and Oregon.  And I have crafted some of my own video vignettes about my experiences.  I have said ALL OF THE ABOVE to set up my review of ""Tell it on the Mountain.""  I'm very familiar with the Pacific Crest Trail ""thru-hike"" story, albeit vicariously (in other words, I have only experienced it through others' eyes).  So, perhaps I was expecting ""just another"" hiking DVD.  It was worth the wait to receive my pre-ordered copy of ""Tell it on the Mountain.""  Even though I am a night shift worker, I stayed up way past my bedtime in the morning to watch the DVD.  I was spellbound.  This is one of the most well-edited hiking movies I've ever seen.  In fact, I had to watch all of the extra features the next morning.  And after my last night shift, I had to watch the movie again!  I'm now wondering how it will look on my big screen TV.  I've only seen it so far on my 23"" computer screen.  It should translate well to the big screen.  The creators of this film have captured a great balance between the chief character, the PCT itself in all its glory, and the characters who attempt to thru-hike it.  I enjoyed all the character interviews.  In particular, I enjoyed following the story of Scott Williamson on his PCT Yo-Yo.  He was someone I have seen snippets about in other videos.  I knew some of his back story (he survived an armed robbery and a gunshot wound to the face).  It was heartening to hear him in his own words and see the comeback story he has made of his life by walking the PCT so many times.  Great video, I highly recommend it!

5615818,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I have seen pretty much all of the documentaries about America's long trails. Although I have enjoyed most of them, I've found that they are generally either targeted to experienced hikers only, with little background information for the uniformed viewer OR they are so surface level that only someone totally unfamiliar with long distance hiking could possibly find them worthwhile. Tell it on the Mountain strikes the perfect balance. There's enough general information, stunning scenery and plot development to appeal to anyone with the vaguest interest in hiking and the outdoors. Folks more familiar with the Pacific Crest Trail will love the extended interviews with hiking legends, Scott Williamson and Billy Goat and of course trail angel extraordinaire, Donna Saufley. The film is also more professionally done than many of its counterparts.

5615821,5,B00BG3YE7K,"""Tell it on the Mountain--Tales from the Pacific Crest Trail"" is about real people doing an extraordinary thing--thru-hiking the PCT. It tells their stories well, and it shows us some of the tremendous diversity and magnificent beauty of this national scenic trail. I was sent a complimentary copy of this DVD by the producer, Shaun Carrigan, and because I love hiking and the PCT, I looked forward to watching it. My eager anticipation was well rewarded--this is a delightful documentary.

I have hiked the entire PCT, but as a section-hiker. Section hiking--doing segments of the trail--has its challenges, but it also has some benefits. Once major difference is that section hikers can pick and choose which part of the trail to do according to their time available and they can head for the section that sounds most appealing during that time--the desert in the spring when the wildflowers are in bloom, the Sierra in the late summer when the snow is gone and the creeks are passable.

On the other hand, thru-hikers have to deal with the relatively short season for hiking the entire 2,650 miles of the PCT; their decisions are largely dictated by the weather and trail conditions through the southern California deserts, and through the Sierra and Cascade mountains. To make it within the usual 5-month time frame, most begin their journey at the Mexican border in late April/early May and travel through the southern California deserts as things are really heating up. They start working through the Sierra at a time when the snowpack is still deep in places and some of the streams have turned into raging rivers. They get into Oregon, where their pace quickens as the terrain becomes easier, but often when the mosquitoes are at their worst. Then they cross into Washington with 500 miles to go and mid-way through the state notice that the days are growing shorter and a nip is in the air. Most try to cross over the Canadian border by late September/early October, but as we know, weather conditions are variable and it's not unheard of that a thru-hiker's attempt is cut short only a few miles from the northern terminus.

""Tell it on the Mountain--Tales from the Pacific Crest Trail"" brings us the stories of a half-dozen of these amazing backpackers. You meet an engaged couple planning to get married while on the trail; a second couple forced to deal with a serious medical emergency; Scott Williamson, who has ""yo-yo"" hiked the trail (gone border to border and then back again) twice and set various speed records; and the legendary ""Billy Goat"" who says he will only stop hiking the PCT when he can no longer walk. We also meet ""trail angel"" Donna Saufley on the trail. Donna and her husband Jeff play host to hundreds of PCT hikers at their home in Agua Dulce each year.

The hikers may have different motivations for hiking the PCT and they may start out in different states of readiness, but they all have a passion for the trail. That's an important thing, because as ""Tell it on the Mountain"" so beautifully shows us--thru-hiking the PCT takes a huge amount of both physical and emotional strength. Highly recommended!",1365552000,,3141,4.821892393320964

Many movies glamorize a thru-hike with out showing that it is, unquestionably, very difficult. This movie does an absolutely outstanding job of showcasing not only the beauty and relationships, but also the ups and downs that thru-hiking the Pacific Crest Trail entails. The first hand depiction is told through a few different hikers point of view, while still keeping it easy to follow.

5615824,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I received an advance copy of this wonderful DVD, free in exchange for writing a review of it.  I'm not sure I can come up with words that do justice to the beauty and emotion captured on this film.  This is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen, and when it ended, I felt I actually knew the people we follow on the PCT.

The film follows two couples and four single hikers as they walk along the 2,650 miles of trail, passing through desert, forests, rivers, snow, thunderstorms, forest fires and mountain peaks, on their way from Mexico to Canada. They came from all over the world to try to realize their dream of ""through hiking"" the entire length of the trail.  They adopt ""trail names"" and strike up friendships with each other and the many ""trail angels"" who provide them food, water and support along the way.

Among the most memorable characters is Billygoat - 66 years old and having logged over 50,000 miles on the PCT.  Another hiker, Scott Williamson, holds the record for the most yo-yo hikes - going from Mexico to Canada and back in one season.  The others are no less memorable, as we are privy to their struggles and triumphs along the way. During the hike, one person faces a serious medical issue, one couple gets married, and all of them discover themselves as their life is reduced to the belongings they can carry in their backpack and they are forced to call upon strength and courage they didn't know they had.  All of them, in one way or another, discover the meaning of life - their life.

The panoramic scenes of nature are endlessly breathtaking and the background music is perfectly matched with the mood of the film.  No one will be able to watch this film without feeling the seductive call of the PCT and wondering if they have what it takes to through-hike it.

I especially liked the end of the film, where we are given updates on the lives of each of the hikers after their return to their pre-hike life.  All of them agreed that after hiking the PCT their lives will never be the same again.",1364169600,,2036,4.472972972972973
5615825,5,B00BG3YE7K,"Wow. We are a family of 'hikers' but nothing in comparison to the thru hikers followed for months in this movie.

We live on the east coast just miles from the Appalachian Trail, about 2,200 miles of hiking from Georgia to Maine. I've walked portions of it during a day trip but can't imagine walking 20-40 miles a day for months.

Tell it on the Mountain is about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail from (literally) the Mexico border to the Canadian border, approximately 2,600 miles of rough and difficult terrain sometimes in 100+ degree heat and sometimes in snow. You carry everything you need on your back, unless you find a trail angel to replenish fresh water and other supplies. Or you have a loved one who will drive additional supplies to a pick-up point.

The movie follows a set of hikers, some couples, some individuals, as their journey begins and their dreams are stretched out in front of them. They have saved for a long time, some have traveled from other countries, and all have set their sights on completing this trek for a long time. With anticipation, determination and skill, they set forth. We see the good, the bad and the nasty - worn out feet, thick blisters and peeling skin, deep cracks and other gross body issues along with beautiful imagery and great camaraderie.

The scenery is spectacular and gives us a glimpse into the beauty of the west coast that many don't get a chance to witness. The pace of the movie is just enough to let you savor the moments, get to know the hikers, and get a sense of the length of the walk while keeping you waiting for the next obstacle or the next goal point for each hiker. There is a nice balance in the amount of screen time for each hiker.

Our travelers walk about 20 miles a day, with the exception of one hiker, Scott Williamson, who is determined to walk the full PCT to Canada and back again to Mexico without a break. He turns in an incredible 40 miles a day on infected toes (we see that as well) and a sometimes sick body. But I won't tell you if he makes it all the way.

There are moments where some of their dreams may go unfulfilled, things get in the way, bodies fail, time runs out. But they all push through as best as they can.

My 8 year-old daughter, 13 year-old son and husband all sat transfixed to watch the entire movie. It is compelling and captivating till the end.

I was provided a copy of the movie to watch and provide an honest review.",1364169600,2,2433,4.403118040089087
5615826,4,B00BG3YE7K,"I immediately liked this documentary from the start but by the time I was done viewing it I was in love.

""Tell it on the Mountain"" is a documentary that captures the motivation, unwavering determination, and personal setbacks of several hikers who embark on a five-month wilderness journey along the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT).

The PCT is a 2,663 mile footpath extending from the Mexican to Canadian Border. The two other major US trails are the Appalachian Trail (AT) and the Continental Divide Trail (CDT). Part of the PCT traverses the Sierras which are both beautiful and treacherous. The scenery captured in these parts is both captivating and sometimes scary.

The hikers profiled are from various backgrounds and countries.  Some travel solo and others travel as a pair including a couple who hiked to their wedding. Most of the trekkers thru (one way) hike but one hiker does a yo-yo (round-trip) hike.  The hikers in many cases document their own journey, travelling with the camera affixed to them as they walk.  Although some of the filming is shaky as a result, at times it made the experience more real and I often felt as if I were tagging along in the scene.

These hikers are motivated to hike the PCT for many reasons.  For some it may be to reach a lofty goal and for others it may be to get the weight of the world off their shoulders.  One reason Inaki, the Spanish fellow, hikes is because ""It's much better to go for something and realize that you were wrong, than not knowing at all if you were wrong or right.""  I could not agree more;  after all, what is life if all you have are regrets?

The film left me so energized that I had trouble sleeping last night. It roused my adventurous nature and I began reliving my 2005 journey to Antarctica and that trip's Shackleton walk.  It also brought back memories of my time in camp as a teenager in the early 70's when, on several occasions, I overnight hiked the Sussex County portion of the AT with just a sleeping bag for protection. It was during my AT hikes that I developed a dream to hike the entire AT. Although I never did that thru hike and probably never will, this film certainly rekindled that desire.

In summary, ""Tell it on the Mountain"" gives a glimpse of what motivates a handful of adventurous hikers to go on this long journey surrounded by nature and relying mostly on their own fortitude to live the simplest of existence for part of one year.

POSTSCRIPT:  I received a review copy of this documentary from the producer and I found the pre-release version of the film to be very close to five stars.  For those who are interested in a more in-depth understanding of one person's motivation to hike the PCT, I recommend reading&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-From-Lost-to-Found-on-the-Pacific-Crest-Trail-Oprah-s-Book-Club-2-0/dp/0307592731/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail (Oprah's Book Club 2.0)</a>.

UPDATE March 23, 2013 - I watched this film again but this time with my boyfriend. He gives it five stars and feels it's a quality production.  He actually stayed up late to watch it and did not fall asleep like he usually does when watching videos so I know he enjoyed it as did I a second time around.",1363824000,,3294,4.839572192513369
5615827,5,B00BG3YE7K,"Commitment - a term we banter about in relationship to many cloud bourne ideas - but commitment is something this gratifying film by director Lisa Diener is all about. It is not a film to review or to describe - it is a film to experience.

The two hours of this movie details the 2600+ miles of the Pacific Coast Trail that hikers committed to experiencing nature and getting in touch with survival and solitude witness yearly.  Some are repeaters, some are newcomers, and in this film we get to know a group of these people from all over the world and follow them through the course of the hike. The hike begins at the border between Mexico and California (Campo) and proceeds through to Agua Dulce, Kennedy Meadows, Mt Whitney, Forrester Pass, Yosemite, Lake Tahoe, Mt Lassen, Mt Shasta, then into Oregon through Crater Lake, Three Sisters Wilderness and Mt Hood, and then into Washington at Cascade Locks, Goat Rocks Wilderness, Mt Rainier, Snoqualamie Pass and finally to the border of Washington and Canada at Manning Park.

The hikers walk with back packs carrying food and water at a rate of approximately 20 miles per day and the entire hike takes 5 months to complete. The hikers are caller Thru-Hikers - a brand of hikers that are not just casual walkers but committed spirits who gain more from the adventure than words can express. Along the way they encounter Trail Angels (people who give them shelter and nourishment and encouragement in exchange for the dazzling stories of the adventures of struggling through the wild).  There are places known as Hiker Heaven where friends of the hikers can mail supplies to help the hikers on their journey.

The many joys of watching this film are appreciating the beauty of nature (`Set design by Mother Nature') and hearing the response of the hikers as they fully appreciate and experience daybreak and nightlight and the gloaming. The photography is breathtakingly beautiful and the accompanying music is fitting for life in the wild.

Perhaps few of us would be able to endure the full hike, but it is a joy to live it through the warmly friendly Thru-Hikers who reintroduce us to the magnificence of nature. This film is food for the soul - restorative, nourishing and inspiring.  Grady Harp, March 13",1363478400,14,2262,4.799485861182519

5615838,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I love documentaries for the way in which they can immerse you in the reality of a situation. Such is the case for this great film ""Tell it on the Mountain"" which chronicles the adventures of a disparate group of intrepid adventureres as they ""thru-hike"" the Pacific Crest Trail; a journey of 2,663 miles.

To be honest, I was unfamiliar with the term ""thru-hike"" before watching this film. It refers to hiking the entire end-to-end length of a designated hiking trail in a single trip. The Pacific Crest Trail is one of many well-known, lengthy, trails. The Appalachin Trail and the Continental Divide Trail are two other epic trails in the United States.

What makes this particular hike so daunting is that you must complete the hike within a certain time otherwise winter snows will make the hike dangerous and next to impossible.

Replete with stunning imagery of spectacular scenery as well as close-ups of oozing blisters and in-grown toenails, this film folllows the thru-hike trek from the points of view of the numerous hikers chronicled in this adventure. The story begins as each character is revealed by means of a short self-introduction. With colorful nick-names such as ""Billygoat"", Eagle Eye"" and ""Jackalope"" you immediately develop an interest in each persons story.

You really develop a kinship with some of the characters as they reveal bits and pieces of themselves as the adventure unfolds. You share in their successes, their agonies, their fears and the surprises they experience along the way.

I can't imagine the hours of editing that must have been done to complete this film. It is apparent that each hiker that was part of the film carried their own camcorder to document various parts of their journey and these snippets were integrated into the film. Because of that fact, certain portions of the film are a little jerky and not as well-polished as other parts. But that comes with the territory of a documentary film and if anything simply adds to the authenticity of the story.

I was totally engrossed with this film from start to finish. The narration, background music and cinematography was all very good.

I was provided a review copy of the DVD by the producer of the film.",1363478400,,2214,4.888

The stories of the hikers are fascinating, and the cinematography is beautiful, and in places breathtaking. The way the filmmakers have edited it these stores together creates a marvelous narrative that involves you deeply in the lives of each of the hikers, making you feel like you're hiking along with them.

Through-hikers, whether on the Pacific Coast Trail, the Appalachian Trail, or elsewhere are a unique breed. It takes a lot of resolve, self reliance, and independence of spirit to walk away from your regular life for the four to six months it takes to walk the trail, and yet 300 attempt it and 180 finish it every near, according to the Parks Service. I'm a hiker, but I used to consider a 30 mile trip around Isle Royale a major expedition. The hikers who complete the PCT walk over twenty-five hundred miles- 2,663, to be exact. That's dedication. And just about every one who completes it finds it a transformative experience. Some keep hiking it over and over, like one 66 year old hiker featured in this film.

For those planning to through-hike the PCT, this film is a must. It's also a must for anyone who enjoys hiking in the wilderness, whether on the PCT or elsewhere, be they marathoners or simply day hikers. But the potential audience for the film isn't limited to hikers and nature fans.

It tells the stories of three individual hikers and two couples as they attempt this demanding hike.  The scenery is magnificent.  The hikers' stories make it interesting.  By the end, anyone interested in hiking the PCT should know whether they want to accept the challenge.  Anyone interested in backpacking in general should know whether they want to take the next step.",1363219200,,453,5.1506849315068495
5615841,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I don't watch many movies, but this one was quite captivating. I do a lot of hiking myself but have never been on the PCT. The views you see through the eyes of the hikers is quite breathtaking, and even if you're not a hiker yourself you should do yourself a favor and purchase this film. It lets you in on a world few know about but many more should.

Can't wait until the digital download version is available!",1363219200,,413,4.227848101265823
5615842,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I can't say enough about this film. Just watching these hikers go through their highs and lows is a life changing experience in itself.  I always gauge how good a movie is by how I feel when I'm done watching it, and this goes up there with some of my all time favorites because I was so moved, touched and inspired by this movie.  These people are so brave and strong, and seeing all they go through for those seconds-long-moments of happiness and feeling of oneness with nature must make their journey all worth it.  The greatest parts to watch was when a hiker would get that feeling of complete oneness with nature which is only possible when you are so far away from civilization in an area that is untouched by the modern world.  Gosh I'm almost getting teary-eyed just writing this review.  This movie inspires me to reach beyond what I know I am capable of because these hikers are proof that anything is possible when you have the will and tenacity. Another thing I wanted to point out was how entertaining it was for a documentary. Don't get me wrong I love learning something from a non-fiction piece, but usually I shy away from documentaries because they are too serious and drawn out, but this movie has a great pace and I never felt like I wanted to turn it off because it was boring. If anything I wish there were more movies about the great trails in the U.S. and abroad, as long as they are done like this.  I like how I didn't feel I was watching 60 minutes like I usually do with documentaries especially documentaries about nature, in Tell it on the Mountain I felt like I was watching an POV adventure film.  This review is getting long so I'll try to wrap it up, like I said I can't say enough about this documentary, but I just have to add one more thing that I like which is that I really like how the filmmaker gave the hikers their own cameras. I feel like these moments were where the hikers were most honest because they were alone making a video diary. I feel like there are too many times in reality TV or documentaries where you don't get a true sense of the emotions because people put on their Made-for-TV face and aren't authentic. All I gotta say is Bravo and when are the documentaries about the Appalachian Trail and the Continential Divide Trail coming out ; )",1363219200,2,2299,4.382629107981221
5615843,5,B00BG3YE7K,Tell it on the Mountain is a quick moving and inspirational documentary. I encourage any who get the chance to see it. I'm saddened that at this point it's unavailable on Amazon.,1363046400,,178,4.59375
5615844,5,B00BG3YE7K,"If we are to hear the old spiritual song, go tell it on the mountain, then we must finish the line and ask about salvation.  This is a documentary, not about a trail, but about how we hike through life.  Instead of salvation being born in a nativity scene washing away sins, we walk away from all the distractions from life and salvation is found in the simplicity of life and acceptance of the trials put in forth to us.

As the movie opens to the sound of water, a baptism of sorts at the Mexican Border.  We are introduced to cast of pilgrims.  It is not a documentary about the trail; the beauty of the movie is in the way the people open up to the camera.  I found myself constantly lost in looking at the way the shots were created.  How these amazing people were willing to open their hearts to a camera for all of us to share in their experiences and hardships as they struggled to tackle something in life.  This movie is not a documentary about a specific trail; it is more about how we find direction in life.  The tidbits of advice from the old sage throughout add to this feeling that there are no peaks, there is no finish line, there is just your life in front of you, each step you take the most important step at that moment.  This is a movie about pilgrimage and salvation.

The various time-lapse shots of the trail throughout add to this feeling that time is not real.  No documentary can ever grasp the time of walking over 2,000 miles, or twice that even.  But the movie is not about the trail, it is about us as humans and I found this to be intriguing.  In this documentary, it reflects into our own lives about how we walk these paths and how we rise up the struggles that might have us feel like we fail.  In the years of teaching people to backpack I have always said that some people hike towards a destination and some are always there.  In some ways, this is a story about Sisyphus and the boulders pushed up mountains.  There is no climactic end, except to end back where you began.

This movie makes a great companion piece to the Cheryl Strand's account on the PCT.  Every year, hundreds of people take this break from their life, they stop the daily grind, to go to the mountain and see what comes out.  It is a walking meditation, a pilgrimage to holy lands to come back with understanding.  There was nothing romantic about this.  It was real, with blisters and toenails, frustrations and elations.  What we learn is that if you don't go to the mountain to find something holy and divine, you find something true about you that you always had inside of you.  Rather than listen to what the mountain will tell you, it is a sounding board for the things inside of you waiting to get out.

In the end, I think we are meant to take away that salvation is found on the trail.  The PCT is not about the end, but the journey.  If we are to hear the angels' chorus, it is found in the wind through fir and pine trees.  The holy light that shines down from the heaven is our miraculous sun.  Salvation is with each step we make, and I really enjoyed that about this documentary.",1363046400,,3105,4.2778730703259
5615845,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I am not much for ""documentary"" films, but this is a exception. They found out I have always wanted to do the whole Pacific Crest trail (I have only done a couple of short sections), so sent me a copy for review, and I am so glad they did.

We follow an interesting mlange of characters as they attempt to ""through hike"" the ""PCT"" as everyone calls it. We get involved with their ""ups & downs"" , not to mention their exhilaration and sad moments. While we are `along for the walk"" we get treated to some of the most beautiful scenery on earth.

The PCT is a nearly 2700 mile trial from Mexico to Canada, mostly in California. It starts in the desert and goes through the snow.

The producers picked a great assortment of characters here, from newbies to yearly hikers, including some ""trail angels'- those wonderful folks who may not hike so much, but make their home or even just their water available for tired, thirsty hikers.

Warning- if you watch this film you may find yourself on the start of a very long walk next year!

One small technical quibble- only part of the film is captioned, there is no closed captioning option I could find.

A interesting companion read to this great film would be ""Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail"".",1363046400,,1258,4.447826086956522
5615846,5,B00BG3YE7K,"I'm no hiker, let alone a through hiker. I watched this documentary because my hiking/outdoorsy/cooler than I friend wouldn't stop talking about it. The characters in the film are fascinating and perplexing all at once. I mean, who does this? Who thinks, ""I'm going to hike for the next several months in lonely, painful, and often dangerous conditions""?. After watching the film, I understand my friend's love of thru-hiking- the scenery, being isolated in the wilderness, the battle within oneself to keep going...it was very inspiring. Much to my surprise I left the showing with the feeling that, I too, could attempt such a hike with the right mindset (not that I ever will). The film is well done and really should be seen on a big screen to do the majesty of the wilderness justice.",1363046400,,789,4.8088235294117645
5615847,4,B00BG3YE7K,I love to hike.  My first thought was this is juts another hiking film with pretty scenery.  Boy was I surprised.  Tell It on the Mountain brought me into the everyday life of a long-distance hiker on the PCT.  As the film follows the adventures of several hikers you want to get outthere and join them.  It does a great job od tellings the story of hiker's trails and trbiulations as wel as the glory of the hike.  I gve this two thumbs up.,1363046400,,441,4.190476190476191
8567896,3,B00BG3YE7K,"The whole premise is cool, the people and their stories are very interesting, now, this movie was poorly shot and poorly edited and the soundtrack is just not good at all, it's a 2013 movie but it seems like it's from the early 90's, the post production team wasted an otherwise good opportunity to make a nice movie.
Get ready for some shaky footage, out of frame and out of focus, extreme close ups, it's very uncomfortable to watch. And it's pretty expensive as well, it should've been made available for free or maybe U$.99. If you want to watch a couple of excellent documentary movies about the PCT, go to YouTube and type ""As it Happens: Pacific Crest Trail"" and also ""Only the Essential"", both are free and very good, masterfully crafted accounts of the journey on the trail.",1495152000,,783,4.6
