8116323,3,B000F1IO48,"I am excited by how the Pitbull image has changed in recent years to suits but this material is from several years ago and it is kinda decadent with loads of aggressive, lost youth for starters. It's cousin to gangster rap. I couldn't make sense out of it all in a way. I wanted to relax that the culture was exclusive to Miami only but I am sure the momentum makes its way through the latin influenced regions of the south arguably. It's a seriously grimmey type of film where half in the film are plain drab and dishoveled or loaded with foul language and the others are beautiful females built to please the sleazy eye.
On a positive note Pitbull's class pulls through and perhaps what is significant is his ability to be in control and without one hint of dark despair that fame can cause. He remains solid and appears to be able to navigate the complex world of people, success and all the trappings with a great big smile as well.",1344470400,,936,4.385057471264368
