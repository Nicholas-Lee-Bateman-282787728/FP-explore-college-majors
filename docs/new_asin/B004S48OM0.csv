8439458,5,B004S48OM0,I bought it a few years ago and it changed my thinking on debt completly. It also made me realise that God does not intend for us to be stressed down with the burden of debt. Even small debt gets you. I have bought this set for a friend as well. I watch it now and then to refresh my memory,1454371200,,290,3.7704918032786887

8439460,5,B004S48OM0,"I finally found this seminar for our house hold and to fellowship with others. I have been following the Duggar's since they had 14 or 15 children and were on the Discovery Channel first. I wanted to know how they became debt free and stay debt free. I wanted to know where they learned their financial knowledge from. After hearing their story, I wanted our household to be financially free as well. My great grand parents and both of my grand mothers are financially fit and free from debt. I was free once and somehow fell into the trap of debt.

This seminar starts off with Mr. Sammons telling his story of how he fell into debt and how he begin to get his self out of debt, which is very informative. He goes over his convictions with the decisions he had made in life and how he learned to follow God's principles. He tells how one man spent more time working two jobs to pay for the large home and lifestyle he was leading which in return took more of his time away from his family. This Seminar is like taking a class and is not fast pace.

Looking at the Duggar's reminded me of how my great grandparents lived, they were free and did not owe anyone anything. They were financially fit and raised more than 13 children on the maternal side of my mom's family and on the paternal side of my mom's family my great grandparents were also free and raised more than eight children. On my father's maternal side of the family, my grandmother did not have mortgage or car note and I did not know of any debt she had.

I wanted that same freedom and peace of mind for our house hold. So we started on our financial freedom journey with the way we were raised to stay out of debt and then we came across Dave Ramsey and added his way to our process of getting out of debt and staying out of debt. How ever when we were finally able to find Jim Sammons Financial Freedom DVD at an affordable price were made the purchase.

Our children will also view this and be sent off with a great deal of financial knowledge. Jim Sammons's Financial Freedom is refreshing and full of biblical ways with examples to free yourself from debt and to build our life on the principles of God.

We also use Dave Ramsey and some of Crown Financial Ministries. All are Christian materials. How ever anyone will be blessed by any of these financial materials.

We are taking our time going though this seminar because it is so informative. We do recommend this seminar you will learn so much from this seminar. We follow along with our New King James Bible for the scripture he reads and refers to which does line up with the word of God. He tells many stories/examples of how men were successful but did not apply God's principles/honor God and fell. The stories are of men of the bible and his business stories or other business stories of people who did not do things God's why and violated God's reproofs. This DVD set will refresh you and have you in line with what God's says about your finances and how God wants you to handle your finances.

We found this set used and we thank God for blessing us with this seminar at an affordable price. We will update our review as we go.
