6160948,3,B00HF95PA4,"I agree with many other reviewers past and present, film the girls not the audience. Lovely young talented women, but miss the original ensemble. I felt the New Journey DVD was by far the best, seems the shows are getting weaker as each new one comes out.",1393459200,5,255,4.446808510638298
6160949,3,B00HF95PA4,"When I buy a ticket for a show like Celtic Woman, I get the best seat I can, and when I say ""best seat"" I mean `one where I can watch the performers with as little distraction or visual strain as can be achieved'.  But whether I sit in the first row, or in the balcony I have one and only one reason for buying the ticket. ""I want to see the performers perform!"" The video editors for Celtic Woman have decided that we are missing out on something if we don't get periodic doses of video of the audience, even while the girls are right in the middle of a song. It isn't enough to just pan the audience in between songs; the video editors are convinced that we need a visual confirmation of what the people in the audience are doing ALL THROUGH THE SHOW! Even if we can already hear the audience clapping, that's not good enough; they have to provide visual proof. I know there are those who say `seeing is believing' but for me ... when I hear people clapping I don't need visual proof. And further adding to the imprudence, is the incredible number of times they do it. It wasn't just once or twice (in a limited way) but dozens and dozens of times! I counted 89 times in the main show alone that they did it, and ... some of these shots are more than just a second or two. Probably 70% of the shots were clapping or smiling, but there were others with people singing and even several of a 5 year old girl dancing! What a treat that was! [The camera coverage she got made me wonder if it might be the video editor's daughter.]
Now let me reiterate ... when I say clapping, I'm not talking about the applause between song selections; that is absolutely fine. What I'm talking about is people simply clapping and/or singing to the music or even worse ... in some shots they are not doing anything but `just plain staring'. Now by a show of hands ... who among you ... go to a concert to sit and watch the people sitting around you, sing and clap to the music? That's right ... we don't go to watch the audience, we want to see the people on stage.
These `garbage shots' of the audience were not as frequently used in this show as the last Christmas show that Celtic Woman did, but for some reason that I can't explain, it was more annoying in this show. Something else that I find confusing is that 3 of the songs were pristine, not contaminated by any of the video adulteration. But then on the other hand ... even the bonus song selections were ruined with the same video junk, so I have no explanation for the songs that were not `doctored'.
As for the concert itself ... I need some Prozac to overcome my disappointment. I was all psyched up for a lively new program. Their last tour had so many emotionally depressing songs that I figured it would be impossible for this one not to be far more `positive' and therefore exciting. NO SUCH LUCK! What we got is a trip down memory lane. There is hardly a song in the show that they haven't done before (although it wasn't always the same singers singing them). Additionally, when they were done before, they were done so beautifully that it's crazy to think they could do them as well again. A perfect example of this dilemma is the song Caledonia. When Lisa Kelly sang Caledonia she sang it like she `lived it'! Susan McFadden has an absolutely wonderful voice and she's a real charmer, but it was a mistake to let her sing a song which had already been preformed perfectly (by another Celtic Woman).
I'm sure that not everyone agrees with my viewpoint of this show and I respect that. We are all individuals and we all have are own opinions, likes, and dislikes. I can only tell you what my feelings are about the presentation. Unquestionably many of you will TOTALLY disagree with me. But ... hopefully you will respect my honesty. I really expected something new and wonderful, and I didn't get it.
Quite honestly, I hope everyone likes the show because these girls are extremely talented, and anything they sing is worth listening to, but `personally' ... I felt cheated because there are other songs that they could have sung just as magnificently. Why did they give us a rerun?

6160950,4,B00HF95PA4,"I was not as well pleased with this DVD as I have been with the previous ones.  This one is strictly a low budget or economy approach.  There is no large orchestra, only a small band which does not appear to be led by anyone.  The large chorus has been replaced with only four singers. David Downes appears in only one song.  The blu-ray video presentation is excellent, however, the audio content leaves a lot to be desired.  It is definitely not up to blu-ray quality.  The girls are beautiful as usual, it is a shame they don't sound that way.",1393286400,29,546,4.356435643564357

6160969,5,B00HF95PA4,"I have never heard of this group until I was looking for a different genre for my playlist. They are AWESOME!! Three women singers and the fourth plays the violin.  They exude beauty, energy, and above all, talent! I am a former singer myself,  and I can tell you they sing like something  out of heaven.  Their voices blend perfectly and their costumes are fabulous. The energy on stage as they move around the stage,  gowns flowing behind them, seems effortless. Yet,  I know it takes a lot  energy and stamina to perform like that.
Pros: awesome singing, fabulous wardrobe.  Wonderful backup singers,  including a choir (at times), and bagpipes. A true Celtic experience! I  would highly recommend this DVD and others.
Cons: None.",1489449600,,733,4.838709677419355

6161010,5,B00HF95PA4,"Wonderful new show from the beautiful singers of Celtic Woman.  This show introduces a new voice, Mairead Carlin, who has a much different sound than many of the former and current singers.  Hers is a rich and resonant Alto which is gorgeous without any backup.  She is also lovely to look at.  This is a simply produced performance.  The setting is a small theatre filled with tables and a simple stage.  Looks more like a nightclub performance than their usual grandiose settings (castles, great estates, or large orchestra halls).  I appreciated the more intimate surroundings of this setting, and the greater attention to the voices of the singers.  Here they are without a full orchestra, without a chorus of singers, and without spectacular visuals.  Here is simply, four Celtic women.  A lovely concert in a quiet thoughtful new production.",1471305600,,847,5.028776978417266

You can get most of these on You-Tube (most in a lesser quality), but nothing compares to this. Now, all I want is to find ""Believe"" on Blu-ray.

6161141,5,B00HF95PA4,"Personally, this kind of music drives me up the wall, making me want to grit my teeth! but two of my adult children are enamored by things Celtic and  LOVE it; hence, the five stars.  I'm sure they would have the same reaction if they had to suffer through Bach fugues and the clashing music of John Cage (although his ""Five Minutes of Silence"" wasn't too bad, even though the audience didn't realize that they were the ""music.) :->

I'm  certain they would be equally glad that they don't have to listen to Verdi,and to operetta and the like.  Although I do enjoy the majestic skirling of The Great  Highland Pipe and Highland tattoos and the like; in general, Celtic music drives me crazy.  (I HATED ""Riverdance!!!)

Celtic music downright irritates me.  It would be like asking my kids to suffer through an evening of  Bach fugues or the clashing music of John Cage (although his ""Five Minutes of Silence wasn't bad.)  :->

I do not like the harsh singing of today, sung with angry faces. These were lyrical songs, sung with smiles. They were songs I haven't heard before, except for Danny Boy and Amazing Grace which, like the rest, were rendered superbly. It is nice to see that the women did not cover their faces with cosmetics. Some reviewers disliked seeing the enthusiastic crowds so much. They added to my enjoyment.
 I especially enjoyed the violinist who played beautifully sometimes with slow grace sometimes with remarkable speed. I liked the way she danced around flittingly with smiles like an exotic imp having fun. She bent, crouched, twirled, leaned, ran, jumped, and stretched out her arms and legs. It is no surprise that she is the thinnest of the four women.",1417564800,,894,4.920529801324503

Also very dissapointing was when the show was on PBS it included the song ""Orinoco Flow"" which is one of my favourites. It is nowhere to be found on the concert DVD itself or in the bonus CD/DVD. I had bought the CD/DVD pack first & then the concert video & it wasn't there.

I loved the way the audience was shown and how everyone always had a smile on their faces and were mesmerized by this incredible concert.  It emphasizes how these talented ladies are loved by everyone who hears them and even more so when seen in concert. The grinches who didn't like seeing the audiences reactions are just complainers.  I got this blue ray in april and have watched it at least once a week sometimes more.  I enjoy the audiences reactions and see more each time I watch it by the smiles they all have and are getting into the good mood by clapping and simply enjoying their selves.  I enjoy that !  This is feel good viewing and listening,1404172800,,784,4.440559440559441
6161215,5,B00HF95PA4,"An excellent value for anyone that appreciates music, Irish culture, or entertainment in general! I purchased the disc after viewing the concert on a local broadcast, knowing I would want to watch (or more importantly hear) it again. This concert was nothing short of magical, which is what Celtic Woman fans have come to expect. I will not review each song, but the variety is great and the progression of music is heartwarming.

The only caveat to making this purchase a ""no-brainer"" is something that many other reviewers have polarized views on...and that is the cinematography. The picture is stunning, but many people complain that the cameras show the audience far too often. I personally did not have an issue with it as I was most interested in the ""sound"" rather than the ""picture."" Others may find it distracting or annoying. If that's important to you, then you will want to consider the decision to purchase accordingly.

6161240,4,B00HF95PA4,"The performances are excellent, as always, however, I have a few concerns that need to be corrected for future DVD and Blu-Ray releases.  First, the audio mix is lacking compared to what you would hear during a live performance.  There are times when certain instruments are not being included in the audio mix.  Many times the Penny Whistle is being played, yet it is not heard at all.  This is true during the live performance as well, so the programming of the live audio mixer needs to be corrected.  I also expected to feel/hear the same LFE (Low Frequency Effects) that are felt/heard during the live performances.  My home theater could have reproduced at least half of the punch to make my floor and walls shake, but it simply wasn't there :(.

My other complaint is that the shots of the audience are just plain awkward and uncomfortable to watch.  People are bobbing their heads to the music and singing along.  While I know this happens during the live performances, people at home do NOT want to see this.  I do not need confirmation from the audience that the show is spectacular.  I don't mind the occasional, short wide audience shot, but the camera most certainly does not need to be out in the audience capturing this nonsense.

While I don't regret my purchase, I hope the audio engineer who worked on this will understand that these things are important to the home audience.  Getting the same effect at home will not stop me from coming to see Celtic Woman anytime they are within a 250 mile radius.",1398470400,3,1519,4.623134328358209
6161241,3,B00HF95PA4,"I saw this concert in Charlotte, N.C. and the singer's were different. The program slightly different. I love the girls  and these  are good but just not what I expected.",1398384000,,170,4.633333333333334

6161243,3,B00HF95PA4,"I was so looking forward to this DVD.  I have enjoyed so many of their shows but this one (DVD) disappointed me.  I am hearing disabled and I cannot define the words to the songs without closed captioning.  On each DVD I now have there is the option for CC.  On this one there isn't and i feel I've wasted my money buying it.  As someone else said I cannot hear the words when they speak.  I am so thrilled with how Chloe looks now.  I envy her now.  I so enjoy her singing.  I missed some of the ones I used to see like Orla and Lisa.  I wish they would come back.  The choreography on this program is good and I see some other improvements, but because of no closed caption...this DVD is a great disappointment.",1398124800,3,713,4.094202898550725

Well, I have four of their DVD's so popped one in and they were so thrilled to see the performances, the songs, the dancing, they loved it. So with her birthday coming up I thought it would be the perfect gift. It was a 'hit'! I can watch these DVD's over and over, they are fascinating to watch. The songs are uplifting, the voices are awesome and inspiring.",1398124800,,534,4.245098039215686
6161245,3,B00HF95PA4,"It's good music, but I do not like the new singers, also miss seeing the director.  All the other DVDs of Celtic Woman show David directing at various times.  The group is getting away from there roots, and I don't like that at all.",1398124800,2,232,4.25
6161246,3,B00HF95PA4,"I was disapointed with the song Danny Boy as it seemed as if they tried to swing it. My mother sung this to us children when we were small I am now 77 years, she was a good singer.",1398038400,,180,3.641025641025641
6161247,3,B00HF95PA4,"I love the Celtic Women so this is a must have - I pre-ordered it. It didn't disappoint.
PRO
-Chloe lost like 20 lbs! And she is great here. I felt bad she has to leave - She has been with the band for like, 5 years? Just wonderful. I don't if she is fat but she sings like an angel; now she is also fit and pretty; she should have never left;
-Lisa now is the center of the band - she blends in so well. On last DVD she was a little strange, now she is totally blended in. She is great!
-The new girl wasn't too impressive but she isn't bad, so that's good news.
-All the songs were great! There's no disappointment at all. All 100% and more!
-The bass, music were flawless. It's amazing technology keeps improving and it shows on the quality of this blue-ray; the music just fantastic on my HT. Rich bass its just marvelous.
-Video was high resolution; it was pretty good, not perfect - some head shots was a little too big; I would appreciate if the video leverage the 20:9 but it's like 16:9 and a little too big sometimes in the center. I guess I could suggest something to make it better but as it is its not too bad

CON-
There's only one but it's a disaster: There's no caption!!!!!! How can anyone sing alone if he doesn't know the song? Can we just hire a Chinese or Indian guy and pay him a day's salary to get the caption done?!! Geez this is unbelievable. This is America here - please do a perfect job!!! There's no excuses to your fans.

6161284,5,B00HF95PA4,"As stated right on the DVD this is a remake of a number of songs some performed originallyby other Celtic Woman artists. I really enjoyed all the performances, and if anything was missing it was the presence of David Downes who is only seen with Lisa Lambe in her bonus song Bridge over troubled water at the end of the concert. The concerts do not seem the same without David's presence, however, I enjoyed every song and I have already listened to it several times!",1396224000,,467,4.5058823529411764

Having seen this Tour at the Lyric Theater in Baltimore, Maryland it was a joyous keepsake.

I now have 5 of their DVDs and I listen to their beautifal voices as often as I can.

6161307,5,B00HF95PA4,"This concert may not be as others with a smaller band, fewer back-up singers, and smaller stage, however this concert was the best in the way of personality. Given Mairead had less room to dance, this concert brought out so much more in her through body movements and facial expressions. One saw a playful side of her and all the ladies as they showed their individuality through humor not ever seen before. The smaller show allowed others in the band, such as the drummer, bagpiper, and back-up singers to have center stage time which was great and funny in places. This concert really showed the ladies humorous side and was a pleasure to see. One word to sum up this new concert would be BRAVO!",1395446400,,697,4.584
6161308,5,B00HF95PA4,"Every time I buy a Celtic Woman DVD, I have really high expectations, and those ladies do not disappoint!!!  Each one is better than the last.  I find Lisa Lambe to be a truly likeable addition to the group.  I understand this is the last one which will include Chloe--I'll really miss her.  She's a stunning and very talented young lady.  Loved her and Lisa doing ""She Moved Through the Fair.""  Both of the dance numbers were fun and beautifully done.  I really hope these ladies will continue to put out their brand of  music and fun.  I'd love to see, sometime in the future, a ""reunion concert""  with some of the members such as Lisa Kelley, Orla Fallon and Maeve rejoining the group for a concert.",1395446400,,702,4.456692913385827

6161311,3,B00HF95PA4,"The Celtic Women and their orchestra, dancers and singers entertain us again. However, I think they are more ""modern"" than previously and their voices are not as ethereal as in previous recordings. Chloe sings beautifully as before but the two new singers with her need to tone down their ""charms"" and sing in high clear voices  as the previous singers did. Had I never heard and seen the Celtic Women before I might find this lovely, but I felt it was not their best work.",1395187200,3,473,4.564705882352941

I wish she had done this final concert and make it on Hi Def format. She will definitely sound amazing on a lossless track as compared to DD5.1 Anyway, a must buy to all Celtic Woman fan as it's the first concert on blu ray (not counting their X'Mas specials that's was too released on blu ray)",1395100800,,411,4.282051282051282
6161335,5,B00HF95PA4,"I really did buy and view this DVD with a total biased pre opinion.  I just knew that with Lisa gone, (and Meav, and Orla, and Hayley, and Alex, and Lynn et al LOL) it just wasn't going to be any good.  To my amazement, it was fabulous.  In many ways this concert is one of the most dynamic and entertaining of them all.  I know that is saying a mouthful, but there it is.  The girls (although Chloe is not permanent) were just amazing in voice, looks, musicality.  As a musician myself, I am pretty picky on production, pitch control, presentation.  This production is just about perfect.  When I saw that Susan was doing Lisa's stunning ""the Voice"", I again was just sure she could not pull that off, boy was I wrong.  This is Celtic Woman at it's finest.  If I had never heard Celtic Woman before this concert I would be hooked, as it is, I have enjoyed their whole journey since the beginning along with Celtic Thunder.  This concert is as good as it gets.  You won't be dissappointed.

Most importantly, I am still a huge fan, may it continue ..........",1395014400,,1058,4.364102564102564

6161343,3,B00HF95PA4,"The DVD received is not as the program in the case says. When I played the DVD it ended short by 4 numbers, they did 14 songs out of the 18 songs listed on the program.
Is there two different Emerald DVD, one more expensive then the other, and I ORGERED the less expensive one. If that's the case I would like to order the one with all 14 songs on it,",1394236800,,351,3.888888888888889
6161344,2,B00HF95PA4,"Obviously the new concert DVD ""Emerald""  proves there is discord in the Celtic Woman musical camp.  There is no more joy, no new songs and definitely no orchestra or full choir to back the ladies up.  I was very disappointed with this new/old concert effort!",1394150400,7,258,4.688888888888889
6161345,4,B00HF95PA4,"As one who has loved Celtic Woman since discovering them in 2006, I am sadly in agreement with many of the other reviewers who felt this concert was a disappointment.  This concert is sort of a greatest hits but with the songs sung, for the most part, by different members of the group due to the great turnover of singers in recent years.  And there is the main problem.  Susan McFadden is a lovely young woman with a sweet voice.  However asking her to sing ""Caledonia"" and ""The Voice"" is a huge mistake.  I first discovered Celtic Woman while listening to Lisa Kelly sing ""Caledonia"" on the ""New Beginning"" concert at my local electronics store.  She has always been my favorite and asking someone else to sing her songs is a mistake.
This concert begins with Chloe, Susan and Lisa Lambe doing ""Awakening.""  Yet the most recent Celtic Woman concert (other than the"" Home for Christmas"" concert,)"" Believe"" started the same way, only with Chloe, Lisa Lambe and Lisa Kelly.  It seemed strange to start this concert the exact same way.  Chloe sings her own ""Nocturne,"" yet it sounded better on the previous concert.  Its that way with most of the concert: ""been there, done that.""  Its enjoyable to watch only just not as good as the previous concerts on dvd.  On the plus side, this concert does include 2 of the Celtic Woman dance numbers: ""Nil Se'n La"" and ""Teir Abhaile Riu.""  They are fun but not as interesting due to the limitations of the very unspectacular stage used for this concert.
Someone observed that the Celtic Woman concerts show too much of the audience.  I am in complete agreement.  There is a little girl shown singing and dancing to the music THREE TIMES!!.  I think once would have been enough.  (Celtic Woman did the same thing on their first Christmas dvd when they cut away from Lisa Kelly in the wonderful ""Let It Snow"" number to show an elderly couple laughing and clapping.  I cringe whenever I see it.)
Since this concert was filmed last year, Chloe has left Celtic Woman.  However Lisa Lambe is an absolute doll and one of my favorites, Susan McFadden is lovely and Mairead is still amazing, the heart and soul of Celtic Woman.  However it is obvious that not much thought went into this concert and its probably time to put ""Dulaman"" and ""Danny Boy"" to rest.  As some have mentioned, David Downes does not even make an appearance until Lisa Lambe's thundering rendition of ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" as part of the bonus material.
In conclusion, I love Celtic Woman and will be seeing them in concert at Radio City Music Hall in May.  However it is time for some new material.  And if they are going to continue doing their old numbers, wouldn't it be nice to bring back Lisa Kelly, Meav, Orla Fallon, Alex Sharpe, etc. to perform them.  I know this is never going to happen but it is nice to ponder.",1394064000,5,2835,4.579365079365079
6161346,5,B00HF95PA4,"We watch every Celtic Woman DVD that has emerged. This one beats them all. The staging is adventurous, the music is grand,
the ""Celtic Woman"" part, though reduced in numbers, shines. It is one of those DVDs that will not be donated to the local library.

6161347,5,B00HF95PA4,"Again, a real good  production! The Celtic Woman continue to amaze and inspire. Chole as always great,and a newer member Susan is fantastic as well. But Lisa Lambe ,not one of the origInals,but what a great addition,Her great talents add a new dimension to this wonderful group. She is magnificent ! She also comes across as a sweet ,kind, and sincere person. Gotta love her!",1393977600,,375,4.769230769230769
6161348,5,B00HF95PA4,"There are a lot of great songs sung on this DVD, but I wish there were more.  I think this DVD really let you see the ladies talents, especially Susan's, which I hadn't realized to the extent.",1393977600,,192,4.1891891891891895
6161349,3,B00HF95PA4,"Nothing new from the group on this CD.  Was hoping for some exciting new music, but not there this time.",1393804800,9,104,4.2
6161350,4,B00HF95PA4,"The show, overall, is fabulous! The entire Celtic Woman team are fantastic performers and they never fail to draw your attention and do a wonderful job at what they do, even with a stage as small as the one they perform on here. The audio of the singing is fantastic and you can hear every word clear as day, but anytime they are simply talking you have to strain to hear what they are saying. Could they really not have turned the volume up for that period of time, or even gone back and edited that bit to make it more clear? Some of my favorite parts of the performance are when they are in the crowd, getting the fans into the song, making things more exciting, but when that's not happening I really don't care to see the audience over and over again, and based on the reviews here not many others do either. I would have loved to see more of the performance and less of the crowd. Seemed like every time they'd start to do something like dance they'd pan to the audience. We like to see that stuff! Other than the audience shots and the audio issues, I have no more complaints about this performance recording. The show was amazing and the song choices brilliant.",1393804800,40,1169,4.342465753424658
6161351,5,B00HF95PA4,I JUST LOVE  THE CELTIC WOMEN THIER STYLE THE LARGE ORCHESTA AND EVEN THIER AUDIENCE THE ENERGY THEY PUT ON THIER MUAIC NUMBERS TO SEE HOW THEY HAVE  EVOLVED THRU THE YEARS.  MUST  SEE DVD AND IN BLU RAY TO BOOT JUST BEAUTIFUL/,1393545600,,227,4.209302325581396
6161352,5,B00HF95PA4,"Celtic Woman started as an experiment to celebrate traditional Irish melodies in a fresh and modern way presented by a wonderful group of talented ladies who represent the diverse beauty of the women of this region.  Due to the marvelous talents of the team assembled, the project lit a fire that has spread around the world.  We fell in love with Mairead, Chloe, Lisa Kelly, Meav, and Orla.  The magnificent arrangements by David Downes had us all singing along and making these Irish songs our own.  The Celtic Woman experience has taken us through many excellent videos and albums.  Along the way the team has changed giving us wonderful memories of Lynn, Alex, Lisa Lambe, Susan, and Hayley.  We are just starting to see the newest member Mairead Carlin.

This latest release is a filming of the actual Celtic Woman touring show.  This is a fun show with fantastic performances of many favorites. It is absolutely stunning on BluRay.  Every detail in the bead work on the gowns, the textures and colors of the stage, even the glitter shines in this beautiful presentation.  As always, the ladies are at the top of their form as Chloe, Susan, Lisa Lambe, and Mairead dazzle through our Celtic Woman favorites.  Don't miss it!

As I listened to this CD for the first time prior to receiving the BluRay, I had a realization in the music.  Over the journey so far, I have grown to love the specific songs from the specific voices.  I have read reviews and notes from fans stating their favorite team or individual.  I have seen comments as the team changes which express regret and concern with the personnel shifts.  I have even desperately wanted to hang on to my favorite voice.  While listening to this CD, I realized that this is not Lisa's song, or Chloe's song.  But these are Ireland's songs and Celtic Woman's songs.  To truly celebrate the diversity and beauty of these time treasured songs, it is best to experience them in different ways with different voices and personalities.  Yes, I will always swoon to Lisa Kelly's Caledonia.  I will be swept up by Chloe's Galway Bay.  But I will also embrace Lisa Lambe's Dulaman and welcome Susan's The Voice.  The beauty of having these recordings is that we can continue to experience the past we love as well as look forward to the diversity and change that is ahead.

That is what the Emerald release is to me. Remembering the celebration of the Celtic Woman and moving into the next phase.  I hope there are many more experiences to come!",1393459200,25,2497,4.685057471264368
