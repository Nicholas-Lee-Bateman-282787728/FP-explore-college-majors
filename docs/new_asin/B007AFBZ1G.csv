5071712,5,B007AFBZ1G,"I happened upon this movie about a year after my son, age 10, died very suddenly from a reoccurrence of cancer. It doesn't matter what your child dies from, if they suffer a lengthy illness and then die it is heart breaking and forever damaging.

When I saw the videos of the parents, especially the mother, before and after his death you can see the sadness in her face. I thought to myself ""I am a damaged mother, just like her."" That does not mean that I haven't gone on with my life, but it changes in a way that cannot be described. You can't know unless you have experienced it.

I cried and cried after this movie, which is a good thing. It takes a lot of energy to bury feelings and continue your life, but somehow we must.",1252972800,7,731,4.214285714285714
5071713,4,B007AFBZ1G,I lost a nephew to suicide when he was only 14 years old.  When I saw this on HBO I knew it could reach many people affected by my nephew's death or those whose lives that have been changed by knowing someone who has committed suicide. Many of the comments and reflections in the documentary were similar to one's made surrounding his death. It gave me comfort in a sad and strange way.,1252454400,3,386,4.287671232876712
5071714,5,B007AFBZ1G,"I thought the movie was very good. living with bipolar and a son who has it, it shows the confusion and the thoughts that are there o lot of the time. It is easy to say oh you should have done this or that but the impulses of the illness are strong and you don't really realize how sick you are. I have been told that i get a different look about me and as my son gets a look and his anger is so strong...but so is the love when he is loving life..  i have survived suicide attempts in the past but i do believe the illness will possibly kill me or my son one day. while I know it hurts family and friends My wish is that these people can see that finally their loved one is not in such confusing turmoil and emotional pain anymore. God bless all the people that deal with this illness or any mental illness and their loved ones.",1250553600,15,829,3.964071856287425
5071715,4,B007AFBZ1G,"After reading some of the other reviews I felt compelled to write my own. As I watched Boy Interrupted, I became very interested in the dynamics of the family and their family ""Style"" as The Perry home is not your typical household. The parents are artists and filmmakers and probably possess a very different dynamic than those people who are critical of the Perry's and the way they handled the very sad and tragic situation with their son Evan. To me the other storyline in this movie is about a family who is grieving in their own special way--through the making of this film. To some, this may seem narcissistic and insensitive to Evan's wishes, but I see it as completely in-sync with how they grieve.
At times, there are some questions left unanswered, and I believe that is the result of the subjectivity from the filmmakers telling their own story. I am completely fine with that, as this film cannot be anything other than subjective. If they waited to make this film two years from now, it would be a different movie, but still relevant and still subjective.
The Perry's have done a brave thing by telling their own story and opening themselves up to criticism.
Watch this film as not just a portrait of a boy with bi-polar disorder but also as a family in the process of grieving the best way they know how--through the telling of their story.",1250208000,22,1355,4.603305785123967
5071716,1,B007AFBZ1G,"how wonderful that the filmmakers have found  way to absolve themselves of any part they  may have had in evan's suffering and found a nifty way to profit off his  personal anguish, disconnect, and eventual suicide.  after all, it's just his disease that made him do it!  i dare say, when examining the carefully edited and manipulatively scored footage of this young man's early years,  this family doesn't seem very ""normal"" or  even very tolerant, attentive,  or truly loving- and i am not surprised this child was in trouble. it  also kind of goes to show you that an affluent lifestyle doesn't necessarily produce  a well- adjusted kid.

 this kid seemed doomed from the get go-everyone loved making him their own little special freaky ""problem.""  ""evan's sick, there's something wrong with evan,"" from KINDERGARTEN  on this is repeated over and over...how messed up could this kid have been in KINDERGARTEN? no wonder he hated himself. anytime someone lables a five or six-year-old child ""bipolar,"" perhaps you should look more at the ACCUSER than the accused. you'd probably hate yourself too if everyone was always telling you there was something wrong with you! boo. hiss. suicidal impulses are not simply the result of misfiring  neurons. they arise from desires to ""get back"" at those who've ignored or hurt you,  a desperate need to free yourself from the burdens and responsibilities of living, a desire to dodge the expectations of achievement; an inner yearning to end overwhelming fear, intense pain, or intolerable stress;  or sometimes simply... a wish to escape  the banal tedium of existence.

this movie is scary because it marginalizes the feelings of the suicide victim  and attempts to canonize his family members as martyrs and saints. it paints them as prisoners of his selfish and tiresome pathology.  it's a close minded, cave man mentality. they NEVER try to understand this boy, they just decide from the get-go: ""evan is bad, evan is broken. our family is good, our family will fix him.""

well, what a nice, superior position to be in. how lovely to spend one's days passing judgment on the sick and insane, and creating films lauding  your long-suffering tolerance and piety.

i'm sorry but i'm not buying it. the very fact that this film was even MADE, what with it's cheesy hollywood blockbuster/oscar-bait  rip-off title, is extremely suspicious.

there is no exploration of circumstances in evan's life or factors in evan's environment  OUTSIDE of his ""disorder"" that may have contributed to this tragic event. NONE WHATSOEVER. these people are trying to absolve themselves of the guilt they feel for having inappropriately  handled their child. obviously, the intense psychiatry, forced medication FROM THE AGE OF FIVE ON, AND LITTLE TRIPS OFF TO THE LOONY BIN STARTING IN THE PRE-TEENAGE YEARS DIDN'T HELP MUCH, DID THEY MOM AND DAD? but you certainly wouldn't want a child like THAT around at home, right? i mean, you had your important film careers to focus on, you couldn't keep a loser like that about the house, could ya? he really just got in the WAY. yeah... i'm sure this didn't make evan feel bad AT ALL.

 maybe if they would have put their damn cameras down for a half a second and oh, i don't know, actually spent a little uninterrupted, focused time with this kid, they would have found themselves with a  much better adjusted boy. one who wasn't destined to become (ahem)  ""interrupted.""

this is a VERY biased film.

there is nothing that can take away this family's pain, and my heart does go out to them, but they are NOT 100% innocent in this disaster and it sickens me that they are turning an extremely private, painful story into one that is i am quite sure meant to help them out of a financial hole and make them feel better about not doing the right things with evan. a lot of ""spin doctoring"" and ""blaming the victim"" going on here. anyone who can't see it has never worked with challenged kids - AS I HAVE.

read between the lines, people. sigh. this poor child. but oh well, it's just a roll of the genetic dice, huh? guess he just got the defective brain! hmmm...i'm sure the family did  EVERYTHING perfectly and always treated him SO WELL. i'm sure NOTHING they did EVER affected his perception of himself. or that ANYTHING regarding the way they treated him led to his mental state. right? kinda hard to ask him now. really look at this film. examine the mother, father, and the brother and see what you THINK and how you FEEL.  i think you may find your sympathies  coming to lay elsewhere than intended.

but way to turn a buck, survivors! and  way to play the pity card. good job! way to make some money. wouldn't your dead son be proud?",1249862400,23,4708,4.764197530864197
5071717,4,B007AFBZ1G,"As someone with quite a lot of experience with bipolar disorder, mental illness generally, and suicide in particular, I of course had to see this movie.  It's about a really important subject, teenage suicide, and also about a mental disorder that is underdiagnosed--friends tease me that I claim that everyone is bi-polar.

Formerly known as ""manic depressives"", sufferers of bipolar disorder have ""highs"" and ""lows"". Way before this film identifies poor ""Evan"" as suffering from this disorder, it was obvious to me that's what he had.  As a young child, he was highly creative, artistic, intensely loving and charming, yet sometimes just the opposite, with a blank affect and inappropriate and destructive thoughts and actions.  Classic for a bipolar child.  But the really alarming thing is that this kid expressed what the professionals call ""suicidal ideation""--that is, he talked about killing himself and even how he would do it, and what is more, there were even attempts or ""mock attempts"" at suicide early in childhood.  This is very unusual and it points up one of two or three serious flaws that I find in the film.  I saw the film on HBO.  If the DVD addresses these points in extra material, which it should, then you have to buy the DVD to get what should be in an appendix to the film.

If the DVD does not contain explanations of these or perhaps other points, then please see my comments below and consider them carefully. They have to do with detection, therapy, and prevention of suicide in bipolar patients. (No, I am not a psychiatrist, but I have family members and friends with bipolar disorder and I have experience with suicides of friends and clients where I have researched the issues, and as a lawyer I have represented families of suicide victims.)

I certainly do not want to be critical of the family here, only of the film-maker.  There is no doubt that Evan was a wonderful child.  You see it throughout this film.  And he may not have had some of the ""issues"" that many bipolar kids have.  It's clear from the remarks of his older half-brother that Evan's concerns, as expressed in a coldly analytical suicide note, were very mainstream. He worried that he was going to be a failure, that criticisms of him were true, that his friends were not really friends, and that kind of thing.  As Nick says, every fifteen year old thinks about these things, just maybe not as intensely as Evan did, again leading to one of my points of criticism below.

1.  To its credit, the film has extensive information, including interviews with the boy's psychiatrist after the suicide, where the doctor rightly observes that kids who are medicated for bipolar disorder may have their conditions change, and may or may not go off their medicine regimen, and the results are unpredictable and tricky. Looking back, these parents more or less acknowledge that Evan needed to go back on Lithium (probably the most effective drug and one that several friends and family members I know have done well  with for years).  But the film does not follow up with some succinct and non-controversial practical advice about detecting bipolar disorder. That would include, for example, intense emotional responses to ordinary stimuli, impulsive destructive behavior, obsessive sexual behavior, and most importantly, substance abuse.  It's unclear whether Evan had substance abuse problems or any kind of sexual anxiety, but that doesn't matter.  Part of the purpose of this film, such as it is, should be more than a celebration of Evan's life.  It should try to help out.  So I would have liked to have seen discussion of these important points about detecting bipolar disorder in kids.

2.  Again, to its credit, the film suggests, though not strongly enough, that any child who expresses suicidal thoughts needs to be taken seriously.  Yet the ""therapy"" that is more or less endorsed by this film is pretty much a substitute family therapy, where Evan was sent to a place where he learned self-reliance and responsibility, if you make a mess you need to clean it up and that kind of thing.  How do we know that this is what helped him turn around?  I missed a discussion of ""family therapy"", that is, direct discussion in the family, assisted by trained counselors, which I have found from experience to be very effective.  And when you see the circumstances of Evan's suicide, it seems to me that this kind of therapy may have been needed.  I was wondering if it was ever tried. (Note: most insurance companies will not pay for any kind of ""talk therapy"".)

3.  ""Spirit of the moment"".  Here again, I am not critical of Evan's family, though I have to say that in my experience handling legal cases involving suicides, this always comes up and I think the film-maker should have addressed it because it is obvious.  Late in the film, in some of the most poignant moments, one of Evan's young friends remarks that he thinks that the suicide was just done ""in the spirit of the moment"", i.e. impulsively, despite the note where Evan outlined his thinking.  This is a kid who has expressed suicidal ideation from early childhood and particularly in connection with a particular method of accomplishing suicide.

Suicides are often impulsive just as bipolar patients are.  People who are suicidal should not have loaded guns around.  See the film and you will know what I am talking about.

Again, my heart goes out to this family and I am very sorry for their loss, but I would have liked to see more about how to prevent other tragedies like this.",1249862400,10,5551,4.8031578947368425
5071718,5,B007AFBZ1G,"In my humblest opinion, documentaries should be the type of ""movies"" to get all the attention and accolades simply because there's no ""heavy machinery"" involved and no acting, whatsoever (most of the times). They show life the way it is--unscripted and ""un-rehearsed"".
At least this gem of a ""movie"" doesn't have any of that, yet it still delivers. Like all documentaries, it presents the life of young Evan Scott Perry, who tragically committed suicide at the tender age of 15.
As a way of coming to terms with the past and present, Evan's mother, Dana Perry, puts together a film tracking Evan's short life and how his untimely departure came to have its effect on the ones he left behind.
An honest look at a beautiful life tragically cut short, this is definitely one of the most powerful documentaries I have ever seen, and it doesn't take a movie critic to say that!!!

5071730,5,B007AFBZ1G,"If you hope to understand the world of bi-polar disorder, this is the film to watch. Just the fact that the parents were willing to bring the cameras into their personal and tragic story provides a unique look at the impact of bi-polar disorder on a young person and their family. (Make sure you have some tissues handy.)",1362009600,4,321,4.551724137931035
5071731,4,B007AFBZ1G,"I saw this documentary about 3 years ago, and recommended it to a friend, who's young adult son was struggling with mental illness and addiction.

I remember thinking how a film about bi-polar disorder, made by professional documentarians about their own son, with access to a camera at a moments notice, would be so good for bringing the realities and the enigma of the illness to the public, as experienced by the family.

I found it profoundly sad, that these patients are often brilliant, as was Evan with his music, and also the eerie preoccupation with death at an age (6 ?), when most children are unable to conceptualize it at all.

I read a few years ago that 25% of manic depressives committ suicide.  I'm not sure those statistics have changed, they may even be worse, since mental health care is particularly neglected in this country, not requiring insurance companies to cover it like any other illness.

 People who have some money can get help, and very poor people have some funding (not enough), but most people have to pay a lot out of pocket for treatment, and for very expensive medications that often take a long time, and fine tuning to get the right combination, and patients often require several medications that can easily run into hundreds of dollars a month.

I really would have to watch it again, but my recollection is that the psychiatrist was not as proactive as he should have been.

And, ultimately, in a family that obviously was sophisticated, and financially able to provide the best care, they still lost their son.

I think also, Evan was severely stricken at such a young age, he had had no period of normal development to draw on, and no impulse control to prevent him from taking his young life.

My friends' son, who I mentioned earlier, has survived his illness after very rough teens and early twenties.

At one point, I didn't think he was going to make it, but he is a very smart, introspective guy, able to use counseling well,had insurance and the money to pay for many, many medication trials before getting the right combination,  and his parents did not give up on him during the really rough times with the addiction, etc.

What it takes to survive, is definitiley support, and the rest, is a combination of genes, luck,.......................I don't know. Mental illness is a terrible thing.",1355875200,3,2347,4.751231527093596
5071732,3,B007AFBZ1G,"My husband, at the time, is bipolar.  This was an eye-opening movie he didn't want to watch because it was uncomfortable for him.  But he watched it and needed to hear it's message.",1353110400,2,181,4.454545454545454
5071733,4,B007AFBZ1G,"People in this world who had friends or family members who dealt with the pain of losing a loved one to suicide or dealing with any type of mental illness such as bipolar disorder (known as manic depression), schizophrenia, etc. should know as they watched this documentary can learn something from this and they can cope with it in a better way.

Since we got the tools we have such as suicide prevention, support groups, foundations, awareness for suicide and depression, it's to let ourselves know we're not alone with this, but we have people who cared and loved about us.

Watching this documentary almost had me crying and very motivating of how precious life really is in this world. It goes to show you that whomever you hang out or put in your brain comes back, right or wrong, good or bad.

Give special thanks to Dana Perry (whom produced, directed and appear on this film), The Perry Family, friends, teachers, and people who took the time to express their love and feelings about the life of Evan Scott Perry. This boy never had the oppurtunity to love himself more during his time here. This boy had so much potential and greatness if he didn't take his own life at 15 years of age on October 2005. Had he lived, he'll still be here at the direction he's heading. God bless his loyal Spirit.

I promise by the grace of God you can accomplish anything with your life if you have the right mindset by surrounding yourself with positive people, motivating yourself even more. It's never too late to ask for help or the capacity to seek someone to talk with. We all human beings don't have to suffer through the pain or the struggle with what Evan did.

Suicide is a waste of life, very painful, sad and tragic....the best advice to overcome with this is by the Way of Life.

His parents share their feelings intimately and openly about his embattled life and consequent suicide. I only wish more people could be open like this family to help bring further awareness to an illness that still has a stigma attached to it, and very little awareness.

5071736,5,B007AFBZ1G,"When I saw this movie I was like now someone understands. I am the guardian of 3 children with mental health issues. People are so closed minded when it comes to mental health its crazy. I really think people feel if we don't talk about it, it will go away. The school system is the worse because they believe if the child is not hanging from the chandelier then they don't see anything wrong. More and more kids are going to mental health hospitals every day. If we don't deal with this as a country not only are these kids going to remain sick but they will grow up to be sick adults. Let's not keep it a secret anymore.

I would recommend this movie to anyone dealing with a child with mental health. Not so much for support because I believe no matter what people will continue to look the other way but to know you're not alone.",1304640000,3,833,4.238993710691824

5071738,5,B007AFBZ1G,"I just finished watching the documentary ""Boy Interrupted"" on DVD. I thought this was a very moving film, but also painful at the same time. It is the story about Evan Scott Perry who took his own life at the age of 15 because he could no longer live with the mental and emotional suffering caused by bipolar disorder. The film chronicles - in a very open and honest way - the life of this beautiful child Evan. Even for those who have had friends or family members with bipolar disorder, this disease can still seem mysterious. We feel at a loss as to what we should do. I know that in cases of suicide some people will feel the need to ask you why you didn't see a sign or why you didn't interpret a certain action as a cry for help. It's easy to say those things after the fact. But the truth is, children are very complex beings. And every child is different, with different personalities and different behavior patterns. Yet this is normal. In the documentary, Evan's parents and teachers did a good job at recognizing when Evan's behavior was inappropriate. But knowing how to deal with that and what to do requires a much higher level of skill than the average person possesses. The thing which could have contributed to Evan's suicide - and this is only speculation made after the fact - was reducing his level of lithium. Nobody could have known at the time what the results of this action would be. And indeed, even if the dosage level hadn't been reduced, who's to say the result would have been different. These are all just thoughts that might go through the mind of someone viewing this film. It would be impossible to capture the complexity of this subject in its totality in this brief review. But this documentary does the job in a very admirable, loving and respectful way. The parents of Evan should be commended for giving us this beautiful piece of work. It is the ultimate tribute to Evan, who was - and is - the real beauty behind this story.",1298851200,4,1965,4.461111111111111

I know no one close to me that committed such an act BUT I have plenty of people around me that suffer from depression and bi-polar disorder. The thought of filming the day in the life of a suicidal child was insane to me until I began to watch and learn all that went into this documentary. People communicate, grieve and live differently.

Sometimes you feel left alone in this private world where everyone on the outside feels you are just paranoid or making things worse than they really are. When Dana made the comment about hoping that something good can come from this...well I believe it has.

5071746,3,B007AFBZ1G,"I read all of the reviews. Obviously, this movie inspires a lot of thought. One person remarked that Evan's family was to blame. But, I definitely think he was biologically ill. The evidence is when he stopped taking the Lithium, he quickly descended back to severe depression. Yes, the family is weird. I was uncomfortable even watching the scene in which the mother is holding Evan upside down as a baby - he doesn't seem to be enjoying it that much, she is holding him like a prop, it is decidedly un-nurturing and kind of.. artsy and self-indulgent looking.  HOWEVER, she did not cause her child to be mentally ill and as someone pointed out, filmmaking is what these folks do.  No family is going to look that great under a microscope with the luxury of twenty-twenty hindsight.

The psychiatrist is to blame for allowing the family to experiment with the meds, in my opinion.",1254960000,9,881,4.670967741935484

I feel like the parents gave us a gift in putting this film together - sharing all of the intimacy and raw emotion - and the gift should help others to understand a bit more of what the world is like for the Evans of this world, and their families.  For my students, this will result in their understanding a bit more about the nature of suicidal impulses, and perhaps through learning about Evan, a life may be saved down the road.  I particularly like that this was a film that did not dwell on blame or guilt or easy answers. There's always so much of that to go around.

As someone who has struggled with depression for close to 20 years, I understand partially what he was feeling. But I cannot fully grasp where he was mentally. He suffered terribly for so long. My first thought is I want to reach out and give him a hug and tell him he matters immensely to so many people. I realize that's not possible, but I can't help feeling it. I could not keep from crying at the end. His family is wonderful and their pain was so palpable it was too much. I can't believe the folks blaming his family and bashing them. They did everything they could and to judge them like that is not fair. I hope the film helps people struggling with depression/bipolar issues or their families. Beautiful film and beautiful family. I hope they find peace in time.",1525910400,,914,4.350877192982456

I found it to be most helpful in gaining a greater understanding of how bipolar disorder can not only impact the individual, but the entire family too. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to gain a greater understanding of this disorder as well as how it can change lives as well.
I give Evan's family a great deal of credit for their willingness to speak out about this disorder. I am certain many will benefit them from their willingness to their story.",1459036800,,544,4.561224489795919

8513333,5,B007AFBZ1G,"This documentary is extremely moving and sad. It really opened my eyes to the disease of depression. Suicide isn't always ""selfish"" in their eyes. Don't judge my statement without seeing this first. Some people really are born with clinical depression and NEED to be medicated to survive. I'm not one of these people, but I dated someone who was clinically depressed. It drove me bonkers, but in midst of striving to understand, I stumbled across this amazing and sad documentary. It did not save my relationship, but it sure helped me understand depression a lot more. I cannot recommend this more... just bring your tissues.",1422576000,7,626,4.9714285714285715

8513336,2,B007AFBZ1G,"I had such a hard time getting past the solipsistic parents it was difficult for me to ""find"" their child's actual story in all of their self absorbtion. This kid was really a mess, and combined that with being in such a privileged upbringing like his father, and uncle (they gave this kid the middle name of the uncle who offed himself...perfect foreshadowing), it felt like he never stood a chance. The grandmother was completely detached and delusional in that ""money"" way. This is what happens when too much money, and too much self indulgence collides. It also felt like an ad for Wellspring (and Dalton) The most interesting person and most clear eyed about it all was the step brother. More of him and less of his doe eyed mother would have been a great thing. Also, for two filmmakers at the helm, the production values were quite poor. Sadly, this kid's true story was eclipsed by his weird parents need for attention. On film, and I suspect, in real life.",1407024000,4,965,4.616279069767442
