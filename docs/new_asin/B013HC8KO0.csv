7364821,4,B013HC8KO0,"This is an anthology of short stories that explore the goings-on in a small town on Halloween night. Some of the stories are scary, some are funny, and some are simply ironic. In that respect, Tales of Halloween sort of follows in the tradition of the original Twilight Zone TV series. The production company did itself a disservice by promoting this as ""10 Terrifying Tales"" because some of the stories here aren't really scary at all. If you go into it expecting more of a Twilight Zone -type experience, you won't be disappointed.

The first story, ""Sweet Tooth"", centers on a totally original urban legend, but I can see it becoming a standard tale for sharing at Halloween parties and sleepovers. This was the standout in the collection for me.

The Night Jimmy Raised Hell is one of the more ironic entries. What if Mephistopheles was a cranky, suburban neighbor who's been the victim of one too many Halloween pranks?

In Trick, a group of kids who've clearly seen a few too many prank horror videos acts out.

The Weak and the Wicked pits an orphaned, bullied teen against the hooligans who killed his parents, but he may not be so helpless as the bullies think this time around.

Grim Grinning Ghost introduces another Halloween ""legend""; this one's a tale of sustained tension.

Ding Dong re-imagines the witch from Hansel and Gretel as hiding in the guise of a modern-day woman who's frustrated at being unable to have children of her own. Little does she know that re-enacting her original crimes will be her undoing.

This Means War follows a Halloween decor and sounds battle between neighbors to its bitter end.

In Friday the 31st, a Leatherface -type killer gets his comeuppance from a tiny, alien trick or treater.

The Ransom of Rusty Rex is a horror take on the classic story, The Ransom of Red Chief.

In The Bad Seed, a pumpkin that's been genetically-engineered to be extra-large wreaks its revenge for the carnage humans do to its brethren every Halloween.

Homages to famous horror movies, directors and stories are sprinkled liberally throughout.",1445126400,21,2072,4.824858757062147
7364822,3,B013HC8KO0,"If you are expecting a movie like 2007's ""Trick or Treat"" you may be somewhat disappointed. The 10 very short clips are intertwined and extremely campy and only somewhat actually scary. There is very little buildup which may account for the lack of creepiness but it was nice to see lot's of actors like Lin Shaye from ""Insidious"", Clare Kramer from ""Buffy"" and ""Bring it on"",  Keir Gilchrist from ""United States of Tara"" and ""It follows"",  Adrienne Curry from ""Americas Next Top Model"" and, James Duval form ""Doom generation"" and ""Donnie Darko"".

7364840,2,B013HC8KO0,"This has to be one of the WORST movies I have ever seen! And I have seen, literally, thousands of movies. (Thank God I rented this movie before I threw away good money to buy it.) All these glowing reviews must be from the filmakers' friends and family. It was not scary at all nor was it in the least bit funny. In fact, any attempts to make this movie scary were completely obliterated by the feeble and lame attempts at humor. So, the result was an unscary, unfunny, 'gross-out' mess of a movie. The only thing truly ""Horrible"" about this movie is that I wasted 98 minutes of my life watching this garbage. I was genuinely embarrassed for all of the well known actors and directors connected to this mess. I guess these must be tough times indeed when these usually high calibre people need to do this trash. It's really a shame because one comes to expect a certain degree of excellence from these 'name' people. But, that's certainly not happening here, folks! I really feel ripped off. Save your money and get a root canal instead. That would certainly be more scary. Heck, a root canal would probably be more funny too!",1489795200,3,1126,4.4975609756097565

7364844,2,B013HC8KO0,"Glad we found this on sale.  Almost wish we didn't, as it's still overpriced, considering it was clearly produced based on outdated priorities.  This is little more than an elaborate DVD release with a bonus Blu-ray included.  The oversized packaging is unnecessarily cumbersome and will be less appealing in large collections where shelf-space is ever diminishing.  And it's not even especially well made.  Either their intent was to make it stand out on shelves, or they have such little respect for their market that they actually think they're fooling anyone.  The case isn't just overly thick for a mere 4 discs - a standard 10 disc Viva case is smaller than this - it is dvd height too, maybe a little taller.  I have no doubt that many Blu-ray collectors will seek out custom coverart and substitute this behemoth with a more conventional Blu-ray case.  Sadly, they won't be able to change the fact that they can't upgrade the contents just as easily:  Sadly, the discs were also produced with a bias for antiquated, low-quality tech.  Most of the more desirable extras are unnecessarily limited to mere 480i standard definition DVD quality, when said short films and other extras are available in HD overseas.  In an age when HD has long been the new television ""Standard"" and we're starting to gravitate toward UHD, Epic apparently is still struggling with the times, thinking 480i, a resolution just slightly higher than VHS is still cutting edge.  Not to insult the DVD market.  But this product is clearly aimed at a more demanding market and they desperately need to greater ambition, if they're going to justify such a premium price.

I would have expected such treatment from a release in 2006, the year of BD's debute, before HD had even begun to permeate mainstream.  In 2016 there's little excuse for such shortsightedness.  I've always felt that studios that don't sincerely try to produce a premium product, don't deserve being paid a premium price.",1486684800,4,1969,4.921212121212121

""The Bad Seed"" was another good and funny one that ended the show, really good tribute Halloween 3 and probably to ""Attack Of The Killer Tomato"".

7364855,4,B013HC8KO0,"Tales of Halloween is a fun anthology film with 10 interlocking stories sure to get you in the Halloween spirit. A radio DJ speaks about the night in between each segment. Some characters and events even overlap, which is impressive considering each segment is made by a different director.

* Sweet Tooth

Mikey just came home from Halloween but is warned by his babysitter and her boyfriend to leave some candy for Sweet Tooth, a boy who went mad and killed his parents over the denial of Halloween candy. If none is left for him, he even eats the candy you've already eaten. This segment is delightfully gruesome and gives those who don't follow the rules their just desserts. Despite the gore, this is an adorable segment that calls to mind that fear of monsters under the bed and believing in urban legends. The ending displays pitch perfect dark humor that I love.

* The Night Billy Raised Hell

Billy is pressured to prank a reclusive neighbor only to be caught. That neighbor turns out to be the devil who decides to take revenge. More pranks follow in a montage that start out pretty harmless, but ends with pranks like stabbings, setting people on fire, and grand theft auto that have serious and dangerous consequences. The only thing that detracts from the segment is the cartoon sound effects that undermine the sinister events. Barry Bostwick makes this horror comedy segment. The twist ending made me wonder what happened afterwards.

* Trick

A group of adults have a Halloween party to drink, smoke pot, and hand out candy to children until one trick or treater dressed as a which stabs the man who answers. The survivors are under siege by other murderous costumed children no matter how they try to fight back or escape. This segment takes children we see every Halloween and makes them into a legitimate threat. Like the victims in the film, it took a while to ensure this wasn't some sort of nightmare and disbelief takes a while to overcome. I never saw the ending coming and then it all makes sense. This segment is one of the darkest in a sea of ones that chose camp and humor over horror.

* The Weak and the Wicked

A teenage boy confronts a group of bullies to avenge his parents' death with a creature he attempts to summon. This segment is most like Tales from the Crypt with its black and white morality and over the top evil people. The three bullies are the worst kind of people that torture everyone they come across with glee. At first, they seem like run of the mill jerks, but flashbacks show them to venture into unforgiveable territory. You just hope something horrible happens to them. The creature has a unique design with practical effects. The ending is incredibly satisfying.

* Grim Grinning Ghost

A group of friends meet for a Halloween costume party. The host of the party tells the story of a disfigured woman who became a ghost and giggles behind her victims, killing them only if they turn around. One woman experiences the worst luck of all time and finds herself walking home alone, trying to outrun this ghost. This segment captures the fear of Halloween where spirits walk the earth. You're not supposed to look behind you or you'll die, but not looking makes you almost compelled to look or suffering with paranoia that something is behind  you. Suspense is built steadily through the whole segment, but it's wasted on a final jump scare. I felt the ending was cheap and ruined the segment.

* Ding Dong

Jack and Bobbie are a couple who haven't been able to have a child. Last Halloween, she was in tears over the children coming to their house and emerged as a brightly colored fairy tale witch. After a year which looks like it was full of abuse for Jack, its Halloween again and Bobbie decides to embrace the holiday. She develops an odd Hansel and Gretel act where she is the child eating witch and long suffering Jack is Hansel to entertain trick or treaters that isn't successful the first or fiftieth time. When a child is lost, Jack intervenes and calls for help instead of letting his wife have the child.

The style of the witch is a little more cartoonish than I would usually expect from Lucky McKee, but the harsh reality is in the abusive relationship between Jack and Bobbie. Bobbie isn't a literal witch, but it's how Jack pictures her when she unleashes her rage on him. As a result, he fears for any child they might have together. I felt the serious aspects were overshadowed by the light atmosphere and humor, but I still felt this segment was one of the best and most unique.

* This Means War

A man who has worked on his Halloween display for decades embraces old school horror with talking skeletons, spider webs, and other rather tame decorations. His neighbors are younger and choose to decorate in a much more gory, modern horror style complete with deafening heavy metal music. The younger people's display is more popular and older man finally snaps, insulting his competition and attacking them. The clash between two eras was interesting and shows how the horror community acts towards each other at times. There's room for both on Halloween and the horror genre. The ending is the logical conclusion to fights like this.

* Friday the 31st

This segment plays out like a parody of a slasher film. A scantily clad girl dressed as Dorothy runs from a masked killer and goes through the slasher rigmarole: finding a shed to hide in but of course it's where the killer keeps his cache of bodies! The unmasked killer looks like Jason and Leatherface had a baby. A visitor arrives and messes up this whole formula. While it was entertaining, again it was so cartoonish. It also borrows heavily from the Evil Dead, so the twist wasn't as surprising as it could have been.

* The Ransom of Rusty Rex

A couple of guys decide to kidnap a millionaire's kid for ransom. When they call to set up terms, the father hangs up on them multiple times. Confused, they quickly find out why he isn't interested to have his son back. This segment had some unexpected moments and great comic timing. John Landis makes a surprise appearance as the millionaire, which was fun to see. This is another segment that reminds me of Tales from the Crypt as the kidnappers get more than they bargained for.

* Bad Seed

A man makes a an amazing jack o'lantern, only to have it turn around and bite his head off! The killer pumpkin goes out into the night to find more victims. Detective McNally is on the case as a caricature of every cop ever on TV or film. She finds the killer pumpkin, but it may not be the only one. The balance of humor and horror is better in this segment. The blood and gore flies as cops have the ridiculous task of finding a killer pumpkin on Halloween when they are everywhere. It brings back nostalgia of Attack of the Killer Tomatoes but with a Halloween flair. I loved the ending and the Joe Dante cameo. I would actually want to see this one as a full film if the cops were less over the top,

Overall, Tales of Halloween is an enjoyable and well made anthology that runs more funny than scary. I would have preferred a little more darkness and a little less cartoonish. The stories are surprisingly cohesive and clearly all belong in the same universe. It's no Trick 'r Treat, which I deem the best Halloween anthology every, but it's a fun watch all the same.",1478736000,,7350,4.576864535768645

On top of the behind the scenes extras, commentaries, and cd soundtrack, there's also 8 more short films that I had just as much fun watching as the main film.

I rented it this time around, and wish I'd known I was going to like it this much, I would have just spent the few extra bucks to own it instead.

Named ""the best horror anthology since Trick 'r Treat"" by Fangoria and ""among the best Halloween-themed horror movies ever made"" by DailyDead, this critically acclaimed film weaves together ten chilling tales from horror's top directors. Ghosts, ghouls, monsters, and the devil delight in terrorizing unsuspecting residents of a suburban neighbourhood on Halloween night.

This is a great collection of short movies, the perfect Halloween night in movie for any horror fan, everything is here, laughs, blood and gore, trick or treaters beware on this night anything can happen in this neighbourhood! Each story is unique, some have a twist, some connect with others as they go, some are random, some are longer than others but overall its the most fun compilation ever so far for halloweeners, much better than trick or treat, the effects are really good throughout and the cast is all decent, make sure you check it out. This is a decent budget collection that's well worth the money especially as there are a great lot of features too.

7364876,3,B013HC8KO0,"This movie was fun and it had a lot of potential. I really liked where all the stories were heading. Many of the reviews said it was similar to Trick R' Treat and I agree, but one thing Trick R' Treat did was combine all the tales in one way or another to produce one great horror tale with many short ones. This movie fell short on combining them all together. It made many small, weak attempts, but at the end of the movie, I was ready for the key to tie everything together and it never came. All the instances where the stories bled into one another weren't really significant. It was just a tip of the hat that they were in the same universe as the other tales. The other tales didn't really effect one another as they do in Trick R' Treat. I know it's not fair to relate it to Trick R' Treat, but I feel the stories had enough potential to lead to be just as great, but it fell flat.

So definitely worth watching if you like Halloween Themed movies (which I do). That's the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2. I don't think it's worth the $4.99 rental fee. Definitely not worth the $7.99 to purchase. I'd wait for it to hit the $5 movie bins or I'm sure Chiller will get a hold of a censored version soon enough.",1471737600,,1227,4.091286307053942

Definitely had the vibe these were fans of horror behind the camera (I did like the sporadic nods to classic horror films/directors throughout), but the overall feel was too low budget without the gritty substance or offhand humor those referenced films had. Obviously, taste in horror is subjective & there were a few of the Tales that engaged & hit the mark, whether for laughs or otherwise, but overall kind of a bummer. The one with Dana Gould was solid.

7364924,1,B013HC8KO0,"Given some of the talent attached to Tales of Halloween, one had to think that there would be at least something of merit to be found in just one of its ten segments. This couldn't possibly be further from the reality.

As someone who enjoys anthology films like Trick r Treat and Creepshow, as well as the work of some of the writers/directors involved, I found shockingly little to appreciate about Tales of Halloween. It's a low-rent attempt at recreating Trick r Treat, only using a formula that calls for about a fifth of that film's charm and polish.

The acting is atrocious across the board; almost every actor tasked with carrying a segment fails miserably (no thanks to the wafer-thin characters and hideous writing), and the stunt-casted familiar faces uniformly sleepwalk their way to their paychecks.

The stories are completely inspid and tedious, which is particularly impressive considering that not even the work of Lucky McKee, John Skipp, or Neil Marshall manages to stand apart from the dregs. There's nothing clever, nothing memorable, nothing original, nothing frightening, and nothing funny here.

This is a film made by people who thought that all they needed to make a classic was some gore, some famous names, and a theme. It wants to stand as a love letter to EC Comics and Warren Publishing's magazines, but that letter winds up reading like masturbatory trunk stories from an adolescent that shouldn't have ever been allowed to see the light of day.

I love horror when it's done right. I love horror comedy when it's done right. I love horror anthologies with the right amount of black comedy when it's done right. Tales of Halloween is none of those things. It's just a bloated, disjointed mess rotting out on the front porch.

7364963,1,B013HC8KO0,"10 senseless, pointless mini-stories without atmosphere, without tension, without creativity, carelessly strung together without a linking frame - the comparison to the ingenious, masterly staged, original and skillfully interwoven Halloween episode film Trick or Treat is close, but not in the least appropriate. Trick or Treat: A1, Tales of Halloween: no way. And Trick or Treat is not ungory either, but that in a terrifically atmospheric, exciting and pleasantly creepy way. If I had wanted to watch senseless torture porn, I would have chosen psychopath Eli Roth`s Hostel etc., Tales of Halloween is miles away from Halloween horror fun. And PS: what's wrong with Hollywood, that it has no roles for Sam Witwer, so that he must star in trash like this?? 1 star for the cute Alien (however not for the story in which it appears, this is as bad as the others).",1446249600,,863,5.0

7364970,4,B013HC8KO0,"Entertaining Halloween themed anthology featuring 11 stories by 11 different directors that all take place on Halloween in the same town.  The linking elements that tell us this include Adrienne Barbeau doing a riff on her DJ character from The Fog, introducing many of the stories with her distinctive voice coming through an assortment of radios throughout the film and Night of the Living Dead, which seems to be playing in every house with a television set.  Like all anthology films this is a bit of a mixed bag but since it's a bigger budget effort than many and a union film to boot there are bigger name directors and also recognizable and vaguely recognizable actors scattered throughout.

The easiest segment to match with its director is by Mike Mendez (The Convent; The Gravedancers) and is called Friday the 31st.  It starts off like the last 10 minutes of every Friday the 13th movie ever made but then takes a hilariously bizarre turn.  The silliest is unexpectedly by Neil Marshall (The Descent; Dog Soldiers) called Bad Seed which is about a man-eating pumpkin and plays like a cross between a TV cop show parody and Little Shop of Horrors and features a Joe Dante cameo.  The most difficult to match to its director is the one by Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw 2-4; Mother's Day) called The Night Billy Raised Hell which is another funny one, this time involving a series of escalatingly violent Halloween pranks--who knew Bousman had a sense of humor?

Adam Gierasch (The Night of the Demons remake; Fertile Ground) directs Trick, which is one of the more serious segments about a group of children who go all Children of the Corn on a pair of couples getting drunk and high while watching Night of the Living Dead.  The segment seems kind of pointless until it isn't.  Lucky McKee (May; The Woman) delivers Ding Dong, easily the strangest segment.  It has something to do with spousal abuse, Hansel and Gretel and a very weird couple giving out candy and grossing out adorable, unsuspecting kiddies.  Ryan Schifrin (Abominable) delivers The Ransom of Rusty Rex, which is basically a horror comedy riff on the classic O Henry short story The Ransom of Red Chief.

The remaining stories make less of an impression.  Sweet Tooth by director Dave Parker (The Hills Run Red) involves a creepy Halloween story told to an impressionable kid.  Unfortunately the segment goes exactly where you expect, although it does have a decent punch-line.  The Weak and the Wicked by director Paul Solet (Grace) was my least favorite in the film and involves some bullies getting their violent comeuppance.  That one also goes exactly where you expect but the twist still managed to be confusing.  Grim Grinning Ghost by Axelle Carolyn (Soulmate) features another spooky Halloween story at its center, this one told to an easily spooked adult and manages to be genuinely creepy but, unfortunately, offers little in the way of a pay-off.

Tales of Halloween is ultimately a nice anthology film made by directors who are clearly fans of the horror genre for fans of the horror genre.  If you like Halloween (the holiday) and you like horror films then you should have fun with Tales of Halloween.  Some of the segments are noticeably better than others but this still qualifies as one of the most consistently entertaining horror anthologies that I've seen in years--much better than either the ABC's of Death or V/H/S series.  Hopefully there will be a sequel--and that's something I almost never say.",1446163200,,3494,4.868243243243243

Individual segments like ""Sweet Tooth,"" ""The Night Billy Raised Hell,"" ""Friday the 31st"" and ""Grimm Grinning Ghost"" are superb slices of wicked October madness.

7365013,4,B013HC8KO0,"Big recommendation for this film. Tales of Halloween is like Trick 'r Treat but (imo) better. It also has the spirit of Creepshow and Tales from the Crypt from the 1980s (and even the 1972 film), but, again, this was better. It's ten different stories, and a few (""Trick"" and ""The Weak and the Wicked"") don't really work, but most of them are successful to varying degrees, with a nice mix of comedy and horror. Eleven different directors worked on it but there's a consistency to the tone throughout and each chapter is a triumph of mis-en-scene, with Halloween costumes, decorations, and fog-filled streets flooding the screen. My favorite segment is ""The NIght Billy Raised Hell,"" which features a delicious turn from Barry Bostwick as the devil and the best ending of any chapter. There's also a segment, ""This Means War,"" that's a brilliant metaphor for the tension between the less is more horror crowd and the blood and guts crowd, with a suggestion that they need to co-exist or will destroy each other. Another chapter worth noting is the HILARIOUS one involving an extraterrestrial and a Jason-type character, entitled ""Friday the 31st."" There are homages to past horror greats (the ""Carpenter"" bar, gravestones for Val Lewton, Boris Karloff, James Whale, and Max Schreck) and Night of the Living Dead is being watched in at least half the segments.

It did a great job of getting you into the Halloween spirit as they went all out with the Holiday theme including costumes and decortations. There was some pretty good gore and some Campy splatter as well. It was a fun viewing experience and is sure to become a Halloween staple.

7365030,4,B013HC8KO0,"If you're set on needing all your short tales  to be neatly woven together, then you may enjoy Trick R' Treat a little more than this gem. Tales of Halloween is closer to the spirit of King and Romero's Creepshow and Creepshow 2 where there is a host (in this case, a radio DJ) introducing each segment, with a focus on ghoulish comedy, impending doom, and/or revenge. There are also some great nods to early 80s horror/thriller flicks (some more obvious than others). In my opinion, this anthology has a superior cast  to Trick R Treat's with faces that may be familiar to those who love the horror genre (both during its golden age and now).

There are two tales and the short run time for each segment that bump it down to a 4 from a 5. ""Friday the 31st"", although funny in an Evil Dead, over the top sort of way, seems to belong in another anthology film in terms of quality - think All Hallows Eve. The same could be said for ""This Means War"" - and while it does capture the spirit of old school v. new school Halloween celebrating, it just feels like a Tales from the Crypt episode. This is nitpicking though.

""Sweet Tooth"" ""Grim Grinning Ghosts"" and "" The Ransom of Rusty Rex"" are sure to become classics over time. Here's to hoping that the October Society (the group of filmmakers who collaborated to put this together) decides to reach out to the followers of this film for feedback. I believe it is that close to perfection in terms of Anthology flicks.

7365032,3,B013HC8KO0,"Im glad I saw it, but the films low budget and occasional bad acting really hurt the film.  Its not nearly as good or polished as trick r treat. Don't expect the same quality.  I liked the film but most segments are not that good. Only around four of the shorts are really good.  Like most critics have pointed out,  the film is afraid to be scary.  Its not scary in the slightest.  Its a missed opportunity as you can see some shorts start creepy, but then turn too comedic. It's more a comedy.  Again I recommend renting. Worth a view but hopefully the sequel will embrace more horror.",1445126400,3,587,4.330275229357798

This film reminds me of ""Trick 'R Treat,"" so if you liked that film, you will enjoy this one. My only problem was that my Blu-ray disc doesn't play in my Samsung player, but this has happened to me once before recently, so I think the problem is with my player. But it comes with a DVD version so I watched that disc.",1534550400,,417,4.160493827160494

I watched it twice in cinemas and Hell, I even pre-ordered the special collector's edition when I wasn't earning very well, because that's how much I love this movie. An extremely excellent horror anthology which is truly one of my favorites!!! This Bluray/DVD Boxset comes with a CD soundtrack and a Special Features DVD disc, with dozens of bonus materials with interviews, and short films featuring Kane Hodder, Malcolm McDowell, Michael Bailey Smith and more. I feel like a million bucks having this boxset in my collection, and it's definitely a must own if you're a collector of films!!!",1517961600,,1376,5.345622119815668
