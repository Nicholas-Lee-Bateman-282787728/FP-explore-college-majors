7875352,5,6304610149,"Claim Jumpers is a cut-down (condensed version) of Lucky Texan, a 1934 release starring John Wayne, Barbara Sheldon, Lloyd Whitlock, Yakima Canutt, and George Hayes.  This was before Hayes became known as ""Gabby"".  In addition to a title change, the new version is colorized and the running time is approximately 23 minutes.  In all respects this new version has much to recommend it.  The color is great particularly when you remember how drab some of the old black and white movies were.  Editing is miraculous considering the original length of Lucky Texan is 55 minutes.  Nothing seems lost from the original plot and with some new background music the story moves along at a fast pace.  John Wayne made many movies (mostly westerns) before his big break came with 1939's Stagecoach.  Claim Jumpers is representative of his early work and very entertaining.",1355184000,,861,5.014084507042254

7875354,5,6304610149,"I enjoyed seeing these old John Wayne short movies.  They have been remastered and the jitters and spots removed.  The colorization is among the best I've seen and is very well done.  The three movies have been renamed; but, the original titles are in parenthesis on the back cover.

Hokey plots, romance only hinted at, and direct, if stilted, dialog make these a real look at the 1930s movie making standards.  Romance is only hinted at as was common then.  Westerns haven't changed much since then though techniques and production values have gotten better.

Some of these contain horse riding stunts that would look well today by the best person in the business, Yakima Canutt.

A good look at the 30s B-westerns for those not of that era.",1172707200,3,743,4.75
7875355,3,6304610149,"The Young Duke series has taken existing B westerns of John Waynes, changed the titles, digitized and colorized them. For collectors it's not correct. If you just want to see the Duke in the old days, they did a good job re-making the old film.",1140998400,3,244,4.444444444444445
7875356,5,6304610149,"The old Lone Star(Poverty Row)films by the young John Wayne were difficult to watch as they all seem to be staid versions of the other B westerns. But UAV has improved on these films by an almost total overhaul of the features. The films were edited down to 20 or so minutes to make the stories tighter and more taut. Thus the ""lagging"" portions were eliminated. The applied colorization is top notch as the colors are brilliant and lifelike. The renditions doesn't have the effect of the old colorized versions. The sound has improved especially with the presence of background music and better sound effcts (gunfire doesn't flat). Thus, the revided edition no longer has the feel of a poverty row production but a top notch B western. Now, even the youthful John Wayne's looks as if he can really act!  Congratulations to all those involved in the project.",1056672000,8,858,4.758389261744966
