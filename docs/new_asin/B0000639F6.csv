Well, personally, I think this DVD is SO AWESOME!! It's a need-to-get for ALL Aaron and Nick fans! The Carter bro's are so hilarious and so cute!! lol They just show ya they're like normal people (and bro's) too and also show both of their wonderful talents! My personal favorite is when Nick sings ""Heaven"" by Bryan Adams :) He sounds really amazing!! Anyways, if you don't have this DVD or VHS tape, then GET IT!! It's worth all your money! It's awesome!! :)",1030924800,,465,4.482352941176471

1688138,5,B0000639F6,"This is an AWESOME DVD!!!  It has Aaron performing songs from his concert in baton rouge in 2001.  The songs that are form his concert in order are Life is a party, Get wild, Iko Iko, Bounce, I need you tonight(sung solo by nick), Not too young, not too old(w/ nick), Tell me what you want, Real good time, I'm all about you, Shake it, Bryan Adams' Heaven(sung by nick), AC's Alien Nation, Oh Aaron(w/ nick), I want candy, Thats how i beat shaq, and Aaron's party.  Then there are 3 music videos, Leave it up to me(from jimmy neutron), i'm all about you, and oh aaron.  The only thing that upset me about this DVD was that the music video ""Not too young, not too old"" wasn't included.  Finally there are extra features with nick and aaron talking about their careers, relationship as brothers, etc, and a bonus interview with aaron.  I enjoyed this video because unlike some of the other live concert DVD's I have seen, this one was clear and well recorded.  The concert itself was outstanding, with amazing special effects, and really showing off aaron's talent.  If you like aaron and his music, you will love this DVD.  And how could you not like aaron?  He is such a hottie!!!  Go buy this DVD, i know you'll love it!!!",1018310400,8,1223,4.439461883408072
1688139,5,B0000639F6,"Most of this video was shown as Aaron's Valentine's Day Party on Pay-Per-View.  A few scenes with Aaron & Nick were added but some were also taken out.  The awesome, awesome performance by Aaron and Nick singing - Girl you Knock me out(unsure of song name?)was not included.  Also the part where Aaron brought the mayor on stage and crowned him with that HUGE cowboy hat was left off.  To the videos benefit, the full ""Leave it Up To ME"" video was included and also the ""I'm All About You"" video.  There was additional footage added of Nick and Aaron on a boat and, well, off the boat.
For those who didn't see the Pay-Per-View special, let's just say Aaron threw a massive party for (after)Valentine's Day and this tape will take you there.  Not only does it have footage from the concert which includes a few solo numbers by Nick, but you also get to tag-a-long with Aaron as he rides an airboat, eats at Mulate's, picks up Nick-in-disguise at the airport, and returns to Mulate's for a jam session with the house band.
Ok buy the video because it has plenty of Aaron antics you won't want to miss and he'll take you to extreme emotional levels-high and low. My children and I have watched it so much, we even found what we say is a glitch but you'll have to find out for yourself.  Just watch the shoes while he's on the airboat.  :)",1018137600,,1336,4.380566801619433
1688140,5,B0000639F6,"Hey! Let me just tell all the fans, this video is going to be the BEST VIDEO EVER!! It contains Aaron's summer concert and his PPV Valentine's Day concert, if not more! And of course, backstage footage and skits he does. It's gonna be SO HILARIOUS! Knwoing that Nick will be in it too! So I incourage you to BUY THIS TAPE WHEN IT COMES OUT!!!! Those two boys are the SEXIEST EVER! What's more perfect? A guy for the younger teens (Aaron)and a guy for the older teens (Nick)!! They're both VERY multi-talented and GOSH DANG GORGEOUS!! So how can you not love them? Well also remember to go get Nick's album ""Before The Boys: 1989-1993"" also Tuesday, March 26th (NOT August 31st)!! Well, KTBSPA and KTACPA!! Peace!
Luv,

7958753,1,B0000639F6,"You should NEVER considering buying this DVD! It's a complet waste of money! Aaron Carter is just a pretty good looking guy, he is NOT good at singing, he actually suck at singing. He never stop hyperventilating during the WHOLE concert. I can't even listen to what he sing. Absolutely HORRIBLE!!",1106092800,3,296,4.823529411764706
7958754,5,B0000639F6,"If you LOVE Aaron Carter or even just started liking him, I totally recommend this DVD! It is so cool and funny. It includes Aaron performing live PLUS the videos: ""Oh Aaron"", ""Leave it up to me"", ""Not Too Young, Not Too Old"", and ""I'm All About You"". Also special guests are Backstreet brother Nick Carter and No Secrets. Not to mention the fact that they show Aaron backstage and they have interviews with Nick AND Aaron! (Pssst! They even show them shirtless on their boat swimming!) This DVD rocks! I love it so much and I'm so glad I bought it. You will be, too.",1083888000,4,567,4.3584905660377355
7958755,5,B0000639F6,I love this dvd so much if you like aaron and have a dvd playrer you have to get this. Aaron is so cute! My friend is lending it to me while she is away in CA. I really think you should get this!,1041033600,3,195,3.4545454545454546
7958756,4,B0000639F6,"Aaron Carter reminds me of young entertainers/rappers back in a time where they were only interested in making sure you have a good time. Not making music for personal therapy. Everybody else is so busy airing their dirty laundry or cleaning out their closets.  My only pet peeve is that Aaron needed to take more breaks in between sets, however, so as not to compromise the quality of his voice.  The video break featuring ""I'm all about you"" is Aaron Carter at his best! The Jimmy Neutron single ""Leave it up to me"" is another favorite!",1032998400,,538,4.59375
7958757,5,B0000639F6,"I bought this video about a week ago, and watched it with my best friend. We are both big Backstreet Fans and are avid Aaron fans too. I rememeber being in the store, looking at it, and thinking..""Is this worth buying, I mean, am I going to watch it over and over and over again?"" Turns out, I was at the cashier, ready with a bank card! I took it home, and my best friend was going to stay the night at my house. We watched the video, and believe me....We were crazy over it! Aaron had up tempo songs and dances to go along with it. He always kept the crowd hyped and was having a great time! It was definately noticeable. To be honest...My favourite parts were when Nick did his solo thing. He sang 'I Need You Tonight' which is one of my favourite Backstreet songs. He also did a cover of 'Heaven' He did an AMAZING job! It was really, really, great! When Aaron and Nick performed together, it was a comedy act in the making. I found this video very entertaining. It also includes a few of Aaron's newest music videos..Which I never got to see on TV. So I give this a thumbs-up! Good job Aaron and Nick! Can't wait for the next!",1031011200,,1131,4.168949771689498
