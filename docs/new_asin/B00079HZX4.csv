8046258,1,B00079HZX4,"The product road kings was straight garbage. Whoever produced it need there tail kicked across the united states, im not gonna say that other word. It seems hard enough now a days to find a decent movie that you haven't heard of. You might as well stick with what you know or have already seen otherwise its TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!.",1252368000,,325,4.620689655172414
8046259,1,B00079HZX4,"This is one of the dumbest film I ever had the displeasure to watch. The story goes at follow: two gangbangers go on a joyride across the States. They act like a complete caricature of African-Americans and end-up with more trouble than they started with. The scenario seems to include the pretense that all Caucasians out there are racists while blatantly excluding the behavior of the ""Heroes"".

The music is nice but it doesn't buy back this pathetic excuse of ""Black Beavis & Butthead on Wheels"". Way too Ghetto to waste this film on a pristine, virgin DVD disk. Waste of money.",1236124800,,582,4.705882352941177
8046260,1,B00079HZX4,"this movie was filmed years ago, and it shows. it was shot on 16mm film, not 35, and overall the movie doesn't ""look"" good. they got snoop dogg to do a song for them, and im pretty sure a large portion of the budget went to just that (I heard 70K).

the actors are decent, but the writing, directing and poor continuity damage any good aspects of the film. There is nothing that makes you care for the characters in the film, there is no sense of purpose... at all.

this movie is horrible, im surprised they even were able to sell it to artisan and get it released... congratulations for that.",1132272000,5,594,4.294642857142857
8046261,1,B00079HZX4,"Not sure what movie the other reviewer watched, but all I can say is the movie was pointless. One word sums it up GAWBAGE!",1114387200,,122,4.125
8046262,5,B00079HZX4,"i watched this movie and at first i thought, ok a waste of rental fee, but the longer i watched it the better it got. the music really makes the movie give it a try u might just like it to",1112486400,3,188,3.6097560975609757
