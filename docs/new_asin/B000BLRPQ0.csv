its a fine video about the work and life of john Szarkowski.

material quality:
the quality of the video is fine ( not HD)
the quality of the DVD itself is also fine ( not the best ) or the one someone would have expected from a professional product.
the case is  also fine.

8088680,4,B000BLRPQ0,"This is an enthralling documentary about one of the most important photography curators of all time.
The film is  a must have for all serious photographers. It is enlightening to hear Szarkowski speak candidly about all of the photographers he helped to discover such as Winogrand, Arbus, Lartigue and Eggleston, the short footage of Winogrand working is particularly interesting. There are some great interviews with American Photographers, Tom Roma & Joel Meyerowitz speaking about Szarkowski, they are very acute and eloquent, Meyerowitz inparticular has an absorbing way with words.
Szarkowski comes across as approachable and unpretentious with a great sense of humour.
This film is a well-earned tribute to him. I can't recommend it enough.",1163030400,17,746,5.48695652173913
