6086700,5,B00GMM19QE,"Shunned is a sad movie, but appears to be a fairly accurate portrayal of some of the conflicts within this religious group that has become so popular in recent times.  We live in western NY and there are a number of Amish settlements in our area.  We shop at their stores and see them in their buggies.  I think the movie is worthwhile as a documentary and informational view, but if you're feeling depressed with all the winter weather, you might want to wait until a cheerful Spring day to watch it!",1395100800,4,501,4.423913043478261
6086701,5,B00GMM19QE,"As a documentary type show, it dealt with some of the complications of leaving the only life they've never known and losing the family connections.  However, these were people who had some help, who were able to find work and yet some still returned home after a time because of the largely missing family and community connection.  Even we ""Englisha's"" have a hard time in this messed up world and we don't always have family to fall back on and definitely not the community.  The Amish have a tightly committed relationship and that's hard to give up.  I totally understand their reason for the shunning; not to hurt the person, but to make them realize what they've given up and to come back home.  If you are at all interested in the Amish, this is worth watching.",1395100800,3,768,4.576642335766423
6086702,4,B00GMM19QE,"This is the second PBS program (and David) on The Amish. The previous one The Amish  released in August 2012 (See my review on Amazon) was an hour. This one is 2 hours (well, a bit less because of PBS commercials).

This time the story is about those members of the Amish Community who decide to leave and join the outside world. Some come back; others dont. While some taste the outside during Rumspringa  a period, usually at age 16, when the teenagers are allowed to leave for short periods of time  most of those interviewed here are Amish who just decided to leave on their own  usually sneaking out of the house at midnight or when they wouldnt be noticed.

Because Amish do not like to be photographed, we get to see the faces of those interviewed who chose not to return to the community and have been shunned, but not those who chose to return. Director Callie T. Wiser uses long shots to show us the Amish and the beautiful farms they maintain.

While I found this show interesting, I felt that two hours was a bit too long and that the previous hour-long show was better edited.  But thats my person opinion. Living just an hour away from the Amish communities in Lancaster County, PA, I find any story about them worth watching.

The DVD has no bonus materials.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful

6086703,4,B00GMM19QE,"This film focuses on seven individuals who, initially at least, ran away from their Amish groups. Shunning (social rejection of a sinful individual until (s)he repents) is supposed to follow when a member runs away, but the film to me is more about the act of running away, its rationale and repercussions. Two perspectives then are given: that of the Amish family and that of the departed child. Since the Amish do not permit filmed interviews, we get the perspective of the Amish family from voices throughout the narrative. The recurring family themes are obedience, submission, rules, knowing your place, and trusting the wisdom of the group. There are a few glimpses of a family's pain--a father talking about a ""heavy heart"" and a mother noting she may have made mistakes--but emotions are generally suppressed. I can't say that the film gives much insight into the ""pain that the family feels when a loved one breaks away,"" as the editorial review claims. But such pain can be inferred.

From the perspective of the runaways, we do get some clearer depiction of emotions--the loss of close-knit families, childhood memories, a few letters saved from parents. While very few of them regret their decision to leave, all have muted, mournful moments when they discuss what has been left behind.

I think the documentary actually overdoes the mournful tone. The background music, while pensive in tone, can seem like an ongoing dirge. Yes, there are joyful moments in the film--a young woman in awe of her new picture ID, a charity dinner for an Amish scholarship fund, a young man buying his first car and then quietly acknowledging that living away from Amish society is actually ""awesome."" One couple has a basement apartment for Amish young people trying to adjust to a larger world. But the father also speaks of his struggle to find a spiritual anchor in the larger world (he returned seven times before finally leaving), an anchor not found in traditions or rules. This same individual recounts his own reconciliation with his father 25 years after leaving the Amish community.

The documentary has chosen seven individuals with different experiences. One is still living in a quasi-Amish lifestyle. Another was never shunned by her family after leaving. Two are older individuals who now provide support for Amish who have left the community. At the end, one of the individuals is returning; it is not clear for how long, but she has a suitcase in hand.

Certainly an excellent documentary, with emotion that is low-key but profound; we can read in faces what is not expressed audibly. However, I do find the sense of loss too sustained and unvaried a tone.",1392163200,9,2668,4.935412026726058

No matter how you slice or dice the stories, it is hell for those kids who have the strength and support to leave. They pay the price for many years after they leave their family unit. No support i.e.: financial, emotional, housing, food and transportation. I don't think I could do it and start a new life.",1462579200,3,407,4.355263157894737

If you will accept it that way, and just think about the lives of the people who are contributing, you will gain some of the spirit of the dilemma facing Amish who decide to leave. It won't answer a lot of the questions you might have, but it can't do everything.",1457395200,2,353,4.2835820895522385

6086736,1,B00GMM19QE,Kept watching hoping for it to get interesting and reveal something shocking or unexpected. It doesn't. It just plods along and doesn't inform you about the basic facts.

6086739,3,B00GMM19QE,"This movie was good as far as it went.  What with the TV shows on the past couple years we learned a lot about Amish leaving the nest, although you wonder how much of that TV stuff is hyped up just for ratings.  I grew up around the Amish and really didn't know much about them, and must admit that some of what they do is a bit strange.  They don't have electricity, yet it is ok to use propane to power ovens and other appliances.  They won't own or drive a car but will hire people to drive them places and to jobs.  They don't have a phone in the house yet a lot of them have a communal phone booth somewhere in the community that they can use. My dad hired them to install a new roof on the house.  Someone drove them to work every day and they used power tools. The whole shunning issue is hard for most people to comprehend. This movie served as a small snapshot of the lifestyle and religion.",1454889600,6,900,4.056497175141243

Where I live in the Midwest there are various types of Amish folk and it is always interesting to see what lines are drawn where. Can they have a cell phone? Some can, and similar things like that, so I am interested in learning more about the lives of these families. In this instance there is a very surprising and sad moment when a young girl finds out there are no more men to be chosen from at a very young age. I won't spoil it but she has to decide to leave and seek companionship in the outside world, or stick it out as a 20 something ""old maid"".

It just shows you that in a world where outside influence is strictly limited, life is still very, very complicated and really about the choices we make.",1445558400,4,775,4.272108843537415

Also interesting in the film is the family who converted to the Amish lifestyle.  Shunning is not new but it never amazes me that a family would totally sever family ties with those who become unhappy with the restrictive Amish lifestyle and gather the courage to leave.",1443139200,,378,4.984126984126984
6086763,3,B00GMM19QE,"This film seemed angry. Punishing. It was clouded by what seemed to be a deliberately, stubbornly blinkered point of view, not allowing for any other possibility of a perspective other than the one put forward in the dominant narrative. It felt oppressive to me--forcing me as a viewer into agreeing with the filmmakers' very specific opinions. There did not appear to be room for compassion or love in this film. Which, to me, is actually necessary for a film, and a skilled filmmaker. To not only understand other points of views but to allow for life to be breathed into them. Otherwise, a documentary can feel like aggressively fed perspective, forcing the viewer against the wall to accept unquestioning, in this case, how awful the Amish are. Ironically, when a film is so lacking in nuance that it becomes claustrophobic, I personally find myself skeptical of what the filmmaker is trying to get me to believe. It feels like borderline propaganda. In this case, frankly, that all religions are instruments of control and repression. While, to me, the film seemed to use the same controlling tactics--crowding the film with ideology and not encouraging open-ended reflection or critical thinking.",1436832000,,1202,5.075757575757576

It was very informative and touching as you followed many people and their story of how and why they sought a life outside of their Amish community. It completely held my attention as I was interested in what choices they made on whether or not to return.

In many documentaires, the subjects either wander lost and dejected or jump off the deep end in bad company. It struck me that spiritually, in terms of being at peace with God, many of these people have found the real and better thing. Instead of letting adherence to external regulations determine their peace, they have realized that access to heaven isn't about what we do, but what God has already done for us in Jesus Christ.",1417219200,,592,4.98989898989899

For a person to leave his or her family's religion is a worldwide societal tabu, no matter where a person lives or what religion he or she was born into. This film focuses on the Amish community in a very nicely shot and well-told documentary.

People of all types of faiths are often reluctant to leave the religion of their family because ""shunning"" occurs in various degrees and forms everywhere. Everyone needs to find God for herself or himself. The problem is that people get so caught up in their religion and pleasing their religious peers, God get's buried beneath the religious self-made rules of man. It takes courage to go beyond what one has always been taught and to seek God in the purity of Spirit and truth -- straight from the heart. The young people in this film display a choice and courage that is rare. I hope they all find their way home.",1414368000,,905,4.5182926829268295

We also hear the voices of those who remain and the importance of obedience and how the power of shunning if done with the true love of god is effective. There are also some revealing thoughts from those who have left- their frustration with rules and punishments for noncompliance, such as the wrong folds in a prayer cap.

Most interesting are the stories of those who have left the Amish community and provide shelter and homes for those who runway from their Amish families.

We see how families are torn, some never to speak or see their children again, and others who do and are chastised. Then we are also told that if they are in need they can be helped but the shunning is still there.

What sets this documentary apart is that it looks at people at all points in the Amish experience.  It has audio of interviews of current Amish (no video, obviously), as well as videos of those that have left and have already been shunned or are still waiting to.  I won't tell you who and how many of the ex-Amish decide to go back (if any), but it shows the difficult decision they face.  Imagine being completely cut off of all family and everything you know.  It doesn't pretend to tell the viewer what the ""right"" decision is.  Highly recommended.",1512864000,,678,4.508196721311475

The people helping those shunned are wonderful.  The woodwork in some of the houses was like a work of art.  I'll definitely watch again if just for the locations they show.  And the dogs were so cool as well as the horses.  Beautiful gardens and houses.  The Christmas tree ornaments that are hand-made just rock.

8624646,5,B00GMM19QE,"I thought the slow pace of the movie worked well with the subject material of people coming from a slower-paced life without all the fancy 'bells and whistles.'  As a Christian I can relate with the Amish conviction to be set apart from the world, so I've always felt a sort of kinship with them although I don't agree with all of their beliefs.  This movie provided a rare insight into the hearts and minds of those brought up in the very-private Amish lifestyle and I appreciate them sharing their stories with us.  It implores the viewer to consider what matters most in life.",1510617600,,579,4.548076923076923
8624647,5,B00GMM19QE,"Ive always secretly envied the Amish. I grew up in secular southern CA, and am in my mid-50s and personally I could have done without when it comes to about 2/3rds of my life experiences. I have done a lot of amazing things, but so much time was wasted on things that mean nothing in eternity. I know some people consider the Amish to be extreme and cultish, and I suppose some came to watch to confirm their bias, but one would have to understand biblical Christianity to see the way the Amish live as valuable.

I go back and forth between wishing I had just been born into an Amish family and being thankful for my life experience. I couldn't tell people about Christ if I were Amish, I couldn't minister to those that have no hope. On the other hand, I would have remained almost completely untarnished by the world if I did grow up Amish.

You may understand shunning if you want to understand that they don't want ""the world"" as an integral part of their household. This should be fairly obvious due to how they live from day to day.

Personally, I find it impossible to ""judge"" either side, as I have much love and respect for both, and am happy that there are those that have left the Amish community and continue to follow Christ. They most certainly will be a MUCH needed Light to this world.",1510012800,5,1302,4.371900826446281
8624648,4,B00GMM19QE,"I found this video very moving.  While it was definitely focused on those who left, I liked that the video also interviewed some of the current Amish to get an understanding of why they shun.  While I can't agree with them, it helps to understand where this comes from.",1506038400,,269,4.469387755102041
8624649,5,B00GMM19QE,"This is a very nice cultural portrayal. I would have liked to have heard some of their church services or known some reasons for their dress codes, eschewing of modern farm machinery, etc. and why they do not see these things as blessings from their god, etc. People from conservative religions who have left, especially the cut religions, can easily relate. I know I did. A follow up of what more time brings to these people who have left and even returned would be nice.",1505520000,3,472,4.564705882352941
