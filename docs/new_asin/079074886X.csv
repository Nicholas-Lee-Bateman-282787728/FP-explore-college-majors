119800,5,079074886X,"Be warned, this is not your typical Bogart movie if all you are used to is Casablanca and the Maltese Falcon, however it is highly recommended if you want to see Bogart in a different type of role, and don't mind him being not as noble as some of his other films portray him.",1211068800,,275,4.111111111111111
119801,4,079074886X,The movie provides a perspective of wartime France that one does not usually see. The film was made when the outcome of the war was not decided. One also sees some of the conflicts experienced by citizens caught up in war. It therefore provided an alternative perspective of the French- they are not all quitters. They are still fighting. The movie is definitely not politically correct. One sees altruism and self sacrifice next to retribution. One sees wise and stupid formal leadership. One sees the strength of informal leadership. One sees the exercise of judgement by officials who know when to adhere to the spirit of the law and when to ignore the letter of the law in deference to the spirit of the law.,1206403200,,712,4.704
119802,5,079074886X,"Michael Curtiz proved with ""The charge of  the light brigade""  and ""Captain blood"", he loved to bet for epic films,  and in this opportunity, just one year before Casablanca, hired to Bogart as the leader of a bunch of convicts who fervently will make all what they can to escape from the ""Devil Island"". It's useless the dramatis personae is focused on the insights of these men who wish join themselves to resistance forces in favor of France.",1188086400,3,445,4.67948717948718
119803,5,079074886X,"Distributed in 1944, the movie reassembles many of the original cast from ""Casablanca""- Bogart, Lorre, Greenstreet and Rains to produce a fascinating movie. The movie represents a microcosm of 1940 France. Each of the characters brings to life a France conflicted. Bogart plays Matrac a crusading journalist who opposes the policy of appeasement with Nazi Germany. For his pains he is beaten and thrown in prison (""Devil's Island"") on a trumped up charge of murder. He is bitter and at the beginning indifferent to France's fate. However, he escapes from Devil Island with the aid of an aging freed prisoner who swears each of the escaping convicts to ""fight for France!"" Matrac and his fellow convicts escape Cayenne but find themselves stranded at sea in a small canoe. Saved by a French ship carrying nickel ore they find their safety far from secure. On board is a colonial officer played by Sydney Greenstreet. He is the arch typical representative of what would become Vichy- overbearing, mutable in his beliefs, opportunistic. Claude Rains plays a patriotic officer committed to France's eventual victory over the Nazi Germany. While the ship proceeds on its journey home, events in France become apparent to the crew. First Germany invades France, then the news arrives that France's armies are in rout, finally the dismaying news that Marshall Petain had formed a new government in Vichy and had agreed to an armistice with Germany. Suddenly the dynamics change. Quickly Greenstreet and his followers seize control of the ship. They emerge as committed supporters of Vichy. The convicts, the ship's captain and Rains fight to take the ship to England and fight on.

One can watch this movie for sheer enjoyment and adventure. However, one can watch this for its historical value in explaining the deep pain and division that faced France in 1940.",1168992000,44,1855,5.062091503267974
119804,5,079074886X,"Bogey at his best. He plays French newspaper reporter Jean Matrac who is framed on a murder charge after criticizing the Munich Pact in an editorial and sentenced to Devil's Island.  He and a small group of convicts escape in a canoe when they learn of the Nazis invading France, ostensibly wishing to fight for their country. (Matrac merely wants to get home to his new bride and cares nothing about France after the way he was treated by its justice system.) They are picked up at sea by a French cargo ship bound for Marseilles and have numerous adventures aboard the ship including an air attack by a Nazi bomber and a mutiny.  Arriving in England as France has surrendered before they reach Europe, all of the former convicts join the Free French Air Force. Matrac becomes a waist gunner aboard one of their B-17 bombers despite his misgivings about his homeland.  I never fail to cry at the end, as many times as I have watched this movie since I was a boy. Absolutely incredible movie.",1164240000,,992,4.561797752808989
119805,3,079074886X,"If TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT was a direct descendent of CASABLANCA, then this picture too was an attempt to cash in on the success (or parts of it) of that beauty. But it's a poor relative. Told as a flashback within a flashback, a group of convicts escapes from Devil's Island in order to go to France to fight the Nazis; their leader is Bogie who confesses he doesn't really want to go back to France to fight, but rather for a woman. But of course his conscience is put to the test and he gets his thinking straightened out. This scene, which takes place on a ship under enemy air attack, and the earlier scenes in the first flashback when Bogie's in Paris with his girl, are right out of CASABLANCA. But Michelle Morgan is no Ingrid Bergman, though Peter Lorre, Claude Rains, and Sidney Greenstreet (as a heavy) all appear again. The ending, when Rains reads a letter from the now-dead Bogie to his wife about Free France rising up to defeat the Germans, is pure sentimental propaganda. Not nearly as good as the earlier movies mentioned.",1114560000,,1037,4.463157894736842
119806,5,079074886X,"Yes, it's dated all right-in the best sense: it's got virtually the same cast and crew as ""Casablanca""(though Michele Morgan is no Ingrid Bergman, lovely though she is-and as someone else pointed out, hers *is* a thankless role in an all-male film). It's full of action, suspense, atmosphere(the famous huge tank built on a WB sound stage a few years earlier really comes in handy, as much of the action takes place on ships and boats)-and humor, to temper the super-patriotic slant of the plot-after all, it was mid-war, and it was total war. Even so, Bogart's character is allowed to be somewhat ambivilent, which makes for a suprisingly timely impression all these years later.  There are situations and dialogue which with any other cast would be unbearably corny, but in the capable hands of such as Bogie, Claude Rains, Greenstreet and Lorre, they're memorable, sometimes priceless moments.  One example:  On the eve of their escape, huddled in the dark next to a campfire, aged Devil's Island prisoner ""Grandpere"", suspects his fellow escapees(especially Bogart) might be less than sincere, and thinks he ought to elicit something more binding than a simple promise that they'll all fight for ""La France"" when they reach freedom.  With perfect comic timing, Peter Lorre whines incredulously: ""Do you want us to say our beads?!"".  Takes the corn right out of the sentimental scene.

 This film is famous for containing ""a flashback within a flashback WITHIN a flashback!"" as film writer Leslie Halliwell pointed out in his book; it's nevertheless a slam-bang piece of entertainment.",1097539200,14,1588,5.108108108108108

119808,5,079074886X,"I'll admit, I wasn't expecting much from this film when I saw it. I checked it out because it reunites the core crew of Casablanca; Michael Curtiz back as director, Humphrey Bogart, Claude Rains, Peter Lorre and Syndey Greenstreet all come back to a World War II movie that once again doesn't take place on any battlefields or any locations of infamy. The thing is, this movie is so great that you'll wonder for a moment if it can really be this good, if they could possibly re-create the magic of Casablanca, but do it in such a completely different, but altogether touching way.
They did. This movie is 5 movies all packed into one. The story of the french patriots and how they got put on Devil's Island, how they escaped to go fight for their country, their run-in and interaction with a french ship filled with military out to expose them and send them back, and their fight against the Germans. It's a mirror aimed at a mirror, because one story inevitably bleeds into another into another into another and the sheer courage of such complex screenwriting and confident directing is one of the many reasons to seek this out.
This movie also has heart. The story of Bogart's love affair with both France and his wife and son is just as powerful as the French struggle to fight the Germans and regain their homeland. From the first frame to the last, it's a film riddled with emotions and real characters with actual hearts and joy and sorrow and triumph. Plus, there is a ton of action, from machine-guns against airplanes to escaping from treacherous jungles to air-raids against the enemy.
Enough cannot be said about this extremely underrated classic. Bogart fans and Casablanca fans alike will be kicking themselves that they've gone so long without experiencing this almost essential companion piece to the film widely-regarded (and rightly so) as a classic of filmmaking and storytelling.",971395200,26,1898,4.789634146341464
119809,4,079074886X,"Long before Sean Connery broke into Alcatraz in _The Rock_, Bogart managed to escape from Devil's Island armed only with ingenuity, patriotic fervour,  and a slightly dubious French accent and Gallic mannerisms, in order to  fight the nazis in WW2. One of the most controversil scenes finds him  machine-gunning some krauts who're waving a white flag and asking who the  real murderers are. It's an underrated film, not Bogies best war movie, but  certainly worth a look",967766400,3,470,5.0519480519480515

119812,3,079074886X,"Sometimes flashbacks work (though I prefer not to have them at all) but in this movie I feel that they made it a little too disjointed in the telling (including a flashback within a flashback; it may even go deeper than that but I lost track).  The movie is about French prisoners in South America who want to get back to France to fight the Nazis.  It's not a bad movie, I just think it could have been restructured.  Bogart is good and Peter Lorre had that something special about him that would make reading a tube of toothpaste interesting.  I rate it a solid 3 stars, and depending on the weather, day of the week, and time of day, maybe 3.5 stars.",1484697600,3,653,4.284552845528455

119820,4,079074886X,"Passage to Marseille stars Humphrey Bogart as Jean Matrac, a World War II French patriot who escapes Devils Island, survives a dangerous freighter voyage, and becomes a gunner in the Free French Air Corps. The film re-teams Bogart with many of the actors from Casablanca, made the year before  Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet. Both this picture and Casablanca were directed by Michael Curtiz.

Passage to Marseille portrays characters in a conflicted France. Matrac is a crusading journalist who opposes a policy of appeasement with Nazi Germany. Like Rick in Casablanca, initially Matrac is concerned only with his own fate and indifferent to Frances. For his outspoken efforts, he is beaten and imprisoned on a false charge of murder. Rains plays a patriotic officer committed to Frances eventual victory over Germany, while Greenstreet portrays Major Duval, a cowardly and opportunistic colonial officer who represents what would become the Nazi-friendly Vichy government. Peter Lorre is Marius, one of Matracs fellow escaped convicts.

In addition to Curtizs direction, the film benefits from a solid script and a collection of first-rate performances. At times, it tries too hard to copy the Academy Award-winning Casablanca, but its great to see the cast re-teamed in this patriotic wartime drama.

Special features on the Blu-ray release include a vintage newsreel, the Oscar-winning patriotic short I Wont Play, the Oscar-nominated musical short Jammin the Blues, the cartoon The Weakly Reporter, the featurette The Free French: Unsung Victors, and a Warner Bros. studio blooper reel.",1455321600,2,1610,5.453815261044177

119825,4,079074886X,"Warner Brothers Studios made a lot of propaganda films during WWII(1941-45) in order to boast morale back home and enlisted many of it's top stars to help with this effort none more so than Humphrey Bogart. Trying to breakout of his gangster image, Bogart's film career changed dramatically when he did ""Casablanca""(1942) the film he is most remembered for. Trying to repeat that success, Warner's brought most of the production team and actors responsible for ""Casablanca"" back together two years later in ""Passage to Marseille""(1944) but the results were not as they expected. Although the film was a success at the box office and was a prime example of the wartime propaganda films made in Hollywood at this time it lacked the one thing that made ""Casablanca"" so memorable: romance. When it comes to romance it doesn't get any better than Bogart and Bergman. Despite all this, ""Passage to Marseille"" is top notch film making and Warner's(through it's Archive Collection) has now brought it to Blu-ray for the first time and the results are very impressive. Re-mastered in 2K from a fine grain master positive print, ""Passage"" looks nearly pristine(Bitrate: 34.99) and is a definite improvement over the standard DVD. There are no vertical lines, white specks, torn or damaged frames and fans of Bogart will certainly want to add this new Blu-ray title to their Bogart collection. Because the story itself is told mainly in flashbacks there is a certain discontinuity throughout the film but Director Michael Curtiz keeps everything moving at an even pace. ""Passage"" was photographed by the great cinematographer James Wong Howe and his B & W images are just stunning on Blu-ray. Nighttime scenes are most impressive with deep blacks and minimal lighting focusing on the actor's faces that are so sharp and detailed that viewers can really feel their emotions. Although most of the film takes place at night, daylight scenes are just as impressive with both interior and exterior scenes being crystal clear and vivid. Miniature set designs, planes and ships are easy to spot now on Blu-ray but do not distract from the film. Costumes, props, and full scale sets are are equally impressive including the full size replica cargo ship that rescues Bogart and his fellow convicts.  The Audio(English DTS-HD MA 2.0 mono) is clear and free of any noise artifacts(hiss, pop, etc.) with gunfire and explosions being very realistic(and loud). Most of the actors from ""Casablanca"" were reunited for ""Passage"" and they all give great performances with Bogart's performance as a French convict trying to redeem himself after being wrongly accused of murder being one of his best. He gets great support from Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Claude Rains, Helmut Dantine and George Tobias. Michelle Morgan is Bogart's love interest(and wife) in the film. ""Passage to Marseille"" is 109 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.37:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. There are many special features including: 1) Warner Night at the Movies;  2) Vintage Newsreel; 3) two shorts subjects including ""Jammin' the Blues"" with sax great Lester Young among other jazz performers; 4) a featurette about the Free French; 5) Breakdowns of 1944 blooper reel; 6) a vintage Warner cartoon; and 7) two theatrical trailers. The Blu-ray disc itself is housed in a solid standard blu-ray case(not an eco-cutout case). Although it might not rank high on the list of great Humphrey Bogart films, ""Passage to Marseille"" is an exciting and absorbing film for it's time period and should please his fans now that it is finally on Blu-ray for the first time. It comes highly recommended.",1447372800,11,3655,5.1206030150753765

119842,1,079074886X,"After checking the Amazon reviews, my wife and I got this movie on dvd.  To be sure, the re-mastering of video and audio are topnotch, but the story and direction are not.  What stands out most is the scrambled message from the lead characters and the plot--is this a pro-France or anti-France theme?  Time and again we hear how patriotic the characters are, but then we witness official corruption, injustice, and cold-blooded killing and abuse of prisoners in a French penal colony.  It's as if the studio bosses interfered with the director, the same man who did ""Casablanca,"" and told him to revise the story all along the way.  The result is an insconsistent, contradictory mish-mash that makes no sense.

Beyond the weak story-telling is the waste of outstanding actors, including Humphrey Bogart, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre.  Moreover, special effects look cheap and hokey in places, especially where airplane models are substituted for the real things.  Maybe the producer and director thought that once casting was done they could take it easy and let nature take its course.  If so, they were wrong.

Of course, any film is a product of its time and the overall spirit of ""Passage to Marseille"" would be no exception.  What seems to be true, though, is instead of the non-chalance of ""Casablanca"" (circa, 1942) we get a vehicle for selling war bonds in 1944.  Rather than, ""Here's looking at you, kid,"" we get sappy sentimentality. If that sounds callous, well maybe it is.  But this movie could have been so much better than it is.

119844,4,079074886X,"Warner Bros. Pictures  presents ""PASSAGE TO MARSEILLE"" (1944) (109 min/B&W) -- Starring Humphrey Bogart, Claude Rains, Michele Morgan, Helmut Dantine, Sydney Greenstreet & Peter Lorre

Directed by Michael Curtiz

Unfolded in a complex flashback-within-flashback structure, this is the story of Matrac (Humphrey Bogart), a freedom-loving French journalist who sacrifices his happiness and security to battle Nazi tyranny. The film opens as French liason officer Freycinet (Claude Rains), stationed in London, tells Mantrac's story to a British reporter (John Loder). Freycinet reveals that Mantrac, happily married to Paula (Michele Morgan), was framed by pro-fascists and sentenced to Devil's Island. Here he engineered a daring escape with such lost souls as Marius (Peter Lorre), & Garou (Helmut Dantine).

Designed as a follow-up to the enormously successful Casablanca, Passage to Marseille utilizes the talents of many of the on and off screen personnel of the earlier Warner Bros. classic.

Despite the weaknesses, it's an acceptable--if curious--sort of wartime adventure obviously designed to appeal to audiences who responded so strongly to CASABLANCA. Passage to Marseille is not a bad film, but not up there with Casablanca.

Yes - there's Greenstreet & Lorre again!

Other films to feature the Greenstreet / Lorre combination were The Maltese Falcon (1941), Casablanca (1942), Background to Danger (1943), The Mask of Dimitrios (1944), The Conspirators (1944), Three Strangers (1946 & The Verdict (1946)

119849,2,079074886X,"The film opens with a ship on a foggy ocean. It is dedicated to the Free French who are fighting Germany. Next they show the Germans using the old audio device for detecting aircraft (instead of radar). Bombs drop on a chemical factory. ""Till we meet again."" A journalist from London, Mr. Manning, visits the Free French airbase. The Flying Fortresses are prepared for a night mission. [Are those miniatures?] Captain Fressenay tells Manning about Matrac. This story starts on a tramp steamer where they talk about the Maginot Line. In the Caribbean they spot something, a small boat with exhausted men. Are they fugitives from Devil's Island? Or miners who want to return to France? ""The man is insufferable."" The Captain of the ship warns the men about their status. They tell him their stories. [This pads out the film and provides personal backgrounds.]

Will the old man help them escape? They tell about Matrac, a journalist who was against the Munich Agreement. Crowds attack his newspaper office while the police ignore this riot. Political oppression? [Do some of the scenes recall ""Casablanca""?] Will Matrac be framed for a crime? Will he survive in solitary? The prisoners escape. But there are too many for the small boat. ""Good Luck."" News tells of the fall of France. Captain Duval has taken command of the ship, he noticed the changed course. [Never underestimate your enemy.] This tramp steamer is armed with Lewis guns and a cannon. [Protection against pirates?] Will a German bomber find their position? ""Man the guns!"" They fire a cannon at the bomber that returns fire. Then the bomber is hit and crashes. Matrac fires at the survivors to destroy them all. Captain Fressenay finishes the story and tells what happened after they reached England. One bomber has not returned with the others. When it lands there are casualties; one doesn't make it. There is an inspirational speech at the end.

This is not a good story but reflects the thinking of many at that time. Was the death of Matrac done as a punishment? Would any tramp steamer carry a cannon or even machine guns?",1242086400,,2093,4.843575418994414

7791745,5,079074886X,"If you'd never seen 1944's Passage to Marseille, and you're a war film buff, then you are missing out and maybe I'm even questioning your cred as a war film buff. In Bogie's repertoire, I rank Passage to Marseille a notch below Casablanca and Sahara in terms of how good it is. Word is that Humphrey Bogart had to compromise in order to make this movie. He was pressured to star in Conflict, a drama in which he portrays a husband plotting to bump off his wife. At this stage in his career, Bogie was done playing the heavy. Except WB studio martinet Jack Warner wouldn't give the nod to making Passage to Marseille until Bogie committed to Conflict. So Bogie, who saw Passage to Marseille as an important film and a morale booster for the war effort, caved.

Adapted from the novella, Without Country, by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall - same authors who penned Mutiny on the Bounty - Passage to Marseille is framed by several minutes of present-day plot, but, mostly, it's a flashback within a flashback within a flashback. Yeah, the rabbit hole goes that deep. It's about the French cargo ship, Ville de Nancy, ""one of those venerable tramps which wallow in the backwaters of the world year after year"" and one day how it collected five exhausted men off a drifting boat, men who had gone without food for twenty days, without water for five. They were nearly dead.

The leader of these men is Jean Matrac (Bogie) whose striking mug once invited this remark: ""I've never seen a stronger face or a stranger one."" Matrac isn't the biggest of his bunch, but he's the most iron-willed. He and his mangy colleagues insist that they were gold miners from Venezuela, not that anyone's buying what they're shoveling. One of the more distinguished passengers onboard Ville de Nancy, Major Duval (Sydney Greenstreet), a commandant and a martinet, suspects that the five are escaped convicts from Devil's Island, that hellish penal colony up in Cayenne. He's not wrong.

What these five have going for them is that they're willing to fight like fiends for their country. And, in the harsh wartime mood what's gripped France, perhaps some latitude is required.

A sizable chunk of the movie devotes itself to time on Ville de Nancy. It tracks its trajectory from Southeast Asia enroute to Marseille with its precious cargo of nickel ore, except intrigue then intrudes. Observe the Ville de Nancy fend off assault from without and from within, its crew abetted by the five rescued escapees. Cue James Wong Howe's phenomenal photography, framing Bogie in several magnificent action heroic shots. The movie was occasionally presented in semi-documentary fashion, a treatment that lends the narrative a gritty, authentic feel. The scenes depicting brutal life on Devil's Island are uniformly oppressive and made all the more impressive by virtue of the penal colony - and the jungle cradling it - being artificially reconstructed in a studio.

It's a salute to the Free French Air Squadron, in which Jean Matrac, once a crusading pressman, becomes a cutthroat gunner. And what of his inmates? The mechanic who killed his sweetheart in a lover's quarrel... with an axe? The embittered farmer from Provence? Or the Army deserter? The Paris safecracker? This movie doesn't play it safe in terms of ensuring that all the big-name actors survive.

For history buffs, Passage to Marseille produces signposts significant to French history circa WWII, be it from discussions concerning the outbreak of war between Germany and France, or braggadocio regarding the invincible Maginot Line, and its subsequent breaching, to the Armistice of 22 June 1940.

It's a cast and crew of pro's pros. Photography by James Wong Howe. Score by Max Steiner. Direction from Michael Curtiz. A sterling cast spearheaded by Humphrey Bogart who, by the way, doesn't even try for a French accent (probably a wise move). If you'd ever wondered what Claude Rains would look like with a roguish eyepatch, wonder no more. Sydney Greenstreet, whose elegant corpulence lends him a sinister air, is once more silky smooth as the articulate heavy.

There are several highlight moments throughout the film, but none so emotionally stirring as when a letter written by a war veteran to his young son is read aloud at his funeral. It's an amazing letter, from which I lifted a quote to use as my review title. Such an excellent wartime drama.",1512950400,,4397,4.908479138627187
