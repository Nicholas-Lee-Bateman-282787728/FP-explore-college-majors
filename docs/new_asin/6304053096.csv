7861439,2,6304053096,"Dave Carradine and his Dave Leisure(Joe

Isuzu) look alike partner investigate

crimes of dastardly Griffin O'Neal's

street gang of punks. Nancy Quan plays

his long suffering liberal social worker

(??) girlfriend (??) wife, we're never

sure. Writer-Director-Co-Producer/Nobody

Norbert Meisel's hamfisted direction

and the cheap (and dark!) production

standards hurt what could be a decent

B Indy film. Since Carradine did six

other projects this year, he can be

forgiven for not being his sharpest

here. Losses an eye in Deer Hunter

ripoff scene and punk before he pulls

the triger EVEN SAYS IT'S A RIPOFF of

the Deerhunter! Patrick Culliton, with

a mustache appears at the beginning

(He played opposite Dave in Future

Force and Future Zone ) gets bumped off

so early in film I had to watch it twice

to realize he was in here, as it said so

in closing credits. Meisel never worked

in Hollyweird again and one or two looks

of this film and you will know why!",1155772800,,979,4.865030674846626
7861440,5,6304053096,"David Carradine plays a cop on the world's toughest beat, a street in Los Angeles where life is cheaper than a morning paper. The kids who call this street home are as tough as its pavement; living in darkness, slipping through the shadows, they are Night Children. Their leader, Blade, played by Griffin O'Neal, cannot help but destroy what he loves.
Nancy Kwan plays a probation officer trying to save Blade's girlfriend Jenny, and her friend Susie, from the whirlpool of drugs and violence on the street. In the end, it is only her gun that saves anyone. A taut, well-plotted film, Night Children careens with all the energy and naked violence of today's headlines.",1038355200,2,668,4.817391304347826
