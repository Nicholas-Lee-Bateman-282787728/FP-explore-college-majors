7977024,2,B00007JZV4,This was advertised as a new product but what we received was not. The DVD was open and the disc has many scratches on it. Not sure if it works yet as I got it as we were going out of town. Very frustrated to get a used item when it was stated to be new.,1493769600,,254,3.5535714285714284

7977028,5,B00007JZV4,"I remember getting King Clifford on VHS at Uncle Pizza in Glenwood Springs.  Right when we went to take on an airplane trip to see Jay Jay The Jet Plane at Southwest Airlines in Denver, I brought King Clifford, in when something awful happened.  I lost King Clifford and that is terrible.  It was taking by the airport and the Clifford VHS was flying away like an airplane did so sad. We got King Clifford back again for Hanukkah 2010  I know the first one flew away but I got the new King Clifford.  It has the exact same cover as the old one. I will give it 5 stars.",1324512000,,568,4.127272727272727
7977029,5,B00007JZV4,"This DVD is split in to two segments. The first half has stories in which Clifford and his freinds either pretend to be, think they are, or act like royalty; they are: Clifford the Pirate King * Princess Cleo * King Mac * Flood of Imagination. They're solid stories and mainly deal with including others, being kind, and being imaginative. The second half of the DVD is a very nice series of stories only one of which has anything to do with Valentines day. They are Cleo's Valentine Surprise * Big Hearted t-Bone * Wedding Bell Blues * Special T-Bone. Besides the Valentine story the other stories deal with keeping your word, accepting change, and discovering the best about yourself. They're very nice.",1262304000,3,705,4.739837398373984
