1884343,2,B00009LIA5,This straight to video fim cannot compare to the 1st-which was a classic with Roger Hauer-Jake Bussey (son of Gary Bussey) is just like his father-a typical B movie actor with limited range and acting ability. He was not at all scary-he was just too predictable.  The movie did not explain the connection between  Busey and Hauer (from the original) - and I thought that was a major part missing-C Thomas Howell is a great B movie actor and is fit for movies like this but---he was killed off way too early in this film and from that time on the film kind of went down hill after that.  Rent it-bring it back to the store and forget it. I would like to get a hold of the special edition of the Hitcher that the reviewer from LA spoke of.,1058313600,2,737,4.25
1884344,3,B00009LIA5,"Im a big fan of the original.  It's hard to follow in the steps of a classic like THE HITCHER, especially with Rutger Hauer in the lead role.  And it is exactly because Hauer is not in this one that I cant give it more than 3 stars.  It tries too hard to be as good as the original and Jake Bussey has been given an impossible job of trying to be as menacing a character as the memorable John Ryder played by Hauer.  And as for C. Thomas Howell?  [Darn], I thought his character would be in a mental ward for the rest of his life after what he went through.  Still, its worth a look.  Maybe rent before buying.

1884383,3,B00009LIA5,"Kind of disappointing, it has a few moments, worth a once watch, but fails to have the strength of the original classic and runs out of steam too quick into the film. Busey isn't clever or mean enough to match or even come close the Ruger Hauer part in the first film. But watch it anyway to make a fair judgement...",1401926400,,316,4.19672131147541

1884386,3,B00009LIA5,"It has been 15 years, but Officer Jim Halsey hasn't forgotten the horrible events that he experienced as a teen out on that desolate stretch of highway in Texas. He decides to return with his wife to face down his own personal demons, only to find that the hitcher from his nightmares has been waiting for another ride... C. Thomas Howell returns as the paranoid Jim Halsey in this late sequel to the high-octane thriller THE HITCHER, although it is Kari Wuhrer who ultimately faces off with the demented killer. Jake Busey fills in for Rutger Hauer this round, who is a suitable choice for the villain (if not completely over-the-top). While the throwaway lines and dialog are all deeply embedded in genre cliches, the unexpected action sequences are fresh and unpredictable. They still have a very small feel to them as opposed to the explosive action of the first film, though director Louis Morneau does leave off with a dogfight between a crop duster and a tanker truck. As unnecessary and repetitive as THE HITCHER 2 may be, it still provides mild entertainment for the jaded viewer.

1884387,4,B00009LIA5,nice item. price is good. couldn't have asked for anything more. i was pleased with the overall purchase and everything.,1359072000,,120,5.05
1884388,2,B00009LIA5,"There may be minor spoilers in this review so I'd like to point that out from the start. I do suggest fans of the original to watch this and make your own judgement. This film is kind of hard to rate. Jake Busey is very charasmatic as The Hitcher but Rutger Hauer was The Man! The sequel suggests him to be immortal a la Michael Myers/Jason Vorhees. And, he could appear to be anyone ordinary but somehow he always turns up! It's an interesting concept. However, in most peoples mind The Hitcher could only be Rutger!!

Having C. Thomas Howell back as Jim Halsey was very cool but IMO the script for him basically sucked. In the first film he showed a lot more swiftness and will to survive moreso than this one. After what he went through in the first film you would think he'd have better intelligence in dealing with The Hitcher! And like the other review on here said, kinda scared but not petrified out of his mind!! I thought it was being a bit disrespectful to the first film to have his character portrayed the way he was. Kari was great as the girlfriend, though. She had the best performance of the film.

I don't know if they can play off the mistakes in this one and somehow put together an improved part 3. It may be a bit hard to do when the two most important characters appear to be dead.",1331510400,,1304,4.296747967479675
1884389,5,B00009LIA5,My family and I watched this movie and enjoyed it.  It was a good sequel to the Hitcher that was made in the 1980s.  It came in the time it was supposed to and we were all happy with the service.,1318896000,,195,3.731707317073171

1884391,5,B00009LIA5,"I do not fully understand the comments about this movie. Yeah, its not perfect but man the story is creepy and the hitcher is so damn  crazy that it would make the original hitcher look goofy. I like the kills and the music and the finger scene. oh man! Yeah I know this movie isn't perfect but its 2000 times better than the horrible remake. So I recommend u get this.",1282608000,,369,4.197183098591549
1884392,4,B00009LIA5,"Now when I first watched this movie, I was screaming my head off. After I watched it again, I said to myself, self, this is crazy!! I loved this movie and watched the first one with Jennifer Jason Leigh. That was insane. I am a big fan of Kari Wuhrer and Jake Busey. But with all films that have a II, III, et., you loose the magic that the first one had. Why try and repeat it again.",1184716800,,384,3.9358974358974357
1884403,3,B00009LIA5,"I seen this movie on USA network the other day. I haven't seen the first one but I enjoyed this one. It wasn't right that the guy from the first one died though. Jake Busey has skills like his dad. It shows in this movie. He is a freaky psycho in this movie! It is quite frightening! The movie is very entertaining, but every time the girl finds a way to stop the psycho, he blames everything on the girl or he always finds a way to get out of trouble. That's the only bad thing. Otherwise, buy it! I plan to! I gave it 3 stars because it is not a 4 star movie. It really is a 3 and a half. Don't listen to the bad reviews. You'll love it.",1174521600,,639,3.8484848484848486
1884404,3,B00009LIA5,"As a fan of The Hitcher, I was curious to see The Hitcher II.  I was not disappointed. Although not quite as good as the first Hitcher, I found this movie thrilling and suspenseful for not being a horror movie. C. Thomas Howell returns in this sequel as Jim Halsey who survived the crazed Hitcher of the first movie. His girlfriend in the movie, Maggie ( played by the very pretty Kari Wuhrer ) is a tough cookie and delivers a great performance for she is a survivor!! Jim decides to take Maggie back to Texas where his original nightmare began years ago. They come across a hitchhiker who Maggie wants to pick up. After being a victim of the first hitchhiker, Jim does not want to pick up any more hitchhikers but gets talked into it by his girlfriend. The new crazed hitcher is named Jack ( played by Jake Busey ). Busey also delivers a good performance as a crazed man. Their journey turns into a nightmare when they realize they have picked up a psychopath. From then on, the film has many twists and surprises. I found it was entertaining from beginning to end. There is strong violence in this movie but it's not your basic gore movie. I really liked this movie and don't regret buying it. If you like thrillers, this is a movie for you. I don't quite understand the bad reviews about this movie. I'd suggest renting it and decide for yourself. I think most people will like it.",1141257600,4,1385,4.41015625
1884405,2,B00009LIA5,"Face it people, this is not T2 or The Godfather Part II, and why is there a sequel to the hitcher anyway? The first ""The Hitcher"" was a classic movie which was a perfect reimagining of Steven Speilberg's classic DUEL. There was no need for a sequel. The story was told, nothing more to tell. A sequel? Dragonheart fell victim for this. A sequel will just tell the story all over again. Not even C. Thomas Howell could save this movie from being a failure. All in all, not entertaining and unnecessary. Not recomended.",1132963200,4,517,4.51063829787234
1884406,3,B00009LIA5,"C. Thomas Howell reprises his role as Jim Halsey in this sequel to the original ""Hitcher"".  Still haunted by earlier events, Jim and his girlfriend Maggie (Kari Wuhrer) decide to confront his demons once and for all.  After being relieved of his duties as a police officer for using excessive force in breaking up a child abduction, Jim calls his friend Captain Ethridge, who helped him out earlier.  The Captain convinces Jim and Maggie to come back to Texas so Jim can confront his feelings and erase his anxieties. Jim has never told his secret to Maggie, so she doesn't know why he keeps having flashbacks and is acting so strangely.

However, upon reaching their destination, the same sequence of events starts all over again, as Maggie forcefully convinces Jim to pick up a hitchhiker along the same strech of roadway that Jim had travelled 15 years earlier.  The apparent survivor of an accident, Jack (Jake Busey) thumbs a ride from Jim and Maggie.  Unknown to them at the time, Jake is the one who caused the accident.  Soon, Jim and Maggie are fighting for their lives against another psychotic hitchhiker.  Who will survive?

I thought the first movie was better than this one.  I do think that C. Thomas Howell, Jake Busey, and Kari Wuhrer do good jobs in their roles, but the story is all too predictable (although there are some unexpected happenings).  Even the scene with the victim tied between the truck and trailer is revised from the first movie.  There's not much originality in this film, either.  It relies too much on the first movie.  I did like the flashbacks to the first film, though.  The glaring omission from this movie is Rutger Hauer's amazing portrayal as the hitcher.  Although Jake Busey does a pretty good job portraying the hitcher, Rutger Hauer's performance in the first movie is much better.  If you've seen the original ""Hitcher"", then this movie is worth watching only to see how the story plays out.  If you haven't seen the first movie, then you'll have a hard time following the storyline of this movie.",1132185600,2,2049,4.756373937677054
1884407,3,B00009LIA5,"Let me start off by saying that ""The Hitcher"" is one of my all time favorite movies, been so for almost 20 years now and going into the sequel I really wasn't expecting all that much and, to be honest, it delivered what I expected.

While the first 5 minutes or so of the film where intriguing and had a great twist, the movie fails to deliver any new scares. While C. Thomas Howell was incredible as a teenager driving across country, the older version of his character seems to flounder in an attempt to rekindle the suspense from the original. Of course the biggest missing piece of the movie is that of Rutger Hauer. While Jake Busey makes a nice attempt at a mysterious, road dwelling psychopath, there's just replacing Hauer. Kari Wuhrer does an admirable job of playing the victim turned heroine.

While the movie itself isn't terrible, it's just not original. The plot is pretty much a cheap carbon copy of the original. If your a big fan of the original and are curious as to what the sequel brings I might suggest you rent it. I wouldn't suggest buying it. Buy the original instead!",1115683200,,1092,4.51010101010101
1884408,3,B00009LIA5,"This is the first sequel to the cult classic The hicther.

The hitcher is my favourite film, and a sequel would have been a dream to me. I was really looking forward to seeing this, and I was one of the first in line to get it. When I saw it I wasn't displeased, but it wasn't as great as the first. The bad things about this is the music also isn't as great, the plot confuses me at points, the hitcher on this one isn't nearly as good as Rutger hauer from the first movie, the way the hitcher dies on this one is a bit stupid and the main character from the first gets killed on this one and the woman has to kill the hitcher by hirself. The camera work looks a bit bad in this film also. But still, the action still has its place in this sequel. Too be honest, this film is not nearly as dark or as atmospheric as the original. There are no huge stunts, massive action sequences or anything. I do recommend the shootout scene in the restaurant though. But, really, you have to see the first film, since that is an all time classic. Get that instead.",1112227200,,1052,4.082125603864735
1884409,2,B00009LIA5,"Upon first look at the Hitcher 2, your first question will simply be, why?  Why was this direct to video sequel to an 80's horror/suspense classic even green lighted?  Who knows, but it shouldn't have been.  Despite some relatively good stretches, for the most part the Hitcher 2, which retreads on the plot of the original, is a routine and predictable pot boiler.  An older C. Thomas Howell returns as Jim, who is now a troubled cop trying to put his past behind him and go away for a little R&R with his girlfriend (Kari Wuhrer).  Eventually, they come across a hitcher (Jake Busey) whom they pick up, and well, you know where this is going.  Busey is good as a murdering psychopath who may or may not be Rutger Hauer's character from the original film, but Howell looks so bored in his brief return as Jim, and Wuhrer's acting abilities are wasted leaving her as eye candy (which isn't such a bad thing).  The police force is presented here as ignorant hillbillies, a stereotype which the original Hitcher avoided, and the acting isn't anything to write home about either.  Predictable until it's end, which actually does offer a few nice surprises, the Hitcher 2 is something which should have never been.  Fans of the original will want to see this, but all others should avoid.",1109980800,8,1284,4.646017699115045
1884410,3,B00009LIA5,"As far as straight to video sequels that barely raise one's awareness of it's very existence goes, this sequel to the 1986 film, is better than expected. It doesn't set any new trends or build upon what happened in the original, but it makes up for it for being a fun, albeit, generic little road thriller. Instead of trying something new and creating new surprises and thrills and chills, the movie basically follows the original's blue print to the max. Not only that, but pretty much every other road type thriller film. It doesn't really have a persona or presence of it's own, just parts of other movies all rolled into one. C. Thomas Howell returns as Jim Halsey, from the original movie. He is now a slightly bent cop who is still plagued by the trauma he experienced when picking up a psycho hitchiker years ago. After an event in the opening minutes, Jim decides to take to off to a friends house for a little getaway. He brings along his new girlfriend(played by the lovely Kari Wuhrer)for the ride. While driving in the middle of nowhere in a storm, Jim picks up, at his girlfriend's urging, a suspicious hitchiker also named Jim(Jake Busey). What results is the usual shenanigans when Jim and his girl find themselves trapped in the psycho hitcher's little game. You know the drill. Busey was a good casting choice for the role. There were some rumors going around in the film's early stages that Rutger Hauer was possibly returning. Sadly, he did not. Then again, there would be no way he could. Instead, we get Busey. He doesn't have the commanding presence that Hauer had, but he has a certain presence all his own. He is an agreeable bad guy that gets the point across, but just can't match Hauer. With his dad being who he is, I see Busey having a long career as the whack job. His character here is an enigma. There are lines here and there where it seems they are alluding to the fact that he might be somebody. Wuhrer's character even asks, but never gets an answer. We don't really know who he is, and it's kind of frustrating. Which makes me wonder if there will be a ""Hitcher 3"" that will give more of an explanation. C. Thomas Howell returns to the role as Jim, and his acting is pretty wooden. It was nice to see him, and he does have a better presence as he has gotten on in years, but his acting leaves a lot to be desired. This leaves us with Wuhrer. She has sort of made a name for herself as a made for cable/straight to video B movie type actress, and I don't see her breaking out of that entrapment. That being said, she does a pretty good job here in her role. She makes a pretty solid butt kicking heroine. If only she got better material that rised above just being another straight to video piece of fodder. The movie isn't all bad. It's shot well, and the cinematography is nice. It is supposed to be Texas, but was really shot in Canada. And they did a great job making it seem like Texas. There are a few pretty good scenes and moments, but with re-creating the torn between two trucks scenario, and Jim having flashbacks to the original, it appears that the movie is hanging onto it's respected predecessor instead of moving on into it's own thing. It also feels like it has way more kills than needed, which makes it feel like a typical shoot 'em up bloodbath. With a more solid foundation, clearer view of plot, and a little more surprises, the sequel could of been a lot more than it is. Still, like I said, it's a decent little road thriller for what it is. Nothing more than that.",1106784000,,3525,4.4079754601226995
1884411,2,B00009LIA5,"What is wrong with the filmakers here, the first film was a neat thriller, even if it lost its suspense element toward the end, it was still chilling, I had high hopes for this one, especially since C.Thomas Howell decided to return, only the first 20 minutes are good, In this one, 15 years has passed since the first film's events, Jim Halsey(Howell) has for the most part put that nightmare behind him, he is now cop himself & leads a pretty normal life with his girlfriend (Kari Wuhrer) who is always nice to look at, but keeps having recurring flashbacks especially after a undercover situation goes wrong & he is suspended on his job, he contacts Captain Esteridge who helped him in the first film, & he suggest that he come see him so he can face his fear & move on which means to do so, he would have to travel the same road, Halsey reluctantly does, with Wuhrer, & what follows is Halsey's paranoid behavior as he refuses to stop, even for a wrecked mobile home, it is understandable why he is paranoid, but soon they see a stranger(Jake Busey) who Wuhrer forces Halsey to pick up, Busey's demeanor is that of Rutger Hauer's Hitcher in the first film, & Halsey immediately forces him out at gunpoint, I really felt this film would take elements of 1997's ""Breakdown"" & have Howell & Wuhrer out wit Busey, it seems that way at first, but instead the filmakers decided to rip off the original, & to add insult to injury, kill off Howell's Halsey leaving Wuhrer to fend for herself, as she like him in the original is framed for all of Busey's mayhem, as kills anyone & everyone & manages to make her look like the culprit, this one even suggest that Busey is the same character that Hauer played, come on, in the original, Hauer's Hitcher is blasted by a shotgun at least 3 times by Halsey at the end, no way was he coming back, but this tries to suggest that, when what they should have done is have Busey somehow related to Hauer, but no they insult our intelligence with this whacked out theory, that he somehow survived, yeah right, Hauer must feel so honored, I would have much rather seen Howell & Wuhrer play cat & mouse with Busey, that, at least would have brought back the suspense element, & Howell's Halsey facing his demons for sure, why Howell agreed to this script is beyond me, I'm sure Hauer was offered to return as well, it is easy to see why he might have passed, Howell should have too, or at least demanded a better story, Wuhrer & Busey do their best to play off each other's emotion, but their talent is completely wasted here, which is disappointing, A ""Breakdown"" type suspense story would have been better, who knows it might have gotten a theatrical release, you can't fault Wuhrer or Busey, but Howell should have known better!!",1100304000,2,2764,4.486111111111111

1 star = abysmal; some movies deserve to be forgotten
2 star = poor; a total waste of time
3 star = good; worth the effort
4 star = very good; what a movie should be

THE STORY: Jim Halsey in an effort to face his nightmares from the first movie, travels back to Texas with his girlfriend.
MY FEEDBACK:
1) C. Thomas' acting was the worst I've ever seen him and I've sat through some of his straight to cable/video B movies
2) Busey is just a likeable bad guy
3) Wuhuer is attractive and does a better acting job that the previous two
4) The cops are portrayed as hillbilly idiots. Too much of a stereotype that it felt like the writer just got lazy.
5) The killing scense weren't creative or suspensful. Better watch Friday the 13th part 85 if you want to see killing.
6) First 15 min and last 15 were the best part of the movie. Nice plot twists.
OVERALL: Not the worst I've seen but definitely not even worth renting. If it comes on TV late at night and you are having insomnia...watch this and you'll be back to sleep in no time.",1086652800,,1103,4.158878504672897

1884424,4,B00009LIA5,"I guess my title of this review pretty much states the obvious,
but that's the point here. Taken on it's own merits, without the
expectations of living up to the original, this isn't really too
bad of a film. I mean, with most of the horror movies that have
come out recently {Freddy VS Jason, House Of The Dead},among
others, this one ranks quite favorably. Jake Busey may not live
up to Rutger Hauer{wouldn't it have been nice if he came back
for the sequel instead of Howell?} but he certainly out did
Robert Englund's latest effort. This does not live up to the
original Hitcher, but neither do any of the other shockers
coming out these days. I've seen the new Busey in a few bad guy
roles now. I kind of like his style. If you can't get past the
comparison with the first Hitcher,then there isn't much sense
in wasting your time with it. But if you can take it for what it
is{a horror movie of the new millenium}, it's not a bad way to
spend ninty-three minutes of your evening.

1884425,3,B00009LIA5,"Comparing this sequel to the original film is like comparing a sirloin steak to a New York strip. It's no contest, even though nine times out of ten you'd be perfectly content to enjoy the lesser cut of beef. (Of course after the finale in this movie you might swear off red meat entirely for awhile.)
If you haven't seen the original recently, you'll probably find this movie an adequate use of ninety minutes. I have the first movie in my stack of to-be-watched films, but when I came across this title I thought I'd give it a chance on its own merits. It didn't disappoint.
Jake Busey is a different breed of hitcher. Where Hauer kept it icy and menacing, Busey goes nutjob from the word go. It's not a bad performance, but it's different enough to throw you if you were expecting more of what you got in the first movie. There *are* several scenes borrowed from the first movie, but they are significantly different as well - for instance (and this isn't a spoiler, it's featured on the disc packaging) the truck-stretching scene is repeated, but with The Hitcher as victim this time around.
The cinematography is gorgeous, but this ultimately works against the film: instead of creating a sense of isolation, the broad vistas could double as Tourist Board video, calling out ""Come to Texas"" (or Calgary, as the case may be). Also working against the film is an over-reliance on genre clichs: the slow camera moves while the spooky music builds, the framing tightly on the hero(ine) so you can pull back and reveal the killer, the killer playing possum so the ending can be stretched by a scene or two.
If you're in the mood for a middling suspense/horror film, you could do much worse than this movie. Not exactly a ringing endorsement, I know, but this is the kind of movie that plays better if you don't have high expectations of it to begin with.",1076889600,,1854,4.587349397590361

I just saw that this new sequel has become available at the store where I usually rent movies and I must say I'm tempted to see Howell's face again after all these years, cause for me Howell still is an actor who revealed to be outstanding I think. Perhaps you've seen ""The Outsiders""!? Besides I think he should have had more credit for his role in the first part [1984] where no other could so well express fear and heroism at the same time. And it's a thrilling sensation seeing that same face again after 20 years. Now I believe that this is a cheap and ""not to be taken serious"" sequel, but good movies have all been made in the 80s. Nowadays they don't make good movies anymore, it seems that it's not the story that counts but how hot the actors look and what special effects have been used.

1884429,1,B00009LIA5,"Do not!!  I repeat, DO NOT purchase this movie!!!!  It's not even worthy of being rented.  I just finished watching it on Pay-Per-View and was disappointed with it from the very beginning.  This sequel is an absolute insult to the original.  It was poorly written and poorly acted.  C. Thomas Howell must have been broke if he made this movie because I can't see why else he would've agreed to do it (especially after reading the script).  The charcters just aren't believable nor is the plot line. Worst of all, C. Thomas Howell's character was killed off at the beginning; thus, the whole movie revolved around Kari Whuhrer's charecter (the girlfriend).  Hell, I didn't watch the sequel to see her.  I watched it to see C. Thomas Howell reprise his character.  Point being?  Why make a sequel and kill of the one character that ties it all together and makes the story make sense and worthwile to watch.  And lastly, what's the point in having a villain if he's not believable or even scary?  Ugh!!  Busey just didn't cut it!!!
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE!!!  Trust me, you won't be missing anything.  Stick with the original!!!",1067472000,4,1136,4.661616161616162
1884430,1,B00009LIA5,"With what seems like the most unnecessary sequel in recent cinema history, THE HITCHER 2: I'VE BEEN WAITING is ''finally'' here. Coming from out of nowhere, this film not only doesn't need to be made, but actually succeeds in making you know that it doesn't need to be made.
The story picks up years after the first movie closed, as Jim Halsey (played by C.Thomas Howell, who has grown up to resemble a rejected member of Motley Crue) is still haunted by the nightmare that was Rutger Hauer. He is now a veteran cop, undergoing serious stress and anxiety. In an effort to get his life back on track, he seeks out his police mentor buddy (Jeffrey DeMunn's character from the original, here played by someone else). However, to get to him, he must travel down that same stretch of road from the original movie, where he first encountered Hauer's malevolent villain.
En route, he takes his girlfriend Maggie (Kari Wuhrer in serious direct-to-video fatigue), who is blissfully unaware of Jim's past. Together, they travel down that same dusty highway, with Howell sweating and moaning about 'how they cannot stop for anything, must keep driving' etc. However, within 5 minutes of the running time, up pops Jake Busey - decked out on long black overcoat, wild blonde hair and carrying a rather big gun. Obviously, Howell flips his lid after Busey whispers in his ear 'I've been waiting for you' and then all hell breaks loose.
Well, I say 'all hell'. If you call people running away from a guy who looks about as frightening as a grinning children's entertainer at a kid's 5th birthday party, then by all means be terrified. However, I doubt it. To be fair to Busey, he is thoroughly entertaining - with his wild looks and goofy antics just about making the film bearable. Its just coming after Hauer's icy and twisted portrayal in the original film, Busey has to work EXTRA hard to get any real licks in. Returning 'star' Howell valiantly strives to rise above the mediocre script, and at some points he succeeds in exhibiting the right amount of stress and paranoia, but even he is flogging a dead horse in this dreadfully routine TV movie.
Director Louis Morneau has made some decent movies in the past. With the high-octane action comedy MADE MEN to the fun time travel thriller RETRO-ACTIVE, he has delivered excellent movies on shoe-string budgets, allowing his style and sharp sense of pacing drag you through even the dumbest of scripts. However, on this occasion his directorial style works against him. With this kind of film, mood is the key. The first movie had it in spades - lush cinematography, expert editing and a dark screenplay that set it apart from the rest of the 80s slasher led dreck. On this sequel however, Morneau shoots it like it were an action film. With his camera zooming all over the place and cutting scenes within an inch of their TV movie life, he never allows the viewer to become engrossed in the proceedings and care about any of the characters. Which is a shame as the cast are making an effort, even if the 'dime store, seen it all before' script isn't.
Universal's disc has NO extras. Not even a trailer. Which hurts even more, after you've seen the movie. The picture and audio quality are however, fine. With cinematographer George Maroodian's stylish (if fast moving) camerawork exhibited in full.
So, to sum up - after seeing the original film, you already know that there isn't a need for a sequel to THE HITCHER. That movie had a beginning, a middle and an end. Why Universal decided to make an awful sequel to a classic 80s thriller is anybody's guess. And, why I had the curiosity to spend [money]to see this unnecessary exercise in tedium is also, anybody's guess. I just hope you can learn from my mistake, keep your money firmly in your pocket and stick with the original.",1061856000,9,3820,4.694485842026825
1884431,3,B00009LIA5,"I was expecting pure crap when I first saw this but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. Decent acting, good cinematography, good camera work, good stunts, and Jake Busey seems to be having the time of his life. Too bad his role isn't better written and is just given the usual psycho-guy-making-wisecracks part. All in all, a harmless way to kill a rainy Saturday afternoon.",1058572800,2,382,4.7164179104477615
