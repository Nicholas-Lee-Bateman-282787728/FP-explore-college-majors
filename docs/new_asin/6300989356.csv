7809198,5,6300989356,I LOVE this VHS Tape.  It's a good tape to get you started on an exercise routine.,1436400000,,82,3.823529411764706
7809199,5,6300989356,"This was the original Walk Aerobics video by Leslie Sansone (then Tommelleo), and is the exercise tool I still use most, more than 2 decades later.  I've transferred it to DVD, and placed it on our DVR player, together with a couple of my other favourites.

Why is it so good?  Well, the workout is a good level - not too easy but also not one of the advanced ones.  And - like most Walk Aerobics sessions, it's super simple - just 4 basic steps, like the lady says!  There is a good mix of participants with Leslie - a variety of ages, body shapes and (to the extent you can tell) personalities.  [A few of them turn up again, a little older, in the over-40s Walk Aerobics tape!]  The music is good to walk to, and graduates well over the course of the session.  But mostly it's Leslie's personal enthusiasm, and encouragement.  She babbles along with such genuine warmth and personality that it just keeps you going, and smiling while you're doing it.

Downsides - only very 2 minor ones.  There's a glitch in the filming at one point, where they obviously lost the picture for a few seconds of the people exercising.  But the producer has used a piece of film showing them doing one of the other steps that is similar to cover this, and it's virtually seamless (but provides an interesting diversion).  And Leslie goes a bit far in sending up the size of one participant's nose (Jack) during her banter, but he doesn't seem to mind, or hold any grudges - he's one of the people in the later video I mentioned.

All in all, just a great walking exercise video, from a lady whose genuine enthusiasm and encouragement has helped me and many others over the years.",1368748800,,1663,4.445544554455446
7809200,5,6300989356,"Leslie is from where I am in Pennsylvania and I can remember doing this video with my mom at a young age just for fun.  Since then whenever I wanted a good workout I always went back to this video.  (I knew her words by heart!)  I've got my own place now, married and on a low carb diet and want to incorporate a workout as well and thought I'd look for my own copy of the video.  I'm so glad I found it easily and I might pick up some of Leslie's more advance videos as well.  She's fun and the video is easy for any fitness level!!",1075507200,4,533,3.853211009174312
7809201,5,6300989356,"I was pleased when my dayghter-in-law gave me her copy of this walk aerobics video by Leslie. She's wonderful, I have enjoyed it so much that I do it twice a day, morning and evening. Am trying to purchase her advanced walk aerobics video, but having some difficulties. Do you have an outlet in Australia selling Leslies great workouts.  Have benefited greatly. Keep up the great work...",985910400,11,387,4.776119402985074
7809202,5,6300989356,"I can't dance and trip all over myself on those complicated videos.  This one is simple, yet challenging, and easily adapts as your fitness level increases.  Leslie is slightly obnoxious, but she's definitely upbeat!",957139200,11,216,5.323529411764706
7809203,5,6300989356,"I first tried this tape back in '89 and was amazed at the results! Fast, easy, fun; I gave my borrowed Richards Simmons tape back and used Leslie's instead.
I just sent back my Tae-Bo tapes and ordered Leslie's Fat Burner  tape to use in conjunction with the Walk Aerobics.
I highly advise anyone  who hates to exercise and hates or can't afford to go a gym to Buy This  Tape!",931910400,13,376,4.267605633802817
7809204,5,6300989356,"If I am not mistaken, I believe this is her first tape.  She certainly does an excellent job!  It is definitely at a good pace and keeps you going.  Her tapes are simple and clear cut and no one at any age should  have a problem.  They are fun to do, the people are nice and Leslie is an  absolute doll!  I prefer her tapes over anyone else.  Simply thrilled I  found them!",922320000,8,373,4.0
