7802353,4,5553600936,"First off, LOVE the cover art depicting leading man Victor Junco wielding a smoking Uzi - 8 years before that weapon was put into general use. I think the intent is to make this look like a typical Mexican drug smugglers shoot-'em-up, which it most definitely is not.

No, this is a classic melodrama of the period, done with all the flourishes and passion that swoon and swell like the music on the lush soundtrack, a tale of a 'two-faced woman' who betrays her husband and descends into prostitution...only to be taken up by him in that line of work as his mistress! Pretty risque stuff for 1948.

Portrayed by the queen of the rumberas, Maria Antonieta Pons (who gets more than one opportunity here to show off her superior talents as a dancer), this is the kind of role that Joan Crawford would have been playing just north of the border a decade prior to this. Of course, Ms. Pons, her hair dyed slutty blonde for the role, puts her own indelible and individual stamp on the role, playing it with great gusto, and yet also delicate subtleties as the scene demands.

Victor Junco is solid and muy macho in the lead male role, but with a tender side, too. Prior to this film, I was mainly used to seeing him play older villains in Mexican action movies of the '70s and '80s, so it was a pleasing change of pace to watch him as a younger romantic lead.

If you like the Hollywood melodramas of Douglas Sirk, Jean Negulesco, Vincent Sherman, et. al., then this should be right up your alley. Also (obviously), for fans of Maria Antonieta Pons.",1369612800,,1544,4.483985765124555
7802354,5,5553600936,"A magnificent Period Piece, a woman from the Mexican high society, to fall down and became a high class prostitute,after her husband and her family outcast her for the reason of been an unfaithfull wife. She changed her name from Carola Ruter to Piedad of the Diamonds, but her ex-husband made a come back to her paying her services as a prostitute. The ending of this movie is a real surprise. Maria Antonieta Pons made a terrific performance as this ""Two Faced"" Lady. Another opportunity to show and to prove she was real good acting as well as dancing the Rumba (She was perhaps the Best Rumbera). Superb, as ever, Miss Pons prove she was the ""one and only"" Maria Antonieta. The Mexico City of the late 40's help the movie and the story. Is based on a novel of  the writer ""El Caballero Audaz"". Victor Junco is real good as a leading man. Good music, songs ""Amor Perdido"", ""La ultima Noche"". Rumbas with the Best Rumbera (Miss Pons) , and the Spanish Flamenco song ""La Bien Pagada"".Not to be missed. I have seen this movie when I was 12 years old in my native Cuba and I am very lucky I have got it. I only wish I could find more movies with Maria Antonieta pons.",1063670400,,1166,4.373271889400922
