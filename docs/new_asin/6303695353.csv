8203139,5,6303695353,"Bon Jovi is one of the only surviving ""hair bands"" who have managed to maintain a successful career, both critically and commercially, and ""Live from London"" shows why. The high energy show displays old favorites like ""Livin on a Prayer"" and ""Lay Your Hands on Me"" as well as the overwhelmingly popular ballad ""Always,"" as Jon gives a heartbreaking performance. ""Hey God"" is one of the best performances given, as well as ""Keep the Faith."" The band looks confident and seems to be having fun...so will fans. The video montage accompanying ""These Days"" is a fun glimpse behind the scenes. Overall, a fantastic performance, and a must-have for any Bon Jovi fan.",984960000,16,659,4.892857142857143
8203140,5,6303695353,"This is the greatest video for a Bon Jovi fan to have.  The entire band delivers an excellent performance.  Jon is totally wonderful!  The band sings all their hits ""Wanted Dead or Alive"", ""Lay your Hands on me"", ""Bad Medicine"", ""Livin on a Prayer"", ""Blaze of Glory"", ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"", ""Hey God"", and many more!  The most amazing performances are ""Always"" and ""This Aint A Love Song"", if you buy the video for no other reason than those two songs, you will be doing yourself a favor.  This is by far the best Bon Jovi performance I have ever seen!",980467200,6,557,4.421568627450981
