7817940,5,6301967879,"I never thought of the ridiculous romantic sub-plot as any sort of bother, here;  sub-plots evidently placed for time-filling  the longer-running  features (vs. the shorts) -Hal Roach thought  tthose sub-plots  moments to be  dramatic breaks from the laughter-!.  .As an all-time L& H-fan. I can tell you that BONNIE SCOTLAND ( along with BEAU-HUNKS and PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES)--for me-; contain some  of the FINEST  examplings of their work, and were made at their home studio of HAL ROACH, from 1927-1940., Corny sub-plots with  corny co-stars delviring corny dialouge,doen not mean a lesser rated  L& H  comedy vehicle .",1507680000,,622,5.171717171717172

7817945,2,6301967879,"Despite the box-office success of ""Pack Up Your Troubles"" and ""Sons of the Desert,"" producer Hal Roach believed that Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy could not sustain a full-length comedy without a secondary plot. As a result, ""Bonnie Scotland"" (1935) squandered an opportunity to effectively lampoon ""The Lives of a Bengal Lancer."" Submerged in a schizophrenic storyline, Stan and Ollie manage to provide several classic moments. The Boys' impromptu dance number remains a definite highlight.

OVERALL RATING: **",1264204800,,510,5.538461538461538
7817946,4,6301967879,"It's already been well-covered as to plot, deficiencies, etc. by other reviewers. So I will just say that, bogged down though it may be with a dreadful and forgettable romance that has little bearing on our boys, the merits far outweigh the slight defects. The 'Hundred Pipers' dance segment counts with their best, the bungled forced-suicide of Stanley's, ditto  (Out of our sight, the gun goes off, but Stanley is revealed to be still standing; ""What happened?"" asks Ollie. ""I missed,"" Stan replies tearfully.)Hard to beat that. Forget the carping criticisms of bad/non-existent Scots accents. Those of us who are fans find little to fault here. Recommended!",1080604800,4,660,5.168224299065421
7817947,1,6301967879,"This is the worst Laurel and Hardy film, for one it isn't funny, and two the supporting cast's ability to play Scottish people was awful, more than half the people in the cast have American accents. I have an example, the  leading actress has the strongest American accent of them and she says:  ""I don't want to leave Scotland, I have lived here my whole  life"". Give me a break.",956966400,,380,4.4
7817948,4,6301967879,"While BONNIE SCOTLAND doesn't qualify as a classic, it's still lots of fun for Laurel and Hardy fans.  The film's main problem is it's uncomfortable grafting of the boy's comedy onto a melodramatic B-picture storyline.  June  Lang and William Janney are the romantic leads, but unfortunately their  roles are rather shallow and unsympathetic. Thankfully, Stan and Ollie's  scenes are good enough to keep the film moving and enjoyable.  Highlights  include the boys innocently wreaking havoc in a Scottish boarding house,  their improvised dance to ""One Hundred Pipers,"" and Stan's  constant inability to keep in step with the rest of the Scottish army unit!  There are also good comic moments from James Finalyson, Mary Gordon and  diminutive Daphne Pollard (hilarious as a cockney chambermaid).  The  picture and sound on this video transfer are sharp and clear.",947289600,11,863,5.303703703703704
