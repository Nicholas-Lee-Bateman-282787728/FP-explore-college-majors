7975728,2,B00007F8OD,"This DVD is pretty worthless, it's just one lady talking the whole time.. hardly any boating video showing you examples or practical advice. each section is a minute long it seems and barely covers any actual material.",1115510400,7,218,4.918918918918919
7975729,1,B00007F8OD,"This ""talking head"" video covers all the topics of boating, but provides little or no useful information you can take with you on the water.  It is well produced but void of real content.  I was very disappointed in it and would not recommend its purchase to anyone.

The format throughout is a woman lecturing.  She does a fine job of reading the scripts, but I expected much more from a DVD.  Topics like trailering, docking, knots, navigation, and more would have been excellent if actual video of boats had been used to demonstrate.  Instead, its just 3 hours of a nice lady lecturing, and a few marginally useful graphics.  This DVD is little more than a book read onto a DVD and much less useful than a book.

I'm still looking for a good DVD or video that demonstrates boating tips, as such a video would be very useful to beginners or others.",1100390400,12,850,4.474025974025974
