6168696,5,B00HLSW674,"The film opens with the usual impossible rescue scene. This time it is to rescue Wesley Snipes who will be known as Dr. Death. To his dismay they did so because they needed a fifth for a mission, one that fails. Stallone must go after Mel Gibson, who is not dead, really, but decides to retire his team because he fears for their life. Kelsey Grammer helps him recruit a new team, one that is more akin to an MIB force which includes Kellen Lutz, Ronda Rousey, and Victor Ortiz. Things go their formulaic way and the old guys plus the very talkative Antonio Banderas join the picture...again.

Harrison Ford flew a helicopter like Hans Solo, Jet Li had a minor role that we can see expanding, and of course Arnold is back.

The film is lengthy and spends time to quickly develop all the new players. The banter was not as good as the previous films, but was still acceptable. Banderas' character has ""Peter Sellers"" potential as a screw up who seems to luck into things.

What best came out of this film was the potential for the next one.

Terry Crews has a very short role in this film, as he is severely injured right away and in the hospital until the end of the film. The rest of the guys from the other films are still here too. Lots of violence, action and street language. Not for children until 16 at least.",1504483200,,541,4.645833333333333

Sure, the aging stars can be lack-luster, but we can't throw MOMMY and DADDY off the train- kids and young adults still need to learn from their elders.",1488326400,2,533,4.610526315789474

Same basic 80's action movie plot and execution but the PG-13 rating really hinders the movie from being better. Too many quick cuts away from deaths, less overall intensity throughout the film. Weakest of the three for sure. Mel kills it as the villain, I wish he'd take more rolls like this.

6170277,3,B00HLSW674,"There is just one problem with Expendables 3: if you take away the scenes with bam-boom action, what's left is stale-sounding jokes and expressions of mild psychopathy. The plot, as far as it exists, involves former CIA men headed by Mel Gibson, fighting against Sylvester Stallone's current CIA group, which includes Harrison Ford, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Dulgren. No wonder, then, that the film's real story is about age and for how long one can excel as a mercenary soldier. Given that a group of people in their 20s and 30s in the film is ultimately replaced by those in the sexagenarian and septuagenarian brackets, the only truly expendables are the young. 2 3/4 stars",1482105600,,679,4.964912280701754

6170470,4,B00HLSW674,"Sylvester Stallone establishes a franchise in this third installation. This is the best one yet in the series because of its cast. The addition of a female is particularly fun. A great show for those who like watching things blow up and bad guys get their druthers, or if you just want to see some oldy but goody actors hold their own with a new generation. Although it is enjoyable as a stand alone, a full appreciation of plot and characters hinges on knowing what took place in the prior two movies in this series.",1481932800,,517,4.4526315789473685

6170771,4,B00HLSW674,"After the success of the sequel, everyone knew the Expendables was destine to become a trilogy, because after all, there were still a few action stars who hadn't gotten in on the action (pardon the pun). This time however things did get a little out of hand, as one can see by the enormous cast in the movies poster. the Expendables added something this time around that the other two films were severely lacking in, comedy, whether it was intentional or not. Included in this were how Barney's team had to be bigger than ever to fight the baddest guy of them all, Mel Gibson. Harrison Ford and Arnold Schwarzenegger taking part in a machine gun battle from a golf cart, since they obviously can't run anymore, and they even managed to sneak in a joke about Wesley Snipes being in prison for not paying his taxes. New editions included Kellan Lutz, Kelsey Grammer, Ronda Rousey, and various other UFC personalities, leading to a lot more hand to hand stuff than in previous films, but much like the other films, the third installment of the Expendables was an action junkies dream come true. There were non-stop explosions, gun battles, and bodies, all surrounded by a very thin and improbable story. We don't watch these movies for the story or even the characters, we watch these films simply for the adrenaline rush. In that context alone, Expendables 3 hits the target every time, but if you're looking for a good story, great performances, or even a reason behind the madness, then you're watching the wrong series. When it comes to the Expendables think less Die Hard and more Michael Bay.",1481500800,,1595,4.720430107526882

Sure the younger generation are quicker but often not as smart or cautious as those of us that have been around for a while.
My point is how many Navy Seal instructors are in their 20's or for that Matter the Delta force or Top Gun School My guess is none;instead the ranks are filled with older far more experience men.
My point is that the Expendables was suppose to be about middle aged men not youngsters in there 20's.

6174823,5,B00HLSW674,"I like movies that are full of recognizable faces, even when I can't remember their names.  John Wayne made several movies that included lots of stars; and NO I don't remember their names.  In any event it seems that using lots of stars can make an  unbelievable movie somewhat believable.  After all, if you watched a Rambo movie, you already know how tough Stallone is.  And if you've seen a Terminator movie you know how tough Schwarzenegger is.  And even in real life Rhonda Rousey could be the bouncer she portrayed.

It was nice to see the old actions star again and they had some great lines in the movie that called back to their previous roles, but that's about the best I can say really. The effects looked rather pitiful in comparison to other movies, the explosions looked very fake and computer animated in many cases. And perhaps the biggest problem is that the older well known stars all had to take a backseat most of the movie for a newer younger cast of people that I really cared nothing for. Even the Antonio Banderas couldn't have saved this movie as his character seemed very out of place considering the action movies he's been in before. The introduction of him, Mel Gibson, and Wesley Snipes felt like limited, and Gibson's and Snipes' characters were great for the time they had.

6178577,3,B00HLSW674,"Worst of the series.  I think the premise could maybe continue on TV with a new cast; the senior citizen group has had it.  The story is boring with little suspense, the movie longer than need be and the actors (most of them) seem tired.  Then, even a top of the A list actor like Harrison Ford would have a problem with this script.  For the price, you may want to complete your set, but if you're not collecting and really want to see it, use a streaming service and save money.",1465171200,,480,4.184782608695652

I really like most if not all of the actors in this and really see nothing wrong in pulling people in left right and center as long as their is some place in the script for them.  But it helps to have watched a few of each actors' action films to catch the otherwise non-sequitur gibes and almost sight gags.

I have watched this movie twice since it cam out and will probably get a copy for my library.  I do recommend it as an enjoyable suspension of reality and mood lightening experience.  Don't expect much else, they didn't write it into the script!",1464566400,,773,4.370629370629371

But started out great especially with snipes early on but his character got wasted and diminished.statham fights reduced age definitely showing up on these icons maybe thats the point maybe with influxing younger talent very telling. Almost like the avengers on geritol. Dont get me wrong cool as heck to see this group together as father time is catching up. Statham definitely his time now..gibson ending almost rehashing final fight in lethal weapon vs busey. Slow typical nothing new like I say great typical action kind of highlights all of there careers. First still the best..jet li in for a cup of coffee..but all in all a rental ( or free with prime.lol) to kill a couple of hours.kill being the key word..stuff flying everywhere..so all in all not bad like I say liked it typical nothing new gave you what you should expect..maybe they really are becoming expendable....,1464393600,,1002,4.93491124260355

6179682,4,B00HLSW674,"I liked the movie. Unfortunately, once I opened it (past the 30 day return policy) I found there was no UV Code/Digital HD. This to me borders on false advertising (or just very poor quality control in the manufacturing process). Beware- Lionsgate products are questionable.",1463356800,,274,5.111111111111111

6179685,4,B00HLSW674,"A good movie for having the guys' over for a night of mindless entertainment with plenty of explosions and really fake shoot 'em ups. The best part of the movie was Rhonda Rousey kicking butt. I think I would like to Rhonda take on Jason Statham, I think she can take him.",1463356800,,272,4.25

6179688,3,B00HLSW674,Mega stars alone don't always make great movies. It is a typical action blow everything up movie. I enjoy watching this kind of movie but it's just an average movie to me.,1463356800,,171,4.375

6179715,4,B00HLSW674,What are you looking for?  It is full of action and muscles and blow ups. That doesn't leave much for the story but that's ok there is notich to that. Just fun,1463270400,,159,3.96875

6179739,4,B00HLSW674,This is the third time we watched the movie - first time in a movie theater. Really good when you want to watch a movie to relax and you like action movies. Don't try it if you have your mind-cap on.,1463184000,,199,3.8780487804878048
6179740,5,B00HLSW674,"And, they've done it again! Whether you can believe it or not, this one is even funnier, and has more lines and innuendos referring to previous action movies than the other two. You can't just watch it once. You have to watch it over and over to catch the lines you missed from laughing before. We have watched this movie several times already, and still try to catch new references to previous action movies. Besides, it has a good story line to it also. You can't ask for more than that.",1463184000,,489,4.384615384615385

6179780,3,B00HLSW674,Don't expect an intellectually challenging movie. It is strictly a shoot 'em up movie with lots of action and no link whatsoever to reality. But OK if you're looking for some nostalgia.,1463184000,,185,4.8125
6179781,4,B00HLSW674,Good action scenes. Minus 1 star due to how scary Stallone looked from all of the Botox in his face.,1463184000,,100,4.05

8633362,5,B00HLSW674,"All of the old guys still got IT. In fact, they are so seasoned they have better star quality than the new crew even though I absolutely love the mixing of both. Antonio Banderas is so funny. Arnold Schwarzenegger can fire a gun like no other. He is the Mr. Olympia of gun shooting. Although Antonio made gun shooting look artful and poetic in one slo-mo scene. Sylvester  Stallone is the element that keeps it all together. Mel Gibson played such a perfect villain. This cast is so 90s feel good. Would have liked Chuck in this one, too. Dolph is always funny. Please don't ever cast Tom Hanks in one of these. Thatll kill it...unless hes the villain. Theres just a clan of 90s stars who are so weird now that they're disturbing to watch: Tom Hanks, Jim Carrey, Tom Cruise, and Will Smith. Id like Michelle Pfeifer in the next somehow.  Shes cool. Id like Garth Brooks too if possible.",1530748800,,886,4.462962962962963
