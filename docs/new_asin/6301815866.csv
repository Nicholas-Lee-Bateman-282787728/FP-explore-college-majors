7815881,5,6301815866,"This documentary is as relevant now as it was when it first was released.

It relies on the personal account of John Connally, and the opinions of Dr. Cyril Wecht and even more importantly, Dr. Joseph Dolce.  Dr. Dolce was Edgewood Arsenal's Chief wound ballistics consultant, but was NOT called by the Warren Commission to testify on the record due to his dissenting views.

Perhaps the most important point that Dr. Dolce makes is that their experiments proved Commission Exhibit 399 (CE399 or the Magic Bullet) could not have been undeformed, EVEN AT LOW VELOCITY (which refutes later experiments by Lattimer et al).

Not even the documentary Beyond The Magic Bullet revises the premise in Reasonable Doubt.  In fact, it disproves the Single Bullet Theory (SBT) i.e., bullet exits JFK's chest (not his neck), strikes less rib bone (two thinner laterally vs. one longitudinally) and yet emerges with more damage than CE399.  Also, the simulated torso omitted other bones.

My only complaint is that I haven't seen a DVD version of this excellent documentary.",1402099200,,1060,5.057471264367816
7815882,5,6301815866,"Possibly the best rebuttal for the Warren Commission's ""Single Bullet Theory"" on video. Unless you're a subscriber to the SBT, you should have no disappointments watching this one.

As little as 13 % of Americans believe that Oswald alone killed President Kennedy. This is based on the physical evidence and the Zapruder film.

Since Oswald's rifle, in the hands of an expert, required 2.3 secs. to fire 2 shots, and Kennedy and Connally reacted to their wounds 1.6 secs apart, they were either hit by separate shots and thus separate gunmen, or they were hit by the same bullet fired by a single gunman.

Since there could be no second gunman, hence the SBT was born.

So convincing was the evidence of separate shots, that the Secret Service and the FBI never subscribed to the SBT. They also knew that one shot had missed, causing the Secret Service to comment that it was "" a plot"".

The experts tear to shreds the SBT theory in this video. Gov. Connally's doctor, a wounds ballistics expert who tested the ammunition and a coroner with experience in gunshot wounds.

Very convincing.",1169510400,,1088,4.76063829787234
7815883,5,6301815866,"The reason that this program is the best I have seen so far is that it stays faithful to the known evidence.

Witnesses with fantastic, but unsupported claims, are not presented in this program.

New tests, to either disprove or prove the Warren Commission single bullet theory were not conducted or presented.

Instead the producers of this program decided to rely on the documentary evidentiary base.

Here is just one example---destructive of the official theory that LHO (or anyone else) fired a shot into both Pres. Kennedy and Gov. Connally.

1.  The single bullet theory was proven false by the Warren Commission investigators assigned to study the ability of the Mannlicher Carcano ammunition to cause the damage alleged to JFK and Gov. Connally and emerged nearly pristine.  The key investigator for the government was Dr. Joseph Dolce.  He is shown on camera discussing the results of his ballistic experiments that disproved Arlen Specter's Single Bullet Theory.

This was recorded in a meeting memorandum on April 21, 1964 with Warren Commission attorney's.  They did not like Dolce's results and therefore did not include him as a witness in front of the Warren Commission.  But the results remain essential and negate the official theory.  Dolce points out--again, on camera--that he proved with experiments that the Single Bullet Theory is false.

Now reader, you have to ask yourself, why a paid government expert for the Warren Commission who disproves their theory is not discussed by all the Warren Commission defenders?  You can't even begin to discuss the ballistic evidence in this case unless you are aware of Dolce's tests and the April 21, 1964 WC memorandum on his statements to the lawyers (who did not want to hear what he had to say).

The rest of the program is as definite in pulverizing the official theory as the dean of the assassination critics, Harold Weisberg, top historian on the case, David R. Wrone (UW-Stevens Point) and the very knowledgeable coroner, Cyril Wecht and Connally doctor, Robert Shaw, take apart the official theory piece by piece, with---and here's the key---only official evidence.

No Oliver Stone theories are discussed.  No Mark Lane diversions are mentioned.  And no mainstream media official fictions are advanced.

That's the beauty of this program.  Careful, deliberate destruction of the Warren Commission claims that LHO, by himself, killed JFK and wounded Gov. Connally, using only the Commission's evidence.

Well done.

Kudos to the Selbys for this suberb analysis and fascinating narrative of one of the greatest cover ups of all time.",1130457600,7,2606,5.154761904761905
7815884,1,6301815866,"""Reasonable Doubt: The Single-Bullet Theory"" (put out by ""White Star Video"") is a 51-minute documentary, made in 1988, that attempts to totally discredit and trash the ""SBT"". However, it fails miserably in its endeavor. After one viewing of this program by this writer, it was destined to be ""trashed"" itself -- right into the garbage can.

Since this program was produced, more enlightening information has been revealed that shows that the SBT does, in fact, work! And ""fits"" perfectly with the known evidence in the John F. Kennedy assassination.

If you want to see a much better and more thoroughly-researched documentary program on the subject of the SBT, then I'd urge anyone to seek out a DVD of the outstanding and very compelling program entitled ""JFK: Beyond The Magic Bullet"", which was aired in November 2004 by ""The Discovery Channel"" as part of its series of ""Unsolved History"" programs. That DVD is, unfortunately, not available here at Amazon.com (to date). But it can be ordered directly through the Discovery Channel's website/store.

""Beyond The Magic Bullet"" proves beyond virtually ALL doubt that the Single-Bullet Theory was certainly a doable act from Presidential assassin Lee Harvey Oswald's 60-foot-high perch on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building in Dallas, Texas.

That remarkable Discovery Channel program shows the results of an elaborate test that attempted to simulate (with all possible accuracy) the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy. The fatal bullet wound to JFK's head is not the subject of the intriguing re-creation; instead, it's the highly-controversial ""SBT"" that is tackled with skill and precision in that 86-minute Cable TV broadcast.

For the ""Unsolved History"" documentary, a very realistic re-creation of the Dealey Plaza assassination was performed by a group of researchers in Australia in October 2004, with chilling results. Results that look quite convincing indeed.

The research team used two simulated (but highly-accurate) human ""torsos"" as ""stand-ins"" for the two victims (President Kennedy and Texas Governor John B. Connally, who was seriously wounded during the Dallas shooting).

The test resulted in the Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5mm Western Cartridge bullet (exactly like the kind Lee Oswald used in 1963) passing through both torsos and emerging in good condition (but not as pristine as ""CE399"", which is the so-called ""Magic Bullet"" or ""Stretcher Bullet"").

But the likely reason this test bullet didn't mirror CE399 exactly is that the simulated shot accidentally struck more ribs within the Connally model than actually were broken in Mr. Connally's own body on 11/22/63. (Which was no doubt due to the fact that the gunman performing the re-creation missed the target on JFK's upper back just slightly, hitting the torso a little to the left of the target representing the actual back wound.)

But even so, the simulated bullet still wasn't nearly as deformed as many/most CTers seem to feel CE399 HAD to be after causing seven wounds in two men. The Connally back wound was also ""elongated"" (keyhole-shaped) in nature, just exactly like the real deal from 1963.

The SBT has been PROVEN a likely possibility given the known wound locations. Because, after seeing such successful tests, we would have to believe the even MORE unlikely scenario (if the SBT is not how the shooting occurred) that includes a SEPARATE bullet striking Governor Connally's back at PRECISELY the same spot where a possible SBT shot would also have struck him. What are the odds of that?

Another very impressive test in the Discovery Channel program was the firing of a Western Cartridge (CE399-like) bullet through a solid block of wood (log) -- with the bullet penetrating more than half the way through the lengthy log and emerging in EXACTLY the same condition as CE399! It could have been a precise duplicate for CE399, right down to the lead oozing slightly from the core base.

That ""log"" test, again, illustrates just how tough the Carcano ammunition is. That test is nearly as impressive as the final ""SBT"" torso test. Because the bullet exactly mirrored CE399 after striking NOTHING BUT a hard, solid object!

Animator Dale K. Myers, along with author and former Los Angeles prosecutor Vincent T. Bugliosi are also featured in that Discovery Channel program, providing insight and commmentary. Both Mr. Myers and Mr. Bugliosi are noted experts in the field of the Kennedy assassination, with Myers, in fact, winning an Emmy Award for his excellent computer animation work that he presented for an ABC-TV documentary program on the Kennedy case in November 2003, which also shows that the SBT is certainly not an impossibility.

Mr. Bugliosi was involved in one of the most riveting ""JFK-related"" events of all time -- that being the 1986 ""Mock Trial"" of Lee Harvey Oswald. Bugliosi, as prosecuting attorney, squared off in the simulated ""trial"" against Oswald defense counsel Gerry Spence. The 21-hour trial featured a real judge and 12 sworn jurors, plus real witnesses in the JFK case (such as Dealey Plaza eyewitness Charles Brehm and Oswald acquaintance Ruth Paine, plus many other principal players in the actual case and ensuing investigation into the crime, including Cyril Wecht). Wecht is also featured in the ""Reasonable Doubt"" program featured on this Amazon webpage. Mr. Bugliosi was successful in his efforts to ""convict"" Oswald in the mock trial, with the jury ultimately delivering a ""Guilty"" verdict in the unique court proceeding.

A good example of how the ""Reasonable Doubt"" program on this VHS tape gives misleading (and just flat-out wrong information) is the portion where the conspiracy promoters claim that Governor Connally could NOT POSSIBLY have held his hat in his right hand after his right wrist had been shattered by a bullet. This notion is a fallacy, and proven so by John Connally's own wife (Nellie), who was sitting right next to her husband during the shooting. Mrs. Connally has always maintained that the Governor held the cowboy hat in his hand during the ENTIRE trip to the hospital! So much for that theory.

In Summary ........

I'd recommend skipping the ""Reasonable Doubt"" video, and picking up the Discovery Channel documentary instead, which provides sound, logical evidence that supports the idea that the ""SBT"" is not just a ""Lone Nutter's pipe dream"". Far from it in fact. It's very likely the ONLY possible way that both men could have been injured, given the known wounds in the victims, PLUS the KNOWN facts that CE399 was scientifically linked to BOTH Oswald's rifle AND to bullet fragments found inside Governor Connally.",1107993600,,6661,5.16991643454039
7815885,5,6301815866,This video is a must see for all JFK reasearchers!  There is evidence on this tape that can't be challenged by anybody.  Reasonable doubt is my favorite reasearch video for the JFK assassination. I have seen it on tv and watch the video alot. In this video watch what the experts say about the single bullet theroy. I recommend this video for anybody who is interested in the assassination.  A real winner.,1012003200,5,406,4.611111111111111
