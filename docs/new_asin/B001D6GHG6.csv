8291901,5,B001D6GHG6,"This DVD is  great resource for any woodworker, but especially if you are new to handplaning as I was when I purchased this DVD.  Lonnie gives very clear steps on the proper use of the hand plane once you have made the right plane selection.  I reference back to this DVD before I start a project to make sure my planing technique is solid and for a refresher on Lonnie's sharpening instructions so my blade has a good sharp edge.

Another reason I really like the DVD is that not only do I get the information from Lonnie as I would from one of his books, but the DVD contains video footage of Lonnie demonstrating the techniques he describes.  A video is worth a thousand words to me!  And where else can you get great information on bevel up planes?

I HIGHLY recommend the DVD.  The information and techniques within the DVD are coming from a well respected craftsman and teacher with many years of experience and will help you increase your skills in the proper use of the hand plane.  Thank you Lonnie!",1243296000,,1008,4.434782608695652
8291902,5,B001D6GHG6,"The DVD covers my three most used planes; the smooth plane, block plane and shoulder plane.  The DVD emphasizes the importance of cutting angles and how to choose the right cutting angle for the task.  The sharpening method illustrated is probably the fastest to achieve and maintain a sharp edge and, best of all, no jigs.  Nothing takes the fun out of planing faster than a dull edge and a lengthy sharpening method.  There is a vast amount of information in this DVD which covers proper technique, reading grain, dealing with difficult grain, practical applications and a section on flattening wide boards.  It is easy to watch and understand, but unless your a master you'll be watching it again.  It's a great resource.  The DVD is well organized with chapters to quickly get back to the information when you need it and a great refresher before the next planing task.",1242777600,,873,4.78
8291903,5,B001D6GHG6,"The video covers a variety of planes both bevel up and bevel down with blade sharpening and plane set up and use. It gives the basics with sufficient detail, yet it is not so long as to become either boring or too redundant. His presentation is clear, easy to understand, and includes demonstrations on the procedures. The camera work is outstanding. It's a great video! I would also recommend his video on dovetails.

 My memory isn't what it was some years ago and many of the things I have learned about planing in class, or practiced when working on projects, will be forgotten over time. This review from Lonnie Bird will fill in the gaps and bring me up to date.",1242604800,,668,4.512396694214876
8291904,5,B001D6GHG6,"Would you like to improve your planing skills?  Would you like to have a better understanding of how handplanes work?  This DVD has that information and more.  I like the fact that you can watch Lonnie work on a blanket chest while he discusses problems and shares techniques for solving the problems.

In this DVD you will see how to use smoothing planes (old and new design), block planes, and shoulder planes. You get a good understanding of the parts of the plane, how it works, and what plane best fits the application. There is information on how to sharpen and tune your plane plus a great discussion on difficult woods, reading the grain, and understanding the importance of cutting angles.  This DVD has been extremely helpful to me.  Thanks Lonnie!",1241740800,4,758,4.748091603053435
8291905,5,B001D6GHG6,"This video provides excellent information for those wanting to learn and improve their handplane skills.  I took a class from Lonnie this past April and he is a GREAT instructor!  This video was also helpful to me as a review of some of the things we learned in class.  If you are new to handplanes this video is indispensable, but even the seasoned woodworker will find useful information.  I would also highly recommend Lonnie's video on dovetails.",1241481600,,450,4.805194805194805
8291906,5,B001D6GHG6,"I have and still am enjoying Mastering Handplanes by Lonnie Bird. While I am still not a master at it,I didn't expect to be just by watching a video. Now when you combine that with practice according to Lonnie's instructions,then you are getting somewhere. Believe me ,the man knows what he is talking about. I think he touched on everything needed to get results you will be proud of.",1241395200,,385,4.594202898550725
8291907,3,B001D6GHG6,"Before you pluck down the cash you need to realize this thing is SHORT.  Less than 40 minutes.  It does cover some basics, very basic.  The tuning portion of the presentation describes adjustment, not tuning.  The blade preparation segment demonstrated how to sharpen a blade TWICE (once on a normal blade and one on a low-angle).  You are practically shown the same thing again.  Why?  Time is precious when you only get 30+ minutes.  I would have hoped he could have put more content in than show me this twice.  I think most people would get alot more for the money from Garret Hack's ""Handplane"" book than from this DVD. The information Bird does share is solid. Just not nearly enough to make you a ""Master"" of handplanes as the title indicates.

I was VERY impressed with Lonnie Bird's two books I have: ""Shaping Wood"" and ""Period Furniture Details.""  That makes this purchase all the more frustrating.",1239494400,2,908,4.719745222929936
