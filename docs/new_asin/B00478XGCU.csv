4281979,5,B00478XGCU,"I just got done watching this Blueray version of Live From the O2 by Westlife.  WOW is all I can say.  I have all their concert DVD's and I have to say that this one is really special.  I have never heard Nicky and Kian sing so confidently in concert before.  They really blew me away.  And Shane...oh man, this guys vocals will just blow you out of the water.  Shane really looked relaxed and happy at this show and his vocals were just amazing.  The soul of Westlife is Mark.  This man can just tear your heart out and give you goose bumps when he sings.  Success has not spoiled this group.  They just grow and mature with each new release and that is how they sell out everywhere they go.  Still miss Brian though.  Hopefully they will reconsider and let him rejoin for the next album and tour.  As for this DVD...simply amazing.",1318377600,2,833,4.296774193548387
4281980,5,B00478XGCU,"From the moment that Westlife appeared on stage, I got goosebumps. I've loved this group from afar (well America) and this is the closest I can get to seeing them live. The video is crisp and clear and the audio is outstanding. My favorite singer is Mark Feehily and his vocals don't disappoint in this video.

Where We Are is in my top 2 Westlife albums and I highly recommend this video for any pop music fan!",1299196800,,411,4.337662337662338
4281981,5,B00478XGCU,"Being a huge Westlife fan of course I love their dvd. This tour was not nearly as big or as epic as the Croke Park 10th anniversary show, but it was still fantastic! Living in the USA and not able to go see the boys live, I really appreciate these dvd's. If you are a Westlife fan, and even of you aren't, definitely worth the buy.",1297296000,8,331,4.03030303030303
4281982,5,B00478XGCU,"I'd never seen Westlife perform in any ways before. Well, I was just a casual fan of theirs. With this blu-ray, I was so amazed by their music and talents. Every single song is great and the concert is mesmerizing. I've seen this blu-ray more than 10 times already since I bought it a few weeks ago. Each member of Westlife is a great singer! Wow, Shane and Mark are just amazing! It's always thrilling to watch them sing ""I'll see you again."" I'm glad to be a true fan of Westlife thanks to this blu-ray. The PQ and AQ could have been better but overall a very enjoyable concert blu-ray!",1294963200,,588,4.306306306306307

8417853,5,B00478XGCU,I had one Westlife CD that I listened to a lot around 2008. Life happened but I rediscovered them this year and I can't believe I let them get away for so long. I came across their song I'll See You Again and that was it. I watched their videos on YouTube and loved the selections from this concert. I had it have the DVD. I'm so glad I found them again but sad they are no longer performing together.,1476144000,,401,4.025
