8186857,5,B000OVLAAE,"I was at Rolling Thunder 2006.  I attended Rolling Thunder for 17 years straight, until I retired back to South Dakota and I miss going every year.  To those who have never been to a Rolling Thunder in DC, I promise, you go once - you will be back!!!  The sad part about the whole thing, is our government is not hearing the thunder to do something about brining our MIA's home!!!  Roll on my Brothers/Sisters!!!",1453248000,,412,4.381578947368421

8186859,5,B000OVLAAE,"I made this Run For The Wall the year this video was made. Video gives good account of what RFTW is about. Rode from St. Louis (picked up run in Wentezille MO VFW and rode too DC). Did Rolling Thunder before heading home.

As a Vietnam Vet this was quite an emotional experience.
