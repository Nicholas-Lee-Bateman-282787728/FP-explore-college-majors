8751603,4,B01BUX7Z3K,"I enjoyed Alice in the cities the most of this trilogy. Wrong Move and Kings of the road were odd by my experience, but interesting. They were odd in such a way that I continued watching purely from an interest to see how they ended. In hindsight, I probably would not have purchased the Road Trilogy had I known more about them, but having seen a few movies from Wenders, I thought this 3 movie pack a good place to start. In fairness, they date from the 1970s and are early examples of Wenders work. The 4 stars are an in between rating. For Alice in the cities alone I would give 4 stars, while I would rate Wrong Move and Kings of the road, 3 stars. All movies state at the beginning that they are restored, and in this, Wenders has done a fine job.",1501977600,,753,4.164383561643835

8751605,5,B01BUX7Z3K,"Awesome box set with the definitive versions of these 3 Wenders films. If you had a chance to watch the films during the MoMA retrospective from 2014 than these versions should be familiar to you. Alice in den Statdten in particular was in need for a remastered (2K) transfer, as previously available versions were infamously poor. The extras are plenty and the booklet included features photos from Wenders' book, 'Once.'",1480032000,2,422,5.042857142857143
8751606,4,B01BUX7Z3K,"I LOVE road movies, and enjoy the films of Wim Wenders (particularly Paris, Texas which is my 2nd favorite film of all time) so how could I not get my hands on this collection?
Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this set. The films look stunning and are of excellent quality (typical for Criterion). 'Alice in the Cities' and 'Kings of the Road' are presented in black and white, while 'Wrong Move' is in color.
'Alice in the Cities' (1974) runs for 113 minutes and is probably the most well known film in this set. It is a beautiful and subtle film. Though slow in pace, I never felt bored watching it. An interesting experience with the added bonus of great performances by both Rdiger Volger (who appears in all 3 films in this set) and Yella Rottnder as Alice. They both display a wonderful bond in this film that is a joy to watch, and I highly recommend it. 8/10
Next in the trilogy is 'Wrong Move' (1975), my personal favorite of the set. The only part of the trilogy to be presented in color, 'Wrong Move' runs for 104 minutes. Now this film feels more like a road movie than any of the others. The character dynamics in this film are very interesting and each of the actors plays their part well. Overall, I was entertained by this film and, as I said above, it was my favorite in this set. 8.5/10
Now we get to the final film, 'Kings of the Road' (1976) which runs for an exhausting 176 minutes. I gotta be honest and say I did not enjoy this film as much as the others. It has some interesting moments and developments, but I feel as if it's excessive runtime bogged it down. I don't mind extremely long movies, but they have to have substance to merit the runtime. Unfortunately this film just didn't do it for me. There is merit to the film (the directing and acting are still top notch) but I definitely couldn't get into it as much as the others. 6/10
Finally, there's a nice little booklet that comes with the films with a brilliant collection of essays. The special features are interesting, as usual Criterion pulled out all the stops.
Overall, I'd say this set is worth the money. If road movies are your thing, and you don't mind black and white, then give it a try.",1476144000,7,2186,4.386699507389163
