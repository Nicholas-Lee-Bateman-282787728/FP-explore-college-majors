5072552,4,B007AND2W8,a move worth watching if you have a open mind. if you don't then don't bother watching this brillant piece.,1370736000,4,107,4.4
5072553,2,B007AND2W8,"Reminiscent of the simplistic analysis pervasive in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, Mr. Friedman is not reporting, but rather seeking to support his obvious preconceived hypothesis. Namely, the theory that the attack was a function of Arabic feelings of inferiority and jealousy of American institutions. Two stars for the revealing look into the 2003 zeitgeist -- the root of arrogance that lead us into our failed wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Update December 20th, 2013:

I read the NYT's Meaning Of a Skull By Thomas Friedman from 2003 today. Here's a quote I thought added to the original review:

""I will whoop it up only when the Iraqi people are really free, not free just to loot or to protest against us, but free to praise us out loud, free to speak their minds in any direction, because they have built a government and rule of law that can accommodate pluralism and stand in the way of evil returning.""

We used to call this kind of avocation for war -- yellow journalism or jingoism.  Unfortunately, TV punditry (his real public voice) a demeanor of sincerity, integrity, candor -- coupled with a Pulitzer Prize introduction seem to win the day.

Btw, his 2002 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary - ""for his clarity of vision, based on extensive reporting, in commenting on the worldwide impact of the terrorist threat"".",1356220800,18,1330,4.8628318584070795
5072554,2,B007AND2W8,"Film brings out many motives of the alleged 9/11 plotters, but really falls short as to providing proof they had the means to complete attacks on 9/11. Keep searching Mr. Friedman. I'm not convinced.  Includes good interviews with the Arab/Muslim peoples and their different points of view about America and 9/11.",1348444800,4,313,5.137254901960785
5072555,5,B007AND2W8,"Thomas Friedman's Report searches for the roots of 9/11, but what it really finds are not only the roots of 9/11, but a prophetic statement of the Arab Spring. Friedman's development of the 9/11 hijackers is lacking, but his search for the true cause of Middle East hatred towards the West is more than fruitful. Naturally he could not have known at the time, but his interviews exposed sentiment that is at the base of the Arab Spring.
Certainly worth watching. The Arab Spring may not have seemed so unpredictable if the premises touched on in this film were more widely exposed.
As an aside, the most interesting connections for me were about humiliation being the most under-appreciated factor in foreign policy and the view young Moslems take towards the internet.",1348272000,4,769,4.877862595419847
5072556,5,B007AND2W8,As usual Thomas Friedman has stopped me in my tracks with riveting insights.  I'm however not sold on 9/11 not being an inside job but I still find everything else in the video to be intellectually stimulating.  He's always had the gift of taking a complex issue and bringing it down to being much more easily understood.  Really a must see video.,1348099200,4,347,4.564516129032258
5072557,5,B007AND2W8,"New York Times foreign affairs columnist, Thomas L Friedman, tackles complex issues with riveting reporting.  Friedman is the perfect man for the job and manages to get incredibly insightful interviews that show how, in the case of Search for the Roots of 9/11, the Arabs view the tragedy of 9/11 and the relations of the Arab and Jewish people in Straddling the Fence.  This is a great combination.  I highly recommend this set.",1334534400,3,429,4.8493150684931505
5072558,5,B007AND2W8,"I'm a HUGE fan of Thomas L. Friedman's reporting series, and this is the best value I've seen.  Friedman digs deep in deep issues.  Straddling the Fence gives us an inside look to Jewish and Arab relations and Searching for the Roots of 9/11 takes us into the middle east to investigate the mindset of Arabs in the aftermath.  I definitely recommend this 2 disc set.  Really powerful work for a great buy.",1334534400,3,405,4.506849315068493
5072559,5,B007AND2W8,"This is undoubetedly a very sensivtive subject, but I find that Thomas L. Friendman handles it wonderfully.  This is one of the worst disasters ever to hit us in America and we need to be as informed as possible to make sure something like this never happens again.  That's what Friedman sets out to do by searching for the roots of this evil in the Middle East.  It's top quality, smart reporting that takes us inside the Middle East and leaves us much more informed in the matter from the source.  I use this film in a Current Global Issues class I teach and will continue to do so.  All Americans (and non, really) should get this film.",1334534400,5,639,4.38135593220339
5072560,5,B007AND2W8,"Thomas L. Friedman seeks to explain in this DVD the factors that contributed and ultimately caused the terrorist attack on September 11th 2001 so as to help us Americans better understand the tragedy as well as prevent similar events from occurring in the future.  His two big questions to analyze are (1) what motivated the 19 young men to board planes to kill 3,000 of our American brothers and sisters, and (2) why did so many of their fellow Arabs applaud their actions?  I believe Friedman offers some powerful insights to these questions, and is really the perfect man for the job with his past experience covering Middle Eastern affairs.  It's a very complex special that makes for an eye opening experience.  I definitely recommend buying this.",1334534400,7,752,4.897637795275591

5072566,3,B007AND2W8,"Friedman provides insight that the nightly news soundbites rarely touch on, yet his liberalism blinds him to the larger truth behind 911 and today's ISIL horrors. Islam is no more a religion of peace than the Spanish inquisition was a christian fraternal organization. Like all liberals  and journalists, the pronouncement of satanic evil  at work behind these events is not to be considered. What were left with by the Friedmans of the world is hand ringing and angst over our country's historical understanding from a Biblical context that sin/evil will rise up in our final days. This documentary is thus a window into the minds of Muslims and liberals, a place where truth is never spoken.",1424131200,2,693,4.9655172413793105

5072568,1,B007AND2W8,Not the best documentary I have every watched. Monotone speaker and boring content. Unless you are researching this topic for something I wouldn't recommend it.,1393286400,,160,5.44
5072569,3,B007AND2W8,"Whether you agree or disagree with them it's good to hear the viewpoints of people who actually live in the middle east.  But I think it would have been helpful to expand more upon their reasoning for why they feel the way they do and provide some historical context.  If one doesn't have a good grasp on the history of the area over the last 150 years or so it becomes easy to attribute their feelings to mere ""jealousy"" of the US, and I'm sooooooo tired of hearing that from people.",1391904000,5,484,4.3076923076923075

8513496,5,B007AND2W8,"In the context of 15 years after 9/1,  this film illuminates the rage we still see.  The way the war was conducted in Iraq with no regard for civilian casualties by the US almost guarantees the continuation of Islamic hatred toward the west.  We have not learned any lessons and we just signed a deal to ship more arms to prop up Saudi Arabia.  What will change?  Still Relevant.",1474329600,2,379,4.434782608695652

Thought it was always interesting to see the world from another persons perspective. The most amazing part is the amount of people taking part in honest discussion and thought. How can anyone do this if all they do is read the local paper, watch the same channel and listen to the same politicians. All of this from the convenience of their living room. What would happen if we actually started to engage without prejudice. Imagine being part of the solution instead of
part of the problem. Would your views change if suddenly you were from the middle east? Go ahead, think about it if you dare.",1471996800,2,609,4.5963302752293576
