No matter what your martial arts style is , soft or hard etc. you will never regret having Kevin Secours information in your library. This DVD set is second to none as a  knowledge base  for ""Systema"" .Mr. Secours  literally breaks  the  mechanics of the techniques  down  to their  simplest form  so that any one from a novice with  no experience to so called masters can understand their application.
If you are serious about your  knowledge in ""Systema""  get this DVD's information  into  your hands and head.  Kindest regards, Jim Williamson",1504742400,,822,4.826086956521739
