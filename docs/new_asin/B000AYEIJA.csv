2398378,4,B000AYEIJA,"The contents below are from unseen-cinema; they include the contents of a 160-page softcover Series Catalog, which is sold separately, but I think you would want.  This is clearly a labor of love; though I can't imagine trying to watch all this in a month of Sundays, I could see dipping into it from time to time.

=====================================

Disk 1: THE MECHANIZED EYE
Experiments in Technique and Form

The dynamic qualities of motion pictures are explored by cameramen and filmmakers through novel experiments in technique and form. Early cinematographers James White, ""Billy"" Bitzer, and Frederick Armitage display experimental shooting styles that wowed audiences. Other independent companies further image manipulation through creative staging, editing, and printing, such as a stunning three-screen film that predates Gance's Napoleon. Experiments by photographer Walker Evans, painter Emlen Etting, musician Jerome Hill, and the film collectives Nykino and Artkino record the world in a continual process of flux. A most extreme approach is realized by Henwar Rodakiewicz with Portrait of a Young Man (1925-31), a monumental study of natural and abstract motions.

Disk 2: THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING
American Surrealism

Edwin S. Porter and other early filmmakers used bizarre sets, fantastic costumes, and magic lantern tricks to illuminate their fantasy films. American parody supplied Douglas Fairbanks with enough unusual material to produce the truly surreal When the Clouds Roll By (1919). The expressionistic Cabinet of Dr. Calagari (1919) influenced American sensibilities throughout the 1920s as seen in Beggar of Horseback (1925), The Life and Death of 9413-A Hollywood Extra (1927) and The Telltale Heart (1928). The emphasis shifted when amateurs J.S. Watson, Jr., Joseph Cornell, and Orson Welles crafted a unique variety of American surrealism on film unfettered by European concerns.

Disk 3: LIGHT RHYTHMS
Music and Abstraction

The rhythmic elements of cinema are explored by artists and filmmakers fascinated by the abstract qualities of light. The American authors of avant-garde classics Le Retour &aacute; la raison (1923), Ballet m&eacute;canique (1923-24), An&eacute;mic cin&eacute;ma (1926), and Une Nuit sur le Mont Chauve (1934), are finally acknowledged for their seminal artistic achievements made in Europe. Pioneer abstract films by Ralph Steiner, Mary Ellen Bute, Douglass Crockwell, Dwinnell Grant, and George Morris are compared and contrasted with Hollywood montages created by Ernst Lubitsch, Slavko Vorkapich, and Busby Berkeley. For the first time on video, composer George Antheil's original 1924 score accompanies Fernand L&eacute;ger and Dudley Murphy's film Ballet m&eacute;canique, a truly avant-garde cacophony of image and sound.

Disk 4: INVERTED NARRATIVES
New Directions in Story-Telling

Early directors D.W. Griffith and Lois Weber develop the radical language of cinema narrative through audience-friendly melodramas made for nickelodeon theaters. Experimental fantasies are depicted in such independent productions as Moonland (c. 1926), Lullaby (1929), and The Bridge (1929-30). Depression era films by socially-conscious filmmakers reshape drama as demonstrated in Josef Berne's brooding Black Dawn (1933) and Strand and Hurwitz's biting Native Land (1937-41): each pictures a raw reality. Parody and satire find their mark in Theodore Huff's Little Geezer (1932) and Barlow, Hay and Le Roy's Even as You and I (1937). David Bradley's Sredni Vashtar by Saki (1940-43) boasts an inadvertent post-modern attitude.

12 FILMS:
The House with Closed Shutters (1910)-D.W. Griffith & G.W. ""Billy"" Bitzer
Suspense (1913)-Lois Weber & Philips Smalley
Moonland (c. 1926)-Neil McQuire & William A. O'Connor

""Sredni Vashtar"" by Saki (1940-43)-David Bradley

Disk 5: PICTURING A METROPOLIS
New York City Unveiled
Only Unseen Cinema DVD released as a SINGLE

The DVD depicts dynamic images of New York City and scenes of New Yorkers among the skyscrapers, streets, and night life of America's greatest city during a half century of progress, while at the same time showing changes in film style and the history of cinema experiments. Avant-garde moments pop up in the most unlikely of places including turn-of-the-twentieth-century actualities, commercial and radical newsreels, and Busby Berkeley's ""Lullaby of Broadway"" from Gold Diggers of 1935. Included are spectacular prints of Charles Sheeler and Paul Strand's Manhatta (1921), Robert Flaherty's Twenty-four-Dollar Island (c. 1926), Robert Florey's Skyscraper Symphony (1929), Jay Leyda's A Bronx Morning (1931), and Rudy Burckhardt's Pursuit of Happiness (1940).

Disk 6: THE AMATEUR AS AUTEUR
Discovering Paradise in Pictures

These home-made films incorporate avant-garde strategies and techniques to achieve a true sense of cinematic intimacy. Glimpses of life caught unawares are found in the home movies of Elizabeth Woodman Wright, Archie Stewart, Frank Stauffacher, and John C. Hecker. Poetic lyricism finds a voice in city symphonies: Lynn Riggs and James Hughes' A Day in Santa Fe (1931) and Rudy Burckhardt's Haiti (1938). Professionally minded films, like Theodore Case's sound tests (c. 1925) and Lewis Jacobs' Tree Trunk to Head (1938), operate from a similar home-spun perspective of sincerity. Joseph Cornell offers an enigmatic but lovely homage to childhood with Children's Trilogy (c. 1938).

20 FILMS:
7 Case Sound Tests (c. 1924-25)-Theodore Case & Earl Sponable

1126 Dewey Avenue, Apt. 207 (1939)-John C. Hecker

Disk 7: VIVA LA DANCE
The Beginnings of Cin&eacute;-Dance

Dance and film have shared the aspiration to creatively sculpt motion and time. Some of the first films ever made featured Annabelle's skirt dance, hand-painted in glowing colors. Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis' innovations found their way into Diana the Huntress (1916) and The Soul of the Cypress (1920). Highly cinematic renditions of dance evolved in Stella Simon's H&auml;nde (1928), Hector Hoppin's Joie de vivre (1934), and Busby Berkeley's ""Don't Say Goodnight"" from Wonder Bar (1934). In counterpoint, cin&eacute;-dances by Mary Ellen Bute, Douglass Crockwell, Oskar Fischinger, Norman McLaren, Ralph Steiner, and Slavko Vorkapich dispensed with actual dancers in favor of color, shape, line, and form choreographed into abstract light-play.

2398399,5,B000AYEIJA,"This is one of the most complete and extraordinary collections of old cinema i have ever had the pleasure to have owned. up until i purchased this collection i had to be satisfied with an alacarte solution for finding history on early film,some good and some not so good. This collection is 98 per cent or better as far as full filling my expectations. It was obviously well planned out and the notes about each film are definately from some one who knows what they are talking about. It is extremely entertaining,but be careful you might learn something also. If you buy the collection there is also a catalog you can purchase about the films included in this collection. It was edited and annotated by Bruce Posner who is the Curator of the Anthology Film Archives,which accounts for the excellant notations for the films. It's alittle pricey for such a small catalog but i think well worth it for some one like myself to add to the collection.
  Do yourself a favor and if you are a movie buff like myself and are interested in how it all started just spend alittle more and pay for this collection.",1273449600,3,1102,4.5606060606060606
2398400,5,B000AYEIJA,"The reviews above say it all so I can only reiterate that this is a must have collection for any cinephile or anyone interested in twentieth century art, culture and aesthetics. Obviously a labor of love and the product of a great discriminating intelligence, it includes revelation after revelation. Highlights include the fresh, funny and amazingly early ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", the exquisite film poem ""Portrait of a Young Man"" and virtually everything by Vorkapich and Ralph Steiner. Thank you Mr. Posner and everyone who contributed.",1255132800,2,540,5.290697674418604

2398402,2,B000AYEIJA,"I had the opportunity (such as it was) to watch Disk 1: THE MECHANIZED EYE at a friend's house. He was all worked up about this ""fantastic"" collection of Avant Garde Films that he had acquired, and wanted to share them with his friends. Great.

The first few clips were interesting enough; I often enjoy original material and some of them were indeed original. I liked ""Scene from Elevator Ascending Eiffel Tower"" (1900) and tried to imagine the impact that it had on its original audience. It must have been a tremendous experience for them.

""Captain Nissen Going through Whirlpool Rapids, Niagara Falls"" (1901) was great. This time my thoughts were with Captain Nissen inside his strange craft. I wondered what he was feeling.

Things went pretty well until we came to ""Pie in the Sky"" (1934-35)-Nykino: Elia Kazan, Ralph Steiner & Irving Lerner.

Then came the ambush.

""Pie in the Sky"" is a trash piece of mockery of Christianity in general and Jesus Christ specifically. In filming this self indulgent piece of garbage Elia Kazan revealed nothing of his great talent that he would bring to the screen in the years to come, but he and his cronies revealed much of their arrogance, distain for the rights of their fellow man and just plain ignorance of the subject matter that they attacked.

I'm not surprised that the compilers of this collection of films would include such a useless piece of dog dropping in an otherwise laudable collection. The same ambush tactic has been used to spread Hollywood's propaganda program of hatred of God for a number of years now. Rather I'm simply disgusted with a time in our history where apparently most people don't even see a problem with it.

They didn't see a problem with it during Hitler's rise to power in Germany either. The only difference is that then it was the Jews under attack, today it's the Christians. The hate, and the propaganda program used to express it, are the same. The film makers are good at it. And this in a country that was started by people who came seeking an end of religious persecution.

Movies and games come labeled with warnings about violence, mature subject matter, etc. but there is no warning at all when they contain anti-Christian, anti-God material. It's no wonder so many of my friends and acquaintances don't even go to the theater any more. They're fed up with being ""ambushed"" by Hollywood's anti-Christian attacks in the middle of a film that they paid a fistful of their hard earned dollars to see.

There's nothing Avant Garde about religious bigotry; it's been around for a long time.

I'll pass on this one.",1219190400,8,2605,4.7560975609756095
2398403,4,B000AYEIJA,"This collection of films is for sure, generous in quantity. There are exactly 155 films in this collection, some of them shorter than a minute, and some almost an hour long each. I believe only an experimental film fan could truly appreciate this collection to it's fullest potential, because there are some films included that are more like family home videos than ""experimental films."" Also, I was disappointed with the new music they feature in some of the film shorts, especially 'Anmic Cinna' by Marcel Duchamp. The short used to feature hypnotic music, which really went beautifully with the visual affects. However, it was replaced by a loud, annoying soundtrack that truly distracted away from the film. It occurs in other featured shorts as well, which is unfortunate. However, this collection digs deeply into all forms of the art film, and will for sure interest and delight fans of artistic and experimental film shorts. The 'Light Rhythms', 'Inverted Narratives', and 'Viva La Dance' disks are especially interesting and unique. Modern dance fans will love 'Viva La Dance' for its fascinating collection of videos capturing the dances of Loie Fuller and Tilly Losch, and what appears to be a young Isadora Duncan.

My personal favorites include 'La Cartomancienne (The Fortune Teller)' by Jerome Hill, 'Poem 8' by Emlen Etting, 'When the Clouds Roll By' by Douglas Fairbanks & Victor Fleming, 'Unreal News Reels' by Weiss Artclass Comedies, 'Jack's Dream' by Joseph Cornell, 'Le Retour  la raison' by Man Ray, 'Ballet Mcanique' by Rrose Slavy (Marcel Duchamp), 'Anmic cinma' by Rrose Slavy (Marcel Duchamp), '7 Vorkapich Montage Sequences' by Slavko Vorkapich (especially 'The Furies' and 'Maytime'), 'So This Is Paris' by Ernst Lubitsch, 'Rhythm in Light' by Mary Ellen Bute, Ted Nemeth & Melville Webber, 'Footlight Parade- By A Waterfall' by Busby Berkeley, 'Glen Falls Sequence' by Douglass Crockwell, 'Simple Destiny Abstractions' by Douglass Crockwell, 'Abstract Movies' by George L.K.

2398404,4,B000AYEIJA,"I am really happy with this collection. There is a huge amount of  film to watch- a 7 dvd set  at 99 dollars is a good value. Disk 5: PICTURING A METROPOLIS is my favorite dicc, and ""Coney Island at Night (1905)-Edwin S. Porter"" is my favorite film on this disc. The actual film quality is quite good, better than I had expected, and the ones with sound have pretty good audio quality as well. I wish there was more information on each film, but all in all I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in the history of film in America.",1197244800,4,544,4.171428571428572
2398405,5,B000AYEIJA,"As a Cinephile who travels literally thousands of miles a year in search of

amazing old films at classic film festivals & conventions, it is my opinion

this is the best box set of films I've ever seen.  Whether you're a new film

 fan or an old one looking for new kicks, this is the set for you.  From the

surreal dream sequence in Douglas Fairbanks 1919 masterpiece ""When the Clouds

 Roll By"" to Neil McGuire & William A. O'Connor's dreamy short ""Moonland"",

you'll see where Hollywood has gone to steal ideas for some of its best (and

 most well-loved) sequences.  I've personally paid more than the cost of this

 set on a 16mm film print of just one of the short films it contains. If I could have

only one collection of these films on dvd, it would be this all-encompassing

 box set.  I've never written a review before but really wanted you true film

fans out there to know about this amazing set.  It is my opinion that you

won't be sorry you bought it.  Good Luck and Happy Filmwatching!",1169078400,31,1005,4.4010989010989015
2398406,5,B000AYEIJA,"If I was getting a gift for TCM host and film historian Robert Osborne, and I knew he didn't already have this DVD set I would (a) be very surprised and (b) buy it for him. This DVD set is for film buffs who aren't satisfied with the essentials that everyone knows about - ""Birth of a Nation"", ""The Jazz Singer"", ""Frankenstein"", etc., which are great films, but don't tell the whole story of early cinema. The set was organized by Bruce Posner and runs to some nineteen hours, and is an astonishing achievement. The set consists of seven discs each of which explore a different aspect of early cinema.

Among the films included are Douglass Crockwell's ""Simple Destiny Abstractions"", plus some animations with some very good detail on the level of Windsor McCay. The 1928 version of ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" focuses more on displaying some complex optical work than the story, reducing Poe's tale to only ten minutes in length. ""Night on Bald Mountain"" is an example of pinboard animation, in which a film is made completely using shadows from a pin screen. This technique continued to be used for decades. Suspense - a 1913 melodrama in which a housewife and her baby are nearly attacked by a knife-wielding drifter - is included because of its split-screen techniques. However, it is also interesting as the beginnings of what became the psycho-thrillers that exist to this day.

For the budget conscious, the disc entitled ""PICTURING A METROPOLIS, New York City Unveiled"" is the only disc available for individual purchase. This particular disc is great for history buffs as well as film buffs for all of its views of New York City life during the period from 1890-1940. The New York City disc moves from early footage of the city, including the Edison Company's famous and poetic Coney Island at Night, to Charles Sheeler and Paul Strand's well-known Manhattan, to some work by Rudy Burckhardt, the film-maker, photographer, and painter who was also one of de Kooning's earliest friends in New York.

There are also some films financed by the depression-era WPA. Among them, Elia Kazan makes an appearance in a rather odd socialist movie about the poor of New York. There are some pictures sponsored by Labor Unions that offer 'alternative newsreels' that expose illegal business thuggery and a reactionary murder cult known as The Black Legion. Entertainment figures that are later blacklisted for their political beliefs and actions also make an appearance here - most notably, Paul Robeson, an actor often forgotten because of this. Robeson can be seen narrating a film on organized labor in this collection.

The disc entitled ""The Beginnings of Cin-Dance"" has quite a bit of variety, but is still clearly delimited, opening with Annabelle Moore's ""Butterfly Dance"" and offering near its end David Bradley's Peer Gynt of 1941, starring a teenage Charlton Heston.

Some of the best material on the set is from Hollywood, probably due to the larger budgets involved. Included in this category would be some of the original montages of Slavko Vorkapich that were done for some MGM movies. This includes a bit of film in which the entire Napoleanic war appears to play out in just two minutes. Also included is Vorkapich's opening montage to ""Crime Without Passion"" in which three banshees fly about and terrorize the streets of Manhattan. The Ernst Lubitsch ""touch"" also apparently includes montages, and there is an excerpt from 1926's ""So This is Paris"" that shows a flapper dance in montage. It does a good job of conveying the wildness of the place at that time, which is part of the central theme of the movie. Also included are Busby Berkeley's numbers ""Lullaby of Broadway"" and ""By a Waterfall"", which are light compared to the other pieces with their more hidden deeper meanings.

I could go on forever describing the contents of this DVD set, but these were the pieces that stood out the most to me, anyway. The label of ""Avant Garde"" does not really fit this collection as we know the meaning of the term today. After all, there is work here by the Edison Company, D.W. Griffith, and a host of other people who have secure places in mainstream motion picture history. The ""Avant Garde"" label is more of an indication that film as an artform during the time period covered was inherently avant-garde just because it was new. The quality of the video is quite good considering the probable shape of the originals. I personally love this set and think it is well worth the price.",1165881600,6,4499,4.843953185955787
2398407,4,B000AYEIJA,"Unseen Cinema is a fascinating collection of films, that shows the development of (and the experiment with) the film language in America from its beginning there and half a century onward.

It's title is a little misleading. Many of the films are not really Avant Garde, unless sound testing and family films showing children opening Christmas gifts is Avant Garde. The goal of the collectors is to prove that there was an Avant Garde film making from the beginning of cinema in America (America meaning films made by Americans anywhere in the world and films made by foreigners in America). They say that this was a needle-in-a-haystack search and I have to admit that sometimes I felt that they mistook the hay for a needle. So if you want to get to know early Avant Garde film making (in general) then I rather recommend ""Avant Garde - Experimental Cinema of the 1920s & 1930s"". It has many of the best bits from this collections plus others not found here.

But if you are interested in film history and it's language then this is your thing. There are many fantastic films here, some of them not available anywhere else (to the best of my knowledge), such as The Telltale Heart (Charles Klein: 1928), Portrait of a Young Man in Three Movements (Henwar Rodakiewicz: 1931) and Footnote to Fact (1933: Lewis Jacobs). Portrait of a Young Man in Three Movements (54 min) is one of the greatest cinema poems I have ever seen, a must see.

There are also some great classics, here, like:
Autumn Fire (1930-33)-Herman Weinberg (a 22 min. version!).
The Fall of the House of Usher (1926-27)-J.S. Watson, Jr. & Melville Webber
The Life and Death of 9413: A Hollywood Extra (1927)- Robert Florey & Slavko Vorkapich
The Love of Zero (1928)-Robert Florey & William Cameron Menzies
H20 (1929)-Ralph Steiner

The collection is on 7 disks, some of them more interesting than others. I liked best the first four of them. The New York disc is probably interesting to people who live there or have been there. It did little for me and I think that the Amateur disk was a waste of time.

The transfer is quite good, often surprisingly good. The music varies. Some of it is quite fitting while others are just tiring. I for one liked the music on ""Avant Garde - Experimental Cinema of the 1920s & 1930s"" better (comparing the films that both of the collections share).

The real downside to this collection is the extra material. The notes at the beginning of the films are way to short and the extra information on the PDF files are not so great either. I would like to see a better bio with filmography, and some commentaries would have been nice.

So this is a great collection for anyone seriously interested in film history and it's language. Others might want to stay away.",1159056000,19,2763,4.649590163934426
2398408,5,B000AYEIJA,"Old weird Americana takes a bow in the sprawling and richly rewarding DVD set ""Unseen Cinema."" Running almost 20 hours, the collection provides ample evidence that bold experimental filmmaking thrived in the early days of moving pictures -- decades before the avant-garde torch-bearer ""Un Chien Andalou"" seared its way onto screens in 1929.

""Unseen"" curator Bruce Posner says his goal was to ""provide the broadest possible spectrum of experimental films produced between the 1890s and 1940s"" -- roughly, the period from Thomas Edison to WWII. And so we have everything from home movies to lavish production numbers; wispy dance performances to strident union propaganda; gothic horror to languid studies of life on a farm. Many of these films have not been seen in decades and some were never screened for the public. Others, surprisingly, were products of the Hollywood studios.

The best of the early works are triumphs of the imagination over technical limits and creaky acting -- in quite a few, the wow factor remains potent. Watching the many bits of fantasy and cinematic sleights of hand, it's easy to draw a loopy line to the works of cinematic descendants such as Ray Harryhausen, Tim Burton and George Lucas.

Plenty of big names are represented in ""Unseen"" -- Welles, Sergei  Eisnenstein, Ernst Lubitsch, Charles Vidor, Victor Fleming, Douglas Fairbanks, Busby Berkeley, Elia Kazan -- but the set shows that much of the heavy lifting in cinema's toddling years was done by inspired amateurs and free-thinking artists known for their work in other media.

The individual discs are arranged by theme, with titles such as ""The Devil's Plaything"" (surrealism and fantasy), ""The Amateur as Auteur"" (home movies) and ""Inverted Narratives"" (storytelling). New York City merits its own disc, with 29 films set in the metropolis (this fascinating time capsule is available separately, retail $24.99).

For orientation, there are informal but to-the-point on-screen notes before the films. The lack of commentaries undercuts the set's many obvious academic applications -- even so, it's a mind-expanding film course in a box. For extra credit, filmographies and biographical information can be accessed via DVD-ROM.

Some of the 155 shorts and excerpts have new recordings of their original music, some have newly written scores and others remain totally silent. In the case of the mind-bending ""Ballet mecanique"" (1923-24) the complex original score wasn't recorded as the filmmaker intended until five years ago. The DVD set's audio tracks sound as if they came from the same shop, cutting down on jarring transitions and smoothing the way for extended viewing.

The source materials -- rounded up from 60 or so archival collections around the globe -- were restored from 35mm and 16mm prints. The full-screen images are often surprisingly good but quality proves case-by-case, of course.",1132531200,84,2893,5.287581699346405

Still the best, or at least my personal favorite, of the Unseen Cinema series. Deserves 5 stars for the content but the packaging leaves a lot to be desired- rather flimsy included pamphlets and plastic containers for each disc, and they make you send away with payment for the accompanying book! Which is worth the purchase for the read and context, but I was under the impression it was included.

8080966,1,B000AYEIJA,"If you like avant-garde, crazy-abstract go-nowhere, 15 minutes at a time of bubblegum for the eyes type films; and especially if you like to watch student films, with their poor focus, bad lighting, grungy color and extensive periods of stasis, then you will love these films.  OR if you like watching excerpts (I do not like excerpts) from great films.  This set includes some super-duper excerpts.

But if you are more of a Melies/Keaton kind of guy like I am, and you are looking for films that have some sense of beginning, middle, climax and end... or, frankly, films with ANY sense of dramatic sweep, then BUYER BEWARE: This is NOT Disney!  (The McLaren films come the closest to Disney-like charm and whimsy.)

There are a few real gems in this anthology.  Or put another way, there are real few gems in this collection.  My favorites were ""Dream of a Rarebit Fiend"", ""The Thieving Hand"", ""Moods of the Sea"", and ""Spook Sport"", and the music to ""Ballet Mecanique"".

The whole set is terrific--I confess that even though I teach experimental performance, I didn't realize the extent of American innovation in early avant-garde film until watching this collection.  The discs are arranged by concept (rather than chronology), which is a very engaging way to group them, and you make connections between the shorts, even watching in the most desultory fashion.

The most exciting contribution of this work is the version of ""Ballet Mchanique.""  They have paired the film with the original score by George Antheil for the first time, and the effect is astonishing.  I leapt off my feet in excitement on hearing the opening jangles and bangs of Antheil's score, which is orchestrated for percussion, player pianos, bells, and sirens.  The effect of watching this well-known film with the intended score for the first time is a revelation.",1294358400,4,962,4.975
