5904393,1,B00EDJM570,Not worth your time. The storyline is loose and both Imaran Hashmi and Vidya Balan did not manage to bring life to their characters.,1403136000,,132,4.541666666666667
5904394,5,B00EDJM570,Its a good movie. Truth is stranger than fiction. There were few areas where they could have made it better but it's a bollywood movie guys.,1402444800,,140,4.423076923076923
5904395,3,B00EDJM570,"Ghanchakkar is about a Sanjay ( Imraan Hashmi), a conman who has sort of semi retired. He is happy idling his time at home watching tv and chilling until two crooks Pandit and Idris  entice him with a con that would permanently solve all their problems. Hesitant at first, he gradually relents due to pressure from his wife and executes that heist. However trouble erupts when he forgets where he has stashed the bounty after robbing the bank. The entire second half is thus relegated to finding this stash.
I feel this movie could have been so much better other than Emraan Hashmi everyone seems to be sleepwalking. This guy Idris (Namit Das) clearly starts getting on your nerves after a while. Vidya Balan ( Neetu) plays a over the top loud mouthed character and she is very very annoying, which is surprising because she did a similar role in Dirty Picture with so much style. Raj Kumar Gupta is such a good director but somehow loses his style here, even when there are  crucial moments towards the end there is no aha from the audience. Plain and average for me. Three stars.",1390348800,,1081,4.595854922279793
