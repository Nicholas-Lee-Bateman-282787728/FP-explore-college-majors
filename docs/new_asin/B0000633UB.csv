7958303,4,B0000633UB,"Better than The Karate Kid in four ways:
1. It's less comic-booky, with more realistic characters.
2. Rod Steiger was terrific...much better than Pat Morita.
3. The title character is less of a dweeb.
4. The title character doesn't have a bimbo.
The only downside is the Kid's *sshole father, but this is a pretty darn good movie.",1461369600,,330,4.706896551724138

I am inspired to pen this review because i got angry from  after reading  a 1 star review  on this flick.

This DVD stars ROD STEIGER a towering character actor who did a little flick called  ON THE WATERFRONT but who eventually fell on hard times and often was disparaged by critics..  After thundering acclaim using method acting in the 50's & 60's  RS fell from  lofty heights like a tragic figure.  Plum roles no longer were offered to him.  Directors  ONLY wanted  RS to play a TYPE CAST  psycho heavy.  RS went overseas  seeking opportunity to  play diverse roles from NAPOLEON to MUSSOLINI.  He grabbed plenty of B roles  which  IMHO this flick falls squarely in that camp.  He finished with  140 credits to his name.  Along the way  he suffered health problems, depression, and 4 divorces.  The guy is criticized for over acting.  Granted, when he stepped to the plate he homered but he whiffed a lot...just like THE BAMBINO.  BUT, here is a chance to watch RS raw in a ROCKYESQUE little flick out of Canada.

This is an enjoyable little flick for what it is.  A good boy with a pure heart trains hard and triumphs over adversity, bullies,  self doubt ; and over familial criticism that boxing is atavistic and not politically correct enough in an age where peeps prefer sanitized killing with drones.

SPOILER ALERT-- The Hamlet like ghost of Harry "" the younger "" and Harry "" the elder "" is what wrenched the 5th str out of my heart.

So let ROD STEIGER act away.  Let him really ham it up ( and yes RS turns on the water works like a little girl ) in this little Disney flick about a trainer and a pure hearted boy who develop a love for each other and who love the pure sport of amateur boxing.

Glad I watched and I only cried a little.",1446854400,,1787,4.331306990881459

7958308,4,B0000633UB,"This movie is a hybrid of Karate Kid and Rocky.  It is fun, has a lot of heart and absolutely nothing offensive.  Anyone who liked the Karate Kid would like this one even better; it is a much better movie.

It is a great story, well told and will offend no one with inappropriate content.

We came acrossed it by accident, and I'm glad we did.",1120262400,5,343,4.151515151515151
7958309,1,B0000633UB,"From the opening credits with its unispired music that goes on and on, and  the opening dialog, this is a real stinker.  Dark moments make it appropriate only for older persons, but older persons will find they can't sit through the stunningly poor script.  I only bought this because is was very inexpensive, and I thought I was getting Disneys the kid.",1061510400,,354,4.67741935483871
