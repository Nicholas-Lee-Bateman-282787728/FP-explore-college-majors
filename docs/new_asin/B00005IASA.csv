7938432,4,B00005IASA,"Classic Aussie movie, the movie ""Australia"" ( Kidman, Jackman ) was based on this. If you want to get an idea as to what Australia was like in the 1940's, then watch this movie.",1475539200,,177,4.235294117647059

7938435,4,B00005IASA,"I bought this DVD because of a review of Chips Rafferty.  I played this using my computer because it is available only in PAL format.  It works.  This is a well done trail drive, Australian style, to save cattle from a perceived invasion by the Japanese during WWII.  The river crossing is complicated by crocs.  This is a good movie that is well worth the time.",1424304000,,362,4.424242424242424
7938436,5,B00005IASA,"Assuming a 1942 Japanese invasion of northern Australia to be imminent, one family drives a large herd of cattle through 1500 miles of harsh country to safer pastures on the east coast, rather than comply with a government ""scorched earth"" policy to annihilate the herd.  Other cattle owners followed their example, and thousands of head were eventually removed safely - a true story of epic proportions.  Considering the rather primitive resources available to film makers in 1945 (with the war still not quite over when filming began), it is remarkable what a fine result was achieved by Harry Watt and a small team of fine actors in documenting this gritty story for posterity - complete with stampedes, crocodiles, mountains, drought conditions and human frailties.  I remember hearing about this exemplary film as a boy, and was delighted to find it available on Amazon some 65 years later.  Good on yer, Harry.",1370736000,2,916,5.046357615894039
7938437,4,B00005IASA,"It is very interesting to see an example of early Australian cinema. I appreciated the shots of the outback and the distances these pioneers had to cover on horseback. Although the threat of a Japanese invasion was the motivation of the drive, I don't regard this as a propaganda film at all. Chips Rafferty was the iconic outback aussie.",1369440000,3,338,4.745762711864407
7938438,4,B00005IASA,"I'm probably prejudiced a. for being Australian, and b. for having seen this movie soon after it came out.  Chips Rafferty was always one of my heroes!  To modern eyes, the movie is probably stilted and old fashioned, but the story behind it is true and the photography and scenery is great.  It's an early Australian classic. Ignore the appalling cover!",1300233600,5,354,4.770491803278689
7938439,4,B00005IASA,"Without looking it up, most shoppers will have no notion what this obscure movie is and how good it is. It's an unusual adventure drama about the Australian home front in World War II and is based on fact. The Japanese are on the rampage in the south Pacific. Northern Australia, home to vast cattle ranges, seems doomed to fall. The government decides to destroy all the cattle rather than let the enemy get them, but one rancher (Chips Rafferty) thinks he can drive thousands of head a thousand miles across the desert outback to safety. As the ship evacuating the other settlers pulls out, they call back to him, ""You'll be sorry!"" But no challenge is too daunting, and the rest of the movie entails the suspense and agonizing hardships of the epic journey. Keeping a band of humans alive in the wilderness would be no small feat, but add a thousand steers and the obstacles are spectacular--poison weeds, bad water, wild horses, stampedes, steep mountain passes, the lure of cold beer at the only saloon for a thousand miles. Add in a pretty daughter and a handsome sailor, a crew of raffish cowhands, a medevac DC-3, John Ireland's dramatic score, and a brisk pace and tight direction, and those who enjoy a non-military wartime epic in black and white will have plenty of fun with this one.",1088294400,10,1296,4.663755458515284
