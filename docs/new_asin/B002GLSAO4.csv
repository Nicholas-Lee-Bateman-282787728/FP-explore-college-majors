8369817,5,B002GLSAO4,"I have always found the ""Ram Inn"" to be especially haunting with the history, furnishings and apmosphere that it provides as well as the character of the long time owner John. Although the production quality of this video was far from professional, it still provided an in depth tour of the inn and quick a bit of conversation with John. I really enjoyed it!",1468368000,,358,4.609375

8369819,2,B002GLSAO4,"The sound quality is awful.  It is produced in a laisssez faire way which doesnt do justice to the haunting story.  The owner speaks alot and appears to have age onset memory issues.  Again, a more sophisticated production would have been so much more enjoyable- something scripted regarding the history and haunting incidences and then may be a third of the time on the various knocks and bumps you hear throughout the production.",1315440000,,431,4.876712328767123

8369821,3,B002GLSAO4,"This video is mostly taken up with interviewing the owner of the Ram. It doesn't show an investigation, as such but will be of interest to those who have heard of the Ancient Ram Inn or seen it investigated by other paranormal groups.",1254614400,2,234,4.465116279069767
8369822,5,B002GLSAO4,"What a fascinating trip into the distant past, as renowned Psychic Medium Patrick McNamara interviews the owner of England's oldest Inn established in 1145 AD, and saved from demolishment back in 1968.  John Humphries is a delightful old codger, who's devoted the latter part of his life to the preservation of this world renowned historic site.  The remarkable Mr. McNamara detects the presence of a host of spirits, from a young girl who died giving birth, to a kindhearted woman murdered by highwayman for ""knowing too much."" I loved the fact that even John's mother came through, prompting Patrick to ask, ""Did somebody assault you?"" With John responding that only 3 months prior, some acquaintances had put him in the hospital having hurt him during a robbery.  The Inn was the hideout of the same ilk; England's last two highwaymen. Not to mention a hotbed of activity due to witchcraft whose covens continue today in the surrounding area. Living there, John has had countless experiences from an incubus who has long haunted the Inn and even held him down the morning of the interview, to furniture being placed haphazardly on a stairwell with great commotion. As he leads Patrick on a highly informative tour, Patrick reveals the presence of past and visiting spirits, both benign, and angry. I thoroughly enjoyed my trip to the hamlet of Wotton Under Edge, and the opportunity to see a genuine Medium at work outside his circle. A circle detailed at [...] where I first discovered his great talent !",1250294400,2,1508,4.905882352941177
