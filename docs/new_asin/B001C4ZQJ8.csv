This anime is definitely well detailed. I was amazed at the animational quality of the series from beginning to end, which is where most other anime shows tend to fail. The sound was rather vivid and there was plenty of character development with some of the more major characters.

The bad
Simply put, this anime was killed off extremely premature. If you've heard of Gantz before, it's most probably due to the manga. If you've already read the manga, prepare to feel disappointed and shafted. This anime covers a total of 4 missions. The first 3 missions were 95% true to the manga. The last mission, however, was not in the manga and is something that I feel was put in the end probably because the developers got tired of working on this anime. This is highly apparent because of the fact that the last mission goes on for about 5 running episodes, and little next to nothing ever happens with no ties on the storyline or the characters. Because of this, and because the anime only covers 3 out of the 11 missions that were present in the manga, you're going to feel left out. There were so many questions popping up in my head that should have been answered, but because the storyline was literally cut short, I'm finding myself digging through the mangas and counting the last 5 episodes of the anime to not be cannon.

Other thoughts
I have never, ever, seen an anime so geared towards adults. There's more than enough profanity, nudity, excessive gore, and sexual situations to leave an impression. This may, or may not be a bad thing. But what struck me as annoying, almost as annoying as the lack of storyline and premature end, is the constant whining, crying, and otherwise moronic moments throughout the beginning of the series.

In short, if you're looking for an anime to tide you over for a few days, or have read the manga and would like to see the first three missions in animated format, you might enjoy this collection. Otherwise, stick with the manga.",1239408000,4,1982,4.609065155807365

and another thing, apparently every woman in Japan (where the >snicker< story >snicker< takes place) has big ol' floppin' triple F cups that require a wheel barrow to move.

I wasted hours of my life on this [...]. do not make the same mistake. save yourself!!!!!!!!!!!!!

but if your are still interested, the story is about a device/person (what it really is never made known) called Gantz that transports people into a room right before they die and then forces them to kill aliens.",1238544000,6,759,4.656716417910448
8285953,4,B001C4ZQJ8,"I enjoyed this series. Starts out well enough then bogs down with character development for a couple of episodes. Then it takes back off and keeps going till the end. This has the foulest language of any series that I have seen. Language does not bother me but just keep that in mind when you buy it.
  There is a little nudity yet it never reaches hentia...but it comes as close as possible.
  Just to clue you in on what I like...Elfen Lied...Trinity Blood...etc.
 The animation remains consistent all the way through (I've seen a lot worse)...with the some 3-d rendered backgrounds.
 It has good replay value but it would have been a better but at 50 bucks. I paid 70 myself yet would pay it again to replace it.
  I am not one to tell you the story, from start to finish, that it contains.
  It centers on a mysterious black ball that teleports the charcters' and others to a room at the moment of their death. If they can survive what follows they may return to their normal lives....until needed again and will continue to do so until they meet its requirement.",1222214400,3,1067,4.453608247422681
