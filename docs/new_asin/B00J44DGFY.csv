6332607,1,B00J44DGFY,"The only good thing this movie can do is.
1st  Run over with a steam roller.
2nd  Toss into a grinder
3rd  Mix with concert and use to pave a road way.
That way it would be a benfit.

I've seen some turkey zombie movies in the pass that I have like.  This is not one of them.  It should never been made.  The editing, acting, just everything.  Seeing some zombies being taken out and in the next scene they are back again.  This director wants to be another George Romero Its not going to happen.  In the credits all the zombies are listed.  You have entire families in the credits and not just one but dozens.  Once again DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!!",1398816000,,642,4.130081300813008
6332608,1,B00J44DGFY,....movies like this one. I had reasonable expectations that were dashed by a lackluster script and wooden performances. Proceed forewarned!,1398643200,,140,6.05
6332609,5,B00J44DGFY,"I had the opportunity to catch this fun Zombie flick on the big screen yesterday at the Capitol Theater in Cleveland with a rowdy audience and it was a great time. This tongue in cheek romp casts some Legends and well known wrestlers, as well as some on their way up the ranks. It has a great mix of Zombie Gore and Wrestling action to get the job done.

 If you are a fan of Wrestling and enjoy Zombie action this is for you. With the likes of Rowdy Roddy Piper, Hacksaw Jim Duggan, The Franchise Shane Douglas, Kurt Angle, Matt Hardy and newcomers like Facade you are sure to get a kick out of it.

Enter the squared circle and let the Zombie carnage begin!!!",1396310400,4,661,4.23015873015873
6332610,5,B00J44DGFY,"When I first heard of this movie I instantly knew that it would be entertaining being that I am a fan of both old school horror movies and pro wrestling. However just because a movie title boldly states the obvious sometimes the film behind it lacks the punch of its title. This is not the case with Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies as director Cody Knotts knows exactly what fans of a movie of such a ridiculous premise would want. This movie plays out like a 90 minute ECW hardcore match but with zombies taking the bumps. The pace of the film is extremely fast and the dialogue and one liners are pure gold. However, if you are unfamiliar with the world of pro wrestling the references will probably just go right over your head, but then again if you don't like or have never liked wrestling you probably should avoid this film. For those of us in the demographic that this film is aiming for well..this movie is perfection at its finest. ""Rowdy""Roddy Piper and ""The Franchise"" Shane Douglas both give great performances staying true to their wrestling alter egos and once again giving their fans exactly what they want to see including their signature moves and catchphrases. Notable performances also come from Matt Hardy, Hacksaw Jim Duggan, and of course Olympic gold medallist Kurt Angle. The film is packed with ridiculous fight/death scenes and the overall look of the movie gives off a very classic grindhouse vibe which adds to its throwback charm. I absolutely loved every minute of ""Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies"" and would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of pro wrestling, horror, and classic 80's B-movies.",1395792000,3,1621,4.731448763250883

8647856,5,B00J44DGFY,"If you are buying a movie called ""Pro Wrestlers vs. Zombies"" then you know EXACTLY what you are getting.

This is NOT Dawn of the Dead quality zombie horror. This is NOT The Wrestler with its dramatic and moving story. This is a hokey B-Movie ride starring some wrestling legends playing themselves while being attacked by zombies.

Just like the title says.",1438300800,2,358,4.758064516129032
8647857,4,B00J44DGFY,Watch with the commentary on to see how much fun they had making this.,1427587200,2,70,4.071428571428571

8647859,4,B00J44DGFY,"Now this is the kind of film I enjoy the most in many ways. When I ordered it I had no expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the final product. With this film the title sums it up perfectly. A group of professional wrestlers are tricked into a private wrestling event but are ambushed by zombies. The film stars Adrienne Fischer as Sarah (one of the reps for the company providing the wrestlers), Roddy Piper, Shane Douglas, Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Matt Hardy, ad Kurt Angle. Shane Douglas kills a wrestler at a previous event and his brother has decided to use the forces of evil to raise an army of zombies to get his revenge. The film was shot in a prison where the event is going to take place. There are some really slick scenes with the wrestlers using their signature moves on the zombie hoard and then using them on other wrestlers when they are turned. Not the greatest acting from many of the wrestlers (not surprising as for most this was their first time acting) but Shane Douglas, Roddy Piper, and Adrienne Fischer did an exemplary job carrying most of the heavy acting. Being a fan of both genres this was a no-brainer for me. I will share my favorite line which was from Kurt Angle (a native from Pittsburgh) ""People from Pittsburgh know how to kill zombies"". The music was good and I'm glad the film came with the soundtrack on CD.",1425686400,4,1350,4.491869918699187
8647860,3,B00J44DGFY,"If you are a fan of pro wrestling, you might like this film. The intent of this film appears to be to place pro wresters into a storyline where they must use wrestling and fighting moves against opponents who are zombies. The fight is not one-sided as wrestlers do die. There is a lot of blood and gore that verges more on the silly. There is very little suspense as this is mostly excuses to present lots of fighting action.

There is a semblance of a plot regarding revenge from a wrestling match death. The characters are not well defined. There are few character arcs as there barely any characters. There is little dialogue and what dialogue that exists is simplistic and surprisingly often repetitious and unnecessary. The movie appears to serve a basis to show wrestling stunts, biting zombies, and bleeding victims.

Among the positive aspects are that Roddy Pipper can act. He develops a character that can draw audience support. Carmera Bartolotta shows promise that might serve well in a political setting. This is a film that may be enjoyed by pro-wrestling fans or fans of extremely bloody, although obviously fake, violence.",1416009600,2,1138,4.860824742268041
8647861,1,B00J44DGFY,"low budget, poor acting and not even good enough for a laugh. I actually feel bad for Rawdy Roddy for being apart of this lol",1411084800,,125,4.04
8647862,4,B00J44DGFY,"Fun movie with exactly what the titles suggests Wrestlers fighting Zombies. Plenty of action,gore,comedy. If your expecting an oscar caliber film then what the heck are you doing watching a film called Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies? If you want 90 min of entertainment you got the right movie!",1404777600,,288,5.020833333333333
8647863,5,B00J44DGFY,They took Zombie films to a whole new level with this one.  Watch famous pro wrestlers take on hordes of flesh eating zombies.  This movie lives up to it's name!!  I recommend you order it,1403654400,2,188,4.314285714285714
8647864,1,B00J44DGFY,"While I never expected cinematic genius, considering the premise I expected a fun romp in comedic horror. The movie was a failure from the beginning: poor make-up and horror effects, hopelessly amateurish dialogue and editing.....Where does it end???
The one redeeming aspect of the DVD package was the accompanying CD soundtrack album. The music, at least, is listenable.",1402444800,,372,5.431034482758621
