2155720,5,B00031TX7C,"Well, I finally broke down and bought the second season.  I can easily say that I was not disappointed.  There is not much that can be said about the series that hasn't already been said.  The second season picks up where the first season left off.  Yet, now the tone of this season is more dark and also more revealing.  I found this to be an interesting turn for the series.  There are issues of identity that the main character Roger Smith has to deal with, that didn't exist in the first season.  The issue of being a tomato, hey I know sounds funny but watch the show, that several characters ending up having to face.

I know a lot of this sounds real general, but I don't want to give the plot away.  Essentially, the second pulls to a close some of the major issues that the end of the first season began to present.  This while at the same time opening up new ones that never clearly are answered.  There are a few episodes that could have been done better or left out, more specifically the one where beck builds a Voltron style robot only to have it quickly destoryed with no major robot action.  Yet, overall this series really is a masterpeice in story telling, better than many of the movies I have seen now a days.

So if you like mystery and big robots fighting in downtown areas, then call the insurance agent and tell him your building has been smashed by a 40-50 story robot because its showtime again.",1123545600,4,1421,4.337121212121212
2155721,5,B00031TX7C,"I own ""The Big O collection"" and so when I saw the advertisment for ""The Big O II"" I believed that it was a sequal to the first Big O collection.  It is NOT~ It is the same stuff in a new packaging.  I am now having to beg the Market Place seller to accept it back for a refund (minus the shipping charge).  It is a wonderful series, but I certainly didn't want to own two of the same thing :)",1122249600,5,393,3.768292682926829
2155722,5,B00031TX7C,"Though I do admit to not haveing all of the answers to 'Big O'.  What I have come to realize is what is said through out the series, 1 and 2.  That there was no past, no memories forgotten.  How could people lose memories when they never had them to begin with.  This entire world revolves around 'Angel'.  Her love for Roger, and her quest to find out what the Man was like.  What happened in that timetable.  Though if angel was an angel, then she was dead.  Just her spirit wanting to ask what happened to humanity?  As said in the series she was a Memory.  Just her.  So therefore is it possible that her world, the one she created was just a memory of her memory?

  The last episode reminded me of the holo-decks on Star-Trek!  Where people would create worlds for them to play and relax in. They could create other people who didn't know that they were just a memory, just a hologram. Same thing with Big O.

  One question that still haunts me.  Why at the very end does the story start over again?  Then I think and imagine what it would be like to be a character on a DVD.  The DVD we watch, we play it over and over again.  Angel may have been replaying those events one after another to try to find a different ending to the series. Or to find any lost bits of memories prior to that series.  That would explain why Roger kept haveing flashbacks.

Who was the Operator?  Mentioned in the last episode. Was is Angel?  But if Angel wasn't the 'Operator' then who was?  That is the biggest question of all.",1105747200,4,1515,4.224561403508772
2155723,5,B00031TX7C,"Big O is an important anime for many reasons; the most important reason, however, is this: Big-O is the first anime that an American audience spurred to completion.  Over in Japan, the first 13 episodes of Big-O didn't make much of a splash.  It aired on a very minor network and was passed over.  Even with its cliffhanger ending, studios elected to leave it unfinished.  The show then aired on Cartoon Network.  The positive reaction to the show along with letters clamoring for a completion of the show were so overwhelming that Cartoon Network got together with the Japanese studios responsible for the show to put together the second half of the the show.  Thus, this is the first time an overseas audience has caused the completion of an anime.

It would suck, then, if the second season was less fulfilling than the first.  To the contrary, the second season brings the show into full bloom.  What made the first season so great has been amplified.  The first season consisted mostly of slightly interconnected stories all revolving around the mysteries of Paradigm city.  The atmosphere of the show was great, but it was difficult to tell if the show was leading to anything.  This time, the show rarely lets up on solid storytelling.  Every moment (save one episode) feels like an important piece of the impossible puzzle that the show creates.

As far as the actual asthetics of the show, they are fantastic.  The animation has definitely improved a good deal, and Big-O himself has never looked better.  While the score for the first season was fantastic, this season's tops it.  Finally, while I usually hate english voice-acting for anime, Big-O is one case where I actually prefer it- it is very well executed here.

See the first season, then hold on tight for the second!",1104969600,59,1787,4.784313725490196
2155724,5,B00031TX7C,"Initially the Big-O seems to be yet another (albeit stylized) big-robot anime. It quickly shows itself to be a more complex, and thoroughly pleasing story, with stand-alone episodes gradually exposing a greater mystery. The first series of Big-O ended in a pending confrontation, after having only confirmed the existence of a bigger mystery. So if you've seen the first series, you're already anxious to catch this sequel, which leads up to an excellent and satisfying conclusion. The individual episodes are even more imaginative, with many of the questions raised by the original series being answered along the way (a longer way at that).

If you haven't seen the first episodes, I'd strongly recommend watching them first, though by all means this second series is ""better."" If you're unfamiliar with the series, it offers a good story, with elements that will remind you of: The Matrix, Gundam, Dark City, Batman, Resident Evil, Blade Runner, etc.

Or in other words (MINOR SPOILERS): big robots, a retro-styled future, questionable reality, lost technology, secret identities, good androids, scary androids, butlers, domed cities, wastelands, forbidden underground cities, manipulated and lost memories, comical villains who accidentally do good, truly evil villains, corrupt police, honest police, an evil corporation, a terrorist threat, and more.",1101513600,12,1356,5.545893719806763
2155725,5,B00031TX7C,"I know, I know...how can someone review the DVDs when they haven't been released yet?  Thankfully, I saw most of Season II on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.

Season II is where The Big O really makes its mark, moving it from a stylistically pleasing but ultimately vapid show to a show with a great deal of meaning.  Rest assured, this is not a cartoon series aimed at children.

As I'm sure most of you know, The Big O takes place in a post apocalyptic, film noir future.  The setting is Paradigm City, the last bastion of civilization on earth, and a place where all of the people have amnesia because of an unknown 'incident' 40 years prior.  Roger Smith, the series' protagonist, is a Negotiator -- a person the local police force contacts when, err, negotiations reach an empasse.  He is also Paradigm City's protector, as he pilots the megadeus (huge robot) Big O in order to ward off any who might want to destroy the city.  It all sounds more or less cliche, doesn't it?  Thankfully Season II manages to elevate The Big O above other mecha driven anime series.

The heart of the story lies in the inherent mystery of Paradigm City and the role its inhabitants take as people without a past.  The notion of memory and its use in the formation of self actualization is the main point behind the series.  Are we defined by the past?  Or is the past really only useful in providing a context for our present and future true selves?  Would we choose to scrap our past memories in order to create a new beginning for ourselves?

Those looking for hard answers to the questions regarding the 'incident' which gave Paradigm City its amnesia, and the myriad of other mysteries presented in the story, may be disappointed because what few answers Season II provides lead to more questions.  This series, however, isn't about that, nor is it about giant robots fighting against each other. And for that, I am thankful.",1100563200,10,1914,4.601769911504425

8035835,5,B00031TX7C,"Intro - Right. Well I wrote the ""rant"" review that was entitled under ""Keifer Yeoman"". I had to use my own account (I was using my brothers) to rectify this terrible mistake when I said 2 stars. Also, I realize I didn't say much in the way of actual video, audio, and story quality.

Video - The video quality can be called better than the first season. The first season has great quality, but they have really gone to town on the second. It is livlier, crisper, and brighter than before. It still reflects the repressed mood of Paradigm City however, especially the outer domes. As for the Megadueses and characters... well, they are outstanding as well. Big O has never looked better.

Audio - Big O suffers from the fact that it, like many anime, has a limited soundtrack. Don't let that stop you though. Some of the greatest anime of all time have this problem, and as any fan knows it doesn't ruin them in the least. Big O is one of that quality. The soundtrack is addictive and catchy, and portrays the spirit brilliantly. You don't need very many with these tunes.

Subtitles - I actually never bothered with these, which boggles me no end. Big O is actually the first anime I ever watched that makes me want to listen to the dub rather than the sub! I don't believe it. Nonetheless, it is here. For one brief, shining moment in history, the dubbing excels! Everyone I talk too tells me that the subtitles are on the mark though, which isn't surprising since it is of high quality.

Story - If there is one place where Big O blows everything away, it is the variety of the story. A psychological-action-adventure-mystery-angst-romance thriller, mix in the millionaire Negotiator who is running around in a giant Megaduese (mecha) and his sardonic Android partner (go Dorothy!) and the ever reliable Norman (the Butler who is loyal DIDN'T do it, deviating from the traditional theme).

For the sake of completion, I will give a small overview on the story itself. Roger Smith is a Negotiator who lives in Paradigm City, the last surviving city on earth after a apocalyptic force known as ""the Event"" sealed the memories of both humans, androids, and everything else. Forty years have pased since ""the Event"", and mankind has began a search for memories that help them advance in their small civilization. Roger has a secret though. He is the pilot of ancient technology from times before ""the Event"". The megadues, Big O! Joined by his partner Dorothy, his loyal butler Norman, and his megadues, (plus a whole bunch of other people) he is on a mad dash to bring order to Paradigm.

Overview - Big O is one for the collection folks. It still has a fanbase after five years and the works. I don't need to waste my time telling you that it as an American audience that spurred Big O into the second season, which it a historic mark in both the anime world. If you like mecha, psychological and grandthemes, AMAZING characters, great dubbing, and a storyline that is both tribute and original, then this it!",1140912000,14,3009,4.6254681647940075
8035836,2,B00031TX7C,"Wow. Unlike most people I wasn't that worried about CN taking  a hand of the second Big 0 series. The fact that they were likely doing it for money didn't worry me in the least. I knew they would do their best to deliver a quality work and continue on with the spirit of Big O. If you liked the first season but are denying yourself the second, you are making a big mistake. Don't let Kid's review scare you away either. That is neither proven nor acknowledged as a theory for the series. It is just one possible interpatation. To set those of you that have fears at rest, I will deliver a counter-example. For everything the Kid said there is a counter example that makes the events of Paragdrim real and the ones in the first episode as false. These are spoilers for the first episode, but please read it! Especially if you read Kid's review... it is a counter to that.

SPOILERS:

1. When Roger speaks into his watch to call Big O there is nothing on his wrist but a leather band and a broken watch. (A Kid)

Counter: Yes. That is because as we speak Roger is losing faith in himself and thus Big 0 won't allow him to be his pilot. The missing watch isn't insanity. It is Freudian psychology. As a side note, the reason the fake world Roger invented looked like our world is for a variety of reasons. One of them is so that the audience can associate with it more. Another reason is so that we think Roger is insane. Roger thinks he is insane, and the makers want us to think he is too. Later, Roger realizes he isn't insane. He was just afraid! He admits that fear and then gains back his confidence. The audience then moves on and enjoys the real world of the anime. ""A Kid"" decided to not do that and instead set about ignoring the sequence of events, and also making giant assumptions out of absolutely nothing. For example KID: Where does the insane asylum mentioned in 5. come from? There is no reference to it either abstractly or directly in the anime! You made up the asylum, and even admitted it yourself. The asylum forms a large part of your reasoning and without it the flaws in your theory are already becoming clear. I just hope that makes watching Big 0 for the second or third time more enjoyable for you A Kid (:

2. The REAL Beck, the Bank manager, who Roger fantasizes as a criminal, points out that ""this man is obviously dilusional."" (A Kid)

Counter: Beck appears in the Big 0 manga. Everyone keep that in mind for the rest of what I say. Now, in the anime Roger is reading the manga. In the first episode of the second season, Roger runs into Beck. He knows who Beck is. Got that so far? Good. Later, after meeting Beck, he reads the manga that Beck is a villian in. Now how is it that a ""real"" bank manager appears in the manga that supposedly inspires Roger Smith with the idea of making up a pretend world? Did the bank manager give the manga makers permission to use his character for whatever reason for a vilian inside the manga? I know that is hard to understand, but read it through two or three times and it should become clear. It is already proof that A Kid was wrong in his sequence of events, as in, what happened first and what happened next.

3. Roger reads from the Big O Manga and gets the idea for his fantasy about being a negotiator and piloting Big O. (A Kid)

RIGHTTTTTTT *sarcasm*. Have you read the Big 0 manga A Kid? If Roger Smith as the Wanderer based a fake world off of the manga, then why is it that so many people in the Wanderer's World appear in the manga before he even reads it? Roger was reading about people he had met in the Wanderers World. For example, he met Beck in a bank, called him on being a criminal, and was called delusional for his trouble. He then LATER, after meeting the bank manager Beck, reads a manga that YOU (A Kid) use as evidence that says that Beck is a criminal, thus confirming what he already knew. Roger is disheartened by this because he sees it as proof that his world does not exist (which it does). A bit like this:

Wanderer Roger: Oh. It is a manga. I can use this to make my own fantasy world! (WRONG!)

Negotiator Roger: NO! It is a manga! That must mean that I really am insane! (RIGHT! BUT NOT REALLY, CAUSE HE IS RIGHT AND THE MANGA IS WRONG. It is just what Roger thinks).

Want another example? Roger calls out Dorothy's name as the human Dorothy walks into the Nightengale, but Dorothy appears in the manga that Roger reads afterwards. How can Roger be living in a real world with a manga inspired off people that exist in his world?

4. By the time Angel comes to pick him up in the car Roger has already returned to his fantasy world and nothing that occurs from that point on is real anymore for the rest of the series (I think). (A Kid)

You think wrong. You don't think on a psychodynamic level do you? Roger is being driven by conscious and unconscious forces, okay? Get that through your head, it is crucial. Roger is losing confidence in himself and unconscious forces within himself are helping him do just that. LOSING CONFIDENCE. At the same time, we, the audience, are supposed to lose confidence with him. The next step is admitting that we were wrong and that Roger is sane. You just decided not to do that. Again, you just jumped around filling in holes and making the ""crazy"" theory where there was none.

5. Roger sees himself driving the car while he is in the back seat, a halucination that has been known to have been played out by schitzos. (A Kid)

This is basically the first thing you said that has any bearing whatsoever. It isn't enough though. While what you said about schitzos is true, it isn't enough to condemn Roger as one. Rather, Roger was trying to make himself (and by extension, us) think that he was schitzo. A person losing faith in themselves does what their intuition tells them. Try to lose it faster! That was what Roger did. Eventually, he had to face the facts. Roger the Negotiator was real, Big 0 was real, and he needed to master his fear and move on and embrace the uncertain future.

A Kid - A Kid, your problem was that you put way too much stock inside one episode. After that you mixed around the sequence of events. You make it sound like Roger read the manga and then met everybody inside it. That isn't impossible. A Kid, you need to pay more attention to the other episodes! Especially the last one.

Roger talks about how Memory helps people find out who they are.

At the end, Roger starts remembering who he is by examing his past. At the end of the series, Roger claims he doesn't know exactly who he is. He starts Remembering everything from start to finish because he wants to get a bearing on that. That is the end of Big 0! He is using Memory to help find out who he is now compared to what he was then. His experiences (with Dorothy and Angel) have changed him a lot. Notice that the fact that he is insane doesn't even enter his head once. He got over it. You should too.

Roger the Wandederer is the fake. Roger the Negotiator is real. Roger has a lapse, that lapse made him think he was insane and he lost confidence. That was when he was Wandering. He later realized (thanks to memories of the real Android Dorothy, for whom he feels affection) that The Negotiator was real and the Wandederer was just the guy who was afraid.

A Kid. The chances of you reading this a year later are tough. Still, I got to press you. You seem smart. Watch the series again and look out for the things I said. Namely the first episode. As for everyone else. Take what I have said to heart or at least to thought.

A Kid's Theory about Roger being crazy: It has no ground. A Kid messed up the order of events in the first episode, ignored the rest of the series, and then made a whole bunch of assumptions that have no factual proof whatsoever. There is no asylum, there is no Wanderer. That was Roger losing faith. He regained the faith in himself and remembered he was the Negotiator. Read everything I said again if you are still confused. It is important that you understand.

A Kid makes you think the first episode is the only real episode. That is wrong. It is the fake episode, and that episode that is a review! Come on everyone! Think! The first episode of the second season is just a review on everything that happened in the first season of the anime! You have little retake episodes like that in every anime series you watch! Think! THe Big O crew wasn't satisifed with just making a recap epsisode though. They made it like it was so that they could mess with our heads. A Kid took a small ball, ran with it, and tried to make it into something it is not. He ignored the order and made very large assumptions where there are none. If you research a round a little, you'll find out that what I said is true.

Conclusion: Roger the Wandererer is the Roger Smith who is fake. He is the lost faith Roger. Roger the Negoitator is the Roger who regains faith.
