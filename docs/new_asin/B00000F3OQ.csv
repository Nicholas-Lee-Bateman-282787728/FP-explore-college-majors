7907296,5,B00000F3OQ,"This is a great film based on a great novel.  Films cannot include all that is in a novel.  They are a very different genre and tell the story differently.  However, I try to enjoy the film for itself and enjoy the novel for itself separately.  Sonia Braga as a mulata? No, but she is very Brasilian.  Marcello Mastroianni as Nacib, the Syrian? Well, even if the film changes him to a child of an Italian mother and Turkish father to explain his Italian accent, he is still a great actor.  I love the novel, and I love the film.  I feel very lucky to have found this video after so many years.  Now, if only I could find a reasonably priced copy of Dona Flor e Seus Dois Maridos!",1325980800,,679,4.1692307692307695
7907297,5,B00000F3OQ,"Brings back a lot of steamy fantasies from my teenage years.  Someone sold us his entire VHS collection in 1987 (the G-rated and PG-13 movies) and this was one of those movies he forgot to take out and I hid it before my parents found it.  It made for really fun, giggly times as my brother and I would get up in the middle of the night to watch this while my parents were asleep and it inspired a lot of cool fantasies.  My parents eventually did see it but over a year later because we decided they were ready for it and it became a permanent addition to our family movie  collection.  We are now in our thirties and still have vivid memories of it.  I would not classify it as a porn movie, it is simply a very erotic movie with a simple but touching storyline and the sex scenes are explicit but not vulgur at all.  I highly recommend it for couples!!  Great book too!!",1289347200,,873,4.154761904761905
7907298,4,B00000F3OQ,"We purchased this movie because my wife had read and liked the novel years ago and because we recently learned that the soundtrack and score was written by Antonio Carlos Jobim.

The movie is O.K. - and the score is outstanding!",1244246400,,228,4.560975609756097
7907299,5,B00000F3OQ,"I agree with the previous 2 reviewers. I love this film,Sonia and Marcello have a great chemistry in this film. Sonia Braga covered in mud is still so sexy. This film makes me want to go to a place like that and find a woman like that. Heart be still.",1227398400,5,251,4.04
7907300,5,B00000F3OQ,"Anyone who has ever seen this movie knows why it needs to be released on dvd. Sonia Braga is so voluptuous and luscious that this movie sizzles from beginning to end. Mastroianni is good, too. COME ON-AMAZON, GET THIS ONE......",1201392000,8,227,4.7
7907301,5,B00000F3OQ,"If you're a Sonja Braga fan as am I, you must see this movie!  Sonja Braga was extremely sensual and erotically enticing as the titled character. Even covered in dirt/mud as first seen in this film you can't help but to be drawn to/seduced by her raw, earthy, sultry sexiness!  This film should be redone on DVD. I'd pay a premium for and I'm sure I'm not alone. I don't even own a VCR any more. Amazon.com, get this film on DVD!!!!!",1179187200,12,433,4.2682926829268295
