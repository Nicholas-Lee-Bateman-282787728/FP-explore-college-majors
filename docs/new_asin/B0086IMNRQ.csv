5135131,3,B0086IMNRQ,I bought this for my husband as a gift.  He has started watching it.  So far he likes some of the movies but does not like otheres.,1362528000,,131,3.814814814814815
5135132,4,B0086IMNRQ,"This collection of films are a good addition to a collector library. These films are rarely seen, but are well none and interesting.",1362009600,3,132,4.782608695652174
5135133,3,B0086IMNRQ,"At first appearance the movies shown appear mediocre, but the first four discs which I have watched so far are quite acceptable",1360454400,3,127,4.818181818181818
5135134,5,B0086IMNRQ,"The 40s are an interesting era for movie fans. A lot happened in that little decade. We spent part of it coming out of the Depression, a big chunk of it in World War II and finally there were the After War years when the country was hungry to get back to life as usual. Of course the films of the time reflect this mixed bag of strong and sweeping national emotions or zeitgeist if you will. Comedies, dramas, thrillers you name it the 40s provided it to the movie going audience.

  Someone else was kind enough to list all the movies in this set so I'm just going to shine the spotlight on a few of the films I really enjoyed. Honestly though if you like old movies you can't go wrong with this set. One more thing, it's true that the picture and sound quality of some of these gems isn't the best but what I like to do is watch them here first, and if I seriously enjoy a film then I'll spend the extra money to buy a better print of it.

THE ADVENTURES OF TARTU: aka SABOTAGE AGENT, This film pits a chemical engineer (Captain Stevenson) who is fluent in Rumanian, German and Russian against Nazis. Stevenson becomes an Iron Guard named Tartu and attempts to upset a Nazi plot by destroying a poison gas factory. He needs help from the local resistance to succeed. But how, posing as a Nazi, can he get the underground to trust him? This one is pretty well written and thought out.

DICK TRACY'S DILEMMA: Dick Tracy takes on a huge thug named The Claw, and he's not called that because he's got a craving for lobsters. There's also an insurance scam involving stolen furs that is somehow linked to The Claw but make no mistake, this movie belongs to the big boy himself. Ralph Byrd is the definitive Dick Tracy and many of his supporting cast such as Tess Truehart, Vitamin Flintheart and good ol' Sam help to liven things up.

PASSPORT TO PIMLICO: Due to a wartime explosion a small section of London, Pimlico, discovers an ancient treaty that shows they were ceded to the Duchy of Burgundy years ago. Declaring themselves a sovereign nation inside London proper leads to some pretty funny escapades.

DISHONORED LADY: Madeleine Damien is a high powered magazine editor by day and a hard partying firecracker at night. She burns the candle at both ends for too long though and on the verge of a nervous breakdown she drops her job and moves to a new apartment where she takes up the life of a painter. She meets a fella and everything seems to be turning up rosy. But roses have thorns don't they?

BOYS OF THE CITY: It's the East Side Kids! In a haunted house! There's no Huntz Hall yet and some of the humor directed at Sunshine Sammy is not very cool, but overall it's a funny little flick.

PENNY SERENADE: This is a classic tear jerker. Cary Grant and Irene Dunn adopt a baby and enlist Edgar Buchanan to help raise the cute, little squirt and add some humor. I won't give away what happens next, but remember I called it a tear-jerker for a very good reason.

HIS GIRL FRIDAY: This is one of the all time classic comedies pitting Cary Grant as a conniving newspaper editor against Rosalind Russell as his best reporter and ex-wife.

POT O' GOLD: Jimmy Stewart plays a music shop owner who has to close up because of poor business. He goes to the city to work for his cranky, Scrooge-like uncle but ends up with a band of merry making Irish gypsies. It's sweet understated humor and deserves a bigger audience.

THE BLACK BOOK aka THE REIGN OF TERROR: According to the movies lots of guys have little black books that contain the phone numbers of women they want to date. Robespierrre is a little different. His little black book contains the death list of everyone he wants to guillotine during the French Revolution. This one has a gritty, shadowy film noir look and was directed by Anthony Mann. Good stuff Maynard.",1359417600,111,3828,4.445078459343795
5135135,5,B0086IMNRQ,Delivered on time.  A lot of movies to watch.  The quality is fine so far.  This was purchased as a gift and everyone is happy.,1358208000,4,127,4.0
5135136,4,B0086IMNRQ,"I purchased this collection because I love watching old movies from the 1940's and 50's.  I bought this collection after I bought the 100 Mystery Classics collection which is also distributed by Mill Creek.  My only complaint is that this distributor puts some of the same movies on different collections.  This Fabulous Forties collection had a few of the same movies that were on the Mystery Classics collection that I had just finished watching.  Therefore, before you purchase any movie collection, please check the titles to be sure you aren't purchasing the same movies.  Overall, the sound and picture quality in this collection was pretty good.  If you're a fan of old movie classics, I would recommend this collection.  Just be sure it doesn't contain movies that you already own.",1355702400,140,789,5.023076923076923
5135137,5,B0086IMNRQ,"Mill Creek puts out many of these sets and a great many of these films are available on others in their collection.  That said, there are some excellent movies in this collection, ( a few not so great ones too!) many of them not well known. If you are interested in movies of the 1940s this is a great, inexpensive way to get a start.  It would also make a great gift for someone who isn't really a movie collector but likes the old ones, because many of these films do not show up  on TV, even on Turner Classic Movies very often.  Prints tend to be  not fully restored but watchable and certainly the flaws are acceptable at this price.(The price listed today (2015) has  gone up considerably since I wrote this review! I paid less than $20 dollars.)  One small quibble: ""My Man Godfrey"" which is, in my opinion, the best movie in this collection and a true classic, is a 1936 release so not really correctly placed in this collection at all.",1349913600,221,944,4.36

I would even enjoy any of the Hollywood Canteen flicks with their patriotic hit songs by the various bands & singing groups such as the Andrew sisters starring in these movie shows. I know there were many big stars, bands & men/women singing groups during these 5 utmost trying years in the country.  Movie theater & radio was the connection from the US Govenment to Hollywood to the public.  I even heard some radio shows were live & not rehearsed then released to film for tv later on.

I have a huge collection of movies and this is by far the best bang for the buck out there; nothing else even comes close.  I doubt this set will ever be surpassed.,1428796800,,467,4.284090909090909

I haven't had any problem listening or watching any of these movies! Sure there are a few places where there might have been a film splice, or the sound may be less than 2015 standards, but it's nothing that's really going to bother anyone except for the spoiled younger generation!

The rest ( so far anyway) have been great and I am enjoying them.  The ""Cheers For Miss Bishop"" is a wonderful sweet film though the picture is a little hazy in spots, but still OK to watch. ""Boys of the City"" was unwatchable. ""Sundown"" with Gene Tierney and George Sanders is a great film, but also a little bit hazy...though still very watchable and enjoyable. I still have about 8 1/2 of the disks to watch. Many good oldies in this set! So far, I am pleased and it's already been worth the money I paid for it.

But, then this is Mill Creek, and you have to expect that. You also have to expect that many, if not all, of these movies have appeared in or on other Mill Creek sets. I know for a fact some of them are on other sets that I own. But, the benefit here is that you are getting a lot for less, much less. If you want to see the early beginnings of some great actors and actresses this set is the place. So far, I have seen a very young Yul Brenner, with hair yet, a young Fred Astair and Burgess Meredith, And, now a young Richard Basehart, best remembered from ""Voyage to the bottome of the sea."" I am three movies into this set. The first two are great in my opinion, but then again, this is B-Movie mania or as they call themselves ""Mill Creek"", I love B-movies, so for me, this great stuff. To be honest, I am not certain that this stuff is available anywhere other than Mill Creek sets. And, if it is, you will pay a lot more for it than you would in a set like this. The first movie ""Port of New York"" sells for $5.98. It's fairly highly rated. The second movie ""Second Chorus"" sells for the same amount. This one had mixed ratings, though I felt it was the better of the two films. Together they make up a little less than two thirds of the cost of the whole set. The third movie ""The Black Book"" costs the same, and had low ratings. For the price of the three movies you can get this set of 50 such movies instead of three. So, I feel it's a great deal.  But, if quality visual is your thing, then perhaps you are better off with the individual disks of these classics. The fourth movie is ""Topper Returns"" a comedy classic and very highly rated. It also sells for $5.98. If you were to buy the four movies separately you would spend more than the cost of this set. Or for a better quality copy of ""Topper Returns"" you would have to spend $12.95.

The first two movies are very good, the fourth is great. These three alone make this set worth the price.

The next four movies are very good, I particularly enjoyed ""The Lady Confesses"" with a very young Hugh Beaumont(Leave it to Beaver) who is great as a man accused of the crime of killing his wife whom he had not seen in 7 years. There are plenty of plot twists and turns in this one. A true gem from the time period.

The first on this disk ""Guest in the House"" will have you thinking about it long after watching the movie.

The movie ""The Red House"" has been remade recently but the original is here with Edward G. Robinson giving a stellar performance.

The one movie on this disk I did not mention was ""Trapped"" with a very young ""Lloyd Bridges"" he plays a guy in prison for forgery, and when the feds need his help, they offer him a deal, the fun begins after that. It's a great movie, also with plenty of plot twists and unexpected outcomes.

I thoroughly enjoyed the four movies on this disk. I am certain anyone who likes the classics will love this too. The picture quality is fairly good for movies from the time period. There are some white spots, but for the most part the quality is better then that of the movies on the first disk.

I have seen several more of the movies on the dvds provided. I have to say, some of these movies are fantastic. Others, well you get a few sour notes on any keyboard. One movie I found particularly pleasurable was ""Meet John Doe"" starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck, and Gary Cooper. It's funny, serious and makes you think. I won't go into the spoilers but I will say that the movie alone goes for $10, this set is only $13. Do the math, you get a lot for a lot less buying this set. Other good movies so far that I have enjoyed are ""Dick Tracy's Dilemma"", ""D.O.A."", ""The Adventures of Tartu"", ""Dr. Kildare's Strange Case"", and ""Gung Ho"". ""The Adventures of Tartu"" and ""Gung Ho"" are both on Mill Creek's 50 movie War collection, and they are duplicated here. ""Dick Tracy's Dilemma"" also appears in one of Mill Creeks Mystery collections.

I have just seen Adventures of Gallant Bess, what a great movie. There is a man who is a drifter in the turn of the century where you have cars and hitching posts for horses. ****Spoiler Alert*** He cares about no one and nothing, just going from job to job rodeo to rodeo until he catches a horse he calls Bess, he trains her and loves her as she loves him. He is cheated out of his horse through an accident caused by an unscrupulous rodeo master. He falls in love with the daughter of his doctor and eventually gets his horse back. There are a few very very funny scenes with both the horse and the lead character (Cameron Mitchell), and a very sad but happy ending. I have to admit I cried, not something I do easily. The movie is just that powerful that you feel the love this man feels for his horse,then again I am an animal person anyway.***Spoiler Alert Over***

There are so many great movies on this set and I am only up to the sixth disc. This is a true bargain.

However, you do get 50 movies for not very much money. About 1/2 of them are watchable and about 1/4 of them are good. Unfortunately, many of the good ones are ruined by sub-transfer and recordings. This IS the 21st century and many of these could be cleaned up quite a bit. Mine will be going to the Goodwill soon.",1406678400,2,487,4.4222222222222225

5135213,3,B0086IMNRQ,"I purchased four different DVD sets for my dad on Father's Day this year.  He and my mom are in their late eighties and love to watch movies.

There are quite a few black and white movies in this pack, which unfortunately are blurred.  Very tough to watch.  The color selections are fine but there are fewer of those than the blurry ones.  It does not have to do with the year it was filmed, it appears, as older color movies in this set are clearer than newer black and white choices.

Anyway, my folks have enjoyed the few color movies they watched but you do, in this case, get what you pay for.",1403568000,,598,4.201754385964913
5135214,2,B0086IMNRQ,"It may seem like a great deal for a large collection of classics, but they are terribly poor quality. I could hardly make out the picture for about 80% of the movies.  The sound was full of static, meaning as you turn up the volume the static goes up as well.  In order to hear the actual dialogue I had to listening very closely and squint to try to read the actors lips. Needless to say, this distracted from that enjoyment we all seek as we pop in a movie to relax, unwind, and escape from reality for an hour or two.

I suggest picking a TCM collection, or buying single recordings instead for incredibly better quality (not to mention, more worth your hard-earned money). Hope this was helpful. :)",1403049600,11,702,4.384615384615385
