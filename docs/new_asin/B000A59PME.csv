8074545,5,B000A59PME,Love this Eagles dvd it just brought back memories of 2004 season of the Eagles. It was a shame they couldn't keep that team together for 2005.,1464566400,,143,4.333333333333333

Amazon had it the other day, and I pounced on it like Brian Dawkins pounced on a wide receiver coming across the middle of the field.",1459900800,,267,4.32

I gave this to a special young man who is a Philadelphia native.  He loved the gift and thanked me profusely.  He said it is good quality and the chronological view of the 2004 season is SWEET! If you like the Eagles, then this is something nice to add to your collection.  Amazon makes it easy.  Enjoy!",1314748800,3,499,6.5
8074552,4,B000A59PME,"Very enjoyable! This product uses footage from HBO's Inside the NFL to do a week-by-week review of the Eagles' 2004 season. While most of the replays are well done, some of them are way too short and don't include enough highlights from each game. Also, I've never been a big fan of Harry Kalas' narration of NFL games (to me, Harry is a Phillies icon).

The extras, while interesting, don't really convey a sense of excitement (Jeremiah Trotter's car wash? Please). One extra, however, which is almost worth the price of the disc alone, is ""Game of the Week: Falcons vs Eagles,"" a virtual play-by-play recap of the 2004 NFC Championship Game. For those who have NFL Network, you know how great a show Game of the Week is!

The only other reason I'm not giving this DVD five stars is that it's too depressing to realize that the Eagles had such a great season, only to fall short in Super Bowl XXXIX!!

I DO highly recommend this product for any and all die-hard Eagles fans!",1182816000,5,975,4.528409090909091
