8051961,5,B0007US85C,"My presentation on human origins involve many DVD documentaries and these 6 really complete the work. Excellent and professional recording. The speakers are skilled and great on their viewpoints. The religious speakers defend the non-existence of other life in the universe because their income depends on it, but I respect their right to believe what they choose. Fairly priced and great quality. Highly recommend it!",1384732800,,418,5.446153846153846
