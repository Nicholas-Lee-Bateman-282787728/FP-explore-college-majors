2701564,5,B000LBW5II,We were looking for videos to play in the car for our grandchildren. These videos not only teach great basic moral concepts but the children love them and cannot wait to get back in the car to watch more.

2701568,5,B000LBW5II,"I have this DVD in my home and the grandchildren love it. Boz DVD's are typically enjoyed by preschoolers and kindegarten children, but It was requested as a gift for my eight year old grandson who is autistic. He loves to watch it with his five year old sister.",1355097600,,262,4.36734693877551
2701569,5,B000LBW5II,"my kids, ages 4, 2 and 16 months, love the boz movies and this one is no exception. these movies seem to be very entertaining for young kids...my kids love all the songs.",1353110400,,170,4.181818181818182
2701570,5,B000LBW5II,"I got the Boz Dvd from my close friend for my 2yr old son to watch. I sat with him to watch the Adventures of Boz that very same day. I was so taken by the way the dvd captured his attention, by the way it was demonstrated through everyday life situations.

The songs contributed tremendously towards getting his attention which allowed him to finally sit through an entire movie (dvd), which is very unusal for him. He wanted to watch it over and over and over again since then. The prayer at the end of each segment is truely inspiring for any family to encourage their children to be thankful to GOD's blessings.

My son knows this dvd like his prayer book. The songs are programmed in his head like a broken record and has learned everything from shapes to sharing etc just by watching the Boz.

The producers of Boz should be proud. This was well executed. Your money will be well spent. I AM TRUELY A BOZ FAN.",1351123200,,915,4.3391812865497075
2701571,5,B000LBW5II,"Seriously, so adorable.  I love the message, I love the way it's delivered.  And so does my 4 year old!  It elicits some interesting questions from him about faith.  My son doesn't care for Veggie Tales but he loves Boz!",1341619200,,220,4.425
2701572,5,B000LBW5II,"BOZ ""Adventures in Imagination"" is such a healthy approach to children's video fare.  It counteracts the passivity to which children often fall prey in the ""glued to the tube, WATCHING"" norm; instead, this video encourages ACTIVITY while watching... get up and dance a bit, sing along... be appropriately ENGAGED in the ""adventures"" of imaginative ""play"" processes!

The 3 vignettes in this ""imagination"" DVD include within the delightful stories the themes of helping/appreciating each other, enjoying the library & creating your own imaginative stories, creative use of toys & everyday objects for use in play - again, counteracting the passivity so prevalent in modern children's ""entertainment.""

Within the stories, good manners & positive personal habits are incorporated seamlessly - ""no big deal"" - just a pleasant natural way to live life personally and together (reinforcements such as: putting things away, being self-starters in REimagining diverse ongoing uses for everyday items used in playtime, etc.)!

The prayers (meals, bedtime) are brief, sweet, and cultivate an attitude/awareness of thankfulness and appreciation. Also welcome is the multi-racial inclusion in the main characters.  The audio CD is a fun bonus.  An all-around great resource for children & those who love them!",1289174400,3,1298,5.596938775510204

8160676,5,B000LBW5II,"When I caught my 3 year old praying with the kids on the show I was hooked!  This particular episode promotes imagination, service (raising food for needy families), reading, and positive family and faith values in a high quality show.  It is made at much higher quality than many other faith based cartoons.  I bought this because my son is the youngest and prone to the Star Wars and Stikbot world of his older siblings. I wanted a form of media that encourages his innocence and this was perfect t!",1479600000,,501,4.544444444444444
