8672730,2,B00MJ5KSXI,"I Brought the dvd from his Rich Company website, however when the dvd was sent to me it didn't have disc two and when i spoke with customer service they promised a new one would come in and it didn't, mind y'all i supported because of the videos on YouTube. However the video is of poor quality the lighting isn't good, especially when cutting hair. Second the there is no caption nontheless the instructions he gives are not detailed or elaborate for you understand the gist of what needs to be accomplish. NO personal bias i think his is dope according to videos i see on YouTube but the Dvd is not worth the money unless he makes a new one and gives a preview or snippet. But i  do enjoy other products from his website The Rich Barber Company. Just keeping it Real",1457913600,,768,4.333333333333333
