8252161,5,B0013MOLPO,"This is a great video to show to men's groups, men's circles, or those diagnosed and struggling with depression. The video not only spotlights men of different age groups and cultures but also demonstrates how family and friends are impacted by depression.

Highly recommend this video. Church groups may want to purchase this and arrange for ""movie night"" to show the film to their congregation so people can start talking about what is usually ignored.",1400371200,,454,5.053333333333334
8252162,4,B0013MOLPO,"The main point of this video is invaluable: real men get depression too. However, compared to the PBS documentary Depression: Out of the Shadows (which is superb), this one, although very informative, drags on. I would recommend this to men who have/had depression for validation and not to feel as alone. You may also learn a few things.

Some themes/symptoms from the documentary:
Feeling isolation.
Eating a lot.
Worthlessness. Feeling different from everybody else, like you are weird, incompetent, and even subhuman.
Forgetting what it is like to feel ""normal"".
Rage, breaking things.
Hard to get out of bed.
Feeling extremely ""down"". Pain seems bottomless.
Putting up a front to meet others' expectations of who you should be.
Affects all aspects of your life: relationships, school, and work.
Thoughts are out of control. ""Wheels are spinning.""
Offers to help (such as, ""I think you should see a therapist"") are taken as criticism.
Loved ones are ""walking on eggshells"" for fear of triggering a feat of rage or hurting your feelings.
Impulsive and risky behavior, thrill-seeking.
A sense that it's something that can be brushed away, because you can't see it. A sense that there is a single cause, and if I could just find what it is, this weight would go away.
Difficulty of accepting that it's something more, that it won't go away easily, and that you have no control over it, and that it is a real disease.
Normalizing depression: believing that it is the normal way to feel, and that the feelings are the natural response to life's stressors. ""It's just how life is... It seems like it's never going to end, things aren't going to get better."" However, thinking about depression as an illness is powerful because it gives hope that things could be changed.
""I feel uncomfortable talking about it because it means you are weak.""
""Nobody picked up on the signs I exhibited. I wish somebody did, because it would show that somebody cared about me.""
Problems and emotions seem unmanageable.
The positive that came out of it was: gaining new coping skills, having pride in overcoming the biggest adversity in the human experience, knowing your abilities and your limits, recognizing signs of an upcoming episode to prevent a relapse.",1336435200,4,2240,4.957446808510638
8252163,5,B0013MOLPO,"if you are a man (or woman) and have never experienced clinical depression in your life, the odds are that you will at some point in your life (unless you are in perfect health, have a million dollars, and are active spiritually).

With that being said, this documentary focuses on the fact that 1 in 4 men in the U.S. suffer depression; yet half of that number never receive treatment.  Part of the problem is the stigma of having depression in the first place.  Another part of the problem is that men in particular (as opposed to women) are resistant to receive help for this problem, for fear that they will appear weak, ""crazy"", or inferior.

This program features discussion about the causes, effects and treatments of this brain disorder.

* highly recommended *",1291075200,6,769,4.708955223880597
8252164,5,B0013MOLPO,"Thousands of videos have been produced which attempt to illustrate and explain depression to the non-clinician.  This is the best that I have seen in over thirty years of psychiatric practice.  Although the video is primarily about the forms of depression in men, its overall scope makes it equally helpful to women.  The treatment recommendations are sound.  The positive outcomes bring much hope to the sufferer. This is a ""must see"" for family members and spouses, as well as those who suffer from the illness itself.  It is especially helpful for someone you know who is experiencing these symptoms, but remains confused about their cause.",1264550400,2,643,5.085714285714285
8252165,3,B0013MOLPO,"Having watched this film, and being a psychology major, and having depression myself, I am reviewing this from a particular perspective. That being said, overall, I believe this is a great documentary to watch for those who have depression, or may think they do and are not sure. This is a mental health condition that has been hard for men to open up with and to deal with, for cultural reasons etc. This film allows the male viewer to see that they are not alone, and that there is nothing wrong with expressing ones emotions and seeking help. This film was long over due and it is a great progress that it has been made and that us men are being allowed by society to be human beings and to have feelings like everyone else.",1209340800,17,727,4.392592592592592
