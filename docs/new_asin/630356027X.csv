686923,5,630356027X,"This was just great, good fun! At times a satire, comedy, bloody gore fest and homage to gentlemen spy movies. I want to watch the extended version for my personal library but I walked out of the theater happy and ready to share the joy with people who would like this film.

Colin's character Galahad made this film for me. Everyone did a great job but Colin was hands down the MVP.

If you liked John wick you will like this! Don't take my word for it. Watch it and decide for yourself.",1423785600,2,488,4.236559139784946
686924,5,630356027X,"""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" has done something revolutionary. This is a film that introduces a clothing line to cater toward all of the gentlemen out there, but it does so simultaneously with the film's release. It doesn't have a wave of successful momentum to fall back on. This is banking on financial success and famous faces to sell expensive menswear. It was very unusual seeing a screening kick off with a sponsor for a clothing line for the film we were about to see, but it's likely something we'll see more of in the future.

The opening credits are also a bit different. Everything that pops up on-screen before the ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" logo appears is the result of an explosion. The rubble from that explosion bounces off the ground and onto the screen to form the credits. It's a little detail that makes something extremely simple very eye-catching.

The villain of the film is Richmond Valentine, who is played by Samuel L. Jackson. What distinguishes this role from the other memorable characters Jackson has played throughout his career is that not only is he physically repulsed by violence, but Jackson portrays Valentine with this incredible lisp. Valentine is essentially a sociopath with genocide on his mind for his own personal gain and the character is given this ridiculous and amusing twist because of his lisp.

The film itself has the same bite as ""Kick-Ass,"" which was another collaboration between director Matthew Vaughn and comic book writer Mark Millar. At its core, ""Kingsman"" is about gentlemen stepping up and becoming spies so there's this element of proper behavior, spectacular hygiene, and looking one's absolute best at all times. But then there's that Mark Millar twist to the writing that throws a plethora of vulgarity and raunchy humor to not only make the film hilarious but more human and relatable, as well.

What's interesting is that if you just look at the action sequences without really thinking about it they seem really dynamic and spectacular. They speed up and slow down in a way that allows you to process everything that's occurring much like the action in ""300,"" but it flows in a unique way. If you dig a little deeper, the action sequences seem like a homage to the action in the Timur Bekmambetov directed action film ""Wanted,"" which is also based on a comic Mark Millar wrote. But the ""Freebird"" church sequence is just exceptional and worth the price of admission alone. Colin Firth reportedly did 80% if his own stunts and his work looks to have really paid off. This is really violent stuff that capitalizes on jaw-dropping moments to stroll from one victim to the next.

This is the feature film debut of Welsh actor Taron Egerton and he handles the role brilliantly. Egerton slides into the role of a punk kid with ease yet makes his uphill struggle sympathetic and interesting. His ability to do parkour results in a pretty great scene in the film, as well. Colin Firth is also just the definition of a gentleman who reels you in with all of the knowledge he's gained as a spy over the years. Even when Firth curses, he seems to do it in a polite way that is laugh out loud funny. Firth is practically a bonafide action star by the end of the film and would give John Wick a run for his money.

""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" politely and eloquently clobbers you with undeniable wit, frantic yet unflinching action, and extremely adult but uproarious humor. Experiencing this film is like putting an R-rated spin on your favorite James Bond film or obscenely asking for Grey Poupon while you bash someone's face in.",1423785600,,3599,4.796774193548387
686925,5,630356027X,"Kingsman: The Secret Service was founded (and funded) by wealthy families after WWI who found themselves with no heirs. They could see the flaws in their government and its intelligence gathering, so they created a powerful, richly funded organization that NO one knows about or even suspects.

This R-rated (language and violence) action/comedy/adventure is directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake"" and ""X-Men: First Class""). After a bloody opening, this unpredictable romp starts with a parcour chase through city streets, and demonstrates enough gadgets to impress even Q, of James Bond fame. We see a raw kid recruited for training as a super spy, then we get to watch him learn the ropes while a gleeful villain launches a brilliant plot.

We see:
  * Colin Firth (""The King's Speech"") Harry Hart/Galahad is the recruiter. Our young hero's father had saved Galahad's life at the cost of his own. This dapper character has echoes of Steed from TV's original ""Avengers"" and a tongue-in-cheek Sean Connery from early ""Bond"" movies.
  * Taron Egerton (""Testament of Youth"") is Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin, the recruit I just mentioned. He's a street tough burdened with a mother who has been going downhill ever since his father died.
  * Samuel L. Jackson (""The Avengers"" I DID mention this is R-rated, didn't I?) Evil Valentine has a plan to save the world and he's rich enough to do it! I'll bet his product placements for McDonald's Happy Meal and Google Glass help!
  * Mark Strong (""The Guard"") Merlin can sort out the applicants until there is only one left standing. This is the perfect role for Strong; It's great to see this wonderful actor (finally!) granted the screen time he so richly deserves.
  * Michael Caine (""Interstellar"") Arthur explains to our hero what the villain is doing, and why.
  * Sofia Boutella (""StreetDance 2"") is Gazelle, can you guess what she brings to the table? Not only mad hand-to-hand combat skills, but a razor-sharp blade attached to her leg. Emma Peel should have been so lucky!

This carefully choreographed martial arts violence is gruesome and bloody, but the movie is so cartoony our screening audience laughed, and then applauded when the cigarette lighter/grenade mowed down some of the enemies. It was also fun to watch our hero bond with the puppy he selected; he thought it would grow up to be a bulldog but it was actually a pug!",1423785600,2,2376,4.905

This title was in my first purchases and I would highly recommend this set to everyone who is collecting materials like this and this is another example of openness in the United States. You will never see this kind of movie about secret details of the other countries. You will 'attend' how the several Presidents were assassinated or happened to be the targets of the assassination attempts. There is a great chance to get the movie online, so do not delay, get the movie right now and you will enjoy it.

So it's too adult for a young teen but also too simplistic for an adult. And it didn't help that the main actor was dull and uncharismatic.

Overall, the movie was very cliched and unimaginative, not to mention terribly sexist. Definitely not anywhere near as exciting as the previews made it look! It was hard to watch through the end, despite all the high budget special effects and what not.",1518307200,,642,4.582608695652174

My mother and I are not big fans of blood, but I thought this was not over the top at all. It almost seemed like a video game, which makes sense since it is based on a comic book! We all greatly enjoyed it and thought it was a fun and quirky movie. The only thing is that I would have liked  the villain to not have a lisp as they seemed to use it to perpetuate negative stereotypes associated with speech impediments, though I know Samuel L Jackson's intentions were good (there is an article about why he gave his character a stutter).

An old-style James Bond film, as opposed to the reboots.
An /entertaining/ James Bond film, as opposed to the reboots.

They even made the training sequence entertaining!
Unlike, say, /Divergent/, which merely made it ... interesting in theory but dull as dishwater in actuality.

I have read the bad reviews and these people are looking in movies for life lessons.  I have seen the movie numerous times and haven't even noticed the outlandish f-bombs.  Maybe I have missed something butt, when does the sight of a shapely rear end mean anal sex, what would have been said if there was full frontal nudity.  I loved the part of Samuel L. Jackson, his character, with its weakness was supported by strong individuals, like in real life.  The church scene was great, anyone that complains about it, obviously has been so busy counting f-bombs that they have not bothered to watch any of the film up to that point.  To all of those complainers out there, when you start disliking a movie, please do yourself a favor and turn it off.

690831,1,630356027X,"I think it's meant to be a fun take-off on the 60s British spy cliche.  HOWEVER, there are some clear issues and scenes that come back to haunt me long after I've seen it.
The villainous henchman (henchwoman, here) is rather repulsive.  I realize henchmen are supposed to have no redeeming qualities, while the villains themselves are the fun characters, but this one in particular is repulsive.  The method in which she kills, esp in the intro scene of her character, is something unforgettable and not in a good way.  It is shocking.
But there is the female lead character, an influential royal personage who is abducted and thereafter she is treated by the screenplay and director as disposable and objectified.  She is demeaned.  Is this a way for the males to get back at her for her status?  It seems so as it plays out.
The scene where she offers herself to her rescuer as his reward is already disheartening but then she is objectified by a video-feed contacts-wearing supposed-hero who is accepting her offer while relaying this feed back to his remote handler.  Needless to say, even the sexual offer she'd laid out as a reward is suspect as it would be a male fantasy.
I'd like to put this movie into a time capsule of this time period of male sexual harassers and the variety in which this plays out in film.  The female characters, esp the empowered ones, are treated pretty badly in this, almost as if in some male revenge sexual fantasy.",1514764800,,1452,4.618677042801556

691659,3,630356027X,"Spoiler alert.

We really enjoyed the over the top storytelling and effects for what they were.  It was a good escape/action movie with a nod to Bond and maybe Kill Bill etc. BUT, and Im still disappointed that I have to reduce a star from this lighthearted movie, it didn't have to include anal humor and barf spewing. The exploding heads of everyone in colorful smoke ala fireworks...? Okay... It was a reasonable treatment of the event so as to not make it gory. I ended up appreciating that, but the afore mentioned low brow additions? What a bummer.

693633,1,630356027X,"A waste of money, time and film. Not clever and not even funny. It's filled with over the top violence and vulgarities and this is coming from someone who doesn't mind violence and vulgarities if it adds to the story.
That's not what happened here however. If I had a dollar for every time a character used the f-word (an most characters did, multiple times in one sentence.) I could have made a decent wad of cash. The f-word happens in real life of course, I use it on occasion, but this was forced into the majority of dialogue just to be...to be what? Edgy? Hip? With it? If so, it didn't work.
  As for the story? A James Bond want-to-be with none of the charm or wit. That's this movie in a nutshell.

Instead of the typical one liner and proceeding to kick ass to eventually saving the indivdual. There was clear as day not word for word mind you. But, to put it bluntly after saving ""the world"" the Princess offered anal sex. I was like wtf. This movie was cleanish and then you can put it in my butt after you save the world. Very weird.

(Ok, so one of the good guys is a rich white girl, who doesn't end up doing much of the fighting and just needs to be rescued while she does background missions to support the hero.)

Mostly, I found the action to be unengaging because it was so one-sided.  There was no sense of triumph, just slaughter of incompetent opponents.  There was no arc of overcoming hardship.  The gimmick of the heroes being super-polite during combat was funny for 5 minutes, then lost its charm and failed to carry the movie.",1510185600,,681,4.495934959349594

Manners Maketh Man.
And tongue-firmly-implanted in cheek, this spy caper movie about a young street punk who gets a chance to fill his late father's shoes in the Bringman - an oh so prim-and-proper British Spy Agency is great fun.
Yes, ""Kingsman"" is a bit over-the-top, and it pays homage to the old fashioned James Bond movies that is probably even today a bit risque, but it's fun, right down to it's wickedly cool assassin and evil villain who wants to save the planet by giving away free cell phones that when activated will cause people to go on killing rampages.  Spoiler Alert - the fight-to-the-death scene in the church is pretty gruesome, but well choreographed.
Not for everyone.
Still great fun!

I decided to give this silly, violent movie a chance and I simply couldn't believe the overt violence and incessant use of the F-Bomb. I'm no prude and maybe even use the word too much in my own dialect, but having the F bomb in the film over 6,587,933 times is overkill. Speaking of overkill; the death rate, especially in the church scene, was so orgiastic that I couldn't even keep a body count. I'm all for so called ""free speech"", but I think the Founding Fathers meant us to have the right to speak out against injustice and government corruption and not the ""freedom"" to interject the F-Bomb 34 times in each sentence.

With the horrendous recent events in Las Vegas and elsewhere, I can't help but think that kids (and some adults) are going to watch this revolting film (in spite of the R rating) and decide that the frenetically violent scene in the church can be adopted as their ""acceptable means of dispute resolution"".

People wonder why our society is so violent. Just watch this movie and you will get your answer.",1508630400,,1355,4.526530612244898

Think of if Quentin Tarentino did a James Bond film, although there were more plot twists here than in a typical Bond film.  Yes, it's an action film, shoot 'em up, blow 'em up, and kick there a-- into next week---or worse!!  But it's FUN, and that is what the director was trying to accomplish.  Accomplish he did, in our view, and we can't wait to see the sequel.  All the main stars---Colin Firth, Michael Caine, Samuel L. Jackson---brilliant, as always.  But relative unknown, newcomers Taron Egerton and Sofia Boutella also made the picture, along with other, strong supporting cast.  The comedic effects throughout are well-placed, and---I won't spoil it for you---a major scene toward the end had me laughing out loud.  It will have you going:  OMG!!

The Kingsman is a rollicking movie. I really enjoyed it.
This movie focuses on a young man named Eggsywho has been living with his mom and her boyfriend. He has two good friends that tend to lead him into trouble. They do drugs, go joy riding in cars and so on. When enters an older man who makes over Eggsy, teaches Eggsy to put his joy riding experiences to good use and off they go to save the world. During the course of the movie Eggsy grows up, saves the world, meets the girl of his dreams and even manages to save his mom from an abusive boy friend.

I gave it a four star rating because of the swear words. It did not need to drop the F bomb nearly as much as it did. It seems that should be one of the 'gentleman' rules. There was swearing just for swearings sake sadly.

Otherwise, I think this is a fun show.",1508112000,,1096,4.136150234741784
695093,3,630356027X,"When you associate Britain with spy film, you automatically think about James Bond. Presuming filmakers wanted to combine the elegance of James Bond with a younger cast and without the sex tourism Bond jokes, this is how Kingsman was created to fill that void. In a way the film has some nice merits. Starring a troubled British teenager that was the son of a spy that had an honorable death, he grows up with a chip on his shoulder due to living with an abusive stepfather.

After getting arrested protecting his friends from a pub fight and booked on assault charges, he phones the mysterious Kingsman number that was passed to him after his father's death and is strangely enough released from jail within a handful of minutes.

Colin Firth isn't best known for action roles and he almost seems out of place as a sort of mentorship role in this film. While the training scenes have some high and low points, they can confuse younger viewers thinking some of the applicants were killed during the individual tests. It's as if life was easily discarded as something useless.

While the supporting spy cast are okay, the villains are totally unrealistic. Samuel L. Jackson plays a lot of great villanous roles but he seems silly in this film at best. It's hard to believe he's the big enchilada. The film gets some merit from the mostly fast pace, but the head explosion scenes are so ridiculous that a movie that was striving for a grim theme ends up being hard to take seriously. Might be worthy as a rental, but there are far better action films out there.",1508025600,,1559,4.620938628158845

That led me to return to its predecessor and it also helped that my wife is a big Colin Firth fan.  What can I say but this flick has it all.  Reminiscent of the best Bond flicks with a contemporary touch.  Intricate plotting, tight direction, slam-bang action sequences and superb performances.  This is the kind of vehicle Firth deserved years ago perfectly exploiting the suave charm and machismo that was obvious to his longtime fans.  Mark Strong can do no wrong perfectly cast as the stolid Merlin.  Samuel L. Jackson cements his reputation as one of our finest thespians elevating the lisping megalomaniac Valentine beyond clich.

Though when it does the ride is pretty fun, even the parts that are all training and passing the test parts are fun.
I have watched this one a few times since I got it and originally I purchased the DVD and gave that away to my brother after watching it and purchased the Blue Ray to get the extras since I wanted to know more about it. If you are not one to watch the extras, and you liked this movie, I would take the time to watch the ones with the director and get his take on how he did this and why, worth the time.",1506643200,3,868,3.8820224719101124

697516,1,630356027X,"This negative review has to do with Amazon's streaming quality and not the movie.  The movie was fun and easily a 3 to 4 star movie.  The one star comes from Amazon's Video quality with no way to change it to improve viewing.  The video came in with a stretched (horizontally) and squashed (vertical) appearance and the top and bottom of the video was clearly cut off by the black wide screen bars on the top and bottom.  The missing top and bottom of the video is evident because the sub-titles, the couple times a foreign language was used, was chopped off and not legible.  The amazon video app had a ""video settings"" section that actually had no settings to change or any way to try and inform Amazon I needed a different expect ratio.  I have a 51"" HD TV, nothing special yet this recent movie couldn't be played in a standard format?  All my other streaming services seem to be able to handle this screen.

I paid for the HD version of the rental and the clarity was horrible.  I had to stop the playback twice and resume a view minutes later.  Each time I did this, the video would come in blocky and took several minutes of viewing for it to clear up and become the higher quality (other services take seconds if not instantly HD quality), but it never reached HD level quality, unless Amazon's version of HD is 480p or 780p.  The sound playback was often fuzzy.  Also the stream oftentimes decreased to blocky quality all on its own, and while I would be tempted to accept it was my own internet connection having troubles, I have to deny it because I've streamed football games, Netflix and shows directly from different broadcasting network websites (ABC, CBS, etc.) and none of them have ever had these issues, yet the first Amazon Prime video I rent did it 3 or 4 times during the 2 hour movie.

Now I wish I had just watched the edited version of the Kingsman that I DVRed from the FXX channel instead of thinking I could get more enjoyment from an Amazon Rental. Edited with commercials would have been more enjoyed that unedited with terrible video quality.

I won't waste my money on further Amazon video rentals.  Thanks for teaching me a lesson.",1505952000,,2164,4.48469387755102

697651,2,630356027X,"Not too great, a few parts stood out as entertaining, but over all it simply missed the mark.  It was choppy and somehow managed to be too long while also feeling like it was missing something.  Character development/skill advancement was totally glazed over so that they could cram in all the plot points and cool gadgetry.

However, I do give the movie props for including a character who kicks serious butt with her razor sharp prosthetic legs.  Entertainment media needs to do a way better job of portraying diversity as normal-- so I give it a second star for doing that.

But mostly, this thing is just chock full of latent misogyny-- and at least one scene that is less 'latent' and more 'blatant'.  This entire movie is driven by the concept of re-imagining the spy cliches of decades past-- the entire script/plot relies heavily on that predictability, and yet, somehow, the most boring and predictable thing about this movie was how overwhelmingly androcentric it was from start to finish.  The women in this movie make a pathetic showing and are essentially afterthoughts.  Perhaps the most eyebrow quirking, wry chuckle inducing example of this is when the heroes realize they've just saved the world: the team leader is praising the main man for a job well done, and then tacks on a ""you as well"" to the third member of the team, the female member..... who, incidentally, has been ignored for the previous 20 minutes of the movie despite being the one who is ACTUALLY a Kingsman.

698092,5,630356027X,"Tongue in cheek british spy flick which will get you thinking wth no way, yet it all sort of flows well.  Samuel Jackson seems synonymous with fbombs and violence and its not lacking here from all the cast.  The  cast with newcomers and old stars by the way is very good and work well together.  The effects are 90% great with a few being too cgi'd and fake looking but didn't distract from the movie.  Well violence is part of the theme and fight scenes are great if not believeable.  The slowmo is fantastic and gory.  So not for young kids but great movie for the pizza night with the guys.",1505088000,,593,4.288288288288288

So many people went into this not realizing it was based on a Marvel offshoot comic authored by Mark Millar, and is part of the same universe as Kick-Ass, penned by the same, that I can understand that thought when the movie is approached with no context.

While it certainly had a more coherent structure than the aforementioned property (referring to the films), the tone was similar enough that I found it to be an equally-matched comic-book-brought-to-the-screen entry. The cast nailed every beat, and the director knew very well how to bring the tone of the comic out, and exactly when to take things into the realm of the absurd. Colin Firth delivers a superb character, and Samuel Jackson now has a phenomenal Marvel hero and Marvel-offshoot villain on his resume.",1504656000,,932,4.861635220125786

3) the profanity is extreme . . . not just a word here and there but out of all characters' mouths and from start to finish.
4) it is at its core a black cultural movie that exudes racism and intolerance not to mention a subtle mockery of gays in the way the Jackson character speaks and the disabled in the way the Jackson character's assistant is a ""blade runner"" who uses her blades as literal blades to kill people

What it is about:
A rich American gets everyone to use his cellphone/internet service by offering it free if they use his SIM card. His plan it to kidnap the rich people of the world, lock them up in his dungeon until he activates a device in the SIM cards people took from him that take over their minds forcing them to kill each other. He wants to wipe out the earth's population with the exception of the smart rich people so he can save the planet from climate change. He even enlists the help of Barack Obama who is still president. He also plants a device into the heads of people who are working for him to accomplish this and if they are no longer useful or in danger of exposing his plan he blows up their heads.

It reminds me of Austin Powers, Get Smart Maxwell, and Roger Moore's James Bond all mashed up with a HUGE dash of Robert Downy Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes. filming techniques and Kill Bill style scenes  I was not disappointed - well, just slightly. Okay, so here me out - the language was just over-the-top, too much for me. There was so much emphasis on ""Kingsmen"" being so stately, presentable, and distinguished but they had street-gutter language. Another reason I point this out is that all the graphic killing produced no blood. And, I mean NO blood. That said, I think the writers and director missed a huge comedic point to have their Kingsmen ""swear"" in a very nostalgic, antiquated manner that bewilders Eggsy and Eggsy's street language grates the Kingsmen.  If Mark Gratiss or Stephen Moffat had made this movie, they would have capitalized on that point.

It's violent - especially the fight scene in a hate group's church, and some of the scenes/themes are just bizarre.

One morning I awoke and said scene teased my brain. So onto Amazon I go to rent Kingsman. I proceeded to watch the movie four times that morning. I'm an early riser. It was on my third play through that I realized there is a scene in the credits. Needless to say I decided to purchase the movie. Looking further into this movie I found there is a second do in a couple months! Also, that the movie was based on a comic series. Luckily the comic store had all of them. The movie and comics are just different enough for both to be extremely entertaining. Well, in my opinion.
It is a movie that knows it is over the top and embraces it. Fun from beginning to end. Loved all the characters, especially Mr. Jackson's.",1501286400,3,937,4.299435028248587

701274,5,630356027X,"My kids love this movie, and stupidly, I thought that was enough of a reason for me not to watch it. When I saw the initial trailer, i thought it would be one of those Harry Potter, Hunger Games, etc. kid flicks. However, after continued recommendations from the kids, I sat down and gave it a view, and boy was i pleasantly surprised. After realizing it was rated R, I realized that the language and tone were well in line with my type of movie.

This is an awesome little spy movie! The plot centers on a young Brit from the wrong side of the tracks, who's father was killed while working for a secret order of spies. His death buys the kid a free ride into the organization, and the hijinks ensue. The young man learns of the spy order's history, their purpose, and how to be a Kingsman. This is a young James Bond on steroids, and may I add, a lot more fun and interesting to watch.

Samuel L. Jackson is hysterical as the wacky villain, and Colin Firth is excellent as the young spy's mentor. When Samuel L. gets into his rant about his Arch Criminal designs (even better than Mr. Glass), you might just be rooting for him to succeed, or not. Michael Cain is Michael Cain, of course, but Taron Egerton holds his own and maybe tops them all with his punk to gentleman act. My Fair Lady and James Bond in one film, and it works! Most of you kids don't know My Fair Lady, so just enjoy the show. All the acting is very well done, and the action scenes are fast, fun, and head spinning to watch. Although this steals a lot from the Bond films, it does so in a tongue in cheek manner that pokes fun at the source material, and all the while keeps you engrossed in the story of a young spy learning the ropes in order to save the world when things go ""T!ts Up"" as the Brits so humorously put it.

If you are a Christian or like Christians, or if you are just sick and tired of stereotypical anti-religious hatred then avoid this movie.

Sadly, even with that scene removed the movie would still be boring and cliche' and still not worth your money or time. If you miss this one you won't miss much.",1497312000,,579,4.351851851851852

701773,5,630356027X,"""Manners.  Maketh.  Man.  Do you know what that means?""

Kingsman is a movie that's ""taking the piss"" out of itself.  It's a self-aware parody of the most lovable cliches in spy and action flicks.
Guns?  Check.  Gadgets?  Check.  Fight scenes?  Check.  Lovable British quips, euphemisms, and dry humour?  Check.  Kingsman from beginning to end is a movie that asks you less to suspend your disbelief, and more to put on your funny glasses and dunce hat.  It's not so self-aware that it's constantly droning about it, however.

PLOT:  4/5 Kingsman's story is more-or-less well thought-out, and is cohesive through and through.  Some early establishing storyline is missing for sake of runtime, but nothing so much that would ruin the experience.  Of course, Kingsman is designed to be entertainment for the story-weary, so don't expect Shakespeare.

CINEMATOGRAPHY:  4/5 Kingsman's photography is beautiful throughout.  Some obvious CGI ruins the more beautiful moments, but overall a perfectly honed experience.  ""Continuous/one-shot"" takes used in moderation spice up the action, while excellent practical set-pieces bring the story to life.

EXCITEMENT:  5/5 Kingsman is absolutely thrilling.  From beginning to end, it's guns, guts, and glory, with only intermittent bureaucracy to interrupt.

TAKEAWAY:  5/5  Kingsman is lacking only where the harshest critics look: realism and depth.  Kingsman, however, is a story that *intentionally* aims to miss the incredibly high bar of similar spy films such as the Bond or Bourne franchises.  If that can be kept in mind, Kingsman is a very worthy action/comedy to be added to your collection.",1497139200,6,1640,5.367588932806324

I ended up fast forwarding through much of the end. I honestly can think of no worse movie than this one, in all the years of movie watching.
I love spy movies. This is not a proper spy movie. There is no brilliant plot, nothing to uncover that isn't obvious in the first few minutes, no cunning subterfuge, no suspense, no charm, and we couldn't care two cents about the characters. The only reason I thought it might be good is because it involves spies, Colin Firth and Michael Caine. I'm sad and disappointed they chose to sign on for such a terrible, plotless movie. In fact, watching it felt like some maniac pervert just wanted to get some graphically violent scenes out of his system and had to find a plot to justify all the swearing and limb chopping, and exploding heads. This is seriously the worst writing I have ever witnessed. And can we please just stop casting Samuel L Jackson as the villain? Even if the plot wasn't so thin and obvious (crazy black dude with bug eyes wants to cleanse the world-yeah, that's original), casting him with an all white cast pretty much immediately gives everything away.",1496188800,,1267,4.537117903930131

702012,2,630356027X,"This is not a movie in the sense that the Jason Bourne, or James Bond movies are; no, this is more of a mishmash of action cinema, puerile nonsense, and gratuitous violence. On the one hand, one of the major themes of the movie is ""culling"" the human race of the 99% who aren't rich or spectacularly talented. The villain's plan is that nly the dumb and average die.on a particular day. The brilliant and the rich get to survive in some underground castle. That part reminded me of Middle Ages Noble People partying in a castle while poor people died of the Plague in the cities and towns. To be honest, that theme can be found so frequently in human history that I'm not surprised it is presented here. I'm thinking, of course, of all the exceptionals who don't have to go to war - like those who tested out of the Vietnam War, for example.
Other that that, the rest is pure, comic book mind nonsense. Lots of competition, violence, and ""sound and fury signifying nothing"" fill up the rest of the movie. Two of the most disappointing are a bullet proof, umbrella shield/gun, and a sad, truncated space fall. An umbrella that shoot bullets is just stupid. A fall from the edge of space that didn't use the real, space fall video, such as: (Felix Baumgartner's Highest and Fastest Freefall) which can be readily found on YouTube is tragic. Splicing Baumgartner's free fall from near space into this film flop might have actually saved it at the box office. This is an action movie and it ended, more or less, with two scenes: scene 1) had nearly everyone of the chosen survivors die from an exploding head, and scene 2) the hero bu@@ering the queen of Sweden.
Ultimately, the thee plot in KINGSMAN is so thin and the writing so bad that KINGSMAN makes a Vin Diesel movie look like Tolstoy's War & Peace in comparison.",1496102400,,1816,4.522796352583587

But, once the violence started kicking in, mostly towards the end, I felt it went downhill very quickly. I don't mind violence if it moves the plot forward, or even if it just fits within the story line, but their dark humor approach to the massive killing of the world's elite, including the POTUS, came across in poor taste. An otherwise witty script was suddenly filled with crass jokes and innuendos.  Again, a crass joke, if it fits the delivering character, is acceptable, but these jokes were detrimental to the development of the characters, and caused them to act in conflict with who they'd been up to that point.

702888,5,630356027X,"I do not write reviews often, and nor do I think I am particularly good at it, but I do feel rather compelled to do so for this movie. Kingsman: The Secret Service was a pick for a Sunday night movie in order to pass the time. I had not done any research into its success/failure as a movie, I did not look into the plot, and finally I did not go into this movie expecting anything short of a time killer.

With that being said: I will be recommending this movie for everyone I know that has not seen it and needs a late Sunday movie to kill the time, because I cannot express enough how much of a joy it was to watch.

Kingsman, to me at first, seemed like another droning spy type movie with some substance (enough to combat the lazy Sunday blues) but not enough to make it worthy of praising. Yet here I am doing just that: I adore this movie wholeheartedly. I found very few moments that made me look away at my phone (as I am sure many of you do during a home movie) in order to break the monotony of the film. You know, those moments of a film that are so very predictable that you simply interpret what will happen, and often are confirmed correct, so you look at your phone for whatever reason in order to wait out the inevitable. I will not jest and say that this movie is perfect in every way but I can confirm, it did the job and it did it so very well.

I will end with this note: I am an aircraft mechanic by trade and there is a part later in the movie where an aircraft comes out of the ground. I quite literally lost my metaphorical mind and could not stop spazzing to my wife about how wrong that scene was. And that, the moment where I lost my cool and starting screaming about wonky physics, is why I love this movie. I only walked away with one criticism and it was based on a part of this film that doesn't actually relate at all to the plot, progression, or style. 1K/1K",1491091200,12,1892,4.067024128686327

This movie is more inclined to the younger generation, yes, but if you like excitement and adventure, then take a peek. You won't be bored, I assure you. Plenty of action to keep you on the edge of your seat with lots of cool secret spy gadgets that make you wonder... do they really make that?  As for the older crowd, check out Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth.

703134,5,630356027X,"I am honestly shocked that this movie doesn't have a higher review. I always recommend this movie if someone enjoyed watching John Wick (and I always recommend John Wick if they haven't seen it yet). 15/16 people I have made a recommendation to watch this movie have enjoyed it on varying levels, and only 1 just didn't care to finish watching it.

Listen, this isn't the best movie I have ever seen, but this movie knows what it is and does a very good job in that respect. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's an entertaining modern spy film that pays homage to the older ones. I also have to note that I've never been a big fan of spy movies in general (some are fantastic, but a lot fall flat for me).

I absolutely love Colin Firth (one of my favorite actors) and it was so fantastic seeing him in this sort of role. I thought he did a fantastic job in this movie. Samuel L. Jackon's performance was ... well, classic Samuel L. Jackson. If you expect a lot out of him then you will always be ... let's just say ""disappointed"" and leave it at that.

I  have watched this movie easily 6 times now and plan on watching this with each new friend I encounter that hasn't seen it.

Gory? Certainly in certain parts, but it's not constant. They also did a splendid job at the end of the movie avoiding unnecessary gore in a rather creative (and rather comical) way.",1489708800,3,1373,4.326848249027237

I was a Bond and British Avengers fan and this movie captures and even expands on the things that made those shows great entertainment, and with a tad of humor too. But, there was a lot of horrific violence. Too much graphic violence. And although the over the top graphic violence is reserved for the bad and unlikable characters there is too much. The extreme church scene makes you wonder if the director has some desire to massacre those he disapproves of. Does he see these lives as meaningless or enjoy seeing them all murdered? And the gentlemanly characters are tarnished with the vulgar language. There is also a cheap shot at Republicans when one character says that he is a Republican so he is ok with global mass murder. Really? Otherwise, it is a very entertaining movie with a very likable but not to be taken too seriously plot.",1486080000,,969,4.6395348837209305

705824,5,630356027X,"Cleverly written ""spy movie"" with its tongue firmly in its cheek.  Almost as much dark-leaning comedy and social commentary as action, adventure and violence.  Pokes fun (not-so-subtly) at the ""spy movie"" genre itself, at several points in the film.  On a scale between ""classic Bond"" as (1) and ""Tarantino"" as (10), this is about a 7.  Really well-played by the strong cast, with tight editing and very good action sequences.  Not for the easily (perhaps even moderately easily) offended.  Lots of cussing (maybe a bit more than I use IRL, but not gratuitously so IMHO).  Some violent scenes, and some theatrical use of CGI (call it ""decorative"" or ""fun,"" as some violence just is TOO graphic to be shown as it would actually appear in reality).  I would guess that Jarvis Cocker from the band Pulp really likes this film.  A smart and rollicking good time.",1484697600,,858,4.821917808219178

After reading comments in the one and two star reviews, I almost passed on this movie, but decided to read a few comments in the 4 and 5 star reviews, and was persuaded to give Kingsman a chance, and I am very glad that I did!  I rented Kingsman with the intention of watching it once, but now I wish I had brought it for a few dollars more because I would like to watch it again.

I highly recommend Kingsman to adults viewers, but Kingsman is NOT a family friendly movie; there is a great deal of foul language, violence and much too much killing ... in fact slaughtering people is the theme of this movie, but if you can get over that, the storyline is unbelievably thrilling from beginning to end.

computer-chip controlled machines including human being.  Funny and Entertaining.  Personally, I don't like the overflowing foul language part.
A ""R"" rating is justified.  Now, the plot.  Eggsy is a British young man with no aim in life.  He lives with his mom and drunken step-father. Everyday, he wanders in street and meets so-called neighbors in a pub / bar.  His deceased father's friend, HH once gave him a neck-chain medal and a telephone number.  One day, Eggsy is caught as car-thief and he needs a bail.  For the first time, he called that telephone number for help.  A change for his entire life since then.
HH is actually a British spy in a secret operation, Kingsman.  He tells Eggsy two things: 1) Eggsy's deceased father has once saved his life.
2) He wants Eggsy to follow his father's track by joining the secret service operation.  With nothing to lose, Eggsy immediately accepts this invitation.  An intensive training is mandatory.  Only one out of six participants will be confirmed.  Eggsy fails in his final test for not shooting to death his companion dog.  The winner is young lady.  Not long after, HH is found dead. (How?  See this movie).  Eggsy is then called back to help solve this terrorism.
Kingsman has been investigating and linking three events: 1) Dead agent.  2) Kidnapped professor.  3) RV, a weird billionaire.  Assisted with high technology, Eggsy enters and eliminates this RV's evil empire for a better world.  (How?  See this movie).  Like every James Bond's movie, our hero Eggsy mingles with a rescued lady.  Oh, she is caught bottomless (not frontal) and this movie ends here.",1483056000,,1768,4.848993288590604

707074,2,630356027X,"Ordered it before I saw it, saw it with someone and now want to return it. It had promise. One issue is that there were wa-ay too many F bombs in this film. Not a fan of them anyway but it was almost as if the writers were trying to reach a certain number of them or something because they were in unneccessarily. That aside, I found the movie a curious mix of genres and storylines. It was like Bond Quantum of Solace's storyline where the bad guy uses concern for the planet as a cover for other endeavors, like XXX in the use of biotechnology on people as a means to an end with an egomaniac who thinks he can rule the world, like 8 Mile or any number of movies in the loss of a father figure and a mom who gets with anyone to make it though there are consequences on mostly the son and herself. There are many more parallels I could draw but the point is that in spite of a relatively good lead cast, I felt bits and pieces were redundant storylines to other films but curiously mixed, and the film didn't come together in a way that left me satisfied as a moviewatcher. Some potential storylines could have been explored more to add depth and humanity or triumph but werent. The way a main character died was unsatisfying, the presence of a seemingly smart princess who refuses to give in to pressure only to later resort to throwing herself at a younger man while still in her prison cell when said young man just literally came into his manhood, the adoption of a lisp for Samuel L Jackson's character that has no point, all just added to my wish that the movie had offered more substance and a smoother delivery. Like I said, I wanted to like it and the movie had promise. Unfortunately it didn't live up to hype.",1482796800,2,1721,4.26605504587156

708735,1,630356027X,"This film breaks down the fabric of morality by attempting to present scenarios that are plausible, however, here is a highlight of what's in the movie. The only one who officially gets to be a Kingsman is a girl who has to be coddled into each testing situation that they all must pass. Next she becomes the victor because she's the only one who can kill a puppy on command, which shows how little importance there is in society of a women's role as a nurturer. Aside from the retarded amount of killing, brought to an artistic level of idiocy, the highlight of the film is the hero of the film sodomizing a beautiful princess. I only wish I could rate this with a negative star.

The movie was good but there were some stereotypical portrayals of criminals. The Middle Easterners were only portrayed as criminals.

Action scenes are well done and there are a couple of very laughable moments. Like I mentioned a few gaps in the timeline (maybe left out for time sake) in the admission to end of training seem to make you think that all of them were extremely well trained before they got there which is unlikely but does speed the training time (as noted by the dogs as puppies to almost adult at the finish of training) Worth watching.",1475366400,,642,4.358333333333333

The movie shows signs of having class, style, and some really good effects, but erupts with classless senseless violence before the end of the movie.  The only thing that saved the rating above a 5 was it had a good ending with good closure.  This movie could have been sensational, but unfortunately turned into nothing more than one of those chain saw horror films on steroids.  If you like that sort of film, this movie is for you.

This is, to me, the perfect summation of the tone of this movie. Not only is it a clever observation, but it puts Kingsman's influences on front-street. However, despite being an excellent parody/style pastiche of the spy genre, Kingsman also manages to be genuinely compelling and, perhaps most importantly, extremely badass.

It reminds me of watching the old school Schwarzenegger movies - you know, the ones where you  sit and try to count all the people that get killed.

711503,5,630356027X,"Kingsman was on my To-Watch List and I've finally seen it. I wish people were more convincing in getting others to watch this because this movie was so darn FUN!

I review this with a huge smile on my face as I just finished watching. I came into this movie expecting something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Smart/dp/B001XUW0TU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Smart</a>: a lot of spy with a lot of comedy. I was totally wrong in my expectations and was completely blown away.

 THE INGREDIENTS 
Kingsman is the perfection of the formula you want in a spy action movie: amazing action sequences, mesmerizing long takes, sexy lead characters, just enough British quirks and humor (without being a comedy), a villain with a diabolical plan, and a third act that will leave your jaws open with a smile at the endand leaving you wanting more.

 THE VILLIANS 
Samuel L. Jackson plays an unconventional villain who's trying to save the world in a way that only a villain would. But one of the highlights of this movie is his sidekick, the legless assassin, Gazelle (I see a very bright future for this actress). Instead of feet, she has prosthetics that happen to be highly lethal blades. And the fight at the end between the Hero and the Sidekick Villain nearlynearlyrivals that of Gogo Yubari and The Bride (of Kill Bill). You're breathless throughout this fight.

 THE HEROS 
We start with a, I believe the term is ""Chav"" (a working class individual who displays brash behavior), who's our main character. Of course, he happens to have a particular history with the Kingsman and gets recruited. What follows is a journey for him and his peer candidates. You will see lots of various physical and mental tests that challenge these trainees to see if they have what it takes, and some of these challenges get really brutal. This is Rated R, ya know.

 RATED R 
It's Rated R for a very good reason: it's so damn bloody and doesn't hold back. Imagine if Bond was Rated R, this is what you would get. Real life spy adventures are not PG-13. People get killed, blood gets spilled. Some of it is a bit gratuitous but never enough where I had to look away. You must be comfortable with blood if you're watching this.

 SUMMARY 
If you enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kick-Ass/dp/B003TOMAPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kick-Ass</a>&nbsp;(same director), if you love Bond, and if want an entertaining movie experience, you will LOVE Kingsman.

711504,4,630356027X,This was an excellent action movie from beginning to end with a good storyline. I gave it only 4 stars because the language was brutal and unecessary a great deal of the time. Not one to let the kiddos watch for sure.,1471392000,,217,4.190476190476191

The idea that a head of state would 'reward' her rescuer with anal sex in order to be rescued rather than left behind played into every gendered trope there is about women, power, and sexuality.

However, were it not for a perverted form of humor at the end of the movie, I'd likely give four stars rather than one.  I don't see the objectification of women through anal sex as good.  It would have been good if the princess simply offered a kiss for saving the world.  Rather, the last scene, pornographic, injuring the dignity of women, highlighting the injustice of sexual immorality, really ruined the movie for me.

Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness. --Romans 6:13

Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body. --1 Corinthians 6:18

When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. --1 Cornithians 13:11

Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.  --1 Corinthians 6:20",1464048000,,1303,4.51063829787234

716732,5,630356027X,"This is a movie that tries to explain an organization that works outside of government.  Three things to remember in this movie.  1.) Although it is an action movie it is also a bit of a dark comedy.  They don't expect you to take it seriously and many parts will be over the top as they poke fun at much of the groups portrayed.  In fact a number of things are fake on purpose, but you have to pay attention when maybe they talk about wine or music.  Much of the comedy is hidden in innuendo's and references that are made throughout the film.  Some parts are predictable and others take you on blindsided.  No political branch of any country is exempt from being poked fun at.  Fight scenes are a bit drawn out, but it's to get you to feel anxious about the outcome they are trying to prevent, or are they?  Guess you'll have to find out.  Overall very enjoyable, not for the pre-teen set as there is a lot of fighting, bullets and a bit of james bond esque female show at the end.",1463529600,,983,4.208556149732621

717213,4,630356027X,"Sometimes you can just tell when actors are having a blast making a movie.  The action is far-fetched and non-stop, and the story is so over the top your eyes tend to fog over, but there's no question the actors are having fun.  So when you get normally somber, dead serious actors like Colin Firth, Mark Strong, and Samuel L. Jackson letting their professional hair down in a romp for the ages, you get a terrifically fun movie like KINGSMAN:  THE SECRET SERVICE.  Based on a comic book I know zilch about, this is the story of a secret UK spy organization that takes on the world's nastiest villains.  To keep the Kingsman going, they must continue to recruit new members--yet the training process can be literally life-threatening.  A new class of recruits--including ""Eggsy"", a chip-on-his-shoulder street brawler (played enthusiastically by Taron Egerton)--must pass the ultimate test before the winner of the training competition gets his tailored suit and becomes a member of the ultimate spy class. . .only to have to take on Valentine (Jackson, who is a hoot), a technological mastermind about to take over the world via a special smart phone app.

Again, this movie is way over the top--but in the most fun way imaginable.  Firth is wonderful as Harry Hart, the Kingsman's ace super sleuth who recruits Eggsy; there is a scene in a crowded church where Firth's character does some eye-popping carnage not to be missed.  And the recruits are trained by Merlin (Strong) a by-the-book secret agent who puts his charges to the test, whether it's flooding their sleeping chamber, or announcing--while the recruits are freefalling through the air--that one of them has no parachute.  All of it darn good fun.  The showdown is lame pizza supreme but terrific nonetheless, showcased by Eggsy taking on Valentine's assassin (the gorgeous Sofia Boutella), who happens to be wearing the world's deadliest stilettos.  The conclusion is open-ended, suggesting a sequel may be in the works, which is fine with this reviewer; KINGSMAN:  THE SECRET SERVICE is way too fun to be enjoyed in a single dose.

717847,5,630356027X,"What can I say about this movie? It's amazing!
I rented this expecting another humdrum, run-of-the-mill spy movie, and what I got was SO MUCH MORE!
What makes this movie great is that it not only has cool spy movie action (and believe me, it definitely has that), but it also tackles current events. Domestic abuse, climate change, hateful cults, the 1%, it has it all.
And that's what takes Kingsman to the next level. On the surface it appears to be just another spy action flick, but it's much more sophisticated and raises some hard questions about our society, like how people with good intentions sometimes do horrible things, or how those we trust to protect us from psychopaths can be corrupted by those same psychopaths.

718107,5,630356027X,"this was a film I was initially somewhat reluctant to see.

Not being a fan of a lot of digitized effects, some of the visual flash I saw in the trailer was a turn off. Like my action done for real, with in camera effects and stuntmen. But several associates -all of whom I respect- recommended it, It was on HBO, and luckily in it's original 2:35 to 1 aspect ratio.

Meaning 'widescreen', of course.

When I decided to watch it I was immediately struck by how well it was directed. And as you watched it how well it was acted.

Then the strength of the narrative, which never lagged, kept you going. What I enjoyed the most, however came upon repeated viewings.

The heart, and moral center of the film is just, well, terrific. Making an 'R' rated actioner with broad appeal across the charts was an accomplishment
in and of itself. But addressing the core issues of home, family, honor, courage and commitment was an unexpected treat.

As was one of the quotes, which is commonly mistaken to be by Hemingway but is most likely Indian in origin:

'There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man. The nobility is being superior to your former self'.

The film is rich in character, and the performances -particularly Colin Firth and newcomer Taron Egerton are just first rate. Even the
overexposed Samuel L Jackson finds fresh turf in his performance as the mega villain.

The production design is first rate. The music score, called a 'loving tribute to (Bond composer) John Barry is also excellent.

In short, I was knocked out by how good this film is...",1461542400,5,1570,4.594982078853047

718777,3,630356027X,"""Kingsman"" is not only a story about a young lad being trained in an ultra-secret service agency similar to Mi6 of the James Bond universe. Kingsman is also about satirizing Bond and other similar action fair. Other films are directly or indirectly referenced in ""Kingsman"", sometimes to good effect, other times with mixed results. So is the film about its story/plot or its references to other cinematic shoot-em-up films of similar ilk? Rather depends upon how you view it. For my money, the endless references to action cinema did become a bit overdone.

""Kingsman"" incorporates two plots which become intertwined by the end. The first, and most interesting, is the training of a youth on the eve of adulthood. ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) is the son of a Kingsman who sacrificed himself to save his colleagues on his mission when his son was only a toddler. One of the operatives, code named Galahad (Colin Firth) gives the toddler a medallion. The late father was code named Lancelot. The film then fast-forwards many years later and now Eggsy is near adulthood but not very mature. He encounters Galahad who offers him a spot in a program with other recruits designed to train future kingsmen, in particular to fill the vacant spot of Lancelot. The training program I thought was the strongest part of the film as the coaches/trainers use no-win scenarios to challenge their recruits into finding creative solutions.

The other story involves a billionaire, Richmond Valentine (Samuel Jackson), who has some strange ideas about defeating global warming. He makes endless speeches to both audiences and individuals with a lisp. Also in Jackson's service, as either an employee or slave, is Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) who sports razor sharp blades in place of normal feet. I started to guess when she appeared in scenes without Jackson, an extra or three was going to encounter the business end of Gazelle's ""shoes"".

Underneath Valentine's seemingly innocent philanthropy in which he offers free internet and cell phone service through his network is a calculated plan to eradicate global warming. Trouble is, the plan involves causing people to engage in Godzilla-like violent behavior. He also implants computer chips into peoples' necks in which they become mindless minions in service to Valentine. Eventually, we see a demonstration of Valentine's plot in action when he decides to off the congregation of a church of far-right congregants in Kentucky who make Mussolini and Stalin look pretty democratic. The violence in the church was so over-the-top and grotesque, I found I was not enjoying it and wanted to fast-forward out of the scene.

While I definitely liked the youth's introduction to Kingsman through Galahad, and I thought Jackson made a good baddie, the endless references to Bond-like cinema I thought was overkill. Not only are Bond films and ""Trading Places"" referenced, but there's parallel's with ""2012"" and there's even an indirect wink to the film ""Pulp Fiction"", which also starred Jackson. Also, the combat scenes were gratuitously violent for no apparent reason. This film is billed as an action-comedy, but I didn't find myself laughing when people's limbs were chopped off. When either Galahad or Gazelle rip into their victims, they literally come apart at the seams.

By the end of ""Kingsman"", I wasn't sure what I had seen. Was this a comedy? Kind of. A spoof? Maybe. An homage to action cinema a la the 1960's variety? I guess so. At one point Jackson and Firth talk about those films from their youth, and Jackson even says ""It's not that kind of a movie"". And I think I had to agree. I wasn't sure what kind of movie this was in the first place, and I was still confused by the end.",1459641600,,3725,4.972712680577849

For a couple of days afterward, I would see it by the TV and turn to Andrew to say, That was actually such a good movie. For me, it had everything: great acting, a solid story line with a few twists that were unexpected for the most part, and lovely cinematography. My favorite part about comic books turned movies are those beautiful shots that are reminiscent of a comic panel, and Kingsman certainly used those to its advantage, along with heavily stylized fight scenes. I at first thought that the fight scenes were going to bother me, since Im incredibly squeamish about blood and gore, but I found that it was done in such a way that it really was like reading a comic, and I didn't have to turn away when things turned violent which is rare for me.

In terms of story itself, its wonderful. The movie makes me want to read the comics, because I fell in love with characters. The villain is a hilarious foil to the agents, and I hope hes portrayed as well in the comics.",1458518400,,1128,4.3971291866028706

The movie is James Bond and Japanese anime meet R Lee Ermey's watermelon shattering gun collection as used by ""the Joker.""  There is just something gross, and well, reassuring when you see heads pop off of world leaders.  Especially when they think they are giving the shaft to all of us ""little"" people.

721310,2,630356027X,"Kingsman-Secret Service(released Dec/14) stars,among others,Colin Firth,Samuel L. Jackson,Mark Strong,Taron Egerton, Sophie Cookson and Michael Caine. The film has all the slam bam,thank you mam action that one could ever ask for in an action film. However I just couldn't dig it. Why? Let's see.
The story is about the Kingsman,a special secret branch of the British government who fight those who would do the free world harm. The film opens 17 years before the present as one of its top agents gets killed. Firth who runs the day to day operations attends the home of his deceased agent and presents his wife with a special Kingsman medallion. She is grief stricken and rebuffs his gift. Instead he bestows it on her young son. On the medallion is a phone number and Firth tells them if they are ever in trouble to call it and repeat a special word code to the operator.
17 years later and the son(Eggerton) is grown up. His mother has married an abusive man and Eggerton is somewhat of a loose canon,and with a chip on his shoulder. He gets arrested and decides to call the medallion number. Firth comes poste haste and he is released. In fact Firth recruits him to join the secret service,along with several other candidates. They meet the head of the organization,Caine.
After a grueling months long training the candidates are whittled down to Cookson and Eggerton. Their immediate mission,as circumstances have moved along throughout the film dictate,is the take down of one Mr. Valentine(Jackson).He is a genius who has gone more than a little off kilter. What has been happening is that he is introducing free internet,free phone calls and phones to the world. However every phone has a sound trigger. When activated the sound causes people to go berserk and kill every person they see. He also has contacted hundreds of heads of states to convert them over to this forced""culling"" of the Earth population. Those he converts will be present and accounted for as they watch the world go to hell in Jackson's remote mountain lair. Each person has a tracking pellet implanted in their head. Those people he cannot convert he imprisons.
Jackson tests his sound trigger out on a church congregation,at which Firth attends by invite. When it goes off Firth becomes unable to stop himself from annihilating a good number of the worshipers, before they can kill themselves. Outside the church afterwards Firth and Jackson meet. Jackson unceremoniously puts a bullet through Firths head.
Eggerton and Cookson have their work cut out for themselves. Eggerton gets a lift via jet to the mountain lair,while Cookson sits on a chair lifted to the stratosphere by two large balloons. On board is a missile,which is intended to take out Jackson's own satellite before he can use it to send the deadly signals through the phones. Eggerton becomes of age as an agent as he infiltrates the lair,his skills at their keenest level. Just as Jackson sends out his signal the satellite goes out. However he switches over to another, but must keep console contact in order to keep the signal going. Ultimately Eggerton succeeds in taking down Jackson and stopping world carnage.
The movie moves along quite swiftly and between the S/FX and groove enchanced music,it has a rhythm all its own. The action is fast paced when it comes,and it comes often. All involved did a fine job with their parts....so why do I NOT like this film? It hit me at a gut level,the wrong way. The film moves constantly back and forth between a serious Secret Service and a cartoonish one. Cartoonish in the sense of the incredible stunts no ordinary man could do,such as super high flying kicks and rolls and the super fast fighting pace they display. Then there is Jackson's character. He looks just plain strange/silly and that lisp affectation is a no go right from the start. Then we have the piece' de resistance when the high profile converts and guards get their heads blown up in a spectacular colour light show. All mushroom straight up. The accompanying music just makes it all seem strangely bizarre but funny. These examples and others took away from my enjoyment of it.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:39:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all this film was a real disappointment. The makers tried their darnedest and made a sophisticated effort. However it became a mish mash of a rollercoaster ride,one minute serious,the next comic. I think it tried to walk the fine line between both but it failed. Given the story line and content it was like watching James Bond on speed. Sean Connery could get down and dirty when circumstances called for it, but he also could have lighter moments,but you knew it was all grounded in a serious dynamic. This film's lighter moments go so far over the top that it loses its grounding. 2 1/2-3 stars.",1454544000,,4855,4.801672640382318

I took the opportunity to use some of my Prime no rush credits to watch this movie on/through an old Samsung C - HTIB and the streaming was flawless.  There is a lot of action and fast moving scenes and I don't remember any pixelation or buffering issues at all.

It's quite enjoyable to see the otherwise cast often earlier in Romantic or stoic ""British"" Aristocratic character roles Colin Firth as an action super hero.  It was very believable and he acquitted himself very well in the role.  It reminded me a bit of the spry Sean Connery in the Presidio - and his Thumb attacks (ROFL @ that memory) and of the many scenes of great work in this film.

Here's hoping for at least a sequel!!",1453680000,,721,4.383458646616542

The kid does a good job with the script but I can't say his character is a scene stealer and he plays the ""chip on the shoulder"" card a bit too much.  Firth is the heart of the movie but I don't know that they intended him to be the way it moves along...if they had focused on Firth and changed a few points, then we could have had a fun series of films for those that don't want the angst of Bourne or the drama of Bond.  Kill an entire room of people (don't want to spoil so no details) and you are more worried about what led to it than the blood on your hands.  That's good stuff but as I said...it goes missing.  Jackson was a character that I wanted to like, he was funny, sort of complex and it was a take on a villain that i had never seen before which was great.  In the end, it seemed that the parody was larger than the character and it fell flat during the most climactic scene.  I would recommend it for a fun movie with friends or to rent, not sure it would make my list of must have movies but I'll definitely watch it again.",1452988800,3,1200,3.970833333333333

Everything except the marketing MORON at the company that decided to put the special features only on the Blue Ray package and/or that the BlueRay package didn't include a normal dvd copy of the move at the same time with the special features!!!!!  WHAT WERE YOU THINKING??????

My attitude on this is hampered by the fact that Wal-Mart refused to accept me returning the purchase, even though I had the receipt. (I had taken the shrink off before noticing that the package didn't have a dvd copy, since there was a sticker over the box front at that critical point!!!!!  Thanks factory!!!!  (It's all A-OK though - I will get a BR player someday before too much longer, and this taught me to not buy any media at W/M anymore. That'll teach'em! hehe)

But the movie is a lot of fun and SLJ is most-excellent as always! His affected speech for the movie is lots of fun to hear, and as far as a James Bond-styled movie, this was a LOT more fun and engaging than any Bond film I have seen in the last 15 years. The plot moves quickly and the pacing of the movie is great. No real down moments or boring bits. SLJ's main henchwoman is a lot of fun and she is DEADLY with those blade legs!!

Their movies (for the most part) have action and drama, but also a clever and charming feeling to them that just obliterates their competition in what you expect vs what you get. I have thoroughly enjoyed Stardust, I have loved Kick Ass, and Kingsman is on the same level of sheer awesome and charming (albeit a bit crass) that I have come to expect from MARV. KUDOS to this company for coming up with a film that has unforgettable charm, and unforgettable scenes that will be engraved in my memory for years to come.

After the first 25 F-words, the dialog went from being annoying to boring.  By the time the word was used more than 50 times, it was too disappointing to enjoy.  Think how easy that was for the screen writers.  Excitement = F-word, celebration = F-word, anger = F-word, threat = F-word, casual conversation = F-word, fear = F-word repeated over and over, etc.  Oh, maybe they didn't use writers, just a computer that inserted the word multiple times in every scene.  B-O-R-I-N-G.  And the killing was really odd with a high creep value.  Killing scores of people in detail was really over-kill in so many ways.  I thought the movie would be smart and fun. and it was really close to working, but it didn't work for me.  What a waste of a good cast, and promising story.",1450569600,,912,4.433734939759036

Michael Caine should be contracted for every motion picture made even as a walk on. Classic and Classy. I've watched 3 times and I'm still laughing out loud and wide eyed by the incredible action. Samuel Jackson is there too as the quirky, almost lovable villain. Only criticism is it's a tad too long- a bit too many James Bond routines rolled together the last 30 minutes. But I still love it, script to acting directing special effects and soundtrack. What a pleasant surprise, hoping for a sequel with Firth as a hologram via Star Trek. Throw in a few bits of Peter Sellers and a great script.",1450224000,,695,4.612903225806452
722739,3,630356027X,"Released in early 2015, Kingsman: The Secret Service stars Taron Egerton as Eggsy, a recruit for super-secret spy organization headquartered in England run by characters played by Michael Caine, Colin Firth and Mark Strong. The semi-comical villain is played by Samuel L. Jackson who, with his assistant with lethal artificial legs (Sofia Boutella), seeks to save the earth by wiping out the majority of the population. Samantha Womack and Sophie Cookson are on hand as Eggsys mother and fellow recruit respectively while Hanna Alstrm plays a Swedish princess.

Based on the 2012 comic series The Secret Service, Kingsman basically meshes the X-Men with James Bond, adding its own creative, quirky approach. Theres a lot of over-the-top and unbelievable action, but it is based on a comic, after all. The movies eccentric and generally entertaining but marred by fluent F-bombs throughout and an unnecessarily vulgar scene, which tries to be funny (and almost is). (Keep in mind that I almost never comment on cussing in a movie unless its so overdone its distracting). If you like the X-Men or James Bond youll want to check Kingsman out, but its not as good IMHO. The cast is great though and it is amusing; Im sure the sequels will improve upon the foundation.

The film runs 129 minutes and was shot in England, Toronto and Sydney, Australia.

Now, I'm not a prude. If that's your thing, well, good for you. But it's not mine.
I also get that they were trying to evoke the end of every Bond film, where James collects his reward.
But, really?
They could have gone with 'We can do it any way you want to', or left it 100% implied, like the Bond movies.

Then suddenly this movie turned into a horror movie, lots and lots and . . . . lots of violence!!  More then I was prepared for that day.  I can handle violence - but this movie violence had an ""indifferent"" overtone to it while they were cracking jokes with it (somewhat like pulp fiction, but this was not a drama).  It DID NOT sit well with me.  (Plus seeing my romantic star that I love and adore be this violent guy - boo hoo for me, just my opinion - I'm sure no one will agree with me, ha ha).  I really don't care who likes my opinion - this review is for the person who can't always take no nonsense violence paired comedy.  Just giving them a heads up, or be prepared so you're not caught off guard, maybe your experience will be better.

Sometimes a movie has enough going for it that I will overlook its bad parts, but this one doesn't really offer up anything new except an unfortunate scene at the very end that involves possible anal sex. It feels like it was tacked on last minute, and it actually makes the film seem grotesque instead of kind of fun or edgy.

This is a clever action/comedy with awesome characters and a startling lack of sexism. I'd honestly say that most of the female characters are stronger than the male characters.

I know he's done a lot of other stuff, but nothing has ever caught my attention from him before.  But, man, was he cool in this.  Best part of this is the church scene.  It filmed so well, I had to rewatch it!  Sam Jackson is Sam Jackson, you either hate him or you love him.  Girl with the scissor legs is kind of gimmick-y but it didn't bother me so much.

Otherwise I could watch this over and over again, it had such great live action and bantering going on.  I really enjoyed Colin Firth and Taron Egerton's coupling, it works so well on a Miyagi/Daniel level.  Samuel L. Jackson played a great sociopath, almost too well at times.

The soundtrack is wonderful, the characters are fantastic and at times almost caricature-like (not in a negative way). The violence factor was surprising but totally fit the tone of the film. All in all, an odd surprise. I was shocked at how much I liked it after seeing it. At first, after seeing the trailers, I thought to myself, ""Oh no, Colin what are you doing. This looks like a cheesy James Bond film."" YUP. It IS but in the best way possible! It's created in a way that gives an hommage to Bond and Fleming yet is completely different from them at the same time, totally its own film (is that even possible?!) Apparently.

Overall this was a really entertaining and enjoyable movie. The only part I really disliked was the last few moments, as I found it rather distasteful, but that's just me.

726884,5,630356027X,"Why it took my so long to write about this one is beyond me. The only honest answer I can give is the deluge of other items Ive been watching and writing about that have preoccupied me. It certainly wasn't that the film was bad, far from it. Recent news is that a sequel is in the works and thats something I cant wait to see if it holds up to this one.

The film opens with a secret agent ops in the works that results in one member of the team killed. The agent who feels responsible, Harry Hart aka Galahad (Colin Firth), stops by to pay his respect to the mans widow and leaves behind a medallion that has a number he tells her to call anytime there is a need. Fast forward to years later and the widow has taken up with a local thug, has a young child by him and the aforementioned deceased heros son has grown and hangs with the wrong crowd.

Gary Eggsy Unwin (Taron Egerton) is heading down the wrong path. With no love lost for his surrogate father and wishing he could do more for his mother he instead finds himself doing all he can to insult and anger said surrogate. His latest ends him in jail and with no one to turn to he calls the number on the back of the medallion. Harry shows and makes him an offer. He wants Eggsy to become the next member of the Kingsmen. But he must prove himself first.

Harry explains to Eggsy that the Kingsmen are a secret organization formed centuries ago that operates outside of the mainstream, untied to any government of political system. Instead their goal is to protect mankind in general. Past members have all come from high placed members of society. That is until Eggsys father. He was an experiment to quote the head of the organization Arthur (Michael Caine), an experiment begun by Harry himself. Now he wants to continue that with Eggsy, someone he feels is worthy of becoming the next knight.

With only one spot in the group open to join Eggsy finds himself in a boot camp of sorts with fellow applicants. Some welcome him like any other while the snobbish ones look down on him, a big mistake on their part. What most don't realize is Eggsys past, not just who his father was but his intelligence and the fact he served in the military. As members are booted out, it comes down to two final applicants and it is Eggsys humanity that forces him to lose.

While all of this is going on there is a megalomaniacal madman on the loose. Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) plays a lisping billionaire who has plans on taking over the world. It was his doing that opened up the position Eggsy was applying for when he killed on of the Kingsmen. Using advanced technology, Valentine has sent out free cell phones to anyone who wants one which of course means everyone. What he can do with those phones once they're in the hands of the world is something else. A final confrontation between good guys and bad must take place and of course circumstances arise that force Eggsy to be taken back in to become a member of Kingsmen.

What makes this movie work is the deft combination of humor, adventure, action and over the top madness that make it one of the best movies to come out this year. Weaving together the aristocratic world of the Kingsmen with the low class neighborhood that raised Eggsy pays off, adding a depth of character that needs less exposition as we witness both his possibilities and his capabilities. Egerton makes the character sympathetic and likeable that plays both on his world weariness and innocence in the same person. Its one of the things that makes the movie work best.

The three other major components that make the movie work begin with Colin Firth as Harry. Firth might be well known of his role in THE KINGS SPEECH but who would have expected him to carry off a role as a superspy who possibly exceeds James Bond? Alongside Firth is Mark Strong as Merlin, the armaments and tech support member of the team. Having gone through a string of roles where he plays the bad guy, Strong does an amazing job of being straight faced where a quick laugh is possible. Lastly are the effects laden weapons we see on display here, much like those of Bond in the characters numerous films. Everything from exploding cigarette lighters to bulletproof umbrellas make the arsenal of each Kingsman ready for anything.

As with Bond films the movie plays fast and loose with logistics and time zones and feels more like it was made for fun the fact. It delivers on the promise of that fun with some of the funniest moments alongside some of the most breath taking. By the end of the movie youll want to start it up and watch it again. Youll also wish that the sequel were already there ready to be viewed. For me, it is a wonderful pleasure that Ive added to my collection and one I know Ill pull out more often than not to watch and enjoy again.",1445904000,,4811,4.422121896162528

727915,5,630356027X,"Great British actors, great action, great bad guys...this action-adventure spy movie has it all.  Yes, I love the Bond movies (especially now with Daniel Craig), but Kingsman reminded me of the good old days from the 60's when the Bond movies first came out and there were bits of sly humor mixed in with the action, plus really out-there villains.  This movie gives us that, including the girl sidekick who really can kick (and kill) with her bladed legs.

LOVED Colin Firth's character with his smart comments and attitude and the scenes where he fights are incredible to watch.  Best bit ever when he comments to a narrow-minded women in the church...I laughed out loud and then had to re-wind and watch that bit again.  I also loved the (too-short) appearance of Jack Davenport as ""Lancelot.""  All of the Kingsman characters are named after Arthurian legend and they fight the bad guys in their perfect suits with hardly a hair out of place.

The story revolves around the son (nicknamed Eggsy) of a man who dies in undergoing the Kingsman training who is then tapped himself as a would-be recruit by Galahad (Colin Firth).  He comes from a poor background where his mother is involved with a drunken thug and really has nowhere to go and a bit of an attitude issue, understandably.  Still, he wins through (of course) under the mentorship of Colin Firth's character, ""Galahad.""  This is actually one of the small flaws in the movie, that this character just wasn't quite as compelling as the others involved and I'm not sure if that was due to the script or the actor who was chosen.  It would be hard to shine as a young actor with such prestigious older actors.  Still, he did a good job and I was rooting for him, once he joined the other Kingsman agents in this perfect suit and glasses, when he was called upon to defeat the bad guy out to destroy almost everyone on the planet.

In general, this movie was really well done, the fight scenes were worthy of the Matrix nearly, and worth watching, especially if you enjoy British secret agent movies with all the smart remarks, fancy cool gadgetry, and cool calm reserve in the face of final countdowns and the end-of-the-world as we know it.",1445299200,,2200,4.639175257731959

My wife and I sat down to watch Kingsman and really didn't know what to expect but in the end really enjoyed this movie.

Kingsman is a Spy Thriller and in some ways a Parody of Bond films with a twist of Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' thrown in for fun.

The plot is typical Spy Movie thriller with your over the top Villain 'Valentine' (played by Samuel L. Jackson) wanting to dominate the world along with his henchwoman 'Gazelle' (Played by Sofia Boutella) who reminded me of the character Jaws in the Bond Films 'The Spy Who Loved Me' and 'Moonraker'.

Kingsman, like Bond, is filled with cool spy gadgets, weapons and technology. Some of the soundtrack even sounds like a Bond film.

While my wife and I enjoyed Kingsman, there are two things we didn't really enjoy
1 - Samuel L. Jackson's speech impediment. Did Valentine really need to speak with a lisp?
2 - Over the top Gratuitous Violence. Most of this movie could be watched by the whole family if the Violence was toned down a little. Kingsman does attempt to handle some of the most violent scenes in a comedic way (ie Austin Powers).

Overall Kingsman is a fun, entertaining movie for adults but just not for the kids.",1444521600,,1211,4.532110091743119

We watch the selection process while all the time keeping an eye out for bad guys and nasty deeds.

This is why kids are taking guns and killing other people--because they are exposed to a culture of violence on the screen that seems to get worse with each movie. Game of Thrones is a walk in the park compared to this unbelievably bad movie.  There are two sequences in particular when hundreds of people die, a sequence where human head after human head explodes for our entertainment value.

Also, there is the subplot of the 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 young people all vying for the slot of the next Kingsman. Isn't it interesting that ALL OF THEM ARE WHITE????  Holy Crap, it's 2015, but you wouldn't know it from this movie.

If they set him or her up as horn dogs or kinky even slightly it would have worked better.

Samuel L Jackson's character was pretty weird but endearingly evil and funny at the same time.  You'll have to see it for yourself, and I highly recommend you take the time to do so.

The main character was just okay, though it's probably hard to hold your own against the likes of Colin Firth, Michael Caine, and Mark Strong (who played a different character than I'm used to but I always like him.)

By the way, all the women in here sucked. There weren't many and they had crap roles. Apparently even a woman tough enough to get into Kingsman training has to spend the whole movie quivering in her boots, being rescued, and being, at best, only marginally effective in her job.

Samuel Jackson phoned it in and his (female) sidekick was a cardboard cut out.

Hyper gore I've got no problem with in a comic book movie. I loved the church scene. The ending, though, was too hard to believe even by comic book standards and out-of-the-blue troglodyte sexist ending was really jarring in it's incongruity and vulgarity. It's like the last 20 minutes of the film had been handed to a 12 year old boy to direct.

731569,5,630356027X,"My son and I were talking movies the other day, and at one point we agreed that the James Bond films of late have sadly strayed so very far from their solid roots.  Particularly since Daniel Craig has donned the tuxedo of the once debonaire 007.  No offense to Craig as an actor, but in the role of Bond he seems very off the mark.  Craigs  is a dry, brooding, angy, and persistently serious portrayal, with none of the suave cockiness of Lazenby, Connery or Brosnon.  And the antagonists presented to us are neither creatively bad nor made humorously over the top, but rather cookie cutter dull.  To be fair, it is equally the fault of depressingly dramatic writers and directors of late as well.

The older Bond films clicked.  They were action and spy adventure, but never took themselves too seriously.  And there were the cliche moments in each that characterize Bond:  gadgets with Q, flirting with Money-Penny, surviving a series of preposterously dangerous moments with flair, dealing with a farcical bad guy who, admit it, had the coolest evil lair, and the end curtain falling on our man Bond smooching with the alluring siren of the film.

So where do we find a film that harkens to the Bond of oldI say that Kingsman: The Secret Service hits the target squarely.  Kingsman draws heavily on the tried, true, and beloved genre classics like the playful The Avengers TV series from the late 60s, Our Man Flit of 1967, Dujardins OSS:117, and of course Connerys Bond.

Colin Firth and Taron Egerton put in superb performances that reignite the lightness and action of the classic campy spy flick; the proper English gentleman spy, who looks good in a suit while dealing with a hundred armed foes.  Samuel Jackson plays the ultra extreme bad guy environmentalist (sadly an over the top cliche that nowadays hinders progress on real climate issues), and Jacksons lispy portrayal creates a cartoon character that jars us out of the fantasy of the story at times.  Even Michael Cane is a bit of an empty parody of himself in this film.  But Firth and Egerton, along with well done supporting roles from Mark Strong and Sofia Boutella, keep us rooted in the magic of each moment.

Overall, Kingsman is a rewarding and welcome offering.  Mature, refined, while also campy and predictable, it is filled with familiar moments that satisfy as the story and action unfolds.  Kingsman: The Secret Service is what future Bond films should strive to return to.  But until then, enjoy this good flick, an homage to our favorite spy filled movie nights.",1443312000,,2545,4.767123287671233
731570,3,630356027X,"This was a really bad movie.  The only reason why I give it three stars is because the action sequences were actually very interestingly done.  I'm surprised because the actors were awesome, and the script wasn't horrible.  It's just that it made no sense.  I didn't fully get what motivated the characters to  be in the secret society in the first place, nor did I understand some of those scenes in the movie SPOILER ALERT:  One of the main characters shoots up a church filled with bigoted haters because he doesn't like what they stand for.  I mean another superhero movie, like Watchman had some dark moments in the movie, but the script was on point.  You understood what motivated every single character every step of the way.  This one just feels the leave out a lot of stuff.  Therefore it felt a little like a glossy piece of garbage.",1443312000,,844,4.566666666666666

The premise to fight for an open spot at the table for another spot in what seems like an endless list of  British Secret agencies is pretty cool. Add in extreme high tech that is a lot of fun. Some bizarre scenes are inserted. Adding in a insane arch nemesis who is trying to to create Moonraker on earth this has referential points to so many spy movies.

It had some very fun references to other not mentioned spy movies that are out there, again, more cute than distracting or annoying.
There is a scene in the movie where you put a super spy against a lot of normal people and it was everything that I'd dream it would have been. That part though gory, was down right awesome.

Whom ever put it together overly relied on the assumption that it will generate profit based on having three reputable actors.

Action sequences feature that crazy-unrealistic-stylized violence that seems to be all the rage these days. In addition, gory killings are frequent, as are ""f-bombs"". The whole plot makes almost no sense. The evildoer's plans aren't the kind of thing any real people would consent to (though quite a few movie characters do). The protagonist doesn't even end up with the ""right"" love interest.

One star off for excessive violence - Yes, it's a spy movie, in that genre people inevitably get killed all over the place. That's par for the course, no objection here. BUT there is an *extended* sequence of wholesale slaughter in a ""church"" that would make Sam Peckinpah gag. The victims are nasty people, and a scene of this sort was necessary as an illustration of what would happen if the villain wasn't stopped, but the editor let this run on and on and ON and ON to the point that takes one out of the story, seems creepily to assume the audience would enjoy the mayhem, and that violent, violent death is somehow AOK if it happens to people with horrible opinions. Unlike the people who were actively participating in the bad guy's genocidal project (killed quickly later in the movie), they were just hateful jerks.  Graphic, realistic, endless - choreographed blood porn, it was a total needle scratch in such an excellent movie.  What does that say?
Maybe it's clear how much this disrupted the flow of the movie when I interrupt a rave for so long to comment on it.  Be warned that's in there, but if you can get past that, it's the best action/gadget/boo megalomaniacal villain/yay good guys/international secret service movie since Classic Connery ruled the screen.",1441843200,5,1443,4.76

The story is quite interesting, the action is imaginative, beautifully brutal, and very plentiful, the cast is nothing short of perfect in their performances, there is a nice orchestral score, and the production design is gorgeous, all smooth surfaces, clean lines, and an abundance of futuristic gadgetry. The film actually has a surprising amount of depth to it, including one scene with the young protagonist ""Eggsy"" that's really incredible. Colin Firth is a very smooth superspy, Taron Egerton is a loveably rogueish, identifiable, and caring hero, Sofia Boutella (actually a dancer) plays a fearsome villainess, and Samuel L. Jackson is at the top of his game again as a threatening and surprisingly hilarious supervillian. This is without a doubt one of my favorite films of all time and one of the best films of the many good ones of 2015.

Kingsman scores reasonably well on a fun factor scale. The performances are fine; the pace is good; the special effects are acceptable. The story is predictable and the absence of dramatic tension makes Kingsman eye candy more than absorbing drama. I don't have any problem with that. It is what it is, and what it is is a solid 4 star movie. It doesn't try to be anything more, which is why it doesn't deserve 5 stars, but if you want to watch entertaining action that won't tax your brain, Kingsman is a good choice.",1441065600,,723,4.561538461538461

This movie has
1) a bit of Get Smart, although its much more intelligent than that (and I loved Get Smart when I was a kid);

With that said, most movies these days seem to betray a lack of science and technology understanding, and this movie was no exception.  There were just too many high-tech cringe moments for me to give it four stars.

[Spoiler alert]

You're probably thinking I'm going to complain about the implants.  Nope.  Those are semi-plausible, though they wouldn't be nearly that tiny.  And the gadgets are a little dubious, but I'm okay with suspension of disbelief.  Where this story went off the rails was in its incorporation of real world tech.

The main plot involved a villain using custom SIM cards to put a sizable percentage of all the world's cell phones onto a special network, and then delivering an auditory signal that makes people go nuts and kill each other.  I'll ignore for the moment the unlikelihood of that being possible (suspension of disbelief again), and I'll ignore the unlikelihood of cell phones being loud enough to do so on such a broad scale.  But I just can't bring myself to ignore the satellites....

The most egregious problem with the satellites was the scene in which they used two weather balloons to lift a girl up high enough to shoot down a satellite with a shoulder-fired missile.  A quick Wikipedia search reveals that the highest altitude ever recorded by a weather balloon was only about 53 km (33 miles).  Another quick Wikipedia search tells you that low Earth orbit starts at about 160 miles (but isn't really usable at such a low altitude).  So in the best-case scenario, the girl would have been trying to aim at a satellite around 110 km (68 miles) above her.  In fact, she'd only be about 2030% closer while hanging under the balloons than she would be if she were standing atop the tallest mountain on the surface of Earth....

Worse, I'm fairly certain it isn't even theoretically possible to build a balloon that could lift a person to low Earth orbit, because the lift capacity of a balloon decreases very rapidly with altitude, falling to almost nothing by the time you get to 30 km or so; the lift from a balloon is caused by the difference in air density between the inside of the balloon and the outside, and when you're that high up, there's very little air at all, so it is very hard for the density inside to be significantly lower than nearly zero.  In fact, the record altitude for a human-flown balloon is only 41 km.  Exceeding that altitude record by a factor of four or five would be bordering on insanity.

Speaking of lift capacity, two weather balloons would have a typical lift capacity of 1020 pounds even at sea level, which isn't enough to lift my backpack, much less an entire person with a giant missile launcher strapped to her back.  She would likely need closer to 30-50 of them just to get off the ground.  Two isn't even in the ballpark.

And even if you could miraculously get a balloon high enough, you would quickly run into an even bigger problem.  Orbital velocity is fast.  Really fast.  That same Wikipedia article on low Earth orbit tells you just how fast.  A satellite at the very bottom of low Earth orbit goes all the way around the planet in approximately 90 minutes (88, to be precise).  That means it goes from the North Pole to the Equator in approximately 22.5 minutes, or from the northern border of the United States (not counting the northeastern states) to the southern border (not counting the tip of Texas) in about 6 1/2 minutes.  In the two minutes or so that it took her to aim the missile, the satellite she was trying to hit would have travelled about 600 miles.  That's somewhere in the neighborhood of 17,000 miles (27,000 km) per hour, or 7.8 km (4.8 miles) per second, for those of you keeping score.

Ignoring the question of whether somebody could aim at a target moving that quickly (even if it were moving almost straight towards you), does anybody know how to build a shoulder-fired missile that can fly at 17,000 MPH (about Mach 50)?  Because if you do, I'm sure NASA would love to talk to you.  :-)

Of course, there is a kind of satellite that doesn't move relative to Earth.  Those are celled geostationary satellites.  Unfortunately, to get to those, you'd need a weather balloon that would lift a person up to 35,786 km (22,236 miles)almost 700x higher than any balloon has ever flown.  Even if it were theoretically possible, building such a balloon would probably require orders of magnitude more hydrogen and helium than exists on our planet, and the balloon would probably start out at hundreds of miles in diameter or more.

Also, if you somehow pulled off such an impossible feat getting her back down without the benefit of gravity pulling on her in any meaningful way would be highly problematic.  After all, the reason those satellites stay up there is that gravity doesn't do much at that distance.  And if you somehow managed to solve those two problems, she'd probably burn up on the way back down.  There's a reason we don't ever attempt to recover satellites from geostationary orbit.  It just isn't practical.  And this is assuming that such a purely theoretical balloon would somehow exhibit enough atmospheric drag to keep you above the same point on Earth on an ongoing basis, effectively accelerating you to about 3 km/s during your ascent, which seems pretty unlikely.

Of course, that's all a moot point, because satellites can't possibly carry a signal to unmodified cell phones in the first place.  Any cell phone that uses SIM cards for voice communication is likely to be using GSM, which has a 35 km (22 mile) range limit that cannot be exceeded without completely redesigning the way that the devices communicate at a fundamental level.  Low Earth orbit satellites orbit starts at 160 km (99 miles).  So even if you could magically convince a satellite to communicate on the right frequency, the time division algorithm in the cell phones would make communication impossible.  Ah, but what about LTE, you might ask?  That has a hard upper limit of 103 km for establishing an initial connection.  So that can't work, either.  The only cellular protocol that *might* be able to pull off communication at that distance (I'm not sure) is CDMA, but CDMA doesn't use SIM cards.

Also, there's the problem of it being infeasible to replace cellular tech with satellite tech because of insufficient availability of spectrum.  Cellular phones broadcast omnidirectionally, requiring fairly directional receivers, which isn't practical at LEO altitudes, at least when the devices are transmitting with the miniscule amount of power that modern cell phones can generate.  And you would need several satellites just to cover the U.S.  (For example, the Iridium constellation consists of 66 satellites.)  That's just one of many reasons that satellite phones use entirely different communication hardware, and cost an enormous amount of money to use.

Finally, even from the perspective of the ground, I suspect that satellites in low Earth orbit would be moving way too quickly for cellular phones to connect to them.  If you could somehow get past the distance limits, you'd still have the speed limit (250 km/hr or 155 MPH for GSM, 350 km/hr or 217 MPH for LTE).  The nature of time division multiplexing requires devices to do their transmitting and receiving within specified time intervals, and there are limits to how far the devices can adjust those time intervals.  Changing those limits would require significant changes to the protocols, which translates ""custom cell phones"".  That's why high-speed trains have their own cellular sites on the trains themselves, and use specially modified hardware to exchange data with specially modified base stations using a nonstandard cellular protocol.  And that's not even taking into account the doppler shift problem, which becomes significant at 17,000 MPH.

While I'm at it, I should also add that it typically takes many days to bring a spare satellite into position unless you expend insane amounts of fuel to shift one satellite at altitude into the orbital plane of another.  That part was kind of implausible.  Then again, the notion that taking out a single satellite in a constellation (a group of satellites working together) would have any real impact on the operation of the constellation as a whole is also wrong.  In fact, you could take out potentially one or more satellites in each of a constellation's orbital planes (the circle in which a group of satellites travels) without having any impact at all on actual satellite phones, so long as adjacent missing satellites weren't near the same latitude at the same time.  The only way taking out a single satellite would ever matter would be if you were dealing with geostationary satellites, and again, you're not going to get a balloon that high.  You couldn't even get the Space Shuttle that high.  (620 km was its record, which is only about a sixtieth as high as those satellites.)  In fact, as far as I know, we've never recovered anything from that altitude other than the Apollo moon missions....

So please, Hollywood, if you're going to use real technology, please, please, please use it in ways that could actually be plausible.  We do notice.",1440806400,,9268,4.83936507936508

A wacko billionaire global warming nutjob decides that the only way to save the earth is to cull the world's population.

7851076,1,630356027X,"This movie starts out as an amusing romp. Gadgets, one-liners, British one-uppsmanship. All very jaunty. Then, without warning or explanation, the main character enters a church and proceeds to slaughter every member without provocation, in graphic detail, slow-motion, huge blood spray, unique killing of each member. It serves no plot development. Has no redeeming cinematic function. Its like watching a school shooting in detail. I watch a lot of graphic, violent movies, so it wasn't that...it was like a betrayal of the audience. It felt creepy and unredeeming. Even my 14 year old son, said, this is just wrong.  We were really disappointed and turned it off.",1526428800,,666,5.224299065420561
