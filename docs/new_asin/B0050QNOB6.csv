4517951,5,B0050QNOB6,"Like a lot of the viewers who bought this set, I happened to find this series while channel surfing and quickly began DVR-ing it after the first episode (for me it was the Villisca Ax Murders). I like the narrator. His dark sense of humor is the same as mine and he makes each episode fun and fast paced (unlike History Channel's dried up Haunted History series) as well as not making it too scary for kids.  My only complaint is that this series wasn't given another season. Oh well. At least we have this set to rewatch over and over again.

Also, as a bonus feature we are given Ghostly Lovers which is basically about a group of lonely women who are apparently having sexual encounters with ghosts.  No need for toys and battery powered boyfriends here when you have Casper the Hot and Horny Ghost.  Interesting side note but a little risqu for the little ones.",1343606400,,865,4.455696202531645
4517952,1,B0050QNOB6,"...And not to offend any of the people who enjoyed this show.  I recently had the opportunity to sit down with seven of my friends to watch ""Ghost Stories"" and we all agreed the host did sound like he was telling ghost stories for children. The stories were interesting, and would have been more enjoyable had the host taken a less dramatic approach. I noticed some people took note of Karen's review - If you enjoyed ""Ghost Stories"" that is okay, but for the people who did not - that is okay too.  Reviews are to inform, and not to offend.  Buying any video is a risk, and we happen to agree with Karen's review.  For those who enjoyed the show, the people who have the same critera for the paranormal as you should find your reviews just as helpful.",1322352000,22,752,4.35
4517953,5,B0050QNOB6,"I am glad that I came accross this TV show on DVD? Yes, I admit that the narrator was a litter strange at times,but I really enjoyed the ghost stories. If they released anymore seasons of this TV show I would buy them.",1320796800,,218,4.093023255813954
4517954,2,B0050QNOB6,"The title held great aspirations, but upon viewing..it severely lets you down. Like other 'benign' reviews of this programme, it could have been great but is a whipped up 4 x ad break potential, terribly narrated with a cheesey voice that laughs at everything waste of time.
Apart from his spooky tongue n'cheek laughter, they hit just about each scene with this gawd awful shrieking scream which was getting on my nerves even after the first story.
They are 20--25 min episodes which are more a quick historic overview of whatever is deemed to be haunted... To tell you the truth, it may as well be the same friggin town they disuss in each episode.  Boring and a waste of time. It wouldnt even scare a two year old.. Talk about disappointing...Will try and sell to some mupppet on Trademe to get my money back. Avoid at all costs",1317859200,3,831,4.577181208053691
4517955,4,B0050QNOB6,"If you have seen a History Channel series called ""Haunted History"", ""Ghost Stories"" is a very similar paranormal documentary program with a bit less focus on the back-story and a bit more focus on the ghost story itself.  If you haven't seen ""Haunted History"", then I'll explain.

As the narrator says in the first episode on the disc, `Boise Theater', ""I have a tale to tell you.""  This is essentially what the series is.  Jay Thomas plays the eerie storyteller relating accounts of ghostly happenings within a location.  As he narrates, the viewer's eyes are treated to photo and video images for that location.  Plenty of low-budget sound effects and various `apparition experience' interviews round out the basic idea of ""Ghost Stories"".

The series isn't out to prove or disprove any of the possible hauntings that it presents.  Like a campfire storyteller, it uses what it has in order to entertain viewers and draw them into the story.  So don't expect any high octane scares or Speilbergian special effects.

If your `paranormal experience' requires a bunch of people walking around with cameras and jumping at every little sound, then you won't care for this series.  If you enjoy hearing/watching straightforward stories about supposed hauntings with few theatrics, then this series is well worth the money.

The main reason that I've given the set 4 out of 5 stars is due to the discs, themselves.  The discs don't have a `play all' function.  The disc returns to the main menu after each episode plays.  The menu doesn't move to the next episode in the series either.  This makes it too easy to forget which episode was last watched after stepping away from it for awhile.  This may be a bit nit-picky.  However, I find it a bit annoying when a show does not just automatically advance to the next episode.",1317427200,,1818,4.828478964401294
4517956,1,B0050QNOB6,"I could not get past the narrator.  The little chuckles and affected ""Dad telling a ghost story to three year olds"" narration is obnoxious beyond belief.  There is far better material available.",1315785600,5,194,5.03125
4517957,5,B0050QNOB6,"Ghost Stories is just one of several shows based on the paranormal. So why should anyone watch it? The narrator reminds me of Freddy Kruger. He is funny and makes the show worthwhile. The stories aren't too bad and looks better then other ghost shows on television at the moment. The show is plain and doesnt make it look like a cheap horror movie ala Haunting or Ghost Adventures. If you like straight foward ghost stories without theatrics and an over the top host, this show is for you.",1315699200,10,489,4.50561797752809
4517958,5,B0050QNOB6,"If you enjoy shows about the paranormal, I think you will enjoy this box set,  I love Ghost Adventures and as I have been awaiting the release of more of their DVDs, I have been looking for other paranormal shows.  I have gotten into Ghost Hunters, and I found this too.  The episodes get into the stories about many locations which have been covered on Ghost Adventures and Ghost Hunters and give a good deal of background into these locations.  I really really enjoy this box set.  So if you are like me and love Zak Bagans, Nick Groff, Aaron Goodwin, and all their lovable friends, and the Ghost Hunter/Roto Rooter by day guys, then this is for you.  Keep the paranormal shows coming.  Lots of scary fun for all you ghost lovers out there and you skeptics too!",1464220800,4,763,4.446043165467626

I've bought so many ghost, hauntings & paranormal dvds, only to be disappointed by most, but these stories are exactly what I like, people telling of the histories of the buildings and the people who lived & died there and the sightings they have experienced.

4517964,5,B0050QNOB6,This is a great DVD.  Kind of scary but lots of fun to watch. These are ghost stories in every sense of the word. The narrator is Jay Thomas (Eddie LeBec) from Cheers. He was also on Murphy Brown.,1440115200,,196,4.0256410256410255

Most reviews blast the narrator, but I love him. He takes nothing from the stories if anything ,to me he adds to them.  You get 2 discs ( one has 10 stories and the other has 8. ) But you also get Bonus Features Ghostly Lovers. I'm only sorry that  the series lasted only 2 seasons and Travel Channel doesn't always play them. You'll get a little of everything, haunted hotels and houses, forts and bars. Even a haunted ship and penitentiary. Plenty to choose from to get your creep on. So turn off the light, pop these in and enjoy the ghost fest.",1408838400,5,690,4.180451127819549

4517971,5,B0050QNOB6,"Ghost Stories is a 2-disc collection of 16 episodes (includes a bonus episode), spanning over 6 hours. It tours reportedly haunted locations in the United States, and gives in depth historical facts, while making sure it doesn't become boring. I truly couldn't stop watching.

A lot of the reviews are bashing the show for having a ""cheesy narrator"". I personally think the narrator added to the show, with his over-the-top humor and creepy voice. It makes the show more entertaining, and it didn't ruin a second. Do not expect any amazing special effects, just some documentary re-enactments and some theatrics and sound FX mixed in.

Each disc contains a decent amount of episodes, with 10 on disc one and 6 on disc two. Most episodes have a runtime of 22 minutes, with a couple lasting 45 minutes. These are the episodes-
  ---------  DISC ONE----------

  1: Boise Theater (Boise, Idaho)
  2: Trans- Allegheny Lunatic Asylum (Weston, West Virginia)
  3: Axe Murder House ( Villisca, Iowa)
  4: Moundsville Penitentiary (Moundsville, West Virginia)
  5: Peter Shields Inn ( Cape May, New Jersey)
  6: Emma Sands ( Manhattan Bistro, New York City)
  7: Fort Mifflin ( Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)
  8: U.S.S Hornet ( Almeda, California)
  9: Sammie Dean (Jerome, Arizona)
  10: El Fumador (The Cuban Club, Ybor City, Florida
  My personal top 3 from this Disc is-
  1- Axe Murder House, 2- Fort Mifflin, 3- Moundsville Penitentiary
  ----------- DISC TWO---------
  11: J.J Stark ( Moon River Brewing Company- Savannah, Georgia)
  12: Prince Suleymam ( New Orleans, Louisiana)
  13: Sister Katherine (Hotel Galvez, Galveston Texas)
  14: Toni Jo Henry (Calcasieu Court House, Lake Charles, Louisiana)
  15: Joel Clough ( Burlington County Prison, Mount Holly New Jersey)
  16: Dr. Edwards ( Linda Vista Community Hospital, Los Angeles, California)
  My personal Top 3 from Disc Two,
  1- Dr. Edwards, 2- J.J Stark, 3- Joel Clough

4517978,2,B0050QNOB6,"Ghost Stories has several episodes with various ghosts. The only interesting one was the Bonus which was women having ghost lovers, one of which was her deceased husband. Strangely, she never asks him, ""What is it like where you are? Where are you actually?"" Etc.  They have romantic dates with glasses of champagne (it doesn't show him drinking his). But the three stories are very similar (except for the other two women, one, it's a stranger, and the other it's her Indian lover in a previous life).

At the beginning of the episodes, there are lots of pictures flashing and jerking around.  The intermittent screams are annoying and make it difficult to hear the speakers. The narrator is also extremely irritating, and he always says, ""Trust me"" or ""Believe ME""  which got tiresome. Also weird was that no one corrected the speakers or said, let's do that over: saying down for up, seen for saw, communitive for communicative, etc. One of the interviewees who lived in the Villisca house as a child says, ""There isn't a time I don't think about Villisca."" So she thinks about Villisca non-stop?

In every episode that I watched (I didn't watch all - too boring) they talk about other ghosts, not the one the episode is supposed to be about.  The Trans Alleghany Lunatic Asylum is talked about, next thing I know, they're talking about a train tunnel and a train came too fast, and the three railroad workers in the tunnel hurried to get into the cubbies, but some didn't make it in time. I guess they didn't have a train schedule, or maybe they thought they still had ten minutes or so. The engineer didn't give a reason for his speed. Did they ask him and he just clammed up?  Also two children's ghosts were in the tunnel, but nobody knows why.. Then, it goes back the Lunatic Asylum, where a little girl named Lilly was born and died at age nine. Of what? Lilly's ghost likes to play ball and eat snacks.  According to one psychic, Lilly's mother is a very elderly woman ghost whose name started with an ""E"".  The narrator says he has seen the records (it shows a book with a hand covering up a name) and supposedly a woman with the first initial ""E"" was admitted in the 1920's.  What's the big secret? Surely she is long dead by now.
One of the local women who was an expert on both the tunnel and the asylum says things like, ""Me and three other ladies that was in my group...""

(I've since looked up Lilly and according to Stephen Wagner, paranormal researcher, she only lived a few hours. Her mother, Gladys Ravensfield, lost her husband in the civil war, and was raped by soldiers. This caused her to lose her mind, and be admitted to the asylum, where she gave birth to Lilly.)

Elma Sands was murdered (doesn't say how) by her lover in NYC, and he threw her body in a well. The well is now in the basement of a trendy bar in Soho.  Her lover took her on a sleigh ride in December and to the place where the well was, but there was no snow.  Lots of green grass. A bartender went downstairs to get a bottle of liquor, which was locked up behind a chain link fence. He unlocked the padlock, went inside, and when he came to leave, the lock was locked again. So he had to sit there and wait for someone to find him. They didn't interview the person who found him.

Some of the ghosts were the murderers. You'd think it would be the innocent victim, but no. One man killed his ""girlfriend"" in 1833, although she was dating other men and refused to attend a ball with him (she went with another guy and was brought back by a totally different one). So he pretends to be sick so she will take care of him. Why would she take care of him? He kills her with a knife that she gave him. In the reenactment, the woman is wearing dark red nail polish which was not in use in 1833.

The show is weak.",1380585600,2,3802,4.364022662889519

Also a friend of mine was on the show up where I live, but that was on the new ones that just came out & not on dvd yet. There was a few in the set that I hadnt seen yet. Dont get this show on my tv channels anymore so it was cool to watch since I had nothing else to do. The Haunted I think are the best paranormal true stories tv show to watch also Paranormal Wittness. Anyways this set isn't so bad.

I'm not sure if the others reviewers made a mistake or if Amazon misfiled these reviews but this is for the Ghost Stories anime not whatever the others are talking about. The anime was dubbed to have a more comedic tone which makes the show feel like what would've happened if South Park had been created in Japan and was focused on Japanese mythology and urban legends except they decided to throw in American pop culture jokes to confuse Japanese viewers. There's apparently another English dub out there somewhere the uses the original show's script translated to English but I don't think it ever made it to the US.

4517987,4,B0050QNOB6,"This is the story of some elementary school kids who go around dealing with ghosts. While that may not sound that interesting to most people, the thing that makes this interesting is the voice track.
The voice track is like MST3K wrote the English localization, it feels raw and from the hip. The breaking of 4th wall and the industry jokes will last but I'm not sure how this will age as some of the pop culture references are getting old. Think of the dialog as a less refined version of Shin Chan. Seeing the number of the voice actors who wrote the English script, I imagine this was rather cathartic for them.
I do not see an age rating on this in Prime so I should point out that while this may involve elementary school kids, you probably do not want to show this to elementary school kids.
