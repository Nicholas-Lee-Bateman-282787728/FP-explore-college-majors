8545191,4,B009Y5QG8M,"Interesting, touching story-- I lived in Korea in the early 1980's when the professional league started, and was also very aware of the provincial rivalry between the Lotte (Pusan/Japan) and Haitai (Cholla) teams which arose from both provincial and business rivalries since the  companies were the two biggest candy and non-alcoholic beverage companies at the time. The story becomes even more interesting but sad when you consider that Haitai (a wonderful Cholla company, never benefiting from the non-Cholla leadership in Korea) was a casualty of the Asian economic catastrophe of the late 1990's.  Cholla-do should be proud of its Tigers and the Haitai company.  They should continue to live in the hearts and spirits of all Koreans.",1358121600,,737,5.282051282051282
