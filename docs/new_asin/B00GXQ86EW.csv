8628493,3,B00GXQ86EW,Bought this dvd for when I'm on my treadmill doing my walking/running. It's not as good as I hoped.. A little slow showing the scenery...,1425686400,,137,4.52
8628494,5,B00GXQ86EW,"I was delighted with this video. The views of Paris are marvelous, and gave me the impression I was in the city. I have already used other cycling DVDs and this one is ultra smooth and gave me the feeling that I pedaling through traffic, but without the smog. I lived in Paris for three years and it made feel like I was back there. Watching so many monuments go by gave me a huge motivation to keep me going through this majestic city. I love the quality of the filming. I highly recommend.",1406419200,,491,4.23404255319149
8628495,5,B00GXQ86EW,"I love this DVD. I spend a lot of time on my stationary bike due to the cold climate area i live in. DVD features a nicely paced trek through the streets of Paris. Not only the perfect start to my workout, but motivates me to keep moving.",1406419200,,238,3.9791666666666665
8628496,5,B00GXQ86EW,"Almost as good as being in Paris and on a sunny day as well! I love this tour of a world-class city. Few places on earth could deliver so many historic and classic sites.
The pace on the boulevards and side streets works perfectly for me. Im not working out for a triathlon. The acoustic guitar further lifts a pleasant mood without intruding, and flows well with the journey.
For the reviewer with the inane comment about Paris traffic, I will add my complaints: Lets remove the beautiful lush trees along the magnificent boulevards and widen those lanes; Why show Notre Dame without a football field?; Why have all the statutes of Napoleon and other dead men, and that Arc de Triomphe which appears useless they all just draw crowds and impede traffic.
I appreciate the length of this DVD expedition, as it serves as three DVDs for my exercise purposes. Cant wait to try your Sedona tour.",1400371200,,890,4.639240506329114
8628497,3,B00GXQ86EW,"This walking DVD is fine, but has become boring after a few times. The menu is difficult to navigate and the dizzy camera angles and the stop lights are a minor concern. I need a large collection of treadmill DVDs to keep me walking!",1396137600,,233,4.318181818181818
8628498,3,B00GXQ86EW,"There's a lot of stagnant scenes with little or no motion. I wanted to feel the movement like I was riding down the road but there's not enough of that. I had to mute the music which is OK because I'll listen to the radio while I ""ride"" through Paris. I don't recommend this DVD and I'm going to have to look for something better.",1393977600,,330,4.092307692307692
8628499,5,B00GXQ86EW,"What a great way to see the beautiful city of Paris, without the pollution or traffic jams.
I have been to Paris many times, and it is so very much better to see Paris with this video. Better than being there ! It is rare to see Paris like this with relatively light traffic and few people. There is no stopping in traffic as was wrongly said in one review, and the transitions are ultra smooth. The video enabled me to pedal at my own speed and to re-discover the best sights and monuments of Paris, and with a lovely blue sky ! A blue sky, so rare in Paris !
I also like the music, which is mostly guitar, electrical and acoustic.
I recommend this DVD if you want to exercise at your own pace and feel good while visiting Paris.",1393113600,,730,4.147887323943662
8628500,1,B00GXQ86EW,"Granted this is the first video like this I've ever tried, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  It was suited to simulate more of a leisurely stroll than an actual workout.  The starting and stopping in traffic may have been realistic, but I was looking for something smoother to make it seem as though I had the road to myself.",1390694400,,328,4.360655737704918
8628501,5,B00GXQ86EW,This is a great video to watch while exercising on an indoor bike. I loved biking in Paris. Highly recommend.,1390003200,,109,4.5
8628502,5,B00GXQ86EW,"I just rode my bike around Paris!
I am an intermediate exerciser, and ride an indoor bike whenever I manage to get myself motivated.
I am completely in love with this workout. I found myself pedaling through Paris and not wanting to stop. This video is awesome!
A unique ride through Paris, it actually goes through Paris streets. I've already watched it a couple of times and discover something new each time. It is fun to watch those cars and mopeds swerve around, you get to see famous monuments, and finish out of breath.
It's a long video, that lasts over an hour. This is my second of their videos. GREAT!",1386720000,2,611,4.513513513513513
