8477091,5,B005KQ8O8E,"There are of course many many recordings both audio and visual of this ever-popular opera.
This La Scala production conducted by Korsten, is however, the best starters' choice.  The reasons are evident:
(1) It is authentically Mozartean in style, both musically and visually (it is a period production, not avante garde);
(2) The sets are fabulous and truly 'classical';
(3) The performers all master with exactitude the requirements of their respective roles, with some clear standouts in the main protagonists;
(4) The singing cast is of the very top rate;
(5) There is exceptional choregraphy to match the musical performance;
(6) The entire performance is bubbling with dramatic tension.
Is it really so good? It is!
The main protagonists are exceptionally well chosen and performed.  Italian bass-baritone D'Arcangelo as Figaro is the 'perfect' incarnation.  He has an added bonus of being Italian. Musically he is as accomplished as Hermann Prey, the great 'Figaro' of the 20th century (mostly under Karl Boehm). Another 'perfect incarnation' is German soprano Diana Damrau's Susanna.
Damrau has a light silvery lyrical soprano voice.  It may not exactly be soubrette, but it fits in with Susanna's music exceptionally well (it may not suit as the Countess Almaviva, though). It is gutsy; it is agile; it is highly modulative.  Then of course, her acting is simply unimpeachable! As Susanna, Damrau surpasses past greats like Mirella Freni (under Karl Boehm) and many others.
Orsatti Talamanca does not own a very beautiful soprano voice, nor highly noble stage presence, but she acts well enough.  Partnering her as the Count is Spagnoli, with a beautiful baritone and noble stage presence.
Veteran mezzo-soprano as Cherubino may not withstand close-up shots, but as far as her singing and stage presence goes, her Cherubino is nothing less than sterling.  We must remember that this is not a film but a live stage performance.
The minor characters are also superb, with a Marcellina played by Fischer so lively that almost matches the Susanna.
If you wish to have a first taste of Mozart's famous opera, this one is it!",1329782400,20,2127,5.147826086956521
8477092,3,B005KQ8O8E,"""Stage Director: Giorgio Strehler,"" the front cover tells us. Well, sort of. The great Strehler passed away in 1997; sets and costumes for a FIGARO production of many years earlier were recreated for this Milan show, taped in 2006. Presumably the revival director (Marina Bianchi) attempted to follow Strehler's existing playbook, so this can fairly be called ""the Strehler FIGARO"" as much as what the Met puts on these days can be called ""the Zeffirelli TURANDOT"" (though alive at this writing, Franco does not make the trip overseas each time to supervise his creations of the 1980s). But Strehler was an intense, hands-on perfectionist. I recall Riccardo Muti's story of watching him spend four hours on the tiniest details of lighting a Scala DON GIOVANNI, so that what Muti had thought perfect at 8 o'clock had become indescribably beautiful by midnight. We can only guess at how accurately this DVD reflects his vision, and he is in no position to object if it does not.

The productions from Strehler's actual lifetime that I have seen (e.g. MACBETH with Verrett and Cappuccilli, regrettably not on official DVD) are beautiful, still surprisingly contemporary in their economy of means...and livelier than this. Nothing here is very funny, and not much taps into what in Mozart/da Ponte is incisive, even corrosive about human nature. A lot of care does seem to have been put into making the problematic action of Act IV clear; I wish I could say the same for the earlier acts, which are more muddled (the video direction isn't especially good in framing, shot selection or sequence). As to the general look, it has a mellow beauty that the eye takes in gratefully -- a lot of gold, amber, and cream in the interiors, giving way to the black and blue hues of Act IV's nightfall. Ezio Fregerio's sets and the costumes of Franca Squarciapino are lovely. But this is a bland, devitalized thing, less theater than genteel frieze. In such a low-stakes, ""harmless"" FIGARO, I often found my mind wandering from what the people on stage were enacting and communicating.

Nothing on stage is as problematic as what emanates from the pit, however. Conductor G&eacute;rard Korsten, governing the Scala Orchestra, whips up an unassertive, homogeneous-textured FIGARO, and the orchestral contribution is less worthy of preservation and dissemination than anything else on the recording. His tempi are often slow -- a somnambulistic, suspense-free drift through the Count/Basilio/Susanna terzetto in Act I gives grim warning -- but the bigger problem is an inability to bring off his ideas with any point, spine or tension, or to lead in a way that supports singers by helping them best achieve their effects. This desultory, droopy phrasing, together with Daniel Barenboim's recent opening-night lumber through DON GIOVANNI (heckled and booed, not without cause), suggests a steep falloff in the standard of Mozart playing at Italy's most prestigious theater.

Members of the cast go some way toward salvaging the evening, and to taste, they may make this worth seeing. Marcella Orsatti Talamanca was a new name to me, and I was much impressed. Her Countess Rosina is full of interesting tones, not all expected. Often this character is portrayed as a fading, wistful grand lady, and there is some of that here, but there also is an undercurrent of indignation at being put in a position of growing old too soon; there are vitality, humor, and the suggestion of an inextinguishable spirit. Both arias are quite moving, and if the audience seems unsure whether to break the flow with an ovation for ""Porgi, amor"" (they do, giving her a modest one), there is no holding them back after ""Dove sono."" If neither timbre nor technique is on an elite level, there is much expertly guided legato phrasing to admire, and the legato is never just for pretty display; everything Orsatti Talamanca does seems about realizing the possibilities of the musical line and text and finding something truthful yet personal in them. That she is a young-looking Countess aids the chemistry with Diana Damrau's Susanna. One feels more than usual here that these women could be and are friends, that their different stations are a happenstance on which neither dwells much. Damrau has the richer voice of the two, and hers is a full, voluptuous, star-turn Susanna, no perky chirper; she treats the music very lovingly. Mezzo Monica Bacelli, so very good as Despina on one of three Muti COS&Igrave;s released on DVD (Vienna '96; Medici Arts), is in less than best voice and intonation here, and also is less convincingly boyish than other Cherubinos; but she is vivacious and no liability. Of the smaller roles, Jeannette Fischer's top-flight Marcellina (zoological aria intact) begs citation.

Ildebrando d'Arcangelo rarely is less than pleasing as singer and actor, and Figaro seems to have as much claim to being his role as anything does. He is at least as good here as he was in the roughly contemporaneous Salzburg performance of Guth/Harnoncourt (DG DVD). Perhaps he is freer in Milan to turn on the charm; the Salzburg production was an intentionally neurotic, somber one. Less of an asset is the Count Almaviva of Pietro Spagnoli, who is hamstrung the most by the middle-of-the-road direction, and whose hooded, nasal, Bruscantinian baritone is not intrinsically compelling enough to make up the ground. Maurizio Muraro fares better as Bartolo.

I cannot say this is a game-changing addition to the burgeoning videography of one of the greatest operas. However, even though I have several other FIGAROs, I cannot be very helpful in declaring that one leads the field, something I like to do when I give less than a rave to a DVD of an oft-recorded work. Every FIGARO I have seen has things to love and things to tolerate. The early 1990s Glyndebourne with Fleming's Countess, Haitink conducting, is tempting to suggest as first choice (a storied British music magazine went that way in its recent discographical overview), with the caveat that Kultur's DVD is not of great audio/video quality. Perhaps the viewer with no FIGARO -- if any such person has read this far -- could do worse than to choose one based on which of the many available has the most appealing cast.",1324684800,11,6249,4.993282149712092
8477093,5,B005KQ8O8E,"The cast is good, if not excellent.
The sets are marvellous (kudos to La Scala).
Music wise, this is very excitingly conducted and performed, with wonderful chorus and lead singers.
But I would concentrate on the lead roles more, because here we have two truly outstanding and classic portrayals of Figaro and Susanna by D'Arcangelo and Damrau!
Recalling the good old operatic days when this opera was under the batons of the like of Karl Boehm, Riccardo Muti, Herbert von Karajan, et. al., we have famous portrayals in the persons of Irmgard Seefried/Lucia Popp/Barbara Bonney et.al. (Susanna), Hermann Prey/Cesare Siepi/Erich Kunz et.al. (Figaro), Eliszbeth Schwarzkopf/Lisa della Casa/Gundula Janowitz (Countess Rosina), George London/Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (Count Almaviva) et.al. Well, let me announce that in this grand operatic tradition, we now have two brilliant Mozartians in the respective roles of Figaro (Ildebrando D'Arcangelo) and Diana Damrau (Susanna).
Both not only sing exceedingly well, but also act gloriously. What I must also stress is that Diana Damrau is the perfect modern Susanna with her great vocal acting, fine dancing and classical bodily movements. Her body language is absolutely stunning and in character, as well as in tune with the MUSIC!
This is what I consider to be operatic acting in the grandest manner and highest degree. Her expressions of the character's different plights and psychologies are so well directed through her movements (be it dancing or walking or running), through her vocal expressions (in recitatives and arias and ensembles alike), that once on stage, she becomes the pivotal point, and that is exactly what the character of Susanna is about!
One could not imagine a finer portrayled Susanna in this present operatic age.
As for D'Arcangelo, he is witty, manly and determined all in one, if one jot cooler than the classic portrayal of Hermann Prey and Cesare Siepi in this role. He is much better here than in the 2006 Salzburg production under Harnoncourt. Vocally he is simply PERFECT in this role.
Spagnoli is adequate as the Count Almaviva, so is Monica Bacelli as Cherubino. Orsatti as the Countess is fine in terms of stage presence and demeanour - but vocally not in the same league as the other leads, admittedly.
Even so, the minor quibbles in no way destracts from the brilliant performances by the leads, whether solo or in ensemble, and the choregraphy is wonderfully in tune with the sets and the story plot.
Bravo!",1323648000,4,2493,5.173267326732673
8477094,5,B005KQ8O8E,"The new Arthaus Musick release of the Marriage of Figaro was taped in 2006, and why it has taken this long for the commercial release is anybody's guess--possibly no ""star power""? With the exception of Ildebrando D'Arcangelo and Diana Damrau the rest of the cast will not be well known, although Pietro Spagnoli appears in the same role in the Rene Jacobs Figaro taping. Mozart, Italy and Teatro alla Scala are not usually grouped together in one sentence. Allegedly Mozart and Italy have never enjoyed each other's company although over the years there have been great singers who have an Italian heritage and have been considered great Mozart interpreters. Most of us have looked to Austria, Germany and England for the most stylish Mozart and in truth they have led the race. This new release immediately upsets the aforementioned troika. I have no hesitation in placing it among the very best DVD's currently available even though the conductor, Gerard Korsten is a name that ill be unknown to most.

What should be known to most is that this revival features the productionn of Giorgio Strehler, one that dates back to Paris 1973 and the administration of Rolf Liebermann; it was subsequently taped in 1980 and featured Gundula Janowitz and Jose van Dam and conducted by Solti. That it hasn't been reissued is a scandal. When Mortier took over Paris Opera, the sets were destroyed and the costurmes returned to Italy. The Strehler=Frigeriio productionn was mounted in Italy and presumably this current investiture is either a restoration or a recreation. Whatever: it is stunning and we are ini La Scala's debt for making it available, both vocally and visually. Is it perfect? Well perfection is in the eye and ear of the auditor. I miss the patrician sound of a Schwarzkopf, Jurinac or della Casa in all of the Countess' music, but Marcella Orsatti Telemanca makes a worthy Rosina and she sings well if without the panache of the divas referred to.

As for the remainder of the cast, perfection reigns.  If there is a better Figaro than D'Arcangelo I have not seen or heard him. Visually he is sexy, good looking and a superb actor. Vocally he is beyond reproach; in the past I have preferred a baritone in the role, but this is one bass who doesn't suggest ""age"" but a virile healthy young man. Diana Damrau may be German but her Italan is excellent and her Mozart credentials exceptional. Vocally she matches her Figaro in energy, style and action, a truly adorable Sussnna. Spagnoli has a beautiful lyric baritone and style to burn. You may recall that he deputized for Keenlyside in the DiDonato-Florz Barber from ROH. The voice seems large but it is difficult to really judge such things without being in the house. The Cherubino, Monica bacelli will not efface memories of von Stade but she not only is a good actress but she sings well if without the kind of identification that FvS brought to the role.. As is the case these days, the Marcellina, Bartolo and Basilio arias are included; fortunately they are well sung even though I doubt if I would miss them--La Vendetta exceptied.

A quick check with Google reveals that Korsten is from South Africa and has conducted extensively in Europe, both opera and orchestral ensembles. His tempi are sane and there is none of the idiosyncratic nonsense that Harnoncourt imposed on his Salzburg and Zurich Mozart performances. For an orchestra that probably doesn't play that much Mozart (unlike the Vienna Philharmonic) they turn in an excellent performance that succeeds in being both Italian and Mozartean. The years spent under Muti surely proved beneficial. All in all a joyous performance of a masterpiece that deserves a wider audience than what it will be accorded.",1320796800,32,3731,4.889415481832543
