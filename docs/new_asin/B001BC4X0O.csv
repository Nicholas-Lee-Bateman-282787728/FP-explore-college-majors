This story of a high school bully (modern day Saul) who transforms into a loving, caring, person (modern day Paul).  What a story of redemption.  This movie will touch your soul, especially good for a teenager.",1324684800,7,299,4.730769230769231
3488304,1,B001BC4X0O,"ATTEND TRUE CHRISTIANS, before you watch this ""Christian Movie"", do your research about where this movie was produced.  Hint: the original title is 'Turn Around'.  Hint2: read Sean's comment.

As far as the movie goes, this movie had nothing to do with Jesus. No mention of surrendering his life to Christ and the Lord working inside of him. I was really upset at this movie b/c it had potential after he died and came back to life.  I was looking for the Holy Spirit's power changing inside of him but at the end it was just a movie about a boy with a near death experience and deciding to change his life WITHOUT God's transforming power.  In addition, the family spoke about a deceptive scriptures about Paul and there were no talk about Jesus Christ. I disliked it even more when Sara could not make a good play, I was expecting someone to tell her to pray about this issue and ask God for help, or they could have gathered around her to cry out to Jesus for help.  This movie is a FAMILY MOVIE ONLY that cable could broadcast, but don't you dare call this a Christian movie b/c it's a GREAT BIG INSULT TO all BORN-AGAIN CHRISTIANS. I'm thank God I didn't buy this DVD, otherwise would have throw it where the pigs live.",1313884800,20,1224,4.393805309734513
3488305,4,B001BC4X0O,It was only a little corny because the young male actor wasn't incredible.  It had a great message and no smut...although some alcohol use by teens...but it was needed to encourage the message.  Great movie emphasizing standing up to your peers in order to follow the right path!,1302134400,,279,4.791666666666667
3488306,3,B001BC4X0O,the movie was ok.  i thought it would have been better judging by another movie done by this company.(Bell & the Beast)  they had  a trailer for Overcome and it looked pretty good.  It just wasn't as good as i thought it could be.  If you are looking for a good christian movie to teach your kids this would be a good one.,1283644800,,322,4.0476190476190474
3488307,1,B001BC4X0O,"The real title to this movie is: TURN AROUND. Go to their website: [...] to see the real title and the real company who produced it - Candlelight Media Group. (Do a Google search yourself for ""turn around movie"".) It is an LDS movie portraying Alma the Younger from the Book of Mormon. This film bares ZERO actual similarity with the conversion of Paul, let alone anything from the Bible. LDS intentionally repackaged the movie targeting the Christian audience for sales of their DVD. ACTS 17:11 - search the Scriptures to verify things are true. 2 PETER 2:1 - there will be false teachers among you. As far as, Edwin L. Carpenter of Dove Foundation and Isaac Hernandez of TBN Network Programming, who both ENTHUSIASTICALLY PROMOTED this film, per EZEKIEL 33:7-8, in this particular matter, you have failed in your appointed roles as Church guardians (JEREMIAH 28:15; 29:32). Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn't do it, sins (JAMES 4:17). I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel (GALATIANS 1:6). I encourage you to revisit your endorsements of this movie. My brothers, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring him back, remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save him from death and cover over a multitude of sins (James 5:19-20).",1271030400,45,1404,4.711382113821138
3488308,1,B001BC4X0O,"With all that I read about this movie, I was psyched to get it for Christmas. What a letdown? The quality was very poor. Acting wasn't very good. And writing was poor. Storyline was good but not believable and poorly executed. As a past youth worker (20+ years) it would be laughable (or cry-able) if you were to show this to teens, saved or unsaved. My step daughter is not very close to God and she watched it with us Christmas night. Now, it may be near impossible to get her to watch any other Christian movie. And there are some very good ones out there. Fireproof. To Save a Life. Far beyond the quality of this and using church members and friends as actors. Dont waste your money. Especially in light of the fact that it states elsewheres in these reviews that it is marketed to two very different faiths just for the almighty buck. In fact, if you really have to see it, you can have my copy.",1261785600,43,901,4.305882352941176
3488309,4,B001BC4X0O,"I thought this movie was slowly paced as they kept setting up the introductions, then it got a bit dramatic as you see the main character changing.  They had a lot of good ideas and some depth although the ending was definitely cheesy.

Colton's reconciliation with his family and conflict with his friends were, I thought, portrayed realistically.  I sort of liked this character and the way he put all his effort into who he was before - and after - his life altering experiences.

However, the girl Sara was so bland, okay she plays tennis competitively and wants to win badly.  She's helpful to her single mother and assists Colton with his new identity and he helps her train for the match in turn.  Not very interesting, which made the movie hard to watch.  I mean, what does she learn at the end?  Don't lose because it's bad and you can't handle it?  I wish they would have used some other premise for a resolution.

Overall, I was satisfied with the acting and characters and want high school or middle schoolers to watch this because I think it shows them perspective.",1229385600,2,1078,4.567708333333333
3488310,5,B001BC4X0O,"After having watched ""Belle and the Beast: A Christian Romance"" over and over about four times, I decided I'd expand my repertoire and see what other movies were being offered by the same company.  I came across this one and I have to say, I enjoyed it.  The plot is about a wild child trying to do what is right after being in a near-death accident.  As part of his conversion, he helps a girl he has wronged a number of times get back in shape for her tennis match.  It is all very pleasant.  And I have to say, I think one of the biggest assets of this company's movies is that they are clean and religious, but not preachy.  They do seem to be inbreeding some of their actors.  But other than that, I really don't see any flaws.  The acting is just a tad bit amateurish, but not to the point of being bothersome.  And it is just so refreshing to see a movie set in modern-day times that is perfectly clean and relevant.  I very much recommend this movie.",1216166400,128,958,4.185792349726776
3488311,3,B001BC4X0O,"This kid wasn't saved just by going to church. It is cheesy acting but they did try and probably practiced as much. The car wreck was his final warning, a wake up call he did not ignore.",1489708800,,186,4.054054054054054
3488312,4,B001BC4X0O,"well done film for tweens/teens. I don't know what people expect going into a teeny bopper film, but there seems to be a lot of bad reviews based on overly high expectations. It's a sweet clean film, about turning your life around and making better choices. I felt the movie was very clear that the main character was specifically targetting the kids that attended church, in a few different occasions, unlike the other commenters that said he was a jerk to everyone. The only kids we saw him interact with, outside of the other bullies, at all were the churched ones, so we can't really gather how he treated non churched kids. The only part I didn't like was that even though it didn't show the actual church service, the mom asked what the kids learned at church and what their lesson was about, which implied unneccesarily that there were seperate church services for the kids and adults. I'm not sure if my daughter picked up on it. We do family worship and it seemed irelevant to the story to point out that they didn't. Not really a film for younger kids, I would say 10+ possibly younger depending on your kiddo. My 9.5 year old enjoyed it.",1487894400,3,1148,4.524038461538462

We also believe in the Bible. I can't vouch for the movie because I haven't seen it, but please know this movie was NOT put out by our church. It's possible an individual who happens to be ""LDS"" made the movie, but that does not make it an accurate representation of our beliefs. I just feel the need to make this clarification.

He begins going to church, praying, reading his Bible, suffers hardship while losing his wild friends,and overall does a complete 180. How is that not Biblical? Isn't that what happens when one becomes a Christian? They turn their life around? I don't really get the criticism of the movie. The person speaking to him while he died is obviously Jesus, so what's the problem with the movie? I'm confused by some of the comments.",1453593600,3,525,4.595744680851064

3488463,1,B001BC4X0O,"Cute overall story line, but theology is very unbiblical, especially in regards to the gospel. Emphasis is placed on making up for sins through penance as the main component of salvation and removing guilt. However, the Bible makes it clear that salvation is based on faith and reliance on Jesus's death and resurrection as the only way to be saved from the consequences of sinning against a perfect God (Rom 3:21-28). Although it is biblically necessary for true believers to change for the better as they turn away from their sinful thoughts and behavior and turn to godly thoughts and behavior (Eph 4:22-32), that change is a result of salvation, not how one becomes saved. Guilty feelings can only be properly dealt with by becoming guilt free though trusting in Jesus's death and resurrection, not though penance and ""forgiving yourself"" (a concept never promoted in scriptures).",1453248000,9,884,5.061643835616438

Nevertheless, it is a clean and wholesome movie.  Considering what is out there, I was happy to watch it.  The acting is no worse than many low budget films around, but change for the better is good.  Sure I would have loved to see Christ center stage as He is in my life and those I love.  But in this day and age, I am still gladdened to see a film I would not be embarrassed to bring my kid to see.  It opens the door for Christians to carry the message further and deeper.  That is what God does.  He opens the door.  Let this movie be a doorway in which you can share the gospel message . . . Even if it doesn't.",1450915200,36,756,4.006711409395973

It was touching to see how Colton turned his life around after the accident, especially how he had to go through some trials to get people to really believe he had changed and to forgive himself.  I especially liked the advice his mother gave him that forgiving yourself can be the hardest.  Such a true statement for anyone that has made mistakes in life!  This movie was great in the fact that it was based on faith and prayer, but was not overtly preachy.  I liked that Colton turned back to God and the church- but that he also had to take action to make amends and change his life for the better.  Good for family and kids of most ages, a wonderful clean movie that sends a positive message.

Others sound like they really missed the point of this movie.

I thought it was a slow-moving, cheesy Christian film that wasn't very deep, however, one night when my grandchildren were over we decided to watch something on Amazon Prime. They picked this movie. My grandson is just entering Middle School and his sister is in second grade. They loved it! I was taken by surprise at their thoughtful comments about the characters and the storyline. It provoked some excellent conversation throughout the movie and afterwards. For these reasons I am giving the movie five stars. My grand-daughter was almost asleep on the couch but she started watching the movie, sat up and remained attentive throughout the movie, which is not typical. Both children commented afterwards what a good movie ""Overcome"" was and how much they enjoyed watching the movie.

This is supposed to be a Christian film. Shouldn't Jesus get the credit here?

Before the change occurs, the parents of the boy are spineless and allow him to be a jerk to them and his younger sister, come in late, vandalize a church, get drunk, and hang around with a bad crowd. They never discipline him, they just allow him to run over him. Hello? Who is in chargehim or them?

Focus is not on God's grace, but specifically deserved condemnation and working through reparations which requires receiving forgiveness from others before one can truly be forgiven.  Focus was on all the protagonist did wrong rather than on Christ's forgiveness of sins.  Also, it is loosely based on the story of Paul, a zealot murderer of early believers, and this account misses the beauty of God's outstanding grace in Saul/Paul's life.

I became pregnant at 16 and faced this decision.

We decided to keep her and got married 2 years later. I was running around wild, working at the club and doing drugs and being unfaithful. He joined the military and became an abusive alcoholic. Our lives were falling apart and we had a daughter in the middle of it. He brought home divorce papers not a year after we got married as if we were only together bc of her and she's not worth making it work out bc we didn't love each other anymore. That same night, a couple from the local church came by and shared Jesus with us. My husband gave his life to Christ that night in 2009 and he's never been the same! He poured out all of his alcohol and apologized for everything he had put us through. We started going to church. It took me a year, but I also made the same decision in 2010 and God totally changed our lives around. We are so blessed to have an amazing 8 year old daughter that kept us together long enough to make the decision to give our lives to God. I'm so grateful I didn't listen to the voices telling me to abort her bc I'm so young and those telling me it's not worth ruin the rest of my life over a child. She is and has always been worth every minute of it! =) We love each other more than ever before and have 2 more children. We chose to stop being so selfish and realized our need to change.

My cousin on the other hand, was forced to abort her 6 month old baby at 16, her parents paid off the abortion clinic to change the numbers on the paperwork so she can go through with it. I know too many who made the same decision who can't forgive themselves for what they did.

However, the most irritating thing for me was the attitude of the parents toward their son's unbelievably disrespectful behavior. Had either myself or my siblings ever spoken to my parents the way this kid did, we wouldn't have had a life or been allowed out of the house. We would have been at home doing chores at the very least. We didn't have an option not to go to church. We were in church every Sunday regardless of whether or not we wanted to. I blame the parents.

I doubt teens would take it seriously because it's not strong enough, I agree with the commenter who suggested they read the story of Saul in the Bible.  The story is a good one yet the acting is average, there's little emotion ""oh gosh, what will be do with Colton"" ""oh gosh, Colton is 'good' now.""  very bland.

If this was to present a Christian message, where was it?  Going to church, occasionally reading the Bible??  What about actually talking about giving the Glory to God for Colton's change??  The parents could have at least praised God for that?  It also would have made sense for Colton to suggest to Sarah that she give her recovery and her preparation over to God, to play for His glory and not just to ""win.""

The theme is basically 'bad boy' has a near death experience and realizes all the relationships and people he's been taking for granted.
If you're expecting better than average B movie acting/music scores/plot...you won't find it.  If you want to see a good moral story with family safe watching you've found something to watch.

The boy/girl relationship aspect was tastefully portrayed. Also, the film did not expound on the life-after-death experience.

3488704,5,B001BC4X0O,"Very good story of redemption and forgivenessGreat for the whole family!  We watched it with our 8 and 10 year olds even though it was about high school bullying.  It really gave us the opportunity to have a discussion about being kind, and how to handle being bullied, as well as how to forgive those who have wronged us in the past.  I recommend it highly!",1369180800,,358,4.393939393939394

3488707,3,B001BC4X0O,"This is really weird. I would like to retitle this movie either ""How NOT to evangelize"" OR ""If you suddenly remember God during your failing tennis match and pray he'll help you win""

For some reason I liked this.... but it was really corny, and had bad acting. Also the ""Christians"" in it were very judgmental and self righteous. The second half was sort of just a love story that no longer had anything to do with God.",1368144000,,420,4.384615384615385
3488708,2,B001BC4X0O,"This is another attempt for the Mormons to advertise something as Christian when it is not. The one thing it does show is how hopeless the Mormon faith is.  It really shows their core tenant of works, rather than grace, as what it takes to get to heaven. When then movie was over, I thought to myself how empty and without hope the Mormon faith is. The message is better than what Hollywood is normally pedaling, however it is a wolf in sheep's clothing. The tennis scenes by the star were just horrid.  Her form was so bad, that it made it totally unbelievable that she could be a tennis champion.",1367712000,5,598,4.378378378378378

3488711,4,B001BC4X0O,A good description of where true spiritual guidance is born (when an individual is truly alone with God).  I wish people could see the error of their ways without almost dying to find out.,1367020800,,188,4.529411764705882
3488712,4,B001BC4X0O,This was a great movie of redemption.  What better way to give yourself than to help someone else. Really makes one think of taking things for granted.,1366761600,,151,4.592592592592593
3488713,1,B001BC4X0O,God was there but distant. It was like he stepped in and left and from then on no one needed him as if any human has strength to do anything without God whether they acknowledge him or not.,1366329600,10,189,4.0

3488716,3,B001BC4X0O,"This movie has a pretty good message, however there were parts that were just too cheesy.  You can tell its a small film and the actors had little experience, but there was heart to the movie.  There were a few problems with the plot, especially that it was someone else who actually caused the problem the story revolves around.  But in the end I thought it was an alright story.",1365292800,,380,4.4

3488720,4,B001BC4X0O,This is a great movie to watch with your family. Especially in today's society when there are so many cases of kids being bullyied. This really does give kids a great message about how to treat one another.,1364083200,,206,4.447368421052632
3488721,3,B001BC4X0O,"My wife and I often try and watch wholesome movies because of our faith, but what we find with most of them is that the acting can be a little sub-par and the stories are often predictable. That was the case with this movie although I feel that the young man who played the lead character gave a great performance.

It's not a bad movie and it does challenge you on true friendship and overcoming tragedy through positive choices. In all it can be a great lesson movie for young children and early teens. Older kids would probably be bored with it.",1364083200,,548,4.372549019607843

3488723,1,B001BC4X0O,"This is a remarketed LDS movie by the name ""Turn Around"". It has nothing to do with the life of Paul. It has nothing to do with the saving grace of Jesus or the transforming work of the Holy Spirit. It's all about trying harder to be a moral person. The acting is horrible, plot is predictable and was generally a waste of time. My wife and I laughed at how awkward the movie was and how blatantly it missed the Christian message.",1363392000,117,430,4.192771084337349

Not sure why the title is called Overcome. they didn't overcome anything.  A far better movie is Joshua with Tony Goldwyn",1363305600,,336,4.25
3488725,4,B001BC4X0O,"We enjoyed watching this Christian film about an unlikely friendship that developed through difficult circumstances.

The acting was okay, but it wasn't corny which is good.",1362528000,2,314,4.048387096774194

It isn't a big budget movie with famous movie starts... that's what I like about it.

Shows how our decisions affect other people.",1362441600,,301,4.189655172413793

3488731,4,B001BC4X0O,This is a good film.  It's a good example of someone who realizes their mistakes after they've encountered God.  This guy changed for the better and it was all because his parents prayed for him and sought the Lord in the situation. Although the way it happened was unfortunate it shows us how God works everything together for our good.,1361059200,,337,4.6

3488738,5,B001BC4X0O,I showed this movie to my Bible class (8th grade) and did a bible study parallel with it and Acts 9 (Saul's Conversion).  The teens in my class were able to easily make the connection and life application.  Great movie!  Great for teens!,1351987200,,237,4.465116279069767
3488739,5,B001BC4X0O,"Excellent movie, especially for teenagers, shows them that there are consequences for their actions and that they can turn their lives around.
It is a great inspiration movie for those who play tennis and also for those who struggle to overcome adversity and injury in sports. More advanced tennis players may find the tennis technique shown in the movie a bit lacking but that does not detract much from the real message in the movie.
I would highly recommend this movie to anyone for their teens and preteens.
It's a great family movie to sit down and watch together and can stimulate some interesting teen/preteen discussions as well.",1337904000,,637,4.907407407407407

Hero played his role well, especially the rotten personality before the reformation.  Thought it dealt with real life issue of out-of-control teens and the problems they face with acceptance and bullying.  Enjoyed the hero's redemption and that he earned forgiveness--it wasn't just handed over on a silver platter, which made it more believable.

Lust is what you feel carnally in your flesh! About Amnon,and Tamar. Samuel 13:1-38 KJV .The outcome is there is always going to be good,but also bad.

Heat (hot like the fire) started to come from my legs all the way up to my thighs , then I felt a cold wind come over  me and it blew in my ears so loud. (it sounded like the ocean or many waters) lol, I was so scared that I kept asking God , forgive me forgive me over and over . lol.
