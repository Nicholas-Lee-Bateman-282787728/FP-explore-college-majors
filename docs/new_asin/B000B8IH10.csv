2408690,3,B000B8IH10,"Pro:
I was VERY surprised at how quickly the merchandise arrived.

Con:
I did not know that is was a PBS television special though.  I expected it to be more modern and more detailed.  It was like watching and old 70's infomercial. It had some good information but was way over priced in my opinion considering it was such an old presentation.  The only thing missing was Jack La Lane (or whatever his name was).  Should have waited for the library copy to arrive.",1361404800,2,464,4.476190476190476

2408694,5,B000B8IH10,"Dr. Amen offers a straightforward approach to challenging his audience to live a more healthy life.  He is very motivating mixing research, his personal life, and his practice to illustrate his recommendations.  I personally am challenged to make changes--some of which I have already began putting into practice.  He has an easy to listen to presentation that motivates without using excessive guilt motivation.  Dr. Amen himself is a great example of a man with obvious energy who practices what he preaches.  He believes that we should eliminate sugar, caffine, and excess animal fats along with sleeping 7-8 hours per day so that we can maintain vitality even into our later years.  Somehow he is able to convince the listener that this lifestyle is anything but boring.  I would recommend these presentations because you can listen to them over and over again for motivation.",1293926400,19,880,5.111888111888112

8083448,3,B000B8IH10,"Be warned this dvd contains the same exact information as another dvd of his The Amen Solution 10 Brain Based Secrets to Being Thinner,Smarter and Happier. I saw the Amen Solution first thinking it was different from Change Your Body Change Your Brain it's not so if you want to know ways to lose weight and help your brain at the same time get one or the other. Also many of the information seems simliar to his other PBS specials the only difference is it focuses more on people losing weight. It showed how much he lost weight after changing his diet and how he noticed it improved is brain as welll and showed how some couples he helped not only lost weight but were able to get along better as well. Even though there are some different things in this dvd compared to the others. I still do wonder if Mr Amen is out to make money. Alot of his stuff seem very familiar.",1437091200,2,873,4.296969696969697

 If you brain doesn't learn how to balance its chemistry (hormones, etc) at a young age, it needs help.
