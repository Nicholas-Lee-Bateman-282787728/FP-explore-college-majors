8455290,4,B0053IBJ40,Mr. Tim Tackett is such a knowledgeable Sifu. His Wednesday Night Group teaches JKD in such a simple yet detailed way. Having met him at seminar this is like having him there to explain the concepts and techniques of Bruce Lees JKD. Although you cannot learn martial art from a dvd this source of information helps explain this aspect of JKD to anyone interested in this interpretation of JEET-KUNE-DO ABC (Attack By Combination)..,1391904000,,431,4.917808219178082
