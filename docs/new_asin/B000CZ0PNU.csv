8200724,5,B000CZ0PNU,"One of the most under-rated films out there, ""The Deadbeat Club"" is a definite ""Must Have"" for any DVD enthusiast to keep in their collection for those days when your faith in the human race needs a little bit of a boost. Based on a true story, it's an awesome and life affirming piece that's head and shoulders above most of what's passing for movies from the larger studios these days--and at a fraction of the budget! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1410134400,,440,4.582278481012659

I know this is supposed to be fiction, but was told it was also based on some real events that happened in a small Texas towns....even fiction should not be written this outrageous!  I guess everyone remembers details in their own way!  I have to say, it was entertaining trying to figure out who each character was supposed in real life!",1360281600,,474,4.814814814814815
