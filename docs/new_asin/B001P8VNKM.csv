I am not a knife maker, nor aspire to be one, but I was curious as to how the beauties that Loveless made were created...this answered lost of the questions, and Bob demonstrates and talks about the process the whole time.  Worth the money!",1468627200,,315,4.607142857142857
8332585,5,B001P8VNKM,"I have owned this video for about six months (also making knives for about six months) and have to say that it is one the best GENERAL knifemaking videos out there. The other reviews gave it low stars due to the quality and skill level needed to understand what they are saying.

First off, knifemaking takes so many different skills and levels of talent that if someone did make a full video of the process, it would have to cost hundreds of dollars and run for about 10 days straight before you got to the end of it. Then the guy who spent thousands of dollars and hours of his own time to make the video will never make a cent because there just isn't a big market for knifemaking videos.

Second, if you think you can watch a single DVD and produce quality knives, then you've got another thing coming. If you buy a good knifemaking book (which Bob Loveless made one too), read it from cover to cover, then watch this video, you won't be dissapointed. It is worth the money alone for seeing the tools and set up of Bob's shop (a knifemaking legend). Let alone he covers most of the process for making a quality knife. It's like any other profession, someone can't give potential competition all of their secrets. You need to put in the effort to get out in the shop and figure some of these things out on your own.

I highly recommend this video and the quality is not that bad for a video shot in 1992. Buy it and you won't regret it, unless you are lazy and expect to have everything handed to you on a silver platter. Get out there and learn a few things by trial and error. It is way more rewarding that way.

Good Luck",1358121600,2,1627,4.255663430420712
8332586,1,B001P8VNKM,"I recevived this video as a Christmas present. I am a knifemaker, and my sister got it for me, not realizing that this video is dedicated to nothing but stock removal. I thought I might watch it anyways for finish grinding tips. It would be a good video if you have a milling machine, a $1000 2 x 72 grinder setup, and thousands in other sorts of equipment. Not to mention the video is very grainy, and low quality, there are very few good closeups, and the explanations suck. Don't bother wasting your money....",1356480000,,512,4.457446808510638
8332587,5,B001P8VNKM,"This is by far one of the best video's I have ever seen on making knives! However it does leave some things out. If you get his first book and this you will have a great place to start if you want to make knives, or are just interested in how they are made.",1301356800,,257,3.7777777777777777
