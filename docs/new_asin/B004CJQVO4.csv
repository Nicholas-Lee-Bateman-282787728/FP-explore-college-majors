4327325,4,B004CJQVO4,"MISSING IN ACTION and MISSING IN ACTION: THE BEGINNING

Just in time for his big screen comeback, these two Chuck Norris favorites arrive on blu-ray disc. Coming from the less than believed producers Golan-Globus, the Cannon logo never looked more gloriously cheesy than it does in high definition, these 80's ""gems"" are a part of the whole lets go back and win the Vietnam conflict wish fulfillment fantasies of the Reagan/Bush era. On that scale of things, these two pictures come on the short end, not living up to the high mark leveled by Sly Stallone with Rambo: First Blood Part II or Gene Hackman and his all-star crew in the much needed on blu-ray Uncommon Valor.

As it is, these are the film the legend that is Chuck Norris is probably best known for. The first picture is by far the better of the two, which producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus knew, because actually these two pictures where shot in reverse order, but once the mini-moguls saw the flicks, they new that they had one turkey and one half way decent programmer on their hands.

 Here starring as Col. James Braddock, the role he was born to play, Chuck leads a rescue mission for MIAs still kept prisoner in Vietnam years after the war. Aided by a bullet proof raft, a never ending supply of ammo and a better than this movie deserves partner in character actor M. Emmet Walsh. This works pretty nicely as guilty pleasure escapist entertainment that still holds up fairly well. Hear the Chucksaurus roar.

MIA 2 on the other hand is whole different beast. Cheap and shoddy looking, it feels like a real bad TV episode from the era. With Chuck easily out acting, yes you read that right, most of the rest of the cast. This movie is just a sloppy, silly mess with a storyline so absurd that it almost has to be seen to be believed. Although, it must be said that at times the flick goes so far over the edge as to be comically, making it often so bad that it is funny, if not exactly good. A twice over infinity of internet jokes were born right here.",1346630400,,2029,4.472972972972973

4327327,5,B004CJQVO4,It's Chuck Norris in a great series that in its time had a political point and one of the best movie series he did in his carreer.,1335916800,,130,3.8518518518518516
4327328,4,B004CJQVO4,"Finally, after years and years of waiting MGM has finally released both Missing in Action 2 and 3 in Anamorphic Widscreen.  Missing in Action though is still Non-Anamorphic.  Unfortunatly, the DVD has no extras at all, no trailers, chapter stops and subtitles.  Just all 3 movies on one disc.

Here are my thoughts on the actual movies:

Missing in Action- Chuck Norris goes back to Vietnam to rescue prisoners that are still MIA, with the help of M. Emmit Walsh.  The movie was fairly entertaining and had plenty of action.  On the downside, at about 100 minutes, the movie started to drag in certain places.

Missing in Action 2- Prequal to the first movie has Chuck Norris and his buddies captured in a POW camp and are constantly tortured by the sadistic Soon Tek-Oh.  This one is probably my favorite of the 3 movies.  The final fight scene alone makes the whole movie worth it.

Missing in Action 3- Chuck Norris goes back to Vietnam once again to reunite with his wife that he thought was originally dead and as it turns out, he has a son.  Soon they encounter another sadistic Vietnamese General and try get out of Vietnam (along with a handful of American-Vietnamese bastard children.  This one is the least favorite of the MIA trilogy, just like the first one, it goes on far too long.  What makes it worse is the fact that this movie completely contridicts the events of the last 2 movies.  In MIA 2, he gets captured in 1972 and spends about 10 years in prison.  In MIA 3, it's 1975 during the fall of Saigon where Chuck Norris is seen leaving the country.

Overall, if you're a fan of these movies, the DVD is worth picking up just for widescreen transfers alone.",1310428800,4,1676,4.533333333333333

4327355,3,B004CJQVO4,"The first Missing In Action film was the best of all of them. It took place after the war was over and after Norris escaped from a prison camp (in which MIA 2 focused on). The original MIA movie shows the reality of downtown Bangkok after the war including the dark and seedy whore houses and prostitution. (When I first saw the movie on TV, this was all edited out). Chuck Norris sneaks back into Vietnam to rescue and prove that there were still POW's held captive in torture camps long after the war was over.

MIA 2 simply focuses on Braddocks's (Norris) time spent as a POW and his escape.

MIA 3, the movie with the weakest plot, is simply about Braddock returning to Vietnam once again to rescue his thought to be dead wife and son from the terrible treatment of the Vietnamese Government. However, was based on a true story.

I recommend just buying the first Missing In Action film by itself, not the trilogy.",1439942400,,918,4.4523809523809526

4327392,5,B004CJQVO4,"I am speaking for my husband! Good price. He loves these movies. Mainly the first two. One reason I buy these older movies on DVD is because he will watch them on TV channels that have many advertisements. Also they have many cuts when these older movies are on TV, sometimes large scenes! We have 2 TV`s. However we like to watch TV together. So when he turns the channel to one of these I can whip the DVD out and they look and sound so much better on our big screen.

Paying for services that the comfort women provide.  Some get pregnant naturally and some American men want to keep their biracial children.  So some even marry the Vietnamese in question and this makes the woman's life and above all the Ameeican man's life more complicated.

So this is the story of one such man giving in to local temptations and the consequences of his actions.  Chuck Norris plays a soldier who gets his military life quite messy.  Using violence and guts he decides to fight for this wife and child against all better judgment. A lot of the American men are drunks and bullies and abusive of the native prostitutes.  Braddock feels sorry for them and defends them.

Overall the entire series appears to be filmed in either real Vietnam or an Asian place of small darker people, possibly Thailand or the Philippines.  One of the impulses towards Communism amongst the kovals, especially their men, is clearly to get these big nose loud, violent and promiscuous American males out of their Country and out of their women.  They properly take racial offense at the abuse of their own women and boys.

Enjoy the chase scenes and mobs and crowds and general violence and insanity.  Will true love or lust prevail?  Watch and see as Chuck gets wild and angry and right out into the outback of these poor parts.",1468800000,,1477,4.700389105058366
