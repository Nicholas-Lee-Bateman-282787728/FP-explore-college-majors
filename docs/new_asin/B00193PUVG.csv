8271776,2,B00193PUVG,"Extremely cheap-looking movie filmed on video, about 3 disaffected teens that make a suicide pact and decide to take some people with them that they meet along the way.  Suicide seems to be the overall theme of the film, since almost everyone encountered along the way seems to be considering it.  The film seems to move backward and forward through time so it gets a bit confusing.  The idea is fairly decent, the execution is pretty bad though.  Usually I can watch something that is fairly bad and not feel cheated but this is one of those films that I'd like to travel backward in time myself and pretend I never watched.",1420934400,,625,4.553571428571429

8271778,5,B00193PUVG,"THIS MOVIE IS GREAT IN A GOTHIC SORT OF WAY.  THE CHARACTER (DVD) IS HILARIOUS!  HE'S THE ONLY BLACK PERSON IN THE WHOLE MOVIE, AND HE JUST KEEPS YOU LAUGHING.  THE OTHER TWO CO-STARS, (NOISY) AND (DIGGER) ALSO DID A FANTASTIC JOB.  THEY ARE SO BELIEVABLE AS CRAZY GOTHIC, SUICIDAL TEENS.  YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.",1226188800,2,314,4.535714285714286
