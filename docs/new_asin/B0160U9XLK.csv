8735316,5,B0160U9XLK,"My family and I love this series. We watch these DVDs over and over. It never seems to get stale. We're always fascinated to see what goes into the making of some of our favorites things. My kids often point out things in everyday life or at the store and say, ""We know how they made that."" It's very encouraging to see them take such an interest in the creation of these products. This DVD package is an extra value as it includes two seasons of shows.
Excellent series. Highly recommended. I hope they keep making them.

8735319,3,B0160U9XLK,"U.S. viewers who are accustomed to hearing familiar narrator Brooks Moore will be disappointed with these two seasons (5 & 6). The first half is narrated by Zac Fine, the other by original Canadian narrator Lynn Herzeg. Both do a great job, but if you're looking to hear the calm, soothing voice of the Science Channel's original narrator, you'll want to skip this set and buy other seasons instead.",1490745600,,399,4.797101449275362
