3644520,5,B001HUWQGS,"I purchased all 6 of the pink panther movies which are favorites of my partner - he is looking forward
to being able to watch his marathon movie nite.  thank you",1375574400,2,161,4.193548387096774
3644521,5,B001HUWQGS,"This is a picture I would like to buy a long time. Unfortunately, it was never available in Brazil. Despite no subtitles in Portuguese, the ones in Spanish can help brazilian watchers that are not able to understand English.

Ted Wass had an incredible performance and I will never be able to understand why no other films based on The Pink Panther Concept was not accomplished with him as the main Artist.

The problem might be the economic success that did not arrive. Pity for the ones who recognized in Ted a big potential to keep on bringing laughter and joy to the fans of the Pink Panther Series all around the world.",1356998400,2,624,4.513274336283186
3644522,1,B001HUWQGS,"Do not waste your time and money on this turkey. As a big fan of the Pink Panther series, I was offended by this rip off. Not a single laugh in the entire film.",1322438400,2,160,3.735294117647059
3644523,3,B001HUWQGS,"This is almost worthy of being called a Pink Panther movie.  It is not as bad as ""Son of..."", but it still seems just an attempt to cash in on the Panther name.  It does come off as more of a Panther movie than Son of does, it has the slapstick that one expects, but it isn't Peter Sellers.  It just isn't the same.  Guess I am just biased.",1246665600,10,340,3.8840579710144927
8309723,5,B001HUWQGS,"We were pleasantly surprised, both seeing this movie for the first time.  Huge Peter Sellers fans and in particular the Blake Edwards Pink Panther creations, we thoroughly enjoyed this movie even though the master himself was not in it.  There are scenes that are side splitting, including the blow up doll, the really outstanding car chase and many others.  Herbert Lom like Sellers was himself fantastic and continues to be so in this movie.",1464912000,,443,4.95945945945946
