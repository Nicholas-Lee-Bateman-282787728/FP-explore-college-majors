2191109,1,B0006Q943C,"Too much talking and going over equipment.  Very little racing.  I purchased for my 2 1/2 yr old nephew and he loves, loves, loves, his ""cartrucks"".  This did not hold his interest.",1167350400,3,181,4.59375
2191110,4,B0006Q943C,It's quick moving and covers a variety of interests for lil' motorheads.,1162857600,2,72,5.083333333333333
2191111,5,B0006Q943C,"My 4 year old has learned so much from these DVD's! We now have the entire set and he LOVES them! I think they're a bit quirky, but not so much that I mind watching with him. I'd much rather watch this than some of the stuff on television.

These series are not animated and they are educational, teaching children about real life things. The biggest thing my child has learned from these videos is safety. I just bought the set for my nephew for Christmas.",1131494400,11,457,4.313953488372093
2191112,5,B0006Q943C,My son has the whole collection now and loves them all!,1128384000,8,55,4.090909090909091
2191126,5,B0006Q943C,"And, what kid doesn't love seeing the big monster trucks crushing junk cars?  Also, the race car episode is enjoyable and keeps the little ones' attention, too.

Seller:  Great Serviceand highly recommend",1389225600,,204,5.3125
2191127,4,B0006Q943C,"This DVD is NOT fancy at all when it comes to the videography but my 5 year old LOVES it. As a parent, it seems a little obnoxious and way outdated but I was happy to have something for him to watch that isn't so busy and overstimulating. A cute little movie for the money and kiddos that love truck watching.",1388102400,,309,4.081967213114754
2191128,5,B0006Q943C,"I used to work in video production.  But you don't need a degree in film to know that these people had about ZERO budget when making this.

Regardless, my 3 year old loves this.  I kind of love it too, sort of like I love watching infomercials.  The cheese factor is off the scale.  Really, it's a horrible video, but I know it by heart.  Al the scenes, all the lines, the songs... oh the songs.

We sing the song and I chase my son around the house while we sing it.  Great purchase for us!",1363824000,,491,4.041666666666667
2191129,5,B0006Q943C,"We got several of these videos, and although I think they were made in the late 80's/early 90's, it doesn't matter to a little boy. All the titles are fun and interesting. Hope you enjoy. Highly recommend!",1338940800,,205,4.5675675675675675
2191130,5,B0006Q943C,We stumbled upon HHH at the library and my son likes him a bunch. Had to buy him his own copy of Monster trucks. He has watched this movie 12 or more times since we got it. It is his go to movie. A bit corny for grown-ups but to my 3 year old it's the best.,1311033600,,257,3.526315789473684
2191131,5,B0006Q943C,"My 3-year-old son LOVES Hard Hat Harry. Yes, the videos are dated and obviously low-budget. Yes, the acting is amateurish. Yes, the editing is laughable. But I didn't buy these videos (we have all of them) for MY entertainment. They are surprisingly informative. This one in particular, as well as the Trucks/Fire Trucks and the Rescue Adventures/Police Cars are my kid's favorites.
My son, a stereotypical boy, loves to learn about cars and trucks. In this video, Harry teams up with a pair of kids and shows them what it's like to be a race car or monster truck driver. My kid quotes lines from the cheesy dialogue, and tells anyone who will listen the difference between an Indy car and a stock car.
These DVDs have become a staple in our house, and to be honest Hard Hat Harry is a LOT less annoying than, say, a certain ubiquitous furry red muppet who hasn't yet mastered the first-person pronoun.",1222992000,3,902,4.64375
2191132,5,B0006Q943C,"My son watches this over and over, it's a little cheesy and poor quality but I guess he doesn't mind.  He's 4 yrs old.",1214092800,,118,3.9166666666666665
2191133,2,B0006Q943C,"My son loves these videos and could watch them all day - if I hadn't hidden all of them.  Hard Hat Harry makes me want to throw up.  The kids in the show are disgusting Barney-esque actors too.  They totally overact and make me cringe.  I'm so surprised other viewers commend these videos, I guess if you need your child to sit still for 30 minutes.  But hopefully I'm not in the room also when it's on.",1197504000,2,403,4.181818181818182
2191134,4,B0006Q943C,"my 2 year old is obsessed with monster trucks and watches this at least once a day- but he'll only watch the monster truck part- the dvd is split into two segments- race cars and monster trucks. it's good, because he can totally bypass the car part and go directly to the trucks, but on the other hand, it seems like a waste of a DVD to me. i give this 4 stars, for good price and the fact that my boy LOVES it, but to me, it seems kind of cheesy and low budget.",1179187200,,462,3.873684210526316
2191135,4,B0006Q943C,"My 2 1/2 year old loves the Hard Hat Harry series. This one is his favorite. I asked him what he would write and he said ""I like monster trucks and race cars"". I personally feel Hard Hat Harry is a little hard to handle but it is very informational and educational. Recommend for all toddlers who like to watch dvd's. Good value for the price, too.",1171411200,4,348,4.208955223880597
8042290,5,B0006Q943C,"I agree with what everyone - good review or bad - says: all Hard Hat Harry videos will make you cringe, kill you with cheesiness & bad acting, and give you scary flashbacks to the 80s/90s. However - it's not about us, so think it's unfair to give a poor rating when the ones we get it for, our kids, all love it! And yes, like some say, in an odd little way, good ol' Harry will find a sneaky way into your heart & the songs into your head. I don't let my almost 3 yr old watch anything on cable personally. Disney & all those channels all have such loud, frenetic shows. We travel at the speed of things like Curious George & Bob the Builder. This is that speed - and indeed, unlike the red Muppet another reviewer mentioned, Harry can speak coherent, correct English. My son loves all the detail & will fuss at me about the need for safety equipment like helmets! Just, again, beware, all the horrid songs are completely infectious. I know Helicopters & Farm Equipment by heart, much to my son's delight (meanwhile he'll tell me ""enough singing"" if I try the alphabet song"").",1511913600,,1077,4.336633663366337
8042291,5,B0006Q943C,I  haven't seen it.  I got it for my great nephew and know he loves it so I rate it as excellent since it was a hit.,1481760000,,116,3.259259259259259

8042293,1,B0006Q943C,The cheese level on this show is Ultimate Queso....but your kids will probably love it and watch it over and over like mine have.,1445040000,,129,4.416666666666667
8042294,5,B0006Q943C,My kids are 7 and 5 and love watching all the Hard Hat Harry DVDs!,1437609600,,66,3.466666666666667

8042298,4,B0006Q943C,Really cute dvd on cars and trucks.  Kids will enjoy watching cars being crushed by monster trucks.  DVD is not slick but enjoyable anyway.,1398470400,,139,4.75
8042299,4,B0006Q943C,"It was exactly what we expected.  We discovered the show on Netflix but it was removed from availability.  My youngest child was missing it so we were happy to see it available on Amazon.  Of coarse the video quality was a bit off and the acting is pathetic but it's a low budget production from the 90's.  If your kids like monster trucks and race cars, then I'll bet they might like this.",1390176000,,390,4.301369863013699
