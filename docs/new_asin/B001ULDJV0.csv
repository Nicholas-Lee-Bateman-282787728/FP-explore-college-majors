8344291,4,B001ULDJV0,"I was in the mood for a cheesy horror film and with a title like this, how could it be anything else?  It has bad acting, overacting and clunky special effects.  Our would-be heroes come across as such banal idiots that I found myself thinking if they do get eaten by zombies, it would be an improvement, in a Darwin Awards kind of way.  Nevertheless, I would recommend it if what it is you seek is a laughably bad horror flick, perfect for end-of-the-workweek viewing, when you just want to unwind and have a chuckle.",1436227200,,518,4.431578947368421
8344292,2,B001ULDJV0,"The army buries zombie causing material which is found by a squirrel. A man near a cheerleading camp gets bit by the same stuffed squirrel resulting in a zombie chain reaction. The special effects were bad, and sparse for a Troma video. The night time photography was too dark. The acting and characters were sad. The cat fight looked unrealistic.

The film is designed to be campy and cheesy, which it is, but it is really more bad than funny bad. Could have been better.

8344293,5,B001ULDJV0,"Zombie Cheerleading Camp is one of the best Troma movies that Troma never made! It's also the best zombie cheerleader movie ever made!! I enjoyed the first half of the movie far more than the second half, because it contains some of the dumbest yet funniest comedy I've seen in a while. Things get more serious after that though, once the zombie stuff kicks in. There is some decent gore here and there, but a lot of it offscreen. My favorite gore moment has to be where a zombie is chainsawed in half and then hit in the head with an axe. There is also some nice nudity courtesy of a zombie cheerleader who has the biggest set of hooters I've seen since yesterday. I'm proud to own Zombie Cheerleading Camp. It's not art, and that's why I like it. It was made for people like me who couldn't even graduate Community College, much less a big university. And it belongs in every trashy zombie-comedy fan's collection, right alongside Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead and Zombie Strippers!",1302739200,2,994,4.589887640449438

I Rather her than the killer animals and sicko monsters thats chasing everybody! eating poeple! When the one hotshot got sawed in half all my friends and me peed in my pantsThey kep making me watch it and I kep going crazy. If you are scared of scary movies because of blood then you will still be scared, but I think its cool and so I will watch this and laugh like crazy.",1236643200,2,518,3.9903846153846154
