8741270,2,B0182Y8K3O,I think the show would of been better if it didn't have Josh Gad.  He just didn't fit well with Billy Crystal.  Pick this up if you are a Billy Crystal fan though.,1500336000,,163,3.909090909090909
8741271,5,B0182Y8K3O,The show was hilarious. The chemistry between the two was terrific. Some of the skits were just so great - Billy smiling at the camera in the back of the limo had me cracking up.,1467158400,2,178,4.114285714285714
8741272,5,B0182Y8K3O,I disagree with the other reviewer. It was a very funny show. Too bad it wasn't picked up for another season. Damage Control was a particularly funny episode.,1466208000,4,158,4.678571428571429
