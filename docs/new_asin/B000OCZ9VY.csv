8184615,5,B000OCZ9VY,"One of the best sets of NOVA programs. I am a huge PBS fan and NOVA is one of my favorite series. I remember growing up watching NOVA in school and it has always stuck with me. There programs are such high quality educational tools, explorations into many vast subjects. I am a person who reads and watches anything about viruses and epidemics, I am a self-teaching historian on viruses, I know that sounds like a weird hobby or subject but I find the Virus Hunters and those who fight against these horrors are true hero's in trying to fight, find and help persons involved. These hero's place themselves in danger. learning, holding some of the deadliest pathogens. They fight to find what is causing them, how they can help persons or places during outbreaks, it's just so fascinating, scary and educational. This set of programs is perfection. My favorite out of them is the Typhoid Mary program. Each one is a breath taking exploration of these horrors. NOVA never wavers is brilliance no matter what subject they are talking about; you always learn something or experience a reality of knowledge. This set is no different. It's educational, frightening, and a solid tool of exploration of some of the deadliest realities.",1454716800,,1227,4.819905213270142

8184619,5,B000OCZ9VY,"I just finished watching NOVA :EPIDEMIC - EBOLA, AIDS, BIRD FLU & TYPHOID. I am always interested in Documentaries that affect the human race. Disease is nothing new to Man. It was a interesting reminder that AIDS commenced in AFRICA where many Viruses lay in wait to be released. The EBOLA VIRUS depicts the 70's 80's not the current outbreak where some 13,000 cases have been made with a death rate of round 4,500. Plague is Earths way of culling humans and this will continue should the world become too populated. Take a look. Do not buy the disc. EBOLA as it is in this group called EPIDEMIC.
The Bird flu virus is very dangerous as is aids.",1414886400,2,646,4.483050847457627
