8586630,4,B00CUMHE6O,"if you like the old shows this is great! captures the real Green Hornet! but be warned this was probly made or copied in Japan.. so when ever the Green Hornet is getting too much screen time they cut in a totally unrelated Kato {Bruce Lee} fight scene... this is a little confusing and takes away from the original story line.. BUT once you realize what's going it's tolerable.. and kinda funny.. even more so after a couple of drinks <grin>
all in all not bad footage, and if your looking to reminisce over your old favorite TV shows this will satisfy that craving!",1225584000,,566,4.451923076923077
8586631,1,B00CUMHE6O,"If you are a die-hard Green Hornet fan and have to have them get the movie one. It is like 3 episodes cut together into a movie but very well done and very pleasant to the eyes and ears. Only get these if you must. By these I mean now that someone has sold all they can of the complete Green Hornet from the same Action Network cuts, it appears someone is repackaging them to look studio like. Still A.N. and poor in quality. If you read the new Batman 1966 release the same can be said for the Action Network release of the 66 batman series. Oh, and so no one thinks that I think Action Network released any dvds I simply mean the Action logo is on the playback as you get with most of the networks which broadcast shows today. So, as I said on another review  let the buyer beware, It could be better than none as we do not know when the studio will release it, if ever.",1213574400,4,872,4.040462427745664
