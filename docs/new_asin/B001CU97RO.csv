8289453,4,B001CU97RO,"The Bill Kurtis AMERICAN JUSTICE episode of EYEWITNESS shows how easily a totally innocent person may be sent to prison or even death row. Several cases are presented, all with three elements in common. 1.) Often, eyewitness testimony against the accused is all there is; no physical evidence is available to substantiate innocence or guilt. 2.) Law enforcement figures, believing they've arrested the right person, use not-so-subtle influence during witness I.D. sessions. 3.) An innocent person can often very much resemble the actual criminal. Here is where witness recollections can go tragically wrong.

Three cases of mistaken identity, all by more than one eyewitness, are presented.

After seeing this, you'll have no doubt that not every person sitting behind bars is a perpetrator. Some, and less hope it's only a very few, are victims of the American justice systems weakest link: sworn eyewitness testimony that is unintentionally oinaccurate.

A most interesting 47 minutes, that is if you can get through it without suffering an attack of paranoia.",1445299200,,1351,5.994818652849741
