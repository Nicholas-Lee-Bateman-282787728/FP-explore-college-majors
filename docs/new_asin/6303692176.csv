-Yes, it is repetitive. No, he doesn't delve into discussions and descriptions. He simply shows the absolute correct motion and repeats it. Soon he adds to the progression, and repeats it. This is how we learn physical movement, by watching and copying, (not reading or listening).  And who cares if the ""highlight"" footage is old? Are we going to forget about Pele, Cryuff, Rivelino, Zico and Beckenbauer, because they are from the past?
-This tape (in my opinion), is for coaches, not for kids. I don't know many kids even up through college who have the discipline to sit through any soccer tape. Believe me, I've tried. The coaches need to repeat the skills on this tape until they can accurately perform them and then teach them at their next practice session. That's when the kids will learn.
-I have played competitive soccer through college, and now have coached for over a decade. I have reviewed many other training videos including Coerver and Stahl. They all have their strong and weak points but  the Vogelsinger series is still one of the best. When it comes time to teach your group of 10 year olds you won't care that the highlight  footage was a little old, and the movie a little grainey, but you will find yourself slowly demonstrating the moves in a deliberate fashion, adding a little to each progression, and then  correcting obvious errors...... just like the tape.
-I will add that although the tape does a great job demonstrating the feints from a variety of angles, it doesn't address how to have the kids practice the newly learned feints. He only shows his players milling around in a large grid. I would like to see him go to the next progression, add some passive defense, increase the speed and then add game conditions. For this reason, I only gave it 4 stars.
-But, besides that, anyone who thinks they can upload soccer skills to kids, like some sort of a ""computer"" driver, without extensive demonstration and practiced repitition (just like the tape), probably hasn't  taught a lot of dribbling skills, or truely learned the proper techniques, themselves.  :-)",1046217600,6,2264,4.822164948453608
7856521,3,6303692176,"The Dribbling and Feinting tape of the 6-tape series is the best of the lot - but only for an adult who is willing to use the fast fwd btton a LOT, with occasional use of the rewind and slow-fwd buttons.  There are a lot of techniques shown, but unfortunately without any underlying or organizational framework.  It needs some thematic organization - such as ""Sheilding - Feinting - Sole Work etc."" to give principles that can be generally applied.  I took some of the simpler skills to show my U-10 boys with some limited success.  I can't imagine any child under 15 having the patience to sit through the many long boring, and repetitive scenes of the kids at his camp doing these drills with varying degrees of success.",972259200,7,722,4.573643410852713
7856522,4,6303692176,This was a good video. I know the one person who reviewed it didn't like the repetition but I think that was one of it's strengths. He showed you  the move over and over again adding as he showed it. He didn't really go  into the mechanics but just showed you how it was done. The moves were  really ingrained into your head. He showed about ten moves which ranged  from beginner to advanced. On the negative side the video must be 20 years  old and the quality of the film wasn't the best or I would give it five  stars. Until I see something like it in a more current version I would  recommend it.,967161600,7,600,4.120689655172414
7856523,4,6303692176,"The video has Vogelsinger teaching skill drills at a soccer camp.  The detail is good for understanding the dribbling moves.  He repeats the commands over and over so that the student gets the message.  It is long  and not a good ""movie"" video.  You will learn something to teach  to your players that are at least 10 and over.",959040000,,327,4.4576271186440675
7856524,5,6303692176,"I am new to the game and I needed some type of advice that you can only get from a coach. It's hard to find someone to teach you things if you are over 30, like me, and not part of a team. This video breaks down, by way od  slow motion, what you need to develop fainting and break-away skills. I  learn from this video and literally amazed people with my new techniques. I  highly recommend this video.",944956800,6,402,4.063291139240507
7856525,5,6303692176,"Teaches 28 Dribbling & Feinting skills for beginners through professional level.  Each skill is shown full speed, in slow motion, and in an instructionial walk-through; alone and against a defender. Testimonial:  I started playing soccer 3 years ago at age 44, and dribbling has been the  hardest skill for me to learn.  Yet, this year I learned advanced skills  including the 4 kinds of stepovers by watching a little of this video,  practicing, and repeating this until I had gone through the video several  times.",914457600,7,516,5.0
