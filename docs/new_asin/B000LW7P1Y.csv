8442125,4,B000LW7P1Y,"The music is great.  Melodies are memorable and hummable.  The Yiddish accents of the actors takes a bit of getting used to (it is slightly different from the eastern European Yiddish in which I am extremely fluent).  As whole, The Megilla is extremely enjoyable.",1250294400,,263,4.931818181818182
