This film is actually in the public domain, but so hard to see but now not hard to find. This September, 2015 will be the 100th anniversary of the debut of this extremely important film, Raoul Walsh's first successful production, made at a time when you didn't have to have permissions to include real hooligans, prostitutes and other realities from the mean streets of Manhattan, New York City. It is one of the films coming from two important dynamics -- the late 19th century 'reality' films of everyday things which so fascinated people just after Edison invented moving picture technology, and the growing relevance and popularity of New York City with all it's industries, Steve Brody nut jobs, Tammany Hall tricks and brutalities. New York, with all its contradictions, touched more and more heartstrings across the country as films improved, and this film was a major contributor. Hunger for more detail produced films and, in 1935, the Broadway production Dead End, which gave rise to my favorite boys, the Dead End Kids, East End Kids and the Bowery Boys .",1440115200,,1238,4.812206572769953
