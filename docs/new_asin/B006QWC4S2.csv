8503356,1,B006QWC4S2,"The DVD does not have the ""chapters"" option which would enable one to go directly to your favourite segments. One song was entirely deleted and another had one stanza deleted. The dialouges skip forward at many places. The movie itself is very nice, from the golden era of Hindi cinema. But when one is paying the price the seller is charging, one would expect to get their money's worth and I don't understand why the video company could not provide a better quality and a complete DVD as this movie is complete on video CDs available from other companies.",1342915200,,557,4.636363636363637
