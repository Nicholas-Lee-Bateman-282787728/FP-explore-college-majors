8632776,4,B00HHFWKXG,"George Winston at his finest. The video quality is quite good and the sound quality is excellent.  Primarily great piano solos, George also gives us a few unexpected treats of his guitar and harmonica playing.  Overall, I recommend this product.

The only reason I subtracted a star is that, throughout the program, they play short separately recorded interviews of George over each of his songs (history of song, why he wrote it, why it's important to him, etc.). I found extremely annoying and distracted from the program. I would have rather seen all the interviews edited into a separate bonus feature instead of laid right on top of the main program.",1425427200,2,655,4.882882882882883

8632778,5,B00HHFWKXG,"First of all I like his music. I have been listening to his music since the 1980's. I also saw him perform at UCLA. I really injoyed the video of this concert that was held at the ""Ryman Auditorium"" Nashville. So all in all I gave it a five star rating.",1420329600,,253,3.980392156862745
