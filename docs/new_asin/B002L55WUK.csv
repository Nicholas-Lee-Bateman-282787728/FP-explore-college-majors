8648737,5,B002L55WUK,"Having read ""American Fever"" by Peter Christian Hall just made me curious to see if the movie he made before that, was as good as the book. It was! I really didn't know what to expect. It was about a teenage boy with a tyrant of a father and how he deals with life. I really don't like to give plots away; when I watch a movie I prefer to know nothing about the film. I want to be surprised. I just want to say that it is  very, very good. I was touched. I cried. This is a film for both men and women. Like books, I want depth and something to think about afterwards. This move has both. I will definitely watch it again.",1328572800,2,622,3.9365079365079363
8648738,4,B002L55WUK,"Just caught up with this film after 'meeting' director/writer/producer Peter Christian Hall online through mutual friends.  Peter is best known as a freelance writer based in New York who has written articles for the likes of Rolling Stone, the Village Voice and the New York Times, but here he shows a visual eye as well.  The story features 15-year-old Tim whose mother killed herself and left her body for him to find, and whose father is a policeman in small-town New York where they have recently moved.  Tim's father is also abusive and part of Tim's way of coping is through a fantasy life.  Soon fantasy and reality merge, as Tim tries to deal with his situation.  But it's not your typical coming-of-age movie.  The story is told through interesting shots, dreams and fantasy sequences.  And the direction is in very capable hands, especially for a first-time director who shows he knows a little something about making a film.  The acting is more than adequate for a film shot on such a limited budget.  And to top it all off, after meeting and interviewing Gang of Four for a publication, they watched the film and liked it enough to write the music, which perfectly fits the mood of the film.  So bottom line, if you appreciate interesting, well-made independent Cinema, do yourself a favor and check this out.  You won't regret it.",1323561600,3,1344,4.75
