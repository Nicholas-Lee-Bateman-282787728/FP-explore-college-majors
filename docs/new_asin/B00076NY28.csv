He's a great guy, good humor & though I didn't learn to get over my fear of spiders & didn't feel confident to do it to someone or a way to do it to myself, I enjoyed it & never got bored as long as he was speaking.

He reminds that you & the client are working together & concentrating to help get rid of fears that he fully shows compassion for to help get rid of that anxiety. Taht before the early 1900s it was unknown & called mesmerizing & when they used an object for the patient to concentrate on, it brought it to science & mainstream with more validity. He states that it is just science, working with your subconscious to rid of the fears that keep you from the best life you can have.

He works mostly with fears/phobias, that you can't learn overnight nor can you work with all issues in life, fear of animals/insects, social, material, etc.

He has great intelligence, charm & seems like a great, moral guy as well.

He demonstrates on one guy who is afraid of heights in front of a room full of students. It also cuts to a tv program that showcased his ability to help a woman who was also scared of heights & she demonstrated the before/after.

If you're looking to understand some of how hypnosis is done, this is good, but if like me, you were looking for a way to work on yourself, you won't get it here.",1178064000,2,1391,4.233962264150944
8044966,4,B00076NY28,"I had expected Ormond McGill - but it is a master hypnotist using Ormond McGill's techniques. He is very skilled, I have learned alot by watching them and they were very reasonably priced. However, I was really after some classics form the orginal folks that worked alongside Erickson - I find some of the American modern works rather too ""peppy and positive, and a bit annoying"".

Anyway - I would still recommend owning this, there are considerable techniques worth knowing.",1173830400,,476,4.95
