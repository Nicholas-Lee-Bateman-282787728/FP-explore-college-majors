Not only is it so crisp and colorfull , The audio is fine with me . This was the only Star Trek movie that seem ""epic "" , with that alot is owed to the director , Robert Wise and Dougles Trumbal . I saw the movie when came out in the theaters , many ppl . felt it didn't have the same ""warmth "" the tv show had with the crew .I just bought this DVD just last night an was in awe of the images I was seeing . The colors were very nice an the images were very crisp . The price of the movie is well worth it . If your a fan of the show and movies I would check it out . The budget on this film was way above the others, in which the film "" Wrath of Khan "" when the Enterprise was leaving the space dock , is the same ending scene of first film , but shot from another angle , but almost every Star Trek movie 'bollows scenes from other films to save costs , i guess .

It's actually the original Theatrical version of the movie - it says so right on the packaging!  It amazes me that a big company like Amazon can get the description wrong, then not even correct it later!

Was disappointed that it was the incorrect version, but kept it anyway.  I assume the Director's Cut is not available on Blu-Ray.

As for the movie itself:  Looks good, but boring as heck.  Kirk is ticked-off and frowning for the ENTIRE movie, Spock is out of sorts, and only McCoy provides any sort of relief, but not nearly enough.  Too many shots of ""people looking in awe at stuff.""  Slow as molasses, and no background sounds on the bridge at all.  Great music, however, and a few cool scenes, but that's it.

5567344,3,B00BAXTY62,"I love this film. I've been a Trek fan since I was a kid, first saw this film as a teen, and have loved it ever since. Yes, it moves a bit slowly in places, but after ten years without Star Trek, we the audience needed this reintroduction to the crew as much as they needed reintroduction to each other, as changed people who have grown over time. The world changed between 1969 and 1979, and Star Trek needed to evolve as well. And after a decade, we needed that long, loving, lingering look over the Enterprise as much as Kirk did. I could go on defending the film, but I won't here, because this is the point of my review and why a give it only 3 stars:

My complaint here is not with the film. It's with this particular product. Despite the product description, THIS IS NOT THE DIRECTOR'S CUT.

5567346,4,B00BAXTY62,"First things first: most films don't need the best format, but this one with vast vistas and digital effects does.  SO, ensure that you are buying the BLU-RAY copy and not a knock-off, import, or regular resolution print.
OK, now to the film.  We Trekkers waited years of nothing but TBS re-runs of the TV series and a handful of Trek cartoons before the film came out.  We expected a lot, maybe too much.  The film was awe-inspiring visually, with the ship finally seen 'close-up' for the 1st time, and all the additional Sfx that Hollywood had developed over the years since the 1966 TV series.
The producers corralled the original cast with Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Scottie and the Doctor, all played by the original stars(Shatner, Nimoy, etc.) while adding a few new elements.  The old v. new aspect is briefly amplified at first when a replacement captain for the re-fitting Enterprise is supplanted by Kirk due to the crisis.  Their rivalry doesn't really end throughout the film...
The story reached back to the TV series indirectly (in the TV series, NoMad was an earth probe that became transformed after alien contact into a vastly more powerful device).  In the movie, the actual space probe Voyager(which toured the outer planets 30 years ago) returns to earth as V-ger, a massively powerful 'eye of the storm' whose force will destroy our  little planet unless the Captain and crew can stop it.  The alien component of the V-ger probe uses an Enterprise crewwoman as intermediary and there's a bizarre truce:  the demoted new captain(Collins) will marry(sic) the creature, or its crewwoman intermediary, in a spectacular million dollar Sfx.
Just describing the plot made me remember how many mistakes the production made.  The 'love interest' on board was totally ill-conceived and ruins the film.  The idea of a space probe marrying an earthly human was also bizarre.  The whole concept was far too esoteric (notice the later films were much more ordinary and tangible).  This film was like a 2001 or other grand concept, but one that just didn't quite work.
I gave it 4 stars because you must see it if you are a Trekker or a sci-fi fan, as am I.  If you can just take some of the weaker plot points and put them aside, then the entire film is worth the price of admission.  Finally, after seeing the original TV series on a 21 inch black and white set or that wonderful older 10"" GE portable color TV, seeing this Blu-Ray rendition will be a revelation...",1416441600,,2466,4.740046838407494

5567350,2,B00BAXTY62,"Amazon may never allow this review to see the light of day, but it's got to be written anyway: no one should have to buy three separate DVD's in order to find the ""Director's Cut"" of Star Trek: The Motion Picture.

  There are some die-hard fans of The Original Series who fully understand why a director's cut of this film would be necessary, perhaps even preferable. In a word, Robert Wise's original film is interminable, and generally lacking in the character emphasis department.

  Without going through the entire list, the Klingon's first attack of ""the cloud"" and the ""thing"" inside runs a bit long, even for those who believe the world is ultimately a better place with fewer Klingons in it. I don't know if Wise shortened the sequence in the ""Cut"" version (I haven't seen it yet: it's on order, about which more in a minute), but it could definitely use some pruning.

Second, the ""Introduction Of The Enterprise"" (the longest introduction of an inanimate object in the entire history of film), which includes every conceivable angle of the starship (and Kirk, we might as well add, sometimes ALSO an inanimate object) that one could possibly imagine (and THEN some) needs to come in at something under 40 minutes. OK, I'm exaggerating, but, not to put too fine a point on it, there are any number of things we could mention that are a lot more enjoyable that don't last anywhere near as long.

  Finally, because this has gone on enough already, the scene in which McCoy mispronounces ""Kolinar"" is just inane, particularly since fans of TOS are aware that McCoy knows how to pronounce Kolinar perfectly well, unless he got suddenly stupid from shaving off his beard (and what was up with THAT, by the way? The guys in makeup didn't have enough to DO? ""Oh, I know what, let's...."").

  All this being said, there are probably (what with regular, Blu-ray, re-mastered, classic, et al, and what-haven't-you) six hundred and thirty-one separate and distinct versions currently available for Star Trek: The Motion Picture, probably more than there are for Citizen Kane.....or Zombies of the Stratosphere.

  Unfortunately, as many consumers already know, Amazon has acquired a bad habit of including some of the same advertising blurbs and the same reviews for every Star Trek: The Motion Picture no matter what the version, which, for this as well as other products of the same ilk, is misleading to the point of misrepresentation. If you are, in fact, looking for the ""Director's Cut,"" do not buy the ""green faces, left"" box or the ""full color faces across the middle"" package, despite what you may conclude by reading the blurbs or the first reviews: both of these contain the endless version originally released in theaters.

  The ""Director's Cut"" (unfortunately there seems to be no blu-ray edition) is the one in what I will call the ""rainbow box"" (THIS one, unless Amazon has posted this review elsewhere) for thirty-five bucks or so. From hard experience, I bought the other two and am just now sending them back, as they are virtually frame-for-frame identical. I can't wait to see if the ""Director's Cut"" has actually improved the film.

  I really DO need to get a life....",1406332800,2,3192,4.850553505535055

5567352,1,B00BAXTY62,"Star Trek is quite an interesting franchise. If there's one thing that has kept it interesting through the years, is that it's a franchise of contrasts. One week, they'd be exploring a new planet, the next, they'd be faced with a threat in space. And structure-wise, I couldn't think of a better example than this: an absolutely brilliant television series followed with an extremely boring, plodding and depressing movie. It's no wonder it nearly sank the film franchise before the GREATNESS that is Wrath of Khan. Even the cast and crew hate the movie and it's hard to blame them at all for it,

I've no doubt that this film was a big deal when it hit the screens back in 1978, and I kid you not, it's a completely beautiful movie. It has some of the best special effects I've ever seen, for a movie of the 1970s. I've noticed some offensive and blasphemous comparisons to 2001: A Space Odyssey, in how similarly they're paced and how many special effects there are. But, there's a difference. Namely, Kubrick's masterpiece had a story, had themes which even the most pedestrian moviegoer could pick up on on a first watch, and every scene mattered. Every shot mattered.m

There's none of that to be found in this movie. Instead, we get a drab, dry, depressing and ugly excuse to showcase special effects for two hours, complete with dialog that could fit on the back of a cereal box in large print, and acting so wooden, they put trees to shame. I kid you not, roughly 80% of the movie is just shots of the Enterprise crew staring at the pretty special effects outside the window, and long tracking shots of the Enterprise. I kid you not, there is a scene that literally lasts five minutes of the crew passing into unknown territory- five minutes of nothing but special effects shots and reaction shots. Two minutes might be enough, but imagine sitting through five minutes of 40 second tracking shots and 50 second reaction shots. Hell, if not for the music playing in the background, I'd think my blu-ray player was frozen.

Overall, this is one real stinker of a film. 100% style and 0% substance, if you're a Trekkie, it won't even appeal to you there. If you like shots of people staring for long periods of time, then by all means, waste your time (hopefully not your money) on this dull and plodding film. Thankfully Wrath of Khan was there to liven things up; there is no excuse for this mess of a film. Consider it to the Trek franchise what The Twin Dilemma was to Doctor Who, and that's not a compliment. (alright, maybe that's a bit harsh- I'd say that awful Code of Honor TNG episode deserves that name.mid say this is more the Time and the Rani of the Star Trek franchise.)",1394409600,4,2690,4.553719008264463

i have the original DVD release from 2001 the Directors edition release
which only has the 136min Directors cut but i have seen the Theatrical release couple times aswell
even thou i don't own a copy
and i Do love the Directors cut which contains the Deleted scenes from the TV version
i prefer the Directors cut than the Theatrical release
but it's a matter of opinion really you either prefer the Directors cut or the Theatrical version or you like both.
i did some research on the picture and audio quality for this 2013 blu-ray release
before i might have bought it to see if it was worth my while getting it
i found out on different dvd reviews the picture and audio is excellent HD transfer with a new 5.1 surround sound mix
but then i found out that this 2013 release only has the Theatrical version which runs 131mins including credits
this blu-ray does not have the 136min Directors cut edition
very very disapointing, and very pathetic, i thought what's the point buying it.
what the Hell did paramount do, why didn't they put both versions on this blu-ray
which would make alot more sense, how pathetic and ridiculous
but there are all new extras on it of course but no Directors cut version
and amazon should change their editorial reviews saying this has the Directors cut version
well amazon are Dead wrong only the 131min Theatrical release is on this blu-ray

as i said paramount should've put both versions on this blu-ray for the fans to choose which version they want
but for some reason they did not.
so in my opinion this blu-ray is not worth the cash unless you love the Theatrical version then buy it.
but for fans who love the 136min version it's pointless buying this 2013 release.

so i am going to stick with my original 2001 Directors cut version DVD release
until there is a blu-ray release of the Directors cut version if there ever will be one

so i gave this blu-ray release only 2 stars cause there is no Directors cut version
that's the main reason really
but if you love the Theatrical version then buy it anyway",1385164800,2,2140,4.454081632653061
5567358,2,B00BAXTY62,"Amazon, you really need to correct your editorial review:  ""The U.S.S. Enterprise proudly soars again in this newly restored Director's Edition of the original Star Trek movie"" is false advertising.  This is NOT the Robert Wise Director's Cut of Star Trek-The Motion Picture.  It is the 1979 theatrical version.

While this version is nice to own and it will be fascinating to compare the two versions once the Director's Cut becomes available on blu, the unfinished effects and the more languid, plodding pace of this version give me a headache.

The high-def visual transfer is pretty good, with beautiful color, but it is ""de-grained"" with DNR, which reduces true detail as well as grain, and is thus annoying.  I see that there is a ""remastered"" edition of Star Trek-The Motion Picture on blu, but if it ain't the Bob Wise Director's Cut, sorry, Paramount, I ain't buying.

The sound is quite impressive, considering it was remastered in 5.1 surround from a pre-5.1 Dolby Stereo Pro-Logic mix.  There's some nice split directionality in the surrounds, which is particularly useful during off-camera bridge computer voices, and Jerry Goldsmith's music's deep bass thuds really boom.

Also, basically it took a LONG time to get every part ready because of the changes to the script & other production disputes with Gene Roddenberry, & the other script writers. It's perfectly acceptable into the Star Trek canon, but it's not the best. Hell, even the original series had better episodes & they made that show in the later half of the 60s.

I believe my collection edition is what you will get if you buy the movie pictured on the amazon webpage for STAR TREK I: THE MOTION PICTURE [Blu-ray] . On that page, at least at the time I am writing this, the  ""Product Description"" in the ""Editorial Reviews"" section says you will get the ""Director's Edition."" But actually you will get only a digitally remastered high-definition/Blu-ray  version of the theatrical cut. No Blu-ray version of the Director's Cut exists because the additional material added by director Robert Wise was done in standard definition. And he cannot make a Blu-ray director's cut because he is dead.

My review:

A couple of days ago, I finished my re-watching of the complete original TV series. Blu-ray made a big difference. So I decided to continue on and to re-watch the original MOVIES in Blu-ray.

I had seen STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE maybe three or four times previously, and I was not expecting much by watching it again. Indeed the Star Trek nonfiction that I had recently read had not encouraged me. William Shatner, for example, wrote that the movie was a box-office success but it was a creative letdown. Among other things, he pointed out that the uniforms were pale and dull. The main complaint, though, was the special effects...long, boring sequences of special effects.

For me, however, this is one of the best movies ever made. Yes, the uniforms are light-colored, but they are very clean and neat, and they evince a cool science-fictional feeling.

Regarding the special-effects sequences, engineer Scott's tour around the ENTERPRISE is fine, as is Spock's space-suited trip to V-ger's core. But when the ENTERPRISE travels through the layers of energy fields surrounding V-ger...well, I do agree that a proper descriptive is ""boring."" Even so, that lasts for only about ten minutes, and it does not make the rest of the movie boring. If sitting through that sequence was the price I had to pay to watch the rest of the movie, I am absolutely pleased to have paid it. Of course if you have the appropriate gear, you can avoid the sequence by fast forwarding.

The story is perfectly good, and I heartily approve of the ending. I refer to the ascension. It was perfectly compatible with my existential ontological religion.

The most incredible aspect of this movie is that it was made in 1979. True, some of the effects are noticeably dated; particularly the zoom-into-warpdrive sequences and the filmy coruscations around space shuttles and spacewalkers. But the set direction is phenomenal. It is as good as that in Ridley Scott's recent movie, PROMETHEUS.

STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE deserved a nomination for Best Picture. Taken holistically, without getting picky about its parts, it is much more entertaining than the movies that WERE nominated (ALL THAT JAZZ, APOCALYPSE NOW, BREAKING AWAY, NORMA RAE, and the winner KRAMER VS. KRAMER). ST:TMP got three nominations: art direction - set decoration, visual effects, and original score. None got an Oscar. But compared to the millions (maybe billions!) who are familiar with Jerry Goldsmith's uplifting theme--which became the theme for STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION--how many people remember the score that did get the Oscar?

Sadly she died rather young from cancer, but she did have talent and she is very good in this show. The blu ray looks good and this is a story that will grow on you. The story is a star trek story and fits well into the mythology of the show. It wasn't as good as the many movies that followed this one but in 1979 fans were glad to have trek back.

When it comes to the TREK feature films, only the first two - STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE (1979) and STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN (1982) - matter to me because they're so evocative of the classic show, and I'm very fond of those characters. Even though they're in some of the later movies, they seem a bit too tired by then and the scripts had to accomodate that. It all got to be too obligatory and repetitious.

STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE was a long awaited release that held a lot of promise for fans who wished for a feature version ever since the series was cancelled in 1969. STAR TREK'S creator Gene Roddenberry pushed this idea to Paramount execs until the project finally came to fruition ten years later. The original cast members were called back to reprise their roles and veteran director Robert Wise, who helmed one of the greatest sci-fi classics, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951), was signed to direct.

The movie's plot is basically a re-working of the STAR TREK episode, ""The Changeling"", in which an Earth probe that has been travelling the far reaches of the universe collecting data for 300 years is now heading back home in search of its ""creator"". The problem is, over the centuries the probe has evolved into a massive machine with a consciousness that has the power to neutralize all life on Earth if it doesn't get the answer it seeks.

Made before CGI overtook the industry, STAR TREK's visual effects are stunning, utilizing models, animation, and matte paintings on an epic scale which the subsequent sequels never quite attained. Jerry Goldsmith's majestic music score contributes immeasurably to the film's effectiveness, as it interweaves with the sound effects creating a seamless, sonic uniformity. The entire production has a quality that's very reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's groundbreaking masterpiece, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968).

Although the film was not too well received by critics nor many die hard TREK fans, it still brought in a pretty hefty profit. At the time, expectations as to what a STAR TREK movie should be were varied, and not everyone's expectations were met. It came out amidst the STAR WARS craze but wisely kept its own identity and didn't sell out to uninspired imitation. In retrospect, and in the wake of all the TREK features that came out since, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE emerges as a faithful and worthy big screen reincarnation of Gene Roddenberry's original show - exactly what it should be.

The Blu-ray edition of the film is spectacular, doing full justice to its visual and audio splendor. The special features include a commentary by Michael and Denise Okuda, Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, and Darien Dochterman, a segment on the writing of the script, a STAR TREK reunion of extras who were in the movie, deleted scenes, a Starfleet Academy segment, the original trailer and T.V. spots, and a library computer.

More than simply the first STAR TREK movie, this is a thought provoking, intelligent science fiction excursion that ranks among the best of the genre and one I highly recommend.",1368748800,5,3332,4.888495575221239
5567380,1,B00BAXTY62,"There's a good movie in here.  But it's buried under a mess of special effects.  The transporter is conveniently broken, not as part of the story, but rather as a lame excuse to provide us with special effects.  Some people love special effects, but I've never found them interesting. While Buck Rogers' ancient special effects are distracting, the special effects of the original series were good enough for anyone with imagination at all.  I also could have done without all the long-winded reintroductions of the reunited characters.  Star Trek fans already know the characters. Casual viewers can do without back stories; just do as any good movie does: weave good characters into a good story.

Cut an hour of special effects and needless re-introductions and you'd have a pretty good movie.  As it stands, this movie is a snoozer.  But it did serve on good purpose: it served to re-launch the Star Trek series, which not only gave us some very Star Trek movies and four more television series, but also the immortal Galaxy Quest, a great Star Trek paraody.  If you're a Star Trek fan, you'll probably love Galaxy Quest.  If you're not a Star Trek fan, you even like it more.",1368662400,,1180,4.768472906403941

5567383,4,B00BAXTY62,"Star Trek: The Motion Picture is the first film of the post-Star Wars resurrection of the Star Trek franchise and, despite excellent box office returns, has a reputation as something of a disappointment. Directed by veteran director Robert Wise, the film wanted to be a grandiose, philosophical sci-fi epic in the tradition of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.

While in many respects it succeeds -- the design and cinematography of the effects sequences are extremely beautiful to look at and the story asks interesting questions regarding the nature of intelligence and evolution -- this ambition came somewhat at the expense of character and storytelling. The plot is a little thin, betraying its origins as a television pilot script stretched out to feature-length, and is overly reliant on the awe-inspiring visuals and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jerry-Goldsmith-s-masterful-symphonic-underscore/dp/B0089G1UYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jerry Goldsmith's masterful symphonic underscore</a>&nbsp;(surely the finest the series ever received) to sustain the audience's interest. Some of these issues can be attributed to the production difficulties on the film, which prevented editorial fine-tuning in time for the theatrical release in 1979.  For the film's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD-release-in-2001/dp/B00005JKHP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD release in 2001</a>, Robert Wise was given the opportunity to revisit the film and update/complete some of the rougher visual effects. Dubbed the ""Director's Edition,"" this version of the film is not radically different from the theatrical version but is a little tighter, includes a few more character beats, and is generally considered superior to the original release. Still, all things considered, Star Trek: The Motion Picture is probably the most cinematic film with the original cast and entertains as a big-budget, idea-driven science-fiction film.

Unfortunately, this Blu-ray release contains only the theatrical version of the film and is missing Wise's commentary and three featurettes on the production of the film that were included on the previous DVD release. I've heard that the new SFX for the Director's Edition were only completed in standard-definition video and thus would need to be redone for a Blu-ray release, the cost of which would likely range in the millions of dollars. This is disappointing, but the good news is that the theatrical presentation that we do have is of excellent quality, with good detail and vivid colors (some scenes, such as the probe on the bridge, are rougher but that comes with the effects techniques of the production era). Sound is also quite good, providing the organ and blaster beam in Goldsmith's score with plenty of punch. Extras include a commentary with the Okudas, the Reeves-Stevenses, and VFX artist Daren Dochterman that is full of trivia and is pretty light in tone, a featurette on developing the project, deleted scenes (some of which made their way into the Director's Edition), an ""extras"" reunion, a ""library computer"" trivia track, and other miscellany. The package is a little insubstantial, but the transfer of the film itself is more than worthy.

An undeniably flawed film, Star Trek: The Motion Picture is nonetheless an important facet of the Star Trek universe. It essentially rebooted the franchise and remains to this day a thought-provoking and grandiose film experience.

5567384,3,B00BAXTY62,I gave this 3 stars only because it is not what was advertised.  There is nothing wrong with this version; it's just that I expected the Director's version.  I already own this one... the theatrical version.  The version that was rushed to the theaters in 1979 unfinished.  I still like it... but...  just disappointed.,1367452800,,319,4.833333333333333
5567385,4,B00BAXTY62,"The words ""recreation"" and ""enjoy"" have no meaning to my programming.  This is the second best version of the 3 versions of this movie.  The worst is the director's cut.  This is the short version (131 minutes) of the superior theatrical versions, not the stupid, unwarranted Directors cut which I hate.  They ruined this great movie with the Directors cut. Most illogical.  It's just not the same. Unfortunately this one is not the very best version which is the extended theatrical version (143 minutes) so I still can't dispose of the old extended version VCR tape yet.  But what an improvement over that idiotic Director's cut.  The only good thing about that was the neat new scenes on Vulcan and some of the animation when they arrive inside V'ger and where the blue Plasma fireball disappears.  But that's it.  Now, with this theatrical version, you can actually once again after 20 years hear all the exciting computer voices that gave me goose bumps and the computer saying ""Emergency Alert"", ""Intruder Alert"", ""Emergency Alert, negative control at helm"", ""Incoming Fire"", and in the engineering section: ""Enabled"", ""On"", ""Stand by"", etc. which they removed from the Directors cut for no reason in cold blood.  I mean how dumb can you be?! What the Hell is this?  It was a real neat voice.  For example, when the shuttle craft is docking with the Enterprise the computer says, ""Pod secured. Pressure equalized.  Attention launch crew. A travel pod in now available in cargo six.  Travel pod available, cargo six.""  They cut all this stuff out for no reason on the Directors cut.  More examples of goose bump scenes that are finally included: when the blue Plasma fireball is coming towards the Enterprise the computer says, ""Incoming Fire! Ahead zero mark zero! Incoming fire ahead zero mark zero."" And when the transported malfunctions, you hear the better sounding red alert with ""malfunction, malfunction, malfunction.""  I can finally hear that again! With the stupid directors cut all you hear on all the red alerts is just some stupid whoop whoop whoop siren sound and no computer voice at all.  Not very stimulating.  Why do you do this?  What they should do is combine the 143 minute extened version with the new additions from the Director's cut to make a hybrid ultimate version.  Then we could see all the extra deleted scenes like the space walk with Kirk and Spock in the thruster suits and still keep the new scenes on Vulcan.  They should also release this with all three versions of the film on one special edition blu-ray like they did with Terminator 2. Anyway the lossless Dolby TrueHD 7.1 soundtrack sounds very good on this release, the best so far and the video quality on this blu-ray laser disc is excellent.

The best part on this new release (and I really get a lot of goose bumps every time I see this part) is when you get to hear at the beginning on the Epsilon 9 Space Station the computer saying, ""Intruder unidentified. Believe luminescent cloud to be enormous power field surrounding alien vessel. Our sensor scans still unable to penetrate. Klingon Commander Amar continuing to attack.""  That part goes along very well with the great Jerry Goldsmith score and they removed it for no reason in the Director's cut.  I like a few of the scenes they added on the Directors cut but why did they have to mess all these other good audible red alerts and computer voices up?  ""You ruined everything!"" (Time Bandits)  Robert Wise, ""This was your idea. This was your idea wasn't it?""
""Bones there's a thing out there.""
""And they probably redesigned the whole sickbay, too!  I know directors they love to change things.""
""We can only hope that there is a life form aboard that vessel that reasons the way we do."" And finally I can get good goose bumps once again and hear that wonderful scene when the computer gives Spock those instructions about using his thruster suit to enter V'ger.  I give it 4 stars because it's not the extended 143 minute best version. I was so depressed to be stuck with that irritating Director cut all these years.  Wow, thank you Bob Lindley. ""I've waited so long for this. And now it's finally time for me to go out and take the respect and promise that you've earned!  Which one man refuses to give to you!""

The only complaints I have are that I would have liked a Directors cut of the film, which slightly adjusted the pacing, added a few cut scenes back in, and added some newer effects which I thought were great. The biggest complaint of this movie on Blu-ray though, even though the resolution is 1080, there are very large black spots on certain scenes, as if the Film itself had dirt on it. This is very apparent during the beautiful sequence of the Enterprise clearing its Moorings and heading out to space. When the Saucer section enters the frame. It's there on a few other scenes as well and it's so bad it's distracting and unbelievable that they didn't clean it before making the blu-ray transfer.",1484438400,,824,4.612244897959184
