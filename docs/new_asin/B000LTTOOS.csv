2713921,4,B000LTTOOS,"Someone said ""All saints have past and sinners have future"", but for some reason people forget that this film is fiction. There is a certain point that producer was trying to make and those points were remorse, hope and humility so this work is not about religion and it's not even about faith, and monastery used as a contrast background to amplify those points.

The reason I gave 4 starts because this work did not raise any questions and hence with all its visual beauty it lacks any depth. I think this move can be considered starting point of Russian renaissance.",1177891200,,569,4.633663366336633
2713922,5,B000LTTOOS,"Russian DVD with English subtitles arrived in the UK within 6 days of puchase! I am a happy customer also because the film is so good.

Penitent, wonderworking, holy fool, is sought out by troubled laity who are sometimes blessed with miracles, but often saddled with appallingly unworldly advice. Monks are tormented by our heroe's tricks and oddities, but recognize that he beats them hands down in penitence, humility, self denial etc.

There is never a dull moment, one is only sorry that the film seems over in a flash. The ending is almost incidental, as if to say that a punchline would be theatrical.

All acting is good; the female acting is stunning.

It is not, I think, a film one can ever forget.",1177286400,7,709,4.648
2713923,5,B000LTTOOS,"I would like to recommend this film to anyone for outstanding imagery, acting and directing. Since socialism collapsed and a new wave of Russian films came out, it became a rear occasion to see a work of such high quality and culture. It holds a unique place and certainly belongs to the best movies ever made worldwide. The film shows reality where God is omnipresent, and people who are open to it and have established a connection with the Universe. They receive this gift not for being virtuous. Just like everybody else, the chosen people carry their own sins. The story of the film is about Anatoly, a holy man, living life of his repentance, prayer and service. Anatoly had committed a sin of betraying and shooting a man. During long years of repentance at a small monastery in the Northern part of Russia he gets the gift of clairvoyance and spiritual healing. His prayer acquires the power coming only with real faith (I would not confuse faith with church going - real faith is just as rear in church as it is anywhere else, however, a religious ritual can be very powerful when conducted by a believer). Those whom Anatoly answers are not always able to understand or appreciate it.  God's ways often are incomprehensible to many. It usually takes time if ever for people to understand God's reasons.  Even more difficult for our mind, brainwashed by logic, is to accept God's way and follow. Some western reviewers said that the personal story of Anatoly is not developed enough, and the character is too eccentric for a religious man. I believe it is so for those who had never met with such phenomena, never witnessed a holy man or woman who lost their personal history after receiving the gift, whose life became that of service ( God's gift often is a human burden), probably had no knowledge of ""Yurodivy"" and how eccentric that could be (and Anatoly is far from that).  In my opinion, this film presented as ""religious"" or ""mysterious"" is neither of those.  Everything I saw on screen I had witnessed in real life. And what is more important - the viewer does not just get to watch the story - the viewer becomes a witness and a participant of the most powerful and sacred experience - the prayer. Miraculously, the viewer's soul, if there is a grain of faith there, responds to Petr Mamonov's prayer and the gate opens.",1168992000,23,2339,4.656174334140436
2713924,5,B000LTTOOS,"I was at first reluctant to watching this movie because of all the hype it receives in Russia currently. Boy, was I wrong! The film is simply brilliant. Don't even think of missing it! Everything is great about this movie. The story is really short to get you into the mood in the orgasmic kind of way, and it will keep you at the edge of your sit to the very last second.

Absolutely beautiful actors. The film is shot in beautiful widescreen - breathtaking cinematography. The only thing bad about this movie is that it is too short! Don't get me wrong, it is a full-length film, but it's ended just a couple of hours earlier than I expected :)

2713953,5,B000LTTOOS,"Filmed and produced in 2006, and directed by Pavel Lungin, Ostrov (The Island) is a captivating look at a life of piety, devotion, guilt, and sometimes insanity exhibited by a particular monk named Anatoly. The film concluded the 2006 Venice Film Festival and with a budget of $1,900,000, was a moderate box office success. Ostrov received numerous awards and accolades, including six awards at the fifth national Golden Eagle Awards (including best film), and several awards including best picture and best actor at the 2007 Nika Awards. At home in Russia, the film received mixed reaction, with some praising the films message, and others condemning the character of the protagonist as a traitor. Whatever interpretation one takes away after viewing Ostrov, it cannot be denied that the film is a work of art. At times it is haunting and Hypnotic, while at others it can be overwhelmingly Cathartic and joyful.
The premise of Ostrov is a relatively simple one. It is World War 2, and man named Anatoly betrays his commander to the Germans in fear, and is seemingly forced to kill him before the Germans set a charge and leave the ship that Anatoly and his superior are on. Surviving the Explosion, Anatoly is found by monks from a nearby monastery, and joins the monastery upon being nursed back into health. Flash forward several years, and the viewer is shown the eccentric exploits of Anatoly. He plays various tricks on the monks around him, dropping cryptic Biblical messages with seemingly vague implications and acting as a prankster. As much as his fellow monks reprimand him, Anatoly remains unperturbed. People from all over Russia come to Anatoly to receive truth, blessing, advice, or healing and seemingly receive what they came for, provided they adhere to Father Anatolys terms and conditions. Over the course of the film, Anatoly acts very much insane and displays a Yurodivy, or fool for Christ mentality. At the end of the film, Anatoly receives an appeal from an Admiral who believes the only help for his daughter can come from a man of God. Following a dramatic, yet simply depicted exorcism on the Island where Anatoly came so often to grieve for what he had done years before, the demons that plague Anatoly, and the demons that plague the girl are put to rest. A revealing discourse between the Admiral and Anatoly effectively concludes the film.
By the time the film has ended, the viewer has had the ability to experience a wide range of emotional responses. There is an initial shock at the cowardice of Anatoly, and then an empathy for a man who is tormented by what he has done. By the end of the film, the peace that Anatoly encounters is excellently depicted because of depth of his suffering throughout the film. The end of Ostrov is as exciting as it is emotionally satisfying, and viewers who enjoy a happy ending will receive immense satisfaction out of the film. In addition to its emotional impact, Ostrov pays close attention to the religious archetypes that are found so commonly within Christianity. On one hand there are the devout, almost militant Christians who adhere to a rigid system of rules and regulations for their own sake and the sake of others. On the other, there are those who are drawn to Christianity because of the beauty and art that can be used to depict its message. There are those who come to faith from desperation, after everything else has failed and whatever their reservations, the turn to God for healing and hope. Finally, there are the fools in Christ, who tell the truth and have an unflinching servitude to Christ, and find themselves in situations where they can be envied, loved, or depended on to interpret what they believe to be the will of God.
As profound as Ostrov is, there are elements of the film that can take the viewer out of immersion. For one, the film is subject to numerous historical inaccuracies, ranging from geographical inaccuracies to unrealistic depictions of certain individuals (It can be said with relative confidence that German soldiers would not explode a coal barge for no reason before making every possible attempt to take it for themselves.) On another level, as experienced in Russia, the film has a danger of isolating a population who suffered enormously from the horrors of the Second World War, and believes that traitors should be held accountable. Anatoly was never tried in a court for a blatant betrayal, and lived his life free of any kind of trial or military justice. From an ideological and purely patriotic point of view, Father Anatoly was a traitor through and through, and surely deserved to be punished. On the opposite end of the spectrum, however, it would be an understatement to say the father Anatoly punished himself every day. The film depicts his anguish extensively, and it is easy to share in his emotions as a viewer.
In conclusion, regardless of ones religious or political standpoint, Ostrov has an appeal that is undeniable. At the very least, it provides a setting that is chillingly beautiful and isolated, with the characters of the monks and visitors as lively aspects of a dynamic situation that is subject to unpredictable factors, such as Father Anatoly. The film is filled with fascinating dialogue, and sometimes hysterical interactions between various characters. The mood of the film is often morose, but that doesnt stop some very lighthearted comic relief from finding its way into the story. Ostrov is a remarkable film, and deserves to be taken seriously be lovers of cinema all around the World.",1394841600,,5553,4.895966029723992
2713954,4,B000LTTOOS,"Ostrov, or The Island is a movie about a monastery of secluded priests in the far north of Russia. This movie really focuses on the aspects of spirituality but, the great thing about this movie is that you don't have to be religious to enjoy it!

The movie starts out in 1942, it is the middle of World War II, it focuses on a small two man crew manning a coal barge in northern Russia. Not before long a small but well equipped German destroyer finds the barge and one of the crew members Anatoly. Anatoly, being a bit of a coward, reveals the location of his captain and is essentially forced to shoot his captain. The Germans of course blow up the barge either way but, Anatoly is lucky and is saved by a group of monastery priests.

The story of Ostrov really starts 30 years later as we follow Anatoly after he becomes a priest and how he still regrets shooting his captain Tikhon.

The first thing I have to say about this movie is that the atmosphere is absolutely amazing! From the different Russian movies and games I have played this is what i know and expect from them, an amazing atmosphere, and Ostrov is no exception. Every little thing in this movie has character, from the winding, curvy, handmade bridge that Father Anatoly using to get coal to the house in which he lives, everything has such detail and tells a story of its own. Every shot in the movie also includes some of these little items to make you believe that what you are looking at is a real place somewhere in Russia and that you are there living with them. The Russian landscape also helps build on this, when panning around the cold, small, distant island you really get a sense that you are truly separated from the rest of the world.

The characters in this movie also have a lot of charisma, each person tells a story through the way they speak, live, and the way they act. Without going into too much detail each person plays a role that represents a certain mind set, as you go along and see the ways they change it really makes you feel like you know these people in real life.

Overall I really loved this movie but it did have a few faults.

Although the movie was very well done and i really enjoyed watching the characters live, the story was a little slow. Not much happened over the course of the 2 hour movie, although i don't like to admit it, I enjoy movies with a bit more action.

My only other gripe is that the movie's soundtrack could have used a bit more diversity, I'm pretty sure the movie only ever used 2 different songs and after hearing them replayed for the 5th or so time it started to get a bit annoying.

Overall I really loved this movie and i suggest watching it even if you are more into action movies.",1394755200,,2719,4.328094302554027

2713983,5,B000LTTOOS,"Of course, few people nowadays will be able to recognize the fear that is torturing father Anatolij, the main character in this movie, filled with remorse over what he did to his captain during WWII, especially, as he was forced to do this by a German officer, in order to save his own life. But his strive for, his deeply felt need and desire for forgiveness, the way he is punishing himself for that by daily walking up and down quite a distance with a unconvenient wheelbarrow filled with coal over an even more unconvenient wooden bridge, this is of course a very Russian way to deal with sin, but at the same time it is more then just Russian orthodoxism, as it might also serve as an example for all those religious and non-religious human beings nowadays, who seldom reflect their shortcomings nor strive to become a more whole and loving human being. What makes the movie so splendid is the portraying of this dramatic personality with all his weaknesses and hilarious behaviour included, in the background of a small congregation of monks who all suffer from similar small human weaknesses, irritations towards each other, father Anatolij even as the best of all of them in this respect. The acting, the camerawork is superb. This is a one of a kind movie, probably liked only by a minority of people who are still sensitive to the themes of redemption and human folly. By the way, I wanted to give it a five star rating but I can choose only four stars as a maximum, maybe due to my old Linux version?",1354060800,2,1511,4.5588235294117645
2713984,5,B000LTTOOS,"This movie has some unexpected and delightful moments.  There are dramatic moments and moments not explainable within a secular paradigm. Yet, when I view it I am happy to participate in all of it.  It tells the story of a man who goes from despair of entanglement in himself to freedom and peace.  It helps to have a bit of understanding of the Orthodox Church and the  path walked by the Orthodox, but the power of the transformation depicted is overarching.  The visual, even iconic, elements, must be lived with a bit to ""get it"".  This is not a sweet film, but it is good.  It's a bit of work, but it joyfully surprises.

The film is not meant to be a documentary nor a treatise. It just tells the story of one Monk, Anatoly, and his personal struggle/journey and how despite his own pasts and sins he is able to bring God's mercy to others. That's what made me love this film. When I watched Anatoly praying the Jesus Prayer and saw his various reactions and emotions, I totally got it because that's how I feel when I pray the prayer, too! Those who are trying to politicize this film don't get it. I think this movie transcends politics, nations and nationalities. It comes down to maintaining faith regardless of the circumstances or the people surrounding us.  Anyone who has found the richness of Orthodox Christianity will get it...and love it! If anything, this film shows us that despite the attempts of the former Soviet Union to stamp out God and religion in the Russian people, the faith continued and survived, and that's because of monks/""holy fools"" like Antatoly...and the ordinary folks they ministered to who kept the faith in their hearts.",1343001600,4,1172,4.768472906403941
2713987,5,B000LTTOOS,"Ostrov is a story about a WW2 boilerman who shoots his captain on orders from Nazis who have boarded their ship. 30 years later he's still struggling and asking forgiveness.

The movie shows this man's personal struggle with what he did, and his worth in the eyes of the lord. It shows his faith and how it's tested up to the end. It also shows a simpler time, a simpler life and makes you question your values, and opinions.

It is a religious movie without a doubt, and usually I don't enjoy them, but this film made me think, and kept me interested in his plight. You watch as he heals and helps others and uses his visions to put others at peace, yet he himself is not at peace.

It's a great watch though I needed subtitles I'm sure it would be slightly different if I spoke Russian better. Like other reviewers I knew enough to catch some discrepancies in the translation.

2713988,5,B000LTTOOS,"This film was powerful. I know that word is a bit overused these days but it describes my feelings on it. I gave it to a Russian speaking Ukrainian friend of mine and he has watched it twice already. His wife has watched it three times. He said it was so realistic. He also said that there are many of these types of monks in Russia. Men who really do perform miracles and are close to God. He says that anyone who seeks God in this way can perform these miracles as a natural outcome of their proximity to the Holy One.

Anyway, I recommend this film wholeheartedly. And don't be put off by the fact that it is only subtitled, though my friend said he was sure we English speakers are missing out on some of the more subtle aspects of the script. However this didn't hamper my viewing experience. It seemed, to me at least, to give a real insight into modern Russian religious thought and practice. The contrast between the extreme religious fervour of the central character with that of the lukewarmness of the average Church goer who came to seek his advice and miracle working power, and the stale pleasure seeking attitudes of the other monks in the monastery.",1331251200,4,1165,4.469483568075117

2713993,3,B000LTTOOS,"The 2006 film OSTROV (The Island) is a story of religious faith in the bleak Russian north. As the film opens, it is 1942 and the young Russian sailor Anatoly is forced by the Germans to shoot his captain Tikhon. Left for dead, Anatoly washes up on the shore of an island where a monastery is located. He spends the next three decades among the monks trying to atone for the killing of his friend and shipmate. Eventually, though he considers himself the lowest of the low, Anatoly is granted clairvoyance and the ability to work miracles. A steady stream of visitors comes to the island to seek his help.

But Anatoly is a certain kind of saint specific to the Russian tradition, the holy fool. He does things that make no sense to his fellow monks, to the point they think he's insane, but eventually everything he does is revealed to communicate some key spiritual point. Between ministering to the outsiders who visit him and dealing with his exasperated brethren, Anatoly gets no rest.

The film is beautiful in a way. The plot is engaging enough, and for audiences outside Russia (as well as many Russians who grew up under Communism) this is an informative presentation of the realities of Orthodox monastic life. The makeup effects are excellent -- Pyotr Mamonov doesn't look this decrepit in real-life, but on the screen he really is convincing as a starets who has spent decades in an unforgiving environment.

Nonetheless, I found OSTROV rather too heavy-handed, seeming at best sappy and at worst outright propaganda for a certain kind of contemporary Russian Orthodoxy that doesn't represent the faith entirely well. When one thinks of Russian Orthodoxy in cinema, one is tempted to draw comparisons with Andrei Tarkovsky, but even when Tarkovsky wasn't directly using Orthodox themes, he still communicated Christian truths more powerfully than anything in this film (think of the climax of Tarkovsky's STALKER or the ending of OFFRET).

2713998,5,B000LTTOOS,"My wife's mother (as well as my wife) is from Russia and she brought over a Russian film (DVD) for us to watch, Ostrov (The Island). She assured me it had English subtitles as I don't speak Russian. My wife and I watched it a few nights ago. I'd have to regard it as one of the best films I've watched in the last decade. Five Stars!

The story involves a cowardly act of one Russian (friend, fellow worker) against another in the presence of German military officers during WWII. Flash forward thirty years to a Russian Orthodox Monastery in the far north Russian tundra where the perpetrator is undergoing life-long exile in repentance for his cowardly act. I suppose you'd have to be well versed in the Russian Orthodox religion to fully appreciate the film and all of it's subtleties. I'm not the least bit religious. Nevertheless, I followed the story somewhat in awe of the harsh self-imposed physical and religious rigors of the lead character. I would regard him as totally insane, but of no harm to anyone but himself. In the end he achieves redemption in a somewhat stunning way.

This film is simply outstanding. Probably everyone who sees it will attach different meanings to it. Are you religious, non-religious or anti-religious? You'll all enjoy it, but you may derive deep meanings that are vastly different from one another. The cinematography, in itself is worthy of considerable merit. The photography of the Russian far north presents an awesome backdrop for the story of extreme deprivation and repentance. There is very little complicated dialog in the film and the subtitles were ample for me. My wife tells me that there are subtleties in the Russian language that I could not possibly understand from the brief English subtitles, however. In any case, it's a film of astonishing beauty, but I found it to be crushingly depressing and I felt in awe through the entire viewing. I understand it received five awards about the equivalent of our Academy Awards. Believe me, it earned them! It's a wonderful DVD well worth watching several times.

2713999,5,B000LTTOOS,"I think that Ostrov is one of the most under-rated foreign films to have ever come
out-it certainly didn't make it down here to the Tampa area!

I consider this film to be one of the five best films that I have ever seen-and I
have literally viewed thousands.

Why?  Because of the director's taking the time to correctly film just what it is
like for someone to become a starets (Russian holy man), not only that, just how
this individual also becomes a ""holy fool for Christ,"" another Russian designation
for someone who behaves like a madperson, but who also carries great spiritually
pragmatic insights into the human heart.  Think that they are easy to live with??
Not on your life!  But he earns the grudging respect of his fellow monks at last.

A young man who is a coal-shoveler on a Russian tugboat during The Great War, sees
a Nazi boat pull up to the coaldump to refuel, he and his captain hide in the coal.  In a moment of weakness and terror, he betrays his captain.  He is then forced to shoot him.  He goes stark, raving mad, and ends up beached on a lonely
rocky shoreline, and is rescued by the monks who live there.  He shovels coal for
their furnace, and sleeps on the coal pile.  People come from miles around to seek
his counsel for weighty spiritual matters.

After many years, and many complaints from his fellow monks, an admiral in the Rus
sian navy brings his mad daughter to seek his guidance, and healing.  It's his old
captain, who though wounded in the shoulder, is rescued, and rises to the top of
the naval ranks, his daughter goes mad after losing her submariner husband. I won't spoil the ending for you, but if you are looking for a quietly dignified look at people, who live the spiritual life-this is it.

do.

Lungin's breathtaking, heartbreaking direction defines the art of cinema's immense responsibilities so rarely met; visually wrought like a painting, this is art as spiritual food.

2714003,5,B000LTTOOS,"This isn't a film that ""features"" Orthodoxy, it isn't a film that has Orthodoxy as part of the plot.  It is Orthodoxy, in a sense.  Many of the deeper messages won't be understood by non-Orthodox.  They may interpret scenes (like the first miracle, with the pregnant woman) as him ""intuiting"" or ""guessing"" the woman's predicament.  Clairvoyance is some sort of hoodoo magic in the West.  The idea of theosis being lost in the West, a non-Orthodox viewer won't understand what actually happens.  And the beauty of this film is that the Orthodoxy is so seemlesly interwoven into the general story-line that it truly is an Orthodox film, not a film *about* Orthodoxy or *featuring* an Orthodox character.

And the shots, the cinematography . . . not genius, but as close as you're going to get in any film.  A truly brilliant film, just as a film, that is also truly Orthodox.  A fool for Christ as the central character - only out of Russia would you be able to get a film like this.  I cannot recommend it enough.  But for any non-Orthodox viewer, try to have an Orthodox Christian explain certain aspects of theosis and the idea of fools for Christ before viewing, or as you view, to get the ""full"" experience of this magnificent, beautiful film.

His simple life of service and humility bears much fruit for his brothers and those who come to visit him for spiritual cures.

His life reminds me of the desert Fathers and hermits whose lives of solitude had miraculous effects.  Fr. Anatoly is also a prankster who demonstrates lessons to his fellow monks.

Despite the subtitles, this is a movie that is easy to follow and well worth watching. It's drama is interspersed with scenes of silence and music.  Viewers see Fr. Anatoly walking and praying intimately for forgiveness and help.  He also ministers to the crippled, troubled, possessed and other monks.

2714007,5,B000LTTOOS,"'The Island' is a film that, for me, came out of nowhere.  Not only did I not know about its popularity and success in Russia, I'd never even heard of it.  Now it's not so odd that I'm unaware of a particular film - especially those produced outside the U.S. - but after viewing this remarkable effort, I find it very surprising that it hasn't garnered more critical attention and vocal support here in the States, and I'm absolutely flabbergasted that it's not even in stock at this time (and I don't get flabbergasted easily).

All kidding aside, 'The Island' is one of most artistic endeavors I've yet seen dealing with deep-seated questions concerning faith and redemption.  Set primarily in the Soviet years of the 1970's, the story opens though with a flashback to World War II, where Anatoly (Pyotr Mamonov) is captured by the Germans while working on a tug boat full of coal.  In order to save his own life, he is forced to take that of his companion, Tikhon - but salvation is short lived.  The Germans pull a doublecross and blow up the tug.  Somehow, Anatoly survives and is rescued by Russian Orthodox monks from a nearby monastery.

Flash forward then thirty years, and Anatoly is still with the monks.  Nominally referred to as Father Anatoly, he is not a member of the order, but over the years, he has gained a reputation as a holy man, and people come to him as they believe he can tell the future, heal the sick, and cast out demons.  That he actually has such powers is accepted within the framework of the film, though Anatoly himself suffers the torments of the damned from his traitorious actions of thirty years earlier.

This is a visually arresting movie, set in an unnamed area of wintry Russia, and as the viewer follows the plight of Anatoly as he searches for forgiveness, we are also treated to the stark landscape of the monastery and the distant island Anatoly retreats to in order to send his entreaties heavenward.  The monks of the monastery are still unsure about their mad brother, even after all the time he's spent beside them, and at times are more concerned with his failure to follow their rites correctly than whether or not he truly has powers granted to him by God.  To make matters worse, Anatoly seems to be able to look inside his fellow monks as well, and see their hidden sins.  They do not take it well that he chooses to reveal this knowledge to them in the form of pranks and riddles.

I don't think I can recommend this film highly enough - not only to faith-based viewers, but to anyone interested in the universal themes of guilt and redemption.  Patience is required though - sounding these sort of soulful depths is not quick nor easy.  There are no shortcuts, and the tale is told with allegory and metaphor.  Those in search of action and suspense would do well to look elsewhere.

This film bears repeated watching.  As a layman, I thought I detected many references to the Christian Gospels, and I'm sure that I missed other clues intrinsic to Russian Orthodox beliefs.  Some other reviewers made mention that this is a good movie to learn more about the rites of the Orthodox, but I'd have to disagree.  What is shown is no more than a glimpse, something that would probably already be familiar to its Russian audience, but not integral to Anatoly's quest for forgiveness.  Truthfully, this film trancends specific religious dogma and portrays one individuals approach to God.  I'm sure there are many other fine places of information on the Orthodox Church, it's just that this film isn't that kind of source.

Often, these sorts of stories can be overbearing, almost clubbing the viewer on top of the head with their message.  What is truly endearing about 'The Island' is that it isn't trying to evangelize.  In its stark portrayel of humility, faith and forgiveness, though, it inspires something that can be as rare in religious circles as well as anywhere else -  a feeling of sublime joy in all the challenges of being human while seeking a closeness with the Creator.",1239753600,3,4038,4.657263751763047
2714008,5,B000LTTOOS,"I will have to say that this has become my favorite movie of all time - not a lightly given designation. First of all, this is definitely an art film. The cinematography makes a character out of the beautiful but bleak landscape with iconic shots reminiscent of Tarkovsky or Bergman. The same care is given to the characters. Things are clear as a bell, but nothing is overstated. Secondly, this movie sets out to reveal features of Russian philosophy and spirituality which may be baffling to those not familiar with the background, but this is what will require more than one viewing for most - the film achieves a glimpse of Russian spiritual life which goes far beyond the merely authentic existentialism of many art films. For those who have studied Russian spiritual and philosophic traditions, the film will be revealed as a composite of many real persons and phenomena. The character of the fool for Christ (a form of asceticism revered as the most difficult), the experience of profound repentance, uncontrived humility, intentional suffering and the deeply transformational experience of noetic prayer are all portrayed realistically without overstatement. Even the scene of the exorcism is the most realistic dramatization ever made. Come to this film for its beautiful art, and return for the study and reflection needed to unpack its many dimensions, and imbibe its soul-profiting character.

Pyotr Mamonov gives a powerfully convincing performance of a man who is profoundly haunted by ""the sins of his past"" but not deterred from doing all he can to repent and redeem himself in a bleak, remote part of northern Russia.  For this portrayal, he was nominated for the Best Actor award in Russia (the Nika is their equivalent of the Oscar), and the film received several other Nika nominations, including the Grand Jury Prize at the '07 Sundance Film Festival.  The director, Pavel Lungin, won the Nika for Best Director of 2007.

Hollywood, who has a tendency to produce sanitized icons of saintly figures, could take note of how realistic Pyotr Mamonov's portrayal is of Fr. Anatoly's life as a merry prankster who possesses special heavenly gifts.  The drama could have been so mundane as not to be special if it weren't for a secret in this monk's life during World War II that makes him vulnerable and truly appreciate the mercy he dispenses to others.

Endearing for the human way he demonstrates impatience for pilgrims who arrive at his door and an impetuous desire to play pranks even during holy mass, this saint is as believable for his antics which is God's seeming antidote to the grimness presented in his fellow Russians' lives.

2714014,4,B000LTTOOS,"I learned about this film from a local Greek Orthodox monk, who is also a film fan.
  The plot has been overused -- a man makes a critical error in judgement, during war time, which supposedly causes another to lose his life. The man, the next time we see him, is disheveled and has less than pristine hygiene habits. He also is an annoying, half crazed, odd kind of monk among other monks in a less than beautiful monastery. Obviously, a poor monastery.
  We learn that the monk is also reputedly someone others consider a ""healer"" and they (Orthodox believers even in then post-WW II Russia. It's unclear or perhaps I missed any reference to the regime in power. It would seem to be a relatively lose period, certainly nothing within the realm of Stalinist Russia, since religion and religionists were persecuted by that mad man.
  The monk does seemingly perform some miraculous healing experiences for those who sought him out; the monastery's abbot moves in with the monk in a decision which suggests he has something to learn from this man, even though he, too, sometimes wonders about the man's sanity. There is an incident where the monk causes the abbot some true pain, at least emotionally. In the end, the miracle happens for this man who thought, erroneously, that he'd committed a heinous crime. Another ""outcome"" appears for which the monk would have never thought possible.
  The film works on an emotional level, or did, for me, because it becomes painful, in a way, to watch this man's behavior. He is clearly filled with false pride, that he cannot forgive himself even though religiously, there is evidence that of course, God would have forgiven him. He is released, once he learns the truth, and that is poignant and beautiful. The man and the monastery would seem to disappear in mist and fog afterwards. The milieu of the monastery within the Soviet system is bleak, dark, held together by baling wire in a way. It appears to be dismal in a way most Americans, I think, have never experienced.
  I liked the film. Even though the plot wasn't original, nor was the spin of the character, I was grateful for the look into the Orthodox community. The same director directed the film ""The Monastery,"" which I have yet to watch. ""Before The Rain"" also gave some glimpses into an Orthodox Church and community, I beleive, in post-Tito Yugoslavia.

This film gives one a good feel for Orthodox monasticism (in this context), the importance of prayer, and how the monks are ""real people like us"" with their own troubles, demons and sins that can be overcome by God's mercy and love.

2714017,5,B000LTTOOS,"""Ostrov"" ranks alongside Korean director Kim Ki-Duk's ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring"" as an exquisite cinematic spiritual text.  Both are two of the most visually beautiful films I've ever seen; both are thoughtful and sensitive explorations of spiritual journeys.  Both leave the viewer--or at least this viewer--richer in experience and perhaps just a bit wiser.

Brother Anatoli, the protagonist in ""Ostrov,"" lives in a monastery somewhere at the edge of the world on the North Sea.  The colors in the film are nearly monochromatic:  wintry whites, grays, and deep blues, with only an occasional flash of color, that encourage a feeling of stillness, quiet, solitude, and inward-turning.  Anatoli is what is known in the Russian Orthodox tradition as a ""holy fool,"" an individual so focused on God, so out of touch with the customs and conventions of the world, that he or she appears simple, touched, and sometimes downright mad.  Anatoli lives as a hermit in the monastery, bunking down in the furnace house on a bed of hard coal instead of in a monk's cell.  He eats sparingly.  His clothes are ragged, his face is filthy.  He speaks in riddles, sings nonsense songs, and infuriates the more prim and proper of his brother monks.

But underneath his foolishness is a deep spirituality born of immersion in the Orthodox Jesus Prayer, a mantra (usually ""Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, have mercy on me a sinner"") that calms the mind and focuses it on God.  Anatoli, without the slightest awareness of it, has over the years become a saint, a holy man.  But he thinks of himself as a great sinner because of something that occurred in his youth.  The lesson here is as obvious as it is scriptural:  God will not reject a contrite and broken heart.

A film to be watched, meditated on, and (if one does such things) prayerfully celebrated.  What a pity that it's not better known in the west.",1199577600,25,1917,4.831288343558282

2714019,5,B000LTTOOS,"I was sent this film by a fellow Orthodox Christian.  It is about a ""fool for Christ,""  someone who seems to be totally weird to everyone around him, but he is really deeply spiritual.  Knowing something about Orthodox monastic life would help you to understand this film, but it is not necessary.  The main character is seen in a flashback as a young sailor on a tugboat that is captured by Nazis in 1942, and then it moves forward 30 years to show this man living in a very bleak monastery in the Russian north.  The people in the village across the river come to visit him, they see him as a ""holy man,"" which causes some jealousy in the other monastics.  They try to force their views on him to no avail.  Their sins are shown quite clearly to them through their interactions with the ""fool.""  His interactions with those from the outside are quite deep and meaningful, and perhaps shocking.

Father Anatoli recites Orthodox prayers and psalms throughout the movie, which made it all seem much more real to me. I was able to recite the prayers with him,  to share in his worship, prayer, and anguish.

I was given a ""cheat sheet"" that showed me how to move through the set-up screens to get to the English sub-titles.",1198368000,7,1221,4.479638009049774
2714020,5,B000LTTOOS,"In Ostrov (or The Island) we see the spiritual journey of a young man from a moment of weakness and shame to a triumphal victory over death through a life of deep atonement.  The movie begins with the young man, Anatoli, as a mate and coal-stoker on a tugboat moving a load of coal in the shallow waters of the Russian north during the Second World War.  As the boat is boarded by a Nazi raiding party, Anatoli's weakness first leads to the capture of his Captain and him and then to the shooting and death of other man.  Blown up and left for dead by the raiders, Anatoli is rescued by the monks of a nearby monastery.  He becomes a lay monk and serves the congregation for the remainder of his life by keeping the monastery's boiler running by shoveling coal from the blown up barge.  During this time, Anatoli acquires the spiritual gift known in the Russian Orthodox tradition of being a ""fool for Christ"".  This combination of a man living a life of deep humility and spiritual empowerment leads to conflict within the established patterns of life and authority within the monastery.

For me this is one of the more deeply affecting movies on Christian spirituality I've ever seen.  First there is the metaphor of the coal and the burden of moving it to be burned in the fire.  As the movie progresses we slowly see the supply dwindle on the wrecked barge and the movie build towards its climax.  To say more about this would be to give away too much of the movie, but I found much within this metaphor to consider within my own faith journey.

For those of us in the west, there is much in this movie that we may find confusing.  A little research about the Russian tradition of the ""fool for Christ"" will go a long ways to helping understand this film.  Some knowledge of Eastern Orthodox monastic tradition will also make the movie more transparent as well but this is not necessary to understand the main metaphorical points of the film.

Subtitled in English, the movie is beautifully shot; capturing the starkness of the Russian north and the monastery.  I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in the topic of spiritual gifts from a perspective not infected with the self-inflating and self-important tendencies found in the North American charismatic movement.  Here one will find spiritual gifts associated with humility and the taking up of one's own cross; a message we could all stand to receive more often.",1197158400,10,2434,4.638694638694639

2714022,4,B000LTTOOS,"I just saw the film this evening and thoroughly enjoyed it although I would say it is definitely not for everyone. If you like films about Russians, spiritual themes, and bleak yet beautiful places then this movie is for you.

Interestingly I read several reviews on Google and they were all uniformly negative, a view with which I do not agree. I suspect the reviewers are fairly young as they didn't seem to understand that Anatoly actually does have clairvoyant powers in the film, or that there are actually people who would feel tremendous guilt if they had killed someone to save themselves. I found the lack of comprehension by U.S. reviewers of what this movie was about to be far more disturbing than any actual flaw in the film itself.",1194566400,51,745,4.687022900763359
2714023,5,B000LTTOOS,"Ostrov is a real life depiction of Orthodox Christian monasticism as lived during the Soviet period in Russia. The award winning movie has been a sensation among young people in Russia, causing many to make their first pilgrimage to an Orthodox monastery. The movie is a touching account of the spiritual struggles taking place in a remote monastery, and the ultimate triumph of one man trying to repent for his past. As an Orthodox monastic, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested to learn more about the life of Orthodox Christian monks.",1192579200,31,558,4.88421052631579
2714024,5,B000LTTOOS,"I would recommend this film for the outstanding imagery, acting and directing. Since socialism collapsed in Russia and a new wave of ""commercial"" Russian films came out, it became a rear occasion to see a work of such high quality and culture. This film holds a unique place and certainly belongs to the best movies ever made worldwide. The film shows the reality where God is omnipresent, and people who have established their own connection with the Universe. They receive this gift not for being virtuous. Just like everybody else, the chosen people carry their own sins. The story of the film is about Anatoly, a holy man living the life of his repentance, prayer and service. Anatoly betrayed and shut a man. During long years of repentance at a small monastery in the Northern part of Russia he gets the gift of clairvoyance and spiritual healing. His prayer acquires the power coming only with real faith (I would not confuse faith with church going - real faith is just as rear in a church as it is anywhere else. However, a religious ritual can be very powerful when conducted by a believer). Anatoly's visitors who come a long way to ask him questions do not always understand or appreciate his answers. God's ways are often incomprehensible. Even more difficult for our mind, brainwashed by logic, is to accept God's way and follow. In my opinion, this film though staged at a monastery, is not as religious as it is spiritual. It is also not as fictional as it seems: everything I saw on screen I had witnessed in real life. This is why it is important for me that the viewer does not just get a chance to watch the story - the viewer becomes a witness and a participant of the most powerful and sacred experience - a prayer. Miraculousely, the viewer's soul, if there is a grain of faith there, responds to Peter Mamonov's prayer and the gate opens.",1192492800,7,1862,4.61144578313253

2714026,5,B000LTTOOS,"CD-Video PAL version from Kiev Monastery:

Every year I visit my in-laws in Ukraine. I don't know the Slavic languages but watch Russian & Ukrainian movies without English sub-titles & try to follow along. Knowing the basics of Eastern Orthodox monasticism & the historical influence of the Starets; a monk or lay person who by spiritual struggle united with God's grace can cure human physical & spiritual problems, watching the superb acting & story line, at first one may think that they may not need the English sub-titles to understand this movie. The movie is about the spiritual struggles of Anatoli, who in World War Two was captured by the Nazi navy during a coal barge delivery. Because he worked in the boiler room, his cough gave away his hiding place & with fear turned in his best friend & captain, who he may of mistakenly shot with a gun given by the Nazi captain. The Nazis leave & Anatoli thinks he is free but doesn't know of the TNT that the Nazi's had loaded aboard. The barge blows up & Anatoli is washed ashore by a small remote monastery, where the monks rescue him. 30 years later he is a semi-Staret or Fool for Christ, a person who acts out rather than speaks direct about people's problems. Many come to visit Anatoli because they have heard that God answers his prayers, but each day Anatoli rows out to a small island where he confesses his past sin against his friend & captain. Unknown to Anatoli an Admiral hears of a famous Staret & goes to the monastery to find a cure for his sick daughter. Can the Admiral set Anatoli free? Watch this profound & moving movie with or with-out the sub-titles. The Moscow Patriarch Alexy II said the movie was a ""vivid example of an effort to take a Christian approach to culture.""

DVD NTSC Version with English subtitles:

The DVD I bought though Amazon.com via the ""options"" which turned out to be a Russian supplier from Norway that shipped the DVD from New York. I got fast service & the DVD came within 3 days. The DVD is written totally in Russian with no written English translation & no inside cover book. I had to guess in the ""Menu"" section where the English sub-title switch was. In the main menu screen, go to the 2nd listing where you will find the audio sections. Enter in your audio section at the top of the screen, they are in English, then go to the bottom of the same screen, the English sub-title switch is the 2nd option.

Don't watch the previews which come with the DVD, most are about the Russian Mafia which is totally out of character with the movie.

Pro English Sub-Titles:

Okay I admit it, I did learn a few things with the English sub-titles. One part is where the main priest walks outside the coal heating room & looks in a big box & finds ropes inside. I now know why he was looking in it. I also didn't know the relationship between Anatoli & the Abbott was so close. A few other issues got cleared up with the English sub-titles. So much for my theory on Universal language :)

Con English Sub-Titles:

I do know a few Russian words & the English sub-titles were very Americanized. For example the 1st woman shown talking to Anatoli says something like ""you are not a Staret"" but the sub-tiles translate Staret as ""Holy Man"". A ""Staret"" will never think of himself as a ""Holy Man"" but a Sinner under God's grace. A better translation for ""Staret"" would be ""Elder"" or ""Spiritual Director"". Another example of a mis-translation is when the Abbott tells Anatoli he wants to ""tonsure"" him but in the Russian dialog the Abbott adds the word ""Schema"" which is a degree of monastism. You will never know what the Abbott is tonsuring Anatoli to, only that he wants to tonsure, which could mean ""to make a monk"". There are several other areas in the film which the English is not correct or clear. Therefore knowing a few basic Russian Orthodox words will add a layer of meaning to this fantastic movie.",1186963200,47,3899,4.5127478753541075
2714027,5,B000LTTOOS,"Pavel Lungin's new Russian film OSTROV (""Island"") has taken Russia by storm and made quite an impression at Sundance. Is this film about Orthodox Christian spirituality really worth the hype or is its appeal very limited.

Ostrov is worth every second of your time! It is beautiful, touching, and truly profound. The basic plot is about Anatoli, a young Russian boiler-stoker during WWII. Captured by the Nazis, he chooses the coward's route and shoots his Captain to save himself. The Nazis still bow up his barge and he washes ashore on a tiny island monastery in the Barents Sea. Thirty years later, he's Father Anatoli--and is he a madman-boiler stoker, or is a a near-Saint who can heal and who knows things?

Father Anatoli is still repenting, despite seeking God's infinite forgiveness, and this is the theological crux of the film: The free grace/cost-of-discipleship paradox. This spiritual conundrum is hardly unique to Orthodox Christianity! Pious Lutherans will recall Nazi-executed Minster/Theologian Deitrich Bonhoeffer's book, 'The Cost of Discipleship,' for instance.

Anatoli uses his gifts to be a Fool for Christ, who, through humility, can identify the prideful sins of others-- Father Job's vanity at book learning, Father Filaret's covetousness, etc. Although being a Fool for Christ is more understood in Orthodoxy, the concept exists in the west--witness ""Blasillo el Bobo"" in the classic Spanish novel 'San Manuel Bueno, Martir' by Unamuno.

The acting in Ostrov is superb, the casting subtle and sublime. The cinematography (wide-screen monochromatic)is stunning.

This is a must see for anyone interested in spirituality or repentance.

A final note-- in both message and deliberate pacing, OSTROV is a splendid reproach to our quick-fix society, and the spiritual quick-fix, as Father John the Hieromonk of St. Michael's Skete in Canones, NM points out in a recent article.",1186358400,110,1901,5.3624161073825505
2714028,5,B000LTTOOS,"Ostrov is a compelling film, one which captures the essence of Orthodox Christianity.  For those not familiar with Orthdoxy, it is the traditional form of Christianity which predates Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.  Most of the Christian world, including Western Europe, was Orthodox until the Roman Catholics split off from the Orthodox in 1054.  It is the traditional religion of the Russians, Greeks, and many countries in Eastern Europe.  In the story of a clairvoyant, miracle-working Russian monk living in a remote island monastery during the Communist era, Ostrov captures the authentic deep spirituality which characterizes Orthodoxy, especially as lived in the monastic life. A very powerful film, it is an antidote to the secularism, cynicism, and hopelessness which afflict so many in these modern days.  Highly recommended.",1184889600,18,841,5.590551181102362
2714029,5,B000LTTOOS,"Despite some of the other reviews, I saw this movie steeped in Orthodoxy and inseparable from the main characters. My wife and I both thought this was one of the best movies we have seen in a long time. There is so much there you may not get if you have not studied Orthodox monasticism. This movie offers a great visual telling of some of the main themes you will encounter when you read about Orthodox Monks and Nuns. There were many points in the movie where I was reminded of The Elder's from Optina Monastery. This movie is really well done  and is highly recommended.",1184025600,7,573,4.40566037735849
