7009085,5,B00TGNLUYW,"This is a great show for my little guy. (4 years old). Excellent show for all ages but especially for early readers. We save all of the Wallykazams we can on the DVR, but this worked great to occupy my son on a recent 10 hour car ride. Although I packed at least 20 DVD's he was hooked on this Wallykazam, and a Doc Mcstuffins. I think I could recite them both word for word by now, but I don't mind.. It's hard to find shows that are both entertaining and educational Wallykazam definitely fits that category.",1430956800,,510,4.268041237113402
7009086,5,B00TGNLUYW,"We have actually never seen Wallykazam live on Nickelodeon. We have seen commercials but never actually caught it live so my kids were excited to watch this DVD. It features four episodes featuring Wally and his friends. It is a cute wholesome show with cute lessons such as friendship, working together and problem solving. It is great because my kids can watch it anytime we want since we now have it on DVDs. I love that it is something new as well!

Wallykazam! includes the following episodes:

Naptime for Borgelorp  Wally uses magic words to help tire out Ogre Dougs hyper and unpredictable pet Borgelorp.
Castle Caper  Wally must oust Bobgoblin from a castle intended for his pet dragon, Norville.
Victor the Villain  While pretending to be superheroes, Wally and Norville decide they need a real villain to match wits with and conjure up, Victor the Villain.
The Switching Stone  Wally, Norville and Gina Giant find a magical switching stone thats a lot of fun until it turns Bobgoblin into a giant.",1430092800,16,1008,4.8313953488372094
7009087,5,B00TGNLUYW,"My boys loved this DVD.  It includes the episodes

7009093,5,B00TGNLUYW,"This is an excellent show. One of the best on television today. I wish there were whole seasons available on DVD. This DVD features four episodes and is good for a trip in the car or a visit to the grandparents' house. It reinforces the values of friendship and cooperation and emphasizes literacy in a fun and easy to understand way. It's an approach to phonics and sight reading that I wish we saw more of in children's television. Plus Norville, the dragon is adorable. Wally, wally, wallykazam!",1515974400,4,498,4.670454545454546

7009098,5,B00TGNLUYW,Wally is a parents dream cartoon. He isn't annoying like so many other cartoons these days. He teaches kids letters and sounds and how to spell. My 2 year old is recognizing letters and my 3 year old is starting to recognize sight words. I think this is largely due to Wally and Super Why. Definitely one the the best DVDS we have.,1501459200,,331,4.26984126984127
7009099,5,B00TGNLUYW,I bought this for my 2 year old son to take on vacation. We took our portable DVD player and this DVD on the airplane and it kept his super entertained for the entire flight. We also used it while we were at the hotel since they offered limited cable channels for children. He loves Wally Trollman and continuously laughs at Bob Goblin. It is a great show for they to learn words and rhymes and they tend to sing often and my son finds each episode very entertaining. I would buy again and would totally buy for other children in my life.,1501027200,,538,4.233009708737864

7009103,1,B00TGNLUYW,"Once you get desensitized to the slightly negative aspect that the secondary character Bobgoblin is pesky and deviant, modeling less-desirable sociological traits, Wallykazam is an awesome show.

I also don't agree with certain episodes, like on on this DVD entitled Victor the Villain.  Villain is a vile word.

My main issues is with how this particular DVD is sold.

When this product description says '2015', that would indicate Seasons 2 and 3 according to Amazon Video.
BUT, this DVD is in fact 2014, which is Season 1 (episodes I already own digitally)

The !!ONLY FOUR!! - EPISODES on this DVD:  Naptime for Borgelorp, Castle Caper, Victor the Villain, The Switching Stone (Season 2)

Nowhere in the product description or elsewhere does it say what you are actually getting in terms of videos.
All they need is to put a picture of the back of the DVD case, to show what episodes (only four! Not an entire season!)

It says that this video is from 2015, when in fact the DVD case says 2014.  I was trying to avoid purchasing videos I already owned digitally.
I was trying to get access to more episodes in a cheaper fashion, and this is seemingly the only DVD available, because you have to buy the episodes on Amazaon video otherwise.

So, I ended up buying this DVD, with no true information about what was on it, only to discover that I already own (3/4) of the episodes on the disk.",1493424000,,1394,4.630081300813008

7009245,3,B00TGNLUYW,My daughter loves this show so we got this DVD. Only problem is whoever mixed this sound did a terrible job. The voices come across super loud and you have to turn it down. The music is then barely audible. Maybe it was just my copy that was mixed wrong but it's disappointing. Our daughter likes to watch this in the car and it is still watchable just not as enjoyable without hearing the music. Other dvd's from Nickelodeon did not have this issue so it is the first time I've seen this.,1431129600,2,489,4.268817204301075
