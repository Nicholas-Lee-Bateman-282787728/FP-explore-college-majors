7977639,5,B00007KK12,This is a must for your Tolkien collection. The 3-D maps show the entire Middle Earth geography clearly. Now you can see the big picture of the hobbits complete travels.,1363392000,,169,4.666666666666667
7977640,2,B00007KK12,"It's not that detailed. Read the books. The maps are nice but would have been better if they had also drawn paths traveled. Better to get the Middle Earth Atlas book. The ""soundtrack"" after about 15 minutes was reduced to the same short musical phrase over and over and over...I wanted to tear my hair out. Only redeemed by the thoughtful insite of a few commentators. If you have not read the books it will entice you to read them (if the theatrical movies haven't). Peter Jackson is not on this DVD as an other reviewer implied. It does have bits of JRR himself. The Biography was good but also is on other DVDs. The Brothers Hildebrandt discuss their paintings but it would have been better if lead by an interviewer..they do babble on a bit. Quality of the DVD does not do the artwork justice (you need to see them in print).  A bit of a teaser to get the viewer to learn and see more.",1048636800,34,889,4.323353293413174
7977641,5,B00007KK12,"For anyone who wants a detailed explanation of the stories of J.R.R. Tolkien with some awesome maps to go along with it, this is the thing to watch.  It's like having the books read to you in a condensed yet thorough version, so you feel like you fully understand everything and it all comes together.",1047427200,4,301,4.472727272727273
