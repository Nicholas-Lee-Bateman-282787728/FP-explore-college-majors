470682,1,6302484464,"I love Hallmark movies and western type films, but this was disapointing. I thought the story was dull and the only interesting character was the guy who killed the two lovers at the end.

At least he put us out of our misery.

I found it unbelieveable that a strong woman like Alex would fall in love with such a weak and indecive young man.

The camara work was good and some of the locations was beautiful but I wouldn't waste your money. Over all this was a pointless and boring moving.",1108339200,7,490,4.304347826086956
470683,5,6302484464,"I thought this adaptation would have gotten a nod from Willa Cather.  The scenery was beautiful, the characters just as Willa Cather drew them in her book by the same title.  Jessica Lange was Alexandra with her quite dignity, and strong will and the chemistry between she and Carl was very believable.  Perhaps the best characters were Maria (Anne Heche) and Emile, who did a superb job at playing star crossed lovers.  I was very impressed with the screen play.  There were so many quotes from the book, who ever did it had a good sense of the book.  There were only two faults I found with the film and that was the casting of two characters.  I believe they could have found someone else to play the younger Alexandra.  Heather Graham seemed too stiff and her accent was always slipping.  The other character was the land. There should have been more shots of it.  The land was such a central part of the book.  It is what gave Alexandra her strength and her faith.
If one likes very accurate novels into film or period pieces and great actor/actress chemistry this is a great movie to watch.",1061510400,43,1096,4.5126903553299496

470850,5,6302484464,"This is is a visual feast of a movie, filled with great performances and a lot of historical eye candy. Yes, there are many scenes of the land, the prairie, the  views- thats because the story is  about the land!
 The scenery is both stark and beautiful and the stories are timeless, - love, greed, loneliness, passion, longing, tragedy and joy. You have to watch and listen, much of the dialogue is taken from the book and so it sounds like it is from another time, a different cadence, with the immigrant accented speech, and long gone local customs.  You will feel the cold of a winter on the Nebraska plains, the cutting wind as you bounce home over frozen ruts in an open wagon, to a sod and log house, and the never ending chores that await. l This film transports you back to take a close look at the pioneers who settled once the wagons stopped rolling and the ones who stuck and made something. You understand the generations of  our forebears and what it took to first endure, then prosper, to make this country. Roll through Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri or Iowa today and  think about this movie as you look out the window at the fields and cities. The performances are very good. Jessica Lange is perfect, and  Ann Heche is unrecognizable, playing  the spoiled, narcissistic desperately lonely and out of place  half of a pair of star crossed lovers, and check out who plays the part of the Jessica Lange  character as a girl. Great actress, before she got waif thin and went  Holly wood. Anyway, one of my favorites, and the  music is spot on, it is meant to be big and lush- like the land and the experience of being part of it.",1243036800,,1640,4.448160535117057
470851,1,6302484464,"After reading the book, I thought this dumb story might make more sense as a movie, but the flick was long on overwrought music and grand vistas and extremely short on substance.  There was a self importance to this Hallmark movie that promised so much more than it delivered.

I especially got tired of the same sweeping scene of ripe farmland that was shown over and over again, and the emotional theme music that was played over and over again, until my psyche was raw from the constant irritation.  This one melody and one scene seemed to be used as cheap filler for a story that did not have enough meat to justify the making of a movie.  I like lush cinema as much as the next person, but all this style without substance doesn't qualify in my opinion.  If there had been just one more long, lingering scene of ""amber waves of grain"", I think I would have screamed!

The acting is unbelievably hammy, complete with copious amounts of quivering lips and eyes brimming with tears.  Voices quaver as the characters wallow in sentimentality.  Nothing poignant, just sloppy overemoting.  The movie seemed to be going for an kind of ""Out of Africa"" feel, but didn't even come close.  (I liked OUT OF AFRICA.)

Since this is an enduring classic book, I expect there are a lot of people who appreciate it more than I did, but I can't see how anyone could like this movie.  My advice is to read the book, and if it captures your interest, then maybe (just MAYBE) you will get some enjoyment from the video.  However it is not for me.",1240358400,5,1530,4.48014440433213
470852,5,6302484464,This is one of many wonderful movies put out by Hallmark. Thw scenery is beautiful as well. There are several other titles available in their heartwarming tales.

470853,4,6302484464,"This is a gripping story that is well acted by all the cast, and is based on the book by Willa Cather. However, this isn't your 'typical' pioneer film. It's very touching, but the ending is very bittersweet. Alexandra's father dies and leaves the farm to her because she is the oldest and has the wisest judgement, even though she is the only girl in the family. Her mother is still alive, but has no interest in the land. Alexandra's brothers listen to her because of their father's command, but sadly really have very little respect for her. Her childhood sweetheart and kindred spirit, Carl, is a budding young artist and leaves town with his family to fulfill his dreams. I found these earlier scenes, played by younger actors to be very sweet and touching. After finding success and making the family rich, Alexandra has to settle issues of her heart when Carl returns 15 years later. She also tries to fulfill a promise to her mother that she will help her youngest brother find a career away from farm life.
Sensitive viewers please beware! This is the story of two couples who are separated and are re-united, one ends happily and the other very tragically. I had actually had nightmares after watching this, because it was such a beautiful love story but was rather disturbing in its outcome. Due to the mature storyline of this film & the tragedy, I would not recommend it for younger children. Parents may also find they have to discuss the meaning of adultery, etc. However, I love many of the scenes in this movie which is one reason why the ending was such a disappointment to me. This movie is definitely worthwhile though and has a good message.",1122854400,23,1661,4.633898305084746

7826327,3,6302484464,"This movie is based on the first story in Willa Cather's Great Plains trilogy and it closely follows the book of the same name.  The 3 stories are really standalones and can be read or watched in any order.  All contain themes in relation to life on the Great Plains, and the women of this world, during the turn of the 19th century. They were published in this order between 1913 and 1918:  O Pioneers!, The Song of the Lark, and My Antoni.  And yes, you can find movies made on all three books.

O Pioneers! is a simple story that broadly chronicles the life of a family of Swedish immigrants who work hard on their farm and ultimately reap the benefits. However, life in these times was often brutal and loss and death are just a part of their existence.  A standout element of this story is that the eldest daughter, Alexandra, inherits the land from her dying father and it's her vision, motivation, and intelligence that drive the upward and mobile destiny of her remaining family.

Some sub plots that go down here are a couple of lightly depicted romances between Alexandra and her elusive childhood friend Carl... and between Alexandra's youngest brother Emil and his childhood crush, the elusive Marie.

I personally classify the book as a Young Adult read... and find the Hallmark style movie adaptation to be rather fitting.  I would have enjoyed it most as a kid.  It's very innocent stuff, for the most part, and never gets overly dark or graphic in any way... despite some drama and romance that go down.  But it is rather bittersweet.  It's pioneer life, after all.

I was completely opposed to some of the casting when the movie started.  And when I saw dopey Heather Graham as the young Alexandra... ugh.  I love her to death as a ditzy blonde (lesbian), but after reading the book, I pictured Alexandra as someone altogether stronger, darker... and maybe more robust??  Maybe if I'd seen this when it came out in 1992 when she was more of an unknown I wouldn't care.  Love Jessica Lange as adult Alexandra... hated her weenie love interest in both the movie and the book, though... too beneath her.  And Anne Heche is just one of those detestable actresses I just can't stand, but if she had to be in this movie then her role as the teasing, flaky, trollop Marie is fitting, I suppose.  I really wanted more bad things to happen to her.

Overall, I found the book and movie to be rather dated stuff that hasn't aged too well.  It's not something I'd have picked up on my own if not for my classic lit book club (it's Willa Cather month).  I was glad to find this at my library.  But if you're a nice, sheltered family who enjoys old farm stories like Little House on the Prairie... this is the story for you. There be plenty of hot blondes you can secretly ogle while your kids stare at the crops and kittens.

Enjoy!!",1500940800,,2837,4.49609375
