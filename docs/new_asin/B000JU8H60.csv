8153241,4,B000JU8H60,"This low-budget Japan horror was probably shot with a Mini DV camcorder. When his daughter is murdered by a gang of thugs, her father commits a bloody suicide over a mannequin type doll he created of her. The human sized doll reanimates and goes after the thugs, and the murdered girls twin sister also makes an appearance to enact some revenge. We've got stuff like a throat slashing, a suicide, a couple of eyeball related violence, and some more stuff. There's no full frontal nude scenes, but there's a good amount of sexual content and nudity. The locations are nice with the villa, and it delivers some nice atmosphere in some parts. The film is obviously low-budget, but I thought they did a very good job with the limited amount of money they had to work with. It moves at a good pace and is easy to follow, and I liked the directing. There's no extreme gore in the film. Gore is present in parts, but the film isn't really gory overall. It is made with a small cast and takes place at and around this secluded villa. They picked this one nice area to shoot the movie, kept the plot simple, threw in a good amount of nudity, and delivered some pretty good death scenes with their restricted budget; although none of the deaths are over-the-top, so it isn't recommended if you're looking for extreme gore. The mannequin killer doll is also pretty cool and moves kind of like a robot. Just don't expect anything really elaborate about the film.

The DVD is in widescreen, but it's not anamorphic which is disappointing. The quality is kind of on the soft side, but it looks good overall. Brightness, color and contrast are fine. There's a short making of feature and trailers.",1415664000,,1682,4.588039867109635
8153242,4,B000JU8H60,"A young girl with an undisclosed illness is killed by drug dealers outside of her home. Her injured father and doll maker creates a doll full of revenge as the bad guys must go into the house to find their missing drugs.

This is a 1990's Japanese sexploitation film with some cult status. The production is listed as "" Ikenie"" (Sacrifice) at IMDB.

Includes an F-bomb written on the side of a boom box and ample amounts of sex and nudity (Tomomi Nishizaki, Momoko Nishida, Rie Kondoh).",1408579200,,486,4.574712643678161
8153243,4,B000JU8H60,"This isn't one of those slick shiny teen movies like ""The Locker."" It's grittier with a lower budget and plenty of funny sex scenes and blood. Not scary at all but still worth watching because it takes place in a beautiful remote villa not a cramped apt. Can't get the villa out of my mind and want to visit it ASAP!!!",1372723200,,318,4.229508196721311
8153244,3,B000JU8H60,"Not a bad entry coming out of Japan. A 1995 horror flick about a doll maker taking revenge on a group of thugs that kills his daughter by putting her spirit in a look-alike life-size doll. Really not scary but good enough to keep your attention. Plenty of nudity in a couple of sex scenes, which is always good in a horror film. From Tokyo Shock in a non-anamorphic widescreen, 2.0 surround, and english subtitles.",1369872000,,414,4.533333333333333
