Particulary one cut called ""ever changing times"" If  anyone can be of any assistance in helping me get this soundtack or single  song It would be greatly appreciated. thanks r brewer  rbrewer30@prodigy.net",946425600,4,354,4.966101694915254
466761,4,6302375770,"Baby Boom remains one of my favorite silly movies -- featuring so many enticing and amusing elements, it is like a terrific turkey sandwich the day after Thanksgiving, with loads of mayo.  Diane Keaton, always one of my  personal favorites, displays her usual charm and actually makes you laugh  out loud at many points throughout.  Her Tiger Lady is one of the best  caricatures of a shark-like corporate female ever, and her blossoming  softness, courtesy of that adorable baby girl, is a joy to behold.  The  settings, from the hustle-bustle of a cheerfully skewed Manhattan office  and environs, to the Christmas-card perfection (but don't be fooled!) of a  Vermont farmhouse, pull you in, and add color to a predictable but funny  plot.  Sam Shepard lends his trademark subtlety and attractiveness as a  Vermont vet.  This movie is hard to resist.",945388800,38,852,4.992857142857143
466762,4,6302375770,BABY BOOM IS A NICE FAMILY MOVIE. ITS A GOOD STORY AND THE SUPPROTING CAST DOES A GREAT JOB. SAM SHEPPARD IS ESPECIALLY GOOD IN HIS ROLE AND AS A LOVE INTEREST TO DIANE KEATON. THE STORY OF A MANHATTANITE WHO ENDS UP IN  VERMONT LEADS TO A LOT OF COMIC SITUATIONS. I SHOULD KNOW... I LIVE IN  MANHATTAN AND THEY FILMED THE MOVIE NEXT TO MY HOUSE IN VERMONT. IN FACT  THE GENERAL STORE REALLY EXISTS AND IS 50 YARDS FROM MY FRONT DOOR!,944784000,,434,4.08235294117647

466985,3,6302375770,Good film but somewhat compromised by a horrid soundtrack recording. The music actually distracts from the fine acting and strong script. Keaton sorely someone to help advise regarding appropriate soundtrack music. The rural scenes had potential to be strengthened by some Americana or rootsy music; instead we get mind-numbingly banal Kenny G sounds.,1509840000,,351,5.6415094339622645

466987,5,6302375770,"I enjoyed this movie years ago, and can't wait to have it on DVD. The plot reminds me of that of Three Men and a Baby. Although, instead of three clueless men trying to take care of a baby, this is a clueless career- oriented woman trying to take care of a baby she inherited, while growing attached in the process. Diane Keaton is lovely in this movie, and the baby adorable.",1508889600,,376,4.236111111111111

467113,5,6302375770,"I'm just an uneducated Baby Boomer. I'm not into Women's Lib or anything like that.  I like movies because I enjoy them.  I have always liked Ms Keaton since ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" and Baby Boom wasn't disappointing at all.  I just watched it today and my gosh it was made 30yrs ago!

You can think of this movie like Rocky III. A comfortable champ is knocked off her throne and deals with the pitfalls of starting over.  JC is vulnerable, intelligent and a bit awkward as a new mother. To see her and Elisebeth move to the country is something I did, having lived in Silicon Valley most of my life.  Living the country life is just like anything else in life, you get used to it.  JC did and flourished.  Sam Shepard's role as the country vet was perfect. The ending was kind of expected, but I cheered for her in her choice of lifestyles.  I think everyone would enjoy this movie, especially one who like seeing the Underdog win in the end",1490659200,,944,4.348571428571429
467114,5,6302375770,"Love it!  Finally, a beautiful movie which shows the love and sacrifice of a mother for her child.  Putting family first above everything else is both courageous & brave.  Well done Diane Keaton; you are a jewel!!",1489795200,,213,4.702702702702703

467156,5,6302375770,This is a classic,1488931200,,17,3.5
467157,5,6302375770,"Just watched 'Baby Boom' again after last seeing it about 15 years ago.  It is classically wonderful Nancy Meyers.  Diane Keaton plays the lovable, insecure, hyper intelligent, flawed heroine in that way only she can.  Sam Shepard was the perfect choice for the hunky Veterinarian love interest.  Is the storyline aged?  Sure.  Is it a little over the top in places?  Entertainingly so.  I just love the final boardroom scene and the way the actors react to Diane's character's decision -- totally chauvinistic and fun.  The twin girls who share the part of Elizabeth the baby are adorable.  What a great way to spend a rainy afternoon.",1488672000,3,636,4.859813084112149
467158,5,6302375770,Great movie. excellent story line.,1488067200,,34,6.0
467159,1,6302375770,This movie is awful and embodies everything prejudicial about women and careers. It is definitely not amusing to see her effectively getting fired for getting interests outside of work (or a child in this case). I do not recommend it and wish that this film did not just ruin my evening.,1487808000,,287,4.647058823529412

467162,3,6302375770,"30 year old movie shows it. All white cast except for stereotype Islamic woman in burkha plus a brief photo of Whoopi Goldberg. Supposedly an empowering women movie but drips with sexism throughout. Keaton breakdown hysteria scenes in the middle are over the top embarrassing. Only a handful of funny bits, rest is totally predictable mostly baby gags. Baby in film is special needs, has rare disorder where it never ages.",1487203200,,422,4.957746478873239

However, when I opened the package (and it was still sealed & new) it was scratched and wouldn't play right.  I ordered a second and when it gets towards the end of the movie, it starts skipping and goes back to the beginning of the movie! :(  I guess this one will be going back as well and I might just have to watch it on my Amazon Prime videos online.",1487030400,3,450,3.858695652173913

467366,2,6302375770,"Kind of a boring cliche movie. The whole plot confounds me, as she accepts this child of a distant relative she hadn't met in 30 years in the span of 10 seconds and is willing to uproot her whole life, including her long term relationship, her executive job, and her New York lifestyle. She does ridiculous things like bring the child to work and act's so dimwitted in meetings that an executive would never be dumb or naive enough to do. The whole movie felt like it was built on a joke of a premise. And at the end, the setup was just too cliche with her going back to her old company, giving up an offer of a lifetime, just so that she could stick it to them. Overall an awful movie.",1486252800,,686,4.165413533834586

To turn it and the community into a business success is far fetched these days. Not impossible but pretty challenging. The realities did not cloud my enjoyment.  After all it is a movie to entertain.  The actress is one of my favorites. I love the sincerety she brings to all her roles. One of my favorite ""feel good"" movies.

You may not have any problems with the movie if you haven't seen more than one or two Keaton movies; but if you have, you may be disappointed with her decades-long continuation of the slightly nerdy, quirky and spastic protagonist.

Wiatt, an uber-successful, nose-to-the-grindstone, New York executive, with all the smart parts and the so-relatable vulnerabilities. That awkwardness, in this case jittery legs, some filter failure, occasional outbursts of frustration, great smarts and repartee, and a healthy, though nearly dormant, libido render her a really winning character. She's, so far, settled for professional achievement, 4 minute sex with a self-important, one-dimensional, also high-achieving, loser. Then an inheritance is on its way, not money, but adorable baby Elizabeth, the progeny of a very distant, now deceased cousin. At first overwhelmed by the newcomer, then demoted on the job, J.C. and Elizabeth take off for the Vermont farmhouse and apple orchard whose photo she's filed away and only dreamed of. Sam Shepard is just right in his performance. What happens next remains to be seen. This is a delightful film, funny. clever, romantic, and easy on the psyche.",1483315200,5,1004,5.4423076923076925

468896,5,6302375770,"Back in the 80's the choice was the same as it is today.  You still can't have it all.  Since I'm someone who chose motherhood over a career it's a guilty pleasure watching Diane Keaton fumble the ball for awhile before realizing she actually likes being a mother.  She discovers the nurturer within and embraces it for what it is.  The message of the movie is, ""You can't have it all, but you can have most of it.""  Although I disagree with the premise, I loved the matter-of-fact way JC embraces the change in herself.

I would, however, like to add that one child does allow a woman to have somewhat of a career.  That's why feminists only have one child.  Never more than that.  One child makes parenting a sort of hobby.  Any more than that and you have to be ""in"" all the way.  In fact parenthood is just one more merit badge for the feminist to check off.  (Yeah, I've done that!)  But one child is kind of like having a pet.  Find a good babysitter, spend some quality time and presto!  You're a parent!

Well, Diane, maybe nobody should have to choose (I refer to her speech at the end) but that is the way things are.  JC had to choose between a glamorous career and a not-so-glamorous one, but never once did she consider putting the child first.  I guess that's for the rest of us who do things the old fashioned way in the right order.

By the way, I loved the baby.  How did they get a one-year-old to act?",1464220800,,1420,4.247191011235955

470126,5,6302375770,"I had seen this on TV a few times and liked it every time.  So, I bought it from Amazon. Diane Keaton plays a very successful advertising agent in a large firm.  But there is a glitch when she ""inherits"" a baby from a distant relative who dies. Of course, learning how to  juggle a baby and career does not go over well with her bosses.  She is gradually demoted as a cloy to get her to quit.  So, she does and moves to Vermont.  She creates gourmet baby food which is wildly successful nationwide.  Of course, her prior agency tries to woo her back with money, etc. saying they could help her better with distribution, etc.  After they overwhelm her with a stunning amount of money and perks, she realizes she likes living in Vermont and having her baby with her without having to worry about office politics.  She sticks it out and the company is a success with her as the sole owner. Warm fuzzy and it gently hits a female nerve that women are penalized for having babies and not being able to hold their high level jobs. You root for her all the way.

470310,5,6302375770,"Although clearly set in the 80s, this fabulous movie is a wonderful story and appropriate for any decade.  Diane Keaton stars as the ""tiger lady"", a ruthless executive in charge of everyone and everything she lays her hands on.  By way of a deceased relative, she inherits a small child which takes a large toll on her career and personal life.
After eventually deciding to give motherhood a try, she departs Manhattan for greener pastures in the form of a large orchard and farm in rural Vermont.
This is a typical fish-out-of-water story, but Keaton does a masterful job with the well written script.  Ideal for dates or family viewing, this amusing film is well directed and well cast - a truly timeless story that will warm your heart.",1389139200,,739,4.713178294573644

470360,5,6302375770,"Watching this movie was like opening up a time capsule. The career woman with skirt suits, wide shoulder pads, bow-tied blouses, and pointed heels with a baby on one hip and lugging a briefcase was ME !  Of course, I didn't acquire my baby as a result of a bequeath from a distant relative; but nevertheless I could relate to trying to keep the career going while attempting to find reliable daycare and being taken seriously at the office. Diane Keaton is at her lovable best with all her quirks and habits as the committed workaholic career woman at the top of her game - until she acquires a beautiful baby girl from a distant relation. She decided immediately to put the baby up for adoption, but suddenly changed her mind when she saw the decidedly low class couple that was slated to adopt her; she knew she could give baby Elizabeth a better life.

The baby Elizabeth was perfectly cast (played by twin girls) and was utterly adorable. After getting squeezed out of the major project JC (Keaton) was destined to manage, she quits her high powered job in NYC in a fit of pique and buys an old house with property in Vermont. The maintenance problems suck up all of her cash, and she turns to making baby food (applesauce) to fill her time and make a little money and fill her idle hours. After some visiting yuppies snap up multiple jars of the ""Country Baby"" sauce at a local gift shop, she alights on the idea of promoting the brand more widely. She also meets the hunky local veterinarian, Sam Shepard, (the only man under 50 in the whole area). Of course, since she's an aggressive, high-powered businesswoman, her venture soon becomes a huge success. This is a feel good movie with a fun plot, and is a great snapshot of life 25 years ago.",1388620800,,1750,4.5

She starts out as an executive in a prestigious ad firm, and ends up in Vermont, developing a delectable baby apple sauce. Throughout all her ordeals, she will have you laughing, but rooting for her. I love this movie, and fell in love with Vermont, at the same time. You won't regret getting this one.",1383609600,,415,4.473684210526316
470544,3,6302375770,"This movie had some cute, funny parts. Diane Keaton makes it enjoyable.

It's not bad but feels likes it is too long. To give you a sense, there are separate montages to depict her home business booming and her acclimating to country life that could of easily been rolled into one. Then there are multiple separate scenes that communicate the idea that the company is slowly replacing her because of her lack of focus. They could of had one scene do this. Also she gives a speech in the end about her life choices that could hardly of held the interest of the board members she was addressing.
So, don't worry about pausing the movie if you have to get up for something. You'll be given another chance to catch the plot-point.

Apparently, this movie gives a good look at what a feminist of the 80's would want out of life. She wanted to work long hours at a high powered job like any man, and then have a man in her house when she came home. AND she also wanted to be responsible for a baby that she doesn't ever really seem to particularly enjoy. It's just more work.

Not that I was expecting romantic, but you can't call the second love interest here a romance either. He actually says something to the effect that they are the only two non-elderly people in the whole county, so we might as well make the best of it.
I thought it was a little tacky to have baby point to the man tooling around the kitchen in a bathrobe and say ""Dada"", only to have Mommy say ""Oh No! This isn't your Daddy hahaha"" But I guess what else is she going to say.",1383264000,,1544,4.262798634812286

She finds a target market for her new hobby, and does what she does best. Her old bosses notice her success, and she is again faced with the decision to go back to the city life, or stay on her small-town Vermont farm.

470731,4,6302375770,"Up to a a point I love watching this movie.  If only I could edit out the creepy, provincial, emotionless vet, and the horribly sexually aggressive car hood scene, and the final scenes where J.C. flutters her eyelashes and her final words regarding her success come down to having a man.

The message of the film is that, when push comes to shove, so to speak, the most successful, happiest women feel incomplete without even the scuzziest man - but even if it were an appealing man - the message is the same. (""You're a big girl now...""??!! stated by company executive and J.C. lets this slide?), and it needn't have.  And it's a guarantee that within six months, J.C. will be happy to sell so she has more time to tend to her ma-an.

Contrast this story and resolution with that of 'The Associate', or even, 'Down With Love', or 'Pat and Mike' and other Hepburn/Tracy movies.  Margaret Rutherford and Stringer Davis...  and, maybe a few regular people who aren't in show business?  I don't know them.",1363651200,,1002,4.595505617977528
470732,4,6302375770,"Chalk it up to ""It's just one of those things"" but, for whatever reason, I hadn't much ran into films featuring Diane Keaton. I just now saw BABY BOOM, never mind that I'd been aware of it peripherally since its box office release back in 1987. For the umpteenth time, I remind myself to check out more of this actress's work. BABY BOOM kept my eyeballs locked on the telly screen.

J.C. Wiatt (Keaton) perches on top of the food chain. She is a ruthless boardroom executive. J.C. Wiatt graduated with top honors in Yale, earned an MBA from Harvard. Her salary runs six figures a year. Her Manhattan corner office overlooks the corner of 58th and Park. And she's about to make partner. So when her barely recollected cousin, whom she hadn't seen since 1954, dies in an accident and bequeaths his 13-month-old girl to her care, J.C. Wiatt isn't exactly brimming over with familial resolve.

BABY BOOM starts out as a caustic satire on corporate ambition, and so I settled in, anticipating a film rife with edgy observations. There's also that good sub-text that factors in a woman in the role of corporate shark. J.C. Wiatt is a workaholic, punching in twelve to fourteen hours a day. She lives for the thrill of the kill, the satisfaction of landing the big account. Her unexpected inheritance threatens to upend her lifestyle. She quickly learns how hard it is to juggle abrupt motherhood and a demanding career. But, damn, that surely is one cute and very agreeable baby (played by Kristina & Michelle Kennedy).

It's farfetched that J.C. and her lived-in beau (Harold Ramis), even as ignorant of child care as they are, would feed the baby gourmet pasta. We're treated to fun gags like J.C.'s applying electrical tape to secure the baby's diapers and J.C.'s checking the baby in at the restaurant coat check room as she heads in for her power lunch. But the baby is so adorable, it's inevitable that J.C. grows to love her. In that instance, the tone shifts from wicked satire to something more sweet and fuzzy wuzzy and Frank Capraesque. Don't get me twisted, BABY BOOM is entertaining from start to finish, although you may have to tweak your mindset. There's juicy fun in watching Diane Keaton play the hard-charging executive but then downshift to caring mom and frustrated, weepy woman. James Spader pops in and does his patented slimy yuppie routine. Sam Shepard enters late in the game as Keaton's potential love interest. What? You didn't think Harold Ramis had it in him, did you? It's freakin' Harold Ramis.

The film takes great pains to shelter Keaton's character from the harsh realities of the world. And maybe that's the one glaring hole in the narrative. The earlier Frank Capra reference wasn't dropped in 'cause I was going for the champion film buff trophy. Huge chunks of BABY BOOM come off like a fairy tale. ***SPOILER ALERT now for this 1987 comedy*** Keaton's character doesn't sacrifice anything by turning her back on her career to become a mom. In fact, her life-altering decision paves the way for her gaining even wilder success. See, a modern woman can have it all, the career, the baby, the romance. Or maybe it's only Diane Keaton who can do this.",1363651200,2,3182,4.748643761301989

I have watched it countless times and I still never get tired of it.  I watched it again last night and it still feels as fresh as the first time I saw it.  Sure the film is a bit dated but you have to remember it was released in 1987 (which is actually part of its charm).  However the film itself has definitely withstood the test of time, and it is really a shame that they just don't make films with quality talent like this anymore.  The script, acting, directing, production is all superb in this film.  I won't go into all the details about the plot of the film since it has already been discussed by many other reviewers.

One of the things I love about the film is the scenes in Vermont which are absolutely beautiful.  Diane Keaton plays a hard-driven career woman who leaves NYC for a quieter life in rural Vermont.  I think the reason this film works so well is that so many of us have had this same fantasy: escape the crazy rat race of the big city and get back to a more simpler, relaxing way of life.  I have always dreamed of doing that and I won't give up on that dream!  There is more to life than making money and I think that is the real point of the film.

It demonstrates vividly how fortunes can turn on a dime, but more importantly how, what may look like a devestating setback, may be a blessing in disguise.  The kind of feel good movie that shows what determination can achieve.  Diane Keaton's performance is outstanding.  The kind of performance we've come to expect from her and she doesn't disappoint one bit.  Highly recommend taking another look at this classic.",1274140800,3,458,4.973684210526316

Keaton is all over this film; she is funny, she is maddingly aggressive, she is tender, she is caustic, she is passionate, she is aloof, she is approachable, she makes you smile, she makes you cry. She runs the full range of emotions, but they are never forced and quite believable. If you think from this description that I'm a true fan of this movie, then you have hit the lottery. Writer/director Nancy Meyers hits on all cylinders as she has on almost every film with which she has been associated. She writes plots and characters that are so real that one has the feeling that he or she is listening and observing words and situations as they are actually occurring. The team of Keaton and Meyers make up the best team of female actor and director in Hollywood today.

470885,4,6302375770,"This is actually one of my favorite films from the 80's. Diane Keaton couldn't be more perfect as the hard-pressed ""cold, career women"" that thanks to an unexpected ""inheritance,"" learns many lessons about living in the fast ... and slow lanes.

Diane's characterization of conflicting intentions after coming out of the adoption agency is one of the best on film and Nancy Meyers/Charles Shyer carry a consistent and quality film that we often don't see today. There is actually a story and arc here --- not a ""Citizen Cane,"" but nonetheless, fulfilling from beginning to end.

Additionally, there are some terrific performances in this rather overlooked gem, specifically from Keaton, but also from the twin actresses that played 'Elizabeth.' Of course, I'm sure this was due to some immense ""luck"" by directer, Shyer in capturing the absolute PERFECT look from a 10-11 month old (or whatever age they were); however, 'Elizabeth's' look at Keaton in the adoption agency about tears my heart out.

There are so many wonderful scenes in this film, I could go on an on. Despite the above, this is a true comedy and a well written one --- that doesn't push the humor in your face or try to reach with grossness, however I laugh out loud often. Many call this a ""chick flick,"" well ... I am a man, and this is one film I enjoy over and over. It is a charming movie that puts me and my family in a better mood every time we watch it.

The ONLY reason I gave it four stars here (it deserves 5) is because of the DVD transfer. It is AWFUL. Anyone out there know how to convince these studios to give us BETTER transfers of films that, although may not blockbusters, are still as valued by many who appreciate quality work and a wonderful story? It seems that they used an old television pan and scan copy and then letter-boxed it. Why? It's worse than you can sometimes find on television (as the very bottom and top of all frames are cropped). If you get a chance, copy it from AMC (however, I wish they would convert to HD).

Nevertheless, it will usually look better than this DVD, but ... DON'T miss this lovely charmer. You'll feel GOOD at the end. If you don't, and I say this honestly, you have no heart. Ha!",1263168000,2,2209,4.526315789473684

This is an interesting film in that she has to change characters so many times.  At first a hard working first class wealthy business woman, then a mom who hasn't the slightest idea of how to take of a baby she inherits and finally a gal whose moved to the NE in a house she saw in the newspaper, and where her roof caves in in the middle of winter, her well runs dry and just about everything that could go wrong with this house she's bought in Vermont brings her to the point of poverty. Close to a nervous break down, she changes course again.

She makes a come back, and with her orchard begins to make baby apple sauce.  Tons of it, and it sells, and sells and sells, and next thing we know, she's been called back to her old job in NY where she's presented with her great come back.  But she turns it down.

She plays the role of the hyperactive businesswoman who suddenly is confronted with the responsibility for a child. I have always wondered a bit at the somewhat contrived adoption story but I assume that having her own child would have drawn the tale out too much. Anyway, it's comedy and comedy allows contrived plot devices. She eventually is faced with the collapse of her career and the loss of her boyfriend (no great loss as Harold Ramis plays him). She decides to move to Vermont. I have lived in New Hampshire and got a kick from her troubles coping with country life. The best part was when her well ran dry and the plumber tells her she's out of water. She tells him there is a hose right over there and they should fill the well up with it. Hilarious. Eventually, she meets Sam Shepard and, after the usual misunderstandings, they get together. The story of her baby food empire is apparently based on a true story and brings her back to business success without compromising her mothering.

Thinking that she has no maternal instincts whatsoever, and vowing that she has no aspirations toward motherhood, she is forced to re-evaluate her priorities when she ""inherits"" six month old Elizabeth.  J.C. encounters the usual pitfalls of suddenly becoming a parent - think Three Men and a Baby trying to put on that first diaper.  Of course, she warms to Elizabeth and her new role, and even moves out of the city seeking the serenity of the country life.  Rural Vermont proves to be more of a challenge for J.C. than she expected and she inadvertently starts a business that could lead her back to the top of her game.  But does she really want that life again?  Would it be worth going back to, and would she have to give up the new life she has come to love?

470993,4,6302375770,"BABY BOOM is a classic 80's comedy which capatalised on timely issues for women of the period, but remains a relevant and very funny movie.

Diane Keaton plays J.C. Wiatt, a high-powered New York businesswoman, known as the Tiger-Lady, who ""inherits"" Elizabeth, the orphaned toddler of a long-forgotten distant cousin.  J.C. valiantly tries to juggle Elizabeth with her hectic career before she's politely told to leave the office...for good.  Undaunted, J.C. bundles up the baby and heads for Vermont, but it's not long until she starts climbing the corporate ladder once more...

BABY BOOM attempts to answer the age-old question ""Can women have it all?"", and the entire film, whilst firmly-rooted in the world of 80's big-business and the consumer generation, still has a lot to offer viewers of a new century.  Diane Keaton glows as J.C., a role she seems effortlessly suited to.  The supporting cast (Sam Shepard, Harold Ramis, James Spader, Mary Gross and Sam Wanamaker) is first-rate.

470994,4,6302375770,"Sorry some reviewers thought this movie was a waste of time -- not every Diane Keaton film can be an Oscar winner.  Baby Boom, however, succeeds in touching the heart of anyone who has had such a driven and hectic corporate career that the notion of burping a bouncing baby on your lap is as foreign as learning to write backwards!

When J.C. Wyatt, a successful ad executive, ""inherits"" baby Elizabeth after an unfortunate accident claims the baby's parents (J.C.'s cousin), she is forced to manage the demands of runny noses, changing diapers (what a great scene where she actually reads the directions on the package to figure out how to put the diaper on!) along with the cut throat corporate climbers in the male-dominated world of advertising.

There are scenes so heartwarming it will bring tears to your eyes, like when J.C. falls asleep cuddling baby Elizabeth when she is sick, or when the prospective adoptive parents are so rigid and heartless that they aren't ""getting a boy"" it sends J.C. flying out the door, baby in tow, ready to give it another try.  Even if you are not a parent, you will appreciate J.C.'s hysteria over finding the right babysitter, the proper medicine, and just about every toy known to toddlers.

James Spader is the sly fox colleague who steals J.C.'s accounts out from under her before she makes the decision to leave New York City behind and settle into a Vermont ""dream house"" with Elizabeth.  After numerous mishaps with the house, nearly going broke on repairs and battling a brutal Northern winter, J.C. stumbles upon a golden idea to sell her homemade baby food to the local shops.  Alas she is financially on top again, and really loving being a mom.  She meets and falls for the town vet, learns to love the ""simple life"" and makes her new life a success all its own....till Manhattan calls upon her once again to wimpishly try winning her back.

True to form, J.C. accepts a business meeting where the stuffy suits offer her a fortune to take over her Country Baby label.

There's really no giving away anything in this movie since it's all very predictable, but it's still sweet and heartwarming, and you'll love the precious little actress cast as Elizabeth.

Baby Boom is an old favorite, and good fun for new parents, especially when they're fresh out of their corporate career modes.

She begins making baby food which sells like hotcakes, and meets Sam Shepard, a local vetinarian and down-to-earth guy. Given a chance to return to NYC with her baby food, she decides to stay on the farm. Totally unbelievable from the git-go, and Keaton is at her obnoxious worst.",1111708800,7,541,4.645833333333333

It's amusing to watch Diane Keaton and spouse cooped up in a miniscule, overpriced  Manhattan co-op filled with chrome and glass furniture and talk about how much money they make and how many hours per week they work.  If you are the sort who likes watching dozens of women in dorky dark skirts and helmet hair trotting to their next power lunch, this movie is for you, Mister (or Sister).  The script achieves a few high points in its unintended humor (or irony) when we hear that Diane is paid ""zillions"" a year to tell investors that a company must trim ""operating expenses"" in order to ""become profitable"".
Into this odd ""business is evil"" morality play comes a baby for whom Diane eventually develops maternal feelings, as well as a rugged country dude who can give her what she ""really needs"".

470998,5,6302375770,"Diane Keaton shines in this wonderful comedy about a working woman who inherits a baby from a cousin she ""hasn't seen since 1954.""  Keaton portrays J.C. Wiatt, a Management Consultant who never stops working.  Then she finds out that her cousin, in his will, left her his baby daughter Elizabeth (played by Michelle and Christine Kennedy, who are too cute!) to care for.  At first, J.C. does not want to have anything to do with having a baby.  She's too wrapped up in work.  The turning point to me is when Elizabeth gets sick and J.C. has to care for her.  It is then that you can tell that she starts to bond with Elizabeth.  Unfortunately, Steven (Harold Ramis), the man who she lives with, doesn't agree with this situation and leaves.  Eventually, J.C. finds herself paying more attention to Elizabeth than with work which does not make her boss (Sam Wanamaker) too happy.  He decides to lower J.C.'s status in the company and promotes Ken (James Spader) to her status.  J.C. decides that she should move.  Also, the transformation Diane makes from full-time worker to full-time mom is great.  I do believe that Diane Keaton show her maternal side in this film.  She is so natural with children.
What happens next is so sweet.  She moves to this Vermont home where everything you can think of goes wrong, she gets ""yupped"" and ""noped"" by everyone there, and basically goes crazy and vows she will go back to New York.  But then she meets Dr. Cooper (Sam Shepard) and everything slowly changes for her.  As a romance begins, so does another career move for J.C.  She invents 'Gormet Baby Food' which the Food Chain, where she used to work, wants to buy.  The ending is wonderful.  I loved it.  I'm not going to give that away...If you want to know the ending, rent the movie.  You won't be disappointed!",1059436800,15,1808,4.605015673981192

Diane Keaton plays J.C. Wiatt a hugly successful business woman in the 80's. And works for a huge advertising company. In the process of almost making partner in the company she recieves an inheritence from some cousins she hasn't seen in ages. It turns out it's a baby girl Elizabeth. Now she's conflicted of working but at the same time deciding to give up Elizabeth for being a partner or possibly doing both. She learns that she just can't give up with Elizabeth and she has fallen in love with her. However, she learns it's too hard to work full time in a demanding business and raise a baby girl at the same time.
So they move to a country side where quite a few things go wrong. A city girl in the country trying to make it on her own and raising a baby girl. She then starts a business on her own which can land her back at her old business.
It's got a great cast with: Diane Keaton who's really amazing in this role, and other's such as: Harold Ramis (Ghostbusters), Sam Shepard (Black Hawk Down), James Spader, and many more noticable stars. In the start of the movie the narrorator is none other than newswoman Linda Ellerbee.
The DVD I was a bit disappointed in it's only got a theatrical trailer and not much else. I was hoping maybe for some interviews and behind the scene's. So if your a fan you can still get the VHS version or if your a DVD collector then this is a good movie to add to your collection.

Diane Keaton is the perfect role model as today's sophisticated female trying to cope with the naggings of her biological time clock and the demands of a successful career. This story is amazingly realistic if you can overlook the sudden inheritance of a small child being dumped into Diane's lap! But all that is forgotten as Diane struggles with the choice of giving the child up for adoption. In a moment every female will relate to, the decision is made...and Diane makes the transition from city to country life to raise her little girl. What initially seemed like the perfect peaceful environment transforms into the harsh reality of isolated rural living. Her home becomes a virtual ""money pit"", requiring constant repairs, and her nerves become strained with the lack of male companionship. The most hysterical scene of the movie is Diane's emotional breakdown when her pent up frustration is inadvertently lashed out upon Sam Shepherd, who is perfectly cast as the local vet. I dare say any woman could resist the charms of this country doc, least of all our lovely heroine...though she puts up a good fight to begin with.

471046,3,6302375770,"As anyone who has walked a mile or two knows, life is about choices and making decisions.  And a lot of that has to do with realizing and setting priorities, because-- as a wise person once said-- You Can't Have It All.  It's the lesson we all learn in our own way in our own time, according to our own personal situation, and director Charles Shyer examines one of them in his amiable comedy, ""Baby Boom,"" starring Diane Keaton.
 J.C. Wiatt (Keaton) is a high-powered businesswoman on the fast track to success; she knows what she wants, has set her priorities, and a partnership in the firm for which she works is on the horizon.  Her live-in significant other, Steven (Harold Ramis), is of a like mind-set, so they complement one another's life style perfectly.  Marriage and/or having children is in neither of their respective vocabularies.  then one day, J.C. ""inherits"" a baby, the child of a distant relative (a cousin she'd met only once) who has been killed in a tragic accident, and suddenly, J.C.'s world is turned upside down.  Keeping the baby is out of the question, of course.  Or is it?  For J.C., it just may not be as simple as it seems, initially.  She's been living life on her own terms, but now she is once again faced with choices, decisions and setting priorities.  And along the way, she learns one of life's most important lessons:  The fact that the lesson never ends.
 There's some amusing moments and some insights to be gleaned from Shyer's film, and overall it's a pleasant, enjoyable experience.  It is not, however, an entirely original idea, and Shyer laces it with stereotypes and cliches to boot.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, though.  If his characters are stereotypical, it's because they reflect a certain realism.  J.C.'s boss, Fritz Curtis (Sam Wanamaker), for instance, typifies the image of a dedicated, hard-core businessman whom you get the feeling has to consult his day planner to work in an appointment with his own family.  A stereotype?  Perhaps.  A reflection of reality?  Definitely.  The same can be said for Sam Shepard's character, Dr. Jeff Cooper, who personifies the general image of one in his situation.  And again, it is a reflection of reality, stereotypical though it may be.
 Even the cliches are handled in a way that makes them fresh enough to work within the context of the story, and be appreciated-- especially by those in the audience who may have experienced any of the situations presented here.  When J.C. fumbles with a diaper and becomes frustrated with her own inexperience and incompetence with such things, it's cliche, but it also rings true-to-life.  The important thing is, it's all well presented and actually pretty funny stuff, even if it isn't anything new.
 Shyer wrote the screenplay, along with Nancy Meyers, and one angle they may have failed to cultivate fully has to do with Ken, the character played by James Spader.  As J.C.'s in-house adversary, also striving to climb the corporate ladder, it may have been intrinsically more interesting had the character been a woman.  The fact that Ken is a man, again, makes this particular situation fairly cliche; whereas a competitive conflict with another woman, considering J.C.'s predicament, would have expanded the avenues of possibility to a much greater extent, and certainly would have provided a more imaginative perspective.
 The main reason the film works as well as it does, however, is because of the engaging performance by Diane Keaton.  In J.C., she creates the antithesis of Annie Hall, but even at her most demanding there is a hint of vulnerability in J.C., a softness to that hard exterior edge she uses to shoulder her way through the business world.  Keaton gives you a real sense of the conflict she's experiencing, and though it's lightheartedly rendered for the most part, you understand the underlying seriousness of it all.  And the scene in which she vents her frustrations and bares her soul to Dr. Cooper is classic.  Keaton's work is without question the highlight of the film, and what really brings it to life.
 The supporting cast includes Pat Hingle (Hughes Larabee), Britt Leach (Verne), Kim Sebastian (Robin), Mary Gross) Charlotte, Patricia Estrin (Secretary)Victoria Jackson (Eve), Jane Elliot (Park Mom) and Linda Ellerbee (Narrator).  An upbeat, entertaining film, ""Baby Boom"" may not be particularly memorable, but it does provide some laughs, and at the same time says something about the value of being given the opportunity to question the things we ""think"" we want.  Kind of like saying ""Never say never.""  After all, who can say with any certainty where destiny may lead any of us?  It's something a film like this may make you consider, inbetween the chuckles.  It's the magic of the movies.",1010880000,28,4782,4.921348314606742

471048,1,6302375770,"The idea behind this movie was really great. Imagine the tiger lady who became a devoted mother....  This film was supposed to show us that family and children are more important than all the money and any career in the world. It was supposed to show some humor, make people laugh, and warm one's heart. But it failed to accomplish anything!
First of all, she did not transform from business lady to a mother. The movie showed me a bright and sharp working woman who was transformed to a humiliated and miserable creature. She was taken from her regular life style in New York City to this far away country, a forest, were she does not belong, where she does not have anyone. She met there a vet whom she did not like to begin with and who completely had nothing to do with her. But eventually she ""fall in love"" with him ONLY because he was the only single man under sixty around! The character of this guy was absolutely not developed; we are not shown anything about him. He behaved like a piece of wood; he expressed nothing....
 Because this movie was unable to SHOW us all this. The movie did not show us how she loved Vermont. It did not show us that her baby was happy there. It did not show us clearly that she was a TIGER lady. This why it had explicitly to tell us all this through the voice behind the screen or through her final speech. What a poor job! The plot has too many holes. She purchased a home in VERMONT? She could buy the same house in upstate New York or in Long Island and continue her job in the same company without sacrificing her life style. She could not find a normal baby sitter in New York? Give me a break!

She's never disappointed me in any of her movies, counting this one. Keaton's character, J.C. Wiatt, shows a fabulous transition from a tiger lady to a doting mother.  My favorite scenes were the ones in the airport, when Wiatt first learns she has a baby on her hands, when she yells at the plumber at the well, when she confesses all her problems to the vet (Shepard), when Shepard rescues her, and finally the ending- it's so sweet and so unpredictable. This movie emits warm vibes,and is a must-see during a snowy night with the lights turned off. The only complaints I have about this movie is that Shepard's character should have shown a little more emphasis on what he should have been doing. I excepted him to be a witty,teasing character. And while he is, it isn't seen very well. I wanted more conversations between those two, a little vulnerability.

471053,5,6302375770,"I'm not much of a Diane Keaton fan.  In fact, I have not liked any of her movies, except Baby Boom.  This was a miracle movie about a woman who was married to her job, sleeping with a man who was married to his job, and not  interested in getting married on paper to each other.  Keaton had no  parenting skills, had never even held a baby.  You could tell that when she  carried Baby Elizabeth under her armpit into the restaurant right after  receiving her off the airplane.
Needless to say, she fell in love with  this little girl after she helped nurse her back to health after a cold.  She couldn't even give her up at the adoption agency.  Therefore, she lost  her so-called boyfriend because he didn't like kids.
Things got better  and worse at the same time.  She loved her job, people even called her The  Tiger Lady because she worked more hours than she relaxed.  But as she was  becoming more accustomed to being a mommy, she was slowly phased out of her  accounts by corporate rats, mainly played by James Spader, ""the little  pischer"" as J.C. Wyatt called him.  He'd still be selling shirts at  Barney's if she had not brought him under her wing.  Well, the little  pischer got her main account, The Food Chain, and because she couldn't  think about being known as being down-sized to the dogfood account, she  quit.
She moves to this really cool country estate in Vermont with 62  acres of land, a pond, cows, and a two story house with an attic that is in  need of constant repair.  The house looks like a dream on the outside, but  on the inside she winds up paying thousands to put on a new roof, get the  heating fixed, and she even runs out of well water.
The well water part  is funny, because being a city girl, she thinks she can just go get the  hose around the back of the house and fill up the well.  She is totally  unaware that she's going to have to spend thousands more to get her house  hooked up to the town's water supply.  Poor thing!  I'm a city girl, too,  but not so much of a city girl that if I ran out of well water I'd know I  was completely out of water.
She meets and falls in love with the little  country veterinarian played by Sam Sheppard.  I'm not much of a Sam  Sheppard fan, either, but this is one of the movies I loved him in.
He  was so good with Baby Elizabeth, and he practically kissed the frozen toes  off Diane Keaton when she had a flat on the way home one night.  ""Wow!"" she whispers, after he leaves.
While she spends day  after dreary day in her snow-bound Vermont home, she creates a homemade  baby food recipe for Elizabeth out of the apple orchard.  Homemade baby  applesauce.  And it becomes such a big seller that now the big city wants  to get their clutches into the recipe.  So J.C. goes back to the big city  to make a deal with them.  But even though they offer her 3 million dollars  up front, an apartment of her choice, a portion of the profits, and use of  the company jet, she turns them down, because she realizes that she loves  her country estate, and her baby is so happy there, and she's in love with  the town vet.
I really like the way this movie ended.  I just wish the  series with Kate Jackson would have taken up where the movie left off,  instead of her being a corporate executive.  The series wasn't very good,  and I really, really, like Kate Jackson, but Diane Keaton was type-cast in  this role, and if she had been in the series, maybe it would have gone  over.
Ahhh, well, I'm probably past my thousand word limit, so here's  sayin', if you have not seen Baby Boom, you need to buy a copy.  Take it  from me, it will not be a waste of time.",962928000,8,3636,4.2178362573099415
