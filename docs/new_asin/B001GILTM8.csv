8305437,5,B001GILTM8,This has to be the best children's DVD that I've ever purchased!  My two-year old actually requests to watch it.  The jingles are very catchy.  He had all of his letter sounds down after a handful of viewings.  I would suggest watching their sample video on Youtube.  It gives you an idea of what the DVD is like.,1325721600,,313,4.327586206896552

8305439,1,B001GILTM8,"I decided to buy this DVD after seeing a little clip of it in YouTube.  But am very disappointed.  The phonetic pronunciation of the same letter is inconsistent and sometimes inaccurate.  For instance, ""P"" is a voiceless /p/, as pronounced correctly by the small letter ""p"", not the capital letter ""P"" who pronounced is as a voiced /pah/.  These inaccuracies are evident throughout the video.  In addition, the way the same letter was written was inconsistent and also wrong in some cases.  The music and the beat is captivating for my little daughter, but the inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the DVD made it not worth the purchase.",1268870400,,636,4.897196261682243
