8507851,1,B0070WTPNY,"I couldn't get the disk to play on serveral players due to 'Region Error'.  I have ordered this DVD from two different vendors, but get the same error on both.  I have ordered many DVD's from Amazon and have had no issues up until this TV Series.  Before I return for a refund, for a second time, I would like to know if there is anything I can do to get the disk to play. I have no issues with the TV series content; I love this show.  That is why I have tried twice to get the first season.  Now I am hesitant to try a third time.",1349481600,,532,3.8440366972477062
8507852,1,B0070WTPNY,I had waited so long for this DVD to be available and now can't play it.  The discs cannot be recognized by any DVD player in my home or the homes of my friends.  I was advised that it may be formatted for another country's specifications or something.  Don't know but very unhappy.  Be warned.,1348704000,3,294,4.290909090909091

Season 1 is already available. Season 2 will be released August 28, 2012, Season 3 in Nov 2012, and Season 4 in Feb 2013 (all available for pre-order). You will need a region-free DVD player, but you should have one anyway so that you are not at the mercy of studio marketing hacks who withhold good series from certain regions for no apparent reason.",1345852800,11,504,4.43010752688172
8507854,2,B0070WTPNY,I have been wanting this series to be released on dvd for a while and was happy to see it on amazon.. Buyers beware this set is in region 2. It was released in the UK although it wasn't posted under the product descripton. Now i have a season of a show i wanted but can't even watch. I just don't understand why a show that was a US sitcom is released over seas and not here.,1340582400,26,375,3.883116883116883
