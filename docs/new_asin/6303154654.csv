7839457,5,6303154654,"Amazon's listing says: ""Kiri! VHS"", which tells a prospective buyer nothing.  At the very least Amazon should tell one that the video is her 50th Birthday Concert.  Were it not for an Amazon vendor's comment I wouldn't have known the content of this video.  This is most surprising, since I think it is the best video Kiri has done.  It's a two-hour video that touches every facet of her vast versatility, including Jazz, Broadway, Andrew Lloyd Webber and of course her favorite selections from opera and the classics.

The VHS is not available as a purchase from Amazon, but can be had from Amazon vendors -- at a fancy price. Cannot Amazon use its substantial clout to urge producers to make a DVD of the video? Sure money in Amazon's pockets, to say nothing of bringing joy to legions of Kiri lovers.

On another note: Kiri wil be starring in the American opera Vanessa at the Los Angeles Opera, starting on November 27, 2004 and ending on December 18. Seven engagements. Contact Losangelesopera.com for details.  Rumors are current that this may be Kiri's last opera. If so, a DVD of the opera will be a sure-fire seller. Here again, it is in Amazon's self-interest to contact producers to look into the possibility of filming the opera.",1097884800,5,1241,4.717592592592593
