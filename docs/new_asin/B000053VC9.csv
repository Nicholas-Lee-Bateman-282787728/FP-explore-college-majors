1390561,5,B000053VC9,"If you love Monk's recordings you can't afford not to own this. Here is Monk performing many of his classics in a variety of settings in addition to a very well edited documentary. The non-performance clips do much to shed light on Monk's personality and includes interviews with Charlie Rouse and T. Monk Jr. I thought the sections with his son , while brief, were very touching and revealing of the private struggles that Monk went through.

This may not have as much appeal to those who are unfamiliar with the mans' musical contributions but it is a fine film and a wonderful tribute to a true giant.",1092787200,8,604,4.592592592592593
1390562,4,B000053VC9,"Whenever a jazz history TV program is shown, we are usually treated with very little Monk; there's mostly just that short footage of him wearing slim sunglasses, sitting on a fold-out chair playing the piano and stomping his foot sideways. I had never even heard Monk talk prior to this presentation of him...good thing there are subtitles on the DVD ;)
Watching this highly informative and well presented 90 minute documentary about Thelonious Monk and his music got me so excited that I had to throw on the old ""Straight No Chaser"" record when it was over - I guess I actually needed a chaser.
A common mistake in presentations of musical documentaries is that there isn't enough music; people usually talk over it, but that is NOT the case here, as footage from recording sessions and concerts are distinctly kept apart from interviews, which is a big plus. It is not one of these hysterically edited hyper-modern presentations, which a lot of documentaries tend to be these days.
This relief aside, there is something that isn't much discussed here, though, and that are the highlights of Monk's career; when he had success with certain compositions or recordings,--or even which recordings that were successful--he's more presented ""on the whole,"" even though the documentary basically is chronological. There is, however, a ""Monk Career Highlights"" feature in text, but it's very short - the career-highlight feature of executive producer Clint Eastwood is twice as long.
""Straight No Chaser"" is probably the most informative documentary made of Monk so far. The disc also features a short theatrical trailer and subtitles in four different languages, plus there are no problems with either audio or picture, which is nice and unusual. Highly recommended! 4.5 stars!",1082160000,16,1772,5.113793103448276
1390563,5,B000053VC9,"So exclaims a frustrated Monk during a late 1960s Columbia recording session, after finishing a haunting run-through of ""Ugly Beauty"" and learning that producer Teo Macero neglected to record it. The movie is filled with wonderful private moments like these, though I can't say how much interest it will hold for those not familiar with Monk. For me, however, and for many others who are infatuated with him and his music, the footage in this documentary is gold. The character of Monk is rounded out for us, and we find that he was just as unique and strange in his life as he was in his music. He was truly in his own world, and though for 90 minutes we see him up close, with his musicians, with his wife Nellie, with the Baroness Nica, see his bizarre behavior backstage, at the airport, in the hotel, we are no closer to getting inside his head. For that, one simply needs to hear the music.
And the music collected in the movie is astonishing--An early television appearance where Monk is miffed by Count Basie staring at him across the piano during a performance...several shows with a quartet including Charlie Rouse...great footage of the big band sessions of the mid 60s, with Rouse, Johnny Griffin, and Phil Woods scrambling to learn the arrangements...and the great Columbia session, where Monk becomes visibly annoyed, but still has time for a wonderfully tender moment with pal Teo. There are interviews with Monk's managers, his son, Charlie Rouse, and a fine piano duet of ""Well You Needn't"" by Tommy Flanagan and Barry Harris, reminding one and all that not only was Monk one of the most distinctive piano players in jazz, but that, along with Ellington and Charles Mingus, he was one of the most brilliant composers as well.",1063324800,45,1742,4.752475247524752
1390564,4,B000053VC9,"""Straight No Chaser"" offers an abundance of wonderful footage of Thelonious Monk in concert, in transit, at home, in rehearsal, eating, sleeping, spinning in circles, in the studio, signing autographs and of course creating magic at the keyboard. Watching this film is like watching the weather on any given day. At one moment it's cloudy and grey, the next sunny and blue and in between anything could happen, and does. Monk clearly had serious and long term mental health problems, but the music the man created is his real legacy and there is plenty of it here. Towards the end of the film Milt Jackson, Art Farmer, Tommy Flanagan and Barry Harris try to work out the chord progression to one on Monk's songs and as things get more and more complex Milt Jackson (who played with Monk) simply smiles to himself with a combination of perplexity and amusement at the sheer genius of the music.
The excitement and sense of discovery one feels in witnessing this precious footage does become tempered by the lack of insight into the nature of his music and the full impact of it upon other musicians. The interviews are revealing, especially Harry Colomby (Monk's manager) and a visibly emotional TS Monk Jr. who with understandable difficulty recalls his father's mental problems. Ultimately though, the uniqueness of Thelonious Monk's music shines through. His television performance of ""Just A Gigolo"" about half way through is inspiringly honest, utterly sincere (even in it's sardonic humour) and completely absorbing.
Monk's most lasting musical legacy was probably his honesty as a musician and as a man, the rarest quality of all.",1052956800,24,1636,5.018382352941177
1390565,5,B000053VC9,"Alas, pianist Thelonious Monk was unable to acquire chicken dumplins in Copenhagen during a tour stop.  The room service waiter kindly offered him chicken salad.  He also ordered mashed potatoes.
Thelonious Sphere Monk (1917-1982) is generally credited with inventing what we call be-bop, that fiery brand of jazz that emerged post WW II with Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and others.  Be-bop sounded the death-knell of big band/swing like Glenn Miller and Woody Herman.  Monk was there at the forefront although it would be years before he garnered the acceptance or credit he deserved.  Bouts with mental illness also hampered Monk from time to time.  He was hospitalized numerous times.
This DVD compiles FASCINATING black and white footage of Monk during his 1968 tour.  We see Monk smoking, Monk talking and laughing, Monk recording, Monk yelling at Teo Macero (""Why can't nobody do what I tell 'em to do!"" an exasperated Monk yells after learning that Macero-in the control booth-failed to record the song the group had just finished), Monk with his wife Nellie, Monk on the street, getting dressed, spinning in circles etc.  This is truly amazing footage folks.  If only we had such a visual document for every great jazz artist.
The dialogue is very interesting.  Monk himself is often hard to understand, his words often seem to run together.  But I was able to understand enough.  There are interviews with musicians and managers and others.  It is great to see Monk's main saxophonist, Charlie Rouse, commenting on his friend.  In one of the highlights of the film we see Monk rehearsing his group prior to a London performance.  It is awesome to watch Monk lead Rouse, Phil Woods, and Johnny Griffin (!) thru the chord and tempo changes.  Wow.  It's also great to *hear* so much great music in a film.  This is almost a musical in that sense.
We don't get any extras except a trailer here, but the strength of the film itself would make it a five star purchase if nothing else were on the disc.
Essential.",1036972800,20,2020,4.856725146198831

The documentary format serves as a framework for riveting archival footage of master pianist/composer Thelonious Monk.  His antics on the bandstand and in public places are detailed here, and several classic compositions form a wonderful soundtrack.

1390568,5,B000053VC9,"Straght, No Chaser brings a very intimete look at Thelonious Monk. From Concert Stage to the recording studio you get to see what Monk was really like. The recording sessions I enjoyed very much, for the sheer fact of how Monk would work songs and how the producers would work him. The concert footage is very lively with Monks dancing and some false starts with his big band ensemble. There are numerous complete live songs as well as behind the scene footage of Monk and his Wife. If you are fan of Monk this is a must. It is very, very well done.",1004832000,3,549,4.339805825242719
1390569,3,B000053VC9,"Wow - I'm only giving this DVD 3 stars!  Why?  Well, it's NOT because it's not well done -- it is. When you consider how old alot of the footage is, you have to give credit to the producers of this DVD for making it so ""watchable.""  However, it just isn't what I'm looking for in a DVD. [...] What I really enjoy in a concert DVD is a recording that makes me feel like I'm AT the concert.  (The Fourplay DVD is an excellent example of that. There they are on stage with feedback and mistakes here and there -- it's just like really being there!) The Thelonius Monk DVD is much more a documentary.  Also, I took a chance not knowing exactly what kind of music this artist performed.  It is an older-fashioned type of jazz.
If you like older jazz (1950's), and you're interested in knowing all about this artist's life, etc., then I highly recommend this DVD.",1001376000,2,857,4.291925465838509

1390571,5,B000053VC9,"A wonderful glimpse into the man's life and those who rode his sphere of creativity. An interesting and complex individual, the film left me feeling his eccentricities were entirely misunderstood as he seemed to instinctively respond to the music that was around him by his constant moving and spinning motions while performing and back stage. He was a musical ""Jackson Pollock,"" and just as unappreciated by the general public. The world is a lesser place to live without him.

Funny thing about the title--he did take a chaser (see 51:10)!",1327708800,,541,5.011111111111111

1390573,5,B000053VC9,"Imagine watching Beethoven perform, compose, talk to the other musicians, order dinner in a restaurant, clown with his friends, show how uneasy certain people make him, doze in a carriage -- this is what Charlotte Zwerin's documentary has given us on the most rare and improbable musical genius since Beethoven, Thelonious Monk.

He liked to turn in circles. The only musician he really liked was Johnny Griffin. When Teo Macero spoke him in the recording studio he said, ""I heard you before you said it.""

When two women in Europe ask him for his ""signature,"" he sits down on a bench in the airport, signs for them, and says ""You're welcome.""

It is obvious that he is never really comfortable with anyone but his wife and Nica de Koenigswarter. His introduction of ""Pannonica"" in the Baroness's house in New Jersey is the only time in the whole documentary when he sounds truly relaxed. Fittingly, it is to her that he confides one day, ""I am very seriously ill.""

His son gives crucial context to Monk's mental problems, which were never clearly diagnosed. His sudden retirement from music in 1971 remains a mystery. But, knowing him as we know him from this superb documentary, we understand that his gift was a fugitive thing that could be taken away at any moment.

In two interludes, Barry Harris and Tommy Flanagan play his music. Their efforts make painfully obvious that no one but Monk himself could really play Monk.

The world of music would be much poorer if this precious piece of film had never been shot.",1235001600,7,1521,4.742424242424242

1390577,5,B000053VC9,"I don't think the filmmakers who shot this footage set out to make this film.  I think they set out to make another film, but they made this one for better or worse.  Thelonious Monk's ""eccentricities"" were well known to his fans, but this film shows more than just eccentric behavior.

In the vein of eccentric behavior, a friend of mine told me about seeing  Thelonious Monk live at Shelly's Manne Hole in Hollywood back in the late 1960's.  It was a rare appearance for Monk in L.A. and it was not long afterward that the Manne Hole closed, as I recall.  He said that Thelonious stopped playing in the middle of the set and got up from the piano and began to spin around in a slow circles like a dervish.  My friend  showed me how Monk did it.

 My friend said he was disappointed.  He didn't pay to see Monk dance; he wanted to hear him play piano.  But I didn't give it too much thought at the time.  It seemed  harmless, eccentric.

About fifteen years ago, I first saw ""Straight, No Chaser.""  It was  a shock to see Monk doing what my friend described so long before.  It looked much more ominous than his description.  There was one shot of him where he was spinning around and  his eyes momentarily went dull for half a second as if he had a mild stroke or seizure.  Even more shocking was how poorly Monk was functioning at times as he appeared in this movie.  Although I'm not a physician,  the word ""brain tumor"" just leapt into my mind.  That he died of a cerebral hemorrhage  confirms my guess.  It was so shocking that I think I missed most of the film

I recently saw this film  again. The commentary by Monk's son was most poignant  in describing his own childhood, coping with Monk's strange behavior and hospitalizations.  It didn't sound to me as if anyone really understood what was wrong with Monk at the time.

 Rethinking this film's significance: what Monk accomplished --- impressive as it  was --- is even more impressive when you think that while he was writing and performing, in the background, was this thing destroying him inside his own head.  He was struggling and straining to keep going against odds that were gradually slipping away from him. Every day, life got just a little harder for him. The effort eventually overcame him.  No wonder he stopped playing.

Monk was lucky in leaving his unique music as his legacy under these circumstances.  He was also lucky in having married Nellie.  She was a great woman who clearly kept him going and loved him and took care of him.  We were lucky that he married Nellie as well for those same reasons.

The music choices were well placed and add to the bittersweet quality of this video portrait.  There was always the playful quality of Monk's music, in a way reminiscent  of Erik Satie, but deeply rooted in the blues.

The film does have a few comic moments.  The business where they had shipped a trunk full of empty Coke bottles halfway around the world in order to return them for deposit, struck me as hilarious.  I guess you had to grow up in an earlier era for that one.  Also, the ""Copenhagen pants"" and the ""chicken livers"" scenes were pretty funny.

The exact medical facts will probably never be known.  But this is  a story of a great artist---and may I add, a good man---who suffered a terrible and tragic fate.",1216684800,8,3307,4.477310924369748
1390578,2,B000053VC9,"""Straight, No Chaser"" is a decent documentary, but what it fails to do is talk about the music and even less about the history of Monk. Yeah, it has rare performances never before seen, but this doesn't constitute a good film. It's only icing for the cake, but there's not a cake here. I felt it was a rather empty look into his history. I mean everybody who listens and are fans of Monk know where he was born at and how he started playing at a place called Minton's where he met and played with Dizzy and Parker. I would have liked to hear more about his own compositions and how they changed the history of jazz. Interviews with people like Johnny Griffin, Sonny Rollins, Ben Riley, Art Blakey, and other musicians who were more involved with the music making process would have been much more informative than simply interviewing family members and road managers. This may be okay for some people, but it didn't really sit well with me. I actually found these interviews really boring and lacking any kind of character.

I will also say the documentary wasn't really well thought out. It seemed really scatter brained for lack of a better term. At one point, Monk is laying in bed asking for chicken livers, then the next he's playing out live. It's just really a mess of a documentary that really makes no sense. The historical value of the whole thing is incomplete. There is also no focus on his music of the 50s. It seems that his 60s quartet is getting all the press and unfortunately this is what makes this so frustrating, because Monk has made alot of music before he met Charlie Rouse, Larry Gales, and Ben Riley. As great as those musicians are, Monk was blazing trails way before he met those guys.

There are some parts of this film that are priceless like the scenes where he is in the studio recording ""Ugly Beauty"" for his album ""Underground."" That to me is something that was unique and different to see, but for me there wasn't enough of this kind of footage to make it worthwhile.

I will only recommend this documentary to hardcore fans of Monk, but if you're new to his music and want to hear more about his music or see him pick up the DVDs ""Thelonious Monk: American Composer"" or ""Jazz Icons: Live in '66.""",1207958400,11,2232,4.479115479115479

1390580,5,B000053VC9,"It's hard to imagine a more fitting tribute to the late, great Monk, an innovative stylist who penned ""Round Midnight"" and exerted a tremendous influence on Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, John Coltrane, and others. That's largely due to the copious rare footage of Monk, whose bizarre antics we witness on the road and in recording studios. His mumbling musings and anxious tics leave the impression of a mentally unstable man, and it is likely that his tempestuous nature was due to manic depression. But mostly, we hear and see this master keyboardist at work, most notably in a famous 1968 concert filmed by Christian Blackwood. Produced by Clint Eastwood, ""Straight, No Chaser"" is a respectful genuflection to an unusually gifted musician.",1184025600,2,745,5.1652892561983474

1390582,4,B000053VC9,"At first I wasn't sure what to think about this documentary with its sparse narration and pasting together of various production sequences, but after about 40 minutes I became hooked. Straight No Chaser captures Thelonious Monk as a human being which is something one could never do based on his music. The songs alone would make one mistake him for an angel. Here, the stammering, lost, frail genius is fully evident and contextualized in his own voice and through the opinions of those who knew him. I found his son's remarks to be of great value as viewers can tell that he had a very complex and conflictual relationship with his father. This is to be expected given that Monk had schizophrenia. Luckily, the documentary does not shy away from his condition and the realities of how debilitated he must have been for so much of his life. That he was able to put together the brilliant musical arrangements he did is quite extraordinary. The family story is compelling as well. Clearly, without his wife there is no way in which Monk could have been anywhere near as successful as he was. Best of all is the music--reproduced here with seemingly endless life performances. Seeing the artist at work is what made the movie for me.",1172361600,2,1232,4.708333333333333

1390584,5,B000053VC9,"By any and all standards Thelonious Monk belongs amongst the most unique musicians and composers ever produced by this country. Thanks to Clint Eastwood, Monk's genius and odd behaviour will be preserved for future generations in a way that books could never hope to completely portray. The outstanding thing about Monk was his uniqueness and individuality. Yes he could play with other musicians and he could play compositions by other composers but regardless of what he played or who he played with, you always knew it was Monk. Others copied him but no one duplicated him and sadly there are very, very few artists/composers out there today with an original sound or style. I wish more people would wake up to the true genius of Monk and that may happen one day.

1390586,5,B000053VC9,"Three cheers for Clint Eastwood for having the courage and fortitude to produce such a film as this. He recognized the genius of Monk and set out to film him in his element at a time when very few American film makers, record companies and the public at large had very little if any interest in Monk. The most remarkable thing about this film is that there is no narrator to put his/her slanted and narrow opinions and interpretations in and take reality out. There is no Denzel Washington nor Wesley Snipes to portray characters. No Quincy Jones or Spike Lee to explain the idiom. One can see and hear the voices of the actual musicians themselves in the process of living and creating music. Mr. Eastwood captured these realities at the beginning of Monk's decline and on to the end. The only film that comes close to this is Mingus ""Beneath The Underdog"". There is a lot of truth in this film, something that the American public seldom appreciates.",1161993600,5,951,4.6

I rarely peer into the lives of musicians I love, but I am glad to have looked closer at Thelonius Monk.

1390588,5,B000053VC9,"I am a Monk fan, a large one at that...and never realized the man's struggles with sanity and how it fused his creative spark.

The somewhat introspective nature of Monk is evident by his music, I mean when one listens to Satchmo there is a feeling of optimism(usually) or when one listens to Duke one hears a standard bearer of overall artistic greatness but Monk is a prophet whose music left an enduring legacy for mankind and like a biblical Moses in his fits of epilepsy, the stuttering truths somehow becomes universal signposts for life.

The possibly diagnosed ""bi-polar"" disorder his son and others complain about is all evident in the music...the highs and lows,the blues and the swing,the full spectrum of emotion is always found in his music and like his playing and life itself the element of unpredictability and straying outward and returning back was a hallmark of his life...the fluctuations between euphoria and depression is a very human story shared by all. Jazz speaks its truth.

The movie goes on and on with great clips and is a documentary with wonderful music...culminating in his wake..Despite the greatness of the music throughout his long recording history that stands alone securing his place as a unique immortal..it is good to know some of the penetrating human, all too human background of this great artist.",1135814400,7,1341,4.9511111111111115

I first saw it in college and it introduced me to Monk's music, which makes it invaluable to me personally, but I've recently purchased this film from Amazon and am reminded of why I initially loved it.  The film has plenty of great music from Monk, later in his years.  There are some performances with a band and also solo playing (which I find to be the most moving).  But what truly makes this great is the depiction of Monk in his personal moments and his relationship with his wife.  The film shows some of Monk's idiosynchratic behaviors without being melodramatic but also shows the tenderness and trust of their marriage.  Additionally, Monk is very funny with his mumbled, grumpy remarks, especially in a scene where he complains about Count Basie ""looking"" at him while he plays.",1361923200,2,820,4.73943661971831
