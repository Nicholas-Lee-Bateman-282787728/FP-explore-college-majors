Being a great martial arts anime. However being a Korean made anime it heavily focuses on ancient Korean culture. Unfortunately it was only released strait to a dub with no bilingual audio track, but the dub is very good, with Red Hawk's voice actor being none other than Steve Blum (Spike Spiegel: Cowboy Bebop).",1455408000,,499,4.681818181818182

The Camelia Blossoms are the most powerful of the warring gangs and they use this time of unrest to wrestle control of the country from the ailing peoples government, while also producing counterfeit gold coins to cripple the struggling economy.

7966357,3,B00006AL1P,"""Red HAWK"" is a movie based on the Korean comic book titled ""Redhawk"" published by Dai Won Publishing which is a pretty cool action movie. It has similarities to ""Dragon Ball Z"", ""Fist of the Northstar"" and ""Ninja scroll"".
If there is one thing that may confuse people, it looks like anime but it's from Korea and as more and more anime and manga-like productions are being created outside of Japan, can we call it anime?
That's a debate for another time. As for ""Red Hawk"", it features awesome fight scenes with a character with the hair and look of Super Saiyajin 3 of ""Dragon Ball Z"", the characters which remind me of ""Fist of the Northstars"" and the challenges of opponenents similar to ""Ninja Scroll"".
I really enjoy these type of animations but with ""Red Hawk"" coming out on DVD, I feel there are some misses. One thing I was hoping is that there would be the animation language track in Korean or Japanese but we only get a dubbed version. The dub is nowhere near the quality of Manga Entertainment's ""Macross Plus"" and the dub track is reminiscent of the old Streamline anime features. Personally, I wonder if the actual dialog has been changed. The other is not so bad but you can tell the movie's age with the scratches during the animation.
As for DVD special features, there is a photo gallery, character bio and the original trailer and typical Manga Entertainment trailers.
All in all, this anime is showing how other countries have adapted Japanese animation to their animations and ""Red Hawk"" is an enjoyable anime but I know I would of enjoyed this animation more if presented with it's original language and with English subtitles.",1030320000,5,1650,4.6931034482758625
