7883507,5,6305121710,"I almost didn't buy this video because of a poor review, but I'm glad I did.  The video delivers what it promises- 5 different (and hard)11 minute workouts.  Each workout also includes a few stretches.  The picture quality is good and there is a little background music. The video is filmed on a beach and Scott and his wife do the exercises.  Scott is talking through most of it, either to explain how to do the exercise or to encourage the viewer. He likes to say the pain is good. The workouts might be short but if you do them you will feel it.",1074038400,9,548,4.240384615384615
7883508,4,6305121710,"In this set of video tapes, you will find a system of five 11-minute workouts that save your time and produce well-balanced results.  There is an upper body workout, abdominal workout, back & biceps workout, and a lower body(legs) workout.  Each one takes no more than 11 minutes to complete (if you do them at a normal pace).  The workouts have you do various types of exercises that condition a specific area of the body.
If you are a busy person without much extra time for physical fitness, this program is a lifesaver.  By the time your friends are halfway to the gym, you will have already finished your workout.  Scott is not a great public speaker, but at least he knows physical fitness.  I ordered and watched the whole video and put it on the front and back of a piece of paper and try to do at least one of the workouts six days a week, no matter where I am. (I'm a seal wanna-be)
Not included in this workout is the fact that you should run and swim on alternate days for 15-45 minutes.  Doing this aerobic exercise at the end of the 11 minute workout will reduce the soreness that most beginners will experience the next day.  Running and swimming abilities play a major part in SEAL fitness and any workout lacking them would be deficient.
On the video the only equipment Scott Helvenston and his wife use are a basic curl bar for lat rows, dumbells for bicep curls, and a dip/pullup bar.  These are only used on one of the workouts (back and biceps), and you could substitute household items if you do not have access to the equipment.
If you are hoping to become a SEAL, this is a good basic toning and maintenance workout, but you would have to progress far past this to succeed in training.  See ""The Complete Guide To Navy Seal Fitness"" (12 weeks to BUD/s workout) by Stuart Smith or a similar book if you are really serious about SEAL training.
A previous reviewer gave this video set a poor ranking because it was, 'Not as good as the ""Navy Seal Workout Challenge Video.""' Having done both videos and other SEAL workouts too, I would say that it depends on your needs.  The other video takes something like 60 minutes to complete the one workout and covers mostly the upper body calisthenics with plenty of stretching for the legs.  You can't beat the ""Navy Seal 11 Minute Fitness System"" if you are looking for a quick workout that you can stick with over the long haul.",987984000,32,2393,4.438356164383562
7883509,5,6305121710,"This is a totally awesome workout system which is great for anyone from a beginner to a pro. Its more made for a pro, but if your a beginner you could just start out doing a less number of exercises and work your way up.  You'll definitely see results quick. I felt results the next day! And you  don't have to have any weights to do a majority of the workouts. A few do  use a barbell and a dumbell and another piece of equipment, but it can be  done without it. But having the eqiupment is a definite plus which you can  get inexpensively at any sports store.",936230400,26,561,4.110091743119266
