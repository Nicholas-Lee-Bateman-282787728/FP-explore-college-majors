2067636,1,B00028G75W,"Worst kid's DVD I have ever seen.  I could only make it through a few songs before ejecting it and throwing it in the trash.  Poorly made (think home video camera) and as another reviewer said, the face painting is a little scary.",1146441600,6,230,4.325581395348837
2067637,2,B00028G75W,Video footage looks like it's from someone's home videos.  Face painting is a little scary too.  Audio is above average but has little coordination with video footage.  Kid's may actually watch it a couple times but parents will be not happy with this video.,1144022400,2,258,4.818181818181818
2067638,4,B00028G75W,"The DVD features brightly dressed and very animated children, adults, and animals.  The songs which are quite rythmic and upbeat should be familiar to most adults and are very appealing to most toddlers.  Each song or story is aligned with a letter in the alphabet.  The children in the feature are in the age group from toddlers to pre-teens.

One nice feature of this DVD format is that it will automatically re-start a few minutes after the main features are finished.",1123027200,,471,4.777777777777778
2067651,1,B00028G75W,"ABSOLUTE WORST VIDEO EVER!  The cover is misleading.  If only the video looked half as good as the cover.  That cute, clean child isn't even in the video.  The quality of this video makes me think a family tried to make their own video.  Creepy clowns chase the kids around.  This video is now known by our friends and family as the worst video ever.  DO NOT BUY.",1331424000,,363,4.25
2067652,5,B00028G75W,"This video is a little goofy, but my daughter loves it. It's the only video she will watch. We finally figured out that she likes watching real people instead of cartoons. I would highly recommend this one.  Even if parents think it's wierd let your kids be the judge. They will love it.",1323388800,,287,4.415094339622642
2067653,1,B00028G75W,"I thought that based on the cover of the DVD and songs listed that this would be just a normal kids sing-along, boy was I wrong! This tape was made in some other country and the people in it dress in funny costumes and paint their faces. The words to the song do not even match the people's lip movements so you know it was dubbed in english. The videos to the songs and the characters are just overall odd and kind of scary or children. My daughter loves sing-alongs, but she hates this one!",1319673600,,492,4.189473684210526
2067654,1,B00028G75W,"My daughter loves it but I was creeped out.  I wanted to throw it in the trash...I'm conflicted.  I couldn't help but laugh when a bunch of unathletic kids tried to jump over lit candles...the beginning song shows a bunch of weird kids in weird face paint wandering around the weirdest little village I've ever seen.  Very trashy, creepy video.  My first thought was to throw it away.  Why does my daughter like this?",1316476800,,417,4.581081081081081
2067655,1,B00028G75W,"I think I've written only one other review on Amazon but I had to log in to say that this was the worst purchase ever. If you think Barney is bad, picture 1980s children with horrible music and videography. We bought this for our daughter's 3rd birthday and I was sorry that I put her through watching a few of these songs on her special day!",1313020800,,342,4.196969696969697
2067656,1,B00028G75W,"I was hoping for a video that would encourage my son to get up and dance while listening to his favorite songs. This video is sooo creepy! Face-painted kids (scary!), stories that don't sync up to the story teller's lips, the giant characters look drunk, etc. The cover art makes it look like a video that has some production value. In truth, it has NONE. Not worth whatever it is that you might pay for this. It's awful. Take a pass. I have it on now and it's making me nauseous.

I might play this on Halloween to scare people.",1312761600,,529,4.29
2067657,1,B00028G75W,"Yes - WTF? That's all I could think of after watching the first 6 songs on this video and then stopping it before it would induce nightmares in my otherwise even-keeled 3 year old. I think the producers put up an ad at the local Piggly Wiggly asking for volunteers to participate in this creepy, hallucinogenic trip disguised as a children's video. You'll be cocking your head to the side in confusion right from the start as the crazy teenager in cosplay who looks like she should be working at Hot Topic can't decide if she should write on her little chalkboard in caps or not - A-B-C-d? Huh? Then the random Halloween face paint begins...and never ends. It's totally CREEPY! Some kid was staring right at me with this flourescent green paint all over his face. I thought someone had slipped something in my iced tea. And how is it that children completely covered in fake cobwebs climbing up and down a 6 ft. ladder is considered a decent enactment of ""Eensey Weensey Spider"" without invoking the idea that someone should call child protective services? If you want a good laugh or demo for how ANYONE can produce a video, buy this one.",1308700800,,1139,4.588235294117647
2067658,1,B00028G75W,"This video is downright disturbing. Not only was it not amusing in the slightest, the same group of random kids look completely unamused prancing around in terrifying face paint in every song, but it was actually creepy. The story ""Xavier the X-ray Machine"" features statements like ""take a picture of your stomach like daddy does on birthdays and special occasions."" This creepy story goes on for about 3x the length of all the other stories and is plain uncomfortable, with plenty more suggestive statements. Don't even get me started on the old man chasing around the little girls with an umbrella, or the fact that eerie music often shows up with the main girl in her horrifying face paint cracking a smile. This video SCARES my child.
One memorable song is the ""Itsy-Bitsy Spider"", in which we have small children climbing ladders. Also, of course, leaping over candles in ""Jack Jumped Over the Candlestick."" The featured animals look like they are ready to move on to the afterlife. The kids look miserable, and the video isn't even edited to APPEAR like they are happy. The adults...well, we've discussed them. Just make it stop.
Save your money and buy something else, anything else. Go outside and pick up a rock for your child, it will be more interesting and wholesome than this movie. Of course, if you want your kid to run away and join the circus and think this sort of thing is normal, then go right ahead and purchase it.",1307836800,,1437,4.729083665338646
2067659,4,B00028G75W,"While this is certainly not the best children's video, I'm not sure what the reviewers who are calling this the ""worst"" are expecting from a low-cost video designed for very young kids.  First off, this video was originally recorded in the French, with English dubbed over.  And while the dubbing is occasionally out-of-synch with the lip movements, most of the video is of song and dance only.  The songs are common and the audio quality is fine.

The bottom line is this . . . my 2 year old loves this video.  While the two long stories do not always keep her attention, she is fixated on the rest of the video.  And I have no worries about the content she is viewing.  There is no violence and no special effects.  Quite simply, it is a low budget video with basic costumes, simple storylines primarily based on popular children's songs, and easy-to-mimic choreography.  And while the ""Vive la Compagnie"" song does make reference to consumption of alcoholic beverages, children watching this are unlikely to make the connection to alcohol - unless that's what they see in their homes.

Regarding other reviewers' references to ""creepy"" clowns and ""scary"" make-up, it may frighten some children, but probably just the ones that scare easily.  And to make the suggestion that the man with the umbrella chasing after the girl during the ""Chasing the Kangaroo"" video is perverse is simply an adult projecting their own perversions to a children's video.  The scene was filmed following the words of the song.  And maybe that man is the girl's grandfather.  Would that be more acceptable?  Nothing about this video is scary, creepy, or perverse.  Get a grip people!

I recommend this video.  For the price, if you feel that it's inappropriate, or if it scares your child, give it to someone else with your ""warnings"" and let others (specifically the children) decide for themselves.",1305590400,3,1880,4.8584905660377355
2067660,1,B00028G75W,"This shoestring budget video was a huge disappointment - it literally was the worst DVD we ever bought.  We bought this for our 2 year old, because the cover suggested that this was a sing-a-long for pre-schoolers.  Instead, it appeared to be nothing more than some amateurs telling stories and singing and boring our poor children to tears.  Save your money and buy something with an eye to production value.",1304035200,,409,4.814285714285714
2067676,1,B00028G75W,"Zero stars for this horrible production. The kids are crawling around randomly with scary looking makeup on their faces (looks like they did the makeup themselves!). Random videos of animals and strange looking kids running around the park with even weirder looking adults with them. It looks like someone's home videos at a birthday party or something. They use the same few costumes in every single song. I would say there was little to no planning, just show up in some random costume and run around acting silly. Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra for the Baby Einstein or even Baby Genius videos. Those are a million times better. Even the quality of the songs is extremely bad on this dvd. My son barely paid attention to it the one and only time I played it for him. DON'T BUY THIS!!!",1303603200,,801,4.569444444444445
2067677,1,B00028G75W,"I'm not kidding!  This entire video was filmed in France...or maybe it is French Canadian?  It is so comically bad, I am embarrassed for the people in it.  I will say, my two year old enjoys it, but we find it so intolerable that I threw it away.  No one should be subjected to this video.  Shame on the production company who took stock footage and used an entirely unrelated picture on the dvd cover to imply that it is actually a polished production.  I'd rather feed my kid a big mac than let him watch this video, it is probably better for him.",1294531200,,549,4.230769230769231
2067678,2,B00028G75W,"I laughed until I cried at the other reviews, which are all true. This is a truly bizarre, outrageously awful movie. BUT--our 27-month-old son adores it and has learned the lyrics to all of the songs. He sits still and watches it and smiles and sings along--which he refuses to do for any other movie. I can't account for his taste--but he loves it. We bought it for 5 bucks and it's honestly money very well spent.

We've had it for a few months now--at first his mom and I ""lost"" the movie for awhile, since we just could NOT listen to it or see it one more time. Our toddler kept searching for it and requesting it for days on end. Finally we gave in to the dark forces and now we let him watch it all the time. It makes him SO happy--we just leave the room so we don't have to endure it again.

We thought it might have been filmed at a Romanian orphanage. After careful video review, we noticed a Quebec license plate. We continue to speculate about the people who made this--a religious cult? A discount orphanage? Who ARE these bizarre people?!

One other note--there is no conflict or violence in this movie, which is rare for kids' movies.",1290643200,5,1148,4.330232558139535
2067679,1,B00028G75W,"I give this NEGATIVE stars. This DVD was so horrible that I don't even know where to begin. My Mother in Law got this for my girls at the Goodwill...yes, I was just as shocked as you are that someone would actually donate this piece of crap. It is the GOODwill and there is nothing GOOD about this DVD. If you have become the victim of either buying this yourself(hey, we all make mistakes) or received it as a gift, please do everyone a favor and throw it in the TRASH...after breaking the disc into many pieces and scattering them into multiple trash cans(or even the trash cans of a friends house)so that there is no way anyone would ever be able to repair it when they find it in a landfill a million years from now.

Part of the description: ""Your children will love being a part of the singing and dancing activities - just as if they were one of the gang in this fun and exciting video!""....Um, No Thank You. I do not want my kids to be part of THAT gang. Now if you want your kids to be annoying, dorky, out of rythem and every other terrible quality, then go ahead ahd buy this DVD.

Singing the ABC's. Well they go back and forth between lower case and UPPER CASE letters and the annoying dressed up adult girl draws a lot of the letters really fast and super crappy on a chalk board, her A looks like it was drawn by a drunk donkey with 1 arm and no eyes, most of the letters are just AWFUL. This will NOT help your children learn, it will likely lower their IQ to that of a rock.

The face painting is horrific and scary, all of the kids are annoying, the adult is the most annoying one of all. The adult is ""talking"" but the narrarator does not match up with her at all. It is just HORRIBLE!

PLEASE, if you did buy it or receive it as a gift, follow the above instructions to discard. Don't forget ""I believe the children are the future"" and we are all in Big, Big trouble if this DVD is what they are learning.

The REAL ABC's to describe this DVD:
*Awful
*Bad
*Corny
*Dorky
*Evil
*Foul
*Gross
*Horrible
*Ignorant
*Jerky(if you make your kids watch this that is what you are)
*K
*Lame
*Moronic
*Nerdy
*Off(what you will want to do if you turn it on)
*Please(do not buy this)
*Queasy
*Rediculous
*Stupid
*Turd(would make a better gift)
*Ugh!
*Vomit
*W

And if anyone can help me fill in the ones I missed or come up with new ones, let me know and I'll add them in.",1288569600,2,2389,4.1735357917570495
2067680,2,B00028G75W,"I'm torn.  In some ways, it's worth 5 stars.  I laughed so hard that I almost peed my pants.  But in reality, it's a 1 star video.  My mother-in-law sent it to my son.  He is only 8 months old, so he's not interested in television yet, but for some reason my husband and I decided to put it in anyway.  I'm glad we did, and not because it's a quality video, but because it was hilariously bad.

Some highlights:

- Kids jumping over a lit candle.  Oh what fun!
- That drunk looking mullet-having clown...OMG!
- A disturbing man with the umbrella chasing a kid.
- The horrifying face paint.  What is the deal with that?!
- A teenage girl WAY too old to be participating in this.
- Those costume beasts romping around.

Now I am curious about who made this.  Who are these people?!?  How did this get filmed and distributed?",1280361600,,822,4.259740259740259
2067681,1,B00028G75W,"As others have said, I'd like to give this no stars. It is so bad I would feel guilty re-selling it at a consignment, so I'm throwing it away. I think the worst songs are the one where an old, scary man who looks drunk is chasing a girl with an umbrella. That's followed by video of the kids wearing fake beards while sitting around tables and swinging glasses like they are at a bar. And this girl wearing a clown costume laughs hysterically like she's drunk. I want to smack her throughout the entire video. The production quality is terrible. Don't waste your money like I did!

2067682,1,B00028G75W,"This video is ONLY Awesome on Opposite Day. I just recently bought this for my 2 year old son and was appalled by its POOR quality within the first 2 minutes. I am usually not the type to post a review but I felt that I had to for this one. NOBODY in the video sings along to anything. Not even when the story reader reads the story does she even attempt to follow it with her mouth. As others have stated, who lets their kid jump over lit candles, over and over and over? Can't believe that someone would actually take a look at this video (after being made) and say ""yeah, I'll sell this to stores nationwide."" Somebody dropped the ball on this one big time but so did I by purchasing it.

It is trash, poorly made, insipid, teeth-grinding trash.  I bought it on the cheap-o rack at ROSS.  It should have been in the recycle bin.  From the bored-as-hell kids to the fat chick in a clown outfit with face paint, everything about this video is creepy and horrible.  YUCK!",1272412800,2,410,4.638888888888889

I am starting to think if this video acctually made it to market I could make tons of money on my home videos! We laughed harder as we read through these reviews that made every comment we did.  The face painting is apalling, the kids look like they were picked up in a park and given 5 bucks to try to look like they were having fun, not to mention the jumping over lit candles and the child molester looking guy chasing the girl in the ""My uncle chased a Kangaroo song"" The main girl in the very out of place wierd theme park looking dress should be embarassed that this video exsists! I also agree that the songs are also cheesy.  I put up with a lot of cheese in my kids movies but this is so bad it could be UTUBE making fun of cheesy kids videos video.

My daughter, who will usually drop whatever she is doing when she hears music and look for its origin, didn't even glance twice at this video.  Also, during ""Jack Jumped Over the Candlestick"" the, shall we say, ""characters"" in the video, are seen jumping over lit candles.  Is this a good thing to show our young children?

The music is equally dreadful, consisting of incredibly cheesy, karaoke/lounge singer-like versions of old nursery rhymes and songs.  This is by far the worst DVD I have ever wasted good money on for our toddler.  He stared at it for a few moments, and then ignored it.  When we asked him if he would like to watch it again (in spite of how ghastly it was - we wanted to get some use out of it) he told us in no uncertain terms that he did not like it, which was a great relief to be honest.  Please don't waste your money.  You can play dress-ups and make your own amateurish home video for less cash, and you'll probably get a lot more enjoyment out of doing so.",1185580800,,878,4.259036144578313

Mommies, our kid are who they are.  We may not understand why they like what they do, but we need to support them in their interests.

Even though the DVD case gives a clean, well-produced, educational video impression, DO NOT be so easily fooled!! The movie appears to be a collection of home videos of a group of kids who had a little too much of extra time on their hands. The children in the video do not even interact with the song playing over the audio; they do not dance to it on rhyme or even sing along with it. During story time, the story is read over the audio, but the 'storyteller' in the movie just moves her lips clearly not actually reading the story. As other reviewers have brought up, the face paint was too scary and looked out of place.

I had the same low opinion of it when I first watched it- it looks cheesy, low budget and just plain horrible. But there is something about it that the kids just cannot get enough of. My husband and I joke that it has subliminal messaging in it! Honestly, this was THE favorite video of my two kids when they were babies and young toddlers, and I actually used to play this at naptime for my son, as it was the ONLY thing that would get him to nap. He is now 4, and just found this video again and begged to watch it. Of course, I was reluctant, but he insisted and is watching it right now, which prompted me to check out the reviews on Amazon out of curiosity. He and his 3-year-old sister are just as transfixed by it as they were 2 years ago!! Seriously, they just adore it.

8023714,3,B00028G75W,"What has been said about the video in the negative reviews is true, but my baby loves it.  Babies aren't looking for Daytime Emmy winning performances.  The music is familiar (backing tracks sounded just like Barney), the singing decent, and the garish face painting is colorful enough to get a baby's attention.  Most of the video is just some kids and characters playing outside like you see in the clips on Sesame Street.  If your baby likes music and the price of the DVD isn't too high, it's not the worst thing you could do to buy it.",1341446400,,540,4.479591836734694
8023715,1,B00028G75W,"This one was a very strange one.  The picture on the front of the DVD is a cute baby but the people singing are a group of kids from about 5-17 years old.  Most are in long dresses or skirts and have scary face-paint on (think musician Kiss-style).  Just overall weird. They sing nursery rhymes but the singing isn't synched with their voices and it is just kind of weird.  There are also barney-type animals dancing around some of the time.  On a positive note, my 2 year old actually liked it but I wouldn't sit through it again!!
Don't waste your money!!!",1334880000,,558,4.378640776699029
8023716,4,B00028G75W,"I don't get why this video got so many 1-stars. My daughter is hooked on the thing! Yes, it's low-budget: there are two fuzzy costumed characters, a lady dressed like she bought a Halloween Bo-Peep costume, a bunch of kids in face paint, and creepy clown (what clown ISN'T creepy though?). But my daughter will watch this entire thing from start to finish without blinking.

Many parents seem to think that everything worth showing their kids has to be high-budget and flashy, but think about it: what does your kid play with on Christmas the most, the pricey new toys, or the cardboard boxes and wrapping paper?

This was the first video my daughter ever showed an interest in. She is nearly 18 months old now, and still likes this one as well or better than any of the others, including Baby Einstein, Elmo, etc. It has animals, other kids, weird and interesting characters, and all the songs she knows. She LOVES it. In fact, the first song she ever learned to sing was the ""Ga-goo"" frog song.

As an adult, this video strikes me as ""What I might see if I dropped acid and visited a musical farm with a stop at a Halloween Store on the way."" And that is EXACTLY why it appeals to toddlers.

My daughter might stay interested in all the other DVDs she has for 20 minutes or so. With this one, I can guarantee I will have time to unload the dishwasher, do some laundry, cook a meal, or just have at least a half hour or more of adult time while she is entranced by the show. This video is priceless in our household.",1334620800,,1517,4.368794326241135
