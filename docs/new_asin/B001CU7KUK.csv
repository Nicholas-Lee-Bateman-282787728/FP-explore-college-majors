8289263,5,B001CU7KUK,"Vasco Nunez de Balboa trekked across the Isthmus of Panama in 1519. He and his motley crew become the first Europeans to gaze on what is now called the Pacific Ocean.  Since Balboa gazed southerly onto the vast waterway, he dubbed it the South Sea and claimed it for the Spanish Crown.

Many nations including  Spain, Holland, and Colombia to  name a few dreamed of building an inter oceanic waterway in Panama which is only 50 miles wide in some areas.  The French tried to build a sea level canal in the 1880s but failed miserably.

It would  be the United States who ultimately built the Panama Canal, 1904-1914. This DVD captures with video tape and outstanding still pictures those turbulent years when resolute men  -- and women  -- undertook one of the greatest engineering feats of all time.

With the  100th anniversary of opening of the Panama Canal, August 2014, on the horizon this carefully prepared DVD can help students, of all ages, appreciate what a marvelous feat the construction of the canal really was.
