8667464,5,B00LORWW5Y,"Thank you and Very well done! Much appreciate this being an Indian project with perspective from those who live the culture. It is not a another documentary done by westerners who think they have the true and complete perspective which most do not. Would love to see History of Yoga 2. A followup that would be more inclusive of Indian tradition that is grand and extensive. This version appeared to favor a Vedanta view with Swami Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda which is good but not the total picture. Understandable of time constraints, I would stand in line for more.",1444608000,,574,4.808080808080808
8667465,5,B00LORWW5Y,"This is a comprehensive work on the History of Yoga. It presents carefully researched information on the origins of Yoga and its journey through the ages. Even though Patanjali documented the science of Yoga, origins of Yoga date back to the oldest recorded history of Indian civilization. Yoga has existed since the Harrappan civilization  which existed more than five thousand years ago. It shows how Yoga took on different forms during different epochs of Indian history. It shows how widely Yoga has been practiced in India since the ancient times and its prevalence in ancient scriptures, temples and sculptures.
This documentary shows that Yoga is not only a technique to exercise the body but its main purpose is to control the mind. It is one in a sequence of steps for attaining the Samadhi - the highest form of consciousness. In that sense it is a technique that is not religious in nature. It has been practiced by people of various religions since ancient times.
It is a documentary worth watching more than once. I watched it twice and it was time well spent. Not only did I learn about the history of Yoga but I also learnt more about Indian history, philosophy and civilization in the process. The documentary is very well made with very good visuals, sound quality and narration. If you prefer watching in Hindi, you can get a Hindi DVD from www.vishuddhifilms.com.",1431907200,4,1382,4.8559322033898304

8667468,5,B00LORWW5Y,"There are many documentaries on Yoga on Amazon for Prime members that barely scratch the surface. This movie is very different. I bought the movie much before it came on Amazon and loved it. It's carefully researched and presents a well balanced perspective of History of Yoga. It's also a journey in to ~6000 years of Indian thought and philosophy. The voice of Kabir Bedi is excellent, the scholars interviewed are very knowledgeable. If you are a Yoga lover and want to go beyond the surface hype of swanky studios to the original truth this is a must watch.",1415836800,3,561,4.6767676767676765
