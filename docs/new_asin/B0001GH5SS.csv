8012177,5,B0001GH5SS,"Prem (Shashi Kapoor), an immature young teacher recently married, is not happy with his even younger wife, Indu (Leela Naidu). She doesn't do things the way his mother  does, is more outspoken than he would like, and neither of them have any idea of how to form a working relationship.  In a fit of childishness, Prem telegraphs for his mother (Durga Khote) to come, and what seems to spell doom for the marriage, instead works an amazing change.

Based on the novel Gharbar by the movie's screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, the Householder is a gentle, beautiful movie, with natural acting and a fully immersible plot. This Merchant Ivory Production was the pair's first collaboration, and yet it shows their now famous style fully formed from the beginning.  This character study is a charming drama well worth watching.",1524268800,,822,4.978102189781022
8012178,3,B0001GH5SS,"Set in India, this is the study of a young mans relationship with his new wife; a woman he doesn't even know and whom he supports working as a teacher while dealing with the politics of the school system. Meanwhile he has to deal with his wifes temperament and finds himself living like a stranger in their home. Ivory uses beautiful images to reflect the couples present anxiety and their lament of a lost childhood with humour and humanity. Later in the story the young man crosses paths with a soul-searching and very annoying man from the United States who lives in a community of eccentrics.  The American constantly makes philosophical proclamations and is obsessed with self-discovery but is incapable of listening to our protagonists dilemmas; the irony of friendships.

The acting is sometimes weak but the actors inexperience and their obvious commitment and exuberance gives the film character and mood. An interesting first effort by Merchant/Ivory which reflects their love for the human spirit in all its awkward glory!",1455235200,,1033,5.070588235294117

8012180,5,B0001GH5SS,"This old classic is a nostalgic tour de force for movie buffs. Having first seen it when it came out in 1962, I wanted to own the DVD. Shashi Kapoor appears vulnerable yet endearing youth. Leela Naidu's understated beauty in this black and white movie is something to behold. Merchant and Ivory were introduced to millions of movie goers by this movie to Ruth Prawar Jhabwala's fiction.
Enjoyed it again after many decades.",1405468800,,423,4.808219178082192
8012181,5,B0001GH5SS,The Ivory-Merchant-Jhabvala team established a particular style in their film productions. This film and HEAT AND DUST are even more special because they are based on novels written by Jhabvala herself.,1183593600,6,202,5.548387096774194
8012182,2,B0001GH5SS,"This movie has a low-budget, homemade feel to it.  I guess it was one of their very first films.  It's in black and white and the sound quality is so poor that sometimes it's difficult to understand what the characters are saying.  The Indian background music is often shrill and jarring, like fingernails on a blackboard. Also, the acting seemed pretty amateurish to me.  The story is quite slow, too, and for me it dragged a bit.  I would say this is only for the SERIOUS Merchant-Ivory scholar!",1140307200,18,497,4.6022727272727275
