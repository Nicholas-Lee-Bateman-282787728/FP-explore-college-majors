8347483,4,B001WAXX1A,"I was impressed with Jim Zuckermans stragedies to create creative photos by illustrating the tools you need to get the effects that you want. I feel the DVD is for more advance users of Photoshop but, even amatures can learn a lot from what he illustrates.",1294790400,,256,4.586956521739131
8347484,5,B001WAXX1A,"Amazing, absolutely amazing.  If you've ever wanted to look over the shoulder of a master photographer in his ""lab"", this is your chance.

Jim moves these projects along at a perfect pace, explaining the how's and why's as he goes.  He has a real easy going style and is very articulate.  As someone said earlier, you can watch these videos over and over again.

I also purchased Jim's ""Be a Photoshop Guru"" video, and feel the same about it.  In that DVD, he emphasizes particular skills (ie. Selection Tools), or methods, with the way he groups the lessons, rather than by photo-subject as in this one.  Both are packed with information and technique.

While these videos are not specific to any particular version of Photoshop, they are geared somewhat toward the most recent versions up to CS4 -- I can hardly wait to see what Jim does with CS5!",1272499200,,849,4.651006711409396
8347485,5,B001WAXX1A,"Create Masterpieces In Photoshop by Jim Zuckerman is all you need as a photographer. This is an excellent DVD as Jim is very patient and walks you thru his thought process in 8 projects. He illustrates every move that he makes, showing what works, things to consider and what won't work.

All the projects are excellent, covering the logical process of Photoshop. If you work with photographs, do post processing or just want to learn how to customize and improve your work, this is the DVD for you.",1264550400,,499,4.670454545454546
8347486,1,B001WAXX1A,"I purchased an earlier volume of this dvd series, with Tony Sweet as the host, which was informative, and well worth the money, with no technical glitches. As as result I purchased this dvd, which doesn't play on my dvd player, but plays as a dvd-rom on my computer, only you have to individually access the chapters using your computer menu. In other words doesn't play the dvd by itself, only as if it were a data disc etc. I emailed the company that released this disc, asking if it was defective or if was intended to play that way, and received no response whatsoever.",1262822400,2,573,4.466666666666667
8347487,5,B001WAXX1A,"""Photoshop isn't difficult to master, but there's a lot to remember,""  Jim Zuckerman told us in class and on this DVD.

In his online class, as in this DVD, Jim is both organized and easy to understand without lengthy background information. But the order in which the steps are given is paramount so listen carefully.

His DVDs allowed me to actually see what and how he did an action. And, the beauty of DVD was that I could play it over and over and over again, if I did not understand or missed something.

I'll purchase as many DVD's as Jim puts into the marketplace because they are so helpful in giving me the tools I need to be more creative with my work. I strongly recommend Jim Zuckerman's books, DVD's and classes.  He's an awesome instructor, photographer and creative thinker!",1243728000,7,790,4.574468085106383
