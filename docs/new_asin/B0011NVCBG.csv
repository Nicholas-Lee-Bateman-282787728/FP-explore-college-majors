I had been thinking about acquiring an Orleans CD and....voila!....this DVD shows up! I am glad it did. It's terrific!,1268438400,2,282,4.66
8241990,5,B0011NVCBG,"The harmonies of Orleans are wonderful.  You haven't really experienced Orleans until you hear them live.  The song selection is great and the video quality is top-notch.  Don't expect 5.1 sound, but the stereo sound is really sweet.  If you like Orleans, this is a must!!",1207526400,5,272,4.8478260869565215
