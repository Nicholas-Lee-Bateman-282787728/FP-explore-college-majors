4436066,1,B004NJC0DE,"First things first, I am a huge WWE fan and would never bash the company just for the sake of doing so. But I will be the first to admit that this was without a doubt one of the worst WrestleManias of all time. From before the pay per view even began, it had all the makings to be a bad WrestleMania when they announced during the countdown show that the scheduled US Championship Match between Sheamus and Daniel Bryan had been cut from the pay per view broadcast and moved to before the pay per view aired for only the live fans in attendance to witness.

Then the pay per view starts and The Rock cuts a promo not unlike anything we have already seen (mostly via satellite) that takes up the first fifteen minutes of the show. Now don't get me wrong, I realize that the event as a whole was telling a story and they had to build to the main event, but Rock shows up for one month and two guys who have been busting their asses all year long to secure a spot on the biggest event of the year get cut from the live broadcast so we can hear Rock say catchphrases we have all heard for years.

Match 1 - World Heavyweight Championship Match : Champion Edge vs Alberto Del Rio

First time in WWE history that a heavyweight championship match opens a WrestleMania, and this was a so-so opening match. Both men had spots where they weren't meshing well together, and Christian and Brodus Clay at ringside didn't help things much either. Edge retains after a spear in a match that would be okay for Smackdown, but not up to WrestleMania main event standards, especially for Edge who has been a sure thing for greatness at this event in the past. Rating - 6 out of 10

Match 2 - Singles Match : Cody Rhodes vs Rey Mysterio

These two men delivered a good match that would have probably been received better by the live crowd had it opened the show. Both superstars made the most out of the time they were given, and it was nice to see the heel Cody Rhodes pick up the clean victory. Definitely better than the World Heavyweight Championship match. Rating - 7 out of 10

Match 3 - Eight Man Tag Team Match : Wade Barrett & Ezekial Jackson & Heath Slater & Justin Gabriel vs The Big Show & Kane & Santino Marella & Kofi Kingston

The best part of this match was the storyline they did at WrestleMania Axxess the day before when The Corre attacked Vladimir Kozlov and eliminated him from this match. The WWE showed more attention to that than they did to this match on the pay per view. The match lasted under three minutes, and if the WWE doesn't care enough to give these guys enough time on the card, why should we care either? Don't blink or else you will miss Big Show's team win this one. Rating - 2 out of 10

Match 4 - Singles Match : C.M. Punk vs Randy Orton

Hands down the best storyline coming into WrestleMania. These two have been going back and forth for weeks playing can you top this with one another. The two delivered a great match with the time they were given, and unfortunately, the time they had wasn't enough. This match delivered with both superstars putting on a great performance, but it easily could have been a classic if it was given five or ten more minutes. Still stellar nonetheless. Rating - 8 out of 10

Match 5 - Grudge Match : Jerry Lawler vs Michael Cole with Jack Swagger in his corner and Stone Cold Steve Austin as special guest referee

Well, you knew going into this one it wasn't going to be anything special, as Michael Cole belongs nowhere near the inside of a WWE ring. They did the best they could to divert your attention to this fact by throwing Steve Austin in the mix as the referee. The usual revenge storyline with Lawler finally getting his hands on Cole, but this one went on way too long! Ten more minutes than needed, which again, could have been given to Sheamus and Daniel Bryan making their appearance on the actual pay per view. Lawler wins using Swagger's ankle lock on Cole, only to be reversed by the anonymous Raw GM (looking more and more like it will actually be Michael Cole) due to Austin physically putting his hands on Cole, leading to Lawler's disqualification and Cole's victory. Blah! Rating - 4 out of 10

Match 6 - No Holds Barred Match : Triple H vs The Undertaker

Easily the match of the night and as to why it wasn't the main event that closed out the show is beyong me. Halfway in, Undertaker hits the Tombstone but HHH kicks out after a two count. From that moment on, Undertaker did not get one offensive move in for the remainder of the match until the very end when he caught HHH in the triangle chokehold for the submission. Near the end, Undertaker tries to choke HHH who just shakes his head and reverses into a Tombstone, then crosses Taker's arms for the pin attempt and I actually thought the streak was over. Undertaker oversold being injured at the end of this one, and if you would have turned it on just at this moment, you would have guessed that HHH had won. Definitely worth watching again, and although nowhere near the matches Undertaker had with Shawn Michaels the previous two years at WrestleMania, this is the contest that WrestleMania 27 will be remembered for. Rating - 8.5 out of 10

Match 7 - Mixed Tag Team Match : Dolph Ziggler & LayCool vs John Morrison & Trish Stratus & Snooki

The tag team matches were plagued this evening, as this one was only given about four minutes. Trish Stratus and Michelle McCool did all the work in this one, as Morrison, Ziggler, and Layla were never even tagged into the match. Snooki does two moves and gets the pin and ends this debacle of a match. Rating : 2 out of 10

Match 8 - WWE Championship Match : Champion The Miz vs John Cena

This match started with about thirty minutes left on the broadcast, one of the latest starts for a championship main event in WWE pay per view history, let alone a WrestleMania. The crowd is absolutely dead for this one, and rightfully so. Neither superstar really did anything to bring life into this match, and the double countout decision was ridiculous for a finish. Rock comes out after they announce Miz still champion by way of a draw and demands that the match be restarted and is now no countout and no disqualification. The match begins again with seven minutes left of pay per view air time. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what will happen next. Cena throws Miz out of the ring, turns around into a Rock Bottom, and Miz makes the cheap pin to win the match and retain the WWE Championship. Miz and Rock have a staredown afterwards and Rock proceeds to deliver a people's elbow to end the horrendous broadcast. Rating : 5 out of 10

Overall - This WrestleMania really stands out as one of the worst ever, and at $64.95 for the pay per view, really makes you feel like you just wasted your money. Obviously this review is just my opinion, but other than Triple H vs Undertaker, there was nothing worthwhile or memorable on this event.

4436107,4,B004NJC0DE,"I was actually at this WRESTLEMANIA so this event is special to me but I also have to give an honest review. I thought that it was a really good WRESTLEMANIA except for the fact that it was a promo for the next one, but anyways now to the match card.

1. WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: EDGE(c) vs. Alberto Del Rio
 The thing that really surprised me was that this was the first match on the card. I wish they would have had it moved up to the top because this was a pretty good match that had me on the edge of my seat (no pun intended). This match was back and forth with moments that had you saying ITS OVER! and then it would keep going. The false finishes really had me going at the end of the match. I give this match 4 out of 5

2. Rey Mysterio vs. ""Undashing"" Cody Rhodes:
These two put on a great show. Cody was really impressive, and the way that they used Cody's facemask was great, it wasn't like ""come on really? this is stupid"" it was more like ""NNNOOOO COME ON REY GET UP, YOU CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN!"". I don't like the outcome but it was a great finish.  4 out of 5

3. 8 MAN TAG TEAM MATCH: THE CORRE vs. Big Show, Kane, Kofi Kingston, and Santino Marella:
The thing I don't like is that they took out Vladimer Kozlov of the match and nobody knows why unless you were at WRESTLEMANIA AXXESS while the CORRE took him out, so everybody else was wondering what happened to him while the commentators had to explain this. The match was too short, it had potential but they didn't give it any time at all. 3 out of 5

4. Randy Orton vs. CM PUNK:
This match was my ""WRESTLEMANIA moment"". I'm a big Randy Orton fan and when I was watching this match live I was screaming for Orton to get up and beat up PUNK but he couldn't pull it off. I was so dissapointed. SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT
but when PUNK got on the top rope and then when he jumped Randy jumps in the air and hits the RKO, I WAS GOING INSANE! Then he got the pin! great match but would have liked a little more even match, espically since randy was ""hurt""

5. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler vs. Michael Cole with special guest referee STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN:
This was one of the worst matches I have ever seen. It was so boring and IT LASTED FOREVER! Why didn't WWE put more time into that 8 man tag instead of this!? Horrible match 1 out of 5

6. NO HOLDS BARRED UNDERTAKER vs. Triple H:
I was so excited to see this start, but I was wondering to myself, why is this on before Snooki? really WWE snooki gets a higher match card ranking then the most anticipated match of the night? This match was great, a TON of false finishes and I was going insane hoping HHH would win. If your going to buy the DVD for one reason it should be for this match.

7. 6 PERSON MIXED TAG TEAM MATCH: John Morrison, Trish Stratus, and Snooki vs. Dolph Ziggler and Lay-Cool (Layla and Michelle McCool):
An ok match with a weird finish, I wish WWE would have done more with this but this is their excuse for the DIVAS MATCH. 3 out of 5

8. WWE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: The MIZ (c) vs. John Cena:
WWE is DESPERATE for people to like John Cena. They had Cena come out to a choir and a intro video talking about how he couldn't do anything or be anyone without God. How are you suppose to boo this? People still did but it just showed how desperate WWE is. The match starts out ok but then the Rock comes and beats up on Cena to promote WRESTLEMANIA 28..... really? thats how your going to end a WRESTLEMANIA, it was soooooooo dissapointing! One of two championship matches and it ends like this? I wish they could've just finished the match.

so overall a really good ppv and I would recommend it.",1326499200,3,3642,4.137199434229137

4436109,4,B004NJC0DE,"I'm not going to go through a play by play review of every consecutive match, but I am going to discuss the show itself. There were some good solid matches on the DVD. A couple of them suffered because of how much screen time the Rock was getting, but otherwise, they weren't all effected. A little shocking to see The World Title match at the start of the show, but Edge's final match was a good one. I've seen some wrestlers get a sub-par sendoff in their final match, but luckily Edge wasn't one of those wrestlers. The worst part of the show, and I think many people will agree, is the fact that Snooki appeared in a match teamed along side Trish Stratus and John Morrison. Seeing that no talent hack bumble around the ring was pathetic, and a slap in the face to the Diva's and any fans the Diva's may have. Luckily this match was one of the ones cut short due to the Rock's over-exposure at Wrestlemania. Seriously, the guy came out and talked about nothing important for the first 15 minutes of the show, and then had four more promos after that.

John Cena and The Miz could have performed a lot better than they did, because frankly, I've seen much better from both of them. The match ending was terrible, one of the worst of the last five Wrestlemanias.

Another match that suffered from the Rock's overexposure was the big 8-man Tag match between The Corre vs Big Show, Kane, Santino, and Kofi Kingston. It was a quick little match that could have been better. The same match was redone the following Friday on Smackdown, and that match is what the Wrestlemania match could have been.

If you're a WWE fan, you'll enjoy this, especially with the Undertaker facing Triple H in a no-hold's barred match that, while too long, was worth every minute you sat through it. But personally, I enjoyed the 3 previous Wrestlemania's a lot more than I did this one.",1320710400,,1864,4.476470588235294

4436112,2,B004NJC0DE,"I was glad to see Rock back. But did he need to talk for so long? That's what I didn't like him about him. His long promos, aside from the long promo he had on his return.

Edge vs Alberto Del Rio for the WHC - I was shocked when they had a Title match as the opener. And ADR was in it. Whatever happened to the RR winner going for his chosen Title in the last match. I could understand why it wouldn't if there was a anticipated match with lots of hype & buildup (UT/HBK II) but beyond that, it'd be nice for WWE to go back to tradition.
Anyway, I was surprised, but happy when Edge won. I was even happier than he won when I found out he had retired. It wouldn't have been great as an Edge fan to see him lose his last WM match. Del Rio's time will come. But I'm glad it didn't come at Edge's expense. I still miss Adam Copeland in the ring. It was a very diffult choice, I'm sure. But I'm glad he chose to retire (something Flair should really think about if he still had the brain required to effectively think) as it came to a battle between his love (WWE) and his life (health).

Rey Mysterio vs Cody Rhodes - Just like Rey's match at WM26, good but not enough time.

Kane, Big Show, Kingston, Santino vs The Corre (Barrett, Jackson, Gabriel, Slater) taking on Kane, Big Show, Santino Morella and Kofi Kingston - I'm not gonna even dignify this with a rating.

CM Punk vs. Randy Orton: 1 of the 2 matches that saved this event. Just a GREAT match here. Wish it was given more time. Worth the watch.

Then, the HOF Class Of 2011 came out. It was truly something to see as it is every year. The fans of the new generation get to see some, just some of the individuals, a small hand full of those who helped make WWE what it is & remain in business and that's putting their contributions mildly. The fans who were around when these individuals were active in WWE get to see some familiar faces they always saw on their tv screens.

Jerry Lawler vs Michael Cole: A WASTE OF TIME. I'm all for King finally having his WM match (thought it came too late). But Cole as his opponent??!!! It would've made sense for Riley to be his opponent. Now granted, I don't know if Riley was ready for a WM match or not, but from a storyline standpoint, it did make sense because King was feuding with Miz, whose apprentice is Riley.

The Undertaker vs Triple H in a No Holds Barred match - I thought the video package was very well done. For those who are wondering, the bgm was In Time by Mark Collie. It is on the OST to the 2004 Marvel film, The Punisher (which I think Kevin Nash had a part in). Anyway, there's some stuff here that's edited from the actual ppv. ""For Whom The Bells Toll"" (used for HHH's entrance) and ""Ain't No Grave"" (UT's entrance theme at the time) were edited out. I'm glad. Especially for UT. Ain't No Grave, it may have fit him lyrically, but musicially/sound wise, it didn't match the effect his previous theme had so I'm glad they put that theme into the DVD. Match Of The Night. It's the second match that saved this event (IMO, third time in a row UT's done this at WM. Of course, his opponents are to be credited too). Watch it. What else can I say? UT wins & goes 19-0. But he didn't leave in the same fashion he normally does.

Cena - Miz - One of, if not the WORST WM main event in history.

Should be watched for UT/HHH & Orton/Punk.",1312070400,14,3356,4.150769230769231

The Miz was the best match theyve put on together and that's not saying much, It was ok, better then previous matches as I said but not anywhere near being main event material.

4436116,4,B004NJC0DE,"OK, it was strange, the main event was the most brutal match ever due to the fact that the undertaker was out for the last 10minutes of the match, how many pedigrees does it have to take to mess a guys head up, and then his own  been tombstone piledriver done on him which shouldve finished him and it did, the UT still gets up, well sort of, a very bizarre match to say the least, 19-0 far out UT paid the price by triple h for sure, that was his most brutal victory.

The rest of the PPV was top notch, the rock as host that was over the top.

But mysterious by its absence, where was the 2011 Hall of Fame Ceremony, thats 1 of the reasons by i watched this dvd, its a good laugh and gr8 to see what these guys did in their careers to get them there.",1308787200,,752,3.9019607843137254
4436117,1,B004NJC0DE,"This Wrestlemania is filled with failed potential and missed marks.  The Rock promised that this Wrestlemania will be the most memorable one ever.  He was right, because it is by far the worst Wrestlemania ever.  The talent is there, but it is not being properly utilized and this train wreck proves it.
Let me count the ways....

1. Instead of The Rock's pointless 15 minute rant at the beginning, they should have featured the Sheamus vs Daniel Bryan match for the United States Championship.  Both superstars deserve the spotlight and are future headliners.

2. The first match is for the World Heavyweight Championship???  Alberto Del Rio winning the Royal Rumble was bad enough, that honor should be reserved for a headlining superstar.  However, WWE was pushing the new talent and thought ADR would be the man for the job.  WRONG.  He's a nobody.  Maybe in a few years he could be on a higher level, but not now.  Having this match first confirmed that the World Title means nothing and ADR is a jobber.

3. Snoop Dogg's skit lasted longer than the 8-man tag team match.  Both were terrible.  Wade Barrett (a future main-event headliner) was barely given any show time or significance.  This was just a waste of time and potential.

4. The Michael Cole vs Jerry Lawler storyline is completely awful.  Michael Cole is a decent announcer, but a bad trash-talker and a bad two-face.  At times, he forgets he's supposed to be feuding with Lawler.  The match was terrible as expected, Stone Cold's name alone saved this one, but......................

5. The anonymous Raw General Manager email storyline is possibly the stupidest thing WWE has ever done.  It takes all momentum away from the action, it's distracting, and when it interferes with referee decisions (reversing the outcome), it makes you wonder WTF is WWE thinking?  They are shooting themselves in the foot BIG TIME.

6. Weeks before the event, they were building up the tension between The Rock and John Cena.  That is what the main event should have been.  Nobody wanted to see Cena vs Miz.  Miz is another jobber.  All the fans wanted was to see Cena and Rock go at it to close the show, but instead of a brawl, we get 1 Rock Bottom....that's it.  After realizing that the horrid writing staff screwed this on up, they immediately tried to reconcile their error by booking Cena vs Rock for next year's Wrestlemania.  That's too long to keep the feud going, even as I write this 3 months later, WWE hasn't mentioned anything regarding the epic match set for next spring.  They missed a golden opportunity and next year will be too late.

CM Punk and Randy Orton gave a great performance.  Undertaker and HHH had a great match, but it was clear that Undertaker did little to get in decent shape for the match as he nearly killed himself.",1308441600,11,2805,4.717525773195876

4436120,1,B004NJC0DE,"Let me start off by saying first and foremost that this WM may have truly been the worst or at least one of the top 5 worst WM's of all time.  This is supposed to be their best and greatest show of the year right?  Well,if that's the case, they failed in that attempt miserably.  This was more like watching an amped up version of RAW then an actual PPV.  I was expecting more for 60.00 then this.  I honestly believe that their biggest problem this year was time management.  It seemed like all the important time was given to things that didn't matter or didn't do anything to forward the show.  The WM began with Keri Hilson singing America the Beautiful, then went to the Rock introducing us to WM and then a WM promo.  All of that took over 20 mins to do!  Couldn't those 20 mins have been spent going toward matches to improve the quality of the show?  I understand the America the Beautiful segment which has become a staple of WM in the past few years and even the WM promo in the beginning of the show but having the Rock talk and talk and talk and pause and pause and pause was just eye rolling.  After that we go to the first match

Edge vs Alberto Del Rio for the WWE World Heavyweight title:  This match was kind of suprising to be an opening match.  This was the first WM that actually started with a world title match and it was just okay.  There was some good back and forth action but the match didn't live up to its potential.  I still think it was a huge mistake to put Del Rio in a world title match in his first WM.  I think they should have had Christian win the Royal Rumble or a number 1 contender match and then challenge Edge for the belt in what would be Edge's last match.  Once the match was over then we see Christian and Edge take over 5 mins to destroy Del Rio's car that he came to WM in.  Again couldn't those 5 plus mins have gone to something else on the card?  At least Edge won though.  (7/10)

After that match we get a history (brief) of the match between Cody Rhodes and Rey Mysterio.  This match was good but at times it looked as though Rey was moving in slow motion.  I don't know if maybe Cody was scared he wouldn't be able to keep up and told Rey to slow down or what but sometimes it did look like that.  However, this was a great match with Cody pulling off the victory.  (8/10)

After that we go to this stupid backstage skit with Teddy Long and Snoop Dogg.  The story was that Snoop was looking for someone to come on tour with him and various superstars such as William Regal, Great Khali, Beth Pheonix, etc performed for him.  Finally, at the end Hornswoggle came out but he wouldn't talk so they passed on him and left.  Once Snoop and Teddy had left then he started to break out in a rap.  That was okay but the rest of the skit should have been chalked up and left at the door.  Again more time wasted on something that people really didn't care about.

Next we get Wade Barrett, Eziekel Jackson, Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater of the Corre taking on Kane, Big Show, Santino Morella and Kofi Kingston.  This match wasn't even worth watching.  I thought this was going to be a real slug fest and I actually went over to make a sandwich while the bell rung.  Seriously, no sooner had i put some meat on my bread then Big Show hit his KO punch and the match was over after only about a min and a half.  What was the point?  Seriouly!  (1/10)

Again we get another backstage segment with the Rock flirting with Eve and then Mae Young comes in and talks about the Rock's strudel.  All of this really could have been shown on Raw and we could have this time going to something that mattered.  The skit ended with Rock and Stonecold Steve Ausin.  This was worth seeing as these two had 3 of the best WM matches of all time.  The skit ends with them shaking hands.

Now we come to the second best match of the night:  CM Punk vs. Randy Orton:  These two really did pull out all the stops and created just a brilliant match on a card that was less then exceptional.  A lot of back and forth action and a great RKO at the end made this match just fun to watch and in my opinion maybe even a match of the year contender.  (9.5/10)

Up next, we get a total waste of time with a backstage skit between the Rock, Gene Okerlund and Peewee Herman.  As I write this now I can't even remember what this skit was about.  Up next we get the Hall of Fame class of 2011 introduction.  This was nice as it always is to see the past superstars.  This year we get Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Bullet Bob Armstrong, Sunny, Abdullah the Butcher, The Road Warriors, Drew Carey and Shawn Michaels.  Very nice.

Now we move onto Jerry Lawler vs Michael Cole:  Again more waste of time.  Tell me why did we need seperate introductions for Booker T as a special commentator, Jim Ross as another commentator, Jack Swagger as Cole's coach (he could have just came out with Cole) and of course Steve Austin as the referee (the only intro that made sense).  I feel that both Booker and Ross could have just been out there already with no intro's and Swagger should have just came out with Cole to save some time.  The match itself was over 13:00 long!  Are u kidding me.  This match should have been 5:00 or 6:00 mins tops.  This match was just flat out boring!  I will give props to Lawler as he did put on a pretty good showing and even executed a drop kick at one point.  I think everyone was waiting for the piledriver onto Cole kind of like the one he did to Andy Kaufman decades ago.  Unfortunatly, that didn't happen and it looked as though Lawler won with his punch from the middle rope.  Then, more time mismanagement as we get a celebration with Lawler and Austin, then Booker has to get into it and do a spin-a-rooni and get stunned, the lap top general manager beeps and Josh Matthews informs Lawler that he has been DQ'd because Austin got involved slighly in the match.  Due to this, Lawler got mad and pulled Matthews into the ring for another stunner and then some celebrations.  All of this probably went for over 8 mins and again more time that could have went to other matches.  (2/10)

Then we get footage of WM week which was okay and all the events that led up to the No Holds Barred match.

Now we get the one match that saved WM 27 as it was Undertaker vs Triple H in a No Holds Barred match.  On the DVD, as many people know, were some editing as they edited out Metallica's For Whom the Bell Tolls and Johnny Cash's Ain't No Grave, both of which were removed from the DVD set.  I think was due to royalities that would have to have been paid out if they used these songs.  Still, it would have been nice to see these included on the set.  The match itself was awesome and an early contender for match of the year.  What amazes me is for maybe the 5th year in a row Taker has arguably the best match on the WM card.  A lot of highspots and false finishes made this match what it was.  Some great moments:  Spinebuster through a table, tearing apart the Cole Mine, Triple H using the Tombstone on Taker, muliple chairshots (which I hear both were fined for due to the WWE's concussion policy) and of course the ending with Hell's Gate.  My only problem with this match was the post match stuff that happened.  When the match was over both HHH and UT lay on the mat exhausted which makes sense but then it never ends as both men try to get up and fall down numerous times.  Taker eventually has to be carted out of WM while HHH walks to the back.  Again more waste of time as this wasted over 8 mins.  Again time that could have went toward another match.  (10/10)

After this they announce the WM 28 venue for next year which is Miami,FL and then we get LayCool and Dolph Ziggler vs John Morrison, Trish Stratus and Snooki of Jersey Shore fame.  This match should have been the Trish/Michelle McCool show as vitrually the whole 3:00 of the match was them going at.  Don't get me wrong I love Trish but I would have loved to seen more with Morrison and Ziggler which could have happened if not for all the time wasting this WM had.  Snooki did suprise me by doing a cartwheel into a backflip to the corner.  That was okay but other then that this match falls flat.  (4/10)

Then we get seperate intros with The Miz and John Cena to set up the Main Event for the WWE Championship.  Miz's was really cool with him sitting in front of these big screens watching his life up to this point.  Very cool.  Cena's had a DMX prayer being said as a montage of his life was also shown and then he came out with a, what sounded like a, spiritual chorus singing him to the ring.  The match itself was decent but could have been better with more time.  I hate Cena but he does turn it up at WM and has had some great matches.  The Miz is just getting started in this business and I think he could have put on a career making match if more time had allowed.  The ending of the match was a double countout but then the Rock came out and stated that the match would re-start to which he performed the Rock Bottom on Cena and Miz actually retained the title (a big suprise!!).  After that, Rock beat up Miz and that's how WM ended.

All in all, this WM was pretty bad and I've seen some bad ones,i.e. WM 15, WM 20, WM 22, just to name a few.  I just don't get WWE's thinking with all the time wasting that it did during this WM which in fact was so much or so anticipated that they removed the Bryan/Sheamus match to a dark match and I was really looking forward to this match.  To me this WM was just poor, very poor time management and nothing against the performers.  Event as a whole:  (4/10)-and that's being generous!!",1306972800,2,9641,4.188248095756257

4436122,3,B004NJC0DE,"Whether or not you think this event is good or bad is up for debate. But here are a few of the biggest head scratchers:

1. Daniel Bryan vs Sheamus bumped from the event and replaced by what may be The Rock's lamest promo ever. Promos are for Raw! But hey, at least it made it to the DVD bonus features!

2. 8 man tag match lasts less than 2 minutes! Geez!

3. Was anyone really expecting more than a brawl from Lawler and Cole? However, this was totally botched by the stupid GM decision at the end. This should have gone the same route as Hart and McMahon last year. King and Austin should have celebrated, and that should have been it. Changing the decision and dragging this fued on even longer is truly mind blowing.

4. Snooki match was ridiculous. But hey, at least she got the boos she deserved.

And finally, the worst possible botch of all...

5. On the DVD, the entrance themes for both Triple HHH and Undertaker are changed. In particular, the editing out of Johnny Cash changed the whole dynamic of not only the entrance, but also the post match moments. Watching this event on PPV, the Johnny Cash song playing during the post match ""recovery"" was one of the most dramatic, emotional moments I can remember in recent years. Now, it just plays Undertaker's normal music. Tragic.

It was pretty disappointing to be honest:

1. After all the hype and build up, The Rock was in the event for about 10 minutes.
2. No substance whatsoever. Most of the matches were poor, even Taker vs. HHH. 5 minutes of action, 10 minutes of resting, it was a real drag, not to mention the way the WWE over souled both their finishing moves.
3. No atmosphere, no crowd energy.
4. Backstage segments were increasingly bad for a Wrestlemania event.
5. Main event was just awful, it got worse after the Rock showed up.

Edge vs Del Rio was ok, but just felt like a RAW! match, the 8 man tag match lasted 1 minute and the rest of the matches were either too short or lacked flare.

4436132,5,B004NJC0DE,"Everyone's entitled to their opinions, but I honestly can't understand how people can say this show was worse
than WrestleMania IX, or that it's the worse WrestleMania of all-time. This show had, what I believe to be, one of the
top three greatest WrestleMania matches of all-time, Triple H vs Undertaker. It was epic, it was classic and played into
the history of both characters to tell an incredible story that had the fans in the Georgia Dome going crazy! The PPV and
this DVD were, and are, worth getting for just this one match, easily!

It isn't uncommon for a WrestleMania to only have one match (sometimes just 2 or 3, if we're lucky) that fans truly remember.
Bret Hart vs Steve Austin from WrestleMania XIII is considered by many to be the greatest WrestleMania match ever,  but everything
else on that card was forgettable, however, you don't hear many fans calling WrestleMania XIII the worst ever. WrestleMania X is
another good example, it only had 2 matches that people still remember: Owen vs Bret and the Shawn vs Razor Ladder match.
I could keep listing examples, but my point is that this show, in my opinion, doesn't deserve to be called the worst WrestleMania
ever, due to the strength of Triple H vs Undertaker. WrestleMania IX deserves the dubious honor of being the worst, because there
is absolutely nothing worth viewing from that event ever again. However, Triple H vs Undertaker is a match I'll be watching years
from now. Maybe this year people were less forgiving because of the price tag, maybe the hype was so big that no matter what
WWE put on they wouldn't be able to satisfy the majority of the fans... who knows, but worst ever? Hardly.

The undercard was lackluster, no question. Edge vs Del Rio needed at least 10 more minutes before it could really get good, but
now that we know Edge's condition going into that match, it's a good thing they did keep it short. Rey vs Cody was solid, but it was
only ""Smackdown"" good, not ""WrestleMania"" good. Another 10 minutes and maybe they could've had a classic. Orton vs Punk was
another good match, but not classic or epic, again due to time. Speaking of which, this whole PPV felt rushed, with only Triple H
and Undertaker getting the time they deserved. Cena vs Miz ended just as it was getting good, and the Rock did basically the exact
same thing he did on Raw the Monday before, so it was nothing special. The rest of the undercard was forgettable.

While WrestleMania XXVII is not an epic and classic event in and of itself, it does contain one of the greatest wrestling matches
of all-time that every fan should go out of their way to see: Triple H vs Undertaker. I'm also looking forward to seeing Shawn Michaels
complete Hall of Fame speech in the HOF portion of this release.",1304035200,3,2766,4.604462474645031

4436135,3,B004NJC0DE,"First thing, this is my first ever review so hopefully I can be useful for reading this. Second thing, I been watching wrestling for almost a decade now and try to stay optimistic about the WWE. That being said, there are flaws and sense of unsatisfaction when it comes to paying $55 for a PPV. So here it goes, my first ever wrestling DVD pay-per-view...

(The Rock electrifies Wrestlemania 27)

The stage looks awesome like the past Wrestlemania and the pyro never disappoints. The Rock's music hits and gets an awesome reaction. The Rock mentions that history will be made and how this Wrestlemania will be unforgettable. Nice reaction, the time for The Rock doing this runs about 20 min. and just had me thinking, ""They could have added the Money in the Bank match."" I would have enjoyed that over The Rock's promo but still was something different.

1st Match (History in the making for a World title match as an opener)
World Heavyweight Champion Edge w/ Christian vs. Alberto Del Rio w/ Brodus Clay & Ricardo Rodriguez

His name is Alberto Del Rio!!! But you, you already knew that. Albert Del Rio wins a 40 man Royal Rumble, the first ever 40 man Royal Rumble, he is GUARANTEED to headline Wrestlemania and compete for the World title. I guess WWE wanted to make history for the expense of the Smackdown main event but it's not like Smackdown is important or anything (sarcasm). Which just goes to show you that WWE doesn't feel confident enough to give Smackdown the main event spot regardless of having the Royal Rumble winner. We get to see a pretty good opener and a lot of back and forth action going on. Brodus Clay and Christian only get involved on the outside  and distract Alberto Del Rio more than Edge. We see an awesome lucha libre leap out of Edge and a few moves that has you at the ""Edge"" of your seat. Edge would do his signature hair thing and would lead up for a spear. Your winner and still champion, the Rated-R SUPERSTAR, Edge!

Pretty good match from both men but would have been great if this match was last. I was expecting and hoping Alberto Del Rio to win but knowing that this was Edge's last Wrestlemania match makes you respect that he won.

3.5/5 Stars

2nd Match (Knee Brace vs. Face Mask)
Rey Mysterio vs. Cody Rhodes

As usual, Rey comes out in a Marvel costume and this time to the likes of, Captain America. Pretty cool but I still think Wrestlemania 25's costume was awesome. Well, we have Cody using his new persona to capture this ""Mankind"" sort of essence and would bring forth a pretty impressive offense. Cody Rhodes gets his Wrestlemania moment with this awesome Stalling Superplex. Real nice, and would just go to show you that maybe Cody Rhodes has that potential to be taken seriously. Cody Rhodes would expose the Knee brace and Rey would try to take off Cody's protective face mask. Ironically, a hit from Rey's knee brace would cause him the win and we see Cody Rhodes leave with a ""W"" by the end of the night.

I would be the first to admit that I wasn't to fond with this ""disturbed"" gimmick but Cody can cut some decent promos. I am glad he got the win because I will now interested if he has what it takes to be as legendary as his daddy, the American Dream Dusty Rhodes. Or at least well liked by the audience like another member of his family.

3/5 Stars

Promo Time! (I guess Snoop Dogg is a WWE employee.)
Teddy Long and Snoop Dogg cut an ""audition"" and has various WWE superstars to play American Idol for a minute. First person off, William Regal! Glad he gets some air time, sad that he had to rap. Very funny as usual with Regal but it'll get better. Yoshi Tatsu does a ""duet"" with Chris Masters to ""We will Rock You"" from Queen and was pretty funny how Masters flexes to the beat with his chest. Zack Ryder is next and FINALLY we get to see him on T.V. He karaokes ""Friday"" and unfortunately makes this infamous song manageable to listen. At least until Roddy ""Rowdy"" Piper gives us a nostalgic moment with a coconut (connect the dots). Snoop and Teddy leave after Hornswoggle shows up. Apparently Hornswaggle is the next Eminem with his little rap because the Brea Twins can keep up with the beat.
Not bad for a promo with various WWE Superstars and glad we got to see some superstars on screen again.

3rd Match (A last minute match that lasts for a minute.)
The Big Show, Kane, Kofi Kingston, Santino Marella vs. The Corre

~Sigh~ If WWE is going to advertise a last minute match, could they at least include no more than 4 wrestlers, whoops sorry, I meant ""superstars"". This is an example of how bad WWE can be at booking sometimes. We have The Corre and BSKKS enter and leave the ring in no more than 10 minutes, entrances and all. The match goes for about 90 seconds and we see The Corre's credibility gone before you can say ""This replaced Money in the Bank?""

It's a shame how so much potential can come out of the new superstars when give the PROPER time and opponent. I would have loved to see Ezekiel Jackson go up against The Big Show but I guess that won't happen for awhile.
0.5/5 Stars

(The Rock is backstage.)
Nothing significant happens here, The Rock is talking to Eve and tells her how he will create something special with anyone who comes from behind. Mae Young shows up and nothing real special until, Stone Cold Steve Austin shows up for a face-to-face confrontation with The Rock. Brings back memories from 10 and 8 years ago as they exchange a few words to each other. Awesome.

4th Match (The match that stole the night, up to this point.)
Randy Orton vs. C.M. Punk

Randy Orton would have the upper hand over the New Nexus and ""kick"" them out of action for numerous weeks. By far, one of my favorite feuds leading up to Wrestlemania that didn't involve a lot of talking. Punk would have the last word leading up to Wrestlemania by hurting Orton's leg by a monkey wrench. I won't praise this match too much but I will say this, if you are a WRESTLING fan than you will surely appreciate the psychological and story-telling that Orton and Punk have throughout the match. Punk takes control of most of the match and the reaction of the crowd is simply amazing. Orton would exchange some offensive moves, we see an ""Angle Slam"" and have us wanting more from this match. Orton would ultimately get his RKO out of nowhere and beat Punk.

I REALLY wished that this match would last longer. Reports say that their match was cut short and that Orton was pissed, wouldn't blame him. Really enjoyed this match and hope to see these two go at it for at least another couple of months.
3.5/5 Stars

5th Match (The tradition lives on! The tradition of painfully horrible matches that last too long.)
Jerry ""The King"" Lawler vs. Michael Cole w/ Jack Swagger, Stone Cold Steve Austin as a Special guest Referee.

~Sigh~ I wish this match could have just given us what the we wanted to see. Cole getting an ass-whoopin' of a life time and a stunner to Swagger. Unfortunately we have have Cole playing offensive over Jerry ""The King"" Lawler. Does WWE really have me wanting to believe that a ""journalists"" can beat a man that was competing for the WWE title just 6 weeks ago? For almost 10 whole minutes Cole is beating Jerry and gets him in an ""AnCole Lock"". As the match continues, Jerry would compete against Michael Cole of prolonging the agony of this match. Half way through I just wanted this match to end so I can see more ""wrestling"" matches. Jerry finally humiliates Cole by using the Ankle Lock on him and gets him to tap. I didn't know that this whole match was about prolonging the inevitable. I guess now that Cole lost Booker T is free to join Jerry to celebrate the win. Booker T gets in the ring and does a Wrestlemania size Spin-a-roonie and get stunned by Stone Cold. Before you say ""Finally it's over"" the GM's chime hits the Georgia Dome and we get an overturned decision. Austin pissed and stuns Josh Mathews. At least Jerry and Good Ole' J.R. are at commentary again.

I sure hope WWE kills this tradition of having long and boring matches on the card so that I feel like this I am watching something special.
1/5 Stars

6th Match (Ten Years later and the last outlaws in the WWE.)
No Holds Barred: Undertaker vs. Triple H

Awesome entrances from superstars and get the ovation from the WWE Universe like they should. A very emotional night for Triple H after inducting HBK in the Hall of Fame, having his best friends believing that he can't be The Undertaker, and not burying someone on Raw. I knew that they would be great the moment they met face-to-face on 2/21/11 and knew that we would see some great spots. Punches are exchanged, don't get used to watching them in the ring because they suddenly move to ringside. This is where we have Triple H receiving a nasty drop from the top of the announce table, the Spanish announce table being Spine Bustered by Undertaker's body, the ""ColeMine"" being destroyed, a suicide dive from The Undertaker. Real brutal and had be believe that Triple H would be the one, ""as in 18 and 1."" I sure like quoting people. Triple H hits the 3 Pedigrees and a Tombstone and still isn't enough. I guess the time has come, it's...Hammer Time! Right before he can use it Undertaker gets Triple H in his Hells Gate which lead to an very climactic ending.

Triple H has tapped out and has become of one of the few victims not to be pinned after a Tombstone from the Undertaker. This just goes to show you that even at the age of 40 they look like they are at their prime. The veterans of the WWE have yet again set the standard to what it is going to take to pull of a classic match at Wrestlemania. Undertaker would be carried out in a stretcher and have you wish this is his last Wrestlemania. I am one of those who believe that Undertaker should retire due to his injuries and age but then again, I am not The Undertaker.
4/5 Stars

7th Match (By this time I realized that the Sheamus and Bryan match is not going to happen, even though they ADVERTISED IT!)
Dolph Ziggler, LayCool, & Vickie Guerrero vs. John Morrison, Trish Stratus, & Snooki
~Sigh~ 3 things should not be here. 1, Vickie Guerrero in a Wrestlemania match (again). 2, this match with such promising talent. And 3, ""Snookimania"" because this was added 2 weeks prior to Wrestlemania. 2 WEEKS!!! Around same time the U.S. title match was added as well. I'll cut to the chase, Snooki gets the win after some pretty decent acrobatic moves and an unsure John Morrison in the background.

At least this match wasn't boring and long, it was fast and over with like a regular divas match (unfortunately). I really wish this was Kelly Kelly oppose to Snooki but Wrestlemania needs that celebrity, right Wrestlemania X-7, X8, 22, & 26, oh wait.
0.5/5 Stars

8th Match (The long and waited arrival of...The Rock.)
WWE Champion The Miz vs. John Cena

Yup, just what the parentheses says, the hold time everyone was waiting for the Rock to show up and cost John Cena the title. But before we get there we have their promos. I must say, REALLY impressive as in story telling and engaging videos I have seen out of WWE for such a long time. By far The Miz's promo to being the WWE Champion was awesome (no pun intended) because his name is imprinted with those of the previous WWE Champions. While John Cena's case, really emotion but I felt like I couldn't boo for Cena because of the choir. Yes that's right, apparently John Cena is Christian and decides to show off his new and brand new bright colored shirt. Not going to lie but a friend pointed out that it looked like a Confederate flag and I just couldn't help but laugh. After the choir stopped I just had to stop and think, ""What does Cena have to do to force me to like him?"" and I came up with a resolution, ""Maybe WWE should have John Cena go for the U.S. title or something. There were times when even Hogan would drop the title and have someone carry the WWF/E (at the time).""
Some pretty decent stuff, nothing really great but The Miz does kick out of an HUGE ""F.U."", oh I meant the ""Attitude Adjustment"". Sorry kind of behind by my times. Well for the FIRST TIME in Wrestlemania history, there was a DOUBLE COUNT OUT for the WWE title. I understand The Miz because his head landed on the concrete floor but Cena didn't had to clothesline him their. Well, cue The Rock because we couldn't have this atrocity happen to the ""biggest Wrestlemania of all time!"" Well let's say thing, The Rock doesn't need to be reminded of some Jabroni laying the Smackdown all over his candy ass.
The Rock goes for a Rock Bottom and The Miz gets the pinfall. Winner and undefeated at Wrestlemania, The Miz!

2.5/5 Stars (0.5 Stars down because of a dead crowd, if you can't get pumped for the main event what-so-ever then you've done something wrong.)

The guest host of Wrestlemania doesn't want to share the spot light so decides to give The Miz a Spinebuster and The People's Elbow to the Miz so that he can share a moment with the fans at Wrestlemania.

Conclusion:
Wrestlemania 27 was my first Wrestlemania with my college buddies and wasn't that memorable. I had watched a very entertaining Royal Rumble, a predictable but very entertaining Elimination Chamber, but couldn't get over the fact that these two pay-per-views that lead up to Wrestlemania, wasn't as entertaining compared to the last two. This is an example on why WWE shouldn't over hype an event when the can't deliver. When you add last minute matches and aren't really worth our time and money isn't really the best call. Wrestlemania X-7 had 11 matches advertised and most of them delivered. Why couldn't they take that from a decade ago and use it here? There is a reason why Wrestlemania X-7 is regarded as one of the best Wrestlemanias, all the matches had a decent time to wrestle, strong feuds were built up for weeks, and we didn't have the ""traditional"" boring matches that NOBODY wants to see. Moments like these make me want to see Cena in the mid-card helping the younger guys so they can Main Event Wrestlemania one day. I don't hate John Cena, great guy but maybe feud Ziggler or something so that there is a variety of ""superstars"" competing for various titles. Maybe trying going after the Tag Team titles or something. Anyway, I hope this review was helpful and tell me why we have a lot of Crusierweights and no Crusierweight title?",1303603200,2,14354,4.4856376867100725
4436136,1,B004NJC0DE,I was hoping that Wrestlemania 27 would requiem the WWE from the worst year of 2010. Come on The Rock being the host he's suck altogether coming back in the WWE the John Cena vs The Miz was a disspointing the match I thought was good was Undertaker vs Triple H this match save this year Wrestlemaia I give this One Star because WWE 2010 was noting more than a disspointing I hope 2011 will Requiem the WWE.,1303430400,4,406,4.217948717948718
4436137,1,B004NJC0DE,"This was simply the worst mania ever, I watched this...couldn't believe how bad it was.  I have watched wrestling ever since 1989.  It's never been this bad.  The worst part of this show is it seems like a RAW Episode...and the ending seems like a Nitro episode and every single match is gimmicked.  No straight matches without some kind of gimmick attached.  It was like the WWE crammed every guy into the show. I wrote a long review for a site but I will just keep it simple.

Daniel Bryan-Shemus:  I/C Title-US Title means nothing, if there was Sunday Night Heat this would have at least gotten broadcasted.  Warlord vs Bob Backlund 2011 is lumberjack match...since the wrestlers are all wearing their gear its no secret its not going to stay that way.  Becomes a promptu battle royal which the horrendous Kahli wins...but not the title since it wasn't on the line...which begs to wonder what the point was in the first place.

-Rock cmoes out and does RAW promo for like 20 minutes...

1-Del Rio is jobbed in a ok openner for the WORLD TITLE...why is this match first, who knows.  I guess winning the Rumble doesn't equal main event after all.  Some goofball that looks like Hugh Morris and Christian water down this match and the finish is gimmicked.  Moreless a Saturday Nights Main Event match not a mania one.

-backstage stuff that is not funny nor entertaining

2-Cody Rhodes in a mask-Rey in a leg brace.  Best match of the show, but saddled with the mask face thing.  Cody goes over which makes sense.  Gimmicking the match did nothing to help Cody's evolution.

3-Stupid tag match with Big Slow, Kane and the always entertaining Santiago.  They job out the Core in like 2 minutes.  Horrible match, no point.  Backstage nonsense lasted 5 times as long.  Gimmicked with stupidity

4-CM Punk and Orton have a RAW match.  This is the match for you...Orton has his bum leg beat on for like 95% of the match...hits RKO out of spot that he has done countless times before...the end.  How did this help Punk, or Orton?  Match bored me.

5-Lawler and Cole prove that pushing a match down your throat for months on end, all RAW long equal horrible and boring match that nobody cares about.  No piledriver...which was what everyone was waiting for.  Austin is dusted off and brought in a ref, thankfully stuns Booker T out of the commentary booth because he is just horrible. Worst match of he show.  Went on forever.  You would think they would have practiced SOMETHING beforehand!

6-HHH and his massive ego make Undertaker look like a charity case as he beats the crap out of him repeatedly and then get ""caught"" in a choke.  Crowd liked this match but seemed to like it before it even started.  Undertaker is like ritual applause.  He could go out there and work Vicky in a armbar contest for 20 minutes and people would go wild.  Match was ok, but HHH made Taker look like an old dog that needed to be taken out back.  HBK never shows which people were waiting for.  Worst part of this match is the Johnny Cash song they played repeatedly over and over again until you wanted to break your tv.

7-Snooki match, it was horrible...and very short.  Snooki does some handsprings and people are impressed...like Rodman and Taylor before her.  When people drop their expectations to the bare minimum they are impressed with the most simplistic mundane crap.  She goes pins an established wrestler and makes the WWE womens division look second par to some reality star who is overweight and drunk.  What kind of sense does that make?

8-The Miz beats Cena, which was a good thing since Cena doesn't need to win anymore to get over with the fans.  Match is horrible.  Cena is sloppy and jsut a terrible wrestling.  Tripping and Clumsy, match ends in count out.  Rock...of course comes out and restarts the match only to help Miz win in like 30 seconds.  How does that make Mix look anything but weak.  Match was like screw job finish Nitro.  Rock beats up Miz too, so Rock...a guy not even wrestling on the card celebrates with the crowd.  Huh?  Hogan Wrestlemania 9...but worse!",1302912000,9,4078,4.612273361227336
4436138,3,B004NJC0DE,"Wrestlemainia 27, we start the show with the Rock stating that this will be the greatest Wrestlemania of all time, and when we see the stadium, the crowd and the the Rock in the ring setting the mood before the event starts you nearly feel like hey, this could be the greatest Wrestlemania ever.........then it starts and you realise in the first match that it's going to sadly be very poor indeed.

The trashing of the car in the finale of the first match, Cody and his plastic mask just made this feel like a joke, when I watch wrestling, as I've felt for the last 28 years I want to escape, I want to believe and get lost in thinking what I'm watching is really true, but these two moments for starters really hurt this show badly.

The squash 6 man tag, should have been the money in the bank, the taker, triple H match was infuriating, there were so many times in this match after a big spot that the game should have gone for a pinfall, but he just kept sitting around like it was a last man standing match, there was no flow, just one spot after another, and even the crowd was bored to death with how long the ending dragged on with an injured taker getting out of there.

The Miz and Del Rio are small time and had no buisness being in main events, and the cole and jerry match was aweful, austin looked out of it to be honest.

Being a huge, loyal wrestling fan, wwe, tna, roh, czw, pwg, ....this was a very sad show, but even worse the show had to be wrestlemania, and I'm sure like most people its the show I get excited about most, and when its done well it can be the greatest thing I've watched all year, but not this year, and how short is the hall of fame now, crazy.

Aside from all this its wrestling, its wwe, its wrestlemania and the rock, and for a few brief moments it does whats its meant to do, and thats feel big and entertain.

Its worth buying, but its just a shame it was one of the bad ones.",1302912000,2,1921,4.136729222520107
4436139,3,B004NJC0DE,"I hate being disappointed by the WWE. Especially at Wrestlemania. It's supposed to be their biggest show of the year, and this is what they give us?

Well, it wasn't the worst WM ever, but it wasn't that great either. It was just average, with some bright spots here and there.

I'll update my review later on when the DVD comes out to add info about the extras and Hall Of Fame ceremony as I always do.

For now, here's my view of this disappointing show.

We started off with Keri Hilson singing the national anthem, which I didn't care for, not being American.

Afterwards, The Rock came out and cut a promo. I'm not a fan of The Rock and never have been. I think this wasted time that could have been used on wrestling. After about ten minutes, I was actually saying ""can we have a match now?!"" as Rock kept on going. He did his usual shtick and I was bored. Sorry, he doesn't do anything for me. The first match didn't start until over 20 minutes into the PPV! Ridiculous.

World Heavyweight Championship
Edge (champion) (w/ Christian) vs. Alberto Del Rio (w/ Brodus Clay & Ricardo Rodriguez)

Now that we know Edge is retiring, this match is quite special. It's Edge's final match in the WWE, and what a way to go out! I was surprised this opened the show, especially at WM. But I digress, cos this was a great match. I wasn't sure whether Alberto had the skills to carry a WM level match, but he actually impressed me, even though I don't like him at all. Edge was his usual great self, and I was cheering him all the way. Alberto dominated quite a bit of the match, but Edge got good offence in. Christian, Brodus and Ricardo provided drama at ringside, and it was good that none of them actually interfered in the match, only with each other. I was happy Edge retained as I don't think Alberto is ready for gold yet. The aftermath with Edge and Christian destroying Alberto's car was funny, especially Alberto's reaction - he was almost crying! Great match, one of the best of the night. (4/5)

Cody Rhodes vs Rey Mysterio

For some reason, I was expecting this match to suck. I don't know why I thought that, as it turned out really good. Cody was out for what he thought was revenge (although I don't think Rey actually did anything wrong). I have to say, I like Cody's entrance and of course Rey gets the crowd fired up. His Captain America costume was cool. As for the match itself, it was very good. Cody used his ridiculous mask as a weapon, and Rey showed off his usual bouncy offence. Things got intense as Rey managed to remove Cody's mask, and Cody took off Rey's knee brace. Both were used as weapons and Cody used the brace to win himself the match. I don't like the winner, but the match was good. (3.5/5)

Next was a funny skit backstage with Snoop Dogg and Teddy Long. Snoop is a WWE regular, and he's always been quite good. The skit was Snoop looking for talent to join him on tour, and WWE superstars auditioning. What ensued was funny, especially William Regal and Hornswoggle actually talking - he did a rap!

8-man Tag Team Match
Kane, Big Show, Santino Marella & Kofi Kingston vs. The Corre (Wade Barrett, Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel & Ezekiel Jackson)

Now this was just a waste of time and good talent. They had eight men to use here, and what they do? Waste them all on a 90 second match! I swear the match was over that fast, if you walked out of the room and came back in, it was done. The entrances took longer then the match! It's a shame, cos what we did see was really fun! I enjoyed Heath Slater getting the knock out punch and everybody hitting their finishers, but man, what a letdown. If you have a chance, check out the rematch from Smackdown right after WM. It's the same 8 men, but a much longer match! (1/5)

Next another backstage segment. This is the only time The Rock entertained me all night! He was talking to Eve about making a WM moment, and said he'd have a moment with whoever walked up next. Of course, the next person to appear is... Mae Young! I laughed when Rock and Mae exchanged funny lines. Afterwards, Stone Cold Steve Austin appeared and he and Rock had a faceoff. It was like a blast from the past, very cool.

Randy Orton vs CM Punk

This was a good match. Orton had taken out every member of Nexus over the weeks leading up to WM, leaving it just him and Punk one on one. Lots of good moves were used here, and Punk targeted Orton's injured leg. The injury affected Orton to the point where he couldn't use the punt, and Punk had the upper hand until he tried a top rope move, and the Viper struck with a RKO. Very cool ending and satisfying match. (3.5/5)

Next we had an annoying and pointless segment where The Rock tried to be funny and Pee Wee Herman made an appearance. It was stupid but seeing Mean Gene in John Cena's gear was funny.

Following this was the traditional introduction of the Hall Of Fame inductees. It was a nice segment, everybody got cheered. Sunny looked great, I was surprised at how old Drew Carey was looking, and of course, it was fantastic seeing Shawn Michaels get his HOF moment. He looked great and the crowd gave him the ovation he deserves.

Jerry ""The King"" Lawler vs. Michael Cole (w/ Jack Swagger)
Special Guest Referee: Stone Cold Steve Austin

I'm torn on this one. On one hand, it was fun seeing Cole and Swagger get theirs and great having Stone Cold as the ref, but on the other, it went on for way too long and the ending was ridiculous. Cole is a pompous idiot and the crowd were absolutely dying to see him get it. The bit where Jerry shook Cole's hand through the Cole Mine then squished his face up against it was hilarious. But Cole beating up King went on for longer then was necessary. Stone Cold was funny, especially when Swagger interfered. A nice touch was King winning with the ankle lock. The aftermath was stupid though with the Raw GM reversing the decision and giving Cole the win. Way to annoy the fans, WWE! Seriously. I was SO disappointed! And I love Stone Cold, but him stunning Booker T and Josh Mathews was unneeded. Oh, and of course, having the great JR on commentary was fabulous AND he stuck around for the rest of the show! This was fun when Cole got beaten up, but I hated the ending. (2/5)

No Holds Barred
Triple H vs The Undertaker

I like Taker's WM matches when there's actually a chance Taker could lose - when it's obvious he'll win, the match isn't as good. Triple H actually proved Taker COULD lose at WM, with this match, my favourite of the night. I predicted as the match began that we'd see multiple finishers and I was right - we saw three Pedigrees, two Tombstones (one from Triple H and one from Taker), a chokeslam, the Last Ride AND Hell's Gate. This was a grueling, intense match that had me on the edge of my seat. The moment when Triple H hit the Tombstone, I genuinely thought it was over and Taker's streak had been broken. I have to admit, I was supporting Triple H and had soured on Taker in recent months, but after the match, I was a Taker fan again. This match went 30 minutes and deserved every single minute of it! Triple H did make some odd decisions during it, there were times he should have gone for a pin, but didn't. But overall, I really, really liked this match. (4.5/5)

6-person Mixed Tag Team Match
Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi, Trish Stratus & John Morrison vs. Dolph Ziggler, Michelle McCool & Layla (w/ Vickie Guerrero)

The point of this match at this point in the card was to cool down the crowd after the Taker/Trips match. And that it did, it was just a bit of harmless fun. It was great seeing Trish in a WM match once again, Morrison did a great move to Ziggler outside the ring and Snooki actually impressed me. I loved her handspring elbow, it was impressive! I wish the boys had been tagged in, but this match was never going to be a five star classic. A bit of fun it was. (2/5)

WWE Championship
The Miz (champion) (w/ Alex Riley) vs. John Cena

What a disappointment. This shouldn't have been the finisher to WM at all. I love John to pieces, he's my favourite wrestler, but I thought he seemed a bit uninspired tonight, like his heart wasn't in it. And I usually love his WM entrances, but this one was silly and a bit preachy. The wrestling was fine, but I am not a Miz fan at all, I don't think he can wrestle at all.
At first, I was outraged the match ended on a stupid double count out, but then remembered The Rock. But that just made me even madder, as I knew Rock had it out for John. It was pointless him coming out and restarting the match, cos it ended pretty much the same way. It was just an excuse for Rock to get John. Lame. The end was cheap and made both John and Miz look stupid. Rock was just supposed to be the host, the match wasn't about him, he made the title and the match look insignificant, which is not what you want at WM. (2/5)

I was also very disappointed the US Title match with Sheamus and Daniel Bryan got bumped off to the preshow, cos I was looking forward to it. Then I read it got changed to a battle royal? I usually love those, but man way to cheapen your titles WWE.

I know my review makes it seem I hate WWE and I hated this PPV, but I honestly didn't. I liked some of the matches, but overall this was one of the most disappointing WM's to date. Not the worst, but definitely not the best. 3 stars/",1302825600,,9338,4.299943084803642
4436140,5,B004NJC0DE,"Undertaker vs HHH was a modern day brawl. Perhaps, not as good as Shawn Michaels vs Undertaker at WM 25 & 26, but this match made me believe that the streak would end. This match had great intensity. The Rock comes back to the WWE, after a 7 year absence to guest host the show of shows. Also, The Rock has an entertaining confrontation with SCSA. Edge vs ADR does start the show, but the match was a classic. This would be Edge's last match, for he retired on April 11th, 2011. Thank You, Edge. HOF includes Shawn Michales and The Road Warriors. Miz and Cena was cut short, but it was still entertaining to see what kind of role The Rock would play. This year's Wrestlemania is great, for it has modern superstars, but it also includes superstars from the ""Attitude Era."" If you are a wrestling fan, I reccomend this show.",1302739200,2,823,4.38562091503268
4436141,3,B004NJC0DE,"Every wrestling fan already knows that WrestleMania week is not only the biggest week in the WWE but also the biggest week in the business period considering how so many other promotions & associations base their events at the same time & location of Mania itself...however this year, WWE put out a press release at this same time stating that they no longer will have the word ""wrestling"" or anything related to that word referenced in their company as they want to be marketed as an ""entertainment"" company. Now what that has to do with this event is simple, WWE seemed that they were more focused on pushing the entertainment aspect of the show with a heavy focus on talking, backstage skits, celebrities, and promoting other projects instead of delivering what the name of the event stated...WRESTLEmania!

A couple of notes here in that R&B artist Keri Hilson did ""American The Beautiful"" while The Rock, the host of the event, came to the ring & cut a promo opening up the show...to the point where all of that combined took up the first 20 minutes of the show, Josh Matthews & Jerry Lawler did the commentary along with Michael Cole who was in his own ""ColeMine"" booth with both men trading insults on the commentary leading to their match later in the night, and the United States Title match between Sheamus & Daniel Bryan (both, how far have they fallen in a year) was moved to the pre-show...only for that to be turned into the traditional battle royal won by Great Khali...due to ""time restraints"" but as you'll read, as I'm sure have read from other reviewers, that they had the time but just wasted it with what they booked.

World Champion Edge vs. Alberto Del Rio - Alberto Del Rio wins the biggest Royal Rumble in the history of WWE to fulfill his ""destiny"" in main event WrestleMania for the World Championship...and it's the first match on the card? Anyways it should be noted that while Del Rio had Ricardo & his ex-NXT rookie Brodus Clay (who actually lost NXT to another guy who we haven't seen on TV since while Brodus is on TV every week) in his corner, Edge had Christian (who had beaten Del Rio twice leading up to this match) in his corner. Del Rio focused heavily on Edge's arm that he had been re-injuring for the past few weeks such as throwing Edge into the steps & ringside barrier arm first while also slamming it on the announce table, applying various armbars, armdragging Edge off the top rope, and even Clay ramming his arm into the ringpost leading him to dominate the first half of the match. Edge was able to start gaining back momentum & even was able to reverse the cross armbreaker into his submission hold (which is called the Edgecator in the video games) at one point while Christian took matters into his own hands with both Ricardo & Clay on the outside. Edge eventually was able to walk away with the World Title victory that had avoided him at the past 3 Mania's but pay attention afterwords as what happened to Del Rio's car wasn't pretty.

Rey Mysterio vs. Cody Rhodes - Cody was out for revenge here for no longer allowing himself to be called ""Dashing"" after the damage to his face while Rey wanted his own revenge for the attacks leading up to this event & for the record, the comic book outfit Rey has this year is Captain America. Cody used his mask as a weapon & targeted Rey's face with various headbutts & even going a springboard kick to the face onto Rey while also delivering impactful moves like Hardcore Holly's ""Alabama Slam"" & Davey Boy Smith's delayed vertical suplex from the top rope while able to keep breaking whatever momentum Rey kept trying to build throughout the match. Rey went after Cody's face as well including a headsissors to the outside with Cody's face smacking the ringside mat while later executing the 619 & a kick to Cody's exposed face. Both men went after each others weakness as Rey was able to remove Cody's mask & got payback for using it earlier while Rhodes was able to remove Rey's knee brace & had that play a factor in end.

Right around here was a skit with Snoop Dogg backstage looking for WWE talent to take with him on his upcoming tour & all I have to say if that your either going to love or hate this one but my personal highlights were William Regal (always underrated when it comes to his entertainment value) & the surprise appearance of a coconut throwing legend.

Big Show, Kane, Santino Marella, Kofi Kingston vs. The Corre - Santino's partner Vladimir Kozlov was suppose to be in the match but The Corre attacked him the day before during the Fan Axxess leading to Kofi taking his place. Bottom line, this match was exactly like another one on this card (I'll get to that later) in that it was ""just there"" as it was real short, only one tag was made during the entire match, and was just everyone getting their spots in the limited time they have. A waste of time & if anyone is actually interested in seeing these two teams have an actual ""match"", look for their 2 out of 3 falls match that happened later in the week on SmackDown because it will take you longer to read everything I just wrote on here than to just watch it.

We have another backstage segment here as The Rock was backstage with Divas Champion Eve discussing how he's going to make a special moment with whoever comes up to him next & he entertained me...on BOTH occasions in what I conciser the best backstage skit on the whole show.

Randy Orton vs. C.M. Punk - Orton came into this match with an injured leg & Punk focused directly on it with various stomps, even kicked the steps into his leg when Orton was chasing him on the outside, a modified indian deathlock, and even doing a top rope kneedrop onto Orton who was hanging from a tree of woe. This injury did effect Orton to the point where he wasn't able to push off his legs when Punk had the anaconda vice & even was able to do his punt. Orton was on the defense for most of the match but was able to get offense including an RKO that was one heck of a visual. Good match between both men.

The FOURTH talk segment of the night happened here where The Rock & Mean Gene Okerland met up with one of John Cena's biggest fans...and good thing Rock didn't say the ""secret word."" After that, we get the traditional introduction of the Hall Of Fame class with the head of the class being Shawn Michaels but another highlight also being the well deserved crowd reaction to the ""celebrity"" inductee of Drew Carey. I swear around here I'm having flashbacks to Johnathan Taylor Thomas playing chess with Bob Backlund.

Jerry Lawler vs. Michael Cole - Booker T & Jim Ross joined Matthews to do commentary during this match. This match was almost a carbon copy of the Bret Hart vs. Vince McMahon match from last year's Mania where it build for so long that people wanted to see Lawler beat the hell out of Cole & we got good moments with Cole hiding in the ""Colemine"", the interaction between Austin & Swagger, and Austin forgetting this is a ""PG"" show with his censored language. Unfortunately, the match was booked TOO LONG with Michael Cole on the offensive to the point where I didn't care if Lawler beat him up, I just wanted it over. The aftermath of the match actually entertained me more than the match itself.

No Holds Barred Match: Undertaker vs. Triple H - Both men started out trading punches with Taker getting aggressive first by tossing Triple H over the top, ramming him into the steps, and taking apart the spanish announce table. Triple H returned the aggression with tackling Taker through the ""Colemine"" & taking apart the english announce table...only to be slammed off it to the floor. A few scary moments happened such as when Taker did his famous dive over the top ropes to the floor & he wasn't caught by Triple H coming close to landing right on his neck while later Taker took a chairshot right to the head (just knowing about concussions now makes me cringe when I see that). Both men turned up the punishment various times such as a spinebuster through the spanish table, trading chairshots, a DDT on the chair, and both kicking out of finishers including 3 separate pedigrees to the point where Triple H was just screaming ""STAY DOWN...JUST DIE...WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU!?!"" Triple H said before this match that he was going to finish the streak or die trying...well those words rang true but after the match, he wasn't the only person who died trying to accomplish their goal. It was different than their match a decade ago at WrestleMania but this was one that could stand out on it's own.

John Morrison, Trish Stratus, Snooki from Jersey Shore vs. Dolph Ziggler & LayCool - See my review for the eight man tag, switch the names, and you get the same result here in that this match was real short to the point where only one tag was made & it was just everyone getting their spots with Snooki getting an ovation that would rival the one a ""celebrity"" Hall Of Famer got earlier in the night.

WWE Champion The Miz vs. John Cena - Before I get started, I have to point out how the prematch videos for both men were some of the greatest videos I've seen WWE do in recent history. This was one of those matches that started slow but picked up the pace with moments like Alex Riley getting involved, Cena executing his legdrop from the top from a distance while both kicked out of the others finishers including an ""A.A."" that hasn't been as impactful since back when he started doing the move as the ""F.U."" almost a decade ago. The way the match originally finished was a bit hokey (although Miz's head took a nasty bump on the floor that gave him a concussion) leading to the appearance & involvement of the one guy you expected to get involved for weeks. This match was good but then went a little downhill with everything leading to the finish & afterwords which we found out the next night (along with all the remarks between the two for the past month) was just to setup next year's WrestleMania main event.

DVD extras are scheduled to be the Sheamus vs. Daniel Bryan U.S. Title match that turns into the traditional battle royal, highlights from the final episode of RAW, and the confrontation between Cena & The Rock the night after RAW creating the main event of WrestleMania 28.  Also included will be the entire Hall Of Fame ceremony honoring Shawn Michaels, Bob Armstong, Sunny, Abdullah The Butch, Road Warriors & Paul Ellering, and (SHAKES HEAD!) Drew Carey.  The regular two disc edition will just have the event with no extras.

In the end, this would have been a great SummerSlam or I'll go as far as a classic lower show like Over The Limit or Extreme Rules but for WrestleMania, this really just came off uneventful to me. The previous Mania's has something that changed WWE as we knew it in either the change of a character or championship but we didn't get any here along with the fact that they had TOO MUCH talk (Rock's opening promo & all those backstage skits) & attempts at entertainment & plugging projects (Lawler/Cole and Snooki/Trish) that the actual WRESTLING was scarified in the process (Morrison & Ziggler's lack of participation, the eight man tag, Sheamus & Bryan being bumped off the show). I would give this 3.5 stars but since we can't do half stars, I'll bump it up to four for the bonus extras as this had some good matches & action when it was allowed to be but overall just came off like a heavily beefed up episode of RAW with guest host The Rock instead of WrestleMania.",1302480000,2,11474,4.511784511784512

Was it as good as 10, 17, or 19?  No.  Was it as bad (entertainment or match-wise) as 1,2,4, 9, or 11? Not by a long shot.  Was I upset that my favorite wrestler got cut from the show?  Yes.  But the question that really matters is ""Was I entertained?""  Without a doubt yes.
The show had some good moments, some great moments, and a few eye-rolling moments, but for the most part, it entertained (which is what WWE is supposed to do).  The Rock had the crowd in the palm of his hands at the beginning.  Edge/Del Rio was a good match.  Rey rarely disappoints, and he put on a good match with Cody.  Punk/Orton was good as well, and HHH/Undertaker was a classic.

4436144,3,B004NJC0DE,"No that isn't a typo, maybe a bad attempt at a joke but this Wrestlemania is basically like a long drawn out episode of Raw and honestly sans a few matches wouldn't qualify as a good long episode of Raw or Smackdown.

We start out with a 10-15 minute promo from the Rock which in my opinion was pretty typical and weak especially for Rocky, but at least the crowd seemed somewhat into it. This couldve been cut down and had the time used towards the coming matches.

-Edge (Champion) vs. Alberto Del Rio: World Heavyweight Title Match-Very very bad idea to have this open the show, especially after the great 2 month build-up between these 2 wrestlers. Don't get me wrong the crowd popped big for both men, Del Rio's entrance was great and the robe he wore seemed like he was paying homage to Mil Mascaras. Good pacing throughout the match, Del Rio kept targeting Edge's arm like he had been for weeks leading up to this match. Edge also got in good offense even locking in his Edgecutor submission move. The crowd did seem to be cheering Del Rio nearly as much as Edge. The finish does come a little too quick with a spear out of nowhere by Edge for the win in about 12 mins. This didn't make sense to me as Del Rio was made to look like a total fool after getting a major league push since his debut, only to have Edge beat him and along with Christian destroy Del Rio's car, which went on way too long and was quite frankly boring. 6/10.

Some backstage segment with Snoop Dogg and Teddy Long looking for some more talent for Wrestlemania (or something stupid like that)-Total yawn, especially with the appearance of Hornswoggle. Waste of time.

Cody Rhodes vs. Rey Mysterio-Due to Rey's injuries halting enough decent face-offs before this, the build-up for this match seemed a little under-whelming, but Cody sure brought his A-game to this match. The Captain America outfit by Rey continues his tradition of comic book/movie inspired attire, but adds little to the bout. Cody pulls off some nice moves like a delayed veritcal suplex, and a jumping kick in the corner to Mysertio. Rey also pulls off some good moves after he takes off Cody's protective mask. The finish comes when Cody uses Rey's knee brace to knock him out then hits his Crossroads neckbreaker for the win. 8/10.

Eight Man Tag Team Match: Big Show, Kane, Kofi Kingston and Santino Marella vs. Wade Barrett, Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel and Ezikiel Jackson: Thrown together tag team match and given maybe 2 mins before Big Show hits Slater with the knockout punch for the win. Really lame how short this was. 2/10, only cause Slater made the finish look good. They could've made this a Money In The Bank Match and it would've been at least decent.

C.M. Punk vs. Randy Orton: Great build-up and a good paced match, Punk is perfect as a heel (best decision WWE has ever made in recent memory regarding a character) and Orton is great as well. Both men pull off great moves, Punk focused on Orton's leg with moves like an Indian Death Lock and a Figure Four on the ring post on Orton. Orton also sold the leg injury well. The match was well done even if the finish was totally obvious as Punk sprung off the top rope towards Orton and Orton hit an RKO for the win. 8/10.

Grudge Match: Jerry ""The King"" Lawler vs. Michael Cole (Jack Swagger in his corner), Special Referee Stone Cold Steve Austin. All the build-up for months upon months and this is the result? I didn't expect anything classic but hell if the pacing was any worse and any slower the match would've started going backwards. Poor Lawler having to be subjected to this being his first and sadly probably only Wrestlemania match. Constant interference by Swagger which was expected, a little interference by Austin (again expected), the finish with Lawler winning with the ankle lock was nice but the GM reversing the decision and awarding the match to Cole via DQ was pathetic. 1/10. Swagger was great in the match though I'll give him that, trying to pump up the crowd and get heat for Cole. Still sad to see Swagger as Cole's stooge after being the Money in the Bank winner at last year's Wrestlemania.

Triple H vs. The Undertaker: Great entrances by both men, Triple H's Thor inspired theme was great, complete with Metallica's ""To Whom The Bell Tolls"", Undertaker's was impressive though the Johnny Cash song is a bit of a mood killer. The pacing is pretty slow, though the moves they pull off are impactful, like a spine-buster by Triple H through the announce table and Taker's dive to the outside looked painful. After this the match dissolves into each wrestler hitting finishers one after another, including Triple H hitting 3 pedigress (the last 2 of which looked really bad). Triple H hit Taker with numerous chair shots and kept telling him to stay down, paying homage to Wrestlemania 26 with Taker and Michaels. The finish comes when Taker locks in Hells Gate out of nowhere and after semmingly forever Triple H finally taps out. 7/10. The whole build-up and the match felt like they were trying to force a storyline and it didn't really work.

Mixed Tag Team Match: Dolph Ziggler & Laycool vs. John Morrison, Trish Stratus and Snooki: For reasons that escape me Snooki was put into this match as opposed to an actual diva who had been feuding with Laycool (like Kelly Kelly or Beth Phoenix). The match was ur basic mixed tag match, though Snooki did display at least some athletic talent and even scored the pinfall on Michelle McCool. 2/10.

John Cena vs. The Miz (Champion): WWE Title Match: Pretty pedestrian for a main event, though Miz did hold his own in his first Wrestlemania main event, especially since he'd been pushed to the background cause of the conflict bewteen the Rock and Cena. Miz did kick out of a huge attitude adjustment which was impressive. The double countout finish was lame, though Miz took a hell of a bump on the concrete landing on the back of his head. The Rock expectedly comes out, restarts the match and of course nails Cena with a Rock Bottom allowing Miz to retain the title. Very predictable and basic main event with a poor finish. 4/10.

This was easliy one of the worst Wrestlemania's even with the Punk/Orton, Taker/Triple H and Rhodes/Mysterio matches it was very sub-standard.",1302220800,5,6271,4.62533692722372
4436145,4,B004NJC0DE,"It seems pretty clear lots of folks were not very satisfied with WrestleMania 27, which rocked before over 70,000 fans in Atlanta. A popular opinion is that there just was not enough quality in-ring action to satisfy the hardcore wrestling fans. But, considering WWE is shifting to a business model that is more entertainment-based than wrestling based, the show is not as bad as some have claimed. The inclusion of The Rock, ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, television star (I use that term loosely) Snooki, and even an appearance by Snoop Dogg is further proof that the company was focused on presenting a show that had a little bit for purists, a little for more casual fans, and even something for people who might not have even considered watching a WWE program before, and I think that is what we got.

Despite the gripes that there was just not enough good ""wrestling"" at WrestleMania 27, several matches delivered. The World Heavyweight Title match with Edge vs. Del Rio was a quality opener, with Edge retaining the gold. Orton and Punk showed solid chemistry in the ring, and the RKO finish to a leaping Punk was a thing of beauty. The Undertaker-Triple H match seems to be love-hate for a lot of folks, but it was an emotional duel and quite suspenseful. Undertaker looks more and more like he's being held together by super glue and duct tape, so the vulnerability that he showed in this one really contributed to the story of the match and the importance of ""The Streak."" The Rhodes-Mysterio match was also a pleasant surprise, as Cody showed some potential and worked well with Mysterio.

Then, there is the King-Cole match-up. I've read that it went too long. I've read that the ending was stupid. I've read that Sheamus-Bryan should have replaced this. But to criticize this match for its in-ring quality is just foolish. Cole is an announcer folks. King is an all-time great and Hall of Famer, but at this stage of his career he's not necessarily going to pull a gem out of Michael Cole. But having Jim Ross and Booker T on commentary, seeing Stone Cold constantly struggling to keep a straight face while refereeing the match, seeing Cole in his ridiculous wrestling gear and tapping out endlessly when he was placed in the ankle lock, Jack Swagger's cheerleading, and Stone Cold Stunners for Swagger, Booker T, and Josh Matthews, was pure gold and made up for the lack of in-ring execution. Again, while all the comedy and showmanship in the world probably did not satisfy hardcore wrestling fans, and reasonably so, the match served its purpose for the entertainment-based theme of the show.

The main event featuring Cena and The Miz has been unfairly criticized as well. This match did not stand much of a chance to be a classic considering that WWE spent more time building up Cena and The Rock than Cena and The Miz. Still, Miz performed well, showing some in-ring psychology and managing to escape the STF as well as a huge Attitude Adjustment (I love how Cena just tosses people over his shoulder for the AA rather than slamming them). The crowd never really got into the match and watching it at home I wasn't necessarily on edge, either, because it was basically a given that The Rock was going to cost Cena the title, and when it actually happened, it was not nearly as electrifying as it should have been because of the bogus double-count-out finish. Although Miz was largely overshadowed in this match by Cena and The Rock, he fought Cena tough and probably gained some respect from fans that were skeptical about him being in the main event at WrestleMania.

So, while many WWE purists will claim this edition of WrestleMania was one of the worst of all time, I think if you watch the event a couple times you'll realize that considering WWE is more entertainment-based than wrestling-based these days, you'll find that the show actually delivered both solid wrestling action (Edge-Del Rio, Orton-Punk, Taker-HHH, Rhodes-Mysterio) and solid entertainment value (Rock-Cena, Stone Cold, Snooki, Cole-King). Recommended for collectors definitely but also recommended for fans willing to accept that the event was not intended to satisfy only hardcore wrestling fans.",1302220800,2,4189,4.8545454545454545
4436146,4,B004NJC0DE,"I was there in person for this year's WWE Axxess, Hall of Fame induction, and Wrestlemania 27. I am really looking forward to this DVD coming out, it is the last piece of the experience I need to remember it. WWE put on a good show this year. The matches were pretty good; there weren't any horrible matches, even the dark match that started as a lumberjack match that was turned into an impromptu royal rumble match.
Now if you're sitting at home comparing these matches to some of the best you have ever seen, it may be disappointing. There was nothing on the level of The Undertaker vs. Mankind Hell in a Cell match, and there were no ladder matches, but it was still very entertaining. You have not experienced one of The Undertaker's entrances until it is at Wrestlemania, with the crowd buzzing in anticipation, and as soon as his bell tolls, over 71,000 people go berzerk at once. Then the lights go out and the crowd roars again. THAT was the highlight of Wrestlemania for me; experiencing it as part of a live audience, and seeing The Undertaker extend his undefeated streak to 19-0. Word on the street is that next year's Wrestlemania will probably be his last one, so he can retire at 20-0.
To really appreciate Wrestlemania, you have to see one in person. It is so much more intense and exciting in person. As for some of the matches not being as intense as in the past? Well, what do you expect? This is the new PG era, not the Attitude era. Ladder matches and Hell in a Cell matches shorten careers.
One final word of advice I have is that if you do go to Axxess, and you want to get autographs, spend a few extra bucks and get the VIP tickets, or else you'll be standing in line for an hour for 10 seconds of face time with each star. I saw many people signing autographs, including Paul Bearer, Drew Macentire, Kevin Nash (Diesel), Sheamus, The Undertaker, Cody Rhodes, and Teddy Long. But they all had long lines. I hope they include some footage from Axxess and the Hall of Fame on this DVD.",1302048000,,2009,4.403225806451613
4436147,3,B004NJC0DE,"Overall PPV Rating: 6/10

World Heavyweight Championship match: - This was pretty good, but they messed it up by having it start the show. I think its the best match of the night.
Edge(c) vs. Alberto Del Rio: ***1/2

Cody Rhodes vs. Rey Mysterio: ***  - Some good action, one of the better matches on here.

The Corre vs. Big Show, Kane, Santino Marella, and Kofi Kingston: N/A - its too short, about a minute, this could of been good if they done it right.

CM Punk vs. Randy Orton: **1/2  - The match was kind of slow and its just average.

Stone Cold Steve Austin as Special Guest Referee:
Michael Cole vs. Jerry Lawler: **  - This match should of been on Raw, some funny parts, but not worth a PPV spot.

No Holds Barred match:
Triple H vs. The Undertaker: ****  - Very slow paced match, a lot of people overrate this match. It starts with brawling and then basically a bunch of finishers, I guess I'm use to more faster paced matches.

Dolph Ziggler and LayCool vs. John Morrison, Trish Stratus, and Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi: *1/2

WWE Championship match:
The Miz(c) vs. John Cena: **  - This match was the most disappointing match on here, the ending wasn't very good either. They could of done something great here, maybe I just can't deal with WWE putting entertainment over good wrestling, it seems like the wrestling comes second to promos. I was actually looking forward to this match, but I guess they will never change if they have the same writers.

Overall this Wrestlemania was boring and disappointing, some people are over hyping this show and it didn't deliver. The video packages and pyrotechnics don't save this show from being bad. The comedy segments were pointless and stupid and they didn't show the Daniel Byran vs. Sheamus match, but they had to show Lawler vs. Cole instead? I like The Rock, but hosting the show didn't help it. If you like this show, you must have low expectations in pro wrestling because this was just bad.",1301961600,4,1953,4.574712643678161
4436148,3,B004NJC0DE,"Wrestlemania kicked off with the peoples champ the rock who came to the ring with what i believe was a great promo to kick off the ""show of shows"". It was the same old same old from rocky which we have all come to love (dont act like you don't love the rock) and rock does his job getting the huge mass of people ready for the big night ahead.

1. Edge VS. Alberto Del Rio for World Heavyweight Championship

This was the opener to mania WTF???? I still cant believe this opened the show i think it was very disrespectful to the workers involved. After what i believe was a great build to this match i don't think edge and del rio let us down. As you will see in the rest of my review this match just didn't have enough time finishing up at about 12min. Opening the show and the short amount of time this just doesnt make this match feel that important nontheless i think this match was very good. A lot of fast paced action and happy to see edge get that win a mania he hasn't had in a few years now. Good match but to short 7/10

2. Cody Rhodes VS. Rey Mysterio

After a segment from snoop dog which was a waste of time we get this match which i believe was very good but once again time is a factor. Had they had maybe 5 more min this match could have been very good i think rhodes and mysterio worked well together and pulled out some pretty sick moves useing rhodes face mask. Overall this match was good but just a little short and was missing something i cant exactly put my finger on 7/10

3. Kane, Big Show, Santino Marella, and Kofi Kingston vs. The Corre (Wade Barrett, Ezekiel Jackson, Justin Gabriel, and Heath Slater)
Waste of time only a 90 sec long which was absolutey stupid this was a total waste and this would have been a great time for the US championshio match. Waste of time and waste of talent 2/10 (being nice)

4.  Randy Orton VS. CM Punk
Great match and great story telling in the ring by both men. Punk and orton really are something when they get in full ""character mode"". Its truly something amazing to watch atlest for me and this match i believe had a good time on it at about 15min these two tore the house down imo. Great match great endind 8/10

5. Michael Cole (with Jack Swagger)VS. Jerry Lawler W/ Austin as special guest referee
I love the king and its great to see austin back but not even these two legends could have saved this. The match went way to long and seemed to drag on with a funny moment thanks to king and austin but ruined by a stupid ending and way to much time allowed. gotta love the king and SCSA and i for one am sick of cole 3/10

6. The Undertaker VS. Triple H-No Holds Barred match
This match was amazing the inring storytelling by both men was breathtaking. The match started out slow and never really picked up a fast pace but that wasn't the main objective of this match. Both men wore each other down and HHH with is great throwback to WM26 yelling to taker to ""STAY DOWN"". Not as good as the UT/HBK matches but still damn good effort on both mens parts this match imo is a classic. Amazing match have to see it to believe 9/10

7. Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi, Trish Stratus and John Morrison defeated Dolph Ziggler and LayCool (Layla and Michelle McCool) (with Vickie Guerrero)-6 person mixed tag team match
Another waste of time and talent morrison and ziggler are way to talented for this kinda wrestlecrap but great to see trish back in action i must say. Thank god its not long 2/10

8. John Cena VS. The Miz for WWE Championship
This really was john cena and the rock with the miz but all in all i do think these two pulled off a decent match not a classic by a long shot its not even good but decent. After a stupid double countout which should never happen let along at mania the rock makes his presence known demanding the match to be restarted only to rock bottom cena and cost him the title. I feel miz will become a bigger star cus of this and cena and rock as of this writing 4/5/11 are expected to settle the score at WM28 next year so we shall wait and see what happens. Decent match great to see the rock close wrestlemania 6/10

Overall this mania will go down as the night rock cost cena the WWE title but ill remember for other reasons mostly the World title match punk/orton and of course the no holds barred match. This wasn't the best mania but far from the worst as well could have been booked better with more time for some matches but overall a good show with solid wrestling for the most part 7/10",1301961600,,4485,4.214452214452215
4436149,4,B004NJC0DE,"The Edge-Alberto Del Rio-World title match was a enjoyable/entertaing bout and the same goes for the Cody Rhodes-Rey Mysterio match. The 8 tag team match was short but sweet. The Randy Orton-CM Punk match was a hard-hitting/pretty good bout. The Michael Cole-Jerry Lawler was a awful,sloppy,stupid brawl and just as bad as The Jimmy Hart-Mancow match from WCW Spring Stampede 2000. The HHH-Undertaker match was a smash-mouth,hardcore,hard-hitting showstealer. The 6 person mixed tag team match starring Snooki was awful and too short with her making the pin even worse. The John Cena-The Miz-WWE Title match was pretty good even with The Rock getting involed in the brawl. Overall,It's not great but still pretty solid and still better then WrestleMania 9. I give this event a 7 out of 10.",1301961600,,789,5.124031007751938
4436150,1,B004NJC0DE,"World Champion Edge Vs. Alberto Del Rio - This match made history as it was the first time in WrestleMania history that a World Title match was the opening bout. Edge was selling his injury as he came to the ring with his arm heavily taped after the numerous attacks Del Rio dished out to Edge over the past month to Edge's arm, even performing a Con-Chair-To to Edge's arm one time. From the start, Del Rio targeted the arm all throughout the match with a number of attempts of trying to lock in his Cross Arm Breaker but never successfully locked it in. There was a few good spots and counters with Chritian and Brodus Clay creating a couple of their own spots on the outside too but nothing that's WrestleMania quality. These two had an awesome build up going into the match but unfortunately, the match didn't deliver. Del Rio's and Christian's Steel Cage Match that was aired on free TV weeks prior was better than this. 3/5

Rey Mysterio Vs. Cody Rhodes - As far for wrestling wise, this was the best match of the night which tells you something about Cody Rhodes and proves why Rey hand picked him for this match tonight. Outside of his series of matches with Ted DiBiase against DX, this was the best I've seen Cody in a match where at one point even delivering an impressive standing delayed suplex from the second rope. These two made the best of the time they were given and this match was a good match to portray Cody's new heel character. 3.5/5

Corre: Wade Barrett, Ezekiel Jackson, Heath Slater, & Justin Gabriel Vs. Kane, Big Show, Santino Marella, & Kofi Kingston - For the trivia buffs out there, this was the Big Show's 11th Wrestlemania and for the record, it was the 7th time TBS was involved in a multi-man match at the biggest stage of the year. But as much for the match goes, it was literally over by the time it took me to get done writing these two sentences. 0.5/5

Around here, they cut a backstage segment where the WrestleMania host, The Rock, runs into a long time rival, Stone Cold Steve Austin.

C.M. Punk Vs. Randy Orton - Weeks leading up to this match, Randy Orton took out every member of the New Nexus with punts to the head which made this match against CM Punk strictly one on one. And like Edge earlier, Randy came to the ring with his knee heavily bandaged that was injured on the previous episode of RAW which allowed Punk to focus on taking out the leg and inflecting damage to it. Even using the ring post to apply a Bret Hart-like figure four leg lock and also executing an old school Indian Death Lock at one time in the match. From there, the match progressed at a good pace with both men able to come up with counters of their own and performing their signature moves such CM Punk locking in his Anaconda Vise and Orton scoring with his hang's man DDT from the second rope. The match began to die down as it grew to the end and the finish was good but very predictable and you could see it coming from a mile away. 3.75/5

Jerry ""The King"" Lawler Vs. Michael Cole w/ Stone Cold Steve Austin as the Special Guest Referee - This is a match that has been boiling since Cole began riding The Miz's love train ever since the summer of 2010 and costing Jerry the WWE Championship on a number of occassions. They brought in Booker T and good ol' Jim Ross to join Josh Matthews on commentary for this one which is the only good part about this horrendous match is hearing JR back on commentary. Like what other reviewers pointed out, this match went on for way too long which in the long run, actually helped to hurt the PPV even more. In the end, Lawler wins after using Jack Swagger's ankle lock but only to get the decision reversed by the RAW's anonymous GM for Steve Austin putting his hands on Michael Cole that led to Lawler being disqualified and Cole's WrestleMania win. 0.5/5

Triple H Vs. Undertaker (No Holds Barred Match) - On paper, this is a kind of match that defines WrestleMania with the storyline going in being built up as who is the WWE's ""one last outlaw"" and HHH declaring weeks prior to this match he was going to end the streak or die trying. HHH and Taker went at it from the gecko to the point HHH speared Taker through the ""Cole Mine"" within the first 2 minutes of the match. Afterwards, HHH took a 10 feet fall back first after being backdropped off the announce table to the floor that appeared to have broken HHH's ribs. From there, Taker and HHH proceeded to endure more punishment onto each other while destroying an announce table in the process and using a steel chair onto one another. Midway in the match, HHH scores with his Pedigree but to the delight of many fans out there, Taker didn't stay down. After the first Pedigree, HHH mostly stayed in control of the match until the very end, with Taker getting in little offense (executing a Last Ride and Tombstone being about it), to the point HHH had to use Taker's own Tombstone to try to end the streak and going so far to introduce a sledgehammer to the match only before getting caught in Hell's Gate. By the way Undertaker oversold his injuries after the match, you would've never known Triple H was the loser of the match. But overall, this match was nowhere near on the same caliber level of Taker's matches with Shawn Michaels the past 2 WrestleManias and honestly, I didn't see much of a story being told in the match. Yes, HHH did everything he could to end the streak but we saw Shawn Michaels do the same thing 2 years in a row and managed to tell a story in the process. All HHH and Taker did was hit their big moves and that was pretty much it. But I will give the devil his due, it was still an amazing match and without a shadow of a doubt the best match of the night and probably will be the only match WrestleMania 27 will be remembered for. 4/5

John Morrison & Trish Stratus & Snooki Vs. Dolph Ziggler & LayCool - Trish competed in her first WrestleMania match in 5 years where her and Michelle McCool did all the work in this one where the others never recieved a tag except Snooki who executed 2 moves and got the win. This was certainly a waste for great talent in Dolph Ziggler and John Morrison. 1/5

WWE Champion The Miz Vs. John Cena - I guess referee Mike Chioda didn't hear the bell ring the first time so to my knowledge, this was the first time in any main event at WrestleMania an official ordered the match bell to be ring twice before the match started. That would only be the beginning of this lackluster main event. The crowd was completey dead for this one and rightfully so as neither superstar did anything worth noting to make people give a damn about this match. But I will give credit to the Miz as he was able to kick out of a huge Attitude Adjustment before the match spilled out into the crowd that caused the double countout finish. After the annoucement was made declaring Miz is still champion, Rock came out and restarted the match and making the stipulation for this match to be restarted with no disqualification and no countout. Cena then throws Miz back into the ring only to suffer the effects of a Rock Bottom from the Rock to give Miz the cheap pinfall win. After the match, Rock and Miz has a staredown which resulted in Rock coming back to the ring and delivering a People's Elbow to end this horrible night in sports entertainment. 2/5

Overall, WrestleMania 27 resulted in a 4 hour episode of RAW or SmackDown and will go down as one of the worst WrestleMania's ever. I'll tell you this now, don't bother with this one. Not even HHH and Taker is worth making this event watchable.",1301961600,7,7570,4.37455579246624

your typical 2 minute match that was a filler so big show and kane have a wrestlemania match how about big show vs kane vs diesel in a triple threat match instead 1  out of 10

match 4: randy orton vs cm punk
probaly the best match of the night go back and forth action and like the only match that had a storyline to it first time in wrestlemania history 7 out of 10

match 5: jerry lawyler vs micheal cole
pointless they were laying down most of the match and the revesal are u kidding me i wonder why they do story lines like that

match 6:undertaker vs triple h
second best match of the night good match but no history kind of boring because of that one of the best matches of the night because of the other matches and winners but one of the undertakers worst in wrestlemania history his match at wrestlemania 17 with triple h was alot better most of the match laying down doing nonthing and i notcie the crowd was silent the whole night almost i give it 6 out of 10

match 7: six man intergender match
kind of pointless 2 minutes long to get celebrities in a matc h and of course win 1 out of 10

match 8: miz vs john cena
this match should have not been the main event miz should be lucky to be at wrestlemania and on top he regains it it was pointless it should hae been the rock vs john cena but who knows that was the rivalry miz should have not even been wwe champion ever  i give this match a 0 out of 10

this wrestlemania was very disppointing oone of the worst of all time i give the whole event a 35 out of 100 there was 2 matches actually on a wrestlemania level who knows maybe the rock demanded all the attendtion to i felt like i was watching another eo\pisode of monday night raw not wrestlemnia",1301875200,,2316,4.057017543859649
4436153,3,B004NJC0DE,"The more and more I watch this newest edition of Wrestlemania, the more and more I dislike it.  Let us not allow that to fool us however; as a PPV..this is pretty good, but in comparing this to other Wrestlemanias, this time around fails miserably.  There are some strong moments, and several weak ones, so let's move on to a review of what's to be seen.

This year's Wrestlemania certainly does have that WM feel, but unfortunately the backstage segments (there are many) kind of suck.  So much so that without going back to look at the PPV, I don't remember any of them.

The DVD itself features a couple of dark matches, one of which was advertised to be on the actual PPV, but was bumped due to time restrictions.  Anyway, the Great Khali wins a pointless and run of the mill battle royal featuring all the superstars left off the card.  The other is the United States Title match between Sheamus and Daniel Bryan, which most definitely deserved some time during the show.

The show starts with a HORRIBLE promo from the rock that lasts a sluggush 15+ minutes.  It's the same old, dry, typical nonsense the Rock has done for years.  But it's Wrestlemania right?  The Rock is the host of the show, right? No.
It's a hideous waste of time, which I honestly couldn't wait for it to end.

The opening contest is Edge and Alberto Del Rio for the World Heavyweight Championship.  That's correct, I said OPENING contest.  While I have a lot of respect for Edge's abilities in the ring, he had already done enough to win over the fans.  The match is above average, but most definitely not up to Wrestlemania standards.  A swift ten minutes of decent action breezes by with Edge retaining, and then him and Christian destroy Del Rio's car at the head of the stage for another ten minutes.  Fun.

The next match is one of the best on the card as Cody Rhodes and Rey Meysterio treat us to a well though out and creative match.  It's probably longer than the opening match, so it seems like the creative staff gave this a little more of their attention.  Anyway, Rhodes picks up a fairly clean win after smashing Rey in the head with a knee brace.

Next up is the Corre vs. Kane, Big Show, Santino, and for some reason, Kofi Kingston.  Doesn't matter nonetheless as the match lasts just as long as it took me to write these two sentences.  If you do end up watching this match, look for Slater to do a brilliant job of selling Big Show's knockout punch, priceless.

Finally we get to an excellent match in the form of Orton vs. CM Punk.  If nothing else on the evening, WWE made a surprisingly good booking decision not to have the rest of the Nexus nobodies at ring side.  These two have a match together that is nothing less than spectacular.  Although this didn't reach its show stealing potential, it is easily one of the best matches of the night.

We then move on to the awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, annoying storyline between Jerry Lawler and Michael Cole.  I won't even bother to talk about this complete waste of 20 minutes.  I'll do this justice by just mentioning that Cole looks like a fool, and doesn't even get a stunner.  Did I mention Stone Cold was the special guest referee?  Who cares.  Do yourself a HUGE favor and skip this ridiculous heap.

On to what this Wrestlemania will be the most remembered for, the grudge match between the semi-retired Undertaker and Triple H.  I really cannot fathom why this match receives so much criticism from the older fans.  There is an incredible movie package in the beginning.  The contest turns out to be INCREDIBLE, with these two really showing how to put on a great Wrestlemania main event.  There were tons of near falls with a few exchanges of finishers and signature moves.  These two show some great in ring chemestry together.  The only disappointment is the DVD edits out both of the original entrances, which were expertly done.  A mastermind slugfest at its finest!

Another extremely low point on the night was the unspeakable mixed tag match between Laycool & Dolph Ziggler and John Morrison, Trish Stratus & SNOOKI.  The women's division in WWE is already at an all time low, and having that boozed up trash pin one of WWE's most worthy divas didn't do it any favors.  I can't say I was surprised however.

I was really hoping The Miz would finally prove me wrong and impress me in his WWE Title main event match against John Cena.  Well this turns out to be one of the worst WM main events in its history.  Cena uses his typical four moves and the Miz looks inexperienced.  Miz's entrance is also horrible and stupid.  The ending of this garbage also leaves you scratching your head as the Rock comes out and restarts and countout ending for the Miz to retain.  I honestly didn't care who would win this match, and I still didn't care after it was over.  Woopdy doo.

As other reviewers have suggested, this WM is kind of a dud.  There is so fun to be hand with the extras including the bonus matches and the Hall of Fame Ceremony.  There are a few good matches on the card, but also some bad ones leaving any informed viewers with a very bad taste.  This WM forces us to agree with stupid celebrity appearances and lame storylines to push the ratings.

It's a good one to add to your collection, but it is nowhere near a great Wrestlemania.",1301875200,,5313,4.488517745302714

April 3, 2011
Georgia Dome
Atlanta, Georgia

Before I get into my review of the matches, I want to tell everyone why I think this WrestleMania was a disappointment from where I sit. Its booking was Russo like. I expected WWE is pull out all the stops since this wasn't the strongest Mania card in a while. But they somehow didn't move forward in the booking. I will explain in more detail in my match reviews.

World Heavyweight Championship:
Edge (Champion) V. Alberto Del Rio
Why is this the opening match for the THIRD STRAIGHT PPV??!! They didn't have any other match they felt could have given the crown life except this match?? Why not put Orton/Punk here & have this match where Orton/Punk was? The World Heavyweight Championship Match should NEVER open a WrestleMania. Plus the Royal Rumble winner was in it, so at least put him a little higher on the card!! It makes it look like you have doubts for him to draw in the future. As far as the match goes...Better than what I thought it was going to be. It did get the crowd into so it did its job there. A couple of botches but thats ok. Edge retains. ***1/2

Cody Rhodes V. Rey Mysterio
I was expecting A LOT more from these two. The match was slow & didn't pick up the pace like a Mysterio match normally does. Rhodes didn't perform like I thought he would have. He was in there with Mysterio!! He can like a pig look good in the ring! Rhodes gets the win. **

Big Show, Kane, Kofi Kingston, & Santino Marella
V.
Wade Barrett, Ezekiel Jackson, Justin Gabriel, & Health Slater
Have you even seen an 8-Man Tag match without ANY tags? This was the first. The match was changed the day before the event to have a better match by taking Vladimir Kozlov out and putting Kofi in. So lets give them...2 MINUTES!! Yes, this match was 2 minutes long. Big Shows team wins. That doesnt even make seem right. Why would the faces win?? The pretty much beat the crap out of the core for the final 2 weeks of build-up & 3 out of the 4 core members have championships!! Way to protect your champions!! This match was a DUD!!!

CM Punk V. Randy Orton
One of the few bright spots on the card. How good of a heel is CM Punk??...Just amazing is the answer!! Great ring psychology with the work on Orton's knee. Orton selling the knee injury to perfection. A predictable set up spot for the RKO at the end but its all good. Orton wins. ***1/2

Jerry Lawler V. Michael Cole
If you were thinking that this match was going to be good going into the event...you are dumber than Paris Hilton. For months Cole has been pretty nasty to Lawler & even cost him the WWE Championship. So simple logical calls for Lawler to get revenge & win the match. Cant really screw up the booking on this one right?? So lets see how they managed to screw it up. The match went too long for what it was. You give this match 10-15 minutes and an 8-Man Tag 2 minutes!! Cole was in control for WAY too long. Lawler finally gets the upper hand & wins the match. He celebrates with Stone Cold for like 5 minutes (really...do you need to give them more time??) Then the Raw GM says that Cole wins by DQ because Austin did something. Umm...what?? (no pun intended) So Lawler doesnt get the win in his most likely only WrestleMania match. How is this closure on a SIX MONTH long feud? You have feuds that long to match go to Mania for the good guy to prevail in the end. Horrible...oh...DUD

No Holds Barred Match:
The Undertaker V. Triple H
This was the match that everyone was talking about going into Wrestlemania. So everyone was thinking this match was going to be the best on the card. It was the best match on the card. But it also was the most disappointing match on the card. This match was hyped too much for me. I was thinking that this match had to be something special. They start brawling on the outside for like 5 minutes, then they start hitting their finishers?? This match had way too much OVERSELLING. After every move..im serious...EVERY MOVE...they would sell for like 2 or 3 minutes. Triple H dominated most of the match. He hits 3 Pedigrees & taker kicks out. Hits him with tons of chair shots & taker kicks out. Hits him with Takers own Tombstone & taker kicks out. Then somehow taker locks in Hells Gate. Triple H tries to fight out of it. He even had takers shoulders to the mat for like 3 minutes & the ref didn't even go for the pin once. Triple H passes out, wakes up just in time to tap & passes out again. Then Taker oversells for like an extra 10 minutes! Taker, the man who won the match is selling stuff that happened to him like 10 minutes earier while Triple H wokes up for his coma again about 2 minutes after the match. They could have booked this match A LOT BETTER. I understand that Taker was selling so that the fan can see that Triple H was the better man but didn't win. The problem is that nothing really happened in this match that Taker didn't already go though in any other match. So overselling doesnt work here. ***3/4 match but not what I was looking for.

John Morrison, Trish Stratus, & Snookie
V.
Dolph Ziggler & LayCool
Wasnt expecting a long or good match here & that is what I got. Snookie does a pretty impressive handspring elbow & Morrison hits Starship Pain on Ziggler who was on the floor & thats about its. Morrison, Stratus, & Snookie win. *1/2

WWE Championship:
The Miz (Champion) V. John Cena
I wasn't expecting too much from this match. It was better than I thought but not enough for me to says ""oh my god"". It was decent. The only real problem I have with it is the ending. Miz & Cena get double counted out. The match is a draw. The Rock comes down & restarts the match with no dq & no countout because he is the host and he can do that. Rock hits Cena with Rock Bottom, the Miz covers, & retains. **1/2 Then the Rock beats up the Miz. My problem is that why did they have the book the double countout? Why not just have the Rock come down & hit Cena with the Rock Bottom? Plus, the Miz just retains the WWE Championship at WrestleMania. Cant he celebrate it? Why book it so the Rock beats him up? Again, its a protect your champion thing.

Overall the booking is in serious question. Plus the Rock opens the show and cuts a promo for 15 minutes & you dump The United States Championship off the card so the Rock can talk?? He pretty much said the same thing he has been saying for the last month. I was very disappointed in this years WrestleMania. Hopefully they learn from their mistakes this year & WrestleMania XXVII in Miami will be a lot better!!",1301875200,2,6548,4.2990275526742305

Miz vs Cena is a disgrace. Cena should have won as Miz being a WWE Champion is a joke and a half. Miz is not championship material. I like Miz in the midcard but it was a sorry main event. Orton and Punk delivered a match of the year quality match just like Taker and Triple H did. Edge vs Del Rio was not too bad. I don't like Del Rio but Edge always delivers a good match. very bad Wrestlemania I don't recommend.,1460678400,,590,4.008474576271187
