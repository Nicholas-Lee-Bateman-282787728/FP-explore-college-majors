8066937,1,B0009UZGFA,Awful opaque French film. It will leave you dazed and confused. Even the French didn't like it.,1376006400,,95,4.647058823529412
8066938,1,B0009UZGFA,"If you want to become crazy, this may be your film. If you want to see how bad modern French cinema has become, this is definitely your thing. Agnes Jaoui's films look natural in comparison :). Also if you want to make sure how good actors make bad films everywhere, not only in Hollywood.

I agree with IMDb's ""eyal philippsborn"" that ""less is more"" with respect to ""the abundance of sub-plots, characters and endless slightly hallucinatory dialogue"". I don't think that the time in which one watches it makes a different, this flick is too bad to be influenced by such subtle tings :). Dialogues here are not just ""lengthy"", they're just unbelievable, theatrical in the bad sense, and utterly nonsensical. I watch French films almost daily, so I think I know the slow tempos and unusual everything of European movies! It's been a long time since I have watched a film that is SO bad. Amazon's ""Shayad"" is right that ""it is made for small screen viewing"".

There is no plot. It looks like the notes Charlotte jots while the world goes on around her. If you are about or just moving, this film is interesting, in the sense it shows how stressing it can become, ""what it could do to you"" :). But if people would be half as authentic as in this film, every meeting would be so interesting... All potential buyers speak their mind out like if they were in the middle of a session with their long term therapist. They speak about their inner fears with a total stranger, just the contrary of what real Parisians do. Just a few examples: the mother speaks a lot about ""chicken"", both of them use a vacuum cleaner that only emits smoke, Charlotte is obsessed with ""double curtains"", (among other things), new apartments reek, small suitcases are very important, and the list could go on. Their experience at the land and reflections about farm animals was just too much. Basically everything is crazy in a way that's not even funny. Their speaking about the Holocaust wasn't that light in my opinion. But I don't see how it would matter so much for a ""third generation"" as they call young people here.

Sylvie Testud is a superb actress, it shows with a script that would sink even the best of actors.

Avoid it, or watch it with company while eating a good chicken :). I don't ever want to move in my life :)!",1262995200,,2304,4.544578313253012
8066939,5,B0009UZGFA,"This movie is for anyone who is sensitive to smell, touch, language, or who wants to be.  Typically French in all the right ways, this comedic melodrama is so much more than plot.  In fact, it's about sensitivities.  It's about intersections, collisions of time and place and perceptions, observations.  It's about mothers and daughters and grandmothers, and it's about all the other mothers that come into our lives, sometimes only to leave again.  And of course, it's about love.  What French film isn't?

Too many mattresses, tables and chairs; music and sleep mingled with the lack of them both; a smoking oven; empty and almost empty refrigerators; pregnancies feared and longed for; an old diary, a writer's notebook, eavesdropping; flowers in vases and so many repeated phrases.  Whimsical and terribly serious, this film unreels like a classic.  I watch it again and again and always take something new away from it.

This is where I fell in love with Sylvie Testud... as Charlotte.  Charlotte chain smokes and takes a cerebral and celibate approach to her work writing erotic stories.  Charlotte listens to her mother.  She makes no apologies for her domestic inadequacies, even as her house fills with strangers over and over again.  She turns each interaction into something larger, more relevant to the story she seeks as life's chaos adds its spice... like thyme on roasted chicken.",1247011200,4,1395,5.06140350877193
8066940,3,B0009UZGFA,"The French do have a knack for being able to make movies around seemingly trivial and day-to-day topics. This movie's storyline spins around a daughter (Sylvie Testud) and her mother's constant movement from one house to another. They are in a constant and unending cycle of selling their house & entertaining potential buyers. Their interaction with potential buyers is interesting (though not the highlight of the movie). The movie chugs along at its own pace letting the viewer soak in the slow story.
At times, the movie gets boring and at other times it induces creative thoughts and at times reflection. I wonder how this movie might feel on a big screen. In my opinion, this movie is made for small screen viewing (lazy Saturday afternoon fare). You can excuse yourself numerous times for tea, coffee or beer and still catch the storyline as if it were a slowly moving train.",1219276800,,882,4.847682119205298
