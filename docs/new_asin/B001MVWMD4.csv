3701327,5,B001MVWMD4,"Return of the Man from the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement brings back Napoleon Solo, played by Robert Vaughn and Illya Kuryakin by David McCallum, to provide sheer pleasure to those who grew up watching the 1964 TV series.

UNCLE is a secret organization inspired by the political turmoil of the Cold War, a time when espionage was center stage as the world's great powers confronted each other. The Man from UNCLE was created by Metro-Goldwyn Mayer with the assistance and input of the creator of James Bond, Ian Fleming. This TV series was groundbreaking, sharing a world of secret agents working on behalf of powerful nations in search for defense, control and or information.

The Man From U.N.C.L.E. uncovered how the game was played, the gadgets invented to cover up how spies worked and the competitive world where they evolve, for as one uses a gadget, the enemy counteracts with newer technology in search for advantage. These men work for UNCLE as they search to protect nations from danger, especially from an organization that wants to conquer the world, known as THRUSH or ""Technology Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity.""

Those who belong to THRUSH want a world composed of masters and slaves and nations unite to fight against them, forming the operation called UNCLE.

With the Return of the Man from UNCLE, the team is back and the chemistry still there. We missed Alexander Waverly, played by Leo G. Carroll, but the replacement character, Sir John Raleigh is excellently played by Patrick Macnee, our Avenger's hero. Now the main characters are brought back from retirement, Solo as a computer sales person and Kuryakin dedicating his life to the design of highly priced garments.

At some point during the plot, Agent 007 has a cameo appearance as George Lazenby drives one of the Bond cars in the aid of the Men from UNCLE.

If you appreciated the series, don't miss this final adventure, a great experience!",1238457600,2,1984,4.925149700598802
3701328,2,B001MVWMD4,"One thing I've learned over the years is that if you didn't think much of a film when you saw it 20 years ago or so, you're still not going to think much of it years later.  This film proved that again for me.
U.N.C.L.E. was my all-time favorite tv show, I absolutely loved it from the night it premiered on NBC (and loving it wasn't always that easy considering its disasterous 3rd ""Camp"" season.)  I was very excited about this film and couldn't wait to watch its initial airing on CBS.  What a total mediocrity it turned out to be.  Vaughn and especially McCallum are quite good.  Parick MacNee was an inspired choice to play the new head of U.N.C.L.E.  However he is given little to do.  Some of the other performances are not so good however.  Anthony Zerbe is his usual professional self as the head of THRUSH.  Tom Mason is a total embarassment as a new moronic U.N.C.L.E. agent named Kowalski.  The biggest embarassment however is George Lazenby driving around Las Vegas is a second-hand looking Aston Martin, with the license plates J.B., just in time to help Solo in a very unexciting car chase. I find this scene very sad considering Lazenby's great Bond film ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service.""  The action scenes are pathetic attempts to rip off Bond films.  The conclusion with totally exposed U.N.C.L.E.  agents in motorboats taking on an army of concealed and highly armed THRUSH agents and easily defeating them is ludicrous.
I once read a long article on the making of this film.  Apparently there was a young writer, (whose name escapes me,) whose dream is was to bring U.N.C.L.E.  to the big screen along the lines of the first few Star Trek films.  He got a script together and even got Vaughn and McCallum to agree to the project.  He was very close to purchasing the rights to make the film when another producer swooped in and bought the rights instead.  Thus instead of a major film, we got this mediocre made-for-tv job.  This film was basically a pilot of a possible U.N.C.L.E. return.  It came in about number 20 in the ratings and CBS passed on a return to U.N.C.L.E.  It is interesting to ponder a big series of major U.N.C.L.E. films along the lines of the Bond and Trek films.  Instead we got this mess, too bad.
I wouldn't buy it unless you can get it very cheaply, buy the original series instead.",1237680000,20,2330,4.550480769230769
3701329,4,B001MVWMD4,"The last time ""Return Of The Man From U.N.C.L.E."" was released on DVD, the company that released it did a lousy job with two five second lapses in audio (and it was supposed to be digitally remastered) and disgusting trailers for other movies released by that company. In fact, the DVD release was so bad that I panned it here at Amazon.com and vowed not to buy it until somebody did it properly. Well, CBS Home Video has released ""Return"" properly and I'm glad to have it in my DVD collection. I only wish that they had put in better extras because it would have been nice to have the surviving actors who appeared in ""Return"" talk about the movie and what they thought of it. However, you can't always get what you want, especially when the DVD cost fourteen dollars, so I'm glad that I can see the movie properly for the first time in a long time.",1236211200,6,850,4.352201257861635
3701330,4,B001MVWMD4,"The most surprising omission in the recent ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Complete Series"" collection was the 1983 reunion movie (I assume because the rights were owned by a different studio), so the newly-released ""The Return of Man from U.N.C.L.E."" is a 'must' for all us fans of Solo, Illya, and the immortal spy network, to truly complete our collections...and be aware, if you are purchasing this as a 'stand alone' tape, there are no 'Special Features'; if you want to hear Vaughn and McCallum's observations about the reunion, you'll find them in the ""Complete Series"" collection!

""Return of The Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Fifteen Years Later Affair"" (the original title) doesn't compare with the best episodes of Seasons 1 and 2 (writer/producer Michael Sloan reportedly used episodes from Season 3...the worst year for the series...for his research), and some of his wry 'twists' don't make much sense (aloof, shy Kuryakin retired to become a women's fashion designer? Skirt-chasing, yet dedicated Solo now peddling computers and losing in Vegas?), but there are nice touches, as well; Patrick Macnee, 'John Steed' in the classic ""Avengers"", makes a perfect successor to the late Leo G. Carroll, as head of U.N.C.L.E. (there are some very welcome references to the beloved older actor); villain Anthony Zerbe puts a nice spin on how both THRUSH and U.N.C.L.E. aren't as much fun, anymore, in the new world order; and Vaughn and particularly McCallum, look remarkably unchanged after 14 years (""good makeup man"", Solo quips).

While some 'surprises' seem out-of-place (George Lazenby, spoofing his one 007 film, here playing 'J.B.', and rescuing Solo), and a dumb decision to split up Solo and Kuryakin, teaming them with different people, is an obvious mistake, there is still magic in the franchise, Vaughn and McCallum are obviously enjoying themselves, and ""The Return of Man from U.N.C.L.E."" offers ample opportunity for fans to relive that crazy era when U.N.C.L.E. saved the world, each week!",1235347200,13,2005,5.204334365325077
3701331,4,B001MVWMD4,"A project that took time  to get off the ground but in 1983 U.N.C.L.E. fans were treated to the return of Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin one last time.  Both agents had left U.N.C.L.E. to pursue other careers -- Solo as a computer salesman and Kuryakin as a fashion designer.  Mr. Waverly had passed away and the organization is now being run by Sir John Raleigh (Patrick MacNee of the AVENGERS).  A nuclear crisis brings the two back into the fold. Some witty dialogue:
Illya: They're all men! What happened to all the beautiful girls that worked for U.N.C.L.E?
Solo: They're in the U.N.C.L.E. home.
Look for George Lazenby in a cameo as ""JB"".  Directed by Ray Austin, better remembered for his work on THE AVENGERS.  Cast includes Geoffrey Lewis (EVERY WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE, ANY WHICH WAY YOU CAN) as Janus, Anthony Zerbe as Justin Sepharim (the head of THRUSH) and Tom Mason as the new generation U.N.C.L.E. agent.  The old-time chemistry between Vaughn and McCallum is still there 15 years after the series ended.  Unfortunately, after being brought together again the two are sent off on separate directions.  Still, as Robert Vaughn said at the time, the minute he put on the tuxedo it felt like 1966 all over again. A new U.N.C.L.E. logo appears. THE RETURN OF THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E.: THE FIFTEEN YEARS LATER AFFAIR.  A long wait but ultimately worth it. A nice transfer this time.

I have a decades-old VHS copy, but now that I've got and am watching the MFU series, I wanted that movie in good shape on disk.

One review called this one of Amazon's on-deman DVD-R disks; all I can say is, not that I could tell (and I've been making disks for years now). This had menus, extras, absolutely gorgeous picture, and the disk was the color of a standard release.

And as my introduction to The Men, I still loved it. Even my kids loved it, and just wanted to know why things were different for the TV series (""because the world was black and white back then. It didn't turn color until the mid-70s"").

Still enjoyed the old spoof type film",1429747200,,149,4.0
3701379,3,B001MVWMD4,"I can't recommend this made-for-TV movie unless you're an U.N.C.L.E. completist and have a compelling need to round out your collection.

It's slow to get going, taking about half of its run time to find its footing. There are plot holes big enough to sail the Queen Mary through. The actors' performances range from competent to crappy, with those of Robert Vaughn and David McCallum falling in the middle of the pack. Patrick MacNee, who portrays the late Alexander Waverly's replacement, doesn't have much to do. The appearance of George Lazenby (who, in my opinion, was not a bad James Bond), while an interesting little twist, ultimately is an inside joke that serves no purpose. The Russian woman is annoying and simply laughable, and not in a good way.

The charm, clever writing, exotic ""locations"" and wry humor that characterized the original TV series is nowhere to be seen. I mean, come on---would any viewer really buy into the ""Libyan"" locations that feature, big as life, the Hoover Dam? Give me a break. If you're making a movie and can't come up with the right locations, then re-write the script; don't insult the viewer's intelligence by trying to pass off a quintessential American icon as a location in North Africa.

All in all, this movie may have resonated with U.N.C.L.E. fans when it first came out. But it has aged poorly (as has most made-for-TV fare from the period), and offers little reason to own. If you want to watch it, my recommendation is to check it out of the library.",1427155200,,1507,4.766283524904215

This movie on the other hand is a fun settle back and enjoy film. The leads are still worth seeing and the story typical of an UNCLE episode. The fans will always have a gripe and say it reminds them of the terrible third season. That being said I have to say I watch the third season and remembering the big splash Batman the tv series made then, and how much it influenced all shows on at that time it doesn't bother me. UNCLE it self was a fad show brought on by the BOND movies. After this show hit the air it was a huge success and UNCLE was the new rage for the next couple of years. Other shows of the time traded in their cop personas and became spies such as Burkes Law became Amos Burke Spy.
The movie is fun and if you want a taste of what UNCLE was like sit down and turn it on . I enjoy it and think it is a fun film no more no less.",1380240000,2,1131,3.8170212765957445
3701402,2,B001MVWMD4,"WARNING !!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!! IF you've not seen this and wish to first don't read this review !!!!

In the 1970s the late U.N.C.L.E. fan and writer David McDaniel got the producer of U.N.C.L.E., Norman Felton to appoint me the head of the Las Vegas Satrap of T.H.R.U.S.H.

So I tell people that when things happen in Vegas, it's all T.H.R.U.S.H.'s fault !

Thus my interest in anything having to do with U.N.C.L.E.'s paid assassins.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are so many things that can be written about this telefilm that one hardly knows where to begin.

But first, I must bring up the point that for any director or producer to do this show justice that producer MUST have a good idea of what the show was about, what the tone of the show was and not IGNORE the structures set up by the creators as this producer chose to do and as we have seen with Star Trek by JJ Abrams and others fails miserably as an U.N.C.L.E. made for tv movie.

Which is NOT to say that there weren't some enjoyable parts in the film, but Michael Sloan wrote and produced this and it shows.

Robert Vaughn and David McCallum reprise their roles as Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin but even they are treated badly by a bad script. And the worst acting job of all is by Gayle Hunnicutt who plays a Russian ballerina who has an atrocious Russian accent and whose role could easily have been left out of the entire fillm. I would suppose its a nod to the original premise of U.N.C.L.E. which had agents get involved with ordinary people but it doesn't work ... except for the appearance of George Lazenby as "" JB "" ( as if we didn't KNOW who JB was supposed to be ). It's fun to see him driving a gadget laden copy of 007's Astin Martin as he helps Napoleon Solo get out of a jam.

But I digress.

Some years back Robert Short, major U.N.C.L.E. collector and fan was working on his own movie to bring back the boys and his effort would have been far superior to this on.

Things that are puzzling about this film.

Sloan didn't like the T.H.R.U.S.H. logo and used an orange lightning bolt for a symbol and orange jumpsuits which makes all the T.H.R.U.S.H. look like county jail inmates.

Short being the technical advisor to the effort snuck in a T.H.R.U.S.H fighting bird in one scene and its far better looking than the stupid lightning logo.

The bomber crew carrying the H957 say they're over the desert yet the plane crashes 20 miles south of Anchorage, Alaska ?

Why was Keenan Wynn in this film other than the fact that he was a friend of someone ? His role could have been easily left out.

No one seems to realize that U.N.C.L.E. id badges aren't supposed to be used except INSIDE an U.N.C.L.E. Hq facility yet agents wear them everywhere.

These flaws have been pointed out by others along with the very tired plot line of stealing a nuclear device and holding a country up for ransom by threatenign to detonate it.

It's clear that the producer didn't have a clue or give a damn about what the show meant to the fans and like so many producers and directors ( see 2 bad Lone Ranger films ) wants to make his mark on the product.

It's fun to see Solo try to get into the hq entrance in Del Floria's tailor shop, see the communicator pen again and sadly only a brief reference to the third Man From U.N.C.L.E., Leo G. Carroll, who has been neglected for his contributions to the original program.

If you long to see Napoleon and Illya in action again, then get this. But watch it for what it alludes to and not for what it really is.

But we'll probably never see an U.N.C.L.E. film produced as the project has been kicking around Hollywood for some 20 years and unless someone who loves/loved the show produces it, we'll probably see a badly done film again, like The Dukes of Hazzard, The A Team, The Beverly Hillbillies and more.

Just because you want to do a remake of a popular show, doesn't mean you can.

Neither did this one.

I just watched it again on DVD after not seeing it for 9 years and it was fun to watch and the boys made me smile.

But ... it ain't and wasn't the U.N.C.L.E. film it should have been.

Some producer NEEDS to get together with Bob Short and make an U.N.C.L.E. movie that will live up to the legacy created by Felton and Sam Rolfe.

And for your information, Ian Flemings only major contribution to U.N.C.L.E. was that he came up with the name Napoleon Solo. He had no major contribution to the creation of the program, in great part because the Bond producers were threatening to sue him and the U.N.C.L.E. producers if he did not drop his association with the project. He did so because he didn't want to lose the money he was getting from the movies.

I could go on and if you ever want to talk about it send me an email at Falkie2013@gmail.com or look at my blog From Forbes Field To The Bay and Back Again.

I was all excited when I saw a single title of U.N.C.L.E. available VS. the much more expensive Entire Series which I believe is reduced to $149. That is until I watched it. I purchased this because I have been buying a lot of Classics TV Series like Jack Lord's Hawaii Five-0, Magnum PI, Daniel Boone, etc. and have really enjoyed them. In addition, I remember vaguely that I had watched this film when it premiered on CBS in the early 80's. I was extremely disappointed in this film mainly because of a poor script and a segment where Solo and a girl are being chased by Thrush agents and they are assisted by George Lazenby.  This segment was really corny and Solo's girl is awestruck by a license plate that says: JB for James Bond. Lazenby, as many of you know, played the worst James Bond. That is if you painfully remember his role in the worst written Bond Film ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The only attractive part of that movie was Diana Rig. Now if in Fifteen Years Later Affair they had Sean Connery show up with his dry sense of humor with a re-write it would have enhanced the film Vs. Lazenby making it a real stinker in my opinion. I wish that Amazon and CBS would sell The U.C.L.E. Series by individual seasons so that we can read reviews of the seasons and purchase accordingly. I realize that my tastes have changed since the early 80's but The Fifteen Years Latter Affair was watched once and I sold it back to Amazon for $5.25. For those that want a single copy only for nostalgia you really need to want it badly to own this film.
Hope this helps.

the plot is simple formula. An old enemy(Anthony Zerbe) escapes from prison requested Napoleon Solo to deliver the ransom. It is a cute reunion movie beinging back our ..and that is all you need to think of it as. It is  a get together of our two spy leads and a nice way to bring them back together.

Patrick Mcnee (John Steed from the Avengers) play the new head of UNCLE. Calling his Sir John is a humorous nod to the Avengers and the spy genre.

And to further make a cuter touch....There is a cameo by George Lazenby (On Her Majesty's Secret Service) as JB, who drives an Aston MartinDB5 and a hint of the Bond theme in the background music. It is too much for cuteness,  but it is a tip of the hat to Ian Fleming who help create Solo (UNCLE Pilot) for TV.
