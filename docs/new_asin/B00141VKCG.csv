8254050,1,B00141VKCG,"THIS BOX SET OF SAM ELLIOTT WAS MOST DISAPOINTING BY THE COVOR AND THE STAR WE WESTERN FANS LOVE YOU THINK THE TWO FEATURES WERE WESTERN NOT AT ALL THE FIRST ONE ""BLUE RIVER"" IS  A STORY OF TODAY AND IT IS ONE POOR STORY WHICH WILL I WILL NEVER WATCH AGAIN, THE SECOND ""THE RANGER THE COOK AND THE SKY"" IS OF SAM AS A FORREST RANGE AND IS ONE WEAK FILM TO BE KIND. PURCHASED THE TWO THINKING THEY WERE WESTERNS WHICH SAM DOES SO WELL, A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.",1217376000,18,461,3.904255319148936
