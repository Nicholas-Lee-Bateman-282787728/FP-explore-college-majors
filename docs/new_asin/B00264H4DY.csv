3850899,5,B00264H4DY,Great show with some great humor. Adults will enjoy this show as much as their children. It's one f the best chow out there for kids these days. I would recomend it to anyone.,1374364800,,175,4.176470588235294
3850900,5,B00264H4DY,"This to me is Fairly Odd Parents in its prime.  From 'Christmas Everyday' to 'Scary God Parents', it is a complete masterpiece all the way through.  Now those of you who were disappointed that 'Christmas Everyday' wasn't on the 1st season package, this one has it don't you worry.  As for me, I'm perfectly satisfied with both dvd sets and looking forward to getting the 3rd season someday.  Fairly Odd Parents proved it could do anything in the 1st season, and showed us that it can do that much more with season 2.  Ladies and gentlemen, people of all ages, prepare yourselves to watch this amazing show on... season 2.  You may ask why I consider this the Fairly Odd Parents in its prime.  It takes most of everything that we loved about season 1, but it almost enchants them in a lot of ways.  The animation and color seems more vibrant in season 2 and the humor is totally off the wall.  George Washington was hilarious on that episode 'Twistory'.  I couldn't stop laughing when he said ""Must... chop... wood!""  That's classic.  Bottom line, if you are a fan of Fairly Odd Parents, I recommend season 1 and 2 for sure.  You won't regret it. ;)",1349654400,,1148,4.48792270531401
3850901,4,B00264H4DY,"this one is good, at first it seemed like there might be aproblem,a couple small scratches,but so far it has played good,fingers crossed. i don't want to have to exchange this one as well,i hope not. but, if it starts to freeze up,etc.. i will have no choice but to return for another,thank you.",1285286400,,295,4.481481481481482
3850902,5,B00264H4DY,"I haven't enjoyed an animated series as much as Fairly Oddparents since the Simpsons. The animation and characters are well defined with snappy and intelligent dialogue and just enough corn which reminds me of the old Chuck Jones Bugs Bunny cartoons. Kids see and laugh at the actions, (well I do too) but the writing is well done and the comebacks and remarks are witty. Love it! My favorite guilty pleasure right up there with Courage The Cowardly Dog.",1258848000,,454,4.7594936708860756
3850903,5,B00264H4DY,"FOP season 1, the strengths of this DVD set are the fact that the sound and picture quality are very high, and the episodes are in production order.  Unfortunately like the previous release, this does not have any special features.  However, it does have two episodes that are not shown any more of The Fairly OddParents; Hail to the Chief and Twistory on Disc 3.  There is, also, the Fool's Day Out and Deja Vu, both which are usually shown on April 1st.  The Christmas Everyday, Information Stupor Highway, and Scary Godparents special episodes are, also, on this DVD.  These factors are what have contributed to me giving this particular set of DVD's a much higher rating.  It is worth buying if you want to have all of the episodes of Season 2.  All in all a very good DVD.",1254268800,2,777,4.507142857142857
3850904,1,B00264H4DY,thanks for the bootleg copy. you might have put it in the description that it was on a dvd-r. if i wanted bootleg garbage i would have downloaded it.,1253664000,,149,4.172413793103448
3850905,4,B00264H4DY,"I ordered this set a while back and was happy with the release.  It has all season 2 episodes in production order.  There are no bonus features, but everything in this release is consistent to the ""The Fairly OddParents: Season 1"" and ""The Fairly OddParents: Season 6, Volume 1"" sets.

There are two problems that really bug me bug probably won't bug anyone else:
1. The case is actually black instead of the cool clear one on Season 6, Volume 1. It's OK, but a clear one would look waay better.
2. When you select one episode, it will play it, but once it's over will go right into the next one like selecting a chapter in a movie. This really annoys me.
3. There is no insert with episode descriptions, which was always a nice touch.

Again, these annoy me, but probably not you. =)

3850906,3,B00264H4DY,"This DVD is way overpriced considering the fact that it only contains 12 episodes.  Also, someone is recording the episodes off of the tv using on demand equipment, so I think charging so much money is a huge scam.  I love the Fairly Oddparents, and was very excited to see that seasons of them are finally being released.  But this is clearly a scam since the DVD of season 6 has the fairly oddbaby movie along with a bunch of other episodes and is way cheaper.",1244505600,2,462,4.348837209302325

8351845,5,B00264H4DY,"My kids really enjoy this show. You used to be able to stream them and then some of the sites removed them or you had to pay to see an episode. Well, we were pretty disappointed about that. I guess it has something to do with contracts between the companies and this is just an unfortunate side effect for those of us that liked watching the series.

This is one of the few kid friendly shows I enjoy watching and don't mind watching multiple times . It's nice to have the complete series. This is a 3 disc series with 26 episodes. Christmas Every Day, Highway, and Scary Godparents are all double length episodes. You get plenty of content to watch. I would recommend this, especially if you enjoy the series.",1480118400,,710,4.419847328244275
