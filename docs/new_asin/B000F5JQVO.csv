2552721,4,B000F5JQVO,"1968's PRETTY POISON starring Anthony ""Psycho"" Perkins and former teen tease Tuesday Weld is a much-wanted cult fave not on DVD in Region 1 (USA).  With no fanfare, it's now available as a Region 1 but without director Noel Black's better than average commentary on the Region 2 import (Amazon UK).

Adapted by Lorenzo Semple, Jr., from Stephen Geller's twisted love story ""She Let Him Continue,"" opens with Perkins' Dennis Pitt being released from a psychiatric institution or prison for committing arson. The probation officer warns: ""You're going into a real, tough world. It's no place for fantasies."" First thing Dennis sees when he settles in a small town is seductive, pouty Sue Ann Stepanek (Weld), a girl with serious attitude problems, in her majorette outfit. Uh oh.

This deliciously demented black comedy focuses on what happens when two pathologies collide. It's a forerunner to movies like Bonnie and Clyde, Badlands and Blue Velvet.

Perkins and Weld have great chemistry as the two dodgy lovebirds. She merrily lets him pretend he's a CIA agent but deviously manipulates his fantasies to her own ends.

Beverly Garland is Weld's sexually charged, domineering mom. But it's Perkins and Weld at their best that make this rare gem from the 60s worth finding. I liked director Noel Black's forthright commentary on the Region 2 version (Amazon UK).  Wonder why it's missing on the US version?

Tuesday Weld smokes in this, playing a young girl whose initial, apparent innocence proves too much for Anthony Perkins who is perfect as a troubled young man who is caught in his own fantasy-world.

2552729,5,B000F5JQVO,"""Pretty poison"" was remade in 1996. It wasn't all that bad, and if it had been the only version that existed it would have been an enjoyable little film with a clever plot. However, another version does exist: this one, and it blows the remake away. It features two stars born to play the parts - Tuesday Weld and Anthony Perkins. They were older than the characters they played, but brought a quality to their roles, baggage really, that the remake couldn't hope to match.

Anthony Perkins plays Dennis Pitt who leaves the mental institution where he has been confined for some time. Dennis has had problems caused by an overactive imagination and trouble separating fact from fantasy.

He moves to a small town where a job has been arranged for him at a chemical plant. When he becomes infatuated with a seventeen year-old high school student, Sue Ann Stepanek (Tuesday Weld), he involves her in a plan to sabotage the plant because it is polluting the waterways. However events overwhelm him, and Sue Ann shows that she is a strong and ruthless character with none of Dennis' illusions about life. In fact, she has a scheme of her own and matricide in mind.

The end of the movie sees Dennis back in jail where he is visited by Mr Azenauer his parole officer, who realises he is not guilty. He asks Dennis why he does not protest his innocence. Dennis replies with a classic line: ""I've learned that people only pay attention to what they discover for themselves"". ""Pretty Poison"" is full of offbeat wisdom such as this.

At first glance, Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld's roles seem to be the stereotypes from which both actors were trying to free themselves. In Perkins case it was from the neurotic, arrested personality he had made his own in ""Psycho"". Tuesday Weld brought with her memories of Thalia Menninger the gap-toothed nymphet from ""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis"". Both their parts in ""Pretty Poison"" were beautifully realised variations of those characters - but with a twist. Perkins invested Dennis Pitt with a vulnerability and sensitivity that ends up making him the most worthwhile character in the movie.

""Pretty Poison"" has a lightness of touch. Its power comes from a witty script, assured but understated direction, and the remarkable performances of the two leads. Johnny Mandel with his trademark flutes over lush strings provided the score for the film, and although it works effectively enough, it is one of the few elements, other than surface superficialities, which date it to the period when it was made. And that's the thing about ""Pretty Poison""; it still seems amazingly fresh even after nearly fifty years.

Now that ""Pretty Poison"" is on DVD, it is bound to surprise and reward a whole new audience that, in the words of Dennis Pitt, will discover it for themselves.",1412812800,7,2808,4.8153526970954355

2552736,4,B000F5JQVO,"I bought Pretty Poison from a local Dollar General as a blind buy. It didn't cost much so I figured I had little to lose.

Pretty Poison stars Psycho star Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld as his seemingly sweet and innocent love interest. Anthony Perkins plays a young man who can't help but exaggerate and lie. Not out facetious spite, but fantasy-living. Upon meeting Tuesday Weld's character, he develops an elaborate world of being a CIA agent on a secret mission in which he convinces Weld's character to become involved in.

Unfortunately, one thing leads to another and things Perkins' character never intended begin happening as a security guard he once worked with is murdered and it snowballs from there.

I enjoyed the movie but I wouldn't say I'm crazy about it. It's enjoyable enough that it definitely warrants at least one viewing. However, if you buy the movie, be careful about reading the back cover. As I watched the movie, I began reading it again....and pretty much immediately knew exactly how it would end. I guessed...and I was right. It ended exactly as I had imagined.

Bottom line, if your an Anthony Perkins fan, check it out at least once.",1366848000,,1168,4.796019900497512

2552738,5,B000F5JQVO,"A long time favorite ""little"" movie, I first caught this on late night TV back in 1974. The DVD plays well and is recommended. Fox-TV did a remake of this movie in September 1996. It features Grant Show and Wendy Benson (in the Tony Perkins and Tuesday Weld roles) and is really quite good, possibly even better than the original. Still no home video of it though. I have it on tape taken from the original TV broadcast, but it`s chock full of commercials.  The role of the girl`s mother played by Beverly Garland in the original is played by Michelle Phillips (of the Mamas and Papas). Fox : Please release ! It would be fun for people to compare the two (like the two versions of Brian`s Song).",1352246400,,696,4.395348837209302
2552739,4,B000F5JQVO,"One if my favorites. The dvd includes a tiny bit of footage not shown on TV. If you like films like Gun Crazy and Badlands, you will probably enjoy Pretty Poison. Perkins and Weld are great!",1342310400,,190,4.305555555555555
2552740,4,B000F5JQVO,"Poor Anthony Perkins.  He had such talent and yet that talent led him to be completely undervalued.  After nailing the repressive insanity of Norman Bates, he moved into a similarly disturbed Dennis Pitt and sealed the fate of his career.  Being typecast, he never progressed in his career, despite showing range in smaller films like `Goodbye Again'.  In `Pretty Poison', Perkins makes an even more distinctive switch between personas as the film progresses and his character becomes out-crazed.

`Pretty Poison' is a delicious treat.

I mainly expected this to be semi-campy fun, and after the first few scenes I thought that is what I was getting.  The morose music swelled in ways that painted an obvious picture, and the dialog falling from Perkin's lips was hilariously insane that I really was expecting this to be one of those cult favorites that holds up on camp value only.  But then, about mid-way through, things start to shift and you start to realize that what you saw as camp wasn't really camp at all.  As Dennis and Sue Ann develop their relationship, it becomes apparent who the crazy person really is and how far that person is willing to go to get what they think they deserve.

Perkin's is pitch perfect, but it is Tuesday Weld who grabs the bulk of the acclaim for her terrifyingly realistic portrayal of Sue Ann.  The way she makes those tonal shifts with so much ease, it's flawless.  Beverly Garland is also wonderful as Sue Ann's mother, bottling her over the top paranoia in order to convey not only what Sue Ann describes but also what she really is.

Oh, and Noel Black's direction is fantastic, not to mention the stunning cinematography that really helps set the mood.",1342051200,,1699,4.777397260273973
2552741,4,B000F5JQVO,"This movie has moderate flaws but many strengths and is well worth seeing. Tuesday Weld is  very pretty, sexy and alluring. As a heterosexual guy, I agree that you'd have to be deceased not to be turned on by her. Anthony Perkins is great as a mentally ill young man. The movie shows exactly what it would have been like to work inside a non union mill in New England in the 1960's (before they all moved overseas for more expolitable labor abd higher profits). The movie's  strengths are: first its length: 90 minutes- which in my view is exactly the right length for any movie-it is lean and sparse-like a lot of film noir classics of the late 1940's,in a good way in its editing-nothing is wasted in a way that puts today's movies to shame. The other strengths are the top notch acting of Weld and Perkins and the filming  on location in Great  Barrington Mass.  In addition ,Tuesday Weld acts in a way that is delightfully devious and sociopathic as to be the cinematic heir to  film noir's Lizabeth Scott of the 1940's. A weakness is that  there are about 3 or 4 parts in the movie where common sense would tell the viewer- that ""this doesnt make sense"" in the logical progression of the story- and other doable choices in the turn of the story were not taken-thus resulting in a 4 instead of doable 5 star rating.
  Lastly, no character in the movie is likable, in my opinion-in a way similar in this respect only to another classic film of the next year, (1969), ""The Prime of Ms. Jean Brodie"". Tuesday Weld-had a reputation in the 60's of thinking she was far more beautiful and talented than she in fact was-definitley beautiful and an excellent actress-but not quite as much  of both as she thought, in many observers opinions  and she turned down dozens of excellent roles- like ""Bonnie"" in Arthur Penn's 1967 ""Bonnie and Clyde"" to Faye  Dunaway . As a result ,""she did things HER way"", but was not quite the actress she could have been on screen .",1337990400,,1959,4.47191011235955
2552742,5,B000F5JQVO,"Imagine Hitchcock and Truffaut getting together with a gifted director of photography who knew just how to get the most out of a brilliant late summer in the Berkshires, and deciding to make a movie together.  They could not have done any better than ""Pretty Poison"".  If most people know Anthony Perkins from ""Psycho"", I can only suggest that ""Pretty Poison"" is a better and more satisfying film in every way.  If most people know Tuesday Weld from other films, I'm sure they already love her, but they should be prepared to love her even more. I saw this when it first came out in 1968 and again in the VHS days long ago,  nonetheless, I was stunned by its brilliance when I saw it again recently.  The colors alone are a revelation, the acting is perfect; the ironic tragedy of the plot might not be to every taste, but if it isn't to yours, you will still have had a sensational experience watching it.

Dennis Pitt, an emotionally disturbed arsonist prone to fantasizing, is released from a mental institution and ventures out into the real world where he tries to impress Sue Ann, a high-school blonde with the face of a baby doll, by pretending to be a spy for the CIA.  At the time of Pitt's release from the asylum, his doctor admonished him to stop fantasizing because there is no place for it in the real world.  It turns out, though, that the real world contains even crazier and more dangerous psychopaths than do the insane asylums.  ""Pretty Poison"" has a fascinating premise and it should have been a far better movie.  The trouble is the direction is flat and uninspired.  The movie is slow-paced and fails to build any significant suspense or thrills, which is out of joint with its subject matter.  On the other hand, Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld turn in well-honed performances as psychopaths, and, oddly enough, of the two, Weld comes off as the scarier.",1218844800,5,1113,5.367816091954023
2552746,4,B000F5JQVO,"It was great to see Tuesday Weld again, and in her prime, physically. She was a real ""looker,"" to use an old phrase. Just seeing her was worth the price of the rental.

Usually I point out the photography or the riveting story as the facet (s) of the movie I enjoyed best, but in this case it's the actors and characters they played.

It was also fun to see Tony Perkins (""Dennis Pitt"") play his Norman Bates-type ""Pyscho"" character again, although I prefer ""Bates"" over ""Pitt."" At least Bates wasn't all talk like Pitt was in this story. ""Norman"" delivered the goods, when needed! Here, Weld's ""Sue Ann Stepanek"" walks the talk.  Weld, by the way, proves in this film she's a lot more than a pretty face.

For those watching for the first time, I would advise being patient with the first half of this film. The story doesn't really have much spark to it until ""Sue Ann"" begins to reveal her true inner self. which is not ""pretty."" Until then, we just get Perkins' nutcase character going on and on to Weld about his supposed CIA connections. Fortunately, as soon as this becomes tiresome, ""Sue Ann"" saves the film by springing into action.

This a good movie that has been largely ignored over the years. This recent DVD release will help but, at this point, I doubt it will ever been a ""known"" film except to fans of either Weld or Perkins, or by word of mouth on websites like Amazon.

It is Perkins' performance as Dennis Pitt that makes this movie work so well. At the onset of the story, we know Dennis is being placed on probation as he leaves his voluntary treatment. We do not know the reasons for these terms, yet we are given some foreshadowing hints. How dangerous was he, and is he still capable of perpetrating these acts? Fortunately, we find out the answer to this through his interaction with Sue Ann Stepanek, a pretty high school senior who is attracted to his ostensibly cosmopolitan, important stature. You see, Dennis likes to fantasize that he is involved with top secret missions with the CIA. We don't know whether he does this merely to impress people or he simply finds this a more entertaining way to live his life. Either way, we know it is not true, but does Sue Ann? This is a good ""little"" movie, which has a limited cast and a budget to match. It was directed by Noel Black, a veteran TV director, who also wrote the semi-autobiographical coming-of-age film ""Mischief."" In addition to the great performance by Anthony Perkins, there are some fine supporting performances by character actors John Randolph as Pitt's probation office and Dick O'Neill as the plant foreman. At about twenty-four years of age, Tuesday Weld looks slightly older than a high school student, but she turns in a decent performance nonetheless. The widescreen transfer is quite good and subtitles are a welcome option.

It's rated R, but I have no idea why - it should be either G or PG (absolutely no nudity - not even cleavage, less violence than a typical TV show, and no bad language). The only possible appeal this movie would have for anyone is that it is so (unintentionally) campy!

Honestly - all the positive reviews here have to be planted.

Anthony Perkins is also cast opposite Tuesday for a pairing that was charasmatic, repeated several years later in ""Play It As It Lays.""

I would describe it as neo-Hitchcock and that's not because of the presence of Anthony Perkins in the cast.  With the erosion of the Production Code this is quite daring stuff and pretty provocative for 1968.  Anthony Perkins may have given the performance of his career as Dennis Pitt, recently released(unleashed?) from a mental institution for arson.  The underappreciated Tuesday Weld gives an Oscar-worthy(not nominated, of course) turn as Sue Anne Stepanek, high school majorette and the object of Dennis' affections.  Good supporting turns by John Randolph as Dennis' caseworker and Beverly Garland as Sue Anne's strict mom.  The term indispensible is bandied about for a lot of films but not in this case.  On a trivial note, in the eighties there was a band from Philly who took their name from this film's title and had a minor hit, ""Nightime"".",1159574400,9,1042,5.052631578947368

8117743,3,B000F5JQVO,"PRETTY POISON is one of those movies that Id heard of but never had the opportunity to see.
For some reason it never appears on various movie channels or if it does its on at such a late hour that Ive missed it. And I check for movies that Ive missed to DVR on these channels! So I was glad to finally get the chance to see this film.

The movie stars Anthony Perkins as Dennis Pitt, a young man whos spent most of his life in an institution because while a youngster he was responsible for a fire that killed his aunt. Having gone through rehabilitation and psychiatric care he is about to finally be released. His probation officer Morton Azenauer (John Randolph) tells him it is best to avoid the creative fantasies that Dennis tends to place himself in and stick with reality, working the job hes found for him and getting on with his life.

Dennis begins work at a lumber yard where he does his job well enough but still has moments where he is distracted. Dennis boss Bud (Dick ONeill) is a jerk of a boss who looks for reasons to give Dennis a hard time. Of course this will lead to Dennis resentment of both Bud and the job he now works at.

On lunch break one day Dennis sees a beautiful young girl (Tuesday Weld), a cheerleader he spies marching with the band. He bumps into her, passing her a small vial and tells her to be quiet, they're watching and hell meet her at a theater that night. Once there he takes the vial and thanks her, leaving. She follows and he concocts a story that hes a secret agent on a mission. Her name is Sue Ann Stepanek and shes not intrigued by this supposed spy.

The two begin to spend time with one another going so far as Dennis meeting her mother and taking her out on a date. The make a stop by a local make out area where the cops harass them and take them back to Sue Anns house. It is there that we get our first glimpse of what Sue Ann is capable off as we see her slap her mother when they argue after the police leave. Dennis is shocked and leaves the house.

Sue Ann contacts Dennis again and at just the right time. It seems that his Azenauer has let Bud know about Dennis past and Bud then fires Dennis. When Dennis lets him know Azenauer is upset since Bud promised not to fire Dennis. Once more Dennis makes up a story about a new job and has Sue Ann play the part of a secretary confirming the job.

Angry at Bud, Dennis convinces Sue Ann that they have to perform an act of sabotage on the lumber mill, weakening the supports of a run off. In the middle of doing so the night watchman catches Dennis but Sue Ann knocks him unconscious with the wrench shes carrying. She takes his gun and shoots him, then pushes him into the river. Dennis is shocked but Sue Ann convinces him that when the run off falls it will look like it collapsed on the watchman and killed him.

The two love birds move forward from here into more potential threatening incidents before deciding to run off together. All the while we watch as Dennis, the man who is supposed to be the one with mental issues, is matched with this young all American girl who seems to be much more disturbed than he ever was. Where they will end up is anyones guess.

The film moves along at a slow pace, at times distracting because of this, but never quite enough to make it boring. It has a made for TV look from that time rather than a feature feel and Im not sure if that helps or hinders. This is not to say it looks bad, just mediocre. The performances by both leads are well done, more so for Weld than Perkins. Watching you cant help but recall all of the other times hes played mentally unstable characters, especially Norman Bates in PSYCHO. Perkins would go on to play other characters with questionable mental issues in several more films. While he hoped to put Bates behind him he somehow always found himself in these roles.

What makes this movie so interesting is the role that Weld plays here. Far too often you can tell just who the bad guy, who the person is most likely to commit a crime is in film. Here were presented with a wholesome young girl whos held in high regard but who underneath is the pretty poison the films title speaks of. It makes for an interesting character and performance.

The movie is being released by Twilight Time so you know up front that the image on screen will be the best possible to be found for this release. Extras include the isolated music and effects track, audio commentary with executive producer Lawrence Turman and film historians Lem Dobbs and Nick Redman, audio commentary with director Noel Black and film historian Robert Fischer, deleted scene script and commentary and the original factory trailer. I say this all the time but once more, Twilight Time has released this with only 3,000 copies available so if you want one make sure you order before they sell out.",1502323200,,4845,4.33186328555678
