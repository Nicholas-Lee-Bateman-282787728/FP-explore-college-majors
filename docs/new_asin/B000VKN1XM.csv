2943246,5,B000VKN1XM,"After I saw this movie on Sci-Fi, I knew I had to have it! It's a well put together documentary in the field of paranormal studies. With the included research of ""Zombie Road"", I have known a couple of people that have ""experienced"" some of the shadow people or children from that area. If you're into ghost hunting or paranormal research this documentary should be in your video library. It delivers a shocking TRUTH about early America in the days before the depression and during. Look at how the children were treated, its little wonder why these ""little"" spirits still haunt these orphanages and their graves. Unable to find the solace they lost in live.

2943247,4,B000VKN1XM,"I watched this film last night and let me start by saying this: I think it's very likely that there are ghosts, hauntings, etc., but I am a very ""skeptical believer"". Back in the late 1800's, during the big ""Spiritist"" movement, tables were being rocked and floated, seances produced phantom images and voices ""from beyond"", ectoplasm squiggled into the air from the noses and mouths of ""mediums"", and about all of it was exposed as fraudulent. These days people are, again, pretty enthusiastic about ghosts and hauntings and speaking with their departed loved ones through some show-biz personality who reels them in like brook trout. The big difference between the old fashioned hoaxters of 130 yrs ago and the new breed of ""Ghost Hunters"" is that the toys and technology are phenomenal in these times. We can do literally anything we want with film and imaging now in the digital age and one would be hard pressed to discern the ""real from the reel"".
  I saw an error in one of the pictures shown - supposedly a police photograph - depicting a room in a delapidated building in which Satanic rituals had supposedly taken place. There is a Sigil of Baphomet (the pentagram with the goat face and a double circle around it with Hebrew characters in the circumference) and it is a perfectly detailed representation which was certainly not hand painted onto the wall and it was doctored to look ""bloody"". It was very OBVIOUSLY superimposed on the photo to look as though someone had painted it on the wall. These kinds of cheap tricks cast doubt on everything they did and, sadly, cast doubt on everything everybody else does as well. The ""Baby gets thrown out with the bath water"" for most people, just like the Spiritist Movement back in the late 1800's.
  After having a night to sleep on it, I don't believe the photos OR the EVGs were authentic. I think at BEST they were digitally altered to appear and sound like much more than what they actually were. These guys obviously read the reviews of people who watched the ""Spooked"" dvd and used the critiques offered by them to tweak this one, giving them more of what they wanted. I understand they are not welcome at Waverly Sanitarium any longer for misrepresentation of the historical account. There are scores of competent, serious paranormal investigators out there who wouldn't dream of compromising the integrity of their work, who use the same advanced equipment as the Booths and NO ONE ever gets the kind of evidence concocted for this film. That spooky pic of the shadow children on the hilltop looking down at them was cool, but just a bit over the top for my belief structure.

  I enjoyed the film for the atmosphere, the historical significance of the orphanages and the lost children in them, the shots of the buildings and graveyards, and such, but - do I believe that everything they presented to be authentic documentation and untampered with? Hell no. I see the Booth brothers as show biz people. They are a couple guys who are in the privileged position of having the wherewithal by which to indulge in their hobbies to a fantastic degree. As entertaining as it is, I have a fair share of disdain for people who bastardize the efforts of others who are working hard to prove and validate the belief in ghosts, spirits, and hauntings. Guys like the Booths and their ilk (i.e. about anything on television) muddy the water for those honestly seeking the truth in these matters.
  Watch it...eat popcorn and light candles - it's fun and great  entertainment. Just don't buy into the hoax.",1212451200,41,3558,4.742718446601942
2943248,4,B000VKN1XM,"The Children of the Grave presents shocking aspects of American history regarding the treatment of orphans. I personally didn't find the movie scary (until the Zombie Road segment) and found the background music distracting and annoying. It would have been nicer to see more paranormal research and less acting. All in all tho, it's a great way to spend an evening.",1212192000,2,365,5.0
2943249,3,B000VKN1XM,"Interestingly enough I just happened to watch this movie right after playing the Black Sabbath song ""Children of the Grave""!

Well, I wasn't really impressed with the supposed ghost evidence they were showing in the film.  I guess it was real actual evidence, but the atmosphere of the entire film failed to really make me frightened of the things they were showing on screen.

It DID show, maybe by total accident, how unfortunate it was for children in orphanages to be treated as horribly as they were.  You will hear stories of some of the children who grew up in the orphanages and were treated like crap.  This was the thing that mostly kept me interested in the film.

Unfortunately they bounce around a lot, from all over the country, talking about different stories and ghost hauntings.  Fascinating how most spirits are of children, or that children are attracted to spirits.  There's a strong connection between children and ghosts, and the film does do a decent job showing you that.

Overall, it's your choice whether you want to check out this or not.",1211932800,5,1065,4.775956284153006
2943250,5,B000VKN1XM,Children of the Grave is a documentry on children ghosts. The movie is some what sad in that it deals with children who died in orphanages. The first part of the movie tells of the investigation of an old orphanage in St. Louis. They collect some awesome evps and images of ghosts. The second part deals with the investigation of zombie road. They find shadow people and tell of the hauntings of zombie road. They have child actors to portray the ghosts of children which is a nice touch. All and all it is a very good documentry for lovers of ghosts.,1211068800,3,551,4.411764705882353
2943251,2,B000VKN1XM,"I'm kind of mixed about this DVD.  It wasn't all that scary for one.  I think I have more of a problem the way it was filmed more than anything.  I think they could have just filmed it like a straight documentary instead of the Booth brothers trying to show what cool editors they were and putting in rock music and child actors that were for effect only.  And I really could not take those two guys with the berets seriously at all.  I mean, what was that all about?  It was laughable.  The actual video, audio, and photo evidence that they had really was only about 20 minutes' worth.  The rest was filler.  In a nutshell, I was not impressed.  The photo evidence and EVP's were cool, the sequence in the tunnel in the basement was awesome, but there just wasn't enough of this type of footage.  It was paranormal sensationalism, Booth brothers style.  I wouldn't say don't buy this, but I will say that I have seen much better.",1210636800,28,930,4.374269005847953
2943252,1,B000VKN1XM,"Ok, I happen to be a Spirit Communicator myself and so I believe my oppinion should hold some water... These people are very unprofessional appearing and the verbage is low class. I mean the comments they make to the children Spirits is a bit childish to say the least! As in: ""Do you like being dead?"" Come on!!! How stupid can you get? Who would say that to any Spirit? Adult or child? ""Do you like being dead?"" It's rather insulting and disrespectful to any Spirit. It's just plain a stupid remark to make. Most of the questions they asked the Spirits were very rediculas to say the least. I can't say these guys act like seasoned Spirit Communicators at all. I am wondering how the heck they managed to get the price of twenty five bucks for this dvd. A big waste of money. I was expecting this dvd to be pretty good by the reviews I read. From now on, I'm finding a place to see the trailer before I trust to buy again.",1201737600,10,924,4.255681818181818

2943287,5,B000VKN1XM,"As informative from a historical perspective as it is an intriguing paranormal documentary.  At times it slips from profound to near-amateurish, but the pace is fast and the production quality generally superior to almost all documentaries of this genre.  Even if the viewer is a total paranormal skeptic, one cannot help but feel great empathy for the hundreds of thousands of orphaned children, may of whom were abandoned, abused and died while in the care of 'orphan asylums'. There, so many lost their identities and have been forgotten,  Great research on that topic makes viewing worthwhile, even if you are simply interested in American social history from the late 19th to early 20th centuries.

The evidence was outstanding and the way they captured the history of the different places was truly amazing. I was on a constant emotional roller-coaster thinking about what these children must have gone through. I would, in the future love to visit some of these places and feel the energy for myself. Was constantly picking information up psychically while watching and had several ""omfg"" moments.

2943292,1,B000VKN1XM,"""I want to believe.""  A common phrase said amongst those who enjoy the idea of an extraterrestrial UFO or ghost phenomena being real.  Without a method to verify facts this idea easily defaults the brain into the confirmation bias.  And as it exists today I would say there isn't hardly any concrete evidence for either of these two things.  But for those that really want it to exist?  They have confirmation bias and create films like this; it is rife with it.  At one point one of the ""ghost hunter / researchers"" is talking to a local about a mass grave of children and was trying to get her to confirm whether or not the children died horrible deaths.  It is in this researches best interest for that answer to be ""yes"" because that will then lead them into saying, ""because they died horrible deaths they must be haunting the place""; ugh!

Overall, a film piece that plays on the hopes of people that there might be something after death.  That maybe there are ghosts roaming the earth.  To date, hardly any evidence of such a phenomena exists and these folks are just playing on peoples hopes and dreams for a buck.  Not once does the film try to explain anything about the phenomena other than, ""if people die horrible deaths they'll haunt places.""  Or, ""if it's a child ghost they'll cry and act like children""; one scene later, cue baby_crying.wav and claim it was a recording they made at a grave site claiming it's an ""EVP.""  The whole thing is laughable.",1466294400,,1467,4.5534351145038165

However, as others have said the actors, the music and stuff was really not needed. About halfway or so I began to feel that this movie was just dragging on.

The maker assumed the viewer doesn't even know what an EVP is, and offers a definition for simple tools people familiar with the paranormal already know about. They underestimated the viewer.

2943364,1,B000VKN1XM,"Where to start.. First - the narrating.. OMG the horribly annoying narrating.. The narrator sounded as though he were drunk, (tripping and slurring his words) and seemed as though he were paid to say orphaned children as much as he could in the shortest amount of time possible. The narration goes on and on to expound on how much these orphans weren't wanted - and comes off as trying way too hard to sensationalize everything (as though it wasn't sensational enough in the first place, that all these children were put into a mass unmarked grave).

For the first 21 minutes of the show, they just kept repeating the same information over and over again (simply changing how things were worded or how they had initially explained) and then threw in a smattering of statistics: 2/3 were this; 1/3 was that; 21% this 79% that. So what? You had my interest in the story without throwing around a bunch of statistics - so what was the point?!? Seems to me that they either threw it in as padding (to make it a longer show) or were having trouble with keeping the story moving along.

Anyhow.. Throughout the show, they never really go into any type of in-depth history for the various locations they supposedly investigated; nor do they show you any type of on site investigation (a-la Ghost Hunters or Ghost Adventures). No type of concrete proof/evidence to substantiate what they're claiming is shown; and the few EVP's they play are static/interference free to the point that it sincerely makes you wonder if they're faked. In the end, all you really get is a bunch of social commentary and really not so much commentary about ghosts (except for some stories that you're expected to take at face value).",1442620800,,1704,4.714765100671141

2943453,4,B000VKN1XM,"It is with great disappointment & sadness that I write this Review; because it has opened my eyes to a devastating reality that I never knew existed before I knew anything about this film.  A reality from the childhood days of my own Parents.  Where I believed orphanages, though not perfect & maybe at times a little short of food, were still the last salvation for babies & little ones of the 1900s & through-out the Great Depression.  And a place where they were safe for the most part; allowed to grow up to be productive members of society.

  But now I'm learning that this wasn't the case---it wasn't the typical young bully of the orphanages that these kids had to be worried about, it was literally the majority of the adults assigned to run them: sadists, pedophiles, child murderers, etc., all working in these foundling homes, preying on all these children.  The State of Illinois and all these other documented AND undocumented Orphanages across the U/S., have a verrrry dark cloud
 of deplorable shame and the Darkest Karma over their heads for what they all did to these thousands of parentless children.

  The atrocities and murders of these little ones, were like the genocides of Native-Americans, Blacks, Jews in Nazi Germany, and other countries; with those responsible being fully guilty of attempting to cull entire tribes/groups/nations of people at one time in history or another, simply because  they were thought of by some narrow-minded degenerates as ""an inferior people"".  That's always how it started and it's still going on to this present day.

  The only reason why the State of Illinois (and quite possibly the other States) are willing to even defy direct court orders to open the few files they have left of these child-victims, is because of an obvious fear of the descended-relatives of these orphans discovering a little loved one of theirs was brutalized and murdered in the very place that was supposed to have given them refuge!  Not to mention the bad press as well.

  I don't believe for one second the BS about putting formaldehyde into MILK for those babies & kids to drink, was some sort of popular ""pasteurization process!""  I'm not even a scientist or chemist and yet I even know that formaldehyde is something that would never belong in milk under any circumstances.  You can believe, they just wanted to experiment on those children, see how long it would take for them to get seriously ill, document it, and then kill them off & bury them in mass graves at the conclusion of their little ""Culling Experiment!""  Just like they did with the Small Pox-laced blankets to the Native Americans, The Tuskegee Experiment with Blacks, ChemTrails, Ebola, and every other experiment in-between.

  The State of Illinois needs to be forced to open those records so at least some of those children can be found by their decendents and be given a decent burial or cremation.  That way they can finally know that someone truly cares about them.  Doing that will help most of them find Spiritual Peace and move on---because there's no doubt that those kids are restless souls that deserve to be given a decent burial from a family member.  Not stock-piled on top of one another in a few mass graves like cans of sardines without even so much as their names to be identified with!  It's a horror that no child deserves, orphaned or not.

  This is why I'm in agreement with GreyPony ""Gail"" of Lost Wages, NV who gave 5.0 out of 5 stars stating: ""Worth it for Historic Value"", 7/20/2009.  Although I personally know for a fact, that when people are horrifically mistreated, their gravesite(s) & the areas where their abuses/murders took place, can leave a spiritual imprint of negative energy in those locations.  Because when you ""die"", your soul IS supposed to cross-over into a higher spiritual realm, and those souls who are very angry, resentful, or confused, sometimes cannot move on.",1423180800,,3926,4.835082458770614

2943457,1,B000VKN1XM,"Reminded me of a ""bad"" episode of Ghost Hunters...  as if any of those are ""good"".  The makers of this film were desperately seeking something scandalous to report but the best they could come up with was supposed EVP (electronic voice phenomenon) that sounded like a bunch of teenagers playing Beatles albums backwards in an attempt to find out if Paul is dead.  The supposed ""expert"" PhD (in paranormal studies) they interview throughout the film seems about as convincing as a representative of the Church of Scientology.

If you are into paranormal material on the level with Ghost Hunters then you may find this entertaining...  but if you are looking for a documentary...  move on to something else...  unless you are in the mood to make fun of everything you see presented by a film.

Another potential use for this film is as a drinking game in which you drink every time they use an exclamation point(and/or grammar and spelling errors)...  though most players will likely expire from alcohol poisoning long before the credits roll.",1422144000,,1041,4.902857142857143

The EV's are completely unconvincing, it's all too convenient for my satisfaction.

However, this is one of the better episodes I've seen so far; I enjoyed the story telling more than anything else.
It made for innocuous entertainment while being busy with other things.

I do however, seriously question the need for firearms; which the man says is for protection.

Well, that doesn't make a bit of sense to me, perhaps they would care to elaborate on that.

If you're dealing with spiritual entities, what good are bullets going to do?
Doesn't it make more sense to have a form of spiritual protection; in whatever form is comfortable to the individual ghost hunter.
Ghost hunting, although I have never engaged in this practice myself (nor do I care to), is not a cold hard science in itself.

Grant it there are universities that do have paranormal studies, but IMHO, they are the only people who can lay claim to any real legitimacy in conducting such studies within truly stringent academic parameters and give credence to the notion of paranormal investigation as a credible science.

Rather than interview historical experts (who certainly could testify about the time), they seemed to interview within their peer and interest group. Spelling and overuse of exclamation marks for on-screen text was a disgrace. Editing was horrible.  It would appear that they played a little fast and loose with facts. While I agree that any child dying alone is heartbreaking, they insinuated that any child death in an orphanage had criminal undertones but then never compared that rate to the rest of the population.

Due to its relatively good reviews we decided to give ""Children Of The Grave"" a watch.  Wow. Just...wow.

This ""documentary"" should be shown to aspiring documentarians as an example of the myriad of things that you should most assuredly not do when creating a movie. Terrible editing, bad and jarring rock music, horrible acting and voiceovers, and an utter lack of cohesive story telling made this film painful to sit through (an act that I only accomplished by sheer force of will). It seems like the Booths had a whole bunch of ideas that they found interesting, but instead of winnowing them down to a core few subjects to make a tight and interesting film they decided to skip merrily back and forth between them at the drop of a hat. Very little paranormal research is actually done during the film, and the little that they actually do is neither compelling nor thought provoking. Sadly, the aforementioned issues are, somehow, not even the most egregious problems with this film.

One could easily make a drinking game out of the copious grammatical and mechanical errors found in almost every single instance of descriptive text appearing on the screen.  On second thought, that might not be a good idea as the amount of alcohol one would consume due to the astounding number of incorrectly capitalized letters and random, sentence fragment ending exclamation points might kill a man long before even getting to ""through"" being used as a verb in place of its cheery little homonym ""threw."" Let us also not forget that, as anyone who made it out of first grade will know, the pronoun ""I"" should always be capitalized. The blatant disregard for the english language was painful until I reached that almost zen moment where I turned each new discovery into a personal triumph in an attempt to dissuade myself from running screaming from the room in frustration.

As both a teacher of English Literature and a devotee of the paranormal, this is possibly the worst so-called documentary I have ever seen. You can't tell EVPs from the overly produced music, and you cannot get a sense of the history of each place because the directors keep hopping around from place to place.

This was a solid concept in need of direction, editing, and proofreading. Cut out the scare shots, cut out the overly dramatic music, and get out of the way of your story. This would be interesting as a historical documentary without ANY paranormal elements, but instead of letting the story tell itself, the directors relied on poor grammar and creep factor.

2943608,1,B000VKN1XM,"I'll say one thing about this movie--I totally understood why ghost hunters are not respected by skeptics.  I am someone that believes in the possibility of ghosts, though I admit that if they exist, it is probably a rare phenomenon and not as interesting as we make it out to believe.  For the most part, probably most ""ghosts"" have other explanations.  However, I try to keep an open mind--and I've never been disgusted by ghost hunters in the past...not even those guys on that ""Ghost Adventures"" show.

The Booth brothers, though, totally ticked me off.  I only paid $1.99 to watch this, but I regretted spending even that much.  For one thing, they went all over the place.  They gave minute information about many things, but they never went into an in-depth history about the places they visited.

While it isn't uncommon for ghost hunters to sometimes exaggerate a little bit, this show was totally into sensationalizing.  Some of the things they said didn't seem to even have proof to substantiate it.  For instance, at one orphanage, there was a hostile ghost that didn't like people intruding into his space.  Now personally, I can understand it if ghosts wouldn't like people coming into an area they consider their territory.  However, these men seemed to assume that the ghost of the former janitor was a pedophile who killed the kids, even though it didn't seem that there were any documents to support this.

The one thing they focused on was how orphans tended to be mistreated.  It succeeded more in a social commentary of days of old than it did as a documentary on ghosts.

It did have a few scares with that creepy blonde ghost they kept showing.  It had a very abrupt ending where they talked about how some children are evil, and then they made a quick reference to Mary Roff.  It was very confusing and irritating.",1382486400,29,1838,4.7115987460815045

2943631,3,B000VKN1XM,"The production quality of the film was pretty good which gave it an authentic feel.  The chosen music also added to the quality. The film is more a documentary on turn-of-the-century orphans, their treatment and deaths than a ghost story.  If you are looking to be spooked, this film fails. It includes requisite ghost-hunting that we have now become accustomed to - EVP's played again and again, orbs, mists, thermal imaging and lots of walking in the dark through the woods and such. The historic perspective of the orphans was compelling and sad, though I would have liked to see more done about the mass grave issue.  Why not petition the county to provide a proper burial to each of the orphans? If the film makers tried to settle a few souls in the course of making the film, perhaps it would have added to the quality.

On the downside, I'm not sure what John Zaffis (of Haunted Collector fame) added to this - his over-dramatic statements were silly. There was no context for him to even be in the film - it would just suddenly cut to him for a weird, dramatic reading, which made me laugh.  On a smaller, pet-peeve scale, a few small details are irritating, like the exclamation points placed after all the onscreen text statements - a good editor should have eliminated these.  Additionally the blond ""paranormal reporter"" with the backwards baseball hat contributed little and brought the production value down. She seemed like a plant. I would have preferred a few interviews with archivists or librarians regarding the town history which led to the atrocities against children in Indiana and the concentration of deaths along Zombie Road.  Not interviewing the elderly woman who was an original rider on the ""orphan train"" was a true missed opportunity. Her first-hand commentary, perhaps in voice-over throughout parts of the film, would have been very compelling.  All in all, not what I would consider scary or a ghost story, but more a documentary on the lost lives of abused children and the fact that yup, walking in the woods at night is a little scary.

The dialogue was very poorly written, some of the typed dialogue on-screen was misspelled (they used the word through to say throw for example) and at the end of almost every single typed sentence they had to add an annoying exclamation point which I find very amateurish.

Also near the beginning one of the females who makes comments several times in the film as some sort of authority makes the idiotic statement to the effect that ""all cultures around the world believe in a proper burial"" suggesting that dead people are offended somehow if they are not buried properly, which is silly and the statement is simply not true. Many cultures around the world do not bury their dead as we do.

2943683,2,B000VKN1XM,"Before viewing this people have got to realize it is entertainment.  The average person seems to take these movies so seriously.  Some EVP's are residual sounds from the past.  They do not always signify a active haunting. The k2 whatever meters that people are so fond of using, go off when near a cell phone.  Some investigators keep out cell phones of sight from the camera, but within range for the meter to go off when they want it to.

I believe its especially a low blow to children to make a movie just about them and how so many can't go on.  Does it even occur to them that hanging around forgotten places and cemeteries where they setup equipment and such, is actually drawing spirits who don't want to leave the mortality of the world they left behind. By standing by a gravesite and reciting the deceased name over and over again might actually draw that spirit to the grave instead of just leaving him/her alone so that they can adjust to their new form of existence? I happen to believe in life after death, and I just get tired so many people sensationalizing psychic phenomena and manufacturing an abundance of ""evidence"" through the power of suggestion and atmosphere.

An investigation is done as an investigation, otherwise without scientific evidence, it is just an entertaining story.  It's a very morbid and a awful thing to concentrate on the ""child spirit"" when there is no proof that they are actually there.  Through EVP research it has been found that some spirits can mimic children or even your own voice because it is only sound...

Everyone involved with your production was so illiterate that not a single person knew how to spell ""threw""? We're less than ten minutes into your movie and you've already made yourself a laughingstock. I should have gone with my original instinct and simply given it zero stars based on the first half, since I was certain there was nothing they could do to pick up even half a star. But still, I figured if I was going to savage this flick in the way it so richly deserves to be savaged, I should probably watch the entire thing to make sure there weren't any more awesome transcriptions I could make fun of. (Unfortunately, there aren't.)

The basic premise here is that this is a ghost-hunter documentary that focuses on the ghosts of children at a few sites in the midwest. If you've seen a segment from any ghost-hunter television program, you've got a good idea of what you're going to get here, except every one of those is far more polished and professional than this. There's also an odd inversion; whereas with most of these sorts of things you're going to either get most of your time focused on the actual ghost hunting, with some background sketching or the filmmakers intercutting background info with the hunting, here it's almost all background; each of the hunting sequences (one for each site) lasts no more than five-ten minutes. What? All that build-up and then we get next to nothing?

Something tells me that if you actually paid money for this turkey, you through it into the fire yourself. In fact, you should consider buying a copy from the bargain bin at Wal-Mart so you can indulge yourself. Roared into my list of the hundred worst movies ever made at #16.

  Two people asked me to sign a waiver so they could use any of my photo's they needed and I stated I wouldn't sign the waiver they presented to me. I said I would let my photo's be used as long as proper credit was given, it wasn't,instead they used my photo and made it sound like they took the photo when they were filming the documentary.

I had no idea of the institution that housed these poor children.  This was a part of history that seems to have been shoved into an old file.  Bringing it to light - in my humble opinion - shows us just how bad things were in that era.
Learning about the poor babies who were fed poisoned milk, the little lady who had her doll thrown into the fireplace, the children who were nameless except for a number, buried in mass graves...  That's not horror in the ghostly sense, but horrible in the lack of compassion.
The shame of that era is well noted.  Train loads of abandoned children shoved into an institution to live out their lives?  How sad... how very sad.

3177744,4,B000VKN1XM,"I watched this film last night and let me start by saying this: I think it's very likely that there are ghosts, hauntings, etc., but I am a very ""skeptical believer"". Back in the late 1800's, during the big ""Spiritist"" movement, tables were being rocked and floated, seances produced phantom images and voices ""from beyond"", ectoplasm squiggled into the air from the noses and mouths of ""mediums"", and about all of it was exposed as fraudulent. These days people are, again, pretty enthusiastic about ghosts and hauntings and speaking with their departed loved ones through some show-biz personality who reels them in like brook trout. The big difference between the old fashioned hoaxters of 130 yrs ago and the new breed of ""Ghost Hunters"" is that the toys and technology are phenomenal in these times. We can do literally anything we want with film and imaging now in the digital age and one would be hard pressed to discern the ""real from the reel"".
  I saw an error in one of the pictures shown - supposedly a police photograph - depicting a room in a delapidated building in which Satanic rituals had supposedly taken place. There is a Sigil of Baphomet (the pentagram with the goat face and a double circle around it with Hebrew characters in the circumference) and it is a perfectly detailed representation which was certainly not hand painted onto the wall and it was doctored to look ""bloody"". It was very OBVIOUSLY superimposed on the photo to look as though someone had painted it on the wall. These kinds of cheap tricks cast doubt on everything they did and, sadly, cast doubt on everything everybody else does as well. The ""Baby gets thrown out with the bath water"" for most people, just like the Spiritist Movement back in the late 1800's.
  After having a night to sleep on it, I don't believe the photos OR the EVGs were authentic. I think at BEST they were digitally altered to appear and sound like much more than what they actually were. These guys obviously read the reviews of people who watched the ""Spooked"" dvd and used the critiques offered by them to tweak this one, giving them more of what they wanted. I understand they are not welcome at Waverly Sanitarium any longer for misrepresentation of the historical account. There are scores of competent, serious paranormal investigators out there who wouldn't dream of compromising the integrity of their work, who use the same advanced equipment as the Booths and NO ONE ever gets the kind of evidence concocted for this film. That spooky pic of the shadow children on the hilltop looking down at them was cool, but just a bit over the top for my belief structure.

  I enjoyed the film for the atmosphere, the historical significance of the orphanages and the lost children in them, the shots of the buildings and graveyards, and such, but - do I believe that everything they presented to be authentic documentation and untampered with? Hell no. I see the Booth brothers as show biz people. They are a couple guys who are in the privileged position of having the wherewithal by which to indulge in their hobbies to a fantastic degree. As entertaining as it is, I have a fair share of disdain for people who bastardize the efforts of others who are working hard to prove and validate the belief in ghosts, spirits, and hauntings. Guys like the Booths and their ilk (i.e. about anything on television) muddy the water for those honestly seeking the truth in these matters.
  Watch it...eat popcorn and light candles - it's fun and great  entertainment. Just don't buy into the hoax.",1212451200,41,3558,4.742718446601942

Well, I wasn't really impressed with the supposed ghost evidence they were showing in the film.  I guess it was real actual evidence, but the atmosphere of the entire film failed to really make me frightened of the things they were showing on screen.

It DID show, maybe by total accident, how unfortunate it was for children in orphanages to be treated as horribly as they were.  You will hear stories of some of the children who grew up in the orphanages and were treated like crap.  This was the thing that mostly kept me interested in the film.

Unfortunately they bounce around a lot, from all over the country, talking about different stories and ghost hauntings.  Fascinating how most spirits are of children, or that children are attracted to spirits.  There's a strong connection between children and ghosts, and the film does do a decent job showing you that.

The second part deals with the investigation of zombie road. They find shadow people and tell of the hauntings of zombie road.

And I really could not take those two guys with the berets seriously at all.  I mean, what was that all about?  It was laughable.  The actual video, audio, and photo evidence that they had really was only about 20 minutes' worth.  The rest was filler.  In a nutshell, I was not impressed.  The photo evidence and EVP's were cool, the sequence in the tunnel in the basement was awesome, but there just wasn't enough of this type of footage.

3177789,1,B000VKN1XM,"""I want to believe.""  A common phrase said amongst those who enjoy the idea of an extraterrestrial UFO or ghost phenomena being real.  Without a method to verify facts this idea easily defaults the brain into the confirmation bias.  And as it exists today I would say there isn't hardly any concrete evidence for either of these two things.  But for those that really want it to exist?  They have confirmation bias and create films like this; it is rife with it.  At one point one of the ""ghost hunter / researchers"" is talking to a local about a mass grave of children and was trying to get her to confirm whether or not the children died horrible deaths.  It is in this researches best interest for that answer to be ""yes"" because that will then lead them into saying, ""because they died horrible deaths they must be haunting the place""; ugh!

Overall, a film piece that plays on the hopes of people that there might be something after death.  That maybe there are ghosts roaming the earth.  To date, hardly any evidence of such a phenomena exists and these folks are just playing on peoples hopes and dreams for a buck.  Not once does the film try to explain anything about the phenomena other than, ""if people die horrible deaths they'll haunt places.""

3177861,1,B000VKN1XM,"Where to start.. First - the narrating.. OMG the horribly annoying narrating.. The narrator sounded as though he were drunk, (tripping and slurring his words) and seemed as though he were paid to say orphaned children as much as he could in the shortest amount of time possible. The narration goes on and on to expound on how much these orphans weren't wanted - and comes off as trying way too hard to sensationalize everything (as though it wasn't sensational enough in the first place, that all these children were put into a mass unmarked grave).

For the first 21 minutes of the show, they just kept repeating the same information over and over again (simply changing how things were worded or how they had initially explained) and then threw in a smattering of statistics: 2/3 were this; 1/3 was that; 21% this 79% that. So what? You had my interest in the story without throwing around a bunch of statistics - so what was the point?!? Seems to me that they either threw it in as padding (to make it a longer show) or were having trouble with keeping the story moving along.

Anyhow.. Throughout the show, they never really go into any type of in-depth history for the various locations they supposedly investigated; nor do they show you any type of on site investigation (a-la Ghost Hunters or Ghost Adventures). No type of concrete proof/evidence to substantiate what they're claiming is shown; and the few EVP's they play are static/interference free to the point that it sincerely makes you wonder if they're faked. In the end, all you really get is a bunch of social commentary and really not so much commentary about ghosts (except for some stories that you're expected to take at face value).",1442620800,,1704,4.714765100671141

3177950,4,B000VKN1XM,"It is with great disappointment & sadness that I write this Review; because it has opened my eyes to a devastating reality that I never knew existed before I knew anything about this film.  A reality from the childhood days of my own Parents.  Where I believed orphanages, though not perfect & maybe at times a little short of food, were still the last salvation for babies & little ones of the 1900s & through-out the Great Depression.  And a place where they were safe for the most part; allowed to grow up to be productive members of society.

  But now I'm learning that this wasn't the case---it wasn't the typical young bully of the orphanages that these kids had to be worried about, it was literally the majority of the adults assigned to run them: sadists, pedophiles, child murderers, etc., all working in these foundling homes, preying on all these children.  The State of Illinois and all these other documented AND undocumented Orphanages across the U/S., have a verrrry dark cloud
 of deplorable shame and the Darkest Karma over their heads for what they all did to these thousands of parentless children.

  The atrocities and murders of these little ones, were like the genocides of Native-Americans, Blacks, Jews in Nazi Germany, and other countries; with those responsible being fully guilty of attempting to cull entire tribes/groups/nations of people at one time in history or another, simply because  they were thought of by some narrow-minded degenerates as ""an inferior people"".  That's always how it started and it's still going on to this present day.

  The only reason why the State of Illinois (and quite possibly the other States) are willing to even defy direct court orders to open the few files they have left of these child-victims, is because of an obvious fear of the descended-relatives of these orphans discovering a little loved one of theirs was brutalized and murdered in the very place that was supposed to have given them refuge!  Not to mention the bad press as well.

  I don't believe for one second the BS about putting formaldehyde into MILK for those babies & kids to drink, was some sort of popular ""pasteurization process!""  I'm not even a scientist or chemist and yet I even know that formaldehyde is something that would never belong in milk under any circumstances.  You can believe, they just wanted to experiment on those children, see how long it would take for them to get seriously ill, document it, and then kill them off & bury them in mass graves at the conclusion of their little ""Culling Experiment!""  Just like they did with the Small Pox-laced blankets to the Native Americans, The Tuskegee Experiment with Blacks, ChemTrails, Ebola, and every other experiment in-between.

  The State of Illinois needs to be forced to open those records so at least some of those children can be found by their decendents and be given a decent burial or cremation.  That way they can finally know that someone truly cares about them.  Doing that will help most of them find Spiritual Peace and move on---because there's no doubt that those kids are restless souls that deserve to be given a decent burial from a family member.  Not stock-piled on top of one another in a few mass graves like cans of sardines without even so much as their names to be identified with!  It's a horror that no child deserves, orphaned or not.

  This is why I'm in agreement with GreyPony ""Gail"" of Lost Wages, NV who gave 5.0 out of 5 stars stating: ""Worth it for Historic Value"", 7/20/2009.  Although I personally know for a fact, that when people are horrifically mistreated, their gravesite(s) & the areas where their abuses/murders took place, can leave a spiritual imprint of negative energy in those locations.  Because when you ""die"", your soul IS supposed to cross-over into a higher spiritual realm, and those souls who are very angry, resentful, or confused, sometimes cannot move on.",1423180800,,3926,4.835082458770614

3177954,1,B000VKN1XM,"Reminded me of a ""bad"" episode of Ghost Hunters...  as if any of those are ""good"".  The makers of this film were desperately seeking something scandalous to report but the best they could come up with was supposed EVP (electronic voice phenomenon) that sounded like a bunch of teenagers playing Beatles albums backwards in an attempt to find out if Paul is dead.  The supposed ""expert"" PhD (in paranormal studies) they interview throughout the film seems about as convincing as a representative of the Church of Scientology.

If you are into paranormal material on the level with Ghost Hunters then you may find this entertaining...  but if you are looking for a documentary...  move on to something else...  unless you are in the mood to make fun of everything you see presented by a film.

Another potential use for this film is as a drinking game in which you drink every time they use an exclamation point(and/or grammar and spelling errors)...  though most players will likely expire from alcohol poisoning long before the credits roll.",1422144000,,1041,4.902857142857143
3177955,3,B000VKN1XM,"I don't usually watch ghost hunter shows on cable, not because I don't believe in spirits, but I never see what the crew sees, I never hear what they hear and I question a lot if not all of the so-called physical encounters; such as being pushed, shoved and the like. The EV's are completely unconvincing, it's all too convenient for my satisfaction.

However, this is one of the better episodes I've seen so far; I enjoyed the story telling more than anything else.
It made for innocuous entertainment while being busy with other things.

I do however, seriously question the need for firearms; which the man says is for protection.

Well, that doesn't make a bit of sense to me, perhaps they would care to elaborate on that.

If you're dealing with spiritual entities, what good are bullets going to do?
Doesn't it make more sense to have a form of spiritual protection; in whatever form is comfortable to the individual ghost hunter.
Ghost hunting, although I have never engaged in this practice myself (nor do I care to), is not a cold hard science in itself.

Grant it there are universities that do have paranormal studies, but IMHO, they are the only people who can lay claim to any real legitimacy in conducting such studies within truly stringent academic parameters and give credence to the notion of paranormal investigation as a credible science.

Rather than interview historical experts (who certainly could testify about the time), they seemed to interview within their peer and interest group. Spelling and overuse of exclamation marks for on-screen text was a disgrace. Editing was horrible.  It would appear that they played a little fast and loose with facts. While I agree that any child dying alone is heartbreaking, they insinuated that any child death in an orphanage had criminal undertones but then never compared that rate to the rest of the population.

The few times they actually played the EVP's or showed the photo evidence was done quickly and if you weren't paying very close attention, you didn't even hear the EVP's.  Had they deleted much of the filler material (repetitive ""interviews"" with ""experts""; background and photo's of detailing the past of the buildings, etc) and included more of the actual ghost hunting, this would have been a tremendous documentary.

3178060,1,B000VKN1XM,"My girlfriend, a few of our friends, and I enjoy watching ghost documentaries and movies, so we make getting together to do so while eating delicious food an occasional ""thing."" Due to its relatively good reviews we decided to give ""Children Of The Grave"" a watch.  Wow. Just...wow.

This ""documentary"" should be shown to aspiring documentarians as an example of the myriad of things that you should most assuredly not do when creating a movie. Terrible editing, bad and jarring rock music, horrible acting and voiceovers, and an utter lack of cohesive story telling made this film painful to sit through (an act that I only accomplished by sheer force of will). It seems like the Booths had a whole bunch of ideas that they found interesting, but instead of winnowing them down to a core few subjects to make a tight and interesting film they decided to skip merrily back and forth between them at the drop of a hat. Very little paranormal research is actually done during the film, and the little that they actually do is neither compelling nor thought provoking. Sadly, the aforementioned issues are, somehow, not even the most egregious problems with this film.

One could easily make a drinking game out of the copious grammatical and mechanical errors found in almost every single instance of descriptive text appearing on the screen.  On second thought, that might not be a good idea as the amount of alcohol one would consume due to the astounding number of incorrectly capitalized letters and random, sentence fragment ending exclamation points might kill a man long before even getting to ""through"" being used as a verb in place of its cheery little homonym ""threw."" Let us also not forget that, as anyone who made it out of first grade will know, the pronoun ""I"" should always be capitalized. The blatant disregard for the english language was painful until I reached that almost zen moment where I turned each new discovery into a personal triumph in an attempt to dissuade myself from running screaming from the room in frustration.

This review has become much longer than originally intended, and much, much longer than this film deserves. Please do yourself a favor and do not watch this atrocity. I'm going to go and cry in a shower now until I feel clean again.",1404000000,5,2279,4.818414322250639

As both a teacher of English Literature and a devotee of the paranormal, this is possibly the worst so-called documentary I have ever seen. You can't tell EVPs from the overly produced music, and you cannot get a sense of the history of each place because the directors keep hopping around from place to place.

This was a solid concept in need of direction, editing, and proofreading. Cut out the scare shots, cut out the overly dramatic music, and get out of the way of your story. This would be interesting as a historical documentary without ANY paranormal elements, but instead of letting the story tell itself, the directors relied on poor grammar and creep factor.

3178105,1,B000VKN1XM,"I'll say one thing about this movie--I totally understood why ghost hunters are not respected by skeptics.  I am someone that believes in the possibility of ghosts, though I admit that if they exist, it is probably a rare phenomenon and not as interesting as we make it out to believe.  For the most part, probably most ""ghosts"" have other explanations.  However, I try to keep an open mind--and I've never been disgusted by ghost hunters in the past...not even those guys on that ""Ghost Adventures"" show.

The Booth brothers, though, totally ticked me off.  I only paid $1.99 to watch this, but I regretted spending even that much.  For one thing, they went all over the place.  They gave minute information about many things, but they never went into an in-depth history about the places they visited.

While it isn't uncommon for ghost hunters to sometimes exaggerate a little bit, this show was totally into sensationalizing.  Some of the things they said didn't seem to even have proof to substantiate it.  For instance, at one orphanage, there was a hostile ghost that didn't like people intruding into his space.  Now personally, I can understand it if ghosts wouldn't like people coming into an area they consider their territory.  However, these men seemed to assume that the ghost of the former janitor was a pedophile who killed the kids, even though it didn't seem that there were any documents to support this.

The one thing they focused on was how orphans tended to be mistreated.  It succeeded more in a social commentary of days of old than it did as a documentary on ghosts.

It did have a few scares with that creepy blonde ghost they kept showing.  It had a very abrupt ending where they talked about how some children are evil, and then they made a quick reference to Mary Roff.  It was very confusing and irritating.",1382486400,29,1838,4.7115987460815045

3178128,3,B000VKN1XM,"The production quality of the film was pretty good which gave it an authentic feel.  The chosen music also added to the quality. The film is more a documentary on turn-of-the-century orphans, their treatment and deaths than a ghost story.  If you are looking to be spooked, this film fails. It includes requisite ghost-hunting that we have now become accustomed to - EVP's played again and again, orbs, mists, thermal imaging and lots of walking in the dark through the woods and such. The historic perspective of the orphans was compelling and sad, though I would have liked to see more done about the mass grave issue.  Why not petition the county to provide a proper burial to each of the orphans? If the film makers tried to settle a few souls in the course of making the film, perhaps it would have added to the quality.

On the downside, I'm not sure what John Zaffis (of Haunted Collector fame) added to this - his over-dramatic statements were silly. There was no context for him to even be in the film - it would just suddenly cut to him for a weird, dramatic reading, which made me laugh.  On a smaller, pet-peeve scale, a few small details are irritating, like the exclamation points placed after all the onscreen text statements - a good editor should have eliminated these.  Additionally the blond ""paranormal reporter"" with the backwards baseball hat contributed little and brought the production value down. She seemed like a plant. I would have preferred a few interviews with archivists or librarians regarding the town history which led to the atrocities against children in Indiana and the concentration of deaths along Zombie Road.  Not interviewing the elderly woman who was an original rider on the ""orphan train"" was a true missed opportunity. Her first-hand commentary, perhaps in voice-over throughout parts of the film, would have been very compelling.  All in all, not what I would consider scary or a ghost story, but more a documentary on the lost lives of abused children and the fact that yup, walking in the woods at night is a little scary.

I was hoping for a program that would discuss the history of the orphans, and there was a bit of that.  However, I found myself thinking that I could edit this program in a better way that would hopefully tell the stories in a concise manner.  Things jumped from one building to the next and then back again.

As some have stated earlier, being told what you are going to see or hear was annoying.  Also, early in the show, someone states that you have to work to make EVPs understandable.  That made me suspicious of all of their EVPs.  I wish they had just presented the evidence and let us form our own opinions.

I've watched many ""ghost hunter"" type shows; even though I might have thought some of them were not worth watching, this is the first time I've just cut the program off.

I found it to be remarkably free of interesting content and full of hokey images.  It surprised me because I have been fascinated listening to Guiley (one of the commentators) in other contexts.  However, if you like content-free, generalized spookiness this might be the movie for you.

3178179,2,B000VKN1XM,"Well, thought maybe this movie would convince me of something but all it convinced me of was that you can't count on reviews.

The only thing I found of any value were some shots (mostly stills) or some old buildings, etc.

The dialogue was very poorly written, some of the typed dialogue on-screen was misspelled (they used the word through to say throw for example) and at the end of almost every single typed sentence they had to add an annoying exclamation point which I find very amateurish.

Also near the beginning one of the females who makes comments several times in the film as some sort of authority makes the idiotic statement to the effect that ""all cultures around the world believe in a proper burial"" suggesting that dead people are offended somehow if they are not buried properly, which is silly and the statement is simply not true. Many cultures around the world do not bury their dead as we do.

Also reused so many images I suppose to make this more than a 10 minute film, but a lot of it is so redundant. Very poor quality overall.

I'm surprised at all the good reviews and in fact surprised that this is even available on Amazon.

3178180,2,B000VKN1XM,"Before viewing this people have got to realize it is entertainment.  The average person seems to take these movies so seriously.  Some EVP's are residual sounds from the past.  They do not always signify a active haunting. The k2 whatever meters that people are so fond of using, go off when near a cell phone.  Some investigators keep out cell phones of sight from the camera, but within range for the meter to go off when they want it to.

I believe its especially a low blow to children to make a movie just about them and how so many can't go on.  Does it even occur to them that hanging around forgotten places and cemeteries where they setup equipment and such, is actually drawing spirits who don't want to leave the mortality of the world they left behind. By standing by a gravesite and reciting the deceased name over and over again might actually draw that spirit to the grave instead of just leaving him/her alone so that they can adjust to their new form of existence? I happen to believe in life after death, and I just get tired so many people sensationalizing psychic phenomena and manufacturing an abundance of ""evidence"" through the power of suggestion and atmosphere.

An investigation is done as an investigation, otherwise without scientific evidence, it is just an entertaining story.  It's a very morbid and a awful thing to concentrate on the ""child spirit"" when there is no proof that they are actually there.  Through EVP research it has been found that some spirits can mimic children or even your own voice because it is only sound...  If you can't share a cup of coffee with him/her visibly in full sight, then all the conjecture is through your own mind. This type of film is just fodder for the imagination.",1372809600,,1738,4.631921824104235

3178196,1,B000VKN1XM,"Children of the Grave (The Booth Brothers, 2007)

It took me almost three months to get around to watching the second half of Children of the Grave, a phenomenally terrible documentary about ghost hunters, because the first half was so bad I didn't know if I wanted to keep torturing myself with it. I knew this was going to be a real gem when, during the transcription of a voice recording, we see the phrase ""...she through it into the fire"" pop up on the screen. Really? Everyone involved with your production was so illiterate that not a single person knew how to spell ""threw""? We're less than ten minutes into your movie and you've already made yourself a laughingstock. I should have gone with my original instinct and simply given it zero stars based on the first half, since I was certain there was nothing they could do to pick up even half a star. But still, I figured if I was going to savage this flick in the way it so richly deserves to be savaged, I should probably watch the entire thing to make sure there weren't any more awesome transcriptions I could make fun of. (Unfortunately, there aren't.)

The basic premise here is that this is a ghost-hunter documentary that focuses on the ghosts of children at a few sites in the midwest. If you've seen a segment from any ghost-hunter television program, you've got a good idea of what you're going to get here, except every one of those is far more polished and professional than this. There's also an odd inversion; whereas with most of these sorts of things you're going to either get most of your time focused on the actual ghost hunting, with some background sketching or the filmmakers intercutting background info with the hunting, here it's almost all background; each of the hunting sequences (one for each site) lasts no more than five-ten minutes. What? All that build-up and then we get next to nothing?

Something tells me that if you actually paid money for this turkey, you through it into the fire yourself. In fact, you should consider buying a copy from the bargain bin at Wal-Mart so you can indulge yourself. Roared into my list of the hundred worst movies ever made at #16.

  Two people asked me to sign a waiver so they could use any of my photo's they needed and I stated I wouldn't sign the waiver they presented to me. I said I would let my photo's be used as long as proper credit was given, it wasn't,instead they used my photo and made it sound like they took the photo when they were filming the documentary.

3178201,5,B000VKN1XM,"Once again the ""ghostly"" value of the video is overwhelmed by the historic value.
I had no idea of the institution that housed these poor children.  This was a part of history that seems to have been shoved into an old file.  Bringing it to light - in my humble opinion - shows us just how bad things were in that era.
Learning about the poor babies who were fed poisoned milk, the little lady who had her doll thrown into the fireplace, the children who were nameless except for a number, buried in mass graves...  That's not horror in the ghostly sense, but horrible in the lack of compassion.
The shame of that era is well noted.  Train loads of abandoned children shoved into an institution to live out their lives?  How sad... how very sad.
I am not sorry I bought this DVD, but it sure doesn't come across as frightening if that's what you're looking for.  But man's inhumanity to man comes across with shocking clarity.",1248048000,19,926,4.449704142011834
