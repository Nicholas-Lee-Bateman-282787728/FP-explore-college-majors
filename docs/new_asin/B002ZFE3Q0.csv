5. BONUS:  The Waterfall Hunter takes you on an actual hike - you will learn about one of Maui's most famous hiking trails and Waterfalls!

Many of the waterfalls are more difficult to get to than what the average tourist is willing to hike, so the video includes views of Maui you might not get to see even going there yourself.

As far as negative reviews:  no one promised you this will tell you how to get to the waterfalls - If you want to learn more about Maui's waterfalls, check out ""Waterfalls of Maui"" as that video has an educational narration track that shares interesting tidbids about the places and names of waterfalls shown.

If you want to know how to get to a great Maui Waterfalls, then watch the ""Waterfall Hunter"" extra at the end.",1344643200,,1335,4.714285714285714
8513775,2,B002ZFE3Q0,"This video shows you some of the highlights of Maui, but the narrator gives pretty cheesy narration.  The quality of the video is not great and when he was shooting the camera moves much too fast at times and makes you dizzy.  This worked great the first time, but would freeze in spots when I showed it a second time.  The ""Waterfall Hunter""  sounds pretty full of himself.",1332892800,,374,4.455882352941177
8513776,1,B002ZFE3Q0,"This video was very disappointing. if you expected a guide type of video you will learn nothing after watching this video.
 * Home made video packaged with some background music
 * video quality is poor.
 * some cryptic aerial views shown in between
I am disappointed that amazon would sell these types of poor quality videos. I wish they would review some",1321142400,,356,4.709677419354839
8513777,5,B002ZFE3Q0,"Beautiful video, looks very professional. It shows more than a few highlights. . . It really is a great overview of the entire island, taking you on some adventuresome hikes to places easy to get to along the road and off the beaten path.  There are many beautiful shots of waterfalls, beaches and mountains. Plus there is an episode of the Waterfall Hunter, he shows you the hike to one of Maui's best waterfalls. It covers most of the island in one hour. You can watch it with just music or hear the narration.  I watched the whole video, unlike the guy who could not play it, so he said it was not good. The video gives a very good overview of the beauty of Maui.",1308873600,,666,4.277777777777778
8513778,1,B002ZFE3Q0,Maui: Island of Enchantment is a low budget film that almost looks homemade.  I could never get it to play properly on my Sony equipment and had to return it.  I would strongly advise against buying it.,1302739200,,202,4.4324324324324325
