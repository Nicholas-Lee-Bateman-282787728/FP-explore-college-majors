8686566,5,B00P6OOEQG,"The horrors of Nazis, the suffering of jews are difficult to watch. Once you watch this movie it is impossible to forget the unbelievable atrocity, cruelty, inhumanity of Germans, what they inflicted on the jews, and on those people they perceived as their enemies. Every middle school student all over the world, should be required to watch this movie! I believe once in for all it will make young one's comprehend what is fascism, extremism, what hate, intolerance lead to, what is anti semitism, what is war. It is especially horrifying to see the millions of bones piled up high, and see children walking amongst them, and german citizens in their ""happy"" villages, with planted flowers, just few miles away drinking their beer...",1458432000,,734,4.975609756097561
8686567,5,B00P6OOEQG,This is quite an excellent documentary and the DVD has several really worthwhile extras including the Russian Auschwitz documentary and the Death Mills. But... why didn't they include the film this documentary is about? 'German Concentration Camps'. They clearly state that it is finished. They show excerpts but the entire documentary is nowhere to be found... and that's what I really wanted to see. Anyone have any information as to why the actual documentary isn't in this DVD? Hopefully it will be when they make a US edition.,1448064000,,531,5.045454545454546
8686568,5,B00P6OOEQG,"Although there's disturbing footage throughout most of the film, The last 15 minutes or so was more about the process of making of this film, how it got shelved, why they're re releasing it etc. During the last minute of the film the director decides to throw in a few more horrifying shots of Jews with their heads blown off, and others with mutilated faces, and during this last minute or two, there's  footage of one prisoner who unlike the others had his head completely intact, but this guy apparently died in such terror! I can't stop seeing his eyes in my head! This guy was obviously terrified! His mouth and eyes are wide open as he lies there, and I just had to rewind it on my Apple TV. That prisoner's face in that moment, sums up what that war was about. Haunting stuff!",1439596800,3,783,4.4
8686569,4,B00P6OOEQG,"Apparently never to be seen again in the U.S. HBO showed it a couple of times, but it's not on their OnDemand, HBO Go, Amazon or pretty much anywhere except a Region B DVD. I have it on my TiVo but it can't be transferred even to one of my other TiVos. It is horrible to watch, but it makes a dent in understanding why Israel classifies so many things as ""security"" issues, even when they don't seem so to ""rational"" people.",1438992000,,424,4.182926829268292

8686571,5,B00P6OOEQG,"This will forever be the most powerful and scariest film I have ever seen. This is the kind of thing that I started to watch and put down after 25 mins. The haunting footage remained with me for weeks after. All this time I kept thinking about it. I resolved to watch the rest of the film because I realized I had to. To know, to understand just how truly horrific this war was. I had to honor the people that went through this by watching and allowing myself to feel what I was initially trying to avoid. This film is not for the faint of heart, and yet I think most adults should see this film, and go through the same process I did. It's complicated, because you want people to see it but it's also filled with some of the most disturbing footage I've ever seen.  But I can tell you your understanding of this war will never be the same.  The documentary itself is amazingly put together and strikes the right tone that is needed for maximum impact while being respectful and honoring of the survivors that were interviewed.",1430697600,9,1027,4.34375
8686572,1,B00P6OOEQG,This DVD was defective as it did not play on either of our mulitisystm DVD or Blu Ray players which both play region 2 discs.,1428105600,,125,4.04
8686573,5,B00P6OOEQG,"Just saw this at the Sedona film festival. A terrific documentary of the liberation of the death camps. It should be required viewing in all churches, mosques and temples to show what happens when religious hatreds are excuses for mass slaughters.",1425513600,8,247,5.048780487804878
