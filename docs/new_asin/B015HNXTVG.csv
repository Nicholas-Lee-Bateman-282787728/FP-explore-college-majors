7439010,5,B015HNXTVG,"Despite the fact that I did not care for the ending, this version was incredible. The sets, the Corps, the orchestra, and the Prima of Primas, Svetlana Zakharova, made this for me one that I will watch over and over again. One comment said that the Russian audience was rude because of the noise that they made. I found it to be an authentic enthusiam that just added to the show's charms. It makes me want to get on a plane and then buy a ticket to go see it at the Bolshoi!",1452211200,9,475,4.118279569892473
7439011,2,B015HNXTVG,"This video of Swan Lake could be entitled ""Frozen Lake."" Yuri Grigorovich's production is a Swan Lake without any heart. There's not even a swan -- everything is a vision from the Evil Genius (Artemy Belyakov camping it up), who I guess has some sort of homoerotic bond with Siegfried. This dark, bleak Swan Lake even erases Tchaikovsky's apotheosis music (which gives a hint of hope and redemption). The ugly, dark decors permeate the stage from curtain to curtain.

Grigorovich's changes to the Petipa/Ivanov choreography are all pretty terrible. The national dances in Act Three become indistinguishable from each other because he's erased the character dances and replaced them with generic pointe work dances. Know that magical moment when Odette bourrees onstage and takes a big leap? It's gone in Grigorovich's version as Odette is already ONSTAGE (having been conjured by the Evil Genius, or something).

Nevertheless I have seen the Bolshoi perform this Swan Lake live and with the right performers they can create some emotion and drama. Not Svetlana Zakharova and Denis Rodkin. Rodkin is handsome but doesn't project much beyond vacuous good looks. Even so, with this production's conception of Siegfried as a complete non-entity at least I can say that Rodkin gets the job done and looks good.

Svetlana Zakharova is more problematic -- she is physically one of the most exquisite creatures to set foot on the stage. Her beautifully tapered limbs and feet have set an almost impossible benchmark for other ballerinas to follow. But emotionally, she's cold and blank. She does some smirking as Odile but her Odette seems like an excuse to show off her beautifully extended legs and arms. A lot of the big moments go for nothing -- for instance, there's that wonderful moment at the end of the White Swan pas de deux where Odette completes a series of rapid beats on her leg while remaining still everywhere else. Those beats when done right look like the fluttering of a heart. Uliana Lopatkina of the Mariinsky makes this THE most beautiful moment in the entire ballet. Zakharova barely moves her foot/leg. This is just one of many examples of how Zakharova can dance all the steps, look absolutely beautiful, but miss the heart and soul of the ballet. She never ever looks at Siegfried. There's no development of their relationship during the white act from one of fear to trust. As I said in terms of the steps Zakharova is scrupulous and there's nothing she can't do physically. But that's not what makes an Odette.

The camera work and video quality are fantastic. The Moscow corps are as usual stellar. But this is a Swan Lake with no soul.",1451779200,6,2657,4.897777777777778
7439012,2,B015HNXTVG,"I love Swan Lake; I have six other productions on Blu-ray, but I'll never watch this one again.
The dancing, sets and costumes are just fine, although not nearly as good as the Mariinsky Ballet's version released November 2015.
What absolutely ruins this production is the horrible finale.  Tchaikovsky wrote one of the most magnificent finale ever written for ballet, which they cut out for this production, substituting a nondescript musical ending to support a limp visual ending.",1451692800,10,483,5.1923076923076925
7439013,2,B015HNXTVG,"Tchaikovsky's beloved ""Swan Lake"" ballet receives a very good performance on this new DVD from Belair. The main protagonists are Svetlana Zakharova as Odette/Odile, Denis Rodkin as Prince Siegfried, and Artemy Belyakov as the evl Rothbart, although he is strangely referred to in the production as the Evil Genius. The dancing is superb, the orchestra play well, and the scenery is very good.
However I cannot recommend this DVD because of the disgraceful behavor of the audience. For any good performance enthusiastic applause is expected and usually well deserved by the hard-working cast. In this performance the audience goes totally overboard when it comes to praise; as first act proceeds there are increasingly wild and frequent bursts of applause accompanied by hooting and rhythmical clapping, which rises to a frenzy at the end of the act. During the first 40 minutes of the second act the audience is relatively well behaved, but then bad manners again take over, and the rest of the performance is seriously interrupted with more hooting and both regular and rhythmical clapping. (For the record  I should point out that I am reviewing the regular DVD, not the Blu-ray version.)
Conclusion: buy this DVD only if you can put up with the ill-behaved audience. I recommend either the Kirov Ballet version conducted by Viktor Fedotov or the Mariinsky Theatre version conducted by Valery Gergiev; both are viewable in HD on the Internet.

7439014,5,B015HNXTVG,"An Amazon reviewer recently complained that the last thing we need is another Swan Lake after it was released by the Royal Ballet on blu-ray for the second time, a rehash which not even superstar Natalia Osipova could save.  However, we DO need another Swan Lake.  The Bolshoi has finally added Swan Lake to its HD Collection and it has been well worth the long wait - it far surpasses anything that we have seen from any other company, anywhere.

How to best convey the vast differences between the Bolshoi and Royal Ballet versions?  Imagine being hungry: Moscow serves you a platter of meat and potatoes, London gives you candy floss.  Those who prefer an emphasis on mime, posturing and the role of male dancers in classical ballet reduced to the absolute minimum will not admire this dynamic version from the Bolshoi.  Men, including Rothbart, get to dance.  And how!  Although he comes across as wooden, it cannot be denied that Denis Rodkin as Prince Siegfried is a superb dancer.  Igor Tsvirko as the campy fool is a sensation.

It is the sheer perfection of the Bolshoi corps de ballet in the lakeside scenes which elevates this production above all others.  As for Svetlana Zakharova, we know from her performances in Bayadere and Sleeping Beauty that she is one of the world's finest ballerinas. but how does she fare in the demanding dual role of Odette/Odile?  How does she compare with Osipova?  Have no fear - in Swan Lake (as in everything else), Zakharova is phenomenal.

Lavish costumes, impressive sets and expert lighting add to the enjoyment, the blu-ray picture quality and sound excellent.  It is only the closing moments of the ballet that prompt howls of outrage.  The familiar, final bars of the score, the rising, rippling music played on the harp then ending in crashing chords (Tchaikovsky at his most inspired, bringing even a rugby player to tears) has been replaced with a quiet fade-out of the swan theme.  Sacriledge!  Tchaikovsky's final bars can be moving, uplifting, noble, even triumphant - to match the chosen ending (in most productions the lovers perish, however there are a few versions where they live happily ever after, going off to get married and to suffer like everyone else}.  Here, she dies, he lives...

Tchaikovsky's magnificent original score just doesn't fit as Siegfried, the curtain falling, wanders across the stage looking hopelessly lost.

In spite of the ill-chosen conclusion, overall the Bolshoi's Swan Lake is so superior to any other production that it would be unthinkable to rate it any less than five stars.",1448236800,24,2574,4.912037037037037

8733618,5,B015HNXTVG,"Have read some of the reviews here, what a bunch of stupid comments, this the best version of Bilshoi in blu Ray, Yuri Grigorovich is the czar of ballet since soviet time, all other versions including Marinsky don't even come close, ballerina are not 100% actress! Watch a Hollywood movie instead! Go somewhereelse, stop whining. Only from Bolshoi by Grigorovich you can watch all the 5 princess dances including the Russian dance, Marinsky totally ruined the storyline and choreography. ask yourself this who dare to compare to the Czar, Yuri Grigorovch is the king of ballet, it is not perfect compare to 80's version but this the first Bolshoi swanlake in blu Ray, I enjoy every minutes of it",1463961600,4,695,4.848739495798319

8733620,2,B015HNXTVG,"The reconfigured ending is the least of this ""Swan Lake""'s problems; the score has been fiddled-with throughout. The problem is that the revision is so half-assed. And that there is no --as in zero-- chemistry between the leads. Rodkin is no virtuoso, to be sure, but I lay the blame at Zakharova's feet (among other appendages). She is an exquisite dancer, but she spends the entire ballet being exquisite, and behaving as if being partnered were an imposition. This is as soulless a ""Swan Lake"" as I never hope to see again. The audience is over-enthused, killing any momentum that could have accrued, if allowed to. There is some nice work for the swan contingent, but it never adds up to much. And there's a great, athletic fool and an impressive if generalized Rothbart, doing more than his share of the dancing. But even the 36 fouettes fail to convince. This swan is canned goods.  hfs",1458518400,,892,4.717948717948718
8733621,2,B015HNXTVG,"Svetlana is the best as usual, but her partner is awful.  He is too immature for her professional level. He has no connection with anyone he dances with.  I've seen this choreography live with Svetlana Zakharova and David Hallberg.  There were some synchronized dancing sections and David executed perfectly, while this male dancer is unable to synchronize any of those sections.  Bad performance, Svetlana alone can't save it.  This recording should have been of Svetlana and David.  Another annoying thing is the recording zooming in and out too much.  During critical technical dance execution moments, videographer should never zoom in on the dancer face!  But here they do.  The focus is the whole body, dancing is not on the face!  This performance is a disappointment knowing how great Svetlana is at live performances.",1457827200,13,826,5.142857142857143
8733622,3,B015HNXTVG,"I bought this simply for Zakharova's performance. I don't really care for the Bolshoi version of this ballet; for example, the corps de ballet moving while Odette finishes her solo.... why distract from such a moment? Also, there is no real feeling of swans in this production and no magic (to me, at least). So please, Bolshoi, reinvent your Swan Lake.... you guys are a fabulous company, but this production is stuck in the past.",1453766400,3,431,4.76
