5379841,5,B00A2XQTGE,"My children really enjoy this video. It does help with teaching them colors, of course I do assist in teaching them beyond this video. This show does a great job of teaching them colors it is not intended to teach creativity or individuality as some reviewers think. It is a children's video and is also not intended to amuse adults, just saying.",1382659200,,346,4.596774193548387
5379842,2,B00A2XQTGE,"This is only the color crew segment.  So it is a repeat of the same thing with different colors in each one.  Fun at first, but gets old fast.",1380844800,,142,3.8620689655172415
5379843,5,B00A2XQTGE,"My only problem with color crew is that there are not more DVDs to purchase.  It is a good show to teach color, sharing, and increase word power by discussing the primary color and why it always colors the wrong item. My grand son likes the eraser and the tsk tsk  from the other crew member. It is enjoyable",1375315200,,308,4.203389830508475
5379844,5,B00A2XQTGE,"My 9 month old grandaughter loves Color Crew, espescially Mr. Eraser. They just took it off Netflix, so I'm buying this DVD for her.",1374192000,,132,4.541666666666667
5379845,4,B00A2XQTGE,"My two year old just LOVES this.  I'm not thrilled about the four chapters for finding color combinations (my son asks for combinations specifically and it's often hard to find them).  I wish they sang the intro song before each episode as well, but only does so at the very beginning when you select ""Play All"".  My son loves to sing along, so those are the only two con's I give it.",1374019200,,384,4.305555555555555
5379846,2,B00A2XQTGE,"Color Crew was suggested on our netflix, so I watched it with the kids a few times, they are 4 and 1. Even though they were very entertained by the show, and do ask for it when it shows up on netflix, I can't believe what a narrow view of colors this show displays! We are supposed to teach our children about creativity and individuality, not teach them ridged rules about what can and can not be green, blue or whatever. For those who have not seen the show, there are some good descriptions of it in the other reviews, when the ""color of the day"" fills in an object that is not normally his color, they call in mr. grumpy eraser who erases it and the ""correct"" color crayon then colors in the object. Sorry, but this is just not the way I would choose my children to learn about colors. If my kid wants to color a banana purple, then why not. I do realize the show is trying to teach colors by associating them with objects that are most commonly those colors, but some of the examples are just bad IMO. Like a frog can't be orange it has to be green....the ground can't be white it has to be green, etc etc. The ground is white when it snows, and there are orange tree frogs!",1370736000,5,1179,4.152838427947598
5379847,5,B00A2XQTGE,"my 3 year old loved watching this on netflix. before that we had never even heard of color crew at all.my 5 year old really enjoys it as well. they love ""guessing"" what the next color will be. cute, and educational.",1367625600,,215,4.2682926829268295
5379848,5,B00A2XQTGE,"Since 2 months old this has been my daughter's ""busy time"" video.  She is amazed by the simplicity, colors, music and animation.  I feel it is a great way to prep her for learning colors and shapes as well as aiding in her ability to track objects.  She is alert when watching and even laughs when ""Mr. Eraser"" comes out and does his job.  I have to admit I didn't buy this video.  I found it on Netflix for free.  Doesn't mean I can't give it a great review.  I feel is it much better than Baby Mozart for the really little ones.  Actually has some educational value.",1364342400,,568,4.194444444444445
5379849,5,B00A2XQTGE,My 2 yr old loves Color Crew and we purchased the DVD to go on a trip in a month. We have played it at the house and he loves it. It arrived on time and in good condition. I would recommend it to a friend,1362873600,,204,3.4565217391304346
5379850,5,B00A2XQTGE,"The Color Crew is adorable!
We saw this show for the first time on NetFlix and thats when I realized I had to own it.
Although, throughout the entire show there is only one word said and the rest is music, because all 3 of my children have been diagnosed with autism, it has taught them their colors and expressions.  They love it which makes me love it!",1362700800,4,354,4.205882352941177

5379884,3,B00A2XQTGE,"The DVD itself is awesome - my child absolutely loves color crew - we only play it when she is REALLYYY cranky and we need to occupy her for 10 minutes while preparing dinner or for plane flights.  The DVD case however, is really cheap - it ARRIVED cracked and pieces of the actual case were fallen off and more pieces kept breaking off with even the lightest handling.  I returned it for another one and the second one wasn't as bad but it still happened.  I've never had that happen with any other DVD I received in the mail except this one.",1464739200,,543,4.252427184466019

5379886,5,B00A2XQTGE,"There is something absolutely genius about this video. I was first told about BabyFirst Videos from my adult daughter. Since I am what some would call a ""granny nanny"" I was looking for educational programing to stimulate little minds. The 8 month old that is in my care loves this. I first Googled and let him watch this via the computer and You Tube. To see a baby smile and giggle (and that's just when the intro music starts) is awesome. Great video, done well! Thanks",1461628800,3,472,4.5

5379889,5,B00A2XQTGE,"My 2-1/2 year old son will sit and watch the whole 2 video without getting up and running around. He won't sit still for anything else. The Color Crew is, and always has been, his favorite! He's known his colors since he could talk, and even his daycare was amazed at the fact that he could tell you whatever color you asked him. Definitely one I love!",1454025600,,352,4.268656716417911
5379890,5,B00A2XQTGE,"""Guess who's the color of the day!"" My LO absolutely loves the Color Crew. The DVD plays on a loop to keep baby entertained and the repetition of the episodes really do help baby with recognition of colors and words. BabyFirst programs are our go-to programs for developmental education. The only words spoken are the colors and there are coos and ahhs used to keep baby entertained (after all, babies cannot yet speak and communicate themselves with coos).",1451260800,,457,4.871794871794871
5379901,1,B00A2XQTGE,Great show for teaching kiddos colors. But feels like brain death for adults. I feel like I'm being transported into a strange world where the colors may snap and try to murder me at any moment.,1450051200,,194,4.416666666666667

5379922,3,B00A2XQTGE,I bought this for my 2 year old to learn his colors he liked it at first but it didn't keep his attention  for long throughout the whole video they only said one word I wouldn't recommend this for toddlers it's more or less for a 6 to 9 month old who just likes to stare at colors And listen to music which is perfect for that age group,1426636800,2,336,3.869565217391304

5379969,5,B00A2XQTGE,"When pursuing Netflix at 3 in the morning, this was the only show that we serious 20+ year olds could not resist. Such beautiful colors and charming writing were sure to reel us in. Like in the episode where purple gets the hat and colors a banana purple? Lets just say that some of us were simply moved to tears when the eraser had to do his job and destroy such a beautiful work of art. And then there was the time that green betrayed blue and colored the sky in green. Such writing can only come from the hands of the top writers in Hollywood. So in conclusion, Color Crew is the best offering on Netflix and it is deeply shameful that it did not receive the rewards it so badly deserves.

Overall, 5 crayons out of 5.",1390003200,19,721,4.18705035971223

What I like about this one compared to preschool prep is that this one has brown and pink, which was why I got it. I do love meet the colors better

this video is hard for me and my husband to watch with her. We fall asleep on it or opt to not watch it with her. After a week or rotating those videos she knows her colors. now we're on to quantities.",1389484800,2,482,3.9587628865979383

8546389,5,B00A2XQTGE,"Both of my girls love this show..they are ages 2 1/2 and 4 1/2. Great for children learning colors. They've now learned to guess the correct color something should be, before the crayon starts to color. When the crayon colors something the wrong color, they say ""No"" and then say the color it's suppose to be. They've really learned from this DVD.",1499299200,,347,4.612903225806452
