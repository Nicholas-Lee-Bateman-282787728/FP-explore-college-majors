7508203,5,B017NESD54,"My son with Down Syndrome loves the entire Prep School Company DVD series.  We have letters, phonics and now math.  Excited to see how it helps him.  His 6 and not too verbal yet, but knows all his letters and numbers to at least 20 and even some sight words.  We are reading the Level 1 books and he is copying me word for word on the books.  He might read and do math before his speech is clear, but cognitively this series is giving him the knowledge he needs and when the verbal come it will be more evident!",1452902400,10,512,4.08
7508204,5,B017NESD54,Love everything Preschool Prep.  My son has watched these videos since he was a year old when we would drive somewhere.  I started him on the letter sounds.

7508209,5,B017NESD54,"My daughter LOVES all of the Preschool Prep videos! She has out grown the Shapes, Colors and Numbers videos but watches and reads the Sight Words vidoes! She can point them out in books, on flashcards and is beginning to do so with the moveable alphabet! They have also helped with speech as she is more confident in the words and is now asking for the views by the sight word on the front cover! My daughter is five years old. For Christmas, because she enjoys these so much and because they're so educational, we purchased the math and the phonics videos! I have read some reviews where the parents don't like the videos, I would keep in mind that these are intended to capture the attention of young minds, and they do. The videos are not meant to entertain adults. They do their jobs and are a great educational resource!",1448064000,11,825,4.470198675496689

7508218,5,B017NESD54,"There are no words in the english language, great enough to describe what kind of impact these videos had on my childrenshould lives and my own. I'm a dad of twin boys who have autism. Shortly before they were diagnosed at age 2, they began preschool prep. I couldn't figure why they weren't talking or engaging. After about 3 months of watching preschool prep, they could read about 50 sight words, knew their colors and shapes. At the age of 2! By 3 they were at over 200. Then we got numbers, and now math. Everyone asks us how we have come this far with them and I always tell them that this learning system is the secret to our success. Thank you preschool prep.",1478304000,24,667,4.344

7508220,5,B017NESD54,"I like this DVDs they are very educational. Some people have said on the reviews that the videos are boring, I like them because even though it could be considered boring by some, they teach Math without much of the entertainment and distraction element where the child could get lost in. I also think this is not to expect your child to sit and watch the entire dvd without getting bored. Maybe 15 minutes, or play the Addition section first, take a break, then play the Subtraction later. If you go to their youtube channel you will see some sample videos and previews they have, and see if your child likes them or not, which really helps a lot if you have any doubts of purchasing them.",1475020800,10,690,4.440944881889764

7508223,5,B017NESD54,"We used Preschool Prep for colors, numbers, and shapes so we decided to try these dvds too. I am very impressed with them the repetition helps them learn. My 2.5 year olds are running around giving math facts and applying the to everyday situations. I feel like these give a big enough variety of ways it presents the math facts that it helps them apply them in different situations. I will be purchasing the rest of the dvds as well.",1473206400,5,434,4.4375
