After watching it twice I'd say its worth watching. But I wouldnt put this in the classic category. What I like most is the final fight where the young monk does that special buddhist style. Thats probably the most interesting style I've seen in a movie thusfar.

This movies has some interesting fights too. But I'm just going off my gut feeling here that this doesnt feel like a classic to me. Out of 4 movies I bought last week from amazon, I can say this was the best one. It wasn't as good as everyone told me though(like the other 3 movies I bought). It couldve been much better. Anyway if your a kung fu fan its definitely worth a watch just to see that last fighting style. But you won't want to keep it around long.",1218672000,,855,4.277777777777778
8215683,4,6305020027,This movie Is a classic. Two brothers pitted against each other in an end fight for the ages. The movie moves sort of slow but the action scenes make up for that. The fight with the hunchback is hilarious. A must see. Highly recommended for any collection.,1005782400,,256,4.468085106382978
