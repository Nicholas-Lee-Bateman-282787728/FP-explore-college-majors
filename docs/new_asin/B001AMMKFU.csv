8278005,3,B001AMMKFU,"Aisha Dances Volume 2 Dances of the Arab World (2006)

Produced by araf (Associated Research Arabic Folklore)
Total running time:  1 hour 2 minutes

A must have for your collection.  Sadly, since these are folkloric dances, the chances are you won't see anything like this anywhere else.

Originally recorded in 1999.  Video quality is mediocre.  Sometimes the editing is weird since she did not perform the dances the same way twice while they were recording and they insisted on mixing the camera angles anyway (see ""About the Production"" on the DVD).  I don't understand why they didn't just leave the one full view and run it through.  It bugs me to see a scarf, then it's gone, and then it's back.  The sound quality is surprisingly good considering that these are field recordings that were done in the 1960s through the 1980s.

I hate to say it but Aisha's performances seem to be lackluster.  These were done in the studio with no audience.  I am glad that these were done since most of us will never be able to see her performances anywhere else and she is so important to the bellydance world.  It's great to see these traditional dances and the costumes are fabulous.  Make sure to read about them in the ""About the Dances"" section.

The main menu is done well but the submenu to the dance selections is a little awkward.  It is done in a circle.  The way the right/left up/down buttons work are a little confusing on this screen.  Information is displayed on screen at the beginning of each dance/chapter regarding the music/dance (country of origin, name of song, musician, or which album it is featured on).

Eight Dances:
Danse du Ventre-Zanouba, Ouled Nail Dance, Tunisian-Raqs Al Khulkhal, Oriental Dance, Shikhat, Khalji, Cane Dance, Raqs Sharqi-Bahai

Extras:
About the Dances - (Read on screen format.)  This is quite lengthy and contains a lot of interesting information regarding each dance such as costuming and history. It is chaptered off by each dance but not in the same order as the dances appear on the DVD.  It would have been nice to either link the corresponding dance with the information or a picture of what she was wearing for that dance.
About the Production - (Read on screen format.)  Information on what went into making this DVD.
Preview Clips - Only a preview of this video and the previous one in the series are included.
Other Works - List of Aisha Ali's albums and videos.",1340150400,,2417,4.7272727272727275
