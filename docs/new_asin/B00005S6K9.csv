7953122,5,B00005S6K9,"I'm sure the DVD is not too bad it's 50 minutes of behind the scenes from MTV and WWE tough enough.

tough enough season 1 was a really good season it did introduce us to future Hall of Famers Maven Chris Nowinski Nidia and Josh Matthews.

I honestly never saw this I only bought this so I could trade it into Amazon for more money.

I bought 2 of them for $6.16 and I traded them in for $30.50",1362096000,,394,3.962025316455696
7953123,1,B00005S6K9,"Okay Tough Enough did start out great. It showed the in's and out's of the business. During the first and second season. But, when the third season aired. It was appauling!!!!! Just flat out horrible!!!! I don't know what was worst, Big and Al Snow acting in a unprofessional manner or the fact during the third season. They managed to cause problems for actor Kelsey Grammer. Who was living in the area at the time. I thought, the whole thing was suppose to get more people interested. Not drive them away. Don't waste your money on this.",1102982400,,539,4.56701030927835
7953124,2,B00005S6K9,"Anyone who would buy this must obviously be a fan of the show which I am. Therefore I strongly believe you won't be satisfied with what you find on this DVD. It rehashes alot of what you've already seen as well as shows you things you could care less about. First of all it includes the submission tapes of the 13 finalists, which would be okay if you don't already own the T.E boxed set which has it as well, but it also includes the submission tapes of some of the people that didn't make the cut. Why does anyone care about them? Those are not the people that we watched for 14 episodes and therefore could care less about them. After that it shows little segments about them goofing off, training, argueing, hints of romance etc. Then the last part is more rehashed material that you'll especially be disapointed in if you own the boxed set since it's in there as well. The aforementioned ""segments"" are actually quite interesting except they are entirely too short. You see some good arguements between the trainers and cast,Maven and big Chris have a heated exchange, find out that Josh didn't like Taylor, Darryl apparently had romantic links with some of the girls, big Chris dispised C.K., C.K. thought Nidia was a know-it-all and so on. All the show ever covered was that everyone disliked Darryl and big Chris. For them to only ""tease"" us with the rest of this info was pretty lame. That is the kind of ""behind the scenes"" stuff I think everyone thought that they were going to get. Before you know it the 50 minutes is up and you might be left feeling that you didn't get your moneys worth.",1018915200,8,1602,4.489726027397261
7953125,5,B00005S6K9,"I bought both the TE box (also posted a review for that) and this DVD on the same day.  I've gotta say that I liked this DVD a lot more.  It's only 50 minutes, but is well worth it.  Lots of ""backstage"" info given on the show here, with very minimal rehash from previously seen footage.  Included is footage of an argument between Maven & Chris Harvard; the story of Darryl and Paulina possibly hooking up (ugh!); and the revelation that Maven wears thongs.  Also has submission tapes from those that didn't make it (including the janitor guy), more footage of Tazz being a d! ck, and Darryl cracking his head all over the place.  In short if you want to see these guys being morons more than they were on the show (basically more Real World-like), check it out.",1016064000,,762,4.4071428571428575
7953126,2,B00005S6K9,"The DVD was more a review to me than it was a behind the scenes.  I wasn't really thrilled with it, though it did allow 'adult' language.",1015977600,2,137,4.074074074074074
