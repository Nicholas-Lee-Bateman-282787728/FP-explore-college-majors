6864095,4,B00Q89MLHW,"The goal of WATCHERS OF THE SKY is partially a history lesson, but also to shed light on a very current problem in the international community. That problem is just how difficult it is to prosecute genocide as a crime when there are so many nations with vested interests in different things that it often keeps them from agreeing on even simple things. The film also works at a visceral gut level as we are treated to actual footage from a few of the countries where genocides have taken place, like Serbia, Rwanda and Sudan. Whenever I watch films like this, people's testimony of how horrific acts were perpetrated on them and their families just makes me really emotional, and seeing footage of the perpetrators inciting people to violence turns my stomach and makes me angry. I'm pretty certain that this film will do that for a lot of people. On a technical level, I thought the documentary did a good job of moving between the different narrative threads it wanted to get across although, outside of the common theme, they didn't do the best job tying all of them together. There was also a lot of animation with onscreen text from Raphael Lemkin's (who coined the word 'genocide') diary/writings. It's not that I don't like reading, but when I'm watching a movie, even if it is a documentary, if they have that much reading they might as well have gotten a voiceover actor to do those parts. Of course, they did have some archival footage of Lemkin, but not nearly as much as they had for the other parts. Overall, it must be said that isn't some feel-good, easy watch. Genocide and mass murder are two very heavy subjects, but this film deals with them in a very mature way: laying all of the facts bare while not wallowing in misery. Ultimately, there is the hope that the global community will get this right eventually, and indeed progress has been made. If you care any small bit about humanity and how we treat one another, I highly recommend that you check this out.",1428624000,3,1980,4.596045197740113

6864097,4,B00Q89MLHW,"Genocide.

Its a word that, like the crime itself, seems always to have existed, whether it was Imperial Romes systematic killing of Christians, the 17th and 18th century French Catholic persecution of the Huguenots, or Americas attempts to eliminate the Indian problem.

But the word wasn't coined until 1944, when Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jew who lost 49 relatives in the Nazi holocaust, combined the Greek word for family or race (genos) with the Latin word for killing (cide).

Watchers of the Sky is partly about Lemkins lifelong attempts to draw attention to international crimes of genocide and to work to prevent future mass murders. But its also based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide, by Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.

Power is frequently shown on camera and in action at the U.N., while Lemkin, who died in 1959, is shown in photos and reenactment clips. Other activists are shown as well, such as Emmanuel Uwurukundo, who must be accompanied by armed guards as he goes from his residence to the three Darfur refugee camps in Chad that he oversees as a worker for the UN Refugee Agency. Also shown talking about genocide is Ben Ferencz, who was a friend of Lemkins and a prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials, and Luis Moreno Ocampo, chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, who is shown as he builds a case against Omar al-Bashir, who remains at large as President of Sudan.

Sometimes its an uncomfortable weave that threatens to unravel, even as we watch the crusaders hit roadblocks and wonder if the job is too big and prejudice too rampant. Sometimes the focus jumps from the killers to the investigators and back again. Sometimes Watchers of the Sky seems tediously slow and disjointed by so many narratives. But every good documentary enlightens you, and Watchers of the Skies certainly does that. Some viewers may not know about the Einsatzgroups that reported killing 90,000 people for Hitler between June 1941 and June 1942 alone, for example. Some of the most fascinating historical footage is of those accused of genocide, like the Serbian leader Ratka Mladic or the Sudan president Omar Hassan al-Bashir. There are segments and stretches where you find yourself so transfixed that you're prone to forgive director Edet Belzberg for tackling too much or trying to be a little too PBS in her filmmaking so that it sometimes gets in the way of the story.

Ironically, if you look at the bonus features, youll see that some terrific segments were omitted because they also would have gotten in the way of the storyor rather, the films theses. What the film emphasizes is Lemkins unflagging commitment to trying to convince the U.N. to take action against genocide, but what some of his family and friends say on camera is that he could be a pain in the ass. Here comes Lemkin U.N. delegates would say, closing their doors to hide in their offices. He could be a nuisance, one of the relatives admits. Persistent doesnt begin to describe it, another one says. Obsessed does. Fewer than 10 people attended Lemkins funeral, and his relatives say that his greatest disappointment was that the U.S. was one of the nations that did not fully sign off at the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, expressing the reservation that the nation must grant consent for any of its citizenry to go before an international court for the crime of genocidewhich, of course, is problematic if the authority in power is responsible.

Another enlightening bonus feature shows Ferencz addressing a U.N. subcommittee on genocide and taking them to task for having voted as a body to condemn genocide but debating for 10 years how to define an act of aggression that would allow the body to act. It sheds light on how deeply endemic the problem is, and how internal politics remains the United Nations worst enemy.

Watchers of the Sky clocks in at 121 minutes and would be suitable for general audiences with one caution: there are shots concentration camp bodies that may unsettle some viewers. As a work of documentary, Watchers of the Sky is average in its execution. Theres nothing here to push the genre and it won't be mistaken for one of the best examples of the form. But it does illuminate the subject matter and archival footage scattered throughout does much to compensate for a pace that sometimes drags.",1425513600,6,4439,4.862433862433862

6864099,5,B00Q89MLHW,"A DOCUMENTARY WITH GRAVITAS EQUAL TO ITS SUBJECT

[2014 Documentary Film directed by Edit Belzberg and narrated by Samantha Power.  Subject: Raphael Lemkin's efforts to create the U.N. Genocide Convention]

When most of us think back to what we were doing at age 21, few likely imagined a purpose so ambitious to affect mankind as Raphael Lemkin.  Moved by the experience of Armenians at the hands of the Ottoman, and later by the 1933 Simele Massacre of Assyrians in Iraq, Lemkin determined he would be the lawyer that would establish the international law defining the crime he himself would eventually coin as Genocide.  The son of a Jewish family from Poland, he wasn't even aware of the dark irony of what would happen to his own family just a few years later in WWII.  This story of genocide is not just a story told in black and white, of news reals now 80 years old.  It is told in color from events of recent history, with news footage that many viewers will remember seeing on TV.  Though the documentary doesn't state it specifically, it is a reminder that perhaps so far, the human capacity for our darkest crime has oddly increased with our accumulation of knowledge over the history of our race.

COVERAGE OF THE DOCUMENTARY: Though we begin with the obsession of Lemkin to create a word to define this crime, then to introduce the concept of a law to international forums, the film also explores many examples of genocide from the Armenians forward.  It touches on many events from WWII through the Balkans, Darfur and Rwanda.  We see how he presented the concept to the Legal Council of the League of Nations and was ridiculed because ""it could never happen in Europe"".  That was 1933.  I will leave the vast majority of the documentary for the viewer to discover.  But let it suffice that we see how Lemkin defines the crime with the word he devises from its Latin roots and calls it Genocide.  We see a bedraggled man relentless in his pursuit.  From a word, to a campaign at the United nations.  From resolution to convention.  All the while the documentary flips in and out of infamous events.  In addition to various news footage, there are many interviews with actual survivors of recent genocide.  The documentary also emphasizes the complication of preventing or prosecuting such crimes.

This award winning documentary has excellent production values and Samantha Powers is an able and animated narrator.  Her own experience is very appropriate.  The footage is astonishing and at times somewhat graphic (the worst is spared from the viewer though).  It was interesting to actually hear and see questioning at the Nuremberg trials in old footage.

Hopefully many are lucky enough to pass away surrounded by loved ones, knowing they contributed something positive to this world.  Lemkin passed away relatively alone, yet aware he likely changed the course of human kind.",1424736000,3,2894,4.855102040816327

8690846,5,B00Q89MLHW,"My unit deployed into Bosnia shortly after Dayton was signed.  Our base of operations was near the small town of Brcko on the Sava River.  During the course of my time there, I came to realize the horrific events which happened not only in Brcko were mass killings, rapes, burning of people in their homes..and of mass graves...but also the atrocities committed by Serbian militia and or gangs who operated rape camps near Doboj..not far from Tuzla.

Several years later in South Kordafan Province, Sudan near Darfur and later in Nuba Mountains, I witnessed the intentional genocidal actions of the Bashir government in Khartoum  in an attempt to kill everyone in the area.

The film is outstanding as historically taking the viewer through the attempts by few to categorize ""genocide"" as a term to denote crimes against the human race.  Much like the crimes committed in Germany during WWII, the early years of those who spent years trying to organize and implement the International Criminal Court (ICC) under the United Nations.

Although, much has been done..there is so much more to do.  For example, Bashir travels freely through African nations who should arrest this criminal due to the standing international arrest war by the ICC.  yet, Bashir remains free. I might add, China who is a member of the Security Council invites Bashir to China to celebrate their relationship, as China purchases 14% of Sudan's oil for export.

There has been successes..in that the court is functional and has convicted and sentenced a number of indictees, to include Ratko Maladic (Serbian commander in BiH) and several other.

To those who spend their days and nights on these issues...thank you.  For somehow, you make the world better...little by little.
