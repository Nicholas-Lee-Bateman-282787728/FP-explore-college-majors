8080555,3,B000AYEI6I,"Some people are pretty critical of these grindhouse films - not sure why. It seems the criteria should be pretty straightforward:

Are the women attractive?
Is there enough nudity? (well, female only)
Is there girl on girl action?
Film resolution quality accetable to good?
And a bonus, does the plot make sense?

The GIrl From SIN has a plot that defies explanation but that's not exactly a tragedy - the main lead looks a little like a trashy Amy Winehouse so if you wonder what she might look like as a trashy stripper of the late 1960's, here ya go. And yea, her storyline and ratio to nudity is pretty scant ... she spends a lot of time doig freaky things with her clients but mostly in a black bra and panties - along with a high-rise, black beehive hair ... the blonde they drug later spends much more time nude and again, why it makes very little sense, they spent a lot of time hauling the blonde girl nude so that's something.

The real treasure is Harry's Night In. It's plot is reminscent of plots today - dweeb has situations where gorgeous women strip off their clothes. And since it's the 1960's, they are all natural but love being nudists ... yea for us! It is wall to wall nudity - not much sex, but lots of nudity. All the women are attractive and again, unlike the p-actresses of today, don't feel the need to get all tattooed ... so highly recommended. 4 STARS for Harry, 2 for Girl From SIN.

Plus other featurettes and trailers - all in b&w but quality is good.",1202342400,15,1484,4.385454545454546
