recommend to everyone!",1398988800,,146,5.391304347826087
8401342,5,B003NWDSLA,"I purchased Season of the Bear Volume 1: American Black Bear, and the seller included, as a special, Volume 2: Black Bear Cubs. I was elated to find two for the price of one. My thanks go out to the seller! Dvds were previously viewed but were in perfect condition. They are informative and interesting. The dvds reveal facts about the black bear that not everyone would know. As one reviewer explained, these are for any age, non violent. I purchased these for my grand-nephew, who lives in Michigan. He will be five in a couple months and was curious about the bears that live in the mountains near my home. He was thrilled with these dvds. Delivery and the condition of these were just as promised.",1389312000,,701,4.52755905511811
8401343,5,B003NWDSLA,"If you are curious about the lives of black bears or if you just enjoy awe inspiring photography of wilderness and wildlife you will enjoy this DVD!  Most of us aren't fortunate to experience the opportunity of observing black bears in their natural habitats, but Kate Marshall Graphics has provided us with a rich, close-up look at this powerful, amazing animal. The DVD includes interesting and educational information about bears' physical characteristics and how they live in the four seasons of the year.  It is delightful and endearing to watch bears go about the ""bear business"" of their daily lives.  This DVD also helps to create a better understanding of bears and what we've learned about how to live in harmony with them, an area needing increased awareness as humans continue to encroach on wildlife habitat.  - A.

8401344,5,B003NWDSLA,"I could not believe the footage in this video. It was incredible to see Black Bears up close like this, in their natural habitat playing, eating, and taking naps in the trees. I'd seen still shots of bears before, usually taken at a distance, and I've seen them in movies, but nothing like this. Because of the hours of work that went into capturing them on video I was able to experience seeing the American Black Bear in a way that would never have been possible before. You won't believe how much you will learn while watching this. If you are a teacher, a parent, a nature lover, or already a bear lover, you will enjoy this video. This one would make a terrific gift for the person who has everything. The folks who made this video also have an awesome website called [...]. So much to look at there!",1274918400,3,805,4.373333333333333
