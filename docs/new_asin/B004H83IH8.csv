The movie seems to have an intricate suspenseful plot but instead we get an over-complicated confusing mess that has too many damn characters and not enough substance.  When you're a B-Movie, you just can't replicate BOURNE IDENTITY guys!!!  Success in these type of films is simplicity and non-stop action.  The action sequences are good but at times rely on close-ups, fast-cuts and dark backgrounds which hinder the viewer from enjoying the full action scene. Even with all these shortcomings the movie is ACTION-PACKED with a mish-mash of hot butt-kicking ladies and cool characters.  Overall, the movie is worth a rental especially if you're a sucker(like me!)for girls with guns and automatic weapon firing ninjas!!!",1301616000,4,801,5.2265625
4375492,2,B004H83IH8,"I love foreign action films. I take chances on films I don't know about in the hopes I find a hidden diamond. This one turned out to be just coal. Artwork looks pretty, with the tag line ""From the studio who brought you Ong Bak and blah blah blah""...

This movie was not like any of those 3 stated in the tag. Acting was bad. Characters were stiff while delivering lines, overacting while shooting (recoil of weapons), and like the previous reviewer you never know who is who until an hour in which adds to the poor character development.

That aside, the action scenes are ok, not great. Modern day ninjas (with machine guns) drop after a kick. Book beats gun every time. Didn't know grabbing a fire extinguisher could go unnoticed but alas I guess its possible.

Movie was overall dark, lighting seemingly coming out of nowhere in the middle of the woods. Logical progressions in storyline are absent.

Not worth buying. Rent it, or you can have mine.",1301097600,8,953,4.588235294117647
4375493,1,B004H83IH8,"I want you to know that I really tried to watch the free 2:12 minutes of this movie, but to be honest; I had to fast forward three times. I wish that they would let the Internet community see who actually pays for this and give a prize or a free bowl of soup to whom ever can watch the entire thing without touching the fast forward button.

4375494,2,B004H83IH8,"While working for CIA, a female special agent code-named ""Gunja"" (Sophita Sribanchean) is betrayed and nearly killed by ""Claire"" (Jackie Apithananon), hardened officer in charge of the division ""Gunja"" belongs to. ""Gunja"" enlists an unexpected help from another agent Sirin (Kessarin Ektawatkul) before she comes back to ""Claire"" for revenge. Well, the story sounds pretty good.

Actually, the script of the B action movie is awfully confusing with too many characters. There are CIA operatives, terrorists, and even Japanese assassins, and I simply couldn't understand who is fighting who. But you know, this is an action film, and what really matters is action. Also, the DVD artwork looks nice.

To be fair, actions are OK, if not special, and the film shows some style during the fight scenes. The best part of ""Vanquisher"" is, not surprisingly, three female agents in tight black costumes and their fights. (The original Thai title is ""Suay Samurai"" meaning ""Beautiful Samurai."") Kessarin Ektawatkul, former national champion in taekwondo, is the most convincing of the three as a deadly martial arts fighter. (She was previously seen in two Thai films ""Born to Fight"" and ""Chai lai Angels."")

Despite this, most action scenes are badly choreographed and the lighting is inadequate, so even the most brilliant stunt is ruined as a result. The concept of battling heroines in sexy clothes is not bad, but for the idea to succeed, we need better choreography and a more coherent story.",1299888000,16,1488,5.16597510373444

8429366,1,B004H83IH8,"You have to be ready to accept certain, and many, flaws when going into a budget action flick. The acting's going to be terrible, the characters stiff and underdeveloped, the story will be cliche at best, but you will at least have action. It's just a matter of hitting the right ratio between sub-par everything else and decent action.

Vanquisher fails to hit that ratio. The story is about a CIA agent going after a terrorist and then there's a good cop who was previously betrayed by the CIA and then there's some terrorist buddies and then there's some Japanese mercenaries and then there's so many damn characters in this movie with a plot that can barely support three characters that I just tried desperately to keep track of who was good and who was bad when I was watching them fight.

Which wasn't exactly easy either. The action was shot very badly, and a lot of times with all the characters wearing tight black suits I had no idea who was throwing or taking the punches. The last fifteen minutes picked it up and delivered some passable action, but I had to sit through the most confusing aborted storyline to get to that. And it was topped off with a character I JUST saw get knocked out in one room run in from a different room in the very next scene!

The actin was notoriously bad too. I can deal with bad acting for the sake of the action, however, it seems that, for some oddball reason, we have non-English speakers reciting their lines phonetically in English. Either that, or they truly are the most abhorrently bad actors I have ever seen in any film ever. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, though, and laying the blame on the director for not just letting them speak Thai. They would still be bad actors, but since I don't speak Thai I would have been spared the full force of their awfulness.

If you can sit through a turd for fifteen minutes of near-decent low budget action, go right ahead. I wouldn't recommend it.",1378857600,,1952,4.490140845070423

8429369,1,B004H83IH8,"The packaging looks good but the story is a mess.  Totally incoherent not to mention bad acting, bad photography, and a very poor script.  The director wanted to make this movie into something it is not.  In more capable hands it would have succeeded but this movie is something else.

The plot is simple as previous reviewers have said, a Thai recruited CIA agent (Sophita Sriban) went on a mission in Thailand and was abandoned after the mission did not go as planned or did it (I got really confused throughout the movie).  She escaped and later became a Lieutenant in the Thai Police Force.  Through ludicrous circumstances 2 years later she met Claire (the CIA operative in charge of the mission she undertook that betrayed her) again who once again tried to kill her. The ""vengeance"" part of the movie so blatantly advertised in the dvd cover is misleading as Sophita never actually went looking for Claire; instead she becomes hunted after inadvertently (unknowingly) harboring the Al Qaeda operative (Wajib) Claire and her goons were after escaped into her apartment and a big fight ensues.

There is also the subplot of Claire setting up the Al Qaeda operative to be the fall guy blowing up Bangkok so that the CIA would have an excuse to go in and exterminate him and his people, etc. You get the picture. And then the director throws in some Japanese assassins wearing ninja suits with samurai swords in the mix to spice things up a bit.  Nothing makes any sense except to watch two attractive girls, the lead (Sophita) and Kessarin Ektawatkul in tight tank tops fighting the bad guys in hand-to-hand combat and using samurai swords.  Even that failed as the lighting was too dim and the cinematography ineptly done and choreography poorly executed.

Rent this if you have nothing else to watch...",1304812800,2,1808,4.784565916398714
