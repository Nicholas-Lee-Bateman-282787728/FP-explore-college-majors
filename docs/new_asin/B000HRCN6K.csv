2640122,3,B000HRCN6K,"All in all not a bad movie to watch given it was made in 1950.  The beginning has a great film-noir style setup with dark themes and scenes.  But then actor Ronald Reagan enters as a wannabe tough guy in the role of detective/prosecutor and the hitchcock type magic is lost.  It was like watching a mediocre magician's act, where you know the outcome of the trick but you watch anyway hoping this time the magician surprises you with a new twist on the outcome.

Good acting by Ginger Rogers probably saved this movie from being a complete flop.  Though the movie attempted to expose and belittle the white supremacist ku klux klan organization and its hold on a small town, the main focus was on Rogers as a concerned sister reluctant to indict her sister's husband (a klan member) for a crime she witnessed him commit. Yes, its a crime detective story where you know who did it and why before the detective does.

This movie might've been ahead of its time in dealing with a serious american terrorist issue, but by depicting the root of this klan klavern as a few crazed and corrupt individuals, it gives the dangerously misleading perception of civic and community innocence when it came to klan activity.  But give hollywood credit, their history of pulling a rabbit out of a hat and convincing viewers that its real has stood the test of time.

""Storm Warning"" would've made a better book.  I'm currently reading ""Blood Justice"" by Howard Smead. Its the true story of the 1959 Lynching of Mack CHarles Parker in Mississippi. It doesn't appear there will be any rabbit popping out of a hat in this tell all book.  Real mob justice engulfs with rage and fear the entire town it proposes to protect and defend.",1311465600,2,1713,4.605263157894737
2640123,5,B000HRCN6K,"When first released in 1950, this film was hailed as a first-rate thriller. Six decades later it still holds up as a raw-edged expose' of the Klu Klux Klan and their terrorising of a small town.  The performances of Ginger Rogers,Ronald Reagan, Doris Day ( in a serious non-singing role) and Steve Cochran are certainly the best of their careers.

The story concerns a fashion model (Rogers) who visits the small town where her younger sister (Day) lives with her new husband (Cochran).  On arriving she witnesses a killing by the Klu Klux Klan, two of whom remove their hoods and she sees their faces.  Later she discovers that one of the men is her sister's husband.  Her first instinct is to report him to the local police but rather than spoil her sister's happiness, she decides to leave town.  It is at this point that the local District Attorney (Reagan) convinces her that she should testify as a witness to the brutal murder. But once on the witness stand, she again changes her mind and her sister's moronic husband walks free.  What happens after that leads to a most suspenseful climax to what remains a truly thrilling film. Highly recommended.",1310515200,37,1157,4.72636815920398
2640124,4,B000HRCN6K,"This film began with a noir edge, that lost ground with the appearance of Ronald Reagan, playing his usual taciturn self. It was Ginger Rogers and Steve Cochran that kept my attention and interest, as they flashed anger combined with an undercurrent of lust at each other. Doris Day, in a non singing role was fine as the younger sister and wife. But things really only sparked when Steve and Ginger were on the screen. Steve, as a none too bright young husband and Klan member, lived up to Ginger's words in her bio re ""Storm Center"". ""When I iirst heard Steve Cochran read his part, ""I knew he would steal the film from the rest of us."" According to Louella Parsons, they carried the sizzle over into their private lives. I gave it a 4 for being so graphic and tackling the KKK issue for that time period.",1239321600,14,807,4.422818791946309

2640128,5,B000HRCN6K,"I just finished watching ""Storm Warning"". Let me tell you that it is a great movie. I haven't seen many old moveis (only the original ""Dracula"") but I fell in love with this one. I am now an old movie fan.

I origionaly got this because of Ronald Reagan, and he gives a great preformance, but the real magic is behind this allstar suppoeting cast. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I suggest this to anyone and everyone. It speaks of the American ""untouchables"": the Klan. I think it was well done. Bravo!!!",1172966400,34,523,4.336734693877551
2640129,4,B000HRCN6K,"I watched Storm Warning a couple of weeks ago and really enjoyed the film.  The film is about a Klan murder which is witnessed by the ""outsider"" sister who is in town to visit her sister (Doris Day).  Ginger Rogers witnesses a murder which is carried out by the brother in law she is soon to meet (Steve Cochran).

The film is obviously about the Ku Klux Klan and it supposedly takes place in the American South, although apparently nobody has a southern accent, which is I guess better than the amusingly fake southern accents that comes out of Hollywood now.  I didn't realize Ginger Rogers was such a quality actress, she did a fine job in this film.  I guess I always thought of her in those more corny roles where she dances with Dean Martin or Fred Astaire, whoever it was.

Ronald Reagan plays the county or town prosecuting attorney and the best scene comes right at the end when shows up at a huge klan rally and delivers this quote after being threatened with a firearm and some kind of official sounding diatribe, ""Don't give me that Halioween Routine.""  It's funny how he recognizes everybody in the klan, and they all scatter when Reagan gets tough, just like the communists did.  It's a prophetic scene because I imagined him with all those Soviet officials and Gorbachev during all the Arms negotiations/talks.

Anyways I thought Storm Warning was going to be kind of corny, but it's a pretty good film, with very good acting.  Ginger Rogers definitely was the star, her eyes are beautiul.  I would like to see more of her films.",1158105600,24,1544,4.578181818181818
2640130,4,B000HRCN6K,"This film is a time capsule curio for sure.  You can say it's part noir, part diatribe, and part ""Dragnet"".  This stylistic hodge-podge kind of undercuts the film's anti-Klan message but it doesn't fail to entertain you.  If for anything else see the film for a dynamic turn by Ronald Reagan as a crusading D.A.  His towering presence brought to my mind the charisma when he was President.  Close your eyes during the scenes when he's conducting an inquest into the murder of an investigative reporter or when he confronts the Grand Wizard of the Klan.  You can almost imagine him telling Mr. Gorbachev to tear down that wall.  The film is also helped by terrific performances by Ginger Rogers and Doris Day(two other underrated actors) and particularly Steve Cochran as Day's dopey Klansman husband.",1156896000,11,800,4.881481481481481

This was a truly groundbreaking film in 1951, tackling the evils of the KKK, with strong performances from Ginger Rogers, Doris Day and Steve Cochran. Ronald Reagan is wooden as usual, and the role certainly should have been given to a stronger actor.

Never thought I would see a film with Doris Day that left me short of breath at the finale.
Don't want to spoil the impact for readers but this is a haunting movie from start to finish.
The story is oddly almost a replay of STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE. The setup is identical but it is
even more powerful. The cast is excellent with Ginger Rogers and Doris Day playing sisters, one who lives in a town run by the K.K. Clan.
Warners had a lot of guts doing this film. It was about the same time 20th released a brilliant film which also had limited release due to it's

Steve Cochran is dynamite as a violent but cowardly KKK heavy. Ginger Rogers gives a riveting performance as the gutsy eyewitness to a murder. Reagan is good as a Southern prosecutor. Even Doris Day is perfect as the innocent wife of a KKK thug.

2640147,5,B000HRCN6K,"As a hard core Gingerologist, I must admit to being more than a little biased about anything done by Miss Rogers, but this film does rank as one of her best performances in my opinion.  The violence and subject matter in Storm Warning is depicted fairly graphically for 1951, and it definitely keeps you riveted.  The movie was filmed in Corona, CA and it definitely looks like it.  The KKK evidently had quite a strong presence right outside Los Angeles.  There is no attempt to even pretend that it's the Deep South.  This KKK goes after ""outsiders"" of no particular race or ethnicity.  Doris Day is perfect casting as Ginger's younger sister, although I found her to be kind of a dim bulb character.  Reagan is Reagan...always the same performance from him.  Ginger Rogers and Steve Cochran bring it in a big way though.  He's so sleazy and despicable its unbelievable.  A certain sexual chemistry exists between he and Miss Rogers that is unmistakable even though he's such a loathsome character.  Anyway...Storm Warning - see it!",1452729600,2,1034,4.818181818181818

It's a very good movie and I won't give away the plotline but it's impossible not to root for Ginger Rogers and Doris Day's characters only to see them both get hurt in the ending.  Doris Day was a huge fan of Ginger Rogers prior to being in this movie.  Both of the female actress are excellent in this black and white film, which also stars future president Ronald Reagan, who also starred with Doris Day in ""The Winning Team"".

I don't know of many movies involving storylines about the Ku Klux Klan, but this film definitely gets the point across that the Klan was definitely in the wrong with the murders and hurtful acts they did.

I do recommend for Doris Day fans, such as myself.",1412121600,,799,4.264900662251655
2640165,3,B000HRCN6K,"This is such a strange movie. When it began, I thought it was going to be one of those rare Ronald Reagan movies where he gets a lead part with a really good script.  It started very film noir-ish, black and white, atmospheric/creepy when Ginger Rodgers arrives in a small town where men seem quite unfriendly even though she's a blonde fashion model and traveling alone, trying to visit her sister.

It is very well directed and filmed and Ginger Rodgers' acting throughout is excellent. She's the star, and she makes it work no matter what she's being asked to do. I like the way she played her character--very strong.  As she's walking 10 blocks, at night in this creepy town she sees a group of KKK taking a man from the jail and shoot him. She hides, but he dies not too far from her and some of the men take off their hoods.

She gets to her sister (Doris Day--also very good in an unglamorous, non-singing supporting role) and tells her what she saw. When the sister's husband (Steve Cochran) comes home, Day tells him all about it only--he's one of the KKK she saw. He's a dumb guy--goes and tells the leader, a local businessman, his sister in law knows but is ""leaving town"".

Meanwhile, the DA (Ronald Reagan) is trying to solve the murder. He figures out the KKK did it, but no one is willing to talk. Will Ginger? Will the KKK kill her, the husband or even the DA?  Will justice be done?

re: Reagan.  I admit after seeing Ronald Reagan in politics for two decades, first as Governor, then as President, I'm fascinated by watching him act. He's generally very good here as a mild-mannered, low-key ""nice guy"" DA (except for the scene where he's smiling pleasantly while his assistant tells him why he once joined the Klan. And although we know it's really BAD, his reasons are kind of like you might have had when you decided to join the local Rotary club and Reagan smiles through it all with kind of a ""Fancy that!"" attitude that probably was the director's choice for this odd script, but...still weird when you think about the real KKK and what it was and did.)

Reagan has a good voice, doesn't ham it up, and his face conveys lots of different emotions at the right time. He moves well through his scenes and is interesting to watch. So I'm always intrigued by ""what's missing?"" as an actor because it's something and I don't know what. You know he's acting, even though he's not too mannered. But something just doesn't feel the same as if it were, say, William Holden who seems a similar type and had less training than Reagan, but is somehow different on camera--somehow Holden's a better actor and I think it would show here, too. I just can't figure out what Reagan isn't doing/doesn't have that bigger stars did.

Anyway, acting-wise, it's Ginger Rodgers who's the star really and she couldn't be better. What -could- be better is the script. While I liked the idea of a movie bold enough to criticize the Ku Klux Klan, here, all it is is basically your local crime syndicate. There is nothing--zero--about their racial and religious hatred. There are no minorities in this town and the men who have joined seem to be trying to get ahead financially by joining. Reagan even talks about how corrupt the KKK is ""with all the dues and fraudulent bookkeeping"" and one of the men thinks they'll get charged with tax evasion some day.

Except for being dressed in hoods and robes, this could have been a local crime syndicate in small town USA. There is NOTHING that tells you what the Klan stands for. (And toward the end, it just gets more ridiculous as they throw in a little ""Streetcar Named Desire"" scene and then later burn a cross and almost seem ready to use Ginger as a human sacrifice. Bizarre.)

So in spite of the good acting and direction, the script just fell apart and the ""history part""--the Klan--was so watered down that I thought it actually wound up putting a positive spin on the KKK (relative to what the Klan really was)--i,e, these guys aren't so bad, just corrupted by money and greed.

I'd recommend it if you like any of the actors, and don't mind over-the-top melodramatics for half of it, but if you're at all interested in history, this isn't at all about the Ku Klux Klan and should probably be avoided.",1406419200,,4253,4.529335071707953

Doing the right thing isn't always easy and can be very costly.,1376006400,,341,4.796610169491525
2640179,5,B000HRCN6K,I was so very pleased and surprised at how quickly this product arrived.  It was in perfect shape from the outer cover to the actual disc.  The actual movie is fantastic.  Any old movie buff would be very excited about this one.  Thank you so much.  I will order again.,1369008000,,269,4.3
2640180,5,B000HRCN6K,"As cinema, the strength of this film is the acting of Ginger Rogers and Doris Day. Being as he went on to become President, I'll say that Ronald Reagan, while delivering a fine performance, did not much adapt his ""All American"" persona to the setting of this movie. As social commentary, the film represents an attempt by Hollywood to portray the Klan as a terrorist organization with respect to whites as well as blacks, and tap into the country's desire at mid century to address a grave social wrong.",1368662400,3,503,4.662921348314606
2640181,5,B000HRCN6K,"An impressive dramatic film. And I must say each of its stars - Ginger Rogers, Ronald Reagan, Doris Day and Steve Cochran - give very strong performances. Hugh Sanders is impressive, as well.",1364428800,8,191,4.818181818181818

2640184,2,B000HRCN6K,"It may be that this project once had something significant to say, and that the something was squeezed out in the process of revision, a process of figuring out how to avoid offending potential moviegoers. The target is the Ku Klux Klan, which has just killed a reporter who had ferreted out their secrets.

What were those secrets? Plans to exclude African American votes from the elections? Assaults on uppity darkies who sat at white-reserved lunch counters? Lynching of blacks who'd ogled white women?

Er, no. The big secret was that the leaders of the Klan enjoyed a wide profit margin in the sale of those white-sheet uniforms.

The makers of the movie wanted to have it both ways. They attacked a target which it was politically correct to attack, but then they had a hard time figuring why it should be attacked. Because it persecuted blacks? But the potential audience might not much like blacks, or Jews, or any of the other real-life victims of the Klan. So the word ""negro"" is never used. I think I briefly glanced one black man in a crowd scene. Otherwise, for the purposes of this movie, black people didn't exist. The Klan members weren't the only racists.",1360368000,2,1172,4.7073170731707314
2640185,5,B000HRCN6K,"A film made in 1951 that depicts the Klu Klux Klan as garden-barrel Fascists or small-town goons who keep the streets safe for women walking the streets at night,neither mentioning its racism or religious bigotry,has punches pulled. Also it's presented as the cover-up of a murder,whose victim is a nosy reporter,rather than a black man. Crime is presented as film noir in the stunning cinematography,the atmospheric opening,the shadowy streets with shops shutting down and lights going off,as if the small town is going to be attacked by zombies or aliens from space. Richard Brooks who co-wrote had penned the book on which film Crossfire(attack on anti-semitism)was based. Stuart Heisler has never directed better in transforming this rural southern town.

Marsha Mitchell(Ginger Rogers)gets off the bus to visit her newly wed sister,Lucy(Doris Day),but witnesses a murder of a man by the KKK,two of whom reveal their faces. She recognizes her sister's brutish new husband,Hank Rice(Steve Cochran).She is questioned by the DA Burt Rainey(Ronald Reagan).She admits it was the Klan but retracts this later to protect her sister. Although this may be Reagan's best role,he is too bland,amiable and shallowly conceived. Rogers is superbly understated,ably conveying inner turmoil convincingly. Rogers and Day are believable as sisters, with Day acting the anger,hurt,vulnerability in her 1st non-singing role. The film has a Streetcar Named Desire(also 1951) dynamic,with Cochran's mix of hang-dog charm and sleazy good looks closer to Elvis than Brando,the lout between two wily blonde women. The seedy town is fantastically captured,its bus station, the jailhouse,the bowling alley,the courthouse,the crowd scenes,the love nest. In conservative times(McCarthy)a brave issues film.",1358640000,2,1781,5.695488721804511

2640191,5,B000HRCN6K,"I first saw MOST of this film in high school.  I say ""most"" because I recorded if from TV, and the film ran over a couple minutes so I didn't get to see the final few minutes until several years later when it was rerun.  It was hell waiting.  VERY suspenseful ending with some great performances, writing, and cinematography.  Needless to say, I am SOOOOO glad to have this on DVD.  It is a great film noir....ahead of its time in dealing with the consequences of consequences of extreme racism.  Ginger Rogers and Steve Cochran give excellent performances.  Steve Cochran was definitely an underrated performer, and although he plays a horrible character in this film, he does a wonderful job.  Doris Day and Ronald Reagan are adequate in their performances, although frankly, Reagan's performance is actually pretty dull compared Steve and Ginger.  Still, good job all around, and definitely worth a watch or more.",1311638400,2,916,4.896103896103896
