2819162,4,B000PGTNDO,The show is good although it rarely shows anything paranormal like Ghost Hunters does. The anticipation level is very high with expectation for seeing something always there. Plus the use of mediums present an interesting sidenote for the authenticity of the locations. I just hope the annoying beeping out of the profanity that is all over the Travel Channel broadcast is absent from the DVDs. I would ignore the profanity to see what's being covered up by the beeping.,1180396800,10,470,4.962025316455696
2819173,3,B000PGTNDO,"This is one of the first, and the best of the Ghost Hunting Reality Shows. And its pretty good. Not at the same level as Ghost Adv, or Paranormal State, but not to far off. The only downside is the horrible physic. Derek Acorah. I don't believe in physics, but if they were real this guy would be the worse. If you listen to him for 30 seconds, you would know he's a fake. The worse part about it is, he won't shut up. He does most of the talking, and it ruins the show. Him and his imaginary friend, that he talks to off and on. There are several times something creepy happens, and he looks more puzzled then anyone else. But during the few times he's not talking, and Yvette and crew are investigating. Its very interesting. If you're a hardcore paranormal fan, I'd say its a good one to have in your collection. Otherwise, I'd rent it.",1352246400,3,839,4.25
2819174,4,B000PGTNDO,"Love the show, but I'd boycott it in a second if I found out that Koch Vision is a subsidiary of Koch Industries.  Does anyone know for sure?",1317772800,,141,4.035714285714286
2819175,5,B000PGTNDO,This show is not for the faint at heart. If you like the paranormal it is for you. If you like surprises it isfor you. If you think it is not real. Don't bother. It is a real awesome show.,1296000000,,188,3.725

2819177,5,B000PGTNDO,I spent my spring break watching. I couldn't get enough. When will they produce another collection?,1238112000,,99,5.25
2819178,5,B000PGTNDO,"Most Haunted: The Collection is British show directed and produced by Karl Beattie and executive produced and hosted by Karl's wife (and actress),Yvette Fielding.

Within a 24 hour period, they go into haunted inns, castles, and other places in the UK, to seek info on people who have died in the past (good and evil); to do seances to contact the dead; and to seek scientific explainations about the phenomena.

With the help of paranormal expert Richard Felix; Scottish spriritualist/medium Derek Acorah; and crew member Cath (who does the make-up in the early episodes), since the show was made back in 2003, Most Haunted is scary, fun, and I recommend it.

Note: Most Haunted isn't on DVD in Australia. If you've got a multi-region player at home, you can watch this show.

2819179,5,B000PGTNDO,"Well i happen to love this show for some reason..who knows why?!? but if you love th show like i do, you'll love revisiting these places. I have one minor complaint...the way the DVD is set up, when you play the shows in their entirety it stops for commercial breaks...now there are no commercials on the DVD but they put in like these strange intermission breaks?!?!? odd, maybe its a British thing? but like I said its only a minor annoyance. Otherwise the collection is great!",1215388800,,479,4.5813953488372094
2819180,4,B000PGTNDO,"I much prefer the later seasons with David Wells but I'm a Brit who misses the atmosphere/age of everything, living in U.S.A since 1989 so it's a way of recharging my own batteries. Wonderful sites, the feel of the places - great. Remember that these are from the very early days of Most Haunted and things seem to run smoother in the later seasons.",1214956800,,349,4.46875
2819181,5,B000PGTNDO,"Best approched with an open mind, Most Haunted is more of a psycological foray into the afterlife that a physical one. This set, from the seasons 2 and 3 , is a very entertaining, amusing, and at times, scary ride. Most people believe this is the first two seasons, and the packge claims it is season one and two, but these episodes are from season two and three. Most Haunted's first year was in 24 minute episodes. The first year had a different parapsycologist named Jason Karl, and a different make up girl with black frilly hair that screamed at everything and ran faster than Yvette ever did.

Do they catch stuff? Yes, just not as often as the other ghost hunting shows. But, MH spends more time building the history of the place in investigation than any of the other ghost hunting shows. They are also up front with what they find, saying that because they didn't have enough cameras the world won't accept the evidence, but here it is: you decide.
Most Haunted has caught EVP [a baby crying} , orbs galore, knocking, foot steps, etc. all included here.

  Each memeber of the team brings something different to the table. Yvette Fielding is a great host, speaking clearly and precise, explaining the history of the investigation. But when things get going, she freaks, and sometimes it is quite funny. For example, Yvette and her paranormal investigator Phil Wyman were investigating some rooms in the castle where Mary Queen Of Scots was held several times. As the night progresses, thier fear grows, and when a scratching begins at a window, they both freak and shove each other in a desparate bid to escape the room. Her freak out moments are legendary, and as we learn in the extras from the historian of the group, they now lable anyone's freak out moments a ""Yvette"". Even Phil Wyman warns Yvette, ""Don't you start, because when you do, you set me off, too"" First clue she's scared: her hand goes right to her mouth and she wimpers.

In this set, Yvette bring medium Derek Accorah to the investigations. He is not told of where he is going, or of any history of the places to be investigated. As he reveals his readings in a dramatic, engrossing way, we are informed by foot notes if history can back up who he claims to see or speak to, and if what he says is accurate. Mostly he is right on the mark, but Most Haunted is not afraid to show you proof if he is correct or incorrect. To me, this makes what transpires believable. This also gives it two angles to think about. Is what Derek saying totally true? Is what he coveys from his spirit guide garbled and sometimes causes misinformation? Or is Derek trying to pass off his tales as ""readings"" but has secretly researched a little before the actual investigation? In later season not included here, Derek was discovered to have faked a few readings and was removed from the show. But, you cannot discount the times he was bang on accurate on a few things. And It's all evident here just how accurate he could be. My opinion? I think Derek is a psychic, but fell under the influence of star power and the pressure to find eveidence...he just got stupid.

I also like the historian Richard. At first I wasn't sure, but his speaches on history are very interesting. In one scene, the crew are chasing noises through a castle, and he seems sort of confused as to what is happening, even perplexed, and then he seems genuinely afraid when Yvette and the sound man see feet under a door. When ghostly happenings begin, he gets bewildered and lost in the shuffle. Richard usually seems baffled by the noises, and unsure what to do next.

Karl, Yvette's husband, is always cool and collected...and here you can hear all the language without many beeps at all.

Cath, the hairdresser/ investigator is just adorable. She has a child like quality about her and it actually makes you feel sorry for her when she is terrified. Poor thing.

Some of the members are afraid of their own shadows, which add another dimension to the spooky goings on. One of the girls screams at a coffee pot light when it blinks, she is so on edge.

Showing so many different members and how they react to the ghostly going on enhances the believability. Some of the members you grow to learn they are over reacting and think everything is caused by a ghost, then others want to find out what the cause is and prove it to be a ghost or some other cause.

A few episodes stand out over the others. My favorite ""Clerkenwell House Of Detention"" is the scariest of them. Derek does an excellent, chilling acount of who the spirits are there at the time, and echoes the suffering that took place there. He has a way of making the dead seem real with his words.

One thing I really think is wonderful, is that Most Haunted knows when to play music, and when not to. Mostly, the music is in the introductory segment of the show, when Yvette and Richard are explaining the history and activities of the location. Then throughout, when needed, but not interrupting the noises of the spirits. When Yvette and the crew are in the location actually hunting, there isn't music...so you hear along with them, the sounds. Ghost Hunters, and Ghost Hunters International tend to over use music, and play it during the actual investigations and tend to drown out the important sounds.

In my opinion, this set is worth the money. They do caputure spooky things, mostly orbs and sounds, and not as often as thier American conterparts ""Ghost Hunters"", but the history and presentation seems richer. Please don't misunderstand me...I like both shows  equally, but for different reasons. ""Ghost Hunters"" for the actual proof, and ""Most Haunted"" for the history.

Alot of Americans do not realize that the show is in it's 10th season in Britain. I have purchased, in PAL format, seasons 4, 5, 6 and part of 7.
Part 4 is very good. In one story at the Jamaica Hotel, the team sit in a room and Yvette acidentally points the camera at a mirror...and picks up a murky image of a woman...and the medium on board Ian helps her pass into the light as her image fades in the mirror. A truly surreal moment in Most Haunted history. Each season has scares.

Alot of people scoff at Most Haunted. At times, it does seem a little over dramatic...but the underlying pulse is that they are trying to find truth in hauntings, and I feel do succeed. In later series 6, Derek's stories seemed to get wilder and unbelieveable, and Cirian O'keefe would comment and present in fact wether Derek's claims were true or unfounded.
That to me is important if you want to find truth in the hereafter. And it takes guts for a show to present to it's audience if the psychic was accurate or not, rather than try to get you to believe it all. At one point in series 6, Yvette took Derek and psychic David Wells to locations separately, and compared thier findings to each other's and to factual evidence, and then presented it to the viewing audience as to which one was accurate. That's guts!",1210118400,5,6981,4.563897763578275
2819182,4,B000PGTNDO,"I love Most Haunted, and I wish that Antix/Living TV would release more DVDs formated for the US/Canada. They are in the 10th season in England but only some of the episodes from their earlier seasons are on this set. I love what Most Haunted does and the history about the locations is great. Whether they catch ghostly activity or not is hit and miss as one might expect it to be with only 24hours at each site. Some of the episodes are not very exciting while others are great. I am not as impressed with the Medium on these episodes. He is a bit over dramatic for my taste. All in all I find it very enjoyable and hope that they release more episodes.",1208131200,,655,4.248
2819193,5,B000PGTNDO,I have to admit that I am a fan of any kind of paranormal based TV. Most Haunted is the most entertaining of them all. These Brits get so into it and are great entertainment when they freak out! These are earlier episodes that I missed when they first ran so it is well worth the money to see how it all started and how the show and cast have progressed. I wish they would release the following seasons. Whether you believe in the paranormal or not you still might find yourself wondering what is exaggerated and what might be closer to reality. Overall this is good entertainment and you get to see some of the beauty of the places they visit!,1203292800,9,644,4.286885245901639
2819194,1,B000PGTNDO,"Ladies and gentlemen - here it is - the most preposterous program in television history. The televised equivalent of a ""medium"" rapping under a desk - and making you believe it's your dead aunt saying hello.  And the most galling thing about it? That in the year 2007 it's actually being made.

Now, first of all - The Curmudgeon would like to see genuine proof of ghosts. I am not a sceptic by any stretch of the imagination; ghosts, aliens, Bigfoot - put it this way, I share the sentiments of the poster hanging in Fox Mulder's office.

So yes, I WANT to believe - but that's not to say I believe every piece of ""ghostly"" footage put in front of me; to see every creak and knock as genuine evidence of the spirit world, and especially not to believe a single word that comes out of shameless liar and ""medium"" Derek Acorah. Long ago proven to be a complete and utter charlatan, the gall of this man really does need to be seen to be believed.

And ""believe"" is what Most Haunted really does want you to do; hence the ""spooky"" green camera that makes the cast look like sparkle-eyed ghouls, the shaky camera work and the sinister music. In short - they could film the inside of a McDonald's restaurant and make it look creepy. Well, creepier.

That I'm reviewing a COLLECTION of this program is beyond depressing. An entire boxset devoted to NOTHING - hours upon hours of boom-holding fools jumping because they ""felt something"", of gullible, easily fooled people tricked into feeling presences and lie after lie and laughable ""possessions"" from professional con-man Acorah - a series of nothing but ""take our word for it"" television. Where the ""Most Haunted places in the world"" have seemingly the most camera-shy ghosts.

A jaw-droppingly arrogant program is Most Haunted; bare-faced fraud and mild hysteria presented as fact, exploiting and degrading an otherwise fascinating and genuine school of research.

I would finish with ""don't be fooled"" but unless you count endless episodes of breathless idiots asking ""Oh! What was that?"" as proof positive of the paranormal, there really isn't any danger of that.

They're liars, cheats and the entire show is a sham.  They should all be Most Wanted.

2819195,1,B000PGTNDO,"I was an avid viewer of this show since its inception on American television. Apart from the great locations, I really was mesmerized by the ""readings"" of Derek Acorah.  Much to my chagrin, I have now discovered that Acorah has been discredited based upon fake readings and has been dropped from the show.  Based upon that, I would caution potential buyers of this product to stay away if they are expecting anything more than theatrics,bumps, bangs, screams and bleeped out profanity. Acorah was the core of the show and there really is little left to enjoy now that he's been discredited.

If nothing else, MH and GH are good observations into how people act in darkened rooms; the imagination may be the ""most haunted"" thing about both programs.

While Most Haunted has been accused of fakery by critics and the GH team, Ghost Hunters should be cautious not to draw more attention to some of their ""findings."" While Derek Acorah was removed from MH for faking readings, more and more critics and viewers are looking at the results obtained by our two beloved plumbers.
