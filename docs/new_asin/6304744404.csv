Makes me want to see his other films.  If you love this movie, get the soundtrack and the novel.  That said, I  DO have some objections:  1. Cooper's flippant, profanity-laced dialogue is jarring and out of place.  2. Smoking on a spaceship?  In 2047?  3. Like Cooper's dialogue,  the coarse, closing song (?) doesn't match the deep mood of this film.  I  hope someday the missing footage is recovered!",1518220800,,577,5.130434782608695

916624,3,6304744404,"It was the typical sin of Hollywood of the 90's - great beginning and the middle (little worse), then a very shitty ending. This movie, unfortunately, was no different. Fist, the idea is more than brilliant - a thoughtful producer would have taken it to its apex, probably ending up in a cult movie like Blade Runner or Matrix. But, sadly, it happened to be a typical Hollywood producer disease of those days (and there are still some like that today)... which means: the 2/3rd of the movie is given to the director and he makes something so good that it whacks you out of your chair (all of it: directory, screenplay, cinematography, acting, all the ideas) - there is really not much that I would tell be different that the best movies of those days there. However, then we come to the last 1/3rd and you can tell that the producer became more and more ignorant and tired of the narrative (too complicated for a simple soda/pop brain) and then the director/script were pushed into a crappy set of cliches and templates so overabundant in those days. Too stupid, too gory and too simple. Phenomenal movie with very badly made and stupid ending...

916748,4,6304744404,"A triumph of production design and suspense, ""Event Horizon"" ended up being butchered during the editing phase with numerous scenes expanding on what the crew experienced in the film cut. Unfortunately  all of that footage is lost although video survives of the some of the sequences but they can't be reintegrated into the film and not all of the footage shot survived (it was thrown out after the release of the film). The film directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, the film take a fascinating premise and puts it,to use in a science fiction horror film--The Event Horizon used a magnetic drive generating a small black hole as an energy source that allows the ship to punch a hole in space traveling millions of light years in a day. On her maiden voyage the ship disappeared as the crew nagivated it from our solar system to another.

Suddenly, years later, the ship appears in orbit around Neptune and the ship is nonresponsive. The rescue ship the Lewis and Clark and her crew (Lawrence Fishburne, Kathleen Quinlan, Joely Richardson, Richard T. Jones, Jason Issacs, Sean Pertwee, Jack Noseworthy) escort the creator of the ship Dr. Weir (Sam Neill) to the ship to discover what happened to the crew during its journey.

The production design combines the look of ""Alien"" and the ""Hellraiser"" films to create a unique look for the film. What was lost during the editing phase was, unfortunately, background on the characters and the previous crew. It's a pity we will never be able to see the loss 30 minutes of footage but, as uneven and flawed as it is, Anderson's film became a cult classic transcending its box office failure like many other cult films.",1510444800,,1656,4.783216783216783

916875,2,6304744404,"I ordered this because a friend said I would enjoy it, and it was a decent movie. HOWEVER, I ordered with the impression from the listing that I was ordering a copy with both DVD and Blu Ray discs in it, and it was Blu Ray only when it arrived, so that's why two stars instead of the 3 I would normally have given it. Though that's more of a gripe against the seller than the product.

The movie itself is...well...boring. It's a very interesting concept, but the execution could have been better. The best thing about this movie is that the special effects, both digital and practical are pretty well done. I'd have liked more insight into the ""hell universe"", and obviously Sam Neill stole the show.

I was surprised that there was as little in the way of action as there was considering the director went on to make the Resident Evil film series, which we all know has it's own problems, but is at least good for a night of popcorn flicks.

TL:DR Movie decent, but underwhelming. Good special effects, boring story. Ordered Dual DVD/Blu Ray, received Blue Ray only.",1504569600,,1068,4.523316062176166

It's about a space rescue crew who bite off more than they can chew when they escort a scientist to his missing spaceship. There's gore, there's action thanks to character tension, there's quality kills, and there's believable acting (sans the first half of Neill's performance).

I am sure many have given the synopsis so I won't retread old review ground, but I think it has held up over time since I saw it in theaters, should always be in the top ten of sci-fi horrors along with the likes of Alien and The Thing... perhaps a little farther down the list than those classics, but still in the conversation.",1494115200,2,510,4.473118279569892

917134,5,6304744404,"This film baldly plagiarizes Alien and 2001 Space Odessey.  But the rip-off makes for a brilliant melange, a twisted and gory homage to those two films.

Instead of Kubrick giving us Discovery One's homicidal HAL with a New Age space monolith created hallucinatory antiseptic space purgatory in orbit above Jupiter; we have Anderson giving us Event Horizon's gravity drive - which is essentially a sentient magnetically bound black hole, basically a demonically possessed interdimensional hyper drive - that spits up demons from another dimension creating a hallucinatory shipboard hell fixed in the upper atmosphere of Neptune.

The aesthetics of the ship (which are very cool) imitate that of Alien's Nostromo, and the ill-fated crew here is from a rescue ship come to save and salvage the Event Horizon (sort of the reverse of Bowman in 2001 boarding the escape pod Eva to flee HAL and go meet the Monolith) much like the crew of the Nostromo responded to the ""rescue beacon"" of the alien ship in Alien.

There are other similarities between these three films that I won't divulge to avoid spoilers. Suffice to say that the screen writers and studio ought to be paying royalties to the makers of those other two films - though I suppose all the rights involved are all owned by the same conglomerate..?

Other critics here complain that elements of the story are absurd - all I have to say to that is all science fiction and horror fantasy is on some level absurd. The laws of physics don't need to apply to a fantasy world. It's called suspension of disbelief. If you can't manage it, you'd better stick to PBS documentaries and such.

It's also all rather gory and over the top. But based on all the squalling here and at Rotten Tomatoes, I'd thought that it was going to much much worse than it actually turned out to be. It's about as gory as Alien, or Aliens - while a bit graphic in places, most of the intensity is psychological.

Because despite all the obvious derivation, and all the silly quibbles, this movie is simply great. Why? Though many of the plot points are ripped off, the spin here is unique, the production values are awesome, the acting is great, and resulting hybrid is intense and scary.

All of which is merely to say that this film totally rocks.",1488672000,3,2277,4.717884130982368

917139,4,6304744404,"Early entry by Paul W.S. Anderson (of the Resident Evil film series). Cronenbergian body horror meets astrophysics! In some places, the astrophysical concepts are really compelling, but they also get a lot of the basics of physics wrong. This is especially clear in the zero-grav and vacuum of space scenes and depressurizations. The CG is obviously dated, but there is extensive use of incredible practical effects and sets that more than makes up for the deficit. I'm not going to list some of the flaws, because they are obvious and pointed out by others. Breaks a lot of both horror and sci fi tropes, is visually terrific (see linked screencap), and (mostly) well-acted. Baby Bear!",1487548800,4,686,4.973913043478261

Watching it progress it became more and more disturbing and leaving me wondering what was going to happen.  I'm usually 1 that can guess pretty well what will occur in a movie, but this, was hard to predict.

Its a slower starting film, but it adds to building suspense and mystery surrounding what actually happened on the ship.

Instead of writing a long review I'll leave it like so for viewers that are younger:  Have you seen or played Dead Space (video game)? If so, do you wish it was a movie at times?
This is the closest you'll get. It has the creepiness, general un-easy feeling throughout its entirety but it lacks the action and monsters. This focuses on the mind F the crew experiences and how they have to deal with it while dealing with a unknown threat.

You can easily tell the makers of Dead Space got a LOT of their ideas and inspiration from this film, and it's no wonder why, this film is awesome.",1484006400,3,998,4.367567567567567

With the resources available at the time, the movie effects are really awesome. The concept of a controlled black hole, and a ships coming alive are things not too often explored in Sci Fi. The concept that the ship went to hell, might be a bit far fetched, but that something evil came back certainly not beyond imagination.
The area that the film lacked, IMHO, is in the script. Yes, all needs to fit into a limited time. But more development of the evil, and more continuity in the characters would have gone a long way to make this a much better movie.

The story line is reasonable enough but the script is terrible.  Imagine 20147 and numerous members of the crew are deep space travelers who smoke cigarettes.  What a distraction and what a joke.  Did the cigarette companies pay someone for this element to be added to the script?  Second, the crew members who actually run the spacecraft appear to be borrowed from a stereotypic WW II submarine flick--they are crude, vulgar and classes yahoos.  Can anyone conceive of uneducated grunts running a primer, deep space craft in 2047?  Again, the crew is also inter-racial but it seems artificial as is the gratuitous language and overt sexual non-sense.  All this bad news and more was a distraction for me and my wife. Laurence Fishburne does a good job and he out-classes all the rest.

If you are a fan of real sic-fi outter-space flicks, this one will disappoint you.  It appears the movie was designed for teen-age boys and perhaps written by teenagers as well.  The movie is beset with gimmicks and language designed to shock and scare views.  These antics are never included in quality movies.

It has some fine actors who do a fine job with what they had to work with, but I'm confident that there's not one among them who doesn't look back and think, ""It sounded pretty good when I took the job!""  It's incredible to think that the original film was 30 minutes longer with even more cheesy disgusting tricks from the makeup artists; it's obvious why the studio ordered these changes before they would release the film.  It's so tedious and nonsensical that it fails even as a horror film.

For what it's worth, the scene where one character undergoes decompression in an airlock incident is absolute absurdity.  People have undergone explosive decompression to near vacuum, and while they showed some reddening of the skin and did suffer from the bends, had no significant outward signs from the event.

919098,5,6304744404,"Event Horizon is the story of a small crew that sets off to the ""alien"" ship Event Horizon to serve as a rescue team. Event Horizon offers a solid script from start to finish, good acting, and a fantastic execution. The plot sounds like your typical horror based rescue mission in space but soon you'll see why Event Horizon shines: it's highly original twist and it's connection to the dialogue throughout. I found that I greatly enjoyed the dialogue primarily because it tied in so well to the central themes of the movie and really kept me intrigued the whole 97 minutes. All of these things in harmony create a thought provoking product and an enjoyment to those willing to watch with open minds.

As a horror movie buff I highly recommend this one. To put it simply, this movie is UNSETTLING. Watch in a good setting at night

As far as all of the negative critic and audience reviews are concerned, I honestly cannot agree. Nor can I find reason to the claims made of bad acting, bad writing, inane plot, etc. .

919370,4,6304744404,"Event Horizon I feel is a very underrated horror film that's well worth watching. It also has a very Hellraiser type feel to it. Fishburne & Neil are really  good in this. Basic plot is 7 yrs after a ship, the Event Horizon, goes missing in deep space it reappears & a recue crew is sent to find out where its been & if any one has survived. Naturally once they get there things don't go as planned. The films has some really good atmosphere, especially once they get on board the Event Horizon ship & some pretty decent space sfx. This movie has always been one of my favorites ever since it first came out back in 1997. Its a shame that it could've been so much more though. For those that may not know the original cut of the film ran for about 2 hrs 10 mins, was very violent & gory but was trimmed down & edited by Paramount before the films releases. Hopefully one day the original uncut version will have a proper releases. Even with that said I feel its still a movie worth checking out for horror fans.",1481760000,,1011,4.211340206185567

It would be difficult to think of a captain and a crew more unsuited to their tasks.  In the year 2047, a research spaceship with the capability to artificially create a black hole (using magnetic fields :-) )big enough to warp space to create a wormhole from Neptune to Proxima Centauri is lost.  A rescue ship is sent with a crew that openly smokes in front of the captain, whose crew resents the assignment and has no technical clue about space travel, as if this would be a freighter boat in the ocean instead of a state-of-the-art spaceship.  They demand from the only scientist on board to have a simple language explanation of wormhole making, and later on when it is revealed that the spaceship somehow went out of spacetime into a dimension of ""pure evil"" (how about that for making sense: a dimension outside of spacetime where blood and gore and taking people's eyes are the prevailing fundamental laws) they physically attack the scientist for not adequately explaining what is going on.

Definitely a good movie for those who aren't expecting a mindless horror movie where you turn your brain off. If you're expecting something akin to Alien then this might not be for you as there are no rampaging ravenous alien lifeforms tearing crewmen apart. Despite being a sci fi movie this is more akin to the Hellraiser movies (which also took place in space in Hellraiser: Bloodline) as it also has a supernatural/occult theme to it. The entire movie has a feeling of dread present throughout most of it and at some points can be physiologically disturbing with grisly scenes of gore and torture at a certain point in the movie.

I wonder....do we really know what's out there, what's possible? Then I become afraid for a second lol...this movie made me paranoid. I do think Sam Neil made a good villain at the end but was ""meh"" as a good guy. I also think the special effects were good for the time period it was filmed in.

You may be reading other peoples reviews on this movie and they batch it for that, but in my opinion why not use them, it makes this movie that much better. It has the best of all those movies plus it has it's own killer theme. I'll be honest I don't really like movies from the 90s to the present because of all the CGI, but this movie is one of the best at using CGI and make up effects.

919611,2,6304744404,"This movie takes place in outer space but don't expect a plot-heavy science fiction film; this is strictly horror.

A scientist builds a ship that contains its own personal wormhole. The wormhole literally leads to the biblical Hell. Yes, really. Going to Hell drives the crew mad and they cannibalize each other while the captain screams in Latin. Years later the ship's creator joins an expedition to track it down, but once he's back on board he is possessed by a demon whose intention is to take this second crew to Hell, too, killing any who fight back.

I wasn't crazy about this movie. The plot seemed a bit dumb. It moves at so frantic a pace, you barely learn someone's name before they die. I felt no emotional attachment to anyone at all, but it was a little scary. It is action-packed, but it's a total gorefest, so if that's not your thing (hanging from meat hooks by the skin; eyeballs being ripped out; blood pouring from walls) then you won't like this movie.",1467244800,,975,4.565714285714286

919968,4,6304744404,"I enjoyed this movie more than my friend did. I give it credit for it's time. It's hard for me to place the originality of the ideas in such expansive hindsight, but I, more than some, feel that just because something references hell doesn't mean that it is stealing from every other demon movie, for example. I enjoyed that it is movie that does not slow build into the monsters/demons element and, if you listen to the director and writer commentary they will tell you, pays homage to other major horror movies before it in many of their references throughout the movie. My friend found it to be campy and over the top, but enjoyed it also because it was fast-paced and never tried to be pretentious; she said it knew that it was a campy horror movie and never tried to be more than what it was: a gory, demon/monster movie, which she enjoyed, even if it was by laughing at it, at times. I credit it for being creative where she thought it was campy. All in all, it's different tastes, but an enjoyable ride.

The movie, in brief summary, is about a spaceship salvage. This ship has disappeared with it's crew for some amount of time, but it has just appeared again, sending out a distress signal. The creator of the ship has convinced the government to give him a salvage crew to retrieve the ship and figure out where it has been. And of course, a monster movie ensues when the crew boards the ship to try to figure out where it's been and what happened to the previous crew.",1448582400,,1479,4.397810218978102

The ending was, well, OK I guess...sort of.  It left open the possibility the story was not over.  What disappointed me was the nature of the mystery/terror.

take theM to 'Neptune's' orbit, they have an additional crew member who at this stage is the only person that knows the purpose of the mission, 'Doctor William Weir' (Sam Neill)
A faint signal has been picked up from a ship that had disappeared seven years ago, presumed lost, 'The Event Horizon' a futuristic and experimental vessel designed by 'Doctor Weir'
When the rescue ship reaches the 'Horizon' a team is sent aboard to investigate the vessel, things start to become strange from the word go, some appear to be having 'Hallucinations' which initially are passed off.
The 'Horizons' gravity-drive starts up, seemingly without any instigation the shockwave severely damages the crews vessel, they have just 20 hours to repair the damage or they will in effect lose the vessel as the possibility of replenishing the oxygen level will be lost, the crew other than those trying to effect repairs have to transfer to the 'Horizon'
The crew on the 'Event Horizon' find the visions and happenings increasing in intensity, it seems the ship has a mind of its own almost a life of its own, it knows things about it's visitors that have never been shared.
It's Inventor becomes increasingly a part of the problem the crew face..............just where has the 'Horizon' been these past seven years ?
This is a tense Sci-Fi adventure that borders on 'Horror' with graphic scenes of violence and sequences of tension that will stretch your imagination to the limit.
This is a really good Sci-Fi Horror Tale, if you've never seen it, it's worth a spin, or like myself worth a re-visit.
Picture and Sound upgrade - First Class - Special Effects also impressive.

920132,5,6304744404,"Scary as Hell!  This movie freaked me out the 1st 3 times I watched it.  I enjoy watching this every couple of years or so just to freak out again.  Don't watch this movie if you are stoned, at least not for the 1st time. You will have nightmares, weed-mares are really strange and if you don't know what I'm talking about then I won't elaborate on details because not everyone tokes, and especially with the intense strands floating around these days, it'll make you nuts.

I have watched this movie sober and almost pooped my pants at several points.  It is quite the ordeal to assess the laundry situation with a load in your trowsers and boxers or briefs.  or for the poor ladies granny panties or of course the worst scenario ever...pooping your THONG?  just the thought of the excretion makes me uncomfortable.

Regarding the movie, it seriousness now (we're past the poop talk) this is legit.  Event Horizon is what defines Sci-Fi Horror.  It's the Kingpin of them all, often replicated by other movies and video games as well.
The Dead Space games & Anime have definitely been influenced by Event Horizon.  While playing those games, which are awesome, I couldn't help but notice that feeling I got while watching Event Horizon, fear.  Like something is about to happen at any time but no matter what you cannot prepare for what you are about to see and it will likely catch you off guard and make you JUMP!

The engineering, mechanics and tech of the Event Horizon seem to be mimicked in other films and I believe they took a page out of the original Alien film to inspire the ship.

I don't want to let out any spoilers so i'll be careful not to say specifics, other than trickery with sound and lighting are some of the elements that make this a great horror film.  There is also a psychological influence that effects the characters in this movie but we won't elaborate on that either.

This is one of my favorite movies in the Sci-Fi Genre, also the Horror Genre.  It's the perfect blend of both movie categories and since the original Alien movie, this movie finally brings forth the same vibe.  they are both very different films, I know that but there is a high level of respect for what Alien presented in the late 70's and Event Horizon in the 90's.  A certain level of fear was introduced by both films, a fear that had not been felt before by viewers.

I'll always have a high level of respect for this movie and no matter how many times I watch it, i'll always grip onto something at times and jump at others, how does is still manager to scare me?!  I've seen it like 5 times now.  GREAT movie.  Enjoy.",1434931200,,2624,4.466386554621849

920160,3,6304744404,"Paul Anderson directed ""Event Horizon.""  If you're having trouble keeping your Paul Andersons straight, join the club.  This is the Paul Anderson who directed ""Mortal Kombat,"" ""Soldier,"" ""Resident Evil,"" ""Alien vs. Predator,"" and ""Death Race.""  The other Paul Anderson is Paul Thomas Anderson, the guy who directed ""Boogie Nights,"" ""Magnolia,"" ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" and ""There Will Be Blood.""  You can tell by their film credits where each of them stands.  In 1999 the Paul Anderson of ""Event Horizon"" added the initials W.S. to the middle of his name to differentiate himself from the other fellow, and now audiences confuse the both of them with Wes Anderson.

""Event Horizon"" is a 1997 sci-fi horror thriller that starts out promisingly and then gets sucked up into a kind of cinematic black hole, which is also, not coincidentally, the subject of the picture.  An ""event horizon"" in science is the boundary around a singularity, a black hole, from which no matter or radiation can escape.  In the movie, there is a spaceship called the ""Event Horizon,"" which mysteriously vanished seven years earlier while ostensibly investigating the outer reaches of the solar system.  Now, in the year 2047, the U.S. Aerospace Command receives signals from space indicating the craft may have returned, which prompts them to send out another ship to rescue it.  What they find turns into ""Friday the 13th.""

One could forgive a person for thinking the movie was pretty good if the person had only seen the movie's first half.  Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, and Kathleen Quinlan star, and they're all fine actors who give it their best shot.  They appear to have had the idea they were remaking ""2001,"" and they take the whole affair with great seriousness.  What's more, Paramount seem to have spent a ton of money on the film, with most of the sets and special effects looking quite impressive.  So, what went wrong?

Well, after the first fifteen minutes just about everything went wrong.  The movie starts out well enough.  The search-and-rescue craft U.S.A.C. Lewis and Clark arrives in orbit around Neptune and finds the Event Horizon.  The rescue team enter the ship, and their initial exploration produces some genuine tension and suspense.  After that, the screenwriter, Philip Eisner, seems to have run out of fresh ideas and resorts to standard blood-and-guts.

Let's start with the basics.  The rescue team, for example, consists of the usual stereotypes:  The Captain (Laurence Fishburne) is wise, stalwart, brave, and heroic.  The designer of the Event Horizon, Dr. Weir (Sam Neill), is, as his name suggests, weird.  He considers the ship his baby, and he won't let anything happen to it, no matter what.  The team's First Mate (Joely Richardson) is sexy and sweet.  The Medical Technician (Kathleen Quinlan) is sincere and direct.  The Rescue Technician (Richard T. Jones) is cocky and wisecracking.  The Engineering Technician (Jack Noseworthy) is young and naive.  The Trauma Technician (Jason Isaacs) is tough and direct.  And the Pilot (Sean Pertwee) is hard and quarrelsome.  The script leaves no clich untouched, having the crew do exactly what you expect them do in every instance, which is mainly to act stupidly and get themselves killed.

It turns out, Weir tells us early on, that the Event Horizon wasn't just exploring the solar system after all.  In fact, it was a revolutionary new top-secret craft that could compress distances through space, its gravitational drive able to create artificial singularities--tiny black holes--allowing the spaceship to fold space in on itself and travel anywhere in the universe in moments.  Apparently, the ship's been to hell and back, literally.

Now, someone or something is on the ship, and it doesn't want the rescue team around bothering him (or it, or whatever).  Maybe the entity should have shown the rescue team this film.  That would have cleared out everybody fast.  Instead, we get a series of almost incomprehensible incidents, most of them without rhyme or reason, and none of them ever explained.  I suspect they're left unexplained because the screenwriter didn't have the faintest idea about them, either.

Anyway, after the rescue team's initial exploration, we get an endless amount of ""Alien"" type creeping around in the labyrinthine spaceship, with folks dying in various gruesome ways.  Worse, nothing makes any sense.  Our first clue:  The rescue team brings a recording with them of the Event Horizon's old crew uttering their last words.  Nobody on Earth could understand what they were saying, but upon listening to the recording for the first time, one of the rescue crew immediately says, ""It's Latin.""  Right.  Not a person on Earth, using 2047 computers, could figure this out, but a guy on the rescue team hears it once and instantly deciphers it.

Or how about this:  After the rescue team has discovered that the whole crew of the Event Horizon have died horrible deaths, with blood splattered all over the walls, Dr. Weir invites them to view the gravitational drive, saying ""It's perfectly safe.""  Famous, and unintentionally funny, last words.

I kept rolling my eyes and sometimes laughing out loud during the final forty-five minutes of ""Event Horizon,"" something I'm sure the filmmakers didn't intend, either.  The movie is bloody, nonsensical, and largely unmoving, meaning we don't care enough about the characters to worry about what happens to them.  Fortunately, the thing lasts only ninety-five minutes, so neither the crew nor we have to suffer long.

Video:
Paramount transferred the movie to a dual-layer BD50 Blu-ray disc using an MPEG-4/AVC codec, and the results are as good as we could hope for.  The picture looks beautifully detailed, sharp, and precise.  Although the movie is dark in the manner of an ""Alien"" film, there are reasonably good colors throughout.  Hues are bright and rich, without being overbearing, and skin tones are particularly natural.  Black levels are decent if not inky, and a light film grain provides more texture than some viewers may like.

Audio:
For English, we get the choice of either regular, lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 or lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio tracks.  The TrueHD is considerably the smoother of the two, but it also tends to make spoken lines a bit too soft and rounded.  When bass thunders and one feels the dynamic impact, it can also obscure some of the dialogue.  The transient response is quick, the clarity of aural effects is outstanding, and the surround activity, while somewhat limited, sounds impressive.

Extras:
This high-definition Blu-ray disc contains everything that Paramount previously included in their standard-definition two-disc DVD set.  Things begin with the mandatory audio commentary, this one by director Anderson and producer Jeremy Bolt.  They're amiable enough and reveal a good deal of detail about the filmmaking, but they also tend to praise the film overmuch so it's kind of a self-serving affair.

Next, there's ""The Making of Event Horizon,"" five making-of featurettes in standard def that total about 103 minutes.  The titles of each section are pretty self-explanatory if you've already watched the movie, and they contain a remarkable amount of talk:  ""Into the Jaws of Darkness,"" ""The Body of the Beast,"" ""Liberate Tutume Ex Infernis,"" ""The Scale to Hell,"" and ""The Womb of Fear.""  After those items are four more featurettes, again in standard def, collected under the umbrella title ""The Point of No Return:  The Filming of Event Horizon.""  They total about eight minutes and include ""The Revolving Corridor,"" ""The Crew Gathers,"" ""Shooting Wire Work,"" and ""The Dark Inside.""  After that we find three deleted or expanded scenes with optional director commentary, followed by ""The Unseen Event Horizon,"" which includes storyboards and conceptual art, again with director commentary.

The extras finish up with a full-screen video trailer in standard def; a widescreen theatrical trailer in high def; seventeen scene selections, with bookmarks; pop-up menus; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Shots:
It's really disheartening to see how quickly this movie degenerates from an intriguing premise into an absurd, blood-splashed gore-a-thon.  It's even more disheartening to see three fine actors like Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, and Kathleen Quinlan participate in it.  I guess either the money was right or they didn't read the second half of the script.  ""Event Horizon"" at least looks good, but that's hardly enough.",1433203200,,8634,5.201449275362319

920257,5,6304744404,"Event Horizon is one of the best horror movies made in the last 25 years and probably one of the best sci-fi movies made in the last 25 years as well. It's hard to point to any one thing that makes it so good, because it's the combination of things that really makes it more than the sum of its parts. The acting is really good all around and even the comic relief character is portrayed very well. The setting is unique and interesting. The story and pacing are very well done. The characters are a little flat, but not so much that they detract from the overall movie. The visual effects are very good and don't feel terribly dated like other movies from the era might have. The soundtrack is also good, though the ending credits song is a bit... of an unusual choice. Not a bad song, just a bit out of place.

If there's anything bad that can be said about the movie is that it's too short. At roughly an hour and a half, it feels like it's leaving something on the table. Apparently more footage was shot, but not included in the final movie for a number of reasons. But it's a relatively minor problem.

The special features are solid and interesting, but nothing to really write home about when it's all said and done. If anything, they kind of make you want a sequel or additional material even more. I'd like to know more about the universe this movie takes place in.

920278,4,6304744404,"A film early in Paul W.S. Anderson's catalogue.  If he had taken a leaf out of this book, the Resident Evil films might not have been so abysmal.  Even Horizon takes place in space in the year 2047.  The starship Event Horizon has suddenly reappeared after seven years of absence.  Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), his crew, and the Event Horizon's designer (Sam Niell), are sent out to salvage the lost ship and find out what happened seven years ago.  What they find is an empty ship and evidence of brutal acts of violence.  Soon, the crew start to experience hallucinations from their past as they attempt to solve the mystery of what happened on the Event Horizon.  This film received negative reviews upon its initial release.  However, it is a decent science fiction horror film.  The first half of the film is pure genius.  Things start to go south after that.  Paul Anderson was actually required to cut out a lot of material from the original film, to achieve an R rating from an original NC-17 rating.  This results in some pacing and continuity flaws.  The editing is what makes the film a little rough.  The production design in this film is amazing.  Also, for the Blu-Ray release, very little was done to restore the original film stock.  However, despite these flaws, Event Horizon is an entertaining sci-fi romp.",1431388800,,1333,4.755458515283843

920524,1,6304744404,"I am a Sci-Fi fan.  I enjoyed Alien.  I just watched Interstellar, and it ranks very highly: possibly right up there with 2001: A Space Odyssey.  In all my years (and I saw 2001 in the theater, so those years are many) I have stood up and walked out on ONE movie.  That movie was Event Horizon.

Event Horizon is NOT a Sci-Fi story.  Event Horizon is not a fun horror movie.  Event Horizon is obscenity.  No, not the healthy kind with sex and nudity.  I have maintained since my first (and only) viewing that I would much prefer to have my children (now 16 and 19) watch hard-core porn with everything sexuality and lust have to offer, in 3D, than to have them watch the stomach-turning bloody gore featured in the first half of this motion picture.  Event Horizon was originally advertised as a science-fiction adventure - no mention of depravity, necrophilia, skin-peeling torture, and blood-bathed gore.  The trailer shows no blood, no torn skin, no images from hell.  It hints at the typical explosions in space, of a space-ship with an adversarial alien aboard, and even the possibility of a nude red-head (due to hair-color, not lack of a scalp).  No hint of dead-body stew in a cruise-ship sized pot.  I went, with my wife, and was completely disappointed, and revolted.  Maybe sickened is accurate, since my appetite was certainly affected.  I don't know how the second half of the movie was, but I couldn't see it improving enough to kill another hour of my life.  Interestingly, my act of standing and leaving the theater with my wife emboldened at least four other people to get up and leave with us, so my revulsion was not unique.

Even 20 or so years later, I will remain concerned about the instincts of anyone who claims to have enjoyed this show at some level.  The R rating given was gracious - Had the movie contained a single frame of human genitals being used as intended, it would have garnered an X rating. That the MPAA is offended by well-proportioned people without clothes (unless they are blue-skinned), but is okay with people who have been deprived of their clothes AND THEIR SKIN is perverse.

Unfortunately, I'm forced by Amazon's rating system to give this show at least one star.  To me, one star implies that there is some redeeming quality.  There isn't.",1428796800,2,2290,4.658354114713217

A similar movie was shown on Sci-Fi Channel about a cruise ship that sailed into the Bermuda Triangle and then 20 years later floated out again.  This is essentially the same plot.  People come on board to see what happened and the ship (the Event Horizon) traveled into a Hell or Chaos dimension and came back 'alive'.  Spooky and scary things then start happening and some of the people die.  The first time I saw it really did scare the beejabers out of me.

The effect is much more distracting that riveting.
Characters were impulsive caricatures of the stereotypical list of usual suspects for this genre.
That each crewmember was privately having a uniquely disturbing horror experience, is disjointed by the fact that individuals are reluctant to take serious and accept that others are having their own parallel version of horror.
Had their there been even a minimal thread of scientific curiosity shared commonly by crewmembers, a more lively and revealing drama could have developed around the apparently powerful and supposedly evil features they were pitted against.

After the rescue vessel docks with Event Horizon, its crew learns that Event Horizon had pioneered the use of a space/time warp drive which, to everyone's horror, had also breached dimensional reality...and that's when all hell breaks loose.

It's obvious now that the story is a cross between Solaris, the 1972 Russian Sci-Fi film, and Hellraiser. Not that that's a bad thing just interesting and something I didn't pick up on in '97. They even go as far as copy a direct scene from Solaris which is the wife killing herself and the husband reliving it. In Solaris, it turns out that the planet is a giant organism and can take those tragic memories and experiences and manifest them into physical form, though it's purpose was not evil doing, but experimentation. Probing another intelligence as the scientist were probing it with their x-Ray experiments. Of course Event Horizon takes this premise and turns into more horror elements via a Hellraiser scenario and it works very well. The only real complaint I had was the very last scene. It seemed like a badly executed after thought. Almost a cheap scare really. Glad I re-watched. I'll have to pick this up on Blu at some point.",1425513600,,1105,4.53

It looked like it had a decent budget and effect so that was a draw but it also promised a scary ride.  So let me tell you this move has very good effects and they support the story well.  Its got really good acting as well, the acting is dead on and really boosts the story.  The atmosphere evoked is most definitely creepy, and also does a lot to boost the story.  The backbone of the story is also interesting enough to make you want more, oh and yes it too has a very definite creepy factor to it.  So with all that going for it, why one star?

I'm giving this movie one star because it got everything right and still managed to suck.  Why?  The writing.  Now wait didn't I say it had a solid backbone?  Yes I did.  Unfortunately that doesn't get you past the absolute stupidity of the writing.  And I don't mean that characters have corny lines or anything, what I mean is that the characters are written to be idiots.  This movie is basically Friday the 13th or Halloween in space.  And yes, its basically just a s***ty space slasher flick.  It shouldn't be, but it is.  If you're willing to put up with a movie where characters seem to go out of their way to get murdered then check it out.  Its a hell of a lot better that either Friday the 13th or Halloween as a slasher flick goes.  But if you were hoping for a little more from it you will be disappointed.

Summery: Its a slasher flick in space.
The Good: Best space slasher flick ever.

But then, I had a bunch of people telling me how freaky it was and that it was going to give me nightmares and it would be the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life, so maybe my expectations were just too high.  It felt kind of rushed, and maybe a little dated.  I also felt that the filmmakers were trying too hard to squick me out and scare me, and when you can tell, it makes it a lot less scary.  It was still kind of squicky, though, but not much--the things that were meant to be gross flashed by so fast that I didn't really absorb them, so it was more like 'thanks for flashing a bunch of stuff at me' than 'oh my gosh eww.'

I thought the ship designs and the world building were pretty cool, though, and the whole cast put in very solid performances.  I liked the characters and didn't want them to die, so the actors did their jobs.  I don't think it was bad or good, honestly, it was just okay.

921681,4,6304744404,"Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne are deservedly accomplished actors, and the rest of the cast do a great job, in this more-than-decent sci-fi thriller.  The concept is essentially, as another reviewer put it, ""Hellraiser goes to Neptune"" but it also reminds (in good ways) of Alien(s), Sunshine, Solaris, Outland and even the Matrix (you can see glimmers of the brilliance that becomes Morpheus... Lawrence more than commands a room!)  The anti-gravity core and the aesthetics of the ship were nice old-school-but-not-overly-CGI props.  They can do amazing things with the concept of depressurization!

There's a touch of something else - Se7en, or the Ninth Gate - there is a bit of a morality tale in there, but they didn't immerse themselves in it.  I found it very Lovecraftian in how they treated the other dimension and mankind's place in the Universe.

[SPOILER]
If anything, I found the lighter touches off-balancing.  The comic relief of the astronaut patching the hole in the ship, getting blasted away, riding a piece of shrapnel, jet packing back, getting shot at by a speargun, clawing through an airlock, only to end up alive with the last blonde in deep space seemed a little stretched.  Then again, pretty early on I wondered how anyone would get out alive and avoid a really downer ending!
[/SPOILER]

All-in-all definitely worth a ride in space and time.  If you are looking for sci-fi with a fine cast led by two more-than-capable actors, fairly restrained use of special effects, and are prepared for some gore, you could find worse films out there.

921754,4,6304744404,"A few years ago, I played a game called Dead Space. If you haven't heard of it, it was a very successful survival-horror game set in a giant spaceship where you investigated what happened to the crew. It was very atmospheric, had an incredible design, and featured some crazy hallucinations as a small part of the games story. I remember a couple of reviews mentioning how it was similar to Event Horizon, which I never watched until just last night.

having watched the movie, I can say that Dead Space is a complete rip-off of Event Horizon (though I don't really mean that in a bad way).

There were countless times when Id be watching the movie and say to myself, hey, Ive seen this room before, and when the crew started hallucinating, I was in disbelief. Game connections aside, what shocked me the most was how much I enjoyed the movie, given who the director is. The guy responsible for some of the worst movies Ive ever seen- Alien vs Predator and the Resident Evil series, directed this! Well, every dog has his day I guess. Event Horizon may not be one of the best movies Ive seen, but it did hold my interest from beginning to [anti-climactic] end. This is a very visual movie that gets right down to business, never going off track with needless drama or over the top action.

The Event Horizon is a ship that went missing in space, and a crew has been dispatched to find out where it was before it came back, and what happened to the crew. Captain Miller leads the investigation, and a stranger has joined his crew- Dr. William Weir, who designed the ship. It turns out that the Event Horizon was built to test a new transportation method where it creates a fake black hole, and uses the gravitational force to go from point A to point B instantly. Before they board the Event Horizon, scanners show that theres something there, though any sign of the crew looks bleak. Once onboard, things take a turn for the worse when the ships gravity drive seemingly activates on its own, and sucks one of the crewmen into it. Soon, other members of the rescue team begin to suffer from intense hallucinations. The Event Horizons video log is found, and whats on the tape is something no one was prepared to see.

I don't watch a lot of sci-fi movies, but this is one that Im sure to watch a few more times in the future. Event Horizon, while definitely not perfect, kept me in with its pacing, style and even the unanswered questions. I won't go into that, as to not ruin anything, but they definitely leave some things to your imagination, and thats good. While watching the movie, I kept thinking of how films like this would have done something, like a scare or suspenseful moment, and completely ruined it. I gotta hand it to Paul Anderson- he did a great job with the timing here. Scares never feel forced, nor do the moments when somethings about to happen feel too long or short. I also loved the Event Horizons design. Granted, I saw a lot of it in Dead Space already, but since this came out long before the game, its cool knowing that this was made almost 20 years ago and still holds up. The Event Horizon is practically a character in its own right, with some rooms looking like they're about to kill anyone who enters just because of their design. One crew member even points out how deadly one appears as soon as he sees it.

Acting is pretty good across the board. There are only a couple of people here, and aside from Miller and Weir, everyone gets a pretty even amount of screen time. You have some stereotypes, like Cooper, the street-talkin would-be ladies man, and the gruff skinny guy who acts tough, yet I liked most of the characters because they never really had a chance to do anything that irritated me. Laurence Fishburne though, as good as he is in most of his roles, threw me off at times. His character, Captain Miller, is pretty no-nonsense and hes able to keep cool in the darkest of times. This gets thrown out the window later on when he has his mind set on something involving the ship, and while it was funny and very quotable, it almost seemed out of place based on how he was up until that point. The only other thing that got me is excusable- very dated CG. Fortunately, its mostly in the beginning with objects floating around in zero gravity, so its no big deal. They just had me worried that thered be a lot of now-bad special effects to look forward to. Luckily, that never happened. Lots of real sets, real practical effects and real people doing stunts. I just wish there were more real explosions and less sparks when things were getting damaged in the ship

Event Horizon was a pleasant surprise to watch. Here Id been hearing about it for years and never had much interest until recently when I decided to finally start going through my queue. How it bombed in theaters is beyond me (maybe other movies that opened on the same day were bigger titles?), and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good space movie, or fans of Dead Space!",1414713600,,4996,4.466593647316539

922250,3,6304744404,"Event Horizon had the potential to be an even better film, it really did, yet it seemed to have squandered those hopes in the last half hour by resorting to gore.  The casting, for one thing, was impeccable.  Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne are, generally, pretty serious actors.  So to see people like the characters they play psychologically crack up onscreen should be terrifying.  Yet it wasnt, because the proper execution just wasn't there.

And then, of course, theres the whole the ship went to hell, and it came back alive! premise.  First of all, hell has been done so many times that its boring now.  If you're going to tackle the hell cliche, you should probably only do so if you're sure that your style is fresh and new.  You say hell to me, and Im already cheek-to-hand, drifting off.

And as for the ship being alive, this felt like a concept that begged to be delved into further, yet the surface was barely scratched.  Comparisons of this film to 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Event Horizon suffering in comparison, were warranted.

Watching the film now, as opposed to when it first came out, also allows me to compare it to Danny Boyles Sunshine, which I feel is a vastly superior film.  A lot of folks didn't like Sunshines genre switch-up right in the middle, but I thought that added to the excitement, whereas with Event Horizon, you always feel like you're on the edge of a really good sneeze that just never manifests.

Event Horizon also relied on its fair share of cheap scares.  For one thing, when Peters is hallucinating about her son and D.J., I think it was, yells her name to bring her out of it - why would you yell at her?  Picture that as a real situation.  Youre zoning off, the person next to you has no idea what you're doing, only that you seem scared, and he screams at you to bring you back to reality.  Yeah, great - thats just what you need when you're terrified.

Plus, Peters grabbing a knife (before seeing the hallucinations) to defend herself was rather silly.  Youre in space!  Who could possibly be on board the ship with you, aside from the crew who accompanied you there?  Sure, they still weren't sure yet as to whether or not everyone on the Event Horizon had perished, but the odds were looking pretty good.  If you had to defend yourself from anything, honey, it certainly wasn't something that was tangible and therefore vulnerable to stabbing.

[SPOILERS]

Cooper (Richard T. Jones) was a riot, and I was both glad and surprised that he made it through alive, and it struck me as innovative that when I was 30 minutes from the end of the film, no one had yet died (that resilient Justin).  Of course, it seemed like the filmmakers realized that at around the same point, because then folks just started dropping like flies.

The cast was great, the pacing was good, and the dialogue wasn't altogether cheesy.  But Event Horizon could have been a fantastic psychological thriller that unfortunately succumbed to and descended into its own madness.",1413504000,,3004,4.618867924528302

With so much publicity of the real deal by NASA, many of us know what real astronauts look like in space suits.  But these suits look like poor imitations.  Yet to the film's credit, the main character illustrates a real theory about the possibility of faster-than-light travel if it's through curved space.  When so many sci-fi films show the actors moving around their spaceships in deep space with normal gravity, this story gets credit for showing that gravity isn't there and must be manufactured.

923050,2,6304744404,"If you like bloody evil suspense movies - you might enjoy (?) this movie.

Dimensional Hopping Space Ship brings back evil spirits from the Other Side.
Bad things then occur to good people.
Without much explanation - ridiculous amounts of explosives are on a very delicate space ship.  Other than that - trade demons for aliens & it's a basic eviks in space movie.

Um - but it does have a good point to make:

If we ever do develop FTL dimension time/space bending warp drive space ships.
You'll want to first send soke robot units & do that from a far safe distance Away from Earth...  Then maybe try plants, and some animals to see if they survive...
and well, the first human subjects should be terminally ill patient volunteers.

Bending space & time looks cool in movies but to actually do so to living creatures might do horrible things to their biology. And horrible things to their minds.

One work around for this in some Science Fiction is that Cargo: tools, machines, inorganic stuff : that gets shipped via FTL.  But humans and organics like food and animals - they still have to travel at Sublight speeds.

That would slow down colonization, but help with interstellar trade goods.

No mention in the film what would happen to space bacteria.  I guess it dies without life support during the FTL jump.

It's a horror film.  Not for real science lovers.",1411344000,,1366,4.618257261410788

An old favorite of mine had a ship lost in the bermuda triangle that was a former Nazi vessel that ran on human blood it occasionally had to refill. Event Horizon is one of the better, if not the absolute best of this curious subgenre of horror. The character lines are occasionally clunky, but in a fun way. Lawrence Fishburne seems to enjoy his role as the captain of a bedeviled crew of hapless salvage/rescue operators. The whole concept of space travel mingling with something that seems to be Hell is outlandish and, in my book, awesome. If you're looking for bizarre combinations of science and the occult, then this will fit quite nicely on your shelf. The film has a few creepy scenes, but is more of an action movie with horror elements than a horror movie with action elements.

Leadership by shouting, seems to be a thing with his performances outside The Matrix.

Sam Neil does a good job showing his decent and fall and plays full-on evil very menacingly. Props as well to the makeup and practical effects team.  Story is good, if not deed.  A little too much reliance on jump scares in the beginning but the full horror at the end is well done. More a suspense picture with some Hellraiser gore.

In some ways the idea is plausible as recent physics theory indicates the opening of our universe to a chaotic parallel universe has been deemed possible.

923981,5,6304744404,"Event Horizon is a shining example of sci-fi horror. An experimental ship dissapears and then mysteriously reappears so a search and rescue ship is sent to investigate, along with the crew the research scientist who invented the ship's drive for the Event Horizon is present. When they reach the ship they discover an unexpected horror.

For me the film works well as both a science fiction and a horror story. For the science fiction you get some wonderful scenes of the solar system and of micro gravity (in fairness the effects do look a little dated in this respect, but still do their job). It also works by not just being a horror set in space, the horror comes because it is space and the setting itself adds peril to the mission.

The horror is strong by blending a mix of personal, psychological horror with good visual and more visceral scenes. It works on an individual level for the characters drawing upon their fears and the degeneration into madness, particuarly in Sam Neil's character's case. The technology of the ship also enhances this brutal aspect, the drive itself looks more like a device of medieval torture rather than esoteric technology.

The pacing of the film is spot on, it doesn't take long to get going and keeps providing something new to keep you interested. The cast is small and allows you to get to know each of the cgharacters and the different aspects they feed into the story.

Overall this is an excellent watch and highly recommended.",1386460800,2,1477,4.735408560311284

What ""Event Horizon"" IS, is a great, creepy, popcorn flick that (just to sweeten the deal) actually has some philosophical substance. In fact, it has enough philosophical substance to keep you wanting MORE.
In fact, it seems a lot of those who are giving this movie such poor reviews are having a problem with just that; ""Event Horizon"" comes off half baked. If it had MORE, if it delved more into the concept, I'm sure this flick would be faring much better than it is, critically speaking.
To that point, if you have read any literature or fantasy about Anti-Cosmic theory, religion, etc. then you're going to go into this film with an upper hand... And it will most likely upset you that they didn't expand enough. But keep in mind that that's not necessarily the Director's or the Writer's fault. The studio cut 5 plus minutes before it's theatrical release, and while that my not seem like much in our everyday time, it's close to infinite in the movies.
Are there similarities to Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser?"" Yes. Both in concept and, at times, aesthetic. Are there plot holes and scientific errors? Yes. It's a Horror movie that takes place in space. What did you expect?
And that's one more thing to be underlined and noted...
This is NOT Sci-Fi. It's not Scy-Fy. It most DEFINITELY IS a HORROR movie that happens to be set in outer space. And at that, and ONLY that crossroad, shall the two genres meet in ""Event Horizon.""

924019,3,6304744404,"Great plot, fine protagonists, lots of verve BUT, in the end, a disappointing underachieving SF film. About a spaceship that is sent out to find out what happened to another ship presumed lost years before. The mission is actuated by the reception of a creepy message from the ill-fated vessel. Clearly inspired by ALIENS [1986], IT, THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE [1958]---the latter the template for ALIEN [1979]---and the ""original"" STAR TREK episode ""The Devil In The Dark"", 1967. Unlike these, however, the final destination is not a colony on a planet but another spaceship. And this doozy of a craft seems to have sped across the galaxy using a technology that gets you to where you wanna go not by traversing long distances over many years but by traversing contiguous parallel planes in a fraction of the time. Minor problem: the ship seems to have accessed an aperture through one of these planes---and it doesn't lead to Disneyworld.

Laurence Fishburne has never been better as the terse, no-nonsense first-in-command who sacrifices himself at the end to save the last of his crew. Perpetual hero and good-guy Sam Neil [JURASSIC PARK, 1993] seems miscast as the deranged scientist-inventor of the accidental portal to hell but is eerily effective as a transformed inhabitant of the netherworld. The rest of the cast includes Kathleen Quinlan but the various members of the crew are only superficially characterized and we don't really bond to them.

The story is not well paced with suboptimal tension development and minimal claustrophobia engendered, and there are multiple missed opportunities to scare the pants off the viewer. There was also too much focus on the metal sphere responsible for the mayhem and some supernatural hogwash. There are some brief, lurid, unsettling visual depictions of what appears to be hell but we don't get enough glimpses and there is no actual ingression into the abyss.

The ending seems to leave an opening for a sequel. If this ever does happen I can only hope that the project lands in the hands of a real pro like director James Cameron [ALIENS].",1379980800,,2098,4.988571428571428

Not sure if all the ones offered have the second disc like mine did with extra features, but that was a bonus I hadn't seen in the description. It's a great movie, just scary enough without all the gore of some horror movies. I love horror movies, and I love sci-fi movies. To have both in one is awesome! There are just so few movies out there anymore that make you want to watch again and again, but this one was on that list. Good acting, great special effects. And there's nothing cut out like some 'pay per month services' that sometimes cut out a few scenes. This is the full movie in all it's wonderful, scary glory! What's so great about it is that it's not overly gory and just scary enough. Too many movies today are filled with gore and guts and I think that's what the negative reviewers are upset about. I prefer movies that make you think, that have the thrills and chills that make you jump, and this movie does that every time I watch it. I am so glad I found it here.

924025,5,6304744404,"2047. Space exploration is still in its infancy where there are more mysteries than discovery. Man's attempt to reach the stars and beyond is at the cusp of this space horror opera in which Dr. Weir (eerily played by Sam Neill), has created a device to jump through space-time and reach distant points in space in a matter of moments.

Problem is, his pet project, in the form of a space exploration vessel, the Event Horizon, disappeared off the grid in 2040, only to reappear 7 years after the fact, the ship weather-beaten and crew dead, by means gruesome and unfathomable. A rag-tag crew is assembled to assess the lost ship and to gain knowledge of its missing years. When they arrive, they find a ghost ship with no idea as to what happened to the crew other than something out of Dante's Inferno. The bigger question: what exactly is the object that Weir has created and what has it brought back from beyond the stars?

Even Horizon is highly underrated. It combines classic science fiction with horror at is best and most memorable and chilling. Is it graphic and gore-filled? Absolutely. That's part of the point and the smoke and mirrors thrown in our faces will fool some but not all of us. The gore is good, solidly placed for maximum effect but never overdone. We get the expected slasher theme but under it, it's a psychological thriller. You're asked to think and not given the clues right away. You're forced to participate with the characters as they realize what is happening. That's how insidious it is, the subtext and the in your face gore. For most horror slasher films, it's all sensory and zero interpretation where the viewer isn't asked to contemplate anything...just watch, not think, and be grossed out. With this film, there is a PLOT--and that will seriously confound many. Everything meshes beautifully. It's disturbing but with a razor sharp edge and not at all meaningless.

What makes this movie even more effective is the unconventional cast, a group of talented actors who almost seem miscast in a horror film. You don't see talented, gifted actors like Sam Neill, Lawrence Fishburne, Kathleen Quinlan, Jason Issacs and Joley Richardson in a horror movie, let alone together. The secondary cast are also solid, and the entire whole complements each other. You're immediately grounded with all these characters, artfully depicted throughout as well as effortlessly acted, and you feel for them. They get in your head. They are not nameless objects of bloody fodder but meant to matter, to convey the overlying message that what you think you know of your worst fears, is waaaaayyy past simplistic but of the stuff your imagination could never dream up on a bad day. It is not meant to question anything other than to tap into those base fears, to heighten the inherent dread of idea of hell itself. That's it. At its core, the philosophy is to scare. And they director and writer knew that they did us a favor and gave us much more. More importantly, it works. The devious, intelligent and unexpected plot, the smart direction, the frenetic and claustrophobic set and everything in between is in perfect harmony.

I own this movie. One of the few on my shelf. It's worth the money. I've watched it several times and I still flinch. I won't watch it unless someone else is with me. If I'm alone, and I want a good scare, I watch with the lights on and then have to watch something warm and fuzzy and opposite of what I've just experienced. You think you'll manage just fine. Sure, tell yourself that. Watch it alone, at night and then tell me you weren't freaked out. I know, I've heard it before. You've watched them all and none of it's surprised or even made you blink but be forewarned. Event Horizon will crawl right under your skin, sit there and then scare the everlasting crap at you.

An that, I think, is freaking AWESOME!",1376870400,,3866,4.71301775147929
924026,4,6304744404,I enjoyed it. Horror and space are a great combo if you know what you're doing. It worked for Alien but not for Jason X. It's a shame there is no director's cut of this film and so far all that lost footage is available on YouTube. I would like to watch a prequel explaining the beginning of the story. I mean we know what happened to the crew of the Event Horizon but where did all the bodies go? One frozen body was found floating and did they really go to hell or some planet where the aliens are demons? So much to tell and maybe someday someone will write a novel or graphic novel giving us the details. A prequel would be great.,1376092800,,634,4.08

924131,5,6304744404,"Sadly the extras for this film got overexposed and are lost forever.  So if you're waiting for a blu ray with more extras you won't get one.  They had about fifteen minutes of footage of gore they cut to get an R rating that is gone now.  Sad, because I'd have loved to see it.

Now to get to the film.  The title screen looked very unpromising and I was sure it would be a lousy transfer.  I was completely wrong.  It is one of the best transfers I have seen.  The blacks are fantastic in how dark they are without any digitization or pixelization.  The colors are all dark and the movie itself was shot very dark.  It's an excellent presentation with how they did it and it is very high quality even on my now older blu ray player.

Sounds have been done very well.  I was very happy to hear the booms and wooshes of weird noises going around in my 5.1.  I believe it is HD-DTS but I don't recall.  Regardless it is again very well done.

Overall you're not going to get a special edition with extra gore or footage.  The footage is gone.  You're not going to get a better transfer or better sound I don't think unless they have a 4k version hanging out there.  Lol.

924139,2,6304744404,"I really wanted to like this film - but to my considerable regret I simply couldn't and I found it surprisingly disappointing. Below, more of my impressions, with some very limited SPOILERS.

In 2047, the rescue spaceship ""Lewis and Clark"" is dispatched to answer a distress signal received from ""Event Horizon"", a starship that disappeared during its first attempted voyage to Proxima Centauri seven years earlier. Joining the the crew of ""Lewis and Clark"" is Dr Weir (Sam Neill), the man who designed the revolutionary ""gravity drive"", which was supposed to open to humanity the road to the stars... Well, you can safely assume that some bad things will then happen and some people from ""Lewis and Clark"" will not make it. Other than that I will say no more, to avoid more spoilers - but also, to be brutally frank, because I didn't manage to follow very well what happened after those first two minutes of the film...

I think that the director and the scenarist missed the mark when they refused to decide if they want to make a science-fiction adventure film or a kind of ""haunted house"" horror flick... As result, they attempted to do both and ended by making neither. I found ""Event Horizon"" much too weird for an adventure film and definitely not scary enough for a horror. I also usually do not like much films in which people behave too irrationally, without any good reason and everything is just explained by ""but they are in space and space makes them crazy""... Rather quickly this film bored and tired me - and at the end I was simply relieved that it was over.

Well, it is a pity, because a lot of resources was used to make this film. Budget was very honest (60 million USD in 1997) and special effects are good - as far as visuals are concerned, I have no beef with ""Event horizon"". The general idea was also good and the first 15-20 minutes are in fact very honest.

Actors performed also well, in the limits afforded by the scenario... Sam Neill is of course a credit to any film he plays in, but Laurence Fishburne, who plays Captain Miller, commanding officer of ""Lewis and Clark"", did also very well. Joely Richardson plays Lieutenant Starck, second in command on board of ""Lewis and Clark"" and so far as I am concerned, this character is the best thing in the whole film. A honorable mention goes to Kathleen Quinlan, who plays medical technician Peters.

I personally didn't like this film - I found it weird, chaotic and boring and as I already said, at the end I was only relieved that it is over. But it is only my personal point of view - you are welcome to give it a try and make your own mind about it.",1373500800,,2633,4.511530398322851

It's led by Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill, two of the finest actors going, and a good supporting cast.  The sets are believable, even though they're not almost twenty years old.  The film aims for minimalism, and this is where it falls short--or rather, overshoots.  The character development is choppy and much too thin.  A half an hour more to flesh out especially the two leading characters would have pulled me along better.  There's also the much too easy--jump through a dimensional fold, and you'll end up in hell--cliche', but that wouldn't be noticeable if the characters were stronger.

924183,4,6304744404,"Every now and again I come across a ""budget"" Blu Ray title that exceeds my expectations. This is one of them.

This movie predates ""Sphere"" by a year  and ""Solaris"" (with Clooney) by about five years.  All three films share a similar theme, but  I've just watched ""Event Horizon"" for the first time and I think it is the best out of the three for sheer entertainment, though I don't know if I'll  file it under Science Fiction or Horror in my collection.

Where ""Solaris"" is cerebral, ""Event Horizon"" is visceral.  And it trounces ""Sphere"" for script and acting.

It definitely beats both films for pacing and suspense - be forewarned - it does have a lot of scary imagery (not a film for kids or the squeamish).

The film transfer looks superb on Blu Ray, and I was very impressed by the sets and special effects. I rank the look of it (the sets) up there with ""Alien"".",1370390400,3,870,4.421383647798742

I personally like sci-fi films which have enough involved that it is a believable film in another world or time.

I really like the story in the film. It works well on a psychological level through its visions/nightmares and creates a great isolated horror atmosphere through its creepy, lonely settings. It's spooky and intense as the team scouts the ship and witness nightmarish visions; some that can be very disturbing for some viewers. The film also has many jump-scares, a few that were really effective. If you're interested in SciFi horror, this film will be over before you know it. The acting was great - occasionally, the dialogue would feel forced, but it was forgivable. The music was also great in matching the setting.

For me, at any  rate, clarity as to why things were happening, save for the theme,  that the devil made me do it, never was achieved, but I did get the idea: the ship was out to perpetrate great bodily harm on the rescue crew which came to investigate what had made it disappear years before (and reappear now).
Sam Neil and Lawrence Fishburne head the cast and do what they can to make the manifestations of  evil apparent, with Neill  bearing  the  brunt of the need for a certain amount of overacting to make real the impact of the invisible. The remainder of the cast reacts suitably to the terrible and unknown forces which are tearing them apart.

Call it a haunted house in space, call it a vengeful vessel of doom, call it a pig in a poke; it is all that and so much less.  The plot involves gathering `bodies' in one location, trapping them there, then picking them off one by one till few are left to tell the tale.  It's an overused plot device that others have turned into a viewing-goldmine.  In this interpretation however, all they managed to mine was tin.  But.  Even recognizing this as a just another pale copy of better films, there's something about it that I respond to (maybe its familiarity?).  Or, admitting that I'm more of a fan of horror than Sci-Fi; I do love things that go bump in the night or pound on a (metal) door, causing dents.  Then too, the cast is fabulous, especially Kathleen Quinlan, Joely Richardson, Sean Pertwee, and Laurence Fishburne.  Apparently, there was a stronger version of this film, heavily edited before its dismal release (it was a box office flop).  I'm not surprised it failed to grab fans initially; this must have been a nightmare to market.  A conceptual `monster' is a lot harder to promote than a thing we can see and respond to.  Turning Sam Neill (Dr. Weir) into that `thing,' late in the game, only confused matters (was he real, was he a ghost, was he some dimensional creature/creation, was he a literal manifestation of whatever haunted the vessel Event Horizon, or was he something `borrowed' from Clive Barker?).  This movie is like a rough draft with loads of potential.  I'd like to see the original unedited version but I don't suppose that will ever happen.",1367020800,,1758,4.625806451612903

Unfortunately, like a train wreck, we just kept watching.  The acting was subpar, especially the wonderful Sam Neill, who can act with his eyes alone (and as I re-read my review, I find this is particularly ironic).  Only once did I see a flicker of his skill in this rubbish.  Can there be a more trite storyline that a spaceship that is lost for years and comes home infected with an alien life that causes humans to hallucinate?  Sheesh.  That I could stand, if it weren't for the heaps of disjointed cuts (and I mean that literally) that apparently are only put in to use up the budget and our patience. And a loud, screeching soundtrack.  At least at home I could turn it down.

The plot is not the most intricate, but is a solid enough premise to drive the film. There are also some very good actors in this film. Sounds like a recipe for success right? Unfortunately, the execution was down right horrible.

My first problem with the film is character development. While the film tried to forge a connection with viewers and characters it came across as rushed and to a point just lazy. The second problem, and main downfall of the movie, is it totally loses it's identity mid-way through. It seems as the writers didn't know which direction to go, so they decided to use as much blood/body parts possible to try to scare the viewer. Very disappointing. This film almost ends as slasher/gore fest. The ending also feels very rushed with the cliched good-vs-evil show down.

I did find one line in the movie profound, ""Hell is just a word but the reality is much worse!"" It is something to consider afterwards.

The plot is straight forward but does the job. As long as you don't take the science too seriously you will like it!
VIEWER BEWARE!! There's a lot of blood and gore and pretty disturbing imagery.
The bass is really loud on this one so watch out.

924998,4,6304744404,"One does not normally watch this kind of film, but for whatever reason it caught the eye and held the mind. I will watch almost anything Sam Neill is in. Like his style, voice and the characters he plays. Here he is the designer of a type of warp drive that bends space thus creating its own worm hole. For seven years the ship has been missing. For seven years he has wondered what happened to his creation. A ship is ordered to take him to the his lost creation. Once there all a demon from Hell itself awakes from its slumber. The crew of the rescue ship becomes enmeshed in a dark tangle of horror, bent and distorted bodies, insanity, and the ever present, but invisible, Demon.

The movie is shaped around this invisible and nameless Demon, something or someone who came from the worm hole. It slowly transforms the crew driving them mad, as it did to the crew who took it from its home. This demon takes it's victims  back to it's darkened lair. But, there is something more happening. Our demon is neither benevolent or malevolent, it just is. One thinks our demon is a creation of the fears contained within the crews inner minds. Their inner demons become manifest in the horror that the ship has brought back from that hidden darkness that none can explain. Each crew member suffers their inevitable fate, horrible, gory, and filled with loud screams of agony. (But what do would you expect from a modern day horror film, pansies and roses?) The film progresses and with each iteration the body count mounts. The gore is constant, but out demon remains hidden from view.

As usual there is the inevitable battle between Good and Evil. Fishburne represents Good, and Neill Evil. In the end neither side seems to win. Both men die in a very unseemly manner. Our poor warp driven ship returns from the Hell from whence it came taking all that its victims back with it. Mayhaps there is a winner in all this. The female character survives. But does she? After being rescued and brought from hibernation she comes face to face with the Devil himself. The devil that was brought back from Hell by the ship made to traverse star systems. The devil reappears as Neill, who in typical fashion looks ghastly, and of course properly evil.

The ending leaves one hanging. Where does she go from there? Is the Devil within her mind, or an actual living breathing being? Perhaps she only had a horrible nightmare. It was all unreal, and nothing at all. We can only surmise that perhaps it was a combination of everything. Yet, it could also be nothing at all.

This film is gory, at times without rhyme or reason. Yet, the gore only enhances the horror each character goes through. There are enough twists to make it interesting, but enough foreshadowing to give the viewer an inkling of what may happen next. To date this author has seen it three times. Each time one discovers some new hidden aspect of the film. Perhaps it is nothing more then an allegory of what man is now; beastly, reckless, violent, but civilized by outside forces. One wonders what, if any of these, it may be.",1364428800,,3082,4.566003616636528

But rewatching it recently after a break of several years, it hasn't worn well.  Oh, sure, it still has a Grade A cast - I mean, look at this list.  And the special effects are still top notch.  The premise and script aren't bad, considering this genre gets a lot of leeway.

But after awhile the CRANK EVERYTHING TO 11 - MAKE IT ONE LOUDER!!! got really tiresome.  And it just escalated the annoyance level of the gimme-a-break moments.  Take a talented cast and make 'em yell for no particular reason.  Take a highly competent crew on a rescue vessel with top notch equipment and, oh, I dunno... make 'em barge ahead full steam into an inexplicable space fog toward the Event Horizon for no particular reason.  Make 'em park by destroying an antenna array for no particular reason, as if some engineer forgot to provide a proper docking arrangement.  Show the viewers in one scene a frozen corpsicle and forget to apply that same logic later when a living crew member ejects himself into space and suffers nothing worse than an eye-bleed and some screamy-meemies.

  The first time I saw this I HATED it.  I was expecting an intelligent Sci-Fi/Horror movie (like Alien perhaps?).  The flaws are numerous: annoying, a-hole characters who you want to die, including Angry Black Guy (Why in the heck was he in this? There is no way he would be allowed on a space mission let alone an important one like Event Horizon retreaval. He reminds you of the kind of guy who gets fired from his gas station cleaning job for cussing out the boss!), intelligent characters wonder off to hell following creepy versions of their family members, there is much gore, not much sense and last but not least the dimension the ship went to was hell, yes literally hell complete with suicides.
  On second viewing I realized that the movie was intended to be straight-up supernatural horror and I found myself really respecting it as such.  It creates a feeling of intense menace and inexorable fall toward oblivion. The machine is one of the best I have ever seen in Sci-Fi or horror. The viewer knows that the Sam Neil character is being influenced by his dead wife (from hell) to return to the Event Horizon and you know it is for evil intent. What makes this intriguing and sets it apart from other crappy horror is that he has not been tricked into thinking that this will be a good thing, that he will have his beautiful, living wife back and that they will live happy for all eternity. Instead he is seduced by the promise of his own (and others) destruction and torment.

I'm a reasonably intelligent woman, and the end just didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. So, I guess it should have been made a bit clearer.  But I'm getting ahead of myself, but why not, I'm not a reviewer, I just tell you what I think about one since I do like my movies.

The Event Horizon went missing, assumed lost with all hands...it was doing some shady experimental stuff with some new impulsion drive invented by Sam Neill who is six different ways shady in this one.  Larry Fishburne and his crew are a repair/rescue crew forced to abandon their projects to take up the new hunt for the Event Horizon.  In other words, as in movies like this, they are the expendable grunts the powers-that-be throw into the meatgrinder.

Naturally, Sam isn't exactly open in giving the crew a lot of information concerning what they may or may not find, and the crew feels, rightly so, a bit of angst over this so tempers flare.  Naturally they find the EH and naturally all the crew is dead, and there's the 'log' with the irksome footage of them in an all out murderous orgy of sex and bloody violence.  Then there's the super secret drive which is still running, and has supposedly been 'somewhere' and maybe came back with 'something'.  Weird and bad things ensue with death after horrific death.  Also naturally, 'something' attacks the ship the good guys (sans Sam) came on and it needs repairs so they all have to take refuge on the EH.  You knew that was coming.
So, in keeping with many movies in this genre today, we have an ending bereft of hope, ambiguous, and with serious holes.  Yes, I'm from the old school, I believe good will prevail, and I believe a well constructed story does, in fact, have an ending which has been clearly thought out,  As far as Event Horizon is concerned, I think it's poor showing at the box office confirms this.

925610,1,6304744404,"Event Horizon... hmmm. What makes this movie so good at being bad?

Perhaps its that the movie is meticulously set up in terms of likeable actors, appealing visuals, and a beginning that doesnt set off alarms. This raises your expectations somewhat. When the movie tanks, its almost completely because of the plot, and the plot collapses in on itself in ways that are interesting to analyze but not fun to watch. Here is my bulleted list of what this movie does wrong:

- Its hard to be scared of 'a force', forces are inscrutable and abstract. We never grow to understand the limits of 'the things' power, so it feels like the crew are fighting God or the Devil. Fighting an omniscient, omnipresent, all powerful force is not really a fight. There is no hope of winning. The conflicts aren't conflicts, because no one can fight back, they are just 'slaughter'. These people are essentially being slaughtered for 50 odd minutes in this film. That is not actually conflict.

- The central character is inscrutable, opaque - basically gives no clues to his mind's functioning that resonate with the viewer. His actions indicate wildly changing motivations. None of the dialogue gives us access to his inner thought process, except for rushed arguments with Fishburne's character, which can all be summed up as: ""Damn it, we're in trouble, now do what I say!"" or ""You're wrong, you must be imagining things!"" He never speaks more than four sentences in succession, nor does the camera linger on his facial expression for longer than 3 seconds - yet his psychological dynamic is almost all that is happening in terms of the character development in this movie.

- Satanic/Demonic themes are handled with no finesse. A red figure of a devil on fire emerges at one point from The Machine. It looks like a child's drawing of our collective cartoon picture of the devil. This is actually the most interesting part, since 'the force' is given a face - yet literally within five seconds, the being disappears, never to be seen again.

- Illusions/Altered perception of reality used to no real effect. When you have characters 'seeing things', 'imagining things', the suspension of disbelief in the viewer is being messed with, since we no longer know what is really happening in the movie vs. in the head's of its characters (we are being shown both). The filmmaker is 'showing us things that aren't really happening' and thus begging the question: 'OK, what are we seeing here that IS really happening?' This device has to be used with great care, or the viewer will be exhausted trying to keep reality and illusion separate in their minds. Event Horizon indulges in this device with such nonchalance, unfortunately making it the central 'trick' of this 'force'. Its exhausting, and all the tension it builds is just immediately diffused by the realization: 'Oh, it was just an illusion.'

- Sci Fi premises not handled with any flair. If were digging into the bag of sci fi tropes and topics, lets do it with style. Show me some subtlety or nuance in the approach that will justify all the baggage of the genre.

- Hectic pacing, no point of focus. This movie doesnt seem to understand that every time we jump to another scene, or shift to another barely established character's POV, or have another dialogue shouting session, we diffuse the focus of the film and lose the suspense we are trying to build. Its hard to build slow-burning tension with hectic scene changes. Yet this movie jumps from scene to scene with no pauses, no silences, something is constantly happening.

- Dialogue is always in the form of an argumentative shouting session.

Sure, parts of the film feel truly ripped from other films, films that are arguably better as a whole, but there is no denying the intensity presented here that is often unrivaled in other offerings.  I will admit that this film heavily steals from `Solaris', which is a far more intellectual and profound film (especially the 1972 original) but the horror implements help this film stand on its own, especially since `Solaris' is not a horror film.

925671,5,6304744404,"Paul W. S. Anderson was offered to direct X-MEN, but he declined that offer in order to do ""Event Horizon""- lucky for us! For me,the film was a groundbreaking confluence of space science, physics, science fiction, horror, and spirituality/religion- ""good versus evil"".

The film was originally 130 minutes in length, but the studio forced Anderson to cut it down to 96 minutes- something Anderson regrets to this day. The studio and Test audience runs of the 130 minute version proved too unnerving and disturbing as this version was much more graphic than the released version.

The film has developed somewhat of a cult status amongst its fans. Meanwhile, Anderson had promised to release a ""Director's Cut"" to include the 34 minutes worth of footage the studios forced him to cut; however, that footage was lost and only remains in lower quality video tape. Hence, no Director's Cut will ever be likely.

Despite the lost footage and Anderson having his Post-Production time cut from 6 to 4 weeks, the released version is very, very good. The movie is TRULY CREEPY; especially because of the story: It is seemingly quite plausible and,thus all the more frightening. I first experienced this film on DVD up-scaled at 1080i at home on my 46"" home theater system, alone, in the dark, and very late at night. This movie continuously and reliably sent chills up and down my spine- thanks Anderson! If a Director's Cut had ever been released I can only imagine how delightfully unnerving and disturbing it would have been!

I just watched it on Blu-Ray...Awesome... Despite its 1997 release, on Blu-Ray the improved detail, color, and sound improvements make it look so good that it seems it could have been made recently! It's hard to believe the ""Daylight Station"" scene in the beginning of the film consumed a full 1/3 of the entire budget. However, it was that footage that grabbed my attention from the start and never let go.

925673,5,6304744404,"The complaints against this movie just aren't fair. Some are saying it's too violent, too gruesome, but it simply isn't that gruesome. Yes, there's blood and gore, but it's not gratuitous, and during the most horrific scenes (the ""living autopsy"" near the end comes to mind) were censored. And, as a history lesson, this movie was massively cut and edited because test audiences felt the film was too violent in its original form. The director, Paul Anderson, constantly laments in the special features that he was forced to cut the parts he really wanted to keep in, and also that the film was made before special features existed, so the extra footage just doesn't exist anymore. It's a tragedy, because a director's cut of this is screaming to be released. Sadly, it will never happen.

This film is ultimately an attempt at a new approach toward sci-fi horror, by making the primary enemy the ship, the Event Horizon, itself, the antagonist, instead of some space monster. The Event Horizon never speaks; its only interest is in trapping Laurence Fishburne and his crew on the ship, and then returning back to Hell (literally) from whence it came. This results in an almost Paranormal Activity-style horror-fest, loaded with sequences in which people on the ship hallucinate or relive their own traumatic personal experiences. For all intents and purposes, this is a psychological thriller, as almost nothing that happens on the Event Horizon is genuine, but is instead caused by the people onboard as a result of their actions, as a response to their terrifying hallucinations.

Laurence Fishburne as Captain Miller here is really a treat. Miller isn't your average main character by any means, and Fishburne goes the extra mile to really make him special. His portrayal of the trauma-plagued but determined Miller is exceptional. His crew rounds out the cast very nicely, with excellent performances by everyone involved. Smith, Cooper, Justin, Weir--everyone does a bang-up job in their respective roles, which are varied and entertaining to follow. Everyone seems to have a backstory that is warped and abused by the Event Horizon, and the results are harrowing. Even Sam Neill as Dr. Weir is a real treat, as Neill isn't exactly known for playing the bad guy in films; but, like Javier Bardem, somehow pulls it off miraculously as a genuinely malevolent being. The difference is that Neill doesn't start out as a bad guy at all and is just a member of the crew, but later becomes the equivalent of Satan Himself due to the Event Horizon's influence on him, causing his raw hatred and resentment to manifest into pure chaos, thus dropping all good he once had and turning him into pure evil. Neill pulls all this off with a rare finesse that keeps him from being a generic villain, but someone who is genuinely tortured and influenced to destroy his own moral code for his own desperate purposes.

Perhaps most noticeable about this film is its style and incredibly advanced CG work. Don't forget, this was a film made almost 13 freaking years ago, in 1999, before DVDs even existed and special effects were insanely expensive to create (one brief opening shot of the Lewis and Clark above Earth took nearly one-freaking-third of the entire film's budget, according to commentary, due to the unreal number of constraints and problems involved in creating it to look as it does--did I mention computer animation wasn't exactly Avatar-grade at the time?). The film has a very unique style all its own, beginning and ending in peculiar fashions that are highly uncommon ways to begin and end a film. It's a treat, for sure, and the high-octane twist ending is not something anyone could possibly see coming, and yet still makes perfect sense in the context of the film.

One last thing I'd like to mention is that what really drives this film isn't the horror or the special effects, but the interactions between the characters that ultimately leads to utter insanity, along with a heroic sacrifice near the end that one normally wouldn't expect. Every character is unique, almost all have entertaining backstories that are later turned against them (often causing their deaths while hallucinating, almost like a Freddy Krueger-style dream from which you don't wake), and the film is just constructed wonderfully, with ultra-rapid-fire pacing and an undeniable style all its own.

No one's ever made a film like Event Horizon. The complaints it's being given just are not fair, and it really is one of the most entertaining sci-fi horror films made science Alien. Very highly recommended, especially given the current going price. Unfortunately, it's extremely unlikely there will ever be another version, as a director's cut is impossible and nothing else can be done to add to the film. Regardless, this is a cult classic for a very good reason.",1326585600,4,4852,4.970443349753695
925674,5,6304744404,"This movie is a masterpiece of science fiction survival horror. Unlike the majority of Paul W.S. Anderson's later work (which is disappointing at best) this movie is, I feel, one of the top five violent science fiction films of recent times (up there with Aliens, Predator, Terminator, and Pandorum.)

The plot follows a very strong and believable cast of crewmembers aboard a rescue ship. They are sent out to investigate a prototype vessel - the Event Horizon - that was equipped with a gravity drive which allowed it to create wormholes and therefore instantaneously travel to another point in the universe. The Event Horizon vanished some years prior to the beginning of the film and has only now just been discovered relatively close (in space terms). The only member of the crew on the rescue vessel that has any real familiarity with the ship is its designer and the inventor of the gravity drive, Sam ""I'm really good at playing creepy crazy people"" Neill. The other immediately recognizable actor in this film is Laurence Fishburne, who gives one of the best performances I have ever seen as the captain in charge of the rescue mission who keeps things centered even when everything has spun completely out of control. Fishburne is a talented actor and this film shows him at his best. A lot of other really incredible performances are in this movie too, including the fellow who plays the father of the nasty blond kid from Harry Potter - and his turn as a ship engineer out of his depth is intense and terrific.

From the moment you first see the Event Horizon orbiting desolate and lifeless, the movie grabs ahold of you and drags you into its world terrified and mesmerized until the very end. Are there concepts, plot points, character templates, and ideas ripped off from other movies? Yes, there definitely are. Do you as the viewer care? No, because if you are really paying attention you're too freaked out or intrigued to worry about those things. And the ""haunted house in space"" framework that the movie is structured on is REALLY well done.

In a nutshell, the reason Event Horizon is such an incredible film boils down to the fact that in its own way it is what I consider true hard science fiction - it takes a concept far outside of normal human consideration that is still theoretically possible - wormholes and spacetime eversion machinery - and builds a convincing and frightening story around it and does not candy coat it. Yes, it's violent, gory, and disturbing - in small bursts strategically timed so as to really get under your skin - my wife is still so freaked out by this movie that even though she's watched it with me twice even mentioning it to her gets her freaked out years later - but ultimately, this movie is awesome for the same reason H.P. Lovecraft's fiction is awesome. Realistically, do you think being able to do something as insane as bend space and time is just going to be an easy ride? I think not.

It's about a group of researchers that climb aboard a space vessel that happens to be haunted.  This means the actual hauntings involve toying with the emotional mindset of anyone who enters the ship.

Some of these mind games are really REALLY good (and graphic, *definitely* extremely graphic!) while other examples of horror (or science fiction as the description oh so badly wants us to believe) pertain to blood gushing from gigantic tubes and spilling and flooding the areas (which actually reminds me of a certain classic elevator scene from the Shining come to think of it).

To give another example of horror storytelling, one of those aboard the ship believes she's actually seeing her son standing at the end of a hallway and that he's in danger, so when she walks forward to investigate further... well, I won't spoil what happens, hehe.

Throughout the storyline the crew does their very best to figure out what exactly the problem is with the ship, and when it's discovered that the vessel is haunted, they do whatever it takes to get away from the danger.  Will they succeed?  You'll have to watch it and see.

I guess there are a couple problems.  The acting overall is pretty mediocre.  Nobody really jumps out as a main character either.  Everyone receives an equal amount of movie time for the most part.  The ending could have been better too (or perhaps I just wasn't expecting how the writers tied everything up).

The story is certainly intriguing enough. A space ship is lost somewhere in orbit around Neptune. The rescue crew tries their best amidst lots of casualties, the chief reason for which is the outsider that has been attached to them. None of the actors (Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neil included) is top-notch but all of them are decent enough for their limited roles. Visually the movie is impressive, even on occasion stunning. The sets of the ship and the special effects are definitely worth seeing. So is the make-up, particularly the one on Sam Neil in the end.

What downgrades the movie to four stars is chiefly the greatly overblown finale and the slightly too heavy use of gore (probably half of the budget went for red paint). Towards the end there is too much action and the explanation for the weird behaviour of the ship turns out to be a little too fanciful to be engaging - but that was before the character of Sam Neil went completely insane. Gruesome and revolting spectacles with bloody corpses don't help the matter, either.

Most of the horrific stuff is implied, which is exactly the way a good film works.  Once you show it, there's no suspense.

I'm not sure how many reviewers have picked up on this, but most of the story is borrowed from a great cinematic masterpiece called ""Solaris"", a 1972 Russian film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. At close to 3 hours, ""Solaris"" may test your patience (having to read the English in subtitles), but it is a great film experience (without all the violence and implied gore in ""Event Horizon"").",1299110400,,707,4.693548387096774

I thought the plot was pretty hokey. Some people on a spaceship embark on a mission to recover a spaceship that's been lost in space....but when they get there, they all start going nuts and see creepy bloody people and start ripping their eyeballs out. The reason for this is something so dumb that I coulda came up with it. The ""lost spaceship"" (which is generated by a supermassive black hole in the middle of it...or something like that), has gone all the way to hell and back! Wow. How scary.
Actually...that wasn't sarcasm. The ""hell"" part DID freak me out. I always imagined hell as just being this place where people sat around and cried and burned up for eternity. This movie showed it as a gorey place, with all these people oozing blood, and being eternally punished in...yucky ways.

925900,3,6304744404,"There are actually a lot of things to like about ""Event Horizon"": the sets (the bridge, the core and containment field, the medical center, the corridor, etc) are amazing, the exterior of the ship is awesome, the special, visual, and sound effects are outstanding; there are some creative aspects to the story, and Laurence Fishburne & Sam Neill deliver good performances.  When I first saw this movie, I did not know what to expect, but I knew something was up from the techno music playing during the opening credits that this may be a pretty dark movie (very well done opening title sequence by the way).  The first part of the movie delivers some stunning imagery and is very well done, and the scary scenes and some of the mild gore are effective to the story, particularly how the ship drives Weir insane with flashbacks/appearances of his wife that killed herself, etc.  This is basically a haunted house movie in space which works in many ways, but goes way too far with the gore, violence, and flashes of hell as the story progresses.  Other setbacks are weak spots in the plot and dialogue, and a re-creation of a trademark scene from ""The Shining"" that was unnecessary.  The movie is intense and the gore is so disturbing and over the top in the flashes and scene of what happened to the original crew that it is revolting and takes away from the good aspects of the film.  There really was not a need to show flashes of the Lewis and Clark crew being tortured in hell because it didn't happen.  I don't know where the ideas come from to even film such atrocities, but the story would have been fine without them.  I had nightmares for awhile after first seeing this movie in the theater and have met others who have had similar experiences.  There is a lot to be said about the art of creating violence without actually showing the full details (like the shower scene in ""Scarface"").  This movie really had the potential to be so much more, but fell short and went too far with the gore.  It's interesting to note that director Paul W.S. Anderson was forced to excise a lot more gore in order to get an ""R"" rating which probably resulted in the trimming down to ""flashes"".  The ""flashes"" still have a subliminal effect, hence the nightmares and unsettled feelings you may have after watching the movie.

The behind the scenes stuff is interesting, but lacks interviews with the principal actors.  A reoccurring theme is that director Paul Anderson and the producer seem to enjoy displaying and discussing the horrible gore that they created and express disappointment in having to cut a lot of it.  Anderson explained that he spent a lot of time filming the sequences and even called the imagery of hell ""beautiful"" which is disturbing.  This is the same guy that is now married to Milla Jovavich and has a daughter.  Test audiences and studio executives were so revolted by the gore that Anderson was forced to trim it down - twice.  Anderson and the producer poke fun that the actors were not thrilled about even filming some of that stuff.  Anderson also laments that he was unable to recover all the lost graphic scenes and restore the version he really wanted to release.  I guess the movie studio censors get it right sometimes.

The movie really has its moments and is worth a look, but be prepared for the weak spots some gratuitous graphic stuff.  I actually give it 3 1/2 stars for the good stuff.",1283904000,,3419,4.616528925619835

925903,2,6304744404,"This movie was a disappointment.  The premise was good, but poor execution just sunk it.  The overall story line is solid and that's what made me want to see it.  A ship called the Event Horizon disappears while on a mission.  You find out that it was an experimental ship that was testing a new drive system that would allow it to travel vast distances in an instant.  It would actually fold space and enter another dimension to travel.  It's this drive system that caused it to vanish.  When it reappears seven years later, a rescue team is dispatched to the far end of the solar system to investigate and search for survivors.  When they board the ship they find that some calamity occurred and the crew is missing.  Apparently the ship had entered a dimension of chaos and evil for all those years.  The ship had become a conscious entity on return.  Now, this sounds like a great plot with lots of potential.  In the hands of a good director it could have been great.  Unfortunately the script is a load of garbage.  The story becomes predictable all too quickly.  The characters are annoying as heck and you end up not caring about them at all.  The worst thing about this movie, above all else, is its obsession with gore.  The producers seemed to have spent all their time and energy on creating gory disgusting images.  It is more violent and graphic than most slasher films and for no real reason.  It adds nothing to the story.  Most of the gore has no real purpose other than to shock the viewer.  Even in the commentaries and special features the director sounds off on how proud he was of gory depictions.  He has somehow deluded himself into thinking that blood and guts are what make a movie good instead of screenplay and story.  It takes absolutely no talent at all to display gore and blood.  None.  That explains why you see so much of it in horror movies.  A bunch of no talent unimaginative directors and producers litter Hollywood.  I understand that a certain amount of it would be necessary to depict hell and chaos, but it's overkill.  Overall, this movie is not good.

925906,3,6304744404,"Event Horizon(released Aug/97)stars Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Neill in a mixture of Sci-Fi and the occult that doesn't come off as well as it should;very similar in nature to the /85 movie Lifeforce.
The story puts us in the year 2047. Years previously an explorer ship called the Event Horizon disappeared in a long range probing mission near the planet Neptune. Now the ship has seemingly reappeared and it is up to the crew of the Lewis and Clark to go out and get as much intel as possible and rescue any possible survivors. Dr Weir(Sam Neill) is along for the ride as he is the man who help design and build the EH.
The crew arrives and awakes from stasis about two hours eta from Neptune. Before coming out of stasis Dr Weir is the first one to have a strange occurrence as he hears the voice of his long deceased wife. The entire crew is now out of stasis but Dr Weir keeps his experience to himself. Capt. Miller orders most of the crew over to the EH leaving Dr Weir chomping at the bit to go himself. When the crew finally secures the EH Dr Weir is allowed over. However as time goes on the entire crew,individually and together,start to hear voices and see people they shouldn't. Things get markedly worse after an incident involving one of the crew who gets sucked into the drive core of the ship and returns in a catatonic state.
When things get too much to handle Capt. Miller orders everyone back to the Lewis and Clark but Dr Weir won't go. The EH has him under its' spell and Miller and the crew learn from him that the EH was originally designed to open up a black hole enabling it to travel instantly through space to other galaxies. However when it traveled it went into another dimension instead,a dimension filled with evil which has returned with the EH and taken it over. It now intends to take the Lewis and Clark crew back with it. The EH destroys the Lewis and Clark forcing what remains of its crew back onto the EH.
Between the EHs core and its main ship section is a corridor which the good captain nows intends to blow up. However he gets trapped in the core section with the now fully possessed Weir and is forced to dimensionally shift with him. The two remaining crew in the main EH section now return to stasis and go home. 72 days later they are found and rescued...or are they?Before coming out of stasis one of the crew has a ""dream"" that the lead rescuer is Dr Weir reaching out to take her.
The film has many good moments of tension throughout with your typical lights going out at just the right moment,objects coming into view out of nowhere,people getting trapped out in the space vacuum,etc. And the film tries to work on a psychological level throughout as the unseen force tries to manipulate each crew member with their worst fears. Having said all that however,this movie is lacking any great punch that would sway me one way or the other. It is enjoyable enough to watch but it leaves me feeling ambivalent. I know the original cut of the movie was about 1/2 hour longer than what it is now but it was forced cut due to too much length and gore. Maybe that's where the punch lies,in that unseen/unused footage.
Technically the film has been transferred wonderfully and is seen in its' widescreen aspect ratio. This is a two disc set and it contains a plethora of extras. Some of the extra/cut footage I just referred to is available here(on Disc two)but its' transfer is from not-so-good video,which apparently is the only existing format it is in now because Paramount did not keep the original film footage or any of the other extended cut footage(!).There is a conference room scene(not in the film) and two extended scenes of the medical bay hanging body and the burning body. There is also a five part making of EH,there is an unfilmed rescue scene and conceptual art,four featurettes of behind the scenes making of certain parts of the film,the theatrical and video trailer for the movie and director and producer commentary.
All in all this film,while having many decent and scary moments through its' 97 minute run,just leaves me feeling well,vanilla. The film talks a good game but the blend of Sci-Fi and the occult just doesn't have the punch it should. It would seem a fuller version of the film might have fulfilled the promises this version couldn't seem to keep. Recommended as average fare.",1276387200,,4356,4.5503184713375795
925907,2,6304744404,"In 2040, Earth launched its first deep space vessel, the Event Horizon, a ship that was supposed to achieve faster-than-light travel using nifty space-bending stuff . Instead, it never got past Neptune, where it just went dead in the water, lilting lazily to the side. Now, seven years later, a team of scrappy, reluctant pseudo-military types, led by man o' the people Captain Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and frosty intellectual Doctor Awkward (Sam Neill!), go for the rescue mission.

The rescuers do find the Event Horizon, and when they do, plasmic hell goo (literally) starts splashing everywhere, quickly followed by blood, guts and sanity. In an early scene, the laddish military types are resentful to brainy Sam Neill for dragging them into this mess - and their anti-intellectual sulking is later justified: yes, it really all was Sam Neill's fault.

Of course, in an early scene, likable tech officer Peters (a youthful Kathleen Quinlan) also likens a former crewmate to a ""corpsicle"" - and that pretty much sets the tone of this film. With utter seriousness, a sort of ultra-grim melody supplied by overachieving eyebrows, frosty irises and moody intonations, this film wallows in the most ludicrous scenarios. It seems to have no self-awareness at all; it doesn't realize how over-the-top it is. Instead, it goes for A-grade horror - something it only intermittently achieves, such as the glorious sequence in the green vent - when it should really be basking in B-grade silliness.

So should it be watched? Only at your own peril! We kind of perversely enjoyed watching it in groups when it would be on TV, if only so we could crow at Sam Neill and then make big noises of shock when the bloody stuff begins. But it's not a particularly good film, so we can't really recommend it. It seems much more intent on pushing the boundaries of gore and dressing these up in some visual references to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/better/dp/B00006L92F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">better</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/films/dp/B000UD0ESA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">films</a>, instead of, you know, investing some more thought into the plot.

925971,4,6304744404,"E.H. came and went in movie theatres in about a week, the victim of an un-evocative title, under-budgeted marketing campaign and needless confusion about what genre it belonged to. The truth will generally out, however, even in Hollywood; and so this flick has achieved a kind of cult status among fans of classy sci-fi/horror.

E.H. is the story of Dr. Weir (Sam Neill), a scientist who designs the first-faster than light spaceship, the Event Horizon. Obsessed with his creation, he so neglects his wife that she commits suicide, leaving him half-mad with grief. To make matters worse, the ship, disappears on its maiden voyage, presumably lost with all hands. Seven years later, however, a signal is suddenly received from the vicinity of the planet Neptune which indicates the Event Horizon has survived after all. A rescue ship from Earth is launched under the command of the hard-nosed Captain Miller (Lawrence Fishburne), with Weir joining the small crew (including Kathleen Quinlan and the excellent Joely Richardson) as scientific advisor. Arriving at the planet, they find the Horizon intact, but seemingly empty, which poses our heroes with two questions: where has the ship been all these years, and what has happened to the crew? Exploring the tomb-like ship, the mystery deepens. Frozen bodies...or parts of them...are discovered, but not enough to account for the crew. Records are half-destroyed. Inexplicable sounds emit from everywhere, and one by one the crewmembers begin to experience horrible hallucinations that may not be hallucinations at all. Before you know it, the rescue ship's been sabotaged and the whole lot of them are stuck on board the ghost ship with no way off and only 24 hours worth of air. All that in the first half hour. Then the murders begin...

EVENT HORIZON is a combination of many influences; stylistically it is reminiscent of Gothic horror films crossed with ALIEN (especially the ""S.O.S."" which is discovered, too late, to be a warning) but there are classic themes as well. Wier's gravity-drive represents Forbidden Knowledge, the stuff you tamper with at your peril. The ship itself is the classic Haunted House and/or Cursed Tomb, and the crew the Ten Little Indians, each of whom possesses dark secrets that are forced to the surface by the pressure of events. However, in most horror, there is a very clear dividing line between Who Is Safe and Who Isn't; in EVENT HORIZON, this line is totally obliterated. No sooner do you invest emotionally in one of the characters than they suffer a horrible and gory end. And some of those gory ends are tough to watch. While hardly a splatter-fest, E.H. isn't sparing on the red stuff when push comes to shove: we get glimpses of flaying, cannibalism, open sores, patricide, burned flesh, and decompressed eyeballs. When Captain Miller promises his crew ""Everybody goes home!"" he might have added, ""but not necessarily alive or in one piece.""

The real star of the movie is not Fishburne, Neill, or Richardson, however, but the Event Horizon herself. If I am a fan of one thing in my horror movies, it is atmosphere, and E.H. has it in spades. The production designers used an old Gothic cathedral as the basis for the ship, and between its green-lit, gray-stone-like interiors, echoey hallways and deep, brooding shadows, it has the worst elements of haunted house, hedge maze, and Dracula's castle.

The downside of E.H. rests largely in things that happen during the climax; there is some ridiculously unnecessary exposition and some badly-timed humor which really undermine the ending. I sense the interfering hand of a Studio Suit in some of Sam Neill's final dialogue. Despite this, however, E.H. is a disturbing, brutal, well-acted, beautifully designed film with a first-rate cast, and it deserves your attention.",1255996800,5,3817,5.073248407643312

As the title says, I watched it for the first time late at night by myself, which I think helped add to the experience.  For me, this is a movie I could pick and watch a few times a year and still enjoy it every time.  I wouldn't recommend it for the kids unless you want to give them nightmares.",1248998400,4,443,4.226190476190476

This movie has a unique combination of Horror and Science Fiction blended perfectly together that really makes it spooky as hell. Also this cast is awesome. The Special effects are truly amazing as in all the ""space"" movies I have seen this movie easily takes the cake in terms of looking believable. I mean seriously how did they make the spaceship look so real????

This movie is a GEM and if you haven't seen it then I suggest you pick it up RIGHT NOW and plan out a couple hours in the dark and let your mind winder into what is  EVENT HORIZON!!!!!!",1248652800,2,822,4.189873417721519

926061,5,6304744404,"Before I go off reviewing this cult classic, I'll share my personal history with this movie, which dates back nearly eleven years ago.

I remember finishing up the forth grade back in June of 1998 and my brother rented Event Horizon from the local video store at the time and I watched it with him.  When it was over, I was scared s***less the whole summer break.  Oddly enough, I kept watching the movie throughout the summer, despite the fact that it was the most terrifying movie I've ever seen (and remains so to this day).  I remember everyday from that summer, constantly fearing that a deranged Dr. Weir would break into my room and ritualistically end my existence.  Even worse, I vividly remember my brother reenacting the infamous ""video transmission"" scene by holding golf balls covered in fake blood (to look like eyeballs) and covered himself with fake blood as he was saying ""Liberate tutame ex inferis.""  Summer break eventually ended and with school starting up, I was finally able to dispose any memories I had of the movie.  Sam Neill advertised for MCI at the time and even though I knew it wasn't really Dr. Weir, I still freaked out at the sight of those commercials.  I would stay away from this movie for about seven years.  In March of 2005, me and my friends held a ""movie night"" at my best friend's place over the weekend and I quickly saw Event Horizon on the video store shelf and I told my friends ""You want to see a really messed up movie?  Watch this.""  We rented Event Horizon and all of the deliciously evil and terrifying memories flooded back to my head that night; I couldn't sleep for days.

PLOT:

For those of you new to Event Horizon, here's the lowdown.  In the year 2040, a space ship called the Event Horizon was launched to reach Proxima Centauri (Earth's nearest star) by using an artificial dimensional gateway to create a black hole, bridging the two points in space to drastically reduce journey time.  When the ship goes about on its mission, it disappears without a trace.  It's currently 2047 and the Event Horizon has returned off the orbit of Neptune.  The Lewis and Clark rescue shuttle is dispatched to investigate and salvage the ship.  As the Lewis and Clark docks with the Event Horizon and the rescue crew probes the ship, things start to go awry.

SETTING:

To me, this is the perfectly executed sci-fi/horror hybrid movie.  Why?  Event Horizon has many things going for it, but one of the best aspects is the perfect setting.  Think about it; not only does the Event Horizon have a creepy gothic interior, the ship itself is surrounded by stormy conditions in space, you're stranded because your boarding ship was heavily damaged, the Event Horizon's communication functions are shot (not able to contact for help), and the only transmission you have of the ship's original crew truly sounds like screams out of hell.  If you were aboard the Event Horizon, wouldn't you be scared?  I sure would!!

CHARACTERS:

The actors do an excellent job with their roles; particularly Lawrence Fishburne as Captain Miller, Sam Neill as Dr. Weir, Kathleen Quinlan as Lt. Peters, and Jason Isaacs as D.J.  To me, Dr. Weir is one of the best and most evil villains I've ever seen in film; so much so, I had to namedrop him on my review of Morbid Angel's ""Altars of Madness"" to describe how evil that album is.  Dr. Weir isn't some one-dimensional character that's evil and nothing else; he was originally a man of scientific ambition with his Event Horizon project but his work would cause his wife, Claire, to commit suicide from loneliness.  This would haunt Weir and when he boards his long lost creation, it would mentally torment him with his sins and drive him into a state of evil madness.  Even prior to Weir's transformation as the antagonist, you can tell there was something messed up about him when he's aboard the Lewis and Clark, playing an intercepted transmission from the Event Horizon with a straight face, despite it sounding so hellish.  Lt. Peters and Captain Miller also have interesting back stories involving Peters having to abandon her crippled son and Miller having to abandon one of his crew members on a burning space ship several years prior.  Along with Weir's sins, the Event Horizon would use the sins of Miller and Peters to torment them.  Rescue tech Cooper (Richard T. Jones) does a good job at providing a little humor in the movie to keep the audience from spiraling into states of madness; I particularly like him telling X.O. Starck as he was giving crew members coffee ""Want something hot and black inside you?""

SCARE TACTICS AND OTHER NASTY STUFF:

Unlike most horror movies that use clich settings and scare tactics to unnerve the audience, this uses much more original ideas to scare movie fans.  In Event Horizon, there's no boogeyman, no hideous aliens, and not even any physical life forms on it!!  The thing that makes this movie so scary is that it perfectly utilizes the whole ""fear of the unknown"" concept as no one investigating the ship knows what they're dealing with.  Paul Anderson's interpretation of hell is also more original, making it more unnerving.  The clich fire and brimstone imagery has been replaced with the ship's gravity drive deck filled with some of the most horrendous looking corpses ever put on film.  This brings me to my next point.  There's lots of gore in this movie, but unlike mediocre flicks like Hostel and The Hills Have Eyes, the gore in this movie is used to enhance the dark, unnerving atmosphere of the movie rather than relying solely on it.  In other words, the violence in this movie won't bore you.  The violence in this movie REALLY is disturbing; the scene where Starck and Peters unscramble the video in the ship's computer showing the original crew killing and eating each other still freaks me out to this day.  The scene where Dr. Weir attacks D.J. on the medical deck is really appalling as you can see Dr. Weir's bloody, empty eye sockets and the way he kills D.J. is guaranteed to freak out movie goers.  As Weir and Miller duke it out toward the end, Weir forces Miller to see Hell and trust me, it really is terrifying.

THEMES AND ESOTERIC THINGS:

Religion is a big theme in Event Horizon, as you can already tell with the constant mention of Hell and the use of Latin in some scenes.  The concept of creating artifical black holes to reduce time in space travel is really neat; I just hope I'm dead before technology advances that far!!  Something that I really enjoyed was when D.J.'s carcass is shown in the medical deck, there's lots of esoteric occult symbols painted everywhere.  I'm really glad that Anderson didn't use something typical like the pentagram and inverted cross to represent Hell, and the mysterious nature of these creepy symbols adds to the terror in this movie.  These symbols would also appear on Dr. Weir's body when he comes back as some sort of undead creature towards the end of the movie.  Everything in Event Horizon isn't tied up in a neat little bow, there's several little things that aren't fully explained.  I normally don't like it when movies do this as it usually comes off as laziness, but it works for Event Horizon because they do it in a manner that satisfies the viewer at the end of the movie but makes them wonder about other things.  For one, you never really see the ""chaos dimension,"" only images of people getting horribly killed aboard the Event Horizon.  So that leaves your imagination to decide what this dimension really looks like.

SOUNDTRACK:

For the most part, the soundtrack is magnificent; it perfectly fuses hard techno beats with chilling classical orchestra melodies.  The weird combination perfectly suits the movie.  The only music track I hated was the one at the very end by The Prodigies called ""Funky S***,"" it sounds bad and fits nowhere in the movie, even though it was only on the credits.

EXTRAS:

The current edition of Event Horizon has a second disk full of bonus features.  While these features aren't as abundant as say those in the T2:  Extreme Edition DVD set, they are worthwhile.  There's featurettes about the making of Event Horizon along with videos of concept art.  While I liked the conceptual drawings and 3D renderings provided in the DVD set, they could have added more and I would have preferred that each image was presented as a still frame rather than a video montage with commentary because with DVD programs like Cyberlink Power DVD that include ""snapshot"" features, I like to make ""snapshots"" of these art pieces so that I can quickly get ideas when I hit the drawing boards for my own creations.  Still, I enjoyed what I got in this area.  The ""making of"" featurettes are a real treat, they show the numerous difficulties filming the movie and the neat props and filming techniques used to make this film possible.  After watching these, I wasn't too pleased at Paramount for terribly rushing Paul Anderson and his crew to finish Event Horizon at a certain deadline.  These corporate slimeballs would also force Anderson to cut out about 40 minutes of the original edition of the movie because test audiences were too freaked out by the level of violence in it.  Some scenes were put on the bonus disk, and while pretty satisfying to see, it's a shame that they couldn't be restored into the film itself.  However, given that Event Horizon came out before the DVD revolution and that Paramount wasn't too pleased by the film's poor performance in the box office, the uncut editions of the movie have been lost.  Infact, Anderson stated he had to go all over the world to find the lost footage included on the DVD.  In short, I can't blame Anderson for this shortcoming as the blame really belongs to Paramount for their unrealistic time demands and the wimpy test audiences for their squeamishness.  All in all, the bonus disk is a nice addition to the movie.

CRITICISM:

The only bad thing I can say about Event Horizon was the song played at the end credits, which I already stated under ""soundtracks.""  This is only noticeable flaw that I could find in this movie, but it doesn't really detract the quality of the film as a whole.  Apparently, a lot of people panned this movie for being too violent and scary.  That's mind-bogglingly stupid; panning an R-rated sci-fi/horror movie for being scary and violent is like panning The Ren and Stimpy Show or The Simpsons for making people laugh.  For the people who didn't like the movie for these aspects, what were you expecting this to be?  A family film about Shaqulle O' Neal in space rapping and playing basketball with aliens?  Do your homework next time, there's ratings and content descriptions on the movie posters and DVD cases, READ THEM!!

FINAL WORD:

In Paul Anderson's filmography, Event Horizon is easily his crowning jewel.  It's really sad that he'd sink to such low levels in making such junk like Alien vs Predator and Resident Evil.  Event Horizon isn't a movie for everyone, but if you want a movie that will give you nightmares and weird things to discuss with fellow cinema buffs, Event Horizon will reward you greatly.",1242000000,19,11147,4.722193481634765

926063,5,6304744404,"What a great movie. I saw part of this about 10 years ago maybe, and then forgot about it. So I had the chance to see it again. And I didn't remember any of what I saw from before, but I was pleasantly surprised.

I think this film holds up very well for today, actually better in many ways (not to much over used computer special effects) The styling is fantastic, it's not very often  you get someone taking the time to really make very artistic sets, it's just great, the Core was awesome, I couldn't have asked them to make it any better. There where so many shots that seemed very framed and set up perfectly, it reminded me a lot of the original Alien film, but with out a ""they totally stole that from Alien"" kind of way.

I do think this movie was a bit ahead of it's time, it would have probably been better had it been made this year or 5 years from now. As like many future Sci-Fi movies, they never get the time line right, it takes place in 2047, and we have a small colony on the Moon by 2015. It should be more like living on the Moon in 2047, and the first flight of the Event Horizon in 2095 or so, that would make more sense. And I think now we have a better grasp on what technology we may have by that time.  Just think Neuro Sky + Quantum computers = Sci-Fi way beyond what we even think Sci-Fi is.

Once we do have mind controlled quantum computers it does bring us closer to the Existential Risk that this movie was really all about, How far can and should technology go? And what will it bring? In this movie it brought and unstoppable evil force, should humanity keep going in that direction or just stay where we are? This movie says stop now or else, but the fact is, it's in our blood to explore no matter the cost.

All in all this was a great film, better then I expected, and it's not a gory as some people say, I have seen far far worse, In fact I think it should have been longer with more gore, making the ship bigger and adding a little more creepy exploration would have been nice too.

I highly recommend this movie, and look up ""Neuro Sky"" because it is our future.",1240185600,2,2103,4.114634146341463
926122,2,6304744404,I was not impressed with this movie at all. There were a few parts that had you somewhat on the edge of your seat but only a few. It started out like it would be a good movie. I give them credit for being somewhat original with the plot but I still found it to be a boring and strange movie. I would expect more from a space movie than a machine on a spaceship controlling minds and killing people. It seemed like they couldn't make up their mind if they wanted this to be a horror movie or a mystery suspense movie. In the end it just turned out to be a bad movie.,1239753600,,565,3.9217391304347826

926124,3,6304744404,"A recent review insprited me to take a second look at this movie. While its horror elements are more of a hat tipping to the film maker's favorite horror movie moments - something I found annoying in the film's original theatrical release - there is a lot to appreciate about the film once you accept this as a feature and not a flaw. The film has wonderful  set, sound, lighting, effect, ship, and atmosphere design and terrific performances. The blu-ray transfer is sweet in the both video and audio categories. If you like horror you won't find anything new here, and the promise implied in the first two acts isn't delivered on in the third, but if you appreciate the craft of filmmaking, an interesting and enjoyable atmosphere, and good performances in a sci-fi setting, you may want to check this one out.",1236038400,,812,4.678321678321678
926125,5,6304744404,"It seems that this is one of those movies that people either love or absolutely despise it.  In my own group of friends its always been that way.  Myself, I'm a fan of the movie, and have been since it came out in theaters and on VHS.  I still own the 2-Disc special edition on DVD.

Story-
Essentially the story (where most people love or hate it) revolves around a crew of rescue techs that are sent on a code black assignment to a ""lost"" ship.  The ship itself can create black holes that can transport the ship to the most distant regions of the Universe.  An idea I find interesting because scientists are already theorizing how to create wormholes to different parts of space so for me it adds some realism to something that theoretically could happen.  If you can't buy into this idea at all, you'll hate the remainder of the film.  As the story progresses the horrors of the ship are revealed in many different fashions.  This is the other part people seem to love or hate.  Most deaths are quite grisly and can involve a bit of squirming on the viewers part.  As well, some of the scares come from quiet moments followed by loud noises or a door suddenly opening, some people find this tacky.  To me, the most frightening bit is what isn't even shown.  Where the ship went.  I still wonder what it looks like!

Presentation-
The Blu-Ray presentation of this film is quite good considering the age of the source material.  Early on, the edge enhancements can be seen easily in the motion of the crew moving around.  This quickly goes away.  The CGI effects have aged nicely and the high def treatment doesn't really give them away.  The black levels come through nicely.  The color palette is dark.  Ideally its supposed to be this way, considering the tone of the film, so don't expect the colors to necessarily jump off the screen.  The explosions in particular the sparks look leaps better than they did on SD.

Sound-
The sound track to the film stays constant throughout the picture.  Loud when it should be and doesn't drown out the actors voices during the more chaotic sequences.  The screams and creepy voice of the man-thing speaking in Latin come through excellent.

Extras-
The extras are the same as from the 2-Disc Special Edition which include a comprehensive commentary with the director, a few making of specials and an un-filmed storyboard sequence that was cut from the final process.  All of these are presented in SD.  The only HD special feature is the theatrical trailer.

Having grown up playing Doom, it was great to see what basically is the same plot but in live action and not as cheesy as the Doom movie was. The special effects hold up very well and the direction of the film is great. A lot of tension and suspense.

As far as the Special Edition is concerned, fans of the movie such as myself, will be pleased at the amount of attention spent on a movie over ten years old. Film documentary watchers will have plenty to watch and the deleted scenes are interesting to see without the special effects placed in. A good amount of content for film enthusiasts.",1232323200,,666,4.5966386554621845

I picked this up locally the day it came out. Now you bought your Blu-ray player for jaw dropping visuals one would assume. This movie will NOT give that to you. That being said, the movie is a lot sharper on Blu-ray, the colors are more distinguished, and you will notice more in the background. The truly impressive visuals are found in the warp drive - spike ball, gyroscope engine drive thing. There is a grainy look to the film as well.

If you've been a fan of this movie by all means purchase it. It's a unique film, a piece of art in my opinion and well worth the money.

926222,5,6304744404,"To me, this is a great horror. I find it hard to enjoy horror movies today (today is Dec 12, 2008) because all they are are gore fests with half naked women. I love this movie because for one thing it does not derive its ""fear-making"" from BOO! haha you jumped, but rather it slowly gets you into the movie and begins to play with your mind. It is rather gorey, though there are worse (such as Lord of Illusions). This movie will not disappoint, unlike current horrors today that can only scare grandma's and people with weak stomachs. Buy this and prepare to crap your pants!",1229040000,,576,4.392523364485982
926223,5,6304744404,Just what I was promised from Amazon and could not find this even at Blockbuster or Wal Mart.,1227571200,,93,4.222222222222222
926224,4,6304744404,"When I first saw the movie in theaters, I was disappointed by it after being hyped up by various movie sites and magazines. I was waiting for this one with bated breath and when I finally saw it, I was simply let down. It didn't really do it for me for various reasons, the main one being that the film felt somewhat mangled, as if they cut out all the gore that had been promised and excised what were probably important parts of the plot as well.

Recently, my girlfriend reintroduced it to me and upon watching it again, I came to realize that this flick is pretty decent and has a lot more going for it than I initially thought. It's not the greatest horror movie ever and still has a few weak points that keep it from being so but it's certainly entertaining and definitely disturbing, to say the least. Some of the imagery in this film kind of sticks in your head and the film has a great look to it, with pretty decent production design work.

This 2-disc dvd is under $5 and what you get for that little bit of cash is worth much more than that. There's a really good documentary on the second disc that is over two hours long and covers a lot of ground on the film's making, also going into the specifics of the film and why it was so badly received upon its release. I think that I appreciate the film even more now after watching it and it provides fans with probably the most definitive word on it, other than the director commentary on the film which is available here as well. There were rumors of an extended cut that reinstated plot points and even more blood and gore but it doesn't look like its ever gonna happen for reasons that are explained in the documentary. A sad thing, as I know many people were excited about the prospects of such a cut, myself included.

The film is presented much more cleanly than in the featureless single disc DVD that was released a few years ago and also has an option for DTS Surround, so no complaints there. The DVD also contains a couple of deleted scenes and featurettes, all entertaining for the few minutes that they run.

Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill alone are worth watching the movie for and both turn in solid performances and while the film isn't necessarily jump out of your seat scary, its more of the crawling feeling underneath your skin scary. Like I said before, this isn't the greatest horror movie in the world but its more than passable and well worth a look if you enjoy horror movies* and never got to catch this one.

(*On a side note, anyone who likes this film should check out the videogame Dead Space as the film definitely influenced that game in a number of ways and believe it or not, is pretty scary in itself.)",1227484800,,2699,4.357852882703777

926226,4,6304744404,"This is a great film which is not worthy of the a lot of the bad reviews that it has gotten here. It's an excellent blend of science fiction and traditional horror fantasy that provides a tense atmosphere that holds up throughout the entire movie. It rarely shows you the ""why"", rather showing you the aftermath of what has happened which is a main part of the story and of good film making. You are never shown what has happened to the ship, only explained here and there and then are left to let your imagination take over from there which is where the most horrific monsters reside. As for the blood, there are some gruesome scenes in this movie, but it definitely doesn't cross any lines as such movies as Hostel or Hellraiser. Most of the time these scenes are quick and only show the reactions of the characters, again leaving your mind to do the rest. The sets add a lot to this atmosphere, though sometimes they look almost alien which does add a horrific feel to the movie but makes you wonder if humans actually made this ship and if they did why did they design it that way.

This story, though with it's flaws, is good and has given birth to other, newer Hollywood blockbusters. The idea of bending time and space was reused 10 years later in Deja Vu with Denzel Washington, the entire framework of this story was reused in Sunshine. It definitely has a lot going for it. Though with all it's potential you have to ask yourself why or how things are happening at some point, and that's where the story breaks down. I can assume certain things happen because of otherworldly things, but some of the things that happen in this movie defy that. These moments don't happen a lot though. I also thought some of the acting, specifically by the character Cooper, was cheesy and out of place. Luckily, a majority of the acting was good.

All said, it's a great movie to watch and now that it's about 10 dollars for a two-disc set you can't go wrong.",1224460800,,1953,4.437325905292479

926312,5,6304744404,"Fear chills the most when you are not expecting it.  When you put this film in the DVD player for the first time, you believe you are going to watch a science fiction movie that might have a bit of suspense involved.  That is not the case.

Very shortly, the plot begins to subtly darken, and at first, you are invited along slowly, wondering where things are going as you begin to feel things might go wrong.  As the events pick up, right when you decide to remember it is just a movie, the film siezes you by the wrist and drags you inside it's hellish world.  The pace of the film picks up speed, accelerating all the time as the plot continues to darken.  You are not allowed to remember it is just a movie, you are pulled even deeper as things turn horrific, pausing only briefly to hammer in the truth of the matter...  There is no turning back...

You want to turn it off, but it won't let you.  You want to leave, but there is no escape.  This film really puts you in there with the characters, like no other film I have watched.

There is plenty of gore, but it's brief, just long enough to sink into your mind and let your imagination fill in the horrific blanks.  The movie preys on nightmares.

A decent understanding of modern physics makes this film even more terrifying, as none of the plot mechanics are neccessarily fiction.  The story may not be real, but nothing in it is impossible, none of the science is entirely made up for the movie, and there is no law saying this cannot happen.

Many people have given this film poor reviews.  Some were expecting Star Trek, heck, lots of us were.  That is one of the films biggest strengths, as you do not know what you are getting into, much like the characters.  Some people say it is inaccurate, but they are misinformed.  Some people say it is satanic.  These people probably still think Led Zeppelin is satanic.  Some say there are holes in the plot, but those holes are there for your imagination.

In the end, this is intellectual horror.  You have to have a brain to understand it.  You don't so much enjoy this movie as you dread it.  This is not a film you watch with the family, or even a film you watch for entertainment.

This is a movie that you watch when you need to be seriously frightened, when you want to remember what it was like as a child, staring into that shadow in your closet...  Knowing beyond question that something horrific was in there, waiting for you to fall asleep, and somehow, the fact that you never actually saw it... Well, that made it much, much worse.

Go ahead.  Turn the lights down, and watch it alone, in surround sound, on a powerful audio system, with a nice big screen, at midnight.  I dare you.",1214956800,8,2705,4.352
926313,5,6304744404,"This movie ranks as the scariest I've ever seen. I saw it when it first came out, then again a few years ago. I think it's the combination of the inability to escape, unknown evil, and nothing you can physically fight that combine to make it so frightening. Plus the situation is at least somewhat plausible.

Highly recommended if you don't want to sleep well.",1214092800,,361,4.553846153846154

Now, in 2008, I go back to it, and although I've gotten used to the fright scenes, it still gives me the frights. I surprisingly didn't find ""Exorcist"" scary, but this one took me to a darkest wonderland I ever saw.

Sam Neill, Lawrence Fishburne, and the supporting cast give very good performances, and the special effects look only a tad unrealistic. The silence (and the ""jumpy"" music) that make up the creepiest scenes are quite effective. The storyline (and the astronomy that's central to the plot) might be a bit confusing to some viewers.

Overall, it's one hell of a horror/sci-fi flick.",1213574400,2,724,4.692913385826771

Granted, the shower'o'sparks gets a little old, and the loud noises to make you jump are annoyingly predictable. Still, the balance of sets, special effects, music, and acting all create something unique.

The closest thing I've ever seen to it is ""Hellraiser - Bloodline"". One could say it pre-dated and predicted the rise of a new genre of sci-fi, and that is sci-fi as a shell or setting in which to explore something decidedly un-sci-fi. Soderbergh's treatment of ""Solaris"", Aronofsky's ""The Fountain"" and then Boyle's ""Sunshine"" all represent a further exploration in this vein, though do it with far better results.

""Event Horizon"" is typical Paul W.S. Anderson, and yet I find myself re-watching it every six months in spite of that. Worth your while if you like sci-fi, horror, and don't mind a little camp mixed in.",1211500800,,1002,4.923076923076923
926316,4,6304744404,"There's a long list of films ruined by people who said ""Chop this, edit that, blah blah blah"".  Three in particular come to mind instantly:

Dune (david lynch) - With an original running time approaching six hours, Frank Herbert gave the workprint his blessing.  The 90 some-odd minute theatrical release, however.....

Legend - A barely laughable film until the extended version with the non-modified soundtrack came out.  Now it's truly worthy of it's title.

Waterworld - Who out there ISN'T asking for the original intended release as shown on the Sci Fi channel, but with the language, gore, and nudity reinserted?  The film is very enjoyable in it's full length.

Well, regretfully ""Event Horizon"" was subjected to the same celluloid-emasculation.  The ""Hell"" sequences started as mere flashes, but by the end of the film we would see them in all their entirety and horror.  Evidently, shooting those scenes was incredibly traumatic for the actors/actresses.  The film would have had a running time well over 2 hours and, in the pre-""Hostel"" era, would have been by far the most disturbing, terrifying, and graphic film of it's time.  Quite likely the most terrifying space-horror film since the original ""Alien"".

The film itself, while flawed due to it's forced-editing, is beautifully filmed and very unnerving.  The characters act exactly as you would expect.  The film follows a very steady pace with lots of mystery and theory.

And then there's Sam Neil.  I can think of a better actor to descend into that kind of madness.  He and Lawrence Fishburne are simply outstanding in this film.

This is an overlooked gem worthy of another glance, especially on DVD now.  Go see it for yourself.

And put in a request for a blu-ray version while you're at it.

And maybe a petition to reshoot the lost footage :).  If I had a few million dollars to burn, I'd pay for it myself just to see it.

926318,3,6304744404,"Event Horizon scored about 3 stars overall in my book.  I felt that the beautiful and elaborate sets rated a full five stars for originality while the plot and dialogue were worth only about two.  The story was a poor mixture of Black Hole, Hell Raiser, The Shining and Night of the Living Dead and stole from an entire class of previous sci-fi films which dealt with black holes, including Disney's Black Hole.

While many of the visual images are very original, such as the exterior and interior views of the Event Horizon spacecraft, a good portion was ""borrowed"" from Hell Raiser and The Shining. The shocking scene of a crewman hanging from chains was definitely stolen from Hell Raiser and the huge avalanch of blood was inspired by Kubrick's Shining. Though very effective, even some of the shots removed from the final cut were borrowed from The Exorcist according to the film documentary included with the DVD box set.

The documentary also made clear to me that the producers of Event Horizon were hung up on visual images, special effects and the basic setting of the film and felt that these elements were sufficient to make for an enjoyable film.  I think they needed more work on a good plot and script.

Here are a few choice lines of dialogue:  What the ""f"" are we doing out here skipper? You know, someone drops the ball, we get the call. Are we ready for departure? Everything is cocked, locked and ready to rock. All green on my screen skipper.  Get the point? The film was very quickly off to a bad start after only a few lines that sounded like poor rap.

There were a couple of enjoyable characters, but Sam Niel's performance absolutely made the film for me. I felt that all the actors gave good performances but were limited by the script. After seeing this movie I felt that a group of world class set designers and very talented special effects people needed more of a story to tell.

Given a slightly more original and well written story this film had the technical and acting talent to make for a very exciting sci-fi experience. All it needed was a good writer to make it all happen. No matter how excellent the acting and special effects people are, great science fiction film still requires a good story and script.",1208131200,2,2246,4.5925

That makes it admittedly hard to be impartial, because what you do get is a gore fest that must have exhausted Hollywood's supply of fake blood for months.  The bad part is that this goulash of gruesomeness is by and large pointless, other than to shock and disgust the viewer.

A rescue ship is sent to find the Event Horizon, an earlier space craft that was launched and then vanished.  It is found indeed, and (it's never quite clear) turns out to have gone to Hell and back, literally, or at least to some warped dimension.  The ship is possessed.  To further complete this religious image of hell and horror, the captain of the Event Horizon even spews a little Latin while the screams of the damned surround him on a record found by the rescuers.

There was trouble right off the bat in the movie when the rescue ship nearly rams the EH.  Hey guys, if you read the ship on your sensors but can't see it through all the nebulae, slow down.  Further making it hard to take this movie seriously, other than the endless butcher shop scenes, is its characters' actions.  If you've left your son on earth and you're  now at the other end of the solar system, and yet you see him running around on the EH, get a clue.  He ain't really there.

It's legitimate to criticize the movie for its firehose-connected-to-a-slaughterhouse scenes because they're so gratuitous, unlike the mess in ""Saving Private Ryan"" or even ""300.""  Because I'm afraid my disgust at the blood-soaked dementia portrayed in the movie might unfairly bias me, I err on the side of generosity and give it three stars, barely.

926462,4,6304744404,"Even though the movie as a whole could have been a lot better, I gave it a strong rating because I think it's such an interesting premise.

In 2040, the Event Horizon, a ship whose purpose was to do deep space research, disapears without a trace. The entire crew is presumed dead and the public explanation is the ship was destroyed as the result of a reactor that went critical.

Seven years later, the ship suddenly reappears near the place it was last seen, in orbit around Neptune. The reappearance is accompanied by a strange transmission that at first doesn't make any sense.

Search and Rescue Ship, The Lewis and Clark, and its crew are sent to investigate although they aren't told much more about their mission. Dr. William Weir, the scientist who designed the ship is sent to accompany the crew.

As the Lewis and Clark nears Neptune, they learn the real reason for the mission. Dr. Weir explains to them that the story behind the Event Horizon was a cover up. The truth is that after a completely uneventful trip, the ship simply disapeared shortly after they engaged the experiemental engine that Weir designed. The experimental engine was designed to ""fold space"" by creating a black hole. The idea was that this tehnology would allow the ship to travel almost instantaneously to places in the universe that were light years away. The Lewis and Clark's crew are skeptical and wary of the doctor's explanation saying that faster than speed of light travel is impossible.

Once docked to the Event Horizon, three crew members board to do a preliminary exploration. Things start to go wrong immediately. Engineering crew, Justin, goes into the engine deck and the gravitation drive, on it's own, opens the dimensional gateway, pulls Justin in, and sends an explosive wave that destroys part of the Lewis and Clark's hull making the ship uninhabitable. This forces the entire crew onto the Event Horizon which has oxygen and life supprt while the Lewis and Clark is repaired.

The remainder of the movie is about things going from bad to worse to life and sanity threatening. The crew including Dr. Weir begin experiencing very real-seeming hallucinations drawn from their very worst experiences and feelings. Weir sees his dead wife who committed suicide due to his obsession with work, Miller sees a subordinate who he left to die in an on-ship fire, Peters sees her crippled son with twisted, gangrenous legs, and Justin tries and comes very close to committing suicide in a depressurized air lock.

One element that makes the movie so disturbing and scary is in the way you feel like you're experiencing the crew's terror and pain. The airlock scene where Justin suddenly awakens from his catatonic state and becomes aware that the airlock will be fully depressurized in 30 seconds is horrible and painful to watch. He begs them to open the door as the effects of depressurization (basically, our skin can no longer contain our blood and organs) begin and the crew can only stand and watch his suffering helplessly.

And then the movie gets even gorier and more disturbing.

One point that reviewers who hated the movie seemed to miss (although I may be totally wrong on this score) is that that violence, pain, and gore was gratuitous. My take was that the Lewis and Clark crew was being slowly integrated into what the ship had become.

So what *did* happen to the Event Horizon? The answer is never really fully explained but according to Weir (who has gone completely insane and sys he now is part of the ship), the gravitational drive went beyond folding known space and actually ""tore a hole in the fabric of our universe into another dimension of pure chaos, of pure evil.""

If you don't apply traditional definitions to what Hell or Heaven actually are, did the ship really ""go to Hell?"" My take is that it went to a dimension that is so entirely different from ours that by our definition it *is* hell.

Towards the end of the film, the ships log video which shows the crew at the moment before the gravitational drive is engaged and suddenly goes fuzzy, begins to play showing what happened the moment after the gateway opens and it looks hellish. Crew membes who moments before were grinning shyly at the camera as the captain thanked them as now disemboweling themselves, being raped, and screaming in pain and terror while they seem unable to stop themselves. The captain seems to be struggling with all his might to hang onto a shred of sanity gouges out his eyes and sends the final transmission, Liberate tutemae ex inferno ""Save Yourself from Hell.""

There are lots of loose ends in this film and although it would be more satisfying if they were addressed I don't think it diminishes the effect of the film that they are not. There is the question of whether the first crew and Lewis and Clark crew members are really dead or somehow alive and being eternally tortured in another dimension. Of whether the Event Horizon is really gone. There's also the question that when the three surviving members are found by a rescue team, that anyone will get off alive (at the end you see the door hatch closing as rescue members are reviving them).

I loved the Alien films and although Event Horizon is not at their caliber, it is still at times elegant, well-acted (although I found Sam Niell's character to be more annoying than menacing), and really, really scary. If you enjoyed movies like The Exorcist, Hellraiser, Alien, and The Shining, I highly recommend Event Horizon.",1172880000,26,5502,4.777894736842105

926465,4,6304744404,"Hard to believe it will be ten years since the release of EVENT HORIZON, a sci-fi/horror/thriller movie which made its' debut at the multiplex in August, 1997, and was promptly reviled by film critics and audiences alike because it wasn't the film they were expecting.

Although the ""haunted house"" genre has been portrayed in movies over the years, audiences weren't prepared to see a ""haunted house in space"" movie, which is exactly what EVENT HORIZON is. Those who expected a warmed-over, glossy, cliched retread of STAR WARS or STAR TREK may have been thrown off by the dark, foreboding spacecraft itself, and the motley crew of the rescue ship which has been sent to investigate the Event Horizon's mysterious reappearance after it was reported missing (and apparently destroyed) in the year 2040.

There are no ""shiny, happy people"" among the crewmembers of the U.S.A.C. Lewis & Clark, the search and rescue spacecraft (which itself is anything but shiny) assigned to investigate and salvage the Event Horizon. The crew, headed by Captain Miller (played by Laurence Fishburne), is a hard working, world-weary (or in this case, space-weary) group looking forward to some badly needed R&R, but who are sent out to investigate the sudden reappearance of a spaceship which had been declared destroyed seven years earlier. To further complicate matters, the creator of the Event Horizon, Dr. William Weir (played to creepy perfection by Sam Neill), is an unexpected (and unwelcome) guest. When Capt. Miller and the crew learn that the Event Horizon's ""explosion"" was a government cover-up in order to hide the fact that the spaceship was outfitted with a new, untested ""gravity drive"" which creates a black hole which allows the ship to travel through a dimensional gateway, their mission changes dramatically.

When Miller, Dr. Weir and the Lewis & Clark crew investigate the ship, some very weird things start happening that get more intense as time goes on. This is where EVENT HORIZON stands out, because the ""monster"" (if you want to apply that designation to the spaceship) is unseen. Instead, the horror is more psychological than an actual ""ooga-booga"" monster, which adds to the emotional intensity of the film. Screenwriter Phillip Eisner  allows the audience to experience the briefly glimpsed terrors through the crew of the Lewis & Clark, as well as through Capt. Miller and Dr. Weir. We see how the ship affects each crewmember in various ways which are unexpected and scary. Both Dr. Weir and Capt. Miller are troubled men; they're carrying a very heavy load of guilt because they must deal with the deaths of someone they knew, which adds depth to how they interact with each other during the course of the film.

Moviegoers who'd become used to the classic ""hero saves himself, the day, and everyone else"" cliche got a rude shock when Capt. Miller confronted Dr. Weir in the final battle for the last survivors of the Lewis & Clark, and he saved the day, all right, but it cost Miller his life. Perhaps this defying of a time-honored movie genre unsettled audiences and caused them a bit of discomfort, but if the ending had gone the way of the obvious cliche, it wouldn't have worked for the mood of the film.

The look of the film is suitably scary, with the Event Horizon serving as the ""haunted house"". Hidden corners, dark shadows, occasional flashes of lightning and rumbles of thunder, cruciform shapes at every turn, a coffin-shaped entryway, and an interior which is both spacious and claustrophobic adds a pefect touch to the overall mood and tone of the story. The cinematography (by the late Adrian Biddle) is suitably atmospheric, the special effects are top-notch, and the acting by all of the cast members is believable and good enough to keep your interest.

Yes... EVENT HORIZON is a better-than-average grade B horror flick, with an intriguing charm which makes it worth watching.

926469,5,6304744404,"Let me start by saying that most people who watch this film are of one of two types: 1. the type that expect the movie to fall solely into the traditional sci-fi genre, or 2. the type that are devotees of traditional sci-fi and dislike horror despite knowing that is an element of Event Horizon.

Event Horizon is NOT a sci-fi movie. It is primarily a horror movie that uses futuristic space technology as an original plot element (the closest movies I can think of are The Thing and The Abyss).

Don't be fooled if you are a horror fan - this movie is AMAZING. The acting is incredible, the plot is great, and the script is intelligent. Event horizon was panned by many critics including Roger Ebert. One of Ebert's central criticisms involved the supposed stupidity of the film, the claimed epitome of which was a scene where Sam Neil gives a ""silly"" explanation of space travel exceeding the speed of light. What Ebert fails to recognize is that the scene also serves to provide increased involvement for the supposed year that the movie takes place (Neil uses a centerfold from the year 2047) and serves as character development (the centerfold belongs to a crew member who is upset because Neil pokes holes in her... it helps to humanize the otherwise stoic crew).

Prior critiques aside, this is one of the scariest movies you will ever see. This is coming from someone who has seen virtually every theatrical horror release in existence and many direct to dvd/vhs releases as well.

The blu-ray quality is also GREAT. I read a couple of reviews that said the upscaled DVD is just as good. Um.... I'm watching this on a 46 inch LCD and I can assure you that it far exceeds the most recent widescreen DVD release and FAR exceeds the initial DVD release (which was not truly widescreen). Anyone who doesn't think so is either not discerning or has a small screen.

In summary, I can't recommend this movie highly enough. I enjoy all genres of film but really appreciate being terrified. If you also like being terrified, I promise you that you will not be disappointed! I know many highly educated people who love this movie... don't believe the critics who only attempt to act enlightened with their narrowly focused journalism degrees (at best).",1163203200,,2251,4.688607594936709

My dad finally talked me into seeing this movie and I'm sure glad he did! For one, the acting was good. Laurence Fishburne has been in a few lousy movies but he displayed good acting ability in Event Horizon. I would say this is his best role next to Matrix. Sam Neil, Joely Richardson (spelling?), and Jason Issacs all did a good acting job as well. Event Horizon starts out as a military space hunt set in the distant future and halfway through the film there is a serious plot twist though I won't reveal what it is. For those of you who have not seen this before, you won't know what to expect but that is a good thing. Of course, you might spoil the film for yourselves by reading the reviews below. As for the DVD features, the documentaries are good but not worth viewing more than once. The deleted scenes are few and not that great. The picture quality for the deleted scenes are terrible. Plus, I am aware that there was nearly 30 minutes of footage taken out of the film due to gore and pacing though I am not a fan of gore scenes. Anyway, I have seen Event Horizon three times and am still perplexed by the second half of the movie. Not surprisingly, the critics bashed this movie but who really cares what the critics say?

926528,4,6304744404,"This is a fascinating idea for a horror movie. Unlike Jason X (yes, you can laugh), this is a true horror film set in space. Set in the year 2047, the crew of the Lewis & Clark, along with Dr. Weir, set out to investigate the Event Horizon: a ship that disappeared for seven years somewhere in space and suddenly reappeared in the orbit of Neptune.

The Event Horizon (designed by Dr. Weir) provides the desolate and haunting setting for the movie. The darkness, the unknown and the inability to escape create a real sense of desperation aboard the ship. There is literally nowhere to run in space, which adds to these feelings of dread. The crew slowly begins uncovering the mystery of where the Event Horizon had been for the past seven years. During this phase of the movie, we are shown some horrifying images, conjured by the ship itself. These images play on the fears, memories and even the guilt of the crew members. There are some freakish occurances leading to the ultimate discovery of the truth about the ship and what actually happened to the original crew.

As for the horror genre, this movie represents something different. It's a good departure from the slasher movie or the ""teens go on a road trip, break down and are terrorized by a madman"" movie... The fact that it is set in space is rather unique and, I feel, works quite well. Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill give great performances.

Because Mortal Combat was a commercial success, they let Anderson pick the cast and crew and it's always a good sign when a director has true artistic control of a movie.  I don't like to rehash the plotlines in my reviews, so I'll get straight to it.  Laurence Fishburne provides a great presence in this film.  As the skipper of the rescue mission, his performance provides a very strong and believable lead - similar to the strong leadership he portrayed in The Matrix, sans the religious/spiritual undertones of Morpheus.  Robert Weir has always kind of creeped me out since his role in Omen III as the grown up version of Damien.  His transformation in the film is haunting.  The other cast members are very good as well.  I think Anderson says it best in ""the making of..."" special features when he says a good horror movie is characterized by the reaction of the protagonists to the ""monster,"" not really the monster itself.  He said that all of the best horror films tend to shy away from showing the monster or bad-guy and instead let the viewer use their imagination.  He wanted to incorporate this idea into Event Horizon.  Well, it definitely works.  The genre mix of sci-fi and horror ala Hellraiser + Alien forms a very serviceable hybrid.  After his transformation, Robert Weir bears a striking resemblence to Pinhead from Hellraiser, which was very surprising.  He normally doesn't do these types of roles, and maybe he should do more of them because he did a great job in this film.  From Alien, this film inherits the coldness, despair, and lonliness of space as well as the slow movie pacing associated with the beginning of that film.  I just wish they would have developed the Chaos dimension a little bit more.  Where has the Event Horizon been for the last 7 years?  Why is it here in our solar system now?  The ship seemed dormant when they boarded it for the rescue mission - why did it choose Neptune to camp out and wait to be found?  Why didn't it just go into orbit around earth if it wanted to find new victims?

By the way, there have been much gorier films made in the horror genre that people embrace. I think the biggest mistake is to classify this film as Science Fiction. Whis is an overused term anyway.

Films such as Resident Evil and Alien vs Predator are quite loathed even though the films tend to have its fans. Most people tend to agree that Event Horizon is probably his best and while to some people that's like saying a paper cut is better than a kick to the balls, it is one of his better ones even though it does have quite a few flaws.

In the year 2047, a ship which had disappeared  7 years prior, the Event Horizon has been found in the orbit of Neptune. A crew is sent for a search and rescue and upon finding it they will find out where exactly the ship disappeared to and what it brought back with it.

When you see the R rating, you better believe it, this is not a case of an R rating that seemed uncalled for. Language is of course in here but there's gore in here and plenty of it. You should especially get acquainted with your freeze frame function as a lot of quick flashes of gory scenes go by particularly quickly. I believe it's pretty much the same cut as the original so it's not the ultra gory version.

One thing that most people will tend to find with Anderson's movies that as polarizing as they are on a film standpoint, they tend to have very cool visuals and ideas. It's certainly a cool looking movie, including one neat scene where it's essentially green computer motherboards which is kinda like the Matrix. The Hitchcock zoom is quite nice too. Comparisons to Alien will most likely be seen, especially considering cinematographer Adrien Biddle worked on Alien and Aliens.

The extra features are slightly disappointing, especially the effects one. It's essentially 2 guys going ""well, this is how we did the film, this was a hard problem"" but we don't see anything besides the rare footage of effects. At least show us what you're talking about.

I already had bought the first DVD release and was looking forward to seeing deleted scenes put back into the movie. This release IS better though as you get a very nice looking anamorphic version and you get DTS which sounds sweet. But this still is the original.

The second disk contains a good making of documentary and some other supplemental behind the scenes stuff however the best part of this disk is the deleted scenes and after listening to the commentary it soon becomes apparent why there won't be a directors cut.  Also the quality of these deleted scenes are terrible. The print is covered with pen markers and edit markers and looks like its been made by a first year film student.

You find out that a lot of the ""CUT"" stuff was actually from different versions of the movie that was used during screenings to help gauge reactions from the audience and could no way be re-integrated into the film.

Also, because this movie was made in the pre-DVD era the studio dumped a lot of the deleted stuff away as it was envisaged that none of this would ever see the light of day again. One example is the deleted crew torture sequence which was to be part of when weir was showing hell to fishburn. However this no longer exists on film and is only on poor quality video.

So, to sum it up what you have here is this.

IN A NUTSHELL IT IS 2040, Dr. Weir an inventor and physicist has worked for years to construct and model a ship tp be able to jump hyperspeed and move faster than the speed of light.

The problem was being able to devise a way to do this. The physicist then creates the ""Event-Horizon"" in order to accomplish this feat. One problem, unbenowst to the creator,( DR.

This evil, yes, although is somewhat privy to that of Hellraiser, is not the same, they are far more differences than similarities!

This evil is more like that of ""micheal crichton's sphere, Where it plays upon people's worst fears, or ""darkest secret's"" and regrets within their  own life. Which ultimately creates anyone who board's the ship to ultimately turn on and against eachother.

Because the ship is alive of a purest of evil, and has been to hell and back, this evil preys on distrust that is created by the pure evil within the ships confines, and runs amuck, within the crew itself.

 This evil has tainted the ship over literally covering its walls with blood itself because it is so pure and evil,( think the shining, by stephen king) the ship is ""alive"" (think ghost-ship)and takes on a mind of it's own.

This evil is what the last reviews failed to step-up to the plate and describe in full detail. Mabey because I infer that they cannot begin to fathom the intricicies and complicated plot the moview implies.",1137801600,,2385,4.832923832923833
926590,5,6304744404,"""Event Horizon"" gets my nod for being the most terrifying gorefest movie that I have ever come to watch. However coming from someone who despises horror genre for being mindless gorefests, ""Event Horizon"" is in my honest opinion, the greatest horror film that I've ever seen. I mean, when I first saw it back in 1997, I mean, for someone with a nerve of steel and titanium alloy scared the daylights out of me like ""Event Horizon"" did and that's saying a lot there! Yet, it does so in an efficient way and just simply is one of the best sci-fi movies of the 1990s and among my top ten favorites in this genre.

 In the year A.D. 2040, a top-secret spaceship named ""Event Horizon"" is sent out on a trip into deep space. The ship is powered by a super gravity drive that when activated creates a black hole in it's drive that opens a gateway in space time and causes the ship to accelerate to the `speed of light' and to bridge the distances between the Milky Way and the cosmos in a day or two as opposed to several Earth years. However during it's maiden voyage, for no apparent reason, the spaceship suddenly disappears along with it's entire crew and no contact was ever reestablished with it. Seven years later however, in 2047, the spaceship suddenly out of nowhere mysteriously reappears and ends up in a low-orbit above Neptune and a signal is received back on Earth. With a world-renown scientist named William Weir, the scientist who designed the ship, crews of nine are sent out on a nine month trip to salvage the ship and rescue the crew, if there are any survivors. However, amidst finding no human life anywhere, the crew's scanner onboard the Lewis and Clark spaceship brings back readings of lifelike energy throughout the entire spaceship. But the the major revelation is that the team discovers that the ""Event Horizon"" brought back something completely different than what even Weir would've ever imagined. The spaceship is discovered to have entered a different dimension that is nothing but ""pure evil and pure chaos"" and the result was the horrific deaths of the entire crew in acts of cannibalism, torture, and mayhem. The ship itself has carried this evil energy back from it's time in this dimension and will not let the crew off.

 ""Event Horizon"" terrifies on so many levels like no other science fiction movie since 1986's ""Aliens"" but even that one felt light-hearted compared to Event Horizon. This is arguably the darkest, scariest movie that I've ever seen but man oh man, it's a great fright fest. Another major reason that I like this movie is that it emphasizes a lot more on black hole physics, a favorite subject of mines. The subject of black holes is immensely fascinating to me and it's great how the production crew came up with the idea of the most powerful force in the universe being utilized for peaceful or scientific purposes only to go horribly wrong. Although completely different, the 1979 flop ""Black Hole"" although interesting was very cheesy and disappointing but ""Event Horizon"" does a far superior job at staying closer to the laws of physics even if it still deviates a bit. The design of the ship is among the most beautifully done and most original that I've ever seen. I don't know if even the Death Star is as awesome as the Event Horizon.

 The sets are among the best movie sets I've ever seen. The design of the ship is among the most original that I've ever seen even by today's standards. The containment section of the ship is among the best science fiction designs that I've ever seen although the part where the people enter the core looks a lot more like a giant meat-grinder and more likely to cause vertigo than a tunnel to the ship's engine but it's nonetheless awesome to look at. The special effects are among the best of it's time especially with the gravity waves.",1137715200,4,3839,4.646539027982327

Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and some nudity.

""Event Horizon"" opens in the mid-21st century, where man has attempted faster-than-light travel. The vessel built for this was the space ship the Event Horizon, and it contained at it's heart an artificial singularity, a miniature black hole if you will, that will open a door to another part of the universe. Upon first test of the engine, the ship disappeared, not to be heard from again. Seven years later, it reappears in orbit over Neptune and a rescue ship, the Lewis & Clark, is dispatched to determine if there are survivors, and what happened to the Event Horizon. Along for the ride is the ship's designer, Dr. Weir (Sam Neill), whos going through a strong trauma in his life after his wife has recently committed suicide. The crew of the Lewis & Clark, commanded by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), listen to Weir's explanation of what happened to the Event Horizon and then receive a transmission from the ship that is garbled but seems to suggest a not so pleasant fate for the crew. The Lewis & Clark crew dock with the Event Horizon and begin investigating the ghost ship, but find strange happenings occurring throughout, with different members of the crew seeing strange things: Miller sees a man he left for dead on an exploding vessel, medical officer Peters (Kathleen Quinland) sees her crippled son, and the ships engineer, Justin (Jack Noseworthy) looked into the singularity engine and is put into a state of shock and Weir begins seeing visions of his wife.  It quickly becomes apparent that the Event Horizon has been somewhere other than another part of the galaxy, and it has brought something back with it.

This film has fantastic production design. The sets are grand, well conceived, appropriately lit (dark, somber) and appear quite solid and functional. The design is heavily influenced by gothic styles. The space craft of the title is like a cathedral. The interior is designed to appear functional and clean and quite at home in science fiction... when all the lights are on. When the lights have gone down a bit, when a character is alone and anxious, the interior feels oppressive and sinister and there is more than a passing resemblance to a torture chamber; this becomes bluntly obvious later on as it literally becomes one, but for now, it is an impressive world of functional and intriguing design.  The problem in the film lies in the fact that it was doing a great job at being interesting, frightening and beautiful, but then suddenly decided to throw all that away and go for 100% shock and senselessness.  BIf you love great set designs and art direction and visuals and cinematography, there is a great deal of enjoyment for you to get out of this film; however, ""Event Horizon"" is so confusing on so many different levels that it may leave you totally devoid of the ability to make a solid judgment on it.

-end update-

Event Horizon.

First of all this isn't a perfect film. It is, however very good and worthy of purchase.

Many other reviewers have savaged the film for being too slasher, too weak or open to intrepretation. I would offer many of them were expecting general science fiction not a bloodbath in space. The gore is what makes them take a step a back. The gore serves the story very well. Hell isn't a primrose path.

Many other reviewers have covered the plot in detail. So I'll avoid being redundant in that aspect.

What makes the movie good is that its a taunt piece of space horror. You hit the ground running almost immediately.  Pacing and storyline are well done (amazing some people don't get the story details - made perfect sense to me). The set design and visuals are simply sublime. There is good character development. Sam Neill plays Dr. Weir to creepy perfection.  The Event Horizon calling to him in his dreams by using his deceased wife is disturbing.

Lawerence Fishborne as Miller delivers a good performance with edge.

The other actors hold the story up well too.

One of the other elements that makes the movie enjoyable is that it doesn't lay it all out for you. Sure, we see the hell the Event Horizon crew endured in limited blips.  The movie lets your imagination run wild just how bad things got. I kept wondering to myself - ok its bad, but just *HOW* bad is it? Not until almost 3/4 of the way through do we get some answers as to the fate of the original crew.

The ending also is open to intrepretation - makes you think. The short latin message recieved also built the story nicely too. ""Liberate Tutame Ix Inferis...""

In the end analysis, this movie is a combination of science fiction and horror. Its a uneasy marriage, as the combination isn't done very often (vs. regular sci-fi). To that end, many of the people who wanted to see science fiction got the unpleasant surprise that this was more of a hellraiser in space than a 'star trek.'

It also didn't help with cinematic audiences that the cliched ""good guy saves the day and himself"" doesn't fly here. Good guy does save the day, but gets dragged into hell with Wier. Not a pleasant end for Miller.

If you are a fan of both genres (scifi/horror) you'll enjoy this like I did. If you are more inclined towards sci-fi only this one probably isn't for you.

Falls just short of brilliant in my opinion. The bashers need to be honest with thier tastes instead of bashing for gore. Event Horizon isn't Star Wars. EH accomplishes what is sought to do quite effectively.

There are rumors of an extended edition with deleted scenes being re-edited in. Length is said to be over 2 hours. Lets get this out on the market!

Not recommended of course for the kiddies either.

926665,3,6304744404,"After a few more viewings of this film sparked by a discussion among friends, I stand by my original opinion that this movie had the chance to be something deeper and scarier than it ultimately turned out to be but too often took the easy way out with cheap ""pop-up"" scares meant to make people jump or flinch in their seats (also known to some as the 'spring-loaded-cat' or 'the false-start' type of scare.)

However, the more i pondered it, the more it grew on me, though i will add the criticism that it owes more than a little to the original ""Hellraiser"" films.

At one point, i thought the concept might be better handled by the current crop of Japanese horror directors, since i'm not necessarily the biggest fan of Paul W.S. Anderson, but after one sitting where i listened to the commentary track in the newer edition of the DVD and heard some of his own criticisms of where things could have been done a bit better either due to some aspect he musjudged or due to budgetary contraints, i'd actually like to see him revisit the idea in some way.

so, i upgrade my assessment of the movie from 3 stars to 3 and 3/4",1127433600,,1122,4.384615384615385
926666,5,6304744404,"Event Horizon is a classic Sci-fi story with a horror edge to it. Fans of the X-Files, 2001, and the Alien series are sure to enjoy this movie. The story is well-paced, the acting is very good, and the horror...well, it is downright scary.

Event Horizon has all the elements of a serious space sage I crave for: a sense of ""aloneness"" in space, a sense of wonder over what will be fond on a journey, and a sense of awe at what the possibilities are.

I am a huge sci-fi fan and there are few movies I can watch over and over again (Alien, 2001), but this is one of them. Don't miss the Event Horizon.

Regarding the negative reviews? Ignore them and watch the movie yourself. While there are horror elements, this flick is primarily a hard sci-fi tale. The crew journies to explore a ship thought lost, only to discover a mystery that was lurking in deep space. A must see for sci-fi fans. Horror folks might dismiss it, and your wife might hate it.

Also, I thought the acting to be above par. I didn't notice the acting, which is good. The story moves along quickly, and pace-perfect. There are no points where the story drags. lastly, I am left wanting more from the Event Horizon universe. This is a compliment to the story.

The DVD version of Event Horizon is a must buy for fans of the movie. The commentaries are wonderful, especially the candid talk from the director and producer about how the film was rushed, and the final cut was weak because of the studio. (The director had only 4 weeks to do a final edit)

To be perfectly honest, I suspected Hollywood shot itself in the foot again: you had a story where a spaceship accidentally journeys into Hell and returns--bringing back some of the infernal realm with it.

Except people in Hollywood don't believe in Hell.  They don't even want to be suspected of ever believing in Hell, so they must remove all references to Hell.

(If you think this sounds crazy, don't: I have the original screenplay of FLATLINERS, and the filmmakers--and one actress--totally destroyed one of the best screenplays I've ever read for the same reasons I'm citing here).

I found a couple of lines in the script where the characters say Hell...but they were removed from the movie.  So the main premise is left unsaid...and unexplored.  The movie ends up degenerating into a slasher-type gore-fest, which is unfortunate because the acting and the production values are top notch.

I thought this movie was genius in many ways and truly horrifying. It stuck with me for weeks like ""Exorcist"" or ""The Ring"".  Also, I thought this movie was quite original in it's own right. Yes, it did derive certain elements from some other classic sci-fis, but what movies don't nowadays.  ""Event"" still holds it's own with an intriguing plot, truly horrifying scenes, great cinematography and exceptional sound.  Speaking of sound, this movie may have the best sound effects ever. Just watch this movie on a good home theatre system and turn it up!!!

I'd have to say the one down side was how the movie progressed to a little campy horror near the end, but overall I found the ending satisfying.  No one ever seems to like movie endings no matter how good the movie - this one was more than acceptable.

This movie is not for everyone.  It is extremely disturbing with some very morbid and twisted themes.  There is one scene halfway through involving the original crew of the ship which will truly disturb anyone especially if you watch in slo-mo like I did.

Sam Neil stars as Dr. Weir. I guess that's a play on words : Weir/Weird because he is. The doctor is brooding and obviously still mourning the death of his wife. In fact, he's so off center you wonder why on earth the authorities are sending him anywhere.

The premise of the movie is simple. Event Horizon vanished on it's maiden voyage while trying to go to warp speed. Seven years later the ship is back. Weir and the crew of the Lewis and Clarke have been sent to check it out.

Event Horizon did more than travel at warp speed aparently the ship went way off course and punched it's way into hell. Bad news for the crew and bad news for anyone who steps on board the now dammned and ghost ridden ship.

So far, so good. Then come the mistakes. The crew of the Lewis and Clarke are undistinguished. The captain, played by Lawrence Fishbourne  could have played by a young Sidney Poitier. There's nothing new or fresh about the character. You've seen it before. The rest of the crew are just cardboard. You have the clown, the smart blonde, the other woman who gets killed off quickly, the English guy and of course, the young crewman who might as well have a ""I'm off to get killed"" sign on his forehead.

The plot seemed to get lazy at this point. Obvious things happen to the crew and they react in obvious ways. It's also extremely gross at times and it feels like the makers of the movie ran out of ideas and decided to throw in some gross out moments to get the viewers attention. It's like a paint by numbers set. The climax and ending are also rip offs of several other movies.

But you'd be a fool to let any of these things get in the way of your taking a fun-filled two-hour jaunt to the very edge of the galaxy and doing some sight-seeing aboard the ""Event Horizon"", a special ship---a *very* special ship, actually, that was conducting experiments in trans-light speed (that's ""warp speed"", Mr. Sulu) before it disappeared seven years ago. And now it's back! Orbiting a black hole, no less! And attempts at radio contact have proved futile!

So pack of your blaster and get out that passport, it's time to join Dr. William Weir (played to the bloody hilt by Sam Neill, who appears to be having the time of his career) and journey to the edge of the galaxy to determine what happened to the Event Horizon's original crew in 2040---a crew which included Dr. Weir's wife (played by Holley Chant, a real trooper who proves you don't even need eyeballs to turn in a knockout and creepy performance).

Let's back up for a minute. When I first saw ""Event Horizon"" in a nearly empty theater in Upstate New York, I hated it. I disparaged it, loudly, to friends. Naturally I backed up my 'hatred' by saying the movie was plotless, the movie broke down in the end, that it was brainless, that a coolly atmospheric beginning was spoiled by an 'evil' that more properly belonged in a Hellraiser film.

But let me tell you what was really on my mind: ""Event Horizon"" got under my skin and really *disturbed* me. It gave me the creeps. It made me wince to watch its twisted, warped plot unfold on the screen. From the moment we're 'introduced' to Dr. Weir aboard the Good Ship Event Horizon, and especially when we get a good look at the gangrenous legs of the medical officer's 'son', I was saying ""Uh oh---this movie is out of control"". Me, a veteran, jaded gorehound!

That power to disturb in a horror movie is a rare gift, which is why I believe director Paul W.S. Anderson to be one of the finest genre directors working today. Anderson takes all the rules of the science fiction movie, sets them up, abides by them for about the first 25 minutes of the film until you really think you know what's going on, and then throws them out the window while you're yelling ""hey---you can't do that with the Rules!"". Anderson is the creepy guy who takes your arm and finds the nerve that hurts and then squeezes, and squeezes, and squeezes.

That's what watching ""Event Horizon"" is like: having a particularly sensitive nerve squeezed, over and over again---in the nastiest possible way.

It would be unfair to the viewer to say more about ""Event Horizon"" than this: the rescue team, including Dr. Weir and Captain Miller (played understatedly by the pre-Matrix Laurence Fishburne) of the 'Lewis & Clark', find the Event Horizon an abandoned derelict, orbiting a black hole. Well, abandoned, except for strange visions, and discomfiting voices echoing throughout the grim passageways---and then there's the matter of all the blood, gore, and other goop caked up in the alcoves of the Horizon's bridge, or the final broadcast made by the Horizon's captain...

Anderson directs much like a young Ridley Scott, which is not surprising, since his crew includes a number of Scott's colleagues. He has a flair at building up a sustained atmosphere of menace and brooding malevolence, and of getting the most from his eerie, ornately Gothic set design. Of course, I immediately wondered who on Earth would design the Event Horizon to look like it did---with spikes, flanges, and violent green access-ways---but then possibly the Horizon had undergone a few upgrades by the time we get to see it, and I don't think Earth had anything to do with the design changes.

Anderson is also particularly good in his sparing and careful use of CGI, which is used to telling effect in this movie: the sequence in which we see a cascade of items---a watch, a nail file, loose change---spiralling in zero gravity is beautiful and creepy all at once.

All that said, ""Event Horizon"" is a compact, stylish little piece of pure horror and it is very scary. It's also one of the goriest films I've ever watched. Ever wonder what a guy who wanders into an airlock without a spacesuit looks like over the course of a few minutes? Wonder no longer. Wanna see a full surgical lumbar dissection in the main bridge? No problemo, Sarge! Ever ponder what a little homemade LASIK surgery without anesthetic might look like? Ponder no more, pardner! Anderson finds the thing you really don't want to see---the awful thing, the thing that other directors are content to let happen offscreen---and forces you to watch.

There are a few missteps (Fishburne's encounter with a burning crewman and Richard Jones's obligatory laugh relief undermine the meticulous atmosphere), but ""Event Horizon"" is a mercilessly nasty and disturbing excursion into outer space horror that pulls no punches. It's a wicked tale, stylishly told, of a Deep Space Haunted House with very big teeth---and a powerful appetite.",1101513600,7,5525,4.859723698193411
926816,4,6304744404,"Here is a novel idea.  We've seen haunted houses, haunted crypts, haunted churches and haunted ships.  How about a haunted spacecraft?  Well, here is a film to meet that niche!

For those who may not be familiar with physics terms, an event horizon is the threshold between two dimensions.  Typically it describes the outer boundary of a singularity (black hole).  It's at this juncture that the laws of space-time & physics in our universe break down.  What lies beyond is anyone's guess.

So enters the name of the ship featured in this movie.  It was designed to ""fold"" spacetime and create a sort of wormhole that would allow for deep-space travel.  Its inventor is played by Sam Neil.  There is just one problem:  on its maiden voyage it disappeared without a trace.

Seven years later the EVENT HORIZON re-appears in an orbit around Neptune.  Neil's character is dispatched along with a Search-and-Rescue team that is headed by a leader portrayed by Laurence Fishburne.  The balance of the film details their attempt to discern what happened to the EVENT HORIZON.  This is one mission that the crew wished they had skipped over!  The ship itself now seems to be alive and it has a sadistic sense of humor.

The film contains some nice somewhat traditional horror motifs.  Instead of a fog surrounding a haunted castle, the atmosphere around Neptune acts as a sort of gothic & eerie fog-like phenomena.  Also, Neil plays a sort of mad scientist who has created a ""monster"" that is now beyond his control.

For those who like either horror films or science fiction movies, this one is worth checking out.  For those who like both sci-fi & horror as well as hybrids of the two, this one is a MUST!  The cast is top-notch and it's a nice & spooky story that happens to be told in outer space.",1099180800,4,1794,4.661341853035144
926817,3,6304744404,"EVENT HORIZON takes it title from the main charcter in the movie: a fairly large deep-space traveling craft capable of traveling past the speed of light that was meant to bring about a new-age of exploration and scientfic achievement in the year 2040. But, as the opening typed prologue informs us, something went wrong and the ship disappeared near Neptune.  Seven years later the ship mysteriously reappears broadcasting an almost inaudible mysterious message containing snippets of Latin.  A rescue team aboard the vessel ""Lewis and Clark"" is dispatched to save any crew members who might be left alive, find out what happened, and retrieve the ship for further investigation.

Laurence Fishburne plays Captain Miller, the commander of ""Lewis and Clark.""  He's joined by a crew of multi-talented and experienced space rescue veterans. However, Miller and company have an uninvited guest and are joined by the illustrious, yet boding Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill). After a two and a half-month space sleep, the crew is awaken as they approach Neptune and Dr. Weir fills them in on the details of their mission. Weir was the creator of Event Horizon and was part of a government conspiracy that hid the truth about what really happened to the ship.  Captain Miller's crew had all been told and believed that 7 years ago Event Horizon blew up. Once they learn the truth they are upset and want to abandon their mission, but even though Miller agrees with their sentiments he knows that they have to at least check the ship for survivors.

As the movie progresses, Miller and crew learn that Event Horizon has some sort of gravity-defying engine that creates a temporary blackhole that serves as a wormhole to another part of the universe. Once the crew boards Horizon a feeling of terror and huanting horror envelopes them all.  This isn't Kansas anymore Toto.

EVENT HORIZON has a very talented cast and a fairly interesting story idea.  The movie borrows heavily from a host of sci-fi and horror influences (everthing from THE SHINING to HELLRAISER to SOLARIS and ALIEN). The movie reminded me a lot of THE SHINING except instead of a haunted hotel that is alive, it's a living haunted starship.  Influences like that can be detrimental to a movie, but in EVENT HORIZON they help raise the film and make it feel more real. The movie also has a great cast of actors (Fishburne and Neill are excellent in their roles) and the movie's tone and style are augmented by the set design and lighting.

In fact, EVENT HORIZON should have been a great horrifying sci-fi movie. But it's not.  The film has so many good elements, but the most important thing in a movie (the story) is glossed over leaving a movie horror/sci-fi flick plot that looks like Charlie Brown's ghost costume in IT'S THE GREAT PUMPKIN, CHARLIE BROWN. According to director Paul W.S. Anderson, the film was heavily editing by studio suits and, therefore, many of the better parts of the plot and much of the movie's soul was lost. Perhaps a special director's cut edition someday might remedy that problem. Until then, the movie's just an average piece of horrifying science fiction that needs some elaboration.",1099094400,7,3175,4.881040892193308
926818,1,6304744404,"Ok. I thought that ""Gigli"" with Ben Affleck was the worst movie I ever subjected myself to seeing (I rented it to see if it really sucked that badly)

I was nearly proven wrong by ""Event Horizon"". The ultimate reminder to Hollywood that you can't make a movie based soley on special effects.

Basically. The ""Event Horizon"" spaceship is supposed to like do some wierd star trek thingy and aherm ""Fold Space"". Well, we all KNOW that can be done with a quantum shirekeimajiggy, but noooooo. Wiseass Sam Neil decides, ""Lets make a BLACK HOLE instead, SUUUURRREEE its the most destructive force in the UNIVERSE, but im sure if we use it like we know what we are doing it will turn out A OK!""

No, No Sam Neil. Maybe you know how dinosaurs hump each other, but you do not, and i repeat DO NOT create a big assed black hole because you think you know what your doing.

Anyway, as expected, the whole black whole thing kinda goes a smidgen wrong. The crew of the Event Horizon accidentally....... CREATE A GIANT HOLE INTO THE DIMENSION OF HELL..... whoopsie. Yeah well this place of evil and pixies makes the crew go nuts and pretty much rip the skin off each other until they all die.

Anyways, a lameass ""Top Secret"" rescue crew is sent out to Neptune [Because by Uranas you just know you would be crying with laughter] to find the ""Event Horizon""

Instead of monsters there are small breasted apparitions and little children to ""scare"" you as everyone gradually goes insane. Apparently the ship is now ""alive"" [hmm i always found it interesting when my toaster starts talking after a trip to hell] and pretty much wants everyone to, uhm, poke their own eyes out, go nuts and just kinda hurt each other quite alot.

Whats the coolest part? Not everyone dies! Wow! The ending is actually the worst ending I have ever been subjected to. An insult to my own intelligence, and the general movie going audience intelligence. This is Z-movie piffle of the highest order.

Hardly scary, laughable and rarely chilling. The concept remains cloudy until the last 15 minutes. The shame is that the concept could have been explored in a much better way, the idea of heaven and hell being in different dimensions is definately one for non-religous people to explore. But It ends out turning to laughable violence and poorly written characters to provide its support. The strongest aspect is its polished but dated Computer Generated Images. Thats not saying alot.

Littered with cliches, bad acting, a confusing and streched story and a clotty writing style, the pic is devoid of any real chills and instead tries to spook viewers with its admittedly dark concept.

It replays as every poorly made box office disaster scifi flick your ever likely to see, clearly constructed to whip up controversy and make a mint. Instead ""Event Horizon"" will likely serve as an example of how NOT to make horror and scifi flicks.

When a movie with Joely Richardson never fails to rise above ""ZZZZZZZ"" then you know theres something far, far wrong. Heres for hoping this film will simply fall into a black whole somwhere.",1097712000,14,3088,4.7
926819,5,6304744404,"I watch quite a few thriller/horrors, some of which might scare me during movie, but then I say, fun, and never think about it again.

Event Horizon I find myself often thinking back on, but what is it that makes this one stick out? I think for me it's the way they capture the feeling of pure terror, the ultimate form of evil. This movie is I feel the only movie so far that 'realisticly' (As in not stupid/cheesy) portrays hell/evil/terror.

*This part contains some spoilers*

The movie has it's gory moments, but never does the accent lie on the gore, it lies on the wrongness behind the act. There are some scene's in the movie which are just 'wrong'. Like at a certain moment where they see a videolog of the former crue  while they were in hell. They just no longer looked human, that scene is so gruesome, so horrifying, especially also because of this latin sentance that is spoken by one of the crue through it. There are more scene's in the movie that are just plain 'wrong'

At one point you see this woman who is litteraly half naked and you see the top half of her body, but the last thing you're thinking at that moment is, oh, look, she's naked. No, it's a not a hectic scene, very calm, very 'tranquil' almost but in a very wrong way.

The gore isn't the focus of the movie, it's the idea behind it that makes it so intreguing, and it has made me think. There is also the theme of self sacrifice in it, and that we can resist evil, stand up against it and that is does not have to have ultimate power over us.

This is a truly terrifying movie, not for the lighthearted. I made the mistake of watching it on my own, in the middle of night in complete darkness, and I was huddled up on the couch with my blanket pulled over me (no, not over my head ;-) But if you can sit through it you have seen in my eyes a movie that has captured something so very very few movies have, the pure essence of terror and evil, very well done, great movie!",1097366400,4,1956,4.2

When were being subjected to this kind of crap, at least tell us why these characters are dying. I got to know more about ""Solaris"" than this, then again that film was one of the best films of 2002. ""The Matrix"" was almost like this, but they got us to forgive them for putting some action in it. ""Event Horizon"" has no action, no plot, or even a reason to horrible violence, and the actors are all on the same level of acting. Once again ""Alien VS. Predator"" is his crowning achievement.

There is this one torture scene in the movie that is just flat out wrong, and I will not tell you what happens. Watch and see for yourself.

 The story itself doesn't develop well in telling the audience why the events occur the way they do or what the motives of the antagonists are. Instead, the movie hopelessly counts on blood and gore scenes as fillers to do the explaining of the story which it never does. The script is shallow and unrevealing. Very much like the ""Exorcist"", the audience is never told about why the story happens and focuses more on how it unfolds. Unlike the ""Exorcist"" the setting in outer space actually takes away the element of the supernatural required for this sort of story. The result being that the story falls flat and has no sense to it: it just slowly and senselessly trods along to the end.

 A viewer is certainly not missing much for not renting this movie. Definitely not worth buying. For this genre of film, I would recommend the ""Alien"" series, ""Pitch Black"", or Carpenter's ""The Thing"", instead.",1091404800,3,1056,4.691891891891892

This is a top notch movie.  I can actually say it is my favorite.  It had the classic popup horror, terrific acting, disturbing sences, and a bit of a mysterious begining.  But what I love so much about this movie is the fact that it did its job unlike most horror movies.  Night of the living dead, Resident Evil, Prince of darkness.

926894,1,6304744404,"During a glut of movie watching, I happened to watch Event Horizon.  I cannot recommend this movie even to those who like cheesy ghost stories.
The Event Horizon, mankind's first attempt at a faster than light ship has suddenly appeared in orbit around Neptune.  A rescue crew and the ship's designer head out to investigate.  While attempting to dock with the massive ship, the rescue vessel is damaged and needs to be repaired.  Lack of air forces the crew onto the derelict.
As the crew investigates the mystery of the returned ship, individual members begin to be haunted by their deepest fears.  Somewhere along the line the ship's creator becomes possesses and tries to prevent the others from leaving.
This movie was intended as a subtle ghost story.  The beginning is pretty good but soon it becomes apparent that the movie makers are just not used to subtle.  Visually the movie loses the story line as special effects become more pronounced than required.  I guess that midway through the film they tried to recreate the film Alien and failed.
Despite all of the bad points, there is actually some good acting to be found on screen.  Unlike most science fiction and horror films the rescue crew behave cautiously and intelligently.  Unfortunately they were up against something much too powerful.
What we they up against?  Well, when the ship went on its maiden voyage and punched a gateway through space, it traveled briefly in something that is outside space and time.  A region of perfect chaos that most would call Hell.  During that brief encounter the ship became alive and the gateway was not completely shut.
So, if someone happens to be showing a video of this film (free of charge) then you might want to take a look.  After all, the premise and the acting were good, it was just off the mark.  Way off.",1088380800,10,1823,4.742857142857143

When I say terrifying, I don't mean moronic slasher-movie suspense scary, I mean that when I saw this in the movie theater, I cried because I was so frightened. (I was 11, but I'm pretty sure that if I could watch more than five minutes at a time, I would cry now too.) Just thinking about the movie gives me the creeps; it's just one suspicious noise after another, and only the most hardcore horror movie afficionado wouldn't be freaked.
A logical part of my mind knows that we are scared of what our own minds imagine as threats (after all, having a literal ton of blood dumped on Kathleen Quinlan is more ridiculous than scary), and that we are simply fooled by the gory imagery into thinking of every possible terror that could be lurking in the shadows. I warn all viewers, thinking about this movie logically is not an option; it plays to our most basic fears of the unknown and, of course, Hell in Space (a popular theme with the horror genre, including such ""classics"" as Alien and Jason X).
Knowing that it is not physically possible for such a universe-piercing machine to exist (even such a handsomely designed machine) doesn't lessen the terror, because every instant is fraught with tension, so there's no time to think about anything. Even the relatively calm beginning is nerve-wracking, because we've all seen horror movies, so we know what to expect, and we react preemptively.
In truth, it's not a very good movie (for a normal movie, I would barely give it two stars).
It has a killer cast: Sam Neill (Jurassic Park), Lawrence Fishburne (Othello), Jason Isaacs (The Patriot), to name a few; but the plot is convoluted, complicated, and utterly unbelievable.
I can't believe this movie gave me nightmares for three days, and I can't believe that I would give it a four-star rating, but someone who buys Event Horizon isn't buying it for noteworthy dialogue or originality; they are buying it for the terror factor, and in that case, I must concede that it is the scariest movie I've ever seen (and while my imagination makes me easily drawn in by these movies, Event Horizon goes above and beyond everything else).

A secret space mission is on its way to rendezvous with the spacecraft Event Horizon, now orbiting Neptune after returning from an experimental outreach into hyper-space. On board the rescue vessel is the Event Horizon's designer, forthcoming up to a point about what its mission had really been but beyond that point evasive. All very promising so far. The camera-work and effects are excellent, and while I couldn't help noticing a certain resemblance between the spaceships and their counterpart in 2001 A Space Odyssey, and even more so between the interior of the Event Horizon and the Nostromo in Alien that did not trouble me in any way. The first sign of trouble came with the recorded transmission from the crew of the Event Horizon, which turned out to be in Latin, the shape of bunkum to come.
The borrowings then start to come thick and fast, particularly, I am inclined to say, thick. The designer has to investigate a possible short-circuit in a way reminiscent of Bowman disabling the computer HAL in 2001. While doing so he encounters a hologram of his wife and I began to be reminded of Solaris, and the lights start to fail in a way reminiscent again of Alien. The Event Horizon has, I am sorry to say, been out into the unknown and unthinkable only to return as a kind of Hell House from hyper-space, possessed of some kind of sentience of its own, bent on consuming its crew and in contact with a wretched gaggle of revolting Latin-speaking mutants who would have disgraced many a B-movie and who make the Cellulites (or whatever they were called) in Hellraiser look brilliant. The crew's escape is again in line with the Alien series, and the final would-be coup de grace is some sort of ultimate in predictable hackneyed bathos.
The acting does a certain amount to redeem a disappointing film, particularly Fishburne as the captain. The real pity, for me, is what it all might have been if more effort and imagination, indeed any effort and imagination at all, had gone into the plot-line.

Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) and the crew of the Lewis & Clark, a deep space salvage ship, is dispatched to investigate. Along for the ride is Dr. Weir (Sam Neill), the creator of the Event Horizon.
Dr. Weir is a troubled soul, haunted by the suicide of his wife due to his excessive workaholic habits. The crew learns from the good doctor, after initial disbelief upon learning the Event Horizon has returned, how the ship warps. He designed the core of the ship which creates a black hole which the ship slips through. Where it's been, as well as the disposition of the crew, is the reason why they are going.
Upon reaching the ship, the crew finds life readings all over the ship, but temperatures on board so cold, no human life could possibly survive. Upon entering the ship, Captain Miller and the crew experience strange event after strange event. The ship can somehow read their deepest fears, and toys with them. Eventually, the crew discovers that the ship had gone to hell and back. Dr. Weir effectively flips out and causes all kinds of damage.
The sets, costumes and environments are sleek and very detailed, and the story itself is very good. I believe Ghost Ship is almost a replica of this movie. If you see this movie, see Ghost Ship and you'll see what I mean.
It's not a perfect film, but it has a few good scares, and many creepy moments which will stick with you after you see it.",1078963200,2,1717,4.596091205211726
926942,4,6304744404,This is one of the scariest sci-fi movies that I have watched to date. It actually ranks in my top 25 for scariest movie of all time.  This is a movie that holds your attention until the very end.  It's kinda like Alien meets Exorcist meets Hellraiser!  The sets are JUST AMAZING and the acting isn't all that bad either.  Sam Neil and Larry Fishburne aren't my top actors picks but they do a believable job in this film.  The special effects are FABULOUS and worth the price of the movie alone!  Lots of flash cinematography that seeps into your poor little brain and you JUST can't forget.  THAT'S what makes this movie UNFORGETTABLE!,1076284800,4,636,4.526315789473684
926943,5,6304744404,"Event Horizon just happens to be a killer movie, however the director Anderson also just happens to be a completely incompetent filmmaker who has gone wrong with every step he has taken after making this one which really is hard to imagine, except to say that maybe there is more to a film than just the director. Event Horizon proves that point with a powerhouse performance from Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neil. This is the movie which showed that Fishburne could do sci-fi. It also proved that he could be a leading man in a big budget movie. Neil reprises his ""Omen"" career making character and does wonders as the scientist with a dark side. The rest of the cast are fully functional but do sometimes appear a little wobbly.
The Event Horizon is the Exorcist in space. The title of the film is about a ship that has completed the first space warp but the crew have vanished leaving behind a cryptic and often horrific trail of evidence that suggests that warp jumping is a little more than just opening up doorways through the cosmos. It is more like opening up a doorway to the unknown.
But let's get back to why Event Horizon happens to transcend the confines of its sham director. Philip Eisner has given us a damn fine script even though it borrows elements from other films and gives them a twist, but people here seem to think that Event Horizon is a total fake because they have seen something before. Well of course they have seen something before because the Cinematographer happens to be none other than Adrian Biddle the same guy who shot ALIENS. It has a lot in common with the look of that movie. We also have Joseph Bennett the set designer of films like Hardware (Directed by Richard Stanley) on board so Event Horizon has a dream production team working on it.
In short Event Horizon is a great movie and a damn scary one that had trouble passing the censors. If you like scary movies and scary sci-fi then Even Horizon scores in aces.",1075852800,8,1956,4.528248587570621
926944,5,6304744404,"Years later this film still sticks in my mind just about the same way The Exorcist does.  This is one visually disturbing film.  I have to wonder if a lot of the work put into this film came from horrifying dreams.  This movie is masterfull at psyching out the viewer.  The unexpected becomes the obvious in the blink of an eye.  Perhaps what disturbed me most about the film was the fact that much of it's imagery seemed hauntingly familiar to me in my own nightmares.  The dialogue and the souless eyes sent me into chills so close to my heart that I found myself looking away from the screen on at least 2 occasions.  This is coming from someone who can sit through anything, anything.  I still have trouble watching it, always apprehensive at first.  However, I welcome it's scarey appeal and originality.  Character developement is great.  The unseen driving force behind Dr. Weir's personal agenda probably becomes the most suspensefull aspect of the film.  The exploring crewmembers become closer to eachother as the story developes.  Their relationships were already established at the beginning of the film but the fact that they became even closer as things got considerably worse made this viewing experience seem even more real.  Great performances all around.  Lawrence Fishbourne puts such a brilliant sense of courage in his character in the face of such awe inspiring fear.  His last lines are like a punch in the gut.  You want to raise your fist in triumph but at the same time you see that he's displaying the absolute human spirit and how resiliant we can be against all odds.  He is afraid but he remains determined.  Amazing.  Face your fear and you will definitely SEE.",1074643200,,1692,4.768965517241379
926945,2,6304744404,"This movie is a complete ripoff of numerous other plotlines. As everyone who's gone this far knows, the movie starts out just like Alien. Basically, a ship that's capable of travelling through two points in a four-dimensional plane by creating a singularity of the dimensional gateways using a Triple Supermagnetic field to immitate a black hole is lost beyond Neptune. (didn't catch that? Take a second to digest it). The ship happens to have gone to an unknown place in the universe, or in any other universe, that has the appeal of ultimate suffering (call it Hell for the time being, because that's basically what it entails).
Does the plot sound farmiliar to anyone? Well, any fan of the raging computer game Quake, or the movie/series Stargate would of course be reminded. Quake's plot focused around the same idea - except rather than travelling across a singularity and teleporting to a different point in the fourth dimension, the ""Slipgate"" technology used another sort of analogous technology that teleported by piercing throguh a fourth dimensional gateway and travelled directly through a fifth dimensional plane. The fifth dimensional plane happenned to carry it across a parrallel universe, which happenned to be hell or something like it.
Despite these obvious similarities and scientific innaccuracies, the movie didn't fail to entertain on its own level. When I saw it in a theatre several years ago, the concept of it scared the crap out of me. The graphics and enviroment are gruesome but realistic, as well as much of the physics. Some parts were flawed, among them when one character falls into space without any protection he survives for at least 5-10 seconds (in real life the blood pressure would cause one to explode immediately). I would give it two stars out of five, mainly for lack of creativity.",1074470400,6,1827,5.0131578947368425
926946,4,6304744404,"Recently I bought this film on DVD because I enjoy it so much, even after many viewings over the years.  Event Horizon, for the uninitiated, first-time viewer, is a shock to the senses.  It does not play by the traditional rules of sci-fi horror flicks.  It plays tricks with the mind, leaving the viewer frightened, but more importantly, deeply disturbed by the images.  Very few films have been able to scare me so deeply other than The Shining, Suspiria, and Ringu.  Event Horizon takes the elements of psychological horror and brilliantly combines them with physical revulsion and gore.  The first time I saw this movie was in a half-empty theatre in Muncie, Indiana.  I was terrified so much I couldn't sleep.
Sure, the acting is not perfect, and maybe this film could have been better if the writer had spent more time with dialogue, but all in all this film is superb for it's genre.
One of the film's greatest assets is the ship, the Event Horizon.  I was amazed at the detail involved.  It was part Alien, part Cathedral Norte Dame, and part Heironomous Bosch's vision of hell.
There's something deeply unsettling about a disembodied voice hissing in Latin, which is revisited by the crew in the film several times, but what Paul T. Anderson does that really goes out on a limb is actually ""showing"" what happened to the missing crew.  I was truly not expecting this when I saw it.
Larry Fishburne and Sam Neil are well placed in this film, and the rest of the cast are fine actors as well.  As I recall, two of the UK actors went on to star in ""The Patriot"" with Mel Gibson.
My judgement of the criticism this film recieved was that the reviewers were just plain disturbed.  This movie uses flash imagery to push the right psychological buttons that leave the viewer unable to forget what they've seen.
I'm a film snob, and I love this movie!  If you want to be scared witless, then watch it alone in the dark. The score is creepy, but the special effects are amazing.  This is great stuff, and I highly recommend this film!",1073865600,6,2034,4.567493112947658
926947,1,6304744404,"I've had the misfortune of seeing this movie twice. The first time, I expected an intense psychological thriller that would bend my mind over and prison-rape it. Instead, I was subjected to an utterly pointless and disgusting two-hour-long bloodbath. Some years passed, and after considerable professional therapy, I was able to put this bad memory behind me. Then, a little while ago, the sci-fi channel ran this movie. Not having anything better to do, and wondering if this movie was really as bad as I remembered, I watched it again. I have the following things to say about it:
(1) The set designs are freaking AWESOME. The acting is dead-on. The special effects are gorgeous. There are some genuinely creepy scenes, too. Basically, everything about it rocks except the plot. If you're looking to see some beautiful environments littered with corpses and splashed with blood, then this is the movie for you.
(2) The plot is stupid. A ship accidentally goes to Hell, then returns to our universe with a little chunk of Hell still attached to it... somewhere... maybe in those tunnels that use circuitboards for wallpaper, or in a secret compartment under the captain's chair. Anyway, there's a little souvenir from Hell on the ship somewhere, and it basically causes the crew to have such horrible hallucinations that one by one they either commit suicide or tear their eyes out because dammit, they're tired of seeing dead people's guts all over the place! Of course, the guy who built the ship is secretly in love with it, despite the fact that it's trying its hardest to kill him, so he starts yammering on and on about how the ship wants him to be its new crew (even though this ship very clearly does not like having ANY crew). And so on and so on until everyone is dead.
You know, actually, this movie could be very entertaining. Just get a bunch of friends together on the couch, split a six-pack or two, and MST the hell out of it, pun intended.",1072828800,15,1957,4.708454810495627
926948,4,6304744404,"There's no denying how bottomlessly dumb this movie is, and how it shamelessly lifts its plot from countless other sci-fi movies that are better than Event Horizon (or ""E.V."" as its fans call it). As you probably already know, it starts out like aliens, and then they board the Event Horizon, which has the stink of evil all over it from having traveled to hell. From there, the hapless crew has hallucinations of their worst fears, acted out in little playlets ala every episode of Star Trek you have ever seen. Nothing new here...
However, I was riveted throughout this tawdry little chunk of cinematic glop for pretty much one reason, which is, quite simply:
GALLONS AND GALLONS OF OOEY-GOOEY BLOOD!!!
It's a very sticky, clumpy, drippy little thriller of a film. It's the kind of film that reminds make-up artists why they never bothered to focus in school as children and, instead, play with their food at the dinner table trying to perfect their ""smear"" technique.
Probably the best thing about the unbridled gore in this movie is that it is all so laughably unnecessary. Eyeballs explode, people are mercilessly impaled, and brains ooze like microwave lasagna. I recommend watching it with a jumbo meat-lovers pizza for a ""feel-around"" effect whilst viewing.
Since this movie exceeded its budget in set design and blood (mostly blood), it had little left for anything else. They had to hire a bunch of idiots to star in it, and since they were paid to merely be idiots in the film, nothing was lost on this front and they succeeded brilliantly.
In closing, if you have a free night and your shower does not need re-grouting, I can whole-heartedly endorse ""E.V.""

926951,1,6304744404,"Once again Paul Anderson is given the right tools for a decent movie and blows it.
I'll give credit where it's due though.  For once, an Anderson movie had a GEORGOUS set design.  Both space ships were terrific on both interior and exterior shots.  If there's any redeeming quality to this movie, this is it by far.
As for the story though, the pace of the movie was just awful.  I'd love to see how much was left on the editing floor because the transitions from scene to scene were horrible.  Characters would be introduced one minute, disappear for the next 20 minutes, reappear in the backgroud the next minute, all of which was to set up their kill scene the next minute.  Poor editing made it really difficult to generate even the ability to be able to tell who was who, let alone build up a connection to anyone.
I also didn't care for the 'Hellraiser' turn the film seemed to unexpectedly take.  Not only was I completely blindsided by it, but I didn't think it was necessary.  Think of the level of suspense that was build in '2001: A Space Oddessey' when HAL loses it and starts killing the crew.  Anderson could have maybe taken a similiar direction here all while staying true to the haunted-house-in-space idea that he seemed to want to develop.
This is just one more example of how a poor production crew can completely kill a movie.  I hate to think that Anderson has my beloved 'Alien vs Predator' movie up next, because, personally, I can't see how this guy keeps getting work.",1067558400,11,1494,4.520446096654275

927016,3,6304744404,"The first hour is mostly harmless. There is minimal blood and violence, some pleasingly creepy atmosphere, a suspenseful plot that is building up to something good, and the actors are all doing their jobs nicely.
So, what happened during the last half hour? It's like the director just decided he wanted to give up. Or, even more likely, he was just playing a prank to keep you watching so that he could throw out some terrible things at you.
The plot, as you can read elsewhere, is simple and intriguing. A crew investigates a seemingly abandoned space ship and weird stuff happens. There ya go. Serviceable and interesting. And it almost works. ""Event Horizon"" is a movie that has a large potential and then wastes it by taking the best elements and debasing them.
The characters explore the Event Horizon and begin to have hallucinations (Or do they...?). The is-it-real-or-is-it-imaginary theme is played up nicely and sustains a suspenseful mood for awhile. This is especially effective against a science-fiction backdrop which relies on plausible (Albeit outlandish) ideas. And then, out of nowhere, the movie decides to ruin this fun mood by giving the characters weak motivations and debunking the mysteries with subpar explanations. It's like asking your Physics professor to explain gravity and having him tell you, ""It's magic.""
And then the gore kicks in. Which is really just there to push the limit. Needlessly.
The good news is, the special effects are good, the acting is mostly good, and at least one hour of the movie is worth watching. The bad news is, the action is kind of weak, the script wears thin by the end, and the violence is just pornographic in nature.
VIOLENT CONTENT - Lots of it. There are a few graphic scenes of people's eyes being pulled out or otherwise mutilated. There are a few scenes of people whose eyes have already been pulled out. There is an unnecessarily graphic video that runs for about twenty or thirty seconds depicting a series of brutal tortures / mutilations of the crew of the Event Horizon (Involving decapitation of pretty much every part of the human body). There is a graphic scene of a live human dissection. A child's legs are eviscerated. There are quick flashes of miscellaneous gore involving spikes and blades and other pointy metal things... Should I go on?
(Special note - Most of the gore is preceded by a line like, ""Do you see?"" or ""I want to show you this"" or ""I have something to show you"" or ""You should see this."" If you do not wish to be grossed out by lots and lots of blood, then turn away any time you hear a phrase even remotely like any of the preceding few.)
LANGUAGE CONTENT - It is an R-rated movie, so there's an abundance of those beloved four-letter words. The total count, though, is sure to come in considerably low when compared to many other films.
NUDITY / SEXUAL CONTENT - There is one scene where Dr. Weir has a hallucination of his wife committing suicide. She is nude during this scene. There are a few scenes of men and women in their underwear, but these are pretty harmless.",1056758400,2,3072,4.701298701298701

The idea behind Even Horizon is brilliant and although the film could have been better it definitely did not disappoint.  As far as a horror movie goes it did its job just too well, I couldn't sleep at night and my mother, who was unfortunate enough to watch it with me, didn't sleep well either.  Event Horizon incorporated many unanswered questions in the realm of space and time and converted them into a vehicle of delivering something extremely terrifying.  As we all know, nobody will hear you scream in deep space.  At the same time I think that two main characters were played very well.  I especially admired Laurence Fishburne, this man has a great talent and ability to portray a strong leader.  We have seen it here and we have seen it in the Matrix.  Fishburne shines in both.
All in all, I strongly recommend Even Horizon to those who truly want to be scared.  Whether you will like this movie or not I cannot predict, but I know that it will scare you for sure.",1056412800,,1092,4.50253807106599

Once abroad the team is haunted by all sorts of spooky stuff and some of them go nuts.

After my second viewing of Event Horizon, I was left with a little bit more of a firm opinion on what I had just seen, but still, unfortunately, a lot of unanswered questions. As far as substance goes Event Horizon is lacking. There is very little exploration of what exactly is inhabiting the ship, and unless you've decided for yourself and firmly believe in what you've come up with the issue is never really resolved. Not that, for it's genre, it has to be, but I'm just curious about what exactly happened to the former crew of the Event Horizon and where they went... and what came back without them.
Ah well.
Event Horizon is not, by any means, an uplifting movie. It is generally successful as far as it's genre is concerned, so if you're a sci-fi/horror/thriller fan you won't be let down. It relies heavily on superficial horror, setting up quite a few scenes obviously (and enjoyably) just to give you a good jump, so if you like a good adrenaline rush I think you'll be pleased. As the movie progresses you'll come to find that it also relies heavily on disturbing visuals and by the climax they almost seem gratuitous, if not a little over the top.
I would suggest this movie for someone with something specific in mind. If you're a fan of Lawrence Fishburne, Sam Neill, or any of the supporting cast, pick this up and enjoy them in their roles. If you're a fan of the horror/sci-fi/thriller genre, pick this up because it delivers. But if you pick this up in a general mindset and expect to be blown away by a strong script that's firmly supported by amazing characters and a plot that's as thought provoking as it is horrifying with no major holes in it, you might be a little disappointed.

Event Horizon has all the essential elements that make for a great sci fi thriller. This movie's plot in itself is intriguing and scary.

This Movies concept of this ship going through a man made black hole which lead it into a real Hell is enough to scare me whereas I don't typically get scared from horror flicks. This movie raises interesting questions about the possiblity that a real Hell  exists out in the Universe which is something that our science cannot refute since our technology has not explored the far reaches of the universe.

One wonders how much money the producers received from the tobacco industry to write this into the script.  The scenario depicted, aside from violating public policy by skirting around laws against tobacco advertising and glamorizing smoking among the impressionable youth that often watch such movies, is actually absurd in that space ships, in addition to having a contained atmosphere that would increase the effect of the air pollution caused by smoking, generally contain a 100% oxygen atmosphere in which smoking would constitute a severe fire hazard.

You know why the movie ""Alien"" was scary?  Among other things, the alien itself was scary, not the ship and technology used by the crew.
Now how about the message picked up by the crew of the Louis & Clark.  Originally it says, ""Save me.""  OK, a voice from beyond the grave in another dimension.  That's pretty scary.  Then they realize it says, ""Save yourself.""  OK, still pretty scary.  An ominous warning from outside our reality.  Oh wait, there's more.  ""Save yourself from hell"" is the full message.

It made me ask myself, ""What if I'm wrong? What if Hell really does exist?"" The idea of winding up in the ""place of complete chaos"" that existed for Hell in this movie kept me up at night for weeks after seeing this movie.

If you really, really loathed this film - and it seems a lot of people did - then the chances are it's because it messed really badly with your head.

927195,4,6304744404,"I have just seen EVENT HORIZON on my 55""-screen TV w/surround sound system and I can conclude that it is the most shocking, unsettling, suspensful, creepy, and just plain old goryiest movie I've ever seen.

The movie is basically about a huge state-of-the-art ship called the EVENT HORIZON, which was built for faster that light speed travel in the year 2040. But it disappered withougt a trace. 7 years later, it suddenly reappered in Neptune's orbit. Now, a search and rescue crew led by Laurence Fishburne and the ship's desginer (Sam Neill) must search in the ship for any signs of the crew and find out why and how is disappered.

From the minute they crew steps on that ship, the movie turns from sci-fi to horror right away, and many scarry scenes follow. A factor which contributes heavily to that are the sets, which look great. The sets perfecty convey claustrophobic and gothic parts of the ship. The music is top-notch, too. Although the beginning is tecno, the rest is full of nail-biting themes that also enhances the movie. The acting is pretty good; Sam Neil and whoever plays SMITH's character deserves extra recognition. The special effects are good as well, accurately conveying the vastness of space, etc.

The only bad thing about this movie was the gore. There was WAY TOO MUCH! I have a very strong stomach for gore, but some of the stuff I saw in EVENT HORIZON was way to much. (Think about people cutting out each other's eyeballs and reaching in to each other's throats and pulling out guts. Or how abot somebody being pinned up to the ceiling by their SKIn with their chest OPENED Up with their guts FALLING OUT. And of course there's a bunch of subliminal shots of really nasty things. Unfortunately, some sick puppies might put it into slow motion. So, get the picture?)

All of the scary parts without the gore are great. (Luckily, most of the gore is in the last 30 minutes of the film, saving the hour before it.)

Most of the scares revolve around the regular ""BOO!!!!!"" scares where something is really quiet and then something loud happens. But some of the other scares are great. What really shines about this movie is that there is no monster or anything: It's all phycological. The ship is MANIPULATING the crew to become mentally unsteady. That creeped me out by itself. How the ship got that way, you'll just have to see the movie and find out.

By itself, it IS a solid horror flick. I'd give it a B+. But watch on an EMPTY stomach.

I remember feeling in the theatre when it ended ""no, don't end now, there's so much more we were meant to see"". I'm not talking about effects or gore as they are abundant and very well done but more so story and development of the fantastic idea presented. It's like the kid who has an amazing talent and is killed in an accident before they can reach. You feel robbed of something that doesn't come along too often.
BUT, there is still enough atmosphere and tension left over to make this movie very enjoyable on a pure scare factor. The rag tag crew is very one dimensional and obviously they are there as fodder for the body count. The movie does establish an incredible sense of menace and danger. In a way the loose ending is effective in hindsight. It provokes thought and imagination after the fact on what was on the other side of that gateway. The best horror often is the horror imagined.

927326,1,6304744404,"The ship designs both internally and externally are interesting enough to provide a proper stage for a sci-fi horror flick of high caliber. But very soon even the ship designs reveal themselves to be portentous and overwrought satanic props you might find in a Spinal Tap concert.  In the central bridge Larry Fishburne sits in command of his ponderous vessel.  His chair mounted to a mechanical arm that slowly carries him about the room to see his crew members and deliver his orders.  Visually its neat but you quickly realize if he would turn his head to the left and right and speak in a normal voice he could speak comfortably to everyone. Imagine if Captain Kirk floated the bridge chair around to Spock and Uhura every time he wanted to make a command and you have a fair idea of how cumbersome and silly it would seem.  This in itself does not destroy the movie but it is symbolic of how the director had difficulty letting go of ideas that were visually interesting but made no sense in the real world...or a future world.
 Event Horizon is encumbered by a lot of  heavy handed religious symbolism. The ship encounters a derelict space ship orbiting Neptune. The derelict vessel, an enormous metalic framework, is designed to resemble a crucifix.  It is sometimes shot upside down to hint that some evil is already present . Boarding the ship, crew members are found flayed in spectacularly bloody and gorey fashion with obvious satanic overtones. We discover the evil being done on the ship is causing physical manifestations of the darkest corners of the crewmen's minds. Perhaps Event Horizon was following the lead of Forbidden Planet where advancements in harnessing the mind's power through technology failed to figure in the dark corners of man's subconscious. Thereby unleashing a violent genie that could not be contained. If true it would explain the odd choice to set Event Horizon in outer space instead of a haunted house where it better belongs.  Forbidden Planet borrowed the intriguing concept of monsters from the mind from Shakespeare's Tempest and used it to great effect. But Event Horizon abandons it quickly.  The only question Event Horizon tries to ask is what if Hell were a specific place in a space ship parked around Neptune? The answer is no deeper than ""everyone who goes there would go mad, kill everyone and die.""  Event Horizon becomes a gore shocker and the crewmen go crazy and start gouging out their eyes and other outrageous stuff.  People can enjoy a gore flick but the absurd choice in Event Horizon was to make mediocre Sam Neil the centerpiece of the film and leave Larry Fishburne the thankless role of to react to the setpieces and Neils incomprehensible character. To quote Chris Mc Callister ""Sam Neil's character is sometimes clearly good, sometimes thoroughly evil, sometimes a good man tempted by evil, sometimes a good man possessed by evil, and sometimes an evil man who has been masquerading as good.""  In the end you don't know what he was and don't really care.  But Event Horizon also doesn't know how to select what is best about its story and what doesn't fit. Its a theological revelation tale, a sci fi bug hunt, a psychological haunted house flick and a slasher film all at once or maybe its none of the above. By being complex and infathomable perhaps it hoped someone would think it deep.  People that dig H.P. Lovecraft, satanic symbolism, or the '60s films the Haunting  or Hell House might find something to like in Event Horizon.

Dr. Weir(Sam Neil),a scientist who, in the not too distant future has created a revolutionary method of space travel.  The Warp Gravity drive was intended to punch a hole in space, a hole that the Event Horizon would be able to travel through, and end up on a completely different side of the universe.  A journey of several years would become a journy of mere minutes.....
After the drive's initial activation, the ship disappears.  Years later, a distress signal from the Event Horizon is picked up, and the brave Captain Miller(Fishburne), his rescue crew, and Dr. Weir are sent out to search for survivors.  When they get there, they find that the ship had indeed been somewhere...and when the ship itself seems to know what their worst fears are, where the ship has actually been becomes that much clearer.....

927330,4,6304744404,"Most critics who trash this film for being cliched, confusing and full of over-the-top violence overlook its most basic topic: memory. Traumatic memory itself can be all of these things, and this film is a fast and loose representation of what traumatic memory looks like in the bloody raw. Like the films ""Solaris"" and ""Hellraiser"" from which it borrows, ""Event Horizon"" takes the viewer through a manic and terrifying ride into the past. But this isn't the neat and orderly past of documented human history -- it's the messy, sloppy, out of control past that lurks in every troubled individual human psyche. Also like ""Solaris"" and ""Hellraiser,"" this film suggests that while human beings are usually incapable of controlling their worst or most frightening memories (such as the suicide or abandonment of a loved one in this film), alien or demonic beings ARE. Like Pinhead, the space vessel in this film asks its human victims to do nothing more than think upon their own darkest memories and to imagine how dark the memories of other people might be. It then makes these memories come alive with a vengeance, literally. This film isn't as theoretically frightening as ""Hellraiser"" and not as sublime as ""Solaris,"" but it's gorier, more gruesome, and more unapologetic. You gotta love it.

927332,2,6304744404,"Event Horizon can be viewed as two different movies, one fairly awful, the other simply tired. It offers thrills and spills aplenty, but the viewer in search of intelligent life is sure to be disappointed.  The actors do the best they can with what they have--""Now, when we drop these 500 gallons of red water on you, you look surprised, okay?""""Sure, but what's my motivation?""""Uh, it's supposed to be blood from outer space!"" but they don't have much to go on.
The first film is science fiction of a sort which I think, in spite of the comments of some reviewers here, will drive hard core sci-fi fans to distraction.  Within 30 seconds of the film opening, there is water dripping from a faucet on a space-station in orbit.  One character smokes cigarettes (yes, on an interplanetary rescue ship) in the open and the smoke mysteriously billows around him just as if there were gravity.  Now, granted, later on we see that we have developed anti-gravity, but there are more inconsistencies. Our intrepid heros end up in the orbit of Neptune, but there is some apparent turbulence in space, and space-clouds, and a lightening storm which no one seems to think is at all unusual in a vaccum.  They receive a distress call from the haunted ship, but Earth technology in 2047 doesn't allow them to cut out the high frequency interference enough to understand the message clearly--this in spite of the fact that I could do it at home on my Mac today in a matter of minutes.  By 2047 we've apparently developed enough technology to create gravity, contain a black hole, and warp space-time--we must have let our audio technology lapse as we put all our resources into physics--something had to give, I guess.  With regularity explosions make noise in a vaccum, and even though we get computer-graphic-created liquid globules in zero-gee, we never get zero-gee gas venting.  Oh, yeah, and in 2047 kids are apparently still wearing the same kind of bulky coats they wear now.  Design and fabric technology must have had to take a backseat to physics, too.  Beyond the setting, there is really nothing else that is sci-fi about this movie.
The premise, interesting as it could have been, exists simply to deliver the second film, a slasher/horror film along the lines of Nightmare on Elm Street.  And if you like Freddy Krueger, you are likely to enjoy Event Horizon.  The special effects (loads of gore, watery blood splashing in hundreds of gallons, Krueger-like makeup for Sam Neill and supporting ghosties) are neither bad nor exceptional.  We get the explanation that all these apparitions are supernatural, so just like Freddy Krueger they don't have to look real.  This kind of nonsense may make you jump, but there's nothing really intriguing about it.  The suspense derives solely from the whims of the director and his minions, and not from the storyline itself.  If literally anything can happen, why don't more imaginative things happen?  We've seen the stripey face horror makeup before, we've seen the buckets of blood, we've seen the eye in the middle of the palm....oh, wait, maybe real horror of hell is that it's boring!
The only person involved in this film with imagination was the set-designer, who created some pretty terrific looks, especially for the gravity drive.  As others have noted, there were many allusions to the look of other films (most notably Alien and 2001), but there was enough new in the design to be interesting.  However, if set-design is the only thing of merit, probably the movie is worth giving a pass.",988502400,18,3541,4.852159468438538

Sam Neill and Lawrence Fishburn lead the Thespian charge as two of the men sent to retrieve the lost Event Horizon Research Shuttle. Retrieval becomes Unnecessary when the entire crew seem to have deserted, or worse. (that is not a Spoiler, the Trailer gives away that information)
Sam and Lawrence are at each others throats most of the film and it's always fun to see Two Great Actors go Head to Head. Jason Isaacs, Joely Richardson and Sean Pertwee give Exceptional Supporting Performances, Isaacs and Pertwee Especially. Both have since proved themselves as Even better actors (Isaacs is in ""The Patriot"" and ""Divorcing Jack"". Pertwee is in ""Soldier"" and ""Love, Honour and Obey"") and have become two of my Favourite Supporting Actors.
The Sets are also very cool, much like the Original ""Alien"".

You also get to see an eyeless, nude woman who is apparently the good doctor's deceased wife.  She appears to him quite frequently and flashes the camera as she tries to coax him to go to hell with her.  Wonderful.
Just for a change of pace, the doctor gets possessed, rips his eyes out and rips out the chest of one of crew who is dangling by his skin from the ceiling.  It just keeps getting better and better, doesn't it?
The good doctor then becomes some kind of demon thingy that comes out of the fire looking like a flaming turd and throws fire at our heroic captain Fishburne.  Then the flaming turd turns into a 21st Century version of the guy from Hellraiser.
All in all, this is a terrible movie that is wanton in its demonic content, gore, demonic content, gore, and just for a change of pace, more gore.

927403,5,6304744404,"Laurence Fishburne, Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan, Sam Neill, Sean Pertwee and Jack Noseworthy head up the cast of director Paul Anderson's Science Fiction horror picture EVENT HORIZON.
Drawing from a multitude of sources, not least amongst them Andrei Tarkovsky's heady science fiction meditation SOLARIS, HELLRAISER, Kubrick's THE SHINING, ALIEN and even Bruce Clark's cheap 'n' cheerful GALAXY OF TERROR, this is a well put together, visually splendid big budget piece of science fiction schlock set in the year 2047 and concerning a mission to investigate the sudden mysterious reappearance of an experimental American spaceship (the titular) Event Horizon, which disappeared seven years previously and suddenly, out of nowhere, has pulled the old bad penny trick popping up unannounced in the orbit of Neptune. A salvage rescue team is required.
Mission commander / [space]ship's captain Laurence Fishburne and creepy scientist Sam Neill (designer of the mystery vessel) accompanied by a T-shirt- and army-green-clad crew of smart-talking pro's head off into the outer reaches of the solar system only to encounter an 'empty vessel', one that's not making much noise. Dead and deserted, the Event Horizon is no laughing matter at the best of times, but when boarding and further investigation turn up blood, corpses, dismembered body parts, mysterious Latin utterances on a last desperate ships log message (no 'stardate...blah blah blah' here!) and a decidedly unearthly presence; the trip assumes somewhat more than most had bargained for in the way of fun and games. Transpires the ship is really a space-age haunted house where spooky (and clearly obviously impossible) visions lure various of the crew members into terminal situations. A presence 'not of our dimension' (as Rod Serling might have opined) has domain over the Event Horizon, this disturbing presence perhaps connected to the black hole designed to warp space through which the ship had ventured and it wants something... .
EVENT HORIZON is a pleasing watch, superbly crafted on the technical side, the ship is gorgeously designed, borrowing from the dark, organic look of ALIEN providing the requisite sense of ominous foreboding, adding menacing touches such as teeth seemingly sprouting from bulwark doors and claw-like spikes inexplicably shooting out of the engine room floor. Adrian Biddle (101 DALMATIANS, FIERCE CREATURES) captures some of the more evocative, memorable images in recent times, assisted by a strong special effects crew and Production Designer Joseph Bennett. Unfortunately the films plotting is admittedly less inspired and inventive than the production design, hardly original, but it is nonetheless done with some style and seeming belief and the special effects are genuinely top-notch. The film is capably acted, competently penned and impressively helmed by director Paul Anderson (MORTAL KOMBAT and the underrated SHOPPING) and is an excellent mix of science fiction and horror movie genres. There is enough graphic violence for the censors to have been nervous about it's US 'R' rating whilst the setting is pure ALIEN. A special mention in dispatches for the soundtrack too; enjoyable and suitably creepy.
Much of EVENT HORIZON's criticism stemmed from its obviously borrowed plot elements, the primary reason it was so poorly received by audiences being simply because they did not know what to expect. It is not ALIEN, nor pitiful feelgood tripe such as STAR WARS, nor the crudity that is Barker's overrated HELLRAISER. Anderson simply heists the best elements from all of them. Despite the film's narrative shortcomings, the film succeeds on several levels. It is in many respects an excellent central idea, the question posed: What if hell was indeed a physical place you could actually go to? and what if that place lay in the depths of space?.
Ultimately the movie has a trashy 'B' movie charm about it and is destined to be seen as a classy, classic example of that 'something nasty in space' 'B' subgenre as typified by Norman J. Warren's equally impressive INSEMINOID / HORROR PLANET and of-course the ALIEN quartet.",982972800,19,4137,5.356374807987711

And most importantly, these characters act a little unrealistic when each meets their own personal nightmare.
But if it is the intention of the makers of this film to scare and disturb people, then they succeeded.  There are several scenes that you may forget about after you finish watching.  But wait about a week or two when you turn out your light and go to bed.
Plus this is a scary movie on a thematic level.  Regardless of how you feel about the scientific aspects of the movie, what if faster-than-light (FTL) travel produced catastrophic results?

I for one loved it, the Michael Kamen(Die Hard, Lethal Weapon)/Orbital score is top notch, the two different styles of these artists when combined are surprisingly effective.  Set design and special effects are much better than average (look for the duct tape holding Captain Miller's chair together - this helps to make the ""Lewis and Clark"" look as though it has been in some tight spots, which I thought was a clever touch).  While not the most original film (the concept of ""Folding Space"" comes from ""Dune"", ""Alien"" was likely an influence as well) it is still an atmospheric and spooky movie.

927513,4,6304744404,Event Horizon is a horror movie and a sci-fi movie. This combination is very effective and terrifying. An extremely imaginative storyline and top notch special effects.

927514,3,6304744404,"As has been noted here and elsewhere, there is not much new going on in ""Event Horizon"". Still, unoriginality is not the greatest sin a movie can make. In my opinion dullness would be a greater crime. ""Event Horizon"" drew me in from the beginning and created a sense of suspense that did not dissipate despite various flaws in the script and direction. These flaws include potentially interesting characters with not enough meat on their bones, and a typical ""explosive"" Hollywood climax.
""Event Horizon"" is beautiful to look at - the sets and effects are wonderfully realized, creating a sense of gothic foreboding - and the cast, working within the previously mentioned restraints of the script, are solid. There is some extreme gore in the film (most of it shown in rapid, nearly subliminal, shots)but I did not find it gratuitous despite its extremity.

However the film just falls apart as they seem to go beyond the universe. This is not even made clear.

927587,4,6304744404,"First off - Event Horizon, like the original Alien and The Thing, is a HORROR movie. Accept this from the outset and you will be able to judge it more fairly in terms of itself and not in terms of the inappropriate expectations other reviewers on this page appear to have had. Its conventions, techniques and devices are those of the horror genre. This is not, therefore, the kind of movie that will automatically appeal to the Total Recall, Star Wars or Aliens crowd. If, however, your movie tastes incline towards The Thing, Alien, The Exorcist, Hellraiser and the like, then guess what - this movie is not half as bad as non-horror fans would like to make out. The criticisms most often levelled at the movie - lack of clear explanation and motivations; tendency towards shock tactics; emphasis on blood and gore - smacks of the frustration of a science fiction fan who misguidedly wandered into the wrong movie. For horror fans, these are welcome staples of the genre and the same criticisms could apply equally to greats like The Exorcist, Night of the Living Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Alien. Admittedly, Event Horizon is not in the same league as these classics, but it is by no means way beneath it either (it's certainly better than Hellraiser). The only thing letting it down is the preposterous narrative device at the core of the story: some implausible nonsense about the folding of physical space to simulate light speed travel. It would have been better to leave the ""explanation"" out and rely solely and without much further explanation on its brilliant central premise: that a lost exploration vessel had inadvertently crossed over into Hell and returned. In any case, horror fans will have fun spotting the references to movies as diverse as Hellraiser, Alien and Don't Look Now. As a haunted house movie that happens to take place on a spaceship - it ain't half bad. I'll take it over Scream 3, Urban Legend and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer any day of the week. In any case, it more than passes the basic horror test: you won't be able to watch it alone with the lights off at midnight. Not even if you're an angry science fiction fan.

For one thing, it should have been explained  better how and why exactly the ship gained control of Dr. Weir (Sam Neill).  Most of the characters could have also been developed much more.  Most of  the trying-to-be-funny comments by the character Cooper after the Lewis and  Clark exploded didn't seem acted very well at all, nor did they fit well  with the rest of the movie.  There were also other parts where some of the  characters (including the evil Dr. Weill) just made some really stupid  mistakes which no one of their intelligence level could have actually made.

927590,5,6304744404,"""Liberate me, ex infernis..."" This was the  message the rescue  crew from Lewis & Clark heard from the Event Horizon as they went  deeper into the bowels of this derelict spaceship. The plot and story is  simply fantastic. The Event Horizon (name taken from a part of a black  hole) was sent on a mission beyond the boundaries of the solar system using  a gravity drive, a faster than light travel system devised by Prof. Weir  (Sam Neill). The gravity drive bends space to make travelling from one  point to another faster than light. Simply put, the gravity drive creates  an artificial black hole.  Somehow, something went wrong and the Event  Horizon was lost as it entered it's own black hole and was gone for 7  years. Finally, the ship came back but it came back with something in it.  The spaceship indeed went somewhere but it way way beyond the boundaries of  known universe. And not it brought something unseeing, something invisible  yet completely evil. The rescue crew boards the ship and finds no sign of  the crew. Thus, the story begins. It's more of a mental, psychological  horror rather than seeing an alien being. You don't see any monsters or  aliens here. The monster turns out to be the whole spaceship.
The effects  are good. Lawrence Fishburne will strike you as a hard core but fair  captain of the rescue ship. Sam Neill did a good job portraying himself as  a obsessed scientist eager to find where the Event Horizon has gone. There  are tons and tons of scary scenes. Strangely, the scariest part was when  Sam Neill was shaving with a razor, as he was scraping off the cream on his  neck with his razor, he hears something and then BOOM!!!! Scared the life  out of me!

927591,2,6304744404,"""Event Horizon"" tells the story of a salvage operation of the titualar spaceship.  Designed by the enigmatic Dr. Weir, Event Horizon was  the largest and most advanced spacecraft ever built (by man, anyway) when  it dissappeared on its maiden voyage.  Unknown by most, the ship was the  prototype for an experimental propulsion system using artificial gravity  wells, like those that surround black holes, to curve space.  This was  supposed to have the dual benefit of offering faster-than-light travel and  a leg-up on Albert Einstein.
Unfortunately, much like the doomed  experimental starship, ""Event Horizon"" fails because it can't  escape its firmly 20th century roots.  The conscience-plagued Dr. Weir can  no more best Einstein when his prodigal spaceship reappears, than the  producers of this film can succeed any one of dozens of films they  ripped-off to make this movie.  ""Alien"" is only one of the more  obvious ingredients, along with ""Jaws"" (the invisible monster)  and ""Frankenstein"".  The producers must have been asleep for the  past 20 years - the concept of humans running around like rats lost in the  dark maze of some mammoth and inhospitable spaceship - vast and  claustrophobic at the same time - has been done to death in movies,  straight-to-video, late-night cable and hyper-violent video games.  This is  the kind of movie begging for the ""Scream"" treatment - knowing,  self-reverential, yet self-parodying.  But ""Event Horizon"" takes  itself far too seriously - there are far too many British accents, giving  the show an arch ""Star Trek, nex Gen"" feel, while Larry Fishburne  is his usual dolemite self.  I like Fishburne, but his dead-serious  demeanor isn't served well here.  It's hard to get scared by a film that  remains so complacent in following other films - sqaundering possible plot  ideas.  Save for a horribly mutilated body, the ship is deserted.  It's not  so much that the script leaves the fate of the crew up to our imagination -  it doesn't seem to care a whit itself.  Why has it taken so long for the  ship to return?  Why was such an exotic technology tested on a manned  prototype rather than on an unmanned probe?  And why has the ship returned  to Neptune, rather than straight to Earth?  In films like the original  ""Alien"" and its countless rip-offs (remember  ""Outland""?) the source of evil turns out to be man, defined by  greed or petty hate.  The mysterious evil populating ""Event  Horizon"" is pure evil, pronounces Dr. Weir.  That means it has no  form, no definition and above all, no charachter.  In that last respect,  the film and the spaceship are one.  Yet not even that can raise a chill.  Instead, rent any of the first two Alien movies, X-Tro-2 (why not?) or the  first American Werewolf movie.",967939200,2,2767,4.942982456140351

And that's not even to  mention that it stars Sam Neill (Jurassic Park) and Laurence Fishburne (The  Matrix).
The oddest thing was that I mentioned it to a friend at work the  next day, who said that our boss had mentioned it earlier at lunch, simply  raving about it. And suddenly everyone was talking about how scary this  movie was, and no one could figure out why it hadn't received more media  attention!

927675,2,6304744404,"I went into the theater to see this film expecting what was promised in the trailer: a decent sci-fi based on the solid premise of a ship returning unmanned from an unknown fronteir. Instead what I got was a cheap horror  flick with high-budget special effects.
I think a lot of people were  generally disappointed that this wasn't the story everyone was led to  expect from the trailer. I rolled my eyes when I found out that the plot  simply borrowed a page from the story of the game Doom, rather than showing  some originality. If originality wasn't in the recipe, they still could  have done better by looking at similar ""where has it/(s)he been""  short stories for something with a little scary edginess.
According to a  friend, this version is a lame rewrite of the original script; apparently  the original was a lot closer to the trailer's premise, and in it the ship  had merely been somewhere else and its creator just went crazy. It's  unfortunate that what could have been one of the best sci-fis of the decade  was altered by some studio goon to make it into a horror film. The places  where the horror elements were spliced into the script stand out well  enough. And as if the screenwriters couldn't convince themselves that this  was a horror, they had to throw in a lot of pointless shock imagery in the  end just to throw in our faces: ""See? This is a horror. It must be a  horror because we're showing maggots and stuff on the screen.""
As  both sci-fi and horror, this film fails. I find the Twilight Zone a whole  lot spookier for the money. This movie only gets two stars because of the  acting and the effects, plus its strong beginning.

927676,4,6304744404,"Event Horizon: The beginning point of intense gravitation around a black hole or other singularity.
Event Horizon: An experimental starship constructed in 2040 to be the first faster than light (FTL) vessel capable  of reaching Proxima Centauri. Event Horizon lost with all hands only to  reappear in a decaying orbit around the 8th planet of our star system.
  And is another one of those haunted house in space films in the same vein  as Ridley Scott's 1979 `Alien'. In this new feature by Paul Anderson,  (Mortal Kombat). Mankind's reach for space has taken him somewhere he was  never meant to venture, a place of perverse evil and unimaginable sin.  However, this film strides past any notion of just being Hellraiser in  Space, and comes across as an intelligent science fiction movie that slowly  becomes a horror film. Anderson takes what we think frightens us and throws  it out the window. Because the monster lurking behind the door isn't from  another planet and dripping slime, it is from another dimension. It is  hostile. It is malevolent. And it is Evil in its purest form.
 The  Event Horizon appears suddenly, broadcasting an IFF and emergency beacon.  It is a gothic looking ship almost two kilometers long, appearing as though  it were carved from rusted iron and copper. Beautiful. Going out to meet is  the Lewis and Clark, a deep space rescue vessel whose crew specializes in  recovery operations like this. Captain Miller (Lawrence Fishborune) is  rankled to find an additional crew member added to the roster in the form  of Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill), who built the Event Horizon's  revolutionary gravity drive system and what was to have propelled the  massive ship between the stars. When we first meet Weir aboard the skeletal  Daylight Station, it is already obvious that he is a very troubled man- his  wife committed suicide and he is haunted by her.
 It takes 56 days  for the Lewis and Clark to make it out to Neptune where the Event Horizon  lies, wherein it plunges into the high atmosphere of the stormy planet to  make a link up with the historic vessel. Already something is amiss when a  sensor sweep returns dubious results on life readings. The ship is dead.  The crew is missing, saving for a single frozen eyeless cadaver that  crashes to the floor and shatters when the gravity is restored. Reaching  out from the blackness an unseen force has new toys to play with. One crew  member is pulled into the core of the gravity drive, others back away in  fear as something tries to break through a bulkhead, another sees her  crippled son pleading for help, the Captain is faced with a vision of an  old crew member who was immolated in an oxygen fire years ago. They point  to Weir for an explanation, but his response is unhelpful.
 The last  log is found and played back. Through half-seen glimpses of distortion  laced video the Lewis and Clark crew watches those of the Event Horizon  slaughter themselves in an orgy of blood and perversity- with one crewman  screaming as he holds his bloody eyeballs up to the camera, ""We don't need  these anymore!"" One by one the Lewis and Clark crew is slaughtered- one  dissected, one in a trance walks into an airlock and opens it to space,  another is led by visions of her crippled son into falling several stories  to her death in the engine room. Even Weir is affected by visions of his  dead wife, naked and eyeless. The survivors realize it is the Event Horizon  herself that is killing them and they make a mad dash to escape on the  Lewis and Clark only to discover that one of the spinal separation  explosives is missing aboard the Event Horizon.
 The rest you will  have to see for yourself.
 This is an excellent film, panned by the  critics, but I found it exciting, disturbing and visceral. How delightfully  un-Hollywood! Anderson makes excellent use of his effects budget; providing  us with convincing space vehicles, both inside and out. This film doesn't  have a break neck pace, rather it seems more methodical and deliberate, as  though the viewer was being stocked by the evil that infests the ship.  Scenes that shock are meant to, the violence goes past merely being gross  until it achieves an almost phobic state or mania. Sam Neill and Lawrence  Fishburne are very good and play against each other wonderfully, though  inter-character exchanges are brief and there is little chance to build the  characters into `real' people.
 I found the fact that my eyes were  not being burned out by one colossal effects sequence after another  refreshing. Like so many films these days, `The Matrix' and `The Phantom  Menace' spring to mind, like to bury their viewers in an avalanche of  special effects. This is done by and large to confuse the audience and  distract them from just how bad the story really is. Heaven help us if they  actually start producing films where the story is at least as important as  the effects. Event Horizon is not meant to be swallowed and lost by its  effects, instead it presents a rather esoteric story line that is enhanced  by its effects. Maybe if it had Gungans and Bullet Time effects people  would have liked it more.",963619200,9,5164,4.731981981981982

927678,2,6304744404,"In an era that has given us such films as ""The Matrix"" and ""The Phantom Menace,"" audiences have come to expect a lot, especially visually, and special effects are definitely one of the elements that separates the  memorable from the forgettable.  In the case of ""Event Horizon,"" there are  four key elements that separate it from total ""B"" movie status:  Fishburne,  Neill, Quinlan and Richardson; the bottom line is, the story, and the movie  itself, just doesn't live up to the star power involved with it.  The Event  Horizon is a spacecraft launched in 2040 to explore the ""boundaries"" of the  universe.  Somewhere just past Neptune, it disappears without a trace.  Seven years later, it shows up again, and a search and rescue ship is sent  to check it out.  Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) leads the crew, which  includes Peters (Kathleen Quinlan), Lt. Starck (Joely Richardson) and  Cooper (Richard T. Jones).  Also aboard is Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill),  who originally programmed the Event Horizon.  When they finally make  contact with the phantom Horizon, they find that the crew is dead or  missing, and the only clues they have are from the ships visual logs.  And  the news isn't pleasant.  The ship apparently ventured into some other  dimension, and returned with a life all it's own, including the ability to  discern the vulnerability of whomever happens to be aboard at the time; and  when Miller and his crew show up, the Horizon wastes no time in exploiting  the fears or remorse of the individuals who have blundered into it's  territory.  Soon they find themselves, along with the Horizon's crew,  trapped in a virtual ""Hell"" with nowhere to go; it's like the sci-fi  version of ""Hotel California,"" where you can check in, but you can never  leave.  The concept of the story is interesting, but the transfer  from the written page to the screen falls a bit short.  Neither the story  nor the characters are developed anywhere near well enough; we get what  amounts to a mere glimpse into what makes Miller and Peters tick, and a  little more (but still not nearly enough) into the background of Weir.  Throughout the film there are flashes of the Horizon's crew, trapped in  this Hell they've entered, with plenty of blood and gore thrown at you very  quickly, just enough to give you the idea of what's going on.  But after  awhile, these flashes seem redundant and lose any significance they may  have had to begin with.  The same process is used to play out the  susceptibilities of Miller (what happened to a former crew member of his),  Peters (her son) and Weir (his wife).  There are some shocking moments, but  not enough to sustain much interest, and the computer graphics are not up  to standard by a long shot.  Especially early in the film, much of it has  an animated look, like what you would have expected maybe twenty years ago  (what was great in a movie like ""Tron,"" for example, doesn't cut it today).  The supporting cast includes Jack Noseworthy (Justin), Jason Isaacs  (D.J.), Sean Pertwee (Smith), Peter Marinker (Kilpatrick), Holley Chant  (Claire) and Barclay Wright (Denny).  The performances are credible enough,  especially by Fishburne and Quinlan, but director Paul Anderson has wrung  little out of what he had to work with, and it's all delivered fairly  unimaginatively.  The special effects are mediocre, and in the end, what  you have with ""Event Horizon,"" is essentially a pretty decent ""B"" movie.  There's a few thrills and some suspense, but don't go into this one  expecting too much of a return on your investment of time or money.",962668800,4,3599,4.844628099173554
927679,2,6304744404,"'Event Horizon' had a lot of promise, and is entertaining enough to watch, but it's extremely unsatisfying and you'll end up wondering why the film-makers didn't spend more time working out a decent screenplay. It  reminds me of 'Lost in Space ' - it's a technical showcase, with absolutely  no film beneath it.
In interviews at the time, the creators were clear  that they wanted to make a 'haunted house movie in space', one which was  neither hyper-logical nor particularly plausible, but scary. The end result  is more or less succesful on those terms - it doesn't make much sense, and  it's scary, but not in a particularly clever way. Watching this at the  cinema I was constantly aware that, in lieu of genuine shocks, the film  used loud noises and bright lights to shock the audience - over and over  again. You know the drill - a character walks into a room - he looks  around, but there's nothing there - he breathes a sigh of relief - BANG! -  oh, it's just the cat - BANG! - the monster! Run away!
Anyway, that's how  this goes, all the time, but without the monster. Instead, the film has us  believe that the 'Event Horizon' is possessed by Hell and that,  'Sphere'-like, it's using people's nightmares against them. Over the course  of the film many of the main characters die. Sam Neill gets to act satanic.  There are lots and lots of bits from other films, and the tone varies  wildly - one moment it's ultra-gothic horror, the next moment it's a  light-hearted action film.
The good things, then - it looks fantastic.  Really, it does. The sets are convincing, and the effects are amazingly  well-done, although often implausible, and the designs are inventive,  whilst borrowing liberally from elsewhere. The half-seen glimpses into hell  are scary, and the finale is, uniquely, shot in ultra-bright light. The  cast is a mixed bunch - Lawrence Fishburne is instantly convincing as the  Captain of the rescue ship, Sean Pertwee has 'seedy mechanic' written on  his chin, whilst Joely Richardson effortlessly gives the impression that  she is an upper-middle-class actress best suited to period dramas. Sam  Neill is odd - he's a great actor, and would have made a decent Bond, but  it's hard to see him as a villain, especially a satanic one. It's as if  Bill Cosby was the devil, or Richard Bryers. Lastly, although you'll hate  it for not trying harder, it does have a distinctive atmosphere of menace.  The setting - high in the atmosphere of Neptune, months away from rescue,  helps.
What extras do you get on DVD? A trailer. A box. And an inlay  card. It's THX-ed, so it looks nice if you have an expensive telly.

ButI believe that instead of a cheesy rip-off, what we have here is a very well laid out movie that, if viewed with an open mind, will shock you and horrify you at the same time.  There is a good deal of gore, which I admit can be a negative.  But as horror genius Clive Barker once said: ""You can't make an omlet without breaking a few eggs, and you can't make a horror movie without breaking a few heads."" There are also some great performances here by Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Neill.  Also you may want to take a close look at a truly inventive production design, giving the interior and exterior of the ship the look of a seventeenth century torture chamber.  All elements combined makes for a really freaky experience.  Best viewed alone, in a really dark room with a great sound system.
Also, check out the ""written by"" credit.  Although the first draft was by Philip Eisner, A-list writer Andrew Kevin Walker penned the final draft.  You may remember him as the screenwriter of ""Seven"", ""Eight Millimeter"", and ""Sleepy Hollow.""",957312000,17,1166,4.5673076923076925

(which many films of this kind don't) Laurance and Sam are great in the leads and the supporting cast are also excellant. The  special effects are State-of-the-art and it blows the simarlarly themed  film ""Sphere"" out of the water.",956361600,5,397,4.5

So, I think the gore is well placed to depict the eternal torment of the damned, if you will.  At least the worst of it is contained to a bunch of quick flashes, I think  that freaked me out more than if the camera were to linger over the images.  It seemed more frightening than disgusting...
The F/X are great, except  near the beginning where the junk is floating in zero-G.  That stuff,  especially the wrist-watch, really looks fake.  But the ship is well done.  The round, rotating hallway that leads into the Heart (whatever they call  it) is very cool.
Check this flick if you enjoy space-type stuff or  horror, as there's plenty of both.
One more thing...  What's the scoop  with the entrance and exit sound tracks?  They're both techno, while the  rest of the movie's tracks definately aren't.  I liked the tracks, but what  the heck, it doesn't make sense.

But seriously, I really was blown away by  this movie.  Call it ""The Shining"" in space, but even more  frightening.  It has the perfect combination of horror, suspense, special  effects, and cast.  The horror elements are successful on the obvious AND  subtle levels (psychologically) and THAT is what makes this movie  kick.

Paying homage to (or ripping off, depending on your point of view) such films as  ALIEN and THE SHINING, this film has some pretty good scares, even for the  hard-boiled horror fan. The production design is first-rate, and the  visuals (such as the ship in zero-g) are really nice. The Dolby Digital  sound is OK, but not the best, with the way-too-exaggerated difference  between the volume levels of different scenes being especially  distracting.
While there is a reasonable effort to base the film on sound  science, some variances are particularly egregious. Having the ships gently  floating in the upper Neptunian clouds while supposedly in orbit  immediately comes to mind as a cinematic crime against nature.

There is a  good deal of forshadowing that tends to ruin a bit of the film, but it  isn't big enough to hurt it too much.  The acting is top notch, even though  many of the characters are paper thin.  Despite this, this movie has so  many jumps that are well deserved.

How appropriate for this Sci-Fi set gothic Horror.  I loved this twist on the  derilict spaceship plotline.  At the beginning of the movie it feels like  another Star Trek - Battlestar Galactica-esque movie; you are in deep space  searching for a lost ship and then when you find it there are no life  signs. The movie stays calm for exactly 15 minutes.. then all Hell breaks  loose, literally. I have seen such darkness come from H.R. Geiger as and  artist, and Clive Barker as a writer so you will understand my shock when I  found neither name attached to the film. With a feel like ""Hellraiser"" and  nonstop action like - well, anything with Bruce Willis - ""Event Horizon""  grabbed my attention from the first pulse-pounding chord of it's soundtrack  to the very last (?) scream.  I enjoyed seeing the dark transition of Dr.  Weir from a seemingly normal scientist to an individual so obsessed that he  becomes the darkness we all fear.  Sam Neill has shown a tremendous expanse  of acting through the past several years, from a Palentologist in ""Jurassic  Park"" to the fantastic ""Merlin"" even as far back as ""Dead Calm"" he has  unerringly played the good guy, it's a delicious twist to have him cast as  the antagonist in Paul Anderson's horrifying tale.  The one hard point in  the movie is the decision one must make as a viewer, can you really hate  this man?  From the beginning of the movie we share his pain and loss, we  share his desire and then are challenged to share his mania a truly unique  psychological horror. I must give this a perfect ""10"" as this movie shows  no signs of a ""cheese factor,"" no overacting, nothing overdone and  everything played and built to perfection.

  This movie has everything I'm looking for in a movie. Some  have said it's kind of short on plot. This may be true, but a movie like  this isn't really about the plot. It's all about atmosphere. And this movie  has the darkest, most forboding atmosphere I've seen since Alfred  Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"". This movie is, of course, on a totally  different plane than ""Rebecca"", but I only mention it because of  similar atmospheres.
  The acting is professional all around, and the  characters, while interesting enough, remain somewhat undeveloped  throughout.
  There's terrific suspense here too. I actually enjoyed  the suspense leading up to the grand finale more than the finale itself,  which was more of a horror-style cliche to me, albeit well-executed.
  The sets are strikingly gorgeous, and the overall look of the film is  beyond excellent, conveying the mood like few other films have ever  done.

Unfortunately the plot and  editing seem to work against each other and some stuff gets lost in the  shuffle.  For those who haven't seen this, I'll try not to ruin things but  when a lead character starts to go Jack Nicholson on the audience there  doesn't appear to be any clear reason or any hint of why this is happening.  A side shot at this reasoning would have been a great plot addition.  So  expect a few holes but overall a solid set of performances, script  execution and awesome effects.

I think the problem with the film's acceptance was one of expectation; the  gore content was minimized in the trailers and a lot of people were taken  by surprise and repulsed (but nobody walked out).  There is a riveting pace  and atmosphere to this movie that keeps you from looking away in spite of  the nausea in the pit of your stomach...the idea that there is a parallel  universe just beyond reach of ours where true evil resides, and that  technology exists that can open the doorway for you and I to experience the  most grotesque torture and punishment imaginable at the hands of  unspeakable beings, is frightening and played for all it is worth.  The  acting is superb all around, particularly Fishburne and Neil.
Comparisons  with Sphere are misplaced, which held my interest for at most by 45 minutes  wnd was followed by sheer boredom.  There is no comparison.  If you want to  experience  true horror and have a grand preview of Hell, see Event  Horizon.

Lawrence  Fishburne once again shows his versatility and brilliance as an actor, and  Sam Neill plays a convincing scientist, who, like Dr. Frankenstein before  him, gets destroyed by his own creation.  The rest of the cast was equally  brillant. Third, there's the effects.  The effects in this movie were so  strong that it will probably look current 10 years from now.

The enemy  force at work I took to be Satanistic in nature, and I definitely would  have shied away from this movie if I had known about it.  I think the main  problem with this movie is that it just kept sinking lower and lower into a  bleak oblivion.  You have to have up beat and down beats once and awhile.  But the movie didn't have that.  It reminded me a lot of ""Dead  Ringers"" (which is THE worst movie I've seen) where the main character  just continuously sinks into a twisted world of madness and depression for  basically the last two acts.  I felt that the promotion of the movie should  have been more honest about the nature of it.  Instead, the trailer shows  the science fiction premise of scientists finding a ship that has become  alive somehow.  But it is really about how this ship encountered an evil  force beyond comprehension that ends up possessing one of the main  characters.  If you want to make a horror movie, fine, make one but tell  people that it is a horror movie.  This movie has little to do with science  fiction and more to do with promoting some sick Satanistic vision.  There  was one good scene in the movie: where a character gets stuck out in space  for a few seconds.  I don't remember any movie tackling a scene like this,  and I thought it was handled very well in that it was realistic and  gripping.

928189,4,6304744404,"Around the early 60's, a film called ""The Haunting"" dazzled critics by giving you a good psychological horror story while never showing you the ghosts. Then, in the late 70's, Disney produced a sci-fi feature  called, ""The Black Hole"". In this, the characters learn that  dealing with a black hole is not the wisest of things to do.
1997 and  Paul Anderson(""Mortal Kombat"", ""Soldier"") bring you  ""Event Horizon"" to expand on this and to even offer a what-if  scenario.
Why did critics bash this? To me, this is what true horror  films lack: substance. I am talking about pure psychological terror that  not only gets the characters, but to the audience as well. Why the  five-star reviews? Because frankly, the performances were good, the special  effects were spectacular, and the stuff seen on the screen hasn't been this  terrifying since 1963's ""The Haunting"". Now, take a bit of that  film, mix in ""2001"" for space effects, the claustrophobia of  ""Alien"", a dash of ""The Haunting of Hell House"", a cup  of ""The Black Hole"", a pinch of ""The Shining"", and you  wind up with one of the most brilliant psychological horror films of the  year.
Sam Neill plays an astronaut who, along with a crew of astronauts,  goes out to Neptune to investigate the strange ""Flying  Dutchman""-like appearance of a ship called, ""Event Horizon"".  The myth goes that the ship was sent on a mission through a fold in space  and never reappeared for years. Now it's back. And it's lacking the crew.  The only presence that sits aboard the ship is some sort of unseen force  that preys on the minds and fears of its inhabitants. But, like ""The  Haunting"", you never know if the astronauts are dreaming what they are  seeing or if this thing really exists because you only see their delusions  and their psychotic reactions to them. All they do know is that the ship  came from somewhere...and it is made of absolute evil.
Maltin bashed this  film for not explaining what was causing the hauntings. That's the point  and another Maltin-contradiction. It worked so well with ""The  Haunting"" where you never really learned what was causing the mishaps.  That's the mystery of it all and is part of what makes ""Event  Horizon"" so much fun to watch. You don't know what is haunting the  ship. And you don't want to know. Just look at what happens to the crew, as  the astronauts soon find out...
Did it go to another system? Or maybe to  a different dimension? Or perhaps, a place that we have yet to  comprehend...?
And do we need to really need to know?
Perhaps, the  answer lies in our minds, my friends, the greatest of all mysteries and one  that we may never solve.

928307,1,6304744404,"I agree with a point made by an earlier reviewer that you have to take movies for what they are, only this one seems to have no idea what it wants to be.  It starts off to be a fascinating look into a spaceship lost for  years in parts unknown. It almost has the feel of a Rendezvouz with Rama  type atmosphere, because the ship appears to be deserted.  This is why the  rest of the movie is so disappointing.  The plot dissolves to nothing  within the span of a few minutes and all of a sudden its ""Let's see  how much blood we can use in this movie before the ending credits!""  There was absolutely nothing redeeming about the movie from that point on  except possibly a scene near the end.  By that time, however, I just wanted  the ridiculous thing to be over so I could leave.  If this had been  designed as a horror flick from the outset, it still would have been a bad  one, but could have rescued a star.  The reason it gets the lowest rating  is the sheer disappointment it leaves you with after such a promising  start.  I can honestly say that this is one of the 5 worst movies I've EVER  seen.",920851200,5,1105,4.1469194312796205
928308,4,6304744404,"I saw Event Horizon in the theater, and it scared the s**t out of me. I don't scare very easily; I saw Alien when I was in 6th grade and the only thing that upset me was my fear that the alien would eat the cat. I was a  little annoyed at the open-endedness of the plot, but the more times I  watched it, the more I appreciated it. It leaves much room for speculation  about where exactly the ship went, or how it killed the crew, of where that  guy who intones the infamous words, ""Liberate tuteme ex inferis,""  came from (actually how he got onto the ship), and I could go on! I loved  the gore, I wish it had been a bit more explicit so I could see and  understand better, but what the hell? It was a great movie!",920764800,,716,3.965034965034965
928309,5,6304744404,"First of all, this film was ORIGINAL. Everyone always gripes about how movies are all cut from the same cloth today, yet when Event Horizon--a movie unique unto itself--is released, it receives bad press...Why is that?  It has an engaging cast with great acting, a unique plot with more than  adequate special effects, and a sense of wonder about and amazement about  it that's hard to find in movies today. People gripe about the movie not  explaining what's happening. I have news for you:  YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO  UNDERSTAND IT! Anderson reveals enough to let the viewer guess at the dark  implications of the movie but leaves it ultimately open-ended. How in Hell  can that be bad? Another objection is the use of gore in it. Well, there  were only a handful of scenes of actual violence, and those were used  sparingly to punctuate the sense of menace surrounding the movie. Hell,  Texas Chainsaw Massacre had more violence without any of the subtlety Event  Horizon possesses yet is considered a classic. People just need to open  their eyes and realize the movie was intended to be as it is. It is not a  bad movie at all...In fact, I'd consider it one of the best movies made in  the past decade. At least it didn't rely on revisionist history--unlike  James Cameron's most recent effort--to sell tickets. Bottom line: It's a  great movie. Watch it with an open mind, and you'll like it.",920592000,,1395,4.698347107438017
928370,1,6304744404,"I'm a big fan of science fiction (and suspense well done), and the trailer for this look fascinating. The beginning of the film doesn't dissapoint. It is foreboding and quickly captures one's attention. Unfortunately, as more  of the mystery becomes revealed, it turns into a gore-fest, with little or  no redeeming features. The ending (the last 25 seconds, that is) is clever,  but it's been done before.
If you would like a suspenseful science  fiction film that probably doesn't require an airsickness bag, I'd  recommend _Alien_ or _The Abyss_. (For that matter, _Lifepod_ was better  than this.) Both are excellent dramas, and, in particular, _The Abyss_ has  some of the best film acting one sees. If you want something frightening,  try _The Silence of the Lambs_, which is the only film I've ever seen that  I actually found frightening.
The production values are good, as are the  special effects, but the film fails to add up on a number of levels.  Essentially, the ship, designed to use a folding space technology to move  from any point in space to any other, actually enters a ""dimension of  pure chaos."" Chaos, apparently, can only be manifested by bloody  slashings and murders, cannibalism, and ripping one's eyes out.
Bottom  line: Thankfully, I only rented it.",916963200,6,1280,4.971698113207547
928371,4,6304744404,"This is an excellent science fiction horror flick. A party of specialist returns to the lost spacecraft that can travel through the use of black holes/worm holes, hence the name ""Event Horizon"". Oddly, the bad  guy is not the ship, nor is it Sam Neill; the being to detest in this movie  is the universally foreign inhabitant of the ""Event Horizon""",915062400,,348,4.688524590163935
928372,2,6304744404,"The sets and special effects in this movie are fantastic. The premise is, too: an artificial black hole used as a space-drive opens a wormhole into a dimension so different from ours that it is incomprehensible to the human  imagination. The crew of the rescue ship is great, too: a rough and tumble  bunch of merchant-marine types sent on the Mission from Hell. The script  has plenty of wit and explores deep psychological dimensions of the  characters. So why was I so DISAPPOINTED by the end of this movie that I'm  giving it two stars? Because the plot completely fell apart about half way  through the movie. You never learn why, how, or what the crew is up  against. None of the threads so carefully woven in the beginning of the  film are tied up at the end, and the whole movie just disolves into a blood  bath (literally), climaxing in a half hour of everyone screaming at the top  of their lungs and running around aimlessly to escape less and less  plausible or explicable forms of horror. To compare this movie to a  masterpiece of suspense and plotting like Alien is rediculous. My advice:  get this movie, and don't bother watching the last half hour. The  spectacular opening zoom sequence is probably worth the cost of the DVD (or  tape) anyway.",914889600,2,1262,4.621621621621622

7876416,5,6304744404,"Event Horizon, is one of my all time favorite science-fiction/horror movies. I think it had a brilliant cast, a great script, wonderful score and sound design and absolutely terrifying special/awesome practical effects.

I've seen the film at least 20 times now and it still sends chills up my spine as much as the first time I saw it in the movie theater. I'll just never grow tired of watching it. I even have a recorded copy from one of the movie channels that I keep saved on DVR so I can watch it whenever. Not to mention I own every version that's ever been released on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray.

But, as my review title mentions, I still lament that the extended Directions Cut has never been released, and it probably never will be according to the director Paul W.S. Anderson. The original cut of Event Horizon contains am extra 35 minutes of footage that has never seen the light of day on any releases thus far. You can read below what he has said on the matter of releasing the original extended cut, web-based wss taken from a Facebook Q&A: Live event in 2017.

Paul W.S. Anderson (Event Horizon director on Extended Cut off the film)

""There was a lot more that was shot that isn't in the movie, Paul W.S. Anderson confirmed. But youll never see the messed up version because we made Event before the kind of DVD revolution. You know, DVD ushered in this era when you had to have additional footage, deleted scenes, things like that. There was no call for that back when we were just doing VHS cassettes and LaserDiscs.

So the material just wasn't archived very well, and since the movie became a big cult classic, Paramount have asked us to come back in and do different versions and we looked for the material, and it just doesnt exist.""

Now, the Special Collector's Edition of the Event Horizon DVD release, did in fact contain a small amount of the original cut of the film. They were included as extras and you can see they aren't polished up like the main film is, of course.  But I still want to view the original version of this film, ""the messed up version"" as Anderson put it. There used to be an IMBD post about all of the crazy stuff that went into making those insane deleted scenes if you can still find the link online.

Despite what Paul W.S. Anderson said, I am pretty sure a copy of the original extended cut does exist out there, only it's a VHS copy. Because I first remember reading online that the original film prints were found in of all places, in some filthy mine in Transylvania, too damaged to salvage apparently. I know that sounds implausible and silly, but I'm just relaying what I've researched online.

Still, that VHS copy of the original cut of Event Horizon wasn't mentioned as being found by the film's producer I a shoebox in his house or something like that. So, while Anderson says they don't have the means to release this version.

Well, I've read stories on more than one occasion for other film releases where they were able to take an original cut of a film from an old VHS tape. And work their editing magic enough to transfer it to a watchable DVD or now a blu-ray copy. So, I'm really still holding out hope that because the producer found this intact VHS copy of the extended and original cut. That maybe they will finally work towards getting it fixed and released for us to watch and buy finally.

As long as I can watch it decently enough, I don't even care if it's not up to today's standards in terms of quality. I'd still buy it regardless just to finally see the original version. Please make this happen.",1523923200,,3573,4.464723926380368
