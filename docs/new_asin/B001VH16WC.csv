Also, it is by no means ""complete"" as it does not address disassembly of the slide only routine maintenance and disassembly of only the frame",1519603200,,246,4.590909090909091

8346365,5,B001VH16WC,"I had viewed a number of pieces of this DVD on youtube, but it's great to have them all assembled on a DVD.  EXTREMELY clear and informative steps to help with many armorer and upgrade tasks.  With this information I have become comfortable with COMPLETE dis-assembly, parts replacement, and re assembly of my 92 series pistols.",1442188800,,328,4.839285714285714
