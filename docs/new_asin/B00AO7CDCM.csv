5462886,5,B00AO7CDCM,"It is a pure pleasure to watch the original members of Clannad all together again, playing and singing my favorite songs from many of their albums which I have in my collection. I enjoy watching the live performance in addition to hearing the music. That just enhances my enjoyment of the music.",1389225600,2,295,4.6923076923076925
5462887,5,B00AO7CDCM,"At last Clannad have a live dvd to appease their many fans, it has a great selection of songs that will please anyone who has loved their music over the years. even though the years have past since their glory days Clannad can still deliver the goods so sit back open a bottle of wine,dim the lights and soak up the wonderful Clannad sounds.",1378512000,,341,4.34375
5462888,5,B00AO7CDCM,"We watched this live concert via iTunes, and liked it so much we ordered the DVD.  We've collected many Clannad CDs over the years, but never have seen them perform.  It is always a pleasure to see the real people behind the music, and this DVD does not disappoint.  Seeing Clannad members perform ""live"" demonstrates what fine and multi-talented musicians they are.  The setting, Dublin's Christ Church Cathedral, is small and impressive.  One of the best parts of the concert was an appearance by Anuna, an Irish choir/vocal group with whom I was not familiar.  Downloaded several of their albums after seeing them, and they are wonderful.  All in all, if you are a fan of Clannad, this is a superb concert, very well done.  Sound quality, filming, and setting all top notch.",1378339200,8,777,4.7894736842105265
5462889,5,B00AO7CDCM,"Yes having a live performance of Clannad is something special. The venue at Christ Church was brilliant and giving they haven't sung together for a while, the Clannad sound is still alive and well.",1371427200,7,197,4.823529411764706
8555156,1,B00AO7CDCM,Not at all what I expected. Not sellers fault. Have all of Clannads CD's expected a better concert.,1523577600,,99,4.555555555555555

8555158,5,B00AO7CDCM,Absolutely terrific. Very poignant since both Moya's dad and cousin( who is part of this concert) have both passed since this performance. I saw them live in the 90's and they sound just as good as ever.,1482451200,2,203,4.513513513513513

8555163,5,B00AO7CDCM,"Having been to Ireland in 2007 and visited Christ Church, it was especially meaningful to me that this is where Clannad chose to stage their reunion concert. I'm so grateful they filmed it and released it on this DVD. It's pure magic. The song selection is excellent, concentrating on their Celtic and ethereal material. It looks and sounds amazing. This is a concert DVD that I will watch over and over again. Just pop it in your player and your house is filled with beautiful sights and sounds.",1398816000,3,496,4.6477272727272725
8555164,5,B00AO7CDCM,"Outstanding venue and performance! I can only play it, though, on my computer, because it is not region 1 or manufactured for American dvd players.  I shouldn't have assumed that since I was buying if from a Florida distributor, that it would play within the country of sale.  But the music is PHENOMENAL!",1390694400,4,305,4.735849056603773
8555165,5,B00AO7CDCM,"A processional through the history of this great Irish band, from traditional tunes to the original music for film and television that brought them worldwide fame, featuring most of the original members.

Assisted at various times by additional string players, a keyboardist and percussionist, and the Irish choir Anuna, the performance is well shot in widescreen and well recorded in stereo audio. I would have loved to hear a surround mix that reproduced the acoustics of the cathedral, but what's here is clean, well-mixed, balanced, and beautiful.

Similarly, this would have been amazing in HD (and I'll bet it was shot that way) but there's apparently no Blu-ray available. The DVD video is OK, though, and upscaled fairly well on my Sony BD player.

The important thing is that it all sounds exactly as a fan might dream it would sound. The distinctive upright bass, the harp, Moire's voice, the harmonies, and particularly the choral segments, enhanced by Anuna to sound even more glorious than the originals.

If you love Clannad, don't hesitate to buy this DVD. And watch for them at a concert venue near you; this event celebrated the band's return to active status. They're touring even as I write this.",1389398400,3,1215,4.970443349753695
