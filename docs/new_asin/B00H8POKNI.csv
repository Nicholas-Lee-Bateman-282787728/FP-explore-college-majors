6141662,5,B00H8POKNI,"This DVD is indeed priceless as it contains so much information on the history and culture of Trinidad and Tobago done in a whimsical and rather entertaining manner, apart from the ordinary hum drum of a documentary.

I look forward to other DVD's from Paolo Kernahan.",1391126400,,268,4.826086956521739
6141663,5,B00H8POKNI,"This DVD was very professionally done and reflected the diversity of Trinidad & Tobago.

There were episodes on the Hindu Festival of Divali, the Patois language and old plantation homes with their interesting architecture from different parts of Trinidad.

The quality of the production was excellent, well researched and events / scenery clearly and accurately documented / captured on film.

This DVD makes a great addition to ones library and emphasizes the need to preserve the architecture of the past.

I purchased a few copies as Christmas gifts for expat Trinis who may sometimes feel home sick and want to reminisce.",1390348800,2,626,5.1683168316831685
8630955,2,B00H8POKNI,"A mislabeled amateurish and boring  production.  It should be called ""old houses in Trinidad.""",1477699200,,94,5.642857142857143
8630956,5,B00H8POKNI,The DVD gave insight into the history of some of Trinidad's architecture and culture. Yet another great production from this company and I was able to learn so much about my country. Very proud! Makes a great gift for foreigners and locals!,1475539200,,240,4.738095238095238

8630958,5,B00H8POKNI,"Got this as a Christmas gift and found myself glued to the screen. Looked at the entire DVD in one go. Excellent filming, and the narrative delivery draws the viewer in... and the amount of information is impressive. I didn't know how little I knew! I highly recommend this for anyone living in the country or planning to visit. It's a Must have.",1400198400,,346,4.507936507936508
8630959,5,B00H8POKNI,This DVD has become one of my prized possessions. It encapsulates important information on the history and culture of Trinidad and Tobago. The highlighting of little known facts leaves the viewer enthralled from beginning to end of each documentary. I especially liked the piece on the Patois language (and its relation to culture) as it explored its uniqueness and impact on Trinidad's cultural landscape. Superb work on this production.,1395878400,3,438,5.36231884057971
8630960,5,B00H8POKNI,"Very much enjoyed sitting down and seeing historical homes and sights of our beautiful T&T. Paolo and crew are doing a wonderful job at creating and keeping a video record of places we grew up with but are now falling away with time. Hopefully these DVD's will spur more action in T&T to designate and preserve landmark buildings and sites, for the sake of our national heritage and future generations. Kudos Paolo.",1395878400,2,415,4.777777777777778
8630961,5,B00H8POKNI,"Looking at this production was so informative and inspiring it left me wanting more. Growing up in Trinidad it was common to see these homes and it came as a surprise to know that some of them still exist. The homes are beautiful in design and Paolo did an excellent job directing the viewer to the style of design and the designer himself. Paolo made each home come alive with his excellent narration of its history and occupants. The viewer is left informed, satisfied, inspired and wanting more. Excellent job. I highly recommend this for personal use and for gifts.",1392681600,2,569,4.7
8630962,5,B00H8POKNI,"Having been born in a rural community, and seeing the destruction of history, this video gave rebirth to my reflections of days gone by. I first heard about this video from Angelo Bisessarsingh, another person with historical desires. Capturing the essence of the various communities visited, and how its residents strive to maintain their traditions and cultures through generations. This DVD is worth entry into the schools within the Caribbean, and well as North American thirst for Caribbean history.

Looking forward to the release of the remaining 3 DVDs. I SALUTE Paolo on his endeavors...",1392076800,2,596,5.273684210526316
8630963,5,B00H8POKNI,"Paolo Kernahan does a masterful job of revealing several aspects of Trinidad and Tobago culture that the average visitor or even resident will not ever see or know about. I was born and raised in Trinidad over fifty years ago and I learnt so much about my own culture and history. I was moved and enthralled by his tastefully done journey through a few of the many facets of Trini culture. I showed my friends and family from both sides of the Atlantic the documentary and they were equally riveted to the presentation. For anyone who really wants to discover just some of Trinidad and Tobago culture that no tour or tourist visit can offer, this is definitely the DVD to get.",1392076800,2,676,4.549180327868853
8630964,5,B00H8POKNI,"This is the second DVD that I have purchased from Idiom Productions Limited and I'd recommend purchasing it purely on the basis of its quality and the professionalism of the team that brought it to life. The scenery/cinematography is excellent and serves to create a mystical atmosphere that pervades the production and which is quite apt given the content. In addition,Paolo Kernahan does not shy away from his passion for the subjects as he shares for his passion for his country and that makes for an even better production. The inclusion of an episode guide is quite a nifty idea too.

Trinidad and Tobago is rich in culture and when one faces the reality that our culture is not just changing but getting lost altogether it makes one recognise just how priceless this DVD is.

At least two of the great houses featured have been lost to us and all future generations and this underscores the importance of the work being done by Idiom Productions Limited in preserving the great houses and their stories (fact or fiction) on film. The recording of the Ramleela story and Divali captures the joy of the festival and its place in our story as Trinbagonians (I especially enjoyed that the celebrations of different communities were included). My favourite part of the DVD was by far the singing in patois, as sad as it was to note the decline of patois, the efforts of Namdi to preserve it and the singing were beautifully inspiring.

This is definitely a DVD that one ought to purchase.",1391299200,2,1489,4.741312741312742
