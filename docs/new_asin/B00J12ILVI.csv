8647202,3,B00J12ILVI,"In this version of Zane Grey's novel ""The Riders Of The Purple Sage""  cowboy star George Montgomery made one his early appearances in a western playing a mysterious gunman Lassiter who rides in to save a young woman's ranch hand from being whipped by a member of a evil vigilante gang.  Lassiter hangs around and attempts to help the young woman.  Originally the vigilante group had been started with good intentions by her father, who has passed away, and is now controlled by a villainous judge who is out to get everyone's land.  This movie is just a good western, but less than a hour long.  In my opinion the best version of the book was the 1996 TV movie with Ed Harris and Amy Madigan.",1416009600,,692,4.4603174603174605
8647203,3,B00J12ILVI,"To date, there are five screen adaptations of Riders of the Purple Sage, Zane Grey's most famous novel, with the 1996 television version, in my opinion, coming off as best (and most faithful) of the bunch. There were the two silent versions - one in 1918 and then in 1925 with Tom Mix - and the 1931 version with George O'Brien. And then there's this one, which came out in 1941 and starred Robert Montgomery as Grey's most mythic hero, the infamous gunfighter dressed in black, Lassiter.

I suppose there's enough here that's faithful to the source material. Yes, it does do away with the pivotal Mormon element (religious zealots are pretty much the big bads in the book). Instead, the central conflict rears up in the shape of the crooked vigilante society. It's a law and order league founded in Arizona by the father of young ranchwoman Jane Withersteen (Mary Howard), and it's just too bad that Old Man Withersteen had passed on and that a corrupt judge (Robert Barrat) has taken over the reins. And this judge, he's in the midst of a sweeping land grab, no matter that he has to terrorize the local ranchers to acquire territory. He's got his eyes set on Jane's ranch and her water rights.

As a bully move, thugs from the vigilante society are about to take a whip to Jane's ranch hand (James Gillette) when who rides up but this stranger who performs the impressive stunt of shooting the length of the whip off a thug's fist, leaving him naught but the handle? As entrances go, that one's really neat. It's been a minute since I read the book but the impression I have is that Grey never revealed Lassiter's Christian name (but maybe I'm wrong?). In the movies, his handle is Jim Lassiter. I think giving him a first name loses him some of that mystique. But, clearly, this minor oater wasn't trying for heady stuff like that.

Given, these hour-long pictures don't give you much in terms of character development, but the plot moves along briskly and there's always some sort of activity, whether it's Lassiter's confounding a stampede or taming a wild bronco or bracing the vigilante society. Robert Montgomery is serviceable. He invests his Texas gunfighter with a sense of capable authority, never mind that he's lighter in tone and mood than the book Lassiter.

Lassiter's got his reason for coming to Arizona (in the book, Utah). He's seeking his dead sister's now grown-up daughter, and it's just Jane Withersteen's good fortune that she crosses paths with him. Jane and Lassiter lock horns because she abhors gunplay. But you can guess where that story's going. Lassiter's easy rapport with her adorable young ward, Fay (Patsy Patterson), helps to smooth matters. Another sub-plot concerns Jane's ranch hand and his interactions with a mysterious masked rider. It all culminates with a shoot-'em-up rescue attempt and a mad dash up the slopes of Surprise Valley and the Balancing Rock perched atop. In the book the Balancing Rock symbolizes Jane Withersteen's long-held beliefs, and Lassiter's moving of the rock parallels Jane's monumental shift in perspective. In the movie, things don't get so deep as the boulder just triggers an avalance and is cool to look at. In the movie, Lassiter is clearly more hero than tortured anti-hero. Yeah, it's a trifling B-western what lacks the weight and mythic resonance of the book. But it's worth scouting.",1413158400,,3365,4.836805555555555
