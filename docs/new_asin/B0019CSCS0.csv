8273426,5,B0019CSCS0,I highly recommend this video.  The footage of Kilauea erupting is truly amazing and the segment on Hawaii's rainforests wonderfully shows their spectacular beauty.  I visited Hawaii just once and have always hoped to return - this video truly reinforces that desire.,1375401600,,267,5.333333333333333
8273427,2,B0019CSCS0,"Color was very poor. The beauty of Hawaii could not really be seen. It looks as if it was filmed in the 80's. Definitely not even close to HD. Was slow and boring. Very disappointing as I like documentary type movies, but this one was not it.",1353801600,,242,4.170212765957447
8273428,5,B0019CSCS0,Awesome. We've watched the Hawaii DVD too many times to count. I enjoy the volcano and lava flows the most. My wife loves the rainforest segments. This is the 3rd DVD we've collected from Phil Giriodi & Four Points Video. We REALLY enjoy this DVD but now have the dilemma of deciding on which DVD to watch with our morning coffee. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this company's work. Amazed and Inspired.,1219276800,,389,4.6521739130434785
8273429,5,B0019CSCS0,"I've never seen Kilauea but after viewing this video I feel as though I've been there. Fountains of fire shooting straight up into the night sky, an entire village destroyed by a 20 foot high wall of lava. The lava then cascades to the sea where it creates new land. Kilauea takes no hostages. Awesome!

The second part of this video is a Hawaiian rainforest. Tropical flowers bloom in profusion as waterfalls flow to the sea. All is peaceful until a violent thunder and lightning storm sends animals scurrying to shelter. A new day dawns with a rainbow and the rainforest is peaceful once again. Both of these videos compliment each other. I highly recommend this DVD for your home library as I am certain you will want to view it over and over as I do.

8273430,5,B0019CSCS0,If you've ever wondered how Hawaii came to be the paradise it is--watch this video. The footage is spectacular. Kilauea's awesome eruptions are captured from every conceivable angle. Magnificent sculptures rise from fountains of lava that are seemingly cooled by the whim of nature's mysterious artists--easy to imagine the volcanic Hawaiian Islands being formed in this way.  Phil has nicely paired the fiery lava flows with beautiful footage of lush rainforests that grew from the fertile soil. I would recommend this to teachers who have included the study of Hawaii in their curriculum.,1214611200,,590,5.344086021505376
