1633751,5,B00005NGEB,"This boxed set would be a great addition to any DVD or VHS collection of any scientists.  Of course, if you are interested in learning the evolutionists' point of view, this will also be a great addition.  We must remember, however, that evolution is a theory and will never be proven as fact.  That being said, the creationists' view is that there is a God.  OK.  Here's where it gets difficult for some. Evolution is a theory, but creationism is also.  I do believe in God; however, no one was there at the time.  We HAVE to believe he did all this.
  Science, on the hand, is basically problem-solving in a methodical way, using evidence.  Some of you are saying I'm wrong, and I might be.  Nonetheless, science has to rely on ""evidence.""  This evidence leads us to certain conclusions.
I used to mix the two (creationism and evolution), believing that God may have created man, but how He did it is the question.
I know kmany people will disagree, but creationism gives credit to someone who did things that no one was around to see.  Science, on the other hand, must look at evidence and derives conclusions from them.  One must remember, however, that theories can always be wrong.  Look at Lamarckism or Heackel's ideas.  Science is only about our conclusions on a problem.
Science cannot, and will not, say there is a God.  If they did, we might as well throw everything out of the door. including medicine. If evolution was somehow proven true, wouldn't it be a law as the ""Law of Thermodynamics?""",1011484800,4,1506,4.601503759398496
1633752,5,B00005NGEB,"This series blew me away. I have always been interested in Evolution. Also Anthropology and Biology in general. I think it may be one of the most signifigant subjects ever studied. After all, Learning the past can build a bridge to the future. (wow, thats my original little phrase, ...:)
Anyway, this series takes a colorful, open minded, chuckle-at-ourselves view of evolution. Which quite frankly I believe is needed, badly. The battle between creationists and evolutionists is a waste of time. My personal opininion leans far toward the evolotionary theory. And before all the creationists shout their famous mantra ""Yes, that is right, the THEORY OF EVOLUTION, it has never been proven that we evolved from apes...""Might I remind you that your argument is just as hol(e)y (no pun intended, snort, snort). We have bones and DNA and you have a big old book written far too long ago by believers (not objective witnesses). What I am trying to say is nobody gets to be right! We will never get an answer. As much as we want to believe we will, it's not gonna happen. Be content not knowing! None of us has the right to block someone else's view point. When you do that you only prove yourself ignorant. Intelligent (not smart) people are open to listening to the world around them and appreciating the differences there are. Life would be so boring if we all thought the same. It would be just like that movie ""The Time Machine"" we would be like the Eloine (sp). Walking around going DUHHH...and then get swallowed by a Morlok. If God intended us to follow one ideal he would not have given us individual, independent minds. Uh oh, I said the G word. That means I better go. I will leave you with two significantly insignificant thoughts:
#1 What if there is a god and he DID create the universe. Maybe he also put into motion that first spark of life that ultimately began to evolve in different directions. And maybe from that came all of the life that exists on this or any other planet. I believe that would make us all pretty much right. Or We ALL could be completely wrong! Who knows, just don't loose too much sleep (or friends)over it.
#2 Buy this series, if you don't believe in evolution it is still good entertainment. You could also use it to show your kids what crazy people evolutionists are.  Or, maybe you should pray to god for guidance. No, I didn't mean that. My best friend in the world is Mormon (You know from those funny commercials). If I can love her I can love you.
Love ya, kiss, kiss...my lips are sealed!",1010448000,6,2534,4.569230769230769
1633753,2,B00005NGEB,"Darwin's Theory of Evolution has recently been seriously challenged by new scientific evidence, particularly in the field of biochemestry. In the past several years, better understanding of how cells work has uncovered what appear to be insuperable challenges to the idea that natural selection could be responsible for the diversity of life on our planet. That's just one of many new challenges.
This series appears to be a vehicle by the ""old guard"" scientists to steamroll over any challenge to the theory. The timing of this series -- at a time when credible, scientific questions have been raised over parts of the theory, and some states have considered allowing these new challenges to be introduced to students in the classroom  -- supports the idea that this series is mainly designed to squelch criticism rather than offer enlightenment. Unfortunately it means that the series deals with ideas of the past rather than the legitimate controversies of today.
New science has often had to deal with resistance from the established scientific community, and it should. If it is true science, it will eventually prevail. Clearly the new questions being raised about evolution are legitimate, scientific questions for which answers should be sought. It may be that the answers will come through a greater understanding of evolutionary processes. Or it may be that parts of the theory of evolution will have to be discarded or seriously altered. The answers certainly will not come by ignoring the questions.
But this series does just that, ignoring the questions and the new scientific challenges from several different fields. It concentrates on the official party line as propounded by the old guard. As such, it becomes basically a political weapon in the controversy rather than a real exploration of the current status of our understanding of evolution.
For my kids in school, I would hope they would have a teacher wise enough to make it clear that our understanding in science is continually growing and developing, that what we discover is often surprising even to the most learned scientists, and that the dogma of today is sometimes the rejected theory of the future. I would hope that they would be given current ideas on science and encouraged to explore them, not just accept on faith the views of the establishment. After all, that's often how science makes new advances. What if Darwin had simply accepted the prevailing scientific theory of his day?",1010275200,12,2469,5.0962962962962965
1633754,4,B00005NGEB,"I watched this entire 7-part series when broadcast on PBS, prior to placing an advance order for the product. I knew what I was getting before hand ... or so I thought.
I don't know who is responsible for the packaging of this product. These seven VHS tapes DO NOT have volume numbers, but the series does have a particular order that the tapes should be viewed. The trailer on each tape refers to the subject matter of the next tape to be viewed, but not to the NAME of that tape!
Worse yet, the ""boxed set"" is not what you expect. All seven of these tapes come inside a disposable, thin, flimsy cardboard box ... one that (over time) will be unsuitable for storage. I threw it away upon receipt (and manually numbered the tapes!).
If you want to watch these tapes in the proper order, they SHOULD HAVE BEEN assigned numbers as follows:
Tape #1: Darwin's Dangerous Idea
Tape #2: Great Transformations
Tape #3: Extinction!
Tape #4: The Evolutionary Arms Race
Tape #5: Why Sex?
Tape #6: The Mind's Big Bang
Tape #7: What About God?
I will not waste much space here debating the philosophical or religious issues associated with this series, as those issues are basically emotional concerns (of the individual). The whole problem with the ""theory of evolution"" ... is that ... if you want to believe in some kind of afterlife, then somewhere in time ""God"" had to install a soul into one or more bodies.
This means that at some point in time, the child had a soul but the parent did not. At that same point in time, the parent would cease to exist upon death (just like every other living thing on this planet) but the child would continue onward ""in spirit"" after death (minus the body, of course).
Nobody wants to believe:
(1) that they didn't exist before conception; and
(2) that they will cease to exist after death.
Personally, I'm not too crazy about the idea myself. However, I must respect the universal nature of death - and I don't believe that what I choose to believe is going to change the ultimate outcome in any way. However, it is our beliefs that give meaning to our lives.
With that said, I would recommend that you just choose to believe whatever serves to make your life meaningful to you - and don't waste time debating the issue with anyone else. The Universe doesn't really give a damn what anyone chooses to believe. No matter what you choose to believe (whether it be based in science or religion) you will be proven significantly in error 100 years from now. For example, what do YOU think about some of the beliefs, practices and customs that people held 100 years ago?
I rest my case ;-)
Just try to do the best with what you know. You can believe anything you want, for whatever reasons suit you. As someone once said: ""I've given up my search for Truth ... and am presently looking for a really good Fantasy!""
WITH RESPECT TO THE GENERAL THEORY OF EVOLUTION, THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST PRESENTATION THAT I HAVE SEEN.
In the section ""The Mind's Big Bang"" ... I wished they would have devoted a bit of time to explaining the general process by which each organism with a nervous system creates its own ""virtual reality"" universe -- an internal model of the external world (its niche in the ecosystem). These models are built from a combination of both the genetic inheritance AND the sensory inputs of the organism, and thus are limited by BOTH the nature of those senses and the genetic heritage.
That ""internal virtual reality universe"" ONLY has to account for the external factors that impact daily living and survival. For example, a fish has no need to understand anything about mountains. A bird doesn't need to know anything about the ocean bottom.  Neither needs to know anything about the moons of Jupiter, etc.  When an organism dies, its ""internal universe"" (the only one it knows) ceases to exist.
Each organism's small internal ""virtual reality"" model of its world (its known universe) is but an insignificantly small subset of the much larger external environment (the biosphere containing its ecosystem). Other things being equal, a more complete or accurate internal model will provide a selective advantage for survival over less complete models. This, in part, is what drives the development of brains and nervous systems and sensory organs.
As you go ""up"" the evolutionary chain, those models become more complex and comprehensive. The social and cultural forces driving the complexities and depth of the ""virtual reality"" models created by the human brain are barely explored.
As the scientific method continues to reveal that which was previously unknown or misunderstood, our model of the ""real"" universe (whatever THAT is) becomes progressively more accurate. Any group who tries to hold on to a ""static internal model"" will have problems ""evolving"" their belief system to account for new discoveries, and for deeper understandings of what may be already known.
The one-hour ""What About God"" tape merely explores how a certain group (in this case, Conservative Christians) tries to maintain their particular flavor of ""virtual reality"" in the face of constantly expanding knowledge that appears to conflict with their relatively static internal models. With respect to the ever-expanding base of knowledge, it is like a teenager trying to fit into the shoes or clothes that were worn at age five. I understand that a large part of the Western World audience for which this program is targeted is of Christian background ... however ...
... I would have preferred that the ""What About God"" hour long episode have been focused upon more important objectives OTHER THAN trying to change the thinking of those who hold to a belief system that makes little sense in today's ""real world"" science, technology and medicine. Why did we not spend an hour trying to ""convert"" the thinking of Muslims, Hindus, Jews, etc. ??
Also not significantly discussed in this series is the role that various pre-human tribes and bands had in wiping each other out (i.e., the strongest, smartest and best organized survive). This was a key element in the human evolution process. There is a lot to be said for killing off your dumb neighbors and taking over their resources! Recorded history is filled with examples! While this may not sit square with current norms and expectations, it was one of the driving forces that got us to where we are today. It is but one of the ways that natural selection improves the gene pool.
In all cultures and societies (far back into pre-history) the human internal models of the universe (as we imagine it to be) are the most complex and varied in this biosphere. But it may only be the first step.
Genetic engineering (a topic largely untouched by this series) will provide the next steps, and will do so in timeframes measured in years -- not millenniums. This series could have used another one-hour tape just to explore the ""future"" of human self-evolution. Maybe that wasn't in the budget! Someone obviously considered it more important to address the concerns of the bible toting Conservative Christian audience ;-)
In closing, had the marketing department numbered the tapes ... and given you a sturdy cardboard box to hold them ... I would have awarded them 5 stars.",1006732800,10,7233,4.790232185748599
1633755,5,B00005NGEB,"In the vast nothing that is modern television--where angels and ESP are considered quite normal--it is a breath of fresh air that we also have had this series explaining the science that is ""evolutionary theory,"" and ignoring the popular use of the word 'theory' as this use has no place in the scientific world.
Little mention is given to the fact that a few established scientists do not accept Darwinism because of their relgious upbringings. Though many evolutioniary biologists argue about some of the specfics, all who understand Darwinism, accept Darwinism. Creationism (or ""intelligent design"") is given no more than a cursory wave of the hand as is all it really deserves.
Creationism has very dubious ""scientific proofs,"" and it is about time that the kind of cultural relavitism we have seen in America is shown as anti-scientific bias. In fact, in the final episode of Evolution, ""What about God"", the writers take a fairly conservative approach.  They talk to many Christains about their anti-evolution beleifs, never trying to insult them even though they are quite mistaken.  Even when Evolution talks to the scientists, they talk to those soft-Darwinists like Ken Miller and Eugene Scott who think that science (evolution) and religion are compatable.  They certainly are not, as every single piece of evidence for Evolution shows the Bible to be false.
It would have been more honest for the directers of this otherwise wonderful series to have included interviews in the last episode with some real Darwinists like Richard Dawkins or Massimo Pigluicci. Nevertheless, this series brilliantly explains the most well-klnown, accepted, science Mankind has ever known; one with more evidence for it than even the origin of the Universe itself! This is JUST what I want my children learning in school!",1003622400,31,1813,5.180887372013652
1633756,1,B00005NGEB,"A very well funded, but secularly slanted series. This series pushes evolutionary theory as a scientific fact that should just be accepted. No mention is given to the fact that many established scientists do not believe in evolution, and out of those that do, many are in disagreement over just about everything from the fossil record to the age of the earth. Evolution is passed as a proven fact instead of hypothesis. Creationism is given no more than a cursory wave of the hand. Ken Ham, a respected creationist, is portrayed as no more than a religious zealot, with no mention that many bona fide scientists from all fields are part of the same organization (answers in genesis-check out their website for rebuttals). Creationism has many scientific proofs, but is portrayed in the last part of the series as a strictly religious belief.
 Even aside from this, the tough questions about evolution are not addressed, such as: 1.) the origin of the universe and the first existing matter, 2)how did single cell organisms become multicelled organisms, 3)how did the first invertebrates evolve to vertebrates (there are no transitional forms), and 4)if evolution is part of the natural processes of the universe, where is everyone else?, to name a few.
 In short, this series does not aim to really answer any questions, it intends only to push a questionable theory as fact, and stamp out The God of the Bible with the god of Darwin and secular humanists. A true educational series would be thorough and unbiased. This is not what i want my children learning in school!",1002672000,11,1570,4.876404494382022
1633757,4,B00005NGEB,"This series has very well chosen scientists who say very interesting things.  Several of my favorite authors including Peter D. Ward, Simon Conway Morris, and Stephen Jay Gould provide explanations for their ideas on the subject.  Compared to similar efforts, the animations of Burgess Shale organisms are a bit stiff and unrealistic.  And it's maddening that all of the DNA helices seen in animations are left-handed, i.e. the mirror image of what DNA really looks like.

1633808,3,B00005NGEB,"This documentary has good production values, mostly addresses interesting issues, sometimes in a pertinent and informative way, but also sometimes in a simplistic and superficial way.

Episode 1 is far on the (low budget) movie side, and highly anecdotal.

Ep2 mostly good. A good first part about evolution, then a very good reminder about what is DNA, which hints at going where and why life began... and then it jumps billions of years ahead, to humans, which doesn't make any real sense in this context.

Other episodes have the same kind of highs and lows, and too often jump from one subject area to another with no real sense of purpose or direction.

Finally, the last episode is about empathizing with people who want to put religion in science classes. Really?

In conclusion, some episodes have their moments, most of us will get some knowledge and entertainment out of it, but it's not extraordinary either.

For a documentary that will challenges and feed your thoughts on evolution a little more, try ""The Shape of Life.""",1236038400,4,1035,4.885714285714286
1633809,5,B00005NGEB,"This is an excellent overview of evolution. What sets it apart are the diverse topics addressed. The dramatic reenactments of Charles Darwin in the Galapagos Islands and at home were very well done.

There is plenty here so one can return to it repeatedly without tiring of it.

Some may disagree but I thought the episode about religion vs. evolution was handled perfectly. While it's thorough and clear about which side has all the evidence, I don't think the documentary goes so far that it would offend or turn off most religious viewers who are negative towards evolution. While they might not go away convinced, I can't imagine them becoming so upset they would turn away in horror or anything like that. Those who have a problem with evolution should make the effort to watch this, if only to think a little more deeply about the subject.

I highly recommend this work.

1633810,4,B00005NGEB,"This documentary series is excellent, if a little inconsistent. The narration is great, the scholarship is generally high, and the cinematography is nice.
Each volume teaches the very basics of a piece of evolutionary thought and its meaning in the modern world. Includes some speculation, especially when discussing the evolution of the human mind and the question of God. However, most of the speculation is labelled as such.

Overall, I would say that anyone who wondered what evolutionary theory was all about and why it was so important to real life issues would not be dissapointed. Those who have a greater knowledge of this material may find it a bit pedestrian.

Especially great is the volume that discusses sexual selection. This vital piece of evolutionary theory is often forgotten or ignored by those who relish in the idea of 'nature red in tooth and claw.' Sexual selection is vital for understanding human behavior, even if some protagonists- Geoffrey Miller- take it a bit far.

The program bent over backwards to accomdate and massage the fears of bible thumpers. At no time did they interview popular atheists for the subject. Which is odd because Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett and Steven Pinker were in the documentary at other places!!! It was clear that the last hour was less about the facts of evolution and more about catering to dogmatic theists with no desire to learn about the process of speciation.

1633813,5,B00005NGEB,"PBS Evolution is a 7 episode series. It is a powerful explanation for evolution using 8 hours worth of running proofs, confirmations, substantiations, verifications, facts, demonstrations and debates that authenticate the fact of evolution. It is overwhelming and undeniable. There is more evidence for evolution than there is for the theory of gravity.

PBS Evolution will make you abruptly realize how strong the inference for evolution actually is. The series will inform you about things you may have never thought possible. It raises understanding. It is the kind of learning media that every person needs. You will want to own PBS Evolution for the rest of your life. You will leave it in your legacy. If you can learn what PBS Evolution teaches and retain the information (by repeat viewings) you will find yourself a lot smarter than the average person and probably want to amplify your intelligence in the things that actually count as opposed to things that have little bearing at all.

The immense educational value of PBS Evolution does come with a price to pay and this cost is not the sticker on the box, but in the amount of demystification that a human being experiences while watching it although the last episode does try to bridge some elements with supernatural belief in a creator with reference to evolutionary biologists who believe in a creator.

However there is no denying that very quickly, and rightly, someone finds their whole outlook on life converted effortlessly from supernatural claims to natural provable ones made clear by the mechanisms of life, all with evidence to back it up. While demystification will certainly give some viewers a few sleepless nights, PBS Evolution is also the best replacement therapy for that. Not only will that person feel okay about being demystified but will eventually see themselves, the world they live in and all the animals that inhabit it in a brand new and factual way... with loads of proof to support it. PBS Evolution presents the corroborating material and launches us into critical thinking on a fully blown comprehensive magnitude.

Episode 1: ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea""
This episode is two hours long. It deals mainly with Charles Darwin (a naturalist) who is the father of modern Evolution. Darwin's story is presented here in the format of a historical drama of his life and times. The drama is intertwined with interviews of modern day biologists following in the steps of Darwin and researchers in the field gathering the evidence. DNA is given a lot of coverage. Evolving viruses are explored. The evolution of the eye is explained. DNA comparison between humans, other hominids and other animals are made. Animal language gets coverage.

Episode 2: ""Great Transformations""
The evolution of whales is the focus of this episode. It then deals with how the first creatures emerged from the water onto land. Geology along with the fossil record is given special attention, especially the transitional fossil record. The Precambrian explosion. Mutations, genealogy and DNA manipulation. Upright walking and modern bipeds.

Episode 3: ""Extinction""
The extinction of species including mass extinctions. Early paleontologists. Roy Chapman Andrews. The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction or K-T Event. Overpopulation topics. Ecology. Sink hole evidence. Biological invaders and weed species.

Episode 4: ""The Evolutionary Arms Race""
Viruses. Toxic animals. Resistance. Predator prey evolution. Plagues and infectious diseases. Tuberculosis. Drug resistance and evolving microbes. Cholera. Edward O' Wilson. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Symbiosis and partnership evolutionary dependency (grouper fish allowing shrimp to eat parasites on it, flowers through nectar use birds and bees to breed, grazing animals work with microbes for digestion, as do we humans with beneficial bacteria). Leaf cutter ants and fungi partnerships. Natural prehistoric antibiotics. The ecosystem.

Episode 5: ""Why sex?""
Sex may be more important than life itself. Female praying mantis can kill the male for food. Pacific salmon go up river to spawn and wait to die after. Humans don't die for sex but they may die to protect life. Sexual reproduction and asexual cloning. The red queen theory. Sex is beneficial for variation. Male sexual attractiveness and female choice (the dating game). Monogamy and polygamy. Some species cheat for better diversity. Role reversal in reproductive strategy. Bonobo sexual reproduction. Homo sapiens. Evolutionary psychology. Mate choice. Standards of beauty. Social exchange. Perceptions in the brain. Inherent traits such as fear of spiders or snakes, disgust at rotting substances, appreciation of a beautiful body. Genetic fertility traits and why certain people attract us. Selecting for intelligence influencing brain development. Personality, creativity, wit and charm. Cultural display for sexual attraction. Humans caring for others that are not their own.

Episode 6: ""The Mind's Big Bang""
32,000 BC cave rock art. Hand axes. Down from the trees. Upright walking. Evolution of the human body. Brain expansion. Leaving Africa. Hunter gatherers. Fossil records. Migration of early hominoids from Africa. Early identity. Neanderthals. Weapon evolution. Spit techniques for cave paintings. Musical stalagmites and stalactites. Complex social relationships. Language. Sign language. Syntax. Memes (pronounced meems). Diabetics. Human manipulation of biological evolution.

Episode 7: ""What about God?""
Evolution versus creationism debate. Scopes trial. Creationists teaching anti-evolution. Christians debating evolution within the family. Scandal at the University of Wheaton. The Genesis Flood by J C Whitcomb. Science curriculums.

This is the perfect companion to documentaries like Carl Sagan's `Cosmos' and Jacob Bronowski's 'The Ascent of Man', making it a very important documentary which is also an essential life changing experience.

PBS evolution contains a huge amount of graphics and animation to help convey the message. PBS evolution is also multimedia interactive. Every so often a popup will appear on the screen so that you can consult PBS evolution online which is a widespread database of evolution topics that enhance the learning experience. You can spend more time on PBS evolution online than with the documentary series itself. Some of the popup caption topics are changed on the internet version so word searching the topic doesn't always work and instead you just need to follow the topics from the main PBS evolution episode menu. However all the information (and there is heaps of it) is there. PBS evolution also has an affiliate book called Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea by Carl Zimmer for those who are interested in a book of the series. PBS evolution has a lot to offer to solidify the fact of evolution. It enforces critical thinking and further enhances the meaning of life.",1189641600,6,6915,5.458372310570627

""If I were to give a prize for the single best idea anybody had, I'd give it to [Charles] Darwin [1809 to 1882] for the idea of natural selection, ahead of Newton, ahead of Einstein, because his idea unites the two most [different] features of our universe: the world of purposeless, meaningless matter and motion on one side and the world of meaning and purpose and design on the other.""

The above quotation is found at the start of the first and most important program (entitled ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"") of this seven-part series about evolution.  This first program (about two hours) is on one disc (call this disc 1) alone while the three other discs contain two programs each.  Each of the remaining six programs or parts is about one hour long.  The narrator for each program is actor Liam Neeson.

The first program is most important in my view because it lays down the basics of Darwin's theory, explaining important but misunderstood concepts such as common ancestry, the tree of life, natural selection, mutation, and complexity.

To give you a ""feel"" for the remaining six programs, I will give a part of the actual ""prologue"" or introduction of each program as uttered by the narrator--

Program #2 (on disc 2, 6 scenes) entitled ""Great Transformations:""

""In the history of our planet, a few great transformations [that is, big evolutionary steps] have opened the door for new forms of life and new types of life.  Fifty million years ago land mammals evolved into sea creatures.  Long before that, fish colonized land.  At the dawn of civilization, the first [four-limbed] bodies appeared.""

Program #3 (disc 2, 8 scenes), ""Extinction!:""

""In the ongoing drama of evolution, species comes and go...the extinction of species that can't adapt or compete creates opportunities for new species...So evolution and extinction are in balance, but what happens when a planet-wide catastrophe kills off many species in a great mass extinction?""

Program #4 (disc 3, 8 scenes), ""The Evolutionary Arms Race:""

""The arms race between humans and microbes cannot be won by drugs alone.  But if we learn to harness evolution, we may reach a truce with our mortal enemies.""

Program #5 (disc 3, 7 scenes), ""Why Sex?:""

""From an evolutionary perspective, sex is more important than life itself...Evolution is a story, written over countless generations.  To inherit, and pass on genes is to be part of the story...sex and genes...driving behavior, driving evolution.""

Program #6 (disc #4, 8 scenes, my favorite episode), ""The Mind's Big Bang:""

""With art came human technology, human communication, human culture.  The question is, `What happened to make all this possible?'  How could it be that a species opened its mind and burst into a new realm?  How is it that [our] human ancestors evolved a whole new way of seeing themselves and in time transformed the planet?""

Program #7 (disc #4, 6 scenes, the most controversial part), ""What About God?:""

""The majesty of our Earth, the beauty of life--are they the result of a natural process called `evolution' or the work of a divine creator?...For all of us, the future of religion, science, and science education are at stake in the creation-evolution debate.  Today, even as science continues to provide evidence supporting the theory of evolution, for millions of Americans, the most important question remains--'What about God?'""

Brief comments are made throughout by such people as university professors, biologists, researchers, biographers, geologists, public health officials, teachers, and confused students.

There is also exquisite animation used to clarify important concepts.

You can view the programs in any order.  However, I strongly recommend viewing the first program first before viewing any others.  As well, before viewing program seven (the last program), I strongly recommend viewing all the previous six programs first.

For those who do not want to shell out the money for the entire boxed set, these discs are sold separately.  If you're goal is to see all seven programs and to buy each disc separately, you will end up spending a bit more money than if you bought the entire boxed set.

Finally, the DVDs themselves (the ones released as a boxed set in 2001) are perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are no extras but there is access to a website that allows for many activities.

In conclusion, if you want answers to such questions as...

(1) Who was this man named Charles Darwin and why is his theory so controversial?
(2) What triggered Earth's incredible diversity?
(3) Why isn't the human species dead yet?
(4) AIDS, asthma, flu, common cold--if we're so smart, why can't we beat these?
(5) Why does size matter?  Why are we dying for it?
(6) Why create?  Why speak?  Why us?
(7) Why do we believe in God?...

then this boxed set is a must-see!!

1633816,5,B00005NGEB,I used this set to help me study for a university evolution test.  It helped me to understand the material and gave me something to study when the book + my flashcards were just too much.,1177804800,,187,4.194444444444445
1633817,5,B00005NGEB,"From Darwing to God. This piece is an excellent work to track evolution. It starts with the Darwing's revolutionary ideas of evolution. Presents the cycles of extintions and emergences of species, having humans the roll of the last potential species to trigger the next mass extinction in the history of life on earth. The transformation of species as a result of its interation with their environment, is as well shown, having us, humans, involved in a battle between organisms. This is discussied under the threat of microorganisms to our own existence, bringing to the viewer instances from the real life. Finally, the documentary shows the battle between creationism and evolution. The struggle humans have with these new ideas of evolution and the existence of God. In order to overcome this paradoxe, a new idea of an intelligent life is proposed. This new concept states the existence of an entity embedded in the universe, as the creator and responsible of this magnificent universe.

I watched this documentary all at once, and is a caudal of information that will bring to you a new perspective of life. Enjoy it!",1142726400,3,1123,5.005347593582887
1633828,4,B00005NGEB,"I rented this series via Netflix and can only say Bravo! to the people who produced it.  They made fascinating television out of what can be a dry, esoteric subject (which is probably the real reason so many people are succeptible to the creationists' psuedo-scientific drivel).  Since evolution is, in fact, the foundation and cornerstone of the modern life sciences, a grounding in the subject is essential and this series accomplishes that goal quite well.

The first part, if you've read Desmond Brown excellent biography of Charles Darwin, is spot on.  The acting was even quite good, something you don't always expect from this kind of show.  You could have expanded those parts of the show into a respectable episode of ""Masterpiece Theater.""

The only part that didn't really impress me that much is the last, ""What About God?""  I'm not saying it was poorly done, only that it went over territory that was already quite familiar to me.  If you are unfamiliar with the ongoing tug-of-war between scientific educators and religious conservatives in the United States, then this last segment will probably be more interesting to you.",1118275200,27,1138,5.01595744680851

1633830,5,B00005NGEB,"Those who use evolution as proof there is no creator are, in my opinion, narrow minded. Evolution only disagrees with written texts of creationism. One needs to look well beyond.

If I were God I would want my people to be able to neither prove or disprove my existence...yet I would leave some doubts or unanswerable questions for man to ponder...like science that breaks down at the moment of the Big Bang.

Those that study the human body have barely glimpsed the complexities of this evolved life form and I find I have a gnawing feeling about how adaptive evolution alone got us all the way here. A bit of doubt leaves that door to God open, albeit not a god exactly like one's holy book might have posited.

Many great scientists are believers of sorts so I find atheists to be arrogant, and agnostics perhaps closer to the truth. Who knows...if string theory is in fact reality, perhaps God resides only a dimension away.",1103414400,13,928,4.612121212121212
1633831,5,B00005NGEB,"Evolution is a fact.  Creationism is an invention of man, period!  This series either receives great or poor reviews, obviously a reflection of those who believe in a creator (i.e. poor reviews) or those who are 'open minded' and accept the obvious that life evolved on this planet (not to mention probably thousands of other planets in this universe - god must be a busy fellow).  The existence of an afterlife is unknown (even though the 'theists' want to harp in heaven), so get a life while you're alive - do something good for the planet.",1098835200,32,543,4.635416666666667
1633832,5,B00005NGEB,"Despite being a Christian, I have always been inclined to the logical and scientific. And having read many books on the subject, I have always appreciated the elegance of the Darwin's thesis.

The PBS Evolution series provides many tidbits for the arsenal of the closet-evolutionist such as myself, and anyone interested in the subject, with or without an agenda. Obviously, the science is as deep as any layman can care to venture, and the series is by no means complete. But it does an excellent job of covering its breadth.

With carefully selected examples, you would have gained a good understanding of the forces that drive evolution by the end of the show.

Darwin's idea was a simple one. Yet it is one that strikes at the heart of all creation models, much like Galileo's assertions went against the dogma of his time. I see time and inertia on Darwin's side. They were with Galileo.

There is harmony in Creation and Science. Instead of denying it, find it. This series is a good place to start.",1092528000,21,1005,4.693181818181818
1633833,4,B00005NGEB,"I watched 7 out of 8 episodes in two days.  It may be educational for people who didn't know much about it, but if you are somewhat familiar with the topics, this documentary film didn't offer much more.",1084320000,13,203,4.342105263157895
1633834,3,B00005NGEB,"If you have this collection, could you please explain some things to me.  I have not brought this collection, though I have been longing to have an evolution DVD collection packed full of information and honesty.  However,  I am not going to buy this until I know I will get what I am looking for.  At the high price of $80 dollars, I definitely want to get my money's worth.  In some of the reviews, on the section about Creationism vs. Evolution, some viewers wrote that the DVD states that many Christians believe in Evolution.  Now if the movie had thoroughly explained what exactly evolution is, from the beginning microbes to the dawning of man, what sense is it to then state later without criticism that many Christians believe in Evolution.  Since when did the bible say, ""And God created microorganisms"".  I am fed up with books and series that shy away from the facts simply because they challenge old time beliefs and may offend some viewers.  I want the facts and I don't want things sugar coated or diminished to being questionable just to satisfy the religious or ignorant.  As it should be in schools, only the truth should be taught, and anything else should be labeled as cultural studies, not science.",1080432000,19,1220,4.685446009389671
1633835,3,B00005NGEB,"It is hard to believe that these installments are all in the same series.  Brilliant segments seem to intertwine with filler. The first, two hour installment (25% - a dramatization of Darwin's life) would have been a complete waste of time if it hadn't been salvaged by ~ 30 min worth of spots on a couple of brilliant professors and the extinction episode (which I was looking most forward to) was moralistic and not very helpful after the first few minutes.  However, some episodes soar.  The 'What about sex?' episode, with its steamy jazz and smirking talking heads was thoroughly entertaining and informative (one of the best hours of documentary I've seen) and the Great Transitions episode had high quality segments on two of our era's great contributors (Philip Gingrich- Basilosaurus and Simon Conway Morris - Burgess Shale) that were thoroughly engaging.  In all, I expected a more consistent effort from PBS (especially at this steep price) but in the end had learned more than I would have in 8 hrs of reading.  Final analysis: it was worth the time but not $80.  (It might have been 4*'s if I had gotten it at the library or paid $30).
A couple particular critiques if the reader has interest:  The depiction of Darwin as deep and conflicted while Owen was unreflective, mean and conspiratorial was irresponsible reductionism with a polemical intent.  The series' continual tendency to be moralistic and draw ethical conclusions from materialist premises got old and seemed a little dangerous at times ('evolutionary psychology' sounded an awful lot like 'social Darwinism').  The 'What about God?' episode was adequate, but the selection of a marginal (though admittedly popular) voice like Hamm rather than a Philip Johnston, Michael Behe or William Dembski showed that they were more interested in creationism as a social phenomena than design as a philosophical premise.  This was their prerogative and made for an interesting segment, but it came off like Hamm was the ridiculous champion of the whole movement, which was just not a fair rendering.",1069632000,27,2066,5.05
1633836,5,B00005NGEB,"Everybody knows that when it comes down to the final question in a game of Trivial Pursuit that they should make me try and answer a science question because I know pretty much nothing about science and nature.  This is because the one thing I knew about high school biology was that you dissected animals and being sick in front of the smartest girls in school did not appeal to me at all.  So I took Life Through the Microscope (it involved drawing) and Ecology (it was the only class that fit my schedule) and missed out on Biology, Chemistry and Physics.  However, since I did my dissertation on the infamous Scopes ""Monkey"" Trial I do have something of an interest in the controversy over evolution if not the concept itself.  This seven-part series exploring various facets of evolution was perfect so someone like me who insists on having theory of any sort mixed with a heavy dose of practice.
""Evolution"" is as much about the profound impact the evolutionary process has had on our understanding of the world around us as it is on the various versions of the theory that have been expounded in scientific textbooks for the past century.  The series basically focuses on five key concepts regarding evolution, sandwiched between episodes that constitute a dramatic introduction and a controversial coda:
""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"" offers dramatizations of key moments in Darwin's life along with contemporary talking heads explaining the profound implications of the evolutionary theory and the place it holds in the scientific community today as a pivotal concept.  It takes a while to adjust to the episodic approach of the dramatizations, which come and go without a real sense of regularity, but since they dramatized the famous retort of Huxley to Bishop Wilberforce and other key moments in the popularization of evolution there is a certain effectiveness to it all.  What you get from this episode is a better idea of what the initial complaints were to evolutionary theory and who was making them.
""Great Transformations"" explores the evolutionary changes that caused the incredible diversity of animal life that exists on earth.  The focus is on the development of the four-limbed body plan, which is explained in the context of how animal life moved from water to land and eventually to human beings, thereby answering the key question of why are human connected to all life.
""Extinction!"" represents the flip side of evolutionary transformations, explaining the how and why behind the fact that 99.9 percent of all species that have ever lived on earth are now extinct.  This leads to the provocative question as to whether human beings are going to cause the next mass extinction on the planet.
""The Evolutionary Arms Race"" puts the entire concept of natural selection and survival of the fittest in the context of humanity's battles with microorganisms, looking at a case study regarding the reemergence of tuberculosis in Russian prisons.  With the alarming spread of resistance among pathogens that cause disease, the episode explains how this particular ""race"" offers the major threat to human existence.  The scary question here is whether we are fighting a battle we cannot win.
""Why Sex?"" makes the contention that in evolutionary terms sex is more important than life itself.  But on a more pragmatic level is addresses the question of whether males are necessary to perpetuate the species, looking at a wide variety of case studies drawn from nature.  This episode also explains the principle of monogamy in evolutionary terms.
""The Mind's Big Bang"" addresses the question of why humans are the dominant species on earth.  The answer is found in the past, when something happened to primitive humans to trigger a creative, technological, and social explosion, which ultimately allowed humans to dominate the planet.  The episode tries to uncover (literally) the primitive forces that contributed to the emergence of the mind of the modern human being.
""What About God?"" is the coda to the series in that it returns to the initial question of Darwin's day regarding the conflict between evolution and religion.  The debate is presented within the context of a college student whose family is not happy with what he is learning about evolution at Wesleyan College, a group of high school students trying to get their local school board to allow the teaching of creationism, and the activities by adults on both sides of the question to win this pivotal battle.  I consider the episode to be remarkably even-handed, but then I do not think there is an inherent conflict between the two, which invalidates my opinion for true believers on both sides.
Overall I like the fact that ""Evolution"" goes for depth rather than breadth.  The case studies, at least to my uneducated mind, come across as being representative of the issue under discussion.  The DVD series also features access to the Evolution Web site with its interactive games, activities, and biographies, so those who would like to get additional information and insight on any one of these topics can easily do so.  There are also student lessons for teachers who want to work these episodes into their science classes and a printable teacher's guide (remember, ""Evolution"" was produced by WGBH Boston, which means we are talking--surprise--public television).",1056931200,148,5346,5.060295790671217
1633837,5,B00005NGEB,"Wow!!! This series is as amazing as any laypersons textbook I've ever read on evolution. Each episode is not only a discourse (in the most envigorating way possible) about a different aspect of evolution, and not only does each explain the theories within that aspect but each does a great job of making them relevant to life today. What does 'cultural evolution' of transportation have to do with the cycle of extinctions. How can is the success of the AIDS virus to be attributed to what can only be called a flaw in its copying apparatus? How can we use that knowledge to our advantage in the struggle against its effects?
  Honestly, there are only slight criticisms I have about each. The first - and how relatively trivial it is - is that for every episode, I was able to think of 4 more episodes that I would have liked to see, or at least 4 more topics that each could've covered. Evolutionary psychology was, to a large degree, left unexplored but for a 10 minute passage. The punctuated equilibrium vs. Dawkinian incremental evolution debate - for as specialized as it seems it is still a HUGE debate within biology - was ignored and most of all, sociobiology was not touched on. So many facets so little DVD space! Still, I couldn't take away a star just for these trifles.
  Here's a brief overview of each episode and its highlights.
Darwins Dangerous Idea - Probably the dullest episode of all. Alternates between Darwins relevance today and BBC style reenactment of his life
Great Transformations - The origin (or suspected origin) of life and from it, the quadropods - that is, four leggeed spined creatures. Interesting discussion of our similarities to other quadropods in past and present.
Extinctions - If 99% of animals are extinct, will we be and why are we not yet? Good discussion of interconnectedness of eco-system - one thing propping up others.
Evolutionary Arms RAce - Fascinating episode about the head-to-head competition for survival. Why are adaptations handy and what really is human beings helpul adaptation? Is it language, tool making, conceptual thinking...what?
Why Sex? - Why males are on the surface superfluous (gulp) but really a good thing evolutionarily (see, I always tell women we're good for something). Different male/female connections in different species and how species attract opposite sex. Good but short lead into evolutionary biology, especially ideas of Geoffrey Miller.
The Minds Big Bang - Another great episode dealing with how, why and when the mind may have developed. Why did such a strange mutation prove successful? Was it all at once or in small improvements? The episode is a bit one-sided as it speculates that by in large, language was the brains function rather than conceptual thought.
What about God? - One of the best episodes and the most philosophical in nature. Why do creationists dislike evolution and why do evolutionists go out of their way to block creationism from schools. Meet high school and college (Christian college) students who are striving to find a connection between evolution and God. As one of the few atheists I've met who DOES NOT take evolution as given, I found this episode, chock full of Christians who believed in evolution, too, a good closer of the series.
Overall, the only other comment/complaint I had (again, no subracted star) was that contrary to the last reviewer, I think that any science that calls itself a science needs to be able to welcome criticism. It would've been good for this series to focus a bit more on, not only outside criticisms like creationism, but criticisms from the inside, like Steven Gould's 'spandrel' concept. Still, if the intersted viewer wants to digest those, there is a surfeit of literature. This DVD set will get you more interested in evolution than you thought possible.

Before I knew it, I had watched through the entire series and was wanting even more! I wish that more had been done in the series, particularly an episode dedicated to the budding science of Evolutionary Psychology for example.
 It provides an exacting overview of Evolutionary Theory in our current understanding. At the same time, it provides well explained and detailed analysis of the evidence that has been building behind the theory over the last century or more. Of interest to some was the time spent on the debate between Evolution and Creation *Science*, with a full hour dedicated to the issues of faith and science in and out of the classroom.
 All in all, entertaining and informative to the open minded, likely an affront to the closed minded, this boxed set comes HIGHLY recommended for anyone regardless. Easily worth more than it costs.",1029542400,52,998,4.899408284023669
1633850,1,B00005NGEB,"What a blot on Australian SBS that they showed this propaganda piece founded by Microsoft bigwig Paul Allen.  What is missing is more conspicuous than what's added.  They evidently aim at anaesthetizing the non-atheists to the radical anti-theistic nature of evolution, and dress it up with glossily illustrated science.
What they missed:
They interviewed Ken Ham of Answers in Genesis for several hours and filmed an entire seminar, but omitted all his SCIENTIFIC objections, e.g. how natural selection adds no information.  They also refused to show any Intelligent Design objections except on their ""religion"" episode, so they rightly pulled out.
Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett were among the talking heads, but none of their bigoted hostility towards theism was shown, because the producers knew that blatant atheism would turn off many viewers.  But they are very happy to let people think that evolution and Christianity are compatible, because if they do, they have to separate Christianity from the real world.
Among the mistakes was the claim that our eye is wired backwards.  Fact, if our eye was wired forwards, as advocated by the modernist Catholic evolutionist Kenneth Miller (who has no qualifications or expertise in ophthalmology), there would be no way of regenerating the light receptors quickly.  The cephalopod eye is NOT like a correctly-wired vertebrate eye but like a compound eye with a single lens, and is not as acute as a vertebrate eye.
Fortunately, it is not necessary for me to provide a too-detailed critique, since the Discovery Institute has already produced a very good one.  And in my opinion, Answers in Genesis has produced an even better one, available from their site, as is their CD jam-packed with information.",1021075200,24,1756,5.205673758865248
1633851,3,B00005NGEB,"Despite all our resources and responsibilities, many Americans fail to recognize biological evolution. In my case, local schools never mentioned the subject, and I failed to learn the science behind the science of Life. Compounding this common problem, anti-evolutionists make incessant and persuasive claims against biological theories.
But solutions exist; WGBH Boston and Public Broadcasting bring eight hours worth to DVD. *Evolution: A Journey into Where Were From, and Where Were Going* (2001) offers an updated summary of biological evolution. As a student, it seems to me *Evolution* successfully introduces selected elements of Darwinian and modern synthetic evolution, but its aim is too short and too broad to be a serious argument.
Purpose and People
Dont expect to find a technical treatise in this collection. The program does not delve into punctuated equilibrium, does not delve deeply into genes, and does not delve much into biology formulas or statistics. Concepts such as genetic drift, bottleneck effect, and founder effect are demonstratedbut not labeled. Most noticeable is the absence of classic fossil evidence, such as hominid and dinosaur transitions. Likewise, the program does not seek to underestimate its audience either. Terms such as DNA, genes, mutation and evolution fly about with minimal definition. Doctors and researchers regularly spout dates as if the audience should already agree with them. *Evolution* seems to reach for a middle groundfor people who learned some biology, just not its uniting principle of descent with modification.
Discs with Modifications
That target audience includes me, and *Evolution* reaches out in force. An encyclopedia of biologists, zoologists, and ecologists explain their experiences and present their evidence. Famous evolution-theory authors such as Stephen Jay Gould and Kenneth Miller make brief appearances, and evangelist Ken Ham airs some concerns. Cheesy computer animation helps to reinforce pre-history points. Original footage forms the bulk of this set; much of the footage takes the audience on-location from fossils beds to Neanderthal caves to tropical jungles. Finally, in the same soft tone as his character in *The Phantom Menace*, actor Liam Neeson narrates all four discs, seven episodes, and eight hours.
*Evolutions* first disc contains a two-hour introduction, including a well-produced drama about Charles Darwin. Remaining discs each hold two single-hour episodes. From the title screen the user may play the episodes concurrently or individually, select chapters, and access web-links and closed captioning. The discs also include a reference list of related DVDs. I find the layout simple and direct.
Exhibiting Evidence
Speaking of direct, *Evolution* plunges into biological change. Anti-evolutionists, such as lawyer Philip Johnson or evangelist Duane Gish, argue that little or no evidence demonstrates biological evolution between species. Episode two, Great Transformations provides a summary of fossil evidence for current evolutionary theories. Paleontologist Philip Gingrich displays the fossils of an extinct land predator with the inner ear of a whale, which he first discovered in Pakistan in 1978. He also displays fossils of whales with small hind legs, discovered in a Sahara Desert valley in 1994 by one of his former students. Not long thereafter the program shows the older fossil layer of the Devonian period, and paleontologists such as Jennifer Clack of the University of Cambridge provide a variety of extinct marine animal fossils with the limb bones of land animals. Many of these prehistoric marine fossil beds are shown at the tops of mountains or in deserts. Throughout the parade, fossils are compared and examined onscreen to establish they are transitions between fish and land animals, and land mammals and whales.
*Evolutions* fossil evidence does not speak alone, nor does it speak on just one disc. But equally important is the focus *Evolution* brings to controversy in its final episode What About God? Evangelist Ken Ham of Answers in Genesis ministries explains to the camera:
The Bible says, God created the Earth covered with water; the sun, moon, and stars on day four. Well thats very different to the big bang. If the big bangs true, well the Bible got it wrong on astronomy. The Bible says there was a global flood, but uh, today we have a lot of people say, No there wasnt. Well if the Bible gets it wrong in geology [and] gets it wrong in biology, then why should I trust the Bible when it talks about morality and salvation?
Geology major Nathan Baird of Wheaton College asks us:
What do you do when the evidence is before you and you want to say, Well then this goes completely against my whole upbringing. This completely goes against everything I have known to be true, thus far Thats a struggle Ive gone through this year. Where is God?
Good questions. And now I must question the scope of the program. *Evolution* is too short and too broad to stand on its own as an argument. I already mentioned many things left out in the above Purpose paragraph. I also mentioned the failure to fully define many basic concepts. In addition, the show does not differentiate between old-earth and young earth creationism. *Evolution* does not mention intelligent design theory. *Evolution* often fails to anticipate opposing arguments, leaving me to wonder about alternative interpretations of data. Indeed, my mind felt hungrier than ever by the end of the set.
Conclusion
I wanted to see more evidence, and learn about the techniques used to interperate it. A subject as detailed and complex as biological evolution seems to me should have been presented step-by-step, in a regular series. By making a regular series, at least one year long, *Evolution* could be a thorough, methodical, and perpetually updating focus on biological evolution.
But that is an argument for another essay. I think *Evolution* is much too short and too broad. But I also feel it made selected ideas within biological theories more credible to me. High school and college students especially may find *Evolution* more interesting than a textbook. At the very least, it will help some Americans recognize the science behind the science of Life.",1016582400,22,6263,5.301810865191147
1633852,4,B00005NGEB,"I read through the reviews of this set and I am disappointed to see that several of the reviewers...took this opportunity to preach their hatred (or fear?) of evolution rather than just reviewing the DVD. Here is what I think of the DVD: It is beautifully filmed at times. It covers the subject of evolution better than any TV series I have ever seen, though it doesn't go into the depth that you might find in a college course or even a lot of popular books on evolution--like Daniel Dennet's ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"". But the DVD doesn't put me to sleep like the books do. It is entertaining enough to keep you awake through a subject most of us slept through in school. I would have liked to see at least a passing mention of differing scientific opinions, such as the Aquatic Ape Theory or perhaps something about Punctuated Equilibrium, but I suppose that is too much for a PBS series. Nevertheless, I rate this series a step below ""Cosmos"" and ""Life Beyond Earth"" but higher than almost anything else that I have seen on PBS. This is a very good series, well worth owning.
I must respond to a few misleading assertions of the reviewers I mentioned at the beginning of this review:EVOLUTION IS NOT A THEORY. Evolution is a fact. That the mechanism of evolution is a process known as Natural Selection--that is the theory. Evolution is observed in the fossil record; fact. Natural Selection explains the observation; theory. As for the ""fossil record lacking transitional forms"", you obviously didn't watch the part about transitional whales--whales with four legs, whales with only two legs, modern whales. There are hundreds of known transitional forms, and more being found all the time. And in defense of Daniel Dennet (who seems to be hated almost as much as Darwin), I have read his book ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"" and I assure you he does not ""seriously"" propose putting Baptists in concentration camps. I'm surprised to learn that an adult could take his book that way.
One final thing, scientific people, like me, should not attack religious Christians. It was not by coincidence that modern science began in Christian Europe. Without a certain amount of freedom to question long-held beliefs, modern science could never have begun. And Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Darwin and even Einstein would have made their marks in some field other than science, if at all. Christians are not backwards people. If they really practice the teachings of Jesus Christ, they are the kind of profound, incredibly enlightened people that this world needs more of--but they are still wrong about evolution.",1014595200,77,2602,4.915909090909091
1633853,4,B00005NGEB,"This show is not a perfect introduction to evolution, but it is a good one. Evolution education in the USA is poor, mainly due to the interference of religious groups who oppose it. Since so few people understand evolution and the evidence that supports it, it is easier for those religious groups to mislead people as to what evolution is all about.
I decided to write this after seeing the review from the ""viewer in Seattle""
He claims to believe in Common Descent and to be a trained anthropologist.
But if he were, he would know that the evidence for human evolution is much too great to ""fit into a medium-sized shoe box"". This is a frequent creationist distortion, and an odd claim for someone who accepts common descent.
He also says ""Princeton-educated mathematicians, Physicists, biochemists, molecular biologists, etc. are not YEC ruffians. There are real scientists with genuine complaints about Darwinism. Can't Darwinists even admit that?"" Note that only one field noted deals with biology, and remember that none of these people have written anything in the scientific press. Anyone can get a book published, but it is not so easy to write scientific papers for peer-reviewed journals. Why haven't any of these ""scientists"" ever done so? The truth is they do not do science; at least not where evolution is concerned.
Also, note that Darwinism is not evolution. Watch the show and you will understand this. Darwinism, or Natural Selection, is the theory that explains the observation of evolution. Funny that an anthropologist would not have this basic grasp of science.
The program is quite well done, though I wish it had hit creationism and Intelligent Design (creationist pretending to do scientist) a lot harder. The enemy of creationism is not science; it is honesty.
Portraying why evolution became accepted and remains so is sufficient to do away with any of the claims of YEC or ID style creationist. This program does a good job at hitting the basics, but since it deals with science it does not deal much with creationism.
We do not know everything about life and how it evolved. Any scientist will tell you that. But the evidence shows that life did evolve, and this show gives a good background as to what we do know, and how we know it.
I give it 4 stars.",1013558400,15,2283,4.826530612244898

1633855,4,B00005NGEB,"This series has up to date and accurate information that is appropriate for use in a high school class. I used about 2 hours edited from the series in class- the students were attentive and it explained difficult to teach concepts well with some good computer graphic segments. About 6 of the 8 hours was of high interest for me - about 4 hrs. for the average teen viewer. A few dull spots here and there but overall rivals Life on Earth, Living Planet or Body Atlass for quality series.",1012262400,5,487,4.4222222222222225

This set ends with ""What About God?"" The decision most of us have to make is whether we will adopt science or worship a fictional deity living in the sky. Evolution is based on science, religion is fiction. You can't have it both ways. Those who choose God want to force public schools to teach religion  instead of science.

7947051,5,B00005NGEB,"Where does God belong in Evolution?  If you want to study and understand nature, you have to exclude God.  The philosophy of science is to study natural events through there natural process excluding the gods.  Natural means that an event occurs on its own and it doesn't need intelligent to tell it what to do or how to perform.  Gravity; Nuclear Fusion at the center of the Sun; plate tetonics; etc are all natural events.  Evolution by natural selection is this process that requires no intelligence.  Why does Evolution work?  The answer is ""Advantages"".  It's like gaming in Las Vegas, if gaming was a random chance game, Las Vegas would be nothing more than Ranching community with a railroad running through it.  Gaming and Evolution are chance games, but with advantages. This is why, Gaming don't need to cheat to make money and this is why Evolution don't need intelligence.  I noticed that the preacher kept repeating himself.  This is what I call religious babbling, when they don't have answers to tough questions.

Let's talk about a Theory. A good theory will describe a large range of phenomena on the basis of a few simple postulates and will make definite predictions that can be tested. If predictions agree with the observations, the theory pass the tests, though it can never be proven correct.  (Stephen Hawkings ""Universe in a Nutshell"")

When Evolution first made it's appearance to the public, many challanges were needed to overcome to verify this theory.  Charles Darwin made some of those challanges himself. The first was to find Transistional forms which for man was the missing link. Over many discovers of Man's ancestory, it's not a missing link, but a series of transistion forms.  Many discovers been made of transitional forms from free swimming worms to fish, fish to amphibians, amphibians to reptiles and from reptiles to birds and mammals. All of these have a series of transitional forms. Evolution Theory passed the test. Charles stated that there must be earlier forms of life than of the Cambrian period.  It was just recently discovered of an earlier forms before the Cambrian, again the theory pass the test.  Sexual Selection works because one male can fertilize many females that why males are colorful and females are not.  Again the theory pass the test.  When man was discovered to have only 23 chromosomes while all the great apes have 24, a research has discoverd that 2-chromosomes had fused together to make one in Man.  This must have occurred in one of the transitional forms of Man ancestory.  This was the toughest test, but Evolution was vendicated and passed with flying colors.  Now we know that mutation can occur in chromosomes.

It would be a pity if we lost this powerful tool to Man's arrogance and religious fervor. I would like to ask these religious zealots, do you want to go back to the good old days when a young couple goes out into the world and have a dozen or so children and are lucky to get half of them to adulthood.  Keep messing with Evolution and you will get those good old days.",1329868800,2,3063,4.788571428571428
7947052,5,B00005NGEB,I use Darwin's Dangerous Idea as an intro to the seventh grade discussions of the theory of Natural Selection every year.  This two hour intro to the series alternates between a science history lesson and a clear discussion of the basic principles of the theory of natural selection.  I teach in a Catholic K-8 setting and I believe that showing the video helps my seventh graders put Darwin's ideas into perspective.,1295049600,3,417,4.859154929577465
7947053,5,B00005NGEB,"This series details many of the facts about evolution and just barely touches on other aspects. It would have been great if the series could have been more comprehensive but then it would have been considerably larger. The last two episodes ""The Mind's Big Bang"" and ""What About God?"" reveals where we are today and shows the juxtaposition of the mind being free to learn and grow or being suppressed by unchanging flawed beliefs.

Just because you add the word ""special"" in front of the word ""creation"" does not make it science, nor does it make it special. I had mixed feelings about the young people speaking before the school board. I felt sorry for the children that they were being exploited, but the fact that they were so unaware of how disingenuous they were, reveals a deeper problem. For example, what if schools did adopt a ""special creation"" curriculum. Which creation story should be taught? Native American? Islam? Hindu? Of course these children already knew which creation story they wanted to be taught. They wanted THEIR religious beliefs to be taught in public school.

Most people are so naive as to what the Bible actually teaches. Look at this commandment from the Bible: ""If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered, he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives."" (Deuteronomy 22:28-29 NIV) Can you imagine being raped, then your rapist having to pay your father fifty shekels (about $165 in today's currency) only because he is caught raping you. Then you are forced to marry the man who raped you and can never divorce him. And to make matters worse, it's all done in a way that portrays you as property and that the rapist has done nothing wrong. Would you call this moral? Knowing this verse, I felt embarrassed for the young girls standing up and pushing for such nonsense. The Bible is filled with these type of commandments, from murdering your son if he is stubborn and rebellious (Deuteronomy 21:18-21), to ripping out your eyes if they cause you to lust (Matthew 5:29). Teachings like these provoked Thomas Jefferson to write: ""Millions of innocent men, women, and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, and imprisoned; yet we have not advanced one inch toward uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one-half the world fools and the other half hypocrites. To support roguery and error all over the earth."" This is the reason that people tend to pick and choose the parts of the Bible they accept and the parts they reject, and is the reason there are literally tens of thousands of different Christian denominations in the world.

The Bible teaches that the camel doesn't have cloven feet, which is not true and is not science (Leviticus 11:4). It also states that the rabbit chews cud, which is not true and is not science (Leviticus 11:5). The Bible also teaches that God created the grass and trees on day three then creates the sun and moon on day four, this is not science (Genesis 1:11-19). The Bible teaches that it took God four days to create the earth and its contents but he creates the entire, complete, complex universe in a moment of time, this is not science.

I believe the reason most people cannot let go of a god or a creator is that they actually experience loss just as you would in losing a loved one. It is hard to dispel a lie that has an emotional attachment. This is the basis of fanaticism, the fanatic or fan has become emotionally attached to the object of their affection or obsession. Their feelings are mistaken for substance and reality. The object of their affection (Santa, pets, God) must ""love"" them because they ""feel it"" so strongly. You can actually see the emotion in the last episode when the young students ask, ""What About God"". I once saw a young girl in utter grief, sobbing uncontrollably, and could not be comforted. I learned that someone had told her that Santa did not exist, and it was as if she had lost an actual loved one. Some might say, how awful that someone told her the truth about Santa. I say, how awful that someone told her the lie in the first place.",1292976000,3,4279,4.633728590250329
7947054,5,B00005NGEB,"Although I'm moderately sophisticated in my understanding of evolution, I still found plenty of things to hold my interest in this intellectually exciting and well-crafted series. The set covers most of the basic ideas, in addition to a nice treatment of Darwin's life. Liam Neeson was also the perfect choice as narrator.

The only thing I didn't like so much was the section on the conflict with faith. I think the pro-science community, including the producers of this series, give up way too much ground to the ""established"" religions (in this case Christianity) and their absurd, anti-intellectual views. Most people in the science community don't privately accord believers nearly this much respect for the simple reason that they haven't earned it and continue to undermine science with their faith-based ramblings. On the other hand, when you see Ken Ham try to refute scientific fact, there's really only one conclusion you can draw. So perhaps the producers did the right thing by letting this speak for itself. In any case, this set should be required viewing in our public schools. I think it would go a long way to solving the ignorance problem that continues to plague this country.
