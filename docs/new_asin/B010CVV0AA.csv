8722131,5,B010CVV0AA,"This series continues to be one of the funniest series to come out recently. If you've enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Excel-Saga-Complete-Collection/dp/B000FWHVOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Excel Saga - Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sgt-Frog-Season-1-Part-1/dp/B002FOQXVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sgt. Frog: Season 1, Part 1</a>, you'll get a kick out of this. The writing, for the most part, continues to be top notch, although it some of the originality of the episodes from the first disc seems to be lacking.

For the most part, the series is appropriate to watch with my 10 and 13 year old daughters. One particular episode (#10) seemed to written/directed by someone different than the rest and had more fan service scenes (one very scanty clad/well-endowed ""guest"" character) than the rest of the episodes. This episode did not seem to fit with the rest of the episodes and wasn't particularly well done.

The lack of english dubbing was surprising but I think the series would lose something without the original Japanese track. My kids have no trouble keeping up with it.",1255219200,4,1211,6.423312883435583
8722132,1,B010CVV0AA,"Hayate the Combat Butler,
  It's a 51 Episode series that Bandai is releasing in 7 eps at a time.
It's over priced even for a (Hyb) but this is a subtitle only and the
only possible plus is the lower compression then the import [...].  I enjoyed the series and if it
were dub in English I'd buy it again.  Bandai has delayed the
release of it's dubbed titles to release these overpriced subtitle
dvd's.",1252886400,7,402,4.32
