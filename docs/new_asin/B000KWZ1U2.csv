2698007,3,B000KWZ1U2,"If a flying fortress, technology from the past, a hero with possessed powers, and a moral struggle with nature and humankind sound familiar, it's because they've all been done before.  Origin doesn't add much to the pot in these areas, featuring rather depthless characters and a plot with less twists than Interstate 40.  It borrows heavily from Ghibli greats (Nausicaa, Castle in the Sky, Mononoke), but lacks the charm and conviction of these films.  Still, Origin will likely win its share of fans thanks to the visual adventure and immersive backgrounds.  If characters and plot aren't an issue, and you just want to be entertained, the eye candy that is Origin may be for you.",1168041600,110,682,4.904347826086957

2698103,2,B000KWZ1U2,"I had rented this movie a few years ago and my opinion is unchanged since then. This movie REALLY wants to emulate the style of Hayao Miyazaki without any of the heart or tact his movies have. There are some creative ideas here that would make for an interesting movie, but they aren't explored to their full depth. An example would be the mysterious forest monks in the beginning. They're easily the most memorable thing, because none of the protagonists stand out. They're run of the mill anime archtypes that play their role. The scenery while undeniably beautiful is wasted with such a ham fisted ""science bad and military bad, nature good!"" plot. The last and greatest of it's sins is to give the hero Deus Ex Machina powers to fix the holes in the plot's finale.

I think a lot of the problems present could have been ironed out if the they had more time to work with, like a series instead of a movie. What we got is a movie that DESPERATELY wants to be Princess Mononoke, but ends up more like Fern Gully. It is a disappointment, maybe if they worked more on making the characters more believable, this movie would have more of it's own identity instead of just being a Ghibli rip off.",1462060800,,1193,4.472477064220183

The plot felt so dry as if no one really put enough effort into it.  Must have been produced by a bunch of great graphic artists who ran out of money for a good story writer.  Think ""Castle in the Sky"" crossed with ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"", but not half the movie of either of those.",1418256000,,439,4.27710843373494

2698238,5,B000KWZ1U2,"A lot of opinions seem to vary on this movie, and the range from amazing to horrible. However, I think that this is a wonderful movie, and, even though the characteristics of the movie are the same as in others, I still fall in love with the movie each time that I watch it.
I have to admit that the art is similar to what you would see in Studio Ghibli movies, but I don't think that people should view it as depleting the quality or the greatness of the movie. I hope that if you buy this movie based on all of the good reviews, rather than the bad, that you thoroughly enjoy it as others and I have.",1408060800,,602,4.025

2698242,5,B000KWZ1U2,"I loved the story! While I care nothing for the ""global warming"" hoax, this anime captured my attention and imagination. It's vivid, has beautiful storyboards, and great character development, and of course, a terrific story line. It has it's share of action, but much is about ""everyday life"", according to the world of this show. It's about nature and man becoming as one, if you will.",1405296000,,387,4.878787878787879

2698246,2,B000KWZ1U2,"I wanted to like this movie; the style and animation are beautiful; the setting is in a fantasy that interests me; but I just couldn't stand to watch it. It was very slow-moving, boring, and obvious. I kept falling asleep at a maximum of 25-30 minutes in.  Maybe something spectacular happens after that, but I'd say there are better options for your money in the genre that are enjoyable from the start.",1395705600,,404,4.611111111111111
2698247,4,B000KWZ1U2,I really enjoyed this movie.  It had a unique take on a probable future and the opening scene cleverly shows the back story to the demise of earth.  I thought the film itself is visually stunning and the music pairs great with the story.  Everything worked together to deliver a great movie.,1393977600,,291,4.5576923076923075
2698248,3,B000KWZ1U2,"This one got such a beautiful and promising opening scene (that song helped a lot too),
yet unfortunately, rest of the story isn't that good at all. And it's not the story, really, but the story teller's the one to blame,
this could've been a fascinating anime, to put it simple, it's like been given some superb raw materials, yet due to the aptitude of the
cook, the final product doesn't taste that well.",1390953600,,407,4.513513513513513

2698273,1,B000KWZ1U2,"Perhaps I'm just getting too old, but I rented this and watched it with my kids after reading some good recommendations on ""clean"" anime, and I couldn't have been less entertained. Visually, this movie is all there. Substance? I didn't learn a thing, it didn't challenge my thinking, it didn't build my curiosity or ""suspend"" me. It didn't scare me. It sort of made me laugh at how corny, awkward, and absurd some of the voice acting, dialogue, and character movements were executed. That's why I say perhaps I'm getting too old. I used to like anime when I was younger. Maybe it's that I see the ideology so clearly now. The whole ""we are all one, the earth and us are connected"" like from the Final Fantasy games. I used to overlook it and think of it as ""SciFi"", but I think SciFi presents different ways of looking at things, or presenting ideas for new technology, whereas this seems like the same thing rehashed over and over with different characters.",1383004800,5,958,4.608187134502924

2698308,5,B000KWZ1U2,"You can read the blurb/summation of the story. This is a beautifully animated, and well told story. The story line while seemingly simple is wonderfully complex. It ranks, as far as I'm concerned, right up there with GRAVE OF THE FREFLIES. I will as the story is not as down as GRAVE the story and its moral are equally important. The sound track is OK there are segments where it really not needed, and some places a little heavy handed as well as being way to western.
  Would I recommend this story, yes definitely. While this film is excellent, because of the musical score And it almost mis-matched score, it does not quiet make it to the epic status of GRAVE or AKIRA.  However, the animation definitely belongs up there.
  Yes, I would recommend view and having it in ones collection.",1364688000,,791,4.581560283687943

Nothing about how she got there her history or anything. And that goes for alot of other characters.,1363910400,,401,4.153846153846154

2698334,2,B000KWZ1U2,"I found this movie to be terribly disappointing. The setting, while not terribly original, had potential for a good story Unfortunately, the plot is cringe-worthy. I won't go into detail to avoid spoilers, but if you thought there would be some clever plot-twists to put some nuances into the naive ""forest good, technology bad"", you'd be mistaken. There are many other things wrong with the plot, but I think the walking volcano (yes, you read that right) sums it up nicely. Was there really a need to put mechanical legs on a volcano so that it can uproot itself and travel a couple of hundred miles, all the while spewing fire and brimstone to finally erupt in a completely different place? They didn't even try to make the plot work, and it shows all through the movie. Characters are flat as cardboard too. Just barely avoids one star rating because of decent, though not spectacular visuals.

In one word, avoid.",1359072000,,918,4.7375

2698338,3,B000KWZ1U2,"Note that this film gets compared to Miyazaki's because of the theme, but it is not Miyazaki's work for sure. While this one had the potential if it were a mini-series, it's just simply too rushed.

2698368,4,B000KWZ1U2,"I have just finished watching this film and let me say it was a good purchase.  I have been wanting to view this for some time after seeing the trailer on Youtube.  While this film is not perfect, specifically in it's story conveying, it is still a worthy addition to any anime collector's stash.

**Minor Spoiler Alert**

I do not go too much in depth anymore on the plots/stories of films on Amazon.  If you want a thorough review, they already exist here and Wikipedia has a decent outline of the film.

What I will say is that this film focuses on mankind trying to live in harmony with the forest.  Of course this is no ordinary forest, but a sentient being created by us hundreds of years ago.  This vegation was being experimented on by scientists on the moon.  One day in an explosive but glorious moment the vegation becomes self aware and breaks free of it's bio-dome and completely shatters the moon and flings itself down to Earth where it becomes the dominant life-force.

Note by a tv geek, the moon looks like the shattered moon from 'Thundarr: The Barbarian'.  This is kind of a typical post apocalypic film where mankind is trying to pick up the pieces and start over.  The animation is beautiful and you are treated to sprawling green and red environments the entire film.

Now the cons.

While this movie is rendered amazingly, it is incomplete in it's execution of it's story.  I got the feeling this was supposed to be at minimum a 12 episode series, that got slashed down to a single film.  There is a lot that is not hashed out enough.  The enhanced humans, the forest birthing children, who were the Druids, the list goes on and on...

You will be scratching your head when this film is over.  Also make sure and watch through the credits there is stuff after them.  Perhaps if I had bought a 2-disc edition of this anime I would have been granted a better understanding of the story.  Perhaps disc-2 would have had the writers getting their brains picked in an interview, who knows.  This is a film only, no special features/featurettes.

**Conclusion**

In the end despite the lingering questions, you will not feel cheated.  The hero does win, evil is stopped, bad guys see the errors of their ways, etc.  If you are a fan of Anime you more than likely will enjoy this feature film.  This is getting a little rare to find though.  I myself had to get the Viridian re-release.  I will say that if the 2-disc edition has some question answering special features in it, I would opt for that.

Overall despite it's flaws, this wonderfully awe-inspiring film will win you over with the animation quality alone.  Also the musical score is fantastic and the opening scene is one you will never forget.  This is a solid buy if the price is right for you.  Now on to watch another film I finally got from Amazon, 'Princess Mononoke', I have high hopes for this one.

Well that's my 2 cents worth, sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes.  I went to public school, where our history books were so old America was called the best 48 states in the world...",1349136000,,3071,4.531876138433516
2698369,2,B000KWZ1U2,"The beginning of the movie seemed like it had potential. I think some of the ideas in the story could have been developed into a more interesting film, for example, the concept of enhanced beings and plant growth taking on a life of it's own.

However, ultimately, the movie was short on story, plot, and character development. We don't get a good feel for who Agito and Toola are, and what they stand for. Alot of the film seems to be Agito screaming ""Toola!"", and Toola screaming ""Agito!""

I really did not get the point of it and I didn't like the ending either. If you ask me, the ending was rather inconclusive.

2698394,5,B000KWZ1U2,"To start, most people will draw comparisons to Miyazaki's fantastic classics that have never failed to capture his viewers in a sense of awe-inspiring magic. I find what most people asked me about this movie after I had watched it was how closely it was related to Miyazaki's films. Then to address this, it's pretty easy to draw comparisons to original stories, such as nature vs industrialization. It's pretty clear that the main plot, or problem, is unoriginal. BUT that isn't to say it isn't great! As one reviewer already pointed out that when you were a kid, you loved to listen to the same stories over and over again. Think back to your Disney childhood and see all the Princess stories and how you, most likely, enjoyed almost every one of them. Yes, guys too. So to say that this movie isn't worth watching due to its already used plot is quite absurd.

 *BEGIN SPOILERS*
Besides, it's not the problem that makes the story but how you solve that problem. This movie solves the problem in such a way as to invoke thought about how you treat your own life in conjuncture with nature. Agito, after joining his subconscious with the Forest, learns that nature is a dual system. Nature takes life and gives life.  So far throughout the movie, we only see nature take life with it's dragon like plant monsters, but after Agito sacrifices himself to protect the Forest and realizes just how important the Forest and nature is to the world for its survival, we see the life giving side of nature and how humans and nature coexist. Agito is reborn, like a butterfly from a cocoon, and goes on to help people live with the Forest.
*END SPOILERS*

Moving on. The music is absolutely fantastic! I cannot say how much the opening song is relevant and draws the viewer in with it's tempo and timbre. It fits perfectly. The rest of the music for the movie is also amazing, but this song sticks out to me. To draw a comparison, it's like the Skyrim theme song. It'll play in the movie at the perfect times to draw you in to what is happening and immerse you in a world that is alien yet inviting all the same.

The visuals and setting were, in my honest opinion, one of the best I've seen since a Miyazaki movie. The drawing is detailed and creative, making you want to live in such a world where everything is green. The designs for characters were not overblown or underdone; they found their happy medium. The ONLY gripe I have about the visuals are the machines. When it cuts to action scenes where the turrets and batteries are involved, it has some pretty obvious and bad CG animation. It drew me away slightly from what was happening at the sudden shift in graphics and visuals, diminishing what would be an even more fantastic scene if the CG hadn't taken me by surprise.

All in all, I highly recommend the movie and what little gripe I could produce doesn't hinder the movie as a whole; not in the least.

2698395,3,B000KWZ1U2,"The artwork can't be faulted; this is a beautiful looking film.  It's the storytelling that completely fails on all levels.  There's little attempt to explain anything, the characters suffer from lack of development, history is glossed over yet is supposed to be a major component, the 3 divided fractions are hardly mentioned, the pacing is haphazard.......  It felt more like a synopsis of a movie rather than an entire movie; at times I thought I was watching the trailer, there had to be more to it than this.
I will admit I liked the beginning.  The simple uninvolved plot began slowly, enjoyably, but then it abruptly jumped a point or two when the main character, Agito suddenly becomes PLANTBOY, superhero supreme.  I kept thinking I blinked and missed a scene or two, but no, I didn't.  The pace scurries along after that, rushing to the climactic battle sequence (this involves a walking volcano that somehow manages to bring its supply of lava with it!).  Inside the volcano, another battle was briefly waged between PLANTBOY and the uncomplicated villain who proves that old adage, once a crazy person always a crazy person.
And the cause of all the fuss.....a few unruly plants and issues with water rights.

It is a very origonal story of a future in which man's follies to improve nature ends up with nature controling man and their means to survive. The story takes place 300 years after a global turn of events and now a young boy named Agito uncovers a link to a past he never knew in a girl named Toola. Toola doesn't understand this world, and yearns to go back to the world that she remembers. Through this meeting Nature is lashing out against humanity saying this girl with be the final downfall of man.

What captured me in this film was the opening sequesnce. It is amazing how the perfect art direction and music can turn a moment in time that is so terrifying into something beautiful. The animation helps a lot as well. It is a beautiful and one of as kind blend of CGI and classic cell animation. However, this film did lack in the character development department. I didn't really find any of the characters turly memorable and there was just not enough in there to really have the characters create as much of an impact as the animation. The story is very easy to follow, which is a hard thing to find in anime films so this movie will just fly by as you watch it.

2698399,1,B000KWZ1U2,"So, being a huge fan of well done adult themed & movie type anime (as opposed to a series) such as ""Ghost in the Shell"", ""Jin-Roh"", ""Akira"", ""Howl's Moving Castle"" and so forth, I was interested in seeing this film. As I was watching it, I kept thinking ""wow, this looks familiar"" and it hit me: it's simply an anime version of James Cameron's ""Avatar(d)"" just with a different direction. And like ""Avatar(d)"" -it was pointless...

Let me say this: the visuals and illustration are top-notch and stunning. There are grand views, lot's of detail and there was a lot of effort into creating them, so kudos to the production company. The voice acting (I only saw the English version) was pretty good, nothing special but pretty good. That's about where the compliments end, from me at least.

James Cameron created ""Avatar(d)"" and wowed us all with the stunning visuals and effects but the story was diluted and tired -a re-dress of the same stupid theme we've seen time & time again: Man vs. Nature, co-existing, one special person who is the key to it all, man must temper his ambition and not destroy everything (something I'm not necessarily against) but the same crap.

Aaaaaand like ""Avatar(d)"" it addressed the same pointless concerns, maybe in a different setting & plot but nonetheless the same garbage. If you like your anime dumbed-down to humans are destroying the world and nature must keep us in check and we're ""all connected"" -this is your ticket. My advice -rent ""Avatar(d)"" and save yourself some money. This had so much potential and they wasted it on following a formula.

Humans must either learn to live in harmony with the forest, or die.  One faction has decided to fight - they industrialize, create weapons and have one goal - destruction of the forests. Another faction wants to live in harmony. This sets the stage for the movie. The forest also has a special weapon: they can genetically modify humans into super weapons.

The peace loving faction lives among the crumbling ruins of the past, eking out a basic lifestyle, staying in harmony with the forest.

2698435,3,B000KWZ1U2,"I was really excited when I ordered ""Origin: Spirits of the Past"", but I'm sad to say that I was slightly disappointed with the movie.  There were some great parts about the film, like the musical score and the animation was simply splendid to watch.  On a visual level it is simply fantastic.  The idea is fairly original and well executed except for the fact that there is little to no character development.  The film starts at a good pace, but after the discovery of Toola it lurches forward unexpectedly in the plot.  The lack of development makes the decisions of the characters a little confusing.  I think this movie could have been truly fantastic if they had taken more time to delve into the character motivations a little more.

It would have been better if:

(These might be considered spoilers, I tried to keep it vague, but read at your own risk)

- There was a reason to suspect a strong bond between Agito and Toola, or a connection between Toola and the town.  Overall the time that they spend together is rather small and there is no reason think that Toola cares significantly about Agito or the town until the end, and then it just seems a bit out of place.  If they had spent more time developing the relationships and Toola's own feelings of displacement then a lot of my qualms would be erased.
-  The other part of the film that didn't seem consistent was Agito's enhancement.  I understand why it was there, and agree that it should have been, but I would have liked to see, again the relationship with Toola that would make him feel so determined to take on that option, and if there was maybe a little character struggle with the decision.

Those are the aspects of the film that were really missing.  Without understanding fully the motivations of the characters, the actions seemed out of place.  Structurally the plot is great, but there is a lot that you have to fill in to make sense of it.  I didn't connect with the struggle of any of the characters, and didn't enjoy the viewing process.  Maybe if I watch it again, then I will enjoy it more- now that I've filled in the gaps with my own imagination.

You might not like if:
-  If you are somebody, like me, who finds character development a really important aspect of anime, then I might suggest you pass on Origin.  If you are interested in the genre of post-apocalyptic and/or struggles of mankind with nature I would suggest:  Princess Mononoke, Wolf's Rain, Laputa: Castle in the Sky.

You will probably enjoy if:
- You watch anime for the aesthetics of the art.  This is a beautifully rendered anime visually.
- You are an AMV maker.  (I am, and this is the redeeming part of this purchase for me).  There is some excellent footage to really spice up an AMV.
-  Excessive character development is not your style.

This film has excellent post apocalyptic and environmental themes that infuse it with a sense of drama and excitement, as soon as you've watched fifteen minutes you'll be hooked to the very end. The tag line on the cover says 'the most impressive looking anime movie to come out since Steamboy' and I'm inclined to agree. The film is beautifully rendered and the animation is lush and detailed. If you like ghibli and more modern manga and anime then this film will be right up your street. This film is superbly dubbed into English and you get none of that cheesy dubbing from past anime films i've seen. The story was reminiscent of 'Nausicaa' in places, what with the forest fighting back, but it comes from a genetic modification angle, that ties the film into advances in science since that film and the perceived dangers associated with them. At just under 90 minutes this film is a perfect length and will easily keep your attention for the duration. A top anime film that comes highly recommended.

2698440,3,B000KWZ1U2,"Okay, I'll start off by saying that this is seriously one of the loveliest and most visually compelling animated movies I've ever seen. The animation and the backgrounds are just stunning to look at, the English dub voices are decent, and the premise of the plot itself has a lot of promise.

For me, though, the story falls apart - and not because of its supposed lack of ""originality"", which by the way I disagree with - sure, Origins deals with nature and eco-friendly themes the way many other anime films have, but I think it does so in a way of its own that sets it apart from other works. Seriously, this could have been good.

Where it fell apart for me was in the characters and pacing. Agito, Toola, the villain, etc. - they were all just flat-out uninteresting, and no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't feel any empathy for any of them. The relationship between Agito and Toola was particularly irritating. One could count the number of their interactions, all of which are brief, on one hand; yet as soon as Toola goes traipsing off, he's suddenly throwing himself all over creation and his dialogue for the rest of the movie consists of nothing but anguished howls of ""TOOOOOOO-LAAAAAAAAA!!"" Toola herself is also kind of obnoxious. She's pretty, frail-looking, and has a mysterious and powerful necklace which only she can use - and that's about it. Aside from that she's just useless and whiny.

I'm actually surprised that the movie everyone is citing as having been the major influence for Origins is Miyazaki's Nausicaa. I can see some influence there, all right, but plot-wise and character-wise, it seems to me that Origins draws much more influence from another Miyazaki work - Castle in the Sky, which was far more complex and thought-provoking than Origins. Origins had a good concept and beautiful presentation, but the rest of it doesn't live up to these things.",1289001600,,1894,4.750759878419453

The first half of the movie setup characters with incredible powers, and teased with the potential for those powers.  The second half got bogged down in character interactions and drama, but I was expecting it to build on and extend the action sequences from the first half, but instead the movie sorta fizzled.

The saving grace was the consistent high-quality production values, from interesting characters, consistently good voice acting, direction, and animation quality.

Oh yeah, this experiment took place on the moon and the plants proceeded to partially destroy it. The great jist of the story is man and plant need to work together instead of trying to kill each other. The first half of the flick was pretty amazing in it's storytelling and presentation.

2698475,3,B000KWZ1U2,"It's easy to get blown away in the first few minutes of ""Origin: Spirits of the Past,"" where we're treated to exquisitely creepy celestial visuals and a gorgeous theme song.

It's also a suitable lead-in for this beautifully animated movie about a not-so-distant future in which human civilization lies in dystopic ruins, and a vast sentient forest has taken control. The animation is stunningly lush and complex, and the lone-hero rescuer story is surprisingly moving... and it almost makes up for the fact that the eco-friendly plot makes absolutely no logical sense.

When a young boy named Agito stumbles on an underground chamber, he finds a girl cryogenically preserved for the past three hundred years. Toola is understandably upset by this -- and since she has an electronic neck device, her presence angers the Forest, who fear that she might be used by the militaristic land of Ragna. Of course, the Ragnan leader Shunack -- another survivor from three hundred years ago -- turns up to persuade her.

It turns out that Shunack wants to use E.S.T.O.C., a mysterious device that will return the world to the way it once was, and Toola rather understandably decides to help him. Agito's only hope for stopping them -- and keeping the forest safe -- is to undergo ""enhancement"" that genetically bonds him to the Forest's trees. But even that might not stop the might of Ragna's armies... and stuff, especially since Shunack is also ""enhanced.""

""Origin: Spirits of the Past"" is a gorgeous film -- the animation is lushly-drawn and full of ruined buildings, vines, shimmering glades, great writhing vines and vast moving mountains full of weapons. Some of the more chilling images (such as Agito's dad slowly turning into a tree, or the seeming loss of Toola in a burning train) are exquisitely haunting, all the more so because they aren't played for horror. It is, simply put, a gorgeous piece of work.

It also comes up with an intriguing and slightly eerie concept for a sci-fi movie -- that plants engineered to withstand extraterrestrial life would mutate and become the dominant force on Earth, changing themselves even as they become integrated by humanity. The ruinous dystopia that results is both beautiful and disturbing.

The problem is, the plot makes no sense: presumably the whole living-in-harmony-with-Forest thing is symbolic of living in harmony with nature. But since the Forest was mutated by humans, wrecked the world, genetically altered the survivors and keeps civilization in a stagnant stranglehold, it's about as unnatural as you can get. And the alleged bad guys just want to switch the world back to its pre-mutant-plant state when man and nature were in balance... meaning that the Designated Anti-Nature Bad Guy is actually the Pro-Nature Good Guy.

Evidently, logic need not apply. Even director Keiichi Sugiyama belatedly seems to realize this, so he throws a rather random ""villains will destroy a town"" twist into the mix to the bad guy will really seem, y'know, bad. It doesn't quite work.

Additionally, Toola and Shunack are the most likable characters in the mix -- Toola is understandably miserable and freaked by the loss of the world she once knew, and the people with it. And while Shunack has made his place in this remade world and gotten a position of power, he's wracked by guilt over his part in the Forest's rise. Agito is a pleasant little hero who goes to extreme lengths, but he seems rather bland by comparison.

""Origin: Spirits of the Past"" is a gorgeous piece of animation with a hauntingly sober backdrop, but the actual plot about the Forest makes no sense at all. Enjoy for the copious eye candy, but don't expect deep stuff here.",1274659200,7,3695,4.93719806763285

2698477,4,B000KWZ1U2,"While this storyline may not be so original, it was still very entertaining, the characters are very likeable, and the animation and music more than make up for it. It's not a very easy feat combining an action/adventure with drama and lighthearted romance.
The English dub was very well performed-we need more done like this.

The blu-ray was clear as a bell( of course) and this would've gotten a higher score but I've seen this similar story with Princess Mononoke-damn near identical.

In any case, I think still that this isn't one to pass up. One of the best anime movies I've seen in a while.

2698478,3,B000KWZ1U2,"I don't get why everyone's so gaga for the visuals in this movie. Sure, there are a couple of good moments; however, most of the movie is done with horrible shading (similar style to a lot of 15 year old anime fan artists out there). This jarring, overly blurred shading only brings your attention to the other deficits in the drawing.

The line quality is garbage - I couldn't believe I was watching a bluray at first. I thought I had mistakenly bought the DVD, but no. There's no refinement to the line, nor is the line pleasantly unrefined. It's simply awful.

Most egregious is the coloring. The whole thing looks like it was colored by a high schooler. Some shots look awfully oversaturated, and sometimes the hue of people/objects doesn't change even under drastically different lighting.

I cannot believe an art director gave the go ahead on this. Most TV quality animators do better.",1264896000,,892,4.741935483870968

It's a decent watch and I don't regret the time I invested in it, but I was underwhelmed with the rather derivative elements of the story. Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa are both stronger films dealing with many of the same concerns- nature v. man, man v. man, you know the drill if you've watched anything by Hayao Miyazaki. Even the main female lead feels like a Mononoke castoff. The animation is beautiful and despite my issues with the storyline, it's sadly one of the better animes I've watched in the last year or so. If you have an evening to kill, I'd say to go for it. If you're looking for something truly impressive, go somewhere else.",1263254400,3,723,4.526717557251908

*Spoilers*

It is difficult to deny the strong ""nature vs. technology"" theme in so many good anime movies, but like the others before it (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nausicaa/dp/B0001XAPZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nausicaa</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Mononoke/dp/B00003CXBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Mononoke</a>), ""Origin"" takes a difficult subject and contributes something meaningful to it.

Indeed, in some ways I like this movie more than ""Princess Mononoke"", and that's not meant as light praise. ""Origin"" takes the difficult position of defining nature as the aggressive, destructive force at the beginning of the movie, and trusts that we'll come around to the opposition side at the end: that nature's 'destructive' force is just one aspect of its job as a force for renewal and rebirth - in other words, you can't have life without death and decay. Whereas ""Mononoke"" ends with a sort of plot-induced 'truce' on the part of man and nature (I say 'plot-induced' because nature has definitely gotten the short end of the stick, with most of the animals and all of the gods dead and gone... and the humans openly planning to keep doing what they've been doing all along), ""Origin"" ends on a more triumphalistic note - namely, that trying to fight the forest is futile because in the end, we will all succumb to death regardless.

Although it's difficult to stand out as a nature anime, ""Origin"" stands out in other, satisfying ways. Everyone in the movie is pleasantly sane and sensible, from the young girl awakened out of a deep cryogenic sleep, to the leaders of the village she comes to live in, to the children who come to love her, and even to the 'villain' who wants to right the wrongs of his past. It is refreshing to see sensible adults, moderate communities, villains with depth, and children who are more than Mary Sue stand-ins for the authors - something that all movies could stand to see more of. And it is nice to see a forest with a 'dark' side - this isn't a Disney forest where everything is light and good and perfect; though the forest may be justified in its concerns and actions, they are not played lightly or for laughs. If you enjoyed ""Nausicaa"" or ""Princess Mononoke"" and would like to see another take on this common theme of nature vs. humanity, do check out ""Origin"" - you won't be disappointed.

2698482,5,B000KWZ1U2,"A previous review stated that a flying fortress, technology from the past, a hero with possessed powers, and a moral struggle with nature and humankind has been done before, well thats just fine by me because I love all those things espcially the hero with possesed powers bit. I don't care that its been done before becuase frankly all these things rock hard in my book.

Amazing animation, beatiful soundtrack, I LIKED the story, it was straight forward and didn't leave me wondering what the hell was happening(*cough* Karas *cough*). The only thing I found it somewhat lacking was character development and to a lesser extent the character design which wasn't as detailed as I would have liked. Seriously man when Agito gets those magic tree powers the fun really begins to take off, he can kick some serious ass. The dialog was ok too, charcters didn't stop speaking midway through sentences or stand there saying nothing when other characters spoke with them like in so many other animes i've seen. I didn't find the movie preachy at all, the people who find it preachy are probably the same people who litter and don't recycle(just kidding). Well theres not much else I can say. I really liked it.

It wasn't perfect but its still gets a 5 because of great animation and action sequences(i just love those magic tree powers), awesome sound track (the song ""with reflection"" by female artist Kokia is amazing), a happy ending(if i'm going to sit down and watch anything for more then an hour it better have a happy ending or i will not be pleased) and most of all replay value i've watched it so many times.

And while Shunack has made his place in this remade world and gotten a position of power, he's wracked by guilt over his part in the Forest's rise. Agito is a pleasant little hero who goes to extreme lengths, but he seems rather bland by comparison.

""Origin: Spirits of the Past"" is a gorgeous piece of animation with a hauntingly sober backdrop, but the actual plot about the Forest makes no sense at all. Enjoy for the copious eye candy, but don't expect deep stuff here.",1241740800,18,3695,4.93719806763285

2698544,5,B000KWZ1U2,"Three hundred years after a global catacylsm where the coming of an entity called the Forest Dragon wipes out most of human civilization and restores a severely weakened natural world to a state of primal supremacy on the planet, a find from the past shakes up the global balance that's precariously positioned itself.  The vast forest is supreme, but bands of humans still exist and have learned to grow in this new world - only two groups are involved in the movie (there may well be others elsewhere on the globe), one of which lives on the cliffs that border the jungle and have managed to build a fairly prosperous though low-tech existance, scavenging relics from the ruins and existing in a sort of comfortable truce with the forest and the plant-life humanoids that now dwell in it and seem to act as its agents/emissaries.  The other civilization is a militaristic society that's re-industrialized a small slice of territory and whose ultimate aim is an outright war with the sentient forest.  When a pair of young scavengers from the first (cliff-dwelling) groups stumble across an immaculately preserved laboratory/bunker deep under the forest and the ruins, they end up awakening a girl from suspended animation, who went under right at the end of the old world civilization.  She's welcomed into the cliff society but aggressively sought by the militaristic state, who believe that she has knowledge from the past that could help them to restore the world to its pre-cataclysm state.

  Though the cliff-dwelling society that's aligned itself in truce with the forest is clearly the 'good guys' of the two factions, the industrialized group isn't depicted as gratuitously evil.  Most of its number seek to restore the previous state of the world because they see it as a better future for humanity, not out of any maniacal, blind hate for the natural world or mad powerlust.  They fear the forest greatly, and don't seem to consider that it could have crushed the new human societies at any time but is letting them exist as long as it, the forest, isn't directly attacked.  That's MOST of the residents of the industrialized state; their leaders seem to have a much darker and more control-hungry nature.  The bulk of the industrialized society seems to view the forest and its 'entities' as having started the war with the catacylsm; the forest itself clearly would view that man started it with its widespread destruction of the natural world that forced it to act, with more power than anyone would have assumed nature possessed.  The cliff society doesn't really seem to dwell on who started it, but have long since established a peace with the surrounding forest that leaves both sides from encroaching too much on the other and at peace.  The leaders of the industrial society seem to view that as a weak path.

  In the days following the awakening of the girl from the past (as it also comes to light that another from the past had awakened before), all kinds of secrets from ages ago, and revelations about the true state of the world, come out, as events that have been building up for years suddenly rush towards a potential armageddon.

  The movie has one of the most mind-blowing openings ever put on film with the dawn of the Forest Dragon; it also has one of the most...amazing endings ever.  I'd like to describe in what way it's amazing, but that would clearly give too much away.  Just be sure to watch all the way past the end credits to see both the finale and its coda.

  I know not everyone's interested in such things, but I thought it worth mentioning that the packaging of this movie is superb, with great artwork and metallic-looking, light embossing on its outer sleeve, and a fold-out inside packed with quick looks at a number of the distributor's other anime titles.  Also a great trailer gallery for relatively obscure anime and non-anime titles, too.

  My sole complaint is that this could have easily been far longer and have lost nothing, there's so much going on it.  It's 90 minutes in length and could have easily been twice that.  It could have even been a 5-or-6 disc series, and greatly beefed up the roles of some of the supporting characters and expanded on some of the secondary concepts.  With it being this good though, I don't want to gripe too much.

The story, however, was entertaining, but there are a couple of points where everything grinds to a halt and takes awhile to pick the speed back up.

Yes, it has a distinct Ghibli feel to it, and while they don't pull off the grandness that movies like Nausiica and Mononoke Hime manage this movie is still a wonderful watch.  The man vs. nature theme is done well, not going overly preachy, but more thought provoking.  As others have mentioned, the scenery is beautiful and masterfully rendered.  The characters weren't overly captivating, but certainly likable and interesting to watch.  The music was gorgeous (and the Kokia song at the end is her best song, in my opinion) and worth the viewing just to hear it.

My only complaint is that this should have been longer.  I saw the original theatric previews and they showed more characters and much more depth.  Some intruiging scenes were apparently just cut out or were just left out after they put out the previews.

This anime movie has an amazing concept when it comes to the storyline (i.e. the opening sequence, the idea of plants taking over, interesting future concept), but its execution wasn't great.  For example, the climactic scenes aren't all that climactic and the story has so many loose ends. You don't really see much of the military city's ""power"", the forest druids that are supposed to be the guardians of the forest don't show up much either, and the supporting characters have little to no purpose. Recycled themes aren't necessarily a bad thing, because if they were done well enough, it wouldn't make much of a difference how many times the themes were used.  So, I have to stand up for Origin there because this seems to be the main reason that this movie gets a bad rap.

You really don't get a good sense of who the characters are and they don't really connect to each other.  They seem to lack polish: the youth are average youth, the adults are average adults, but there's no sort of individuality that makes you remember them. Most of all, they lack emotion. The character design and voice acting was average, though. However, the art and environments were top-notch! The beautiful environment really gives you that sense of depth and adventure, redeeming this movie from mediocrity.  Compared to the other material that has come from GONZO (Trinity Blood, Samurai 7, Blue Submarine No. 6, Chrono Crusade, Desert Punk), Origin isn't as good. It's a pity, because Origin had SO much potential. I wouldn't recommend buying it, but watch it firs t and see if you think it's worth purchasing.",1221264000,3,1699,4.76530612244898

They're right... BUT a lot of movies and anime have used this premise and not gotten the backlash Origina has. Nausicaa is the first anime I know of that had this storyline, and many animes followed suit, including even Princess Mononoke, but no one complained about that. Is Origin as good as Princess Mononoke? I'd give Origin's storyline a 3.5/5, the voice acting a 4.5 and the animation a 5/5. This has some of the best animation out there, and if you love nature and despise what humans are doing to it, Origin's plot and story will hold you from beginning to end.",1218931200,2,745,4.567164179104478

The forest-dwelling druids take their place at one pole of the dichotomy. Mechanized warmongers stand at the other pole, barely able to breath because of the smoke that belches from rows of chimneys. (Sound familiar?) A young couple in love tries to reach across that bottomless divide. (Sound familiar?) Literally - a huge chasm separates the two lands, with Neutral City perched precariously between the two. Then, one side prepare to unleash untold destruction. Well it seemed to make sense at the time.

And so on like that. As befits an animated sermon on living green (also literally, in some cases), this consists entirely of recycled plot elements, in an apparent effort to conserve our ever-dwindling supply of new ideas. That doesn't mean it's bad, just that the characters and plot will fade from memory after you've seen two or three other anime.

The good part is good, though. Scenery and backgrounds meet the highest standards. At times, I even found myself comparing them to the gorgeous hand-painted backgounds in Disney's feature films, the ones before computers took over. So, there's nothing much to object too (unless tree-huggers give you a rash). Visuals range from standard characters to exceptional backgrounds. You could do worse, and we need to watch something until Studio Ghibli sends out another masterpiece.

Neither one is close to the truth. While similar issues have been approached before, none of them have done so in such an original way as ""Origins"" has. ""Origins"" is very original. The characters are very well developed individually and are given very realistic relationships between them.

*SPOILER*!!!!!!!!
A major crux of the story is that when Agito's body has been absorbed by the tree, but his consciousness is intact on another plane, the Forest reveals to him the truth about the relationship between itself and the humans. Agito learns that the genetic admixture that gives humans extraordinary strength and eventually turns them into trees is really a two-way exchange; it also changes trees in the Forest, causing them to give birth to new humans in giant fruits. These new humans appear to be a stable product of the combined genetic material of plant and human. The Forest, seeing that Agito can possibly teach humanity that there is no need for either hostility or separation between themselves and the trees, grants him his human form back. The point here is that even the ""Neutrals"" are not truly living harmoniously with the forest; they still hold themselves apart, trying to preserve that which is in an inevitable process of transformation. Hence the veiled, cautious passive-aggression between the Forest and Neutral City, whose denizens do not understand that their days are numbered and that the strange little nymph-like creatures who speak for the Forest truly represent the future of humanity.",1187049600,103,2113,5.104046242774566

The scenery within this movie is amazing and the animation pretty darn good. Sadly, beneath the surface the end result is somewhat lackluster. As a couple of reviewers have touched upon already, it's all been done before. Throughout the entire film I could not help but think that it felt a little too much like Nausicaa, Green Legend Ran and Princess Mononoke with a splash of Akira here and there. Adding to this drawback there really is little in the way of character development and the whole thing felt like it went by a little too fast, especially in the major turning point for the main character. A scene which should have at least taken at least 5 to 10 minutes to play out ended in around a minute and a half with little emotion or explanation. By the end of it I honestly felt like I accidentally skipped a chapter of the DVD. Still, this movie does have it good points. As I mentioned, the settings and backgrounds are amazing, the characters a likeable, it has a nice amount of well executed CG and the animation in general was pretty good. Still, this movie could have seriously benefited from an addition 20 minutes of story telling.

As for the backgrounds and settings they are visually stunning however the animation itself is rather average.  The 3D scenes were gratuitous and did not lend anything to the plot or even make the movie more enjoyable because there was nothing that made those scenes special or deserving of 3D  animation.

The story itself borrows much from other anime titles and in my opinion follows the  ""American Action Movie Formula"" rather than a typical anime film plot.  For example, without giving any spoilers, the 3D ""Escape Scene"" at the end of the movie was pure ""Hollywood"" and should have been left on the cutting room floor.

Additionally the movie was extremely disjointed.  At many points I sat there asking myself questions like ""What just happened?  Why did he just do that?  Did I just sleep through a scene?""  After the movie ended I felt that there was at lest 45-60 minutes of film that had been cut out to save running time.

Lastly: what I will call ""The Doomsday Machine"" (to avoid spoilers) is so laughable its sad.  I felt embarrassed watching Origin when it was revealed.  This aspect of Origin seemed very forced or at the least unimaginative.  I could picture this being some producer's idea because he thought it would be ""cool"" rather than part of the original author's concept.

I've seen the Japanese R2 release of Origin. In terms of character designs/development and plot,this movie offers nothing new. You'll have Akira flashbacks when one of the characters starts transforming into a plant. Were it not for the unique, yet satisfying soundtrack, you could comfortably watch this on mute.

Where this movie absolutely, completely crushes is in the mix of 2D and 3D animation. The backgrounds are incredibly detailed and vibrant. The action sequences are fluid and look natural, almost lifelike. Visually, everything just seems to click. The art team obviously put a tremendous amount of work into getting this movie close to perfection. If you've seen the Korean animation flick named ""Wonderful Days"" in R2, ""Sky Blue"" in R1, it kind of has that look and feel. Offtopic: Wonderful Days also had the same problem of weak plot, but stunning visuals.

The soundtrack is pretty good, with 20th century classical music, J-pop tunes and what sounds like Eastern European-influenced chant.

GONZO is doing it big time. In addition to Origin, they also released ""Brave Story"", another 2D/3D masterpiece, in Japan last year.

There are way too many scenes, especially towards the climax, that feel shortened or hurried: Toolas side switching, the Ragna Armys side switching, the whole E.S.T.O.C. story, the climax of the fight between Agito and the bad guy, etc.  Even the central bad guy seems affected.  On the one hand he offers a reasonable sounding argument on the surface, at the beginning; on the other hand the minute Toola is out of earshot he orders Agitos execution.  All in all it has an intriguing premise, some amazing concepts, and a likable central couple you will really get a feel for, but it probably would have worked a lot better as a 12 or 13 episode TV series than as a 90 minute movie.",1525219200,,2116,5.194117647058824

If it had been a little longer, the romance a little more developed, and the plot slightly more fluid, this film would've been beyond perfection. Loved it!
