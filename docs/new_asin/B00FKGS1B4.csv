8616299,5,B00FKGS1B4,"I watched this film not knowing anything about it. From the beginning it struck me this wasn't an ordinary thriller. The film starts, introducing Helen McCrory marching through a pristine factory, shot from a distance: films are often so formulaic that the difference hits you. If this were a slick thriller there would have been quick editing, angled close ups on Helens face, her face would have been fixed on her destination, the factory and all its people would have revolved around her. This would have been the high-impact introduction of an all-knowing, all-attractive alpha wotsit, glossy, beautiful and smart. However, this film distanced her as she walked through the institution. She appeared decisive and strong, but the distance diminished her power a bit, she was a strong player, but engulfed in an unrelenting industrial setting.

This choice of depicting the scene has nothing to do with budget - the slick thriller approach being formulaically easy wouldnt have cost more. This method is defining the focus of the film and leads to the title credits where she is in a wind machine (?), showing her being pummelled by the force of wind and retaining her stance. Its beautifully done, quietly powerful. For me, I prefer the thriller aspects to be written into the character tensions and plot (rather than elaborate pyrotechnics, kickboxing, stunts and exotic locations). From the beginning the signs are all there that this is going to be a good film.

Taking the exit from the Bourne highway, the film goes its own way choosing to look at an unusual relationship butting uncomfortably with themes of Western / Islamic relations, military research and a job where the female protagonist, perhaps naively, at the beginning of the film considers her job with British Aerospace to be simply about flying (stretching credibility given her position of authority, but this is a film). Shes flying blind in this perception, in the wake of her father. Its riveting how the relationship and genders are used to explore certain issues. Helen plays a strong character, but with her own vulnerabilities and growing suspicions / paranoias her strength can come across as either a masterful arrogance or unwitting victim  all determined by a power dynamic in a relationship we cant know relying on the position of her lover, Kahil (meaning friend). This constant change in her trust of Kahil, who she wants to love is fascinating to watch as the story unfolds.

Kahil is cast perfectly. (Again, a thriller, might have had a brawnier, hero-type.) This is closer to reality, where youths are used, and he bears his scars masterfully. A truth is there on his body and presumably in the love they share, she then has the difficult job of interpreting that within wider issues. Of course Kahil could be lying, and love can blind, but Helen is in the strongest position to determine the validity of the situation, and the film makes a case that her character is astute enough to do so. Unfortunately, around the relationship, everybody, her work, her father, MI5 show the face of doubt, maybe prejudice, systematic decisions, and decisions that are made from a greater distance than Helens.

The film shows well how real lives can be affected if we don't make the effort to get to the truth and that the truth is well-hidden because of fear.

Post script: the power dynamics and gender are interesting in this film. I have doubt when film goes out of its way to have strong female characters. Of course its good to have positive roles on film. But film and reality are separate, and if film simply contrives to have a female hero (attractive and unfeasibly strong), it can appear false and be counterproductive fantasy. In this film gender issues are thoughtfully considered, both leads are strong characters. Helen is a strong female, she has worked her way to a top, creative job (with lethal implications), on par with any western male. But a lot of her strength is also granted by being in her own country, a dominant country, in a position of wealth taken for granted. She is intelligent, confident and not much shakes her. Kahil is thus put in a weaker position in many ways  job, class, alienated from home, tortured . . . Throughout the film the microscope targets scenes that progress the theme of how the two relate, showing how foggy understanding between such people from different backgrounds and cross-cultural, can lead to more and more distrust, making bonds more fragile. For instance at one point Helen offers to help Kahil, further defining their power dynamic, he thinks she means with her aero-space research, but she quickly puts this to rest and says, No, with some decorating. At every turn, Kahil is willing to accept and compromise, then along comes another issue revealing their differences.",1471219200,,4814,4.9284833538840935

At this particular time in our history this story is a healthy look at the misunderstandings between the Muslims and non-Muslims and hopefully will hold a mirror to society to reexamine prejudice and misplaced fear and suspicion. Filmed in Bristol, England by director Katarzyna Klimkiewicz and based on a screenplay by Caroline Harrington, Bruce McLeod and Naomi Wallace, it is a rather quiet but powerful indictment against suspicion as played out in a love story.

Frankie (Helen McCrory), an attractive middle-aged woman, is a successful aerospace engineer designing drones for the British military. She also lectures at Bristol University where she meets a French-Algerian student Kahil (the immensely promising French Algerian actor Najib Oudghiri) They begin an affair and Frankie swiftly becomes obsessed with her young lover but after discovering, by accident, that he is a part-time taxi driver, she realizes that she doesn't really know Kahil, his past, or where his loyalties lie. The sweet but somewhat mysterious Kahil has friends who seem to be shady characters (except for his best friend Malik - Sherif Eltayeb), his body carries the signs of torture, and he's lied about his student status. Frankie works in a sensitive field and becomes increasingly suspicious of Kahil's intentions towards her, and after MI5 informs her Kahil is a `person of interest', she finds that she can't give him up so easily and starts to spy on him. She spies through his Internet history and rifles through a bag that may or may not be his. At the same time, Frankie's father Victor (Kenneth Cranham), the police and her work superiors begin to monitor her activities. Klimkiewicz ratchets up the tension and keeps us guessing as to Kahil's allegiances, while Frankie is, in turn, betrayed. Her protective father has his own doubts about Kahil and acts on them with devastating consequences. The ending is blisteringly pathetic for all concerned.

Though there are some questionable discrepancies in the script (such as how a highflying career woman is so easily derailed, emotionally and physically, by a sexual relationship with a younger man), but the acting and direction are so fine that these minor flaws become superfluous in the end. This is first and foremost a love story set in our perilous times and offers a lesson in understanding the manifestations of suspicion on interpersonal relationships.
