1834594,4,B00008DDHJ,"My only complaint about Sistas 'N The City is that the episodes are too short.  I always enjoy this raucous take on city life from the perspective of a few black women.  They are not archetypal black women, nor does the creator try to make them so.  They are just four sistas whose worldview is featured on this hilarious DVD collection.",1050537600,2,337,4.491803278688525
1834604,4,B00008DDHJ,"Wifey and I was definitely feeling Sistas 'N the City. This is not an Academy Award feature and nor do I expect it to be. It's entertaining black female urban situations that you can relate to in your professional and social interactions. It's real, it's raw with a comedic twist. What I hate about Sistas 'N the City was the ending. The ending wouldn't be so bad if there were a sequel? Lighten up, think outside the box, and enjoy it!",1176336000,3,436,4.395061728395062
1834605,4,B00008DDHJ,this was certainly for adults only. the storyline were delivered well. very short stories though. i will keep this in my collection.,1175299200,2,132,5.045454545454546
1834606,1,B00008DDHJ,I don't even know what I did with this DVD because I purchased it a long time ago.  I do remember that it sucked.  I wish I had returned it.,1170374400,,140,3.6333333333333333
1834607,4,B00008DDHJ,"In this movie  you  get to see what some Sista's actually go thru in the ""man Game"" . It's funny , You really get to laff at you and your girls.

Each character is really one of us . Enjoy",1167868800,4,188,3.65
1834608,1,B00008DDHJ,"When I purchased this dvd, I thought this would be a good show for me and my grown daughter to watch. We only watch 5mins of this show and in the trash it went. It's just not my preference. The product details on Amazon, does say this dvd is unrated. But, here is what it doesn't say, ""contains brief nudity, strong language and adult situations and recommended for age 17+"", which is on the back on the dvd.",1156982400,4,408,4.243589743589744
1834609,2,B00008DDHJ,"I purchased the DVD and wish I had purchased the worlds funniest, longest, most boring commercials instead.  The episodes were not well thought out and extremely short, the animation was one step above stick figures and claymation, and the dialog was choppy. Each teeny, tiny episode had some sexual innuendo to it, even where there was no need or interest.  I would not recommend this to anyone, not even to borrow.  If the author should by chance read this, please recognize the average adults' attention span is longer than five minutes.  The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because I am glad someone recognizes black women would like entertainment that reminds them of self.",1154995200,6,680,4.886956521739131
1834610,5,B00008DDHJ,I could relate to some of the issues!! It was GREAT,1128038400,3,51,3.727272727272727
1834611,4,B00008DDHJ,"BIG UPs 2 TINA ANDREWS FOR CREATING SISTAS N' THE CITY IN ANIMATION FORM! EXCELLENT CHOICE OF CAST MEMBERS, ESPECIALLY WITH MEDUSA & DAWN LEWIS. MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT WITH S.N.T.C & TINA ANDREWS IS THAT SHE CHOSE NOT 2 MAKE IT AT LEAST 1 HOUR LONG?... IT WAS FAR TOO BRIEF TO BE A COMPLETE MOVIE, I COULD OVERSTAND IF IT WAS A TV SERIES BEING THAT SHORT! TINA S.N.T.C WAS FAR TOO GOOD 4 YOU JUST 2 TEASE US LIKE THAT!! TINA ANDREWS'

COMMENTARY IN THE SPECIAL FEATURES WAS VITAL BECAUSE SHE TOLD WHY SHE CHOSE 2 CREATE S.N.T.C... NOT THAT TINA WAS COPYING BUT

""SISTAS N' THE CITY"" WAS INSPIRED BY sex in the city... TINA

ELOQUENTLY STATED THAT ""SHE COULD NOT FATHOM HOW THOSE White CHICKS FROM sex in the city COULD LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY & NOT HAVE ANY FRIENDS OF ""ETHNICITY"" TINA ANDREWS & MANY OTHERS

FIND THAT VERY ODD""!!!! SO PEOPLE THAT'S WHEN SISTAS N' THE CITY

WAS BORN & I'M PLEASED WITH THE CONCEPT! THE ISSUE THAT THOSE SISTAS FACED WERE RELEVENT, BECAUSE WE HAVE DIFFERENT RACES THAT ARE ""BI-RACIAL"" WHICH I FIND ""ASSININE""... WE ALSO HAVE 2 LOVE WHO & WHAT WE ARE ""HOW WILL YOU EVER LOVE ANOTHER""(YOU KNOW)? THEN YOU HAVE SOME RICH PEOPLE WHOM I LIKE 2 REFER 2 AS ""RICH ZOMBIES"", WHO BELIEVES THAT THEY'RE BETTER THAN GOD'S PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THEY'RE COLOR SKIN OR THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY! SO THEY'LL LOOK AT OTHERS AS IF THEY ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH! EVERY PERSON IS MADE OF FLESH, BLOOD & BONES WE ALL ARE!!!! 1 DAY WE EACH WILL BE ""JUDGE BY THE DIVINE 1 ""GOD""!!!

THE SOUNDTRACK IS A CLASSIC...TRACKS CREATED BY MEDUSA (THE LYRICAL SEDUCER FROM THE MOVIE ""Stranger Inside"")! THE MORAL IS BE YOURSELF, KNOW YOURSELF & MOST OF ALL LOVE YOURSELF!!

  1 LOVE",1117238400,7,1672,4.35048231511254
1834612,4,B00008DDHJ,"a tad more brash than Girlfriends.  This is a great formula, if only it was longer; even if each episode was 15 min. as oppose to 5 min. A couple of years ago I enjoyed viewing Sista 'N the City on-line. I am most happy now to see just how far the creators have expanded.  Showtime playing this right after Soul Food is great timing for those who never saw these ""shortakes"" before.
Although each Sista brings here own brand of politics to the table (man problems, career issues, family drama, etc.) they are always there for each other in the end.  Even at 5 min. a piece, you will definitely laugh each time!!  :-)",1084838400,8,616,4.3304347826086955
1834613,5,B00008DDHJ,"I first watched the episodes on urbanentertainment.com. And fell in love with them. A different view of life in the city as seen through the eyes of Black Women. Very Sexy, Funny, and a load of fun to watch. The only 2 gripes I have is that I wish the episodes were a lot longer. And I wish they would have included more episodes than the ones you had seen already from the website.",1053302400,4,382,4.175675675675675

7981447,4,B00008DDHJ,"I didn't expect this to mirror the popular HBO show and I am glad it didn't.  I truly enjoyed it and am glad I purchased it.  It's a nice representation of the different genres of black women other than the run-of-the-mill mainstream media representations.  The commentary in the extras was equally good and the Exec. Producer, Tina Andrews, was an actress that I remember from ""Good Times"".  It was also interesting to know that one of the women in the dialogue at the end was the originator of the ever popular ""Cheetah Girls"".",1262304000,,529,4.655913978494624
7981448,5,B00008DDHJ,NIce short stories but the animation isn't the greatest but overall DVD is pretty good.,1252886400,,87,4.866666666666666
7981449,5,B00008DDHJ,FOR ADULT'S BECAUSE THESE SISTA'S ONLY LOOK LIKE CARTOON'S BUT THEY WILL ENTERTAIN YOU FROM START TO FINISH! NICE DVD CHOICE GIVE IT A TRY.,1252713600,,139,4.6

excellent delivery serviced",1207353600,,80,4.785714285714286
7981451,1,B00008DDHJ,I bought this and after seeing it threw it in the garbage. This is an adult cartoon that is a waste of film. The actual cartoons are horrible. The plot is stupid.,1199750400,,162,4.09375
7981452,2,B00008DDHJ,"I BROUGHT THIS DVD, BECAUSE IM A HUGE FAN OF SEX IN THE CITY. SO WHEN I SAW THEY HAD A CARTOON VERSION WITH BLACK SISTAS I WANTED TO CHECK IT OUT.  I READ THE OTHER REVIEWS AND SINCE PEOPLE SAID IT WAS GOOD, I BROUGHT IT.  BOY WAS I DISAPPOINTED.  THIS DVD SUCKS BECAUSE FIRST THING,ITS DONE IN EPISODES THAT ARE LIKE 5-7 MINUTES LONG.  AND ONCE YOU START GETTING INTO AN EPISODE IT ENDS AND THEN THE ANNOYING SONG ""DONT HATE ME CUZ IM ALL THAT"" COMES ON.  ITS OKAY AFTER THE FIRST COUPLES OF EPISODES, BUT AFTER A WHILE ITS LIKE GIVE ME A BREAK! IT ALSO SUCK BECAUSE JUST WHEN YOU START TO GET INTO THE DVD IT ENDS!!!! I WOULD NOT RECOMMENED THIS DVD.  IF YOU CAN CATCH THE EPISODES FOR FREE THEN HEY, BUT IF NOT SAVE YO MONEY!",1199232000,,728,3.986206896551724
7981453,4,B00008DDHJ,"Very funny episodes, but definitely not for viewing by young children.  The only complaint is that the shows are darn TOO SHORT!!  Just as you are beginning to enjoy the storyline, its over.",1178496000,3,190,4.7272727272727275
