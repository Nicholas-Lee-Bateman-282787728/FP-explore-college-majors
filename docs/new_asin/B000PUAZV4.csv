8193318,5,B000PUAZV4,"I bought it with some skepticism initially, but was convinced after looking at the excellent reviews from periodicals, TV. I was certainly glad I bought this DVD and getting ready to order others in the series. My 4 year old loves the DVD and it has been 100% educational beyond my expectations along-with being fun. Good combination. I would rate it higher any day, than those other huge corp branded child videos. Go for it!",1247529600,,426,4.693333333333333
8193319,2,B000PUAZV4,Looks like it was made in someone's house - not preofessionally done -- I think it's a little creepy the way the characters look and act -- definitely wish I did not purchase this -- but it seems to keep my 3 year olds attention.,1202169600,,229,4.111111111111111
