1638282,5,B00005O0SO,"This film was first screened at The Hampton's International Film Festival, where I saw it, and right there and then I fell in love with it. Not only is the story beautifully written and carried out, but the music, the landscapes and the actors are especially touching, and add an entire ""layer"" to the film altogether. The two actors that really stood out were Aidan Quinn and the ever so fabulous Janet McTeer and her amazing performance. I would highly recommend this film, and it is definitley a must see!",998611200,7,508,4.655555555555556

1638287,1,B00005O0SO,"I would give it zero stars if allowed. The introduction of the lesbian scene, and loose morals of the main character made this unwatchable. Parents beware. So glad I didn't use this for the family night. Why were they not up front about this? it looks like it should be family friendly, it is really awful.",1514851200,,306,4.482142857142857

1638289,5,B00005O0SO,"I enjoyed this, much more than I thought I would, although to me, plot-wise it felt a bit uneven. I admit, I was a bit on the fence, after seeing some of the reviews for this movie, but as someone who loves the songs which feature heavily in the plot, I decided to give it a go.. And I loved it! Even if they did miss the boat when it came to the accompanying soundtrack-which I wish it had been performed as it was in the film, but that's another review, altogether. Nevertheless, I absolutely wouldn't hesitate to recommend this one.",1511740800,,535,4.306930693069307

1638307,5,B00005O0SO,"I saw this movie in the theater when it was first released.  I loved it then, and seeing it again on Amazon Video, I appreciated it even more.

I am not into country music or bluegrass or anything like that, but I was totally wrapped up in the story and the terrific performances, and I loved the music in context.

This is a beautifully told story, with complex and compelling characters.  It is deeply moving and very enjoyable.

I have to mention by name Janet McTeer, Jane Adams, E. Katherine Kerr, Emmy Rossum, Pat Carroll and Aidan Quin.  Ill stop there, because otherwise, Ill feel compelled to name the entire cast, as each character is perfect.  Many thanks to writer/director Maggie Greenwald for this magical movie.",1497398400,3,726,4.714285714285714

1638343,5,B00005O0SO,"I purchased this on a friend's recommendation, thoroughly expecting to not be excited about it. Once Lily leaves the city and begins the trek up the mountain, I was HOOKED!! I grew up with mountain folk music all around me, and was forced to listen/learn it, causing me to ignore this portion of the spectrum of musicology for many of my almost 60 years. I was able to thoroughly embrace the music and the story line, and deeply appreciate the side-lessons about differences in society that were sprinkled throughout this movie. It has earned an A++++ from me. I do not watch much in the way of TV or movies (I did not have any TV for 17 years, so this is all new to me), but this is definitely added to my re-watch stack.

As for all of the earlier comments (from 4+ years ago) regarding the quality of the DVD itself: the manufacturer must have listened as I had no problems at all with my copy.",1484179200,,897,4.339285714285714

This is the story of a female musicologist, who hires assistants to help her get recording devices down into the back hills of Appalachia after she made an important discovery about the songs that the Appalachian people, while visiting her little sister, a school teacher. Think ""female Alan Lomax."" The conditions that her bulky, expensive, recording equipment had to be dragged through was treacherous, if not impassable.

The music is wonderful (we also have the cd of the movie score) and the music adds so much to the story line especially if you like bluegrass/folk genre.  The movie takes place in the early 1900's and is the story of a woman passed over for a full professorship in musicology leaving her position at the university and going to the hill country to record and script the music that has been passed down through hill country families for generations.  The movie also does a wonderful job reflecting on the relationships of the characters.

1638456,5,B00005O0SO,"Loved this movie in so many ways but, as a native of the area this was filmed in and is supposed to be about, I found that it tended to stereotype mountain folk as ignorant much like most other films of its type. Aidan Quinn and Janet McTeer did a superb job of acting and Emmy Rossum was also wonderful. The music of Appalachia has always been one of its treasures and that was much of the appeal in this movie. Some parts, such as when a panther was supposedly chasing Janet McTeer's character were definitely pure Hollywood and laughable. Beautiful scenery, lovely real Appalachian music. The paintings that were shown were actually done by an artist from around Bryson City, NC, displaying the talent that is very plentiful among mountain people. The remoteness of the area in the time period of the film is very realistically portrayed, which is why the people were wary of strangers, not because they were innately hostile to outsiders as is suggested in the film. Overall a good movie with these few exceptions.",1451779200,,1018,4.692737430167598

1638459,1,B00005O0SO,"The idea behind this story is interesting and the music history interesting, but the story itself is very ugly. It deals with an immoral main character, so much so that her character is sickening offensive. Then, if that were not enough, there is homosexuality portrayed, which personally offends me. If it doesn't offend anyone else that is fine, BUT there should be a better description of this movie, specifying that it may be offensive to viewers and then detailing the sexuality showed. That way I would have had a choice and not wasted my money on this trashy movie, which went right into the garbage can.",1449014400,4,611,4.773584905660377

This movie was a good mix of factual history together with enough theatrics to make it fun as well as educating to watch.  We would have liked to see more coverage of the mountain dulcimer and how it's influence as another truly American instrument  in that era added to the nostalgic craving of the European immigrants longing for the characteristic ""Mountain Minor"" drones that the vocalists in this movie helped preserve.

Lillian Penleric, an untraditional woman and scholar for her times, learns a great deal more about the unique heritage, independence and sense of community shared by the mountain folk she interviews.

1638550,3,B00005O0SO,"The movie would have been better if they had stuck to the story of how ballads were originally 'caught' from the mountain people of Appalachia who kept them alive after much of Europe lost them. The main characters were fully engaged in that part of the story,  and Emmy Rossum's first role is a STELLAR one as the young mountain girl who helps 'catch' the songs she grew up with. If only some of the rarer songs had been featured in their full length!
SPOILER ALERT!
As I play and research many of the collected ballads myself, biggest fault of the movie,in my opinion, is  a subplot homosexual relationship between two characters-please don't misunderstand-I am not averse to homosexuality-BUT that subplot is presented as a 21st century politically correct effort to preach tolerance and it is not correct for the time period in which the song-catcher is set.
That said-watch, enjoy, and then GO FIND THOSE BALLADS!",1421193600,2,918,4.840764331210191
1638551,1,B00005O0SO,"This movie was such a disappointment. This woman was definitely NOT a songcatcher. She did fine when everything went well, but when faced with a devastating loss, she abandoned the project and took an easy (and profitable) way out.

We can deal w/ some lame acting, but when an orphan girl has been seduced into a lesbian affair w/ an older woman who should be a motherly figure, that is one of the most heinous offenses, and abuse of a child's desire to please a parent figure that I can imagine-  how very corrupt!

Pure un-adulterated Appalachian mountain music as performed by the very finest performers in this genre.
It is indeed a rare pleasure to see as well as to hear performers such as Iris DeMent in their element!
Unfortunately the plot of a PhD. college professor falling for a whisky-swilling mountain man is not only totally unbelievable but inconceivable.
In addition the performance given by lead actress, Janet McTeer as Professor Penleric is wooden. How sad.
But surprisingly, the most awesome performance comes from Pat Carroll.
Yes!

Thoroughly enjoyed the film and particularly like the music throughout.  Prompted me to order the cd from the film and found a fabulous song on it (""When Love Is New"") done by Dolly Parton and Emmy Rossum.  As ""Barbara Allen"" has always been a huge favorite of ours, we had to have the cd to hear Emmylou Harris do her version of it.  However, what we found very strange was in the last scenes of the movie where Emmylou does this song, in one of the special cuts part it has Dolly Parton doing Barbara Allen.  Simply wonderful!!  But, I forget to rate the movie.  It was very well done, love the new-to-us lead actress, Aiden Quinn never disappoints, and all of the other parts were performed superbly.

I love the characters and the music, which is the real star of this movie.  The story is very basic. There are oddities, such as the main woman character who is a PhD in music and teaches at a college in the early 1900s and then all of the ""mountain people"".  Because I have always lived in Missouri with the Ozark Mountains and the stories in literature about these people, I am also fascinated with stories about the Appalachian Mountains and people. If for no other reason, you should see this movie for Pat Carroll's character. If you don't remember her, she was in many TV shows back in the 60s and 70s, including the movie ""Cinderella"" with Leslie Ann Warren as the title character. Pat was one of the stepsisters. She sings a really funny song called ""Single Girl"" to a woman who just had a baby and had a wandering husband. Great characters, beautiful setting, and wonderful music.

The story line unfolds  where it has beauty,music,quaint school house in the middle of Appalachia and suddenly the Professor sister opens the bed room door of her sister who teaches in the mountains and who is she with,but the other woman teacher and they are obviously doing a little hanky panky. Give me a break. Then amid the lovely songs being song and the mountains a glow in sun filled mist, picnic time comes up. The Professor sister and the good looking mountain man and the  2 mountain teachers go for a picnic. The 2 teachers frolic in the creek,comment they are going for a walk in the woods and surprise!!! they begin to undress and start kissing and a young ruffin walks and comes up on them,and oh oh they are getting caught. Now I ask you,just where in the teeniest print on the back jacket of the dvd does it mention any of this,but sexual. Nor was  homosexual  mentioned anywhere in the description of the movie. My gosh,I purchased this as a family movie for my family,you know as grandkids as well. PG 13 now includes lesbians necking and array of undress? Just great. I am thoroughly disgusted that this is not even mentioned in the reviews or even hinted at. I do not believe for a second in the backwoods,2 christian teachers necked up a storm in the 1800's.  First cousins,male and female maybe....but the movie went from something that could have been true class to a piece of garbage that was full of bologna with lovely songs.

She and her good friend are teachers who have built a wonderful school for a very poor community.  It's a community that a large coal mining company is trying to take over by buying all the farms unfairly.  You uncover by chance a young lady who sings beautiful old hymns from England and you find out many in the small community sing.

It had a great story line and enough unexpected twists to keep the viewer engrossed.  Though I was born and raised in a fairly large city in Kentucky, Lexington, my father was born and raised in eastern Kentucky, within the Appalachian Mountains.  So, the Appalachian Mountains and the people of those mountains have always held a special place in my heart and soul.  Songcatcher is about the people of the Appalachian Mountains, their music, their way of life in the early 1900s, and the woman who set out to preserve their songs.  Their music told the stories of their lives.  It was an oral history, most of which had never been written down but passed on through the generations as they sat on front porches, worked, worshiped, and danced.  Much of their music had been brought here by their Irish and Scottish ancestors.  I grew up listening to those songs at my grandmother's house.  She loved Bluegrass Gospel music and those songs take me back.

I believe Songcatcher accurately depicts the challenges and inequalities women and mountain people faced during that era.  Though there was a lot of poverty in the mountains, the people had a great pride in their heritage and were tenacious in keeping their lifestyle intact and separate from the world, which the movie captures and conveys well.

The day after we saw this movie, my husband mentioned it to me a few times.  We agreed that we would watch it again someday.and that it was the best movie we'd seen in quite awhile.",1363219200,,1609,4.720430107526882

sit down and we started the movie over again, so he could see and hear the wonderful performances!  OH MY GOSH!!  We only skipped a few parts of the movie, searching for the mountain musicians and their many performances, but he got to see most of the movie and I got to watch it OVER AGAIN immediately!

Personally, I think Netflix is NUTS!  They rated Song Catcher as a 3+-star movie. Who are they kidding?  If it were me, I'd rate the storyline as at least a 4+ and the music as a 5!

1638720,5,B00005O0SO,"I have used this movie for student viewing in American Music and World Music (North America) undergraduate classes. It provides an excellent introduction to the problems that early ethnographers encountered in working with informants in the Appalachian mountains. Aside from the mountaineers' (justified) suspicion of outsiders, the scholars themselves had to grapple fiercely with their own class-based prejudices, not to mention the rapacious designs of the coal company owners, ""establishment"" religious organizations, and more. (That such entities often considered themselves the natural allies of the ethnographers, and expected reciprocal recognition for it, created yet another obstacle for serious, unbiased research.)

All of this is subtly but accurately put forth in the movie, which doesn't prevent it from also containing GREAT MUSIC and a reasonably accurate view of Appalachian ""hill"" life at the turn of the previous century.

I hope this doesn't make it sound too much like a sociological tract, because it's also a very entertaining and moving human drama, and a well-made film.",1287619200,2,1096,5.676829268292683

1638740,4,B00005O0SO,"This review is being used to comment on both the soundtrack CD and movie DVD.

In a recent CD review of the music from the now mountain music movie classic, George Clooney's ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"", I mentioned in passing that the movie from which the CD under review is taken was also a contributing factor to the revival of interest in the mountain music genre. I also noted there that the CD and film were worthy of a separate review of their own. I make amends here and I think that this settles all debts.

That said, the following excerpt from that above-mentioned review can be used here to set the tone for a look at this ""Songcatcher"" (and a couple of words on the movie, as postscript) here:

""Sometimes a revival of a musical form, like the ""talking blues"", that highlighted the urban folk revival of the early 1960's is driven by a social need. In that case it was to provide a format for the ""glad tidings"" that a new political and social movement was a-bornin'. In the case of the revival several years ago of what is called ""mountain music"" it was the films ""The Song Catcher"" and, more importantly, the very popular movie starring George Clooney, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"". The CD under review is a compilation of music from that movie, a not unnatural tie-in in the modern entertainment business. The movie deserves a separate review, however, this CD can stand on its own as a very nice cross section of ""mountain music"", some familiar most not so.

Without straining credulity ""mountain music"" is the music of the simple folk of Appalachia, those who worked hard in the coal mines, on the hard scrabble farms and in the isolated mills of the region. This was their Saturday night entertainment and with the advent of radio was a unifying cultural experience. The songs ""speak"" of hard and lonely lives, the beauty of the then pristine countryside, the usual vagaries of love and lost and the mysterious ways of a very personal, if arbitrary, god. Throw in a few upbeat tunes reflecting the love of ""corn"" liquor, women and the sometimes funny side of coping with life's trials and tribulations and you have the mountain version of the folk experience. Sound familiar? Sure it does, except, it is done with simple guitar, a blazing fiddle and, hopefully, a full-bodied mandolin.""

With that in mind there only remains the need to highlight some of the better efforts here. For starters, apparently, I knew the work of Iris Dement long before I consciously knew her work. I have mentioned in reviews of her work that I had become enamored of her music through her rendition of ""Jimmy Rodgers Going Home"" on a Greg Brown (now her husband) tribute CD. From the copyright date here (and on Ralph Stanley's ""Clinch Mountain Sweethearts"" where she also does a couple of tracks) that is now incorrect. What is not wrong is that her lyrics and vocal range have led me to dub her my ""Internet Sweetheart"" (Sorry, Greg). And she does not fail here on the traditional ""Pretty Saro"". Needless to say no country music/folk music/ folk rock music presentation of any kind is complete these days without a contribution form Emmylou Harris. Here she does a split version of the traditional Child Ballad ""Barbara Allen"". Of course, when one talks of mountain music in its 20th century incarnation then the name The Carter Family is front and center. Thus, naturally, one of the representatives from that extended clan, Roseanne Cash, is a welcome addition here doing the old traditional ""Fair And Tender Ladies"" (a version of which that I first heard way back in the early 1960's done by Dave Van Ronk). Finally, of necessity again, no ""hard"" mountain music themed production can be complete without a piece from Hazel Dickens who, as a woman of those mountains, has probably done more to popularize this art form than anyone else. So listen up to a genuine piece of Americana.

Note: Although I am mainly interested in the `Songcatcher"" film for its soundtrack the movie itself is worth seeing. The plot line revolves around an English woman's search for authentic American music from the mountains (naturally enough as much of the music crossed over from the British Isles). Sound familiar? Along the way she learns, perhaps more than she wants to know, about this milieu as she collects her music. Naturally, in such a commercial effort there s a little love interest thrown in with a real live mountain man musician wary of ""city ways"" from his own earlier experiences.  Other themes touched upon, although in some cases obliquely, are the isolation of rural life, that just- mentioned conflict between rural and city values, religious fundamentalism and the, seemingly obligatory, nod to same sex issues (here, in a dramatically compelling way, lesbianism and the local reaction to it) that feature in many modern movies. Put the music and those themes together and you have a passable couple of hours. If you have to choose though, get the CD.",1244419200,,4959,4.766006984866124

It's a good story, well told...and the only nit I will pick happens late in the movie--when an ongoing lesbian relationship is discovered (a ""local"" sees the women kissing passionately).  The relationship had already been strongly hinted-at, so the ""discovery"" seemed gratuitous.  And I have read criticism of the story's opening sequence--and the event that sets the table for the whole film:  A female college professor being denied tenure, and resigning, to visit her sister who runs a school in the Appalachian mountains.  It is argued that a female would never have been considered for tenure in the early part of the 20th century.  But rather than debate that, I will only remind of the concept of ""willing suspension of disbelief""...an aesthetic theory coined by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1817.

Also the incredible music, which features classic folk songs such as ""Barbara Allen"" and cameo performances by Taj Mahal and Iris Dement. But the film's subplots, particularly the lesbian relationship between Elna and an older woman named Harriet as well as the unlikely romance between the intellectual, artistocratic Lily and the hard drinking, hillbilly Tom, seem extremely forced and unrealistic considering the historical and regional context of the film. Also the secondary characters lack nuance and complexity, typically shown as either having hearts of gold, like sweet, innocent Deladis, or as violent, intolerant brutes, such as Deladis' boyfriend Fate.

I have family roots going back to the early 1800's in the mountains of North Carolina and can promise you that this is definitely a simplified Hollywood version of Southern mountain life rather than a realistic portrayal of this region and it's people in the early 1900's. Still I enjoyed the music and the natural scenery so much that I would recommend it to those who likewise enjoy these two extraordinary aspects of  traditional Southern mountain culture.",1204848000,3,1783,5.3120567375886525

The lesbian sub-plot especially seemed odd.  And the romantic interest between Quinn and McTeer seems to start abruptly and seems unlikely to occur (outside a movie).
The scenes and characters do seem to come honestly from the Appalachian hills though.  These are people I've met and known in my youth.  I would recommend the movie for those interested in Appalachia before the tourists took over, as well as those who are interested in the folk music that lived (lives?) there.",1197072000,2,771,4.8396946564885495

1638762,4,B00005O0SO,"Maggie Greenwald who directed ""Get a Clue"" with Lindsey Lohan for Disney cable directed this picture.  Made in 2000, it did not result in a huge break for her into larger features.  Janet McTeer was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for ""Tumbleweeds"" in 1999, and then took this role as Dr. Lily Penleric.  In 1910, Penleric was an anomaly, an independent educated woman.  In her era, the glass ceiling was made of opaque colored glass; and she could not get a promotion at her university into tenured faculty.  They would bring a man from outside the college so they did not have to promote her.  In what was a less than progressive note, the only vote she could get was by having an extra-marital affair with dumpy professor.  As a doctor of music who is fascinated with folk songs, her name ""Penleric"" sounds appropriate like ""pen lyric"" or someone who writes down songs.  She heads to the mountains to stay with her sister, Elna Penleric.  Elna is teaching school with another teacher.  I'd have to watch the film again to be 100% sure, but I think the character is Harriet Tolliver played by E. Katharine Kerr.  While the senior teacher is older than Elna, she apparently has charms that lead Elna played by Jane Adams into a secretive lesbian relationship.  Ironically, McTeer's Lily Penleric seems more masculine than her sister.  However, Lily falls for mountain man Tom Bledsoe played by Aiden Quinn.  Bledsoe has outlived two wives and becomes intrigued by Penleric after initially disliking her. Veteran actress Pat Carroll plays Viney Butler who knows a lot of folk songs that have been passed down from previous generations.  Carroll received a Best Supporting Actress nomination from the Independent Spirit Awards for her role.  Deladis Slocumb is played by the tuneful newcomer Emmy Rossum who sings sweetly and knows many songs she learned from her family.  The evil coal man Earl Giddens who tries to scoop up the mountain farms for coal mining is played by David Patrick Kelly with a sniveling arrogance that makes him fun to dislike.  Michael Harding plays Reese Kincaid who two-times his pregnant wife with the wrong mountain mistress and winds up the film with a big bang.  Small cameo roles are played by musicians Taj Mahal and Iris DeMent who play and sing with gusto.  This film won the Jury Prize from Sundance Film Festival for Best Ensemble Performance.  The cinematography is breathtaking and the film reflects values of love, loyalty, respect and abiding friendship that make it overall a heartwarming experience.

1638776,2,B00005O0SO,"There are a number of problems with this piece.  First, it is not a movie.  It is a recital strung together with the flimsiest of narratives.  Naturally, this will please people who want a recital of this particular music.

Second, the narrative material is almost solely concerned with feminism: lesbianism, the single independent woman, childbirth, mistreated wives, drunken husbands, too many children, etc.

The view of the mountain people is totally from the POV of an outsider, not merely the main character (who IS an outsider) but the filmmaker.  It's not that the view of mountain people is wholly negative.  It isn't.  But there is no understanding of these people.  The main character does not come to an understanding of them, nor do we, the audience.

That she would give up her work and her career at the end strains credibility, especially when an eminent scholar comes to assist her and she is thus guaranteed success as well as advancement in her career.

Finally, what has she got at the end?  What and who is the Aidan Quinn character?  And what does she see in him?  We haven't a clue (except that he IS Aidan Quinn and is cute).

But then, we should have guessed that this would be a dud from the fact that it won a prize at the Sundance Film Festival.  Once again, the name Sundance should be a red flag of warning to all who like a good movie and are unimpressed by the self-appointed arbiters of taste who run Sundance.

Some things that ruined it for me:

The surest sign of a bush-league academic is to insist on being called ""doctor"".  Poor Lily did this over and over in the script. What was the problem? Did the screenwriter not do his/her homework, or were we supposed to think that perhaps Lily didn't deserve the promotion? The former seems more likely to me.

Lily was having an affair with one of her colleagues?  Well, certainly this happens, but it is not consistent with her character's other traits, unless as I wondered above, the screenwriter is trying to tell us that she isn't as independent and capable as she thinks she is.  I think it was just a bad idea that didn't get cut.

Is it really believable that Lily's sister would not have told a dear sister who studies ballads that her mountain girl assistant sings them.  I doubt it.

Would Lily really run through the woods tearing off her clothes in response to a superstition, or was this an excuse to have her uncorseted in preparation for the big sex scene?  I think the latter.

This movie deserved a more believable screenplay.",1183852800,16,1315,4.645021645021645

1638785,3,B00005O0SO,"Songcatcher (Maggie Greewnwald, 2000)

I am usually a big fan of just about anything IFC Films releases, but for some reason I could never put my finger on, I always shied away from Songcatcher, despite being a fan (and, casually, a student) of Mr. Child and his wonderful work collecting hundreds of ballads and their almost endless variations. Turns out I actually didn't have all that much to regret.

Songcatcher will likely be best remembered for being the movie that introduced rising star Emmy Rossum to the big screen. Rossum plays Deladis Slocumb, an Appalachian schoolgirl who knows how to sing. But I get ahead of myself. The story centers around Lily Penleric (Waking the Dead's Janet McTeer), a musicologist from the east coast who, disillusioned with her suffocating relationship with a married man, goes to visit her sister Elena (Wonder Boys' Jane Adams), a schoolteacher in the wilds of Appalachia. She lives at the town's school with Harriet (Next Stop Wonderland's Kaetherine Kerr), the other schoolteacher, and Deladis. One evening, Deladis absentmindedly begins singing a tune that Lily recognizes as a variation on a Scots ballad, and she quickly comes to realize that the Appalachians have a tradition of ballad variants as yet uncharted. A fine summer project for a young academic who keeps getting passed over for promotion, eh?

And if the film had stayed this simple, it would have been a fine one. But, of course, it doesn't; the movie was marketed as a love story, and a love story it is, however shoehorned-in that love story seems. And it's a tried old thing, it is, with a plot so fresh it's only be used in a select few dozen thousand Harlequin romances. Lily meets up with Tom (Aidan Quinn), a local guitarist who thinks her work is going to demean the music, and the people, of the mountains. But, needless to say, he's a man, and she's a woman, and therefore there must be a romance. It's extraneous, and rather silly, and gets in the way of the ballads. Still, if you're a fan of Child and his good work, you'll get at least something out of this. ** ",1167782400,9,2088,4.743801652892562

These ballads had been brought by the townspeople's immigrant families and handed down by mountain folk from one generation to another.

1638794,4,B00005O0SO,"Songcatcher is an enchanting film of incredible sights and sounds. Filmed on location in Appalachia, it captures the stunning, harsh beauty of the mountain landscape, while serenading us with the raw, powerful, amazing music that was preserved for generations in those mountains. It is the cinematography and soundtrack that are the true stars of this film, making the story and actors almost superfluous.

That's not to say that there aren't some fine performances in Songcatcher. Janet McTeer convincingly plays ethnomusicologist Dr. Lily Penleric as the uptight outlander who is captured by the purity of the mountain songs. Pat Carroll delivers the films stand-out performance with her brilliant portrayal of Viney Butler, the tough, wise, resourceful mountain grandma who befriends Dr. Penleric, and who represents the heart of the mountain culture.

Unfortunately, Songcatcher's story contains some glaring anachronisms which played havoc with my suspension of disbelief, and served as pesky distractions from this otherwise superb film. Dr. Penleric is launched into her mountain journey when she is unfairly denied a promotion to full professor, but in the world of 1907, as a woman, she would not have been any kind of professor at a prestigious university. (This anachronism is even acknowledge in the commentary track on the DVD,) The second anachronism involves the secret lesbian affair of Lily's sister, Eleanor (Jane Adams). While I have no doubt that such relationships happened in 1907,  Eleanor's easy and guilt free attitude about it has more in common with our contemporary culture, and rings false for the moralizing Edwardian age of the first decade of the 20th century. In both cases, these anachronisms are crucial to moving the story, and are not easily ignored.

Despite the problems of the story, this is still an excellent film. It expertly captures the unique mountain culture, as well as offering a visual and auditory feast for the senses. Fans of old time Appalachian music should consider Songcatcher mandatory viewing, and even those without a particular interest in the subject may find themselves swept up by the magic of these songs.

SONGCATCHER is an awesome film more people need to see.

Note to the reviewer who was worried about a misinterpretation of ""O Death:"" as a first time watcher (and listener: I've never heard the song before), my impression of the song matched yours.  I didn't notice the movie slanting its meaning.",1106352000,68,781,4.698529411764706
1638801,5,B00005O0SO,"Traditional folk ballads like you've never heard them performed before, all set amid the hollers and valleys and mountains of Appalachia. Janet McTeer, she of the luminous eyes, plays Dr. Lily Penleric, an academic in musicology who, when she is passed over yet again for full professorship in favor of a man, hies herself off to visit her sister at the tiny rural school she runs in the boondocks. Many issues are addressed in this stunning movie of surprising depth: racism, tolerance, lesbianism, clashing cultures, big business, repression, women's lot, etc.

In addition to McTeer, the marvelous Pat Carroll plays a grannie midwife who is a repository for a bazillion ""songs,"" Aidan Quinn plays the love interest who is the bridge between the hill people and the ""outsiders,"" and lovely Emmy Rossum, who has grown up a bit since this movie was filmed and now has the lead in Phantom of the Opera.

1638807,3,B00005O0SO,"OK, so maybe it's not THAT bad.  Still, I was so disappointed by the second half of this film that I can't find a four-star rating in me.
It's a gorgeous film set in the Appalachian Mountains, an early 20th century story of a highly intelligent lady musicologist who is obsessed with capturing the history of the folk music of the British Isles.  When she hits the glass ceiling of her day, her college passing her over yet again for a man in spite of her extreme qualification, she heads for the hills.  Literally.
Her younger sister runs a school in the mountains among that most derided minority, the hillbillies (or, more properly, ""mountain folk"").  Big kudos to this film for playing more or less fair with the poor people of the mountains, with few caricatures and mostly just good-hearted people who distrust ""the world beyond.""  Here the good doctor finds a wealth of old British folk music that has been handed down from generation to generation, as the ancestors of these folk came from the islands themselves.
""Songcatcher"" is well worth seeing, due to its brilliant handling of its unique subject matter.  It is also a cautionary tale for filmmakers who think they have to throw too much into their story.  It could be said that the multiple tragedies in this film are a way of thematically representing the repetitive theme of tragedies in the old folk music the doctor is collecting, but it's overkill, pure and simple, and further ruins such effect with a silly ending.  I'm glad I saw it, but would prefer to have an edited version featuring only the musical performances, which are stunning.
There is a lot to love about ""Songcatcher.""  It's a treasure trove for an education in how music was developed in those pre-commercial days, and the lengths to which its devotees had to go for its preservation.  If you love any kind of music, you owe a big debt of gratitude to people like this.  It is mesmerizing to see the mountain people performing the music of their heritage in its natural setting.
Beyond that, it's a typical formula story, and that's what leaves me cold about this confused film.  Formula element 1:  The Outsider who learns to communicate with and appreciate a society in which she is initially very uncomfortable, while said society learns to deal with her as well.  Some will not accept her, but she wins most of them over.  Formula element 2:  A forbidden romance causes serious unrest and, ultimately, tragedy.  There are actually two such story lines in this film.  Formula element 3:  An ambitious woman, living in less rational times, deals with the frustration of being thwarted in her dreams.  Formula element 4:  The happy ending you could see coming a mile off.
I really hate that the filmmakers felt they had to throw so many elements into what could have been an excellent little film.  Most unsettling is that they set up several confrontations that all reach a climax within a minute or two of each other, completely fouling up the otherwise nice pace they had set to that point in the film's final half-hour.",1090022400,8,3060,4.72316384180791
1638808,4,B00005O0SO,"Definitely a mixed bag of emotions in this one! Heart-stopping American roots music set in a mish-mash of minor story lines, most of which detract from the overall quality or merely add stereotypes to a movie that seems that it really wants to contradict those very stereotypes.  First the good stuff.  This is a story loosely based on the life of Olive Dame Campbell came to the mountains and found the treasure of music that make up the very life of these people.  She collected the music while it was still raw and founded the roots of country and folk music.  Her legacy lives on today at the Folk School ([...]) in North Carolina.  The movie features the wonderful simple music of the Scottish and Irish ballads (""love songs"") handed down from mother to daughter to granddaughter in these mountains.  The acapella voice of Emmy Rossum, operatically trained, with capture your heart immediately and transport you through this musical journey.  Pat Carroll as the mountain matriarch is the perfect match for the grandmother we remember singing to us as children, bringing a non-musical voice but a passion to the songs.  Appearances from Iris Dement and Taj Mahal and others continue to provide the authenticity to the music.
But the story lines, including a lesbian relationship, a stereotypical evil coal mine executive who wants to steal the lands from these people poor in material goods but rich in culture (the movie never says why), moonshine drinking, philandering, arson, etc almost make it painful to watch.  The writer and producer would have served us better by sticking closer to the true facts behind Olive Dame Campbell and the legacy she and her husband gave us in the music and culture of the Southern Appalachians.

The story itself has a few weaknesses but the acting is excellent (particularly Emmy Rossum as Deladis and Pat Carroll as Viney Butler). You don't watch a movie like this for the plot, anyway. Just sit back and enjoy the music and the cinematography.
By the way -- a bit of a warning here for those who want to rush out and buy the soundtrack. Although the soundtrack is excellent in its own right, it is NOT the same as what you hear in the movie.",1081728000,2,547,4.320388349514563
1638810,4,B00005O0SO,"""Songcatcher"" is a good example of watching a talented newcomer showing her promising career before her.  I meam Emmy Rossum, whose angelic voice would captivate your heart.  And just like her voice, the film's greatest virtue lies in its music, around which the story revolves.
It's in 1907, America.  Lily Penleric, an associate-professor of music, decides to leave the academic institute, whose donnish scholars deny her any chance of due recognition.  Now she is with her sisiter, deep in the Appalachian mountains, where she accidentally finds that old ballads are miraculously preserved among the people living there.  Lily starts to collect the songs on the wax cylinders, but as you see, as Lily herself soon does, that she might be exploiting the unsuspecting people under the name of academic research.
The writer/director Maggie Greenwald shows tendency towards feminism message, which thankfully does not play the main role in most of the part.  In fact, the characters including Aidan Quinn or veteran Pat Carroll (known for the voice of Ursula in ""The Little Mermaid"") lack the steady and credible development, and the love themes of the film fail to interest us.  The story which involves even lesbianism is often too meldramatic to take seriously, with such familiar elements as arson and sudden gunshot.
But the film's music will compensate all.  The ballads, or type of folk songs, are irresistible, moving our heart with its simple lyrics and enthralling melody.  When the music starts, the film also starts to soar, and the film has been given many occasions for these songs to be played by real talents, which include, beside Emmy Rossum. Iris Dument or Hazel Dickens.  Plus you see a brief cameo of Taj Mahal.

From a film and script perspective, the subtexts were sensitively approached; I particularly appreciated the tasteful approach to the homosexual relationship between the two school-mistresses. The film did not strike me as making a political statement about feminism or sexuality or about the encroachment of industry on rural communities.

Take yourself back to a time before electricity in the mountains, before running water, before TVs, radio's and all the modern things we have and you see where the movie is set.  In the mountains, when live music, sung and played by families and friends was a way of life.  Was ingrained in their fabric and handed down from parent to child.  This movie was an outstanding depiction of that time.  Of the lifestyle and hardships of the mountain people and how the music ran through it all.

Having spent a portion of my childhood in North Carolina I found the characters quite believable and some very familiar.  If Songcatcher contains a few stereotypes it should be remembered that such notions are usually based on some reality.
Songcatcher is a pleasant diversion from the action films that do little besides blow up buildings or kill large groups of people.  I for one enjoyed Songcather and would like to see more of this type of film.

1638826,5,B00005O0SO,"This is a beautiful and unusual film, made even more so by its joyous celebration of folk music. Beautifully nuanced, well paced, and highly absorbing, this haunting film is an absolute gem. It is no wonder that it won the 2000 Sundance Film Festival Special Jury Award for Outstanding Ensemble Performance. The performances in this film are simply stellar and worthy of recognition.

The year is 1907, and the highly independent and intelligent Dr. Lily Penleric (Janet McTeer), a noted musicologist, has once again been passed over for promotion by the college at which she teaches. Angry, she decides to pull up stakes and go to visit her sister, Elna (Jane Adams), who is one of two women teaching at a settlement school in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina.

When Janet arrives, she hears one of her sister's helpers, Deladis (Emma Rossum), singing an old folk song that she recognizes. It is being sung in a way that she has never before heard it sung. Upon discovering that the song was handed down generationally in this insular community, she realizes that she may actually be hearing the song as it may originally have been intended to be sung. Excited by her discovery, she sets about capturing as many songs as she can from these fiercely proud, mountain people. In effect, she is memorializing a rich, oral, musical history.

Her project takes Janet on a voyage of self-discovery, both personal and professional. Along the way, she becomes immersed in the the lives and traditions of these mountain people, realizing what an integral part music plays in their lives. While poor in terms of creature comforts and leading a harsh, hardscrabble sort of life, these mountain folks have a culturally rich, oral tradition and are a  veritable treasure trove of old songs.

While catching the music and lyrics of these old songs for posterity and wider appreciation, notating her discovery of these songs for a book that she hopes to write, Dr. Penleric makes the acquaintance of a number of mountain men and women, including a tough old bird, Viney Butler (Pat Carroll). This leads to meeting with Viney's suspicious but intelligent, talented, and good looking grandson, Tom Bledsoe (Aidan Quinn), with whom she ultimately developes a passionate relationship that correlates nicely to her passion for music.

A number of other subplots are woven throughout this film. One involves her sister, Elna, who becomes involved with a love that dare not speak its name. There is also a love triangle between two of the mountain woman and the husband of one of them. Young love and coming of age are also themes that are touched upon. Meanwhile, a mining company seeks to buy out the land from under these people for a mere pittance. All of these subplots serve to illustrate the often harsh reality of life in the mountains. The only problem that I found was with the subplot involving Elna and her lover, Harriet, in terms of the complacency that surrounds what ultimately happens to Harriet. It was a most disturbing resolution that did not ring altogether true. Still, the overall strength of the film is such that it overcomes this incongruity.

Janet McTeer gives a no nonsense performance, and the way that the music seems to transfix and transform her is a joy to behold. Jane Adams, as Elna, gives an exquisitely beautiful and sensitive performance, as does E. Katherine Kerr in the role of Harriet, the settlement school teacher with whom Elna is involved. Aidan Quinn gives an intelligent and thoughtful performance as a mountain man who has been to the outside world and found it wanting. Pat Carroll is sensational as Viney Butler, the mountain woman who takes the vicissitudes of life in stride and wears many hats: mother, grandmother, midwife, musician, singer, and oral historian. Emma Rossum, however, is positively radiant as the young, fresh faced, mountain lass with a smile and voice that will tear your heart apart. She is a wonderful, young performer with operatic training and the ability to sing like Dolly Parton. What a find!

Cameo appearances by Taj Mahal, Iris Dement, and others serve to further enrich this film. The music and songs are played and sung live, which makes them resonate with authenticity and adds a vibrancy that might otherwise be lost. The folk dancing is a joy to watch, as the mountain people gather around for a jamboree. The film, shot on location, captures all the physical beauty of the terrain, as well as the rusticity and harshness of life in the mountains. This is simply a great film that is well worth having in one's personal collection.

The DVD is first rate, providing a clear, quality picture and great sound. It offers a wonderful commentary with the director, Maggie Greenwald, that explains the underpinnings of the film. There is also an interesting feature on the making of the film. All in all, it is a must have DVD for music lovers, as well as for those who simply enjoy a well made and beautifully acted film.

1638832,5,B00005O0SO,This was a wonderful movie. We saw it at the film festival and were entranced. We hoped to see it in theaters but believe it never got there. The music was great and the story was very well done...we were sad when it was over.,1014681600,3,226,4.044444444444444
1638833,5,B00005O0SO,"What I like best about this film is that it has a central idea that it sticks with from opening to close.  It doesn't get ruined by someone's tossing in a murder or a mobster which then wholly overtakes its trajectory.  Its premise is also original, about a female professor, Lily, who experiences discrimination back when it was legal, and hies herself off to a North Carolina mountain community where she discovers centuries old English ballads alive, well and performed stunningly by the people there.  She begins to collect the music and comes to know the people and participate in their community in the process.

Aidan Quinn is in one of his best roles in awhile as mountain man, Tom, newly returned from WWI, with tons of talent and in need of direction on what to do with it. Lily, as you might expect, has ideas enough for two.  This is another wonderful film discovered by the Sundance Film Festival, which has brought us so much quality in independent film.

1638834,4,B00005O0SO,"Anyone interested in music history and/or Scottish/Irish/English ballads that were taken to the hills of the Southeastern US to evolve into mountain music really must see this movie.
To the director's credit, the music was presented as it should have been, acoustically, with beautiful, authentic mountain voices. The story background themes may be a bit cliche, but it's not important, as the real story is the music itself, and the importance of preserving it.
One point I would have to argue is the emphasis on the music coming from England. These ballads were mainly Scots/Irish, and it was mentioned briefly, but there were too many references to the English ballads.  If the music is to be revered and preserved, its true origins should be accurate.
However, I would definitely recommend this movie for all true music buffs.",1010966400,4,830,5.0583941605839415
1638835,5,B00005O0SO,"This movie is one of those movies that one can simply enjoy.  There are no torrid sex scenes, no filthy language, no violence for violence sake.  In this movie, we are taken back to a part of the United States that for many people was a mystery...the hill billys, the primitives, the savages that needed teachers and missionaries to save them.  A culture of pioneers that isolated themselves and maintained a simple, beautiful but harsh way of life.  The music throughout this film is haunting, the acting superb, and the message of the film is very clear.  For those interested in the history of our American south, or interested in the folk music of the American south...then see this lovely movie.  There are some tough scenes...a gruesome birth which was probably not untypical of that era...a lesbian relationship explored from the views of that
time....some infidelity...  I throughly enjoyed this movie and it is one I will buy for my collection.",1007251200,8,953,4.881987577639752
1638836,3,B00005O0SO,"And unless you are a true fan of mountain music, rent before buying. Though I'm not an expert or particular fan, even I could tell that it is rich and unique music, and deserves a better setting than this cliched and sometimes anachronistic movie, which often felt like a product of Screenwriting 101.
There are so many problems with the story I hardly know where to start. Perhaps the romance between Mcteer's flatland academic, and Quinn's mountain man. This has been done so many times...some of their exchanges were so stereotyped they made me groan. For example, city woman Lily (McTeer) attends her first bloody, violent childbirth. Predictably, she flings at Quinn's character: ""You have no idea what that woman has just been through."" Just as predictably, he responds with a story that shows, yes, he does know; and which makes her, of course, sound unbearably self-righteous.
Also predictably, they go in an instant from sparring to kissing. Admittedly, the transition was not handled the way I expected. Though who didn't know, the instant Tom's Granny tells Lily (McTeer) how to escape a panther, and she laughs at the idea, that she is inevitably going to end up in a scene doing just exactly what she did?
The one cliche avoided was that this was not used to humiliate her by, for example, having her emerge from the woods in front of a crowd of people. Probably this is the advantage of a woman director.
Aidan Quinn's performance kept me awake, however, even when he was confined by stereotype. I found it more difficult to warm to McTeer. I know she was meant to be stiff to show contrast with the mountain people, and I know a certain amount of stiffness is true to the early 20th century period. However, it was a bit too much for my taste, though that may be the director's fault, not hers.
I also enjoyed Jane Adam's performance. I wasn't put off by the lesbian storyline as some viewers were. It was at least an interesting twist to the ""prim schoolmarm"" character.
However, the confrontation between Lily and her sister is keyed more for modern ears, and is shallowly characterized. Schoolteachers of that era were held to such high moral standards that Lily's shock and anger wouldn't make her a bigot. It would have been shocking if she'd found her unmarried sister in bed with a man. I also felt Elna (Adams) would have shown more confusion and surprise at what she had discovered about herself. Her acceptance is very modern.
The mistake with this storyline, however, was carrying it too far. It took over the story, and the final (tolerant) outcome wasn't believable. Again, keyed a little too much toward modern sensibilities.
The biggest mistake, however, was in failing to address the real issue: How is Lily going to repay these people for the incredible gift she is getting from them? How to record their music without (as Tom puts it) exploiting them? The people are so poor they are selling their land for a fraction of its value. The real story, then, should have been about Lily finding a way to resolve this dilemma, to pay them for their music, so they can keep their land and live in their old ways.
Instead she virtually abandons her work, at the very moment she can count on unlimited funding, recognition, and an eager assistant. She goes to the city to record mountain music (which doesn't quite make sense), because she thinks there will be a market for it. But wouldn't there be a better market if she continued her work and published her book, making the mountain people famous? Tom accompanies her, which contradicts everything about his character, who loves the mountain ways.
About the music: A mostly successful effort was made to integrate songs in a natural or dramatic way into the story. I still remember the song about death--a showstopper. It was a shame to have Taj Mahal, the black banjo player, in for only one scene, though. Finally, Iris DeMent's ""Barbara Allen"" over the credits was haunting, beautiful, and worth the price of admission.",1006214400,21,3999,4.763688760806916
1638837,4,B00005O0SO,"SONGCATCHER is one of those films that Hollywood used to make (and make well) all of the time. In other words, it's an intelligent story about a woman overcoming many obstacles as an outsider.
In this film, a historian comes to rural America to record the local folk music, which she believes comes from Europe. At first the woman is viewed with suspicion by the locals, until she earns their respect. It's a familiar tale, but well done here.
Besides the great folk tunes, one also appreciates the film's respect for the local people. Too often in Hollywood, poor people (especially poor southerners) are portrayed stereotypically. Not in this film.
More and more this type of film premieres on cable, because it is seen as ""too small"" for a theatrical release. This is really a shame, because to fully appreciate this film's wonderful cinematography and art direction, you need to see it on the big screen. For those that can't, the small screen is perhaps the only alternative.
If you love folk music or any of its musical cousins like the blues and country, you'll want to experience this charming film. For those who only listen to contemporary music, it might not be your cup of tea. If you're not sure, give it a spin in your VCR or DVD player, you just might like it. The dramatic performances are also very good. Also, look out for a cameo by blues legend Taj Mahal in the film.
Overall, SONGCATCHER may not win awards for originality, but it is nonetheless a well-crafted and engaging film. It is definitely worth a look.",1004313600,3,1531,4.674074074074074
1638838,3,B00005O0SO,"The backdrop and inspiration of ""Songcatcher"" is the music of the Appalachian Mountains at the turn of the century. This alone would have been enough to make for a good movie. Janet McTeer plays a musicologist who is surprised to learn that the people of this area have an oral tradition that has kept alive traditional songs thought long dead. The title of the film is ""Songcatcher."" The reality is that these people were often times referred to as ""song stealers,"" and weren't as kind and generous as the McTeer character is.
The film would have been entertaining enough had the filmmakers decided to explore this portion of the story. Sadly, that is not the case. They decided, instead, to bog down the story with one soap opera after the next. There's a school house in danger of closing down, a secret love affair between two teachers (though I wouldn't be so dismissive and ignorant as to call it a ""lesbian agenda"" as another reviewer has), and the refined musicologist falling for the backwoods and backwards mountain man (Aidan Quinn). These parts of the story didn't gel for me. On their own or maybe in an entirely different film, they could have added something. Here, they just detracted from the story and the real heart of the film -- the mountain, its people and its music.
If you are a fan of traditional music and good scenery, you'll enjoy ""Songcatcher."" Just don't get sidetracked by the unnecessary dramatics.",1003795200,8,1430,4.770161290322581

As an extra in the film, I got to be on the set for 3 days, and I interracted with all of the film's stars those 3 days. It was both a learning experience for me, and a pleasure to watch such wonderful actors in motion first hand. I was one of the featured square dancers in the barn dance scene.  The film is even more beautiful than I could have imagined...and I lived in the midst of those mountains before moving to VA.  But to see them on film thru the eyes of Maggie Greenwald, is breathtaking.  The film is a wonderful representation of the mountain music and people.

1638840,3,B00005O0SO,"Watching ""Songcatcher"" reminded me of attending an illustrated lecture by a brilliant, compassionate but insufferable academic whose scholarly specialty is the music and history of Appalachia. Maggie Greenwald certainly gives us beautiful, striking pictures of the North Carolina hills; she brings on the best available actors--Janet McTeer, Aidan Quinn, Pat Carroll--to enact her tale; she hires the best available singers--Hazel Dickens, Iris DeMent, Emmy Rossum--to sing beautiful Appalachian ballads in authentic style. But instead of giving us a story that builds to a dramatically satisfying climax, Greenwald gives us a series of sermons about the exploitation of the hill folk, the despoiling of their land, the oppression of women. You agree with everything she says--you wouldn't have come to the show otherwise--but she preaches to the choir as if it had the collective brains of a field of kudzu. ""Songcatcher"" makes all the obvious points, and ends up in a fairly ridiculous tangle of melodramatic plot ends. But the talented people who collaborated on it ensure that it can't simply be dismissed. The movie is a series of set pieces, some of which are as beautiful as you might hope, and some unfortunately are not.",999129600,15,1229,5.3076923076923075
