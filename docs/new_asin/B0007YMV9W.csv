2251435,4,B0007YMV9W,"Solomon was obviously so busy picking the movie apart that he forgot to enjoy it.  To set the record straight, ""Rock and Rule"" is not great art.  I obviously didn't die happy after seeing it.  What it IS is entertaining.  The animation was (is) stylish for the time.  The storyline was good. The characters are likable (even the bad guys). The music is great.  Twenty years on, snippets of the songs still surface from the murky depths of my poor mind.  It's well worth seeing.  I'd definitely place it within my top ten favorite animated films.",1116460800,2,545,4.604166666666667

2251437,5,B0007YMV9W,"What can I say to praise ""Rock & Rule"" that the other reviewers who enjoyed this film haven't said already. Only that reading about ""Rock & Rule's"" greatness is like hearing about an incredible concert you missed: NOT ENOUGH(A tease, actually)

Sure, they can tell you about how cool the animation is, the intesting characters and great soundtrack...but if you really want to be convinced about ""Rock & Rule"" before you buy it (and you will buy it) just find one clip of film on line somwhere and I guarantee you'll be hooked.

Everyone likes animation these days. Some of the best movies that have come out of recent years are animated features.

Pixar alone has a consistency in story telling and visual wonder that bests, in my opinion, even the newly released Star Wars trilogy (another animated series of a kind). So add in the fact that rock music is making a major come back via The Rapture, The Strokes, White Stripes and so many others who all worship groups from the late 70's and early 80's, and you've got a nice little market that's just opened. Consumers obsessed with vintage rock and animation. Ok, nows the time to bring back ""Rock & Rule"".

I would personally like to thank Unearthed Films for not only bringing back a movie that you could only find in copied form on Ebay, but by giving 'R&R' the deluxe dvd treatment it deserves. Bravo.

Next you need to strike up a deal with Urban Outfitters for the clothing line and before you know it, the boys in Hollywood will be 'greenlighting' ""Rock & Rule 2: The Return of Mok"". Wouldn't that be something....scary.

Next I'd like to see Lucas' ""Twice Upon a Time"" get a honorable DVD release. That would complete my animation needs...for a while, anyway.

2251438,4,B0007YMV9W,"Please ignore Mr. Solomon's review of the movie - if that's all Amazon is going to give it as a review, why even bother selling the new upcoming 2-disc set?  Sheesh!

This was my favorite movie at age 17.  Maybe I'm going to buy it just for the notalgia, but I *love* that movie, plot troubles or not.  It's still a far-cry better than other animated movies I've seen, and *MUCH* better than some live-action flicks I've seen (or avoided).  If you get this for your 17-year-old metal-loving, guitar-playing son, he will love you, and never forget the flick.  Okay, it's not rated G, but you see less than you did on Janet Jackson on live television, and it's more socially nourishing than, say, ""Catwoman"" or ""Battlefield Earth"" or ""Highlander II"".  So ignore Charles Solomon, and grab a copy for yourself, if you like animation at all!  The music is good, the movie is fun, and you won't be sorry!",1114992000,8,898,4.56875

2251440,4,B0007YMV9W,"One wonders exactly what the amazon.com reviewer was expecting when he looked at this film.  There are some movies that win by style and spirit alone, and Rock & Rule is definitely one of those.

It is a memorable animated feature if for no other reason than by virtue of Mok, who I think is one of the best animated screen villains of ALL time...a devilish cross between Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed (with songs by two of those actual artists!).

The story and characters may be on the preposterous side, but if you're looking for ""anime-style"" hardcore sci-fi geekouts you have come to the wrong piece of entertainment, my friends.  This movie is about the power of ROCK MUSIC, both the camraderie and force of good spirits it can give and the evil mass-control it can harness.  And the early use of computer graphics is not only historically interesting but well incorporated into the piece--the animation quality is excellent, as are all the voice performances.

The soundtrack is too good to be true and ties everything together in great form, becoming a part of the narrative and not simply promotional 'decoration.'

This is one of the most eagerly awaited 'lost' animated films for good reason.  I don't think it's a film for everyone.  But for those who can enjoy Rock & Rule it will be like ""sugar on the tongue""--something that for me at least, I come back to repeatedly over the years or even decades to feel good while watching and be thoroughly entertained.",1113696000,4,1471,4.692607003891051
2251441,5,B0007YMV9W,"Don't believe the ""it's not a memorable film"" garbage from Charles Solomon.  He's a clueless nitwit who doesn't know what he's talking about.  This is a ""cult classic"" BECAUSE it's a memorable film.

It's dark, funny, bizarre, and filled with vieled commentary about the music industry.  There are some interesting morality issues brought up as well.  Obviously not one for the kiddies.  Though the music (of that era) plays a heavy role, it's not JUST about music...there's alot more going on.

If you want an intelligent movie that doesn't treat it's viewers as morons, with a great rock theme/score, you can't go wrong.

2251443,5,B0007YMV9W,"Attention Animation, 80's rock, Post-Apocolyptic & Mutant Freaks! Why are you even bothering to read this review? This is Rock & Rule! Take out your credit cards and buy it. This movie is awesome. It takes place after a Nuclear war. Rats, dogs, and cats have evolved(sort of!) and run the earth. One of them happens to be a rock star named ""Mok"". Who has delusions of grandier. He's not a bad guy after all ""Evil"" spelled backword is ""live"". So he wants to bring a demon from another demonsion, to make him all powerful, What's wrong with that?...as you can probably guess it's a bad Idea! But who is going to stop him from trying? Enter ""Angel and Omar"" a local Duet Band. These 2 are just trying to catch a break in the industry. Mok is more than willing to oblige. He would love to ""break"" them up. Since he only needs Angel for her voice and everyone else is simply expendable. The animation is clean, crisp, and very psychedelic. The soundtrack is Big 80's Fun with Iggy pop singing for Mok! and Deborah Harry(Blondie) singing for Angel. Cheap Trick & Lou Reed are in there too! If you don't know any of those artists maybe you shouldn't get this film.....Nah, get it anyway...I'm sure you have much worse animations in your collection this one will definetly bring your average up and score you a few brownie points with people that know their stuff!!!!!!",1111968000,,1361,4.536585365853658

2251456,5,B0007YMV9W,"Alongside The Secret of NIMH, this is my favorite animated film of all time, because it really shows what animation can do when it wants to be intelligent, powerful, and taken seriously.  How this was never more of a hit, I can't imagine -- yes it has a certain awkwardness to the flow sometimes -- such as the wonky vocal dub where Omar is heard snotting off to Mok about his hamster using Mok's last album for a room divider, while cutting back twice to Omar who can be seen from the side-back but still hasn'[t moved, so the dub looks forced -- but you're never going to get vocal talents like these all in one place ever again.

More specifically, I got the Blu-Ray of this film and the rendition is just amazing -- the colors are richly saturated, the lines are smooth, dark and clean, and the sound is amazing.  I also really enjoyed seeing the bonus features and, specifically, what Omar's voice was originally supposed to sound like, before the original voice actor was replaced for some unexplained reason.

My only complaint about the film is that it has no close-captioning, so there are places where the vocal dubbing is such that what a character is saying is drowned out.",1475452800,6,1185,4.549295774647887

2251465,5,B0007YMV9W,"This is adult animation, anime. It takes place in a post apocalyptic world where humans look like various animals. The plot surrounds the success, kidnapping and salvation of the singer in a band, Angel (voice by Susan Roman, and singing/music by Deborah Harry of Blondie). and the evil Mok (voice by Don Francks, singing voice by Lou Reed) who conjures up a demon from hell (voice by Iggy Pop) using the frequency of Angel's voice as a harmonic key. Angel is attempted to be rescued by boyfriend Omar (voice by Gregory Salata, singing voice by Paul Le Mat and Robin Zander in studio overdubbing).
Will Omar save Angel from Mok? Will Omar conquer Mok's demon?
You would think that this 1983 VHS release from Canada would have been a hit with the talents of Deborah Harry, Lou Reed, Paul Le Mat and Robin Zander.

The Blu Ray looks pretty good, the animation isn't meant to look perfect so there are parts that are visually underwhelming. The sound quality is great though, which is good since the movie touts songs from Iggy Pop, Debbie Harris, Lou Reed, and Cheap Trick.
The special features are pretty good, but the one thing that stood out was the really great short The Devil and Daniel Mouse which is a great companion to Rock and Rule. Overall if your interested in the film you can't really go wrong.",1454544000,,695,4.480314960629921

2251485,4,B0007YMV9W,"NOTICE: This is a review for the 2-Disc Collector's Edition.
Talk about a departure. I always thought that good ol' Canadian studio, Nelvana, was always an innocent little place, which was the home to shows like Care Bears, Little Bear, and Franklin. However, this film here, Rock & Rule, a film with elements of drug use, profanity, and devil worship, was a rather dark turn! The result was a mixed bag. The story isn't anything really noteworthy. An aging rocker, Mok, is wanting to use the ""very special voice"" of Angel, a member of a local band, to summon a demon from ""another dimension"" and her boyfriend, Omar, must stop him with the help of his fellow bandmates. It's simple. However, what makes this film worth the interest of any animation fanatic is the great animation and soundtrack. This was the first feature film by Nelvana and it seems to be the one project that they put their best efforts into. The animation is dark and moody in all the right places. While the character designs are odd (they're mutated animals that look like humans with dog snouts drawn on them), the quality of the animation makes them look more convincing, especially the Mok character. You also can't go wrong with a soundtrack consisting of Cheap Trick Debbie Harry, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, and Earth, Wind, & Fire! This set includes a disk containing the American version of the film, director's commentary, a short documentary of the making of the film, and some concept art, while a second disk as the Canadian version of the film, the Devil and Daniel Mouse TV special and inspiration for the film, a rough cut of the ending, and even MORE concept art. Now THAT is what you call ""special features""! Unfortunately, the Canadian version on this disk is from a VHS source because the original print was destroyed in a studio fire. It's still the most interesting version of the film, despite the low quality. If you can afford this DVD set (since the prices are getting rather high) or the Blu-Ray (which contains both versions of the movie in a single disk), check it out.",1431648000,,2063,4.68595041322314

I loved the soundtrack, sadly there is no official cd with the songs. ""Send Love Through"" a powerful duet with Blondie's lead singer and Omar (voice depends on which version you watch) is a thrilling finale.

2251503,5,B0007YMV9W,One of the best animated movies by far!,1408924800,,39,4.0
2251504,4,B0007YMV9W,"Like so many others, there are certain animated movies that came out in the 80's that I've been waiting (and waiting) to be re-mixed, re-printed and re-issued. Heavy Metal was one of those. Rock & Rule was the other, and what a surprise! I had no idea there was an alternate version or that there was an initial short animation that started it all.

SPOILERS below!! If you want to enjoy a first viewing of the film, stop reading now!

First the bad:
This is the best print we will probably ever get. It's dark and it's cloudy and the sound is not always the easiest to hear, but it still beats the bootleg VHS copy I have where much of the sound and some of the scenes were missing. (On my VHS, the first introduction to Omar's band in the club shows Stretch and Dizzy singing backup vocals but with no sound and also Mok's line about how Angel really ""pissed him off"" is missing). While this is all fixed in the DVD, the music is perhaps the clearest of the sound (thank God). Some of the dialogue is difficult to hear. Some of this because of the actors; some of it is because of the film itself. I can't complain really. Like I said, I'm happy to have this, but in a perfect world, this little animated gem would've received the same painstaking treatment as any film in the Criterion collection.

It's not a perfect story, even if it's a classic and a huge piece of nostalgia for me. There are little gaps in the plot and a feeling that this is a larger universe that has been cut down to size. A perfect example is the adversarial relationship between Omar and the boys and Office Quadhole. They seem to know each other, and that knowledge feels bigger than what little we see on the film. Mok seems to go through a lot of trouble to persuade Angel to sing to release his demonic beast, but why? He's a psychopath and obviously doesn't need her to do it willingly. In fact, he ends up simply plugging her into the circuit boards at the end and forcing her to do it. While you can suggest he wanted the pleasure of seducing her into following him willingly, I still feel someone who has descended to this level of craziness would spend as much time using ""what's her face"" to throw Omar off the track. First he tries to seduce, then he extorts Angel with the lives of Omar and the band, then he simply just forces her. It felt like a lot of trouble when he could've simply abducted her and forced her to do it or used an ""Edison ball"" which apparently makes someone very  happy and agreeable. Also there are 3 brothers working for Mok? (Sleazy, Toad and Zip), but usually only 2 onscreen at any one time, and what happens to the third brother at the climax? Is only one brother upset that the other brother was killed? Did their need to be 3 brothers? It also turns out they have a sister, ""Cinderella"", but she shows up for one small segment then disappear. She seems to be a wholly contrived character designed solely to help Angel escape (and not for long). There's a tagline at the beginning explaining that our animal characters evolved because of World War III, but I couldn't tell you what animals the characters evolved from and the universe is foreign enough that such information is really not pertinent. In fact, any tagline at the beginning, including the explanation of Mok and his plan is unnecessary. It adds nothing. In fact, it actually subtracts. Don't tell me about Mok. Let me find it out for myself.

Now, the good:
Why do I really like this film? Several reasons. First, there are many animated musicals (see Disney), but not very many animated Rock Operas. In fact, ARE there any other animated rock operas? Second, there are several songs here that are downright infectious. Angel's song being the most memorable and the one that leaves me humming it days later. Third, truly excellent musicians are used at their prime. Debbie Harry makes this film great to no small degree because of Angel's theme. Lou Reed comes in a close second with his Mok theme which to this day makes me both sing and laugh. ""My name is Mok. Thanks a lot."" Next, the direction and the animation have moments where they are simply superb. The characters seem to be animated in slow motion (not unlike the style of Heavy Metal), but it works. Their expressions and gestures and all-around motion are natural, and they tell you what the characters are feeling. I expect Omar to be shocked when he discovers Angel has left him for Mok and his face is animated to show it. His eyes dart to his friends before he shuts down to hide his emotions and form a plan to get her back if only because ""she owes them an explanation"". There are interesting choices and visually memorable scenes. Mok hiding in his closet after a tantrum, surrounded by mannequin heads with his different looks / wigs, gone until the flashlight spots him. His design is perfect. Ugly like Steven Tyler, Lou Reed or Mick Jagger, but somehow beautiful at the same time. You can see why he is the ""biggest thing since World War III"". Angel is beautiful, tender, and when Mok disappears through his ""magic"" the first time, her face registers how much it impresses her. When a dazed Dizzy moons her from the bus, you can see the barest smile on her lips with Mok grinning behind her. When Omar smashes her wrist chains with his guitar, her hands fly out before her and she tumbles forward in a perfect animated display of an off-balanced body. When our hero and heroine come together in the end, it feels right. The purposefully enigmatic ""no one voice"" concept is clear (though no great mystery). It works because the song is great and the singers, Harry and Zander, throw their full voice into it. There is passion. There is great harmony. There is excitement.

There is a scene on Mok's airship showing the city coming into view outside which brings us to the interior shot of Angel sadly playing her theme on the piano. It's breathtaking. The scene between her and Mok are perfect. The use of silhouettes. Mok's response to Angel's seductive whispers ""just us. Just you and me."" Mok presses his lips together in what you first think is a moan of pleasure ""mmm"" only to end up saying, ""mmmmeee."" There are so many perfect expressions in this film that the gaps and WTF's are easy to overlook.

About the DVD:
The alternate version is poor quality and the pre-opening title card from Unearthed Films explains why. A fire destroyed the original negatives and this is the best they can do, but they wanted to include it and I'm glad they did. The differences are small, but they are there and they make a difference.

Greg Salata as Omar works in any situation where Omar has to be an ass or needs to sound a little tough, but it doesn't work with Angel. Angel has a tender heart and Salata's voice is too harsh when they are together. Paul Lemat has a slightly softer tonality. There's no hard-Brooklyn inflection in Lemat's voice; it's all sweet, if a little stupid. It's funnier, too, when he Omar mistakes Toad / Sleazy for Mok. Lemat's voice is slightly dopey, but not overly so.

Other than the actor change, there are other little differences that change how I felt about Omar. In his first true conversation with Angel, Omar tells her that she's good, but when Angel ask why he walked off and left them in the middle of her performance, Salata's Omar says, ""Sometimes I walk and sometimes I talk."" Lemat's Omar says nothing, but goes straight into an apologetic, ""things got a little weird.""

When Salata's Omar is threatened by Toad, Salata calls him a ""dick nose"", which is harsher, but not terribly so. Lemat's Omar calls him ""dog breath"", which is a good follow up to Toad's earlier comment about dog food.

Other differences:
In the montage of Omar and the band driving to Nuke York, the alternate version has some redundant dialogue. Dizzy explains in voice over that he has an Aunt in Nuke York. Later, in her tattoo parlor this is again explained when he calls her ""Aunty"". There's a radio announcer that breaks in and explains that Nuke York is closed due to a power outage, but in the very next scene the borderguard explains the same thing (in a slight impression of John Wayne). In the theatrical version the traveling montage sticks to the music without the dialogue or the radio announcer and it works better.

Also, in an early scene when we see Stretch's car from a bird's eye view of the city heading for the first time to Mok's mansion there is only background music in the alternate version. The theatrical version uses the opportunity one more time to remind you of Angel's theme.

In the alternate version, after having tried to seduce Mok and suffering through his tantrum, Angel says ""If I can sing it up (the demon), I can sing it down."" In the theatrical version, this is cut and rightfully so because it feels more spontaneous when she's on stage saying the exact same thing. It adds to the passion of the final showdown rather than making you feel as if she had a plan B the whole time.

In the alternate version, Omar is less sympathetic when the boys are electrocuted and come of their daze brought on by Mok changing their brains in the ""Edison ball"". When Dizzy tells him that Angel is in trouble, Omar walks away saying, ""I'm out of the rescue business."" When Officer Quadhole shows up, we actually see Omar walk around the corner. Also in this version when Dizzy & Stretch steal his squad car again, he starts to scream his catch phrase(?), ""SLIME!!"", but then stops halfway and makes a gesture like ""Oh, forget it."" In the theatrical version, Dizzy tells Omar ""Believe your heart, not your eyes"", then suddenly Omar is gone and the alleyway is empty. Stretch asks ""where did he go"" and Dizzy tells him ""I think I know."" Officer Quadhole screams his ""Slime"" catch phrase(?) without stopping.

In the alternate version, Angel goes to the confront the demon to ""sing it back down"" and Omar tells her ""you don't have to sing, we have to run!"" But in the theatrical version, Omar simply screams ""No!"" before later joining her in one voice, one heart, one song.

In the alternate version, after Mok has been thrown into the pentagram, Mylar is on stage and telling the audience what a great show this is that he brought. He also tells the audience that Mok is really backstage . . . he thinks. This is missing from the theatrical version.

The making of Rock & Rule is old and good. The animators and musicians are young, but there are no interviews with the actors, which would have been nice. This is not Unearthed Films' fault. It's the fault of whoever originally made the short documentary.

The Devil and Daniel Mouse is a short, more traditional cartoon. It's fairly typical animation with a cliched storyline and if not for seeing the elements of Rock and Rule, I would probably never remember having seen it. The making of Devil and Daniel Mouse is fine, but really doesn't add much to the enjoyment of the main feature.

Buy it or don't buy it?
If you read through the reviews, you'll probably see that the audience is largely people my age who remember this film growing up, but even outside of that, it's good. It's representative of its time, but it's also a well animated, interesting piece of sci-fi rock opera that will leave you singing Angel's theme and Mok's theme days later.",1408752000,,11297,4.539783889980353
2251505,4,B0007YMV9W,"I'll skip rehashing the plot and swooning over the film - there are plenty of other reviews for that.  Let's talk about the Blu-Ray. When indie distributor Unearthed Films picked up the rights to release the movie on DVD in 2005, they did a 1080 transfer and released it on DVD.  Half a decade later came the Blu-Ray, which utilizes the same transfer - and the image is considerably sharper than the DVD.  Others have griped about film grain and specks of dirt that could've been cleaned up, but that seems like nitpicking to me since the film has never looked better (I first had the film on VHS, so I REALLY notice the differences in the three releases).  The sound mix, however, is identical to the previous DVD (which wasn't great to begin with since they utilized the bad mix from the theatrical version for the 5.1 upgrade).

The extras on the Blu-Ray, all ported over from the 2-disc DVD edition, are a bit irksome - specifically because things have been omitted.  For starters, the menu on the first disc of the DVD set was pretty cool; the Blu-Ray just has a still-frame of the film's logo underscored by Angel's ""Invocation Song.""  The DVD included a booklet with an informative article reprinted from FPS magazine.  Gone.  There was a ""Restoration Comparison"" which included the unused ""Ring of Power"" title sequence, extensive galleries of artwork from the film (different on each DVD) and a PDF of the script..  All have been left off of the Blu-Ray.  Once again, they included the syndication edit of ""The Devil and Daniel Mouse"" (the Halloween special which served as the launchpad for ""Rock & Rule"") which is missing two or three minutes of footage -- nothing major's been cut out, but since it's VHS quality they could have exerted the effort to find another tape (uncut copies released on VHS by WB in the '80s can regularly be found for $10-$50).

The extras that are included are pretty amazing though.  There's an audio commentary with the director, the alternate CBC print of the movie which includes a slightly different prologue, a vastly superior sound mix, a different voice for Omar and some deleted footage.  Unfortunately the original print was reputed to have been destroyed in a fire, so it's VHS quality - and at one point during one of Mok's tantrums, it's like someone hit the pause button for a moment (both on DVD and Blu-Ray).  There is another alternate prologue (without narration) and a 12 minute workprint of the finale (mostly completed, but some animatics and pencil-sketches pop up from time to time); both are 1080 transfers but no effort's been made to clean them up.  There are also vintage making-of specials for both ""Rock & Rule"" and ""The Devil & Daniel Mouse"" (both VHS quality) and the trailer.

All-in-all, it's a great Blu-Ray, but the lack of new and previously released extras is annoying, so it's barely worth upgrading from the 2-disc DVD edition (particularly if you're paying ""out of print"" reseller prices -- and this title seems to be out of stock on amazon far more than it's available).",1406851200,3,3050,4.746212121212121

The movie itself is laced with style, fluid animation, and a awesome soundtrack. Mok's theme that opens the movie is a total throwback to early 80s synth tunes and lets you know exactly what to expect.

The blu-ray is a definitely upgrade from the DVD in both picture and sound. A lot of care was put into this release. Just about all of the features and behind the scenes stuff is included on the disc, as well as the Alternative Version of the film, which unfortunately, is encoded from a VHS source (this was due to the original master being destroyed in a fire, which the disc makes note of).

Now, I hadn't seen this but a couple of months ago after stumbling on some GIFs I saw on Tumblr, so I didn't really come into the fandom from nostalgia.

Seeing this release of the film only after having seen whatever I could download off the Internet was a really great experience for me, and I thought they did a really great job restoring it.

It's just like watching an old VHS which I think is pretty neat, in a nostalgic kind of way, anyway.  The ""making of"" mini film was really cool too, it really puts you back in time.

The movie itself is fine to watch and still one of the best Canadian made animated features of all time, to ever be produced and would be near impossible to repeat in my own opinion.

However that being said I do have much reservations about the condition of the movie itself.  Which has been poorly treated since it was found where ever it was.  A very large lacluster attempt at restoring the images to thier pristine originality is flawed.  Which was the biggest dissapointment for me in watching this.  Any attempts to restore some of the old picture remain sloppy at best.

While still a good flick to watch and a must have for collectors.  I feel this should have been much better treated and improved upon.  It is much, much overdue for a complete digital remake.  Improving on both the sound and picture quality and is also extremely overdue for a Blue-ray treatment to restore this wonderfull rarity to its original quality that makes it so worth its keeping down the long run.

Though I fear this will never come to be.  I do not fault those who found this movie and attempted thier effort to try and restore what they could but largly failed.  This movie remains the most ignored, unapreciated and left behind gem of Canadian animation.  That it will probably go on being ignored by those at Nelvana and this movie so in sore need of proper restoration.  Nelvana will do no such thing and leave it to the wayside of dust and decay.  While they idioticly consider a reboot.

So, what recommends this? First off, it's a wonderful blend of genres. It's an animated sci-fi/fantasy, post-apocalyptic, rock musical love story. It also has amazing music and some of the most quotable lines in a movie outside of Aliens or Better Off Dead.

On the down side, it is corny as all heck and the ending is a bit too Krull for my tastes (hence the 4 stars).

Mok is perhaps the best over-the-top villain of all time. He's self-obsessed, megalomaniacal, and completely without conscience. The main characters are a bit flat. The male lead is really just humor value while the female lead is only marginally interesting, but they do make beautiful music together and their fights work better than the rest of the dialog by a long shot. The only thing that undermines them is the strong sense that all of the speaking parts were recorded separately. There are some odd pauses and occasionally the rhythm of their conversations just don't make sense.

I'll leave you with just one thought: better get something on that before it festers. See the movie. It's one of the best love-rival lines I've ever seen in a movie. Had me in stitches.",1263427200,,2197,7.095940959409594
2251535,2,B0007YMV9W,"I bought this edition because I remembered seeing both The Devil and Daniel Mouse and Rock and Rule on TV as a kid. I loved both of them. I was quite frankly disappointed with this purchase for the following reasons:

1) The art in the US version isn't as clear as it should be. The picture is kind of grainy and in some scenes, the lines in the characters aren't as crisp as they should be. Considering what can be done with computers and special effects these days, Unearthed Films could have done a better job retouching the appearance of the film.

2) The Devil and Daniel Mouse has scenes missing from it. At first I thought I had a defective disk until I read another reviewer who noticed the same thing. If Unearthed Films was going to take the time to put Daniel Mouse on DVD, they should have made sure it was complete.

Bottom line, if you have to have this in your collection, get the one disk package. Only get the Collector's Edition if you have to see the CBC version for yourself.",1252022400,4,995,4.338709677419355

Anyway the animation and music blew me away at the time and as a little kid I thought the plot was pretty cool too.
For years I wondered what movie it was that I saw cause I thought it was so amazing and my parents would not let me watch it after like maybe half way into the film but they inevitably fell asleep on the couch and I turned it back on anyway.

So for almost 20 years vague memories of this film stayed in my head with me not knowing the specific movie until I looked up a list of all the released animated movies on Wikipedia and tracked it down, it was nice to finally be able to see the full movie.

The plot may have been a little weak but the film more than makes up for that with the excellent animation, music and pure nostalgic value that is priceless to me in a way.

It's also surprising that they were able to get away with a film like this back in 1983, I don't think this film would have gotten a pg rating today simply for the club scene of the movie. To hell with the censors tho !!",1250812800,,1129,3.921397379912664

This story is engaging with one of the most intriguing villains: ""MOK"".

I met the animator that created MOK, when I was working at Disney animation, and he mentioned that where he went with MOK, he's never had that freedom to explore while working at Disney. MOK is totally insane and paranoid, his lip and face design is really delicious to behold, he moves with such fluid exaggerated menace.

Angel the lead heroine is delightful to watch too, she has spunk of a modern girl, and takes action, which I like.

First impression: the people doing the transfer never saw the movie and never bothered to watch it after they transferred it to digital.  Two major flaws that I saw right away:

1.  In the car at the beginning, when Mok is muttering ""downward trend in popularity"", he blows smoke in the shape of a skull.  I know this because I had an old videotape from a TV version years ago.  *This* version has almost eliminated the smoke entirely.  Anti-smoking message or poor transfer?

2.  The video blacks out nearly two minutes before the end of the end credits ... although at least they kept the music going.

The extras were great, especially the low-resolution cut of the movie with the alternate lead actor voice (which *kept* the smoke skull in the same scene, if you want to see it), but I can't give a ""Collector's Edition"" 5 stars with two such major gaffes in the film digital transfer itself.

I want to add one voice to the list of people who really apreciated this piece of animation history that stood every chance of being forgotten.

Yes, I thought the DVD transfer copy _was_ too dark.  Lost alot of wonderful artwork details in some shots.  I really noticed it in the aerial travelling shot (en route to Mok's place).  Whenever clouds intervened, you got nothing but mud.  Hopefully, this was owing to a lack of good source material.  Aside from that, thanks for all the hard work that you did in putting this together, UE Films!

2251548,5,B0007YMV9W,"Man, what can I say about this film that hasn't been said already? Everything about this flick-the music, the animation, the characters, the voices, the story, all ROCK. As do the extras on the disk-both the audio commentary and the documentary. I really love the people who do the voice of Angel, the female lead. Debbie Harry does her singing voice, while Susan Romen (who years later would become the voice of Lita/Sailor Jupiter for the English dub of SAILOR MOON,) does Angel's speaking voice, and their voices blend perfectly so that it never seems like someone eles is doing Angel's voice when she starts singing.

I'm overjoyed that this hidden gem has gotten a DVD release, but I'm even happier that the disks has the sweet extras on it and not just a scene selection. (Put it next to CHOPPING MALL, DOLLS, SOCIETY, CHEERLEADER CAMP and CAT'S EYE for films from the 1980s that remained wonderful but obscure for many years yet got DVD releases that unexpectedly contain sweet extras such as commentaries that serve the film well.) If you're a fan of adult animation, (even if you're normally only into Japanese anime,) you owe it to yourself to check this one out.

P.S., as happy as I am that the DVD is out now, now I'm wondering where's the soundtrack on a music CD? This has really great songs that should be on a music disk in their entireity. My favorites would be ""I'm a rock and roller"" which plays during the scene where Omar, Dizzy and Streatch are driving the stolen police car to Nuke York to rescue Angel, and Angel's song,""Oh, What Will The Signal Be?"" which I may never get tired of hearing.

2251552,4,B0007YMV9W,"What word do you use when ""classic"" just doesn't quite cut it? Whatever it is it must be used to describe this film. Sure, its dated, made in the early 80's when both Debbie Harry and Cheap Trick were at their zenith (if you say you're a Cheap Trick fan these days people either look at you with blank faces, having not heard of them, or they laugh, ridiculing your taste in music...even so, I'm proud to admit they're my all-time faves). Of course, this movie isn't about them, or even ""made"" by their musical appearences, but it would have been so much poorer without them, as well as Lou Reed, Iggy Pop and Earth, Wind and Fire. What I'm trying to say in a round about way is, if you like animated film as opposed to cartoons, and ones that are very different to the norm, you just have to see this one. Heck, its a great story of the battle between Good and Evil too, what more do you want? Original too.

I first saw this movie way back in the late 80's...now, I live in Australia so even today only the single-disc version is available (and its region 1 which is odd as we use region 4!) I loved it from the first viewing, vowing to tape it next it was on. Needless to say, due to the time it was shown (usually around 2am) I never managed to do that. It had been about 10 years since  I last saw it to when it arrived in my mail box after ordering it on Amazon...and it went straight in the DVD player!

It wasn't quite as fantastic as I'd remembered it, but what is? It still grabbed me, just not as strongly. And I had a great feeling of accomplishment, that I finally had it! And the 2 disc edition too!

Now, if you're trying to decide which edition to spend your hard-earned on, well it depends on one thing...if you just wanna see it again, or if you're a bit of a completist and have to have the other, original version (which is of fairly poor quality due to the fact the original negatives were destroyed some years ago). If its the latter, buy the 2 disc, there's some great bonus stuff. If the former, the 2 disc would be good for you but isn't needed.

Yes, it is dated. Yes, its a little primitive, though it does feature some remarkable animation techniques for its time and budget...not to mention that just the fact it was released at all is testimony to the determination of its creative and production teams. The world would have been much poorer without it.

For parents wondering if its suitable for their younguns...well, no....sure, while there is no swearing or real violence, it is an adult concept, and would therefore be fairly boring for kids.....just as some animated movies are today (the Incredibles for example, nothing really bad in it, just not aimed at the child audience - though you wouldn't know it from the merchendising), in other words its aimed at us, the big kids.

If you can handle listening to classic 80's rock performers, have a distaste for the generic disney style of animation, and have a love of the genre....GET THIS MOVIE! You will not regret it!",1129680000,3,3006,4.366726296958855

The biggest flaw I can see is this:  no soundtrack album.  A soundtrack album alone would have probably sold more copies of this collection than 5 different versions of the film or the entire collected works of Nelvana.  The soundtrack is like the best oddball mixtape you could ever hope for with a Blondie/Cheap Trick collaboration, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, and Earth Wind & Fire.

That being said, the extras are worth it.  Odds are everyone buying this has actually seen it before or at least heard of it through an old episode of ""Lights, Camera, Action"" - so let's talk extras - the director's commentary and making of featurette are truly fascinating - I had no idea, that at the time this was made, that it was such a technical achievement in animation, almost entirely made the old fashioned way to boot.  The computer stuff is along the same lines as TRON, so interesting alone just to demonstrate how far we've come.  The bonus feature of ""The Devil and Daniel Mouse"" the inspiration for R&R's concept is probably the tighter story of the two, and watchable with younger kids, something R&R is really not.

I heard that extensive digital restoration had been done, and that the film now sported a 5.1 sound mix. I was shocked when I saw what that meant. It meant poorly managed independent work. This whole thing looks like it was created without any support from Nelvana.

Much of the film print has hideous flicker and raised grain. Much of the film looks worse than my VHS copy, or even the 'alternative' copy they have on Disc 2 of the Collector's Edition. Lines and edges are dodgy, and darker portions of the screen image are just messy blotches where lovely details should be.

The audio mix is similarly odd. Songs seem tinny and far away in the mix, while still being loud enough to make it hard to hear dialogue. It's a shame - because the score and musical numbers really are great.

First off for a movie about Rock the Audio is terrible espescially with the music. You hear music its probably in english but you can't understand a word anyone is singing. The dialogue comes out but the music is so distorted. They really must have found the best VHS or Beta copy they could find for the music. The video is even worse there are SO many drop outs in color and lighting it gave me a head ache. The whole film looks like a bootleg.

The film itself is another ""it came from the early 80's"" mess. This film is such a mess I don't know where to begin. The plot is the only thing thats holding this thing together. Its original and interesting for the first 5 to 10 minutes but soon it starts to drag like a drunk caught on a DeLorean. The plot centers around Mok a waning Shockrocker's attempt to ressurect a Demon from another dimension by kidnapping Angel a struggling muscician and Angel's band spending the entire film trying to rescue her. The movie is hurt even more by the lack of appealing characters. Mok is the only character that has appeal but we never learn why he wants to ressurect the demon or what the demon is. He's the only developed character in the whole film. Omar the lead hero is an angst ridden struggling muscician, Thats it. He's rude to everyone in the film and his jokes and taunting make him a very annoying lead. Thankfully he only gets plot driven screentime. We never learn Omar's story or why we should care about him he only serves as an alternative to Mok. Angel the female lead singer in the band(by the way we never learn the bands name or what their story is either) serves only as a helpless victem of Mok we never learn anything about her except that she has ""the voice"". The 2 remaining band members I forgot their names thats how memorable and appealing they are and I just finished watching the movie 10 minutes ago. One's thin, one's fat and thats it. They spend most of the film following Omar on his crusade to rescue Angel. There's also these rollerskating goons that make bad comic relief. Their big strong and stupid,where have we seen that before? They roll around on rollerskates and are brothers on the account that they all look the same. There's this subplot about one of them questioning Mok and getting the rest of them to turn on Mok at the last minute. The art in the film is interesting if you can make it out because the video feels like a bootleg. The animation looks and feels like rotoscope but its not. The film had potential to be a colorful commentary on Rock culture as well as good sci-fi animation. But now its just a smeared window into the forgotton era of the early 80's. I can now see why this film bombed and dropped off the face of the earth.",1124409600,9,2830,4.309568480300188
2251557,3,B0007YMV9W,"Like so many R&R fans out there, my only copy was a scruffy Betamax lift off of late night TV. When I heard that Unearthed Films had finally wrangled up a re-release (on DVD! Joy!) I was ecstatic.

But a caveat to all the folks out there who are just wriggling in anticipation of the return of a long-lost treasure; you'll find that it's been tweaked, in some parts, almost beyond recognition.

The movie's special qualities - Omar's hang-dog pouting charm, Mok's rubbery face and spit-spewing rants, Zip's childish infatuation with ""Uncle Mikey"" - are all still there, but the restoration of the movie does more damage than good.

First of all, the musical tracks have been turned up way too loud - they drown out some of the more memorable dialog (example, Dizzy giving Zip what-for about violence not being the answer to anything), and lyrics that were simply not there in the original release are suddenly present (""Born To Raise Hell"" and ""Pain And Suffering"").

Also, in trying to raise the color contrast in several scenes, much detail is lost. Anyone who remembers their first bleak look at Nuke York remembers the gigantic whale-shaped ship that swallows a smaller craft whole - in the DVD, you only get the merest hint. Mylar, already a hectic character, is reduced to a bright smear of color in several places, and the travelling scene (in Officer Quadhole's car) is just one long, bright blur.

And perhaps the most sacreligious cut of all... for a movie that is driven so strongly by its music, there's no soundtrack available! In reading the UF website, I realize that they couldn't get the rights to produce it, but still, it's a bitter disappointment. I'd much prefer to hear Earth Wind and Fire's ""Dance, Dance, Dance"" uninterrupted than see before-and-after sketches of what the opening credits would have looked like! Plus, the score would have been lovely too, a very nice piece of electronic uneasiness.

Having torn this poor DVD to shreds, I'll ease the pain by saying that anyone who was ever a fan of the original release owes it to themselves to pick this set up. Not only do you get the movie we know and love, but you also get a rare treat - a complete FIRST release with completely different voice work for Omar! Don't get me wrong, I love Paul LeMat, but the chance to see The Movie That Never Was is great. The ""making of"" featurette is also very nice - who would have thought that cow's brains could do so much...

Bucking all post-apocalyptic romance movie traditions, this movie breaks away from the boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl-to-bad-guy, boy-rescues-girl mold and promptly goes berserk. Angel, the girl with the golden voice, simultaneously balances Omar's ego, Mok's megalomania, her own desires to be a star, and her bad luck at having a most coveted set of pipes. She is an uber-heroine who still manages to collapse into her sweetie's arms when appropriate.

All in all, Rock & Rule's biggest draw is its familiarity to those of us who grew up on it, we 80's cultists who never let it go. Compare it to the polished works of the Disney Monster, or Miyazaki's inspired masterpieces, and it's clear that Nelvana will never win any major awards for this little jewel from the past.

It won't change the future of animation, push the boundaries, or shock you into flushing it down the toilet in a fit of rage. But really, that's not what makes a movie fun, is it? And fun is what this movie's all about. Great soundtrack, nice animation, and an original storyline make Rock & Rule a one-of-a-kind piece of eye candy.

On the merits of the movie alone, I would rate it at least a 4.5, but the ham-handed efforts of the restoration team really detracted from my enjoyment of my beloved old friend.

The DVD release may disappoint die-hard fans with its quality issues, but that doesn't take away the frisson you feel when you see those fateful words float through the clouds in the opening scene...

2251558,3,B0007YMV9W,"I bought this film as a Deborah Harry fan, not really expecting much.  Nelvana's animation has always had a bit of a ""creepy"" edge to it to me (the exception being the Star Wars Droids and Ewoks cartoons), so I knew I wouldn't be blown away by the animation.  About halfway through ""Angel's Song"", something hit me....although the music from this film was never released, there was something VERY familiar about that song.  Once I was able to process it, I knew why.  Fans of the film that long for music from it would do well to check out Deborah Harry's 1989 release ""Def, Dumb & Blonde"".....the track ""Maybe For Sure"" pretty much IS ""Angel's Song"" (or ""Send Love Through""), just with different lyrics.",1123200000,,704,4.653225806451613

This collection also includes a comment track, though I didn't seem to hear a lot from it, and a GREAT cartoon called, ""The Devil and Daniel Mouse.""  If you're a fan of animation (not of the Japanese style, necessarily), this is one you should get.  Rock 'n Rule fans have been waiting for this one a LONG time.",1122854400,,473,4.413793103448276
2251560,4,B0007YMV9W,"Hi. I agree with the majority of reviews here. It was a great film. I was glad to get it on DVD finally, after having a copy of it on VHS from late night TV for so long. Here's what I noticed, and this is probably my only beef here. During the scene when Omar and the group are singing ""Born to raise hell"", his band has no voices when they are singing! Omar sings, ""I was born for lovin'"", and the others look like they're trying to sing, ""I was born to raise hell"". The voices can be heard on the unrestored version of the film on Disc 2.

I don't know, perhaps it's just my DVD player, but I didn't hear them. On a positive note, the film itself was excellently restored. I see what was skipped from American TV. A couple of mild profanities, some brief adult situations, and some drug use.

The unrestored version was interesting because it features a different voice actor for Omar. This actor was chosen by the director before he was told to change. He's not bad, but the final Omar is much better, in my opinion. The other actors are the same. No scenes are changed either.

As of this writing, I have not yet viewed The Devil and Daniel Mouse. Frankly, I've never heard of it. So it may be good, it might not. You be the judge. There are a few other extras, be sure to check them out.

If you're a fan of animation and classic rock, like Blondie and Cheap Trick, be sure to give Rock and Rule a look. I think you'll enjoy it. I highly recommend it. Oh, and, put the kids to bed, please! This movie is ABSOLUTELY NOT for them. Thanks for reading!",1122768000,3,1553,4.166666666666667
2251561,5,B0007YMV9W,"Finally, a great movie gets the release it deserves!
My first experience with Rock & Rule was seeing parts of it featuring the music on one of the late night music video shows that were around in the early '80's, and I was blow away then by the bright, colorful animation along with the great music. I finally saw the movie one late night on CBC (the Canadian Broadcasting Company) and the movie, music and images have stuck with me ever since! Sadly the movie never got a proper release, and I had thought I'd never see it again till one day when I was thinking about the movie and did a Google search for it. What came up was Unearthed Films, and the news that they were restoring and releasing it on DVD!
Now I must admit I had doubts, was it going to be as good as I remembered? Would it seem dated after 22 years or so since I last saw it? Let me say this movie was even better than I remembered, and the job Unearthed Films have done with this release is nothing short of superb! Everything from the animated DVD menus, to the cover art and packaging is top notch, and the remastered 5.1 soundtrack and restored film make this movie look and sound even better then when it was first shown.
I'll try not to spoil too much, but the story is about an aging super-rocker named Mok, who is trying to use a concert to summon a demon to give him ultimate power. What he needs to complete his evil plot is a special voice, one that can make the right harmonic notes to open the gate and summon the demon. Mok finds that voice in the beautiful Angel, singing with her band in a run down bar in Ohm Town.
Mok then goes about trying to break up the band and eventually kidnaps Angel, taking her to Nuke York, and the rest of the band gives chase, leading to the final concert and battle of good and evil.
This movie is a product of early '80's animation, very similar in style to the far more widely known Heavy Metal, but in my opinion this movie is much better. I find the single story works better then Heavy Metal's  random story segments, and the animation is a lot smoother, brighter and very well done with that special organic feel that comes from hand-drawn animation, not like the modern computer generated movies of today. Plus the characters are all very well done, with Angel being totally gorgeous, the stuff young guys fall in love with, and Mok being a cross between David Bowie and Mick Jagger, with the looks and voice to match, just great stuff here.
And unlike Heavy Metal, the songs here were made special for this movie, as the characters are actually singing them, not just playing rock music in the background like most soundtracks. While all of them are really great, Cheap Trick and Debbie Harry did an awesome job especially, and the ending duet with her and Robin Zander from Cheap Trick is one of the most moving songs I can remember. And it all sounds great with the new 5.1 treatment!
I can't say enough about the job Unearthed Films did restoring this film, the picture quality is outstanding, the sound is great, everything about this DVD just says it is a labor of love, with a list of extras that put most current DVD releases to shame! And for a movie that got no recognition at it's release, for them to find all that they did and pack both DVD's full of extras is just amazing. Great stuff in the double DVD set for fans of the movie like character sketches, the alternate Canadian version, the making of the film documentary, the excellent directors commentary, original film workprints, full script and more.
If you are a fan of animation or great '80's rock, or both, then you really must check this movie out. Simply a lost treasure that finally has been Unearthed (pun intended) and made available once again for those who fondly remember the movie along with the time it was released, as well as a great movie to introduce younger people to what music and animation used to be about, you just can't go wrong with this one!",1122768000,3,3961,4.3964577656675745
2251562,5,B0007YMV9W,"I first saw this movie back in 1988 and, being a huge fan of Debbie Harry and Cheap Trick, I was smitten with it.  Unfortunately I soon found I could not get a copy of it anywhere.  I ended up ordering it on VHS from a small video store and paid $80 for the tape!  Boy do I feel dumb now that it has been re-released on DVD, all these years later.  In my opinion, this is THE best hand-painted cell animation movie from the 80's.  The animation is smooth and extremely detailed (worthy of Disney or Warner Brothers), and the story is interesting.  What really ices the cake though is the movie's amazing sound track, with songs by artists such as Iggy Pop, Debbie Harry, and Cheap Trick, all written specifically for this movie and can't be found anywhere else.  The movie is a cult classic and quite unique.  If you are a fan of Sci-Fi movies, or of animated films, then you need to own this one!",1122681600,3,897,4.266272189349112

This film is not for all viewers, and certainly not for children under 14. It is however a magnificent work of art by a team of dedicated dreamers that were lucky enough to see their dream through to reality. Albeit probably not the reality they had envisioned while they were creating their film. It is a humourous and highly enjoyable film with a feel good message that doesn't come off too sickly sweet.",1122076800,2,536,4.424242424242424
2251565,5,B0007YMV9W,"Set in the future where man has destroyed himself, the only survivors were rats, cats and dogs that have mutated into humanoid beings.

A magnificent, entertaining and well made animated Sci-fi fantasy rock opera with the music of Debroah Harry, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, Earth Wind and Fire and Cheap Trick. The Animation is what i call spectacular even on the characters, there's a fairly decent plot but still this is a very impressive underrated cult animated flick that will now have it's audience thanks to DVD, that Angel is a total knockout.

The 2-Disc set includes the American version with great pictre & sound quality and the alternate Canadian version with a different voice track for ""Omar"" some omitted scenes and a alternate ending. There's also commentary by the director Clive Smith, behind the scenes, the Nelvana short "" The Devil and Daniel Mouse"" with behind the scenes of that short, trailer to ""Rock & Rule"", still gallery, collectable booklet, and conceptual art.

A highly recommended movie and a highly recommended DVD for lovers of animation, Sci-fi, fantasy and rock.

Also recommended: Heavy Metal, American Pop, The Fifth Element, Blade Runner, Total Recall, Wizards, The Black Cauldron, Fire & Ice, Hey Good Looking!, Robin Hood (Disney), Akira, Ghost in The Shell, Metropolis ( both 1927 and 2001 versions), Princess Mononoke, The Dark Crystal, The Wizard of Oz, Treasure Planet.",1120003200,27,1694,4.975265017667844
2251566,3,B0007YMV9W,"I bought this Collector's Edition DVD for two reasons, I LOVE Rock & Rule and I LOVE The Devil and Daniel Mouse. Both of these films mean a lot to me since I have been watching them for all of my life. I am so pleased that Unearthed Films did justice to Rock & Rule! It was incredible to watch it the way it should be seen for the first time in my life. But sadly I was very, very disappointed with The Devil and Daniel Mouse. Having watched it all my life I'm pretty familiar with the story and couldn't help but notice it's not in it's entirity. The sound and visual quality was great but it's cut in such a way you can't help but notice where parts are missing (IMO). It was so unbearable to watch for me that I only watched it all the way through once to play it side by side with my old tape to make sure I wasn't just imagining things.

So in short, if you just love Rock & Rule you will be completely happy as it is done to perfection. But if you are also a fan of The Devil and Daniel Mouse you'll probably come away just as disappointed as myself. So if you fall into the latter category just save your money and buy the non-collector's DVD instead.",1118966400,3,1158,4.034782608695652
2251567,5,B0007YMV9W,"This movie, released in the eighties, flopped in the states.. What a shame.... As far as sheer animation goes, it was better than Heavy Metal(IMHO). This print is immaculate, and the colors are vivid, with the exception of the Canadian release on disk 2. Apparently the master was lost in a fire, so they had to re-master for DVD from a 2nd generation print.. I saw this movie for the first time as rental VHS when I was 15 and was blown away! For years you could only find this as a bootleg(VCD's on ebay), or second generation VHS tape... Finally Nelvana released it, and I feel like I'm 15 years old again. Thanks for the memories guys!",1118361600,3,639,4.423728813559322
2251568,4,B0007YMV9W,"...but I simply do not get a lot of ""official reviews"" of this film.  While I do not wish to impugn the above editorial review (his opinion is certainly as valid as any other), with the possible exception of ""Heavy Metal"" many animated films of the early 80s simply seem to be ignored or berated.  Somehow, movies like this and Ralph Bakshi's equally brilliant ""Fire & Ice"" just never clicked with the populace at large and fell through the cracks, where only a few managed to see them.

But, thanks to the miracle of DVD and the dedicated staff at Unearthed Films, maybe the film will finally reach an audience that can appreciate it.

The movie itself, if you are unfamiliar with the plot, takes place in a dark, sinister future, many years following a nuclear war which has eradicated mankind from the planet.  The cities are now inhabited by mutants that evolved from dogs, cats, and rats.

Enter Mok, a declining rock superstar who more than slightly resembles a cross of Iggy Pop and Mick Jagger.  Utilizing black magic, he seeks revenge on the world that is turning its back on him by opening a dimensional gateway and releasing a demon.  All he needs is a certain voice that can open it...and as the movie opens, that voice just happens to be singing at a local bar.  When Mok spirits her off to work his evil will, her band, led by the co-singer/jealous boyfriend, follows her...ending in a concert finale of epic proportions.

While the movie has confusing sequences and a slightly disjointed narrative, it is cleverly written, with plenty of slapstick, visual gags, and dark humor which work really well...all crammed into a scant 79 minutes.  Like many of the Japanese animation films of today, it is a movie not really intended for children (though I saw it when I was 6; go figure).  It is dark, edgy, and has a lot of music industry jokes (the good guys are not only musically vocalized by Cheap Trick, they look a lot like them, too) that might go over the heads of younger viewers.  It ain't rated PG for nothin'.  This is also the reason the movie gets four instead of five stars...let's face it, it's too off-beat to appeal to everyone.

But the real strength is in the music.  With a soundtrack specifically written for the movie by artists like Cheap Trick and Debbie Harry, it is a movie best experienced with the sound turned way up.  A major point of the film is the power of music, and on this end it does not disappoint; unlike other films which merely use music to heighten the mood, here the soundtrack is actually an interwoven part of the story.

The DVD version of the film is extraordinary.  The 5.1 mix, which on many older films tends to merely provide it with better music while the rest of the sound goes to the center channel, is actually quite remarkable.  While I do remember my VHS tape being slightly more dynamic (some vocals during one of the Cheap Trick songs on the VHS have a more gimmicky-sounding surround than the DVD version, for instance), it is clear, vibrant, and most of all, best heard loud on a good surround system (the end sequence sound so powerful I almost wept; seriously).  The 1.85 anamorphic widescreen looks crisp and clear, and considering the limited budget the clean-up crew did an amazing job removing scratches and burns (there are a few dinky ones, but nothing to cry over).  As for those of you with the two-disc edition...well, let's say ""Collector's Edition"" actually applies here.  Besides a two-page booklet, commentary, and bonus features like a still gallery, the second disc includes two bonuses worth purchasing on their own: namely, an alternate version of the film with different footage and more sarcastic, cynical voice for Omar (voiced in the theatrical version by Paul LeMat, who is much more laid-back and wisecracking) and ""The Devil and Daniel Mouse,"" an entertaining twenty-minute short made in the late '70s which is more family-friendly, humorous, and an obvious inspiration to the longer film.

DVD has proven to be a great resource for those of us who have waited far too long for our films to get the recognition they deserve.  If you like your animation a little less ""Disney,"" or the darker films of the early 80s, or you just like offbeat stuff, check it out.",1118102400,27,4257,4.674262734584451

Have not gotten through the extras yet but the film itself was better than I can describe and the sound was incredible. It shows how much a labor of love the transfer was.

This is a MUST HAVE for a complete DVD collection.",1118102400,2,398,3.9012345679012346
2251570,5,B0007YMV9W,"Rock & Rule is truly one of the greatest undiscovered gems of early 80's animation. Barely being released in theaters and having limited TV and video releases, not too many people had the chance to really see this masterpiece. Taking more than a few years to make, and more than 200 people working around the clock on the project, it was truly a labor of love.

This new 2-Disc Collector's Edition is a very nice set, however you look at it. You can tell that much time and care went into this one. Packed with a new Anamorphic 16X9 Widescreen transfer and a jaw-dropping Dolby 5.1 remix, Rock & Rule has never looked and sounded better! The package is a custom box with a pullout gatefold digi-case, and exceptional artwork on all sides.

Now let's talk about the extras on the first disc, which is also available as the cheaper stand alone single DVD release of Rock & Rule. An audio commentary with Director Clive A. Smith is well worth listening in on, you'll learn tons and never get bored. A 22+ minute vintage making-of featurette also reveals many facts concerning the production of Rock & Rule. A short restoration comparison is included, where you can see just how great this new DVD transfer looks! Lastly is an extensive stills gallery of pre-production sketches.

Now let's talk about the special features on the 2nd disc, only available in the 2-Disc Collector's Edition. A nice collector's booklet is included featuring various interviews, artwork and photos. Perhaps the real gem is the alternate Canadian version of Rock & Rule presented here in fullscreen format. The main differences are that a different actor was used to voice Omar, much of the dialogue is more risque, and it runs a few minutes longer in the credits. The original negatives for this version were lost in a fire and the best remaining print source was used, so the quality is sometimes not too great and has imperfections, yet it's well worth watching. Also included is ""The Devil And Daniel Mouse"", an earlier half-hour animation piece, which was the inspiration for Rock & Rule. Next is another lengthy making-of featurette about the production of ""The Devil And Daniel Mouse"". Next we have a 12+ minute workprint version of the end of Rock & Rule with various scenes in rough form. There's also a short workprint title sequence containing the alternate ""Ring Of Power"" title name of Rock & Rule. Included are two trailers, one being for Rock & Rule. Another extensive stills gallery is included again on this disc. Lastly, if you have a DVD-ROM drive on your computer you can pop this disc in and view the original script for Rock & Rule in Adobe PDF format.

Did I forget to mention the soundtrack? With performances by Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Cheap Trick, Debbie Harry and Earth Wind And Fire...every song is simply excellent and stays in your head long after the movie ends. It's a real shame that this never got a full soundtrack release, since the music does for Rock & Rule what the awesome animation visuals do for the atmosphere of the film. And the effective synth score by composer Patricia Cullen (who sadly passed away) works perfectly and is often very creepy.

Even if you never had the chance to see Rock & Rule before, you almost can't go wrong if you enjoy other early 80's animation films like Heavy Metal and American Pop.",1118016000,78,3328,4.701543739279589
2251571,4,B0007YMV9W,"I remember this film from way back when. Its was the begining of my hardcore punk days, slowly transitioning from Iron Maiden and Megadeth. I remember seeing it late one night on HBO like most of my review brothers here. It struck a nerve, and had been popping up in my mind vaguely ever since. I couldn't even remember the title of the film.
I was reading my Rue Morgue magazine, low & behold there was an ad for it near the front. I recognized the cover art immediately. I had thought it was a lost treasure never to be seen or heard from again. To this day I think that new wave punk still influences my music decisions. A must buy for 80's, New Wave Punk, and cartoon fans.",1118016000,4,677,4.2153846153846155
2251572,4,B0007YMV9W,"I can't believe that it's been so long since I saw this movie! I can still sing some of the songs, remember vividly some of the scenes, and can even recite some of the lines. Not too bad for a movie that came out when I was all of 13 years old, and only available at that time on HBO.

I'm a collector mostly of anime, a cause that came upon me later in my life, but I can remember when ""The Devil And Daniel Mouse"" and ""Rock And Rule"" were very visually stunning, and incredibly entertaining. It was one of the first animations to use the technique of shining light through the cells to cause 'illumination', like for electronic displays. It was also perhaps the first time I ever heard a 'cartoon' character say ""...still, she pissed me off!"", which was rather shocking in those days.

The music was great, and still is if you can forgive an original soundtrack its 80's style. These songs were never hits so you've never really heard these songs before; but they're still good enough to be remembered twenty years later from a 13-year-old's point of view who still loves punk and new wave: ""...my name is Mok, thanks a lot..."". And yes, I'm still waiting for real live rock-video holograms to this day.

And from the point of view of an anime collector who has over 600 DVD's of the stuff, no, this will probably not be technically impressive. I didn't see anything this good again until ""Akira"" which didn't come out for five more years. What was impressive is that this little un-known movie was not created in Japan, but back here in the West and for it's time was quite creative.

Buy this movie if you want to be entertained. If you are into animation you need this film in your collection for its historical value. If you like 80's music you will find great tracks that have probably never been released anywhere else (accept Iggy Pop's ""Pain And Suffering""). The bonus ""Devil And Daniel Mouse"" is a nice extra as well.

I can't wait to see this movie again. I was afraid it was so unknown that I WOULD never see it again. It's been some twenty years and I can still see this movie when I close my eyes. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have.",1116979200,3,2156,4.353233830845771
2251573,4,B0007YMV9W,"I cannot be fully trusted to review this film. It has a great deal of sentimental value for me. I give it four stars but anyone watching it for the first time today just might not get it. It's a real early 80s treat. You've got the post apocolyptic stuff, the music, the hair, the language and images popping up from a point a moment in the past that is not likely to survive in our popular imagination the way ""the 60s"" or

""the 50s"" have. Even now when we think of ""the 80s,"" its like some trip to the mall. We tend to forget just how scared of nuclear war we were back then and just how much this influenced our movies. Rock and Rule was definitely one of those animated films that had that fear and tortured hopefulness as its source material.

I saw Rock and Rule for the first time back in 1986,late at night on HBO. It has just stuck with me ever since as a great piece of entertainment in the same vein as Wizards, Heavy Metal or Fritz the Cat. It's not hipster cool, it's more geek hipster fun. The music is so cool it almost defies explanation.  What other film has Lou Reed, Debra Harry, Iggy Pop, Cheap Trick, and Earth Wind and Fire... they all make this movie go from about a C- to a A- without trying too hard.

There is a version of Debbie Harry's Maybe for Sure that is sung at the end of the movie once Angel and Omar figure out that they are two halves of the same whatever lovey dovey stuff you want to stick in here. But the song Rules. Ultimately, if there is a message in this flick, it's not all that important, but it would be that love is more important than the spotlight and that Rock and Roll will probably live on long after humanity is dead and animals have mutated into peole like us but with funny noses.

Writers always seem to be better at the evil that leads to the build-up, than they are at the good that leads to the denouement.  So, don't let the critics fool you--this is easily as much worth your time as most anything else.

I'm a big fan of good animation, and I especially love how GRITTY this movie is, the animation is very Don Bluth, as others have said, recalls The Secret of Nihm and the Rescuers in animation style. It was put out around the same time as Heavy Metal, which is one possible reason it tanked in Box office, which is a damn shame because I've seen Heavy Metal and I was not impressed. The history surrounding this film is fun to learn, there was a fire years ago and they lost some sound footage, they spent a TON of money and almost sank Nelvana for this film with almost n return, it took years, production started in like, 1979, and the film was out in 1983. There is a Canadian version and American version, two voice actors playing Omar, slightly different ending but nothing that throws the story out too much. I grew up watching this movie. We had it on tape, the tape had commercials for the 1980 something Olympics as I recall.

The story might seem campy to some, it rests on classic themes and tropes, but in my opinion it is TIMELESS. It's very 80's but I watched it in the 90's too, and watch it to this day. Honestly, when watching it it makes my heart ache for a era of movies that was before my time, but luckily still stands in history. What may seem campy to some, to me is rather raw and sincere. There is NOTHING I don't like about this film. It's a lost JEWEL of a movie. And you can't imagine how happy I was when I got it on DVD. My tape player died ages ago.",1493510400,,1634,4.138364779874214
8054101,4,B0007YMV9W,"After I purchased, watched, and reviewed ""Wizards,"" Amazon suggested this movie for my consideration.  I'd heard a few things about it thanks to the Internet, but given that this film is pretty rare and largely forgotten save by a devoted fanbase that considers it a cult classic, my knowledge of it was pretty incomplete.  Further research, however, intrigued me -- it was one of the first full-length animated films to come out of Canada, and subject to cuts, controversy, and a painfully limited release in the US and elsewhere in the world.  And TV Tropes called the film ""gloriously insane,"" which just piqued my curiosity.  And while I won't say that this is a favorite film or even one I'll watch repeatedly, it's an amazing piece of animation history, and deserves more recognition.

""Rock and Rule"" takes place in a post-apocalyptic future, one where the aging rock star Mok Swagger seeks to rule and show his power over the masses by summoning a powerful demon.  But to accomplish this, he needs a voice that can sing the spell that will open the portal... and he finds said voice in the grimy city of Ohmtown, where a struggling rock band seeks to make it big.  Omar, the snarky and arrogant leader of the band, is suspicious of Mok's sudden interest in their band... a suspicion that's justified when Mok abducts Angel, his girlfriend and keyboardist.  Omar and his bandmates, the nervous but loyal Dizzy and the idiotic but well-meaning Stretch, journey to Mok's headquarters in Nuke York, where they must face Mok's minions and the deranged rock star himself to save Angel... and stop an evil ritual that could summon forces capable of destroying the world...

If the above concept doesn't sound insane enough to you, it adds one other aspect -- the entire cast is made up of animal people.  The Canadian version of the film doesn't explain this, but the US version justifies it by claiming that a devastating war wiped out humankind and dogs, cats, and rats evolved and took over the ravaged world.  It doesn't have much bearing on the plot and seems to merely be a stylistic choice, but if you just roll with it and accept it as an artistic quirk, you'll be fine.

The animation in this film is superb -- I'd put it on par with most Disney films of the time.  It's fluid, the character designs are well-done (if a bit grotesque at times), and it gives us some truly astounding visuals at times.  This film is also one of the earliest animated films to use computer-animated graphics, making it a milestone in animated film history.  There are a few characters who look to be rotoscoped rather than full-on animated (Omar, Mok, and Angel), but thankfully it's well-done enough that it's not nearly as blatant as the rotoscoping in, say, ""Wizards"" or Ralph Bakshi's ""Lord of the Rings.""  And be warned -- there are some VERY trippy and even deranged visuals at times.

The story itself is pretty cheesy -- two teenagers out to use the power of rock to save a world of animal-people from a rock-musician/mad sorcerer.  But the movie has a charm that's hard to deny, and is a LOT of fun to watch.  Omar can be a little unlikable, but he improves as the film goes on, and Angel isn't the usual damsel in distress but uses trickery and quick thinking to try to escape her predicament.  Mok is a deliciously-insane villain who's quite hammy and fun to watch (and is an obvious caricature of Mick Jagger and/or Steve Tyler, with some of David Bowie's mannerisms mixed in), and both Mok's henchmen and Omar's bandmates add comic relief of their own.

The soundtrack is fantastic as well.  If you enjoy early-80s rock music, you'll get a kick out of the soundtrack of this film, which features contributions from Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, Cheap Trick, Debbie Harry (from the band Blondie), and Earth, Wind, and Fire.  I dearly wish there was a soundtrack album available, though sadly this is no longer possible thanks to some of the original recordings being erased...

WARNING for parents -- this film is NOT for kids!  Despite being animated and starring a cast of Disney-esque animal people, this film contains swearing, sexual references, nudity, and drug use.  Use caution before giving it to your kids to watch.

Much like ""Wizards,"" I don't know how often I'll rewatch ""Rock and Rule,"" but I enjoyed it quite a bit and respect it as a well-animated bit of animation history.  It's a shame it's been forgotten, and I'm glad to see it still has a dedicated fanbase ensuring it still gets attention.  If you like other adult-oriented animated films, such as ""Wizards"" or ""Heavy Metal,"" you'll most likely love ""Rock and Rule.""  Probably best for adults and for kids aged 13 and up.",1493164800,,4686,4.707107843137255
8054102,4,B0007YMV9W,"An unduly forgotten, animated Canadian film, Rock and Rule will go to some lengths in getting you your Ralph Bakshi, Heavy Metal, fix. With some well realized post apocalyptic landscapes, great character designs, a pulpy story line, and some fun music, Rock and Rule definitely deserves more attention from animation aficionados. The tone can be uneven in fleeting moments with a certain character duo that really felt forced, plus an odd timeskip in the film that makes it feel unfinished but otherwise the film is a real gem! Strongly recommended for animation fans.",1491436800,,568,5.118279569892473
