The film begins in London at night. Suddenly the lights go out due to a power failure. Could a simple substance like silicon dioxide sabotage a big city? A blackout in peacetime? Will the patrons of the cinema get their money back? Mr. Verloc seems unconcerned. He is the owner operator of this small business, its not a big corporation. Is the grocer next door too interested in the cinema? Do terrorists stir up trouble at home so people ignore foreign news? Or is that how the news is played. Verloc meets his controller who asks him to leave a ""parcel"" at Piccadilly Circus to terrorize the population. Ted befriends Mrs. Verloc and her son at a restaurant. Verloc is under surveillance, they know who he meets and where he goes. The talk in the movie is meant to be ironic.

Ted notices friends of Verloc going into the cinema. [A great place for surreptitious meetings.] Ted is known to one of the conspirators, the operation is cancelled. [Undercover operatives should never be part of official operations.] Ted returns to question Mrs. Verloc. Verloc sees this and decides to use her son to carry the ""parcel"" along with some movie reels to avoid surveillance. Stevie walks through the London crowds on his destination. A parade through the streets delays him while time marches on. [There is always the unexpected in any plan.] The suspense comes from knowing the people in the film are oblivious to the danger that is around them. There is bad news!

Verloc blames others for his actions. A cartoon serves as an echo on the events. A mistake leads to rough justice, Verloc will not talk about this conspiracy. Ted and Mrs. Verloc have bonded. The police arrive to arrest the bomb maker and Verloc, but do not succeed. The film tries to create a happy ending; it doesn't work. This story about terrorists with bombs is not obsolete today. This film is adapted from Joseph Conrad's ""The Secret Agent"". Was the novel better? Plots by anarchists were a danger from the end of the 19th century. Was there a similar threat in more recent times? Note the very large crowd scenes, you won't see this in later movies.

Perhaps you should know the background of this time (the Great Depression, the growing power of fascist movements) to best appreciate this story. Hitchcock's later films were better (less censorship?). Note his recurring interest in films about people who are not as they seem.",1428364800,,2418,4.75
