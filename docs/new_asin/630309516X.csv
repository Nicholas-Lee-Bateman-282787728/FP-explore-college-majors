571029,5,630309516X,I am not a WCW mark by all means I am a WWF mark but this tape is the best WCW pay per view I have ever seen.  And for the price of 8.99 it is well worth it.  You got Austin vs Muta Pillman vs Regal.  The street fight and  Sting and Rude.  Hell even the Boss and Vader was great.  You notice how  Nick Bockwinkle took his stick and cuffs.  Because I think it was because  that gimmick was used in WWF.  Well anyway this is a great tape.  And the  main event Steamboat vs Flair ending in a weird way just watch it and see.  If you seen them fight at Clash of the champions 6 it ended the same way.  What happened to WCW because this card was great booking.  Well worth best  ppv of 94 next to Wrestlemania X,935798400,,706,3.798611111111111
571030,4,630309516X,"The undercard was pretty good, but the big selling point of Spring Stampede 94' is definitely Steamboat vs. Flair.  This is one of Flair's most masterful performances...and the ending of this long, hard fought  match is incredible.  It's worth buying just for the Steamboat vs. Ric  Flair match.",923270400,,295,5.083333333333333
571031,5,630309516X,"Great matches throughout the tape. Flair vs. Steamboat was a classic 30 minute main event that captivates you with it's controversial ending. The chicago street fight with the Nasty Boys against Cactus Jack and Maxx Payne  is 5 star material alone. Finally, the Sting and Rick Rude match is pure  excitement. I got so involved in this tape, forgetting that it's nearly 5  years old!",923270400,,382,4.846153846153846
571202,5,630309516X,Solid pay per view which shows that WCW didn't need Hogan to be entertaining.  The main event is great and the rest of the card was awesome.  Great effort by everyone involved. Before the Hogan era so that should be enough for you to buy this tape.,1059350400,,248,4.25531914893617
571203,5,630309516X,"The Undercard rocked especially the Street fight between Jack/

571204,3,630309516X,"If you've never seen a Ric Flair vs. Rick Steamboat match, that is reason enough to get this tape, as the main event is another amazing classic between these two legends, albeit with a worthless finish.  What gives this tape a middle-of-the-road rating is the less than enthralling undercard.  Steve Austin vs. The Great Muta sounds excellent on paper, but the resulting match was slow and plodding, as the two men appeared to have trouble working together. Sting vs. Rick Rude has some amazing crowd heat, but the match itself was a mess, and the ""International World title"" for which they are fighting is a worthless belt. The Nasty Boys vs. Cactus Jack and Maxx Payne has potential, but the ending is out of nowhere and the crowd is dead since they cannot see the action (falls count anywhere) for long stretches. As for the rest - DDP vs. Johnny B. Badd? The Boss(man) vs. Vader? A TV title match between Steven Regal and Brian Pillman where they are obviously stalling for the draw? Boring.  If you can get your hands on either Chi-Town Rumble '89, Clash of the Champions VI, or WrestleWar '89, you can see far better Flair/Steamboat matches, but otherwise that is the only really good reason to buy this tape.",997056000,,1215,4.668224299065421
571205,5,630309516X,"WCW's innaugural Spring Stampede PPV was headlined by Ric Flair vs. Rick Steamboat. NEED I SAY MORE? This is a totally mind blowing PPV. Flair and Steamboat have yet another classic battle that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Also on this tape, Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne battle the Nasty Boys in one of my personal favorite matches of all time. Hardcore before hardcore was cool. The only dissapointment on the tape is the Austin/Muta match (I had high expectations, but the match didn't live up to them). But other than that, Spring Stampede is a must have for any true fan. To make a long story short (Jacques Rougeu rules!), BUY THIS TAPE!",996451200,,650,4.516949152542373
571206,5,630309516X,"Sure its only ten bucks, but this is probably one of the best WCW titles ever heres a run-down of some highlights.
The infamous cactus jack and maxx paine battle the nasty boys in a street fight, during which the nastys throw cactus off a ramp and he land rather harshly on the concrete, like cactus's luck isn't bad enough they then hit him in the head with a shovel, its one of those things you rewind over about 4 times.
steve austin and the great muta battle to a DQ, but suprisingly its a amazing 5 star match, which austin looks incredible.
bunkhouse buck and dustin rhodes in a no rules strap whatever, its pretty good, but not great.
rick rude and sting battle for the nwa strap in probably the best match of the ppv, with a after match brawl between rude and vader in the locker room.
steamboat and flair is one of the best works in history, not as good as there 1989 match but, its just about.
This video is a must have for any old school ""smart"" wrestling fan and common its only ten bucks, how can you beat a deal like that?",995673600,,1036,4.211055276381909
571207,5,630309516X,"I've heard people say that this was WCW's finest pay-per-view of all time. I don't know if I would go that far, but I do admit that there were many highlights and many strong matches. In the main event, Ricky Steamboat challenges WCW Champion Ric Flair in Chicago (the same city that Steamboat dethroned Flair in 5 years prior). As always, the two put on a classic wrestling bout in which Flair plays the heel (although not a strong heel). In other bouts, Sting and Rick Rude battle for the International World title...Brian Pillman takes on TV Champion Lord Steven Regal...Dallas Page faces Johnny B. Badd...and in a match that was almost voted match of the year - the Nasty Boys take on Cactus Jack and Maxx Payne in a Chicago Street fight! Shovels, broken tables, etc! Better than any ""hardcore"" matches in either the WWF or WCW is putting on now. Steve Austin takes on the challenge of the Great Muta in a fantastic battle for the United States title. Overall a very strong card. Recommended.",979084800,4,996,4.632768361581921
571208,4,630309516X,The highlight of this tape is a classic battle between World Champ Ric Flair & Rick Steamboat. These guys put on a wrestling clinic in an era of body-builders who cant go for more than ten minutes and cant wrestle to  begin with. Other notable matches are Sting vs the late Rick Rude & an  excellent street-fight between the Nasty Boys & Cactus Jack & Maxx  Payne.,961545600,,364,4.402985074626866
571209,5,630309516X,This was the best event of 1994. There is brawling and excellent wrestling throughout the whole event. Loved the match between Austin and the Great Muta. Best match of the night was the awesome street fight between Cactus  Jack and Payne against the Nasty Boys. Bunkhouse match between Dustin  Rhodes and Bunkhouse was awesome. Title match between Flair and Steamboat  was a 45 minute wrestling classic. Awesome tape!,943747200,,417,5.102941176470588

7838973,5,630309516X,"The Johnny B. Badd-Diamond Dallas Page match was not great but pretty good. The TV title match between Lord Steven Regal & Brian Pillman was entertaining & fun to watch even with the 15 minute draw ending. The Chicago Streetfight for the World Tag Team title between The Nasty Boys against the team of Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne was a hateful,sadistic,intense & hardcore brawl. The US title match between ""Stunning"" Steve Austin & The Great Muta was mostly boring but the last minutes of that match were pretty good with a old school finish to boot. The International title match between Sting & Rick Rude was so-so at best. The Bunkhouse match between Dustin Rhodes & Bunkhouse Buck was a good brawl to say the least even with the phoned-in finish. The Vader-The Boss match was a stiff,back-and-forth bout. The Worlds title match between Ricky Steamboat & Ric Flair was a great,back-and-forth,awesome bout.

7838974,5,630309516X,"it might sound strange but when i was younger here in Quebec we only had WWF on tv, but sometimes i had the chance to see on pay per view WCW event. i remember once that michael hayes said that he thought wcw was better in quality than wwf at the time. i must admit he was right after seeing this spring stampede 1994, i mean if you watch some of the event of the wwf that year in 1994 it isn't that great. i can't put my finger but wcw had that little something wwf did not have. i don't know how to put it but i really like the action, maybe it was faster, more aerial, they even had what we now call hardcore match before wwf had those. so anyway that vhs is really entertaining and fun to watch. i'm not scare at all to recommend that tape. maybe i should say that because some of those wrestler's we're unknow to me at that time it was exciting to see a different style compare to wwf.

7838975,5,630309516X,"Thanks to finding an old tape online, I was able to review what many fans claimed to be the best card of 1994 in WCW Spring Stampede. This event featured so many highlights whether it came to wrestling clinics, street fights, and old feuds restarting or even grudge matches. The biggest one of them all was the main event in which WCW Champion Ric Flair goes up against Ricky Steamboat in the same building that started their classic series of matches back in 1989 (which for those history fans, Steamboat won the last time they were in this building).

Johnny B. Badd vs Diamond Dallas Page. This was just a short opener that was more about getting the crowd pumped up for the rest of the show which in that case, succeeded since these two would go on to have better matches for the Television Championship a year later.

WCW Television Champion Lord Steven Regal vs Brian Pillman. Speaking of wrestling clinics, this was one of them but not the kind of wrestling clinic that we were used to seeing at this time. These two worked on a stiff ground game with Regal using various submission holds to ground Pillman including some holds that we hadn't seen before. They battled to the time limit draw but this was just a great mat wrestling match from bell to bell.

Street Fight: WCW Tag Team Champions Nasty Boys vs Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne. In less than a year, Cactus went from a main event feud with Vader to carrying Payne as a team to battle the Nasty Boys. This match is regarded as one of the stiffest matches in WCW's history as these four were not going to go easy on each other & were brawling all over the arena with moments like the merchandise stand getting destroyed, various tables getting destroyed, canes being used & Cactus taking a sick fall off the ramp followed by a full-ledged shot to the face with a shovel while on the ground.

WCW United States Champion ""Stunning"" Steve Austin vs The Great Muta. The return of the Great Muta here since the last time he was seen was when he lost the NWA Title at SuperBrawl III.  Austin worked a much more technical style during his ""stunning"" days & this was no exception as both men worked a nice ground game with the momentum picking up time after time. The ending was a little disappointing but it didn't take away from what was a solid encounter between both men.

WCW International Heavyweight Champion Rick Rude vs Sting. For those wanting to know the story behind the ""International"" title then I recommend checking out DP's review on this event as he explained in detail why it was called that but for those long time fans, it was really just the ""big gold"" NWA belt (currently the WWE's World Heavyweight Championship). Harley Race came out before the match to issue a challenge on behalf of Vader to the winner before being nailed by Sting to start the match. From there, this was an exciting contest that went back & forth as Rude tried his best to ground Sting but Sting just kept bringing the fight to Rude & showcased his power various times. Vader would make an appearance later on with Harley Race that became a big factor in the outcome to this one.

Bunkhouse Match: Dustin Rhodes vs Bunkhouse Buck. This was just a fancy way of calling this match a street fight as these two just brawled & used weapons like cowboy boot, a belt,  & even dirt with the Col. Parker getting whipped as well for interfering. Both men were busted open but gave it their all in what was a good brawl to watch.

Vader vs The Boss. Due to the Boss costing Vader the title at SuperBrawl IV, this was hyped as a grudge match. The action didn't even start in the ring as the Boss went after Vader on the ramp before Harley Race got hit once again due to a mistake by Vader. This was a good match overall as both men used power moves & even went a bit stiff with their brawling but the real highlight of this match was the impressive moonsault done by Vader. However the aftermath featured The Boss getting the last laugh as he attacked Vader & Race with his nightstick resulting in Commissioner Nick Bockwinkel taking his cuffs, nightstick & even stripping him of his name.

WCW Champion Ric Flair vs Ricky Steamboat. For the first time since their Wrestle War '89 clash, these two legends do battle here & put on another classic back & forth wrestling clinic. Both men worked on each other's legs at certain points of the match with Flair showing some traits as to why he was called ""the dirtiest player in the game."" This match lived up to the billing but I really won't compare it to their previous trilogy of matches as it would be too difficult to compare this one to those but this one is certainly worth your time with the ending being very similar to how their 2 out of 3 falls contest in '89 ended.

The bottom line was that this was one of WCW's best overall cards as this event was just full of quality performances whether it came to wrestling or just brawling. I would go out of my way to see this one as it was one of the last WCW events before the Hogan era of WCW.",1298592000,,5032,4.4
7838976,5,630309516X,"The greatest pro wrestling match ever fought based on skill was/is Flair vs. Steamboat. 45 minutes of technical magic with limited fighting. Hogan vs. Andre or the Warrior sold more tickets due to hype, but true pro wrestling fans agree: Flair vs. Steamboat is the best match EVER. Steiners vs. Doom is also included and that's for starters! Easily one of the best events in wrestling ever! A must have for pro wrestling fans!",1291766400,,426,4.77027027027027
7838977,5,630309516X,"Once again, thanks to WWE 24/7 (now called ""Classics On Demand"")...I got to relive a classic WCW PPV in Spring Stampede '94.  This event was headlined by WCW Champion Ric Flair vs. Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat in a rematch from their classic series of matches that actually began in the same city (Chicago) almost 5 years earlier.  This PPV would also feature two different types of street fights, a grudge match which we would see WWE (then WWF) play a submininal part in, the return of an international favorite, another classic feud revisited, and the last in-ring PPV appearence of a man who's without a doubt one of the greatest heels off all time.

Johnny B. Badd vs. Diamond Dallas Page - Around 18 months before they're more famous feud over the Television Championship, they locked up here in the opening match which was real short & nothing noteworthy but did it's job in firing up the crowd.

Television Champion Lord Steven Regal vs. Brian Pillman - In my opinion, the WCW Television Championship made the career of the man we know now as William Regal and this match is an example of why.  Regal gave a different wrestling clinic than we were used to seeing at this time as he grounded & pounded Pillman for most of the match which made Pillman wrestle a different defensive style than we were used to seeing from him along with him showcasing his quick offense throughout the match as well.  They went to the time limit draw as was the usual case with Regal's title defenses but this was a solid wrestling match.

Street Fight Match: WCW Tag Team Champions Nasty Boys vs. Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne - They fought through the merchandise stand, in & out the ring, on & off the rampway with various weapons like a pool cue, a shovel & a table.  This was one of the ""stiffest"" matches I've ever seen as these guys were legitlity brawling & hitting each other to the point where Cactus get his head cracked with a shovel on the floor.  One of the most ""hardcore"" matches in WCW's history.

WCW United States Champion Steve Austin vs. Great Muta - For the first time in over a year, The Great Muta returns to WCW.  This was very similar to the Television Championship match earlier in that this was both men working more of a ground mat game against each other with various submission holds being used.  This was a different type of Steve Austin that people who only known him as ""Stone Cold"" has seen.

WCW International Heavyweight Champion Ravishing Rick Rude vs. Sting - Before I get started, for those who don't remember the story behind this championship...this was the ""big gold belt"" (currently referred to as the World Heavyweight Championship in WWE) that was originally the NWA Championship but when the NWA pulled out of WCW for the last time, WCW owned the belt and just renamed it but kept the status of it being a World Championship.
Now before the match, Harley Race issued a challenge on behalf of Vader to the winner before Sting clocked him with a punch.  Just like their past matches, this was a back & forth encounter between each other with Race & Vader getting involved which led to Sting once again winning the World Championship in what is my second favorite encounter between these two only surpassed by their ""King Of Cable"" semi-final match from Nov. 1992.  Unfortunally, this would be the last in-ring PPV appearence of Rick Rude as he would suffer a career ending neck injury within the next month.

Bunkhouse Match: Dustin Rhodes vs. Bunkhouse Buck - For those wondering what a bunkhouse match is, it's really just a ""down south"" street fight.  This is what Jim Ross would call a slugfest as it was a brawl between both men to the point where Rhodes used his own boot & was busted open at different points, Buck had the shirt beaten off of him throughout the match, and even Col. Parker got whipped for his troubles.  A good brawl overall.

The Boss vs. Vader - This was a grudge match based off Vader blaming The Boss for him losing the match against Vader at the previous SuperBrawl PPV.  They got started brawling on the ramp while Race got nailed for the second time in the night.  From there this was a good ""big man"" match with both guys hitting power moves against each other while Vader showed why he was one of the best big men in the business at that time performing moves like his Vadersault (moonsault from the top rope).
After the match, The Boss attacked Race & Vader with his nightstick which resulted in Commissioner Nick Bockwinkle stripping The Boss of his nightstick, handcuffs, and identity.  For those who didn't know, the real story behind Ray Traylor being stripped of his gimmick was that WWE (then WWF) had filed legal charges against WCW since their character of The Boss was an identical copy of WWE's ""Big Boss Man"" character.

WCW Champion Ric Flair vs. Ricky Steamboat - They meet in same city that started their famous trilogy around 5 years earlier. The match was a nice back & forth encounter between the two that features various ""deja vu"" moments. However, Steamboat & Flair had 5 years worth of hype & a legacy of their previous trilogy to live up to which they couldn't top in this match but it was still a classic wrestling clinic between two future Hall Of Famers here with an ending setting up a future rematch.
As a side note, their rematch (and last match against each other) took place weeks later on WCW Saturday Night instead of one of the next big WCW events.

In the end, I've always stated that the main problem with World Championship Wrestling thoughout it's run was that the wrestling quality was always somehow completely overshadowed by ""wrestlecrap"" ideas, storylines, and politics.  However, that took a backseat here and the played to their strength here in wrestling was allowed to steal the show making this a classic WCW event.  I recommend checking this one out.",1242604800,,5860,4.615976900866218

Spring Stampede is overall enjoyable, but the stand out matches are Cactus Jack and Maxx Payne vs. The Nasty Boyz (which you could see with much better quality on the Mick Foley DVD) and Flair/Steamboat. Right before Hogan came to WCW, Flair's old rivalries with Steamboat, Sting and Barry Windham were going through a renaissance in 1994 to make Hogan's eventual win over him seem greater. I love every Flair/Steamboat match so I can't say where this one ranks, but it's definitely a classic.",1109635200,,581,4.82
