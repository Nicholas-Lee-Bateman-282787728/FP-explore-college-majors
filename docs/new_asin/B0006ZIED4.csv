2197609,5,B0006ZIED4,"The man has been a master chef for decades and has the wisdom of the ages to impart.  HIs love of food and wine is infectious and his skills, which he shares and demonstrates, freely have changed the way I cook.  His techniques are ingenious and the food is glorious.  I would never have thought to put a bit of olive oil on an ordinary glass dinner plate and roast fish in the oven upon it (Tuna Steaks, 200 degrees for 20 minutes for rare).  For those of you who are serious cooks and who feel that watching a group of people engage in a ""bake off"" or ""cook off"" is a huge waste of your time (it is), watch Jacques instead.",1399161600,3,625,4.098360655737705
2197610,5,B0006ZIED4,"I loved every moment of watching Jacques Pepin & his family prepare a Christmas feast. Master Chef Jacques makes cooking French cuisine seem less daunting & more accomplishable. He explains the difference between stocks & demi-glaces, and shows you how to make Skillet Duck with shallots/sweet potatoes/yams. YUM! I also really enjoyed the family tidbits that were added in as well. The whole tone of this special was very warm & festive. Overall, I give it a five star rating with a high recommendation. (I've already watched it twice)",1387411200,3,536,5.033707865168539
2197611,3,B0006ZIED4,"I have a few of his cookbooks, and having heard good things about him, was looking forward to seeing him live.  The menu sounded delicious, but perhaps TV isn't his medium because I was really disappointed.  As another reviewer said, the buche de noel looked awful (my grandma was no famous chef, but she made a much prettier one, complete with little meringue mushrooms growing on the trunk).  And what is the point of making a buche if you're going to sandwich it between a chocolate ""fence""?  Sadly, foie gras looked quite good but is now illegal in CA, so I won't be able to make it.  The duck ""confit"" is something I will have to try, but I was so looking forward to some tips on home-smoked salmon.  He simply sliced into one that was pre-made.  Cheater.  Anyway, this was my first time watching Pepin, hopefully next time will be one of his better videos.",1387065600,2,862,4.480769230769231
2197612,5,B0006ZIED4,We have been watching Pepin for years. He is a masterful chef and we enjoy cooking his dishes. We gave this as a present and the person loved it.,1372550400,3,145,4.0344827586206895
2197613,5,B0006ZIED4,"Second only to the recently deceased Julia Child, Pepin represents the best of French cuisine in America. The environment of the show is relaxed and encouraging, and the food looks delicious!",1359417600,2,191,5.193548387096774
2197614,5,B0006ZIED4,"but jacques pepins food looks HORRIBLE. the yule log that he and his daughter made looked like a train wreck! and everything looks so old and dated. lol. but we still love you jacques! oh, and i love the way that the whole family was feeling up the snowman. what was that all about?!",1345507200,,283,4.2592592592592595
8044032,4,B0006ZIED4,"I picked this as a random video to watch for a Christmas movie marathon with my friend. It was a lot of fun and the food looked delicious.

However, whoever was doing the closed captioning really phoned it in. Basically every french word was written as ""[inaudible]"".",1517788800,,267,4.680851063829787
8044033,5,B0006ZIED4,I watched this on Amazon prime and Jacques Pepin's  Christmas Special is wonderful.  There are a number of clear recipes and great scenes with family.  I highly recommend this for PBS food fans and anyone else who appreciates real cooking shows',1497052800,,245,4.926829268292683
8044034,2,B0006ZIED4,I bought this as a gift and was told it wasn't as good as what they had expected.  I was sorry I purchased.,1491782400,,107,3.652173913043478
8044035,3,B0006ZIED4,I enjoyed the video but there were no recipes attached in any way.,1485734400,,66,4.153846153846154
8044036,4,B0006ZIED4,"The best part of this video is watching the family interact as they cook and (at the end) the extended family/friends have fun at the meal and celebration.  Second best is the clear explanation of the difference between stock (including how easy it is to make), demi glace, and basically homemade bouillon cubes without the salt and preservatives added.  The cooking itself is alright but this is more of a special for the season than a recipe show, I have not watched anything else with this chef and have no idea how he usually does things but if you expect actual recipes amounts be warned you won;t get them.  I have cooked for long enough that I could make the dishes without that but less experienced cooks may be a bit daunted.  I actually found it amusing that -had I been invited to the meal- I would have filled up on the lovely salmon with cucumber salad (to the side, NOT filling the salmon as in the description) and avoided the rest of the appetizers for personal reasons involving ""too much information"" about the ingredients LOL!  It was fascinating, though, to see what sort of meal would be considered Christmasy in another country.",1482278400,,1150,4.645320197044335
8044037,5,B0006ZIED4,I watched this with my Prime membership.  It was wonderful.  Jacques is so charming and entertaining and a great teacher.  A cultural experience.,1455926400,,145,5.217391304347826
8044038,5,B0006ZIED4,"Jacques Pepin is a wonderful chef and delightful to watch preparing some of his favorite Christmas dishes.  He is great at explaining the stages of cooking, and the banter between him and his daughter reveals a close, warm relationship.  The preparation of the buche de noel, foie gras, and duck are particularly interesting.",1442016000,2,325,5.113207547169812
8044039,5,B0006ZIED4,He has always been my favorite chef for as long as I can remember. He prepares food in a way that the average person can do also but still have an upscale dish. Love his shows.,1433203200,2,176,3.9166666666666665
8044040,5,B0006ZIED4,This man is the best.,1420070400,,21,3.4
8044041,5,B0006ZIED4,I greatly enjoy watching Jacques Pepin's programs. This one is very well done.,1419638400,,78,5.076923076923077
