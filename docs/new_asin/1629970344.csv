201820,1,1629970344,"Terrible presentation.  Where the producers of this series could have used an interesting variety of photos, graphs, drawings, and ""talking heads"" -- authorities who could speak on the specifics of Chinese border areas, Central Asia, and military techniques and history, instead you get a professor who utters lots of ""uhs"" and stands in an office talking to you.  Everything, especially Chinese names and place names, is mispronounced.  Do NOT get this DVD set.",1436572800,,462,5.301369863013699
7800561,5,1629970344,This professor is amazing in his range of time periods and major civilizations. He integrates the diverse times and cultures by focusing on the steppe confederations. He is superb in his knowledge. Please don't focus on mannerisms and miss his erudite studies.,1524787200,,260,5.214285714285714

7800563,5,1629970344,"This is a great course! Dr. Harl is a veritable fountain of good information and an interesting lecturer (at one point he even makes relevant movie recommendations). You have to realize that this isn't a documentary, it's a series of lectures with maps and pictures projected over the screen from time to time. The course is easily as good as the best ones I took in college, & made even better by the excellent overview provided in the accompanying booklet. I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",1470009600,,531,4.659574468085107
7800564,5,1629970344,"This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
When watching the first lecture, I thought I had made a mistake ordering this course. The lecturer was stiff and stilted, and his frequent use of ""um"" and ""ah"" were irritating, to say the least. However, in the interest of fairness, I decided to continue through lecture 2. I'm glad I did! The picture's style didn't improve, but I stopped noticing it because the subject matter was so interesting. So he's not an actor? Big deal. This guy knows his subject matter and obviously enjoys this subject enough to make it fascinating.
I bought this course to review for potential homeschooling in the high school years, and I planned to watch the lectures while folding clothes. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm actually looking forward to doing laundry tomorrow! I definitely recommend this title to anyone interested in the history of these nomadic empires and the cultures they influenced. (Spoiler alert: they pretty much influenced EVERYONE!)",1464825600,3,1032,5.005813953488372
7800565,5,1629970344,"I got this about a week ago, and though I am not done with it, I can tell you that it is amazing and fascinating. If you are the kind of person who really thirsts for knowledge, this program is for you! It has real-world relevancy as well, comparing some of the strategies to the middle east today. The course puts a lot of things in place, including the Huns and the Mongols, which many of us know a bit about, but this really carries it through. It entwines things like the background of 1001 Arabian nights, to Genghis Khan and so much more. But it's not just about war and fighting - it's very thorough on the cultural history as well. The program may seem expensive, but when you consider that this is the equivalent (or better) of a top professor teaching at a top college, the value is pretty impressive. This would make an amazing Fathers Day (or any other) gift for someone who likes history!  I did receive this item at a discount for my unbiased review. Please understand that this system helps YOU - I test it out and tell you the truth - good or bad.  Please click yes if my review was helpful!",1464480000,6,1107,4.291866028708134
7800566,3,1629970344,"From my current collection of the Great Courses this one is pretty hefty in content...there are a lot to talk about. It is a solid course but improvements can definitely be made. The sheer amount of content is a challenging endeavor for any professor but might benefit from extending the series to a few more lectures to avoid information overload. Presentation and preparation could have been done better since he says 'uh's a lot...its up to the viewer but it might annoy some. People also complained about the butchered pronunciations...again, its up to the viewer but it did not bother too much but did make things a little bit awkward. In conclusion, its a solid set but the flaws are apparent, more so than other sets.

I received this product at a discount in return for an honest review",1464393600,,794,4.712230215827338
7800567,5,1629970344,I am excited to have a learn at my own pace program that is exploring a topic in which I am so unversed! What an incredible opportunity to gain knowledge in an effortless format!  I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.,1464307200,,252,4.361702127659575
7800568,5,1629970344,Excellent presentation from a professor with an encyclopedic memory.  Incredible.  Great resource for anyone who wants to make sense of history.,1454112000,,144,5.809523809523809

7800570,4,1629970344,"Kenneth Harl is not exactly a riveting lecturer, but his knowledge of the field is impressive -- even if he butchers the pronounciation of every other name. But what stood out to me in this series of lectures was the insight I gained into a culture that we tend to dismiss as cruel and lacking intellectual heft.

First, Harl makes it clear that the wave upon wave of nomads who came out of the steppes were the greatest warriors in the world for at least 4,000 years. The culture that created them was harsh, cruel (by our standards) and not particularly innovative -- but why innovate when you win every battle and defeat those who supposedly are your ""superiors""?

Also, Americans are generally unfamiliar with Eastern history, and especially that of the steppes. I had never heard of the Xiongnu (a nomadic people) before this series, and my grasp of Tamerlane and his impact on the modern world was limited at best. It would have been very helpful if the 450-page book that accompanies the 18 CDs had some detailed maps, as I was forced to spend some time with an atlas to figure out exactly where the Tarim Basin is, and what Transoxiana means, but otherwise I finished listening to this series filled with knowledge I had not had before -- and a much greater respect for the ""barbarians"" who bested their ""betters"" in battle for centuries until firearms finally overcame their advantages.",1443225600,8,1395,4.713114754098361
