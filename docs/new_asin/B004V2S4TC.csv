4481261,2,B004V2S4TC,I have watched this show in widescreen on satellite. Why buy a DVD with half the picture missing??? This does not make sense! Offer a widescreen DVD or Blu and then I'll buy! The show in widescreen gets 5 stars.,1309564800,4,211,4.3

4481266,5,B004V2S4TC,"My kids love this show and, I must confess, I find it very entertaining as well. At first I was disappointed with my daughter's taste for liking it but then I sat down a watched a few episodes with her. At times I found myself laughing out loud - which is extremely rare in today's television offerings. I soon discovered that BTR was well aware of the boy-band stereotypes and just ran with it. There is the ""pretty one"", the ""smart one"", etc. but they have no issue poking fun at the stereotypes and each other. You get the feeling that these are genuinely nice people who enjoy each other's company. Again, very refreshing from Hollywood. For older ones like me, it's a modern ""Monkees"" type show with thoroughly likable characters but much better writing. A lot of the songs are catchy too.",1410480000,2,794,4.559440559440559
4481267,5,B004V2S4TC,"I have seen the reruns but always seem to miss the first episode.  This DVD enabled me to view it.  I enjoy the youthful vitality of the guys, the dancing, the episodes, and of course the songs!",1391385600,,194,4.216216216216216
4481268,5,B004V2S4TC,It was the perfect gift for my nephew he loves anything Big Time Rush and everything that I ordered was perfect. The packages arrived fast.,1387843200,,139,4.6
4481269,5,B004V2S4TC,"My daughter would watch the entire dvd in one afternoon if I would let her.  She has seen every episode, but loves that she can pick and choose which ones to watch again and again.  The show may be a little goofy at times, but it is good, clean fun, which is hard to find for any age.",1383955200,,284,3.8793103448275863
4481270,5,B004V2S4TC,"As a 64 yr old married woman, this keeps me young watching and following the careers of these guys.  Would highly recommend this DVD.",1380412800,3,133,4.541666666666667

4481272,3,B004V2S4TC,"I got this mainly for my 9 year-old daughter, but I usually watch the show with her.  There are some pretty funny moments in each episode.  The guys are cute and clean though not always believable, but the show's not supposed to be completely believable.
When I first saw the program, I was reminded of the 1960's T.V. show ""The Monkees"" which featured a young male pop/rock group and their mad-cap adventures.  I told my daughter about that and reminded her that there's not much in entertainment that hasn't been done before.
I have no problems with my daughter being a fan.  I'm taking her to their concert for the 2nd time this summer.",1371081600,2,639,4.578947368421052

4481287,5,B004V2S4TC,"This show reminds me of a modern-day Monkees (dating myself, I know!).  It's about 4 young boys that want to be a big-time group and the antics they get into trying to achieve it.  It's mostly good-humored fun, although for the younger viewers (age 4-8), it would be nice to leave off some of the kissing scenes ;-  Nonetheless, I enjoy watching it with my boys, and having a good laugh at their sound-effected spoofs, with the great catchy tunes and not-too-shabby looking Big Time dudes.  Keep up the good work!",1317254400,,513,4.604395604395604
