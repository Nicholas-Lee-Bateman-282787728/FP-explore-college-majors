8544228,5,B009THB7MA,1933 Low Budget B-Western ... Big Rex Bell fan so I really enjoyed this one ... Lot of Fun! Bell often pauses a few seconds before delivering his lines ... does same in all his films. Suspect he was reading the Cue Cards being held by an assistant director. If you like old B-Westerns ... you'll love this one!,1482364800,,310,4.271186440677966
8544229,5,B009THB7MA,"If you love old Westerns, and I have been on a Rex Bell kick recently... this is a great film. Don't expect major studio production quality. This kind of independent studio created Westerns in the 1930s as if they were shot in someone's back yard. But they are fun and Rex Bell is a great actor -- not the caliber of John Wayne, but an enjoyable Western nonetheless.",1370217600,,366,4.397058823529412
