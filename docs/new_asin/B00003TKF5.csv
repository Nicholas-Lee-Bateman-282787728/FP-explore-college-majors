1332880,5,B00003TKF5,"This film is a wonderful portrayal of librarians as the heroes of the film.  The staff is portrayed as extremely resourceful, able to find anything in a non-computerized collection, and extremely creative at piecing together information.  In order to convince the new owner that the collection is worth saving, the librarians assemble a series of stories linked to various photographs--a sort of librarian's Sheharazade.
One of my favorite scenes is where Marilyn, the head librarian, is showing the new owner a set of photographs of a young Jewish girl that were found from different parts of the collection, in the hopes of convincing him of the value of keeping the library intact.  Marilyn narrates Lilly's story, showing the happy child with her parents, then being separated from her parents and sent to live with a non-Jewish family during the Holocaust era.  She is allowed to reunite with her parents for a morning in a park, and the photos capture the love between the parents and child, the despair of their separation, and the terrible sense of fear of that era.  The story and the surprise ending are intensely moving and will leave you with an Anne Frank type of ache in your heart.
The final story of the movie that the librarians ingeniously weave together is a series of photographs involving the owner's Irish grandmother (and mysterious stories from her past that have a huge impact on him).
I really appreciated the great character development which allowed each of the librarians to be seen as individuals with unique quirks and their own brand of British humor.  This film proves that even in this computerized world, the power of the human intellect and the beauty of vintage still photography are not dusty relics to be kept on a shelf, but are vibrant ways of preserving our past and linking lives together.  There are a lot of genres here in this film that you won't find mixed together elsewhere:  mystery/suspense, librarianship, historical preservation, photography, and themes of ancestry.
Hats off to writer/director Stephen Poliakoff for such an accurate portrayal of the analytical and intellectual abilities of librarians, as well as for the most suspenseful film about a library that I've ever seen.",979689600,26,2234,5.018918918918919
1332881,5,B00003TKF5,"I can't add much to the previous reviews other than to say that I too found this movie of spell-binding interest through to the last moment. I had originally intended to watch it over two evenings. However, once started, I couldn't put it away. Absolutely spectacular performances by the entire cast! It is a stunning fictional story written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff weaved in conjunction with actual photographs from the Hulton Getty Photograph Collection. The story gives deeper meaning to the value of what has come before us. This is a MUST HAVE film for any photography, history, and/or mystery buff. Poliakoff deserves significant praise for this stupendous film. I sincerely hope it will be considered for numerous awards.",978739200,4,738,5.158333333333333
1332882,5,B00003TKF5,"I bought this 2 video set expecting it to be good.  It was much, much better than good! The stories that are told to the corporate man who wants to destroy this photo collection from the past are incredible.  There is  one, involving an ancestor of this man's, that will keep you spellbound as  he sees and hears the story of that ancestor unfold picture by picture.  The pictures themselves are also gorgeous. Actually, this is very close to  being a mystery since the goal is to unveil the man's past through photos  to convince him the past, in general, is worth saving through saving all of  the photos.  There are 10 million photos in this collection! If you like  English historical romances, this is one presented in a very unique way.  The story is set in the present but the photos are from those prior  romantically imagined times. This would have been made into a video only in  Britain.  I cannot imagine we Americans ever turning a subject like this  into a movie, unfortunately.

1332883,5,B00003TKF5,"I cannot recommend this too highly. My initial thoughts on sitting down to ""Shooting the past"" was ""Hmmmmm - Chick Flick"". How wrong I was!
""Shooting the past"" tells the story of an English  photo collection facing closure by an American corporation. The story of  the struggle for the collection to be kept together, combined with the  amazing stories linked to the photographs themselves kept me rivetted to  the screen until the last moment.
It was written and directed by Stephen  Poliakoff and he has just excelled himself. The settings and Music are *so*  atmospheric, and this is combined with sterling performances from [get  this] *every member of the cast!*.

Each character is unique.  The story of the massive and unique  photograph collection is amazing in itself. But the stories within the  stories, as told to the mean American who threatens to destroy the photo  collection are the real jewels. As the film unfolds we are drawn onto the  black and white photos in the collection. We see the body of photographs as  a whole for thier special beauty.

Timothy Spall is a wonderful actor, and Lindsay Duncan is at the top of her game.  My next mission is to find a copy of the equally impressive music.

1332927,5,B00003TKF5,"For those jaded by the ubiquitous and mostly banal barrage of instant images and commentary made possible by modern social media technology, this film may not resonate, which would be a shame. A cast of charming and quirky characters uses all of their low-tech wiles to thwart A US property developer who has purchased the stately London building that houses the photographic library at which they work. The new owner (played by the otherwise very able Irish actor Liam Cunningham, who nevertheless supplies what I found to be the only truly annoying element in the film -- a seriously unbelievable American accent that requires him to bite down on each word and chew through them in frustratingly slow, measured tones) has plans to renovate the property to create (yet another) executive conference center. Though he exhibits much more patience than would many developers in a similar situation, the construction schedule allows him little time to consider the fate of decades of irreplaceable collective history and personal stories captured in the library's thousands of photographs.

The ever-delightful Lindsay Duncan (with her appealingly tentative verbal delivery and butterscotch tones) plays a seemingly passive librarian who exhibits an airy-fairy evasiveness under which she discovers a steely, passionate resolve to save the archive. It would seem that the archive is not all that needs saving, as most of the library's quirky employees don't appear to have the wherewithal or the characteristics to survive in a more competitive workplace, which has us rooting for them as the underdogs, as much as for the photo collection itself. The brilliant and endearing Timothy Spall is the heart and conscience of the story, though his character also serves to illustrate that sticking your head in the sand won't stave off change, even if it doesn't necessarily represent progress. Like Lindsay Duncan's character, his cunning intelligence and resolve are underestimated, hidden behind a bumbling bonhomie. Emilia Fox brings a feisty, hip infusion of modernity and social savvy as young co-worker Spig. The venerable Billie Whitelaw rounds out the main cast of characters as the vague and aging retainer Veronica, who has been saved from inevitable redundancy by an institution which recognizes that like the collection itself, she too still has function and value.

The story isn't groundbreaking in highlighting changing times and values, but it is engagingly conveyed, and using a photo archive as its vehicle makes it very compelling. The archives represent our interconnected histories, played out on an intimate, personal level as well as on the larger socio/political stage, and its value is pitted against that of the disposable product, the quickly-assimilated experience and the ever-hungry maw of corporate commercialism. These stories are documented by the huge and priceless collection of photos (mostly black and white) covering decades of events, from the epic to commonplace, everyday moments. But it is the collective historic weight of these photographs and stories, and their meaning and worth in the modern day that is at the heart of the film. Though the subject may seem a bit heavy, this is a highly entertaining and upbeat film with its fair share of charming comic moments, and features a compelling mystery both discovered and solved with anything BUT modern technology.",1367625600,3,3401,5.33147113594041
1332928,5,B00003TKF5,"This is one of those keepers to rewatch every year or two.  This is the kind of production that the BBC does oh so well.

1332929,5,B00003TKF5,"Make sure you flip the last disc over for part 3. I thought at first that it ended with the second disc, but  it was inconceivable that could be the conclusion. When I investigated further I found that I was right.  The story set me on the edge of my seat and the actors performances were so convincing. The actor that played the part of the American reminded me of Jeff Goldblume. I had to think that way otherwise his American accent sounded contrived. Some English actors can do a good American accent and some, probably for comedy's sake, don't seem to try.",1335484800,3,561,4.436893203883495
1332930,5,B00003TKF5,"Of all the many thousands (literally) of films I've seen over the past 60 years, I would put this Stephen Poliakoff masterpiece in my top 10.  After I saw it for the 3rd time (once on TV's Masterpiece Theatre and twice on dvd) I watched the bonus features at the end of the 2nd disc.  Both Lindsay Duncan and Matthew MacFadyen commented on how Poliakoff used long scenes.  It then occurred to me that there were indeed some long scenes, but none seemed particularly long to me. These 'long' scenes were riveting. They weren't long in a Stanley Kubrick way.  Many of Kubrick's long scenes, i.e. in ""Barry Lyndon"" were not only long, but plodding and boring.  Poliakoff's 'long' scenes are interesting and engaging.  He doesn't need to resort to trickery or gimmickry.  He always gets the most from his actors.  Lindsay Duncan is incredible, as usual.  I can't wait to see what she does next.  Speaking of which, when are Poliakoff's last 3 or 4 films going to be released in the U.S. on Dvd or on TV?  Please don't deprive us.  And, how come it's almost impossible to find Adrian Johnston's musical score for ""Shooting"" on CD?

If you have ANY interest in photographs--especially black and white photos--you must see this film.  And, you will probably want to see it again and again.  Thanks, Stephen, for a great experience!",1333411200,3,1324,4.670995670995671

Their reaction to a threat (that of being either closed or thrown out) is exactly the same as that of my workplace archives; find a personal connection to the threatener. They find out where and when he was born, what his family connections are, then find an image relating to that personal history.

The way one person knows where everything is, by memory and personal skill at position location, is not completely fictional as I fulfill that function in my workplace archives.

1333006,3,B00003TKF5,"If we can all agree that cameras are now a main weapon used by the rich against the poor these days (see: surveillance cameras everywhere protecting monied interests, NYPD videotaping protestors, etc.) then we can recognize this film as a sort of fairy tale where that conventional wisdom is turned on its head. Here the good guys turn their ginormous photo collection into a retroactive Big Brother, showing the bad guy (an American businessman, how apt) all the naughty things his grandmother was up to back in the day, and in the process getting him to care about something other than money. It would never happen, I know, but I got some perverse pleasure out of watching the look on The Man's face as he was presented with pictures that he had no idea existed that proved his past was less than pious. Now does that mean that they made a convincing case that all 10 million photos in this collection should be saved? Well not to me they didn't. To hold on too tightly to the past is to make you a pack rat or overly nostalgic (something I consider myself, and trust me it is not an positive attribute), so we must shed it because as Mike Ditka might say, ""You live in the past, you die in the past.""

The story involves Christopher Anderson (Liam Cunningham), a businessman who comes to England to start a business school, only once he gets there he finds Marilyn (Lindsay Duncan) who previously owned the property and had no idea that he intended to destroy her entire photo collection. Her and her employees strike back, but as it turns out Marilyn isn't very good at blackmail or deceit. Christopher and his employees colonize the building and begin sniffing around the place like a dog in heat looking for the photos with real cash value as the rest are totally useless to them. Eventually Marilyn is given an extra week to find a home for the photos, but doing that the week of Christmas turns out to be no easy task. Meanwhile, her employee and friend Oswald (Timothy Spall), continues to play the chess game trying to save the collection and make life a little harder for Christopher along the way. That becomes a little bit more difficult for him when he is kicked off the premise for refusing to bow down to the all powerful American dollar. It is a fairly conventional Davis vs. Goliath story told in the modern world, but to its credit it never takes the obvious route. It is stuffy and respectable, but for the Masterpiece Theatre that it is, it is much more spunky than I was expecting.

I am going to recommend this film, on the condition that if you are one who suffers from short attention span syndrome you not take me up on this recommendation. Then again, if you do have that syndrome you have no business watching BBC, Masterpiece Theatre, or most anything with Timothy Spall in it anyways. Besides its strong spirit and clever use of photographs I also appreciated its refusal to tout the party line about change. Most movies will tell you that change is good and that to not change is to not adapt and that that is bad. But here they point out, correctly, that a lot of times change can bring about loss of the most profound kind. It is very nice to believe that things are always getting better, that it is always onward and upward, but a quick look around this world of ours and you will realize that change has the capacity for evil. ***1/4",1174089600,14,3369,4.503267973856209

CON - Some pacing flaws, but not enough to destroy the whole

Lindsay Duncan is perfectly cast as the guardian of this endangered photographic archive and Liam Cunningham is her well-cast, perfunctory foil. As as the story unfolds, the differences between British and American style (and culture) are revealed, providing a nice subtext to the plot.

One of the viewing pleasures is in discovering that not everything is as it appears, from the central story to the character's lives. Good actors all. But my ""best actor"" award goes to the photographs themselves: the stories they tell and the feelings they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once.  A visually rich film.",1112400000,7,731,5.075
1333010,5,B00003TKF5,"A unique library of old and modern photographs are put under threat when the building they are housed in is suddenly sold.  The new owner of the property, Liam Cunningham played by the able Christopher Anderson, has no interest in the photos and doesn't care what happens to them.  In fact most of the photos will be destroyed with the crme de la crme of the collection being sold on.  All Liam is interested in is renovating the building and making a hefty profit for the business he represents.

However the library's many eccentric employees won't give up without a fight and from then on a war of wits and determination is played out among a wonderful array of black and white photographs that represent the past, the present and even the future.

The characters in this film are truly delightful, especially Timothy Spall who plays the oddball Oswald Bates, a man with a memory for faces so attuned that he can see resemblances between a person he has only seen once and those whose pictures are imprinted upon photographic paper.

However the battle to save the collection seems doomed, with every attempt the Library staff makes being thwarted but fate has something wonderful in store for Liam Cunningham and it is this wonderful twist in the story that ultimately will save the collection for future generations.

This is a fabulous film, originally a three part series for the BBC in the late 1990s I think it would have been a success if it had been released in Art House Cinemas all over the World.

A final pointer, watch (and listen) out for the superb Lindsay Duncan who plays the diminutive Marilyn Truman, the Head Librarian in the story, she has the most amazing voice and when telling Liam Cunningham stories around certain photographs, she captivates her audience to the point that you think that you are in the same room as her and Liam.

A good musical score, a sound cast, wonderful photography and camera work, ""Shooting the Past"" is a classic of a film that Stephen Poliakoff has every reason to be proud off.

A photography librarian , Marian(Lindsay Duncan) is caught off guard when told that her collection of ten million pictures must be broken up and sold. Of course such news from the American capitalist  Chris Anderson(Liam Cunningham) causes great stress among her staff.
  And what a staff. Her second in command ,Oswald Bates (Timothy Spall), is an overweight, eccentric off the wall fellow who will resort to any wild idea to save the collection. In addition to him is carrot red haired assistant whose brains are scrambled and her partner who remains most of the time silent.
  Bates tells the story of this wild crew's attempt to find a home for the collection in a week's time.

History, art and genealogy. Spall plays the collection's  detective and Lindsey Graham the storyteller, both excellently.",1470441600,,432,5.056338028169014

7919406,4,B00003TKF5,"If you love great B&W photographs from the past, and you love an interesting drama with plot twists and historical perspective, this one is for you.  Originally broadcast as a mini series on British TV back in the 1990s, it still hasn't lost its power.  I've watched it countless times and finally decided I had to own it.  There are 3 one-hour segments, on 2 DVDs.  There are also wonderful and interesting special bonus features to enhance your appreciation and understanding. And, oh, did I mention the superb cast?!  Lindsay Duncan, from ""A Year in Provence,""  and ""Timothy Spall,""  two of the UK's brightest and most prolific stars, will hold your attention from start to finish.",1461715200,,684,4.844827586206897
7919407,5,B00003TKF5,"I I caught this film by chance recently on TV and can only agree with all of the previous reviewers that it is a wonderful, original, civilized, and quite remarkable work.  I have been a Lindsay Duncan fan since the BBC miniseries"" Traffick"" and the entire cast is perfect.",1436486400,,273,4.571428571428571
7919408,5,B00003TKF5,"The collection of hundred of thousands of photographs in one place and the brilliant mind(s) that make order and connect them all creates this intelligent and engrossing miniseries. The collection is housed in a mansion with a small staff and threatened to be destroyed as it becomes a part of a larger buyout. The staff has a hard & doomed fight to save it in a short amount of time. It's tense, dramatic, & spellbinding.  Lindsay Duncan & Timothy Spall are flawless.",1427414400,2,468,4.7073170731707314
