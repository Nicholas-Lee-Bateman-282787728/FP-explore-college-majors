5944888,4,B00EV1YZGE,"*I received an advance copy of this film for my unbiased review.

It is said that everyone battles their own inner demons every day.  But what if those demons can suddenly take physical form and wreak the havoc our subconscious minds want them to?  That is the question Lionsgates upcoming release, PRIMITIVE, will look into next week.  This film, while not perfect, is very entertaining and will make you question the events that occur in the world around you.

I found the title of this film very appropriate.  The inner demons that Martin has to face are basically primal urges that have manifested themselves in physical form.  But the title does not just refer to them; I took it as also a description of how much we truly know about the brain and the way it works.  In regard to that, we are a primitive species.

PRIMITIVE is shot well and the production value looks pretty high.  I particularly like the scenes that are displayed during the opening credits.  They are shots of woodland areas, but the way they are shot gives them an eerie feeling.

The acting is ok, although it could have been better.  I do enjoy seeing Reggie Bannister onscreen; horror fans will recognize his trademark ponytail from classic films like the PHANTASM series and BUBBA HO-TEP.  And as for the special effects, they're pretty good overall.  The creature looks a little hokey, but not too badly.  And the gore is pretty nice.

The story is intriguing and I especially like how the pacing of the plot divulges just what you need to know as the movie progresses.  The big reveal at the end is well done and it almost put a smile on my face.  I have to tip my hat to the screenwriter, Kenneth L. Province Jr.  He does a great job, and I look forward to his work in the future.

All in all, PRIMITIVE is a fun film and I recommend it to anyone looking for some low-budget entertainment.  The film hits store shelves next week, so make a note.",1384387200,8,1928,4.495677233429395

8609693,4,B00EV1YZGE,"I purchased this movie for super cheap and wasn't expecting a lot.  But it ended up being a likeable little horror film with a lot of plusses going for it.  First I liked the atmosphere of the movie.  It has a cheesy 80's horror movie feel.  A lot of people say that without any real explanation.  Well, let me explain:  Hick sheriffs with southern accents, scenes in bars and bathrooms, practical effects with costumed monster, passable new actors, quaint little house on a barren hillside and of course the great Reggie Bannister of Phantasm fame.  There's a sincerity to this film, you can tell the actors, director and special effects crew really wanted to make a good film despite the low budget.  Also, the DVD has numerous extras, like outtakes, interviews, commentary and more.  Don't spend too much time trying to knit pick negatives or analyze problems with the movie, otherwise your going to miss a fairly entertaining horror film. There are worse ways to spend your free time with chips and beer than Primitive.",1417737600,,1023,4.8

8609696,4,B00EV1YZGE,"A simple horror movie you shouldn't over-think, Primitive hits the classic 80s monster horror notes including the tortured lead character, smokin' hot girlfriend, and inexplicably isolationist sheriff. Nothing new in this movie, but great monster design (given that it's been around before), good kills, passable acting (though the girlfriend steals any scene she's in).

The movie's worth watching on a rainy Saturday afternoon, but don't linger too long on character motivations or realism.",1388361600,,492,5.739726027397261
8609697,5,B00EV1YZGE,"THIS WAS OK MOVIE,THE MONSTER COULD SCARE YOU AND IT SURE LOVED TO EAT. I GAVE IT 5STARES BECAUSE OF THE LOOK OF THE CREATURE. IT HAD A SIMPLE PLOT AND THE ACTING WAS OK. I SAY YOU COULD HAVE THIS DVD IN YOUR COLLECTION, AND ONCE IN AWHILE WATCH IT AGAIN.",1386633600,3,255,3.923076923076923
8609698,5,B00EV1YZGE,"This movie wasn't what I expected, but in a good way! An interesting concept for a fun creature flick, and while I thought I had it figured out, I was surprised at the ending. There were many unexpected turns, and Reggie Bannister did a great job as the eccentric hypnotist. The rest of the acting was pretty good, with some realistic screams from the female cast. I was a little confused about the relationships between some of the characters, but it eventually gets cleared up and didn't really detract from the overall enjoyment of the storyline. I think it was well-directed and will check out more of Cooper's work. I liked the female deputy and would've liked to see more of her character.",1384992000,5,695,4.658536585365853
