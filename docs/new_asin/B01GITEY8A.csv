7760279,1,B01GITEY8A,It would be very helpful if I was told before buying dvd's that I would not be able to play them in Australia.  NOT IMPRESSED!!!!,1361836800,,129,4.16
7760280,4,B01GITEY8A,"this film is a great work of motor sports history. the color and the picture quality are great  considering the age of the master. If you are
a baby boomer and a motor sports fan you will really enjoy this film.",1278892800,,211,4.146341463414634
7760281,2,B01GITEY8A,"This film is about stock car racing in the 60's in the south. it is the sports story of an old driver helping a young one, they become rivals, then friends and you learn that it is bad luck to eat peanuts in the pits. If you love this era of racing, the film will fill that bill. It is just a good ol story about good ol boys and their noisy toys",1274572800,3,346,3.7534246575342465
7760282,4,B01GITEY8A,"The previous reviewer gave a pretty exhaustive plot synopsis, so I will abstain from adding any more.  The DVD itself is pretty good quality.  This was a Howco International production, so it probably isn't possible to find a print that ""looks like it was filmed yesterday.""  However, VCI has unearthed a print that has pretty good color values.  If you've only seen Connie Hines on TV in MR. ED (which was a black and white TV series), prepare to be dazzled by her stunning blue eyes.  The DVD transfer restores as much color as possible.  The film is offered in both full-frame and widescreen editions, but there honestly isn't much difference between the two, visually speaking.  The film may have been shot in 1:33-1, for all I know.  Still, it's nice to have a choice, because some folks prefer widescreen while others prefer full-frame.

The movie is kind of corny, but has a wonderful early 1960's vibe.  Although I think it is listed as being from 1963 somewhere on this site, I actually saw it in a hardtop theater around 1960, so it is older than that.  Connie Hines demonstrates here that she was a good dramatic actress.  Rory Calhoun made this picture and then went to Italy to star in two sword-and-sandal films (THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES in 1961 and MARCO POLO in 1962).",1273881600,11,1282,4.648888888888889

7760285,5,B01GITEY8A,I saw this movie around 1967 at a Saturday matinee in a small town in Alabama. I was about 10 years old and I loved this movie. It has stuck with me for all these years. I loved this movie but I have only seen it that one time. I will be ordering this soon so I can see if it is as good as I remember. For years I looked for it on TV but it was never to be. I'm glad I tried searching here. Can't wait to see it again.,1439942400,,418,3.5053763440860215

7760289,3,B01GITEY8A,"A reasonably diverting pop-culture artifact from 1960. Filmed at the Southern 500 in Darlington, ""Thunder in Carolina"" boasts a likable ""B-movie"" cast headed by Rory Calhoun, Alan Hale Jr. and Connie Hines plus some impressive stock-car footage. The storyline is a blatant ripoff of director Nicholas Ray's rodeo drama ""The Lusty Men"" (1952), but who cares? Produced by low-budget Howco International  the same folks who brought you Ed Wood's immortal ""Jail Bait"" (1954). Vintage car enthusiasts will enjoy the DVD extras, which include educational and promotional shorts by George Pal (Shell Oil) and Jam Handy (Chevrolet).",1421971200,2,624,5.5

7760296,5,B01GITEY8A,"One of the first racing movies I saw as a kid; loved it then, and I still do.  Historical footage of Darlington Race Track is worth the price of admission; and this was the first racing movie with in-car cameras during the race.  The plot is thin and the dialog hokey, but so what!",1395532800,,281,4.185185185185185

7760299,5,B01GITEY8A,Seldom seen color NASCAR action scenes are the highlight.  Off track melodrama is well acted and not as bad as other racing movies.,1391904000,,131,4.695652173913044

8762974,4,B01GITEY8A,"Great racing action from ""back in he day"" and a typical storyline make for a good racing picture. Al Hale was a great actor and is a perfect supporting man in this show. Sit back and enjoy the racing.",1524700800,,200,4.153846153846154

8762983,5,B01GITEY8A,"Good depiction of the world of Stock Cra racing (NASCAR) in the latter 1950's. Some actual drivers of the era, including Joe Weatherly, have cameo parts in this film. Rory Calhoun is the driver who talks a small-town auto shop owner into allowing his to repair his damaged race car. The young shop owner gets the racing bug from this exposure, much to the consternation of his young wife while the wife herself is attracted to the driver on a more basic level. Calhoun the driver eventually hooks up with an experienced crew chief played by Allen Hale, Jr (who will forevermore be best known as ""Skipper"" in the TV series ""Gilligan's Island""). Overall this is a well put together movie and it will, I think, be an enjoyable viewing experience for most everyone, especially racing fans. We fans certainly get few movies, especially competent ones, to enjoy. This is, and will remain, a good movie of the ""toddler years"" of NASCAR.",1455148800,,929,4.7407407407407405
