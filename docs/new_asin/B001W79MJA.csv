Thanks in advance.

UPDATE: No Spanish subtitles in the whole series from season 1 to 5.
But apart of it, you will like the show with 5 stars.",1248048000,,210,4.121951219512195
3824104,5,B001W79MJA,"Renewed for an unheard of next, two seasons ... first on Direct TV and then, NBC!!  Season 4 airs on NBC beginning Friday, April 30, 2010.  Check your local listings for time.

Friday Night Lights has long been a favorite of the critics.  And it has been tossed around the time slots to where I lost track of it.  But I found it again, ordered the 3 season DVDs and am all caught up.

This is THE best written, best acted, best cast show on television today.  The unique three-camera filming technique gives the show a free form, real, documentary feel.  Even though the show revolves around a small town's obsession of with championship high school football team, the show is not so much about football, as it is about the people in the town.

I promise you that the Pilot episode is the best pilot ever shot in the history of television.  By its end, you are immediately invested in the town and every one of its characters.

I have not fallen in love with a show in years ... or invested the time to watch.  But I can't recommend this one highly enough.  Each cast member is as good as the next.  Each character plays off one another in such a believable and convincing way.

Don't miss the chance to catch up before the new season airs on NBC.",1246060800,6,1247,4.337662337662338
3824105,5,B001W79MJA,"Friday Night Lights (FNL) is a must see ! Three season have already been released and two more on the way . This series depicts the human struggle in  ways that makes it seems so relevant and on point . It struggles to be what people might imagine it to be . Simply because FNL strives to be more then what is normally aspected of a TV show on network television based on a movie that was based on a game (football) . The show is not about a game , it' s about the PEOPLE whos' lives just happens to evolve around a game .",1243296000,4,522,3.9245283018867925

If you haven't, you won't be disappointed, this is a great show with great writing and some pretty good acting.",1342051200,,167,4.387096774193548
8347046,5,B001W79MJA,I am a big fan of FNL! Sad that it ended but happy that I bought all the DVDs so I can 'go back to Dylan' whenever I want:),1314230400,,123,3.2758620689655173
8347047,5,B001W79MJA,"Great show. I look forward to it every week it was on. Good story/character development. Not too much like the book, which I loved, but a good story in its own right.",1283904000,,166,4.21875
8347048,5,B001W79MJA,"If you have never seen this show, you're really missing something.  Anyone who thinks that because you're not into high school football - you wouldn't like this show - think again.  From the very beginning, you get so wrapped up in the characters and the story.  The leads are just incredible.  Kyle and Connie are amazing - and I hope they both win Emmys.  It is one of those classic shows with limited viewing - that deserves WAY WAY more.  Just so you know - I own about 2700 DVDs so I know - this show is special.  Buy it - you will be amazed.",1281139200,,547,4.152380952380953
8347049,5,B001W79MJA,"Love this TV series.  The characters are interesting.  Lots of realistic dialogue between characters.  Typical high schoolers, but great story lines.  Football scenes depict parents and students  in a genuine way and the way they film the series makes you feel right there at the game. Characters aren't bad to look at, either, esp Tim Riggins & Coach Taylor :)",1272499200,2,361,4.95
8347050,5,B001W79MJA,The DVD's are amazing...such a great show.  Friends in line to borrow our seasons 1-2. Can't wait 'til they bundle seasons 3-4.  Buy whole box set!  :),1269475200,,151,4.518518518518518
8347051,5,B001W79MJA,"What great news that it has been renewed for two more seasons.
The ensemble cast is so well selected, so well directed and so involving that I just don't know where this show can go in its story line.
I have watched this series three times so far. I put it away and watch other series come back to it every few months. I do the same with West Wing, Homicide:Life on The Streets, The Wire, and a few others that deliver something new and moving every time.
Come on seasons four and five.",1269129600,,486,4.180851063829787
8347052,5,B001W79MJA,"FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is a wonderful continuing story of high school football.
growing up in a small town, I remember how important the football team was to the community.
this tv show really captures that atmosphere.",1267142400,,215,5.0
8347053,5,B001W79MJA,I got this as a Christmas gift for a ardent fan of the series.  It will be well received and enjoyed by all.,1255305600,,108,3.6956521739130435
