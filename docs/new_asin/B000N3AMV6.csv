8307320,5,B000N3AMV6,"This DVD is a series of monthly reports made by NASA in the year 1966. They give a new appreciation of what it took to build the space program we have today. Many of the familiar landmarks, such as the VAB and launch complex 39, important in both the Apollo and Shuttle programs, were under construction at the time.  We also see the Gemini program practicing rendezvous, docking and EVA. While routine today, these were major hurdles on the way to the Moon.
DVD's like this make one appreciate where we are today, and where we might be going in the future",1328659200,,556,4.450980392156863
8307321,5,B000N3AMV6,"This is just what it is. No more, no less. Monthly reports 5 minutes each, in the NASA-year of 1966. The December report is a summary of the year and a bit longer. Highly interesting. Good footage (restored). The sound is OK. Thank You very much Spacecraft Films. Looking forward to the next one.
