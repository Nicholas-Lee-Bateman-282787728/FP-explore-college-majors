7168293,5,B00XJ8HAHG,Could you imagine this on BluRay.  I watch them all the time and its my favorite set of movies!!!,1218672000,2,97,4.105263157894737
7168294,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"Starwars on Blu-ray i am looking forward to it i would have been looking forward to it on HDDVD but thanks to Blu-ray winning the battle its a oneway option which blows like how Madden for EA Sports just brought out the whole NFL gaming licence so no other company can make another footgame for Playstation or XBOX but back to starwars which i would had brought on HDDVD because like most gamers out here they are biais and wanna either be sony fan boys or girls yes i know females gamers we need more of them xboxers or nes followers in which me i accept and own all 3 systems so i don't pick sides but blu-ray ok awesome my gripe with the regular dvd versions of Starwars was that with the commentary it had not only Lucas but his sound people and rick one of his producers if i am right i mean hearing from these guys are cool but i wanted to hear Geogre Lucas talk and only him so if the blu-ray comes out still have those guys with you but also have a only Geogre Lucas commentary because i really wanted hear what he had to say.
Example Episode 3 Mace Windu/Sidous fight ok they fight u hear Geogre talk only a little bit but then it goes to Rick and then his sound designer Bert and honestly i really wanted to hear Geogre Lucas explain everything like i said nothing against these guys but i just really wanna hear Geogre Lucas yack about his creation so yes bring these movies to Blu-ray but please have a Geogre Lucas only commentary have every other commentary like the DVD but make the Lucas only one. thanks all.",1215216000,,1525,4.243986254295533
7168295,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"well I have seen all 6 movies on Hi def, HBO ran them in october and all in 5.1DD, actually don't ask but I have all these on Dual layer DVD in Hi def and playable on a PS3 in the native AVC codec, they look and sound great, considering these releases are on the low end of the HD scale a blu ray relase will be great(a higher AVC bitrate), but these will have to do until then.",1209600000,2,378,3.7974683544303796
7168296,5,B00XJ8HAHG,Sorry but to sound one sided bluray is king theres more out there with bluray players being less than 300$ now and ps3 coming with bluray hd-dvd is dead its just a slow and painful fall i mean come on disney is exclusive to bluray and the porn industry is leaning more on bluray 180$ attachment plus an xbox 360 is alot more than buying a bluray player alone for 300$ or just a ps3 now at 400-500$ with blurays superior sound and picture quality someome like old lucas will know the best course of action if they choose not to release an hd-dvd version and well i would not be suprised if he did guess its all about if mr. lucas wants more money as if he needs it,1198454400,2,663,4.107692307692307
7168297,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"Boo-hoo, ME. At any rate, look up the Samsung BD-P1400. A blu-ray player that's not only less than $400, you can get it for less than $300 here on Amazon. Now stop spreading FUD and start enjoying some high def movies on Blu-ray!",1197158400,,229,4.348837209302325
7168298,1,B00XJ8HAHG,"I love the 6 movies, but COME ON!! NO HD-DVD????? Blu-ray is so expensive!! I have a 360, and may get an hd-dvd player off ebay. Unlike Blu-ray players, HD-DVD players are not like $400!",1196640000,5,186,4.3428571428571425
7168299,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"The thing about the original trilogy is that the picture quality has been maximized to its extent considering the quality of the original footage.  The audio can be replicated and enhanced, but the video quality would not be up to our standards of high def picture.",1195257600,,265,4.760869565217392
7168300,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"fox chose blu ray because of its many advantages all of which will help this eventual release to be utterly amazing. the extra storage space will be necessary to handle the length of these films, the advanced audio and high definition extras. transformer's shortcoming showed us that insufficient storage space and the ability to transfer data quickly (bitrates) can massively cripple a disc's content. judging by fantastic four, the day after tomorrow, and the early reviews of die hard from abroad show us that fox knows how to deliver the best high def content.

and with blu ray leading disc sales, with nearly twice as many discs sold and that number growing with record setting releases such as spider-man, ratatouille, cars, and the coming releases of pirates 3, the die hard quadrilogy and that blu ray capable hardware numbers in the millions, there is little argument from truly neutral parties. hd dvd only leads ""stand alone"" players by a few percent. but when the ps3 (blu ray) and the xbox add on drive (hd dvd) are counted Blu ray is massively in the lead.

I cannot wait to get these on blu ray. the HD cable broadcasts of them were very impressive for cable, but still have the limitations thereof. so i can only imagine how these will look in 1080p and sound with uncompressed (lpcm) audio.",1194652800,,1308,4.757709251101321
7168301,1,B00XJ8HAHG,"I agree with the previous reviewer, Saeed, that the first reviewer, Michael, is way off base that Blu Ray is the clear winner in the HD disc format wars.  From an unbiased opinion, the format wars have been even with no clear-cut winner.  Both sides are gaining momentum at various times.  Right now you would have to say HD DVD has the momentum with the announcement that Paramount is going exclusively HD DVD.

But that's not what we should be discussing.  The simple fact is there have been enough of both types of players sold to warrant the Star Wars movies to be released in both formats.  A release in both formats would sell a lot better then just a release in one of the formats.

So George, if you really want to have a huge money-making bonanza, you won't be selfish (as some reviewers suggest) and you will release the Star Wars movies in both formats.  Afterall, sharing is the best policy.  And George, the best policy is to also make your movies available in the best format(s) available!",1193616000,7,1003,4.527777777777778
7168302,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"Here is the thing on this i am a recent Bluray guy and a big star wars fan. Of course this will sell like hot cakes. However i disagree with the review earlier about nailing the HD wars. From the looks of it this war will go on for a long long time. But its ok folks i found a nifty little solution for this.  Take the one standard that you feel, see, analyzed and understood and stick with it.  Invest good money into that player (look for HDMI ver 1.3 on the new upcoming players either HD or Bluray) the alternative format just buy a cheap used player to compensate for those hard to get titles.  I had invested good money into a Pioneer elite model&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pioneer-Elite-BDP-94HD-Blu-Ray-disc-player/dp/B000RO7FA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pioneer Elite BDP-94HD - Blu-Ray disc player</a>&nbsp;which does a superb job with my chosen Bluray format.  After a few month of savings for HD-DVD i bought a used&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toshiba-HD-A1-HD-DVD-Player/dp/B000E1PTGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toshiba HD-A1 HD-DVD Player</a>&nbsp;which does a nice job with those discs.

Conclusion was: i got both formats for less than the new LG combo player which has its own issues.  I will tell u this may sound lavish but it isn't.

Sometimes the studios and this is a true story, will release thing like Terminator 1&2 in Blueray. However to watch T3 u need an HD player!

Now back to Lucas. Knowing how much of an audio person he is (after all the whole THX thing was no joke) and that extra 15gb's on blue will really help the lossless audio on it, i have a feeling they will go Blueray. However a second release would also be available on HD i am sure; Star Wars has a large base all over the world so better please them all.

On a side note: in the Middle East and even some parts of Asia, mainly Bluray is whats taking shape. There is no awareness on efforts placed for HD-DVD formats whatsoever. In this part of the world we even saw bluray being sold through chain stores officially but no HD-DVD.  Thats a big sign on its own of whats coming.",1189987200,11,2168,5.0307262569832405

7168325,5,B00XJ8HAHG,So far so good. I'm testing all my star wars episodes 1-7 blu ray and episode 1-2 work fine. I'm testing the others right now. So the people who are saying bad reviews about this I think they're just stupid or not know how Blu-ray DVD works in order to have a Blu-ray movie you have to have either an Xbox One a PS4 a Blu-ray DVD player or anything else that plays Blu-ray... because I've read the other reviews that people posted about this and I think they're just retarded cuz either they don't know how a Blu-ray DVD works or they're just even more dumb cuz they're putting it in the normal disc tray. I so far on my Xbox One S episode 1 and 2 work I'm currently testing all of them.,1523145600,2,687,4.0962962962962965

7168327,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"Great sound, great picture *FOR NORMAL 1080 TVs*. If you try to play this on a 4k player on a 4k tv, the up-conversion looks fantastic except for fast-moving objects, particularly the lightsaber duels. For some reason the up-conversion cannot translate the lightsaber movements correctly, and so lightsaber swings look noticeably pixelated. Otherwise, on ""current gen"" HDTVs and the other unaffected scenes on 4k ultra-HDTVs look and sound great.

Unfortunately, at the time of the review, Disney had not released a 4k version of the trilogies (Star wars Last Jedi was the first to have 4k) so this is the highest quality you're gonna get. Beware of playing it with 4k players on 4k tvs.",1522886400,,687,4.973913043478261

7168341,5,B00XJ8HAHG,Bought these when I realized my younger sister had only seen the force awakens and the Christmas special so I took it upon myself to give her something inbetween those two. It was the most reactive Ive ever seen her watching a movie. I called a friend over who knows the lore really well to answer her questions because Id only seen them once as a kid. Were simultaneously better and worse than what I remember. I absolutely adore Padme and her terrible space fashion. Uh Jar Jar Binks is actually as bad as people make him out to be and tbh feels a little bit  racist. I love Obi Wan. These movies really get too much shit they're fun! Tons of cool villains. Arguably too many. Anyway a solid buy. These are now the only movies in my dorm which is sort of embarrassing but also who cares. I think every Star Wars movie should have a tacky flowery forbidden romance in it. @ the new trilogy. But enough with the hot takes all the DVDs work and are super nice!,1519948800,3,959,4.269230769230769

7168391,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"I suppose I should have done more research before buying these. This does not contain a code for a digital copy like most blu-ray movies you buy physically do. Granted, it's not a huge deal since I got this alongside the Episodes 4-6 collection for the price of just one, but certainly still disappointing as I was hoping to fill both my physical collection and digital collection of Star Wars movies (have 7 and Rogue One on Blu-ray and digital, and had 1-6 on normal DVD back from 2005 so it was time I updated those).",1512000000,,520,4.427083333333333

The case itself also had some of the interior edges broken, why inside and not outside boggles me a bit.  The discs seem fine, I have yet to play them, bit are dirty.  The plastic spindles they rest upon are hazy/dirty so I believe that transferred to some of the discs.  Mostly cosmetic, not worth the hassle to try and return.",1512000000,,471,4.430232558139535

That doesn't mean it wasn't there, but I didn't even THINK to look for some note that might say, Oh, btw, we'll sell you this even though you won't be able to play it.  I was furious when we took it on vacation, excited to watch the trilogy, and the DVD player was like... wrong format!  So, I was angry with Amazon for letting this be sold in the U.S. and I hate the sellers.  I think that's B.S. and I feel as though I got scammed.  BUYER BEWARE!!!",1508371200,9,559,4.12962962962963

He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.

They're in the UK, I'm in the US...who wants to wait 2-3 weeks for a movie set I could've just bought at a local shop and saved myself the time and upcoming problems. After receiving the package, I observed the package came from the UK and I take responsibility for ordering it.  Then I placed the DVD in our PS4 and an error code came up that there's a Geographic licensing issue and cannot be played because we're in America.  So here I am with a $30-40 purchase with a DVD my son was super excited to watch and can't be played...Boo on this purchase.  So in the end I ended up spending an additional $20 to download the film, because the DVD won't play in the US. So...would order this form a company in the UK, or subsequently from this seller? absolutely NOT.  I know the sellers not responsible for the geo restriction on the dvd, however they should be aware or more fine tuned with the details of their product...and the shipping???

7168637,1,B00XJ8HAHG,"None of the 3 DVD's would play.  When I inserted each one, I got the message on our
tv screen saying, "" Disc Error "".  "" Not playable in this area"".....( words to that effect ).
"" Please remove disc "".  None of this made sense to me at all.  So, I got the idea of using my disc cleaner (also works on CD's and CD Rom discs for computers). Even
that gave me the same message.  I thought maybe our DVD player didn't need cleaning
after all.  Then, I tried one of my other movies that I had watched over the weekend and
it worked fine.  So, I then put the Star Wars movie discs back in and again, the same
message... "" Disc Error ""... blah, blah, blah,etc.............. I really have no choice but to
return the movie set and either get a new set or get the amount paid back on my credit
card.  I also looked up Amazon.com and tried to get a Return Label, but every time I
clicked on the link to get a Return Label to print, cut out and send my movie set back, I
was sent to a totally different link altogether.  I did this three times and got the same
results.  So, I gave up, hoping I would get an e-mail from you all asking for review.  Well, low and behold, here you guys are.  I hope I can get some good results from this.
I must say, this is the first time I have ever had any problems with a movie that I ordered
from Amazon. com.  I hope this is the ONLY TIME, PLEASE.  Hope you all can help
me out.

7168731,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"It is star wars. what more can be said?

The original DVD releases for each of the prequel trilogy episodes are of pretty high quality in themselves. But here, on Blu-Ray, the quality, picture and sound are just outstandingly amazing. There is no ""digital noise"" to be seen here, a problem which really bugged me with there previous releases: especially in the first episode, which had the most room for improvement regarding its quality. And even the third episode, which is of the highest quality standards, makes the original releases look like nothing. Allot of the color and hazing problems of the first two episodes (the third one didn't' need any fixing up in this area) have been fixed and updated and now look more vibrant and sharp than ever. Also, several CG mistakes have been fixed, such as the two-headed pod race announcer's hand going striate through his jacket. And several cool deleted scenes have been re-inserted, such as each of the pod racers from episode 1 being introduced by the announcer to the crowed. Other updates include several of the really puppet-looking aliens (like the terrible, cross eyed stone-faced puppet of Yoda) have been replaced by CG versions of them that look just awesome. And the sound quality...in one word, AMAZING! The sound has been balanced quite well, so that you won't need to be constantly turning up the volume significantly at the scenes with more dialogue and turning the volume down drastically at the really intense action scenes. And the sound effects have been greatly enhanced and are just so amazing that it's nearly mind boggling. Especially in the 2nd episode, which has, by far, the great sound effects of the whole saga. This film really deserves the highest honors on it's sound.

The only real problem that I have had with this is the lack of bonus features, a factor that I also had a problem with in the other Blu-Ray + DVD release of the original trilogy. The only bonus features that are included here are two different commentaries for each movie: for each one of the movies, one commentary with George Lucas and the crew, and the other one being compiled from archival interviews with cast and crew. And while both of the Audio Commentary tracks are quite interesting, it just isn't enough. Now I know that the reason for this is because the makers want everybody to buy the more-expensive Complete Saga on Blu-ray release, which has three discs filled with bonus features. But I still think that this volume could really benefit with at least a few more bonus features (or at least make it an option to view the unaltered version of each film) that would give it a much greater value.

On the physical qualities: the volume comes in a pretty nice slipcover that won't wrinkle or fall apart easily. The case is quite strong and will close up without any struggle and won't fly open if it's simply dropped. But it's still pretty easy to open it manually without any difficulties. It comes, as you probably already know, three Blu-Ray discs and three normal DVDs. The Blu-Ray discs are much thicker and more scratch resistant than normal DVDs, making them more protected if they should fall into the wrong hands (or, in other words, SMALL hands). They also don't bend easily and won't crack under any great pressure. The DVDs are just like normal DVDs, but as you might have figured out as to what I said above, the quality of the prequel trilogy films on them are of much higher quality than any previous DVD release of the prequel trilogy that I have seen.",1466553600,2,3533,4.732142857142857

7168880,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"The Prequel Trilogy gets a lot of undeserved hate.

Episode 1 is actually pretty good. Darth Maul is easily one of the cooler sith lords in the series, next to Vader himself, and the effects still hold up.

Episode 2 is awful. Only watch it when you need to. The only thing redeeming about it is Padme's outfit during the arena fight (   ) holy sh*t dat a**

Episode 3 is actually pretty great. The effects are great, the story is pretty top notch, and it shows a very good transition from Jedi Knight to Sith Lord.

The use of green screen is really cheap and can get annoying. It doesn't feel as convincing as the practical effects used in TFA and the OT.

Overall, I must admit that the bandwagon against the prequel trilogy is stupid. It's a Shakespearean tragedy, which is something most people ignore. It's supposed to resemble the OT, not mimic it. That's one of TFA's main flaws. Most movie franchises wouldn't dare end the series on a sad note, but RotS did just that.

If you really want to buy the prequels, though, this is the way to do it. The DVD video quality is more than adequate; and there are blu-ray discs included too, if you have a blu-ray player.

I watch them on my Blue Ray player on my  Asus G751JY Gaming laptop through the Cyberlink powerDVD 15 which also plays Blue Rays very well and I top it off by plugging in my Asus Strix 7.1 headset which has a total of 10 speakers (5 on each side) giving it  true 7.1 surround sound to the these disk. Plus I also have a 3D screen on my 17.3"" 1080P screen so it even looks really great I have watched it on my Samsung big screen with 1080P LED screen with a 7.1 sound system on it and that also looks and sounds great.

So, I got stuck watching these 3 ""movies"" a second time in my life. Only pick these up if you are way more than interested in the political agenda of the jedi, and want to see what emo darth vader would have been like. I only gave this set 2 stars because: it is a very nice box set and its much cheaper than buying them all seperately. These movies are painfully boring to watch, they kill off one of the best villains of the series after about 20 minutes of on screen time, and the character development is akward and skewed. Oh, and jarjar... I almost forgot about him. I wish I had. Don't ask any more questions about him. Seriously, this discussion is over.",1456185600,,801,4.207792207792208

7169031,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"An ex-significant other took my first set of Episodes 1-3, leaving the bonus discs and Episodes 4-6. What kind of monster does that? Who would leave the original trilogy in favor of the new ones?

But then, as the new movie approached, I discovered that my husband hadn't seen Episodes 1-3, and in order to watch the series in Machete Order (IV, V, II, III, VI, not bothering with I), I needed these movies. No one I knew had them, so I decided to complete my collection and upgrade to Blu-ray in the process.

As we watched the movies, it turned out that my husband had indeed seen Episodes 1-3, so we never had to watch them after all. And after we watched Machete Order, my hubby wanted to see Episode 1 anyway, so we watched that, too. And when the new movie came out, we were primed up in Star Wars mode and totally excited.

I'll admit it: I've spent years blasting these movies, but when I watched them again with my husband, they weren't quite as bad as I thought, and the truth is, I love all of the Star Wars movies anyway.

I've only recently become the super fan that I am now, but I've enjoyed the entire saga for years. I'm going to sound hipster no doubt but the original trilogy is better than 1-3 and I could've gone without seeing the new one and been fine. But the new trilogy is still undoubtably a fantastic collection of action packed drama filled crazy-ness (like I said, I've never reviewed before so give me a break) these movies are great. I recommend them for adults, children, anyone. There isn't a single demographic that I believe this was made for, it is something people of all ages or even cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Yes I do think somethings are better for certain ethnicities than other, i.e. Tyler perry movies for black people. and that probably sounds totally racist. And this review is kind of funny.

7169128,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"Star Wars is a classic collection of movies that should be in every collection. I gave this collection 4 stars because it includes that inexcusable Episode I, which is just an embarrassment to the Star Wars legacy. I haven't owned the 'prequel' trilogy since I was in high school, so it's been awhile since I watched them. I took a chance on the ""Machete Order"" this last time, and I think I found what George Lucas was missing (google it, you won't be disappointed!)

Highly recommend buying this set and the Star Wars episode IV-VI collection...you save about $20 over buying the collection with all 6 movies. The only difference I know of are the special features, so if you're a die-hard fan you might want to get the other, but for my purposes, I'd rather keep my $20.",1454371200,,773,4.561151079136691

7169142,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"Yes I am a ""Old Dog"" that saw the original in the theaters back in 1977 & have patiently waited for the prequels to be made & come out to add to my collection!  I was a bit upset that episode 3 was never released on V.H.S. for collection reason's but getting these improved versions both on Blu-ray & D.V.D. makes up for it!!!  I have heard many aficionado's complain about the restoration & added material to the decades older original movies.  But lets be reasonable your looking at decades of differences in Special Effects technology, & if they had not taken the time to fix the degraded film & add the extra scene's there would be a glaring disparity between the older movies & the newer ones.  You also have to think about future viewers that will be able to watch this franchise in chronological order without waiting those decades!!!  I think they did a great job making this franchise have the look & sound needed to have the continuity to make these films look good!!!  And now there is going to be a new movie with the original cast aged & ready to usher in possibly another trilogy to the franchise!!!  As long as the newer movie is as good as the previous ones, I have no complaints!!!  This classic ""Good against Evil"" franchise has & will continue to entertain generations to come.  Future fans may be parking their Hover Cars after work  to come home & enjoy some of the greatest escapist fantasy movies ever made !!!  The picture quality & sound quality are great.  And for what you get I think the price was fair to update these classic science fiction movies.

7169193,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"I can say that the Bluray is much clearer than the DVD versions I had for years. I had been holding off on buying the Bluray versions of the prequels simply because I wasn't a fan of them, though I love Star Wars. When ""The Force Awakens"" was about to come out, I wanted to watch all previous 6 movies in order, and when I started to watch the DVD versions, I couldn't stand it.

Visually, the movies are nice. Of course high-profile movies like these get the platinum treatment when it comes to remastering for HD, so don't expect any film-grain or signs of age (especially considering that 90% of it is CGI) Sound quality is superb like you would expect. That's the good part... The bad parts are the movies themselves....

********
SPOILERS BELOW
********

The blatant abuse of CGI, lack of any actual comedy or one-liners, bad casting choices, and horrible, HORRIBLE decisions with characters made these movies about as unintentionally-campy as Starship Troopers... Opinions will vary, of course, so I only allowed my opinions of the films to take out one star in my rating. Everything seemed tacked together, characters come out of nowhere, apparently nobody on the set or in the editing room knows what is funny.  Let's Take a few of my biggest complaints.

Aniken.,.. It's most likely no secret to anyone watching the prequels that Aniken will turn into Darth Vader at some point... But wouldn't it be better if we actually saw a likable side before we saw the transformation? I mean, once we are introduced to Young-Adult Aniken, he's pretty-much already a jerk. At no point during ep II or III do I even remotely like his character.

Obliviousness of The Jedi ... How thick were these guys? The prophesy says that Aniken will bring balance to the force, what made them assume that was a good thing for them? There were dozens (if not Hundreds) of Jedi, and even Yoda says ""Sith, there is always two, no more, no less"" ... So it's some HUGE surprise when Aniken helps to kill all of the Jedi except two, and becomes Darth Vader... Wow, who would have thought 2:2 is balance?...Apparently they should have been teaching Math instead of handing a bunch of 4 year olds Light Sabers at the Jedi Academy...

Yoda is suddenly an always-serious, front-flipping, light-saber wielding ninja-turtle... The Yoda we knew was a sarcastic, wise, Humble Force Master that had a sense of humor... The Yoda we see in the prequels is almost the exact opposite, except his annoyingly overused reverse-syntax. The only part where it was REALLY grating was when they decided to make Yoda the Military Strategist/Commander. I'm pretty sure that clear orders are important when telling an army what to do, and leaving out the primary action of an order until the final phrase of a complex sentence isn't the best way to communicate to your troops...

Darth Maul was BY FAR the most talented person to ever wield a lightsaber. So instead of giving him any character depth or screen-time, we'll just kill him off in the first episode because... well... just because...

NOTHING IN THESE THREE FILMS IS FUNNY... You can tell when they tried to be funny. Goofy CGI visual gags are NOT funny... Jar-Jar Binks is NOT funny... A two-headed race-commentator dancing is NOT funny... I actually felt embarrassed for the makers of these movies when they tried really REALLY hard to add comic relief. They went too far, and relied on the wrong way to add comedy. They had Samuel L Jackson in there, and didn't give him a single quotable line... The same goes for Liam Neison... or even Natalie Portman... All of those people have proven to be able to play a straight-man comic in several roles, yet these MASTERS OF STORY TELLING couldn't give any of them  a good line or two... Nope, We'll leave it up to goofy CGI robots that are supposed to be soldiers, or Goofy CGI robots that are supposed to be a pit-crew, or a goofy CGI sports announcer dancing like a white girl, or a goofy CGI character that inexplicably has more screen time than most of the other characters...

Misguided or Lazy, it doesn't matter, these movies were terrible...

BONUS RANT:

""Phantom Meanace Ep I"" was JUST as much of a remake of ""A New Hope, ep IV"" as ""The Force Awakens"", just in different ways... Female Royalty trying to escape Bad guys... ""Young, but still to old to learn the force"" kid found on a desert planet (actually the same planet as IV)... Darth (insert name here) Kills the primary force-teaching character while apprentice watches helplessly... Force-kid flies spacecraft, blows up giant space station, saves the day...

Samuel L. and the guy who plays Palpetine also act their roles really well.  Same with Saruman.  In fact, it seems the leads are the only ones that sucked.  What's up with that?  Jar Jar has never really annoyed me that much.  Natalie Portman and Hayden Chrstiensen are bland and totally unbelievable in their roles.",1453420800,,427,4.819444444444445

7169258,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"This trilogy is good, but not great.

Episode 1 looks the most like Star Wars visually, but feels like a cheap sci-fi movie story-wise.

Episode 2 is the worst Star Wars ever made. Period. Visually it fails as it relies too heavily on CGI. And trust me, you can tell. The CGI is so dated that it looks worse than many current gen video games. Story-wise it is interesting the first time you watch it, and then is boring as watching grass grow. Acting is horrible, writing is more so. An absolute disgrace of a Star Wars movie.

Episode 3 is the best of the prequels. While it still over relies on CGI, it isn't nearly as dated as 2. Story-wise it feels like too much information needed to be presented in one 2-hour movie. Anakin's fall happens in less than 10 minutes. It spent way too much time in the opening scenes, and on Obi-Wan's quest to fight Grievous. Many times scenes exist for nothing but spectacle. However there are several great moments that are worth watching. The last of the prequel trilogy does capture some of the Star Wars charm, and Hayden and cast give much better performances in 3. However, those performances are in spite of the writing, not because of an improvement.

Overall this trilogy is fun to watch the first time, just to get the story set up for 4-5-6, but afterwards I find myself going to the originals more and more.",1453075200,,1356,4.477732793522267

7169267,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"I am not going to comment on the writing or acting of these films, as they have been scrutinized ad nauseum. This review is solely based on the actual product (I know Amazon often lumps reviews together, so this review is regarding the 3 Blu-Ray/3 DVD set).

$35 is a great price for receiving both the DVDs and Blu-Rays, especially since certain individual titles can cost close to $20. That price is even better when you see how clear the picture is. I was blown away by that; the Blu-Ray quality was brilliant and vibrant, I almost felt like I was there! Plus, the sound was equally as impressive. In Episode I, for instance, with a surround sound system, the pod race sounds like it's all around you, as every speaker is utilized.

Since this is a budget release, this set is only the movies, with no special feature disc or anything. But if you're looking for a less expensive set that doesn't skimp on picture or sound quality, pick up this one.",1452902400,,951,4.491329479768786

But with how I ordered everything it all worked out perfect. I got to watch them in the order with the story line with him start to finish.

I remember thinking that The Phantom Menace was the worst of the three but after seeing them again, Attack of the Clones takes the cake. Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman have zero chemistry and most of the scenes with both of them are downright painful. I'm leaving the review with 3 stars because you get to see Yoda jump around a couple of times throughout the trilogy and the giant space ship battle at the beginning of Revenge of the Sith is fun.",1451865600,,575,4.538461538461538

I think the packaging and production are fine, but to my amazement this collection had a wonderful surprise. The trilogy collection (I, II, III) has Descriptive Video Service (DVS) or audio description for the visually impaired. This feature is a huge plus for my wife who is a Star Wars fan and blind. A must for anyone with a visually impaired or blind fan of the series. The fight scene descriptions are unreal with detail and there is no way someone watching and describing can give it justice.

7169403,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"i'm typing this a couple weeks or so before the release of The Force Awakens, a situation that raises many questions: is there indeed some ""juice"" left in Star Wars? where could it go without the once all-important tragedy of Anakin Skywalker? how much, really, can we expect without it's creator at the helm?
the question it stirs most deeply in me, though, concerns a slightly different matter: will certain idiots PLEASE get the [censored] off George Lucas' case already?
it's admittedly hard to argue that episodes 1 through 3 exactly measure up to their landmark predecessor(s), if only because Lucas' vision wasn't quite so unprecedented anymore. but they're hardly the Plan 9 From Outer Space of their time that rumor relentlessly posits them as to this day. they're certainly not such a torture as to merit George Lucas being burned at the stake, or buried alive, or whatever else a few dozen stand-up comics have since suggested.
granted, The Phantom Menace is easily the low point of Lucas's mosaic. overemphasis on Jar Jar Binks is only the most obvious (and descried) weakness. a ""podrace"" that goes on way too long, for instance.
what's always struck me as it's foremost weakness is a truly min-boggling lapse in exposition: it depends heavily upon the villainous machinations of the ""Trade Federation"", yet can't be bothered to take a minute to explain just who the hell they are or what exactly they might stand to gain by laying Naboo under siege. (it doesn't exactly help that this unspecified goal is described more than once as a ""franchise,"" as if they were trying to open a chain of restaurants or something.) granted, they're simple pawns of the central villain, but that doesn't mean the film wouldn't benefit for some characterization on their part. they act as a recurring nemesis in the prequel trilogy, but are never given a sufficient profile to feel particularly formidable. that to me is the only particularly glaring weakness of these much maligned films.
it's also worth noting that Menace once featured one of the very, very, VERY few deleted scenes that a film is actually the poorer for lacking. specifically, the moment where Qui-Gon has to break up a fight because young Greedo has accused Anakin of cheating in the podrace. i suspect that the backlash against Jake Lloyd was chiefly because he plays the budding villain as such a giddy goody-two-shoes. this scene, with it's brief flash of pride and temper, may well of kept it from being such a jarring 180-degree turn. sadly, it's omission leaves the film with literally no inherent suggestion that the galactic despot-to-be is in any way susceptible to the Dark Side. (now THAT'S what i call the devil in the details.)
so no two ways about it, Menace is the 6th best of Lucas' 6 films. but i think you should ask yourself, what did you expect? didn't we all walk into that cinema knowing damn well it was only one sixth of the puzzle? hadn't a literal butt-load of publicity made abundantly clear that this wasn't a complete story, that, as one tagline put it, ""every saga has a beginning""?
in other words, Menace wasn't MEANT to satisfy. it's job was simply to lay a foundation for what was to come, as much for the classic trilogy as the two forthcoming installments. on the basis that it's to serve as such a springboard, the appetizer rather than the feast, it's probably as good as it could ever of been.
i've already mentioned my theory that nothing can mar a movie's chances more than a juggernaut of biased or inaccurate rumor, and this just might be the most tragic example ever. the more i think about it, the more firmly convinced i am that it happened like this: people felt so gypped to be left hangin' by Menace that it was decided that nothing bearing the name George Lucas would ever get a fair shake again. the film was still in it's theatrical run when those who felt let down by it decided to passionately detest the other two, long before they'd even been titled, much less filmed. and just to get REALLY scary, that acrimony lasted long enough to, a few years later, similarly slander a delightful little adventure-for-adventure's sake called Indiana Jones & The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull.
i guess i shouldn't be surprised that people are capable of vindictiveness on this scale, but to this days it stuns me to think that goes for fans of something as good-natured and life-affirming as Star Wars.
because make no mistake: Menace, and only Menace, was in any way a letdown. Attack Of The Clones sees Lucas back on track and then some, significantly narrowing the gap between Menace and A New Hope. some have criticized it for overdoing the love story angle as well as the political scheming, and there are any number of others films where i would agree one of those was a detriment. but in this case, both were absolutely central to where the story had to go, namely Anakin's forbidden romance and the much discussed Clone Wars. the original films are so obviously the aftermath of a political chess game, can you honestly say you'd never wondered just who was playing said game and how it had played out?
and of course, Hayden Christensen turned out to be the second most popular chink the armor. no. 1 of course being Jar Jar Binks. (while i never loathed Jar Jar quite as much as some, i'm still one of those who'd like to think the recently proposed ""Darth Jar Jar"" theory had something to it.) unlike Jar Jar, though, Christensen has the privilege of mitigating circumstances.
to this day it positively flabbergasts me to think people were so shocked to see Darth Vader-to-be portrayed as a snarky, troubled, loose-cannon adolescent. uh, did ya happen to notice that he grows up to be something closer to Charles Manson than Mother Teresa? of COURSE he's gonna have issues. issues is precisely what makes a budding sociopath. villains are, more of less by definition, never happy or fulfilled people. you could perhaps argue that Christensen wasn't quite right for the role, but no one could ever accuse him of misinterpreting it. he ""got it,"" pure an' simple.
and then comes the saving grace, the thread that finally ties it all together, Revenge Of The Sith. this towering Faustian tragedy is just about faultless. it shows a basically good person being corrupted from war hero to ruthless tyrant, destroying a democracy in the process, and it does so without pulling a single punch. the newly christened Darth Vader is fully as vicious as Anakin Skywalker was heroic. he acts just as disreputably as he once tried to act helpfully. neither Yoda nor Obi-Wan are exactly ecstatic about what they have to do, but neither shirks his responsibility either. certainly a real-life tragedy on this scale would go to the proverbial 11. and Lucas would've more or less invalidated the whole damn series if he hadn't taken it to 11. whatever substance, not to mention heart, you might think it's predecessors lacked, Sith makes up for in spades.
in the commentary, Lucas more than once compares Anakin to Michael Corleone. i wouldn't want to be making the comparison that sounds like (well, maybe The Godfather III was as good as The Phantom Menace), but it does indeed neatly sum up who the character is, what has to happen to him, and how he has to deal with it.
these films are a textbook example of how a film might underwhelm but still have something to offer. the only conceivable explanation of their even having a bad reputation, let alone said reputation being blown so ludicrously out of proportion, is the one i've already spelled out: those who felt let down by The Phantom Menace brainwashed as many people as they could into discontinuing any goodwill toward George Lucas.
then, just to make sure we made it all the way to The Twilight Zone, another lunatic fringe came along and cried fowl because Lucas didn't release DVDs of the original versions of the film as well as the ""Special Edition."" never mind that were only a few minor alterations, or that the story itself is still intact. because it's not like anyone formed an attachment to the characters or in any way empathized with their struggles. it was special and magical because the Millennium Falcon dangled from a visible wire!
seriously though, i could understand all the fuss if anything important had been changed, if say, the Dark Side won, if lightsabers were being used as dildos, or if Chewbacca was the main course at Thankgiving dinner. but the fact is, Lucas' fine-tuning is on the whole so peripheral that we'd probably of forgotten all about it years ago if not for the incessant nagging of a few crybabies.
but i digress...
so yes, a handful of things are left to be desired. but ultimately, not only do i enjoy more than i dislike about the prequels, i find myself enjoying the originals even more. Return Of The Jedi in particular is quite a bit stronger now that certain blanks have been filled in. it saddens me that some won't give themselves the chance to see that part of it, and it frustrates me to think they're poisoning others against these films in the process.
so to summarize, for neither the first nor the last time, consensus of opinion and/or common knowledge is full of it. maybe his powers had tapered off a little, but on the whole The Force was still with George Lucas. artistically speaking, at least.",1449446400,3,9325,4.735547355473555

7169411,2,B00XJ8HAHG,"I was a teenager when the phantom menace first came to theatres. I only saw the film twice as opposed to dozens of times I had viewed the original trilogy. I though I had simply grown out of Star Wars and that's why I couldn't get into the prequels. A week ago, I watched the prequels for the first time since I viewed them in theatres. Wow, turns out it wasn't me just growing out of Star Wars, these are just really bad movies period with the phantom menace leading the awfulness. I wanted to like these films, I tried to like them but I just couldn't.

Phantom menace-Really, really bad. I don't know where to even start. The script is not well developed. Do we really need a movie to show councils meeting and sitting around the whole time? Nope. The trade disputes just should been left in the opening scroll. The cgi is terrible. There is one scene towards the end on Naboo showing tanks sitting on green hills. It's very brief but I swear in one shot, there are only three colors, green, khaki, and blue. Very little detail whatsoever. Characters are totally flat. I was really excited to learn of anakin's childhood. There isn't much  in the movie at all about him. He raced a pod, and was supposedly a great pilot even though auto pilot took him into the battle above Naboo? Jar jar f*cking binks. Incredibly annoying and totally fake looking.
Attack of the clones-Gag me. Christian whatever his name was so terrible in this movie!! I don't usually notice bad acting but it's impossible not to notice in this film. The love story is totally lame and not believable between him and padme. There's no ""I love you,"" ""i know,"" moments like with Han and leia. It's not interesting at all to watch. Again cgi was bad.
Revenge of the sith-Christian what's his nuts acting has much improved. Definitely a noticeable difference. Again the cgi sucks and totally detracts from the film. In fact, that all this film is really; cgi with some real actors thrown in looking exactly like, well they are standing in front of a green screen. No interaction with the environments at all. Way too many lightsaber battles too. They all looked really fake (big surprise). While I always wanted to see yoda in action, his cartoonish (again bad cgi) appearance with his ridiculous somersaults are so freaking cheesy. And what's with grievous having light sabers?
I don't consider myself a Star Wars fan boy, but I can definitely see why people prefer the original trilogy. The prequels are just mediocre films at best. Watching them was a chore.",1448755200,2,2530,4.62

7169494,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"Criminally underrated films. Despite rage from nostalgia-biased ""purists"", the prequels offer a great glimpse into the galaxy's pre-Empire days. Complex themes of pride, corruption and tradgedy prevail over the admittedly awkward romance and dialogue. But the immersion of Star Wars' story never relied on dialogue. Ignore the haters. The screenwriters developed a great story sticking to the source material. Aesthetically, the digital effects bring alot to the execution of the story, and, aside from the insanely popular Imperial March, the prequels' original score is UNPARALLELED.",1441584000,7,585,5.894117647058824

7169518,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"First off the physical product itself arrived on time and in perfect condition. Star Wars is one of my all time favorite franchises and the films hold a special place in my childhood. I have watched the original trilogy, in fact they were the first three I ever watched and got me started with Star Wars but as a 90s baby I grew up with the prequel trilogy. Episodes 1-3 are as special to me as episodes 4-6 are to another generation. These movies were just the things I needed to distract me from my problems and transport me to a galaxy far, far away. Ive seen each one countless times and each time I watch I feel I learn something new. I know lots of people didn't care for cgi and favored the original prop based characters and settings but I think that cgi whether you like or not is a symbol of the new era of film making. Lots of people remark that the acting is mediocre or just flat out horrible but I've watched the original three over and over and don't see any leaps and bounds over the prequels, not saying its bad just that they aren't incredibly different. The one big criticism from me would be that I feel the prequel stories were really watered down, there is so much left out that would have added more character depth and even a better sense of the overall mood of the galaxy at the time of the films. The films don't necessarily center around in my opinion the times where the best of the main characters comes out. For example Anakin and Padme are introduced in episode 1 as kids, so it would be hard to translate any strong romantic connection between them in the film. Fast forward to episode 2 and Anakin is a young man who like most men his age is hot headed, headstrong, and has a problem with authority and obi wan comes off as a grouchy teacher. I think more details about some of the characters better moments would please more people and make the characters more likable but in any case the way the films are is more than enough for me, how about you?",1439078400,2,1983,4.290666666666667
7169519,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"Anyone who was born more than 20 years ago already know that episodes 1-3 are no where as good as episodes 4-6 so I'm not even going to address the actual movies.

As far as playback and disc quality goes, they're great.  I only used the DVD's (since I don't have a blu ray player) but the picture quality and sound was excellent.  If you are looking for episodes 1-3, buy these.  You get both the DVD and Blu-ray version.  And at $34, I couldn't find a better price anywhere else",1438819200,,480,4.230769230769231

Since I had also ordered IV-VI, my daughter and I mixed and matched the cases and I gave her all the blue ray and kept all of the DVDs for myself.

7169534,5,B00XJ8HAHG,Even though there are many die hards who immensely dislike the prequels I am very happy to have them on Blu-ray. If you are trying to indoctrinate small children into the Star Wars universe you must have all the tools handy in order to do so. Kids respond to Jar Jar and Ewoks. Plus how mad can you be with Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan and Christopher Lee as Count Dooku? I have IV-VI on DVD already so that is why I didn't get the big set.,1437523200,4,436,4.0813953488372094

7169855,2,B00XJ8HAHG,"These are just horrible movies, Star Wars or not.  I think Lucas was so lost in all his special effects and his cocooned star wars world that he completely lost sight of being a legitimate director.
... with shallow & empty characters, cheesy and sometimes hideous dialogue, a bland plot that goes nowhere from the get-go, grindingly slow pacing, too many cartoony effects, etc.  People were actually throwing popcorn at the screen and laughing when I saw these in the theaters.  During the originals people cheered.  Of course maybe Lucas dumbed them down and made them safer intentionally for a younger audience, who knows.  For me they sucked and that's all.  Hopefully someday somebody will remake them and actually make GOOD MOVIES in the more realistic and serious light of the original epics.
I think this is what we're going to get from J.J. Abrahms.",1410825600,,858,4.882758620689655

7169884,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"This prequel trilogy to the original Star Wars movies tells the story of the tragic downfall of Anakin Skywalker, and his journey to the dark side. Don't expect these to be cheery movies, they are dark and filled with some drama. There is lots of Star Wars action in between, but by no means is this your normal Star Wars story.

Episode one starts out with Anakin as a young boy, who is gifted with tech and force skills. The movie shows what it was like when Anakin was a young boy. The second movie shows how Anakin was once a normal Jedi and how things start changing him. The 3rd movie tells the final tale of Anakin Skywalker before he transforms into the evil Sith lord Darth Vader. It also shows how Emperor Palpatine came to be in power which I really enjoyed.

If your looking for a dark story, with drama and action then these movies are good and look great in blu ray. Much nicer picture with the blu ray, you can see more details in the backgrounds and such. The movies are not perfect, they get criticism but a true Star Wars fan will appreciate them for the story they tell. I think they are not as liked as the originals because the story is darker, and not as fun and cheery as the originals. There is tragedy, darkness, and doom for many Jedi in these. A must have for true Star Wars fans, or fantasy fan.

May the force be with you.. always...",1406764800,,1362,4.271317829457364

7169968,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"I bought this set because the original Revenge of the Sith DVD I had was full screen.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this Blu-Ray/DVD set has new commentaries that the original DVDs didn't have. It also has a ton of closed captioning options, including captioning for the commentaries, which I found quite unusual.  The new commentaries are from ""archival interviews with the cast and crew,"" and there are a lot of people on them.  Just another great source of information on different aspects of making the films.

The films are great, especially the third.  Although George Lucas cannot write dialog worth beans, his storytelling and his imagination are unsurpassed in the science fiction film world.  Putting it all together, along with stunning visuals, makes for a great movie viewing experience, and with the Blu-Rays and a nice sized TV, it's about as close as you can get to a theater experience without the actual theater.

The quality of the Blu-Rays is, of course, far above that of the DVDs.  Many people don't really see hi definition as being all that important, but with films such as these it creates a much more robust viewing experience.  When you see things like the nighttime city skyline it's absolutely amazing. The physical discs are the highest quality discs I have seen.  The Blu-Rays are nice and heavy with a nearly scratch resistant coating on them.  The DVDs are of quality as well.  These are not some ""cheap as you can make them"" discs.

Also, considering that normally you would pay, on average, anywhere from $10 to $20 for the each DVD, and slightly more for each Blu-Ray, the price for this set is amazing.  I gave the DVDs to my stepfather as he has no Blu-Ray player as of yet.

7170005,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"Before I had purchased this collection, I had recently bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Original-Star-Wars-Trilogy-Collection/dp/B00E9PMMX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Original Star Wars Trilogy Collection</a>&nbsp;in the same type of volume, with three Blu-Ray discs and three normal DVDs. And I must say, I was really amazed with that one: they took movies as old as those and made them look almost like a movie released nowadays without taking away any of it's originality. And considering that the prequel trilogy was released more recently and already had amazing CGI and effects, I expected quite allot from this volume. And I wasn't disappointed in the least.

The original DVD releases for each of the prequel trilogy episodes are of pretty high quality in themselves. But here, on Blu-Ray, the quality, picture and sound are just outstandingly amazing. There is no ""digital noise"" to be seen here, a problem which really bugged me with there previous releases: especially in the first episode, which had the most room for improvement regarding its quality. And even the third episode, which is of the highest quality standards, makes the original releases look like nothing. Allot of the color and hazing problems of the first two episodes (the third one didn't' need any fixing up in this area) have been fixed and updated and now look more vibrant and sharp than ever. Also, several CG mistakes have been fixed, such as the two-headed pod race announcer's hand going striate through his jacket. And several cool deleted scenes have been re-inserted, such as each of the pod racers from episode 1 being introduced by the announcer to the crowed. Other updates include several of the really puppet-looking aliens (like the terrible, cross eyed stone-faced puppet of Yoda) have been replaced by CG versions of them that look just awesome. And the sound quality...in one word, AMAZING! The sound has been balanced quite well, so that you won't need to be constantly turning up the volume significantly at the scenes with more dialogue and turning the volume down drastically at the really intense action scenes. And the sound effects have been greatly enhanced and are just so amazing that it's nearly mind boggling. Especially in the 2nd episode, which has, by far, the great sound effects of the whole saga. This film really deserves the highest honors on it's sound.

The only real problem that I have had with this is the lack of bonus features, a factor that I also had a problem with in the other Blu-Ray + DVD release of the original trilogy. The only bonus features that are included here are two different commentaries for each movie: for each one of the movies, one commentary with George Lucas and the crew, and the other one being compiled from archival interviews with cast and crew. And while both of the Audio Commentary tracks are quite interesting, it just isn't enough. Now I know that the reason for this is because the makers want everybody to buy the more-expensive&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Complete-Saga-on-Blu-ray/dp/B003ZSJ212/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Complete Saga on Blu-ray</a>&nbsp;release, which has three discs filled with bonus features. But I still think that this volume could really benefit with at least a few more bonus features (or at least make it an option to view the unaltered version of each film) that would give it a much greater value.

On the physical qualities: the volume comes in a pretty nice slipcover that won't wrinkle or fall apart easily. The case is quite strong and will close up without any struggle and won't fly open if it's simply dropped. But it's still pretty easy to open it manually without any difficulties. It comes, as you probably already know, three Blu-Ray discs and three normal DVDs. The Blu-Ray discs are much thicker and more scratch resistant than normal DVDs, making them more protected if they should fall into the wrong hands (or, in other words, SMALL hands). They also don't bend easily and won't crack under any great pressure. The DVDs are just like normal DVDs, but as you might have figured out as to what I said above, the quality of the prequel trilogy films on them are of much higher quality than any previous DVD release of the prequel trilogy that I have seen.

Overall, this is a great volume that will benefit any Star Wars lover's collection. Even though it may not have all the bonus features that the Complete Saga release has, it has its own advantages: the fact that it comes with both Blu-Ray and DVD discs gives it a better traveling value: you can use the Blu-Ray discs for watching in your own living room, and use the normal DVDs for on the go when there are usually no devices for playing movies that support Blu-Ray. The movies look just amazing and the sound quality is of the highest standard. And the DVDs are of the highest quality as well: nowhere near as good as the Blu-Ray discs, but defiantly the highest quality DVD release of all of the prequel trilogy films. A great collection that is worth the money. Star Wars lover or just a regular film watcher, this is sure to please and to be enjoyed by all.",1392336000,232,5227,5.039306358381503

7170017,1,B00XJ8HAHG,"The summation of these movies is --

Based on a hedged promise from a known liar and manipulator, Anakin Skywalker on his own free will turns and kills everything he fought for in his entire adult life, friends, colleagues, and little children.

Because he was afraid his secret wife was going to die.

Even though she's completely fine.

Even though the person promising him that he could save her admitted that he didn't really know how to save her, but that he might be able to figure it out.

One day.

But in the meantime, would you please go kill a few million people for me?

Especially little children.

These movies are extremely bad. The writing is simply atrocious, some of the worst writing I have ever seen in movies. They give the impression that they simply were not planned and plotted out. Instead, I get the impression that it is a bunch of impulses. Then, like a high-schooler cramming to meet the deadline, characters make incredibly illogical and out of character choices so that the necessary plot points can be hit.

So Anakin Skywalker makes this very stupid choice, which really there is no argument for. Palpatine, the big evil, does his dastardly deed and scheming because...just for the heck of it. Just because, why not? The other various villains in the movies are numerous to the point of being anonymous. Count Dooku shows up at the end of Attack of the Clones and is dead at the beginning of Revenge of the Sith. His motivations are just as inane as Skywalker's. There is a General Grievous who shows up at the beginning of Revenge of the Sith and is dead about halfway through the movie. He doesn't have any motivations at all. In that time, no dread is built up. Unlike the first trilogy where we have one clear villain: Vader, in the prequels the villains are a succession of toys to be bought at target for $14.99.

The thing about writing is that it is hard work. You have to plan out the payoffs and plot points. It appears that no real effort was made to do this in these movies. Things just happen, in a shower of CGI sparkles, without any payoff, without any converging themes or story elements.

Speaking of CGI, they cheapen the experience. Creativity comes from constraint, but CGI allows for lazy shots of basically computer screensavers, like something you'd see in a Windows default background screen. There is no magic at all in seeing the craftsmanship which went into making static models appear like they are flying -- just do it in the computer! The enemies that the Jedi are facing are mindless droids. The battles are similarly mindless and devoid of emotion. Significant important battles have heavy CGI. Yoda especially is depicted as a tasmanian devil -- which goes completely against the Yoda of Empire Strikes Back, who was basically an Indian mystic, frail in body but strong in mind...no, in the prequels the Force is no longer mystical or religious, but is pretty much technological. Dependable, predictable, done with the press of a CGI button.

Worst of worst, Lucas even had the gall to scar the original trilogies with dancing CGI thingies, and cast from the prequel trilogy. It is completely arrogant, and it is simply bad filmmaking.

Seriously, the only comparable movie to this might be Battlefield Earth. Even most cheap B-movies like Jumper at least have discernible scripts and motivations. The prequels are just a jumbled mess.

Lucasfilm was recently acquired by Disney, so there is some hope. One can at least hope that one day the original theatrical versions of the movies will be released in the appropriate high definition format, without any CGI scarring.

One can hope that one day the prequels will simply be remade. It could happen.

I would spend hour after hour watching these films when as a boy, and I would always pretend to be a Jedi slashing up battle droids! People always complain about these films. Fans accuse them of ruining the Star Wars franchise; they now call Lucas a monster because of their existence, and whenever I've mentioned them to other people, they instantly associate the movies with Jar Jar Binks (even Episode III; if you don't believe me, just surf the web. You won't believe all the hate-attacks I've seen directed towards Lucas and these films). Seriously, I think the old time fans need to calm the heck down! In the words of the Scarecrow from BATMAN BEGINS just before he sets a gasoline doused Batman ablaze, ""My opinion, you need to lighten up!""

Okay I'm rambling; lets just get on with the review.

If you haven't noticed by now, yes I am a Star Wars fan. Both the original and prequel trilogies were major sources of entertainment for me as a child and will continue to be for the rest of my life. I'm not alone, as the Star Wars saga has become a phenomenon of American culture. The first of the series to be released, STAR WARS (later renamed EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE) helped revolutionize the film industry through its groundbreaking special effects, innovative storyline, and its unforgettable cast of characters including Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Vader. The success of A NEW HOPE led to the release of EPISODE V: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, which was not only one of the few successful sequels of the time, but also it brought a darker tone to the series, introduced Yoda, and revealed that Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father. The original trilogy was then concluded with EPISODE VI: RETURN OF THE JEDI, finally ending the conflict between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire, as well as the redeeming of Darth Vader, aka Anakin Skywalker. The three original Star Wars films are now regarded as timeless classics that will live forever, like the force itself. However the prequels, which were released nineteen years later, have been a constant target of criticism and hate-attacks from fans of the original trilogy. I admit that this bothers me more than it should, because these were the Star Wars films that I grew up with and cherished. Of course, now I realize that they did possess a couple of flaws in their creation, but it's still no excuse for fanboys to constantly whine and complain about the prequels or call Lucas the ""Hitler"" of the film industry. Of course, my review won't be able to counter all of the evils fans have placed on these films; it will bring a new perspective onto the most prominent ones I have seen over the Internet. Criticism is one thing, but downright hateful bashing towards the movies and their creator is an entirely different story.

STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE:
Acting as the beginning of the saga, the plot of Episode I revolves around the invasion of the peaceful planet of Naboo. As the turmoil over taxation routes engulfs the Galactic Republic, the Trade Federation blockades Naboo with an armada of deadly warships to halt all trade towards the small planet. When two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jin (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), are sent by the chancellor to force the federation out of the system, the greedy Viceroy Nute Gunnray is ordered by the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious, to launch an invasion on the planet, and eradicate the Jedi. After evading the federation's battle droids, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan help Naboo's Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) escape the planet, but their starship is unable to make it to the Republic capital of Coruscant after having their hyperdrive destroyed while fleeing the blockade. Forced to land on the small planet of Tatooine, it is here where the group meets a young slave named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), who has an unusually strong connection to the force and is believed by Qui-Gon to be linked to a prophecy that speaks of a Jedi that will help bring balance to the force. But while on Tatooine, the true motives behind the invasion are revealed to be more than just a tax dispute as a mysterious new antagonist reveals the existence of the Sith, practitioners of the dark side of the force, who seek the destruction of the Jedi order and the light side of the force.

Many people consider THE PHANTOM MENACE to be the worst film of the franchise, criticizing the directing of the storyline, the dialogue between characters, Jar Jar Binks (probably the most hated character of the Star Wars universe), as well as citing it as an excuse to show off CGI special effects and market toys to children (I'm referring to Binks here). I disagree, however, as while the critics have valid points in their argument, there were many innovating aspects of this film. I particularly enjoyed BADA** LIAM NEESON'S (sorry, but Liam Neeson is like my equivalent to Chuck Norris) performance as Qui-Gon Jin, as while he did die prematurely, his role as Obi-Wan's master was sensational, as he endows his apprentice with the morals soon make him a great Jedi (Qui-Gon's calm and wise personality is essentially passed on to a timid and inexperienced Obi-Wan), and he helps Anakin begin his path which determines the course of the saga. I also loved how Qui-Gon was a risk taker, as while some may question his decisions, he feels that the risks are necessary in order to do what he feels is necessary for the good of the galaxy. It gives his character a layer of moral ambiguity that I find fascinating (taking risks does not make his character a bad one; take notes Plinkett). I will never understand why people are so harsh towards Jake Lloyd's role as the young Anakin Skywalker, and constantly bombard him with hatred. Criticism towards child actors is something that I will not tolerate under any circumstances, as he was just a kid, and was too young to handle all of the hateful bashing he's receive all over the internet. The haters so quick to denounce his character, protesting that they see no signs of him eventually becoming Darth Vader and that he's just an overly excited, cheerful brat. Again I have to disagree, as Anakin was only nine in this film, so it's unlikely he exhibited any signs of the dark side in him, and I enjoyed Lloyd's performance. I found his status as a slave to be a perfect background for him, as it gives the audience his reasons for wanting to become a Jedi, and his cheerful personality is likely because he strives for a better life than that of a slave and is ignorant towards the hardships Jedi life will bring him. As I am defending TPM, you all knew I was going to have to give my diagnosis on Jar Jar Binks, but I'm going to make this part as brief as I can (I'd rather not receive hate-messages from whiny fanboys). Although most Star Wars fans instantly hate this character, I honestly never held any contempt against him, and although he can be a tad bit more annoying now that I'm older, I still find a few of his moments in the film mildly humorous. Another subject of criticism is that the Trade Federation invades Naboo because of a tax dispute with the galactic senate. While I myself am not a fan of over usage of political themes, keep in mind that the tax embargo was simply a cover that allowed the Sith to place themselves in a position where they could begin their plan to take over the galaxy (Qui Gon himself mentions ""there's something else behind all this""), and the political themes serve to convey the gradual decline of democracy in the galaxy that will give way to the Empire.

While these aren't the only criticisms I've seen directed towards THE PHANTOM MENACE (Midichlorians are also a big one; which I also don't have a problem with), I believe that this film has received too much negative attention that it doesn't deserve. I can understand why nostalgic fanboys believe this film didn't match the greatness of the original trilogy, but I felt the film offered many great innovations to the Star Wars Universe that were different, but unique in my eyes. Anyone who could hate Darth Maul wielding a double-bladed lightsaber, or a desert pod-race that reflects BEN HUR is clouded from the true nature of the force in my point of view.

STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES:
Taking place ten years after the invasion of Naboo, the galactic republic is now on the verge of division. Countless star systems have begun to secede from the republic, leading to the development of a separatist alliance led by former Jedi, now apprentice of Darth Sidious, Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). In the wake of this crisis, Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), former queen of Naboo, has returned to Coruscant to fight against a bill that would allow the creation of a republic military, in the hopes of avoiding war. However, once she arrives her ship is destroyed in an attempt to claim the young senator's life. Having survived only through the use of a decoy, Padme is placed under the protection of Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). After preventing a second assassination attempt, the two Jedi capture the assailant, but before she could reveal who hired her, she was shot with a poison saberdart. Obi Wan uses the dart to track the murderer to the stormy planet Kamino, where he learns that the planet's inhabitants have been manufacturing in secret, an army of clones for the galactic republic. Meanwhile, Anakin is assigned by the Jedi Council to watch over Padme back on her home planet Naboo, where the two slowly begin to form a romantic relationship. However, their actions go against Jedi lore, as attachment to earthly matter is forbidden.

ATTACK OF THE CLONES doesn't match up to the grandeur of the other five films, but I still found it to be a good movie that retained the same elements that are the Star Wars. Although it wasn't criticized to the extent that TPM was, fanboys of the original trilogy constantly bash this film as if it ruined their childhood. The element of ATTACK OF THE CLONES that is criticized the most is the romance between Anakin and Padme. Fans and critics alike have claimed the dialogue between the two lovers to be wooden and cliched, having no emotion or believability to it whatsoever. As a child watching these films over and over again, I was unaware of the criticism they were receiving so I was completely surprised that a majority of people hated Anakin and Padme's romance. In my perspective, I view their relationship as a ""Romeo and Juliet"" type story. While the Jedi are encouraged to love unconditionally, attachment is forbidden as if one were to lose the object of their desire; they would be plagued by despair and vengeance, making them susceptible to the dark side. I know that some people believe that this makes Jedi by definition, emotionless, contradicting Luke's spirited attitude in the original trilogy. Keep in mind, however, Jedi are required to be compassionate to others, and Luke's feelings for his sister Leia nearly brought him over to the dark side in RETURN OF THE JEDI. The forbidden love between Anakin and Padme works well for the story in my point of view, as it helps set up the story for Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader in REVENGE OF THE SITH. I admit that some parts of the romantic dialogue were cheesy, but I felt they actually brought a Shakespearean tone to their love, enhancing the ""Romeo and Juliet"" feel of the story (it still baffles me to why no one else has commented on this type of chemistry in their love). The other prominent criticism I've seen that nearly ties with the romance is Hayden Christensen's role as Anakin. Fans claim him to be a whiny brat with flat dialogue, and an undeveloped character. Again I have to disagree as I don't view Anakin's outbursts as whining, but rather as arrogance that results from his superior prowess as a Jedi. One of the few truths in this world (or the galaxy) is that all men with power simply want more power. Lucas decided to have Christensen play Anakin in this manner, as he wanted to have a character that exhibited early stages of the dark side within him. Christensen executes such a role expertly, as Skywalker feels like the Jedi are holding him back from gaining power or experiencing emotional love, and he slaughters an entire tribe of Tusken Raiders that killed his mother in a moment of understandable rage. The final element of the film (and the prequels in general) that has been massively criticized is the CGI special effects. Fans whine about the CGI as they all claim that they know it's not really there and that it looks like PS2 graphics. BULLCRAP!!! Have these guys ever played an actual PS2 game?! PS2 graphics look much cheaper than the effects in these films (and the graphics in modern games don't count as this movie was made back in 2002). Also, the fact that it's all CGI and green-screen technology doesn't bother me as the creatures and environments have great designs and textures, and I'm able to suspend my disbelief and say, ""Yes, these characters live in a universe where outlandish planets and creatures exist.""

In my personal opinion, this film is the weakest of the franchise, but I still found it to be an enjoyable film that again, like THE PHANTOM MENACE, receives a large amount of negative criticism that it doesn't deserve. The romance between Anakin and Padme, in my opinion, should've been seen as a Shakespearean influence rather than a cliched acting (maybe it wasn't, but that's how I see it), and Christensen's Anakin has been labeled as a whiny complainer when he is really a troubled young man who feels the Jedi ways are pushing him away from everything else he holds dear. The best aspect of the film is Ewan McGregor's incarnation of Obi-Wan, as he displays total confidence in battle and provides humorous dialogue and one-liners (his ""Oh blast! This is why I hate flying"" line while being shot at by Jango Fett's ship through an asteroid field was my favorite in this film, and I love it when he jumps down behind General Grievous in Episode III and calmly states, ""Hello there!"" (Just bada**)). Also the clones provide the backstory for the stormtroopers, and the droid factory and Jedi fight in the battle arena on Genenosis provide some of the best visual effects the series has seen (they're pure eye-candy)! AOTC is not my favorite of the series, and while the film's not perfect, fans need to catch a hint that their hateful bashing is making them the real whiners, and not Christensen's Anakin (what hypocrites...).

STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH
Three years into the clone wars, Anakin Skywalker, now a Jedi Knight, and Obi-Wan Kenobi rescue Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the elusive cyborg General Grievous (voiced by Matthew Wood), who daringly kidnapped the chancellor during a surprise separatist invasion of Coruscant. After Anakin kills Count Dooku and returns Palpatine to safety, he learns from his wife Padme that she is now pregnant with twins (who we know to be Luke and Leia). Soon afterwards, Anakin experiences a nightmare of Padme dying during childbirth, and fears that it will become a reality just like the dreams he had about his mother did. As the clone wars near their end, the Jedi Council assigns Anakin to act as a double agent for Palpatine, as the Jedi fear that he won't give up his emergency war powers once Grievous is eliminated. As Anakin spies on Palpatine, conflicted between his loyalties to the Jedi and the republic, Palpatine reveals to Anakin that he is in reality the dark lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, as he knows the ways of the force, and that the dark side can grant one the ability to prevent others from dying. Wishing to save his wife, Anakin is eventually seduced by Palpatine who promises to teach him the power to overcome death itself. Known reborn as Darth Vader, young Skywalker exterminates the Jedi order and the Separatist leaders, allowing Palpatine to convert the republic into the galactic empire. With only Obi Wan and Yoda surviving the Jedi Purge, will they be able to bring down Emperor Palpatine and his new apprentice, or will the Sith accomplish their goal to rule the galaxy?

My defensive critique for this film is going to be short, as the final film of the prequel trilogy (and my personal favorite of the saga as a whole) has been widely praised in stark contrast to the previous two installments, and has been considered to be the best Star Wars film since THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (fan favorite of the original trilogy). Of the few negative comments I've seen directed towards Episode III, the most prominent ones I've seen are again towards Hayden Christensen's role as Anakin, as well as the love scenes with Padme (which I've already critiqued). One criticism that is reviled on the Internet for reasons I don't understand is Darth Vader's ""NOOOO!!!"" when he realizes he killed Padme (though I have to admit it has become a funny internet meme, even though the ""NOOO"" itself doesn't bother me). People claimed that one line ruined the film, but I disagree as while I still found it a little too over-the-top and dramatic, I could feel Vader's pain as he realizes he killed the one he loved the most. High points of Episode III include McDiarmid's subtle yet over-the-top performance as the Emperor, and McGregor's cool and collected version of Obi-Wan, Christensen's development into Darth Vader being interpreted as a Shakespearian tragedy, General Grievous and his simultaneous wielding of four lightsaber (whose now become one of my favorite Star Wars villains; and has one of the best character designs I've ever seen in my life), and final climactic battle on Mustafar between Anakin and Obi-Wan which may be the best lightsaber duel in the entire saga (which was only 13 minutes long and not 45 minutes you liars!!! I looked up the time on YouTube!).

I'm fine with people rationally criticizing films or books for flaws in their creation, but whenever it escalates into constant hateful bashing towards both the film and it's creator, it really irritates me. Long time fanboys continuously accuse the prequels of ruining their lives, and that George Lucas raped their childhood by creating them (anyone who actually believes that needs to see a shrink if you ask me, and you won't believe how many fans I've seen use that phrase). I personally feel that there are boundaries to how far criticism should go, and these whining fanboys have surpassed that limit. Lucas and the prequels don't deserve all the hate they've received, as these films provide innovating plots, entertaining characters, and awesome CGI special effects (which still hold up well in my opinion). They're not perfect, but fans need to realize that they're only movies, and need to move on with their lives instead of constantly complaining about them. Not only has it become extremely annoying, but it also ruins the reputations of the films for those who have the potential to enjoy them.

For those who do enjoy the prequels, the force will be with you, always.

7170032,2,B00XJ8HAHG,"To me the ""prequel trilogy"" is something of a children's toy version of something that aspires to be movies. But let's be honest, they are not, These are high tech video games with computer generated characters, environments and a manipulative, primitive and ridiculous plot with more than cheesy dialogue.
The one aspect that makes these computer generated cartoons watchable is the music by maestro John Williams, whose talent as a composer is so great that he cannot give but the most wonderful and amazing music that elevates (not easily but manages) even these so called films.
It clearly shows that by that point George Lucas had unlimited creative sontrol over this franchise and no Lawrence Kasdan to write a magnificient screenplay. What he ended up with is animation for 6 year olds with a phenomenal music. But it certainly has nothing to do with the Star Wars that people have loved since 1977. It's the stupidified, simplified, infantilised version of it. Too bad, because with a really good screen writer and a good director, like say Spielberg, Jackson, Cameron or Fincher, they could've made three awesome films worthy of the name Star Wars. But for me at least, these films simply don't exist in the Star Wars universe.

Since I finally upgraded my old blue tube televisions to the wide screen LCD/LED televisions and only having the older DVD's offering the standard screen sizes, I wanted the newer disks offering the wide screen formats as I tend to watch these movies once a year.

Some of the specifications of these newer DVD/Blu-ray disks published on October 2013 were not completely disclosed within Amazon.com's product information, likely due to this product containing both DVD & Blu-ray disks which usually contain different video resolutions and audio bitrates only due to disk capacities.

For Linux users, see Note 2 concerning encrypted Blu-ray movies.  Had there been no method of playing the Blu-ray movies on Linux, I would not have bought the product.

When performing any backup of copyrighted material, ensure you understand the law.  This is terrible because I usually only play the video media, and only revert to the backup processing of video media when the media goes bad.

7170060,1,B00XJ8HAHG,"the movies are just incredibly bad on so many levels it's not even funny and I can only attribute this to the laziness of George Lucas.  He had mountains of money (billions) and time (20 years) to plan out the most amazing star wars films, at least on par or close to the originals...but he failed spectacularly.

I attribute the failure primarily to his overuse of CGI and general laziness in mapping out the plot.  The overuse of CGI was the true cause of the wooden acting in my opinion and the lack of a ""real"" feeling.  The plot was also just incredibly stupid.  There were also a million foolish things that make no sense, we go back and forth between seeing Anikan sadistically kill children to seeing slapstick robot humor, it really makes no sense.  I have no idea what genre this film is and nothing makes any sense.

And although the cast was filled with talented actors, Anikan was miscast twice imo.  And the love story was not believable.  Padme was too much of a hard-head and Hayden was too much of a whiner.  The two would have hated one another irl and we can just sense it on screen by the way the characters treat one another.  Padme seems to hate Anikan and Anikan's character seems more interested in adventure and power than girls.

7170078,3,B00XJ8HAHG,"I remember how unexpected the release of the new Star Wars films was almost ten years ago. Looking back I can admit that only Revenge of the Sith really did the Star Wars universe any justice. Phantom Menace was annoying and Attack of the Clones was fairly bland. Jar Jar Binks was about as cool as Howard the Duck. When we see the characters in the new trilogy there is an even greater focus on toys. It seems none of the actors provided the depth and memorability of Ford, Fisher and Hamill did. Star Wars VII linking all the films together would be fantastic if it receives a solid script.

This isn't the deluxe release of these films so if you want more extras then check out the other Star Wars box sets on Blu-ray or DVD.

Are there memorable lines, scenes and dialogue?  Great acting? Ummmmm not really.  I wish Jar Jar and young Anakin would fall off the universe, they're so bad.

7170081,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"Star Wars is very deep, not simply about wars in the stars.  The prequels represents what is happening and what will happen in this country and the world (as you can see the empire gobbling up lands on the news as we speak) and how only a few cause all of the problems of most people, for their selfish, greedy reasons.

I would advise everyone to pick up this version before the Disney versions slight revise some of the films in order to change some of the core meaning of the stories around.  I still don't believe that Lucas sold his nation changing creation (he was anti-Hollywood too) of his free will.  He did not look like a guy who wanted to sell, plus he gave away ALL of the money he was paid for Lucasfilm.  That alone says a lot!  If he was going to do that, he could have just given away LF to many people!  The films have meaning that reflect real life and the empire got to Lucas as well.",1378080000,,904,4.160919540229885

Everyone always seems to make fun of Anakin and Padme courting scenes, but if you think about it, Anakin is just being an ankward teen trying for his first girlfriend, one he obsessed over for years.  And as for Jar Jar, the other common complaint, I never noticed how everyone else makes fun of him the entire first movie, and it's really quite amusing.  The CGI yoda in episode 1 is a welcome change in the blu ray version.  Also the quality of the blu ray is far better than the dvd version.  It's been fun watching these movies again and thinking about how the sith plot unfolds.  The best thing about this movie are the details left out, like who Sifa-diyas was, and it makes me think and hypothesize about the background story.

7170093,3,B00XJ8HAHG,"This prequel trilogy had to come down to $30 for me to pull the trigger. I have done my share of double-dipping on Star Wars. I already owned Episodes II & III on DVD, yet found the Blu Ray tempting and I wanted to see if Episode I got any better.

I bought just this prequel trilogy, because I decided not to double-dip the original trilogy. I have the DVD Special Edition with the letterbox ""original"" bonus discs. Though low res and hardly perfect, most of the original award-winning editing is intact: Han shoots first, no CGI Jabba, no CGI Wampa, Cloud City doesn't look like a throw away CGI file from Coruscant, etc.

I am sure sometime in the future, the pure original ""theatrical"" trilogy will be released using the highest res frame scan to Blu Ray. This is because you, me, and about 500 million other people will gladly pay $70 for 3 old movies we have already seen 500 times. There is no way Disney will listen to George and say no to that kind of revenue. It's only a matter of time.

Besides, the original trilogy is not the high altar some make it. You are really just buying it for 2 movies. Every one of the prequels is a better movie than Return Of The Jedi. You know this is true. If you have a problem with Jar Jar and Midichlorians, then you should have a bigger problem with a Teddy Bear taking out the Emperor's Most Elite Warriors... no, the Emperor's Most Elite ARMORED Warriors with rocks and sticks.

But I digress... this review is about the Blu Ray prequels. Watching all 3 movies back to back has improved the experience somewhat. There are serious historical story problems in Episode I especially when trying to fact check Old Man Kenobi's statements about Anakin in Episode IV. And, there are several other character conflicts between 4-6 and 1-3.

In all 3 prequels the character of Yoda has basically been destroyed. Of all the character assassinations Lucas has done, this was the worst. Yoda is an 800-year old Sage. Never to be involved in politics, never to be using the force for offense, never to be a Field General of a clone army, and certainly never to be jumping around like a lizard in a sword fight when ""the force is his ally, and a powerful ally it is."" Certainly his 800-year force skill level must not have been that great if he couldn't sense a much younger and inexperienced Sith Lord in the same room... and later, couldn't even defeat him one on one (when Mace Windu already HAD defeated same Sith Lord one on one).

Despite the Blu Ray, I still have to watch the prequels, particularly Episode's I and II with my hand on the remote so I can skip the horrifyingly wooden performances when the movies are trying (and failing) to be dramatic. Scenes with Anakin and his mother, all romance scenes, all ""friendship"" scenes between Obi Wan and Anakin... basically any scene trying to capture the human condition fails miserably in the prequels (as they had succeeded so well in the original trilogy). I blame this on both the actors and the director... they know who they are.

I've gone through a transformation on Jar Jar when I saw my kid laughing at him, and laughing hard. Maybe he'll grow up to think Jar Jar is absurd and stupid, but he sure is laughing now, what can I say? The ""these movies are for kids"" paradox is the same as the story/character paradox. Do kids understand taxation, governmental bureaucracy, political maneuvering, and the trappings of a military industrial complex? No idea... Jar Jar does make my kid laugh.

The main reason these Blu Rays are worth $10 apiece though is the HD sound and especially the music. Lucas once said the only thing about A New Hope that did not disappoint him was the score of John Williams. In spite of the story controversy, John Williams has rather silently continued his masterful composition of motives for Star Wars themes. It's all about hearing the London Symphony Orchestra at its full HD glory (and not that horrid DVD data compressed soundtrack).

Williams already has experience being a magician (or repairman) with some of George's more absurd ideas. Making the Ewoks somewhat watchable just because of the quirky music and orchestration. Likewise, Williams' Sith themes and love themes do wonders to help the poor execution in screenplay, direction, and acting. Maybe that's why Lucas calls it space opera. Like in some opera, the music is incredible while the story and drama is often laughable despite the lofty themes.

OK, but who writes space opera for children? Another paradox?

These movies are worth having and exploded the Star Wars universe and history. The execution is poor and you end up seeing all 3 movies as a lost opportunity, yet you will still watch them waiting for the next Episodes.",1375056000,6,4728,4.650299401197604

7170108,3,B00XJ8HAHG,"1. Not much to say about the movies that people don't already know. If Lucas tried as hard with the dialogue and acting as much as he did with the special effects (the only thing he put focused effort on), they would be spectacular. They are what they are at this point. 2 stars

2. This Blu-Ray version is amazing in terms of picture and sound but in terms of special features: NOTHING. Unless you get the entire 6 movie collection do you get the extras. I already have the special edition original trilogy (with that hack actor Hayden Christiansen as Anakin at the end of Jedi)on DVD and Lucas, despite the overwhelming negative response to his tinkering, still tinkered more with the Blu-Ray versions. Why would I want that? 3 stars

3. I received this shipment very fast and in good condition. 5 stars for seller",1372291200,3,816,4.54421768707483

7170145,4,B00XJ8HAHG,Ohh my God!! I was just watching these movies and all I have to say is that is really great to be able to watch such a great trilogy on HD.  The only cons that I have with these movies are that you can't set up the audio to run at 5.1 without the commentaries.  You can have audio set up to 6.1 without commentaries but for my luck my receiver only process audio up to 5.1.,1368230400,,373,3.831168831168831

7170149,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"I believe that if you purchase a premium HD product, it should stand out for ease of use and convenience. Too many legal bumpers at the start of these movies makes viewing irksome at first. And you can't skip over them. It's okay for the incipid lawyers to demand mandatory viewing, but for such a premium product, I would expect (1) to have a choice to skip bumpers.

Also, I believe that for the purchase, a digital copy would be made available. In this day and age, it's inconceivable that one could not be made available to LEGITIMATE BUYERS.",1367712000,,546,4.515151515151516
7170150,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"These movies are great! When folks grew up on Hope, Empire & Jedi, they were just kids! When it was time for Menace, Clones & Sith, they expected star wars to grow too! Revenge of the Sith is the only star wars film to be rated PG-13, so far, yet it wasn't enough to please most of the first generation of fans! They wanted new movies rated R or Hardcore NC-17!

Had the internet existed in 1977, there would be just as many bad reviews for the sequels to Menace, Clones & Sith! Had they been filmed in chronological order, they would be hating Hope, Empire & Jedi!
People argued that star wars didn't belong to George Lucas even when they stopped buying home videos in 1997, but that doesn't hold up in Court

Until now! George Lucas sold Lucasfilm to Disney, now they aren't his films! I doubt episode seven will get the R rating, so I'm sure it'll have just as many bad reviews! May 2015 feels like a long way from now!",1366848000,,922,4.2628571428571425

7170158,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"People need to understand that you can't keep repeating the phenomenon with the same franchise
over and over again!
I personally enjoyed these movies!
Star Wars; Episode 1: The Phantom Menace
What I liked was:
1. Darth Maul was just scary and cool (my favorite Star Wars character)!
2. All the actors did their best to bring their characters to life!
3. The action was exciting!
4. The Pod Race was awesome!
5. The visual effects were stunning!

What I didn't like was:
1. The movies pace dragged at times!
2. Although the Pod Race was awesome, the whole movie seemed to stop it's plot
for the race to take place!
3. Jar Jar Binks was just annoying!

Overall, it is a welcome edition to the Star Wars universe, but had potential
to be a bit more than it was...
My grade: B or three-and-a-half stars!

Star Wars: Episode 2; Attack of the Clones
Better than 'The Phantom Menace' but still lacked the flowing pace
of the first three movies!
What I liked was:
1. The battle on Geonosis was awesome!
2. We see that Yoda can be lethal!
3. The battle between Jango Fett and Obi-Wan Kenobi was great!
4. Again the visual effects were amazing!
5. The plot(for the most part) flowed through well!
6. The individual plots tied in-together well through out the movie!

What I didn't like was:
1. The movie's pace was a little too slow at times.

Overall: This was a very entertaining movie! More entertaining than the last one!
My grade: B+ or four stars!

Star Wars; Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith
Probably the most intense of the prequels!
What I liked about this movie was:
1. The battles were awesome!
2. Once again the visual effects were astonishing!
3. General Grievous was a great villain!
4. Five light saber duels in one Star Wars movie?!?! How cool
is that for fans!

What I didn't like was:
1. In 'Return of the Jedi', Leia said that she remembered her 'real' mother from when she
was very young, but in this this movie Padme' dies right after she is born! That was clearly
a plot glitch!
2. The movie had a few slow parts in it!

Overall: I recommend this movie to any Star Wars fan as much as I would recommend the second movie!
My grade B+ or four stars!

Bottom Line:
All three of these movie may not be as fully satisfying as episodes 4,5,and 6, but are still very
fun to watch! All three of them are great movies!
My overall grade is: B+ or four stars!",1364601600,3,2358,4.377574370709382
7170159,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"Awesome; star wars on blu ray. All the movies have amazing quality and sound. Now I do a small review on the movies.

The Phantom Menace: Terrible movie, so childish and dumb I liked it until I turned 10 or 11 years old. Lucas thought he could release this and get some good money off of it and not try to make a great movie like the original trilogy.  3 good things in this movie 1. The Character of Darth Maul 2. The Character of Qui Gon Jinn 3. The Final lightsaber duel. Defiantly the worst in the series.

Attack Of The Clones: Gigantic improvement over the Phantom Menace. It brought back what made star wars fun again and reminds me of the perfect ""Empire Strikes Back"" You got the clones, Jango Fett, and the acting has drastically improved 3 best parts are. 1. The Lightsaber Duel 2. Jango Fett vs. Obi Wan 3. When the clones attack during the battle of geonosis.  My personal favorite of the prequels.

Revenge Of The Sith: Awesome movie again.  Very dark movie defiantly the darkest in the series by far. Has the most action and is at its best.  So many lightsaber duels and yeah. 3 best parts 1. The Final lightsaber duel against obi wan and anakin 2. the order 66 order from palpatine 3. Mace Windu vs. Palpatine.

1. The Empire Strikes Back (5/5)
2. Attack Of The Clones (5/5)
3. Revenge Of The Sith (5/5)
4. A New Hope (5/5)
5. Return Of The Jedi (5/5)
6. The Phantom Menace (2/5) (it sucked)",1364428800,,1407,4.32319391634981

7170233,1,B00XJ8HAHG,"Ironically, George Lucas has become the Emperor that his movies rail against.

With unlimited resources and absolute control, Star Wars prequel episodes I-III are successive duds when compared to the original trilogy.

Episode I makes us suffer through Jake Lloyd's performance as Anakin Skywalker.  You really can't blame the actor - he was hand-picked by George.  There's a segment in one of the bonus features (on my Episode I DVD, not in this Blu ray 3 pack) that shows Lucas intently scrutinizing one of Lloyd's performances. What is going on in the man's mind is unfathomable, but the end result is dismal.

Then we have Jar Jar Binks,  probably the most universally despised computer animated character that will ever  grace a big budget movie.  There is no doubt that George must have been aware of the avalanche of  negative feedback this character generated in Episode I,  yet  as if to thumb his nose at the fans, he sticks ole Lizard Boy in episodes II & III (albeit to diminishing degrees).

The last straw for me,  Episode I -wise, was the inclusion of the concept of ""midichlorians""  as a physical, measurable component of  The Force.  Here, Lucas  takes  one of the best  ""less is more""  concepts in all of moviedom and unnecessarily pollutes it.

Episodes II and III fare little better.

George Lucas' best work was done  when he was under pressure and had  a limited budget to work with (American Graffiti and the original Star Wars).  The franchise  also proved very successful when he farmed out the  director duties (The Empire Strikes Back).

Unfortunately what we have at this point is a spoiled kid, gleefully shoveling sprinkles onto his ice cream, and the resulting gaudy concoctions induce a belly ache.",1342051200,15,1730,4.872413793103449

I am sure there are some changes here as well (have not read other reviews); I know some changes were made to Yoda in episode I, but it has honestly been so long since I have seen any of these I really didn't notice.

Episode I still makes me cringe with Jar Jar and the actor playing Anikan. I would say this is for sure my least favorite of the entire series.

7170243,1,B00XJ8HAHG,"This is for anyone who has not yet wasted there money on these three absolute pathetic attempts at re-creating the wonder of the original series. These movies don't just contain plot holes -- they are THE horrific plot hole that ruins the entire series. I will focus on the three items that in my opinion are the most glaring.

First: Obi Wan has a complete an utter lack of knowledge of R2D2 and C3PO in the original... and yet in the prequels he spend hours with them, knows their names, bad habits, and favorite colors.... not just odd... stupid. I must assume Obi-Wan is not the problem.... Lucas must have had his memory erased while watching Men in Black.

Second, A scientific explanation of the force is given that destroys the magic of the movies. Thus violating J.R.R. Tolkien's number one principle of good storytelling (and making the films a bad imitation of Star Trek in the process) - NEVER EXPLAIN THE MAGIC!!!!!!!!!!!!

Third, the Jedi have become a pathetic group of celibate morons who can be killed like flies by any Sith lowlife. Further, and perhaps worse, in the third of these sad films, Obi-Wan actually undermines the entire series with one utterance: ""Only the Sith deal in absolutes."" If this is the case what has the whole light side/dark side been, Lucas? Political correctness brought to a Galaxy far, far way thanks to an out of touch, now member of the Hollywood elite, that has proven he has forgotten how to make a good film...Crystal Skull anyone?

P.S. ...I didn't even mention the sacrilegious ""Virgin Birth"" fiasco... oops!

P.P.S. I almost forgot to mention..there is one good thing about these films...buy the soundtracks! John Williams delivers where Lucas fails!",1332028800,31,1705,4.845360824742268

7170245,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"Ok, so I was never a huge fan of these three movies. I bought the bluray because I said ""Hey, it can only get better right?""  Generally speaking I was right.  There are a few things that were changes I wouldn't have, however there are more improvements than I can remember and they are much better than their originals(maybe with the exception of III)

So here are some of the things I noticed.

Episode I:  (The best IMO)
Jar-jar CGI is better.  Still not amazing, but better.

Eye lids added to some of the aliens like the Nemoidian Viceroy and the rest of his species.

Ships and vehicles have much better CGI including lighting, damage/grit and Engine effects.  First thing that blew me away was the beginning shot with the yellow engines glowing spectacularly on the ""Ambassadors'"" cruiser.

Podrace looked better to me

Every shot of a city or landscape seems to have been redone and they all look amazing.

All effects, weapons and lighting have been enhanced and also look great.

Yoda is now CGI.  Huge improvement on the awful puppet yoda.

Episode II: (I didn't see as much here, but similar things were done.)
Small scenes added, effects and landscapes have all been enhanced or redone.

Episode III: (the only  one with edits I didn't like)
There were a bunch of little CGI scenes added, specifically with starfighters involved. (See demise of Plo-Koon at order 66)

Certain scenes were re-cut(for example, see the first scene in the begining with Anikin and Obi-wan talking while in starfighters).  Some of them were not well done and look kind of butchered, others are ok.

7170250,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"The Star Wars saga has come a long way since the original releases of the prequels in 1999, 2002, and 2005, and since then technology has rapidly advanced. This re-release of the original prequels is worth every dime. Lucas managed to address problems found in the originals and raised the quality of the movies ten-fold. Episode I in particular was given very nice attention, starting with the added CGI and remastering of old technology that was already in the movie. It looks refreshed and ready for the 21st century, with errors that were addressed in them and fixes that help make enjoying the movie easier. The same can go for episode II and III, with III looking absolutely gorgeous. Overall, if your a fan of star wars, buy the prequel blu rays, as for the original saga, stick to the Theatrical editions :p",1328313600,2,815,4.706293706293707
7170251,1,B00XJ8HAHG,"I won't get into the technical aspects of the movies but rather the watchability of them...
So how does a billionaire (G. Lucas) completely destroy the very foundation that gave him his fortune & put him on the map???? Answer: He makes the most pathetic  and expensive prequels in history. The only reason these movies made any impact was because they were riding the wave of the original StarWars movies made before them....and these movies squashed that wave....completely. Take a lesson George from some lower budget movies that had real heart and soul...like your 1st UN-remastered Star Wars movie!!!
-Prequel #1..... who was his target audience? It was certainly NOT the people who saw the original trilogy in the theaters back in the '70's and '80's. This movie was made for 10 year old kids and it was also the herald of the next two movies to come. Seriously George!.... a nine year old Annikan/Darth Vader that misses his mommy??......Little micro midiclorian things in the blood that give people their ""force"" powers? So much for the mysticism of the ""force"".... Going against what the original statements made about Yoda teaching Obi Wan..but now it is some other jedi that taught him?.....and Ja Ja Binks and his goofy people of exploding marble throwers. And the nine year old Annikan flying the space fighter into an enemy shielded ship, firing inside the ship, exploding the ship by firing inside the ship and thus winning the battle.....when all the OTHER battle tested, experienced pilots just couldn't figure out how to do that too?...yup, thank goodness for the nine year old with force buddies in his blood....he was truly a hero we could all feel for.
-Prequel #2..... one word....WHY?..... why Haden Christian for the lead roll???? The kid has the acting talent of a 3rd rate high school understudy! He was about as convincing in his roll as William Shatner singing ""Rocket Man""...and just as enjoyable to watch.  His character was NOT a growing evil but he WAS a whiny little twerp that needed to be slapped upside the head. And where did you get the name ""DOOKOO"" for the main villan??!! Seriously George, STOP asking ur over fed, over indulged children for advice on how to make your movies!! It didn't work for the first prequel, it didn't work for this one either. This movie still seems like it was made for the kiddies. So much for the heart felt adventure and thrill of your Star Wars movies made in the 70' & 80's.
-Prequel #3.... aaaand again you brought back Hayden Christian even after all the complaints you received about him from, um, THE FANS! You remember the FANS, right George?... you know....the FANS,... the people who you are supposed to care about? The people that made you ...um....famous?...no?.... So now, the movie got a bit better. No more exploding marble throwing, goofy speaking, floppy eared characters.... just Hayden Christian's unconvincing persona & other characters that we the audience care little about. The main saving grace of the movie was Natalie Portman's performance. But, because of you and Hayden Christian's performance.... now and forever more, the toughest, biggest, bad guy of all time in movie land.... Darth Vader, has been reduced to nothing more than a whiny brat with in cape and a helmet.",1325635200,3,3267,4.905967450271247

With the first prequel make people wonder what the hell did they just watch. Then with the second feature just really get in there and give it to them like a swift kick in the crotch! That's how you do it! That's how you mess up Star Wars!

7170253,3,B00XJ8HAHG,"Whereas George Lucas endlessly (but unnecessarily!) tinkers with the Original Trilogy (R2-D2 hiding behind a piece of rock in EP4 for this release for instance: Where did you get behind it, R2, btw?) the new Blu-Ray release would have been such a great opportunity to make some important changes to the Prequel movies to improve them. Considering the already available deleted scenes from the DVD-release EP2 and EP3 even significantly!

For a better movie one has to realize that adding the 100th action scene/frame is redundant as long as the main characterization, motives and feelings are not fully established/fleshed out!

EP1: Changes are almost negligible compared to EP2 and EP3 but IF the first choice should be ""Farewell to Lira"" naming Anakin the kindest boy in the galaxy! But even he could later fall to the dark side (by caring ""too much"" (especially meaningful when you have watched watched all 6 films!) Second might be a longer Tusken Pod race round 2 sequence (with the Javas!) for a better ""merciless"" connection to Anakin's slaughter of EP2.

EP2: THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE! As already stated by many critics and fans alike: Anakin's and Padme's romance has a SERIOUS, in fact HUGE, believability problem especially regading Padme's perspective! (He is yearning, so everything clear in that department!) Therefore it is essential for the whole story and for Anakin's final downfall in EPIII that the love story works and better well! For this it is essential to reinsert the ""extended Naboo arrival"" (where she speaks of having a family herself and her sister having the cutest kids in the whorld!) and the scene at ""Padme's parents house"" (showing the kids, the way both look at each other and of course the conversation in the kitchen). I am not perfectly sure about the Bedroom scene but I think I would add it too as a first sign of slowly ""letting him in"". If there are worries about the length of the film cut out or trim one (or more) of the aforementioned 100 action scenes for compensation!
(I think the other ""romance"" scenes could be edited better as well - maybe there is some more material to choose from!)

EP3: By far not as important as changes in EP2 storywise but nevertheless would deliver additional perspective/insight. In short the whole complex of Bail's office, Padme's appartment and the chancellor's confrontation displays whole new dimensions in the doom of the republic and of course Anakin's: Padme ahgrees a secret loyal comitee (keeping it from Anakin), Jedis cannot be trusted anymore, gouvernors (temporarily?) ruling the sectors(!) and of course Palpatine reacting to ""Petition 2000"" in a harsh authoritarian way and talking with Anakin afterwards. Maybe even add the ""plot to destroy the Jedi"" for extraordinarity of action and seriousness. Again, cut out or trim action scenes like in EP2 in terms of movie length.

All this is without even taking the Blu-Ray deleted scenes into account...but I am sure they give even more options for improvement.
(The biggest issue with EP3 is Anakin's too abrupt final verge to the dark side after killing Mace Windu and rescuing Palpatine! Mybe there is some more footage for a re-edit to make it more fluent and smultaneously more convincing???)

Finally I have to say: The Prequel movies DO have potential! They ought to be better and they can! I pray for the next Blu-Ray release with improved versions to buy them!!!

Come on, George! Please!",1325462400,,3438,4.958333333333333
7170254,5,B00XJ8HAHG,I bought these DVD's for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift and they arrive very quickly. I had plenty of time to wrap them and put them and put them under the tree.,1325203200,,163,3.9696969696969697
7170255,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"For all of you who say that the Prequels are a disappointment and George Lucas has gone too far, listen up! As we all know, George Lucas created ANH, ESB, and ROJ, a trilogy that is one of the best. Let me explain why I think the Prequels are just as good as the originals, maybe better.

The Phantom Menace -- This was the first Star Wars movie I ever saw. Not ANH like a large number of reviewers on the Complete Saga page. I am not a fanboy, I'm just a fan. When I first saw the VHS of PM, I loved it. I watched many times a day, like kids did in the 90s. Yes, I'm a kid from the 90s. I'm now 17, in fact. But that's besides the point. The point is I loved the PM even without watching the originals, something many people may not want to admit to say. Many people dislike PM because of Jar Jar Binks and the disappointment with the umiverse. First of all, Jar Jar Binks does not bother me. Just like the Ewoks in ROTJ, Jar Jar adds comic relief. That's all. That does not make the show unwatchable. It makes it better. This guy is just a wild character who just tags along for the ride. You can't help but smile at his actions. Next, the universe is different from ANH, yes, but it is not bad. Yes, the jedi are small amounts, and yes the Force is biological. But this is still the same star wars fans love. I recommend watching this if you saw the originals first, so you understand what the force is, who Yoda is, and who Anakin becomes. The rest is a good time. There are many scenes in this that I love. The podracing portion of the episode. LOVE IT! Anakin leaving his mother. I CRIED when I saw this at age 7. I would never want to leave my mother...sniff...anyway the best part is the climax. Invasion of Theed Palace, Droid Control Ship Raid, Battle of Naboo, and the Darth Maul fight...All at the same time! You have to love how all four action sequences are fitted together seemlessly. Another good part is that first shot of the galactic senate...I could go on. The point is, this movie makes you wonder...how can it become such a terrible place like in ANH? The answer is in the sequels.

Attack of the Clones -- I do agree that this is the worst of the series. But I shouldn't think that. Because the whole series is one story...I'll get there later. I rewatched this on Bluray yesterday and I liked it even more than before. SPOILER ALERT: Pretty much, an Assassination plot reveals that a clone army has been made for the republic under the order of master syfo-dyas. We then find out that Syfo-Dyas was killed and couldnt've made the order. We hear a brief mention of Tyrannis...but more on that later. Count Dooku, a idealist and the cause of the speration of star systems, apparently provided a droid army for the Trade federation, another sepretist head. Little do we know that Count Dooku and Tyrannis are THE SAME PERSON. I realized this yesterday (yeah, I know...). Sidious and Tyrannis provided both sides for a war that threatens to destroy the republic. I found that fasinating. The story is great, I agree. One major problem is Anakin's teenager actor, Hayden Christenson. I'm not hatin'. I think he provides a good view on Anakin. To Hayden, Anakin should be interpreted as a guy who is quiet, angry, and confused. I think he was a good choice for casting. (Boy who would disgree with that?) Leave your hatemail in the comment section below blah blah blah. Anyway, story and acting aside, the movie is great. The green screen effects are used too much, I gotta say. Though I do like digital yoda. Anyway, the movie is a frontrunner of the series, but the one that doesn't stand up for itself.

Revenge of the Sith -- The best of the prequels, though it shouldn't be. One story blah blah blah later blah blah blah. Anyway. Hayden Christenson, brilliantly played as the darkly confused young man. He is! Really! The visuals are crisp and dark toned. The story is fantastic. The final 45 minutes are stunning. The burning scene...gives me chills...I love that fact that each battle in the prequels gets better and better. From duel-bladed Maul to duel-weilding Anakin to Yoda vs Dooku to four-saber Grevious to Yoda vs Emperor to finally Anakin vs Obi Wan. It is intense. This answers every question and brings the story full circle. Great!

Conclusion: Ok, first off PM is unique. While the OT and AOTC/ROTS are similar, PM is different. It is almost its own category. I love that it is different from the formula.

Anyway, the big climax of this review. All six movies, yes even the PT, are equal in every way. Why? Because it is just one whole story. According to George Lucas himself (in the 2004 edition of ROTS Commentary), he meant for the whole 12 hour story to be ""The Story of Darth Vader"" and it is! From his young beginnings and childlike antics to his teenage mind-poisoning to his redemption, Star Wars is a character study of Darth Vader. It depicts his whole life and how he affected others, the government, and his family. He is a sad figure who was used as a pawn for world domination. It is not some cheesy romp of two guys, a girl, and bunch of plot twists. Or at least, not just that. It is a different galaxy, but its issues are still human. It is beautiful, different, yet very human-run. Darth Vader is a fantastic character. And That's what Star Wars is about. Society in another world surrounding one man, good, and evil. That is why the Prequels are the same as the Originals. Because they tell One Story. And since there are no bad parts to a story (well, you may not like them, that does not make them bad), Star Wars is Perfect. Bravo George Lucas. Bravo.",1325030400,4,5613,4.424564796905223

7170258,3,B00XJ8HAHG,"These movies will never be as good as the classic movies were. That being said, they are still pretty good. Although I would have done a few things differently. The plot is at times confusing. Episode 1 and 2 plots were not explained well at times and sometimes plots changed from the classic trilogy. Episode 3 had the best plot of the prequels. Episode 1's beginning could have been more clear on why the jedi were there in the first place to investigate. Jar Jar binks was pointless and he largely disappears in episode 2 and 3 which begs the question why was he such a prominent character in episode 1. And Qui-Gon and Darth Maul dieing was just a poor way to end the first movie, after all the movie is named about Darth Maul...

 The thing that the movies struggled with was all the random villains that kept appearing and dieing, and I feel that detracted from the plot lines. Darth maul dies. Then in episode 2 count dooku comes in without ever being shown in episode 1. Then jango fett comes in and dies in episode 2. Then count dooku dies in episode 3 and general Grevious comes in, we never saw him in episode 1 or 2 and dies in episode 3. My problem is that the films feel disconnected with each other. In episode 2 I kept wondering who master safadias was... that was never explained well at all. Also in episode 2, Count dooku says that qui-gon was his master. it would have been nice to see qui-gons ghost in the room or something, or at least have qui-gon mention that to obiwan in the previous movie. Also anakins journey to the darkside was not the main part of the movies even though George Lucas said it is. Theres way too much focus on politics and not enough on other important plot lines. Also the death star plans are never elaborated on in episode 2 and are only shown briefly and we never see the emperor even mention the plans in episode 3 yet they are building the death star at the end of the movie... There also wasn't enough focus on anakin and the emperor because of that anakins turn to the darkside in episode 3 feels forced since he just started to interact with him in that episode. Also in the classic trilogy yoda was trainer of obi-wan however in the prequel trilogy count dooku is yodas apprentice...come on George...I love you for creating star wars but come on at least keep your own story lines true to the originals that were made first.

Changes I would make

-explain the trade federations deal with the emperor better in episode 1
-darth maul doesn't die in episode 1
-get rid of Jar-Jar
-Obi-wan doesn't kill Darth Maul in episode 1(I get how he did it, he used his rage and anger to kill him, a dark side tactic, however the average viewer isn't going to get that since it wasn't explained)
- Mention Count Dooku in episode 1
-have qui-gon come back in episode 2 and 3 as a force ghost to talk to anakin and obi-wan
-talk about the death star plans more in episode 2
-flesh out who master safadias was and how he died in episode 2 and explain the deal better regarding the clone army that was set up
- focus more on anakins dark side impulse struggle
- have anakin interact more with palpatine throughout episode 1 and 2 (felt too forced to have anakin be that loyal to him in just episode 3)
-at least mention general grevious in episode 2.
-Darth Maul is the one who kills the children jedi. (doesn't make any sense that anakin kills the children, completely ruined his character because no one wants to like a child killer
-Obi-wan kills darth maul in episode 3 after Darth maul wipes out the jedi temple.
-Obi-wan should find out now that Darth Maul is working for Palpatine
-Obi-wan should be the one to warn the Jedi Council rather than Anakin because then after they go to arrest Palpatine anakin will think the jedi are the bad ones trying to overthrow the republic.
-anakin never finds out that the emperor gave order 66 to kill the jedi and younglings at the jedi temple. (the whole point was that anakin thought the jedi were the ones trying to overthrow the republic; anakin killing the younglings at the jedi temple just didn't make sense)
-anakin doesn't find out the empeor is a sith until the end of the movie, yet anakin stays loyal to the emperor to save padme",1324339200,4,4227,4.40153452685422

7170274,3,B00XJ8HAHG,"The Blu-ray rendition of the prequel trilogy isn't much to look at, to be honest. Most of the series was shot recently enough to where they were able to transfer it over to Blu-ray quality more smoothly, at least more than the original trilogy. Honestly, I might be spoiled by my PS3, which upscales the quality of my original Star Wars DVDs and after watching that, these did nothing for me at all....virtually little to no difference. So if you have an upscaling DVD player, I'd just stick to my original DVDs and make use of that, and save about $100 on the whole series.

They changed a few things in this version, but most of it is not noticeable. Apparently, they tweak Star Wars more with every DVD release, and this one is no different...use Google or go to Wikipedia to see the full list of changes. The most glaring thing is they changed Yoda in Episode 1 from that pig-nosed puppet to the CGI version they used in Episodes 2 and 3, which just made the whole series more consistent...I didn't think it was detrimental at all, as I always wondered why Yoda has a pig nose in Episode 1 but it disappeared for the rest of the series. Every other ""change"" they made on the list was highly unnoticeable by me, and I've watched these films about 10+ times now.

The biggest thing are the specials...but I think most people won't be watching those after the movie is over. If you're looking for the ultimate DVD collection for Star Wars....this isn't it. Don't  know what their plans are for the future, but I doubt this is the last Star Wars DVD release they'll put out, and I wouldn't be shocked to see a Special Edition version somewhere down the line. Either way, unless you're just dying to have these on Blu-ray discs, I think you can skip it, and see what the future holds.",1318377600,,1783,4.446483180428134

I'm a first-generation Star Wars fan since 1977, having seen the original versions of the original three films in the theater one time each as a child, then falling in love with them all over again on VHS in 1987. And I've been a huge fan ever since. The Star Wars Saga is the ultimate epic space opera and film series.

This isn't actually a review of the movies most of you reading this will have seen one or more versions of dozens of times, although this review will discuss some of the changes made to the films.

I actually own the six-film Star Wars Saga blu-ray set linked above, and I reviewed that. The movie discs in this product are 3 of the same discs from the larger Saga set, so I thought I would edit that review down to only discuss the prequel trilogy discs themselves and post it here. This is meant to be an overview with personal observations and select commentary thrown in.

DISC PHYSICAL QUALITIES

The discs themselves are heavy-duty, yet smooth and well-coated with scratch resistance - the best available in retail products I've seen. The discs themselves do not have any images - they are light grey with blue trimmings. The discs have the previously used logos of STAR WARS with the episode subtitle underneath, both on top of the episode number in the form of a large Roman numeral.

THE FILM DISCS

This is as good a place as any to mention that there are two audio commentary tracks for each of the films of blu-ray.  There are the same ones from the previous DVD versions of these films, and then new commentaries compiled from ""archival interviews with cast and crew"".  I don't enjoy listening to commentaries while watching adventure films, but I will force myself to listen to the new tracks once (as I did for the original DVD commentaries).

As I have only had one frame of reference for viewing the blu-ray films, I thought I should first specify what that is, in case my experiences are in any way relative to my equipment and viewing conditions.  This may mean more to you than it does to me.  My blu-ray player is a Sony BDP-S350.  My HD TV is a Sony Bravia KDL-40V4100, a flat-screen LCD with a diagonal of a little over a meter.  My blu-ray player and TV are both almost 3 years old.  My line of vision is exactly 90 to the plane of the TV screen, and my eyes and ears are at a height equal to about 1/3 up from the bottom edge of the screen.  I'm sitting such that the distance of my head to the TV screen is a little more than the width of the Death Star's thermal exhaust port.

The Films on Blu-ray

All three films sound and look awesome in HD! Even Revenge of the Sith, which had the least room for improvement, is substantially better.  All three films sound and look awesome in HD! I fully appreciate all the effort that had to go into improving the resolution of over 6 hours of high-quality sci-fi entertainment, frame-by-frame. Coruscant from space is breathtakingly gorgeous!

There is one significant exception in the HD upgrade.  A very logical and fitting artistic choice was made in the rendering of the holograms of characters.  Throughout the all six movies, it looks like the holograms were not upgraded to HD, now looking somewhat pixilated compared to the surrounding ""reality"" they are projected into.  This of course is easily explained in-universe as they are just not high-resolution transmissions, and I feel this actually works to improve the illusion of the entire scene seeming real.  The holograms are now an intentional vestige of the analogue age, left behind to honor the origin and evolution of the Star Wars films themselves which began as motion picture projections but have now become the ultra-realistic-looking digital media.  A very nice touch.  And the hologram effects also seems more unified between the two trilogies now.)

A significant improvement that the HD upgrade also provides is a solution to a common criticism I have ran into since 1999.  Over the years I have heard many Star Wars fans express that the addition of GC characters and objects into the films seems unrealistic, in not only the updated versions of the classic trilogy but even the prequels.  Ironically, these fans seem to have no trouble accepting the un-reality of rubber muppet characters, but CG is somehow unacceptable in their vision of the Star Wars universe.  Well, now muppets, rubber masks, human actors and CG characters can all exist in visual harmony together, thanks to the wonders of HD.  The increase in resolution seems to have unified the apparent realities of them all.  Now the real-world elements of the scenes have been ""raised"" to the same level of visual reality of the CG elements, resulting in the CG elements seeming to much more naturally blend in with their surroundings.  This adds in a whole new level of visual realism to the films, perhaps being the greatest achievement of these new blu-ray versions of the films.

Now I'll go into more detail about some of the blu-ray enhancements and changes specific to each film.

Episode I: The Phantom Menace

The effect for the Jedi Knights speeding away from the droidekas on the Trade Federation ship has been improved.  The original effects error of the two-headed pod race announcer's hand passing through his vest was fixed.

The big change that even the die hard purists don't seem to mind so much is the complete and utter removal of that awful imitation Yoda muppet.  The TPM muppet bore a vague resemblance to the original muppet from the sequels, but I thought that the TMP muppet could at most pass for Yoda's crazy spice-addicted brother.  I know some fans that feel the CG Yoda model from AotC and RotS was not as good as the original muppet, but even they would agree that the prequel CG model looks a lot more like the original muppet than the TMP muppet did.  And in blu-ray the CG Yoda in all 3 prequels looks more realistic now, so I'm very happy with this change.

Episodes II: Attack of the Clones & Episodes II: Revenge of the Sith

These mostly only had minute editorial tweaks like the exact transition between scenes, moving a couple reaction shots and dialogue lines to a slightly different part of a scene.  The only really somewhat significant change is adding a line of dialogue in AotC where Anakin is having a nightmare about his mother while staying on Naboo.  Shmi Skywalker's voice is now heard pleading for Anakin's help with the echo effect (signifying it is a thought or dream in Anakin's mind).  It does accomplish the addition of a little more urgency to the drama of the film.

FINAL WORDS

You may not agree with all the opinions I expressed here, but if you are reading this then you must be a Star Wars fan of some kind on some level.  If so, then do yourself a favor and watch all six films on blu-ray at least once, even if you have no intention of ever owning them.  You'll see much more than I could possibly ever hope to describe in words.  And if you wish to criticize the blu-ray versions after viewing them, at least you'll then have an educated opinion for doing so.

In my first viewing of Star Wars: The Complete Saga, the rich Star Wars multiverse has deepened in a way I couldn't have even imagined before seeing the films on blu-ray.  While still not perfect, my favorite films have just gotten an incredible amount better.  As impossible as it previously seemed, I'm somehow now even more of a Star Wars fan than I was before.  But this blu-ray release has also reminded me that EVERY version of any Star Wars film is awesome!

If you have any questions, please feel free the ask.  If you have also seen the blu-rays and want to comment on them with respect to my review, please also feel free.  May the Force be with you.",1317859200,260,7937,4.706010137581463

By longest loading, i mean it takes literally MINUTES before the the menu loaded up and i could start the movie. I honestly didn't think the movie was going to start.  Now, once all that loading is done, everything is zippy and chapter searching and what not is fast. I'm curious what others have experienced with the load times.",1316995200,3,634,4.711711711711712

I have been a die-hard fan forever and saw the prequels a dozen times each in theaters and DVDs another hundred.  If Lucas didn't make more changes, I would have happily bought them on Blu-Ray.

7170285,1,B00XJ8HAHG,"No Lucas politics here, just considering the films on their own merits.  And their merits are truly terrible.  These are awful films that, if the Star Wars name was not attached to them, would be forgotten by now, and mocked in the same breath with such movies as ""Norbit"", ""The Cat In The Hat"", ""Catwoman"" and ""Battlefield Earth"".  Gorgeous (and very artificial) visuals do not make a great movie all by themselves, and the original Star Wars trilogy understood this by utilizing special effects to serve the story and the characters.  These 3 movies have it all backwards as story and character take a back seat to the visuals, which while technically dazzling, ultimately leave the viewer emotionally cold and distant.  The narrative is a mess, and the dramatic tension almost non-existent, because we simply don't care about any of these one-dimensional characters and the nonsensical things they do.  The story and character decisions are mostly incomprehensible, and it's only in the third film that some of the mistakes of the first two films start to be rectified - but it's far too little, too late.  The spellbinding fun and gravitas of the original trilogy is completely absent here, and it's like the two trilogies were made by two entirely different filmmakers.  (Actually, that statement may not be far from the figurative truth.)

George Lucas was once a brilliant auteur, but it's clear that he's since lost his touch and no longer knows how to make a great film.  However, if a video game company ever needs  some great visuals to go along with a game project, Lucas might be the guy for the job.  Unfortunately, great video game visuals aren't what I want in my gritty Star Wars movie watching experience.  Ignore the 4 and 5 star reviews, these movies simply suck.",1316217600,16,1783,4.8448844884488445

7170288,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"I love The Phantom Menace. There. My secret's out.

Saying that feels like saying I love Al-Qaeda or I love NAMBLA. On the Internet, hate for George Lucas has surpassed that of Osama Bin-Laden with the recent decision to yet again alter the Star Wars Saga for the upcoming Blu-Ray release. The controversy between the Lucas ""apologists"" and the Star Wars ""purists"" brings to mind Catholic and Protestant, Muslim and Hindu, Scientist and Creationist; the same deep seated convictions stir in the hearts and minds of these two groups of fans. Never mind the global economic crisis, the revolutions taking place throughout the Islamic world, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, this is STAR WARS! That anyone should care so deeply about a movie is unquestionably absurd, but I find myself inexplicably drawn to this controversy. I can't help but feel angry by this hatred for a filmmaker who has given so much imagination to so many. After all, don't these people know that hatred leads to the Dark Side?

For die hard fans, no thinking person over the age of eight can enjoy The Phantom Menace. Not a year goes by that I don't come across a comic or an article taking pot shots at the prequel trilogy. The article doesn't even have to be about Star Wars yet somehow the reference is thrown out, as though we must never forget the lasting psychological wounds of so many raped childhoods. The epic failure of Episodes I, II and III has become legendary and is repeated in the media like a mantra. There is even a ""fan"" film depicting an 80's George Lucas being kidnapped and replaced by an evil clone, as if the ""real"" Lucas could never have made something as terrible as the prequel trilogy. Even suggesting that these movies might not be that bad is to be suffering from Lucas Stockholm Syndrome.

But wait. Something isn't right here. How could a movie, any movie, even one as beloved as Star Wars, spawn such hatred? It's just this kind of zealotry that gets my undies in a bunch. Since leaving the Baptist School where I was hammered with the unerring truth of the Bible for almost a decade, I've spent my life challenging the status-quo, playing Devil's Advocate whenever prudent. For me, there is something inherently dangerous about accepting opinions as fact. The more the critics jump on the Lucas bashing bandwagon, the more I see a lynch mob.

In 1999, before The Phantom Menace hit theaters, I was not a big fan of Star Wars. I had the movies on VHS and I think I watched them once or twice. I owned none of the toys or books or posters, but the trailer for Episode I brought wonderful memories: from Thanksgiving Day, 1980, when I rode on the back of my friend's dirt bike to see The Empire Strikes Back, to the afternoon in 1983 when my sister and I waited in a line that wrapped around the theater for Return of the Jedi. Nostalgia got me excited about Episode I like no movie could; after all, it wasn't just a movie, it was a cultural event. One week before the release, I waited hours with a hundred or so people pining for the lost wonder of childhood. We listened to John Williams' symphony blasted from parked cars and relished talking about things too geeky for everyday society. I was 24 and I still felt young enough to be excited about something as trivial as a movie.

The Phantom Menace made me a kid again. I didn't look for clever dialogue or Oscar worthy performances here. I wanted spaceships and aliens and cool looking planets and awesome light-saber fights and things that went KABOOM! and Lucas delivered it in spades; I wanted all the guilty pleasures that ""mature"" movies couldn't offer or that my adult sensibilities never afforded me. After the film, I remember my brother liking it (not a fan), my friend and I loving it, and my four year old nephew really loving it. A Marine and fellow coworker told me, ""Now I want to be a Jedi"". Even the critics on Rotten Tomatoes gave it a certified 61% Fresh rating. So, at the time, there was no inkling of the hatred the movie would later spawn.

More than a decade later, a YouTube critic would say that Lucas' script for The Phantom Menace was written by an eight year old. But it's precisely that childhood exuberance and unchecked imagination that makes me love George. It's every kid's dream come true: a billion dollars in toys! How can you not enjoy watching him play? In 2005, after the credits rolled on Revenge of the Sith, something changed in me. I knew I had become more cynical, more jaded. Having a mortgage and two kids will do that to you. I knew that I would never again wait with such eager anticipation for a movie; it's one thing to enjoy a film and quite another to count the days on your calendar, wishing time could move faster. Perhaps if I had been a little older in 1999, 34 instead of 24, I might have understood the disappointment.

I have always insisted that the hatred for the prequel trilogy has more to do with aging and less to do with the actual films. Let's be honest here: Star Wars meant more to the people growing up in the 70's and 80's than any other generation. My father, who is 78, never goes to the theater anymore because they don't make good movies like The Sound of Music or Casablanca. I know a guy in his fifties who loves The Day the Earth Stood Still and Forbidden Planet, but never cared for Star Wars. I know teenagers who have never seen, or even care to watch, Star Wars. And I also know kids who adore the prequels. So is it really Lucas that's changed so much, or is it us? Is our hatred for him really a hatred for growing up? No prequel could have delivered the experience of watching the original Star Wars as a child. In the re-release, critics found flaws in the changes, but never the first cut of the films. But if we were to scrutinize every scene in the original with the same harsh treatment as the prequels, we could find much to gripe about. For instance: it never made sense to me how the Death Star suddenly appears at Yavin IV, or why, if it can move, it doesn't just fly around the moon and blow it up. The Empire Strikes Back, heralded as the best in the saga, is also the most flawed: it never seems credible that Luke was Leia's brother all along, Han could never have survived in the vacuum of that giant worm's stomach, and Yoda continuously contradicts himself when he describes the limitless power of the Force. Size matters not, but turning 900 years old, apparently, makes you useless. But in the rosy tint of childhood, the original Star Wars remains flawless. How could any movie compare with such nostalgia? With expectations bordering on religious ecstasy, the prequels were doomed to be hated, just as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. In contrast, casual fans seem to love the prequels, as DVD and Blu-Ray sales have proved time and again.

The Phantom Menace is far from a perfect movie, but then again, I have never seen a perfect movie. I have never accepted the notion that art should be perfect. Should writers and painters and directors think like mathematicians and diamond cutters? Should they be so careful that they never dare throw out their most unorthodox ideas lest people think them inane or offensive? I love The Phantom Menace not despite its flaws but because of them. I love that we become passionate about art, one way or another, that we find ourselves hotly debating changes to a film decades after its inception, on whether it is a crime against art or simply another expression of it; I love that we wonder whether words like YIPEE are cringe-worthy or just a sign of the times; I love that we consider racial stereotyping in an alien species; I love that we debate the physical aspect (midichlorians) of a spiritual belief system (the Force). What other movie comes close to rousing such passions? None. By a long shot.

I remember hearing rumors early in the 90's that the long anticipated prequels would happen, many years passed before I caught my first glimpse of Episode I on a grainy over the air broadcast of Entertainment Tonight. Those next few months were agonizing since I couldn't wait to see the first Star Wars film in 16 years, however there was a question that I feared, what if it sucks?

Well, unfortunately we all know how the prequels turned out and they are a pale imitation of the vastly superior original trilogy (pre-special edition screw ups).

By 1999, Lucas was no longer a filmmaker and was a savvy business man who knows how to make a buck (or a billion) and made the prequels as two hour long commercials to sell more toys that bare the Star Wars name.

The plot was convoluted, the acting was stiff and wooden under his direction, annoying comic relief (I'm looking at you Jar Jar), and the special effects were not that special. Call me old fashioned but the slick look of CGI is jarring and takes me out of the action, give me props, models and costumes!

The movies were marginally better with each release with Episode III the only one I would consider re-watching at this point (not completely void of cringe worthy moments).

GL is not a gifted storyteller or filmmaker or artist.  ""Star Wars"" may have given us that impression back in 1977, but his writing and directing output since then have tipped the scales back in the other direction.

""Star Wars"" was the result of a lot of hard work by a lot of gifted model makers, special effects artists, and countless other people, and not to mention heavily influenced by the Japanese film ""The Hidden Fortress"".  The ""Star Wars"" prequels, on the other hand, were the result of a creatively lazy billionaire enjoying the chance to play with his digital effects toys.  No solid or compelling stories to be told, no intelligent script, and worse - no other creative team members to keep Lucas' questionable judgment in check.

Lucas has become what Elvis Presley used to be -- a rich, isolated man surrounded by sycophantic ""yes men"" who cater to his every whim and applaud his every thought, no matter how pathetically misguided.  At least Elvis had the good sense to pass away before he truly became a walking parody of himself (though he was getting close).

Indiana Jones 4, should have been enough of an indicator to people, that Lucas had truly gone absolutely INSANE... for any hold-outs... these ""sets"", should cement that stance. ___ I liked the Southpark episode regarding this very matter which aired several years ago... I thought it was a little overboard... but now I get it... it was right on the money... which ironically, isn't even how it was meant (as it was meant to be a little over-the-top). Who'd have 'thunk' it... Southpark... telling the future... in accurate detail.

7170303,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"For the Star Wars haters out there, shame on you.

While the Star Wars prequels don't hold up to the original trilogy very well, we should be thankful that we get the chance to see how the Star Wars saga, which began in 1977, actually started out in the first place. The Phantom Menace introduces us all to the characters that will make the difference throughout the rest of the films. We're quickly introduced to Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn, Yoda, Mace Windu, Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine, Anakin Skywalker, Padme Amidala/Skywalker and more important, R2-D2 and C-3PO. Sure, it's not as great as the original Star Wars films, but it does show us their origins.

Attack of the Clones kicks it into high gear by bringing us into the ""Clone Wars"", which was alluded to in ""A New Hope"" and gives us a more educated Anakin Skywalker, a moire wise Obi-Wan Kenobi and the growth of some of the characters we were introduced to during ""The Phantom Menace"". Where TPM was an origini story, ""Attack of the Clones"" takes us right into the action and even introduces us to Jango Fett and the very person who would later become Boba Fett, the notorious bounty hunter seen in ""Empire Strikes Back"".

Revenge of the Sith finally comes along and gives us what we were all waiting for. The transformation of Anakin Skywalker into the notorious bad guy, Darth Vader, and even brings back James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader. We finally get to see the ""volcano"" planet where Obi-Wan and Anakin finally square off. We see the fall of the Old Republic, the rise of the Galactic Empire and the destruction of the Jedi Knight Order. While all dark and gloomy, the saga is finally completed.",1304640000,4,1678,4.68135593220339
7170304,1,B00XJ8HAHG,"There is way to much wrong with each of the prequels to cover here. The bottom line is that these are terrible movies and do everything wrong and fail to even cover movie making and storytelling 101 concepts. Things that first year students are taught on how to tell a story or make a movie are thrown out with these prequels and I have to wonder why, especially since they were made by someone who is a veteran to movie making. George Lucas was fantastic back in the 70s and 80s so what the hell happened? The most likely reason is that he wanted to molest this franchise for all its worth and get as much money out of it as he possibly could. He didn't care about the quality, he sold out for money and that's just a god damn shame. These could have been fantastic movies if he took the time to write the scripts for them and have people around him willing to tell him that his ideas need work. Judging by the making of for each film, it looks like he surrounded himself with parrots and yes-men, absolutely no one willing to tell him that his ideas are terrible and why even though they all knew that George Lucas was making really bad movies.

7170308,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"I think that people have a bad memory. When the original Star Wars came
out, it was not universally loved as some people today believe it was.
Sure, now, 34 years later, you can hardly find someone who doesn't
claim ""Star Wars"" to be a film classic. But when it was first released
in 1977, it was about as loved as Episode I was in 1999 - roughly half
loved it and half hated it. It is interesting that nowadays people will
talk about how amazing the original trilogy of films were and how
terrible the new films are. But people don't seem to remember that they
share most of the same characteristics. Here are some examples of what
I mean:

- I hate to say it, but the writing in the original trilogy is hardly
Oscar-worthy material. The lines were clich-ridden but serviceable to
progressing the story. Same with the new films.

- The movies were geared towards kids. Wookies, Jawas, Hutts, and
comedic robots aren't exactly grown-up fare. We think these films were
more mature than the prequels, but only because they matched our
maturity when we first saw them as children or teens.

- The movies are indeed special effects movies. The only reason the
original films didn't use computer graphics is because CGI wasn't
practical at the time. Had it been, Lucas surely would have utilized it
to its fullest advantage.

- Both trilogies have political underpinnings. These may be more
apparent in the prequels, but are definitely present in the original
movies.

- In the end, they are all just movies, and rather silly ones at that.

Now, I am writing this as someone who loves Star Wars as much as the
next guy. They are my favorite movies. But I acknowledge that they are
just movies and they are not meant to be grand works of art. They are
meant to be a fun, entertaining, effect-filled diversion. And to that
end, all of the movies are successful. Obviously some episodes are
superior to others, but they are each enjoyable in their own way.
Nostalgia is the primary reason that the original films are held in
such high regard. If we really view these films objectively, perhaps
the original films are not as perfect as we remember and the prequels
are not as flawed as we think.",1303430400,14,2186,4.563775510204081
7170309,2,B00XJ8HAHG,"Star Wars 4 to 6 introduced Jedi Knights with powers and intellect not to be reckoned with. The film was serious and even the parts with a bit of humour had a serious edge to it (C3PO and Han Solo). The gravity of the situation was not diminished nor was it a distraction to the overall plot. The impression I had overall after watching the original series was that you do not mess with a Jedi and a sith Lord is the ultimate force of evil, deadly and serious.

Coming to the prequel, a jedi is just someone who can perform fancy tricks. The hint of the overall power of a Jedi given by Yoda in Episode V should have been eloborated in great detail in the phantom menace. Nothing was shown, hence the new generation saw the Jedi as a fancy sword wielder with a bit of mind of matter capabilities and insights here and there as to how. No real introduction to the force and the exceptional discipline and moral standard that was required by the Jedi to manipulate the force was provided and the first episode should have been primarily an emphasis on that (introducing the good and dark side and the overwhelming hope and threat relatively).

The film is a serious one, why try and make it a comedy? It completely destroys the primary focus of the battle between good and evil and the deception that is propagated from the dark side. An entire galaxy is about to enter a realm of slavery and Jaja is cracking jokes while droids are trying to act a comedy sidekick. Even Obi One seems to be joking around more than anything else or atleast have a non caring attitude about everything?

A bounty hunter is able to give A JEDI KNIGHT a hard time in episode 2 and although OBI ONE destroys a sith where even Qui Gon failed, whenever he is involved in a light sabre dual he gets his backside kicked within a few seconds and yet, he defeats Anakin in Part III???? Absolutely ridiculous, he is obviously one of the powerful jedis and hence he survives where almost all die. Anyway, part three was as close to the originals as is possible, the other two makes one feel as though they are simply watching a 3D animation or some movie where there is a lot of special effects without any real purpose to it. Can you imagine. Lord of the Rings with as many attempts at comedy, how much less would the threat of Sauron be? Simirlarly the threat of the Dark Lord or the Dark side is ever so dimished with all the distractions in the film.

SPOLIER BELOW BEWARE:

One of the most ridiculous parts was where Anikan kills the sand people, women and children and the elderly, and when he tells Padmea, she hugs and comforts him? The guy just butchered children and you say, ""there there, its ok sweetie....""",1302825600,8,2688,4.400402414486922

1. Very bad acting (and the movies had good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman, I don't know what happened)  2. Cheesy and annoying characters like Jar Jar Binks, Boss Nass, Battle Droids, etc.
3. Relied too much on CG to tell the story.  4. George Lucas lost his touch as a director long time ago.

Counter arguments that I've heard:
1. About Jar Jar Binks ""It's supposed to have some humor in it""(That's true but these movies weren't funny)
2. About the cheesy and annoying acting. ""It's not supposed to be an academy award movie just have fun with it.""(Sorry, getting a headache from watching these movies isn't fun)
3. Overall stupidity ( Bad plot, bad direction, no sense of purpose, no loveable characters, story telling sucks) ""It's supposed to be for kids"" (I these films were dumbed down for today's kids, that's not a good trend because seem to be getting dumber)",1302134400,13,1187,4.563380281690141

Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones(2002): Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker conduct an investigation after assassins try to kill Senator Amidala. The two stumble upon a conspiracy.

One small detail that didn't dovetail between the 2 series' was that in the prequels, the twins' mother died in childbirth, while in the later series it was claimed by Leia that she remembered her mother some; which would be virtually impossible, for an infant mere minutes old, particularly recalling her character as a mother.

7170346,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"To present the six episodes is of course a challenge. I will not present them one after another in any order (historical or chronological). I will make a few general remarks. First, why did the last three episodes come first? It was necessary for the suspense to remain intense about the only important element which is that Dark Vader is the father of both Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa, both on the side of the rebellion against the Empire. These three episodes were more naturalistic and they did not need the special effects, not possible at the time, necessary for the conception and shooting of all the artificial and very strange creatures of the first three episodes. The happy ending would have been ruined by our knowing the genetic filiation between the two young heroes and the arch-enemy of freedom and democracy. Dark Vader had to be black and dark right to the end for the surprise effect of his fathering the two young heroes to be effective. Then the first three episodes arriving afterwards in time did not have the same function they can have today when we watch the six episodes in chronological order. They created a frame of reference. It is the demonstration that the Republic can only fall because it is totally engulfed in corruption, red tape bureaucracy, the incapability to take a fast decision and to act promptly, the constant waste of time because of political maneuvering. On the other side, that of evil, swift and surprise attacks and violence are the rule. The Republic has been infiltrated to the top and the Force itself embodied in the Jedi order has been drowned in bureaucratic impotence. Then the dark side of the Force can easily convince and capture those who are suffering from that impotence and are frustrated by the refusal to act straight away. It is also necessary to think that those first three episodes that came last needed a technology that was not available before and that is the technical justification of the inverted order, though then the director plays on it and with it. Some of the scenes of these three chronologically anterior films are absolutely breathtaking and only because they use the full array of computerized effects. The race in the first film is amazing, the underwater world is fascinating and the clones and their war against the strange giraffe human species is phenomenal and were not possible without the late 1990s and early 2000s technology. And the battles would never have been that impressive without these special effects. Then we can wonder about the meaning of the whole series back in chronological order. A Republic dies in red tape bureaucracy and corrupted calculation and is taken over from the inside by the main leader who is an infiltrated putsch maker and his military coup is based on the full destruction of the only protection the Republic had, the Jedi order though this one had been made impotent by the red-tape dictatorship of the democratic Republic. The Empire that takes over is based on effectiveness, swiftness and the absence of any waste of time due to useless discussions. To the point of any decision taken by one man. Then you can speak of efficiency. But that Empire that is going to impose an absolute one-person dictatorship is not able to control the grass roots movements and the local dynamisms of all the planets and peoples of this galaxy. That's what the rebellion against this Empire needs to be effective in its turn. Underground rebellion and resistance. Yet they cannot succeed if they do not re-conquer the Force because the Empire is founded on the dark side of that Force and is embodied in the father of the main heroes and leaders of the rebellion. The Force has to be re-learned by Luke Skywalker in order to be able to face his father and defeat the emperor who is manipulating Luke's father. This Force is the only real defense and conquering power of any resistance against any dictatorship. Without a Force of that magnitude no resistance can succeed. But then the meaning changed completely from that of the last three episodes that came first and could appear as a simple metaphor of the rebellion against a dictatorship, hence a metaphor of the defeat and disintegration of the Soviet Union for one. Later on when the first three episodes that came last were available, the meaning was no longer the same because history had changed in the mean time. The meaning then is that any democracy when it forgets it has to be fast and courageous in its decisions that should refuse red tape and bureaucracy will automatically fall in the hands of potential potentates or dictators. That is a common myth and political theme in the USA: the Roman Empire died after two centuries. Unluckily the Roman Empire was not the Republic of Rome and here Lucas is playing with our references. Are the USA a target of that decay of democracy? Yes indeed. That's the message today of this set of six beautiful films with great actors, even the perambulating carpet.

7170348,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"First of all I would just like to say that I love the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy. It all kicks major ass! The plot, the characters, the amazing special effects, it all reminds me of when I first saw A New Hope. The only weird thing was that the bonus feature disc for Episode III has the cover art: The Story of Star Wars, and not episode III. Nothing wrong with that, it still has all the features, it just seems very weir and confusing. Especially when that featurette isn't even featured on the disc! It was a promo at the beginning of the VHS version of Attack of the Clones. (I'm a geek).",1275609600,,607,4.241379310344827
7170349,1,B00XJ8HAHG,"I realize that I am only adding to the countless voices decrying the prequel trilogy. But I wish to address the people who claim that the original (real) trilogy is of similar quality when you stop viewing it through the eyes of a child. I also want to counter the notion that these are just petty gripes from fanboys who would never be satisfied.
Let me answer the first charge: I saw The Phantom Menace when I was 12 years old, and I loved it. I ranked it up there with the rest of the films, being dazzled by the special effects and rewarded by the presence of a few old, familiar faces. But as I got older and read more about classic films and was exposed to GOOD storytelling, I started to realize, ""Wait a minute. None of this makes any sense. The whole plot hinges on trade agreements, negotiations, and voting in the senate? Why do the lizard people in the robes want to invade the planet with the silly name anyway? Why do they keep saying its people are dying without showing any of their suffering? It's just a bunch of flashy images; none of this has any consequence or drama or sense of fun! And won't somebody please shoot Jar Jar?!?!?"" Going back to the original films, I experienced the rewarding satisfaction of an exciting, fun-loving adventure with characters who actually cared about what was happening and were changed by their desperate times, instead of just slogging dully through banal dialogue.
Secondly: I could certainly deal with settings, structures, and characters that were different from Luke, Han, Leia, Vader, the Death Star, etc... if they were in any way interesting. Attack of the Clones, for my money, is even worse, combining a dull, convoluted mystery (that is basically solved in the first ten minutes of the film) with the most jaw-dropping, atrocious, awkward, empty love story ever committed to celluloid. It all ends with the clones fighting the droids, and we have no one to root for, not even the Jedi, who have proven to be remarkably inept for all the powers they were given. Episode III is marginally better, but the nothingness that went before means that this supposedly grand finale has no weight. And still the same mistakes remain! Characters say things that we are meant to blindly accept, even though we have not witnessed the events or actions they speak of. George Lucas fills a blue screen with some magnificent digital vista and then has actors walking around discussing the plot in monotone. Because of the over-emphasis on special effects, even the battle scenes are a chore to sit through because THE AUDIENCE DOESN'T CARE. Why are the Separatists fighting the Republic? Who is this Master Sifo-Dyas and why did he order an army of clones? Why are all of Yoda's lessons from The Empire Strikes Back being contradicted by the Jedi's idiocy? Could Hayden Christensen act any more poorly? I fling my arms in the air and give up.
Stick with the original films, and get some entertainment out of your DVD collection. These new films aren't just a pale imitation of their predecessors; they violate even the most basic laws of good storytelling.",1275350400,40,3104,4.728782287822878

7170365,3,B00XJ8HAHG,"Most of the other reviews have complained about the modifications to the film, so I'll talk about something else: the layout of the menu options. The way it's organized is really cumbersome. The bonus features are organized by movie, then by planet, then by type of feature. Given that the only reason many people bought this set was to see the deleted scenes, it just means having to go through many layers to get to the deleted scenes, then you have to backtrack to see the deleted scenes for EACH planet. I can't imagine who thought organizing the features by planet was a good idea. To make things worse, there's no ""play all"" option for the deleted scenes. Again, a simple, standard option that makes life easier.

Most of the new deleted scenes themselves aren't particularly exciting and it's clear why they were cut. Amongst the prequels, the only one I enjoyed was the ROTS Elevator Antics because it really shows the bond between Obi-Wan and Anakin. I also liked the Anakin-Palpatine relationship in Amending the Constitution. They're mostly animatics anyways, which aren't that editing to watch.

I want to be clear: these movies look gorgeous on blu-ray. However, they didn't look bad on DVD. The main selling feature of this blu-ray was the bonus features and I just think they could have - and should have - had an easier layout. Hopefully future releases will streamline the menu options.

7170375,1,B00XJ8HAHG,"EDIT DEC 2010 - I couldn't wait for ""Episode 1"" to come out, I love the Star Wars universe and really wanted to see the ""foundation"" for the original 3 movies. I was very disappointed with it, and more so with Attack of the Clones. These new movies rely to heavily on CGI and showing off lightsabers than they do on an entertaining story. Most of the characters are hard to relate to, and especially in Phantom menace. Anakin especially, the supposed hero of the prequels, is completely unrelatable, and seems to go out of his way to be unlikable. Not much happens in the way of character development and storyline in the first two prequels, except in the political motives that lead the way to the Empire, they REALLY cover that end of the story. In Phantom Menace they find Anakin, in Clones he falls in love with Padme, thats it. The look of the movies are different from the look of the original 3, everything is new, it doesnt have that used look that the previous ones had, the droids move fluidly, and don't have that feeling that they could be a real machine, like 3po and r2 did in the originals. All the ships constantly change in the movies, as a combination of ships that will appear in the original 3. This was clearly done as an excuse to sell merchandise, because it doesnt seem likely that any military will change their ships so many times in such a short period of time, I guess the empire has a pretty big budget. The heavy use of CGI is what gets me the most, you can tell everything that is done with CGI, so, you loose connection to the characters, because your brain knows its an actor on wires jumping around in some computer animated background or some computer animated guy and completely disconnects you from any emotion towards the character or scenario. I liked Revenge of the Sith as far as storyline goes, that was the movie I wanted to watch, how Anakin became Vader. These movies don't have that original Star Wars feel to them, its just a flashy string of events that happens in a universe related to the one from the original 3.

ORIGINAL POST; These movies are terrible. Yoda looks like a short Shrek with a light saber. They made these movies with 3 actors and everything else is CGI. I was waiting for Woody and Buzz Lightyear to pop out. The story on the first two were completely useless, you could have told that entire story in 1 movie. The 3rd one was slightly better because it actually tells the story everyone wanted to see, how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, and you get to see Darth Vader for 1 whole minute. The first movie you get to see some kid accidentally saving a planet, and in the second a whining teenager rolling in the hills with Padme. These movies established 2 things, Jar-jar sucked, and Anakin is that kid in high school everyone makes fun of.",1255478400,26,2814,4.464077669902912

7170386,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"I really just want to take a few paragraphs to let you know what this product is.

Basically, each of these movies got a 2-disc release when they were released on DVD.  This box set has taken those 2-disc sets, and packaged them into a smaller case so in order to minimize shelf space.  The ""Original Trilogy"" (Episodes 4-6) slimset is a debatable purchase, because it doesn't include the bonus disc that came with an earlier deluxe set.  But this ""Prequel Trilogy"" is a better deal if you're planning to buy these movies.

As for the extras:
*  I love ""The Phantom Menace"" content, especially the 90-minute making-of documentary that shows everything from cast readings to sandstorm carnage to special effects meetings to George Lucas quietly beginning his ""Episode II"" writing.  And say what you will about the quality of the movie, but Fox and LucasFilm did an excellent job of advertising this movie.  Even its promotional extras are worth watching.

*  ""Attack of the Clones"" is another solid batch of extras.  They mostly focus on the special effects, but there are some good interviews and behind-the-scenes stuff with the cast.  Another all-around strong package.

*  I'm slightly disappointed with the ""Revenge of the Sith"" extras.  The main documentary is producer Rick McCallum going through the different departments of the cast & crew.  He even talks about the caterers!  Now, this is a fascinating way to explore the making of a movie, but the problem is most of the content (especially the special effects clips) focuses on the Mustafar sequences.  I would've loved to see more on the opening space battle, not to mention Kyshhykk (sp?) or General Grievious.  The bonus disc is good enough, but a huge stepdown from the other two prequels' material.

So, if you want to buy the ""Prequel Trilogy"", this is the way to go.  Sure, you can probably find some cheaper copies of the original releases, but why bother?

Oh by the way, ""YES!  I LIKE THE PREQUEL TRILOGY.  I PREFER EPISODES 4-6, BUT 1-3 WERE QUITE ENTERTAINING FOR ME.",1252195200,154,2040,4.829479768786127

7170388,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"Well, I promised myself I'd get me these DVDs as a gift when I finished my youtube video about G-rated shock value ([...])and I ended up doing just that.  I actually like these movies better than the original three.  Not for the special effects, but for the tragic hero story of Darth Vader's broken love and his turn to the Dark Side.  Revenge of the Sith is really the only movie you need to see to get an idea of how this turn took place, but the first two films do add a bit more depth as to how it started small and slowly grew until something had to give.

Of course the characters and space monsters are as weird as ever and provide a lot of enjoyment.  It might be a bit tough to enjoy Phantom Menace at first since the vast majority of its characters are so far removed from the Luke Skywalker films.  But Darth Maul is 10 times cooler than Luke Skywalker anyway.

The plots are a bit confusing, especially since a lot of things are talked about but not shown.  We only see bits and fragments of the clone wars, so I'm guessing that's why the animated stuff came about later.  We hear of the people starving on Naboo but don't see anything to give us a sympatheic impression of such horror.

I suppose it wouldn't hurt to give some story spoilers since everyone's seen these darn movies, but eh, I only wanted to talk about Boba Fett and the storm troopers anyway.  Not much to say, so I guess I'll be good this time.",1252108800,,1426,4.2444444444444445

7170390,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"I recently viewed all 6 Star Wars movies and something occurred to me: they all share the same flaws; namely uneven acting and dialogue. So I can't really understand how these prequels are worse than the originals. They share the same strong points (special effects, action sequences, impressive visuals) and they share the same flaws (goofy dialogue, uneven acting). Then again, I am not a Star Wars maniac, so maybe there is something subtle I am missing. Anyway, if you want visually impressive space opera, check these movies out. Just be warned that some of the dialogue is borderline moronic. Ian McDiarmid's performance as the main villain is fun to watch.

7170391,3,B00XJ8HAHG,"No one needs any more reviews on the movies themselves. They're a legacy known to both young and old. My chief gripe with George Lucas is that he's slow to move, and it took forever for these films to become available in DVD. Now it's taking forever to come out in Blu-Ray.

The DVD collection is wonderful, but the aspect ratios are different. I don't have a large horizontal monitor, so I'm doomed to watch these DVDs on a thin, video strip that I can barely see. Even on my computer, which does have a large horizontal monitor, I still get a tiny strip because of the horrible ratio; but some movies have different ratios than others.

I'd buy all these movies in a reasonable ratio, but they're aggravating to watch on every monitor I've seen them on. The worst ration is 16:9. If you're going to watch it on a television set, be prepared to sit down two feet from the screen if you want to see what's going on. I'm afraid Lucas is going to release all of his films in different ratios when he finally gives the thumbs up on Blu-Ray, and that would be a shame. He's going to have to die before they'll release these movies the way the fans would prefer them, and I may be dead long before then!

The real star wars films released in 1977, 1980 and 1983 were released in 2006 as bonus discs in non anamorphic dumped from laserdisc masters from 1993, without the theatrical audio and with the limits of the resolution of laserdisc and not even dvd quality.  Without the strong suit of the laserdiscs which was the full bitrate LPCM tracks.

7170411,4,B00XJ8HAHG,"Although everyone can comprehend the idea of a ""prequel,"" it becomes confusing when talking the first or second set: ""...do you mean the earlier story, or the earlier release?...""

Which of the two box sets is preferred, will probably depend on how old you are. I saw the original ""Episode IV,"" if you will, in the theater in the 1970's and liked it. I saw the subsequent installments as they came out in the empty, early '80s, and thought they were very good movies, especially given they were out at a time when there weren't very many films of this type playing. With this in mind, the ""prequel"" series is a stark contrast to the earlier release. In ultra high resolution, with digital technology sharp enough to make the old TV I use seem like a Hi-Def state-of-the-art piece of brand new technology, real life now looks bland and blurry by comparison. But it seems, no matter how good the technology, CGI simply isn't convincing. It doesn't look real. But, you may say, this is a fantasy story, it isn't real anyway, why does it matter? It does, because the whole idea was based on the precept that real people interacted with all these creatures, in what looked like a real world, even if this world is ""...in a galaxy far, far away."". But here, I often feel I am watching a video game. On-set camera work often dissolves into obvious animation, throwing a wrench into the flow of the experience. And good as it looks, it's just missing something. But things like Yoda's facial expressions are the the benefits of it.

Don't get me wrong. It's a good piece of work, with a whole lot of effort used to make it what it is. This is undeniable. Just incongruous.

The story itself is that of one Anikan Skywalker, known as ""Ani"" to his friends. Imagine a boy his friends and foes call, phonetically, ""Annie.""  But when I see him I think of ""Seven"" Bundy, the ill-fated ""Married...With Children"" character. With much effort, I pushed my bias aside, and followed his journey, from a likable little kid, child prodigy, if you will, to his ultimate transformation into the villain we all now know as Darth Vader. Don'tcha hate when people call him ""Dark Vader?"" As the story goes on, it becomes more intense, as he becomes more and more self-absorbed and evil, climaxing with a high-speed sword fight with Obi-Wan, resulting in (I can NEVER process this kind of thing) his complete dismemberment. Even in a fictional story, I just can't wrap the brain around this. It's the one thing that simply freaks me out, every time. He is dismembered and burned beyond recognition, where upon he is rebuilt in a ""Six Million Dollar Man"" fashion and fitted with his helmet, black suit, and breathing device.

And the stage is now set for the second half of the story, the three older movies to begin.

As an aside, I thought the whole Jar Jar Binx thing was an insult to my intelligence. He was obviously scripted as an inept, silly character, plainly used for comic relief, but all attempts at humor fall flat. My dislike for him is based only on how stupid the whole thing was. And remember all the black activist groups making a stink about him portraying black people unfavorably? Hey Dee-Doo! He isn't even human. You assigned your own insecurities to a fictional being from another galaxy, and professed offense at it! I remember this, clearly, and it surprised me that George Lucas wasn't sued by ""Reverend"" Al Sharpton, or ""Reverend"" Jesse Jackson. But since he threw political correctness to the four winds, I have to respect him, despite this Jar Jar cretin.

But it is a pretty good ""escape"" movie, worth watching...in my opinion.",1239926400,3,3628,4.668231611893583

7170413,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"A lot of people complain about the prequel trilogy, but quite honestly I can't see where they're coming from. The actors chosen nailed their roles perfectly (especially Liam Neeson, who automatically makes anything awesome), camera work and action shots are superbly done and the special effects are exactly what one would expect from Industrial Light & Magic.

Story-wise, we get to see the fall of the Old Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire due to the machinations of an evil Sith Lord. Equally as important, we see the Clone Wars and the destruction of the Jedi Order, including the fall Anakin Skywalker and his transformation into Darth Vader.

In short, this is the perfect way to see the backstory behind the original trilogy (which I recommend buying along with this set; you get both trilogies, each movie with a bonus disc packed with features, in thinpack box sets for the price of a single trilogy on retail shelves). In my honest opinion, there is no greater science fiction saga ever told than Star Wars, and now the entire story can be viewed, if you so choose to, within a single sitting.

My review for the movies:

Episode 1 - On top of the terrible CGI and the cardboard characters, the movie is about as slow as paint drying and takes forever to get to the action. People liked it when it first came out just to see a lightsaber battle, but since then, people have woken up. Jar Jar Binks may very well be the worst character in the series. 2.5/5 Stars

Episode 2 - Yet another movie that works about as slow as a turtle. While the epic battle at the end was worth the wait, the movie as a whole doesn't work. The romance subplot doesn't give in due to lame script writing, and several sub-plots wern't interesting at all. The only good thing is that the CGI has improved since Episode 1. 2/5 Stars

Episode 3 - Finaly we have a movie worthy of the name Star Wars. While this movie DOES rely on tons of eye candy and special effects, at least we have a movie that moves on to the action quicker and leaves the pointless sub-plots aside. The movie also provided some decent character development even though the script was (again) lacking. 3.5/5 Stars

So to sum up the entire Prequel trilogy, I'd have to say that only 2 of the movies are worth your time, but only 1 is worth watching more than once. What does that really say about the trilogy?

To make a long story short, stick to the original trilogy (which is Epsiode 4, 5, and 6 in case you didn't know). Don't let the prequels waste away your time.",1235865600,4,1695,4.2

About a rush to market, snatching up media related to STAR WARS as soon as it hits the shelf.  If you don't like the movies themselves or the packaging or the recording quality that is one thing. Whining about your own gullibility is quite another.  Let me clue you in.  If Lucas makes or includes special features, enhancements and the like ...  he will not fail to promote that. Investigate the product before you buy.  And to those of you who didn't even buy any products but are just looking for places to gripe, this is not the appropriate place.

I would think most everyone would want ""IV, V, and VI"", and it makes sense that they are available as their own individual release, because there are alot of people who didn't care for the later ""I, II, and III"" prequels.  I bought the complete set because I'm rather a completist.  Besides, I kinda think that Episode III: ""The Revenge of the Sith"" is an important introduction to the rise of Darth Vader.

What's more, even though Episodes: I, II, and III were the newest films, I think the earlier three (Episodes: IV, V, and VI) look better on film because they don't have all that pasty look of computer graphics.  Compare Jabba The Hut on ""The Phantom Menace"" and look at him (it) again on ""The Return of the Jedi.""  In ""The Return of the Jedi"", Jabba the Hut looks more realistic.  And especially look at Yoda (done in CGI) in ""Attack of the Clones"" and compare him to the skilled puppeteers and make-up of Yoda in ""The Empire Strikes Back.""  Yoda looks better as an actor with make-up than he does as pasty looking CGI.

So anyway, again I ask: ""Who would bother to buy just the prequel?""  Would they rather buy the two separate 3 disc sets and pay more than what you would get with the 9 disc Complete Saga?",1226275200,2,1326,4.39344262295082
7170436,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"Finally they released a box set for the Prequel Trilogy! I had not purchased the Episodes I, II and III because I felt that if they released a box set for IV, V and VI, they had to do it with the first ones as well.

Well, the wait was worth it, finally they released a box set for the new movies. Good  quality of the video and the boxes are awesome.

Buy these if you are a SW fan!!!",1226016000,10,385,3.7875
7170437,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"This is exactly what I've been waiting for: a low-priced collection of the ""first"" three Star Wars movies for my modest DVD collection.  I actually caught a deal yesterday that allowed me to buy both collections (the Trilogy and the Prequel Trilogy) for $34.99 combined, so this set will work great.  The Trilogy will replace my old VHS set, and now I'll finally have the Prequel Trilogy.  Yes, I hated Jar-Jar, and these movies aren't my favorite ever made; however, it'll give some closure to my OCD-driven need to complete a movie series.  In that respect, this release is perfect for me.

Why all the hate from the Star Wars geeks?  As you've relentlessly pointed out, these are the same movies that Lucas has been releasing for the last few centuries; why does one more offend you so?  It's targeted to me, not you.  This particular packaging works great for folks like me who just want the basic collection at an affordable cost.

Just wait a few more months for the ""Super Jedi Apprentice Textbook Remastered Restored Empire Standard Version"" (which will undoubtedly be on Blu-Ray).  Then you can have the movies you so love to hate in all their mediocre glory.

--------------------

EDIT: After watching all 6 episodes all the way through, I realized that Lucas actually changed the very end of ""Return of the Jedi"" to include Hayden Christensen as the ghostly Anakin Skywalker standing with Obi Wan and Yoda, as opposed to the unfamiliar actor in the original film.  While I personally think this ties the films together and makes for a better ending, I'm sure a lot of hard core fans will suffer strokes when they see it.

Oh, and they inserted a couple of other scenes at this point, too.  While the Ewoks are celebrating with fireworks on Endor, random locations throughout the now-leaderless ""Empire"" are shown celebrating, as well; this includes a brief shot of Naboo, where you can hear the oh-so-loved voice of Jar Jar Binks shouting for joy (""Weesa FREE!"", I think).  Yeah, I could have lived without that, too.

I have to say that going from ""Revenge of the Sith"" (Episode 3) to ""A New Hope"" (Episode 4) was a jarring transition.  We're supposed to believe that the timeline has now jumped around 20 years into the future, yet the in-story technology and the film's special effects have taken a giant leap back in time.  It actually made me wish (HERESY ALERT!) that Lucas would remake the older films altogether.  Imagine what those films could be like with today's effects and more realistic acting.  Oh, well.  I guess I'll just have to make do with ""Revenge of the Sith,"" by far the best of the series.",1225843200,15,2625,4.723076923076923

Clearly re-releasing the original Star Wars Trilogy & Prequel Trilogy is to coincide with the new upcoming Clone Wars DVD & the usual holiday season. Most likely there WILL be some sort of collector's ultimate set in the horizon for DVD & Blue Ray of the entire Star Wars saga. Buy this set again? Only if you didn't have it before because there is absolutely nothing new other than the carboard packaging & slim-line cases. Wait for the new set that will obviously come in the future? Maybe?

Five stars for the original trilogy & two stars for the prequel trilogy. Average 3.5 stars for both of them. Here's a Star Wars DVD history re-cap that I have experienced;

10-16-01
STAR WARS DVD EPISODE 1
Great! First time Star Wars is on DVD even though it's the crappy Episode One with Jar Jar. I'll buy it! Bought my first DVD player too!

11-12-02
STAR WARS DVD EPSIODE 2
It was OK & better than Episode One even though flying Yoda is jumping & flying with a light saber like some sort of Nintendo video game character. I'll buy it!

9-21-04
ORIGINAL STAR WARS SPECIAL EDITION TRILOGY DVD SETS WITH BONUS DISC
Woo Hoo! I'll buy it & ditch my Original Trilogy VHS.

11-1-05
STAR WARS DVD EPISODE 3
Yes! The Saga is now complete! Best episode of the prequel trilogy. I'll buy it!

ORIGINAL STAR WARS TRILOGY DVD SET WITHOUT BONUS DISC
Huh? I'll pass!

7170440,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"Believe it or not I still own the VHS boxed special edition (now up for sale)I  jest knew that eventually Lucas would remaster on BD, Star Wars and now Indiana Jones. All I can say is WOW, can't wait.",1222905600,3,200,4.128205128205129
7170441,2,B00XJ8HAHG,Just not a very good effort from Lucas.  I'm not sure why anyone would watch one of these three films over one of the old three films.,1222819200,6,134,3.962962962962963
7170442,3,B00XJ8HAHG,"I just got done watching the prequel trilogy. Anyone who says Revenge of the Sith is the best of all the Star Wars movies, or at least the best of the prequels is sadly delusional. In fact it's downright painful. Even The Phantom Menace with all its flaws was much more entertaining with better acting, better script, and better story than Sith. But after giving all three of the films a fair an honest viewing I can most assuredly say that Attack Of The Clones is truly the best of the prequel films. Not only is it the best of these three, which would not be saying much, because then one can misconstrue it's only the best of a bad lot. No, Attack of the Clones is a damn good movie that stands on its own.",1222646400,,709,4.220588235294118
7170443,1,B00XJ8HAHG,"I have waited for years for this collection to be released, and I am totally disappointed by the fact that the only thing new in this collection is the box to hold the three discs...  How about adding the deleted scenes to the original movies and create something new for the fans to enjoy, Mr. Lucas?  With the practically new Episode 4 you produced, I don't think this would be too much for your fans to take!",1221264000,18,411,4.324675324675325
7170444,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"I really love the whole Trilogy! Releasing it once again on SD DVD and not Blu-Ray DVD doesn't make very good marketing since. Considering Indiana Jones-The Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls is being released on Blu-Ray in October. I realize Mr. Lucas doesn't think we need another new disc format however considering it is now the winner of the ""format war"" I'd say it's safe to say it's here to stay. I watched this ever since the creation of the Blu-Ray Assc. group and I did believe it was gonna win. As cool as it would be for everyone on the planet to just click it and download everything you could ever want. I'm all for new Tech. but realisticly not everyone has a pc and internet so I really don't see that happing for some many years! Well here's to being hopefull.",1220659200,3,772,4.405594405594406
7170445,5,B00XJ8HAHG,its about time that came out with the prequel trilogy it sould of take 2 years ago. but i still buy the buy box set. some people don't khow good movies. i was only 8 when i seen the 3 movies.,1220400000,2,191,3.682926829268293
7170446,2,B00XJ8HAHG,"If you've already purchased any of the movies in this set, you could sell them to buy this set, but why? This set isn't quite as pointless as the ""Original Trilogy"" companion set (which marks the third virtually identical content box set of the Star Wars Special Edition trilogy in the last four years), because the Prequels were previously only available separately.

The trouble is that these are just not good films compared to the originals. Unlike ""Star Wars"" ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" which flow together fairly well... Episode I just feels pointless now, with its slow, meandering plot involving taxes, silly droids and doofus politicos, the slapstick Roger Rabbit clone Jar Jar Binks, and an overly long Pod Racing sequence stolen from Hanna Barbara. Episode II begins to finally heat things up towards the third act, and Episode III is passably decent (at its best approaching the quality of Return of the Jedi). However, as a trilogy, this set simply leaves a lot to be desired.
The casual fan would be better served purchasing Episode III, and renting I and II just to see what Lucas was into before he finally went back to the ""real backstory"" he'd written for the Original Trilogy in the late 70's and early 80's. Despite it's flaws (some truly atrocious acting and rushed wrap up with many loose ends still unaddressed), Episode III is the best of the lot. Many fans have wondered what it would be like to ""watch them all in numerical order."" Trust me, I've tried it, and it's not as fun as it might sound. Episode I and the first half to 2/3rds of Episode II simply drag, making it seem like an eternity before we start to get to ""the good parts.""

The best thing about the Prequels is that it reminds us that there are three far better movies that were made between 1977 and 1983 which inspired them.

As for these new box sets... how many times can Lucas re-release the same movies on DVD?

The Original Trilogy might be worth buying for a beginner, but that's about it. The new Special Editions still have messed up colors, and will ruin the nostalgia for long-time fans with the CGI and nonsense.

See the ""So you'd like to..."" list entitled: ""own the Star Wars movies on DVD and not double dip"" for details...

Both the Star Wars Trilogy and Prequel Trilogy box sets are simply all the previously released official DVD sets (the Prequels from '01, '02, and '05; and the Original Trilogy Limited Edition sets from '06) packed into cardboard. You won't be getting the 2004 ""Bonus Materials"" disc that came with the first (4 disc) 2004 box set (thankfully you can order that separately on amazon for cheap).

As there is no new content on either of these sets, it's pointless except for people who want all the movies and don't have them yet.

But for the price, you can own them for a few dollars less separately. If you think it's worth a few extra bucks for cardboard, please feel free to make George a little richer...

PS: Since my review has apparently angered some... the main reasons for the low rating are primarily because I feel that two out of the three movies are relatively poor, and as a trilogy, they don't work very well together, and because this set is simply a rehash of previous releases. First time fans are better off renting Episode III if they really want to see the best the Prequels have to offer. For everyone else, the Original Trilogy is far superior.",1219881600,24,3419,4.600985221674877
7170447,5,B00XJ8HAHG,"For all the flaws that the Prequels may have, they're still highly enjoyable films, with just as many memorable scenes and quotes as the Original Trilogy.  I think it's great that they're keeping the movies out there for any new generation to purchase (not that DVDs are that hard to come by of course), and really it's nice to have a convenient box set.  So it's a good deal, if, you don't have the movies already.  Otherwise, it's just another stepping stone in the journey towards the much wanted ""Ultimate"" box set with all six films.
