8338321,5,6302968151,"I have read many of the reviews of this movie and I am perplexed at the number of negative reviews. I was hooked after the first viewing. For a low budget film, the message is extraordinary. An uplifting story about two women who against all odds find love with each other. As someone who has been through a similar situation, I was truly touched. I watch it every chance I get. If you want a beautiful story of a growing relationship, then this is the film for you...but for those of you that just watch movies like this for the ""porn value"" then you are out of luck. (I think that was the problem with some of the other reviewers). Anyway, this continues to be one of my most favorite films ever. Kristen, Texas",1020038400,9,713,4.3283582089552235
8338322,5,6302968151,"I have seen the making, but they have let us see to many from Trisha and to little from Karen. I think thats because Nicole was in love with Trisha.",1002240000,,148,3.966666666666667
8338323,1,6302968151,"In the morning, in the evening, angst we got fun? I have to say, I was unable to tear myself away from this movie, mainly because I couldn't believe it could continue to move at such an agonizingly slow pace. I was afraid if I ran to the fridge, something interesting might actually have happened while I was gone, and I would have missed it. Having been in the ""scene"" for some time now, I am not enamored of the ""Oh my God, am I gay or not, I'm so confused"" personality. Been with them, done with them.
Trisha Todd gave a very believable performance of this type of torn individual. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast's screen time could have been cut - dramatically. I could never really understand what the ""hostess"" was trying to achieve. The living room chats were so vague as to be annoying, but I got the distinct impression that the entire purpose of the ""workshop"" was to convert the homophobic straight women, and get the two leads together. I don't recall a lot of discussion about writing. The endless, banal dialog of the group sessions dragged like a car without wheels. I kept saying to the 'actors,' Hellooo...you have an audience out here! Please try to communicate with us! I was starting to root for the male love interest. ""Claire, run for your life or you'll be stuck in this psuedo-philosophical babble world for what will seem like an eternity!""
The bottom line is that this film was the victim of a done to death story line, with not much else (read: anything) going on to give it a unique perspective. The fantasy love scenes were sensual, and the two actresses flowed together during these moments. They had much better chemistry in bed than out. But I was so worn out by the preceding, and continuing, angst, I couldn't ""be there"" with them, because they weren't really there either! Heavens, it was all so exhausting. I suppose a character study could be done on the rest of the cast while waiting for any credible interaction between the leads, but why? There wasn't enough depth to study.
Fair attempt at a first time lesbian identity crisis film, but not enough diminsion or definition of the main characters above the obvious. The dialog and the direction were just a notch below basic beginner. I'd watch it again, but only because of Trisha. And I'd probably fast forward to the end. --This text refers to the VHS Tape edition.",1001808000,4,2363,4.601895734597156
