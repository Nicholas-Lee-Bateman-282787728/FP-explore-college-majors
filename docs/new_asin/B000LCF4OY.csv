Before buying the product...I want you to consider a few things. First, be aware that he has a throat like symptom that I am not completely sure how he could talk...Anyway if that is a bother...I would save the $70 dollars because its on both DVDs.

Also, keep in mind that this is similar to the work on his book on Acting. He has very insightful information about the craft...however it is not for everyone. Please make sure that its not STRASBERG or STANISLAVSKY...it is MEISNER.

Would recommend this to anyone wanting to further educate themselves on the craft of acting.

Thank you.",1285459200,5,609,4.726415094339623
2705356,5,B000LCF4OY,"We must be grateful to Sydney Pollack who had the good sense to film Meisner's class for prosperity.

This DVD does more justice to the greatness of Meinser than all the Meisner books put together.

Pollack, who passed away recently, should be happy to join Meisner in the Artists' heaven.",1213142400,4,289,4.76
2705357,5,B000LCF4OY,"FULL DISCLOSURE:

28 years ago, I was one of the young student actors asked to participate in this documentary. And, to provide some idea about how important I think this program is, most of ""my"" work in this documentary is almost all total failure; and frankly this embarrasses me.

That said:

Until now, I had been very proud of my participation in the documentary about Sanford Meisner, ""The Theater's Best Kept Secret."" However, with this program, I've just learned: the secret is out!

""The Sanford Meisner Master Class,"" is astounding in its power to not only convey Mr. Meisner's genius for teaching the craft of acting, but as a student participant in this Master Class it is like witnessing the re-incarnation of a most important figure in my life, and of the 20th Century. It is like the great Sanford Meisner has come back to life, and with his teaching powers fully intact.

Though it has been years since I left the acting profession, and a few years since I also stopped teaching The Meisner Technique, Mr. Meisner's influence on all of my adult work has been profound. His most important influence on me, which this documentary expresses so eloquently, is perhaps Mr. Meisner's most precious gift: his uncompromising devotion to helping students develop their own ""sense of truth."" This 8 hour documentary shows how Mr. Meisner shared his gift of such a highly developed ""sense of truth"" as a standard for his students to strive toward attaining.  He is the perfect model and embodiment of ""a sense of truth.""

""A sense of truth,"" that in the art of theater plays out from present moment-to-unanticipated-moment, between human beings, under the imaginary circumstances of a writer's work. And thus, provides humankind with a model for authentic, meaningful, and truthful human relationship.

Did I say, that Mr. Meisner's great contribution that exists in every frame  of this 8 hour documentary is the cultivation and great value for a ""sense of truth?""

:)

If you care about any of these things: the model of a magnificent teacher; the great value of learning by trial and error; creating an environment where students feel freedom to fail while striving to achieve excellence measured by the highest artistic standards; theater; the craft of acting; a ""sense of truth""; seeing genius at work; a model for authentic human relationship, you will enjoy this program immensely and learn a great deal.

In a world so consumed with the artificial, it is no wonder that the legacy of this most genuine of teachers and his approach to art endures so. Right now, as I view it, this program serves as a potent reality check for me.

""Sanford Meisner Master Class"" is a great credit to the vision of Mr. Kent Paul, Mr. Jimmy Carville, and the people at Open Road Films for creating, preserving and sharing this extraordinary work with the world.

If you've ever wondered what all the ""brouhaha"" is about ""The Meisner Technique""  . . . behold. This is like watching Piccaso paint.

2705358,5,B000LCF4OY,"Sandford Meisner was the quintessential actor's actor. He lived what he taught. Personally, as a Meisner student I have dreamed of being able to study with the ""man"". My dreams were realized with this video release. It was shot during a master class over a period of months by one of Sanford Meisner's former students, Sydney Pollock. This archive of Meisner was created as a way of preserving who Sandy Meisner was so that the rest of the world could understand and appreciate him for the genius that he was. There is atleast one of Sandy Meisner's students that many may recognize. Of course, I'm speaking of Matt McCoy. He has had some success in film and television, albeit modest. Anyway, if you are a Meisner student, or aspire to be an actor then, by all means buy this video. It is eight hours of pure Meisner at his best. You will develop a greater appreciation for the man responsible for ""living truthfully on stage"" and in life.",1169424000,6,940,4.601190476190476

My Advice: Go buy it right now.

""Acting is the ability to live truthfully under the given imaginary circumstances."" - Sanford Meisner

The name Sanford Meisner has become iconic in the world of Acting. He co-founded the Group Theatre in 1931 along with other theatrical heavyweights as Stella Adler and Lee Strasberg. The Group Theatre was established, in part, to bring the teachings of Stanislavsky's ""Method"" of Acting Training to America. Not long after the Group was founded, Meisner branched off and began work on his own acting technique and history was made. His list of celebrity alumni reads like a Who's Who of Hollywood. Thankfully, in 1980, a group of his alumni got together to record his teachings for posterity. They simply could not allow Mr. Meisner to pass away without capturing his method and teaching style on video.

This DVD represents the first time this video recording has been made available to the general public. It consists of nearly 8 hours of training with Meisner and a small group of students in one of his classes across two DVDs and it is nothing short of magic. The viewer should be aware however, that the audio and video quality is not up to today's standards. To make matters worse, Mr. Meisner himself is shown here after having gone through three surgeries to circumvent cancer and after having to re-teach himself how to speak. The beauty of this is that he becomes a living representation of one of his own maxims: ""An ounce of behavior is worth a pound of words."" Still, without the provided subtitles, he would be nearly unintelligible on this recording. Adapting your ears to Mr. Meisner does not take long and you quickly understand that it's well worth the effort. In order to facilitate this training for the viewer, the original recording of 1980 contains commentary with Martin Barter (Artistic Director of the Meisner Center and acting instructor). Anywhere its needed, Mr. Barter interjects his comments and explanations of Mr. Meisner's theories and exercises. This commentary is invaluable.

There are no ""special features"" on this two disc set. Normally, that would be a huge sticking point for me. I'm a sucker for good bonus material on DVDs. However, on this set, not one ounce of the space of the DVDs is wasted. The primary content is all that matters in this set. The mere fact that these lessons have been captured are paramount to any other material that could have been added. Really, what bonus material would be worthy of this DVD? Interviews with some of his alumni would be pointless (and just cost money) because the video of the training literally speaks for itself. Any other information about the Sanford Meisner Center can be found by visiting the website which is listed on the outside of the DVD case. All it takes is a bit of effort to type the address into your web browser. They didn't even waste time providing you with a scene access menu. There is one item on the main menu page of each disc and that's to start the video. You do have the ability to track through the chapters of the disc, which is good given that most people probably won't have time to sit down and watch all 8 hours (or even in two 4 hour chunks) at once!

Anyone pursuing acting training should own this DVD and watch it often. The DVD will never replace acting training in a studio with an instructor and scene partners, but by observing, a serious actor will be able to see these ""traps"" that are always lurking in their path towards mastery of their craft. After all, one can not overcome those traps without first being aware of them.",1166140800,16,3600,4.717011128775835

8161434,5,B000LCF4OY,"Truth be told, I haven't watched the DVDs.  I only watched the trailer from the MeisnerDVD.com website.  The trailer was absolutely breath-taking!  I have a good guy friend who happens to be an aspiring actor.  He's struggling to make it to the top in Hollywood and has not gotten very much formal acting training due to his low funds.  He has done some reading on techniques and has participated in a few small scale productions.  Anyway, he happened to have a BIRTHDAY!  So, I decided to make an investment in his future by purchasing him this AMAZING, MOTIVATIONAL, and INSPIRATIONAL DVD as a surprise gift!  He absolutely LOVED it!

Long story short, this DVD is DEFINITELY a keep-sake and a MUST have for ALL aspiring and CURRENT actors!  Sanford Meisner is a LEGENDARY acting instructor and has trained many greats, such as Sandra Bullock, Sydney Pollack (who happens to be the director of this ""Master Class DVD Set""), Manou Topou, Jon Voight (Angelina Jolie's father!), Robert Duvall, Gregory Peck, Diane Keaton, and the list of greats goes on!

My guy friend has watched this DVD set over and over!  And it has been making a GREAT reference/resource tool to refine his acting craft!  While an actor can invest money in a class, there's nothing like having a DVD of a legendary class to watch over and over again for a fraction of the cost!  This DVD set is the ONLY footage of Sanford Meisner teaching his techniques that is made available to the public!  The rest of the footage is archived and placed in his estate, NOT available to the public!  What better gift to get a struggling actor?  I am pleased with this purchase!  And so is my guy friend!",1310947200,3,1660,4.646048109965636
8161435,1,B000LCF4OY,"What genius destroys his instrument not just once but three times?  As brilliant as this teacher may have been, he was not ""true to his own voice.""  Before considering the purchase of this DVD, customers should know that Meisner has to ""burp"" his words since he has literally destroyed his throat through a lifetime of smoking and from several operations for throat cancer. Thus he sounds like a frog throughout, and only the most dedicated will be able to sit through the croaking.  Definitely not for younger audiences.  Despite the tragedy, he and many of his students continue to smoke heavily throughout the program.  If it had been recorder when he could speak normally, it probably would have been a treasure, but at least for me, it was unbearable to watch and ruined the lessons which might at one time have been worth learning.",1309392000,9,837,4.784722222222222
8161436,5,B000LCF4OY,"This is exactly what it claims to be. You being able to sit in on an acting class from one of the best renown acting teachers of all time. Regardless of how you feel about Meisner's technique (which I should point out does wonders for some actors,) being able to actually see him teach will make you rethink your acting and make you appreciate his keen insights more than any book you'd ever read on or even from him. Some may complain that it is difficult to understand because of Mr. Meisner's speaking difficulties, however, I found I had very little trouble particularly considering that he is subtitled. My only complaint, which is minor, is that because I was not familiar with certain scenes and was not given any information of what happened between shots of the video, it was, at times, difficult to understand why the students of the class and Meisner made some of the choices for playing the scene that they did. Again, overall this was a very minor hindrance in regard to being engaged and edified by the film. I recommend this for anyone seriously interested or involved in acting of any venue.",1306713600,5,1107,4.624365482233503
