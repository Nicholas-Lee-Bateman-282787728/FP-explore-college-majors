6575593,5,B00MEVMU8S,"I wondered how this would be different from the classic MSTK3 take on ""Manos"" and if it would be as funny.  I needn't have worried!  This really is an all-new and highly enjoyable skewering of the most wretched film ever made, and the bonus material of outtakes with commentary is a special feature worthy to be called such.",1419033600,2,324,4.568965517241379
6575594,5,B00MEVMU8S,"I have the regular Mystery Science Theater 3000, and the deluxe 2-CD MST3K version, of ""Manos: The Hands Of Fate.""  Even when you take that into account, it's well worth buying the RiffTrax version of ""Manos: The Hands Of Fate.""  First of all, Michael Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett riff the short subjects ""Welcome Back, Norman"" and ""At Your Fingertips: Cylinders,"" along with a vintage commercial for prune juice.  Speaking of cylinders, Mike, Kevin and Bill are firing on all cylinders with their riffing.  The riffs for the movie come fast and furious, even when the action in the movie does not.  Pity poor Torgo, and his swollen knees, not to mention his rocky relationship with his Master.  When viewing Torgo about to be sacrificed on an outdoor altar, Mike Nelson quips, ""All the splendor of a hobo napping on a park bench finally comes to the big screen.""  The highlight of the movie is the catfight among all of the Master's wives, which is accurately described as the least erotic catfight ever filmed.  As a bonus feature, outtakes from the movie are included.  They show the Master without his trademark cape, and his wives fighting in their street clothes, along with scenes too dark to make out any action.  Once again, the best thing about the outtakes is the riffing by the RiffTrax guys.",1412640000,7,1314,4.774336283185841
6575595,5,B00MEVMU8S,"ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS!!!  I loved Joel doing it for MST3K, but I'm a Mike fan and this was... PHENOMENAL.  The riffs are nonstop and gut-bustingly funny - and there are OUTTAKES from the film!  The riffs on those are hysterical, too.

The clarity of the film is better, too.  Had a viewing party for this, and every single one of my friends who hadn't already ordered it put their names on the waiting list.  Our sides and lungs hurt from the laughter.

Mike, Bill, and Kevin have hit a grand-slam home run with their riffing of Manos... you will NOT be disappointed!",1409961600,6,566,4.544554455445544
6575596,5,B00MEVMU8S,"IF you watch the RIFFTRAX version of MANOS, and your familiar with the MST3K version, of course you're going to compare. In many ways, I suppose i prefer the MST3K version. However, the humor of the riffing often depends on making pop culture referrals, and of course that's where the problem lies. Because the MST3K version is 25 years old. The RIFFTRAX version will automatically be the preferred version for millenials, people who go for Mike over Joel, or anyone who doesn't want to watch the skits between the show. This MANOS also was preformed live, in front of a large audience, and transmitted to theaters around the country. It includes a couple of shorts, plus you have the added bonus of hearing the audience reactions in the theater, which serves as a type of laugh track. So even though I have nostalgia for the original version, this version is just as fun to watch.

About the MANOS film: what can you say? Hearing TORGO say  ""The Master will not be pleased"", has the same resonance in me, as hearing ""NO MORE WIRE HANGERS!"", or ""BUT YOU ARE BLANCHE, YOU ARE IN THAT WHEELCHAIR!"" The amount of pop culture that has arisen around the film is amazing. The little girl in the film has written a book about her experience, which is available on Amazon to buy. (At least read the free preview, since Joel writes a couple of pages.) Also, there's an on line TORGO blog, with interesting information. For example, the actor portraying Torgo killed himself about a month before the film's preview. The actor playing the Master is the real life father of the little girl, and he's the one who made all those hand sculptures. Of course you know a fertilizer salesman not only wrote and directed the film, he stared as the father taking his family on vacation. Like any great work of art, your appreciation of the film will grow with multiple viewings. This time, I was focused on Torgo having his hand burned off, before he ran into the desert at night. Also, check out the enormous amount of screen time spent on staring at the painting of the master. Plus, the bizarre continuity mistakes. For example, notice the mother's white doily she has tied over her head. It keeps appearing and disappearing, for no reason. There are so many technical mistakes, that they could just riff on them for at least 3 or 4 more versions, and never mention them all. For anyone not familiar with the movie, I do not want to give away the BIZARRE twist at the end. (Not that I think I could ruin the movie. That boat set sail in 1966.) I'll just say, that for a film without much plot, don't expect much. However, this film is a classic for these guys, and watching it preformed live, is sort of like watching Paul McCartney preform Hey Jude in concert. Its not better than the Beatles' version, but it is done live, and it is updated for today's tastes.",1488153600,,2844,4.552734375
6575597,5,B00MEVMU8S,This was one of the best Rifftrax yet.  Absolutely love the Live Rifftrax releases!,1487116800,,83,4.928571428571429
6575598,5,B00MEVMU8S,"Best looking version of the movie to date.
Genuinely laugh out loud funny, with several moments that should become classic. (Redneck Twilight anyone?) Mike, Bill and Kevin are at the top of their game riffing this one live, and they're dragging an audience along as well. Of course - nearly all of their material is new for this version so it's a great time to double dip if you already own the original. That said - this one is for die-hard ""Bad Movie"" fans only.
It's a peculiarly terrible movie with very strange choices that could only come from having no money and no talent. If you're an MST3K fan you already know of this movie, if you're new to the riff world - better ask a friend or watch the trailer before purchasing. It's still high up on my list of best bad movies ever!

6575600,1,B00MEVMU8S,Eh...the live version of this is annoying because the riffers are on the side indicating their comments. It is very distracting and over all not a very funny version of Manos. Check out the MST3k version which is much better!,1486166400,,225,4.65
6575601,5,B00MEVMU8S,"Oh. My. God. SUCH a terrible movie and the Rifftrax guys (formerly of MST3K) have such an amazingly funny ""side dialog"" of jokes and commentary, I had to excuse myself for a moment, if you know what I mean. There are a couple of equally horrible and dated shorts before the main show that start the laughs and set up a few recurring jokes. The guys not only have hilarious lines, but they are really well performed, with nice timing and characterizations. A real hoot (just be sure to visit the restroom first).",1485734400,,511,4.505376344086022

6575603,5,B00MEVMU8S,"The Master will not be please if you don't watch this B grade classic, Torgo might pay you a late night visit. Only a fertilizer salesman could make such an iconic piece.

6575604,5,B00MEVMU8S,"MST3K sent up MANOS, THE HANDS OF FATE back in 1992 and saved it from the obscurity it so richly deserved.  In 2012 the RiffTrax crew took it on again (with all-new insults, we are told) for one of their live performances in Nashville.  Texan Harold Hal Warren wrote, directed, and plays the hapless Papa in this 1966 vanity production who strands himself, his wife and daughter in a mysterious house deep in the West Texas scrub.  A hobbled and repulsive young man, Torgo (some people believe he was meant to be a satyr), keeps house, which is ruled by The Master, who keeps a polygamous harem and lives to serve Manos.

This is an astonishingly bad film, an imdB 1.9, perhaps the worst ever to hit the Mistie machine.  Acting is amateurish at best, shots are held too long or terminated too soon,  film quality is wretched, and continuity all but nonexistent.  A necking couple in a sports car on the road to the satanic enclave serve no real purpose anyone can comprehend.  Cat-fights break out among the harem for no real purpose except titillation, and no one can take The Master seriously in his flaming-hands get-up.  Mike, Kevin and Bill have a great time with all this and play to an appreciative audience.  The show includes a ""Norm"" short, a short that shows children implausibly fashioning complex toys from old oatmeal boxes and toilet-tissue tubes, and a vintage prune-juice commercial.  All in all, highly recommended.  Viewing is free to Prime members.",1485475200,,1468,4.758893280632411

6575633,5,B00MEVMU8S,"Ed Wood, the patron saint of inept filmmakers, must've anointed Hal Warren to put his wacko sexual fantasies on film, and for that we who love professional movie riffing are grateful. MANOS, the plotless, poorly lit, out-of-focus anti-masterpiece rescued from oblivion by MST3K, gets the Rifftrax treatment, and what a difference twenty years makes!

Where the movie's interminable driving sequences had reduced the 'bots to tears in 1992, Mike, Kevin, and Bill sail through them now with a steady stream of jokes about the Texas landscape. The pop culture references are fresher (they actually manage to work in an extended riff on TWILIGHT), and the trio knows when to stop riffing and just let the movie mock itself. Above all, there's Torgo (greeted by audience applause at his first onscreen appearance)...Mike Nelson's incomparable rendition of Torgo is reason enough to watch this version, even if you hate MANOS (and who doesn't?). The two shorts and a vintage TV commercial are great fun as well.",1420675200,,1005,5.128048780487805

8671850,5,B00MEVMU8S,"This DVD will appeal to a few groups of people, but likely the groups intersect.  I'm a huge fan of Manos, but it is because of MST3K.  I have been following the progress of the restoration of the original work print of Manos since it was discovered a few years ago and I DEFINITELY recommend buying the blu-ray version (which doesn't include rifftrax or MST3K commentary).

So the big things about this release. You get to see Manos being riffed with new jokes. You get to see Manos as it was seen by that small group of folks in that theatre in Texas.

The biggest feature of this DVD is you get to see the outtakes from the film! This isn't even available on the blu-ray release, inexplicably.  To be honest, this was one of the main reasons I bought it.

The new riffs are good and hearing the audience response is great, but if you are a fan of the MST3K one, you'll find yourself wanting to hear those jokes often.

First, the film is not cut which clears up some plot gaps from the edited version; there is at least another ten minutes of riotously rotten goodness here.  Second,  since the bottom of the screen is not cut off with theater seats, you can at last view Torgo's ridiculous ""satyr"" costuming in all its wacked out glory.  Third, the audience really gets revved up by the end of the film, as Mike, Kevin, and Bill do some rapid fire riffing for a strong finish of hilarity.
