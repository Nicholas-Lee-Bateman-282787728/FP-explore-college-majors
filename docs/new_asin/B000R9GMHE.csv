2862834,3,B000R9GMHE,"An Aaron Spelling/Danny Thomas production, the made for TV  movie, Wake Me When The War is Over (1969), features a number of familiar sitcom stars, in a silly World War II based comedy.

Ken Berry (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mama-s-Family/dp/B00D2UMHB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mama's Family</a>, Mayberry RFD) is US Army Lt. Roger Carrington, who much like the character he played in F Troop, is a clumsy not too bright type, who accidentally falls out a plane, and parachutes into Nazi Germany, where he is taken in and hidden by the lonely Baroness Marlene (Eva Gabor,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Acres/dp/B0000V4906/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Acres</a>).  Minus the monocle he wore as Colonel Kink on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hogan-s-Heroes/dp/B002L9N4O2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hogan's Heroes</a>, Werner Klemperer plays a German officer searching for the American. In hiding, and unable to understand German, a clueless Carrington remains a ""guest"" of the Baroness, for several years after the war has ended.  Still unaware of the truth, Carrington finally leaves the Baroness' estate, along with Eva (Danielle De Metz), a maid who wishes to help.

If you appreciate what Ken Berry did on F Troop, you will probably enjoy this movie, which is largely devoted to his character.  There aren't many big laughs, but there are a lot of familiar faces, including Hans Conried, Jim Backus, Parley Baer, and Woodrow Parfrey.  Not to be confused with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wake-Me-When-It-s-Over/dp/B00979KQGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wake Me When It's Over</a>&nbsp;(1960), another WWII comedy.",1380412800,,1804,6.9911111111111115

8199640,4,B000R9GMHE,"This is a fun movie.  The primary stars, Ken Berry and Eva Gabor, took time out from their own respective successful series, MAYBERRY R.F.D. and GREEN ACRES, to participate in this 1969 ABC television movie.  The supporting cast includes Werner Klemperer, who at that time was better known as Colonel Wilhelm Kling from the on-going series HOGAN'S HEROES, as well as Jim Backus from the previously canceled GILLIGAN'S ISLAND.  Also look for Hans Conried, who was also a one-time guest star on HOGAN'S HEROES.

The film's plot is somewhat similar to the 1965 Alec Guinness film SITUATION HOPELESS - BUT NOT SERIOUS.  Ken Berry plays a downed Army Air Force officer who finds himself well behind the lines in Nazi Germany.  Eva Gabor, portraying a widowed German baroness, hides the flier into her home.  The baroness becomes so fond of the American officer's company that she neglects to tell him that the war has ended, thus extending Berry's stay for several years.  The officer ultimately leaves the security of the estate when he is falsely led to believe the Gestapo is on the way to arrest him.  What then follows are his misadventures traveling through a pacified post-war Germany in an attempt to reach the safety of the long non-existent Allied lines.

First and foremost, there is never any doubt that this movie was filmed in Southern California.  Palm trees are clearly visible in many of the scenes.  Also look for the oft used six wheel Mercedes that made regular appearances on HOGAN'S HEROES.  For those of you who are RAT PATROL fans, there is an extended scene of Ken Berry in a ""German"" vehicle park consisting of yellow/sand painted armored vehicles such as a Sherman tank and armored cars that were featured two years earlier during the television run of THE RAT PATROL.

The quality of the DVD is good.  Remember that this movie was made in 1969 for broadcast reception on a standard television screen.  This version is certainly not a restored copy.  My often shows film scratches appearing on the left side of the screen.  Still, this is a decent film that fits in well with the HOGAN'S HEROES and WHAT DID YOU DO IN THE WAR DADDY genre.  It was great to see this television movie again after a 45 year absence.",1419724800,,2234,4.740932642487047
