2479932,3,B000E1MXWS,"This series is a bit disappointing to me. I am a fan of horror, but never had time to watch this on TV. After finally springing for six seasons (seven is a BBC thing), I was disappointed to find so much time wasted with the little Crypt Keeper. On top of that, season one is really about a half season, and every other of the three-disc season is really just over two discs long, and seems like it could fit on two discs and maybe be sold two seasons at a time. What little production content is there is very ""hit-and-miss,"" with maybe one or two decent episodes per season. Overall, a big disappointment and sort of a ripoff when compared with shows like ""Fringe"" or ""Supernatural.""",1440979200,,684,4.393700787401575

Episodes

Loved To Death - Amusing first episode and honestly a great way to start this terrific season. Mariel Hemmingway stars as a woman who after drinking a love potion has an unstoppable urge for ""love"". It's funny and weird. I loved it. Great way to start. 3.5 out of 4

Carrion Death - Classic episode about a criminal on the run from a cop as a hungry vulture flies above. The ending is gory and disturbing. A truly brilliant episode. 4 out of 4

The Trap - Maybe the funniest episode of the set features a husband and wife who are in dept and fake the husbands death for quick cash. Plenty of twists and laughs here. Michael J Fox directs and even has a cameo. Entertaining as can be. 3.5 out of 4

Abra Cadaver - Memorable episode about a guy getting revenge against his doctor brother for a prank gone wrong. I made it sound unoriginal but it's not. It gruesome and different. Also well directed. Like it alot. Another must see. Great. 3.5 out of 4

Top Billing - One of the finest of the set about an actor who will do anything to star in the lead of a very stange take on Hamlet.  It builds nicely to a shocking climax. Jon Lovitz is great as usual. 4 out of 4

Dead Wait - Whoopi Goldberg stars! A terrific little horror tale featuring crime and voodoo on a tropical island. Well done all in all. Season 3 really has so many standouts. 3.5 out of 4

The Reluctant Vampire - IMO the weakest episode up to this point but it is quite loved by Crypt fans. It concerns a vampire who hates to who hates to get blood the way vampires are supposed to. It's a funny episode on a whole and the acting is good. 3 out of 4

Easel Kill Ya - Amazing episode in every way.  Tim Roth stars as a struggling artist who kills for the sake of art. Tim Roth is fantastic here. Totally memorable with a typical Tales finish. 4 out of 4

Undertaking Palor - There are so many classics here! Another Tales masterpiece. This one is about a group of friends who realize something is just not right about the local mortuary.  John Glover stars as the villain. Top notch episode in every way. 4 out of 4

Mournin Mess - A reporter is down on his luck and finally has a story when homeless people are turning up dead. But this is Tales From The Crypt so ya know what to expect. Brilliant and suspenseful. Works in so many ways. The finale is perfect and unpredictable. Keeps you guessing. 4 out of 4

Split Second - Another winner but at this point I am sure you are not surprised. A woman marries a lumberjack but when a she begins to seduce another lumberjack.... well let's say it does not end well for anyone. The finish is gruesome and easily one of the most mmemorable finishes of the season. Great performances. 4 out of 4

Deadline - The only clunker of the set. Ugh why did there have to be one? This is just weak. But it's still not bad.  A reporter has to find a good murder story to save his job. Predictable and it never really goes anywhere. by the end you say.... wait.. that's it? Meh whatever. 2 out of 4

Spoiled - Funny episode though it borderlines on stupid a few times. But I think that was the point (?) . This plays as a real life Soap Opera. A woman cheats on her doctor husband with the cable guy Able! It leads to an absurd comic finish. May work better as a comic. But fun episode. 3 out of 4

Yellow - Masterful episode. A WW1 General tries to prove his soldier son is not yellow (a coward).  I did not like this the first time. But I was expecting a horror tale not a full on drama. I watched it a 2nd time and I was WRONG. Brilliant. It's sad, the performances led by a Emmy nominated performance from Kirk Douglas are top notch. The music is great, the opening is great. It's a powerful episode. 4 out of 4

A brilliant season. A must own.",1297987200,,3960,4.163826998689384
2479971,5,B000E1MXWS,"The Third Season, what can you say, horror-hounds? This was a great time to be alive, a great time for music, movies, sports, and television. And most importantly a great time for Tales From the Crypt.

Season Three is dead in the middle of the first 5 seasons run which define the show. There are a bunch of classics, but even the bad episodes are still entertaining. Our pal the Cryptkeeper is always there to hold our hand and guide us through his delightful vault of horror and fun. Let's get straight to the gorey details.

*** POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS ***

1. ""Loved To Death"" - Terrific opener with Andrew McCarthy as a lovesick tenant pining for his shrew of a neighbor. But she can't stand him. The only logical decision for him is to pursue a love potion solution. Unfortunately, as is often the case with such things, there are unintended consequences. If you thought they were gonna live happily ever after, you've got a lot to learn. 4 Stars.

2. ""Carrion Death"" - Another amazing episode. This season really starts off banging out the classics. This one has the always fabulous Kyle MacLachlan as a ruthless fugitive fleeing into the desert, on the run from a psychotic highway patrolman. And a vulture. 4 Stars.

3. ""The Trap"" - A somewhat convoluted installment about a scheming thug who forces his coroner brother, the great Bruno Kirby, into vouching for his faked death. Light on the horror, a break from the intensity the episodes surrounding it. 3 Stars.

4. ""Abra Cadaver"" - Beau Bridges is a mad scientist who plays an elaborate practical joke on a rival. This is ""The Trip"" of Tales From The Crypt. Like a Cheech & Chong film, you have to be under the influence to get the full effect of this episode. 4 Stars.

5. ""Top Billing"" - This episode didn't seem scary at first. But by the end I realized it was scary as hell. The cast is superb, with the iconic John Astin playing a mad director, casting roles for his own horrifying version of Hamlet. The build-up is excellent, the climax pays off quite well. Jon Lovitz, Bruce Boxleitner, and Sandra Bernhard also appear, among others. Impressive installment, 5 Stars.

6. ""Dead Wait"" - A gritty crime / voodoo drama about an American criminal that steals an occult black pearl. Whoopi Goldberg and John Rhys-Davies also star. These kind of Tales... episodes are always pretty good. 4 Stars.

7. ""The Reluctant Vampire"" - This is an unbelievably good installment about a noble vampire who works as a security guard at a blood bank. Malcolm McDowell plays the vampire, and he is opposed by two very worthy adversaries. The first is Norm from Cheers, who plays his villainous boss. Norm's a real dirtbag in this, and he is on McDowell's back relentlessly. The other is the horror cult favorite Michael Berryman. Berryman is famous for his roles in the original The Hills Have Eyes, among many other things. He plays a descendant of the vampire hunter Van Helsing. The whole thing plays out beautifully. One of my absolute favorites, this has it all. 5 Stars.

8. ""Easel Kill Ya"" - I've always found this one memorable. It's a study of a disturbed young artist played by Tim Roth. He discovers his talents are increased when he paints portraits of people he's murdered. Incredibly stark imagery, bleak storytelling, edgy characters, withstands multiple viewings. 4 and a half Stars.

9. ""Undertaking Palor"" - Pure brilliance. One of the greatest episodes of any show ever. This is about a bunch of kids who uncover a deeply sinister murder conspiracy in a small town. They decide to grab their video camera and document their investigation. This is another episode that has it all. Eeriness, laughs, suspense, gore. TFTC at its absolute finest. 5 Stars.

10. ""Mournin' Mess"" - Steven Weber's a reporter whose investigation of homeless murders leads him to a strange cemetary. While he's there, he meets a bunch of ghouls. A very cool episode. At this point the series is operating at an insanely high level of quality. 4 and a half Stars.

11. ""Split Second"" - This is the sexiest episode of this season. It's about a community of lumberjacks that is being torn apart over the love of one superhot lumberjack chick. One new guy, in particular, falls in love with her. But her lumberjack boss boyfriend has got plans of his own. And let's be honest, it's not like chainsaws are hard to find in this community. They're practically tripping over chainsaws, these lumberjacks. 2 and half Stars.

12. ""Deadline"" - An alcoholic reporter takes desperate measures to file a story. But he seems more determined to end up in a straightjacket. This episode features the great actor of the silver and small screen, Jon Polito, in a supporting role. Jon Polito is a fabulous actor, anything with him is great. 3 and a half Stars.

13. ""Spoiled"" - Here you go, the traditional crap episode of the set. Every season has at least one awful episode, and for Season Three it's ""Spoiled"". It's about a fairly hot-looking housewife that starts getting it on with Anthony LaPaglia, who is the cable guy. The catch is that her husband is a bit of a mad scientist, so he gets revenge. It's pretty boring. The worst part is, the payoff at the end is disappointing because of terrible special effects. I'm not a guy who normally complains about the effects, but this is bad CGI and it looks horrible and makes this bad episode more of a joke. 1 Star.

14. ""Yellow"" - From the pages of ShockSuspense Stories comes this fantastic season finale. ""Yellow""'s a moving tale about a WWI general and his soldier son. The father is obsessed with his son's cowardice, and demands absolute fearlessness in battle. The son finds this task beyond his ability, but is consumed with the idea of proving his father wrong. The cast is amazing, Kirk Douglas and his son Eric are the father and son. Lance Henriksen and Dan Aykroyd co-star. This is longest of any TFTC episode, clocking in at 40 minutes. A wonderful work of art, perfect close to the season. 4 and a half Stars.

That's it for the Third Season. These are among my favorite DVDs to watch. I've written reviews for each of these seasons, because they're so much fun. I am endlessly fascinated with HBO's Tales From The Crypt. This is such a great show. And as always, even the horrible episodes are fun to watch because of our buddy Crypty.

This is the ultimate in comedy-horror. Peace out, creeps.",1283126400,,6386,4.6815343443354145

2479976,5,B000E1MXWS,"I recently purchased most of the season from Tales from the Crypt and couldn't be more happy. This is one of my all time favorite shows. I remember when I was young how great the stories were and only hoped they would hold up now. Luckily they are even better then I remembered. The perfect amount of horror and comedy make this series worth every penny. I am going to break down the episodes Season 3 provides;

Overall an exeptional season. I loved every episode except for ""Deadline"". If you are or have been a fan of Tales from the Crypt you must own them on DVD.",1204156800,,2652,4.747276688453159

2479978,3,B000E1MXWS,"Except poor transfer quality of the set (not better than your old VHS copies)this is the most gruesome, dark and most bloody season.

2479980,5,B000E1MXWS,"I watched this show a lot growing up, and for the most part the shows holds up to my memories. Many of the episodes are excellent, and I watch them quite a bit. The ""twist"" to most of the episodes is pretty standard, so you can kind of figure out what is going to happen, however there are still a lot of surprises and great examples of story telling.",1179014400,,351,4.101449275362318
2479981,5,B000E1MXWS,"Greetings, boils and ghouls! Are you prepared to feast on the latest boo-fet of blood-curderling tales to tickle your funny bone? Well, I've got just the poison for you: a terrorific total of 14 uncut and uncensored episodes of ""Tales from the Crypt."" Some creeps say that 3 is a magic number, and there's no doubt that 1991 was THE year of fear for The Crypt Keeper and his many deadtime stories. Even better is the fact that the set's special creature features include interviews, a panel discussion, and a music video of ""The Crypt Jam,"" which was first made to promote the show's original scare soundtrack. So plump up that coffin pillow and settle back your bones. Here are just some of the tales your mother would never tell you.

In ""Loved to Death,"" Andrew McCarthy plays Edward Foster, a freelance screenwriter suffering a gnawing case of writer's block. That changes, however, when he meets Miranda Singer (Mariel Hemingway), an ambitious B-movie actress with a very short fuse. Attracted to her (and envisioning her in one of his naughty celluloid fantasies), Eddie tries to win Miranda over by accepting a powerful love elixer from his sinister landlord (David Hemmings), It was easy to propose a toast and to slip the formula into Miranda's glass of red wine. Unfortunately, the potion works TOO well, and only death can help cure the actress and save poor Ed from her monstrous sex drive.

In ""The Trap,"" Lou Pulloma (Bruno Kirby) is a lazy deadbeat of a husband who beats his wife Irene (Teri Garr) and mooches even his own mother out of every penny she has. In order to escape their financial woes, Lou decides to collect on his life insurance by fabricating his own death, dragging his coroner brother Bill (Bruce McGill) into the scheme. All that was needed was a knife, a poker, a phony death certificate, and a good story. But once the police and grieving relatives believed in Lou's tragic demise, Irene and Bill turn the tables on him by convincing everyone that Lou is an imposter. Because he was stupid enough to leave fingerprints on the alleged weapon, Lou gets arrested and sent to the electric chair for his own murder! Oh, did I forget to mention there's a cameo appearance by actor Michael J. Fox, who just happens to be the episode's director?

If you kiddies think ""House"" is frightening, then it's nothing when compared to the antics of ""Abra Cadaver."" Doctors Carl (Tony Goldwyn) and Martin Fairbanks (Beau Bridges) are bickering brothers whose only common passion is playing practical jokes. Carl even goes so far as to shock his brother by 'reviving' a corpse in the hospital morgue...and giving Martin a heart attack that leaves him paralyzed on one side, ruining his medical career. To get his revenge, Martin poisons his brother to stop his heart and inject an experimental drug into his bloodstream, causing Carl's brain to remain alive even after clinical death. As a result, he can still see, hear, and feel sensations while being unable to move, leaving Carl defenseless on the embalming table! Of course, all this turns out to be a harmless joke...right? Well, not when Carl loses function in his heart a second time and gets sawed open in a routine autopsy.

""Top Billing"" concerns comedian Jon Lovitz as a starving actor named Barry Blye who is falling down society's poverty line. After many years of trying to earn a living on the stage, he loses both his decrepit apartment and his girlfriend in one day. Desperate to make it big, Barry auditions for the lead role in an independent production of ""Hamlet"" lead by Dustin Halliwell, the cast's creepy and kooky director (John Astin). But when the part is given to his suave and handsome rival Winton Robbins (Bruce Boxleitner), the jealous Barry strangles him with a piece of rope, only to discover the playhouse is run solely by escaped homicidal maniacs!

In ""Dead Wait,"" a petty thief named Red Buckley (James Remar) travels to a Carribean island to steal a priceless black pearl from ailing millionaire Duvall (John Rhys-Davies). With little hesitation, Red sleeps around with his sexy vixen wife Kathy (Vanity) and together they plot to swipe the pearl out from under the owner's nose. This dark and grisly chess game is complicated when Red is followed and warned by a voodoo guide named Peligree (Whoopi Goldberg), whose only real motive is to grab Red's precious locks of hair...by any means necessary!

One of my personal favorite 1991 tales is ""The Reluctant Vampire,"" which is set in a local blood bank happily watched over by Donald Longtooth (Malcolm McDolwell), a compassionate bloodsucker whose job as a security guard allows him easy access to the bank's supply of A+ and O-. The reason he does this is because despite his killer instincts, taking human life for self-nourishment isn't exactly his favorite hobby. On top of that, he's in love with Sally (Sandra Dickenson), an innocent co-worker who is repeatedly harrassed by the bank's lecherous boss (George Wendt). To replenish the bank's plasma storage and prevent workers from losing their jobs, Donald takes a bite out of crime by targeting burglars and carjackers, all the while having a mysterious vampire hunter (Michael Berryman) on his tail.

""Easel Kill Ya"" is an artistic episode that exudes dread and hopelessness though every brushstroke. Tim Roth portrays a lonely, withdrawn oil painter named Jack Craig who has a rather difficult time striving toward his goal while dealing with the world around him. One night, after his downstairs neighbor accidentally falls off a balcony, Jack finally finds his secret talent by making a portrait of the bloody aftermath. Jack's style is even further displayed after he pushes an old woman down a flight of stairs. The only individual interested in his work is a savvy but morbid art collector (Malcolm Mayflower), whose generous cash offering is equal to that of a Faustian contract. Putting his freedom and life on the line, Jack goes out to spill more crimson onto to his canvas in exchange for more gory greenbacks.

""Mournin' Mess"" is a tasty morsel of a tale centered on a womanizing newspaper columnist named Dale Sweeney (Steven Weber). It seems a psychotic killer is preying upon the homeless, and one of them has been framed for the crimes (Vincent Schiavelli RIP). The man eventually forces Dale to investigate the murders, and the red trail soon leads to the Grateful Homeless Cemetary. There, over six feet underground, a covert group of balding ghouls with razor-sharp teeth harvest the corpses for one purpose...LUNCH!

""Deadline"" is a noir-style thriller about Charlie Mackenzie (Richard Jordan), a washed-out reporter with an uncanny addiction to alcohol (one that would inevetably drive him insane). In his last chance to stay sober and regain his status, Charlie searches for a juicy murder story, preferably a crime of passion. Along the way, he gets smitten with Vicki  (Marg Heleberger), a young prostitute who refuses to indulge in long-term relationships. Later on, when he learns that Vicki was cruelly toying with the emotions of her Greek diner husband, and that he throttled her behind the bar, Charlie seizes his opportunity to interview the sobbing spouse. But Vicki isn't dead...at least not yet as far as the reporter was concerned.",1157760000,7,7284,4.929095354523227

2479983,5,B000E1MXWS,"The third season of HBO's Tales From the Crypt proved to be another excellent and fright filled season of the show based on the classic EC horror comics, and like the season before it, season three featured more star studded episodes both in front of and behind the camera.  Standouts of the third season include the Michael J. Fox directed ""The Trap"", in which a con man who fakes his own death gets more than he bargained for, as well as ""Carrion Death"" in which a con on the run (Kyle MacLachlan) runs in to the law, and drags it along with him (literally).  The Stephen Hopkins directed ""Abra Cadaver"" finds sibling doctors (Tony Goldwyn and Beau Bridges) on different sides of a terror filled prank, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre maestro Tobe Hooper contributes ""Dead Wait"" with Whoppi Goldberg.  ""Top Billing"" is a standout as Jon Lovitz plays a struggling actor who gets the role of a lifetime, and it costs him plenty.  Malcolm McDowell is a hoot in ""The Reluctant Vampire"", while the season closes with one of the series' absolute best episodes ""Yellow"", directed by Robert Zemeckis and featuring Kirk Douglas in World War II supervising his cowardly son (real life son Eric Douglas) whose fear of dying gets the better of him.  All in all, the third seaon of Tales From the Crypt is yet another superb collection of horror yarns, and believe it or not, things even get better yet.",1148947200,2,1388,4.672131147540983

That i could handle,  but what really sucks is that the picture quality looks like VHS!The first 2 seasons looked great. But the third looks like im actually watching them in 1991! In a way it feels old school, but dam we are in the dvd age and i wish they looked good like the first 2 seasons. i hope they go back to the old packaging and remastering in the 4th season!",1148515200,8,534,4.085714285714285
2479985,5,B000E1MXWS,"Based on stories from the deliciously depraved E.C. horror comics (TALES FROM THE CRYPT, VAULT OF HORROR, HAUNT OF FEAR, etc.) of the 1950s, TALES FROM THE CRYPT was a TV horror anthology that, like most TV anthologies, had a lot of both hits and misses. Originally airing on HBO and then later in syndication, some of the episodes fell short, but when a story was a hit, it was usually dead on (excuse the pun). The critical and popular success of the first two seasons on HBO meant that a third season inevitable, and this three-disc set features all 14 episodes of the third season in their original uncut form (in syndication, episodes were edited to remove non-cable no-nos like nudity, severe profanity, and ""excessive"" gore).

Season three continues the trend of featuring well-known and highly talented stars--episodes here offer performances from Teri Garr, Michael J. Fox, Mariel Hemingway, comedian Jon Lovitz, Beau Bridges, Oscar winner Whoopi Goldberg, Tim Roth, Michelle Johnson, and Kirk Douglas, to name but a few--and since the bulk of these scripts are derived from E.C. stories that are actually darker, more ironic, and less ""comicy"" than those of the previous two seasons, this is arguably the best season of the three.  Nonetheless, some episodes still stand out above the others, and the cream of this crop includes:

""Top Billing"" stars the delightful comedic actor Jon Lovitz as a frumpy, struggling thespian who will kill to get a part.  And when his handsome and longtime rival (Bruce Boxleitner) usurps his role in an urban repertory company's production of HAMLET, Lovitz literally strangles the competition to reclaim the part.  However, when reporting for rehearsal, the homicidal ham discovers that his role in the play is not the one for which he auditioned.

""Easel Kill Ya"" features Tim Roth--genre fans have seen him in films like Tim Burton's 2001 remake PLANET OF THE APES and 2005's DARK WATER, among others--as a starving artist who starts on the road to fame and riches after he inadvertently kills a neighbor and then decides to paint his interpretation of the bloody aftermath.  He attempts to abandon his gory aesthetic at the request of a new girlfriend, but when she becomes the victim of a hit-and-run accident, he finds that he must create one more murderous work of art in order to cover the cost of the operation that can save her life.

In ""Split Second,"" when a gruff lumberjack foreman (the late Brion James) weds a beautiful young barmaid (Michelle Johnson), he soon becomes a violently jealous husband who harasses his workers for ogling his wife, even though it is she who incessantly flirts with and teases the loggers.  When the foreman discovers his spouse in bed with a new employee (Billy Wirth), he flies into a rage and blinds the young man during the ensuing brawl.  But fellow loggers, fed up with the foreman's behavior, arrange for the young man to get his revenge.  A fun episode that is also notable for shots of the very sexy Ms. Johnson sans blouse and bra.

""Yellow"" stars Kirk Douglas as a stone-hearted, by-the-book WWI General, and Eric Douglas (Kirk's real-life offspring) portrays the General's son, a craven Lieutenant who is under the General's command during a critical battle in France. Embarrassed by his ""yellow"" progeny, the General engages his son in an insidious course of action that will save the young man's reputation as well as allow the General himself to save face. Although the ending is easy to foresee, the acting is top-notch and the depiction of WWI is fairly gruesome, and it all adds up to an engaging and suspenseful drama.  Directed by Oscar winner (1994's FORREST GUMP) Robert Zemeckis.

This DVD set from Warner Home Video offers fairly clean digital transfers of these delightful episodes of this popular show.  The packaging is a little better than that of the previous two seasons--instead of hard-plastic disc cradles attached to fan-fold cardboard, this set has two slim-line DVD cases that fit into a superfluous cardboard sleeve--but the extras (two featurettes documenting TFTC staff appearances at a comic con and a lame rap video) aren't quite as exciting.  Still,  TALES FROM THE CRYPT--THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON is a must-own for all serious horror fans.",1147046400,4,4270,4.966339410939692
2479986,3,B000E1MXWS,"I'm disappointed because Warner not only changed the box (which is now even higher than the former ones) but also spent no time or money on any remastering. The picture quality of the third season is much worse now - I remember the episodes even clearer in (German) TV. While seasons one and two were given in a perfect presentation, the new season is a let down in quality.

2479987,4,B000E1MXWS,"I have to admit that owning the first two volumes of Tales from the Crypt have been a prideful boast of mine.  However, with the release of Volume 3, Warner has decided to skimp on packaging and ignore what was great about the first two editions and their shelf appeal.  I was not surprised as Warner has often chosen to forgo great packaging to save a buck.  Anyway, the content proves to be in the same vein as those that precede it with some of the highlights including Andrew McCarthy's episode, Anthony LaPaglia's turn as a cable repairman, and Kirk Douglas and late son Eric in the final episode of the collection entitled ""Yellow"".  The series now seems to tread in deep water as it tries to maintain its edge after satiating its audiences with original appeal for the first two seasons.  Some of the episodes this go-round fall a little flat.  But knowing what I recall of the series' later years, more excitement is yet to come!  And in the meantime, don't miss Whoopi Goldberg as a voodoo priestess in this one.  Classic!",1143331200,2,1031,4.565217391304348
2479988,5,B000E1MXWS,"Tales from the Crypt season three doesn't disappoint, except the package does. All of the episodes are very entertaining and brilliantly written. There are no dead coming back to life stories this season, but the stories prove you don't need it to be creepy. What really shines on this DVD collection are the extras.

The first extra is the ""Crypt Jam"" music video. It's a video made in '92 with the Cryptkeeper rapping. It's pretty funny, be sure to look at the man on the right of the Cryptkeeper at the end of the video. It's John Kassir, the man behind the voice of the Cryptkeeper. He's only on for like three or four seconds so be sure to look fast.

""A Tall Tales Panel"" is video clips of some of the behind the scenes crew, John Kassir and a couple others at ComicCon last year with personal interviews thrown in. They tell all the behind the scenes things you'd want to know, even somethings that weren't said on the season one documentary. Although not as long as the documentary on season one, it's still something not to be missed.

""The Reunion"" is the full ComicCon convention guest appearance without the breaks in the middle of it to introduce everyone. This is a lengthier version of the extra above and fun to watch. There's even a Q&A with the fans.

Overall, this season is worthy of buying. Great stuff with great extras!",1143158400,3,1342,4.533057851239669
2479989,4,B000E1MXWS,"This is a pretty great selection of episodes. As with any season some episodes are better then others and there are a few duds. This is actually the best season released so far in my opinion, season 2 is good but there are to many zombie revenge episodes.

You may also notice that the episodes here are noticably longer then in season 1 or 2. Most of these episodes run close to the 30 minute mark (Even a 40 minute episode). In previous seasons the episodes only ran around 20-22 minutes. Also, the introduction that was missing in previous seasons is rightfully included. I recommend this for any fan of the show, the extras on this set are alot better then the ones on season 2.

It should also be noted that the box is different then seasons 1 and 2. This one has 2 small dvd cases inside the box rather then a fold out digipack.",1142985600,11,834,4.305732484076433
2479990,4,B000E1MXWS,"I was er...shocked when I recieved my Tales from the Crypt Season 3 Dvds. Why? I'll tell you. For some reason or other, the BEAUTIFUL packaging job that fans i'm sure drooled over in season 1 and 2, is basically GONE! No slip cover, 3 dvd's slammed into 2 thin plastic cases (like every other show does) and no gatefold episode presentations, and to make matters worse, the box stands a little bit higher up then the first 2 seasons. There is a lack of kick ass artwork and the cover isn't even embossed!

They either didn't make enough $$$ or they want to make more $$$, either way, i'm pretty upset. Still a rad show and i'll be buying the other five seasons.",1142899200,9,661,4.330645161290323
2479991,5,B000E1MXWS,"I remember watching ""Tales From The Crypt"" re-runs as a kid, Tuesday nights at prime time on FOX, and then Saturday nights after MadTv (1995). Around this time, I started collecting the VHS compilation tapes until I had all of the volumes (they did not contain all of the episodes of the series). Then the re-runs came back on the Sci-Fi channel, and now they are nowhere to be found on basic cable. So, I am very happy that Warner Bros. is finally releasing all the ""Tales From The Crypt"" seasons on dvd.

Another great season of HBO's ""Tales From The Crypt"". There was not a season (1-7) that was the best, each season had great episodes and even the episodes that were not great were well worth watching....

My individual episode rating system:
4 out of 4 stars is great
3 1/2 out of 4 stars is very good
3 out of 4 stars is good/enjoyable
2 1/2 out of 4 stars is okay/fair/decent/not bad
2 out of 4 stars is not very good
1 1/2 out of 4 stars is poor
1 out of 4 stars is bad

TALES FROM THE CRYPT SEASON THREE (1991)
Episode 25: Loved To Death **** Starring Andrew McCarthy, Mariel Hemmingway, David Hemmings, Kathleen Freeman; written by Joe Minion and John Mankiewicz, directed by Tom Mankiewicz / original airdate: 6/15/91
One of my 10 favorite episodes of the series! A screenwriter finds himself falling for his next door neighbor even though she won't take him seriously. When his mysterious landlord gives him a potion to make her fall in love with him, it works all too well. Andrew McCarthy is particularly good as the screenwriter, and one of his best roles. It's very similar in plot to a season 1 episode of The original Twilight Zone called ""The Chaser"", but this is a much better take on the subject of aphrodesiacs in my opinion.

Episode 26: Carrion Death *** Starring Kyle MacLaughlin, George DelHoyo; written and directed by Steven E. DeSouza / original airdate: 6/15/91
Digs is a thief on his way to Mexican border. He ends up being captured by a cop. Digs kills the officer but discovers he is up the creek without a paddle when the officer swallows the key to the cuffs that connect them. This is more of a comical cat and mouse game between a cop and killer which is fun especially the pay-off.

Episode 27: The Trap **** Starring Bruce McGill, Teri Garr, Bruno Kirby, James Tolkan, Carroll Baker, Carlos Lacamara, Michael J. Fox, Yvette Freeman, Ben Hartigan; written by Scott Alexander, directed by Michael J. Fox / original airdate: 6/15/91
This is my favorite episode of the entire series! I never tire of seeing it. Lou is a financial loser who finds a way out of his problems. He decides to fake his own death and get his wife and brother to go along with the scheme. Bruce McGill as Lou Paloma/Mr. Smith is one of the greatest TV performances, and it goes to show you how great of a character actor Bruce McGill is, some thing goes with another great character actor Bruno Kirby as the role of Lou's brother. Everyone in the cast is great ALSO (yet another) great character actor James Tolkan plays the cop. Michael J. Fox does a great job directing, as does other actors of the time who directed episodes of Tales (Schwartzenegger ""The Switch"", Tom Hanks ""None But The Lonely Heart""). It's not a scary episode by any means, but it's funny and has a great twist. The plot actually would have made a good Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode as well.

Episode 28: Abra Cadaver *** Starring Beau Bridges, Tony Goldwyn, Tom Wright, Lucinda Weist, Hugh Holub, Tina Brockrath; written by Jim Brige, directed by Stephen Hopkins / original airdate: 6/19/91
Carl and Marty are brothers who work at a hospital. Carl shows Marty his new of proving that the brain lives after the body dies. The whole thing turns out to be a prank, but the shock gives Marty a heart attack. Years later, Marty hasn't forgiven Carl and plans a deadly revenge. It reminds me of an Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode with Joseph Cotten somewhat in the idea of being able to think, see, smell, but not move at all. It drags a little, but it's a good sibling rivalry revenge story.

Episode 29: Top Billing **** Starring Jon Lovitz, Bruce Boxlietner, John Astin, Paul Bennedict, Louise Fletcher, Sandra Bernhart, Kimmy Robertson, Joe S. Cardi, Gregory Cooke, Bob Larkin, Jason Kelly; written by Miles Berkowitz, directed by Todd Holland / original airdate: 6/26/91
Another one of my top 10 episodes of the series. Barry Blye is a frustrated actor who has been rejected by every acting company because he doesn't have the right look. He will do ANYTHING to get a part. Jon Lovitz' best performance of his career, as well as funny supporting roles by John Astin, Paul Bennedict, and Louise Fletcher. The way the whole story ties together into the twist ending is pitch perfect writing and directing.

Episode 30: Dead Wait ***1/2 Starring James Remar, Whoopi Goldberg, John Rhys-Davies, Vanity, Paul Anthony Webber, Orlando Bonner, Henry Brown; written by A L Katz and Gilbert Adler, directed by Tobe Hooper / original airdate: 7/3/91
Red is a crook who is looking for a black pearl. He finds out that it's on an island belonging to an ailing millionaire. He plans to steal the millionaire's pearl with the help of the millionaire's mistress, but there are twists and turns to be found all over this particular island. The cast is good, but just as a point of accent continuity, Whoopi Goldberg's accent drifts a few times. Tobe Hooper's direction makes this somewhat predictable story a lot more entertaining.

Episode 31: The Reluctant Vampire **1/2 Starring Malcom MacDowell, Sandra Dickinson, George Wendt, Paul Gleason, Michael Berryman, Gloria Dawson; written by Terry Black, directed by Elliot Silverstein / original airdate: 7/10/91
Longtooth is a vampire working as a night watchman at a blood bank. However, when the blood seems to be running low, Longtooth returns to getting blood the old fashioned way. It's one of the comical episodes of the series (with a lot of blood as expected in vampire stories). It's a good episode, a nice parody of the vampire genre, but nowhere near one of the best or most memorable. I especially like the use of Paul Gleason as the cop though.

Episode 32: Easel Kill Ya *** Starring Tim Roth, Roya Megnot, William Atherton, Mary McKuen, Nancy Fish, Debra Mooney, Stuart Malbray, Rod Britt, Kevin Brief; written by Larry Wilson, directed by John Harrison / original airdate: 7/17/91
Jack is an artist who has a strange talent for painting pictures of corpses. Tim Roth gives a typically great performances as the tortured artist. It's a really interesting concept storywise, and the ending (though predictable) works very well.

Episode 33: Undertaking Parlor *** Starring John Glover, Graham Jarvis, Jason Marsden, Aron Eisenberg, Scott Fults, Jonathan Ke Quen; written by Ron Finley, directed by Michael Thau / original airdate: 7/24/91
Four boys who have a talent for video taping uncover strange things at an undertaker's parlor. Soon revenge comes filmming when one of the boys' father becomes a victim. I like the comrodery of the kids and the tension of the situation. John Glover is always a very convincing sinister villan.

Episode 34: Mourin' Mess **1/2 Starring Steven Webber, Rita Wilson, Nick Angotti, Frank Kopyc, Ally Walker, Vincent Schavelli, Stack Pierce, Gary Pagett; written and directed by Manny Coto / original airdate: 7/31/91
A regretful reporter is investigating murders of homeless people. He meets up with the man who is the prime suspect in the murders, but when he fails to deliver a story, his boss fires him. He still can't help but seek out the truth. It's a little too cornball for me with the ""twist"". I like the reporter aspect of it, desperation for the story like the character in another Season 3 episode ""Deadline"". But as with that story, it just doesn't really go anywhere unexpected. I like the look of the ghouls though - scary for it's time.

Episode 35: Split Second *** Starring Michelle Johnson, Brion James, Billy Wirth, Dan Martin, Alan Palo, Tony Pierce; written by Richard Christian Matheson, directed by Russell Malcahy / original airdate: 8/7/91
Dixon is a lumberjack who marries a sexy, young barmaid named Liz. Soon after, he turns from a sweet man to a jealous maniac when the guys who work for him find her attractive. One day Ted, a new lumberjack, comes to town, and Liz finally finds some excitment. A great revenge tale, and I especially like the ending.

Episode 36: Deadline *1/2 Starring Richard Jordon, Marg Helenberger, Richard Herd, Jon Polito, John Capodice, Judy Jean Burns, Rutanya Alda; written by Mae Woods and Walter Hill, directed by Walter Hill / original airdate: 8/14/91
Charlie MacKenzie is an out of work reporter who wants his life back. One night while at his favorite bar hang out, Charlie meets a woman who seems to turn his life around. He gets his job back, but his boss only agrees to hire him if he can bring in a murder story soon. It's completely predictable and drags as the story goes. I like the desperate for a story reporter aspect, but the ""twists"" aren't really twists at all since it's implied in your face from the beginning.

Episode 37: Spoiled ***1/2 Starring Faye Grant, Anthony LaPaglia, Alan Rachins, Anita Morris, Annabelle Gurwitch, Tristan Rogers, Parker Kane; written by Connie Johnson and Doug Ronning, directed by Andy Wolk / original airdate: 8/21/91
Janet is a soap opera loving woman neglected by her surgeon husband who is too busy working to satisfy her needs. One day, she decides to get cable, and she falls head over heals for the cable installer. One of the best funny episodes. It's a great parody on soap operas and desperate, bored housewives who thrive on them. I always liked the line said by Anthony LaPaglia ""Hi, I'm Able... with the cable.""

Episode 38: Yellow ***1/2 Starring Kirk Douglas, Eric Douglas, Dan Aykroyd, Lance Henricksen, Steve Boyum, Anthony Gallo, Charles Picerni, Dominick Morra; written by Jim Thomas, John Thomas, A L Katz and Gilbert Adler, directed by Robert Zemekis / original airdate: 8/28/91
In WWI, the general is ashamed when he learns that the rumor of the Lieutenant (his son) being a coward is true. He offers his son a way out of the army if he can take part in one last mission. This is a performance showcase in that every performance seems so good that it should be in an actualy WWI film. The story and direction are first rate and make what would be a slow story very entertaining.

Season Three of ""Tales From The Crypt"" is another great edition to one of television's best series.",1142208000,,10768,4.7522739432851795
2479992,5,B000E1MXWS,"The Tales From the Crypt series was some of the best television airing back in the final year of the 80s and into the early 90s. Deliberately over the top. Deliberately funny. Deliberately campy at times. Deliberately scary. Deliberately gory. Deliberately one of HBO's finest creations.

The episodes are all based on EC Comics of old...mostly from the self titled Tales From the Crypt, Haunt of Fear and Vault of Horror comic books. But I'd guess that 90% of you reading this already know that, and you're here as I am delighted that it is finally out on DVD.

For those that have not seen these wonderfully entertaining episodes of dark humor and horror...if you're into the genre this collection and any of the other HBO seasonal Tales From the Crypt releases are for you.

Season 3 contains one of the most memorable episodes with Abra Cadaver: Carl (Tony Goldwyn) and Marty (Beau Bridges) are brothers who work at a hospital. When Carl plays a prank on Marty pretending to have a new way of proving that the brain lives after the body dies, the scare delivered in the prank literally gives Marty a heart attack. Years later Marty hasn't forgiven Carl and Marty ""executes"" a prank of his own. Deadly fun!!!

You'll also get:
-""Deadline"": Never commit murder with a CSI in the cast (Marg Helgenberger).
-""The Trap"": Michael J Fox directed tale of a guy that fakes his own death...to die for!
-""Loved To Death"": Love potion #9!
-""Carrion Death"": More like Carrying Death...cuffed to a corpse!
-""Top Billing"": Star studded episode about a frustrated hacktor who will do anything to get a part.
-""Dead Wait"": Who do that voodoo? Maybe Whoopi Goldberg?
-""The Reluctant Vampire"": If you're going to mess with a vampire, don't be long in the tooth!
-""Easel Kill Ya"": Death defying portraits?
-""Undertaking Parlor"": Video taping the undertaker...lights, camera, hacktion!
-""Mournin' Mess"": Boils better watch out for the Ghouls!
-""Split Second"": Lumberjack gets jealous and gives the other guy the axe!
-""Spoiled"": Soap opera from hell!
-""Yellow"": Another star studded episode where Kirk Douglas puts his real life cowardly son into battle and ultimately the firing squad.

Hit the Buy button. Easel kill ya!",1137024000,38,2205,4.948648648648649
2479993,5,B000E1MXWS,"March 21 can't come soon enough for me.  I'm salivating in anticipation of Season Three's release.

Truly, Tales from the Crypt was one of the best television series in the history of the medium.  And Season Three includes some of the finest episodes in the series' run...though the same can be said of every season.  Much like The Twilight Zone or Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Tales from the Crypt never lost steam during the course of its run.

I'm just thankful that they finally got around to releasing seasons on DVD.  It seemed for the longest time that even the WORST television shows were getting season-by-season releases...and yet, Tales from the Crypt releases were confined to a few ""collections.""  Each contained a paltry three episodes, in no discernable order.  I complained about this for YEARS...before they finally showed the good sense to give this landmark cult series the treatment it deserves.

Seasons One and Two did not disappoint.  Having seen virtually every episode (missed one or two from the 7th and final season), watching those DVDs really brought back memories.  And it's good to see them all in order...or a close approximation, anyway, as the correct order of the first three episodes is often debated.  I'm sure that Season Three will not disappoint, either.  I, for one, can't wait to have Abra Cadaver, The Reluctant Vampire, and all of the other great Season Three episodes on DVD.

Old Man Winter had best hurry up and vamoose, if he knows what's good for him...I'm grinding my hatchet as we speak.",1136937600,3,1536,4.903100775193798
