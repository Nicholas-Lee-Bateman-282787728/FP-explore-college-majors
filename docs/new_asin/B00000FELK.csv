1214555,3,B00000FELK,"When I first started watching this documentary, I found it so obnoxious and unrelievedly dull that I was discouraged from continuing. Here were a bunch of know-it-all scholars, all of whom seemed to slant to the left and viewed Christianity as an engaging myth and Christ as a sort of socio-political hero. (Just look at the title, whereby it implies that Jesus was just a village carpenter who was deified after his death.) But as I progressed to the later parts, including the one about the composition of the Gospels, my interest was captured and I learned quite a bit. Yes, this film is strictly from a historical/anthropological perspective, and I don't think any religious viewpoints are represented. But even a believing Christian of any denomination (I happen to be a Catholic) could learn something from this video. But I stand firm on the absolute DULLNESS and monotony of the background music.

Some of the comments made on this page distress me, and I would like to react to a few of them.

To the reviewer who commented on how the gospels reveal that ""loving God there is no need of a church or clergymen"". I would respond to him that one can read anything into the gospel that one wants to, and one can twist it to conform to one's own pre-existing ideology. It is in age-old church tradition, and not in new-fangled re-interpretations of Christianity, that the truth is to be found.

To Ian Noble, who referred to those of us who object to certain elements of this film as ""religious facatics"": I would caution him against casually bandying about such a strong epithet. Those who hold to traditional beliefs regarding Jesus Christ are not ""religious fanatics"".

Fundamentalists and those who ""take the Bible literally"" are not the only ones who will object to certain elements of this film. I am a Catholic, and I disagreed with it in points. And to Riad from Sacramento: Why is it that traditional church beliefs about Jesus are ""filtered interpretations"" of the Bible, whereas secular interpretations are not?

Finally, I wish people would stop thinking that there is some ""institutionalized Christian church"". There is no such one church. There are different churches - the Catholic, the Orthodox, and the Protestant denominations.",1094860800,14,2249,4.907894736842105
1214556,4,B00000FELK,"I thoroughly enjoyed this program and highly recommend it. I have watched this video no less than a dozen times. It is comprehensive and tells the story of how Christianity began and evolved. It is interesting to note that many of the ""experts"" are not Clergy. They are College Professors and researchers who have a unique insight into the factual and researched evidence that provide the basis for  the Christian faith. This program presents facts in a perspective that coincides with the mindset in the times in which they took place. We figuratively travel back in time with some outstanding commentary and perspective from a bevy of well spoken, factually prepared intellectuals who not only tell the story itself but give perspective on the story tellers, what their interests were and also what was historically going on at that time. I found the perspectives given stregnthened my faith. I found this program devoid of an agenda and solely interested in telling a profound story that has transcended the ages. I recommend this program to anyone who is on a faith journed to understanding the roots of their faith. It will provide for compelling viewing.",1078617600,21,1160,4.979381443298969
1214557,5,B00000FELK,"This is a truthful and enlightening video. Seemingly all people proclaiming to be Christians can learn so much from even ""fundamentalist"" if they open their mind to the historical research instead of only listening to their Church and their filtered interpretations of the bible.  What other evidence is out there about Jesus besides what the bible tells us?  Who really wrote the bible and why do the scholars think as they do.  This video shares some of these insights and presents them in an easily understandable form.  I wish there were more Jesus videos done in this type of presentation.",1069632000,15,594,4.91
1214558,2,B00000FELK,"I bought this video set believing that I would get a good, non-biased historical documentary on the original Christians.  Instead, I was surprised to see the Jesus Seminar scholars so prominently featured bringing ""new evidence"".  Atheists will love this portrayal of Jesus because it is based on a group whose ""research"" begins with the premise that the Bible is largely myth.  All of the commentary is colored in this direction which makes for a completely lopsided presentation.  I'm shocked that absolutely no effort was made to bring on any New Testament/Early Christian scholars that would provide a kind of foil or balanced point of view.  The info in this video represents a miniscule (<5%) viewpoint in the Christian study and has been widely discredited -- even by Atheist scholars.  If you're gonna see this stuff, at least read something like Lee Strobel's ""A Case For Christ"" for a complete picture.",992304000,25,912,5.046666666666667
1214559,5,B00000FELK,"An excellent series on the evolution of the Jesus myth.  I am struck by the manner in which the charismatic/apocalyptic strain that animated the Jesus movement continues to energize a great deal of contemporary religious enthusiasm.  I find myself in agreement with the critical perspectives presented and see them as much more helpful in the development of adult faith than the Sunday school and catechism fictions most Christians are offered as children and, sadly, as adults.  I have used this series, and the other Frontline series on ""Apocalypse,"" with adult study groups in local churches and the participants found them to be liberating.  I recommend it for those engaged in the essential work of helping our religions grow up.",978652800,16,734,5.142857142857143
1214560,5,B00000FELK,"As a scholar of the new testament, I enjoyed greatly the PBS series ""From Jesus to Christ: The first Christians.""  This is the epic tale of how a povern stricken son of a carpenter became the leading figure in both secular and religious histories.  It recounts in brilliant colors how we transformed Jesus the man, into Jesus the God.  This is definitely for those who are seeking the Historical Jesus, not the religious Jesus.  The man that was the so-called ""Christ"" has long been an enduring subject for such pieces, but few if any have put into words this man so brilliantly.  From Jesus to Christ explains everything; from how the New Testament was born, why it contradicts itself so injuriously, and finnaly the gripping tale of how it became the world's #1 religion.  With out a doubt, this is a worthwhile, and timeless work.",977788800,18,833,4.710344827586207

1214562,5,B00000FELK,"I enjoyed the video from start to finish.  It does a great job of  describing the events that led to the formation of the Christian religion from a fragment of the Jewish faith.  I especially enjoyed the fact that it  uses the testimony of several theological scholars from distinguished  schools such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Duke, among others.  This  video helped to explain a lot of the questions I had regarding the  formation of the faith.  It is a must see for anyone curious of the roots  and struggles of early Christianity.",952905600,47,541,4.720430107526882

The series is a thoughtful, well-researched presentation with  spectacular cinemegraphic transitions between interview-style narratives  and on-location film. There is so much information imbedded in the film  that it takes several viewings to get it all out. Further, there is a  website which contains hundreds of pages of support material.

1214627,5,B00000FELK,"I just finished watching this on PBS, as I think they re-broadcast it around this time every year. This is a documentary that simply looks at how the Christian faith began. It's not meant to try to convert anybody, or make a judgment on the deity of Jesus the man. I thought their approach was pretty even-handed. Some of the more interesting parts included the look at the various sects of Christianity during those days, and the importance of the Dead Sea scrolls. It's a fascinating look at how Christianity, which at one point was outlawed by the Romans, eventually began their state religion. When I review an item, I always look at the negative comments first. Most here seem to think this program was some kind of attack on Christianity or the Bible. It's nothing of the sort. It simply explains how the religion started and spread.",1420243200,3,839,4.675675675675675

1214632,5,B00000FELK,"""From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians"" is an excellent, excellent documentary.  Hosted by intellectual and notable scholars, who are at the top of their field in study, this documentary leaves no stone unturned.  They give a very honest, practical, and unbiased study and look at the life of Jesus Christ from his birth to his death, through the rise of Christianity - through the synoptic gospels, through the split between Christianity and Judaism.  I bought a similar documentary called ""In Search of Jesus"" and I noted in my review of that video that if one is more of a theologian, biblical scholar/student, studying the New Testament and the life and times of the historical Jesus, then one will throughly enjoy it and find it very informative and enlightening and truthful, well documented and researched.  The same holds true for this one ""From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians"".  Theologians will love it.  Theologians will find it well documented, well researched, honest and truthful and easy to understand. It is not explained in high academic language where one will not know what the professors are saying.  However, if one is a fundamentalist, then there will be problems.  The fundamentalists, evangelists, etc will not like it, and most likely will not buy it, or if they do, they probably won't continue watching it.

The students like it too.  It presents a more or less consensus view, which means that Catholics, most Orthodox,  and main street Protestants will find much to like.  Evangelicals - maybe yes, maybe no.

The PBS website still has their excellent site on the early Christians available.  You can find maps, primary sources and even a teacher's resource guide with maps, activities, questions, etc.  Just checked.  You can actually watch the whole thing online now.

I learned many things about the Gospel writers, the early years of the development of Christianity, the wars in Jerusalem with the Romans, and the eventual split between Jews and Christians.  I thought that the experts were very human in their evaluations, sometimes witty, down to earth, and very knowledgeable of the subject matter.  They offered many valuable insights that you would not get unless you went to one of their college courses.

1214662,2,B00000FELK,"Slow moving. Narrator's voice was so sonorous I wanted to be able to put him on fast speed.

""You've seen him lauded. You've heard him worshipped. Now it's our turn."" (It was something like that anyway; I forgot to write down that part.) Making it clear from the outset that this series is a debunking of Christianity, and as if Christianity has never before had any detractors.

I'm puzzled as to why the researchers are so dismissive of the gospel accounts. ""Jesus was probably born in Galilee rather than Bethlehem,"" but no reason is given for contradicting the Biblical account.

They say, ""Jesus was probably of a higher socioeconomic class than the Bible says,"" but give no reason for their assumptions other than that Sephoris was a wealthy city. Nazareth, 5 miles away from Sephoris, where the Bible says Jesus lived, would certainly have its lower-class carpenters. There is no reason, no evidence, to disagree with this except wanting to argue with the Biblical account. ""He likely went to Sephoris to earn his living."" But surely there were carpenters in Nazareth. ""Jesus was trilingual,"" someone said, not even adding ""probably."" Well, he might have been. But to state it uncategorically is disingenuous.

""Jesus was John's disciple."" No evidence for this. Our sonorous narrator said that ""Jesus was the one prophesied by John"" was just a ""construct"" by the early church. Again, no evidence offered. Just stated as if it were empirical fact.

""It's unclear how He got into trouble."" Really? The gospels make it very clear how he got into trouble. Why are we simply ignoring everything they say about this? ""Maybe His act of cleansing the temple was because it was 'too Roman,' and in that case it looks like an act of political subversion."" But the fact is that it was the **Pharisees,** not the Romans, that cause the trouble for Jesus. These narrators don't even mention that glaring fact.

""There is no doubt in my mind that the ones responsible for the execution of Jesus were the Romans."" What a weird thing to say. A man would say that only if he were trying to refute an alternate argument. But they haven't offered an alternate argument. Of course, the alternate argument is that it was the Pharisees and the other leaders of the Jews who wanted him silenced, because he was usurping their perceived authority and drawing away their following. Why would this information be so studiously avoided? I couldn't even figure it out.

For someone who doesn't know the New Testament, I think it may be interesting. For someone who knows the New Testament (in my opinion, anyway), it's just frustrating.",1369872000,5,2615,4.8629213483146065

This confirms Josephus' accounts as to what immediately happened to any person claiming to perform miracles in Roman Judea.

Between 44 and 46 CE, one Theudas caused some consternation with what may have been a claim to be the Messiah:

""It came to pass, while Fadus was procurator of Judea, that a certain charlatan, whose name was Theudas, persuaded a great part of the people to take their effects with them, and follow him to the river Jordan; for he told them he was a prophet, and that he would, by his own command, divide the river, and afford them an easy passage over it. Many were deluded by his words. However, Fadus did not permit them to make any advantage of his wild attempt, but sent a troop of horsemen out against them. After falling upon them unexpectedly, they slew many of them, and took many of them alive. They also took Theudas alive, cut off his head, and carried it to Jerusalem."" -- [(Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 20.97-98]

and

The Roman governor Festus, who was -according to recent research- in office from 58 until 60 CE, was confronted with another rebel:

""Festus sent forces, both horsemen and footmen, to fall upon those that had been seduced by a certain impostor, who promised them deliverance and freedom from the miseries they were under, if they would but follow him as far as the wilderness. Accordingly, those forces that were sent destroyed both him that had deluded them, and those that were his followers also."" -- [Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 20.188]

Yet the Bible scholars interviewed for this PBS Frontline program fail to explain why Pontius Pilate failed for three years to swiftly deal with the threat of Jesus when if it had been anyone other than Jesus, that threat to the Roman Peace would have been immediately  dealt with three years earlier (see first embedded comment, and in the link provided fast-forward to 37:45 minutes in Part I of ""From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians"" for another Biblical scholar's account of how Roman governors in Judea IMMEDIATELY reacted towards PEACEFUL ""Messiahs"")!

The PBS Frontline program also fails to explain the similar three-year inaction of the religious leaders in Jerusalem (and Galilee/Perea) to execute Jesus for blasphemy under the Law of Moses, AND why for the next 37 years (before the fall of Jerusalem) Roman and Jewish religious authorities are still refusing to put to death Jesus' disciples and all Jesus Sect members (excepting for three fluke cases: Saint Stephen and the two disciples named James. In the case of Saint Stephen, he was pointed out to the religious leaders of Jerusalem by foreign Jews from what is today Turkey, who were in town for Passover. The religious leaders of Jerusalem were pressed into the arrest and stoning of Stephen by ignorant foreign Jews, otherwise Stephen would not have been arrested in the first place. See first embedded comment to this review for how the two disciples named James died.)!

In fact, in Acts 4:4 and Acts 5:18, the disciples were arrested twice by the Sanhedrin before the death of Stephen. Inexplicably, in both instances the Sanhedrin merely warned the disciples to keep their tongues quiet about Jesus, then released them!

Note too that during Paul's three-year ""persecution"" of Jesus Sect members (33-36 AD), no real persecution is actually taking place in Judea (or Galilee for that matter, since the disciples are moving freely from Galilee to Judea and back), which must of exasperated the newly minted Pharisee. Obviously perplexed, and attempting to ""impress"" his superiors, Paul asks (see Acts 9) for a persecution mission to the gentile city of Damascus.

Now the gentile rulers of the ""independent"" city states of Decapolis (where Damascus is located) didn't allow for the extradition of Jesus Sect subjects to Judea for stoning, so Paul is being sent on a wild goose mission and doesn't know it! In fact, it was on one such wild goose mission (to Damascus) that Jesus had enough with Paul and threw him off his high horse of ignorance. Jesus says to Paul, ""Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"" Note, Jesus only says this to the obstinate Paul. Jesus doesn't have to tell anyone else to cease persecuting his flock because no one else in Judea is! I bet you never thought about that?

In fact, when Paul and Peter, and their disciples, are roaming the eastern Roman Empire (outside of the Levant) they too are attracting large crowds, and what are the Roman governors doing about this sedition? Nothing. As with the ten Roman governors of Judea, they too refuse to immediately arrest Paul and Peter (and their disciples), then adjudicating and executing them for sedition.

The Christian interpretation followed for 2,000 years on this subject is in such egregious and obvious error, that it is a true miracle that it wasn't debunked until now! Roman authorities and Jewish authorities KNEW Jesus was the Messiah, otherwise actions against Jesus (and after Jesus' death and resurrection) would have been immediate and violent for all Jesus Sect members involved.

In fact, John 11 (45-55) implicitly tells us that long before Passion Week the priestly leadership of Jerusalem knew Jesus was the Messiah (how Christian theists missed this eye-opening passage from John is beyond explanation!):

""45 Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him. 46 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 47 Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin.

""What are we accomplishing?"" they asked. ""Here is this man performing many signs. 48 If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation.""

49 Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, ""You know nothing at all! 50 You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.""

51 He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, 52 and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. 53 So from that day on they plotted to take his life.

54 Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea. Instead he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.

55 When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover. 56 They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another, ""What do you think? Isn't he coming to the festival at all?"" 57 But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him.""

See where the High Priest Caiaphas tells his underlings, ""You know nothing at all!""? Caiaphas knows who Jesus is because the intelligence network he has within the Jesus camp (Rome and Herod Antipas also have their intelligence networks within the Jesus Sect camp, and the agents are reporting that Jesus is unlike the other deluded ""prophets"" they've dealt with before, that Jesus is really bringing back to life persons known to be dead and performing other miracles) is affirming that Jesus is the Messiah.

Note the inexplicable description Caiaphas makes about Jesus: ""...he [Caiaphas] prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, 52 and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. 53 So from that day on they plotted to take his life.""

Now, if Jesus was merely considered by Caiaphas to be a deluded blaspheming ""Prophet"", then when Jesus died, that was it. Jesus would be forgotten. But notice, Caiaphas says about what Jesus' death would bring about, ""...that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, 52 and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one."" A deluded Jesus would die for blasphemy, not ""die for the Jewish nation"" as Caiaphas says.

In other words, Caiaphas not only knew who Jesus was, he knew what Jesus was up to otherwise he would never have made such a blasphemous comment himself about Jesus' death ""bring[ing] them [the Jewish nation] together and make them one."" However, note that Caiaphas is under the misapprehension of Jesus' true mission, which is to die for man's sins. Caiaphas is still operating under the original Covenant God made with man (with the Jews), so he thinks Jesus's death will reconstitute an independent Israel.

Now, the next week was Passion Sunday. What happened on Passion Sunday? Jesus arrives in Jerusalem with a large mob. This action was a direct attack on Roman rule in Judea, which put into motion Caiaphas' and Jesus' plan that Jesus must die.

Also note Caiaphas' worries about Rome. Caiaphas would have been counting his blessings that Prefect Pontius Pilate hadn't already long ago arrested and executed Jesus for ""rebellion"". Caiaphas must have known though that it wasn't just three-years good luck that kept Pilate from doing his duty and arrest and execute Jesus, but that Pilate too obviously knew who Jesus was. But how long could Caiaphas expect Pilate to avert his eyes from Jesus' provocations? Caiaphas had to act, and the Passion Sunday procession was the obvious sign from God that it was time for Jesus to die.

This passage from John's Gospel proves that Jewish religious authorities in Judea and Galilee (especially the high ranking authorities) knew who Jesus was.

Another proof that the religious leaders of Jerusalem knew Jesus was the Messiah, and had no intention themselves of killing Him, was their failure to also arrest His disciples at Gethsemane. In order to operationalize Jesus' mission (as the religious leaders saw it) on Eathh, only the arrest of Jesus was necessary; His death would come at the hands of Pilate, not them, as proved by the three extralegal ""trials"" to come, proceedings that ruled out any form of punishment under the Law of Moses (Under the Law of Moses, trials could only take place later, during daylight hours.).

This explains why John the Baptist refused to ministry in Judea, and ministry only in Antipas' jurisdiction of Perea (in order to question John, the Elders of Jerusalem had to travel to Perea to do so, because John refused to cross the Jordan River and enter Roman territory). Because John (although born in Judea) knew what would happen to him once he crossed the border into Judea with his disciples and followers: Arrest and execution by Roman authorities, yet Jesus was allowed by Pilate to come and go as He pleased!

Since John the Baptist was preaching the Old Testament in Perea (Antipas' jurisdiction), there was no cause to arrest John for blasphemy and leading Jews astray. John was only arrested and executed by Antipas when John specifically railed against Antipas' marriage to his dead brother's wife, who was also his niece.

The Gospels' narrative is so ludicrous, so obviously a forged narrative, a badly forged infantile narrative, that the only way it would have been accepted as true by anyone at the time of its release is if the narrative was known to be true already!

The Gospels' narrative was known true, otherwise there would be no Christianity today.

Let's perform a modern times analogy with the Roman Empire using a post World War II scenario where Germany won the war and rules the Western hemisphere:

Germany has won World War II, and German governors rule the Western hemisphere, the Waffen SS being the equivalent of the Roman centurion.

Though the war is over resistance to German occupation continues, including the French Resistance.

Now, in France the leader of the French resistance and twelve lieutenants move openly about France for three years preaching rebellion and the German governor does nothing. After three years the leader of the French Resistance enters Paris with his twelve lieutenants and a mob and again the German governor refuses to arrest the thirteen, and roundup the mob.

Finally the French mayor of Paris arrests the leader, but not the twelve lieutenants, and hands the leader over to the German governor who still doesn't want to execute the leader, but does after left no other option.

Now, after the leader of the French Resistance is dead not only are the twelve lieutenants allowed to live under that particular German governor's remaining term of office, but aren't touched by the next nine German governors to take office. In fact, the French Resistance is increasing by tens of thousands each year and German authorities simply sit by and watch.

Now when one of those French Resistance travels outside France to spread the word of the rebellion in France, he is believed because everyone KNOWS the otherwise ludicrous story he's telling is true. END OF ANALOGY.

Now you can appreciate the reactions of any Roman subject when confronted with the Gospels' narrative of how Jesus and His disciples were treated by both Jewish and Roman authorities: Unbelievable, unless known to be true!

You see, the New Testament narrative also has the next 9 Roman governors after Pilate also inexplicably refusing to put to death Jesus' disciples who are still performing ""rebellious"" miracles (others too besides the disciples are performing ""rebellious"" miracles) and attracting large crowds. The Jewish leaders are doing the same...actually protecting the Jesus Sect, where the sect is now tens of thousands strong in Jerusalem alone by the time of Paul's third trip back to the city in 61 AD (the original Greek texts says ""ten of thousands"", not ""thousands"". New Testament translators couldn't believe the high number, so they removed a zero!).

The Gospels' failure to account for the inexplicable behaviors on the part of officials allowing Jesus to live three years beyond which others would have met their deaths, and equally inexplicable failure to destroy the Jesus Sect for the next thirty-seven years before the fall of Jerusalem, is understandable when one observes the precarious situation the new Jesus Sect found itself in. To openly proclaim in the Gospels and other books that found their way into the New Testament that Jewish (and Roman) officials knew Jesus was the Messiah would have forced those officials into actually persecuting the Jesus Sect in order to deflect such claims made in Jesus Sect literature. In other words, for forty years there was a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy towards the Jesus Sect!

In closing, I would like to clear an issue that has perplexed New Testament scholarship for close to a century now, and that is the Testimonium Flavianum, the name given to the passage found in Book 18, Chapter 3, 3 of the ""Antiquities of the Jews"", in which the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus describes the condemnation and crucifixion of Jesus at the hands of the Roman authorities, specifically referring to Jesus with the following, ""He was [the] Christ.""

It is this reference to Jesus as being ""the Christ"" (Messiah) that troubles New Testament scholars since we are told by the early Church Father Origen in his Commentary on Matthew (Book X, Chapter 17) that Josephus did not accept Jesus as Christ. Well, as my research above proves, Jewish officials in Judea and elsewhere did indeed believe Jesus to be the Messiah, though for political reasons kept that belief close to themselves.

Josephus' family was wealthy, and his his father came from the priestly order of the Jehoiarib, which was the first of the 24 orders of priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. Therefore, Josephus would have been well aware of the intelligence reports the Sanhedrin received concerning Jesus' true nature, hence there would be no conflict with Josephus not only accepting Jesus as the Messiah, but knowing Jesus was the Messiah.

1214680,4,B00000FELK,"For your information: The DVD version of the PBS Frontline series ""From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians"" is an abridgment of the original four-part presentation. My conservative estimate is that over 30 minutes has been removed.

The full, unabridged, program is available online in two parts on the PBS Frontline ""From Jesus to Christ"" website.

Although I believe this program to be excellent, it is not my intention here to review it. Other reviewers have done a fair job of explaining that this is an ""historical scholarship"" presentation which requires the viewer to exercise their critical thinking skills interpreting what is being said.

Having frequently watched VHS tapes I made of the show from when it was originally broadcast back in the late 1990s, I was aware that there was something missing from the DVD I had recently purchased. I went to the transcript on the show's website and confirmed that material was removed from each of the four episodes. I then proceeded to search the online video and discovered that the portions edited from the DVD were still part of the online video content.

I have no idea why this content has been removed. Ironically, the entire value of this series comes from it's spoken words which are presented against background music and images of first century artifacts and ruins. If the intent was to shorten things in order to fit the material onto a single DVD, I cannot understand why the ""meat"" of the program was removed while leaving long passages of music playing over montages of artifacts and scenery.

I just thought you should know...

And then what does it say: Jesus was a freak of his time. But somehow, From Jesus to Christ is really nothing about Christianity but everything about the Eternal Light of Zionism, as if Israel were some sort of Eternal Temple. Many Jewish scholars and Rabbis would have a Hell of a hard time buying this foundational sub-text of secular Zionism. But then PBS is a lot of very high paid TV guys for a channel that few view. And so, wherever the money comes from, PBS will bend ""truth.""

So, the $$$ source is obvious in all he declarative bending of the Jewish and Christian faiths and the raping and mauling of history. What counts is that with each project, showmen without an audience get money as if a success; for this all they must do is twist reality to fit the highest bidder. Of course, since Christian Fundamentalism is a career and a cash cow rather than the following of Christ, it's not hard to fins ""scholars"" to DECLARE with forked tongue the will of the big spenders. In the end, everyone makes out like real bandits...everyone that is but truth. So remember Amazon fans, SCHOLARSHIP is truth-seeking, not in convenient declarative talking heads videos, but in a constant search with an open mind....sometimes discovering that knowledge is most often: QUANTITY INSUFFICIENT. But, there's enough available to see through this a z pretension that Judaism is an everlasting rock. making Israel a fait accompli, and Judaism and Christianity with all the two millennial debates as puff for we have talking holy heads to tell us: THIS IS IT.

People acting as six year olds in elementary school having the classic playground argument on whether Santa Claus exists or not.  No, I'm not an atheist.  I took the long way around to discovering that I'm a believer in God, and Jesus Christ.  But I didn't just automatically adopt what others told me to think.  My search began sometime ago with an almost agnostic doubt, and although there is no absolute proof that Christ was anything more than a human being, and possibly historical figure, I have found my faith and will live with it, for that is what faith is...believing without proof.

That being said, I found From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians to be a very good look into the ""historicity"" of Jesus and his original followers and how the early movement developed into a worldwide following.  Because there is so little true historical documentation besides sacred scripture, this program like so many similar efforts must make some conjecture based on the few historical things We Know occurred and are verifiable from other historical accounts (mostly from the Romans and Jews of the period).  The New Testament in and of itself has to be called into some doubt as far as an historical source because it simply contradicts itself at times.  Locations, events and who was there differ greatly from Mark to Matthew to Luke.  That is simple fact. Read your Bible. This program addresses that issue without demeaning the whole, I believe.

The problem is, there are so many different belief systems today within modern Christianity, it would be impossible to get everybody on the same page as to what went down 2,000 years ago.  We can't agree on what happened last week.  And people have their own Santa belief system so when someone comes along and throws in cold hard facts, the egg nog goes a little off.

I highly recommend this PBS documentary to anyone who is searching for some truth mixed with their reindeer. I'm not saying the show has it all right.  It doesn't convey or profess that it does.  But it offers some very good insight as to what may have happened and how difficult the culture of the time really (historically) was, and not how 19th and 20th century artists have painted it for us as children.

While shining some light in dark corners, the beauty of From Jesus to Christ is that it portrays the mystery of the whole thing as just that:  Beautiful and mysterious.  That an empire that executed the leader of an insignificant band of his followers could eventually be dominated by their philosophy is at least an uncanny irony.  That God ""works in mysterious ways"", is an absolute truth.

Watch and enjoy (and maybe learn), and don't let it ruin your day if you don't agree with everything portrayed within.  Your preacher doesn't agree with everything your friend's preacher says, so chill.  :)",1285459200,22,2947,4.735294117647059

This doesn't mean I don't believe in God--I do.  That is, I believe in an intelligent and loving Source of Life.  My belief, however, doesn't need a story book to back it up, since it comes from within myself.

I'm sure that conservative Christians would claim I can't rely on my inner sense, since I'm ""fallen,"" and everything about my own perceptions is suspect.  Yet, when they've attempted to evangelize me, they aim directly at my own perceptions to both ""convict"" me and convert me.  For after all, what else could they aim at?

The other irony: they always try to prove to me that Christianity is ""true.""  At which point, I immediately inform them that they're going to hell.  When they ask why, I reply that, according to their own beliefs, salvation is by faith alone, and you can only have faith in something that you can't know is true, otherwise it wouldn't be ""faith.""  Thus, by their trying to prove Christianity is true, they're going beyond faith alone, and so they're damned.

Somehow, in all of their talk, I sense that the original Jesus is missing, replaced by a blond, blue-eyed ""Christ.""  That's why this PBS series was so informative to me.  As for its being ""unbalanced"" (i.e., by leaving out conservative Christian input), sorry, an apologist is not an unbiased scholar.  From what I can tell by their credentials, most of the scholars represented here are practicing Christians.

1214693,4,B00000FELK,"""From Jesus to Christ"" is a four hour DVD about Jesus, His Disciples, and the Christians of early Christianity.  It is written and produced by PBS and focuses upon what scholars have learned through exhaustive research about the life and times of early Christianity.

This DVD is divided into four parts, each about hour in length.  Each part presents actual photographs of the extant sites mentioned in scriptures, such as Jerusalem, Corinth, the Dead Sea, and Rome.  Each part presents interviews with leading scholars who specialize in the historical period and scriptures, such as professors from Ivy League Universities, and Theological Schools.

Part I Presents the culture and times of Jesus, the coming of Jesus, the characteristics of Jesus and  His place in History.  It details the Temple and presents computer generated images of how it would have been in the time of Jesus.

Part II  Includes Paul's travels (especially Corinth and Ephessis), beliefs in the Second Coming,  Pentecost, the mission of Disciples, and defining the Church.

Part III  Discussed events after the Resurrection of Jesus, the Jewish revolt, the battle of Messada, and the destruction of Jerusalem.  In addition the scholars discuss the writing of the Gospels, presents the essence of each Gospel, compares the Gospels, and examines the separate paths taken by Jews and Christians.

Part IV - Presents Paganism and its beliefs within the societies of ancient civilization, it  especially discusses the prominence of ""religion"" in Roman life and the challenge that Christianity gave to its tenets.  We view great images and details of Rome and its buildings and institutions.  It shows the Coptic scrolls and its books.

Much of the emphasis of the DVD is upon the everyday people of the time and the historical and archeological data related to that period.  As such it presents no new theological insights but does spark the biblical story to life and stimulate the readers imagination and understanding of the life and times of Jesus and the early Christian church.

The conclusions appeared to be based on pure subjectivity.  I found myself over and over again asking ""What leads you to that conclusion?""  For instance, one speaker said ""Most historian think Jesus was born and raised in Nazareth.""  Not one piece of evidence was given to lead to a conclusion that Jesus was born in Nazareth, unless it was the fact that he was raised in Nazareth. Must one conclude Jesus was born in Nazareth, contrary to all the historical writings, simply because he was raised in Nazareth?  One speaker said the early church constructed language that John predicted the coming of Jesus so that the church could explain the relationship between the two.  The speaker gives no historical, archeological or linguistic evidence to support this conclusion.  One of the speakers inferred that the resurrection was added after the Gospel of Mark was written because the earliest version of Mark does not have any resurrection appearances.  But the earliest version of Mark ends with the empty tomb, which would appear to imply a resurrection - especially in light of Mark 8:31 where the resurrection is expressly foretold.  Additionally the Apostle Paul wrote about the resurrecion prior to the writing of Mark.  So what leads the speakers in this film to reach a conclusion that the resurrection was added by later writers?

1214695,1,B00000FELK,"The very first statements of this video is biased and bends facts.

This statement is that the people who recorded the events of Christ's ministry on earth did not live during the time of Jesus therefore implying that the record cannot be accurate.

Not true . . . many historians support the notion that the story of Christ's ministry were told either by people who witnessed the evens or recorded by people who interviewed people who witnessed them.

The intent of this is to eliminate the Bible as a historical source. This may be success if the audience is not acquainted with the historical support for the bible, which if anyone cares to read about it, the Bible is the most reliable historical source ever found for events at this time period.

Things get worse as this film goes on and I won't belabour the egregious errors committed.

This film will be a comfort to those who want to ascribe to the current liberal view of Christ and Christianity.

To those who have considered the evidence in a rational manner this video will be an affront to their intelligence. It is short on fact, and very long on unfounded speculation.

This confirms PBS ultra-liberal origin (I support PBS by the way with donations) and pandering to the liberal opinion.

I would hope as an ""intellegent"" species that we would want to evolve the way we think especially when it comes to our spirituality and our connection and relationship to the Divine.
Of course the ""right-wing"" is having a field day condemning the piece, especially for the fact they that are not represented in the discussion.

1214698,1,B00000FELK,"The New Testament is the account for what actually happened to Jesus and the first Christians. This documentary tries to reconstruct the Gospel story based on some obscure archaeological data; and in the process it undermines the first hand Gospel accounts. Jesus was probably NOT born in Bethlehem, it states. They try to say he was probably born in Nazareth because it was a hot bed for fanatics. There were religious fanatics (Zealots) throughout the region in those days...not just in Nazareth! Why such an effort to invalidate the account? And that is what this documentary does throughout. I have read the Bible through and through and studied the ancient history of the time and region. The Biblical account is very much in keeping with the history and archaeology! This program slams the early Christians and says that they ""shaped"" the gospel to fit the Old Testament Scriptures. How outrageous. Jesus purposely died on Passover to fulfill the OT scriptures and foretold His timely death. This was not an after thought. They also state that Paul decided to convert the gentiles out of his diverse (Greek) life experiences. But the account Paul gave of himself before his conversion was that of a staunch separatist Jew. Phil 3:2. Moreover, it was the Apostle Peter who initially had the vision to bring in the Gentiles...not Paul. The Old Testament Prophets also foretold that the DESCENDANTS of the lost Tribes of Israel would someday arise from amongst the Gentiles and join with Judah (the Jews) and RESTORE God's divided Kingdom. The Apostle James proclaims ""the RESTORATION of David's fallen tent"" through the Gentiles in Acts 15. Paul also elaborated on it in Ephesians, Romans and Galatians. Finally, this documentary goes as far to state that Paul probably made a money ""deal"" with the Gentiles. That he asked them to provide financial support for the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem in order to let them into the Church. Ridiculous! While Paul does take a GIFT from a Gentile's church to the persecuted Jewish church in Jerusalem OUT OF LOVE in Romans 15, there is NO suggestion of any ""deal"". This is clearly just an ATTACK on Christians and I could not watch it any more. I would advise all to just read the Bible and do NOT waste your time on this trash.",1261612800,13,2274,4.86340206185567
1214699,1,B00000FELK,"I went into this series expecting to see a highly-detailed dissection of how the early church rose up after the life of Christ, but what I got instead was 4 hours of idle speculation and blatant denial.

Christians, do not be deceived as I was. This ""documentary"" basically completely ignores the Biblical story of the events to such a degree that it's sickening, not even giving them consideration. All of the things that this documentary presents are based on naturalist viewpoints of everything, completely denying any possibility of the divine whatsoever, and taking various truths about culture as a whole in the area to say ""Jesus must have done this too."" This leads to a program that is all speculation, and all based on the notion that Jesus was nobody special, and just a normal resident of Galilee until he led a revolt, and then wasn't called Christ until over 40 years later. If there were some actual archaeological/historical records to back this up, I wouldn't have minded their objections as much. But there was none, and it relied almost exclusively on a preconceived belief in naturalism, which made pretty much all of the claims in this documentary mere speculation.

An example of the idle claims:

-Jesus spent His whole youth in Galilee, and was not in the peasant class but a trader. Why? Because Jews didn't generally travel long distances, and because a Roman market was found in Galilee. Therefore Jesus must have been there his whole life, and therefore must have traded at the market, and therefore had to have been educated and known Greek to be respected there. Convinced?

-The Romans disposed of Jesus because He was a threat to them. Backup? Rome exerted control over everything, and therefore must have seen Him as a threat when he overturned the money-changers' tables in the temple. (This seems to ignore the Herodian rule of Judea, not so much Rome directly, and completely denies any involvement of the Pharisees and chief priests.) It doesn't even give the gospel account consideration at all. It just says ""they must have seen Him as a threat. Therefore, they must have been the ones who killed him.""

-Jesus' death struck a mighty blow to His followers, and even the apostles did not know what to do afterward. Backup? None. Just the naturalist assumption that it is impossible for Him to have risen from the dead. This again quietly denies the possibility of the resurrection, and tries to paint early Christianity as emerging from a bunch of confused sects of radicals who followed Him but then walked around blindly not knowing what to believe after His death supposedly broke their Messianic expectations. My question is, if this is the case, then why didn't any of the other dead ""messiahs"" before and after Jesus have ongoing movements? If Jews of the time were really so desperate for hope that they would go on preaching what they knew to be a fabricated lie, then why did only Jesus' followers do it? And was the account of 500 direct witnesses really either a made-up story or 500 people flat-out lying just to perpetuate that hope?

-The only reason that faith in Christ became a real movement was because of Paul's own gospel. Backup? None at all. They just assume the previous statement about wandering radical sects, and then assume that Paul is the logical person that must have been the catalyst that revived the faith and changed it into something new rather than just a reform to Judaism. I find this very hard to believe given the accounts in Acts where the apostles are preaching the gospel long before Paul even shows up on the scene. So in order for this claim to be true, once again, Luke would have had to be flat-out lying about history for twelve straight chapters until Paul shows up.

-Claims that Jesus was not considered to be the Messiah until after the destruction of Jerusalem, and it was only to console the Jews who had just lost the temple and didn't know what God wanted anymore. Backup? Again, basically none. They take a naturalist, post-temple authorship date for the four Gospels, (they're assuming that Jesus couldn't possibly have foreseen it, of course,) and explained the gap between Jesus' death and the Gospels' authorship dates as being because Jesus wasn't seen as the messiah yet. So... um... if He wasn't seen as the messiah for 40 straight years, would the Jews really so readily change their minds? And if the destruction of the temple was really such a ""we'll believe anything for the sake of hope"" motivator, why didn't they do the same thing with Jeremiah when Babylon destroyed the first temple?

All of these counter-examples might sound a little preachy, but when you think about any of these claims, they really just don't make realistic sense. In order to believe anything in this documentary, you basically have to believe that a very large group of people were all in league together in fabricating lies about Jesus giving sight to the blind and rising from the dead, flat-out lying about everything Jesus said, and of seeing Him alive after His death, and all for no personal rewards whatsoever. (And in most cases, they ended up dead for preaching it.) And I for one cannot support such a view. No other religion in the world makes such claims when speaking of a person who lived within the time of documented history. Not Muhammad, not Krishna, not Bhudda. They were all teachers that said ""this is the way. follow it."" But Jesus' followers claim not just that He knew the way, but also that they were direct eyewitnesses as He restored the sight of the blind and raised the dead. So were they really making up such a ridiculous lie just for the sake of starting something new, or does this documentary need to either find some concrete historical evidence to back up its claims or reconsider its notions about who Jesus was?

Anyway, this is what you can expect with this ""documentary."" Lots of speculation, little evidence, and a complete denial of everything significant written in the Bible.",1256860800,27,6003,4.792270531400966
1214706,1,B00000FELK,"If you are a believer in Christ, this documentary is not worth your money.  PBS starts by saying that the documentary is based on the latest academic, historical, and archaeological evidence, but what is shown is the same team of academic atheists (from Harvard, Yale, Jesus Seminar, etc) who proceed to speculate on who Jesus was and how Christianity came about.  It basically dismisses the New Testament evidence as myths and stories invented by the Jesus movement of the first century.  After quoting a verses out of context, the resurrection accounts in the Gospels are quickly dismissed as historically worthless. One ""expert"" claims that Paul's letters in the New Testament can be summarized as ""doing good because the end is near"".  This message would be laughable if it didn't come from the lips of a president of a theological seminary.

From the resurrection to Constantine, Christianity is painted as a bunch of various cults that lack coherence and focus.

This is another in a long line of documentaries that attempt to paint Christianity as being a religion founded on stories and myths, lacking evidence and feeding on naive believers for growth.  Just once I would like to see the producers interview someone like William Lane Craig, Don Carson, Knox Chamblin, Simon Kistemaker, Norm Geisler, Tim Keller, John MacArthur, RC Sproul, or one of the other scores of New Testament scholars who understand the bible and the Christian doctrines at a level far beyond these so-called ""experts"".

1214707,1,B00000FELK,"There is not a single conservative scholar interviewed in this PBS special. And yet we get to hear from radical liberal scholars like John Dominic Crossan, Elaine Pagels and Helmut Koester. I guess we should expect an unbalanced perspective since PBS created the series.

So much of this series is based on tenuous theory and the ultimate picture given is horribly skewed. At one point Pagels wonders out loud how the movement she's depicted could have possibly been successful. She says it's a mystery. Of course it's a mystery since she's gutted Christianity of any identity.

The Nag Hammadi texts are said to reveal how diverse early Christianity was. Prior to their discovery, the video insinuates, everyone believed that Christianity was a homogenous movement. As if we never had the writings of Irenaeus, Tertullian and Epiphanius telling about the plethora of gnostic groups of the second and third centuries! Gnosticism was not simply another genuine trajectory within early Christianity though. It was an offshoot, a divergence from orthodoxy. It was, I'm sorry to say, a heretical movement. The pannel acts as if Gnostics had just as much a rightful claim to authentic Christianity as orthodox believers. This is not the case. Orthodox Christians had bishops that were installed by the Apostles or by one of their successors. They had a history and traditions that could be traced back to the apostles. These were points that early Christians constantly made against the Gnostics, but the significance of these claims the pannelists don't even stop to consider.

In the end, Jesus and early Christianity become exactly what these 60's-70's generation scholars want them to be. Jesus turns out to have been someone who emphasized oneness with nature. He was crucified for being politically subversive, anti-establishment. He made false predictions about his soon return since, of course, prophecy is impossible according to these scholars' naturalist worldview.

Early believers were very diverse. There was no orthodoxy as such, only wonderful diversity: cultural diversity, doctrinal diversity, all sorts of diversity. If they were alive today they would be Democrats. They would probably have supported the stimulus package as well.

I get so tired of this sort of thing. It would be nice if for once we could see an honest discussion about some of the ""controversial"" claims made in videos like this. It's remarkable to me how the left habitually ignores opposing arguments, acting as if they are just telling you ""the facts"" that are well established by ""scholars"". Another annoying thing: notice how all the pannel members have smirks on their faces whenever they talk, especially when they make claims that they know are controversial. It's like they revel in showing Christians that their religion is bunk.",1238112000,43,2824,5.225165562913907

Although the fundies among us will find a few sticky wickets in the results of an obviously careful piece of scholarly research, i found it enlightening and quite thought provoking. A must see for serious inquirers of early church history. And with Frontline, how can you go wrong?

1214710,2,B00000FELK,"This video series is an object lesson on assumptions. It demonstrates how far off base even intelligent scholars can be when a basic assumption precedes all data, thereby colouring grossly all subsequent data and analysis.

The overpowering, underlying assumption to this entire series, and for the scholars interviewed, is that Jesus lived, was very likely martyred for his teachings, very likely rose from the dead, and very likely was a son of god, or the Christ, the son of the God.

Never minding the data is what most of these scholars have done, which makes them professional myth-makers, little more. Never mind that many of  them are excellent speakers and excellent story tellers, and caring human beings. Never mind that the video series was written, filmed and produced  with the utmost care and delicacy towards the sensitivities of every sort of ""believer"", whether Jewish or Christian. This series is, above all, a proponent of a myth. In this sense I give the series 5 Stars. But from the perspective of the latest scholarship, discoveries of documents, discoveries within documents, discoveries in archeology, I give this series 0.5 Stars.

Of course, Frontline is no stranger to myth-making, but mostly their expertise in that category lies within the political arena. After all, they are, in essence, an organ of the state.",1215648000,17,1342,5.109589041095891
1214711,3,B00000FELK,"i'm one of those people the series calls ""orthodox Christians"", theologically conservative, and knowledgable about many of the issues they talk about.

the show strikes me as a bit arrogant to assume that their particular viewpoint is widely shared, it isn't, but rather is restricted to academics and theologically liberal churches. but i supposed when they count noses on the issues, these are the only people whose opinions or noses count. sadly, it is not a unbiased presentations but rather the current state of the art for a specific theological tradition.

but if you can stomach the documentary hypothesis, Q, and the principle that prophecy is impossible so if a document mentions X that it must have been written after event X has occurs, there is some value to watching it.",1214438400,10,784,4.977099236641221
1214712,3,B00000FELK,"This DVD presents mostly the points of views of several bible scholars. Most of the observations about how Christianity initially developed are acceptable, and some are very good; but most of the final commentaries are way off target.
First, Constantine the Great did tell the Christian soldiers that, in a vision, he had been instructed to place a cipher of Christ (not exactly a cross, as they indicate in the DVD) on the shields of his soldiers, in order to win a crucial battle against Maxentius and to become the sole Roman emperor. But all these scholars appear to ignore that, at the same time, he had told the pagan soldiers that, in a visit to a sanctuary of Apollo in France, he also had a vision in which this pagan god had promised victory and long life to him; thus, it is evident that he was more of a shrewd politician than a true convert.
Second, at the end of the DVD, the narrator says that, with the adoption of Christianity by Rome, some saw the fulfillment of the prophesy that ""the kingdom of the world would become the kingdom of God,"" or vice versa, and that now Jesus of Nazareth had become Jesus the Christ. Well, on one hand Saint Paul had started teaching extensively and in different terms about Christ more than two centuries before; and, on the other hand, Constantine stands for one of the most, if not the most corruptive person in the history of the Church, for now it was the Roman state who pulled many of the strings in the government of the Church, and, in general, authority in the Church became a matter not only of brotherly service, as Jesus taught, but of power and political influence. A much more accurate account of how this merge between Christianity and the Roman government developed is presented in the book 'Constantine and the Bishops,' by H.A. Drake, The Johns Hopkins University Press.",1202428800,70,1839,4.609756097560975
1214713,5,B00000FELK,"As I write this review, this program (""From Jesus to Christ"") is nearly ten years old.  Yet it is still by far the best televised documentary on the topic of early Christianity.  In the place of celebrity or news media narration, this four-hour, four-part film employs some of the most respected scholars of ancient Judaism and Christianity from universities like Harvard and Yale.  Visually, the film stays away from campy ""reenactments"" with bad sets and actors and instead shows archaeological remains from the time of the early Christians and the ""talking heads"" of the scholars.  The information that the scholars convey is basically representative of the debates going on in the field of early Christian studies (the disagreement of the scholars interviewed is thus a strength, not a fault, of this program).  One weakness of the program is that it does not include some of the most revisionist history that is emerging from some scholars (for instance, those scholars who tend to think the book of Acts is largely historically unreliable are not represented). But all things considered, if you want an excellent historical introduction to ancient Christianity in video format, ""From Jesus to Christianity"" is for you.",1199577600,15,1224,5.161616161616162
1214714,4,B00000FELK,"Elaine Pagels is, in my opinion, one of the leading authorities on the subject matter.  I first saw this air on TV and have had many discussions on the various gospels as well as those found in Nag Hamadi. I am a seeker and thus am always on the hunt for answers of how and why.  This documentary attempts, very well, to answer some of those questions most of us have. This does not attempt to rattle questions of faith and if your faith can be easily rattled I don't suspect you would be watching this documentary anyway.",1199145600,10,522,4.316326530612245
1214715,5,B00000FELK,"As a student of world religions, I found this four-part series, which I originally watched on television, to be packed full of great information from a wide variety of disciplines.  It traces the evolution of Christianity from its days as just another Jewish denomination to its final break into an entirely new faith, along with the evolution of the historical Jesus (admittedly a rather obscure figure, given that apart from Josephus, he isn't mentioned in any extrabiblical sources) into a figure of much greater importance (hence the title of the series).  A lot of programs about early Christianity tend to repeat the same old story over and over, but this series goes beyond what we already know to fill in all of the gaps.  After all, a lot of times what isn't said in the Bible is more telling than what actually is said.  Biblical literalists and those who believe the Bible to be absolutely inerrant probably won't be happy with some of these new reinterpretations, but what good is your faith if it can't stand up to some challenges?  One must have a pretty weak faith if it falls apart or feels threatened by new historical information, or modern-day schools of thought that don't adhere to an absolute black and white view of the Bible.  Isn't it better to become stronger in your faith by constantly re-examining and scrutinising what you believe in and forming your own independent beliefs?

The series explores such topics as the journal of Perpetua, an early martyr, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the amazing books found at Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945 (it's criminal and heartbreaking how the mother of the boy who found them threw a couple of them into her kindling fire!), the differences between the four Gospels and how they each reflect their respective eras and locations (Mark starts out in a very Jewish vein and ends on a depressing note, while John is very anti-Jewish and paints the Jesus movement as much stronger and in control at the end), Constantine's conversion, Masada and Shimon Bar Kochba, the destruction of the Second Temple, how Christianity developed in the various places it travelled to in the region, and Jesus's true social class.  All in all, the history of Christianity's first few centuries is a fascinating and multi-faceted story.  It's a guarantee that everyone can learn something new by watching this.",1193184000,128,2346,4.889168765743073

1214719,1,B00000FELK,"The main problem with this documentary is that it begins with the premise that Christ was not the Son of God.

I saw this program on television when it first aired, which also happened to be the same time I was going through RCIA.  Since I am much better at learning things visually, I found this to be a great help to me as I learned about The Church. The historical background to the Jesus movement is fascinating.

I also have found myself watching this program twice a year, at Christmas and again at Easter. Every time I watch it I take another nugget of information that I had forgotten. And unlike Jesus: The complete story, different sides of theological ideas are discussed without a conclusion being made for you.

The only thing I didn't like (and maybe it's just because I've seen the program about a dozen times) was the haunting period music. But it obviously fits the program.",1123891200,24,896,4.546583850931677

Based on traditions and rituals instead of based on Jesus' claim of who He is...one must remember that the resurrection defines the Christian faith.  According to the film,  the early Christians  ""told stories through oral tradition.  These were not historically accounts, but shaped by a common past.""  Therefore, this film had a subtle way of disproving the relevancy of the biblical scriptures.  This is definitely not a film that would convert someone to Christianity and I do not think the writer's intended to do so. A good discussion film.",1122163200,18,710,5.113043478260869

1214723,2,B00000FELK,"I purchased this DVD with great anticipation, expecting a first-rate documentary not unlike many others that PBS has produced (and for which I applaud PBS) in the past.  However, I was disappointed at the lack of scholarship--the documentary is riddled with unsupported, if not problematic, speculations.  It's Geraldo on tranquilizers--okay, maybe not that bad.

The documentary tries deperately to exaggerate the significance of their relatively obscure (interesting, nonetheless) archaelogical finds by manufacturing fantastic hypotheses and scenarios surrounding the discoveries.  The documentary expects its viewers to buy into their speculations using ""expert"" opinions as its primary source of authentication.

One such example is how the producer (whose film credits include the great work of erudition ""Julia!: America's Favorite Chef"") submits a recent discovery of a Roman commerce center near Nazareth (hometown of Jesus) as an evidence(?) that Jesus was a man shaped by wealth and people skills he acquired by pandering to the upper crust of the Roman elite.  The line of thinking goes something like this:  1) Roman civilization was magnificent; 2) in order to navigate through it, one learns to be savvy (there was wealth to be obtained only by savvy artisans/carpenters who learn how to hobnob with the rich and the powerful); 3) we recently found this Roman cultural/commerce center near Nazareth; 4) Jesus must have worked here, catering to the wealthy Romans 5) Therefore, he must have been wealthy and savvy with his Roman clients, both aspects of which helped him become a popular figure among the Jews.  Hmmm....

This is just one of many problematic line of presentation in the documentary.  An alternate description of the documentary could read: ""The experts try to explain the 'phenomenon' of how a plain mortal called Jesus attained a status of deity (i.e., Christ) in the minds of the early believers.""  They basically attribute the rise of Christianity under Roman oppression to something of a ""perfect storm"" of all sorts of the sociopolitical factors.  What about the oppression? -- well, according to these experts, the early Christians could not have been tortured that much because the Roman society was ""civilized and tolerant.""  Also, they make statements like ""there aren't as many Christian martyrs who were killed in stadiums as commonly believed..."" without substantiating what the actual numbers might be.  So be prepared to throw your history lessons out the window.  And for unsubstantiated claims for which they could not find expert testimony, the producer tries to sneak them past the viewer (or cover them up) by using narration of a soothing voice while distracting the viewer with a majestic image of a religious relic or a picturesque landscape (e.g., ""many experts believe that Jesus was actually born in Nazareth and not in Bethlehem""--this is all they say on the subject after a long drawn-out discussion on what year he may have been born).

Stylistically, I found the pace of the documentary slow.  I think the whole thing (4 hours!) could have been packaged into 2 hours because much of time is spent in background music.  It was a chore getting to the end.

I give the documentary two stars (I'm one of those people who have hard time believing people who give five stars to everything)--I'm being generous because as a student of history, I actually find the archaeological discoveries and many of the historical backgrounds interesting. I did not care for the speculations, however.  The documentary tries to tout itself as a showcase of revolutionary discoveries that would cause its viewers (secular or religious) to rethink their understanding of Jesus, but on this topic I would stick to the wealth of established archaelogical/historical evidences that have been unearthed and archived by the actual experts and the scholars.",1119830400,46,3889,5.262135922330097
1214724,1,B00000FELK,"Amazingly disappointing. The story of Jesus told by theologists, historians and archeologists who completely disregard the main source, which is the Bible, and play at guessing what must have been the most probable explanation for the birth of the Christian faith.

See this, the Romans only killed Jesus, because he must have been a threat to the Roman authority. This is not what I read in the Bible and nevertheless they don't explain -or even mention- the Bible's story. No mention of Pharisees nor Saducees... It would make the video too long, right.

We could have heard the words of Jesus himself narrated but no. And I thought He was the main character in this story.

No recreation of facts. And all that is said in each chapter of this series occupies no more than 2 pages (double spece). Slow reading, boring lectures from the professors.

""We know very little about His life""... sure, and what little we know you don't even want to tell us. Don't even let us hear His words. Jesus explained who He was and the purpose of His coming. But this video ignores it.

Conclusion: They tried to trivialize Jesus, stripping Him of everything appealing that we know from the Bible and they reduced Him to an ordinary Joe. History does not prove much, I know that, but neither rules out the wonderful facts narrated in the Bible. So, in the end, this story comes to nothing. Just because they didn't want to bring the Bible to the table. There's no way of knowing the real thing if it's not through the Bible, buddies. At least they could have told us what the Bible says, if only as a theory; it would be more interesting.

Don't forget to read the bible, whether you believe it or not, at least it has explanations and a lot of weighty substance.

Lord, these intellectuals sure don't know what they are talking about. Forgive me for wasting my time, and them for they don't know you.",1113955200,23,1887,4.5816023738872405
1214725,5,B00000FELK,"""From Jesus to Christ- The First Christians"" follows the growth of the early church from the death of Christ to the conversion of Constantine some three hundred years later. Changing attitudes about Jesus and Christianity, from both inside and outside the movement, are examined . Jesus' ministry and death are briefly examined, but in the context of a Jewish culture that was oppressed by Rome.

This is not a faith based program, as the scholars do not debate the divinity of Christ. However, it was a fascinating look at the times in which Jesus lived, taught, and died. I especially enjoyed the information about the young church in Jerusalem. Looking at the facts surrounding the ""Jesus Movement"" only served to strengthen my faith.",1101859200,77,737,4.991869918699187

7908759,5,B00000FELK,"History is constantly changing as new information is brought to light and our environment allows us to see things differently. This series attempts to help us with the next step in understanding the forces evolved in creating the first Christians.

I was very surprised to find so much new information presented in this series. My original intent was to see what Elaine Pagels [author of ""The Gnostic Paul"" ISBN 1563380390] looks and sounds like. I found a lot more treasure.

Going beyond the institutionalized church of today we find some of the many elements that struggled to create the understanding we have today. I was not totally aware that the different time periods of the gospels and location was so significant. The second revolt of the Jews also known about was not emphasized as well as in this series. The real positive impact of the series is that it sets a foundation for further investigation.

There are several drawbacks in the series, all to do with presentation. First it is a series of sound bites. Some nice scenery and inspirational music surrounds little 15 second question and answer interviews. The people that they interview contradict each other; this would be o.k. if they weren't mixed up together. One person says that there was no middle class just ""Have's and have not's."" Then a second person comes in and says that the meeting was attended by all the middle class and not represented by the upper class or the lower class farmers. The nature of what the people are thinking at the time is subject to the interpretation of the speaker with no supporting evidence (of course this may be due to the short time on the review.)

In any event this will need repeated reviewing. Hopefully there will be an updated version with later findings.",1505779200,59,1772,4.8
