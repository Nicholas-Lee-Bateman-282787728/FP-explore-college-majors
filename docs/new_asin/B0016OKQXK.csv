8263593,5,B0016OKQXK,I'm a big fan of anything that covers the mafia or murder or just true crime in general. Upon discovering this release I promptly added it to my cart without reading anything about it. I do this with almost anything crime related that is produced by a&e/history and I'm never disappointed. The only thing I wish I knew before buying was that this is an episode of man moment machine. I hate the guy that narrarates and does the reanactments. Oh well I still wouldve probably bought it. For anyone that's a fan of the mob this is one for you to pick up.,1311206400,,552,4.3173076923076925
