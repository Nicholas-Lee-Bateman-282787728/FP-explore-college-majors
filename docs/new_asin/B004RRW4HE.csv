4461051,5,B004RRW4HE,"This is, in my opinion, the best Parsifal recorded on DVD, and comes close to my favorite audio-only version (Knappertsbusch 1964). This is a modern staging that doesn't changes the original meaning, and focuses on the most important things. Lightning is particularly important in this production, as it enhances the dramatic effect of some of the most important moments. I can't stress enough how much I like this production. The singing is superb, there's a symmetry present in the arrangement of things and placement of people that contrasts with the labyrinth pattern on the floor. As another reviewer mentioned, there are two elements changed from the original: Kundry doesn't die and she actually take the Grail out of the shrine. Considering how many and horrible changes some modern productions do to some operas, this change is rather insignificant and it actually fits the production. The ending transmit such feeling of harmony and perfection that really leaves me speechless every time I watch/hear it.",1345852800,11,1014,5.226993865030675
4461052,4,B004RRW4HE,"Setup satisfactory. Slightly modern, but still with romantic touch. Superb casting. Poul Elming and Linda Watson performs wonderfully. And Amfortas is the first ever to make my eyes wet! Hard to believe, that it is Wolfgang, Richards Grandson, who made the show!
Why not the fifth star? Because there is still more to Parsifal to be reveiled. Flowermaidens can be even more seductive, and Klingsor is a little ""stiff."" Get him closer to the audience!",1334102400,10,450,5.013333333333334
4461053,5,B004RRW4HE,"This production is about as traditional as they come: a 1990s Bayreuth production, directed by Wolfgang Wagner, conducted by Giusppe Sinopoli. No acrobats, no flying pretzel monster, no nudity, no decaying rabbit. Boring, I should imagine...

You might think that: I couldn't possibly agree. This production is excellent, and strongly recommended.

The star of this production is not the director - it's the music of Wagner, ably interpreted by Sinopoli. I've watched Parsifal many times, in many forms. It tends to be ritualized, which is no bad thing, but Sinopoli brings a new freshness to the piece, and finds emotion within the ritual. The scene with Amfortas and his deceased father is delicately expressed. (Oddly enough, Schlingensief also focused on this scene, amidst the chaos of his production...)

The quality of the singing is splendid, for the most part.
Poul Elming's Parsifal was beautifully portrayed: incomparable heldentenor voice, plus a careful portrayal of Parsifal as the Tor, the simpleton: not stupid, merely incapable of dealing with the complexities and hypocrisies of life. In some portrayals, he seems to lose his innocence in the final act. Not in this production. He managed to combine authority with simplicity.

It was fun to see Falk Struckman as Amfortas. We saw him in this role at the Met in 2003, chewing the woodwork and appealing to the gallery. The character of Amfortas deserves no less.

Interesting to see Linda Watson as Kundry. She was fine, but the fey quality of the role seemed to have eluded her. Not unlike her current portrayal of Brnnhilde.

Hans Sotin's Gurnemanz was no more than adequate, but the rest of the cast compensated for this. I usually feel that the the performance of Parsifal stands or falls on Gurnemanz. This performance managed to stand on its own feet.

Any anomalies? Kundry helped Parsifal to raise the Grail. Rather effective, and a subtle bit of regietheater.

A worthy addition to any Wagnerite's library",1307750400,55,1982,5.095679012345679

8439219,4,B004RRW4HE,"This performance is reasonably well-staged, given that this, like most of Wagner's operas seem to engage in mostly long and static pageantry, except in a few scenes.  The Flower Maiden scene is nicely done, and the singing is excellent, but don't expect a lot of action, if you're not familiar with the plot.  I did find that the sound tended to be a bit distorted in the louder passages, but that could be my system or ears.  I'll let the audiophiles judge that one..  I also had to boost my TV screen color to 'vivid', as many of the scenes were otherwise dim and muddy-looking.  Bayreuth productions are famous for that.  (Birgit Nilsson allegedly once wore a miner's lhelmet in a Valkyrie rehearsal to make a point).  The disk was definitely worth the price--used.

8439220,2,B004RRW4HE,"Even Wagnerites will find their attention spans taxed by this performance, especially since Wolfgang Wagner's production (dominated by geometrical set pieces) is a non-event. The lack of engagement with the substance of ""Parsifal"" proves infectious to several of the performances, especially Hans Sotin's Gurnemanz, who comes across like a Sunday school teacher roped into telling the Grail story once too often. At the opposite extreme, Falk Struckmann (not usually a favorite of mine) is highly involved, looking Christlike and giving a wrenchingly intense portrayal of Amfortas' torments. His nemesis, Klingsor, also gets strong representation from Ekkehard Wlaschiha. In her first Bayreuth Kundrys, Linda Watson is an appealing alternative to the ubiquitous Waltraud Meier, with role's *Zwischenfach* tessitura sitting just right for her. Wolfgang's sole innovation is to have a redeemed Kundry survive at the end, joining Parsifal to elevate the Grail. Poul Elming's Parsifal looks -- and, more importantly, sounds -- rather long in the tooth for the guileless fool. (One could ignore this with Jon Vickers, so compelling was his interpretation, but Elming is no Vickers.) The TV direction is as neutral as the staging itself. Those seeking a traditional ""Parsifal"" are probably better off with the Met telecast (Meier; Jerusalem, Weikl, Moll, Mazura/Levine), while those who want to have their preconceptions of the opera shaken and stirred are urged toward the Baden Baden festival performance (Meier; Ventris, Hampson, Salminen, Fox/Nagano), which dawdles considerably less and is, on balance, better sung than this one.",1464652800,2,1628,5.648979591836735

8439225,5,B004RRW4HE,"There are a number of DVDs/Blu-rays of PARSIFAL but most fall short due to inept conducting, mediocre singing, and atrocious stagings that may have a ""message"" but it's not Wagner's. Sinopoli was certainly no Knappertsbush or von Karajan but he does a better job than anyone after him. Linda Watson is a decent Kundry despite the unttarctive as well as unseductive weight. Elming is no Melchior or Windgassen and keeps his eyes fixed on the conductor as if on cue cards. That said, it's a moving performance of Wagner's greatest (and my personal favorite) opera. The staging isn't bad but Wolfgang was certainly no Wieland. The bottom line is that this is the best that's likely to show up on DVD or Blu-ray as the qualities of singing, conducting, and staging continue to deteriorate and won't get back this level, much less the superior earlier standards.",1400976000,3,857,4.876712328767123

8439227,5,B004RRW4HE,"Saw this production two years in a row at Bayreuth.  I have almost all the Parsifal CDs and DVDS and this probably is my favorite, except for the Kundry who sings beautifully, but is not a great actress nor seductive.  Waltraud Meier is the echt Kundry in every respect.  Hans Sotin has a great voice but is not a great vocal actor.  Falk Struckman as Amfortas made me bawl at Bayreuth and almost  did it again. Poul Elmung as Parsifal is excellent.  The sound and picture were much better than I expected for an older DVD.  A must for Parsiful lovers.",1350259200,7,552,4.405940594059406
