8105708,4,B000E4FHSC,"I'm a Bellydance teacher and I can see difference in dance quality, Rania is a good coach, she breaks down the steps in an easy to learn way, she is clear in dance vocavulary, this is a good enjoyable dance routine, you can chose a single parte and do your own choreography with another music or ddance the whole routine that is challenger, this is not a beginners video and her Egyptian style is pretty good.",1168387200,6,409,4.394736842105263
8105709,1,B000E4FHSC,"there's got to be more rating options besides stars -- because this is a bomb. It deserves not even one star. Miss Rania is mighty stiff for a dancer. I don't know anything about the Egyptian style or any particular style except for jazz fusion, but after seeing the professionalism in Gothic Belly Dance, you'd think she's a novice. Her costume is just as bad, and her arm movements remind me of John Trovolta in Saturday Night Fever. Someone who may be limited in mobility will be pleased with this DVD / dancer; for anyone who can move without a walker, this is excruciating.",1165795200,4,578,4.5673076923076925
8105710,4,B000E4FHSC,"Before all, here's a disclaimer: I need to note that I almost got this item thinking I had never seen it before. I got confused because I have the same DVD at home but the cover was different (obviously an older edition). It's possible that she might have redone the DVD to improve aestethics but I have compared the contents and they're the same.

Overall this is an OK DVD. It's a choreography on a single song as the title suggests. Rania breaks the choreography into moves organized into several combinations shown without, then with music, and strings them up. There is a performance of the choreography with regular clothes and one more, with a full costume.

Even though the title says ""advanced"" I think it's targeted at intermidiate dancers.

What I LIKED about the DVD:

- Choreography was nice and I learned a few new moves, especially the barrel turn.

- It was nicely challenging, this means not as hard as to be frustrating but also not as easy as to be bored with it immediately.

- DVD value is decent.

- Rania explains as she would to her students in class.

- I found some of her traveling steps very interesting

- The drum-solo bonus performance of Rania. I can't be certain because I haven't bought her Drum Solo DVD but it's likely this is the same dance she teaches there.

- Rania's explanations are nice and clear but not very detailed. Of course this is because she presumes that if you've bought an *advanced choreography DVD* you must be already familiar with the steps.

What I did NOT LIKE about this DVD:

- Rania's outfit when she teaches. I don't know why she got into the idea of dressing herself in back from neck to toe! I couldn't see her belly at all because it was covered! This is one reason why I took off a star.

- Lights could be better, especially because Rania ""blended"" with the room because of her dark outfit.

- I'm sure it's a matter of taste but I didn't find Rania as graceful as I had expected. Her movements are a little... mm, jerky.

This DVD may be right for you if:

- You are a Rania fan

- If you're looking for a whole choreography to learn and practice on your own

- If you're an intermidiate dancer

- If you like seeing a dancer who can't qualify as a model (in other words, a REAL woman even though Rania can't quite qualify as plump)

You probably won't care for this DVD if:

- You don't care any for Rania either

- If you are looking to expand your zills or any props horizons. No props were included

- You're a beginner who still finds it hard to layer

- You are willing to spend some more money if it would buy fancy settings. Don't expect thick Persian carpets, draperies and the like.

- You are want fusion and western music.

If you already have a couple of DVDs and want to expand your horizons and you like traditional Mid-eastern style, you won't be disappointed with this DVD.",1154217600,12,2860,4.369318181818182
