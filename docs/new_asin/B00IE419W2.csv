6260210,4,B00IE419W2,"A taught,well paced procedural drama with a new twist,involving a much maligned section of society. Canadian TV dramas sure know how to break new ground",1412121600,3,152,5.12
6260211,4,B00IE419W2,"Detective Aiden Black (David Sutcliffe: Gilmore Girls) is having a bad few months. He was involved in two seperate shooting incidents--both deemed clean and justifiable, and now he is showing signs of PTSD. To make matters worse, his girlfriend moves out, and there is the fact that he went a bit bonkers in a restaurant.

Black's supervisor, Inspector Diane Caligra (Karen Le Blanc) assigns Black to the newly created Psych Crimes and Crisis Unit; a unit created by Caligra and Dr. Daniella Ridley (Stephanie von Pfetten). The unit deals with crimes commited by people who are considered mentally unstable, which would make Black a perfect fit.

There are two teams within the unit, each comprised of a detective and a psychologist. Black is paired with Ridley, and what Black doesn't know is that Ridley was tasked to report back to Caligra about his behavior, which, after their first case she describes as: ""Not broken, but cracked.""

Season one has numerous guest stars including Enrico Colantoni (Veronica Mars, Just Shoot Me), and Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black, Parks and Recreation).

Cracked could be considered a ""police procedural with a twist,"" and in some ways it is. However, that would be a bit reductive. It is a series that is very well written and acted... In my opinion.",1405209600,24,1289,4.981395348837209

6260241,3,B00IE419W2,"It has been better than I expected. Canadian series with solid acting and sometimes compelling plots. From other reviews you probably already know that the series centers on a psych crimes unit where a psychiatrist and detective with occasionally volatile and idiosyncratic behaviors are paired.  Some of the episodes are frankly good. Episode 9, in particular was particularly powerful and magnetic.

So, if you are looking for escapism that is not trash and occasionally good, I would give Cracked a try",1444176000,,505,5.222222222222222

6260272,1,B00IE419W2,"The premise of this U.S. crime procedural was cracked--which is why the show was so flat.  I found it hard to believe that this was produced by BBC America, which usually gives pretty good fare.

The lead male detective follows the mold--lonely, isolated, mildly to moderately tortured psychologically, inconsistent, very poor communication and cooperation skills, sad, lonely, but brilliant (of course!)  The lead female is a beautiful L.A. psychiatrist-turned-policewoman (how's that for an unrealistic premise?) who correctly diagnoses her male partner (""an a**hole"") but who lets him lead her around.  Believe me, there is no frisson between these two characters, on any level whatsoever.

The plot development revolves around the antipathy between the two detectives, each one theorizing who did the crime and why; none of which was made plausible by evidence, data, prior history, knowledge of crime, etc.

Whew!  One episode was enough to take this off the Watch List...",1435276800,5,977,5.430463576158941

6260279,2,B00IE419W2,"I didn't think this series was any good, that's why I only watched a few episodes and gave up on it.",1433721600,,100,3.8095238095238093
6260280,5,B00IE419W2,"Some of the most difficult calls police have to respond to are those involving people that are mentally ill.
What makes them difficult - and potentially dangerous - is the fact that the mentally ill person the cops are interacting with is often unable to fully comprehend his or her surroundings; often unable to mentally process the commands of the officers who responded to the call.
It is made even more difficult by the fact that cops aren't trained to handle the mentally ill.
The result: Too often the mentally ill end up in physical confrontations with two or more heavily armed cops.
But what would happen if the police department had a unit composed of specialists who are, in fact, trained to handle the mentally ill?
That's the premise of ""Cracked,"" an excellent Canadian cop show about just such a unit composed of cops and mental health professionals who respond to situations involving people who are not, for one reason or another, acting rationally.
The unit is small - only four people: A psychiatrist, a mental health male nurse, and two detectives, one of whom has been involved in two fatal shootings in a relatively short period of time. The team members do not immediately bond: The detectives are concerned that the mental health professionals do not carry guns and might not be of much use if a physical confrontation results. The nurse and the psychiatrist doubt that the two detectives are fully committed to this new brand of policing. Det. Aidan Black, for example, is assigned to the unit because he is suffering from PTSD after the two fatal shootings he was involved in. He does not want to be there and makes that plain from the start. Meanwhile the other cop - Detective Poppy Wisnefski - is an impatient young woman who sees her posting to this unit as little more than a step toward her ultimate goal of joining the homicide bureau.
What made this show so fascinating for me is that internal conflict: Aiming to provide the proper response to people who are mentally ill, the cops have their own issues with their team members and vice versa. It makes for some dramatic situations that the cast handled with real skill.
Sadly, the show only lasted two seasons. Like ""Arctic Air,"" another topflight Canadian series that bit the dust, it was cancelled due to budget cuts. That is a real shame because the show highlighted some very real social problems and suggested ways in which police might actually be able to live up to the motto ""To Protect and Serve.""",1433462400,4,2491,4.728735632183908

6260283,5,B00IE419W2,This show is refreshing...not just for the premise and story lines but for the actors I didn't know (not being from Canada) and the multi-faceted characters. I had to stop myself from watching the entire season in one sitting! Great stories and I like the light they shine on the mentally ill -- encouraging us to look at the next person we encounter with mental illness differently. I truly enjoyed this show.

The male lead was obviously cast for his visual appeal as his delivery of bad lines was in poor taste. I thought there would be more international acting within this epi but that too was disappointing. There was no on screen appeal for me in this series. The storyline was a little warped and I felt a little Deja Vu (wasn't there another 'whacked out' character that played a detective in another series -- Wire in the Blood). At any rate, this was an okay attempt to showcase new talent and if the writing, the male lead, and the direction had been a little better I might have pursued more then one epi, but it was too blatantly obvious how the story would end within the first 10 mins.",1423440000,9,1018,4.629834254143646

As a trained psychologist, I found it refreshing that mentally ill persons were not treated  as evil.  It was nice that the writers approached the subject of mental illness with respect and showed that while it can be difficult for police to deal with mentally ill persons, they don't need to always respond with guns and aggression but rather with respect and empathy.  This is not a car chase and gun play type of show.  Some people will find this boring or slow paced but if you are bored with traditional police dramas you should give this show a try.  Unlike shows like Profiler or Criminal Minds, serial killers are not the focus.",1423353600,12,722,4.507692307692308

It also, in the first episode, portrays the ""bad"" guy as being not all black and white--this is not a show in the American mold--more European than anything else. Interestingly, the cop with PTSD is shown at the end of the episode talking to his therapist, not resisting therapy, as is the clich of US cop shows.",1422748800,13,511,4.389473684210526

6260375,4,B00IE419W2,"NOT DESIGNED AS AN ADRENALINE FILLED THRILLER IF THATS WHAT YOU CRAVE  --- BUT AN EXCELLENT SERIES WITH INTERESTING CHARACTERS

***WHY SOME MAY NOT LIKE IT: Many readers will notice a lot of negative reviews.  Please accept this attempt to help both those who will dislike, and those who will enjoy the show figure out where they fit in.  This show is definitely different than American audiences are used to and my intent is to inform both sides.  This crime solving show is not as sensational as say a CSI or The Wire.  It is dramatic, but just different.  The characters are not as stereotypically beautiful as Hollywood actors (there are still some very attractive people).  Though I love the sensational stuff too, sometimes I also like something a little slower and off beat.  That's more the direction of this show which often solves crimes by simply relating or thinking the way of the people involved. If you are one who will hate the show, keep in mind I am trying to inform you too and I am actually giving you description.  It is perfectly ok to write one's own review without being offended by one that differs in opinion.

INTRO: Starts a little slow, and took several episodes for me to understand and enjoy the characters.  This Canadian made crime solving drama uses a somewhat different premise and progresses at it's own pace.  For those looking for an adrenaline filled thriller or shoot-em'-up with lots of gun play, this really isn't it.  There is still action, there is still gun play, but the cases they present are a little more complicated as they deal with perpetrators, witnesses and victims with specific problems with psychological or emotional instability.  Hence the special psych crimes unit.  That may not sound interesting to some, but it does allow them to approach episodes with a little more freshness of plot and story line.  I thought the plot was very fresh and somewhat more earthy in many cases.  Of course it's not as polished and high octane as a Hollywood series.  But for those who like Canadian cinema and TV, that's part of the draw and a welcome change now and then.

THE PLOT:  Aidan Black is a former tactical team officer (similar to SWAT) who has suffered a trauma on a previous mission gone bad.  After an emotional breakdown and temporary mental lapses, he is moved (ironically) to a newly formed Psychological Crimes Unit.  This new concept within the department pairs his tactical expertise with a psychiatrist Daniella Ridley, who has left a prestigious hospital position to join the police force and design this new unit.  The viewer quickly learns that Aidan is in the unit for more than one reason.  Using the ""it takes one to know one"" kind of approach, Aidan relates to the people they encounter.  He is sort of the shooter on the team when things are bad, but he also uses his insight from his own problems to help the criminals or victims.  The attractive Dr. Ridley is the actual professional perspective on the team, but deals with problems in a more sensitive and even maternal way when called for.  The conflict is that Daniella is also there to keep an eye on Aidan and report back to the department head, particularly if Aidan seems to be coming apart.  That may sound bland to some and it does move at a slower pace.  But I often found the situations engaging and the characters were very sympathetic.  I did find myself liking them, caring about them, and about how things were resolved.  That is the mark of great character development and good casting.  Ultimately Aidan will see the harsher realities in other peoples illnesses, which turns an ugly mirror on his own potential self destruction.

FINAL THOUGHTS: The police in this show may not have as chiseled jaw lines or arms like cannons, but the premise is fresh and engaging.  The production values are excellent and there is a particularly Canadian feel to the series that is a plus or minus depending on your personal tastes.  For me it's a plus to have an alternative now and then.  If this sounds remotely interesting to you, I definitely recommend the show.  It might be best to rent unless you pick it up cheap.",1421798400,37,4150,4.696675900277008
