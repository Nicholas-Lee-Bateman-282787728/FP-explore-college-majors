8223134,1,B000WFOR48,This was a bad film reminding me that still back in the day and group of 6 wannabe actors and a small crew can get funding for  slasher film.,1418860800,,141,3.8620689655172415
8223135,5,B000WFOR48,"My review is for CARNAGE.  I wasn`t interested in class as I`m sure it`s just another slasher.  CARNAGE is one of those ""so bad it`s good"" movies for which I was pleasantly surprised.  The acting isn`t altogether bad and neither is the sound or picture quality.  It`s laughable, but I`m not sure if it was intended to be a dark comedy or not. Don`t miss it for laughs and cheap thrills. Gore yes, but who can take it seriously?",1379894400,,427,4.367088607594937
8223136,1,B000WFOR48,"i bought this movie to see some of the old buiildings at STAUNTON MILITARY ACADEMY CAMPUS where it was filmed after the ACADEMY CLOSED.THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF LIGTHING,(TO ADD TP THE SCARY MOOD?) SO THE VIEWER COULD NOT SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY TO BUY IT. THIS MOVIE WAS WORSE THAN ANY I HAVE EVER SEEN.DON'T BUY IT. !!!!",1358640000,,343,4.375
8223137,3,B000WFOR48,"Okay, so 3 stars for this low-budget, grade-Z schlock known as both ""Class Reunion Massacre"" and ""The Redeemer""? I say why not? It's an extra cheesy 80's slasher, which tried to be more. ""Class"" starts out in what looks like a flooded rock quarry where some kid with a bad 70's haircut and a groovy pair of maroon cords emerges from the lake, why, who is he you might ask, we don't know and never will. All we know is that he has an extra Thumb and doesn't like off color jokes. From here the story jumps to a preacher laying down the fire and brimstone while this extra-thumbed kid sits in the choir. We are then introduced to the victims who all represent a sin, and all of whom happen to be part of the same graduating class about to return to their 10 year high school reunion. The death scenes are goofy, the gore given a bright red paint tinge which is unconvincing. There is some half-hearted attempt to make the killer different and not just your average psycho offing folks randomly. And this is where my 3 star rating comes in. This psycho is played by one of the most hammy and overacting dinner theater graduate to ever grace the screen. T.G. Finkbinder is AWESOME. Whether he is dressed up a murderous clown, dressed as Death or even Dressed as a knock off of the Phantom of the Opera quoting Shakespeare, Finkbinder steals every scene he is in! Is this movie scary? No. Is it gory? Not really? Is it basically the exact same film as ""Slaughter High""? Yes. But while ""Class Reunion Massacre"" does not feature the effects, budget or gore factor as ""Slaughter High"", it does have, the MAN----T.G. Finkbinder.

This is a double feature disk...I have no idea what ""Carnage"" is, and unless it's another Finkbinder film, I won't waste space on this review.",1203552000,2,1763,4.509375
