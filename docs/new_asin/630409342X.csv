7861464,4,630409342X,"This can justly be called essential Scooby. In one episode, we have a really creepy setting that is nicely flattered by the eerie gypsy and a phrophecy of doom. The gang then meets a vampire who looks suspiciously like Bela Lugosi. (Though Frank Langella will always be Dracula to me.) Moving on, the disappearance of Daphne provides some suspense. Scooby and Shaggy come off a little braver in this episode. We also get to see their reaction to a very bad menu. One of the few times they say: ""YUCK!"" at the sight of food. Velmah also loses her glasses. Shaggy and Scooby get lost, and we see them pass the time in an unusual way. We also have the luxury of seeing 3 monsters in this episode. Without giving away the ending, there is some irony in how Scooby and Shaggy unknowingly give the bad guy exactly what he is looking for. The other episode is great too. It starts normal enough with a camping trip. But the night out soon turns into a night of fright. Shaggy gives us a greater portion of one liners in this episode. Great! ""Here lies Silas long. Half man, half wolf."" SHAGGY: ""And like I'm half gone already!"" There is an unusual amount of suspense before the chases start. Alright. There is also a chase put to music, and Scooby and Shaggy show just how useful a pair of garbage can lids can be. Moving right along, Fred, Daphne, and Velmah get trapped, and we see Scooby and Shaggy save the day. So, what if it was by accident? For once, we get to see Velmah, Fred, and Daphne scared by Scooby and Shaggy too! Moving right along,an accident, starts indicating that this supernatural mystery is really linked to some real human criminal activity. Simply put, this is essential Scooby Doo. Don't miss it!",1022112000,6,1715,4.5
