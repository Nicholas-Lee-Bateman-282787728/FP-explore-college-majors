1841246,5,B00008EY60,"When I first saw the trailer for RADIO I thought it looked really cheesy. I thought surely that it was going to be a lame attempt by star Cuba Gooding Jr. to acknowledge to his fans that he knows he's been wasting his talent in films such as BOAT TRIP, SNOW DOGS, and RAT RACE. So, needles to say I wasn't that excited about seeing the film. However, my mom and my brother came to visit and it was the one movie they and my girlfriend and I could all agree on watching. And I'm happy to say my thoughts based on the trailer were proven wrong.
RADIO is a wonderful film! As a matter of fact it is never cheesy and it never lays on the sap as I had initially thought it would. Instead it does just the opposite and is very subtle in it's emotions. I was as uplifted by RADIO as I have been by any film in recent memory. Cuba Goodings Jr.'s performance of the title character isn't only great it's incredibly brave. He isn't given much dialogue and yet he still really lets you know who his character is and what he's all about. This is the only noteworthy thing the actor has done since ""showing the money"" in JERRY MCGUIRE but it's been worth the wait. Not that I put that much stock in Oscar after the decisions the Academy has made in the past couple of years but if Cuba Gooding, Jr. isn't nominated for Best Actor it will be a crime. So far, there hasn't been a better performance this year. What else can I say? His portrayal is flawless and inspiring. Ed Harris is in fine form as well. Actually, I've never seen a movie Ed Harris wasn't good in so that should come as no surprise.
I love films like RADIO. It's the type of film that makes me want to literally stand up and cheer. After watching this film, it made me want to go out and try and be a better person. You know, give someone a helping hand. And if a film's capable of doing that to a person, especially me, then it must be powerful!

1841247,4,B00008EY60,"I saw the sneak preview of RADIO and found it a good movie. Not a great movie, which it could have been, but better then the crap that was out this summer. I love going to movies especially when they are well written and do not make you check your watch to see how long you have to endure this IQ robbing film. RADIO did not make me look once. I rank it up with the best of 2003 along with Pirates of the Caribbean and Second Hand Lions. It is well worth the money?..",1066435200,5,467,3.9263157894736844

1841688,4,B00008EY60,"Based on a true story of a big-hearted South Carolina high school football coach, Harold Jones (Ed Harris) and a similarly giving  and lovable mentally challenged neighborhood kid, James ""Radio"" Kennedy (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), this film is a winner. It doesn't hurt to cast these two boundless talents in the lead roles. Radio is a teenager, as it begins, with a passion for radios and for his hometown football team, watching every practice with pure devotion from behind a chainlink fence. He lives in an isolated world, has a devoted mom, who must work constantly, and amuses himself with such activities as climbing into his grocery cart and, with a stick for a paddle, canoeing down the highways of Hanna, alternately shunned and mistreated by its inhabitants. Coach Jones is having none of that and invites Radio into Hanna's mainstream, in a monumental way. The rest remains to be seen. This is an uplifting, robust story, which will point out some inhumanity, just as it does the immense gifts of mutual connection and kindness. The acting is solid, as are all filmmaking disclipines.

A couple things that coach jones did well was helping build the self-confidence of radio. He also helped his football players become more excepting of a African American with a mental illness.

We knew most of the people in this movie so it is a great treasure trove of wonderful memories. It highlights one of so many relationships that develop behind the scenes in a coaches life and job.  Most folks don't ever get to see of what a typical, caring football coach and teacher does ""behind the scenes"" that doesn't necessarily relate directly to ""the game itself"" but to a much bigger plan; life itself, and the guidance, care, and love of the coaches in helping  grow ""their kids"" (AND often their whole families)  into fine young people as well as players!

1841939,5,B00008EY60,"Radio is based on a true story were a boy named James or as coach Jones call him Radio has a mental disability and is also African American during a time where race was still an issue through out southern communities. Coach Jones takes Radio under his wing and lets him manage the football team. Soon Radio is becoming part of the school by managing the basketball team as well along with doing the school announcements and being a hall monitor, but many struggles between the school district, parents, and booster members cause many problems through out the movie. Coach Jones was a huge influence on Radio and helped break the shell that he was in and grow as a person not only personality wise but also educationally. Radio and Coach Jones had a very personal relationship through out the movie, which if he were a teacher today would be frowned upon and he pulled some strings that probably wouldnt happen today. As a teacher Coach Jones made some smart teaching and coaching moves through out the movie by bringing Radio in and disciplining kids that would bully Radio. The principle also made many smart administrative decisions when it came to handling Radio through out the school. I would strongly recommend this to other teachers because it shows that just one teacher can make a difference in the school and to never back down for what you believe in.",1427760000,,1362,4.702928870292887

1842032,5,B00008EY60,"Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. deliver an Outstanding Acting Performance in this heartfelt movie, based on a true story. Ed Harris plays the role of a football coach, who develops a sudden interest in a young man, who he watches walk across the field everyday during football practice. The young man is a Special Needs, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., and once they meet, they begin to bond.

The small town they live in are trying to push the young man away, but James is supported by Harold Jones(Ed Harris) in every respect. Before they know it, they become very close, and some scenes are emotional.

James winds up becoming a person to be remembered in his small town, and a big part of the life Harold Jones lives. This movie will hit home as it tugs at the heart for anyone who has taken care of the mentally challenged, and has become a part of their lives. The movie is engaging, inspiring, and powerfully moving. Highly recommended!",1413936000,,938,4.544378698224852

This shows how a man can try to do the right thing even when trying to be a husband, father, coach, teacher, and role model while being persecuted by people who want to promote their selfish agendas. I highly recommend this movie if you are tired of all the cursing, violence, nudity, and sexual content in most movies. It is also nice that this is based on a true story.

1842142,1,B00008EY60,"If you've never seen a movie or TV show before, I certainly recommend this picture.  Otherwise, you will be bored to tears by the shameless number of cliches this movie resorts to.  CG Jr. was not particularly impressive in this role either.

Let me just point out one thing that should make any moderately intelligent movie goer steer clear:  Cuba Gooding Jr. (Radio) actually refers to himself as Radio in this movie.  Seriously, he talks in the third person with bad grammar.  For example, he would say ""Radio hungry"" instead of ""I am hungry"".

I'm sure the creators of this film thought that political correctness would protect it from too many negative reviews, which is probably true.  I believe it has a 33% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, 33% too high in my opinion.

On second thought, maybe you should watch this film just so you can have an appreciation for Robert Downey Jr.'s astute observation in 'Tropic Thunder':  NEVER GO FULL RETARD.",1404691200,,955,4.803680981595092

They found him in a shred that the players put him in. From that day on the coach made it that he personally would look in on Cuba and get to know him. He ended up really caring for him. He took him to football games and he really looked after him. Cuba mom in the movie passed away and the coach went looking for him and stay with him and held him. Cuba was passing out Christmas gifts and leaving them on these peoples' pouches. They police came and arrested him thinking that he stoled the gifts, but he hadn't and the coach came down and got him out. What a wonderful movie this is.

A nice mix of football/sports action,drama and a touch of comedy! The cast of familiar character actors help round out this touching and inspiring story with heart.

It has a bit of a Remember the Titans feel except with all the action tending to really happen away from the field in many respects. For families, there is particularly one scene with quite a bit of language when the coach gets angry on the field and then one other inappropriate scene when Radio is setup by a few players trying to get him into trouble, which involves going into a girls locker room.

1842355,1,B00008EY60,"I watched this movie on a DVD for a few minutes. The acting is good and the setting, historically, seems accurate. The movie is about a timid passive black man who is also retarded and his traumatic experiences with stereotypical deep south characters. The movie is educational, showing how evil people can be to those less fortunate. I personally don't like this type of movie since it associates regular people with negative stereotypes. Like the cop who arrested Radio; for all we know he could be just doing his job, and most cops are not racists but this movie reinforced the negative stereotype. Anyway, these reviews are meant to be helpful to others so, I can say that I think the movie is fairly well done. If you like this type of movie about stereotypes then you may enjoy this one. I personally didn't find this movie entertaining and felt somewhat cheated, sort of like paying to get in a theme park and as you walk through the gate you're forced into an auditorium and get a lecture on someone's pet social theories.",1353801600,,1030,4.633879781420765

1842384,3,B00008EY60,"Well, let's tote up the variables. I love movies based on true stories, but I'm not much for sports. To the extent this is about North Carolina high school football, it doesn't grab me all that well. But it's really about Radio (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and his friend the football coach (Ed Harris). Radio's mama also looks familiar; she was on Law & Order. The actresses name is S. Epatha Merkerson, but I do not recall her name here, other than ""Mrs. Kennedy."" Radio's real name is James Robert Kennedy, as I recall.

Radio is pretty severely retarded (this is 1973, before the terminology was updated), but he's a happy, gentle man. He rolls an old grocery cart all over town, and picks up discarded radios to fix. One day, he was outside the fence of the football practice field when a ball went over the fence. He picked it up and put it in his cart. Thus began a relationship with Coach Jones and the football team, with the coach teaching the boys compassion toward Radio after they ""jokingly"" bound him with bandage tape and locked him in the supply shed.

Most people didn't seem to mind that he became something of a mascot to the team, although the principal seemed to notice that this was possibly a racist stereotype. Still, he seriously helped the coaching staff, and grew more verbal as a result. Of course, there's always one person . . . in this case the local banker and father of the star of the basketball team.

All's well that ends well, but I'm not going to give anything more away. Do have a box of Kleenex handy.",1336694400,,1532,4.464285714285714

1842427,5,B00008EY60,"Right away it needs to be said that Radio is NOT your typical ""boy struggling to fit in becomes a star football player"" type storyline.  While at first it may seem to head in that direction, once we find out that a black student pushing a shopping cart down the streets is struggling to communicate with his classmates in a mid 70's small town because he's mentally impaired, the storyline drastically improves.

Throughout the film, the boy gradually wins over the love and affection of everybody around town.  One thing that's a little confusing is that the begininng of the film focuses on football, then moves into basketball.  It might be confusing for those expecting the boy to make a decision, but jumping around between the two sports WAS his decision apparently.  If you're wondering how the movie got its name, it's because the mentally impaired boys name IS Radio.

Radio gets into a TON of supposed trouble and becomes the center of attention because of his condition and because of his skin color.  Remember, it's the mid 70's.

This next part might be considered a spoiler, so you've been warned.  Actually the rest of my review might be loaded with spoilers, so stop reading RIGHT NOW if you haven't seen Radio yet.

I was surprised that he never actually became a part of the team.  He probably wasn't capable of it, but still, I'm happy -for the sake of unpredictability- that it never ended up that way.

One thing I didn't quite understand is a segment involving the star of the basketball team.  He played a prank on Radio involving a girls shower room, but the way he and Radio made up is (shortly after the coach drilled the player for the prank) when he returned to his gym locker and noticed a radio and paper with a bunch of circles (football O's I assume) lying next to it.  He then went over where Radio was folding towels and made up with him.  I must have misunderstood something because I fail to see how this was supposed to get the two of them to make up with each other and become friends.  There was obviously meaning behind this segment but I didn't understand what.

Overall, solid movie with a compelling drama.",1308960000,,2149,4.5837696335078535

 Mainly, I was referring to Ed Harris' role as ""Coach Jones."" I think they went a little overboard on his character, but that's better than the reverse: showing him worse than what he was in real life.  Anyway, I never complain about a nice, feel-good film, and it is nice to see a bunch of well-meaning, kind people.

Those folks direct their friendship, love and compassion to ""James Kennedy,"" better known as ""Radio,"" a mentally slow high school kid played by Cuba Gooding Jr. The story takes place in the mid 1970s in South Carolina. Gooding does a nice job with the role, too.

Note: It was interesting in one of the documentaries on this DVD to find out that, in real life, in took years for ""Radio"" to make his transformation, not months as shown in the film.",1239753600,,1001,4.569832402234637

1842451,5,B00008EY60,"""Radio"" is based on a true story of a mentally challenged young Black man (played by Cuba Gooding) who is befriended by a South Carolina football coach (played by Ed Harris).  The story takes us through a school year where initially a nonverbal Radio is taunted by drivers and the football team.  When the Coach takes him in and starts turning him into a mascot, the young man goes through a pretty miraculous transformation.

This isn't a football film.  It's a film about life and as the Coach says it, ""What's really important.""

I've enjoyed both Harris and Gooding in many of their roles.  In my humble opinion, this is the one they'll go down in history for.

1842453,5,B00008EY60,"A simple film about humanity, humaneness, just plain life and what it should be. The question here is about the place of a mentally disabled person in our society. Is he supposed to be pushed on the side and kept there in the margin or is he supposed to be helped to find a place inside where he could be useful to himself, to others, and happy too? I guess when stated like that the challenge would be accepted by anyone. Asking the question is answering it, as the saying has it. But if we move to the South in the early integration days and if the mentally disabled person is black, what can we do? And asking that second question reveals what it is all about then? Not about the retard as some are going to call him, but about the racial difference. And that is what the film shows with great emotion and subtlety. And the coach in the film is white and he is doing just what he feels is good and that creates some kind of a stir and the stir from some white parents will be solved essentially by the high school students themselves who adopt the boy and make him their mascot one said, but that was false. He was more a mirror into which they saw the challenge of sport, the challenge it is to live up to something you have never done and don't know yet how to do. And that mirror was teaching a lesson of courage and enthusiasm to the teens or young men and they learned that lesson with style, gusto and charm. They learned how to love the one who was pulling them up from the dirt into the sky. A model in life is not necessarily a Hollywood star, but he can be just someone who could be bitter and defeated and yet finds in himself the strength and the inspiration to accept and face his limits and then step over them and climb. Yes you can climb into a tree even if you have no legs or no arms. The climbing is first of all in your head and if it is not there, you will never climb the tree even if you have twenty legs. That's what the film is about and the bigots who resist that lesson are just off the point and out of focus.

However my wife wanted to see it so reluctantly I finally gave in to the pressure and agreed. I must admit I was very pleasantly surprised.

The '03 film 'Radio' turned out to be an inspirational and uplifting true life story ala 'Rudy' that leaves it's audience filming good about themselves and the world around them. Cuba Gooding Jr. is magnificent as James Robert Kennedy (aka: Radio), the mentally challenged young man that wins the heart of the Hanna High School football coach, the school and eventually the entire town of Anderson, South Carolina. Ed Harris is also exceptional as coach Harold Jones who takes Radio off the streets and provides him with an opportunity to lead a fulfilling life.

1842455,1,B00008EY60,"Being the parent of an autistic child and volunteering in a disability ministry, I must confess that I was disappointed by the portrayals in this film.  Radio is unrealistic.  He can do no wrong.  When he does wrong, someone put him up to it.  It's hard to believe that he comes out of his shell and starts talking so fluently so quickly. I personally know people of varying degrees and types of disability, and they have bad sides.  Based on Radio's portrayed developmental level, they would poke through more clearly. People like this need to be trained out of those behaviors, or they will become nuisances to themselves and society. The principal of the school looks and acts like she is straight out of the 2000s. The coach's daughter was a flat character who was a little whiny. It is hard to believe that the students who once persecuted him would turn so nonchalantly into his adoring allies.  Additionally, wasn't there a law by 1976 that said special education was a mandatory offering in the public schools?  Why wasn't he in school before?  Also, it is unclear exactly how Radio helps the team.  The team only goes .500.  There is no sense of triumph or overcoming adversity to achieve greatness like there was in the great ""Remember the Titans."" I believe the film set out to be like ""Titans,""(which I heartily recommend instead) but it seems like a low budget effort with blunders here there and everywhere.  I suggest ""Rain Man"" also.",1217721600,6,1449,4.7103174603174605
1842456,5,B00008EY60,"First, let me say that I loved the movie.  It's incredibly touching in many ways, and there are several reviews on Amazon that detail the movie.  On the other hand, I think Radio was probably faking it.

Who wouldn't like to be the Big Man on Campus for the rest of their life?
Kid 1: ""Whos that?""
Kid 2: ""Dude, c'mon! How lame are you? You don't friggin' know Radio?!""

It would be a constant walk through the hallways, getting shout-outs, high-fives, and all sorts of attention.

Who wouldn't kill for the chance to appear to be the smartest kid in class year after year after year?

History: What year did Napolean gain back his country after being exiled to Elba?
*Radio rudely yells out, ""1815!!"" without raising his hand
English: Name a town in Scotland that happens to be a palindrome.
*Radio shouts out, yet again, ""GLENELG!""
Math: Whats the smallest natural number whose name uses the five vowels a, e, i, o, u in any order?
*Radio interrupts the math nerd in the front of class, ""One thousand five.""
Meanwhile, nearly every kid that wants to learn something in class hates Radio because they cant be totally sure if he has had the wrong answer for the past 20 years. On top of that, they can't be sure if the teacher is worried about correcting the beloved Radio, and, therefore, worried about losing his or her job.

Who wouldn't like to be the assistant coach of a football team, with absolutely no limits or restrictions?
The guy gets to run on field during timeouts and breaks, run his own plays, yell at the players, cheer with the cheerleaders, and just basically run rampant. He gets cheered on by thousands every Friday night. You know he gets in the games for free. And if you think he doesn't get free hot dogs and soft drinks at the concession stand, you're fooling yourself.

Who wouldn't enjoy free school lunches for eternity?
Each year he surely gets to choose his favorite foods, picking and choosing what gets scratched from the list of foods available to the student body. It's getting to experience the age-old question: If you could have only one food for the rest of your life, what would it be?

Who wouldn't want to play DJ on a daily basis over the schools PA system?
He gets to make the announcements every morning, surely throwing in a little flavor from time to time. Inside jokes, blowing into the mic., calling out the names of buddies, making obscene comments (because people assume he doesn't know better), the possibilities are endless.

I rented the DVD fearful that his portrayal would not ring true, but he completely won me over.  The key, I think, is his eyes -- his dull stare perfectly conveys Radio's mental slowness.  I never felt that I was watching Cuba Gooding, Jr. -- I was just seeing the character.  The rest of the cast is terrific, too.

I was also pleasantly surprised that the football and basketball teams who come to love Radio don't ""win the big game"" as in most sports underdog films.  In fact, the sports action is just a backdrop for the main story.

I had actually seen a documentary about the subject Radio when this movie came out, so to see the movie afterward and see just how well Gooding played this role was what made me like this movie even more.

As to the movie, I thought it was decent. A well written story with good acting, if a bit much on the sentimental, and not tense enough to make it completely compelling. There are plenty of other reviews of the film exsit on here, I'll let you read those.

As to the DVD package, it's definitely better than average. The film is presented in it's 1.85:1 widescreen ratio, and both the picture and sound are very good, as is the standard these days. Director Mike Tollin's commentary is worth listening to, and goes into a lot of detail on how they made the film, and how they got it right. Six deleted scenes also have good commentary as to why they got nixed.

There are no less than three documentaries on here. One, Tuning In: The Making of Radio shows who the real Radio is, and who the real Coach Jones. This shows what it's really like in Anderson SC, and seeing those who the film is really about, and what the real story is. Next is Writing Radio, with screenwriter Mike Rich. Like Tuning In, this looks into preparing for the telling of the story, and how much work Rich put into it. Last is best, The 12-Hour Football Games of Radio. This documentary shows the process they went through to find kids to play the sports in the movie, and the behind scenes preparation of how they made it work. Sports Coordinator Mark Ellis is the champion here, shown putting the actors through the rigours of training camp, and creating inspiring authenticity to the games on screen, often at 4am in the morning, with great insight into what it takes to pull something like this off.

But the movie flawlessly shows how Radio becomes a better person as do the people he affects.  Cuba Gooding Jr. interprets rather than inhabits his role, but he does a good job in conveying the physical and emotional handicaps he overcomes.

Great support too from M Ephata Mekkerson as Radio's mother; Alfre Woodard as the principal and Chris Mulkey as the jock and prejudicial father of one of the ""badder"" boys.

The optimum circumstance is if the reader or viewer has no prior knowledge of the story's content, but just lets the story unfold.  That was my circumstance when I watched ""Radio.""

It was easy to be attracted to this story with the two leads of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ed Harris, who has been one of my favorites since he played John Glenn in ""The Right Stuff.""  Very early on it could be told that this story had makings with the sought-after qualities enumerated above.  So, armed with full knowledge of the sins of many modern film makers, while watching I found myself mentally muttering: Don't screw it up . . . don't screw it up . . .  don't screw it up.

They didn't.  This story is told with a subtlety and sensitivity worthy of Chinese director Zhang Yimou, which is the highest of all possible flattery from this reviewer.  The writing and directing was probably constrained by the real-life circumstances on which the story was based, and that is good, because anything that would have been added to this story to add ""drama"" or ""interest"" would surely have diminished it mightily.  This is simply a wonderful story, wonderfully told.

Cast:  Ed Harris, Cuba Gooding Jr., Alfre Woodard, S. Epatha Merkerson, Brent Sexton, Chris Mulkey, Sarah Drew, Riley Smith, Patrick Breen, Debra Winger.

Rated PG for some language.

Running Time:  109 minutes.

Cuba Gooding Jr. returns to Oscar-worthy status with this touching, yet predictable story based on true events. A mentally challenged young man (Gooding Jr.) who continuously walks around a small South Carolina town with a shopping cart and a radio is enthralled by the high school football practices every afternoon.  The high school athletes at first give the invalid a hassle, but soon realize the emotional boost that he gives not only the football team, but the entire community.

Ed Harris stars in one of his few main roles of the past half-decade (instead of supporting roles such as ""The Truman Show"", A Beautiful Mind"", ""The Enemy at the Gates"") as Coach Jones, the local hero who puts himself on the line when he allows Radio to attend practices and walk the sidelines with the team.  Alfre Woodard is excellent as the high school football team's biggest booster who feels that Radio is nothing but a disturbance and is taking the limelight away from his own son's abilities and achievements on the field.

While the overall concept and symbolism of the story is poignant, this film offers nothing that we have not seen before.  The underdog-who-helps-the-team-overcome-adversity-and-win-the-championshp has only been overdone since ""Hoosiers"" for the past twenty years, which makes the likes of a solid film such as ""Radio"" left as a predictable and fusty, yet heartwarming tale.  Novice director Michael Tollin has a long way to go in the business, but does fine working with a fairly mediocre script from the heavily acclaimed screenwriter Mike Rich (""Finding Forester"", ""The Rookie"").  Not the best of its kind, but certainly a film that the whole family can enjoy.",1115856000,,1920,5.131832797427653
1842514,1,B00008EY60,"Cuba's performance is an embarrassment, and the script is so laden with well-meaning platitudes that it grows nauseating after a while.  I felt bad for Gooding; he really seemed desperate for another Oscar nomination, and to my eyes he seemed to be trying way too hard.  Toward the end it gets so sugary sweet I felt my teeth begin to ache.

Unless you're easily manipulated by cheap sentiment, or are a sucker for ""inspiring"" true stories, then stay far away.

1842517,3,B00008EY60,"""Radio"" tells the true life story of a high school football coach who befriends a severely mentally retarded young man (whom they nickname ""Radio"" because he loves listening to the radio so much), lets him hang out with the team, and, thereby, changes not only the boy's life but the lives of just about everyone in the South Carolina town in which they live.  When Radio's behavior on the sidelines begins to serve as a distraction during the games, some of the less sympathetic, diehard football fans of the town make an effort to downplay his role or eliminate his presence altogether.

Set in 1976, ""Radio"" is a thoroughly predictable, sentimental heart tugger that will have people either gagging on the syrup or crying in their popcorn.  For all its heavy handed manipulation, however, ""Radio"" turns out to be a pretty decent little film due, primarily, to the superb performances by Ed Harris and Cube Gooding Jr., and to the fact that the movie doesn't overplay its hand as often as it might.  In fact, it wisely underplays much of the conflict, allowing the moments of quiet subtlety to predominate.  As played by Harris, Coach Jones is a solid, decent, caring man who can't help but give his love to a fellow human being who needs it.  Harris' soft-spoken strength makes us believe in the goodness of the man.  The film does an effective job conveying the incredulous reactions of many of the otherwise well-meaning town folk, as even Radio's own mother asks Joe why he is doing what he's doing.  The scenes between Jones and this woman, lovingly played by S. Epatha Merkerson, are some of the finest in the film.  The movie also isn't afraid to confront the issue of whether the people of the town - and that includes Jones himself - aren't actually being patronizing towards Radio in their treatment of him, and whether he isn't more of a ""mascot"" for the team than a bona fide member.  Gooding Jr. slips effortlessly into the role of Radio, making him a compelling figure even though he has virtually no lines of dialogue in the movie.  Alfre Woodard is excellent as the caring but nervous school principal who sees Radio's presence on campus as a potential threat to student safety, but who has enough faith in Jones to give Radio a chance to prove himself.  It's nice to see Debra Winger in a movie again, although her role as Jones' ever-patient, ever-supportive wife, doesn't give her much room to strut her stuff as an actress.

There's no denying that ""Radio"" is a humanity-of-man type film that could easily set the teeth on edge with its Goody Two Shoes philosophy of life.  Be that as it may, ""Radio"" turns out to be a warm, uplifting film that even Scrooge would probably like.",1100476800,8,2700,4.680761099365751
1842518,3,B00008EY60,"RADIO is one of those feel-good movies about a group of people who overcome prejudice and learn to live and work together in harmony.  It's a true story loosely based on the real-life relationship between high school football coach Harold Jones and James Robert Kennedy, affectionally named Radio because of his love for the electronic communication gadgets.  The movie explores how the relationship between Radio (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Jones (Ed Harris) begins, grows, and develops over the years and how Radio overcomes his natural tendancies to become a local hero.

Gooding and Harris are excellent in their roles and both probably deserved Oscar nominations for their performances. Unfortunately, most critics blasted the movie for its syrupy sentiment and some claimed it was a racist film stereotyping blacks as being dumb and stupid (a criticism I never understood because the movie is all about overcoming racism and stereotypes).  Anyway, the acting in the film is good, but the movie is overly cliched and drags on too long in certain places. However, the story is a good one and the relationship between Radio and Coach Jones is fascinating.  I think the movie would have been stronger if it had focused solely on their relationship and not so much on how the other people of the town.

If you love sports and ""old-school"" memories this film is a perfect picture to watch. The movie begins in South Carolina during the 70's it is based on the true story of a boy named ""Radio"" and a football coach who takes him under his wing, Coach Jones. It is a story of triumph mixed with racism, prejudice and great spirit. Coach Jones suffered persecution from town folks for his loyalty to Radio and Radio suffered taunting and old southern racism at times. The friendship is heroic and uplifting you will not be disappointed by the film or the storyline because it will appeal to almost anyone.

Cuba Gooding Jr. is excellent in his role as ""Radio""; he takes on the intricate behavior of a man afflicted with a mental challenge. His smile will pull at your heart strings and his spirit will inspire a better life for those of us without handicaps. Gooding conveys the innocence of a man-child who wants to belong as an active part of his hometown. In my opinion he deserved to win an Oscar for this performance, especially the scenes involving his feelings towards his loyal Mother.

Along with Gooding I felt Ed Harris (as always) did an excellent job as Coach Jones. Despite the hardships remaining loyal to Radio presented, this man endured it all and assisted in helping Radio become a contributing member of his town. Harris is stoic and tender able to show great emotion and endure the backlash. Together Radio and Coach Jones manage to create a useful life where one could easily have been overlooked, especially in the South during the 70's.

I recommend this film highly for an evening of true inspiration. Not to be overlooked is the fantastic music playing in the background filled with ""old-school"" memories and all those great AM radio moments.",1091577600,,2005,4.769452449567724

This movie can have you crying from grief, then crying from laughter withing 5 minutes of each other.  Most impressively, it's a film you can watch with the whole family, and that's a rarity today.

Cuba Gooding Jr. plays an African-American teenage boy with Down Syndrome, under the alias ""Radio"" on account of his large radio collection. He is tormented by some highschool football players who tied his hands, and locked him in a shed for taking their ball (without knowing it was theirs). The coach sees Radio around that area often, and gives him a job helping him with his duties. The coach even convinces the Principal of the Highschool to let Radio attend school. But once the team was going on a trip to play somewhere, but the principal wouldn't let Radio go with them. Heartbroken; Radio practices kicking a football in the rain. He finally makes a decent kick, and it regains his confidence. A while later, Radio's mother dies of a heart attack. The coach let's Radio stay with him. The football team, and the entire school finally opens up to Radio. Radio kept playing with the football team even after fifty years.
In Conclusion: This is definatly a film for the entire family; even if your kids are too young to understand everything, they will learn the values of accepting other people who are different.",1089504000,,1189,4.804878048780488

This is the case here. All involved are excellent story tellers. This is a simple and powerfullly emotional film about a mentaly challenged man and the football coach who reached out and befriended him. It is a true story and Radio is still coaching 30 years later. It is a movie that teaches us the lessons of tolerance and respect. It is one of those very rare movies that you can sit down with the whole family and watch. Cuba turns in an incrediable performance especially considering that he has very few lines in the movie. If you thought his performance in Men of Honor was incrediable, then you will enjoy this. I saw it right after my husband got through watching the super bowl. When I came in I heard the announcer say those football players showed incredible spirit. Radio is the one who shows that, not over paid football players. This movie is so powerfull I went out and brought it so I can watch it again and again. And when my nephew gets old enough, I will sit him down and watch this movie with him and tech him about tolerance. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this 100.",1087689600,3,1331,4.264822134387352

1842552,3,B00008EY60,"I enjoyed many parts of this film. It is not perfect by far.  There are a lot of slow areas that weigh the movie down. The film didn't properly focus on its lead character but more on the actual football games. We needed to see more about Radio. We needed to see how he took care of himself when his mother died, how he felt towards Coach Jones ( not just that he seemed to like him because he gave him footballs and radios ). We needed to see how Radio really thought of the players, and being taken from his life of solitude and forced into the small spotlight as a town's precious ' gift '. I realize its hard to condense a real life story into a short movie but the director could have tried better. Instead of getting the story of a disabled black man we get "" Rain Man "" vs. "" All The Right Moves "". Sometbing was missing here.  That missing addition was probably the cause of Radio not getting more attention in theaters or from awards shows.
Cuba is a fantastic actor but I saw this role as going backwards for him. Since Jerry Maguire he seems afraid to shine again. In ' Radio ' he didn't seem to be playing James Kennedy as much as he was doing his best Dustin Hoffman impression. He was believable and Cuba is talented but there was something else missing. Ed Harris was dry but kept the film moving. The football scenes took up the film when Radio should have been focused on more.  Debra Winger was wasted. I don't know why she took such an unnoticable role. Maybe she wanted to be a part of something she thought would become a great film. Radio is good, touching and very sad at times but it has a lot to learn about standing on its own as a family classic.
I recommend this film to fans of family films. Others may not recognize the small charm in Radio. If you bore easily or family movies are not your thing you may want to skip it. But if you're a Cuba Gooding fan, this is one you'd want just for the heck of it. Radio has its faults but stands above some of Hollywood's recent ' big hits ' by far.

- gets mistreated by the police
- gets mistreated by his peers
- suffers a personal tragedy
- overcomes adversity and bigotry to emerge a community hero!
I don't care if it's ""based on a true story"", nobody's life follows hollywood stereotypes and cliches this closely. But wait! There is one surprise: ***SPOLIER ALERT!*** The team loses the football season! Half-way through the film. That's right, althought the tagline is ""His Courage Made them Champions"", Radio never makes anyone the champion of anything! Team after team fails to win, even with Radio as their ""aren't we nice to include the retarded guy and laugh at him while we do it"" mascot. I was ready for Ed Harris to have the Gatorade dumped all over him by a victory-crazed Radio, but alas, I was to be denied that scene.

Ed Harris plays to perfection the football coach who mentors Radio and allows him to be a part of the team. This gives Radio a focus that had been  lacking in his life, through no fault of his own.

This odd pairing coupled with the conflicts that arise from the varying views of the people within their little township are the catalysts that draw the viewer in and teaches us something about ourselves.
  This film merits four stars out of five due largely to its? ability to make us rethink the way we view people in our society that are deemed ""outside of the norm"" and the strong acting performance given by Cuba Gooding Jr.  His achievement in capturing Radio?s indomitable spirit serves as an important source for the enjoyment you will experience as you open your heart and mind to this gem of a movie.

And the beauty of it is, it's a straightforward telling of a story, a well-written screenplay from writer Mike Rich, that leaves all indications that no strings are actually pulled.  It will draw a damp eye from the most jaded of movie viewers, without ever seeming to pander to the emotions.  ""Radio,"" as a movie inspired by a true story, is an inspiration in itself.  As a reviewer I don't toss out 5-star ratings like candy.  For me, ""Radio,"" is the real deal.
With the DVD we get to hear director's Mike Tollin explanation of the 3 levels of movies reflecting true life stories.  There is the movie that is a true life story, the movie that is based on a true life stories (some liberties taken), and then the movie that is inspired (much more liberties taken).  ""Radio,"" falls in the ""inspired category and it plays out well.  The dramatic freedoms the film creation team took with the story based on South Carolina High School football with real life coach Harold Jones and Robert ""Radio"" Kennedy rings true.
Ed Harris, Debra Winger (usually irritating to me, but not here), and Cuba Gooding Jr. turn in fine performances but none topped by Gooding's portrayal of Radio.  I would say Gooding turns in a better performance than that played in Jerry McGuire which of course won him an Oscar.
Watch ""Radio.""  Go get the DVD.  You'll be harkened back to film making that gets it right, that tells a story pure and simple, that focuses on the human souls and connections made in the human condition.  ""Radio,"" won't disappoint.

Alfre Woodward was excellent as usuall as the principal who questioned Ed Harris' character of becoming close friends with Radio. She far excceded her role in this movie than her last role in The Core. Last but certainly not least Cuba Gooding Jr. as Radio. Who honestly could have played that role any better?

Gooding plays James Robert Kennedy, a guy who is a bit slower than most with a heart bigger than the town he lives in. He spends his days pushing a shopping cart around town, filled with his findings and of course his little radio. He gets the nickname ""Radio"" from the local high school football coach (played by the magnificent Ed Harris), who lets him help out during the practices and games after a few of his players torment Radio. You may think that the coach just feels sorry for Radio, but you'll learn otherwise as the film progresses, revealing that sometimes people are nice just for the sake of being nice.

the performances in this movie are for the most part, right on.  ed harris plays a coach whose whole life is the game of football, while cuba gooding jr. plays a lovable character with a developmental disability.  both of these actors are very good in their roles, but their parts could have been written so much better!  instead of true emotions this movie goes straight for the water-works and fake-emotion department.  they go for sap instead of character development.

The moving story is based on an actual ongoing friendship in South Carolina between a white football coach and a mentally disabled black man. While the theme itself is very touching, has great lessons for us all, and all that, it really should have remained as the 4-page article in Sports Illustrated. It's too drawn out and simplistic to make into a movie. Little surprise then that the film is sappy, overtly ""look I am so moving"", and overwrought. Plus, it is paced very very slowly.
It is good to see Debra Winger again, but not in the role of the coach's homey wife. She gets about 10 minutes of screen time in all. Cuba Gooding is better in this than in ""Fighting Temptations"" or ""Boat Trip"", but that is faint praise.

1842597,4,B00008EY60,"I liked this movie's good heart and simple story telling.  It really isn't a football movie, nor is it a struggle of good versus evil.  And though it has a few standard story telling elements, the real issue here is seeing where real human value is and how that should shape our priorities.

Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the title character quite well, especially when we see the actual man over the closing credits and can compare.  However, this kind of innocence and decency embodied in this story's depiction of Radio is often dismissed in our ironic age.  Too bad, because the helpless and defeated rage Gooding is able to express when Radio loses his mother is absolutely beautiful.  (If you have lost your mother you will absolutely understand the truth of the scene.)

Ed Harris is terrific as Coach Jones who, for reasons no one really understands - including himself - is taken with helping this lonely and lost creature who can barely speak and sees him as a person of value.  He takes care of him for reasons that even Coach Jones himself only vaguely understands at first.

In order to make a story, there have to be those characters who reject Radio and see him as a problem.  And those actors do well with the roles given them.  Of course, at least some of the enemies are won over in the end.

Debra Winger and Sarah Drew are fine as the Coach's wife and daughter.  And Brent Sexton adds a lot as the assistant football and basketball coach at the high school.  S. Epatha Merkerson is very good in her role as Radio's hard working and long suffering mother, and Alfre Woodard does a good job of playing the principal who wants to be supportive of Radio and Coach Jones, but who is also mindful of her responsibilities to other students and parents and who is also interested in her own job and career.",1076371200,,1811,4.515337423312883

I had tears in my eyes.  Gooding is believable, if you had not seen Gooding before, you would think he was like this.  I compare his performance to Hoffman's Rainman and I give him a thumb up.
Ed Harris' and Debra Winger also pull off great performances as a husband and wife.  To see Winger do such a great job in a support role was revealing to me about her flexibility as an actor.
The team, the town, the coach all came together to impact a life and that life had an impact on them.
Being a true story is really the clincher for me.  A must see, everyone will like this movie, it is good for families, school and church viewing activities.

And all the people that stood in opposition to this character, now stand in support of him. We leave the theater, we feel good about plopping our 9.00 bucks down - life is o.k. Another problem I have with this movie/Hollywood is when you see a trailer, you remember a scene, you see the movie and the scene is removed due to an inane editing decision. The problem that I have with Radio, is two scenes: One with him attending a Baptist church and another with him really excelling in the classroom, supposedly if he gets good grades he can still attend a public school, but this is never really addressed and only left to the viewers hindsight to figure out, now when the editor cuts these scenes, he can sleep at night knowing that with the advent of DVD technology, those scenes (integral or not) will show-up on the deleted / alternate scenes menu. The problem with this is the biggest impact a movie will have on an audience, is on the big screen, this is where a movie makes its first impression, not in rental where they can give us the whole story.

I will add Radio to my list of movies I want. This movie makes me wish that I could be involved with a football team like Radio was because I share the same love of the sport.

Somehow I completely missed this one when it was in the theaters which is regrettable however, a good friend put me on to this movie and I'm enormously grateful as I found this movie to be absorbing, touching and heart warming as I'm sure you will as well!
For several years now, for me, any movie with Ed Harris in it has been one to watch as he is an extremely talented actor that conveys his characters emotions very well, engendering you to his performance.  The same can be said of Cuba Gooding Jr. as well, he has done very few movies that I could say I didn't care for.  As a general rule and one that applies to this movie in the fullest, when Cuba Gooding Jr. takes a role, he turns it into an Oscar caliber performance and that can truly be said of his performance in this wonderful film.  I would also definitely have to say that it was nice to see Debra Winger in this film as the last movie I can recall seeing her in was ""An Officer and a Gentleman,"" which is too bad as she is an exceptional actress!  Last but not least is the performance by Alfre Woodard, and actress that I first saw in ""Star Trek First Contact"" and since that time I would definitely have to say that anytime I see her on screen it's time to watch what she's doing.
As of this movies release, ""Radio"" is only director Michael Tollin's second effort but it is quite easy to see with this beautiful film that he should have a long future in the director's seat.
The Premise:
Welcome to small town America in South Carolina in the early seventies where we have high school football coach, Coach Jones (Ed Harris) who is one of the states top high school football coaches.  During a practice session early in the season he notices a young man whom he later nick names ""Radio"" (Cuba Gooding Jr.), watching the football practice.  A few days later he finds that several of his football players are harassing this mentally challenged young man and before long he ends up taking him under his wings.  It doesn't take long for the dramatic conflict to surface as several people begin to question the coaches interests in helping this young man and one of the most influential boosters believes that Radio is a distraction to the team as a whole and starts taking steps to interfere...
What follows from there is one of the most touching true stories that I've ever had the privilege of watching and I'm sure that if you're even remotely interested in these types of films you'll find it extraordinarily touching as well.  I highly recommend this film to any and all who are interested in seeing a film that is, at its very core, one those films that makes you remember why you enjoy watching films so much.  {ssintrepid}",1075507200,27,2963,4.470370370370371

RADIO is based on a real person - James Robert Kennedy - and Cuba Gooding, Jr lifts this character to tender heights.  Set in a small town (Hanna) in South Carolina, ""Radio"" is a loner who is tolerated and taunted by the townspeople until the football coach (Ed Harris) turns himself and Radio around, allowing the town (and team) to mature into caring folk who make this tender man a part of the lown's heart.  Not a huge story here, but the actors include such committed stars as Ed Harris, Debra Winger (in a welcome return to the screen), Alfre Woodward, S. Epatha Merkerson, and of course, Cuba Gooding, Jr. and make it memorable.  For some reason this film has been overlooked, perhaps because it is a rather quiet and small scale treatment of the story.

1842620,3,B00008EY60,"Radio is an average film about a young man with a learning disability (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who is invited to join in with the local high school football team after the coach (Ed Harris) catches a few of his players torturing him.  The young man has a real interest in radios, so that becomes his nickname.  He eventually becomes another coach, even running drills with the players.
The film is really about the relationship Harris forms with Gooding.  Harris even invites Radio to school to take part in the classes he teaches.  Naturally, some object, including the principal (Alfre Woodard), who has to keep standing up to the school board when they want to know why a disabled grown man is spending all day in their classrooms.  Another major complaint comes from the father of the star athlete who feels that Radio is a joke and a distraction from the team.  He infects his son with this attitude and his son does some rather mean things to Radio.
This film is pretty good on some levels and rather weak in others.  Take for example Harris' family.  It is hinted at early on that Harris has never made time for his now 17 year old daughter.  This relationship is never developed in the movie, except for one scene which supposedly explains why he is so passionate about helping Radio.  The whole structure seems weak and unbelievable.  I also was not blown away by Gooding's performance.  It is so easy these days to give an actor credit just for playing the part of a disabled person.  Make no mistake, this is no Rain Man performance.
Overall, this is a good movie that could have been much better.  Considering the fact that it is based on a true story, it really missed its chance.  At the end, when we see clips of the real Radio, that is without a doubt the best part of the movie.  It shouldn't have been that way.",1075161600,,1823,4.495440729483283

The performances from the two leads are amazing.  They are given lots of material to work through, and both handle it well.  This is especially true of Cuba Gooding, Jr., who makes the mentally challenged title character come to life in a believable and sympathetic way.  The story is uplifting, not depressing like I had first feared.  Based on a true story, it is even more inspiring to see the two real people at the end.

Most people leave him alone, knowing that he is harmless, and hardly anyone even really sees him anymore as he pushes his shopping cart around.  But one day, Coach Jones (Ed Harris) finds a few of his star football players picking on Radio and he is intrigued and wants to find out more about him.  It is obvious that Radio is a little ""different"" and more than a little slow, but there is something about him that touches Coach Jones' heart.  To try and make it up to Radio, Coach Jones invites him to help out at the football practices and Radio is slowly adopted by the team.  Unfortunately, not all of the ball players and townspeople are ready to accept Radio and invite him to be a part of their lives.  As Coach Jones becomes more involved in the life of Radio, he is forced to make some difficult decisions in his own life and to see himself - and his family - in a whole new light.
Ed Harris, who played Coach Jones, and Cuba Gooding, Jr., who played Radio, were both superb in this film.  Gooding did a fabulous job of playing the sweet, innocent Radio who honestly believed that everyone liked him and wanted to help him.  His performance was definitely a highlight of this film.  Harris also did a great job as a gruff, tough, small town football coach who discovers that he does have a heart after all.  The supporting cast was also excellent and I cannot think of anyone who was miscast in the film.  My major complaint is that the film is very slow paced and nothing really happens.  I enjoy a good drama as much as the next person, but the film was billed as a kind of sports-drama so I was thinking of something along the lines of Remember the Titans with some more action and some comedy thrown in.  There are little bits of comedy and little glimpses of action, but just about all of them are shown in the trailer.  On the plus side, there is nothing inappropriate in the movie so the whole family can go and see it together.

1842635,3,B00008EY60,"""Radio"" is the story of a man who meets a boy who changes a town. Sounds sappy, eh? Well that's the charm of ""Radio"" but charm was not enough to win me over and give this movie a better rating.
The movie stars film veteren Ed Harris and a star who I believe will become a future veteren actor Cuba Gooding Jr. Most of Gooding's movies are good. I heard good things about ""Jerry McGuire,"" ""Men of Honor,"" and ""Pearl Habor."" I saw him in ""Rat Race,"" ""Snow Dogs,"" ""The Fighting Temptations,"" and was probally one of the only people who liked ""Boat Trip."" But when these two great actors come together, you would think that it would make one heck of a movie. But people are wrong all the time and I was just wrong thinking of it being a great movie. The problem with ""Radio"" did not rest with the performances of the actors. All of the actors put there best into the role, but the problem was that the script and the story was too weak. Too sappy. Too much. I felt like I was watching the same thing that I've seen in tons of other films. It was just another tearjerker about a mentally challenged person who changes a life or many lives. That genre is just getting old.
The movie starts with a young man named James Robert Kennedy, played by Cuba Gooding Jr. He is pushing a shopping cart down a dirt road, having fun. Every day he does this and he passes the sports field where he sees Coach Harold Jones helping his football team pratice for the upcoming season. The team includes Johnny, son of banker Frank Clay. Also couching team is Honeycutt. Harry focuses on football all the time during the season which neglects his wife Linda and their teenage daughter Mary Ellen who is a cheerleader for the team. Though Harry discovers James when the other boys on the team are making fun of him. He nicknames his Radio and brings him home to his mother, Maggie. Harry lets Radio hang around on the field bu Frank believes that he is becoming a disraction and the football team is becoming less of a team, and more of a social club. Then harry lets Radio sit in his class. Harry is a teacher at the school. Principal Daniels has a problem with that since Radio is not an official student. Problems arise from Radio in his personal life as they begin to educate him and learn more about how his father died, how his mother always works long hours at a hospital, and how he is just like all of the other kids, just a little different then them.
The acting was amazing. I've stated that already, but I just want to stress the point. Gooding Jr. especially. He was just amazing. He played the part of Radio so well, that people who never saw that actor would probally think that the actor was an actual mentally challenged person. All of the actors put so much love in their characters. Whenever you saw Radio on the screen, you just had to smile because he was so innocent. He did nothing wrong, yet half of the town is angry at him just for being different. But they are really just scared. They are scared of what they believe is not normal, when Radio is just as normal as you and me. It's a sad thing, being angry at innocent things, at different things. Because in exterior does not matter. Towards the end of the movie Ed Harris says that they havn't been teaching Radio, he's been teaching them. Radio has been teaching them. He taught them that it is ok to be scared of things you don't understand, but it wasn't ok to take out angry on them because of their difference.

Football coach Harold Jones sees a young mentally challenged young man walk by his team's practice everyday and begins to take an interest in him.

Radio even goes to school by helping out Coach Jones and going to classes himself.

1842637,5,B00008EY60,"""Radio"" is one of the best movies of 2003 and is a very touching story. The movie is based on a true story of a mentally handicapped young mane named James Robert ""Radio' Kennedy who got his nickname `Radio' from a habit of carrying a small radio device in his shopping cart since his childhood as he walked by the high school to watch the football games and practices. A coach for Hanna High School in South Carolina named Harold Jones sees `Radio' numerous times who walks by the school sidewalks during practice and during the games and decides to bring him into the games after Radio takes a football which was kicked out of the field and keeps it. It is around this point when Harold Jones invites Radio to join the assistant coaching staff. However, some school staff and parents of the other students feel highly reluctant to keep `Radio' on the job as assistant coach believing that he is only being used but Harold Jones completely objects to the officials desire to remove `Radio' from the school.
If you enjoyed ""Remember The Titans"", you are destined to enjoy ""Radio"" a lot as it deals with similar issues of prejudice in schools around this time although in a different light. Both of these movies are based on rather turbulent times during the immediate aftermath of the Civil Rights Movements of the late 1960s and early 1970s and the bigoted attitude that still was lingering in many schools around that time. The differences between is that ""Remember The Titans"" involves the team with an African-American as their new coach, learning to reject prejudice against non-whites and do some teamwork with their coach Herman Boone, ""Radio"" involves the powerful but true story of a guy who goes from being an outcast on the streets (he's not homeless) to becoming one of the most beloved assistant coaches the high school has ever had. ""Remember The Titans"" sheds light on overcoming prejudice against non-whites, ""Radio"" in a way involves a much more complicated issue of welcoming severely handicapped individuals into the fold as the number of mentally handicapped people is likely to only get larger in the foreseeable future (Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, etc.).
(There could be some Minor movies spoilers possible ahead but hopefully not)
 James Radio Kennedy is still assistant coach at the Hanna school and is now in his 50s and still improves people's lives at the school and brings more victories to his high school football teams. According to the movie, Harold Jones is now retired but is still in close touch with `Radio' to this very day. I've been reading some articles while net researching on `Radio' and it says that In reality though, there was no record of Harold in fact ever retiring and is probably still coaching there for all I know. Some of the timeline elements are different from the real life times when the events in this movie occurred. While the movie takes place in 1976, `Radio' himself was made assistant coach way back in 1964, not in 1976. He himself was the victim of some cruel pranks early in his career but not the one shown in the movie but one was worse. But through it all, it's absolutely amazing to learn that `Radio' went from an outcast who could hardly write or read to becoming one of the most well-known and beloved assistant coaches ever at the school.
Cuba Gooding Junior delivers a heart-wrenching yet joyful acting portrayal of James `Radio' Kennedy and in here, Gooding has never been better in any other movie I've seen him in so far. Excellent job! Everyone else does a fantastic job of playing their characters as well especially Ed Harris as Harold Jones. I felt ticked off at the character Johnny Clay's behavior at the beginning of the movie although he gradually came out and opened up to `Radio'. However he shows the cold hard truth of how pranksters can really regret their actions later on.
While some of the elements of the story are altered from what actually happened in `Radio's real life, this is a very true story and is a very uplifting example of how even some who have severe psychological conditions can become very powerful and beloved individuals. It also brings to mind the sad truth of how a lot of mentally ill patients are completely neglected on the streets and the tragedy of what these individuals face on the streets (crime, adverse weather conditions, speeding traffic, dire poverty, police brutality, etc.) and the consequences of such neglect by others. ""Radio"" though is a shining example of how even people with handicaps like `Radio' himself have can show unbelievable courage and bravery to become respected idols for generations to come.
 Some may believe that ""Radio"" may rely too much on sentimentality but I beg to differ. I for one am glad that Hollywood at least for once, managed to put out a clean, and sweet movie free of the excessive levels sexual content, foul language, and excessive pointless violence of a lot of other movies these days. There are quite a lot of mentally handicapped people in this country and the number is only going to increase in the foreseeable future but seeing this movie is very uplifting as `Radio' would likely have long been deceased by now had Coach Jones not hired him as assistant coach but thanks to Jones, ""Radio"" Kennedy is one of the most beloved coaches in this country. Whatever happened, they sure tuned into the right frequency with this movie. Go with a friend, go with a date, or even go alone but whatever the case I strongly recommend that you tune into the right frequency and see this movie today. It's brilliant, it's sad, it's happy, all in one and is one of the best movies of the year so far.",1068163200,6,5660,4.739350912778905
1842638,4,B00008EY60,"This is a movie about a handicapped guy who walks around with a cart.  He gets a chance to help coach a football team, and it makes him happy.  It also makes him do good stuff.  In the face of opposition from parents and others who didn't think this young man was capable of anything, Radio manages to overcome everything and acheive his dreams, however simple they may be.  This movie has a good moral, and is definitely worth seeing.",1067644800,3,435,4.4
1842639,1,B00008EY60,"Radio, starring Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ed Harris, is the true story of a disabled South Carolina man (James ""Radio"" Kennedy)  who was befriended by a football coach, school, and local community. The intentions behind the creation of Radio are good, but unfortunately the movie never fully explains, nor develops, the background of the central character enough to make us understand why there was such a sudden and overwhelming urge for other characters in the film to help him. The producers, writers, and directors of Radio could have told a story similar to that of Forrest Gump, but Radio does not even come slightly close to the 1994 best picture winner. Instead of developing the same type of solid characters, quality story, and authentic emotion that Forrest Gump did, Radio becomes wildly sentimental and far too maudlin. Its simplistic, child-like plot almost makes you think that Captain Kangaroo was the writer and Mr. Rogers the director. Radio has a noble concept and a good premise, but those two elements alone do not make it a good movie.",1067299200,13,1052,4.943502824858757
1842640,5,B00008EY60,"One of the best movies I have seen in my life, period (and I've seen a LOT of movies-I'm 48). Outstanding story, well acted, well-written.  I can't offer enough superlatives.  Rarely does a movie come along with this good a story that is so well-delivered by everyone involved.",1067212800,5,277,4.75
1842641,4,B00008EY60,"""Radio"" is not your typical ""against all odds"" saga, as finely polished performances from both Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris will attest to the above fact. Based on a true story, ""Radio"" focuses on the hardships of a mentally disabled man (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), who is scoffed at by the locals in a small South Carolina town. Moving about evasively with a shopping cart filled with ""goodies"" along a backwoods road, the film's subject just goes from point A to point B in roundabout fashion, being virtually ignored by everyone, until an incident which occurs at a local high school changes this man's life. He then crosses paths with the high school varsity football coach (Ed Harris), who gives Radio an honorary position on the team as a ""waterboy"" of sorts. This young man begins to win many a heart of nearly everyone on the team, including the citizens of the hometown. Besides the coach, Radio's biggest fan is his mother, who just gloriously basks at the sight of her son's accomplishments. Since Radio enamorates such a bold and enlightening presence around the football squad, he is then given an opportunity to blend in with the student body, and enrolls in the eleventh grade. Persistence pays off, as this determined young man begins to pronounce words unknown to him before, thus gaining Radio a newfound self-confidence. Also contained within this uplifting motion picture, is a touching scene that will leave one emotionally shaken. While ""Radio"" is not your typical ""Win One For The Gipper"" movie, it is not devoid of the thematic meaning the film's storyline conveys (as is the case in some similarly themed motion pictures) - that being it is not just about sports, but is about persevering against the odds and showing everyone that no obstacle is too big or too small to overcome, regardless of one's physical size or personality type. Alfre Woodard displays an Oscar-caliber performance as the school principal who's doubtful of Radio's presence on campus. Above all, ""Radio"" hits the right frequency, and is static-free, regardless of the station it's tuned to. It's playing (in stereo, of course) at a theater near you. Get tuned, real soon!",1067212800,4,2165,4.934246575342466
