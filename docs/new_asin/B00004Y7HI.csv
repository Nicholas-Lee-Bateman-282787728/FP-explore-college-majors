7926797,5,B00004Y7HI,"Nothing better for early American Indian interest and studies.  A southwest indian, not plains Indians approach.  Weaknesses that bespeak the times and makes for good discussion.",1439337600,,178,5.8076923076923075
7926798,1,B00004Y7HI,"It is remarkable that non-Indigenous Americans or Euroamericans who watch the this grossly inaccurate representation of Native peoples view it as being ""sympathetic"" to the Indians.  That only shows the enormous amount of ignorance and prejudice there remains toward Native Americans and how ignorant people are to regarding the truths of American history.

First, Anasazi and Pueblo peoples are represented in the film as lazy and indolent.  These are people who successfully farmed many hudreds of acres where the average rainfall is less than 8 inches per year.  They had to find and construct to the extent possible natural flood plains in which they planted their seeds digging deep into the soil with a planting stick.  They had to painstakingly nuture and care for these plants until they got a crop they could harvest.  They also raised various melons, squash, beans and chile.  This was an enormous agrarian feat.  Nature magazine recently declared the creation of corn through extensive and careful breeding over several thousand years as one of the greatest biological accomplishments of homo sapiens.

Coronado is represented in the film as having had a just a few people in his expedition and as having been extensively overrun by vast numbers of Native peoples as he visits the Grand Canyon.  Coronado never visited the Grand Canyon, and he traveled with a huge expedition of several thousand armed soldiers and servants;  He took with him firearms, swords and war hounds,  His expedition brutally exploited local Indian groups in New Mexico, and he is responsible for slaying thousands of peaceful Pueblo Indians, burning many at them at the stake and annilating at least 5 Pueblo nations with his brutality as he searched in frustration for the non-existant seven cities of gold

Kit Carson is represented in the film as a ""friend"" of the Navajo, and I can guarantee you no Navajo views Kit Carson as a friend.  With about 1000 mercanaries, Kit Carson forced almost 10,000 Navajos into surrender, not be defeating them in battle, but by destroying their homes, sheep herds and food supply.  Kit Carson and his mercanaries took a scorched earth tactic all across Navajoland.  He and his men burnt Navajo homes, burnt Navajo cornfields and gardens, and burnt Navajo orchards.  They poisoned Navajo water sources, and destroyed about one million head of Navajo sheep, goats and cattle.  While starvation forced nearly 10,000 Navajos to surrender to avoid starvation, they were treated with even more brutally after surrender.  They were marched over three hudred miles on foot into capativity at Ft. Sumner in SE New Mexico.  On the Long Walk, Carson and his soldiers killed any that could not keep up on foot while the soldiers rode horses and rode in wagons.  Pregnant women who went into labor or who fell behind were simply shot and left there.  While at Ft. Sumner, about half of the Navajos died of sickness and starvation.  What a great freind Kit Carson was???

The name of the movie is also part of Euroamerican fiction.  Despite destroying nearly half of the Navajo Nation through theft and brutality, the Navajos and other Native Peoples were not living up to the Whiteman's wishes and expectations by being a ""vanishing race.""  From 1925 to 2010, the Navajo population increased from about 20,000 in 1925 to 350,000 in 2010.  The general Native American population in North America reached a nadir around 1900 at maybe 900,000.  It is now more than five million.

This film is a valuable historical document because it documents the ignorance of and gross misrepresentations of Native Americans on the part of White Americans.  It also shows the enormous lies and mispresentations that most Euroamericans  people consider American history.  It is a film full of ignorant and racists stereotypes of Native Amercians, and gross misrepresentations of American history.  The fact that all the reviewers so far think this film is based on truth and is ""sympathetic"" to Native Americans shows just how much ignorance and racism still exists among Euroamericans with regard to First Americans.

7926799,5,B00004Y7HI,An honest look at the treatment of Native Americans by the government. Some of the villainy is conducted by individuals (Noah Beery) rather than due to government policy but the combination of motives set the tragedy in motion. Highly recommended!,1401408000,,247,5.2

7926801,4,B00004Y7HI,"Adapted from Zane Grey's novel, THE VANISHING AMERICAN was filmed on location in Monument Valley and the Betatakin Cliff Dwellings of Arizona. It's in part a history of western Native-Americans and the progression of conquests right up to the white man's defeat of the Navajo and the tribe's relocation to a reservation.

Just after the turn of the 20th Century, a corrupt Indian agent steals and sells to the highest bidder the tribe's best horses. With America's involvement in the Great War in Europe, a captain comes in search of the horses the agent was supposed to have paid for and delivered to the Army.

A kindly schoolteacher convinces a tribal leader (Richard Dix as Nophaie) that if his people help the war effort they will get justice when the fighting ends. Believing her, the leader delivers horses to the military and he and several braves enlist for service overseas. After the Armistice, they return home to ""business as usual"" and most feel the time has come for revenge. An army of Navajos besieges a government stronghold, and only Nophaie stands between them and all-out war.

(7.8) The Vanishing American (1925) - Richard Dix/Lois Wilson/Noah Beery/Malcolm McGregor/Shannon Day/Charles Crockett (uncredited: Gary Cooper)",1223596800,2,2014,6.171428571428572
7926802,4,B00004Y7HI,"It's pretty impressive when a silent, black and white movie made back in 1926 can still be interesting to watch in modern times. If you're open to movies with subtitles, I definitely recommend giving this a try.

Zane Grey wrote the initial story, and the movie begins far back ""in the beginning"". Not all of the story is very flattering. These cliff dwellers of pre-history were apparently quite lazy. ""Mog could sleep on any excuse or none"". Rival Indians come flooding in, much like the storming of the walls in The Two Towers. The local medicine man curses the invaders, saying that they will eventually be driven just as they are driving the innocents here.

Hop forward to 1540, when the Spanish appear on the scene with horses. Interestingly, as much as many people feel the Indians always had horses, they were only brought to the New World with the invaders. The Indians, awed by their gunpowder and riding ability, treat them as Gods.

Another fast forward, this time to 1864. Kit Carson, a friend of the Indians, is forced to subdue them to win a peace. He promises that they'll have a peaceful, content life, farming in lush meadows. Unfortunately he dies soon afterwards, and the red man is tossed onto barren reservations. The Indian Agent who should be representing them is incompetent, and his helper is downright nasty. They deliberately steal the horses of the village, even while the kids are being educated in white men's ways and playing baseball. I have to comment as a parent that it was intriguing to see the kids playing on a super-high playgym where the ""slide"" was just a pair of rods you slid down, hooking your legs over each. The definition of ""safe"" was much different back then! It's also intriguing that all of the children do a flag salute identical to the Hitler salute, which is a bit spooky.

There's prejudice aplenty here, with the villagers looking down on the school marm for fraternizing with the enemy. It causes trouble for him - but in short order The Great War begins. Her guy friend decides to do the right thing and defend his country, even though his country has never done much for him. He goes over and fights valiantly. Unfortunately, when he returns, he finds if anything that things have gotten even worse for his people.

Some parts of this are rather disturbing in a ""looking down on the natives"" way. The whole introductory sequence, for example. On the other hand, this is 1926. There were still incredibly nasty laws against blacks in the south, and we hadn't even begun the heavy western era of ""cowboys vs indians"" movies. It's impressive that this was as pro-indian as it was, being made back in those days.

Well recommended to see where things all began.",1164844800,3,2718,4.711578947368421
7926803,4,B00004Y7HI,"Even though I'm an Australian and haven't read Zane Grey's famous novel on which this film is based, I still got a lot of important points out of watching ""The Vanishing American"", as well as simply enjoying it for many other reasons.  The opening scenes are already very impressive, with sweeping views of Monument Valley, and there is something of a history lesson to begin with, no doubt making the point that the land belongs to the native Indians.  Then, in our recent history, European settlers came along and confined the Indians to a reservation.  This is where good drama begins as one Indian stands out from among the rest, wanting to do the right thing, while the `baddie' of the story, a government agent meant to be helping the Indians, starts his own evil schemes.  Noah Beery does a great job of portraying the slimy character of Booker, the crooked agent who plots to take over and cash in on the Indians' helpless situation.  The focus, however, is on the Indian chieftain, played very convincingly by Richard Dix, who takes a stand against injustice, but later he becomes despondent when it looks like White Man always gets his way in the end.  He contemplates returning to his ancestors' gods, and is torn between his heritage and what he learned about the Bible and Christianity.  I found this to be one of the important points of this film, namely the personal conflict many indigenous people face when forced to accept the ways and religion of the new settlers (not just American Indians but also Australian Aborigines, Pacific Islanders, etc) and when there is corruption or other unfairness on the part of the superior race, a rebellion or conflict becomes inevitable.  ""The Vanishing American"" shows these problems very well in a suspenseful, involving drama which also includes romance and other poignant moments that are worth thinking about a while.  The picture quality is very good, but I thought that an orchestral musical score, rather than a live recording of a traditional organ score might enhance and underscore some important scenes even more.  Overall, never a dull moment and a good quality drama from a cinematic standpoint, but also a story with valuable lessons - not just historic but still reaching into our times as well.",1112140800,6,2266,4.877604166666667
7926804,4,B00004Y7HI,"For anyone under the impression that Hollywood's sympathetic treatment of the American Indian occurred no earlier that BROKEN ARROW, and certainly no later than DANCES WITH WOLVES, and that John Ford discovered and was the first to paint cinematic masterpieces against the magnificent backdrop that is Monument Valley, THE VANISHING AMERICAN will come as a shock and revelation.  Not only was Hollywood doing it before the movies talked, in many ways they were doing it much better.

  Richard Dix stars as Nophaie, leader of a Navajo Indian tribe living on a Mesa, Arizona reservation and participant in a love-triangle of sorts between saintly teacher Lois Wilson and corrupt Indian agent Noah Beery.

 It's a while before THE VANISHING AMERICAN introduces its main players and arrives to tell its modern day story, though. Whole populations of peoples arise, flourish and die off against the imposing mesas and bluffs and desert stretches of Monument Valley, a Monument Valley presented without quite the muscular suppleness technology allowed Ford in the coming decades. The first reel takes us from cliff dwellers to basket weavers to the mid-16th century arrival of Spanish explorers.  The root causes of a group's destruction is clearly presented.  Priests are mocked and ridiculed, the martial spirit is stunted or non-existent, people become fat and lazy.  These pre-Columbian slackers are ripe for the plucking, and plucked they are.  But even a martial race, Nophaie's ancestors, are helpless against the technologically superior Europeans, who first appear riding ""monsters"" and carrying ""thunder sticks.""  This slightly dubious cultural Darwinism, which puts the pious warrior at the top of the food chain, undergirds the movie, so it's no surprise that Nophaie is constantly presented as the greatest warrior in his tribe.

  What makes THE VANISHING AMERICAN remarkable is its critique of then present-day Indian relationships.  The Mesa Navajos have been herded onto a barely fertile strip of land.  The Indian agent steals their horses and their land. Treaties have been made and broken. A number of Native American men volunteer for service in World War One and come back with honors only to discover that Indian agent Beery has discovered another method of bilking his charges. Still cheated.

  What I liked most about THE VANISHING AMERICAN was that it took a sensitive look at issues critics of Westerns rightly accuse the genre of ignoring: betrayal, broken promises, corruption, even miscegenation anxieties. Another strength of the movie is that it addresses what was then current conditions. The final act in this 1925 pits WWI Navajo vets against a corrupt Indian agency.  There appears to be a number of Native American extras in this one, as well.

 The print is in good shape, all things considered.  There are no extras save chapter selections, but a new score (considering the applause heard at the end, I assume it was recorded live) makes this a worthy addition to any Western fan's collection.",1098403200,11,3028,5.22360248447205
7926805,5,B00004Y7HI,"""The Vanishing American"" is one of the great silent epics. Directed by George B. Seitz from a Zane Gray story, this 1925 silent film stars Richard Dix as Nophaie, a modern American Indian who heroically fights the Germans on the battlefields of Europe in World War I only to return home and find his people are still being horribly mistreated by a crooked Indian Agent named Booker, played by Norah Berry. One of the first films filmed on location in Monument Valley, this 148-minute epic also stars Lois Wilson as Marion Warner, the local schoolmarm who encourages Nophaie to make something of himself, and if you can spot Gary Cooper as an extra in this one you have better eyes than I do (but that is not saying anything).
""The Vanishing American"" puts the plight of the Indians in the context of the inevitable march of history where one culture inevitable crushes another. Yes, there are melodramatic elements and the acting is slightly above par for a silent film, but there is a sense of scope and an attempt to make a ""message"" film that I appreciate given the times. Remade in 1955 with Scott Brady, Forrest Tucker and Audrey Totter in the three main roles, except now the hero's name is ""Blandy""; I rest my case. Trivia Note: the production brought a herd of 14 bisons to Catalina Island for the film and ended up leaving them behind. Today the herd has grown to about 225 and is actually being hunted to control their numbers.",1069891200,8,1437,4.6171875
