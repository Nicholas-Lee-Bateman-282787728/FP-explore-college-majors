8215926,2,B000UZUL3Q,"Although I like the format of having two people discuss the application, the DVD is more of a product demo than it is a tutorial. You are shown what Color can do and are given a few tips about hardware configurations, but the DVD is very slim on basic how-to information. For example, how to import a matte created in the geography room into the secondary room for use. That would be a very useful bit of information, especially since the process is very non-intuitive, cumbersome and poorly designed. The two gentlemen warn that the DVD is no substitute for reading the manual. That is an understatement.",1234915200,,605,4.663551401869159
8215927,4,B000UZUL3Q,"This DVD is a good primer for using the new Color application in the Final Cut Pro Suite. Most people that use FCP open Color and look at it with some trepidation as the interface is like nothing else really out there. So a tutorial DVD is a good place to start.

How this DVD works is Noah Kadner sits, as the filmmaker/editor alongside expert Stuart Ferreyra, who casually goes through Color, as Noah asks questions. At times he lets Stuart go, and he stops him at key times asking questions (hopefully when you're curious too) and wonder ""what was that he just did?"".

If there's one knock I have on the DVD it's that it moves a little slow, and there isn't much of any concentration on getting various ""looks"" using Color.

If you're looking for something more straight forward, or an alternative, consider Ripple Training's tutorial DVD of Color, which is more traditional, and possibly more comprehensive.",1226016000,,911,4.716981132075472
