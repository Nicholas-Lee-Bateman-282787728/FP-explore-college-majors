Caitlin Fairchild is a gifted student who is recruited into a military program that trains then ""activates"" its pupils to have super powers, most of which resemble ""Hulk-like"" powers. Her father was part of the program and tried to escape when she was a child. She has reoccurring dreams about the event which include her lost brother.

The animation is not the best, but better than ""Johnny Quest."" The plot is so-so and appears to be an introduction of the characters for later stories that never materialized.

The cartoon is about a PG-13 type rating. It includes GD and S***, but no f-bombs. There is some sexuality and what appears to be cartoon nudity  without areolas.

Apparently this has some cult value, but i didn't see it.",1384732800,,874,4.76158940397351
