4260145,5,B004477V7K,"After a long period went by and I still hadn't received my order I contacted the seller. They were gracious and prompt about rectifying the problem and sent me a duplicate of my order via UPS 2nd day. But when I received it I realized that although I had ordered 5 seasons of a series, one season was missing and one had been doubled. I contacted the seller and they resolved the problem for me in time for Christmas.",1292976000,,417,4.291139240506329
4260146,5,B004477V7K,"I'm not a huge television fan, but HIMYM is one of the few shows that I watch almost religiously, whether I watch online or when the episode runs on cable.  When I purchased this set, it was cheaper than if I had bought the five seasons individually (not sure if that is the case now).

This show is incredibly entertaining, but I really didn't appreciate how intricate the writing is until seeing it unfold chronologically.  This is one show where watching it from the beginning really adds to the entertainment value.  Many other shows are pretty much the same week to week, so watching episodes out of sequence is fine and doesn't really make me want to purchase the season.  HIMYM is different from most sitcoms in that every episode builds upon the last, and to get all the inside jokes and references you have to see it from the beginning.

The complexities of all the different storylines and how one storyline from a prior season comes up two seasons later to be revisited is awesome, and makes the viewer feel like they're in on the joke (ie Slapsgiving, Robin Sparkles, Doctor X).  Also, watching the characters develop over several seasons is a real treat and puts most other television shows to shame. The backdrop of NYC serves as an additional treat; I've been to NYC several times and it's always fun to see places I've visited pop up in different episodes.  I enjoy hearing the main character's (Ted's) narrative and point of view.

It also is still running strong in the eighth season when many other shows I used to like that have made it that far (eg The Office) have grown kind of stale.  This is undoubtedly one of those rare, great shows.",1356393600,,1660,4.596610169491526
4260147,2,B004477V7K,"First off, the premise of the show is ridiculous; a father is telling his young teenage kids how he met their mother years ago, but his story includes every date and sexcapade he and his friends have ever had in many lame details. I can't imagine anyone talking to their young kids about hoping from one affair to another, strip clubs and other immature shenanigans.
The series is about a group of immature friends in their 30's, whose main pursuits in life are hanging in a bar drinking, playing pranks on each other and looking for someone to ""bang"". This word ""banging"" is the most used word in their dialog, especially the self-indulgent, narcissist womanizing Barney.
 OK, it is occasionally entertaining and not the worst comedy on TV, but overall fairly dumb with quite unlikable characters.",1355270400,,798,4.867647058823529
4260148,5,B004477V7K,The How I Met Your Mother TV Series is the best ever.  It's whitty and funny and never lets you stop laughing.  I would recommend this for Adults only though.,1344988800,,158,4.233333333333333
4260149,5,B004477V7K,"Even though you can watch reruns on pretty much every station, I really liked this purchase because it allowed me to watch the entire series. A lot of things that I saw happen in later episodes, I never really caught on until I went back and saw the episode that they were referencing. i.e. eating sandwiches!",1343347200,,309,4.535714285714286
4260150,1,B004477V7K,"I started watching this series on Netflix as well to while away the time, and had to stop because the sexism started to get to me. I hated the way women in this sitcom who try to follow their dreams are NEVER supported by their male partners--the latter force them to choose between their relationships and their careers.

Lily's character is especially antifeminist. When she tries to 'find' herself in the second season, she has to support herself as a grossly underdressed waitress in a Hawai'an bar. Is this sitcom trying to tell us that women who are not in a relationship have no other recourse in the 20th or 21st century but low-paid, demeaning jobs?  Sort of, ""face the wrath of the world if you dare to walk out a relationship and follow your dreams""?

For the above reasons, not sure if this sitcom really belongs in the 21st century...",1335484800,,847,4.596026490066225
4260151,2,B004477V7K,"Items were recieved in a timely manner though exterior quality appears to be from DVD's that were burned and labels were made for each disc. As read in previous reviews, the season 1 inside cover had a clip from the movie ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"".
Several discs were scratched and DISC 2 from 5th season won't play in my PS3s or DVD player or laptop.
I purchased these items because I thought they were original. Now that I know, not only that they are burned DVD's, but also that they have poor quality, I wouldn't have bought them. I would like to know if there is a possible way to return the DVD that's not working.",1332720000,,622,4.417391304347826

Couple of the disc were scratched as well. Some would not play in my DVD player, but all worked in my PS3. I wish I would of known these were redone copies of the show instead of actual manufactured set!",1331424000,,518,4.350515463917525
4260153,5,B004477V7K,"I`ve never seen a tv serie like this in the past 5 years and i love comedy. The last one that really caught my attention was The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air. Though I never watched Friends, it seems that HIMYM and Friends are alike (they both have Pamela Fryman as director), but HIMYM is new, 21st century material and you can always see yourself in some situations, characters. Recommend it for sure... true story.",1330041600,2,412,4.581081081081081
4260154,5,B004477V7K,This was exactly as described. A great way to spend your evenings in the winter. This is the new Friends!!!,1326585600,,107,4.4
4260155,5,B004477V7K,Bought this set for my daughter for Xmas (she loves the show). It arrived speedily and in great shape. Every volume is topnotch. This would make a great gift for anyone who likes the show or just a good laugh or two. This seller was a pleasure to work with.,1326067200,,257,4.16
4260156,5,B004477V7K,"Hollywood likes to repeat itself. Well, I should say that if an idea is successful they try to repeat the success. In movies they create sequels, prequels, and remakes. In TV they make spinoffs or remakes. Sometimes they work like Frasier, other times they don't work at all like the American made version of Britain's Coupling (which was itself a British working of Friends). After Seinfeld studio after studio bought ideas of endearingly funny people who were basically loathsome people, and after Friends studios bought ideas of groups of best friends who met in public places to talk about their messed up sex lives.

Boiled down to its basic premise, How I Met Your Mother could be considered to fall into the latter category. Because I was never a fan of Friends (still not, although I have enjoyed a couple of episodes here and there, I wouldn't turn on the show of my own accord) and many critics and commentators compared How I Met Your Mother to Friends I decided not to check it out at first. There have been many Friends clones, and I felt that another one of them didn't warrant my attention. It wasn't until just before the fourth season aired that I realized I was wrong to wait so long to check it out.

I would be lying if I said that the recent appeal of Neil Patrick Harris and Jason Segel's recent box office success in Forgetting Sarah Marshall had nothing to do with my choice to check out the show. It was really my fiance who got me to check it out. While I was at work a few times Renee chose to check out some episodes in syndication on Lifetime and really enjoyed them and got me to check it out. The first episode I viewed was the season 3 episode ""How I Met Everyone Else"". In the episode Ted (Josh Radnor) brings a new girl he's dating to meet the group, and everyone in his group of friends recounts how they met each other.

This particular episode illustrated one of the brilliant elements of How I Met Your Mother's storytelling. While the initial conceit has Ted in the future (future Ted is voiced by Bob Saget) telling his kids the story of how he met their mother. At times this allows for a modicum of suspension of belief because of the fact that future Ted is perfectly capable (and at times his kids call him out on it) of embellishing the story. Beyond that we see stories within stories. ""How I Met Everyone Else"" exploits this idea to great effect. For three seasons we've seen these characters together only really knowing how Robin came to join the circle of friends, but here we get the full story and told in a way that remains engaging.

All of the characters are fully rounded with quirks that endear them to the audience rather than overbearing. The cast and crew have proven that How I Met Your Mother is first and foremost a character driven show, and even in the show's sixth season they pull major surprises. Throughout ""Bad News"" we watch a hidden countdown ticking down to the biggest tragedy in the history of the show. Over the next several episodes we watch as the gang works together to help each other through the situation. There are also running gags throughout the series, but these work to further flesh out the characters and their relationships and are not overused. In the season 2 episode ""Slap Bet"" Barney and Marshall enter into a bet that leads to Marshall being able to slap Barney 5 times at any time he wishes. Going into the seventh season only four of the slaps have been dealt, and they're typically dealt without the prior knowledge of the audience. There's also a really brilliant recurring gag about Robin (Cobie Smulders) being a former Canadian pop star that hits all the right notes (pun intended) as well.

Because it is one of the best American sitcoms in recent years, How I Met Your Mother ranks on my list of top 10 favorite TV shows. It would rank higher, but I have to admit that the show suffers from a somewhat dull main character. While Ted is not the worst in this category, I have to admit that I would rather watch any of the other characters on the show more. Also the fifth season didn't live up to the promise of the previous four. However I do also have to give this show extra credit for making even Britney Spears tolerable!

5/5

He introduced the series to me and I in turn introduced my husband and we are so glad we did. Very funny with lots of heart! You'll see yourself and your friends in this series.  Now, I am not thrilled with the company I eventually ordered through (I can't remember the name, but it was an outside link through the Amazon site).  I am currently on season 4 and every set has had at least one episode that I could not watch because of flaws in the DVDs.  I guess there is a reason they were cheaper...jokes on me.

4260161,5,B004477V7K,I began watching this show an episode here and there on reruns.  It was hilarious.  I ended up buying the seasons individually whenever I saw a deal on them.  It's even funnier to watch from the very first episode. It gets funnier as the seasons go on.  However I do have to say that season 5 was not my favorite.  The characters are not in character and I didn't find it to be as funny as the other seasons. But it is still a very funny show. Would definitely recommend.,1303344000,,471,4.188888888888889
