2671697,5,B000JJ4WJM,"I'm glad that they are finally going to have season 5 of Yu-Gi-Oh on dvd, but I wish they would have the rest of season 4 (Waking the Dragons) on dvd, because the last dvd of Waking the Dragons, that had the episodes ""My Freaky Valentine"" - ""Trial By Stone"" that came out was the one where Rex & Weevil got The Seal of Orichalcos.",1166659200,,330,4.092307692307692
2671719,5,B000JJ4WJM,"I'll try not to spoil anything, but this is one of the most entertaining seasons I've seen.  I had the day off so I spent it relaxing and watched this whole season beginning to end.  Finally some episodes where some evil sorceror is not trying to capture or possess everyone, or using some dark magic to take over the world.  Great duelists, exciting duels, and still a great villain.  So I describe these episodes as being ""Highly Entertaining"".  A great purchase for any Yu-Gi-Oh fan.",1230336000,,486,4.670588235294118
2671720,5,B000JJ4WJM,This was a gift.  So I can't review the product.  The transaction was fast delivery.,1200182400,,84,4.533333333333333
2671721,3,B000JJ4WJM,"I'm a huge fan of the series, and I was very happy to hear that the Grand Championship dvd was being released (since I missed all those episodes on the WB).  Unfortunately, this collection had way TOO much talking instead of dueling (which, I thought was the main purpose of Yu-Gi-Oh!).  I was disappointed that the other competing 'world-best' duelists had very little screen-time (we didn't even get to see their duels!)  The only good thing about this dvd collection is that it included 14 episodes onto 2 dvds, which is worth the price.",1181174400,3,540,4.723404255319149
2671722,5,B000JJ4WJM,I'm a big fan of Yugi and whilst this isn't the best season it builds up nicely to the grand finale!,1179792000,,100,3.8095238095238093
2671723,5,B000JJ4WJM,This season is the part after Yugi defeated Dartz and right before the final season. This 2 disc set has 14 episodes!,1175299200,,117,4.363636363636363
2671724,5,B000JJ4WJM,"As always, Yu-gi-oh never ceases to amaze me. This may have been shorter than the Duelist Kingdom and Battle City seasons, but regardless, it's still an amazing collection of episodes that any Yu-gi-oh fan should have in theirs. But what's with the Chun-Li wanna-be that takes on Rebecca Hawkins? She seems to have some screws loose if you ask me. Then there's the main bad guy, Seigfried. This guy is the epitome of conceit and arrogance. Overall, this is an awesome DVD set. I just wish that the Seal of Orichalcos saga had been finished before releasing this set, though.",1173312000,,574,4.75

8150591,5,B000JJ4WJM,"5 STARS  because this is another fun anime. Also the duels are great. The storyline is great also. This is a great series to watch.
There is no one loosing their souls nor going to the shadow realm after the duels was over.",1355961600,,223,4.186046511627907
8150592,5,B000JJ4WJM,Purchased as a gift for my teenage son who is collecting all Yu GI Oh seasons - great value for the price!,1304380800,,106,3.8636363636363638
8150593,4,B000JJ4WJM,"YuGiOh: Grand Championship holds some of the best duels ever witnessed on the anime series. The storyline entails a bitter family feud between the Kaiba's & the von-Schroeder's seeking dominance over the gaming market of Domino City, the place where Yugi Muto & his friends reside. The plot is quite hyper & vibrant just to fit well with the tournament setting for the Grand Championship. The pace of the plot is well timed so no viewer is left wondering what happened several scenes before. The dialogue is similar to that of an excited contestant of a tournament but in Yugi's case, that does not happen since he & his friends are caught in a crossfire between Kaiba Corp. & Schroeder Corp. Yugi feels more uptight rendering his dialogue with other characters agile & tense, but still somewhat relieved.
The voice acting is great with every emotion well prepared to fit the storyline & the plot of the anime series.
My recommendation is optional for all anime fans.
Thank you.",1287100800,,978,4.792899408284024
