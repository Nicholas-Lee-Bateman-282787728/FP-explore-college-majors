1621225,2,B00005LAZ5,"This movie is depressing, doesn't have a lot of substance, and portrays two societal misfits.  Nothing about this movie is worth archiving it on film for future generations to see.  Well, maybe as a lesson - ""this could happen to you.""  Really, really, sad.  I had to stop halfway through.  I saw it through to the end and it just got worse and worse.

There's are some nuggets of comedy, but overall, a really sad, sad movie.
Homer with the ""belle"" of the ball - now that was funny.
Homer trying to drive - hilarious.",1369440000,,518,4.4
1621226,3,B00005LAZ5,"Not something I would focus on, but okay as background noise. Actors' performances were good, but the plot is unrealistic (I hope).",1364515200,,131,5.0
1621227,4,B00005LAZ5,Was a great insite on peoples life. What can happen to you or others you know in your life time.,1364169600,,96,3.85
1621228,5,B00005LAZ5,"Watched this movie years ago, was impressed with the plot, the actors and consider it best of all by A. Konchalovsky",1363478400,,116,4.571428571428571
1621229,1,B00005LAZ5,"I hated how they referred to her as a ""he"" and ""buddy"" that really pissed me off.  Just reminds me of hollyweird's shenanigans with how they portray African American women. It was a melancholy movie; based on the description, i was expecting a comedy. All i can say is it was well acted by Ms. Goldberg and Belushi and all the characters and i was very surprised to see the late great legendary Beah Richards in the movie...much respect. Hated they killed Whoopie at the end; for me, what was the point of the movie? They two ppl down on their luck at least keep their friendship alive. All they had was each other.",1362873600,,615,4.394736842105263
1621230,5,B00005LAZ5,"A wonderful movie with two great actors. This movie can make one laugh and cry. It is about two strangers that come to trust each other and become great friends. I have seen this movie numerious times and have never tired of seeing it. Both actors put on a brilliant show of talent.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Homer-and-Eddie-The-Lost-Collection/dp/B001Q8MMCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Homer and Eddie (The Lost Collection)</a>",1338940800,5,470,6.721311475409836
1621231,4,B00005LAZ5,"This film is a lovely surprise. It is much more than a buddy film. A ""bromance"" with a woman.

Andrei Konchalovsky is a director worth watching. He adds a humanism to his works. On the other hand he has some old Russian stuff you may not like, but his American works are worthy pieces of quality movie making.

You get to love these characters. I want to see more of his English language films. I was entertained.

This film features Whoopie and Jim in an odd-ball relationship. It is is so well acted, you forget all the other films you've seen with these actors. They are perfect for each other.

This is not a comedy is the strict sense. It is touching and full. Worth the ride -- a ride in Whoppie's beat up old car.",1249516800,,720,4.272058823529412
1621232,5,B00005LAZ5,"This movie is fantastic with Whoopi Golberg as a mentally unstable woman and Jim Belushi as a mentally challenged man. Homers family is embarassed by him and Eddie has a brain tumor and thinks she sees Jesus all the time. THe two of them end up needing each other.
Fantastic movie to watch.",1234051200,,290,4.490566037735849
1621233,3,B00005LAZ5,"I saw this when it was first out, and I was shocked that it was billed as a comedy (like Nicolas Cage's The Weather Man also was last year), when it was nothing at all like a comedy. In fact it was a quite depressing movie. I suspect that those responsible for writing movie posters just don't bother to actually watch the movie, and just guess on the genre, based on the starring actors.",1163462400,5,388,4.256756756756757
1621234,5,B00005LAZ5,"I still remember this movie after all theses years, and I believed I have only seen this once or twice. It was shown in the best atmosphere...I was up 2 AM or so, and everything is just so quiet at that time. I felt every emotion of this film thoroughly. This movie is one of those gems, and I'm not suprised, because the 80's produced several memorable movies for me. This movie deals with longing, hopefulness, virginity, and some fun. I used to try to look for this movie from time to time, and had forgotten the title. I was irritated , because I remembered the name Eddie, and everytime I'd look it up; the title; Eddie, that basketball movie w/ Whoop would show up, and I'm like NOoooo!!! Well I will continue my search for a dvd, and if not I'll just order the VHS, there is still many good movies which haven't made the switch: The Dummy (starring Levar Burton), Leadbelly, and some others I'd really like to own.",1140912000,15,921,4.391812865497076

1621249,5,B00005LAZ5,"This is a personal ""cult classic"" that I highly recommend as a sweet, feel-good story with some dark twists. Adult rated for language and violence.",1411344000,2,147,4.92

1621251,1,B00005LAZ5,"Why did I order this VHS? I was not aware they were still selling VHS, I wanted a DVD. When it arrived I threw it away because I no loner have a VHS player nor do I know anyone that has. I feel I was ripped. Not looking for anything the price was very reasonable I guess I should look closer from now on.",1400544000,,304,3.765625

1621253,4,B00005LAZ5,"This is one of my favorite movies.  I would never have seen it but I was an extra in it.  The movie has a surreal quality to it that may just be the product of a very low budget but I liked it.
I especially appreciate Whoopi Goldberg (sp?) because she is such a pro and doesn't appear to worry about her image.  She was both funny and heart breaking.",1389052800,4,350,3.9714285714285715

7943730,2,B00005LAZ5,"I liked the actors but the story line was depressing! She swears a lot, defensive, shooting ppl left and right. He is dumped by his parents for over 20 years. If the ending was happy I would of gave it more stars but I won't watch it again. I love whoopi`s facial expressions!",1519171200,,276,4.226415094339623

7943732,5,B00005LAZ5,Was honestly the best acting i've seen Whoopi do. I love the plot twist mid-way through the movie to find out she's going to die because of the tumors and she's a runaway mental patient who happens to carry a gun and kill people when she needs cash.,1501200000,,249,4.208333333333333
