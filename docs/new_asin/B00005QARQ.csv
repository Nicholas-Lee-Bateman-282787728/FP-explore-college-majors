1648497,5,B00005QARQ,"For those who has viewed the Dragonball Z Saga from the beginning, know about Vegeta. The arrogant, and cold-hearted Saiyan prince whose only goal in life was to be the most powerful being in the entire universe. He would try to achieve this goal by using any means necessary, and the Saiyan Prince has shown his mean, ruthless and iron clad determination throughout the entire Dragonball Z saga. In the beginning of the Buu Saga, we see him even allowing himself to be possessed by the evil Babidi's magic so he could increase his already super strength ten times. We also see a startling and heartfelt change in Vegeta's character as he rallies himself to battle Majin Buu. For no longer does he savagely persue ultimate power, but becomes good and protects the ones he truly loves, his family. Yes, the once ruthless and murderous prince of all Saiyans becomes a true hero and fights viciously against a seemingly unbeatable foe. In the end Vegeta made the ultimate sacrifice to save the Earth and destroy Majin Buu....he sacrificed his life for his family and yes even for Kakarrot(Goku).",1009670400,5,1092,4.8138297872340425
1648498,5,B00005QARQ,"This is one hell of a video to get because it contains three excellent episodes. Vegeta is looking for atonement. It is his fault that Buu is free and he shall be the one to fix the situation by destroying Buu! Vegeta quickly shows he is far stronger than Gohan was when he fought Cell and he pouns on Buu but Buu seems invincible. Vegeta has an idea....use his own powers to explode in rage and take Buu out with you. Despite whatever Piccolo, Krillin, Goten or Trunks may say Vegeta is convinvd this is the only way. he knocks Goten and Trunks out and leaves them in the care of Piccolo for he knows if this does not work then they may be the Earth's last chance. Vegeta is now set to destroy himself and take Buu with him. Will the attack be enough to kill Buu once and for all and in this final act of will Vegeta find atonement for his sins? And what of Goku and Gohan? And Bulma and the others who have decided to find the Dragon Balls....well if you want to know....buy the tapes!",1005004800,21,987,4.172774869109948

Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,254,4.3125

After finding out he is no match for the monster, Vegeta decides to blow himself up to save Bulma and Trunks. Buy this dvd it is worth the money.",1039564800,,274,4.5

7950569,5,B00005QARQ,"Nice emotion and a LOT of action. Vegeta finds out about Gohan being ""dead"" and gets angry but doesn't go ballistic like what the back of the box says. Well he does when he fights Buu. If you liked ""Rivals"" or just like Vegeta and Buu buy this tape.",1018828800,,249,4.1020408163265305

7950571,5,B00005QARQ,"Hi,I saw this video in japanese a long time ago , and it's one hack of a DBZ Tape that includes three episodes , after beating Gohan & The Supreme Kai , Buu is hungry for more victoms , and he manages to swallow The Deamon King whole ! but there's more , after finishing his fight with Goku , Vegeta was ready for another tough fight , he has to beat an enemy wich is even more dangerous thatn Goku , and after relaizing there is no way to beat the evil villain , Vegeta had no choice but to pass away for the sake of the others (This is the first time Vegeta doesn't fight for his own selfish pride) , the Saiyan Prince said a few quick goodbyes to his sun , then came the BANG!! , Vegeta is gone , but is the threat of planet earth over? i doubt anyone who reads this review doesn't know what happends later, but i still won't say :P , i'll just say if you like DBZ you should like this Tape :)",1011744000,,896,3.875
