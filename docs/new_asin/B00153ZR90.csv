3140363,4,B00153ZR90,"Here's a forgotten TV show originally filmed in 1958 that certainly deserves rediscovery, starring Edward Binns & James Broderick as father & son cops in New York City. It benefits both from strong writing & acting, and from actual location shooting in the city, capturing a gritty, authentic ambience that adds so much atmosphere & mood.

While it's a crime drama, these are more personal, even psychological stories. No wonder, as Herbert Brodkin of ""Naked City"" & ""Route 66"" fame is executive producer. The complex motives that drive individuals are featured more than outright action -- and I'd say that this not only gives the stories just as much impact, but greater staying power as well. Add to that the nature of Edward Binns' character, a cop who often has to investigate other cops, and we get probing stories about the gray areas of both the law & morality.

The half-hour TV drama is long gone, but this series demonstrates just how much could be done with the format. There's no padding, and the sense of being in a pressure cooker is often intense. It's remarkable how much they fit into half an hour! The stories are told with quick, clever transitions, and they tend to end abruptly, leaving the viewer at first startled & then a bit contemplative. There's plenty of food for thought here, as well as solidly crafted entertainment.

3140367,5,B00153ZR90,"The release of 15 episodes of ""Brenner"" is quite a coup for 50's-60's crime drama fans.  The series, starring the terrific character actor Ed Binns (memorable as Juror # 6 in ""12 Angry Men,"" Col. Grady in ""Fail Safe,"" and Gen. Bedell Smith in ""Patton"") as veteran NYPD cop Roy Brenner and James Broderick (later the patriarch of ""Family"") as his rookie officer son, was shot on location in the Naked City in 1958 and aired on CBS during the summer of 1959.  Additional episodes of ""Brenner"" were shot in the fall of 1963 and broadcast during the summer of 1964.  Like other outstanding shows of the era (""Ben Casey,"" ""Combat!,"" ""Naked City,"" ""The Defenders"") you will get to see many New York actors getting their start in the business.  Among the guest stars in this set of ""Brenner"" are -- Keir Dullea, Robert Webber, Simon Oakland, Mitchell Ryan, Jerry Stiller, Frank Overton, George Grizzard, Lonny Chapman, Fred Gwynn and Frank Campanella.  Hopefully TMG will release the remaining episodes of ""Brenner,"" because future Oscar winners Gene Hackman, Lee Grant, and Martin Balsam were featured in those programs, in addition to Sydney Pollack (yes, as an actor, before he became an Oscar-winning director) Lois Nettleton, Michael Constantine, George Maharis, Warren Stevens, and William Daniels.

8257499,5,B00153ZR90,I enjoyed this when it was on TV. Edward Binns has not been given the credit he deserves.,1501286400,,89,4.0
8257500,4,B00153ZR90,"A very good cop show of its day that execs couldn't keep in a time slot. Superior to the Untouchables; equivalent to Blue Bloods today in a 1959-62 setting. Worth a few bucks for sure. Ed Binns is superb as the father master detective; who works in the same precinct as his son. Great list of stars in early supporting roles. An early, uncredited Gene Hackman as a beat cop; plenty of scenes and lines but not listed in the credits. Robert Webber as a cop who has to pick the law over his wayward and estranged father. More stars to come.",1477785600,,538,4.284313725490196

8257502,5,B00153ZR90,Better video and sound quality than most of these old TV shows.  Very pleased to see this really was a good tough cop story.  I only had a vague feeling about it since I was a kid when it aired.'  Thanks!,1457136000,,204,3.926829268292683

8257506,4,B00153ZR90,"This series had a tense-filled feeling of realism. It kind of bordered between a visual feeling of ""live"" and/or filmed tv drama. I wished there could have been a better fade out with the show's windup rather than the abrupt scrolling of the end credits...maybe like some kind of summary given for each case. However, a nice little police drama with great early NYC background.",1378080000,2,377,4.815384615384615
8257507,5,B00153ZR90,"This series was a personal new discovery when Timeless Video announced it, and I'm still working my way through it -- but just based on the first five episodes, BRENNER might be the best police show ever, even better than the 1960s series NYPD (with Frank Converse, Robert Hooks, and Jack Warden), better than DRAGNET (fine as that was in its two major incarnations), better than ADAM-12, and better than HILL STREET BLUES or NYPD BLUE. For starters, even though the two principal characters, Roy Brenner (Edward Binns) and his son Ernie (James Broderick), are detectives, the scripts manage to share enough focus with uniformed officers and THEIR situations so that it really does address a larger part of a police officer's lot than most cop shows (which focus on detectives). And the half-hour format and the nature of the scripts precludes too many diversions into over-acting, histrionics, or goofy comedy -- it's straight-to-the-point, no nonsense writing and directing.

And the issues addressed by the show, so far, are mostly still relevant to the world of law enforcement in 2013, in one form or another. The producers even play down the fact that the show was shot in New York City -- unlike NAKED CITY (and this series resembles the half-hour version of that series) and NYPD (1967-1969), the City of New York is not the co-star of the series, and the makers mostly avoid using easily recognized or iconic New York locations in their shooting. (In that sense, this is the mirror image of KOJAK, which was set in New York but shot almost entirely in LA, but always exploited second unit footage of NYC). And unlike DRAGNET and ADAM-12, fine as they were, BRENNER is willing to take on issues involving the department that Jack Webb, vis-a-vis the LAPD, was less comfortable addressing.

The music is, similarly, minimalist, built mostly on percussion and winds in a spare, somewhat jazzy mode, but without a distracting central theme. And Binns and Broderick, aided by an array of supporting players that include Gene Hackman, Dick O'Neill, Frank Campanella, Al Lewis, and a lot of other familiar faces, keep the acting flourishes to a minimum. It's all great, and it looks and sounds good enough. BRENNER is a must-own DVD set for any police show enthusiasts -- it starts out where the best police shows get to if they last long enough.",1356220800,,2348,4.8675
8257508,5,B00153ZR90,"BRENNER is one of the grittiest, hard-hitting detective shows I've ever watched. It has a film noir atmosphere, and does not shy away from taking provocative stands on a myriad of issues. For example, one episode explores the right of the individual to say ""no"" to the peer group pressure of a newly-formed vigilante group, a concept that strikes at the heart of functioning democratic societies.  The only complaint of I have with this boxset is that BRENNER did not have more episodes to include. Nevertheless, anyone who loves those shows from THE GOLDEN AGE OF TELEVISION which specialize in provoking reflection/discussion on germaine issues confronting society will not be disappointed with this truly excellent series.",1353283200,,725,5.25
